        "content": "(10:03 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst this morning in two cases, Sanchez-Llamas v.\nOregon and Bustillo v. Johnson.\nMr. Gartlan.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER GARTLAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER IN 04-10566\nMR. GARTLAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis case presents three questions. The\nfirst is, does article 36 of the Vienna Convention on\nConsular Relations confer rights to individuals such as\nMr. Sanchez-Llamas? The second is can Mr. Sanchez-\nLlamas enforce the right in a State criminal\nprosecution. And the third is can the right be\nenforced by suppression.\nThe first issue is -- is a matter of treaty\ninterpretation, and the language of the article 36 is\n-- is plain. It confers three rights. Article 36(1)\nsays that the consulate and the individual can have\nfree communication between them. Article 36(1)(b)\ngives to the detainee, the foreign national detainee,\nthe right to have his consulate notified of his arrest\nand the right to forward communication to the\nconsulate. And it also imposes a duty on the detaining\nauthorities to inform the foreign national under -- of\nhis rights under that section. And it's critical, or\nat least important, and telling to -- to notice that\nthe detainee gets to control the communication. The\ndetainee initiates and controls the communication with\nthe consulate. It's not the consulate contacting the\ndetainee initially. It's the detainee authorizes the\ncontact.\nThe secondary sources -- we -- we believe the\ntext is plain, but if the Court resorts any\nsecondary sources, that too will confirm the plain\nlanguage of -- of the article.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I thought that the\nargument on the other side is that those references in\nthe secondary sources and in the document itself are\nmeant to make clear that if the individual detainee\ndoes not want contact with his consular officials, for\nexample, in a case where he might be seeking asylum or\nsomething like that, that it was, as you said earlier,\nhis decision and not necessarily that there was to be a\ndeparture from the norm in international -- the\ninternational context where treaties are between the\nsovereigns and don't confer enforceable rights on\nindividuals.\nMR. GARTLAN: Well, Your Honor, actually the\narticle 36 is -- is unique and different in that the\nrevolutionary part of this is that the detainee did,\nfor the first time, have the authority to have the\nconsulate notified. Typically most of the notification\nstatutes, bilateral treaties, multilateral treaties\nrequire mandatory notification, but this is an instance\nwhere the detainee gets to control. The detainee\ndecides whether or not the consulate is going to be\ncontacted.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. So the --\nthat's what the different countries, the signatories,\nare supposed to provide, and if they don't, that's a\nmatter to be taken up bilaterally between the countries\ninvolved and not necessarily an individual enforceable\nright.\nMR. GARTLAN: Well, it -- it could work on\nthe international level as well. You know, a state\ncould complain to another state, but the question here\nis whether or not this article, as domestic law in the\nUnited States, confers a personal right to a foreign\nnational detainee because a treaty in the United\nStates, a self-executing treaty -- and everybody agrees\nthis is that -- works in two spheres, on two levels.\nOne level is the international level, but by -- through\nthe Supremacy Clause, the treaty is also domestic law.\nAnd the question is whether as domestic law this\ntreaty confers personal rights to individuals because\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And at least you have the\nauthority of the International Court of Justice that\nsays this is a right. This is not just a matter\nbetween the states.\nMR. GARTLAN: Yes, Your Honor. Yes, Your\nHonor. In two cases, the ICJ has held that this\narticle 36 does confer rights to individuals. There's\nthe LaGrand case --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That court is not a common\nlaw court, is it?\nMR. GARTLAN: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And not being a common law\ncourt, it's not bound by its own prior decisions, is\nit?\nMR. GARTLAN: I don't believe so, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think its statute says\nthat it -- it decides the particular case and does not\nset forth propositions of law that are binding in\nfuture cases. If it's not bound by its prior cases, I\ndon't know why we should be.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How many times now has the\nICJ said that this convention confers rights on the\nindividual?\nMR. GARTLAN: At least two, Your Honor,\nLaGrand and Avena, and both involved criminal cases.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And what is the view of\nour treaty partners on that issue?\nMR. GARTLAN: Many of the treaty partners\nview it as conferring a right, at least 11 tell an\narrestee of his rights under -- under the treaty and --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But do any of our\ntreaty partners apply the exclusionary rule to\nviolations of this?\nMR. GARTLAN: That's beginning to happen,\nYour Honor. In Australia and Great Britain, there -- I\nbelieve it has been --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Not at the time this\ntreaty came into force.\nMR. GARTLAN: Excuse me, Your Honor?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Not at the time the Vienna\nConvention came into force.\nMR. GARTLAN: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: We were almost alone in\nhaving suppression as the remedy.\nMR. GARTLAN: Yes, Your Honor, and --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We didn't even have\nit then, did we?\nMR. GARTLAN: In 1969? Yes, we did, Your\nHonor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And that -- that's\nwhen the convention came into effect?\nMR. GARTLAN: That -- that -- excuse me.\nThat's when the United States ratified the treaty,\n1969.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what remedies have\nother countries provided for -- for these rights? I\nmean, it's -- it's easy to say the right exists. What\n-- what have other countries done by way of vindicating\nthese rights?\nMR. GARTLAN: Typically I think the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, advising them of\nthem is -- is really not vindicating them, it doesn't\nseem to me.\nMR. GARTLAN: Typically it is a matter of\nstate to state complaints or apologies and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's -- but, you\nknow, that's what the other side said the whole thing\nshould consist of, that it's a matter to be enforced by\n-- by state-to-state protests, not -- not by the\njudicial system or the legal system taking it upon\nitself to provide a remedy.\nWhat -- what remedies have been provided in\n-- in other countries? You -- you mentioned an\nexclusion in Australia?\nMR. GARTLAN: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: When -- when was that?\nMR. GARTLAN: Offhand -- I believe it's\nwithin the last couple years.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Was there a showing of\nprejudice in that case or just automatic exclusion?\nMR. GARTLAN: No, it's not automatic.\nTypically in the commonwealth countries, a judge has a\nlot of equitable authority to kind of balance some\ninterests and decide whether or not to exclude the --\nthe evidence. And I'm not saying that it's happened\nworldwide, that it's pervasive practice, but in -- in\nsome sense, what other countries are doing in their\nindividual systems, it's nice to know but it's not all\nthat controlling because the question, again, is how\ndoes this statute work as domestic law?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, is that -- that -- my\nquestion was going to be are -- are you suggesting or\narguing that the remedy ought to be exclusion as a\nmatter of domestic law or as a necessary implication of\n-- of the treaty?\nMR. GARTLAN: It's a necessary implication or\nit's an implication of the treaty, of section 2 of\narticle 36. But --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, what would you do in a\ncountry that does not apply an exclusion remedy in --\nin domestic cases given the provision, which I can't\nquote correctly, but you'll know what it is, the -- the\nprovision that the treaty will -- will be administered\nin accordance with or consistently with, I guess it is,\ndomestic law so long as full effect is given to its\nsubstantive provisions? I would have thought that that\n-- that that provision for administration in accordance\nwith domestic law would have a great bearing, if -- if\nnot being dispositive, on the remedy, so that if I were\nanswering the question I -- I had asked you, I -- I\nwould have said, well, it's probably a domestic law\nbasis for -- for exclusion, but not a treaty basis.\nSo why in those countries -- getting back to\n-- to my -- why -- why in those countries that do not\ncustomarily apply an exclusion remedy wouldn't it be\nconsistent with the treaty for them to decline to apply\nit given the provision for administration consistently\nwith -- with domestic law?\nMR. GARTLAN: It could be appropriate. The\ntreaty was prepared -- drafted full knowing that there\nare various and myriad kinds of legal systems\nthroughout the world, and it wasn't intended to say,\nhere's the -- here's the remedy because typically under\ninternational law, the remedy is -- is a domestic\nremedy. And this -- this doesn't -- the treaty does\nnot say, thou shalt suppress.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if it doesn't\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So if the treaty --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why don't you go\nahead?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The -- the treaty provision\nthen governs only in the sense that for remedy it\nrefers you to domestic law. Is that it?\nMR. GARTLAN: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- so if the\ntreaty doesn't say suppress, what authority does a\nFederal court have to direct a State court to exclude\nevidence?\nMR. GARTLAN: Through the Supremacy Clause,\nYour Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Supremacy Clause\ngives effect to the treaty. You just told me the\ntreaty doesn't require suppression.\nMR. GARTLAN: Well, the treaty doesn't in --\nin its text doesn't say, thou shalt suppress, but is --\nit is a source of authority because the treaty says\nthou shalt give full effect to the law.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it's a source of\nauthority but not a source of authority for\nsuppression. And I find it implausible that we signed\na treaty which requires us to suppress evidence of this\nsort, but allows the other treaty partners to do\nwhatever they like, not -- not suppress, let it in,\nrely upon consular protests. Is -- is that what this\nprovision, you know, in accordance with domestic law,\nmeans, that -- you know, each man to himself?\nMR. GARTLAN: In -- in many cases, yes, Your\nHonor. Again, the -- the drafters recognized that\nremedies would be local, and so the question is for our\nsystem, for the United States system, how does the\nUnited States system -- how does it remedy breaches?\nAnd it depends upon the type of the breach. In this\ninstance, the breach here involved statements, and so\nthe breach occurred when the authorities did not inform\nMr. Sanchez-Llamas of his right to contact the\nconsulate.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, of course, that's\nassuming a causal link, which is an altogether\ndifferent problem.\nBut it's still not clear to me. Are you\nsaying that we should require the States to follow and\nthe United States Government to follow an exclusionary\nrule because that's what the treaty requires or because\nthis is the remedy that we ought to devise in the\nexercise of our supervisory powers? And if it's the\nlatter, it seems to me surely there must be some causal\nlinkage between the violation and the -- and the\nstatement at -- at a minimum.\nMR. GARTLAN: Yes, Your Honor. Well, it's\nkind of a combination of both. The treaty directs give\neffect to these rights. And we are asking the Court to\nexercise its authority to remedy the breach because\nsuppression is a creature of this Court's authority,\ncommon law authority.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You don't think that the\n-- that the remedy that the ICJ imposed in the case\nwhere the United States was before it as a party, that\nthat would be the appropriate remedy? It was not\nsuppression. It was reconsider this, taking account of\nthe failure to notify and what might have happened if\nnotice had been provided.\nMR. GARTLAN: Yes, Your Honor, and then\nsupply whatever remedy would be appropriate. And\nagain, that -- that's a call upon the judiciary to\nremedy treaty violations, and -- and that's been --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there wasn't any word\nin either of the ICJ judgments, if I recall them\ncorrectly, that said, United States, you have a\nsuppression remedy, so you should suppress.\nMR. GARTLAN: No, Your Honor, because again,\nremedies are a question of domestic law, so it's up to\nthe domestic courts to decide what would be the\nappropriate remedy.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, did you ask for any\nremedy in this case other than suppression? This arose\non the motion to suppress, am I right?\nMR. GARTLAN: Correct, Your Honor. No other\nremedy but -- but suppression.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: One of the things -- and I\n-- I really have this question for all counsel. If the\nMiranda warning is given, it seems to me that that\ncomprehends the relief that you need. If the accused\ntalks with his attorney, his attorney is presumed to\nknow the treaty's -- the provisions of the convention.\nIf he does not, he proceeds at his risk. Attorneys\nhave lots of things they can tell clients, and if you\ndon't have an attorney, you proceed at your risk. I\njust think this is a very important point here.\nMR. GARTLAN: Yes, Your Honor, and many\ncourts have held that -- well, the Miranda rights\npretty much encompasses these rights, but they're\ndifferent. These are standalone rights, and what's\ncritical about this, what's really important is that\nfor every United States citizen who's arrested -- and\ntypically interrogation is going to follow quickly on\nthe heels of the arrest -- they're giving the Miranda\nwarnings. And essentially they have three options.\nThey can speak to the police. They can invoke the\nright to silence, or they can invoke the right to an\nattorney. However, foreign nationals have a fourth\noption and that fourth option is they can have the\nconsulate contacted, if they want. And the consulate\nprovides different kinds of information and support for\nthe arrestee.\nAnd it's -- what's critical is -- what's hard\nto see is that because we're in this country, we don't\nsee it, but if you're overseas and you've been arrested\n-- let's say you're in Damascus and you're given a dime\nand your options are to call the local attorney\nprovided by your jailers or the American consulate.\nAnd I think it's pretty clear that most people are\ngoing to call the American consulate. Why? It's\nbecause there's a kind of a familiarity. There's an\nattraction there. There's an appeal. There's\nsecurity. You're dealing with the known. Whereas, a\nlocal attorney, it's the unknown, and it's provided by\nthe local authorities.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That may give you a warmer\nfeeling inside, but do you think that the foreign\nconsulate is -- is more likely to give you good advice\nabout what you should do under American law than an\nAmerican lawyer that you've been provided?\nMR. GARTLAN: Well, you know, Your Honor,\nit's not really the content of the advice. The\nquestion is at this point what would people do, and the\nlegal error here, what's wrong, is that the foreign\nnational is given the same three options, but by law,\nhe's supposed to have a fourth option.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but I'm just saying\nwhether it makes any difference. I mean, you're\ntalking about anything that -- that affects substantive\nrights. He's been provided an attorney who knows\nAmerican law better, presumably, than -- than a\nconsular official. What -- other than the comfort of\n-- of speaking to somebody from his own country, what\n-- what's the substantive harm here?\nMR. GARTLAN: Well, but really he hasn't been\ngiven an attorney yet, Your Honor. We have to remember\nthis is the arrest has been made and he's confronted\nwith options.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but you -- you want\nus to write an opinion to say that we're holding our\nattorneys to the same standard of evaluation as the\nattorneys in Syria --\nMR. GARTLAN: Oh, no, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- and -- and our bar is --\nis not to be trusted to have the expertise that's at\nleast equivalent to that of the foreign counsel?\nMR. GARTLAN: No. What I'm saying, Your\nHonor, is that if you're arrested, the next -- you have\na choice, and you have one of three if you are a\nnational, but if you're a foreigner, you have one of\nfour. And the question --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The question --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But the question is who\ntells you about that choice, and your attorney can tell\nyou about that choice.\nMR. GARTLAN: But this contemplates that the\ndetaining authorities informed the person of -- of what\ntheir rights are to contact the consulate.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose they don't do it.\nThey don't do it. They violated the treaty.\nMR. GARTLAN: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: We assume that. Then the\nquestion is, what is a proper remedy?\nMR. GARTLAN: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And I'll assume with you,\nfor the moment, that -- that the treaty has to be read\nas saying you have to have some kind of appropriate\nremedy, but it doesn't say what kind. So why isn't it\nan appropriate remedy that he was given a lawyer, if he\nwanted one, and the lawyer either told him about the\nright to talk to the consul or he didn't. And if he\ndidn't -- if he did, he found out, and if he didn't and\nit mattered, maybe that was ineffective assistance of\ncounsel. So if we have ineffective assistance of\ncounsel claims to take care of the tough cases where it\nreally did matter, doesn't that suffice under the\ntreaty, or does it?\nMR. GARTLAN: Your Honor, I'd -- I'd like to\n-- to move back the discussion to there's no attorney\nyet, and the question is what can that person do. And\n-- and the error --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, he's stuck without an\nattorney. I have no doubt about that. I have no doubt\nthat the treaty was violated. I follow you that far,\nbut now you're talking about the domestic court's power\nto do what there is an international obligation to do,\nwhich is to create a remedy. I'm not sure why that\nremedy need always be suppression.\nMR. GARTLAN: Your Honor, it needn't --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I think sometimes it could\nbe something else.\nMR. GARTLAN: Yes. It depends on the legal\ninjury that flows from the violation. Now, in this\ninstance, we're dealing with statements because again,\nto illustrate perhaps, even a national, given these\nthree options -- what if the police forgot to tell the\n-- the person that he has a right to an attorney? Now,\nhe's given these two options, and he -- he waives\nthose. And that waiver is voluntary, but it's still\ninvalid as a matter of law because he wasn't given all\nthe options he's supposed to be given. And that's the\ndifference because we don't know what would have --\ntypically you don't know what would have happened if\nsomebody were given all the options. That's -- that's\na problem. So now --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But we do know, don't we,\nMr. Gartlan, that if the treaty had been followed, it\nstill would have been permissible for the police,\nhaving given Miranda warnings, to commence\ninterrogation? The treaty does not require that the\nenforcing officials in this country immediately call\nthe foreign consulate. Isn't that so?\nMR. GARTLAN: Well, actually the language of\nthe article says without delay, Your Honor, so that\nsuggests that there's some kind of promptness that's --\nthat's involved.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Promptness. And I think\nthat the United States has told us it's generally done\nhere somewhere between 24 and 72 hours. A suspect who\nhas been given Miranda warnings as here -- the\nconversation with the police, the interrogation, could\nbegin before that 24 hours or 72 hours expires.\nMR. GARTLAN: And our reading of the article\nis that once the -- the police know or have grounds to\nbelieve that the -- that the person is probably a\nforeign national, then that duty arises on the police\nto give him his rights.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's fine, but --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It's a --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Go ahead.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: We keep doing this.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, we do.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It's -- it's a duty to\nadvise him of -- of his right to have them notify the\n-- the consulate. It is not a duty to remain silent\nuntil the consulate responds. And even if you are\ncorrect that the obligation to -- to advise him and to\ngive the notice arises immediately upon the realization\nthat he's a foreign national, I don't see anything in\nthe treaty that requires them to defer interrogation\nuntil the -- the consulate has decided whether it wants\nto do anything or not.\nMR. GARTLAN: Yes, Your Honor, but in -- in\nthis case, the -- the statements that we're seeking to\nsuppress, the harmful ones, occurred about 8 hours\nafter the initial arrest. However --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, do you -- do you say,\ngoing back to -- to the point Justice Ginsburg made, if\nthe United States follows a 48- to 72-hour rule, is --\nis that a violation of the treaty?\nMR. GARTLAN: Yes, Your Honor, because our\nposition is that once somebody says, yes, I -- I want\nto speak with the consulate, it's like saying I want to\nspeak with my attorney or I want to invoke my right to\nsilence. It's a signal that this person believes that\nthey are being overwhelmed by the situation, that they\nare no longer in control, and they're trying to\nexercise some control.\nNow, this Court doesn't have to make this\nruling in this case, but our position would be if\nsomebody invoked --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, we -- we might have to\nmake it in this case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We'd have to make an 8-hour\nruling in this case anyway if -- if we agree with you.\nMR. GARTLAN: Well, our -- our position is\nthat if there's an indication of a right to have the\nconsulate contacted, that's like a cry for help. It's\nlike -- it's an alternative way of saying I want -- I\ncan't deal with this anymore. I'm -- I'd like my right\nto silence. And --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Gee, what about -- what\nabout countries that don't have an extensive telephone\nsystem, you know, where you -- you have to send a\nrunner to notify the consul?\nMR. GARTLAN: That would be a problem for\nthat country and people in that country. But now we're\ndealing with --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it -- it just makes me\nthink that -- that instant contact is not what was\nenvisioned by the treaty.\nMR. GARTLAN: The treaty is supposed to be\napplied in every country, and there are going to be\ndifferent results. The drafters recognized some --\nsome countries have different systems, different\nwaiting periods before there's interrogation or before\nthere's contact. And all this treaty does is it puts\nthe foreign national on par with an American, with the\nUnited States citizen. That all intends to do.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nGartlan.\nMR. GARTLAN: Thank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Stancil.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK T. STANCIL\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER IN NO. 05-51\nMR. STANCIL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nMario -- Mario Bustillo was not advised of\nhis rights under article 36 in direct contravention of\nthe treaty. As a result, he went to trial for first-\ndegree murder, having had no contact with a consular\nofficer from his home country and being completely\nunaware that he was entitled to do so.\nThe Virginia courts improperly relied upon\nthe result of that violation, itself the product of\nfailure to comply with the treaty, to refuse to\nconsider critical exculpatory evidence that was\nuniquely in the possession and available with the\nassistance of the consular officers. That evidence\nwould have included official government immigration\nrecords, corroborating a key defense witness, and\nproving that the alternative suspect, a Honduran\nnational, known as Sirena, fled to Honduras the day\nafter the victim died. The Honduran consulate also\nwould have provided Sirena's address and attempted to\ninterview him. Indeed, once Bustillo's habeas counsel\nlocated Sirena in Honduras, he obtained a\nsurreptitiously videotaped confession in which Sirena\nadmitted, in chilling detail, to committing the crime\nand acknowledged that Mario Bustillo had been wrongly\nconvicted.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Has the Honduran Government\noffered to arrest and extradite that witness from\nHonduras to bring him back to the United States?\nMR. STANCIL: Not on this record, Your Honor,\nbut the Honduran consulate has offered -- has said it\nwould have attempted to locate Sirena and interview\nhim. And acting with far fewer resources, before the\nHonduran consulate was even aware of this case,\nPetitioner's habeas counsel got this confession, the\npoint being it wasn't that hard to get, to trick this\nperson into admitting, yes, he -- he committed the\ncrime. And in the confession, which is on pages 33 to\n55 of the -- of the joint appendix, there are a number\nof -- of details in that confession he could have known\nno other way.\nMoreover, the Honduran consulate would have\nprovided, and ultimately did provide, a photograph of\nSirena.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, that, Mr. -- could your\nclient's attorney have argued in the Virginia habeas\nproceeding that his procedural default should have been\nexcused because of ineffective assistance of trial\ncounsel at the time of the default?\nMR. STANCIL: Yes. However, an ineffective\nassistance claim -- and I should back up. It was\nraised. The -- the habeas court disposed of it on two\ngrounds, saying it was beyond the statute of\nlimitations because an ineffective assistance claim,\nbased on the Vienna Convention, did not relate back,\nbut also denied it on the merits and said it wouldn't\nhave met the Strickland standard anyway.\nBut the ineffective assistance claim is\nineffective to address a treaty violation for two\nreasons. First, the treaty gives you a right to be\nnotified. It protects the special relationship between\na consular officer and the detained foreign national,\nand channeling these claims to ineffective assistance\ndoesn't vindicate that separate Federal right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, Miranda gives\nyou the same, you know, right to -- to reach a counsel,\na right to remain silent, and yet, if your lawyer\ndoesn't raise a Miranda violation in trial, it can be\nwaived.\nMR. STANCIL: Correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why should this be\nelevated to a special status beyond that?\nMR. STANCIL: It's not elevated, Your Honor.\nIt's actually treated more like the right it\nresembles, like a Brady right, which is not defaulted\nif you don't raise it -- raise it at trial, for three\nreasons.\nFirst, like a Brady case, a Vienna Convention\nviolation resulting in the exclusion of exculpatory\nevidence is, by its nature, not known at the time of\ntrial.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but isn't -- isn't the\nproblem with your analogy that counsel do not advise\ntheir clients about Brady rights because, by definition\nor in the normal case by definition, counsel doesn't\nknow whether there's a Brady violation. But counsel\ndoes know or, it seems to me, can properly be charged\nwith knowing that when he's representing a foreign\nnational, the foreign national has a Vienna Convention\nright, just as much as the foreign national has a\nMiranda right, and he can advise him of that. So it\nseems to me the Brady analogy is -- is not apt.\nMR. STANCIL: A Brady violation is a closer\nmatch than a -- for example, a Miranda violation, for\nthe central reason that the consular officer and the\nforeign national, working together, know best whether\nto exercise those rights.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But in this case, wasn't\nit true that the trial counsel knew about the Vienna\nConvention right and, for whatever reason, thought his\nclient would not be aided by talking to the Honduran\ncounsel -- consul.\nMR. STANCIL: As an initial matter, it's --\nit's not perfectly clear in the record. He submitted\nan affidavit stating that he never advised clients of\nVienna Convention violations, but it does not say on\nthis record that he knew at the time of trial about the\nVienna Convention.\nBut even granting that he did, the attorney\nis not in the position to make that decision. This\ncase illustrates why, and this is my second reason why\nan ineffective assistance claim, Justice Alito, would\nbe insufficient, which is ineffective assistance trusts\nstrategic decisions about whether to invoke a right to\nthe counsel, but the counsel, the lawyer, is not -- is\nnot in a position to make that decision for his client.\nAs this case illustrates, even assuming that the\ncounsel knew about the Vienna Convention right, he\nsaid, well, that's more trouble than it's worth. This\ncase illustrates precisely why we don't leave those\ndecisions with the lawyers. First and foremost --\nJUSTICE ALITO: That may or may not have been\nineffective assistance of counsel. But I don't\nunderstand why -- if a jurisdiction in this country has\na procedural default rule that can be overcome by a\nshowing of cause and prejudice with ineffective\nassistance of counsel being cause, why isn't that a\nremedy that is sufficient to give full effect to the\ntreaty, which is what the treaty requires?\nMR. STANCIL: Because that cuts out an entire\ncategory of treaty violations where it may have been a\nstrategic decision by counsel not to raise it, but\nwhere that decision is ultimately mistaken. And as the\ntreaty is structured --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's true about\nthe right to remain silent or any other rights that are\nvery much the rights of the defendant, not the rights\nof the counsel, but they're exercised in consultation\nwith the counsel, and if they make a determination not\nto contact the consul, then that's a decision that\ncounsel made, and if it's ineffective, there are\nremedies for that. I'm not sure how it's different\nthan the right to remain silent.\nMR. STANCIL: Well, I should back up and --\nand point to the first reason why a lawyer isn't\neffective in making this decision and -- and first,\nstate that the lawyer here never told Mario Bustillo\nabout the Vienna Convention. So it isn't that\nsituation where he consulted with his client and\nelected not to raise it. He didn't even tell his\nclient.\nBut more fundamentally, the lawyer operates\nunder inherent conflict of interest. The first thing\nthe consular officer does, when he makes contact with a\nforeign national, is decide is the lawyer that he has\ngood enough. In fact, it's the only form of consular\nassistance that's specified in the text of the treaty.\nIn article 36(1)(c), it says to ensure that he can\nobtain adequate legal representation. So the lawyer,\nwho's deciding whether to get the consulate involved,\nhas to think in the back of his mind, well, is the\nfirst word out of this consular officer's mouth going\nto be, well, you know, fire this guy and get a new\nlawyer. That's why we don't trust those rights to the\nlawyer, and that's why the treaty doesn't trust those\nrights to the lawyer.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But once, at least --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why -- the ultimate question\nI think is the one Justice Alito asked. I think, as I\nread the ICJ treaty, we're under a legal obligation in\nthis country to provide a reasonable, effective remedy.\nAnd why isn't that a reasonably effective remedy? Treat\nit, you know, like any other problem where the client\nshould have learned something and he didn't. If the\nlawyer is there, this is the obligation. The lawyer tells\nhim, and if the lawyer fails to tell him, then that's\nineffective assistance in an appropriate circumstance,\nor if it isn't, it isn't. But that's a good remedy.\nWhat's wrong with that?\nAnd the other obligation is, counsel, you\nhave to raise this issue as soon as everybody learns\nabout it, in which case you might be out because I\ndon't -- he's certainly learned about it by the time he\nwas on appeal, and as I read your brief here, he didn't\nraise it on appeal either.\nMR. STANCIL: I'd -- I'd like to correct that\nvery clearly. As soon as Mr. Bustillo got new counsel\non direct appeal --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. STANCIL: -- he submitted a motion to\nremand to -- back to the trial court, saying there's a\nVienna Convention violation --\nJUSTICE BREYER: He said -- when I read that\nmotion, which I'll do -- so it's in the record?\nMR. STANCIL: Yes, sir.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Where?\nMR. STANCIL: It's -- the Virginia courts\ndon't paginate the record --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Do I have it in front of me\nsomewhere?\nMR. STANCIL: It's in the record, yes, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Now, in other\nwords, he did raise it. Okay. If he did raise it,\nthen maybe he would be entitled to this relief.\nMR. STANCIL: We would have --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But is -- my general\nquestion is, is that approach sufficient under the law?\nMR. STANCIL: Getting back -- is ineffective\nassistance sufficient? Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Say, in an appropriate case,\nI can't find a rule for every case -- but that our\nobligation, as interpreted by the ICJ, is that we have,\nas the law of the land, a treaty that says you tell the\nperson about his Vienna Convention right, and if you\ndon't, now says the ICJ, there has to be some kind of\n-- of effective remedy. Now, assuming that's the law\nof the United States, why isn't this approach an\neffective remedy?\nMR. STANCIL: Because relying on the lawyer\nto do the duty of the State does not effectuate the\nfundamental interest the treaty serves, which is\nestablishing direct contact between the consular\nofficer and the lawyer.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The -- the only thing in\n-- in the second part of Justice Breyer's question, the\nonly thing that the lawyer has to be relied upon is to\nget the issue raised at the appropriate point in the\ntrial process. And -- and so, at the very least, what\nVirginia is -- is arguing here is that he waived it\nbecause no objection was raised based upon a prior\nVienna Convention failure. That is a very conventional\nobligation upon lawyers. It -- it's an obligation that\ngoes to Miranda. It's an obligation that goes to any\ndenial of rights of which counsel could or should be\ncharged with knowing, and I don't see why there should\nbe an exception made to -- to that obligation to raise\nthe issue.\nMR. STANCIL: Leaving aside the conflict of\ninterest that the lawyer would suffer on two additional\nreasons why the -- why the lawyer is not --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can I come back to the\nconflict of interest? Was -- was this lawyer a\ncompensated lawyer, or was he a public defender?\nMR. STANCIL: He was retained.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He was retained.\nMR. STANCIL: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: By whom?\nMR. STANCIL: By the defendant's family.\nJUSTICE BREYER: There -- there are rules on\nconflicts of interest too, you know. So following our\nnormal rules, is there any country, is there any\ninternational law, is there anything in American law\nthat would suggest, in respect to any kind of\nsignificant procedural failure, that the State has to\ndo more than we're just talking about?\nMR. STANCIL: I'm not sure I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And if so, what is it?\nMR. STANCIL: Is there international\nauthority required --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Anywhere. I -- I just think\n--\nMR. STANCIL: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- think for our most severe\nviolations, we provide an approach that you tell the\nlawyer. The lawyer brings it up. If the lawyer\ndoesn't bring it up and it's important or there's a\nconflict of interest or something terrible is going on,\nnormally you'd say that's ineffective assistance. And\nI just wonder if that approach doesn't work here.\nMR. STANCIL: It does not. First and\nforemost, it doesn't vindicate --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I'm not interested in,\nnow at the moment, whether it does or does not work. I\nwant to know if there's any country or anywhere else in\nAmerican law or international law where people have\ngone further than that. And there might be. I'm\nasking it seriously.\nMR. STANCIL: Well, the -- well, the ICJ has\nheld that you can't rely -- that these procedural\ndefault rules are not adequate to vindicate the treaty\ninterests.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm not talking about a\nprocedural default rule. I'm talking about the system\nthat was suggested.\nMR. STANCIL: In -- in terms of ineffective\nassistance?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, the procedural default\nrule would mean you get procedurally defaulted if you\nfail to bring it up, but I think you might say if you\nfailed to bring it up the first time that the lawyer\nknew about it. And if it's his fault for not bringing\nit up or he should have known about it, then he's out\n-- the client. But if it's not, he's not out.\nMR. STANCIL: I believe that actually would\nnot be the practice in civil law countries, for\nexample, where a judge as the inquisitor has much more\nflexibility than he does in an adversarial system when\nand whether to consider evidence that may or may not\nhave come in at the certain time.\nBut I'd like to get back to, Justice Souter,\nyour question, with respect to two additional points\nwhy the treaty -- and I'm not saying this is our rule\n-- the treaty says the State has to notify and -- and\nit doesn't say the lawyer has to notify.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No. And I'm not -- I'm not\nsuggesting anything that -- that affects that. Yes,\nthe State does have to notify him, and if he wants, the\nState has to make the phone call.\nWhat I am suggesting is that the lawyer\nshould be taxed with knowing that that is the\nindividual's right. The lawyer should be taxed with\nknowing that because it's the law of the land. It's a\ntreaty. And -- and it seems to me the obligation is\nupon the lawyer to say, well, did they -- did they tell\nyou, did they notify the consul, just as the lawyer\nwould say, did you get the Miranda warnings. And --\nand if the lawyer does not make that inquiry and does\nnot raise an objection, whatever it may be, if in fact\nthe individual didn't get his rights, then I don't see\nwhy there should be -- there should not be a waiver\nwith respect to the Vienna Convention objection, just\nas there is a waiver with respect to a Miranda\nobjection or a search and seizure objection and -- and\nother constitutional rights.\nMR. STANCIL: And again, ineffective -- an\nineffective assistance claim doesn't give full effect\nbecause under this Court's cases, if it's -- if it's in\nthe rubric of ineffective assistance, you leave\nstrategic decisions to the lawyer, and so if --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the problem at the\ntrial level, I think, is you would be -- you couldn't\nmake it at that stage because it's the very lawyer\nwho's ineffective. Here, it was raised by a new\ncounsel on appeal, and that's really the first\nopportunity it could come up because the -- the lawyer\nwho didn't give this advice certainly isn't going to\nsay, in -- in the course of the trial, I was\nineffective. So -- and that's I think the point that\nthe ICJ was trying to make when it said you couldn't\nuse the procedural default rule.\nMR. STANCIL: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, and in\nthat sense, it's very much like the rule this Court\nlaid down in Federal cases in Massaro where it -- it\nexplained just the practical difficulties associated\nwith requiring claims that need, for example, a\nprejudice record, and everybody believes that a\nprejudice showing would need to be made before you\ncould establish a violation.\nBut here, we'd have to -- we have to go back\nand we need the tools of post-conviction review to\nestablish prejudice. And here, once we got there --\nthis is -- this is not speculation. This is a lawyer\nmade a strategic decision, he says, not to tell his\nclient. And then we tried to raise an ineffective\nassistance claim, and the court said -- in addition to\nsaying it was barred for other reasons, said that\ndoesn't meet Strickland. This is that category of\ntreaty violations that, if you push these claims to\nineffective assistance, they evaporate, and that does\nnot get --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it's the same point\nwe've been covering, but all seem to concede that the\nparticular characteristics of a national system have to\nbe taken into account. And the distinguishing feature\nof our system is that it's an adversary system. And\nyou're asking us to make an exception to that system --\nMR. STANCIL: I --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- an exception to the\nusual rules that prevail in that system, and that's not\nconsistent with what the treaty requires.\nMR. STANCIL: Your Honor, it's no more of an\nexception than Brady, which is exactly the same\nsituation where you have a right that you don't know\neither the violation has occurred, because they didn't\ntell him and his lawyer didn't tell him, and you don't\nknow the evidence that could have been developed.\nHere, once that -- once that missing piece, that one\ncritical part of article 36, direct notification and\ncontact with the consulate, once that key is removed,\neverything else follows.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but that's because in\nBrady, as Justice Souter has already pointed out,\nthere's a factual piece of evidence that the State has\nwithheld. Here, the lawyer is presumed to know the\nlaw. It's just not an apt analogy.\nMR. STANCIL: We believe it is, in part,\nbecause this is an affirmative obligation on the State.\nMiranda is a rule, for example, that requires you to\nsay what the -- the rules of the game are and this is\nhow it works. This is different. This is\nfundamentally different. This says, you've got to tell\nhim individually to go out -- you've got to tell him\nthat he has a right to go out and ask somebody for\nhelp, and it gets him access to resources that are\nuniquely within the possession and control of a\nconsular officer. The government immigration records.\nThe consular -- the lawyer could not have gotten those\nrecords. They were crucial to the defense. More\nfundamentally, the lawyer didn't even know those\nexisted.\nSo even if you would assume that an\nineffective assistance claim could remedy violations --\nand -- and we certainly believe this case and a large\ncategory of other cases could never be remedied through\nineffective assistance claims as a practical matter.\nEven then, all it does is breed ineffective assistance\nclaim after ineffective assistance claim because the\ntrial lawyer doesn't know what's in the embassy's file.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, maybe after the first\nineffective assistance claim is decided in the client's\nfavor, people are going to wake up. I mean, you have\nto admit at this stage of the game -- and it's not your\nclient's fault, but the -- this is a fairly rare bird.\nAnd -- and if, in fact, it were held to be --\nlet's -- let's assume that -- that on -- on collateral\nreview, someone in your client's position made the\nfollowing claim. Number one, the State didn't tell me.\nThey -- they failed in their Vienna Convention right.\nNumber two, my lawyer never inquired of me or of\nanybody else whether the State had given me my -- my\nVienna Convention rights. And therefore, my -- my\nlawyer was ineffective. If on collateral review a\nclaim like that is made, it is accepted and prejudice\nis found, I would imagine the bar is going to wake up\nfairly fast to what's going on. Don't you?\nMR. STANCIL: It doesn't seem to be the case.\nIn fact -- and our research has revealed that about 60\nineffective assistance claims based on the Vienna\nConvention violations -- it's ambiguous as to whether\nthere's one or none where the court has granted relief\neither on prejudice grounds or performance grounds. So\nlitigants have tried, but that just shows what a poor\nfit ineffective assistance claims are.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: May I ask you one factual\nquestion? And I -- I should know this. I just -- if\n-- if I did know it, I can't remember it now.\nWas any ineffective assistance claim raised\n-- I -- I take it there's no ineffective assistance\nclaim that was ever raised on collateral review here\nbecause you've never gotten to a collateral review\nstage. Is that correct?\nMR. STANCIL: We did file an ineffective\nassistance claim in the State habeas petition.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But that -- wasn't -- I'm --\nI'm sorry?\nMR. STANCIL: The -- the circuit court -- we\nthen tried to amend -- habeas counsel tried to amend\nthe petition to specify an additional -- that to\ninclude within that ineffective assistance claim the\nfailure to notify.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But you did that on\ncollateral review as opposed to trying to supplement\nthe direct appeal?\nMR. STANCIL: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. STANCIL: If I may, I'd like to reserve\nthe remainder of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nStancil.\nMs. Williams.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MARY H. WILLIAMS\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT IN NO. 04-10566\nMS. WILLIAMS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nCounsel describes the rule that he asks this\nCourt to announce under article 36 as revolutionary,\nand I think that's accurate. It would be revolutionary\nfor this Court to construe the article 36 of the Vienna\nConvention to grant an individual foreign national a\nright to obtain a judicially created sanction against\nthe State for its failure to provide the information\nthat it is obliged to -- to provide under article 36.\nNo other signatory's court has construed the treaty to\npermit an individual in a criminal proceeding to raise\nthe kind of challenge that Petitioner seeks to raise\nhere, and certainly no other court has suggested that\nexclusion of lawfully obtained evidence would be the\nappropriate remedy for that violation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Have there been courts\nthat have held the contrary? Have there been courts\nthat said when somebody wasn't notified and they sought\nto obtain some remedy for that, that even though the\ntreaty has been violated, you have no remedy under our\nsystem?\nMS. WILLIAMS: There have been only a handful\nof courts that have dealt with the issue.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Which are -- which is the\nbest authority abroad for you that -- where they say,\nno, we're sorry, we give you no remedy, even though we\nviolated the treaty?\nMS. WILLIAMS: Yes, Your Honor. The -- a\nCanadian court has said that the -- that there is no --\nno remedy for -- in a criminal proceeding for that sort\nof remedy. And there are, in fact --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's a holding? They --\nthey held that?\nMS. WILLIAMS: It is a holding. It's a lower\ncourt opinion. It's not the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So we have a lower court\nopinion in Canada, and you -- and they have a lower\ncourt opinion in Australia. Is it fair if I come to\nthe conclusion no one has ever really decided this?\nMS. WILLIAMS: I think that's absolutely\nfair, and what's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. If -- then if\nthat's fair, is it fair also for us to say that -- that\nwe have to take this treaty, since it's self-executing,\nas if it were written into American law?\nMS. WILLIAMS: I think, though, it is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is that fair?\nMS. WILLIAMS: Yes, that is fair, but I think\nit --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. If that's fair, then\nsuppose you're coming -- suppose the treaty had said --\nand it's part of American law.\nMS. WILLIAMS: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It didn't say this, but\nsuppose it had. You have to inform this individual,\nand if you don't inform the individual, you have to\ngive him a remedy so that he is not prejudiced thereby.\nNow, if it had said that and the State or the Federal\nGovernment refused to give him a remedy and it's part\nof American law, wouldn't we have to say that American\nlaw, Federal law, treaty law requires you to do that\nrather than what you're doing, if it had said that?\nMS. WILLIAMS: If it had said that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay.\nMS. WILLIAMS: -- I would agree with you.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And once we're there, it\nseems to me what we're arguing about is not this\nmetaphysical thing about rights. We're arguing about\nwhat the treaty says. Now, if that's so, I -- I think\nwe're back to where we were in the last case and say\ndoes this treaty or does it not, as a matter of\nAmerican law, say that the person is entitled to some\nkind of remedy. And our problem there is that the ICJ\nhas said, yes, it does, but it doesn't mention it, but\nit does say that you cannot have procedural rights that\ndo not give full effect to the purpose of -- of this\nsection. So where are we?\nMS. WILLIAMS: I think the starting point is\nwith the text and context of the treaty, and beginning\nwith the preamble that makes it very clear that this\ntreaty, like other international treaties, is an\ninternational agreement concerned with the obligations\nof the signatories, not with any particular granting of\nrights for the individuals who may benefit from those\nobligations.\nAnd one thing that the preamble makes very\nclear is that matters not expressly regulated by the\nprovisions of the treaty are left to the rules of\ncustomary international law.\nThe only remedy that is discussed as part of\nthe -- the treaty negotiation is the optional protocol\nthat would permit signatories, not individuals, to take\na dispute under the treaty to the International Court\nof Justice. So there is little evidence in the context\nof the treaty and there is evidence contrary --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, the -- the thing is, I\nfound stronger the other way, which you can answer, is\nthat ordinarily, I guess, since they quote in one these\namicus briefs, since at least 1927 we consider -- our\nState Department -- the treaties that have obligations\nare -- also require appropriate enforcement remedies,\net cetera. And we have Avena and we have LaGrand, and\nthere the ICJ, as I read it, has said you have to have\nsome kind of remedy, being pretty vague about what kind\nit is. All right. So normally we follow the ICJ, if\nwe can. Schooner Betsy and go back forever.\nAll right. So why not? Just follow what\nthey say, say there has to be some kind of remedy. And\nthen we put our minds to figuring out what that kind\nis.\nMS. WILLIAMS: Your Honor, even following the\nICJ opinion in Avena does not get Petitioner the relief\nthat he seeks in this Court or that he sought below.\nIt does not get you to suppression of the statements\nthat were made.\nIt's -- it's -- there are a couple of very\nimportant things to consider in the Avena decision from\nthe ICJ. They discuss suppression and the exclusionary\nrule, and they specifically reject Mexico's assertion\nthat there's a connection somehow between the provision\nof information and -- under the article 36 and the\nongoing criminal interrogation. So -- and they also\ndiscuss the -- the concept of without delay and what\nthat meant to -- to those who put together the treaty.\nAnd it does not mean immediately. So there -- under\nthe ICJ's reading of the treaty, there would not be a\nbasis to suppress the statements that Petitioner seeks\nto suppress in our court.\nI think --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there any other relief\nsought by the Petitioner? There was the suppression\nrequest. Was there any other? Was there a request of\nthe kind that the ICJ thought would be appropriate,\nwhich was, court, reconsider this and determine whether\nthe defendant was prejudiced by the absence of Vienna\nConvention notice?\nMS. WILLIAMS: There -- there was not, Your\nHonor. The only remedy that Petitioner has sought in\nthis case is suppression of the statements.\nAnd it's also important, I think, to make the\ndistinction between the Oregon case and the Virginia\ncase. In the Oregon case, it's clear that counsel for\nPetitioner knew about the obligations under article 36\nand raised them in the motion to suppress. And so\nthere's no question about the State's obligation to --\nto inform the consul that the -- that Petitioner was\nbeing detained or any concern with interference with\nconsular access and communication. The only violation\nthat we have in the case is that the State failed to\nprovide the information that it was obligated to\nprovide under article 36.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There's a question I would\nlike to ask you about the State. Now, if everything\nworked ideally, it would be the police officer, along\nwith the Miranda warnings, says, would you like to call\nyour consulate. You could do that if you wish. If it\n-- if the State has an obligation to give this\ninformation under the treaty, but many police officers\ndon't know anything about any Vienna Convention, do\njudges, Federal judges, State judges, have an\nobligation, when they see that an alien defendant is\nbefore them, to, on the judge's own motion, ask the\nprosecutor has he been told about the Vienna\nConvention, and if not, the judge would have an\nobligation to do so?\nMS. WILLIAMS: I think that would be one way\nto ensure better compliance with our obligations under\nthe treaty. The treaty requires competent authorities\nto provide the information and doesn't specify exactly\nwho is included and who is not included in that\ncategory.\nOregon and other States, along with --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So State -- you don't\nhave any problem with State judges being enlisted as\nofficers to execute Federal treaty obligations on\nbehalf of the State Department or someone?\nMS. WILLIAMS: I -- I was hearing the\nquestion, I guess, of whether that would be something\nthat judges could do, and I -- and I was responding to\n-- to that part of it. I don't think that -- that\njudges are obligated to provide that as a requirement\nof the treaty. I think it does fall on the State\nauthorities to provide that information.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you tell us what the\nState of Oregon has done in this regard --\nMS. WILLIAMS: This --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- or other States?\nMS. WILLIAMS: We have done a number of\nthings. In 2000, the Attorney General put together a\ntask force that included consular officials, law\nenforcement officials, jail managers and, working\ntogether, devised some better education tools so that\n-- that there could be more education in terms of the\n-- the competent authorities who need to provide this\ninformation.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, how do you think it\nshould -- you think the police officer should give it\nas part of the Miranda warnings, or what's -- what's\nyour conclusion as to how it should be implemented?\nMS. WILLIAMS: The State Department has\nrecommended that as soon as it is known that the\nindividual is a foreign national, that the information\nbe given. I think that it is not --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Does this mean that the --\nthe desk sergeant in the police station or who?\nMS. WILLIAMS: We've actually worked with our\njail managers to develop a form that could be used as\npart of the booking process to provide the information.\nAnd the -- I mean, I think the more we do the\neducation, probably the better the compliance will be.\nBut what's important is that we're attempting to do\nthat not because the treaty obligates that sort of\nimmediate notification at the risk of not being able to\nuse evidence obtained in a later criminal proceeding.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it does obligate\nimmediate notification to the defendant, doesn't it?\nMS. WILLIAMS: It says without delay that the\ninformation should be provided, but that phrase,\nwithout delay, when you look at the prefatory materials\nand how the ICJ has construed it, doesn't mean\nimmediately.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, but there are two\ndifferent without delay points: one, when you tell the\n-- the defendant; and secondly, whether or not he wants\nthe consulate notified, and there's the second delay.\nMS. WILLIAMS: And the way the ICJ has\nconstrued that, after reviewing the materials, is that\nthe phrase, without delay, means the same thing in the\nthree places that it's used in the treaty. And so\nthere is -- it's not an immediate requirement. There\nis some time that can pass, and in some countries,\nthere may be considerable time.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So you think it's -- it's\nnot -- it's not required for police interrogators in\nthe station to include this? They can -- they can\nwait?\nMS. WILLIAMS: It is not required under the\ntreaty that the advice be given prior to interrogation.\nThat's correct.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, how about during the\ninterrogation?\nMS. WILLIAMS: At some point in a prolonged\ninterrogation, that right is -- that obligation will\narise.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, it seems to me it's\nnot like rocket science. You've had study groups and\neverything. Well, you just tell the policemen give\nthem -- give them the advice. End of case.\nMS. WILLIAMS: Well, and part of the\ndifficulty is it's not so easy to give simply a simple\nadvice because it's not always clear that someone is a\nforeign national, and even if there's a suggestion that\nsomeone might be --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's easy. If you\nare a foreign national, you -- that's easy too. I\ndon't -- I don't see why this is so complicated.\nMS. WILLIAMS: The other difficulty is that\nfor some foreign nationals, this is not -- this is not\nthe case where the detainee controls the contact with\nconsular officials. We have mandatory notification\nobligations. So it's important to establish what\ncountry the individual is from, and some individuals\nwould prefer that the officials not know what country\nthey are from.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, but --I mean, all\nyou've got to do is --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That's their problem.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You ask him what his name\nis. Why don't you ask him whether he's an American\ncitizen? If he says no, say what country are you a\ncitizen of. I mean, I -- I don't see the difficulty of\nthat.\nMS. WILLIAMS: And certainly we're hoping to\nmove toward better compliance by moving toward that\ngoal. But the question in this case --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But, I mean, why does it\nhave to be a distant goal? I mean, it seems easy.\nMS. WILLIAMS: And I think it gets easier as\nmore cases like this one certainly get the message out.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course, he doesn't\nhave to answer that.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Your answer -- your answer\ndoesn't give me confidence that you're implementing the\ntreaty.\nMS. WILLIAMS: But the question is when there\nis a violation and -- and if it's from lack of\neducation or lack of effort on the State's part to\nensure that people understand the obligation, then does\nthe treaty give the individual the right in a criminal\nproceeding to have that lawfully obtained evidence kept\nout of the proceeding. And so certainly we can make\nbetter efforts to improve compliance with what is an\nobligation that we have under the treaty, but that\ndoesn't take this Court to suppressing the evidence in\nthe criminal proceeding, and that's what Petitioner has\nsought from the Court.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: A little while ago you were\nasked about the judge asking whether or not to ask the\ndefendant if the advice was given him. And the\nsuggestion was made there's no duty on the State judge\nto enforce a Federal treaty, but if it's a matter of\nFederal law, why wouldn't it be a duty to -- on the\njudge to obey Federal law if -- if it is part of our\nFederal requirement?\nMS. WILLIAMS: I think the question would\ncome down to whether the judge falls in the category of\ncompetent authorities under the treaty, and I'm not\nsure how that would be construed, whether it would be\nconstrued to include the judge or if it's primarily\nfocused on the -- the State government officials who\nwould be involved in the -- the criminal proceeding.\nUnless the Court has further questions, thank\nyou.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms.\nWilliams.\nMr. Thro.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM E. THRO\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT IN NO. 05-51\nMR. THRO: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Vienna Convention does not create\njudicially enforceable individual rights.\nNevertheless, if this Court were to hold that it does\ncreate individual rights, those treaty claims should\nnot be treated more favorably than constitutional\nclaims.\nIn Virginia, if a criminal defendant has a\nMiranda claim or a Fourth Amendment claim and fails to\nraise it at trial, he may not raise it on collateral\nreview. The same reasoning should apply with respect\nto any violation of the Vienna Convention. There's no\nreason to elevate a treaty claim above a Miranda claim\nor a Fourth Amendment claim.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Does -- does -- would\nVirginia allow the -- a claim of ineffective assistance\nof counsel to be raised on collateral review for a\nfailure of counsel to -- to advise the client or take\naction on the client's behalf under the Virginia\nConvention -- the Vienna Convention during -- during\nthe -- the direct proceedings?\nMR. THRO: Yes, Your Honor. If -- if this\nCourt were to announce a new rule that the Vienna\nConvention confers individual rights, and if counsel\nfailed to raise that at trial, and if that failure\nconstituted ineffective assistance under the standard\narticulated in Strickland v. Washington, then it would\nbe permissible for that criminal defendant to raise it\nin his collateral review. Yes.\nAnd in fact, Mr. Bustillo attempted to raise\nan ineffective assistance of counsel claim, did raise\nan ineffective assistance of counsel claim in the State\ntrial court. That claim was denied, and for whatever\nreason, he chose not to appeal that to the Virginia\nSupreme Court.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I have a couple --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There was a State\ncollateral review?\nMR. THRO: Yes. It was on State collateral\nreview, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- thinking of the wrong\nthing, but it seemed to me I have a couple of opinions\nhere on habeas, State habeas, where they did raise it.\nAm I thinking of the other case?\nMR. THRO: It -- it was raised in the -- in\nthe State trial court, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And -- and not on --\nMR. THRO: But -- but what was -- and the\nState trial court chose to deny the ineffective\nassistance of counsel claim on a variety of reasons,\nand it was chosen -- he chose not to appeal that to the\nSupreme Court of Virginia.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the first time\nit was raised was on direct appeal by appellate\ncounsel.\nMR. THRO: Appellate counsel on direct appeal\nattempted to raise it. He filed a motion requesting a\n-- a remand. That motion was denied as -- as improper.\nThen in -- once the conviction had been\naffirmed by the Virginia Court of Appeals, by the\nSupreme Court of Virginia, and review had been denied\nby this Court, he went back and filed a collateral\nreview claiming ineffective assistance of counsel for,\namong other things, failure to raise the Vienna\nConvention. The trial court denied that ineffective\nassistance of counsel claim, and then there was no --\nand then the decision was made not to pursue that --\nthe appeal of the denial of the ineffective assistance\nof counsel claim to the Supreme Court of Virginia.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And the reason for the\ndenial?\nMR. THRO: There were several reasons for the\ndenial, one of which was statute of limitations, but\nthe court also noted that even if it had been made\nwithin the statute of limitations, there was no merit\nto it.\nThe record reflects, Your Honor, that Mr.\nBustillo's retained trial counsel was fully aware of\nthe Vienna Convention claim. In fact, he was the son\nof Salvadoran diplomats and was familiar with Vienna\nConvention issues. He made a strategic decision that\nit would be better to -- to contain his client and to\ncontain the amount of people talking to his client and,\ntherefore, he should not raise the Vienna Convention\nissue at trial. And that is set forth in the affidavit\nof retained counsel, set forth on pages 318 through 319\nof the habeas record in the Fairfax County Circuit\nCourt.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I think that counsel said\nthat the -- the people at the consulate -- they tend to\ntalk a lot?\nMR. THRO: Yes, he -- yes, he did, Your\nHonor, and having grown up as the son of diplomats, he\nwas obviously familiar with diplomats and their\nbehavior in social settings. And it was his feeling and\nhis strategic view that his client was better off not\nraising and not contacting the consulate.\nBut, again, this goes back to the basic point\nthat Justice Kennedy raised earlier. In America, we\ngive all criminal defendants, regardless of\nnationality, a lawyer to represent them. We charge\nthat lawyer with knowing their rights and with\nvindicating their rights, with making the objections\nnecessary to vindicate Miranda rights, with making the\nnecessary objections with respect to the Fourth\nAmendment.\nThe Vienna Convention should be no different.\nIf this treaty does, in fact, create judicially\nenforceable individual rights, then the attorneys who\nare appointed or to represent these people will know\nabout that and will be responsible for vindicating.\nThat's how we do things in the American system.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So then the -- then the only\nquestion really is this thing that I find metaphysical,\nand maybe you can explain it. To start talking about\nthe individual rights that -- enforceable, that sounds\nto me like a -- you know, a case that arises under 1983\nor something. But I thought we don't need that\nconcept. We all agree that -- that this -- this is the\nlaw of the United States. It's self-executing. And\nthe only question is whether the action here violates a\nprovision of the treaty, which is the law of the land.\nWhat else is there?\nAnd -- and the only thing I read that the ICJ\nsaid, it said, by the way, I'll tell you what kind of\nprocedural rule you can't have. You can't have a\nprocedural rule that says after you failed to inform\nhim of the right and after he's unbelievably\nprejudiced, you say he can't raise it because he didn't\nraise it before he could possibly have found out about\nthe right. That would be self-defeating. So you can't\nhave that kind of a rule.\nNow, do you agree with that?\nMR. THRO: No. No, Your Honor. We --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You explain to me where I --\nwhere I --\nMR. THRO: Well, I will certainly attempt to\ndo so.\nI -- I think the flaw in the ICJ's reasoning\nis failure to recognize that in the United States all\ncriminal defendants are -- are given an attorney, and\nthat that attorney is charged with providing\nconstitutionally effective assistance of counsel,\nmeaning being aware of all of the constitutional rights\nand all of the Federal and State statutory, and presumably\nFederal -- Federal treaty rights as well.\nThere's no doubt that no Virginia official\ninformed Mr. Bustillo of his opportunity to contact the\nconsulate, but it is also clear that his retained\ncounsel knew of it and chose not to pursue it. Now,\nthat may or may not be ineffective assistance of\ncounsel, but it does not justify setting aside the\nState's procedural bars on collateral review, which\nwould apply for a Miranda violation or a Fourth\nAmendment violation.\nI would also note, Your Honor, that the\nUnited States is unique in the world in having an\nextensive system of collateral review for criminal\nconvictions. Most of the rest of the world doesn't\nhave a method of collateral attack. So if the rest of\nthe world doesn't have to have a method of collateral\nattack, it seems rather disingenuous to suggest that\nthe United States has to modify our rules of collateral\nattack in order to accommodate the treaty.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is -- is a defense\ncounsel a competent authority under the treaty for the\npurposes of notifying the accused?\nMR. THRO: I -- I don't think that -- that he\nis, Your Honor. However, the -- a defense counsel\nwould be, if this Court were to announce a new rule --\nwould be charged with the knowledge and, therefore,\ncould I think correct any error that may have been made\nby the failure of the local officials or the national\nofficials to inform the criminal defendant of his\nopportunity to contact the consulate.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You know, one thing I find\ndifficulty understanding in this case is I just can't\nunderstand how a lawyer thought it would be to his\nclient's advantage not to consul -- not to tell the\nconsul because the facts are quite persuasive that he\nreally was severely prejudiced by the fact he didn't\nget all the help he could have gotten.\nMR. THRO: Your -- Your Honor, I would refer\n-- I -- the only thing in the record is the affidavits\nof -- of the retained counsel. He made that as a\nstrategic judgment. Obviously --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: How -- how could he make\nsuch a judgment? I just don't understand it. You know\n--\nMR. THRO: I --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Because the prejudice is\njust stark in -- in this case. It just stands out and\n-- and you just wonder what was going on here.\nMR. THRO: Well, with all due respect, Your\nHonor, we would disagree as to whether -- as to the\nextent of the prejudice. I believe that his affidavit\nin -- both with respect to the Vienna Convention claim\nand his previous affidavit with respect to just other\nvarieties of ineffective assistance of counsel claims,\nindicates that he had some concern about the\ncredibility of some these witnesses who were\nidentifying Mr. Sirena.\nBut in any event, he made that strategic\njudgment. The trial court said that it was not\nineffective assistance of counsel, and for whatever\nreason, that judgment was not appealed to the Virginia\nSupreme Court.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You know, that's kind\nof a tough position to put the lawyer in. If he's not\na competent authority for notification purposes and he\nmakes the judgment that, you know, I don't think it's\ngoing to do any good to notify the consulate, wouldn't\nhe be better advised not to tell his client about it?\nBecause if he does, then it's, I guess, harmless error\nthat the State hasn't notified him, and if he doesn't,\nit's kind of an ace in the hole. You see how the trial\ngoes, and at the end say, by the way, the State never\nnotified my client.\nMR. THRO: That's perhaps so, Your Honor, and\nthat's one thing -- thing that, whatever rule you\ncraft, you need to be very careful of and that is\npreventing gamesmanship on -- on the part of attorneys\nand criminal defendants so that these Vienna Convention\nclaims are not raised after the fact, which is another\nreason to -- to --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's kind of like a\nspeedy trial claim. Right? I mean, if the lawyer knows\nhe has a right to a trial within a certain number of\ndays, and he doesn't -- it's not his obligation to\nnotify the State. He just kind of watches the clock\nand lets the clock run out, and then he has a claim\nbased on that. Right?\nMR. THRO: Yes, Your Honor, he would.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, that might be\nlikely if there had been a history of these claims\nbeing successful, but none has ever prevailed. So I\ndoubt if that would be very -- very good to figure you\ncan, you know, save your -- your key argument that has\nno precedent of winning.\nMR. THRO: Yes, Your Honor, and that would\nobviously be if your -- if this Court announced a new\nrule, then that would perhaps change the thing.\nIf there are no further questions, thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Thro.\nMr. Garre.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. GARRE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThe failure to inform a foreign national that\nhis consulate may be notified in the event of his\narrest gives rise to a treaty violation between\nsovereign states, but it does not give rise to an\nindividually enforceable right. That follows from the\ntext of the Vienna Convention and its ratification\nhistory --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I wonder what that means.\nSuppose that the treaty provides that if the individual\nsends a letter to the counsel, they have to deliver it.\nDoesn't it?\nMR. GARRE: It does, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, suppose a sheriff\nsomewhere grabs the letter, keeps it, and the counsel\nsues him under State property law. And State property\nlaw, they say, entitles me, says the counsel, to this\nletter. It's mine. It was sent to me. Now, if that\nhappens to be the interpretation of the judge in the\nState of X the sheriff can keep the letter, wouldn't\nyou say that that property law of the State is invalid\nin light of this provision of the treaty, which is the\nlaw of the United States self-executing?\nMR. GARRE: I think in that situation you\nwould have -- you wouldn't be asserting an individual\nright under the treaty. You ultimately --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. I just would like an\nanswer to my question.\nMR. GARRE: There could be situations --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. I've given you the\nstraight facts. The straight facts are they sue -- I\ndon't have to repeat them. I want to know under --\nunder my straight facts, wouldn't you say that -- you\ngot the question.\nMR. GARRE: The straight -- I think the\nanswer would be is you would have a treaty violation if\nyou had a State law which prevented our Nation from\ngiving effect to our obligations under the Vienna\nConvention --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But I'm not saying a treaty.\nI'm saying there's a letter and wouldn't it be the\ncase that the judge would have to say, here, Mr.\nSheriff, you take the letter and you hand it to the\ncounsel? It's his property.\nMR. GARRE: If they were asserting a cause of\naction under State property law and that were the\nresult, then yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's correct.\nMR. GARRE: That would be the case, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay, fine.\nMR. GARRE: But -- but --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And now what they're doing\nhere is they're saying we have a cause of action. It's\ncalled habeas corpus. And we're asking for a rule of\ndecision in that cause of action, and the rule of\ndecision in this cause of action, just like mine, was\nin property. Is the decision -- the rule of decision\nis the rule written into the treaty, just like in the\nproperty case, and you cannot do anything that\ncontravenes it though, of course, you can argue about\nthe content of that rule of decision.\nMR. GARRE: In these -- in these two cases --\none you have on Federal habeas, one you had on direct\nappeal -- individuals are seeking to affirmatively\ninvoke rights that they claim that they can enforce\nunder the Vienna Convention, and we don't think that\nthe Vienna Convention confers those individual rights.\nIf -- if I could try to explain the -- the --\nwhat you referred to as a metaphysical question\nearlier. We agree that the Vienna Convention, as a\nself-executing treaty, is part of our Federal law.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But is there a difference\nbetween the rights that could be asserted by the consul\nor a consulate official and the rights that could be\nasserted by a criminal defendant?\nMR. GARRE: I don't think so, Justice Alito.\nThe -- the treaty has an enforcement mechanism, and\nthat's -- that's an important thing to keep in mind.\nThe -- the signatories to this treaty permitted for a\njudicial enforcement mechanism.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If the consulate official\nknew that a national of that country was being detained\nand wanted access to that person and that was being\ndenied by -- by the State officials, there would be no\nremedy in Federal court? The consulate -- the foreign\ncountry could not obtain -- could not get Federal\nenforcement of that right to get access?\nMR. GARRE: That's right, Justice Alito. The\nremedy would be the traditional remedy for enforcement\nof treaties, diplomatic repercussions, diplomatic\nprotests, and that happens all the time. That happens\nin this country where -- where consulates complain to\nthe United States State Department. It happens\noverseas where the State Department complains about the\ntreatment of American citizens. This -- this --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are there any\ncountries that recognize individually enforceable\nrights under this convention overseas on behalf of\nAmerican citizens?\nMR. GARRE: No, Your Honor, and what -- the\nPetitioners and their amici here are asking this Court\nto be the first court to recognize an individually\nenforceable right under this treaty.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What about that Australian\ncase that was mentioned, I believe one case where they\nsay --\nMR. GARRE: Well, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- evidence was excluded?\nThat would have been a --\nMR. GARRE: There -- there is Australian\nauthority going directly to the contrary. It's -- it's\nthe R. v. Abbrederis case which we cite, which -- which\nrecognizes that the article 36 is individually\nenforceable.\nThe -- the other cases that are referred to\nby some of Petitioners' amici are -- are addressed at\nlength in the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation amicus\nbrief. And they explain that in those situations,\nthere -- first of all, the cases are a little bit vague\nas to which provisions they're purporting to enforce.\nBut, second of all, there are domestic statutes which\nwe think that the correct reading of the cases is in\nthose cases they were giving effect to the domestic\nstatutes.\nThere's certainly no -- no unambiguous\nexample that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I imagine there's not --\nthere's some little authority both ways. To put it in\nmy perhaps -- I know you disagree with this way of\nthinking about it. But I'm -- I'm thinking about this\narticle 36 and thinking that you're reading it as if it\nsaid, inform the individual, but if you don't, he can't\ndo anything about it. And the other way is to read the\nsilence as if it said, inform the individual, but if\nyou don't, he can do something about it. We're not\nsaying what. Okay.\nNow, between those two interpretations, we\nhave the ICJ picking interpretation two and rejecting\ninterpretation one in, I grant you, a different case.\nBut I guess since a lot of these amicus briefs tell us\nthroughout history, a long history, we've tried to\nfollow ICJ interpretations of treaties to which we are\nparties. Why -- it's all up to us, but we've tried to.\nWhy -- why should we not, given the two possible\ninterpretations -- they choose one. Why should we not\nchoose to follow theirs here?\nMR. GARRE: Because, to be blunt, the ICJ\ndecision is wrong. This Court gives respectful\nconsideration to the decisions of the ICJ and other\ninternational tribunals, but it's certainly not bound\nby those decisions. This Court should look carefully\nto the text of the treaty itself, to the ratification\nhistory, to the consistent interpretation of the\nexecutive branch, and to implementing practice in other\nstates.\nAt best, they -- Petitioners and their amici\nhave suggested that there's some ambiguity in -- in two\nstates, Australia and Great Britain. There are more\nthan 160 contracting states to this -- to this treaty.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, then you're going back\nto putting weight on the absence of authority. In\nthose contracting states, most of which I guess are\ncivil system states, and in civil systems, you'll have\nmagistrates who do take this kind of thing into\naccount, but you won't find a case on it. So -- so --\nMR. GARRE: What you don't --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- are there authorities in\nthese other states to the contrary? I'm surprised if\nthere is.\nMR. GARRE: There are authorities that we've\ncited where courts have rejected the notion that\narticle 36 creates individually enforceable rights, in\nCanada and Australia, and there's a case in Germany\nwhere they refused to provide for a suppression remedy.\nSo there are authorities going the other way.\nThe manner in which this treaty is\nimplemented by the State Department overseas and by the\nState Department here is to provide for enforcement\nthrough the traditional means. This Court, as long\nback as the Head Money Cases, said that the traditional\n-- treaties are compacts between states. The\ntraditional means of enforcing those obligations is\nthrough diplomatic repercussions.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In your view, just as a\npractical matter, what we have here, how -- how should\nthe States enforce this obligation?\nMR. GARRE: Well, the States should enforce\nit generally by giving information to the detainee at\nthe point in time when they realize -- determine that\nhe's a foreign national. The State Department is\nengaged in extensive --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do they have any obligation\nto inquire whether he is? And -- and can you be more\nspecific? Should it happen --\nMR. GARRE: Generally --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- when you first give him\nthe Miranda warnings, or tell me how you think it\nshould work?\nMR. GARRE: Generally it happens during the\narrest process. If -- if, during the course of\nquestioning, they determine that a detainee or arrestee\nis a foreign national, then at that point in time,\ngenerally they would provide consular notification.\nThe State --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you think they have the\naffirmative obligation to ask him if he is a foreign\nnational?\nMR. GARRE: The State Department advises law\nenforcement officers at the Federal and State and local\nlevel that ordinarily they should make that\ndetermination.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If they don't -- if\nthey can't ask him -- I mean, I assume many foreign\nnationals are detained fairly close to the border, and\nif you start saying, well, my first question is, are\nyou a citizen or not, you've got to give Miranda\nwarnings first saying you don't have to answer any\nquestion that might incriminate you.\nMR. GARRE: That's right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's kind of a catch\n22.\nMR. GARRE: That's right, Mr. Chief Justice.\nAnd many foreign nationals are reluctant to provide\ninformation about their citizenship because they fear\nthat that could result in other legal jeopardy.\nImportantly, Justice Kennedy, article 36 is\nin no way an interrogation right. It has no connection\nto interrogation. The International Court of Justice\nin the Avena decision, at page -- at paragraph 87,\nspecifically made that point, that this was not related\nto interrogation. In many European countries,\ndetainees who are arrested not only can't have access\nto consular officials during questioning, they don't\neven have access to lawyers during questioning. So --\nso this --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I thought you\nindicated that you advise the States that they do have\nto advise him of this right during the booking process\nor the interrogation.\nMR. GARRE: Well, when they -- when they\nlearn that the person is a foreign national.\nOftentimes, that could happen -- that could happen\nduring questioning, although oftentimes it doesn't. It\ncould happen at booking. It could happen later in the\nprocess. That's what the State Department advises law\nenforcement officials.\nThe State Department has engaged in extensive\nefforts to ensure compliance with this treaty in order\nto abide by our international obligations. We -- we\nhave sent information to State and local law\nenforcement officers how to comply with this treaty.\nThere have been training videos. There have been cards\nsimilar to Miranda cards. More than 600,000 of those\ncards have been sent out to local officials, and -- and\nthe initial indications that we've received is that\nthese efforts are working. In fact, these indicate --\nthese efforts are -- are outlined in the Hardy\naffidavit, which is in volume II of the Counter\nMemorial and Avena decision, which we've offered to\nlodge with the Court.\nBut -- but we -- the feedback we've gotten is\nthat in some offices, they're being overwhelmed by\nnotifications. So the United States is seeking to\nabide by its treaty obligations. Those efforts are\nworking.\nThis --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Has it worked the other\nway around when a young American citizen is detained in\n-- in a jail someplace abroad, and has the United\nStates ever then -- what efforts have been made?\nMR. GARRE: Your Honor, the efforts that we\nundertake are diplomatic efforts. We do not go into\nforeign courts and assert or suggest that American\ncitizens should go into foreign courts and assert a\nright to individually enforce this treaty either\nthrough suppression or any of the other remedies that\nhave been suggested.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Has it worked anyplace?\nTake Mexico, Turkey, any country you'd like.\nMR. GARRE: Yes, Your Honor. In fact, during\nthe 1980's the United States complained to Mexico about\nthe fact that American citizens had not received\nconsular notification, and through the result of those\ndiplomatic discourses, they negotiated an -- a\nagreement whereby American citizens were brought back\nto the United States for custody. But significantly\nthere, the -- the United States didn't take the\nposition that those convictions were unlawful or could\nbe set aside under the Vienna Convention. They simply,\nthrough diplomatic discourse, the traditional means of\nenforcing a treaty, provided for the -- the transfer of\nthese citizens back to the United States to serve out\ntheir custody.\nThe -- the traditional rule in international\nlaw is that treaties don't create individually\nenforceable rights. Many treaties, by their terms, do\nexpressly contemplate private enforcement in domestic\ncourts. Look at article 28 of the Warsaw Convention.\nLook at article 2, subsection 3 of the International\nCovenant on Civil and Political Rights. These treaties\ndo expressly contemplate that theirs -- their\nprovisions will be individually enforceable in the\ndomestic courts. It would have been --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: When you say they -- they\ncontemplate it, how do they express that contemplation?\nI mean, are -- are there magic words that diplomats\nunderstand or -- or what?\nMR. GARRE: Your Honor, they refer to rights\nthat individuals can assert or should be able to assert\nin judicial courts, in the domestic courts.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But they -- they provide\nexpressly that these are rights that may be asserted\nindividually in national courts?\nMR. GARRE: There -- Your Honor, there are\nvarying degrees of specificity, but yes, they -- in\nsome cases they do provide for that explicitly.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But they -- they go beyond\nthe reference to rights as -- as in article 36.\nMR. GARRE: Yes. They -- they refer to\ndomestic enforcement.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Do they, in all those\nproperty cases, you know, from like the early part of\nthis republic where property law was determined in\naccordance with -- you know all those cases that are\ncited.\nMR. GARRE: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: In those treaties where the\ncourts then looked to the treaty to help decide who\nowned what property, they used it as a rule of\ndecision. Do those cases -- treaties all use the word\nindividually enforceable rights?\nMR. GARRE: They didn't, Your Honor, but\nthose treaties, as we explain in our brief, are dealing\nwith commercial relations, property rights, and -- and\nare almost entirely dealing with individuals and how\nthey should be treated in foreign states, are much more\namenable to a construction that they create\nindividually enforceable rights. And the Vienna\nConvention, which after all is a convention about the\nquintessential matter of interstate relations, consular\nfunctions between states -- we don't think that that\ntreaty can be interpreted to confer individually\nenforceable rights.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Where does this term come\nfrom as applied to a rule of decision? I mean, when\nsomebody is arguing that the treaty should apply a rule\nof decision in a case brought under some other cause of\naction, what's the best thing I could read? I'm not an\nexpert.\nMR. GARRE: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You say the way to think\nabout that --\nMR. GARRE: -- read --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- is the, quote,\nindividually enforceable rights.\nMR. GARRE: We would suggest read the treaty.\nIt's -- it's -- we agree with you that you get back to\nthe treaty and you have to make the determination that\nthe signatory states to the treaty intended for private\nenforcement in domestic courts.\nThe signatory states to this treaty provided\nfor a very limited judicial enforcement mechanism, only\ncontracting states that join the optional protocol and\nonly in the ICJ. It would have been an extraordinary\nthing for those contracting states that so carefully\nlimited that remedy to -- to subject themselves to suit\nin their own courts to any number of foreign nationals\nwho went abroad into their countries.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I -- I would agree\nthere, but we're not -- this -- this isn't a case about\nsubjecting them to suit.\nMR. GARRE: What you -- what you -- what\nthey're asking you to do, Your Honor, is to say that\nthis treaty is individually enforceable in our courts.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, yes, but -- but that\nis -- that's not equivalent to saying that it's -- it\nis subjecting the United States to suit.\nMR. GARRE: May I answer the question?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.\nMR. GARRE: It is, Your Honor, insofar as if\nyou think it in waiver of sovereign immunity terms. A\nstate may waive its sovereign immunities from some\ntypes of claims, but not other types of claims. And\nwhat they're claiming here is that these claims are\nenforceable, and we think that they are incorrect.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Stancil, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARK T. STANCIL\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER IN NO. 05-51\nMR. STANCIL: Thank you. I'd like to first\nbriefly address two points on behalf of Mr. Sanchez-\nLlamas.\nFirst, with -- with respect to him, the\nquestion is how to give full effect to the treaty in\nthe context of custodial interrogation, and his\nposition is that suppression is necessary to give full\neffect. And we need look no further than the fact that\nthe custodial -- that the remedies that are currently\nafforded in a context of custodial interrogation are\nineffective.\nAnd secondly, admitting evidence encourages\nviolations, and that's been the -- the result that's\nbeen a constant pattern and practice of violations.\nIf I could switch back to Mr. Bustillo's\ncase, and I'd like to address what Mr. Garre just said,\nwhich is that there's a presumption or that -- that\ntreaties don't create individually enforceable rights.\nEvery decision of this Court is unambiguously\nclear. Where you have a treaty that becomes part of\nthe domestic law -- here it is. Where that treaty\ncreates rights -- here the treaty says his rights. And\nthird and critically, where you have a cause of action\nto enforce those rights, it is judicially enforceable\nas a matter of domestic law. Regardless of the\ninternational dimension of the treaty, as a matter of\ndomestic law, it is enforceable.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it refers to his\nrights, to make it clear that the consular office does\nnot have the right to contact him in the situations\nwhere he would prefer not to be contacted by his\nconsul.\nMR. STANCIL: I disagree, Your Honor. If --\nif you look at the treaty's text, it says, you shall\nnotify the person affected of his rights. It's\nreferring to the foreign national specifically. And\ntwice more, article 36(2) talks about the rights that\nare created. These all flow directly to the foreign\nnational. He decides whether to exercise them. This\nis a classic rights-creating piece of -- it's not a --\nit's not a statute, but it's treated on par.\nAnd if you look at the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I thought you said the\nthird condition was creation of a cause of action.\nMR. STANCIL: Availability of a cause of\naction. Here --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where -- where is that in\nthis statute?\nMR. STANCIL: The Virginia habeas statute\nprovides a cause of action if you are held in violation\nof Federal law, and in Sanchez-Llamas, the cause of\naction is the criminal prosecution. That's what the\nCourt did in Rauscher where it allowed him to --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You meant the statute has to\ncreate a cause of action.\nMR. STANCIL: The cause of action, just like\n1983, allows --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, the -- the treaty\nhas to create a cause of action.\nMR. STANCIL: That's not correct. Just like\n1983 has to create a cause of action to vindicate\nFederal rights, here --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, 1983 is a good\nexample. If you have a -- a treaty between a State and\nthe Federal Government, a Spending Clause provision,\nthat says you've got to spend the money this way, give\ncertain rights to the individuals, we don't always\nautomatically hold that the individuals have\nenforceable rights even under 1983.\nMR. STANCIL: Not automatically, but if you\nhave a statute that said his rights and refers rights\nand makes it his obligation and his decision whether to\ninvoke them, it would be classic rights-creating.\nIf I --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It said his rights in\nGonzaga v. Doe, which dealt with the student privacy\nrights act, and we held -- and the -- we -- the Court\nheld that that was -- did not give rise to individually\nenforceable rights.\nMR. STANCIL: I would -- I would compare the\nlanguage of article 36(2) to any of the rights cases\nthis Court has decided.\nIf I could, in my remaining minute, describe\nwhy -- and this goes to the heart of what we were\ntalking about with the procedural bar. If the question\nis, as Justice Breyer put it, whether pushing these\nclaims to ineffective assistance is self-defeating, we\nhave ample evidence here that it is. The State says,\nwell, it may or may not be ineffective assistance. The\nState court said it wasn't ineffective assistance.\nThat's because trial counsel doesn't have unique\nexperience and knowledge necessary to make these\ndecisions. That's why the treaty expressly puts it in\nthe hands of the foreign national to make these\ndecisions, not the lawyer.\nAnd, with respect, if -- if -- the State has\nasserted that we haven't raised an ineffective\nassistance claim. We did -- we did recharacterize in\nthe Virginia Supreme Court, on pages -- page 203, note\n4 of the joint appendix, that if you wanted to flip all\nthis on its head, you could certainly -- you would\ncertainly have to conclude that he created -- that he\ncommitted ineffective assistance of counsel.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nStancil.\nMR. STANCIL: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The case is\nsubmitted.\n(Whereupon, at 11:30 a.m., the case in the\nabove-entitled matter was submitted.)\n"
