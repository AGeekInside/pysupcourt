        "content": "QUESTION: Mr. Smith?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT S. SMITH\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. SMITH: Mr. Chief Justice. May it please\nthe Court. I think my first task here is to show you that\nwhat the Texas Court did was contrary to or an\nunreasonable application of your previous decision in\nPenry in this case, and I believe that your decision in\nPenry or Penry One as we call it in our brief was fairly\nclear in saying that as to this man, a retarded man like\nthis with a life long history of really gruesome child\nabuse where virtually his whole case is based on the\nretardation and the horrible child abuse, that the three\nquestions of the old Texas statutory scheme just don't\nwork or at least they do not work unless you take the\nfirst question which asks whether the defendant acted\ndeliberately and give \"deliberately\" a definition.\nIt would have to be a rather unusual definition of\ndeliberately that will tell the jury, contrary to the\nnormal meaning of the word, that you can find that conduct\nresulting from child -- from retardation maybe even from\nchild abuse, although that's perhaps a stretch, could be a\nbasis for a finding that the defendant did not act\ndeliberately.\nWhen you summarized in Grand v Collins the Penry\nholding, you said and I'm quoting from page 474 of 506 US\nReports, you said that \"in Penry it was impossible to give\nmitigating effect to Penry's evidence by way of answering\nthe special issues. Grand says that without any\nqualification. I would assume that one qualification is\nappropriate because Penry does indicate that there is --\nthat the definition of deliberately was a possibility for\n--\nQUESTION: It was impossible there under the\ninstructions that were there given, but the instructions\nhere given made it very clear that if you considered the\nmental deficiency to be a mitigating factor you should\nanswer one of the three questions \"no\". In defense's\nclosing argument he said the following, I don't understand\nhow the jury could have misunderstood it. \"Let me try to\nsimplify it. If when you thought about mental retardation\nand the child abuse you think that this guy deserves a\nlife sentence and not a death sentence, decide life\nimprisonment is punishment enough then you've got to\nanswer one of those questions no. The judge has not told\nyou which question and you have to give that answer even\nif you decide the literally correct answer is yes. Not\nthe easiest instruction to follow and the law does funny\nthings sometimes but it is what it says and I've taken all\nthis time with you to make sure you understand what it\nsays.\" That's pretty clear to me.\nMR. SMITH: I think that's clear, Your Honor,\nindeed I said it and I thought I was being clear when I\nsaid it.\nQUESTION: I thought you were imminently clear.\nMR. SMITH: But I -- but I was not a judge,\nYour Honor, and there is no one of whom a jury is likely\nto be more skeptical in a situation like that than defense\ncounsel. I beg to differ with the suggestion that the\njudge made it clear, and I think it's the instruction that\nthe judge gives that has to be clear for starters. I\ndon't think you -- I don't think you can rely on defense\ncounsel or on the jury's acceptance of defense counsel's\ninterpretation. The instruction is at page --\nQUESTION: How about this sentence: if you\ndetermine when giving mitigating effect to the mitigating\nevidence, if any, that a life sentence as reflected by a\nnegative finding to the issue under consideration rather\nthan a death sentence is an appropriate response to the\npersonal culpability of the defendant, a negative finding\nshould be given to one of the special issues.\nMR. SMITH: I respectfully submit that's much\nless than clear, Your Honor, and becomes even less clear\nif you read the preceding sentence. The preceding\nsentence says \"if you find that there are any mitigating\ncircumstances in this case you must decide how much weight\nthey deserve, if any, and therefore give effect and\nconsideration to them in assessing defendant's personal\nculpability at the time you answer the special issue.\"\nQUESTION: Right, and then the next sentence\nexplains just what he means by giving, in assessing the\ndefendant's personal culpability. It says \"an appropriate\nresponse to the personal culpability a negative finding\nshould be given to one of the special issues.\" I really\n-- we assume the jury is -- even if the defendant is\nmentally deficient that the jury is not and that -- that\ninstruction seems clear enough to --\nMR. SMITH: I can only respectfully beg to\ndiffer, Your Honor, and in doing so I'll -- let me stress\na couple of phrases.\nGive effect and consideration to the mitigating\ncircumstances at the time you answer the special issue. I\nrespectfully submit to you that that is impossible. That\nis as if I said to this court would you please give effect\nand consideration to Estelle v. Smith at the time you\nresolve the Penry issue in this case.\nIf I said that I think I would get nothing but blank\nlooks because I think that is a meaningless statement, but\nit's identical.\nQUESTION: This is also the jury that you told\non I guess it was you doing the voir dire as well -\nMR. SMITH: No, it wasn't.\nQUESTION: Now this instruction that you got,\nthis is almost like a fourth issue in that you will hear\nthis other evidence that comes in about the defendant, you\nwill take that into consideration when you are answering\nthese three issues.\nMR. SMITH: That was a voir dire, that wasn't me\nactually Your Honor that was a voir dire back in March.\nQUESTION: That was pretty well done too I\nthought.\nMR. SMITH: Done by Joe Price, who's a very able\nman but he was doing it back in March and the jury didn't\ndeliberate until July. I know of no case where the court\nhas held that an improper instruction or even an ambiguous\ninstruction was clarified by voir dire questions asked\nfour months previously or by voir dire questions. I don't\nthink that works. The prosecutor did not, neither\nMr. Price nor his colleague, they did not say in their\nclosing argument, they did not reinforce what I had said\nto the jury. They did not differ from it, they did not\nreinforce it. They chose to remain silent and get\nwhatever benefit they could get out of what I think is an\nextraordinarily confusing situation.\nTo me the important fact was not the -- not defense\ncounsel's argument, but the jury one might expect would\npay somewhat more attention to the piece of paper that\nthey were handed to write their verdict on from the court\nwhich was identical 100 percent verbatim identical with\nthe piece of paper they were handed in Penry One and which\nsaid in it as part of the instructions as -- or actually\nas part of the verdict form, there's nothing about\nmitigating evidence on that piece of paper but there is\nsomething that says if you want to answer no, it has to be\nbecause there's a reasonable doubt as to I believe it's\nthe facts pertaining or the evidence pertaining to the\nspecial issue. In other words they had to find that there\nwas reasonable doubt as to whether the state had proved\n--\nQUESTION: Do we have the verdict form that\nyou're talking about? That would be helpful if we could\nlook at it\nMR. SMITH: You certainly do and I believe it's\nat 676 of the joint appendix. If that's not it, it's\nclose. Yes, that's where it is. The question is to --\nto vote no to any question the foreperson had to sign a\nstatement that said \"We the jury because at least ten\njurors have a reasonable doubt as to the matter inquired\nabout in this special issue find and determine that the\nanswer to this special issue is no. The matter inquired\nabout in this special issue had nothing to do with\nmitigating evidence. They were supposed to understand\nfrom what I submit with all due respect, Justice Scalia,\nis a very obscure instruction however lucidly explained by\na defense lawyer who they did not have to trust that a --\nthey had to understand that those words that I just read\ndid not mean what they said, and I think that that is not\nreasonable to ask of a jury.\nQUESTION: What is confusing about the\ninstruction \"If you determine when giving mitigating\neffect to the mitigating evidence, if any, that a life\nsentence as reflected by a negative finding to the issue\nunder consideration rather than a death sentence, is an\nappropriate response to the personal culpability of the\ndefendant, a negative finding should be given to one of\nthe special issues\"?\nMR. SMITH: Well, what is -- a number of things\nI think are confusing about it including the extraordinary\nfact that it doesn't give them any hint which one to pick,\nbut the words I would focus on are most strongly -\nQUESTION: If it had given them a hint as to\nwhich one to pick, you'd object to that, the fact is that\nwe all acknowledge as we held in Penry One, it doesn't\nnaturally come under any one of them so the judge's\ninstruction was the Supreme Court has said this mitigating\nevidence doesn't come under any one of the three, so in\neffect, as counsel said in the voir dire, I'm creating a\nfourth special issue and if you find mental incapacity,\nsay no to any one of the three and I think that's what\nthis sentence says.\nMR. SMITH: I submit it would have been\nsignificantly less confusing if they had indeed put a\nfourth question on the piece of paper Your Honor, but I\nalso want to call your attention in the instruction to the\nwords \"as reflected by a negative finding to the issue\nunder consideration\". I suggest to you that those words,\nif they have any meaning at all, if the possible defense\nof them is if they have no meaning at all, that's the best\nthat can be said for them, but if they have a meaning they\nmean that you cannot give effect to the mitigating\nevidence unless you can reflect it to -- I mean a\nnegative finding to the issue under consideration,\nwhatever that is.\nQUESTION: At any rate the verdict form that\nthey got gave them the three questions. It didn't contain\nthis fourth question?\nMR. SMITH: There was no fourth question.\nQUESTION: So if a jury is hearing fleetingly\nthis long instruction then gets a piece of paper with\nthree choices answer yes or no, maybe it's not so clear.\nMR. SMITH: I figure it was not so clear\nespecially if they do not necessarily take defense\ncounsel's word unsupported by the prosecutor --\nQUESTION: How would you have done it, Mr.\nSmith. Do you think the judge had authority to override\nthe Texas statute which only provided for these three\nquestions and simply invent a fourth of his own?\nMR. SMITH: I don't think he had authority. I\nthink you'd already done that for him Your Honor?\nQUESTION: Well, I don't think we created a\nfourth question under Texas statutory law. I think what\nwe said is that the mental incapacity has to be one of the\nfactors the jury is allowed to take into account and I\nthink it's a perfectly reasonable way for the judge to say\nfind no to one of the Texas special issues in the statute,\nif that's -- if that's what you -- what you think is the\ncase.\nMR. SMITH: I think it's fair to characterize\nwhat you did in Penry and Penry One, Justice Scalia, as\nholding the Texas statute unconstitutional as applied to\nPenry and when the statute is held unconstitutional of\ncourse the state court on retrial need not observe it.\nThere was the escape hatch that was one of giving a\ndefinition of the word deliberately. I have no idea, I\ncannot imagine why the trial court did not do that or why\nthe prosecution did not suggest that they do that, but\nthey didn't. That -- I admit that that's not without its\ndifficulties but the suggestion --\nQUESTION: Did you ask for that?\nMR. SMITH: Yes we did, Your Honor. We actually\nasked for two definitions of deliberately. There's one\nthat's in the appendix the joint appendix and I think I\nrealize in going over it I think maybe the better one is\nthe one that's not in the joint appendix. There are two\ndefinitions of deliberately; request for instruction\nnumber 11 which is not in the appendix but it's in volume\nthree of the record at 107172 is an attempt, and it's moot\nwhether it would have been successful, to use the jury\ninstruction to cure the Penry problem. We also -- we\nalso proposed several instructions that would -- well I\nthink one that would have given a fourth question, one\nthat would at least have said in plain English nullify,\ngive a false answer, you don't have to tell the truth in\nresponse to these questions. I think if the judge had\ndone that, I think he runs into problems under Roberts\nagainst Louisiana.\nQUESTION: I don't know whether he runs into\nproblems under Roberts, because what Roberts as I have\nread the opinion objects to is the capriciousness, the\nfact that the jury could act with no evidence at all. And\nhere the instruction is quite clear as to what sort of\nevidence the jury would act on.\nMR. SMITH: It is true that Roberts was --\ndepended in part on the capriciousness, but the thrust of\nRoberts I think is that it's intolerable to tell the jury\nto disregard what they are being told to do.\nQUESTION: Roberts had a reason and the reason\nthat Roberts gave why it was intolerable was that the jury\nwas just invited on no evidence whatever to move the\noffense downward which would have been the exact thing\nthat Furman objected to.\nMR. SMITH: As I understand what the state was\ncontending in Roberts is not that dissimilar from what the\nstate is contending here. The state was saying sure we\ncould give effect to mitigating evidence. We have all\nthese proposed verdicts and we tell them that they can\nrender a false one if they want to. That's exactly what\nthe state's arguing. That's what they propose to do here.\nQUESTION: The state is arguing that you can\nrespond to evidence which you believe in this particular\nway. It isn't saying just, you know, if you feel like --\nif you just feel generally this guy shouldn't get the\ndeath sentence go ahead and find another verdict\nMR. SMITH: Well it -- in Roberts as I\nunderstand the argument that was rejected in Roberts, no\none was -- no one was saying oh, there's no problem with\nthe statute because the jury can do whatever it wants.\nThey were saying yes we can give individualized\nconsideration to individual offenders. We do it in this\nperhaps rather unusual way by having the jury give false\nanswers. And the Court said that's not an acceptable way\nof doing it. That's my reading of Roberts.\nQUESTION: In any case you didn't get that\nalternative instruction so we don't get into Roberts,\nright?\nMR. SMITH: That's right. I don't think we got a\nnullification instruction. I'm not sure what position my\nadversaries are going to take. I've read their brief and\nI don't know what their position is on whether we got that\ninstruction. The --\nQUESTION: Mr. Smith, you mentioned one\ninstruction you proposed that's in the record but not the\njoint appendix. Was there another one that's in the joint\nappendix?\nMR. SMITH: Yes, and it is -- it is in the\njoint appendix and it is cited in my brief, I do not have\nthe -- I can find it pretty quickly. I think I can. If\nnot I will defer Your Honor's - it's in the third volume\nof the appendix. It is at page 669, and I would say Your\nHonor that -- if the question is whether that particular\ninstruction would have cured the Penry error, I would have\nto answer no. That one would not have. I think the other\none we proposed might or might not have. It's moot\nbecause we didn't get any of them. If the question is\nwhether we proposed things that would have cured the Penry\nerror, it's very clear the answer is yes. We did it this\nway, we did it the other way, we did it -- there are\nplenty of proposed instructions that we think could have\ncomplied with Penry. The court gave none of them.\nQUESTION: Was the so-called Penry instruction\non paper at the time of this resentencing hearing, the law\nthat is in effect in Texas now?\nMR. SMITH: No, no, was it on paper? It\ncertainly had not been enacted and as far as I know did\nnot exist, Your Honor?\nQUESTION: What happens if we find for you in\nthis case? It goes back. Would this case, if the state\nwishes to do so be resubmitted to a jury under the new\nstatute?\nMR. SMITH: Under the new statute, yes.\nQUESTION: And is that okay? Is that\nconstitutional?\nMR. SMITH: I think so, Your Honor. I am not\nabove trying to think of a way to --\nQUESTION: You haven't thought of one yet\nthough.\nMR. SMITH: I don't think I have -- I don't\nthink I --\nQUESTION: No, no, You don't have to commit\nyourself, but that's presumably what would happen or what\nthe state would try to make happen.\nMR. SMITH: Yes, yes and I would -- while I\nmight not give it up, I would have a tough time saying\nthat Penry was not complied with under the new Texas\nprocedure.\nQUESTION: Did the judge say it was simply\nbeyond his authority to alter these three special issues?\nMR. SMITH: He did not say that. One can infer\nthat's what he believed Your Honor. He did not say\nanything.\nQUESTION: I'm not sure what the judge is\nsupposed to do if this court says one thing and the\nlegislature says the other. Obviously, he can't ignore the\nmandate of this Court. On the other hand I don't know if\nhe can just hold the matter in abeyance. Was there any\nsuggestion that there be a delay in these proceedings\nwhile the legislature got its act together?\nMR. SMITH: I'm not aware of such a suggestion,\nJustice Kennedy. I do submit respectfully the answer to\nyour previous question is clear enough although it's\nunfortunate when a judge is sitting with the United States\nSupreme Court saying one thing and the Texas legislature\nsaying another. The Court wins. He has to follow what\nthis Court says.\nQUESTION: In the sense that the instructions as\ndrafted, as legislated, cannot be given, I'm not sure if\nhe has the further authority to go ahead and invent\nadditional instructions under Texas law. I just don't\nknow.\nMR. SMITH: I guess I would answer by saying if\nthe Texas statute has been held unconstitutional as\napplied then it's perfectly appropriate for a Texas judge\nnot to implement it. I see nothing wrong with that.\nLet me try to talk briefly about my second task, if I\ncan,\nwhich is to show that the -- this Peebles psychiatric\nreport was contrary to or an unreasonable application of\nthis Court's decision in Estelle v Smith. Based on the\nbriefs I think that issue is going to boil down to whether\nthe Peebles report was the sort of rebuttal that is\npermitted under Buchanan against Kentucky. I think it is\nquite clear that it is not. The Peebles report which is\nat page 60 of the joint appendix served one function in\nthis case for the prosecution and that was to introduce\none sentence which says it is -- \"it is my further\nprofessional opinion that if Johnny Paul Penry were\nreleased from custody that he would be dangerous to other\npersons\". That is the heart of that -- that statement is\nsummarizes perfectly what the state was trying to prove on\nits affirmative case of future dangerousness. On that\nissue the defendant produced no mental status evidence, no\npsychiatric evidence and there was no occasion for\nrebuttal. They didn't rebut anything we said.\nThat is, no -- no court below by the way found that\nit was rebuttal. The theories of the courts below are so\nweak that as I read my adversary's briefs they do not\ndefend the theories of the courts below. The state does\nand its allied amici do at some length argue harmless\nerror. I do not see how you can think an error was\nharmless or the admission of a piece of evidence was\nharmless when you look at what the prosecution did with\nthat piece of evidence, and that is at page 7 of our\nbrief. This is the last page, the last paragraph of the\nprosecution's rebuttal summation. This is the climax,\nthis is what he saved to have ringing in the jury's ears\nwhen they went out to deliberate. \"He was examined by\nDoctor Felix Peebles who found that he was sane. He knew\nthe difference between right and wrong and he was\ncompetent to stand trial.\" But Doctor Peebles went on and\nmade an additional finding that was really out of the\nordinary and I have never seen this in any kind of a\nreport. I'm quoting the prosecutor, closing out. He just\nadded it, he said that \"it is my further professional\nopinion that if Johnny Paul Penry were released from\ncustody that he would be dangerous to other persons\". The\nquestion of course comes why -- why did the state love\nthat report so much? They say and they're right the\ndangerousness was not a tough issue for them, but I think\nthe Curt must remember that the jury wasn't just answering\nyes or no to the second issue. Under your decision in\nPenry the jury had to take into account had to weigh the\nmitigating evidence against the perfectly horrible and\nvery real evidence of man's dangerousness. And I submit\nto you that it was a very tough and very close case\nbecause the --\nQUESTION: Close case, on which issue?\nMR. SMITH: It was a close case on how you come\nout at the end when you consider that there's a ton of\nmitigating evidence and also very serious evidence of\ndangerousness.\nQUESTION: Well, but of course the evidence of\ndangerousness is perhaps more precise than the mitigating\nevidence. The jury doesn't have to credit any particular\nevidence even though it believes the witness, it doesn't\nhave to believe that that is mitigating\nMR. SMITH: It doesn't have to Your Honor, I do\nnot -- I can only refer Your Honor to the record on this.\nThe record of the mental retardation and the child abuse\nis as appalling as you could want. If you browse through\nabout pages 139 to 219 of the record which is the\ntestimony on the child abuse, it is the most painful\nreading you'll ever -- you'll ever have in your life.\nThis was first of all it's a retarded man but it's a\nretarded child whose mother beat him physically, abused\nhim verbally, humiliated him in the most revolting ways.\nQUESTION: But you don't weigh future\ndangerousness against that as you put it. They are two\nseparate issues. That goes to the issue of personal\nculpability.\nMR. SMITH: Yes.\nQUESTION: And future dangerousness is a totally\ndifferent issue. You don't weigh the one against the\nother. I don't see how anything you said with regard to\nhis dangerousness would affect the jury's determination\nregarding how culpable he was.\nMR. SMITH: I beg to differ. Of course it would\nnot affect the jury's determination of how culpable he was\nbut the jury had the power to decide I don't care how much\nabuse he had and how much retardation he had. I don't feel\nsafe with this man still alive. They had the power to\nmake that decision. That's the decision the prosecutor\nwas asking them to make. That's why dangerousness was the\nprosecutor's big point and the Peebles report was the\nprosecutor's big exhibit. If you read the prosecutor's\nsummation he clearly thought --\nQUESTION: But there was other evidence of\nfuture dangerousness.\nMR. SMITH: There was indeed but this was the\none he liked best.\nQUESTION: Well, the fact that the counsel may\nhave used this in his summation doesn't really go to the\nharmless error question, if there's a whole lot of other\nevidence as to future dangerousness.\nMR. SMITH: I think it does, Your Honor, because\nI do think it was important not just whether the jury\nthought he was dangerousness -- dangerous but whether --\nbut how disturbed the jury was by the dangerousness. I\nthink the degree of dangerousness and the impact it had\nwas terribly important at the trial.\nQUESTION: One sentence?\nMR. SMITH: One -- one sentence which - it is a\nsentence which as the prosecutor points out appears to\nhave been stuck in there by this professional, this\nuncross-examined professional with no axe to grind who\nfrom reading the report you would think he took one look\nat the man and said this man is so dangerous I've got to\nvolunteer it to the court. I don't know if that's what\nreally happened but that's what the prosecutor suggested\nto the jury.\nQUESTION: But I still don't see how that means\nthat this one sentence is so controlling that all the\nother evidence of future dangerousness can't be looked at\nto decide whether it was harmless error.\nMR. SMITH: I'm not saying it can't be looked at\nbut I think to decide whether it's harmless you have to\nsay how different is the case without it, different enough\nthat the prosecutor would not have had this key point.\nQUESTION: Maybe it wasn't an Estelle v Smith\nviolation at all. I mean I don't know -- I'm not sure\nyou get into harmless error. Maybe it wasn't error.\nMR. SMITH: Well we think it was Your Honor. I\nthink the argument the main argument against that it\nwasn't Estelle error is Buchanan against Kentucky and I've\ntried to show this certainly wasn't rebuttal, they weren't\nrebutting anything. There are other theories and I think\nthey're very very very tenuous indeed it's not even clear\nfrom my adversary's briefs that they believe. If I may,\nI'll reserve the balance of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well Mr. Smith. Mr. Taylor\nwe'll hear from you\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDY TAYLOR\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. TAYLOR: Mr. Chief Justice and may it please\nthe Court. Unlike Penry One, where no instruction was\ngiven this case involves an instruction that was not only\ngiven but said in its express words that this jury could\ngive effect to a moral determination of this man's\npersonal culpability such that if they felt despite\nliteral answers to the three questions that Texas submits\nthat a life choice instead of death was the appropriate\nreasoned moral response, then answer one or more of those\nquestions no.\nQUESTION: Even though literally they should\nanswer yes. I mean that's such an odd posture in a sense\nit's very awkward to say the least.\nMR. TAYLOR: We submit that it is not awkward\nbecause of the actual words contained in the instruction\nas Justice Scalia read out loud in that particular\ninstruction that was given, and I might add, Justice\nGinsburg, that instruction was attached to the three\nsubmission charge that went back in the jury room. It\nwasn't something that was said verbally and never seen\nagain in writing but once that instruction was put\ntogether, it made clear that to give a vehicle to this\njury to choose life instead of death it could answer no\neven if they felt that it would be a literally an answer\nof yes.\nQUESTION: The last colloquy we just had with\npetitioner's counsel was to the effect that really\nevidence of child abuse and so forth doesn't relate to\nfuture dangerousness\nMR. TAYLOR: I think that was the point of Penry\nOne --\nQUESTION: And that's our whole concern here.\nMR. TAYLOR: I agree and what you taught us Your\nHonor in Sapple is that while we must channel and limit\nthe discretion that a sentencing jury has in finding out\nif a defendant is eligible for the death penalty, it is\nnot unconstitutional to shape and to structure that jury's\nconsideration of all of the evidence so that they can make\na life choice.\nQUESTION: Isn't the difficulty in this case\nthat what you describe as the structure is in effect an\ninstruction that says you may act irrationally and as\nagainst that possibility there were at least two avenues\nopen to the court that would have allowed the jury to do\njust what Penry One required and to do it in a rational\nway? One way would have been to add a fourth question and\nsay \"even though you answer yes to one, two and three you\nalso have a responsibility to consider mitigating evidence\nand if you do so, you may in fact answer this fourth\nquestion\" however it might be structured \"in a way that\nsays don't impose the death penalty any way\".\nA second rational way to do it -- I don't how easy it\nwould have been but I assume it could have been done,\nwould have been with a definition of deliberately and the\nquestion the second question I guess, which instructed the\njury that a person of some degree of retardation simply\ndoes not -- is not capable of the mental process that\n\"deliberately\" assumes or requires. So what it boils down\nto is the state had at least two ways in which Penry could\nrationally have been given consideration, and instead the\ncourt decided to do it in an irrational way saying even if\nall the evidence leads to a yes answer, you can say no any\nway, and that's to me the nub of the problem here because\nif as we have repeatedly said the jury is supposed to\nengage in some kind of a reasoned moral process, this was\nnot a reasoned moral process; it was an irrational\nprocess. What's your response to that?\nMR. TAYLOR: Any of those three would be\nconstitutional. This Court has never told the state of\nTexas that in structuring and shaping the jury's\nconsideration of all of the relevant consideration of\nevidence including mitigating evidence, it must choose a\nparticular way to --\nQUESTION: No, but it has -- this is the point\nof my question, it has repeatedly told everybody that the\nprocess of arriving at a determination or a choice between\nlife and death is supposed to be a reasoned moral process\nand it seems to me by definition inconsistent with that\nstandard to say that it suffices to tell the jury that you\nmay behave in a totally irrational way.\nMR. TAYLOR: We think that it was a reasonable\nchoice and certainly a reasonable application under the\nEdpa standard for this trial judge to pick an instruction\nas opposed to a fourth question. First, Penry One tells\nus to use an instruction. It doesn't tell us to use a\nquestion. Second the submission that state law allowed at\nthat time asked for three questions, not four. There was\nno appellate decision in Texas suggesting that a fourth\nquestion was appropriate.\nQUESTION: You don't concede, do you, that\ngiving a negative response to any -- to all of the three\nquestions on the basis of the mental incapacity of the\ndefendant would have been irrational? That is to say even\nthough a deliberateless -- deliberateness instruction was\nnot given, you don't concede that it would have been\nirrational for the jury to find that since this defendant\ndid not have adequate mental capacity, he did not act with\nthe requisite deliberateness?\nMR. TAYLOR: We do not concede that point,\nJustice Scalia.?\nQUESTION: You don't think that's irrational?\nMR. TAYLOR: We do not.\nQUESTION: What we said in Penry One was that\nthat is not necessarily clear to the jury, but we didn't\nsay that it was irrational.\nMR. TAYLOR: That is correct, Your Honor, and I\nmight add - -\nQUESTION: We did say in Penry One that it was\nan inadequate alternative, didn't we? That's why the case\nwent back.\nMR. TAYLOR: In Penry One although it was not\nclearly established under the Edpa standard that confronts\nthis Court, the Court did say that there was no\ninstruction on mitigating or rather on deliberateness so\nthe Court --\nQUESTION: In other words in the absence of a\ndeliberateness instruction different from the one given in\nPenry One, the Penry instructions were not adequate.\nThat's what Penry held, didn't it?\nMR. TAYLOR: We respectfully disagree.\nQUESTION: You don't think it held that?\nMR. TAYLOR: We do not. What Penry One taught\nus is that --\nQUESTION: Then the irrationality apparently\nstarted with this Court.\nMR. TAYLOR: What Penry One taught us --\nQUESTION: Why did we reverse the case?\nMR. TAYLOR: It's not been reversed but Sapple\nand Buchanan and other cases teach us that there must be\nan instruction. Once you get an instruction then we go\nthrough a Boyd analysis of whether or not the instruction\ngot the job done. The instruction that you referenced on\ndeliberateness that defense counsel requested is in your\njoint appendix volume three page 669, and in that\ninstruction there is not one reference made to mitigating\nevidence. That couldn't have got the job done. It was a\nreasonable decision on the part of the Texas courts.\nQUESTION: I think counsel said this was one of\nvarious ones he had been -- you're not holding him simply\nto this instruction.\nMR. TAYLOR: No, we are not, Your Honor, but the\npoint is --\nQUESTION: His point is this just shows how hard\nit is to do.\nMR. TAYLOR: Well the point that we're making is\nthat in order for an instruction on deliberateness to work\nunder Penry One and the cases thereafter, it would have to\ndirect the jury's attention to the mitigating evidence.\nThat instruction doesn't get it done. What instruction\nwas given specifically tells them that they have the power\nto answer no instead of yes and I might add under Boyd\nthat case taught us that in determining if the instruction\nwas erroneous or ambiguous that we look at the totality of\nthe circumstances. We don't parse and make --\nQUESTION: Mr. Taylor, can I just ask you one\nquestion. It seems to me that one things that cuts across\nall the instructions are the special issues that were\ngiven to the jury at the very end and with respect to each\nof the three special issues, the jury was said in order to\nsay no to that, we the jury because at least ten jurors\nhave a reasonable doubt as to the matter inquired into in\nthis special issue find and determine that the answer --\nissue is no. Now how could any -- how could the\nforeperson sign a negative answer to a special issue\nunless there were several jurors who said I don't think\nthe facts support it?\nMR. TAYLOR: Because the instruction told them\nto. The instruction specifically says if you determine\nwhen giving mitigating effect to the mitigating evidence\nif any that a life sentence as reflected by a negative\nfinding as to the issue under consideration rather than a\ndeath sentence - -\nQUESTION: That's flatly inconsistent with the\ncommand in the special issue that because at least ten\njurors have a reasonable doubt we must answer no.\nMR. TAYLOR: We submit that it is not flatly\ninconsistent. In fact it is entirely consistent because\nwhat you taught us in Boyd is that you must look at all of\nthe charge, not only a certain section to answer the\nquestion --\nQUESTION: Mr. Taylor, you said before that the\ninstruction, the so-called fourth instruction, accompanied\nthe jury into the jury room together with the three\nspecial issues. Physically what did the jury have? They\nhad on a piece of paper the three questions and then where\ndid the fourth issue show up?\nMR. TAYLOR: The charge and the accompanying\ninstructions is found in volume three of the joint\nappendix beginning at page 672, Justice Ginsburg, and that\ncharge does a couple of things. It not only tells the jury\nto take into consideration all of the evidence but it goes\nfurther and it tells them that they should look at all of\nthe mitigating circumstances and including in that look at\nthe defendant's character, record, circumstances of the\ncrime, and then they have to look at a broader principle\nand that is what is this defendant's personal culpability\nnot limiting it to only the question of deliberateness or\nfuture dangerousness or provocation --\nQUESTION: Was all this presented so that each\njury would understand from what the juror took into the\njury room that these were to work together? Did they have\nthis special issues on one page? You said something in\nthe beginning about --\nMR. TAYLOR: It's stapled together, Your Honor.\nThis is an actual copy of what went back to the jury room\nand it's stapled on the front. They would have to had\nread it and of course it was read aloud to them during the\ntrial. This was a six week voir dire.\nQUESTION: Suppose I thought just going back to\nyour instruction which as you read it properly \"if you\ndetermine when giving effect to the mitigating evidence,\nif any, that a life sentence as reflected by a negative\nfinding to the issue under consideration is appropriate\",\nso what should I do as a juror if I thought that a life\nsentence is appropriate because of the abused childhood\nand the mental retardation, but I didn't think a life\nsentence as reflected by a negative answer to these\nquestions was appropriate, what am I supposed to do?\nMR. TAYLOR: You must follow your oath. The\noath includes the instruction and under that circumstance\nmorally if you believe life instead of death is the right\nanswer, you answer no.\nQUESTION: No, I didn't ask it clearly. Suppose\nI believe a life sentence is appropriate but I don't\nbelieve a life sentence as reflected by a negative answer\nto a finding to the issue under consideration; I don't\nbelieve it is appropriate as reflected by deliberation; I\ndon't believe it is appropriate as reflected by lack of\ndangerousness. I believe it is appropriate for a totally\ndifferent reason that is nowhere reflected in the issue\nunder consideration then what am I supposed to do? It\nseems to me that this instruction is silent as to that\nmatter.\nMR. TAYLOR: You were told under those\ncircumstances to answer no. Not only does the instruction\nsay that. The trial court during voir dire said that and\nI quote. This is from the record and it's volume 27. The\ntrial court is telling one of the members of the voir dire\npanel that was eventually chosen question okay, \"and do\nyou see from reading this instruction that if based on all\nthe evidence you heard in this trial if you felt that\nthese questions should be answered yes beyond a reasonable\ndoubt\" --\nQUESTION: Suppose I accept that I know that I\nthink we know that particular statement - -\nQUESTION: Can I hear the rest of it?\nMR. TAYLOR: \"But you still felt that there was\nmitigating evidence that had been presented to you that\nwas sufficient for you to feel that in this case the death\nsentence was not appropriate and a life sentence was more\nappropriate, then you could answer one or more of the\nquestions no to effect a life sentence. Do you understand\nthat?\" The answer was yes. On pages 18 and 19 of our\nbrief, the red brief, we cite voir dire references for\nevery single one of those jurors that made it in the case.\nIt was a six week voir dire on average over two hours was\nspent going over one thing and that was this instruction.\nThis instruction was in writing and showed to the panel\nduring voir dire. And what we learned --\nQUESTION: You say a statement similar to that\nwas made to each one of the jurors during the voir dire?\nMR. TAYLOR: Statements by the prosecutor were\nmade in each and every instance. Statements by the court\nwere made in some instances. Statements by defense\ncounsel were made in each instance and so --\nQUESTION: When you say this instruction, you\nmean the instruction that is set forth as well on page 5\nof the blue brief: \"if you find there any mitigating\ncircumstances in this case\" or was it just the three\nspecial issues?\nMR. TAYLOR: It was the instruction, the actual\ninstruction --\nQUESTION: The instruction that's set forth on\npage 5 was read to them in voir dire?\nMR. TAYLOR: I don't have the blue brief handy.\nQUESTION: Well, it's the one we're focusing on.\n\"If you find there any mitigating circumstances in this\ncase\" et cetera.\nMR. TAYLOR: Yes. The only difference, Your\nHonor, between the instruction during voir dire and the\ninstruction that went back with the jury is that the\ninstruction in voir dire said that special issue and what\nour opponent described as a slight improvement to the\ncharge ultimately it said \"one or more of the special\nissues\". That's the only nuance that's different.\nQUESTION: Now the Texas court of criminal\nappeals found that the supplemental instruction was a\nnullification instruction. Are we bound by that\ndetermination?\nMR. TAYLOR: We think not. Nullification to the\nextent that we're talking about Roberts versus Louisiana\nis a situation where a juror is tempted and invited by the\ncharge to breach their oath. Here the juror was not\ntempted to breach their oath was admonished to follow\ntheir oath. Now it's true that the lower courts and the\nhigh court in Texas referred to it as a nullification\ncharge but there's that key distinction because they're\nfollowing their oath and doing exactly what you told us in\nthe opinion you authored for this court in Penry One. As\nto the --\nQUESTION: Is that a matter of Texas law? Did\nthey look at it from that perspective and say as a matter\nof Texas law it was a nullification?\nMR. TAYLOR: Well as a matter of Texas law they\ndid use the word nullification but in a proper way.\nThat's not a bad word under Texas law. That is a good\nword because if it's a nullification instruction, the high\ncourt in Texas, the Court of Criminal Appeals, has told us\nthat complies rather than violates Roberts and complies\nand rather than violating Penry.\nAs my time draws near I'd like to focus on the\nEstelle claim that was made in this case.\nQUESTION: Counsel, Your time is far off still.\nMR. TAYLOR: Under the Estelle claim what was\nclearly established and remembering of course that we're\non federal habeas review, Edpa standard applies, what was\nclearly demonstrated in Estelle, two things, first that\nrequest for an examination of the defendant was not made\nby the defendant or his counsel but rather was ordered by\nthe Court. Second, in Estelle we learned that there was\nno attempt at all to introduce the mind-set or the\npsychiatric evidence in that case, and so it was a\nreasonable application of Estelle for the Court of\nCriminal Appeals in Texas to rule that Estelle was\ndistinguishable and not clearly applicable to this case.\nIn this case not only are we dealing with a request\nby defense counsel, we're also dealing with offensive use\nof psychiatric evidence by defense counsel. You'll note\nin the record when Dr. Price, their expert witness on\nmental retardation and child abuse and its effects, he\ntestified that he relied on the Doctor Peebles report.\nThat's a choice the defense made, not a choice that the\nprosecution made.\nQUESTION: Mr. Taylor, what I don't understand\nabout this is I don't understand what evidence that Penry\nsubmitted that statement by Doctor Peebles rebutted.\nMR. TAYLOR: Of course, we contend that Estelle\nis not applicable but if you believe that Buchanan applies\nand the only way that we can win is to argue that it's\nsolely and exclusively rebuttal, the answer to that\nquestion that demonstrates why we still prevail and why\nthe court below was correct is that in the Peebles Report\nthere is a statement made that the reason that this\ngentleman doesn't learn from his mistakes is not because\nof mental retardation, not because of child abuse but\nrather because he is a psychotic individual.\nHe has an anti-social personality disorder. He's a\npsychopath and so therefore it's very important in\ndetermining personal culpability and whether he should get\ndeath instead of life to be able to demonstrate from the\nprosecution's point of view this man is not any less\nculpable because his violent behavior, his future\ndangerousness is not the result of mental retardation.\nIt's the result of the fact that he's a psychopath and\ntherefore he is not any less culpable than any one else\nabsent such evidence of mitigating circumstances. And\nJustice Ginsburg, it is for that reason that we still\nprevail even if you believe that under Buchanan and its\nrebuttal exception that is all that we have here.\nQUESTION: This part of your argument it seems\nto me contradicts your first. You're saying the jury\ncan't really consider mitigating circumstances because\nwe're talking about dangerousness. That's exactly the\nopposite of what you're saying in the first part of your\nargument.\nMR. TAYLOR: Well the first part of our argument\nwe're saying is Estelle doesn't apply on its facts, that\nas to the Buchanan exception, we're suggesting and the\nquestion I believe was what part of the report would be\nrebuttal to what they were saying in the punishment phase,\nwhat Dr. Price was saying is that I'm not focusing on the\nfuture dangerousness part but what Dr. Price was saying is\nwe don't think he's culpable and the reason we don't think\nhe's culpable is because he can't control himself, he\ncan't learn from his mistakes, but that --\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Taylor.\nMr. Schaerr we'll hear from you\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GENE C. SCHAERR\nON BEHALF OF ALABAMA, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT\nMR. SCHAERR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court, despite the lip service that the\npetitioner pays to Edpa, the fundamental flaw in both of\nhis claims is that they ignore the statute's threshold\nrequirement and that is that the principal of federal law\non which he relies be clearly established in this Court's\ndecisions and not just arguably established.\nLet's take first his challenge to the jury\ninstruction, the first question to ask of course is what\nprinciple did this court's Penry jurisprudence clearly\nestablish as opposed to arguably establish when the state\ncourts made their decisions below. I submit that what\nPenry clearly established is summarized at page 328 of the\nPenry opinion in which the court said that a defendant is\nentitled to instructions informing the jury that it can\nconsider and give effect to the mitigating evidence by\ndeclining to impose the death penalty.\nThis is how the Penry One holding was characterized\nin subsequent opinions of this Court including Graham and\nSapple and others, and it's true that Penry One discussed\nsome of the ways that Texas might comply with this\nprinciple but it did not clearly establish that these\nadditional instructions either had to include a separate\nspecial issue or had to expressly tell the jury that it\ncould answer no to a special issue even if the literal\nanswer was yes or that it had to expressly define\ndeliberately. The Court I submit did not attempt to micro\nmanage Texas procedure in any of those ways and in fact as\nlater opinions pointed out it could not have done so\nwithout creating a new rule under Teague.\nIndeed the term after Penry One both Boyd and Sapple\nmade crystal clear that Penry One had left intact the\nstate's freedom to structure and shape the jury's\nconsideration of mitigating evidence.\nQUESTION: You would agree I take it that we\nwould -- we were not required in order to establish a\nclear standard we were not required in Penry One to say\nthe instructions have got to call for a rational process,\nthe instructions have got to call for a process that\nreasonable jurors could at least intellectually follow,\n-- that if we found a deficiency on such points as that\nthat you would not feel that Edpa stood in the way of\ngranting relief here.\nMR. SCHAERR: Well the application of Penry One\nwould have to not only be incorrect or less than perfect,\nit would have to be unreasonable under this Court's\nanalysis in Williams versus Taylor, and let me address\nthat question now if I might.\nQUESTION: I want to make sure we're together at\nleast on one point. When we say that instructions are\ninadequate and it has to go back for better instructions,\nI take it it's not your position that Edpa would require\nus to say something like and the instructions have got to\nbe clear, they've got to be rational, they've got to be\ninstructions that juries can follow. I take it you would\nagree that at least those requirements are implicit and\nclearly implicit in what we hold when we say the first\ninstructions are inadequate. Do you agree?\nMR. SCHAERR: I think that's right and I think\nthese instructions complied with those requirements at\nleast to the extent that a reasonable jurist could\nconclude that they did comply. It seems to me the only\nreal question under Edpa with regard to the jury\ninstruction is whether that instruction was a reasonable\napplication of this court's Penry jurisprudence.\nQUESTION: If the answer is no, I wonder what\nhappens to -- it seems to me your position has\nconsiderable implication for the authority of this Court\nin criminal cases. We issue mandates and you're saying\nthat those mandates could be ignored by a state as long as\nthe way in which the state ignores the mandate commends\nitself to some reasonable juror -- reasonable lawyer\nrather though most reasonable lawyers decide the contrary,\nis that what you're thinking?\nMR. SCHAERR: Not at all, Justice Breyer.\nObviously the state has to comply with the Court's\nmandate. The question is did they do so in a reasonable\nway, and I think --\nQUESTION: What about that though? I mean I'm\nnot asking it argumentively. I'm trying to follow through\non the implication. We have a mandate, we issue it to a\nstate, now in your view they -- they do what two or three\nlawyers might think was reasonable but 97 wouldn't and so\nwhat are we supposed to do?\nMR. SCHAERR: Certainly the Court held in\nWilliams versus Taylor that it's not enough to have one\njurist that might conclude that it was reasonable.\nQUESTION: All right then however -- you see\nwhat I'm getting at. I'm worried about the implications\nthere for the compliance by a state with a mandate of the\nSupreme Court and that's what I'd like you to think\nthrough for me.\nMR. SCHAERR: Sure and I agree. They have to do\nit in a reasonable way but I can't -- I don't think it's\npossible to draw a line and say if 70 percent of --\nQUESTION: I don't think we know either. We\nhaven't stated a number seven, 18, 32 we don't know\neither.\nQUESTION: Mr. Schaerr we did say in a case that\ncame down rather recently in the Sapple case that South\nCarolina just didn't get it, it didn't pay attention to\nour decision in Simmons. This case has something of the\nsame feel to it.\nMR. SCHAERR: Well I -- with all respect\nJustice Ginsburg, I don't think that's true. In fact in\nthis case to me the key distinguishing factor between this\ncase and Penry One is that here unlike Penry One, the\ntrial court actually gave a very extended instruction on\nthe subject of mitigating evidence as Mr. Taylor has\ndiscussed earlier. That was instruction number four and\nthere was no corresponding instruction given in Penry One\nand so the only question -- so clearly this case is\ndistinguishable from that and clearly the lower courts at\nleast attempted to apply this Court's precedent in Penry\nOne. Whether they did so reasonably is the real question\nof the day and I think on that point it's significant\nalthough not dispositive that of the ten state judges and\nthe four federal judges who address this issue on the\nmerits, not one of them concluded that the instruction was\nan unreasonable application of Penry One.\nThere was one judge in the Fifth Circuit who\nconcluded that it was incorrect but again under Williams\nversus Taylor it's not enough that the application be\nincorrect and especially not less than perfect. And so\neven if it would have been better to add a fourth special\nissue, that doesn't make the Texas decision unreasonable\nespecially in light of Boyd and Sapple which say that the\nstates retain their right to structure and shape the\njury's consideration of mitigating evidence.\nQUESTION: Didn't those judges look at the\ninstruction in isolation without reading it against the\nspecial issues?\nMR. SCHAERR: Well I think they -- I don't\nthink they looked at it in isolation. I think --\nQUESTION: Did they refer to the special issues\nin their comment on the instructions?\nMR. SCHAERR: I believe they did and certainly\nthat was the entire issue throughout the --\nQUESTION: The language about what they have to\ndo to answer no, that at least ten jurors have to have a\nreasonable doubt as to the facts?\nMR. SCHAERR: I don't recall if they focused on\nthat specific language.\nQUESTION: Isn't that fairly relevant?\nMR. SCHAERR: Well it is relevant but as Boyd\nsays this Court and the lower courts as well they look to\nthe entire context of the trial. It's under Boyd it is\nclearly fair gave to look at voir dire and closing\narguments and all of that, and so even if it might have\nbeen better under -- even if it might have been better to\ntell the jury more clearly that it could answer a special\ninterrogatory no when it thought the answer was yes, that\nalso doesn't make the instruction unreasonable and as\nwe've discussed especially in light of the other\ncircumstances of the trial.\nI also think that there's no arguable problem in this\ncase under Roberts because the problem in Roberts of\ncourse which was a plurality opinion was that there was no\ninstruction at all that even authorized the jury to find a\nlesser included offense if it wanted to give a life\nsentence instead of a death sentence.\nQUESTION: What do you think about that? The\nother thing more philosophically, as a prosecutor, someone\non that side, if this court were to say nullification\ninstructions are okay, might that come back to haunt you\nsome day in other cases, indeed to bite you if you see\nwhat I'm driving at? I want to get your reaction to that\nas a prosecutor.\nMR. SCHAERR: I think the way the word\nnullification was used by the Texas Court of Criminal\nAppeals, it was simply that the jury could in essence\nnullify what it might otherwise consider to be the correct\nanswer to one of those three special interrogatories. I\ndon't think they were saying that nullification\ninstructions as a general matter are proper or anything\nlike that but as used here that's what nullification\nmeans. I don't think there's any magic.\nQUESTION: The word nullification instruction is\nalmost an oxymoron, isn't it, because you think of\nnullification jury as refusing to follow an instruction\nrather than following one.\nMR. SCHAERR: Right and that was the situation\nin Roberts, but that's not the situation here. At the end\nof the day the instruction at issue here was reasonable in\nmy view, if for no other reason that it gave the jury at\nleast one clear path to a life sentence based on the\npetitioner's mitigating evidence and that is all that this\ncourt's decisions clearly required.\nNow finally I think it's important to remember as the\nCourt considers the statute here that Edpa was designed to\ncurb what Congress saw as an enormous and undue federal\nburden on the state's criminal justice system.\nThank you.\nQUESTION: Thank you Mr. Schaerr.\nMr. Smith you have four minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT S. SMITH\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. SMITH: Thank you.\nLet me -- I'm going to try to use that time just to\ntry to convey some information on some points that may be\nof interest. On the question of what a Texas court could\nhave done my Texas colleague advises me that there was a\ncase called McPherson in which a Texas court before the\nstatute was amended did give a fourth special issue and\nthat that was ultimately upheld by the Texas Court of\nCriminal Appeals. That had not occurred at the time of\nour trial but the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals did\napprove it. There was an escape hatch available and it\nwas used. I do not have the citation to the McPherson\ncase here; if there's an appropriate way to provide it\nwe'll certainly do that.\nSecondly on the question of -- I learned to say voir\ndire when I was in Texas and I'm trying to unlearn it, but\nit's one or the other voir dire or voir dire. I suggest\nthat it is perilous to rely on voir dire of all things to\nundo or to cure a problem with an instruction. Mr.\nTaylor is quite right, that this process in Texas goes on\nfor weeks and weeks and a lot of things get said. If\nyou'll look at volume 22 page 1792 of the record, you will\nsee one of the jurors, one of the jurors who actually sat\nbeing instructed by the prosecutors, you should not\nautomatically answer these questions a certain way to\nachieve a punishment, you should not answer one of them no\nbecause I want him to get a life sentence. Possibly\ntechnically correct but surely in the context of what\nthese jurors were supposed to do, likely to confuse, my\npoint simply a lot of things get said in voir dire over a\nlong time and it would be a mistake to say that that cured\nwhat I think is a hopelessly confusing instruction.\nOn the Peebles Report where Mr. Taylor made the\nargument that what they were really trying to show was\nthat Penry was a psychopath, I have a very short response.\nThe Peebles Report doesn't say that. There's nothing in\nthe Peebles Report that says he's a psychopath. Sure they\nsaid it; everybody else said it. Peebles said pretty much\nwhat our expert said, he said he has mental retardation\nand anti-social conduct, but anti-social personality\ndisorder, you won't find that in the Peebles Report.\nUnless there are further questions I'll submit.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Smith the case is\nsubmitted.\n(Whereupon, at 11:59 a.m., the case in the\nabove-entitled matter was submitted.)\n"
