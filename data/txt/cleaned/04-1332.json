Hallock.\nMr. Hallward-Driemeier.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nIn enacting the Federal Tort Claims Act,\nCongress recognized that suits against Federal\nemployees, based upon their official conduct,\nconstituted a very real attack upon the morale of the\nCivil Service. Congress addressed that concern in two\nways. First, it allowed plaintiffs to sue the United\nStates directly, but secondly and importantly, it\nprovided that a plaintiff who took up that opportunity,\nthe judgment in the suit against the United States\nwould constitute a complete bar to any action against\nthe employee.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And in enacting\nsection 1291, Congress specified that only final\ndecisions would be appealable.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That's right, Your\nHonor, and this Court has adopted a practical rather\nthan technical construction of that statute. And the\nCourt has recognized in -- in numerous cases that\nclaims of official immunity are -- warrant immediate\nappellate review because they can only be effectively\nvindicated by review at the motion to dismiss stage.\nAnd -- and that is the kind of protection\nthat section 2676 provides. It establishes that the\njudgment in the suit against the United States shall be\na complete bar against any action against the employee.\nSo it's the action itself that is precluded, and it is\nprecluded completely. And that --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you can -- you can say\nthe same thing of -- of res judicata, that there is a\ncomplete bar. I guess my concern here is that this\nseems to be, with respect to the employee, something\nmuch closer to a res judicata case than to an immunity\nper se case.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, Your Honor,\nthe -- the Court recognized in the Digital Equipment\ncase that even a claim of res judicata could correctly\nbe characterized as a right to be free from suit, but\nit said that that wasn't enough. One had to look at\nthe importance of the -- of the value protected, and\nthe --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Digital I remember.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: And -- and the Court\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So do I.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: I'm sure you do.\nAnd the Court has recognized in any number of\ncases that claims of official immunity are the kind\nthat present sufficiently important public interests to\nwarrant an exception to the -- the otherwise rule that\nappeals can only be had at the final judgment.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But in Digital Equipment,\nI think that we said that the collateral order doctrine\nis narrow, it should stay that way, and that we should\ngive it -- we should be very reluctant to expand the\npractical construction of section 1291. And this\ncertainly would be an expansion, would it not?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, I don't think\nso, Your Honor, because this is like the other claims\nof immunity that the Court has recognized warrant\ncollateral appeal in Mitchell v. Forsyth or Nixon v.\nFitzgerald. It's a kind of official --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's certainly broader --\nit's certainly broader than res judicata anyway, isn't\nit? Because if the Government -- suit against the\nGovernment is dismissed on jurisdictional grounds, what\nwould be res judicata is only the jurisdictional\nquestion, and -- and this doesn't -- this goes beyond\nthat, doesn't it?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That's right, Your\nHonor. We point out any number of ways in which\nsection 2676 confers an immunity on employees that is\nbroader than the traditional common law rule of res\njudicata. For example, res judicata would not bar a\nsuit against another party that could not have been\njoined in the first suit, but by its plain terms,\nsection 2676 would bar such a claim.\nLikewise, common law res judicata would not\nbar a second suit to -- to recover a kind of damages\nthat were unavailable in the first, but whereas\npunitive damages are unavailable in a suit against the\nUnited States, section 2676 would plainly bar a second\nsuit against the employee to cover punitive damages.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I'm -- I'm assuming\nthat it's not res judicata in -- in the narrow sense of\nthe doctrine, but it's -- it's still a bar that depends\nupon a -- a prior judgment. And in that respect, it's\nsort of res judicata-like. Conversely, there is --\nthere is no immunity in the first instance conferred\ndirectly on the employee as such. And so that's --\nthat's why I -- it seems to me that there's an argument\nthat this is a lot closer to res judicata than it is to\nclassic immunity.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, certainly\nthere is no categorical rule that claims in the nature\nof claim preclusion are not eligible for immediate\nappeal under collateral order. In Abney v. United\nStates, for example, the Court upheld immediate appeal\nof the denial of a -- of a double jeopardy claim, which\nlikewise depends upon the existence of a prior action.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But a double jeopardy claim\nis -- is a claim in which there is an -- a -- an\nimmunity textually conferred by the -- the\nConstitution, or at least, we -- we have thought it --\nthe guarantee does not make an awful lot of practical\nsense, unless you read it that way. You don't have\nthat -- that situation here.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, the\nConstitution does not use the word immunity, nor does\nthe Westfall Act use the word immunity.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And there is -- in fact,\nthere's no immunity. That's what makes this different.\nSuppose the Bivens action had been brought\nfirst. The officers would not have been immune from\nsuit. It's not like an officer who has qualified\nimmunity and doesn't depend upon the suit order. Here,\nthere would have been no immunity at all if you'd sued\nthe officers directly and not brought that Federal Tort\nClaims Act suit first.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That's right. Like\nthe claim of double jeopardy in Abney, the claim of\nimmunity here depends upon the existence of a prior\nlitigation, but as in Abney, the -- the interests that\nit protects are the interests to be free from the --\nthe cost burdens distraction of litigation.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- I take it\nJustice Ginsburg's point -- and it's my concern as well\n-- is that if the Bivens action is brought first,\nthere's no protection of the Government against\nmultiple actions. So -- so the policy that you're\narguing for just is dependent on which suit happens to\nbe brought first.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, I'm not sure\nthat --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And that's not -- that's\nnot a very strong policy interest to vindicate by\nexpanding the collateral order doctrine.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, it -- it's --\nit's not entirely clear that the United States would be\nsubject to a second suit. It -- the -- the\nsusceptibility of the United States to a further suit\nwould be governed by collateral --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it depends on -- it\ndepends on -- on how the case was resolved.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That's -- that's\nright.\nBut -- but what's important here is that the\ninterest protected is the interest of the employee\nagainst the -- the distraction -- against the attack on\nmorale. That was the language that the Assistant\nAttorney General used.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It's hard to accept that\nargument given that if the lawyer had sued in the\nreverse order, there would be the same morale. All the\nrest would follow.\nSo here it's -- it's a question of the lawyer\nbrought the wrong lawsuit first, and the attack on the\nmorale -- there's no difference if a Bivens action had\nbeen brought and no other action. Is there any -- why\nis this morale changed by the Government having gotten\nthe first case dismissed for lack of subject matter\njurisdiction with no consideration of the merits at\nall?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, Your Honor,\nthe -- the statute protects against the -- the cost of\nrepetitive litigation, the harassment of the employee\nof multiple suits. These are the exact same types of\ninterest that the Court has recognized --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What was the harassment\nthat this employee experienced in the -- in the FTCA\nclaim that was dismissed?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: It -- well, in this\nparticular FTCA claim, there -- there was no discovery.\nBut as we point out in -- in our brief, FTCA cases,\neven those dismissed on the basis of the 2680\nexceptions, are often resolved only after years of\nlitigation, including often trial. So -- so the\nharassment is -- is the same.\nOn -- on respondents' view, the judgment bar\nwould not kick in. For example, in a case like Varig\nAirlines, where this Court upheld the Government's\nassertion of the -- the discretionary function\nexception only after 8 years of litigation when the\ncase had been -- gone to the Ninth Circuit two times\nwhere there had been a trial and final judgment and --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Did that -- did that\ninvolve the employee or it was just legal argument\ninvolving lawyers representing the United States?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: It would certainly\ninvolve the employee. Any trial would -- would\ninevitably involve the employee in discovery, in -- in\nappearing at trial as a witness.\nThe -- the Government also is protected by\nsection 2676, as the Assistant Attorney General said.\nThe -- the burden on the Government, because the\nGovernment is often called upon to defend employees\nagainst suit -- and -- and the Government, having\nlitigated once and obtained a judgment in the first\nFTCA suit, should not be forced to expend all those\nresources again in a second suit, this time styled as\none against the employee.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Counsel, can I ask you sort\nof a basic question that I don't really think is\nadequately addressed in the briefs? You contend, as I\nunderstand it, that the exception in 2680(c) covers\nthis case.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And 2680 -- the\nintroductory language of 2680 is the provisions of this\nchapter shall not apply to such cases. And is it not\ntrue that 2676 is in this chapter, and does it not,\ntherefore, follow that 2676 does not apply to this\ncase?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: 2676 makes the --\nthe scope of its application turn on whether there has\nbeen a judgment and an action under section 1346(b).\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But my first question is\nhow does 2676 apply if it's in the chapter that 2680\nsays shall not apply to -- to things in the exception?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, Your Honor,\nthe -- that view of the language, shall not apply,\nwould be inconsistent with this Court's decisions both\nin United States v. Smith and in FDIC v. Meyer.\nIn United States v. Smith, for example, the\nplaintiffs had made exactly that argument with respect\nto shall not apply. They said that -- that 1346 shall\nnot apply to an action that arises in a foreign\ncountry. Therefore, section 1346 cannot provide the\nremedy to which we are supposed to be limited. And the\nCourt rejected precisely that argument.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But they held that the --\nthe action simply didn't apply in -- in that case.\nThere was no -- there was no recovery under the --\nbasically it held the foreign -- foreign country\nexception precluded the statute from applying --\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, what they --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- which is what also\nhappens here.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, take another\nexample why -- why you couldn't read the -- the shall\nnot apply language in that way. The first exclusivity\nprovision of section 2679(a) with respect to sue and\nbe sued agencies -- if you said that 1346(b) shall not\napply to a suit against the Postal Service because the\nsuits against the Postal Service regarding miscarriage\nof letters is excluded from 1346(b) by that same\nlanguage, shall not apply, well, that would render the\nPostal Service exception meaningless and you would sue\nthe -- the Postal Service pursuant to its sue and be\nsued authority instead of suing the United States under\n1346(b).\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Go -- go through that again,\nwould you?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: The -- the --\n2679(a) says that the authority of an agency to sue and\nbe sued in its own name shall not extend to claims\ncognizable under section 1346(b). The argument might\nbe made, with respect to a suit against the Postal\nService for miscarriage of the mail, that -- that claim\nis not cognizable under section 1346(b) because section\n2680(b) says that 1346(b) shall not apply to claims\nrelating to the miscarriage of mail. So by the same\nreading of shall not apply, one would come to the\nconclusion that -- that the claim relating to the\nmiscarriage of mail is not cognizable under 1346(b),\nand therefore you sue the -- the Postal Service.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No. It only says it shall\nnot apply if it comes within the exception.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: And -- and a -- a\nclaim with respect to the miscarriage of mail is one\nthat comes within the exception. And so that reading\nof shall not apply has been rejected by the Court in\nSmith v. United States, likewise is inconsistent with\nthe Court's decision, FDIC v. Meyer, and would render\nit simply ridiculous with respect to claims against the\nPostal Service.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I guess it's true, is it --\nI'm testing my own understanding of this -- that if, in\nfact, shall not apply meant anything in that chapter,\nif you had a State and that State gave a State law\nremedy for, say, detaining property or for loss of mail\nor something, then that State law remedy would continue\nin existence because the thing in the law that sets\naside that State court remedy is a different part of\nthe same chapter --\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That's right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- in 2679(b)?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Right. And -- and\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: But the whole point of the\nWestfall Act is to get rid of those State causes of\naction.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Exactly, and in that\nsense, that reading of shall not apply is simply\ninconsistent with the Court's holding in United States\nv. Smith.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But the language does seem\nto say it.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, I think what\nit -- what it means is that -- what it -- what it has\nbeen understood to mean is that the United States'\nwaiver of sovereign immunity. It -- the United States\nhas not subjected itself to liability on claims of the\nnature of those exceptions. And that's how the Court\nhas described it in any number of cases, that the\nexceptions in 2680 mark the limits of the extent to\nwhich the United States --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Well, then --\nthen to get to the main point here, if we are going to\nget to that, the question that I would have for you is\n-- is the following. If we accept your interpretation,\nit's pretty anomalous. I mean, someone who brings his\nBivens action first, of course, can sue the individual\nemployee, and you agree to that. But if he brings his\nBivens action second, because he made a mistake and\nwent into the wrong court or he brought the wrong\naction or it was a borderline case, frankly, and he\ndidn't know how it would end up, that person is out of\nluck.\nNow, there's nothing in this statute that\nsays that the Government -- that the Congress wanted to\nachieve that result. What order you bring the suit in\nshouldn't really make any difference here. The Bivens\naction is totally different from all the other tort\nactions in that respect, and it's listed separately in\n2679 to make clear that it isn't -- it is different.\nSo why? I mean, why read it your way? The\nburden that reading it their way would impose on the\nGovernment is minuscule. The number of such suits is\ntiny, I would imagine.\nAll right. Now, what is wrong with my\nquestion?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, there --\nJUSTICE BREYER: A lot of things.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: -- there are any\nnumber of things wrong in our view.\nFirst, Congress has, as Your Honor\nrecognized, created an express exception for Bivens\nclaims in 2679(b), but it has created no similar\nexception to -- to 2676 even though prior to passage of\nthe Westfall Act, any number of courts of appeals had\nconstrued 2676 to apply to Bivens claims.\nFurther, as respondents recognize, 2676's\napplication at this point is virtually limited because\nof the Westfall Act to a second case that raises a\nBivens claim. So their --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Could the two claims have\nbeen brought together? This is -- if an employee is in\nan uncertain situation, doesn't know if the FTCA act\napplies, it certainly doesn't want to be without any\ndefendant for conduct of the kind that -- that this\ncomplaint charges. Could such an employee say I want\nto bring my Tort Claims Act against the United States,\nbut I'd like to have in that same lawsuit, in case the\ncourt says it comes under an exception, my Bivens\nclaim? Would it be possible to bring those suits\ntogether?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, Your Honor,\nobviously that -- that issue is not presented here\nbecause here we have two separate litigation --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm -- I'm asking --\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: But --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- does the Government\nhave a position on that, whether you can combine a suit\nagainst the United States under the Tort Claims Act\nwith a suit against the individual officers under\nBivens.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, the -- the\nconsistent view of the courts of appeals and district\ncourts over 50 years has been that the judgment bar\ndoes have some application even when the claims are\nlitigated simultaneously. For example, it's the\nuniversal rule among those courts of appeals that have\ndecided the issue that if the plaintiff obtains a\njudgment against the United States, that that judgment\nimmediately --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But I want you to go back\nbefore we get to a judgment. Can such a suit be\nbrought?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Can it be brought?\nIt can be brought.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Could this lawyer have\nbrought the FTCA act complaint and pled in the\nalternative the Bivens claim?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: It -- it can\ncertainly be brought because the judgment bar only\ncomes into effect when there's been a judgment. So it\ncould be brought.\nBut as I was saying, the -- the courts are\nunanimous in holding that if both of those claims were\nto proceed through litigation and to trial and there\nwere to be a judgment in the action under the FTCA\nagainst the United States, that that would immediately\nbar any recovery against the employee. And that's been\nthe view, again, for some 50 years now. So --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, what if the\nfirst case against the Government were dismissed\nbecause of a finding that the employee was acting\nbeyond the scope of his authority? Should that really\nbar a subsequent action against the employee in an\nindividual capacity?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, in -- in a\nfootnote --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I read your --\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: -- in our brief we\nsuggest it might not --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I read footnote 5.\nYou said it didn't. But I don't see how that's\nconsistent with the language of the statute.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: And -- and in fact,\nin -- in re-reading FDIC v. Meyer in preparation for\noral argument, footnote 7 of that decision suggests\nthat that would be a judgment in an action under\n1346(b). FDIC v. Meyer was saying that it would,\nnonetheless, be cognizable under 1346(b) because the\nallegation was that they were acting within the scope.\nSo -- so perhaps we should not have conceded that.\nBut it could still be that the -- the\njudgment bar wouldn't apply. It would be an action in\n-- under -- a judgment in an action under 1346(b), but\nthe judgment bar protects an employee of the\nGovernment. And -- and that's a defined term and it's\ndefined in the way that suggests the person acting\nwithin the scope of their employment, advancing the\npurposes of the agency. So there -- there might be a\nreason why the judgment bar itself would not apply to a\nclaim where the determination was that the person was\nnot acting within the scope of employment.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Your theory would cover\nthe case where the FTCA claim drops out because the\nemployee didn't file the administrative claim within\nthe -- what is it? 6 months?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: It -- Your Honor, it\nwould not, I think, cover a claim that -- where the\ndismissal was curable, where the person could go and\nexhaust their claim. But the test of whether --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But don't they have a\nshort span where they have to bring that administrative\nclaim?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: They have -- they\nhave 2 years to bring the administrative claim. They\nhave 6 months to bring the suit in court after the\nadministrative claim has been resolved. And the -- the\nreason --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And the suit is tossed out\nbecause one of those deadlines was met. It would\nfollow, I think, under your reasoning that there could\nbe no subsequent Bivens claim.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That's right. The\n-- the statute makes the test whether there has been a\njudgment in an action under 1346(b), and plainly, under\nany reading of that language, it means where there is a\njudgment that finally resolves the liability of the\nUnited States under section 1346(b), there has been a\njudgment in an action under 1346(b). And I don't think\nthat the language is susceptible to any other reading.\nSo if the claim, as Your Honor suggested, finally\nresolves whether the United States could be liable\nunder section 1346(b), then the judgment bar applies.\nUnless there are no further questions --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'd like to pursue the\nquestion I asked you earlier because I really didn't\nfully understand your answer. It seems to me, as I\nread 2680, it simply says that if one of the exceptions\napplies, there's no waiver of sovereign immunity,\nbasically. That's what -- what the scope of it is.\nAnd therefore, none of the other provisions of -- of\nthis chapter apply, and if none of the provisions of\nthis chapter apply, clearly the judgment bar provision\nis one of those.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: I -- I think I'm\ngoing to borrow Justice Breyer's response because it's\n-- it's a little clearer than the -- than the point I\nwas trying to make. And that -- by that same logic,\nthat would mean that the provisions of 2679(b) would\nnot apply to the claim, and that is --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That's correct.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: -- precisely the\nquestion that was addressed in -- in United States v.\nSmith, and the Court said that -- that it did apply.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It follows that 2679(b)\ndoes not apply, but you're just have -- working on a\nblank slate with no provision of the Federal Tort\nClaims Act affecting a waiver of sovereign immunity or\nimposing any kind of judgment bar.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: But if 2679(b) did\nnot apply, there would be no basis for substituting the\nUnited States and having the claim dismissed. And that\nwas precisely the issue that was addressed in -- in\nUnited States v. Smith. So -- so plainly you cannot\nread it to mean that -- that all of the provisions of\nthe FTCA are simply a nullity or nugatory with respect\nto such a claim. That -- that -- rather, as Your Honor\nsuggested, what it means is that the United States has\nnot waived its sovereign immunity.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Correct.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: But in FDIC v.\nMeyer, the Court was very clear that the FTCA is the\nkind of case which defines jurisdiction by the scope of\nthe waiver of immunity and to -- the claims to which\nthe United States has rendered itself liable. So -- so\nall of those issues are interrelated, and -- and it\nreflects the substantive nature of those exclusions.\nIt could not be --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But you left out one word\nthat I think is important there. To test it to see if\nI'm right about this is I thought 2679(b) was focusing\nin large part upon State tort suits. Is that right?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: It is true that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: They wanted to get rid of\nthe State tort suits --\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: The -- the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- in part. Am I right\nabout that or not?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: 2679(b) applies only\nto -- to State law causes of action.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So, therefore,\nif in fact we had words mean what they seem to mean,\nCongress would have both removed the State lawsuits in\n2679(b) and reinstated them or set them in the\nexceptions. But that would have the statute defeat\nitself, and therefore, that case that you're citing\ncame to a correct result.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That's right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's right?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Don't tell me it's\nright if it's not right is all I want --\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, certainly --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: -- we -- we believe\nthat United States v. Smith was right, and that shall\nnot apply cannot have the meaning that Justice Stevens\nwas trying to attribute to it for that reason.\nIf there are no further questions, I'd like\nto reserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMs. Zieve.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLISON M. ZIEVE\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMS. ZIEVE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nTo begin with, the court of appeals did not\nhave jurisdiction under the final judgment rule to\nreview the district court's order.\nPetitioners do not contest that they could\nhave been sued under Bivens initially or that the\nHallocks could have filed simultaneous FTCA claims and\nBivens claims. Petitioners' argument is that they\ncannot now be sued only because the Hallocks first\nfiled a different suit against the United States. That\nsituation, which hinges on the sequence of lawsuits,\ndoes not describe an immunity or a right not to stand\ntrial.\nPetitioners try hard to paint the purpose of\nthe judgment bar as the same as the purpose of\nqualified immunity, avoiding distraction and inhibition\nof Federal employees from their work. But --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But what -- what\nsignificance do you give to the word to complete, as to\nwhether it's a complete bar? Doesn't that indicate\nthat the -- the statute is -- is a bar to all -- all\nfurther actions after a judgment?\nMS. ZIEVE: I don't think complete bar means\nanything more than bar. Res judicata is a complete bar\nand a statute of limitations is a complete bar. And I\n-- I think the statute would mean the same thing\nwithout that word. And there's --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, not -- there --\nthere are exceptions to the statute of limitations.\nYou could have tolling, and there are exceptions to a\npreclusion doctrine. So those doctrines aren't\ncomplete in the sense that they are without exceptions.\nMS. ZIEVE: That's right, but when -- when\nthe bar applies, it's -- it's an absolute bar. I don't\n-- I agree that if the bar has been triggered, it is a\n-- it completely precludes any further action on any\nclaims, but I don't think the word complete gives us\nmuch guidance about when the bar is triggered.\nAnd the purpose behind the bar generally is\nnot the same as the purpose of qualified immunity\nbecause although the FTCA, in general, and the\nlegislative history of the FTCA indicates that the act\nas a whole was intended to protect employee morale and\ndistraction from employment, that's not the purpose\nbehind the judgment bar. And the judgment bar would be\na poor vehicle for accomplishing that purpose since it\nallows not only a Bivens suit as an initial matter and,\nwhen it was enacted, allowed -- still allowed employees\nto be sued for State torts, but also would allow two\nsuits, as long as the Bivens suit were litigated\nbefore.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but that -- that --\nsee, that's what's -- I'm not at all certain about\nthis, whether they have an appeal, whether they don't\nhave an appeal. I'm testing it out.\nBut it seems to me if we take your position,\nwe're going to make things awfully complicated. That\nis, the -- the basic idea here is in the vast mine run\nof employee suits, go sue the Government, and you can't\nsue the employee at all. That's true of the State\nactions. That's true of ordinary tort actions. And so\nordinarily, if you sued the -- the employee, whether\nyou sued him first, second, or third, you're not\nsupposed to and he ought to have an appeal right away\nto get you out of court.\nNow, there is an exception there with the\nBivens because you can bring your suit first and then\nthere's no problem. But if we make an exception in the\nappealability rule for that, people are going to get\nmixed up. It's a kind of curlicue, and even in the\nBivens case, it has a basic objective of trying to\nprevent people from harassing the employee because the\ninstances in which you bring a Bivens suit first, as a\npractical matter, are probably small.\nNow, what's the response to that? I'm just\nnervous about making these collateral rules so\ncomplicated as to whether -- you'd have to do it\nwhether it's a Bivens suit or some other kind of suit\nunder this, and nobody is going to understand it.\nMS. ZIEVE: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So put in --\nMS. ZIEVE: I don't --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- put them in the whole bag.\nSay give the employee his appeal because most of the\ntime it's totally to help him from being harassed.\nNow, what's the answer to that? And I'm not\n-- I'm putting it because I want to get your answer.\nMS. ZIEVE: Well, a couple things. First of\nall, the -- the bar to State law tort suits is in\n2679(b), which was passed in 1988, 42 years after the\njudgment bar and the -- and the bulk of FTCA. It was\npassed as an express effort to overturn this Court's\ndecision in Westfall, which held that employees did not\nhave immunity from State law -- certain State law\ntorts. And in the findings that are incorporated into\nsection 2 of the statute, Congress specifically called\n2679(b) an immunity provision, and this Court has since\nrecognized that, for instance, in Gutierrez de\nMartinez. There is no comparable legislative history\nindicating immunity for -- for -- under 2676.\nSo I -- I don't think it's that complicated\nto figure out now whether someone is proceeding --\nwhether the claim arises -- whether the claim to\nappealability, whether the defense arises under 2679(b)\nor under the judgment bar because they just really get\nat very different things. And the courts haven't shown\n-- there's not a lot of case law in either direction,\nbut the -- the courts haven't exhibited much confusion\nabout that.\nThe other thing is that when you're -- when\nyou're construing the scope of the judgment bar, it's\nimportant to remember that this was passed in 1946, and\nit was intended -- at that time some 25 years -- 35\nyears before Bivens, what the -- what Congress was\ngetting at was State law suits against the employees\nversus State law suits against the United States. And\nthe effort was to shift the liability to the United\nStates. That effort to shift liability, yes, was for\nmorale, to protect employees from being distracted, but\nthat -- that was, again, the purpose of the shift of\nliability, the waiver of sovereign immunity in general.\nThe only real explanation of the judgment bar\nappears in the background of where the drafters\nexplained that the bar is intended to -- as a bar to --\nbar to further suit not only against the Government, as\nwould have been true under the prior bill. This is\naround page 14 of my brief, the quote from -- from the\n1945 report. Not -- a bar to liability not only\nagainst the Government, as would have been true under\nthe prior version, but also against the employee. And\nthere was no bar to suit in the prior version of the\nbill. So the drafters' explanation could only have\nbeen referring to the normal operation of res judicata.\nAnd this Court has used res judicata in Digital as\nsort of the quintessential example of a defense that is\nnot subject to immediate appeal.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Your rule would be this.\nIt's such a complicated area. I'm sorry. But if a\nplaintiff brings a lawsuit, tort suit, against a\nGovernment employee and the Westfall Act bars the\nlawsuit, period, you can't sue him at all because of --\nof (b). He gets an immediate appeal if the district\ncourt doesn't agree.\nMS. ZIEVE: That's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But if under the Westfall\nAct you could sue him, depending on the order, he\ndoesn't get an appeal.\nMS. ZIEVE: That's right because defense is\nbased on the order of suits. Those are preclusion\ndefenses, and preclusion defenses are not immediately\nappealable. And, you know, I think this follows from\nthe Court's decision in -- in Irwin that -- that\ncertain defenses that are available to private parties\nin litigation should also be available, treated the\nsame way, have the same rules when the Government is\nbeing sued like a private party.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- what's wrong\nwith the Government's distinction of Digital that here\nyou have a policy embodied in a statute as opposed to a\nprivate settlement agreement?\nMS. ZIEVE: The -- Digital explains that if\nyou have a right not to stand trial that is set forth\nin a statute or constitutional provision, that the\ncourt isn't going to second-guess the importance of\nthat right. It's -- it's unclear whether the\nimportance prong of the collateral order test should be\npart of -- part of that effective reviewability or\nwhether it's part of the second prong about separate\nfrom the merits of the case.\nBut in any event, what Digital doesn't say is\njust because something is in a statute -- a right is in\na statute -- it's -- it -- it is correct to\ncharacterize it as a right not to stand trial. To the\ncontrary, Digital cautions that anything -- so many\ndefenses could be called rights not to stand trial, and\nso the court will look -- will apply the test very\nstringently.\nStatute of limitations, for instance, are in\nstatutes and when the statute has expired, you could\nsay that is a statutory bar to a right to stand trial.\nBut statute of limitations, like the res judicata\ndefense, are just not appealable under the collateral\norder doctrine.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, I suppose if there\nwas no appellate court jurisdiction, we're not going to\nresolve the merits of that question.\nMS. ZIEVE: That's right. If there's no\nappellate court jurisdiction, the Court doesn't have to\ngo on to construe the scope of the judgment bar. But\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, you would at the end\nof the road. If -- if you go to the Bivens claim and\nif the plaintiffs prevail, you could still appeal from\nthat and say that that suit was barred. It should\nnever have gone forward.\nMS. ZIEVE: That's right, Justice Ginsburg,\nand that's exactly why this defense is effectively\nreviewable after final judgment as opposed to now.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There's no question that\nit would be -- it doesn't die if you don't have an\ninterlocutory review. It's there but you've wasted a\nlot of time going through the whole trial to find out\nthe answer.\nMS. ZIEVE: That's true to this -- just as is\ntrue with defenses based on statute of limitations or\nres judicata or, you know, a whole host of defenses --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Could the district court\nhave certified the question?\nMS. ZIEVE: The district court could have\ncertified it and -- and --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And was there a request\nmade to do that or --\nMS. ZIEVE: Yes. The district court denied\nthat.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes, but the petitioners\nrequested it. Did -- did you oppose that request\nbelow?\nMS. ZIEVE: I don't know. I don't remember.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The district judge said\nI'm not going to give you 1292(b) certification, but --\nbut there's Cohen against Beneficial out there. Why\ndon't you try that route? It was the district judge\nwho -- who mentioned that possibility, wasn't it?\nMS. ZIEVE: Well, actually the petitioners\nfiled a notice of appeal before the 1292(b) motion had\nbeen decided and then sought a 1292(b) certification.\nI think they were trying to protect themselves by doing\nit both ways --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But I think the district\n-- the district judge was aware of Cohen against\nBeneficial, and I think referred to it. Maybe I'm -- I\ndon't remember correctly.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. I -- I thought -- I\nthought the district court said I'm going to deny the\nmotion to certify because the issue is clear in my\nview, but if you think you have a collateral order\ndoctrine, then go ahead and take your appeal.\nMS. ZIEVE: Well, I don't think he expressed\nany view about whether the case satisfied the Cohen\ndoctrine.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: No, but he mentioned that\nthere was -- he mentioned Cohen.\nMS. ZIEVE: Yes, but he -- he didn't think\nthe issue warranted an immediate appeal. He made that\nclear by denying the 1292(b) motion. And -- and I\nthink that would have been the -- the appropriate way\nto appeal would have been 1292(b), and having been\ndenied that route, petitioners should wait till the end\nof the case because, as you say, this issue will be\neffectively reviewable at the conclusion of the\nlitigation.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is it -- is it --\nmaybe this is an incorrect way to look at it, but there\nis a relationship between the merits and the\ninterlocutory review decision. I would suppose if we\nagreed on the merits with the Government -- in other\nwords, adopted a fairly clear and categorical rule --\nthe need for an interlocutory appeal would diminish\nbecause the district courts would almost always get it\nright.\nBut if we adopt a standard for the\napplication of this bar that, you know, depends on a\nlot of different things, then the appellate court is\ngoing to disagree with the district court in a greater\nnumber of circumstances, and maybe we should allow an\ninterlocutory review of that.\nMS. ZIEVE: The Court's cases allowing and\ndisallowing collateral order appeals don't turn on the\n-- the litigation efficiencies that will be obtained if\nthe court goes forward, but rather on whether the issue\nor the defense that -- that the petitioner is seeking\nto appeal actually fits the stringent requirements of\nthe Cohen doctrine. And the Court has, in its more\nrecent cases, cautioned against broadening collateral\norder appeals and indicated that 1292(b) and the rule's\nenabling act provisions 2092 that allows a court to\nidentify categories of cases that are appropriate for\ninterlocutory appeal as a categorical matter, but those\nare the preferred ways to go rather than stretching the\nfinal judgment rule really beyond the bounds of its\nlanguage.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Perhaps you should go on\nnow to the question, assuming that it is immediately\nappealable.\nMS. ZIEVE: If the Court reaches the second\nquestion, the res judicata foundation of the bar shows\nas well why the Second Circuit's decision on the\nsubstantive question should be affirmed.\nThe -- the text -- the language of the text\nuses classic res judicata terminology, judgment and\nbar, and the historical context of the statute makes\nthat reading by far the most reasonable.\nThe -- when the act was passed in -- in 1946,\nuntil then, Federal employees had been sued for State\nlaw torts, the biggest category of cases involving auto\naccidents with postal workers. And Congress set about\ntrying to waive sovereign immunity so that the\nGovernment could step in to defend the suits and be\nsued in their place, which it thought was fair and\nwould help morale. And so that plaintiffs would no\nlonger have to seek private bills in Congress, which\nwas considered a -- a burden.\nWhen the -- when the -- the FTCA allows the\nUnited States to stand in the shoes of the employee for\npurposes of a State law tort suit. And then the\njudgment bar extends to the employee the preclusion\nbenefit of that suit so that the employee gets the same\nres judicata effect that he would have had absent the\nshift of -- of the defense to the Government.\nThe -- again, the -- the one clear\nexplanation in the background for why the judgment --\nwhat the judgment bar does is that it -- it applies to\nthe employee the same bar that would have applied to\nthe Government under -- under prior bills which, again,\nwas only the bar of res judicata. Because res --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Did you -- did you\nmake the argument or the point that Justice Stevens\narticulated earlier about the -- the provisions of this\nchapter not applying and that including 2676?\nMS. ZIEVE: No, we didn't make it, and --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does it sound good or\nbad to you now?\n(Laughter.)\nMS. ZIEVE: We did make a similar argument\nthat 2680 states that 1346(b) shall not apply and\nbecause the judgment bar only applies to actions under\n1346(b), it's something of a contradiction to say that\nan action that -- to which 1346(b) shall not apply at\nthe same time an action under 1346(b).\nAs for Justice Stevens' broader argument that\n-- that chapter -- chapter 171, which is the rest of\nthe FTCA, other than -- than 1346(b), shall not --\nshall not apply to claims arising from the exceptions,\nI don't think that Smith, which I think was Mr.\nHallward-Driemeier's response -- Smith doesn't really\nprovide a full answer to why that argument might be\nwrong because Smith really -- Smith did say that an\naction that -- an action to which the chapter does not\napply at the same time can be one to which the\nexclusive remedy provision has been applied.\nBut one difference is the -- the order in\nwhich those things happened. First, you would get the\n2679(b) exclusive remedy provision invoked before the\nquestion of whether 2680 applied would arise.\nAnd the other point is that Smith, which\nconstrued the exclusive remedy provision to apply even\nif the exceptions would then preclude a suit entirely,\nwas based on the purpose of the exclusive remedy\nprovision. The legislative history's relatively clear\nstatements that it was intended to provide an immunity\nfrom State law tort suits for Federal employees acting\nwithin the scope of their employment and looks to two\nother provisions of 2679, neither of which would come\n-- have any role here or were even adopted or enacted\nuntil 42 years after the judgment bar was enacted.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't -- I don't\nunderstand. If we were to take that, wouldn't we have\nto overturn Smith? You think not. You just said not.\nBut as I -- then as I understand Smith, we\nlook to (b) and (b) says, plaintiff, you cannot bring\nan action under anything. Okay? You can't bring a\nState tort law action. You can't bring an action under\nFederal law against the employee, with certain\nexceptions where you can like Bivens and where there's\na specific statute.\nThen we have over here the exceptions\nsection. And over here in the exceptions section, it\nsays there is no Federal action for, among other\nthings, the case in front of us and, among other\nthings, actions in a foreign country. And so the court\nsays, one, this is in a foreign country, so you can't\nbring it under Federal Tort Claims Act, and now we'll\ngo look to see whether this bar that you can't bring\nit, period, applies. They say it does apply.\nNow, Justice Stevens dissented, but he didn't\ndissent on that ground.\nAnd -- and so -- so I don't see how we could\nreach the result with this other exception without\noverturning Smith because Smith said (b) does apply.\nAnd so if the fact that it falls within an exception\nmeans the whole thing doesn't apply, then they would\nhave held (b) doesn't apply. But they said (b) does\napply. So how do we get there given Smith?\nMS. ZIEVE: Well, like application of the\njudgment bar, one distinction would be that it turns on\nthe order in which things occur, and in --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, that -- that would\nbe to overturn the reasoning of Smith. It would say --\nMS. ZIEVE: But the reasoning --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMS. ZIEVE: Well, the reasoning of Smith is\nnot based on the language of 2680. The reasoning of\nSmith is based on the statement of legislative purpose,\nthe background under which 2679(b) was enacted, and\nbased on 2679(b)(2), which has -- stating exceptions,\nand 2679(d)(4), which has procedures for the United\nStates to certify and step into the shoes of the United\nStates. So --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, in effect, they didn't\n-- the Court didn't consider this argument in Smith.\nMS. ZIEVE: Right. What the Court did in\nSmith -- and I think this applies to much of the\nCourt's jurisprudence to construing the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The main holding in Smith\nwas that the foreign country exception applied. That's\nall they held in Smith, wasn't it?\nMS. ZIEVE: Right. Smith held the foreign\ncountry exception applied even though the employee\nwould -- the -- the plaintiff would have no remedy.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And the -- and the -- I\ndon't see how that is at all inconsistent with what\nI'm suggesting here. I really don't.\nMS. ZIEVE: Well, I don't think it's\ninconsistent. I think one thing that's important is\nthat the Court -- both in that case and in Meyer and in\nGutierrez de Martinez, the Court looked at provisions\nof the FTCA that are not models of clarity and\nattempted to give a sensible reading, given the -- the\npurposes that Congress was trying to achieve and the\ncontext and structure of the specific provisions.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, looking at it very\nbroadly, it doesn't seem to me that if the United\nStates did not waive sovereign immunity for a\nparticular category of tort case, that a dismissal of\nsuch a tort case should bar an -- an action by an\nindividual against an individual defendant, just\nlooking at it in -- in a global sense. And that's what\nthe plain language of the statute also says. So I\ndon't really see any tension. I -- maybe I'm missing\nsomething obvious here.\nMS. ZIEVE: I agree entirely. As the Court\nsaid in Meyer, the jurisdiction under the FTCA is\ndefined by the scope of the waiver of sovereign\nimmunity, and without question --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But we -- this case is\nabout the interpretation of 2676, as we took it. And\nbefore your time runs out, if we can get to the nub of\nyour difference, your reading and the Government's, you\nsay judgment in 2676 means judgment on the merits, and\nthe Government says it means any judgment. So to buy\nyour interpretation, we would have to put a caret mark\nafter judgment and put on the merits. But the statute\ndoesn't say on the merits.\nMS. ZIEVE: No, the statute doesn't say what\nit means by judgment. And I -- and I don't think\njudgment has a clear meaning, and that's why it's\nappropriate to look to the context of the provision,\nwhat Congress was trying to achieve in the provision to\ninterpret the scope of the bar and the meaning of -- of\nthat word and all the words together.\nThe -- the purpose of the statute is to shift\nsuits from the employees to the Government, and the\nbackground of this specific provision, little as it is,\nand the comparison in a couple places to this provision\ndiscussing a parallel way to the administrative\nsettlement provision -- we think the most sensible\nreading is that Congress was trying to extend the\npreclusion effect of the suit against the Government so\nthat although the employee would no longer be sued and\nwould get that benefit in the first instance, if the\nplaintiff chose to go against the Government first, the\nemployee wouldn't have -- there would be no second suit\nagainst the employee for those same State law torts\nbecause in -- in 1946, the only torts Congress was\nconsidering were State law torts. Am I going to sue\nthe Government for negligence or my mail carrier for\nnegligence?\nAnd to -- both for efficiency reasons, to\nprotect the Government, which was concerned about --\nabout the burden on it of having to go -- to litigate\ntwice, the preclusion effect would be carried to the\nemployee, so that once there was a resolution of the\nState law torts against the Government, that would be\nthe end of the matter. I think the end of the matter\nis actually a phrase that the Assistant Attorney\nGeneral uses in the legislative history.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is the -- as a\npractical matter, though, what is the great burden on\nthe plaintiffs in requiring them to sue the individual\ndefendants first if they're concerned about the\njudgment bar?\nMS. ZIEVE: In -- in many cases, if not most\ncases, an -- a plaintiff won't have both remedies\navailable. So it's only a -- a small universe of cases\nanyway in which a plaintiff would want to sue in Bivens\nand sue under the FTCA. But at the beginning of the\ncase, before discovery, when all you've done is file\nyour administrative claim to which, in many cases as in\nthis one, the Government has never even responded, the\nplaintiffs and the lawyers may have no idea that they\nactually have a Bivens claim. In this case, when they\nthought they had one, they filed it.\nAlso, the Government's view in -- in other\ncases is not that your -- it doesn't help the\nplaintiffs to sue simultaneously because the\nGovernment's position in other cases has been -- and\ncourts have largely agreed -- that once the judgment in\nthe -- on the FTCA claim comes down, the Bivens suit is\nthen precluded, in some cases even if the judgment in\nthe Bivens suit has preceded the judgment in the FTCA\nsuit. So bringing them simultaneously, while in some\ncases might -- might be feasible and seem like a good\nidea, is not necessarily going to protect the\nplaintiffs, given the scope of the Government's\narguments.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you don't --\nyou don't have to bring them simultaneously. You can\nbring the individual action first, separately.\nMS. ZIEVE: Bring the individual -- bring\nsuit -- the Bivens suit first? If the -- if the\nstatute of limitations work out, you could bring the\nBivens suit first, but again, you'd have to --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: A Bivens suit is pretty\nhard to prove, a lot harder than proving a case of\nnegligence.\nMS. ZIEVE: Yes. And since, either way,\nyou're only going to get one satisfaction for your\nclaim, it seems odd to adopt a construction that\nencourages plaintiffs to go first after the employees\nwhen the purpose of the FTCA was try to encourage\nplaintiffs to go after the Government instead.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And plaintiffs, generally,\nlike to sue -- sue solvent defendants too I think.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. ZIEVE: Yes. And -- and if the\nGovernment had responded in this case to the\nadministrative claim in -- in a timely manner or at\nall, the plaintiffs would have had a better sense of\nwhere they stood on the FTCA claim before they filed\nsuit.\nI'd like to mention, although the Government\nhas sort of retracted it, that footnote 5 of their\nreply brief concedes that claims wholly outside the\npurview of the FTCA, to use their phrase -- that\njudgments based on claims wholly outside the purview of\nthe FTCA do not trigger the judgment bar. Claims based\non -- claims that arise under the exceptions of 2680\nare surely outside the purview of the FTA -- FTCA. The\n-- the 1945 committee report, which is the last one\nbefore the statute was enacted, actually describes the\nFTCA 2680 exceptions as excepting certain classes of\ntorts from the grant of the right to sue. Not only\ndoes that make clear that they're outside the purview\nof the FTCA, but that they are matters of subject\nmatter jurisdiction. As this Court has explained in\ncases like Scarborough and last month in Everhart,\nsubject matter jurisdiction refers to classes of cases\nthat the court has authority to adjudicate. The court\n-- the district court did not have authority to\nadjudicate the FTCA claim filed by the Hallocks because\nit fell within an exception. For that reason, res\njudicata would not apply.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Hallward-Driemeier, you have 5-and-a-half\nminutes left.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Thank you, Your\nHonor.\nFirst, I think it's important to note that\nrespondents concede that the Westfall Act confers a\nform of official immunity. That statute, like 2676,\ndoes not use the word immunity. Rather, it uses the\nword, any action related to the same subject matter is\nprecluded. And that is virtually indistinguishable\nfrom the language of 2676 that -- that establishes a\ncomplete bar to any action by reason of the same\nsubject matter.\nSo there is no requirement that Congress\ninvoked particular language to create an immunity. The\nquestion is what are the underlying concerns that are\nprotected? And the respondents have admitted that\n2676, like the Westfall Act, was intended to protect\nemployee morale against the threat of personal\nliability when they were acting for the Government, as\nwell as the distraction and cost of defending against\nsuit.\nThis Court, in fact, in Gilman --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The thing you haven't\nanswered that I think is troubling everybody is why is\n-- why is that -- I mean, if you could come up with\nsome explanation of why that concern for morale only\narises after there has been a -- a judgment in the suit\nagainst the Government. Why -- if that were the\nconcern and if the Government wanted total immunity,\nwhy wouldn't they have extended it to a -- a 1983 suit\nbrought before the FTCA suit?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, Your Honor, I\n-- I admit that Congress --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Give me a good reason for\nthat.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: -- Congress\naddressed the -- only part of -- of the problem. But\nas Justice Stevens recognized, plaintiffs would want to\nsue the solvent defendant, and that's why the -- making\nthe Government itself subject to suit was part of the\ndeal. And -- and Congress understood that plaintiffs\nwere going to take up that option. And that's why, up\nuntil the -- this Court's adoption of Bivens, there\nwere virtually no decisions about 2676 because\nplaintiffs just didn't try.\nThis Court in Gilman, an early case relating\nto 2676, recognizes that -- that the statutory\nprovision was intended to address precisely these types\nof concerns, morale of employees, the same concerns\nthat have led this Court and Congress in other contexts\nto recognize other forms of -- of official immunity.\nAnd this one is equally subject to immediate review.\nRespondents suggest, considering for a\nmoment, what Congress would have expected in 1946 when\nit initially enacted this, and -- and I think that that\nis helpful. There is -- it is quite clear 2676 is\nexplicit, that Congress did not expect the end of the\nlitigation against the United States under the FTCA to\nmark the beginning of the litigation against the\nemployee in his personal suit.\nAnd -- and respondents offer the example of\nthe postal carrier as one of those quintessential cases\nthat Congress meant to address. But, of course, the\npostal exception to the FTCA, another exception in\n2680, 2680(b), would bar many claims against the United\nStates relating to a postal carrier's misdirection of\nthe mail. Now, respondents would have the Court\nbelieve that if that suit was brought against the\nUnited States and the United States was found not to be\nliable because of that exception, that the plaintiffs\nwere free -- and Congress intended that the plaintiff\nbe free -- to then go sue the poor mail carrier himself\npersonally.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about 2679(b)(2) of\nthe Westfall Act which says the Government doesn't get\nsubstituted for the employee in a Bivens claim?\nWestfall -- the Congress was -- was quite concerned, it\nseems, with preserving an action brought for violation\nof the Constitution of the United States.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: With respect to\nsection 2676, Bivens claims today, after the enactment\nof the Westfall Act, stand in the same footing as\ncommon law claims stood prior to the enactment of the\nWestfall Act. In other words, prior to Westfall, you\ncould bring a common law claim against an employee, but\nif you brought a suit against the United States, the\njudgment in that suit would bar the common law claim\nagainst the employee. In other words, the plaintiff\nhad to make a choice.\nLikewise, when Congress enacted Westfall and\nsaid you no longer have a choice with respect to common\nlaw claims, those have to be brought against the United\nStates, it left the plaintiffs with a choice with\nrespect to constitutional claims. They could choose to\npursue a Bivens remedy, but if they sue the United\nStates on those claims, the judgment and the action\nunder 1346 would be a complete bar to any action\nagainst the employee.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And if -- if they\ndecided to pursue a Bivens claims -- a Bivens claim,\ndoesn't the -- the Government often undertake the\nrepresentation of the Government employees in those\ncases?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That's right. And\nan additional concern of Congress was that the\nGovernment would be forced to defend against the suit\ntwice. In effect, the cost of litigation might be\nborne by the Government in both cases.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
