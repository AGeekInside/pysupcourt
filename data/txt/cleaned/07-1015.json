        "content": "(10:04 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear\nargument first this morning in Case 07-1015, Ashcroft\nversus Iqbal.\nGeneral Garre.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. GREGORY G. GARRE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nGENERAL GARRE: Thank you,\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:\nThis case concerns the qualified immunity of\nhigh-ranking government officials, like the Attorney\nGeneral of the United States and Director of the FBI,\nand supervisory liability claims under Bivens based on\nthe alleged wrongdoing of much lower level officials.\nIn concluding that the complaint in this\ncase was sufficient to subject the high-ranking\nofficials, like the Attorney General, to the demands of\ncivil discovery, the court of appeals erred in two\nfundamental and interrelated respects.\nFirst, the court erred in concluding that\nthe complaint stated a violation of clearly established\nrights by the former Attorney General and Director of\nthe FBI, because under this Court's precedents the\ncomplaint fails adequately to plead the personal\ninvolvement of those high-ranking officials for the\nalleged discriminatory acts of lower level officials.\nAnd, second --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: General Garre, will you\nclarify one point? You said \"fails to state\" enough to\novercome qualified immunity. But, usually, these -- the\npleading is analyzed discretely. This is a 12(b)(6)\nmotion, is it?\nGENERAL GARRE: It is a 12(b)(6) motion.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And so that tests just\nthe pleading. Qualified immunity is an affirmative\ndefense which hasn't even been stated formally. So\nisn't it entirely conceivable that you could have a good\ncomplaint judged from the 12(b)(6) point of view, but\nwhen the qualified immunity defense is asserted, the\nplaintiff isn't able to come up with enough to stave off\na summary judgment motion?\nGENERAL GARRE: No, for two reasons,\nJustice Ginsburg. The first is that this Court has\nrecognized that a defense can be a basis for a motion to\ndismiss under 12(b)(6). It did so most recently in the\nJones versus Bock case. And -- and it's established\npractice in the Federal courts, in part because of this\ndecision, that appeals from the denial of a motion to\ndismiss on the ground of qualified immunity are\nappropriate.\nAnd, second, as the Second Circuit\nrecognized -- and we think it got this right -- the\nquestion of whether a complaint adequately pleads the\npersonal involvement of government officials goes\ndirectly to the question of qualified immunity -- and\nthe court of appeals said that on page 14a of its\ndecision -- because it goes to the question of whether\nthese defendants have violated any clearly established\nrights.\nAnd so the question of supervisory liability\nin this case we think is essential to the question of\nwhether or not the Attorney General and Director of the\nFBI are entitled to qualified immunity. And in denying\nthe government's -- the Petitioner's motion to dismiss\non the ground of qualified immunity, the district court\nerroneously deprived these Petitioners of the\nprotections of that important defense.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, Mr. Garre, isn't\nthere more involved here than simply derivative\nliability for the acts of others? I -- I've got a bunch\nof excerpts from the complaint, but let me just go to\none, on section -- paragraph, rather, 97. That charges\nthe defendants Ashcroft and Mueller with willfully and\nmaliciously designing a policy. It doesn't sound like\nrespondeat superior. I mean, it seems to -- to charge\nthem directly with coming up with what these people are\ncomplaining about.\nGENERAL GARRE: Well, I think that that's\nfair, Justice Souter. I mean, I think that there are\ntwo general types of allegations in this complaint. One\nset of allegations says that Petitioners came up with\nthis policy, and if you look at those allegations -- and\nI think I would point you to paragraph 69 and paragraphs\n10 and 11 -- those allegations we think describe a\npolicy which is neutral on its face, a policy of holding\npersons determined by the FBI to be of interest in\nconnection with a terribly important investigation until\nthey have been cleared.\nAnd so we think that those allegations can't\nbe enough to sustain these -- to subject these\nPetitioners to -- to civil discovery.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, why don't -- may I\njust interrupt you there? Why don't you think the\nreference here in the language I just read, to designing\na policy, includes the policy which is several times\ndescribed as being one which called for holding -- for\nArab Muslim men of certain countries of origin without\nreference to any penal purpose? I mean, that -- I think\nthat is adequately described in there as part of the\npolicy.\nGENERAL GARRE: I think if you look at the\ncomplaint, that -- that interpretation doesn't hold up.\nAnd in particular, I would point you to paragraph 48,\nwhich is on page 164a of the joint appendix -- I'm\nsorry, the petition appendix. And what that paragraph\nsays is that these allegedly discriminatory\ndeterminations, classifications, were made by FBI\nofficials in the field, not Petitioners here, the former\nAttorney General and director of the FBI. And\nimportantly, these determinations were made, quote, and\nthis comes from paragraph 48, \"without specific criteria\nor uniform classification system.\"\nAnd so that's what's going on here. You've\ngot a complaint that alleges that specific lower level\nofficials are making these determinations. That's in\nparagraphs 50 and 51. You've got a complaint alleging\nthat these determinations are being made on the basis of\nad hoc criteria. That's page 48. And then you have\nthese overarching allegations that the Attorney General\nand the Director of the FBI knew about, approved, and\ncondoned these discriminatory conduct of much lower\nlevel officials.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't -- you\ndon't dispute that, whatever the policy was, that it was\napproved and condoned by the Attorney General and the\nDirector of the FBI?\nGENERAL GARRE: We've accepted that at some\nlevel that this complaint maintains, and it's in\nparagraph 69, that there was a policy of holding\nsuspects until they -- the suspects were determined to\nbe of interest by the FBI, until they were cleared by\nthe FBI in connection with this investigation. That\npolicy we have not disputed, and that policy we think is\na -- is a factually neutral, perfectly lawful law\nenforcement response to the 9/11 attacks, resulting in\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it may -- it\nmay very well be, but isn't it, for purposes of a\ncomplaint, sufficient to raise a due process claim by\nsaying what they say? In other words, you -- you may\nhave a very good defense to it. You may have something\nthat does not ever get beyond -- get them beyond the\npoint of summary judgment. But for them simply to\ncharge that there was a policy in which they picked up\npeople and they held them until they were cleared, i.e.,\nsort of demonstrated to be innocent in some way, that at\nleast on the face of it seems to -- to state a due\nprocess problem under the Fifth Amendment, doesn't it?\nGENERAL GARRE: Not with respect to the\nPetitioners here, the former Attorney General and the\nDirector of the FBI, because -- and I think in\nevaluating --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Even -- even if, as the\nChief Justice said, they knew and condoned the policy?\nGENERAL GARRE: Well, the question is which\npolicy, what policy? And if you look at the complaint,\nI think the only policy that the allegations bear out\nwith respect to the Attorney General and the Director of\nthe FBI is a policy described in paragraph 69 of holding\nsuspects until cleared. The --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you may be -- you --\nI mean, you may be right. I think there's -- there's a\nlot of tension in the -- in the allegations here. I --\nI grant you that. But isn't the proper way to deal with\nthose tensions at this stage to file a motion for a more\ndefinite statement and find out for sure?\nGENERAL GARRE: No. I mean, certainly that\nis one option. I mean, the Court mentioned that in the\nCrawford-El case, and that's an option. But just as in\nthe Bell Atlantic case, where that was an option, too,\nand where the defendants in that case did not avail\nthemselves of their opportunity to file a motion for a\nmore definite statement, the Petitioners here did not do\nso and they were not required to do so. They had a\ndifferent option under the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure to move for dismissal under 12(b)(6). They\nexercised that option, and the complaint -- the\ncomplaint should be dismissed because it fails to state\na claim against those individuals.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The difference, it -- and\nmaybe this isn't a sufficient difference. But the\ndifference in my mind between this and Bell Atlantic was\nthat, in Bell Atlantic you had a set of allegations in\nwhich in -- in effect it was an either-or choice. There\nwere two possibilities consistent with the allegations\nin Bell Atlantic. One was a conspiracy possibility; one\nwas a -- a lawful parallel conduct possibility. And\nthere just wasn't any way to pick one as being a more\nprobable interpretation of what they were getting at.\nHere the problem is not so much an either-\nor choice as to which we are clueless, but a just\nvagueness or uncertainty. Does the -- Does the talk\nabout the -- the racial criterion go to the policy as\ndevised or the policy as implemented? And so on. And\nit seems to me that here we're -- we're in a kind of\nconceptually a squishier situation and it might be\nbetter to get a more definite statement than to say,\nwell, you -- you've got to make a choice, and there's no\nway to make a choice.\nGENERAL GARRE: That's one of the reasons\nwhy I think it's important to distinguish between the\ndifferent sets of claims. I think the general claim of\na policy of holding suspects until cleared is much more\nlike the Bell Atlantic situation, where you have got\nfactually neutral allegations, perfectly lawful law\nenforcement conduct to have a policy that says, FBI\nagents, if you determine these people are of interest,\nhold them until they are cleared so that we are not\nreleasing people that are potentially suspects or\nwrongdoers in this investigation.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: General Garre, I think\nthat the Bell Atlantic case -- and -- and I'm sure that\nJustice Souter will correct me if I'm wrong about this,\nbut most of it is about what it takes -- what are the\nessential elements of a Sherman section 1 charge. And\nthere's a big mistake that the pleaders are making; that\nis, there has to be an agreement, and they haven't\nalleged an agreement.\nThis case seems to be quite different. And\nI think you have taken Bell Atlantic, frankly, for more\nthan is there. That is, twice -- at least twice in the\nopinion, the Court says, we are not developing any\nheightened pleading rules. Form 11 is as good today as\nit was yesterday. What we are talking about is a\nmissing -- is an essential element to a substantive\nclaim for relief. I thought that's what --\nGENERAL GARRE: And we're not asking for a\nheightened pleading standard, Justice Ginsburg. I think\nwhat's missing here fundamentally is a substantive\nrequirement of the cause of action -- Bivens -- for\nsupervisory liability which is an affirmative link.\nSubsidiary allegations suggesting a plausible\naffirmative link between the discriminatory actions\nallegedly taken by much lower level officials in the\nfield and the Director of the FBI and the Attorney\nGeneral of the United States.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That -- that sounds\nlike an argument on the merits of the Bivens claim,\nrather than an argument going to qualified immunity.\nGENERAL GARRE: It -- it's not -- I mean, in\n-- in a similar way that this Court considered the scope\nof a Bivens cause of action in the Wilkie case recently\nand in the Hartman case recently. In both of those\ncases the Court recognized that the scope of the Bivens\ncause of action goes directly to the question of\nqualified immunity.\nAnd here, in order to evaluate whether the\npleadings are adequate against the Attorney General and\nthe Director of the FBI, you have to know what the\nsubstantive standard under Bivens is for a supervisory\nliability type claim. You have to know -- just as you\ndid in Bell Atlantic, you had to know the substantive\nstandard of antitrust law in this kind of context. Here\nyou have to know the substantive standard of what's\nrequired to subject the Attorney General of the United\nStates or the Director of the FBI to potential\nliability, civil damages, burdens of civil discovery,\nfor supervisory liability for the claims of much lower\nlevel officials.\nJUSTICE BREYER: How does -- how does this\nwork in an ordinary case? I should know the answer to\nthis, but I don't. It's a very elementary question.\nJones sues the president of Coca-Cola. His claim is the\npresident personally put a mouse in the bottle. Now, he\nhas no reason for thinking that. Then his lawyer says:\nOkay, I'm now going to take seven depositions of the\npresident of Coca-Cola. The president of Coca-Cola\nsays: You know, I don't have time for this; there's no\nbasis. He's -- he's -- I agree he's in good faith, but\nhe's -- there is no basis. Okay, I don't want to go and\nspend the time to answer a question.\nWhere in the rules does it say he can go to\nthe judge and say, judge -- his lawyer will say -- my\nclient has nothing to do with this; there's no basis for\nit; don't make him answer the depositions, please?\nGENERAL GARRE: And I think it would be --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Where does it say that in\nthe rules?\nGENERAL GARRE: It -- it says that, as this\nCourt interpreted it, in Rule 8 of the rules, Justice\nBreyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: In Rule 8?\nGENERAL GARRE: Yes, because in Rule 8 --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I thought Rule 8 was move\nfor a more definite statement.\nGENERAL GARRE: No. Rule 8 is the -- is the\nplain statement showing entitlement to relief. It is\nthe rule interpreted in Bell Atlantic, and there the\nBell Atlantic Court said that the plaintiff had the\nobligation to show a plausible entitlement to relief.\nAnd --\nJUSTICE BREYER: He shows a plausible\nentitlement. He says -- there's no doubt it's a claim\nif the president of Coca-Cola did put the mouse in the\nbottle. It's just there is no basis for thinking that.\nGENERAL GARRE: It's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So he wants to go to the\njudge and say: I've set out a claim here; I copied it\nright out of the rules. All right? Now, what allows\nthe judge to stop this deposition?\nGENERAL GARRE: Rule 8 does, as interpreted\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: Where?\nGENERAL GARRE: -- in Bell Atlantic, because\nthat is not a plausible entitlement of a claim to relief\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But, Mr. Garre, you are\nusing the word \"plausible\" or you're taking the word\n\"plausible\" out of Bell Atlantic, I think, and you are\nusing it to mean something that probably can be proven\nto be true. Bell Atlantic drew that distinction. They\n-- the plausibility there is a plausibility that if they\nprove what they say, they will -- they will establish a\nviolation.\nGENERAL GARRE: I certainly agree with you.\nYou don't have to show that it probably is, but you have\nto show facts suggesting -- above the speculative level.\nAnd just as in Bell Atlantic --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. I -- I think you are\nright that if somebody makes just a totally bizarre\nallegation that nobody in the world could take\nseriously, that -- that the issue can be raised.\nBut in Justice Breyer's case, the -- that --\nthat may be the case if the claim is that the president\nof Coke was -- was personally putting mouses in bottles.\nBut the claim, it seems to me, that the Attorney General\nor the Director of the FBI was establishing a policy of\nno release until cleared or a policy that centered on\npeople with the same characteristics as the hijackers\ndoes not have that kind of bizarre character to it and,\nI think, would not run afoul of the -- of the\nplausibility standard.\nGENERAL GARRE: Well, we certainly think --\nI mean, in Bell Atlantic, the Court said common economic\nexperience would -- would support its determination in\nthat case. We think here, and I think the brief filed\nby former attorney generals from several different\nadministrations makes this point as well, that common\ngovernment experience would suggest that the Attorney\nGeneral of the United States is not involved in the sort\nof microscopic decisions --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I would agree, but\nthis is about as far from common government operation as\none can get.\nGENERAL GARRE: The -- and I think that gets\nto one of the fundamental problems with the Second\nCircuit decision, is it held the extraordinary context\nof the 9/11 attacks and the aftermath of those attacks\nagainst the Petitioners in this case. And that's\nproblematic, not only from the qualified-immunity\nperspective of what it's going to be like for officials\nnext time they have to --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, I know, but the courts\ncan't --\nGENERAL GARRE: -- deal with something like\nthat.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The courts can't ignore the\nextraordinary circumstances, either.\nGENERAL GARRE: But it's problematic because\nyou have to look at the reality of the job of the\nAttorney General of the United States and the Director\nof the FBI. In general, these are people who are\nresponsible not only for the litigating divisions within\nthe Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation, the Drug Enforcement Agency, enforcing\ncountless laws. These are people who have\nextraordinarily busy schedules. And ordinary --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm sorry, I just don't\nhave the answer to my question. I must not have said it\nproperly. Imagine, way before Twombly -- these rules\nhave been in existence for decades. So we go back years\nago. Certainly, there have been many cases where, for\nwhatever reasons, the plaintiffs included allegations\nthat were just factually very unlikely. I want to know\nwhere the judge has the power to control discovery in\nthe rules. That's -- I should know that. I can't\nremember my civil procedure course. Probably, it was\ntaught on day 4.\n(Laughter.)\nGENERAL GARRE: Well, Rule 26 governs\ndiscovery, Justice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I see that. It says\na person has a right to go and get discovery. It\ndoesn't say they only control it under certain\nprovisions which don't seem to me to apply to the truly\nabsurd discovery. There must be some power a judge has.\nAnd the second question I'm going to ask\nyou, when you tell me what that power is, which\napparently I'm not going to find out -- but -- but\nwhatever that power is, which must be there, why doesn't\nthat work to solve your problem?\nGENERAL GARRE: Well, the power to -- to\ngovern discovery doesn't solve the problem for the same\nreason that it didn't in Bell Atlantic. The Court\nspecifically said we are not going to rely on district\ncourts to weed out potentially meritless claims because\nwe recognize the burdens that discovery can impose in\nthe civil and in trust contexts. And those burdens are\nmultiplied many times here where you are talking about\nsubjecting to -- subjecting high level government\nofficial to the burdens of civil discovery.\nI think fundamentally we think you don't get\nto the question of how do district judges control\ndiscovery, because they haven't gotten through the\ngateway of pleading an adequate claim. And if I can\ngive you the substantive rule that we think is on point\nhere -- this Court, in the Rizzo case, which is a\nsection 1983 case, considered the question of claims\nagainst high-ranking officials, the Mayor of the City of\nPhiladelphia, the Police Commissioner of the City of\nPhiladelphia, for alleged wrongdoing by individual\npolice officers there.\nAnd there -- in that case, the Court held\nthat a plaintiff under section 1983 has to establish, as\na matter of law, an affirmative link between the acts of\nthe -- the subordinates and the higher-level officials.\nAnd we think that that substantive rule in section 1983\nat a minimum carries over to the Bivens context.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, what -- I mean, my\nbasic question, which I really want to hear the answer\nto, is the Attorney General is very busy and what he\ndoes is very important. The president of Coca-Cola is\nvery busy. The president of General Motors is very busy\n-- and very busy at the moment. And what he --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: What they are doing is very\nimportant. There are quite a few people in this country\nwho aren't even in the government, and what they do is\nvery important and they are very busy. And so if there\nis something in these rules that allows people to bring\nsuits without any factual foundation, even though the --\nthe complaint says there is --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How about --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'll bet those people are\nbeing harassed --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How about Rule 11 to take\ncare of Justice Breyer's problem? The judge would say\nto the lawyer: Now, you signed this pleading, and when\nyou made -- you signed it, you made certain\nrepresentations, and I'm going to read the Riot Act to\nyou if it turns out that this is a frivolous petition.\nGENERAL GARRE: Sure. That's one\nprotection, Justice Ginsburg. And --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Reading the Riot --\nGENERAL GARRE: And this Court --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Reading the Riot Act\nto the lawyer is protection against the Attorney General\nand the Director of the FBI after they're hauled in for\ndiscovery or subjected to depositions and the judge\nfinds out --\nGENERAL GARRE: We --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry, Mr.\nGarre.\n-- the judge finds out that there wasn't in\nfact a sufficient basis for it, and that -- that will\nshow them, if they get read the Riot Act by a judge?\nGENERAL GARRE: It's certainly not adequate\nprotection, Mr. Chief Justice.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I was responding to\nJustice Breyer's Coca-Cola president. I think Rule 11\nwould work quite well to answer that.\nGENERAL GARRE: I would have thought that\nthis Court's decision in Bell Atlantic put an end to\nthose sorts of claims where the court --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, Mr. Garre, it seems\nto me you are really arguing -- I am very sympathetic to\nthe argument -- that if there was no plausible claim in\nBell Atlantic, in which there was a direct allegation of\na conspiracy in violation of section 1, was rejected\nbecause the Court thought it implausible, a fortiori\nthis claim is implausible because it's got exactly the\nsame problems in that you don't want to subject these\nimportant people to all the inconvenience of discovery.\nIt seems to me these cases are very, very similar.\nGENERAL GARRE: Absolutely, Justice Stevens.\nAnd certainly that's our position. We think it's --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, in both of the\ncases, the job of the district judge would have been\nmade much easier if one of the defendants had filed an\naffidavit denying those allegations, but nobody has done\nthat in either case.\nGENERAL GARRE: No one did it in either\ncase, but in both cases the defendants are entitled to\ndismissal. I think this case is even stronger, not only\nbecause we think that the factual allegations are less\nplausible, but because we have the substantive rule of\nlaw that comes from Bivens, that you have to establish\nthe affirmative link of alleged wrongdoing between much\nlower level officials, the FBI agents in the field here.\nAnd the Attorney General of the United States and the\nDirector of the FBI, common experience shows, simply\naren't involved in those sorts of granular decisions.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I have two questions -- I\nhave two questions that might be related. You began by\nsaying that you had two points for us.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You said the first was\nthat the court erred in saying that there was a -- a\nviolation had been alleged.\nGENERAL GARRE: And --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And I wanted to reach the\nsecond, and I was wondering if the second would address\nthis sub-question that I have. If we were to say that\nTwombly is to be confined to the antitrust and\ncommercial context, would -- would that destroy your\ncase?\nGENERAL GARRE: Well, let me answer both\nthose questions: First, the second point I wanted to\nadd is interrelated with the first, and that's that the\ncourt of appeals applied an overly expansive conception\nof the supervisory liabilities available under Bivens.\nAnd, I think, in order to evaluate the adequacy of the\npleadings, this Court has to have in mind the standards\nof supervisory liability that Bivens applied. And we\nthink the that court of appeals applied an overly\nexpansive concept of that under Rizzo and other -- the\nother precedents we cite in our case.\nAnd second: No, our case would not go away\nif this Court got rid of Bell Atlantic or if this Court\nlimited Bell Atlantic to the antitrust context. We\ndon't think the Court should do that. When the Court\ndispensed -- disavowed the broad no-set-of-facts\nlanguage from Conley v. Gibson, we took the Court to be\nsaying: We are disavowing that for all cases under Rule\n8; we are not limiting it to parallel conduct in the\nsection 1 of the Sherman Act context.\nSo I think that Bell Atlantic's explication\nof Rule 8 and the disavowal of the no-set-of-facts\nlanguage, which, after all, is the test under which the\ndistrict court had to resort to, to sustain the claims\nin this case --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I do have the same\nlingering doubts as Justice -- or concerns or questions\nas Justice Breyer. It's hard for me to believe we had\nto wait for Twombly in order to have this, and it seems\nto me Rule 11 is not applicable here because it simply\nworks after the fact.\nGENERAL GARRE: Well, we don't think you had\nto wait for Twombly to get rid of those claims. We\nthink that many of those claims would dismiss. They\ncertainly would have been dismissed in the section 1983\ncontext under this Court's decision in Rizzo.\nAnd we could talk about what it would be\nlike for claims against the president of Coca-Cola or\nFord Motor Company, but really we're here talking about\nclaims against the highest level officials of our\ngovernment, who everyone agrees are entitled to the\ndoctrine of qualified immunity, a doctrine that was\ndesigned, at the end of the day, to protect the\neffective functioning of our government. These\nofficials are entitled at least to the protections that\nthis Court found appropriate for civil antitrust\ndefendants.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: General Garre, there was\na reference, I think, in Judge Gleason's decision in the\nEastern District to the Office of the Inspector General\nreport on the detainees' treatment at the Metropolitan\nDetention Center. Is there nothing in those reports\nthat lends some plausibility to Iqbal's claims?\nGENERAL GARRE: We don't think so,\nJustice Ginsburg. I mean, most fundamentally,\nextra-record materials, extra-complaint materials can't\nmake up for the deficiencies in the complaint itself.\nPlaintiffs had the benefit of that 200-page report when\nthey brought their action in this case. They have\namended their complaint twice already. And so, in that\nrespect, they are in a much better position than the\ntypical plaintiffs.\nAnd, secondly, if you look at that report,\nif you want to go outside the record and look at that\nreport, I would urge you to look at page 70 of the\nreport, which says that \"we found\" -- and I am quoting\nfrom the report -- \"we found that the information\nprovided to high-level officials suggested this 'hold\nuntil cleared' policy was being applied to persons\n'suspected of being involved in the'\" 9/11 attacks, a\nperfectly lawful law enforcement program. And it goes\non to say that \"in practice the policy may have been\napplied differently in the field. \"\nAnd the other pages I would point you to are\npages 18, 40, 47, and 158, which make clear that this --\nthe alleged discriminatory acts were -- were taken on an\nad hoc basis. That's what the complaint in this case\nsays on page 48, where it says that FBI officials, far\nremoved from the Attorney General and the Director of\nthe FBI, were making these determinations without\ncriteria, without a uniform classification system.\nAnd we think that to go back up the chain to\nsuggest that the Attorney General of the United States\nand Director of the FBI may be potentially subject to\ncivil liability, the burdens of civil litigation goes\nfar beyond Rule 8 as it's described in Bell Atlantic,\nfar beyond this Court's qualified immunity cases.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Garre, can I ask you a\nfactual question because I really don't know? In the --\nassume that -- that they had to go to trial on this\ncase, which may not be the case. Would they be entitled\nto be defended by the Department of Justice or would\nthey have to get private counsel?\nGENERAL GARRE: They are being defended by\nthe Department of Justice, the -- the Attorney General\nand Director of the FBI.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And that applies even if\nthere would be a trial later on?\nGENERAL GARRE: Yes, and that's a\ndiscretionary determination that has been made in this\ncase.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I see.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there other\nlitigation, General Garre, pending with respect to the\ndetentions?\nGENERAL GARRE: Yes, there are other claims.\nThere are also claims that have been made. And we cite\none of these cases, the Twitty case, which we cite in\nour reply.\nThis case involved a prisoner who claimed\nthat he was transferred one -- from one prison to the\nnext for a retaliatory motive. They included a claim\nagainst the Attorney General of the United States. And\nthe district court said: Well, under the Iqbal\nclaim that -- under the Iqbal case, that case can go\nforward, and potentially the Attorney General can be\nsubject to civil -- to civil discovery, which I think\nunderscores Judge Cabranes's point that the decision in\nthis case is a blue point -- is a blueprint for civil\nplaintiffs who are challenging the implementation of\nimportant law enforcement policies to subject the\nAttorney General, the Director of the FBI, or other\nhigh-level officials to civil discovery based on\nconclusory and generally -- and general and inadequate\nallegations. If I could --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there -- is there a\nTort Claims Act action pending or -- I don't know where\nI got that impression -- arising out of these\ndetentions?\nGENERAL GARRE: There are tort claims,\nFederal Tort Claims Acts, asserted in this case, and\nthere's other parallel litigation going on in the Second\nCircuit, Justice Ginsburg.\nIf I could reserve the remainder of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.\nGENERAL GARRE: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Reinert.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ALEXANDER A. REINERT\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. REINERT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI think I should start with paragraph 69 of\nthe complaint because I think Petitioners' treatment of\nparagraph 69 shows why they have no coherent theory of\nwhat a conclusory allegation is and what it's not.\nBecause what does paragraph 69 do? It sets out a\npolicy, and it says that Petitioners approved the\npolicy. Paragraph 96 does exactly the same thing.\nParagraph 69 you can find at 168 of the appendix;\nparagraph 96 you can find at 172 to 173.\nIn both -- in both cases it does the same\nthing. We have Petitioners approving a policy. Now,\nPetitioners here conceded at oral argument, contrary to\ntheir reply brief but consistent with their opening\nbrief, that paragraph 69 states a factual allegation.\nSo if paragraph 69 states a factual allegation that is\nentitled to be considered true, then paragraph 96 states\na factual allegation that is entitled to be considered\nto be true.\nThis isn't -- this case is not about ad hoc\ndecisions made at the low level of the Department of\nJustice. This is about a policy approved with the\nknowledge of Petitioners that discriminated against\ndetainees.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, General Garre said\nthere's no question that there was a policy, and that it\nwas known by and approved by the Petitioners here, but\nthat the policy is different from the policy that you\nallege.\nMR. REINERT: Well, Justice --\nJUSTICE ALITO: And that's the question.\nWhere -- what do you think is the most\nspecific allegation in your complaint as to the\nPetitioners' knowledge and approval of the -- of an\nillegal policy?\nMR. REINERT: Well, paragraph 96\nspecifically alleges knowledge, and Rule 9(b) says you\ncan allege knowledge generally. So that -- we have\nestablished knowledge of the policy. The policy is\ndescribed between paragraphs 47 and 94 of the complaint.\nJUSTICE ALITO: As to paragraphs 96 and 97,\nwhich did seem to be the most specific, are those based\non any specific information that you have concerning\nPetitioners, or are they based on inferences that you\nthink you can draw from your allegations about what\nhappened and the nature of the responsibilities of the\nPetitioners?\nMR. REINERT: They are based in -- they are\nbased in part on the Office of Inspector General's\nreport about what happened after September 11th. They\nalso are based on other information that we gathered in\nadvance of filing the -- the complaint. But, Your\nHonors, what we think Petitioners are asking us to do\nhere --\nJUSTICE ALITO: I'm not sure that really\nanswered my question. Are they based on anything\nspecific that you know about what the Petitioners did?\nMR. REINERT: Yes. We know that Petitioners\nordered a -- ordered to have certain groups targeted for\nquestioning, for detention. That's all in -- some of\nthat's in the Office of the Inspector General's report;\nsome of that is in public documents referred to by some\nof the amicus briefs. We think --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you suggesting\nGeneral Garre's statement he just made to us -- he said\nthere's nothing in the Office of the Inspector General's\nreport that suggests that the Attorney General or the\nhead of the FBI were engaged in any wrongdoing?\nMR. REINERT: Oh, I don't think that's\ncorrect, Your Honor. I mean, the Office of the\nInspector General's report says that from the -- from\nthe Department of the Attorney General -- from the\nAttorney General's Office, there was a direction to make\nthe conditions of confinement as harsh as possible.\nThat was -- that was directed to the -- BOP\nDirector Sawyer. It said, we don't want them to be able\nto get access to Johnny Cochran, for instance. That\nstatement was made.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's a\nlittle bit different -- if I could interrupt you -- than\nsaying, make the conditions of confinement as harsh as\npossible. It's saying, make the conditions of\nconfinement such that they will not be able to\ncommunicate with alleged -- alleged -- other prisoners\nthat -- that might be part of the same group connected\nwith the activities on 9/11.\nMR. REINERT: Well -- and certainly, Your\nHonor, we have also -- I mean, we have -- this case is\nat a funny posture, right, because we have all this\ndiscovery that we have obtained since the complaint was\nfiled which, we think, confirms the allegations in this\ncomplaint.\nNow, we think Petitioners' position would\nrequire us to allege facts at the complaint stage that\nwe could only obtain through discovery. But, Your\nHonors, some of --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you -- you could have\nsaid the same thing about the existence of a conspiracy\nin -- in the antitrust case. I mean, that was the\nargument. How can we prove an agreement until we have\ndiscovery?\nMR. REINERT: Well, the difference --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We say you need something\nmore in order to go forward, something more than, you\nknow, you prevented these people from talking to Johnny\nCochran. That's not going to do it.\nMR. REINERT: Well, but, Justice Scalia, the\ndifference between this case and Bell Atlantic is\nexactly what Justice Souter alluded to in his colloquy\nwith General Garre, which is that in -- in Bell Atlantic\nthere were two possible -- there were two possibilities.\nA reviewing court was basically left in equipoise,\nlooking at the complaint in Bell Atlantic.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, there are two\npossibilities here. Number one is the possibility that\nthere was a general policy adopted by the high-level\nofficials which was perfectly valid and that whatever\ndistortions you are complaining about was in the\nimplementation by lower level officials. That's one\npossibility.\nThe other possibility, which seems to me\nmuch less plausible, is that the -- the high-level\nofficials themselves directed these -- these\nunconstitutional and unlawful acts.\nMR. REINERT: Well, Your Honor, we have two\ndifferent theories, right. One is knowledge of and\napproval of, and the other is direction.\nBut those -- both of those possibilities are\nunlawful possibilities. The question is who is\nresponsible? Now, Bell Atlantic doesn't -- doesn't\nprohibit plaintiffs from pleading cases in the\nalternative. And if you are going to plead cases in the\nalternative, it's possible, of course, that some people\nwill ultimately be held responsible and some won't. But\nthe --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you agree that --\nto follow up on Justice Breyer's questioning of General\nGarre, do you believe that the same pleading standards\napply in the action against the president of Coca-Cola\nas apply to the actions of the Attorney General and\nDirector of the FBI on the evening of September 11,\n2001?\nMR. REINERT: Certainly, Your Honor, I think\nthe same pleading standards apply.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry?\nCertainly or certainly not?\nMR. REINERT: Certainly, Your Honor, I think\nthe same pleading standards apply. To the extent\nPetitioners seek protection, the protection is through\nthe -- through the doctrine of qualified immunity. And\nthey have that protection.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, why -- why isn't the\nprotection -- I have the number of the rule I want.\nMaybe I am not understanding it. But Rule 26(e)(2),\nsays -- says, among other things, that the judge can\nchange the number of depositions you get. He could\nreduce them to zero if, for example, he decides the\nburden or the expense outweighs the likely benefit.\nCan't he do that whether you are the president of Coca-\nCola or whether you are the president of Ford or whether\nyou are the President, or you are the Attorney General?\nMR. REINERT: Well, certainly --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can he do that or not?\nMR. REINERT: No -- Justice Breyer, yes, a\ndistrict court judge can do that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, he can.\nMR. REINERT: In fact, the Second Circuit\ndirected the district court to do that here. I mean,\nPetitioners argue as if discovery is impending against\nthem. In fact, the Second Circuit's opinion quite\nclearly says, you don't get discovery against\nPetitioners unless you get discovery from lower level\nofficials that confirm the need to have discovery from\nPetitioners.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I mean, that's\nlovely, that -- that the -- the ability of the Attorney\nGeneral and Director of the FBI to -- to do their jobs\nwithout having to litigate personal liability is\ndependent upon the discretionary decision of a single\ndistrict judge. I mean, I thought that the protection\nof qualified immunity gave them -- gave them more than\nthat.\nMR. REINERT: Your -- Your Honor, it gives\nthem quite a bit, Justice Scalia, and they got --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't give them much,\nif that's all it gives them.\nMR. REINERT: Well, Justice Scalia, in this\ncase what they were permitted to argue was that the law\nwas not clearly established. They argued that; they\nlost that. They were permitted to argue that they were\n-- they acted objectively reasonably. They argued that;\nthey lost that. They didn't petition for cert on either\nof those questions. So they have been given the\nprotections afforded by qualified immunity. What they\ndon't get because of qualified immunity is extra\nprotections not described in the rules, not approved by\nCongress, not referred to by this Court in any -- in any\nway.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the pleading\nstandard -- let's leave the president of Coca-Cola out\nof it. The local manager of the Coca-Cola distribution\ncenter, you can state that the same rigor required in\nthe complaint that applies to him also applies to the\nAttorney General and the Director of the FBI in the wake\nof 9/11?\nMR. REINERT: Your Honor --\nMr. Chief Justice, the pleading standard isn't\ndifferent. The substantive standard of liability may be\ndifferent, and that's certainly true. I mean, one has\nto allege much more to allege a claim on --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But your -- your\nresponse then focuses solely on the merits of the\nunderlying claim, not any requirement of -- of\nheightened pleading.\nMR. REINERT: That's correct, Your Honor,\nand we think that this Court has rejected heightened\npleading at every instance. I mean, even in Bell\nAtlantic, this Court rejected heightened pleading, and\nthis Court has rejected heightened pleading even in --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well I thought --\nand others may know better in connection to Bell\nAtlantic, but I thought in Bell Atlantic what we said is\nthat there's a standard, but it's an affected by the\ncontext in which the allegations are made. That was a\ncontext of a particular type of antitrust violation and\nthat affected how we would look at the complaint. And\nhere, I think you at least accept, don't you -- or I\nunderstood from your answers to the question on Coca\nCola that maybe you don't -- that because we're looking\nat litigation involving the Attorney General and the\nDirector of FBI in connection with their national\nsecurity responsibilities, that there ought to be\ngreater rigor applied to our examination of the\ncomplaint.\nMR. REINERT: Well, Mr. Chief Justice,\nthere's no reference to that in the rules. We think\nqualified immunity provides the protection that\nPetitioners are seeking. And we think what the Second\nCircuit did was balance a very difficult -- difficult\nprinciples on both sides.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you -- do you\ndisagree with the notion that Bell Atlantic at least\nestablished that the level of pleading required depends\non the context of the claim -- the context of the\nparticular case?\nMR. REINERT: I don't -- I don't understand\nBell Atlantic to argue that the level of pleading\nrequires -- depends on the context of the case, but that\nthe substantive liability that is in the background of\nthe case affects what you have to plead. And what\nPetitioners are asking is to take the substantive\nbackground of an affirmative defense and make that\naffect the ability -- what you have to plead, not --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But they pleaded a\nconspiracy -- they pleaded a conspiracy in Bell\nAtlantic. It wasn't a matter of not -- not setting\nforth in the complaint the substance of what produced\nliability. They pleaded conspiracy.\nMR. REINERT: Well, what this Court --\nJustice Scalia, what this Court said in Bell Atlantic,\nto the extent it disregarded the allegation about\nagreement -- it said the problem with the agreement was\nthat it didn't allege what, it didn't allege who, it\ndidn't allege when. And I don't think it can be said\nabout this complaint. This alleges who, this alleges\nwhat it was, this alleges --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: When?\nMR. REINERT: -- when it occurred --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Does it say when? Does it\nsay what basis?\nMR. REINERT: In the weeks after September\n11th.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know on what basis\nany of these allegations against the high-level\nofficials are made.\nMR. REINERT: Justice Scalia, they are made\non the basis of the information that we garnered from\nthe Office of Inspector General's report. What we know\n-- what we know about --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, we'll -- we'll check\nthat.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Reinert --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The Solicitor General\ncontests that.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I want to throw you a\nquestion. I'm not sure it's a softball question. You\ncan --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You can let me know.\nI -- I'm starting with the assumption, which\nI think is -- is in Bell Atlantic, that what we are\nconcerned with in context is that the -- the context\ntells us how specific you've got to be versus how\nconclusory you've got to be, and the reason it does so\nis that some allegations are -- are more likely to be\ntrue than others depending on the context.\nIs it fair to say -- going back to Justice\nBreyer's question, is it fair to say that your basic\npleading here rests on the following assumption: That\nit is more plausible that the Attorney General of the\nUnited States and the Director of the FBI were in fact\ndirectly involved in devising a policy with the racial\ncharacteristics and the coercive characteristics that\nyou claim, than that the President of Coca Cola was\nputting mouses in bottles?\nMR. REINERT: Well, I think that -- I think\nthat is our -- our contention, Your Honor, because it's\na -- it's an allegation about a policy.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So you would say, if -- to\nthe Coke question you would say, yes, they've got to get\nmore facts there, this is just -- this is just crazy to\nthink that the president is putting mice in the bottles.\nBut you're saying that, so far as the close\ninvolvement of the Attorney General and the FBI\ndirector, it's not crazy to assume what you -- what you\nsay, and, therefore, you don't have to get into more\ndetail in order to have an adequate claim here. Is\nthat --\nMR. REINERT: We certainly don't think it's\nabsurd or bizarre, which is the argument that the\nPetitioners raised below --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's also not\nthe --\nMR. REINERT: I'm sorry.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Absurd and bizarre\nis also not the pleading standard, and how are we -- to\nfollow up on Justice Souter's question -- how are we\nsupposed to judge whether we think it's more unlikely\nthat the president of Coca-Cola would take certain\nactions as opposed to the Attorney General of the United\nStates?\nMR. REINERT: I think it is a problem posed\nby that interpretation of Bell Atlantic. I don't think\nit's a problem that's posed by this particular case, Mr.\nChief Justice. I think --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, the problem\nwith the president of the Coca-Cola is the allegation\nprobably would be that the Coca-Cola Company has adopted\nsloppy procedures in its manufacturing lines, and the\npresident is responsible for those procedures, and\nthat's why the bottles are filled with rats.\nMR. REINERT: Well --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That's the way you would\nallege it. You wouldn't say he did it personally.\nMR. REINERT: Well, Justice Stevens --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And then you would have a\nsimilar question.\nMR. REINERT: You probably wouldn't say he\ndid it personally, and there might be a respondeat\nsuperior theory there, for liability, that we don't have\naccess to in the Bivens arena, which we concede; we have\nto establish a link between the unconstitutional conduct\nand -- and the actions of the Petitioners. So that may\nbe how it's pleaded, and that might get it closer if\nthere were -- certainly if there were a policy of\nputting mice in Coke bottles, that would certainly get\nit closer.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, this is a policy of\nbeing derelict in the sanitary conditions in the plant\nand so forth and so on; therefore, mice -- mice are\ngetting into bottles with undue frequency, and the\npresident is responsible for that. I don't see that\nthat's a fanciful allegation.\nMR. REINERT: It -- I -- I don't know that\nit is fanciful, Justice Stevens. I think --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'm not suggesting that\nCoca-Cola really does that. Of course not, but --\nMR. REINERT: No, certainly not.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But the standard theory is\nthat --\nMR. REINERT: I think -- I mean, the\nessential point in this case is that the Second Circuit\nwas faced with a dilemma. I mean, there's a liberal\npleading standard and there's qualified immunity. And\nthe Second Circuit tried to resolve it, did I think a\nvery good job of resolving it with the interests -- all\nof the interests that Petitioners are concerned about.\nThey were --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, they weren't \"all\"\ncompletely -- they were not --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I was just going to\nsay the -- the difficulty with wrestling with the case\nthrough the perspective of the hypothetical of the mice\nin the bottles is that it's -- it's by its nature\nparticularly absurd, but what if the allegation is that\nthe president of Coca Cola is individually involved in a\nparticular price-fixing scheme? Then does this case\nseem so terribly different from the level of specificity\nBell Atlantic would require?\nMR. REINERT: Well, I guess I want to\ndistinguish that allegation from the allegations here.\nWe are not alleging that the Petitioners individually\nidentified particular detainees as of interest or as of\nhigh interest. We are alleging that they either created\nthe policy or they knew of and approved of it.\nNow -- now, we could talk about \"knew of and\napproved.\" As I said, under Rule 9(b), \"knew of\" is\nestablished by a saying that they knew it; we can't read\n9(b) any other way, and Petitioners don't suggest that\nwe do.\nSo then we have \"approved.\" Now, if they\nknew it, right, if we accept that they knew about this\npolicy, and we also accept paragraph 69 as Petitioners\nconcede we must accept it to be true, then we know that\nthey knew that there was this policy occurring and they\napproved the policy of not releasing them --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's easy. I\nhope that the Attorney General and the Director of FBI\n-- of the FBI knew of and approved whatever the policy\nwas. What you have to show is some facts, or at least\nwhat you have to allege are some facts, showing that\nthey knew of a policy that was discriminatory --\nMR. REINERT: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- based on\nethnicity and country of origin.\nMR. REINERT: And I think I was -- I was\ntrying to get there, Mr. Chief Justice, and the way I\nwould say it is this: We've alleged that they knew, in\nparagraph 96, that the policy was discriminatory.\nThat's clearly alleged in paragraph 96. We've also\nalleged that they approved the policy.\nThe link -- to the extent that approval is\nnot sufficient for this Court, the link between approval\nin 96 and an allegation is paragraph 69, because if they\nknew that these individuals were being detained in\nrestrictive conditions of confinement because of their\nrace, religion, and national origin, as we alleged in\n96, and they also approved that they should not be\nreleased until cleared, then they are approving them\nbeing held in restrictive conditions of confinement\nbased upon race, religion, and national origin.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, but they didn't -- that\nisn't what 96 says. What 96 says, which I think is\nimportant, is it says that they knew of and agreed to\nsubject the plaintiffs to these harsh conditions solely\non account of their religion, race, and national origin,\nand for no legitimate penological interest. Because, if\nthey are looking for suspects from 9/11, given the\npeople they found, it's not surprising that they might\nlook for people who looked like Arabs. All right? That\nisn't surprising to me, because that was what the\nsuspects looked like.\nSo, they want to say, yes, that was part of\nit, but it's not for no legitimate penological interest;\nit was for every good reason: We didn't want more bombs\nto go off.\nNow, suppose that's their view. Suppose\nalso -- I'm just hypothetically -- they never, and they\nknow this, ever had a conversation where they said, go\nlook for people of Arabic descent alone. They never\nsaid that. They said, look for those people who have\nother connections and had something we reasonably\nbelieve is 9/11-connected; they might be dangerous.\nSuppose that's what they thought. So they read this,\nand they think, Judge, I want to tell Judge that you\nhave no evidence to show anything other than what I just\nsaid, which sounds as if it might be reasonably\nconnected to the 9/11 investigation. What is open to\nour two defendants, if you win this case? If they're\nright, how do they prevent lots of depositions from\ncoming in and taking their time? How do they prevent\nthis case dragging on and taking their time? If the\nfacts are what I just said, rather than what you think?\nMR. REINERT: Well, Justice Breyer, if those\nare the facts, then those are facts that have to be\nestablished through discovery. They cannot be\nestablished at the pleading stage. I would think we\ncould all agree on that. And that's their -- and they\ncan do that through discovery.\nNow, at the pleading stage, if they don't\nwant to file an answer and deny the facts, they can move\nto dismiss on qualified-immunity grounds as they have.\nJUSTICE BREYER: They'll -- they'll deny the\nfacts; then you'll say there's a factual matter. And\nsuppose hypothetically -- not what you think -- but you\nhave no reason at all hypothetically, imagine, for\nbelieving that they did this solely for racial reasons\nunrelated to the investigation of 9/11. Suppose you\ndon't have any information that shows that, and they are\ngoing to say everything else is covered by qualified\nimmunity, and you have nothing else. Then what do they\ndo to get out of 10 years of discovery?\nMR. REINERT: Well, the Second Circuit gives\na clear path for defendants in that situation,\nJustice Breyer, and the answer is, if you want to make a\nRule 12(e) motion, make it; it was referred to in\nCrawford-El. But, more importantly, we don't get\ndiscovery of them. We don't get to drag them through\ndiscovery unless --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I just interrupt?\nThere are a whole bunch of other defendants in this\ncase. As I understand it, they're still in the case.\nMR. REINERT: That's correct.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So you do have discovery\nof maybe 25 to 30 officials who would have a lot of\ninformation about this case. It seems to me it's\nentirely possible that you could either postpone\ndiscovery and dismiss the two principal defendants for\nnow and then bring them in later, if the facts you\ndevelop from the other discovery would prove what you\nhave alleged.\nMR. REINERT: Well, as to postponing\ndiscovery, that's exactly what the Second Circuit\ndirected the district court to do. So that's been done,\nYour Honor.\nAs to dismissing them and re-filing later,\nthe problem with that is there could be a statute of\nlimitations problem, and that -- so that's just not a\nsolution. I mean, that's -- that was a solution that\nmight result ultimately in absolute immunity in these\nkinds of cases.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What is the statute of\nlimitations that would apply?\nMR. REINERT: It's 3 years here, Your Honor.\nAnd so we've -- we've obtained discovery. Now, if it\nhad been -- if this --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You have -- you have not\nhad discovery from the Attorney General or --\nMR. REINERT: Certainly not.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So --\nMR. REINERT: Certainly not.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So it's -- it's as though\ndiscovery with respect to those two defendants was\nstayed pending your discovery from the lower level\ndefendants?\nMR. REINERT: In fact, it has been formally\nstayed, Justice Ginsburg --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Has it?\nMR. REINERT: And the Second Circuit's\ndecision confirms that. I mean, the --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, that may be what\nhappened here, but if -- if the Second Circuit is\naffirmed, there may be other suits that are like this.\nAnd what is the protection of the high-level official\nwith qualified immunity with respect to discovery if the\n-- the official cannot get dismissal under qualified\nimmunity at the 12(b)(6) stage? How many district\njudges are there in the country? Over 600? One of the\ndistrict judges has a very aggressive idea about what\nthe discovery should be. What's the protection there?\nMR. REINERT: Well, if this Court --\nJUSTICE ALITO: It's a discretionary\ndecision, interlocutory discretionary decision by the\ntrial judge.\nMR. REINERT: Well, if -- Justice Alito, if\nthis Court in affirming the Second Circuit outlines and\nsays the Second Circuit took the proper steps -- this is\nwhat the district court should do -- then if any\ndistrict court disregards that, then there could be a\npetition for mandamus. And that's -- and I think courts\nof appeals would respect this Court's opinion if this\nCourt said, look, here's the dilemma, here's the best\nway to resolve it.\nI do want to make a point about the -- I do\nwant to make one jurisdictional point, Your Honor --\nYour Honors, and that is, if Petitioners had raised\nthese arguments in the context of a motion to dismiss\nfor failure to state a claim, and they had lost, we\nwouldn't be here today, right? There would be no\njurisdiction. And Johnson v. Jones, I think, makes\nclear that you can't bootstrap jurisdiction by referring\nto qualified immunity.\nAnd, in fact, if you look at Petitioners'\nNotice of Motion to Dismiss, point 1 is dismiss for\nqualified immunity; point 2 is dismiss because it does\nnot sufficiently allege personal involvement. That is,\nin their notice of motion itself, they separated out\nthese two issues.\nNow, in their briefing at all the lower\ncourts and in this Court, they've elided them. But our\nposition on -- on jurisdiction is that there is no --\nthere is no appellate jurisdiction to -- to deal with\nthis question, and in fact Petitioners' own motion\nsuggests that these two issues are separable and that\nthe only issue here is whether or not clearly\nestablished law applied and the objective reasonableness\nof Petitioners' conduct. And that, we think, is another\nway of resolving the case.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: May I ask you this\nquestion? And -- and I ask it, you know, mindful of\nwhat you've just said, but I -- I'm not sure that the\ntwo issues can be kept as -- as separated as you\nsuggest.\nAnother avenue to responding to the problem,\nI think, that Justice Breyer's last hypo raised would be\nas follows -- and then I'll tell you the difficulty that\nI have with it, and I was going ask you to comment on\nthe difficulty.\nHe said that the -- the allegation -- one\nway to read the allegation, and I think a fair way, is\nto say that the Attorney General and the Director of the\nFBI devised a policy and condoned the implementation of\na policy that was based on racial and religious grounds\nwith no penological purpose. Well, under the\ncircumstances of immediate post-9/11, it is not\nsurprising necessarily that they -- they devised a\npolicy that had reference to religion and national\norigin and so on, given what we knew about the\nhijackers.\nWhat is not so easy to accept, as a matter\nof adequate pleading, is the claim that there was no\npenological interest involved in the decision of how\nto and how long to hold the individuals who were picked\nup.\nOne answer to that, which I think is -- is\nin your pleadings, is that you refer to specific\nindividuals and in particular to your own client, who\nwas in the position of being held under these conditions\nfor a considerable period of time, and it turns out\nthere's -- there's no indication that there was\nultimately a justified penological interest.\nSo that might be your answer to\nJustice Breyer's question. There's enough in here about\nspecific detentions to make it plausible for pleading\nstandards that they were being held without any\npenological interest.\nThe difficulty I have with that line of\nthinking is this: You also allege in there that lower\nlevel officials were making decisions on an ad hoc basis\nwithout adequate criteria as to -- as to how they should\nmake them. And that particular line of allegations\nsuggests that what was really going on here, including\nwhat was happening to your client, wasn't the result of\n-- of clear policy decisions made by the Attorney\nGeneral and the Director of the FBI, but they -- they\nwere just being scattered. So, what in the context of\nyour whole pleading makes it adequate simply to charge\non a conclusory basis that these two defendants were\ndevising a policy that had -- that was intended to have\nan effect of no penological interest?\nMR. REINERT: Well, Your Honor,\nJustice Souter, I do think that in this way the OIG\nreport is very instructive. It basically confirms that\nnone of the folks who were held as of interest or as\nhigh interest were ever charged or suspected of being\ninvolved in terrorism. That was well over 700 people.\nAs for paragraph 48 --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Did -- you'll have to help\nme out. Did you allege that?\nMR. REINERT: We alleged that many -- like\nmany -- plaintiffs, like many detainees, were held for\nno reason.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. That's what you're\nsaying --\nMR. REINERT: That's what we alleged.\nAnd in paragraph 48, I just want to say that\ndoes not support the view that there was no racial\ncriteria here. What it -- paragraph 48 is immediately\nfollowed by paragraph 49, which says the classifications\nwere made because of race. Paragraph 48 is saying the\ndistinction between \"of interest\" and \"of high interest\"\nwas totally arbitrary. But that's just a way of saying\nthat this was a racial classification policy. It was a\nracial classification policy that resulted in harsh\nconditions of confinement for our client and for many\nindividuals. And now we have alleged Petitioners'\nconnection to that. You know, we could say --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Are you -- are you saying\nthat the -- that the claim that there was no penological\ninterest for certain decisions goes simply to the\ndistinction between the decision whether to classify as\n\"of interest\" versus as \"of high interest\"?\nMR. REINERT: No, Your Honor, I think\nit's -- I think it's very difficult for us to say in a\ncomplaint anything other than no -- no legitimate\npenological interest, because we couldn't go through the\ncomplaint proving all the negatives. The fact is our\nclient posed no threat that connected to 9/11. We\nalleged that. We alleged that's true of multiple\ndetainees, and we think that's sufficient to say that\nthere was no penological interest. Now, Petitioner --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is -- is no penological\ninterest enough?\nMR. REINERT: Oh --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, is that the only\nbasis -- after an attack on the country of the magnitude\nof 9/11, is that the only basis on which people could be\nheld? Namely that these people are the -- are the\nguilty culprits, and we are going to put them in jail?\nMR. REINERT: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Surely for at least a\nperiod, you can hold people just -- just to investigate?\nMR. REINERT: Well, Justice Scalia, I don't\nthink for a period it's constitutional to hold them\nsolely based on their race, religion, and national\norigin. And if it is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it wasn't solely on\nthat.\nMR. REINERT: Well, that is the allegation.\nIf it is, that's an issue to be dealt on the merits,\nexactly as this Court did in Johnson v. California.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But the net was surely not\ncast wide enough if anybody with that race, religion was\n-- was swept in.\nMR. REINERT: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, if it's solely for\nthat reason, there would have been hundreds of thousands\nof others.\nMR. REINERT: Justice Scalia, that is the\nallegation in the complaint, that as individuals were\nencountered --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- implausible.\nMR. REINERT: We respectfully disagree with\n-- about that, Justice Scalia. But I would say\nthat with --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Wasn't it limited to\npeople who were already indicted on other charges?\nMR. REINERT: These were people --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: We're not dealing with\nthe universe of men who are of a certain national\norigin; we are dealing with only ones who were\nincarcerated for an offense that has nothing to do with\nterrorism.\nMR. REINERT: Justice Ginsburg, these were\nindividuals who were swept up either in the immigration\ndetention system or in the justice criminal detention\nsystem, and that's where the classification was made.\nBut -- but I -- I do --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry -- swept\nup? You mean they were in -- in prison because they had\nviolated immigration and other laws, right?\nMR. REINERT: That's correct,\nMr. Chief Justice, that's correct. We don't dispute\nthat.\nBut I think this Court's decision in Johnson\nv. California and in Parents Involved is instructive,\nbecause there the Court says, look, if there is a racial\nclassification, it has to be judged under strict\nscrutiny. And even in Johnson v. California, where the\nCourt said the State's power was at its apex, which is\nin the context of their prisons, and even where there is\nan argument that we have gang violence -- we know that\nracial identity goes to gang violence to some extent --\nstill the State was put to its burden of proof of a\ncompelling State interest, and even though that was a\ncase that involved damages, it was a qualified immunity\ncase.\nAnd Johnson v. California is in many\nrespects no different from this case. Yes, the 9/11\ncontext makes a difference, and Petitioners were able to\nrely -- I'm sorry, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can finish.\nMR. REINERT: The Petitioners were allowed\nto rely on the 9/11 context in making their argument\nabout qualified immunity, about the objective\nreasonableness of their conduct, and about whether the\nlaw was clearly established. But that does not mean --\nthank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Garre, you have 3 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. GREGORY G. GARRE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nGENERAL GARRE: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice. And, first, let me clarify the record on\ndiscoveries.\nThe Second Circuit didn't hold that\ndiscovery could not go forward against these\nPetitioners. It held that the district court might --\nthat's the word it used on page 67a of the petition\nappendix -- postpone or limit discovery. So --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it -- it did happen?\nAt least it did --\nGENERAL GARRE: To the grace of the district\ncourt, that's right, and I think Judge Cabranes\nemphasized the -- the concerns of potentially vexatious\ndiscovery in this context, and we certainly\nwholeheartedly agree with that.\nSecond, I think Mr. Reinert made an\nimportant concession when he acknowledged that\nsubstantive standards of law affect what you have to\nplead. And here there are two substantive standards --\ntwo substantive issues that are key.\nOne is the standard for supervisory\nliability under Bivens, which requires that the\nplaintiff show an affirmative link between the\nwrongdoing alleged by lower level officials and the\npotential wrongdoing on the part of higher level\nofficials like the Attorney General. The complaint in\nthis case has no subsidiary facts on which a reasonable\nperson could affirm that kind of affirmative link.\nAnd, second, the -- the Attorney General is\nmuch different than the president of Coca-Cola in that\nhe is entitled to a presumption of regularity of his\nactions. So that -- that standard itself ought to\naffect how one views the complaint.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Garre, I just wanted\nto -- would you say that the -- the Attorney General\nmight be subject to taking a deposition, even if he's\nnot a defendant?\nGENERAL GARRE: Certainly we would -- we\nwould oppose that. It's conceivable they could try to\nget that discovery.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is there any -- some\nstandard rule of law that government officials don't\nhave to testify at proceedings?\nGENERAL GARRE: I don't know that there is\nthat standard, Your Honor. The same concerns --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I certainly didn't think\nthere was when I wrote Clinton v. Jones.\n(Laughter.)\nGENERAL GARRE: Fair enough, Your Honor.\nBut certainly, you know, when we think they\nare parties to the case the potential demands of civil\ndiscovery and the burdens of civil litigation are much\ngreater. Third --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And the reason you can't\nmake this argument under 26(b)(2)(C) is?\nGENERAL GARRE: Well, we are in the realm of\ndiscovery, and we are in the realm of relying on the\ndistrict court --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The judge there is supposed\nto weigh burdens versus desirability of going forward.\nAnd so why don't you make this argument right at that\npoint? If you are right you win; if not, you lose.\nGENERAL GARRE: For the reason this Court\ngave in Bell Atlantic: We don't rely on district court\njudges to weed out potentially meritless claims through\ndiscovery. We apply faithfully the pleading standards.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If you are right, you win\nassuming you get a district judge who is also right.\nGENERAL GARRE: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And that's also true, I\nguess, of complaints, and every other legal question.\nGENERAL GARRE: We think that Bell Atlantic\nanswers that question correctly, Your Honor.\nThird, context does matter. The Chief\nJustice is right about that. In evaluating the claim,\nyou have to look at the context in which it arises.\nHere the fact it arises in the qualified immunity\ncontext with respect to high-level officials is very\nimportant. The higher up the chain of command you go,\nthe less plausible it is that the high-level official\nlike the Attorney General is going to be aware of and\nknow about the sort of microscopic decisions here:\nmistreatment in the Federal detention facility in\nBrooklyn, alleged discriminatory applications made by\nFBI agents in the field.\nThese are not matters that one would\nplausibly assume the Attorney General of the United\nStates has time out of his busy day to concern himself\nwith. The Second Circuit decision should be reversed.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General\nGarre --\nGENERAL GARRE: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- Mr. Reinert.\n"
