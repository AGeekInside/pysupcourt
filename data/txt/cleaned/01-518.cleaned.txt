CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument
next in No. 01-518, the BE&K Construction Company v. the
National Labor Relations Board.
Mr. Baskin.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MAURICE BASKIN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BASKIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
This case presents an important question arising
under the Petition Clause of the First Amendment.
Petitioner BE&K Construction is asking the Court to hold
that the First Amendment protects objectively based
lawsuits from being declared unlawful by the National
Labor Relations Board.
Now, the Court has already held that the First
Amendment does protect lawsuits from statutory sanction
under both the NLRA and the antitrust laws so long as the
suits are meritorious, meaning that they are not
objectively baseless. In the Bill Johnson's case, the
Court said -- and I quote -- it is not unlawful to pursue
a meritorious lawsuit under the National Labor Relations
Act. In fact, the Court said it twice and specifically
cited the Noerr-Pennington doctrine of the antitrust law.
Then it --
QUESTION: How do you describe the test applied
by the board?
MR. BASKIN: Well, the test by the board is one
which says that the employer must be -- must prevail, must
be 100 percent prevailing in the lawsuit. As a standard
that's impossible for any employer to anticipate in
advance. No -- no employer can ever be 100 percent sure
of prevailing.
QUESTION: Should there be any other component?
I mean, I think your client lost basically. So --
MR. BASKIN: Well, the question is what was --
QUESTION: What else should be part of the test?
MR. BASKIN: The test is what is the -- was
there an objective basis for the litigation. It's not a
win-or-lose test, as the Court said in Professional Real
Estate -- and I'll quote again -- it's got to be
objectively baseless in the sense that no reasonable
litigant could realistically expect success on the merits.
QUESTION: Well, should the test from
Professional Real Estate automatically be carried over to
the Labor Relations Act?
MR. BASKIN: Well, in this case, Your Honor, an
answer is yes because the Court itself has interacted with
the -- both of the acts. They cross reference with each
other. Bill Johnson's referred directly to the California
Motor Transport. Professional Real Estate referred to
Bill Johnson's as if it's one consistent whole. And it
is.
QUESTION: Well, but I -- I wonder if -- if the
National Labor Relations Board doesn't have some
discretion to say that the labor situation is somewhat
different, as they apparently do, from the antitrust
situation.
MR. BASKIN: Well, but the irony here is that
the NLRB has not -- has not interpreted its own statute.
It's not being deferred to here. The NLRB is interpreting
this Court's decision in Bill Johnson's.
QUESTION: Which happened to say precisely what
the NLRB said it said.
MR. BASKIN: Well, no, Your Honor. In Bill --
QUESTION: If a judgment goes against the
employer in the State court, if it goes against him, then
he's had his day in court. And then the board may proceed
to adjudicate the unfair practice claim, and then the
employer's suit, having been proved unmeritorious, the
board can take that fact into account when it decides the
labor law violation.
MR. BASKIN: Three --
QUESTION: And you've been reading three cases
to us, so that seems to be the language that you have. I
-- I read that as saying you lose. Period. End of the
matter. That's what the board decides.
Now, I put that so you'll reply to it.
MR. BASKIN: Yes. Three things in the phrasing
that you just said. First, the Court said the board may
proceed, did not say it's an automatic result. Said may
adjudicate the unfair labor practice, did not say it's an
automatic result.
And then key phrase, having proved to be
unmeritorious, what does unmeritorious mean? Well, this
Court has consistently said what unmeritorious means. It
said so before Bill Johnson's in the Christiansburg case.
QUESTION: Mr. Baskin, back up a bit.
MR. BASKIN: Yes.
QUESTION: The -- the Court in that very
paragraph gave a definition of what it meant. So, I
wouldn't look outside this document for what the Court
meant by with merit/without merit when the -- look at the
sentence in the middle of that paragraph. It says if the
judgment goes against the employer and the State court.
MR. BASKIN: Yes.
QUESTION: Judgment against you. Or if his suit
is withdrawn or is otherwise shown to be without merit.
Otherwise shown to be merit. I took that to mean if you
lose, it's shown to be without merit. There may be other
situations in which it's shown to be without merit. So,
it seems to me the best place to find out what the Court
meant merit/without merit is the very opinion that we're
construing.
MR. BASKIN: Yes, and if it were the holding of
the opinion, it would have greater weight. But this is
not the holding that we're talking -- that we're parsing
out here. This is dicta because the essential --
QUESTION: Well, there are two responses to the
dicta point it seems to me. The first one is it was
dicta, but it was dicta that preceded a remand in which
this issue in fact would be explored. And the second
response is the -- as I understand it, the board itself
has followed the -- the dicta for -- I forget how many
years now, but consistently followed it and Congress has
done nothing about it. So, A, query whether it's dicta,
and B, even if it is, isn't it the kind of dicta that at
this point definitely should be followed?
MR. BASKIN: It is clearly dicta because the
Court stated what was the issue before it, and the sole
issue before it in Bill Johnson's is stated at the
beginning of the opinion, whether the NLRB may issue a
cease and desist order to halt the prosecution of a State
court civil suit brought by an employer to retaliate
against employees.
And the holding of the case, which analyzes the
First Amendment at great length, says that the right of
access to the courts is too important to be an unfair
labor practice. And it also defines meritorious as being
reasonable basis, language in the Court's opinion.
QUESTION: I think there's another element that
you're ignoring. I thought the board looked both at
whether it was a meritless lawsuit against the unions and
whether it was for a retaliatory purpose.
MR. BASKIN: Yes.
QUESTION: Isn't that the other element?
MR. BASKIN: Yes. Both elements must be
present.
QUESTION: Okay. And how do we define
retaliatory purpose? What -- what constitutes that --
MR. BASKIN: Well, it's --
QUESTION: -- do you think, in the board's rule?
MR. BASKIN: Yes. It's very -- pretty much the
same as the improper motivation purpose test that was in
the Professional Real Estate case, which also has the two-
part test. You look at the objective basis first, and
then and only then if there's no objective basis, you look
at whether there was a retaliatory motive.
And how that's defined, although the Court did
not grant cert on that issue, we contested vigorously the
-- the board's finding of retaliatory motivation here --
because in fact the board has made it a rubber stamp.
It's become automatic if the case relates in any way to
union activity, the board finds that it's retaliatory
motivation.
But the first part of the test is an objective
one that the Court has spelled out both in Bill Johnson's
itself and in Professional Real Estate. And to take any
-- to take the board's standard puts employers in an
impossible situation. It is unworkable. Going back to
the question of dicta or not, you have ambiguous language
at best because we have several different references to
meritorious throughout the Bill Johnson's opinion.
QUESTION: May I just ask this, Mr. Baskin? Do
you think there is a distinction between an ongoing case
and a completed case?
MR. BASKIN: It's one mostly as to timing and
facts available to the board, and I think that's what the
Court was --
QUESTION: But the -- in your view, the standard
is the same. It's not that the board tries to enjoin the
proceeding as -- as opposed to later on bringing an unfair
labor practice after it's over.
MR. BASKIN: The substantive standard should be
the same.
QUESTION: It should be, but --
MR. BASKIN: Should be.
QUESTION: -- do you think that Johnson says
it's the same?
MR. BASKIN: We're all here today because the
language in the tail end of the Bill Johnson's opinion is
ambiguous as to what they intended the standard to be.
QUESTION: And at least it says there's a
different standard.
MR. BASKIN: As to -- the -- the impact was --
QUESTION: And your view is there should be no
different standard.
MR. BASKIN: Correct.
QUESTION: And that's the whole key to the case.
MR. BASKIN: That really is the whole key to the
case.
QUESTION: And why not?
QUESTION: Mr. Baskin, is your -- is your
argument -- in your opening remarks, you -- you referred
only to the First Amendment. Is -- is it -- is it a
constitutional argument you're making? To -- to agree
with you here, do I have to agree that if Congress passed
a law adopting the English rule on -- on attorney's fees,
that would be unconstitutional?
MR. BASKIN: No. We are not saying that. We
are not seeking to constitutionally -- we are asking no
more than that you apply this standard to the two statutes
you've already applied it --
QUESTION: Which says -- so, it's a statutory
argument.
MR. BASKIN: No. It is a constitutional and
statutory argument, which is what the Court itself said in
both of these cases because there's a sanction involved.
QUESTION: I don't know what you mean by a -- is
it -- does the Constitution prohibit it or not?
MR. BASKIN: It prohibits a statute from
prohibiting it.
QUESTION: The Constitution prohibits. So, your
answer to my question is --
MR. BASKIN: Constitutional and statutory.
QUESTION: You -- you cannot -- that Congress
could not adopt the English rule.
MR. BASKIN: No. The difference -- here's the
important difference.
QUESTION: It would do that by statute.
MR. BASKIN: But is there an -- a declaration of
unlawfulness involved? There are many fee-shifting
statutes. We're not taking issue with mere fee-shifting,
but the National Labor Relations Board is saying that BE&K
broke the law, and that's what also happened under the
antitrust laws. They're saying -- they're issuing a cease
and desist order from filing so-called nonmeritorious
litigation.
QUESTION: But the fact that it's triple damages
is a little different than fee-shifting. So, one could
easily say, when you're exposed to treble damages,
putative damages, yes, that's a punishment. Here fee-
shifting is the rule in most countries in the world.
So, what is the more here? I understand the
more in antitrust cases, treble damages. Here you say,
well, there's a finding that you have committed an unfair
labor practice. What are the consequences in addition to
that you have to pay the other side's legal fees? What
are the adverse consequences --
MR. BASKIN: First, the most important is the
declaration that you are a law violator in and of itself.
You have to post a notice for your employees not only at
this job site but all across the country. You have your
-- your customers become aware of it. The unions
certainly make sure your customers become aware of it.
There's the serious danger of debarment either privately
or by governmental action.
QUESTION: Explain that. You did say that in
your brief about debarment, and I didn't -- I can
understand when you say someone -- someone's reputation is
affected by being labeled a law violator. But you said
something about -- about the jeopardy of debarment and I
wasn't clear how that would work.
MR. BASKIN: It's not meant in the legal sense
and the Government -- we're not -- we're not talking about
whether the Government has to debar the company, but both
private actors and many Government contracting officers
take the view they don't want to deal with people who have
been declared to be law violators. The goodwill and
reputation of the company is at stake.
QUESTION: Well, in our lower case, the --
Wisconsin set out to do that on a State basis, didn't it?
If you violated the Labor Act, the State was not going to
deal with you.
MR. BASKIN: Yes, they did. And then the
Federal Government just last -- 2 years ago in the
previous administration, had come through with a set of
rules saying that companies would be debarred if they were
found to have violated labor laws.
So, having this -- a declaration of illegality
in place is what makes this different, Justice Scalia,
from a random fee-shifting statute, and that's why we are
not asking you to do anything other than what you've
already done, which is to apply the First Amendment to two
statutes which you have determined have great commonality
over the years, as each one keeps referring back to the
other in this doctrine.
QUESTION: What do you do with the 2 decades
that have elapsed -- about 2 decades -- since Justice
White's opinion which has been interpreted by the board
the way the language most naturally reads? The one thing
is to say when the case first came out it was ambiguous.
But now we have 2 decades of consistent interpretation of
that language by the board.
MR. BASKIN: I regret to say it's a tribute to
the speed of the board's processes and the process of
getting this case up to this level on this issue because
this case alone has taken 7 years to work its way through
the board. When the litigation was begun in this case, it
was 1987. The Bill Johnson's case was fresh. There was
considerable doubt as exactly -- as to exactly what it
meant. I should note that in the district court opinions
that are part of the appendix, the unions raised Bill
Johnson's and said that it -- they were protected under
it, citing it interchangeably with Professional Real
Estate.
QUESTION: They won over half their cases,
didn't they?
MR. BASKIN: Excuse me?
QUESTION: Didn't they win -- they won some 15
out of their 29 cases.
MR. BASKIN: Depending on how you count, they
just barely got over 50 percent.
QUESTION: Did you ask -- talking about the
history of the case, could you tell me how did this case
end up in the Sixth Circuit?
MR. BASKIN: Well, in fact, by the time this
case got to the court of appeals, BE&K was no longer doing
business in California. The gravamen of its doing
business was in the Sixth Circuit.
QUESTION: I see.
MR. BASKIN: And that's why the decision was
made --
QUESTION: I'd like you to address, if I can go
back to the -- what I think was the Chief Justice's
question. Your -- your basic point, I take it, assuming
with you, as I will, for the moment that the language is
ambiguous in Bill Johnson, is that we should treat or the
statute should be interpreted as treating the antitrust
statute and the labor statute a case brought by a
defendant the same way.
And obvious differences, which I'd like you to
address, are that, one, there is a history in the labor
law of employers using cases brought at law either to
break unions or to win disputes. And that was one of the
reasons why the NLRA was passed. That had nothing to do
with the antitrust laws. There is no such history.
Second, the employer -- the -- the matter is
committed to an expert board in the labor area, which
apparently believes that the way to enforce the labor law,
unlike the antitrust law, is to say the sham exception
exists before the case is decided, but once the case is
decided, we're going to keep employers out of the courts
by saying if they lose, that's the end of any immunity
that they get. And we will now look to what their motive
was in bringing this lawsuit. We have an expert board.
We have a different history. We have different statutes.
MR. BASKIN: The --
QUESTION: And now, what is your response?
MR. BASKIN: The irony is that the Court
considered those purported differences in the Bill
Johnson's case and rejected them.
QUESTION: All right. Obviously -- look --
MR. BASKIN: No, no. I'm talking about the
first part.
QUESTION: I -- but I'm trying to stay away from
Bill Johnson because obviously if you're right that the
statute holds it, I mean, I -- all right. Go ahead.
Sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.
MR. BASKIN: Well, to me it's -- the interesting
thing about this case is the Court has itself considered
these very questions that you're raising and you have
answered them, and you do not need to revisit them to --
to come out with the conclusion that the NLRB has either
misinterpreted the standard or that the standard is
unworkable.
QUESTION: Well, but I -- I have -- I have the
same question that I think underlies Justice Breyer's
concern. You would seem to give zero weight to the
board's interest in stopping a purely retaliatory suit.
The board says, now, you have organized this clerical unit
and if -- if you persist in your union activity, we're
going to sue you for the way you've been keeping our
books. We're going to sue you for malpractice, blah,
blah, blah, blah. And so long as there's any basis for
the suit, they can do that in your -- or am I misstating
your view?
MR. BASKIN: Well, only in one respect. It has
to have an objective basis. We are not here defending
sham litigation, baseless litigation.
QUESTION: Well, I suppose there's always abuse
of process if there's -- but if there's some basis, then
you can use it specifically to retaliate.
MR. BASKIN: More than some. It must be
reasonable basis. And yes, yes.
QUESTION: You can specifically use it to
retaliate.
MR. BASKIN: The Court -- this Court has said
that if there is an objective basis, that means it's a
meritorious lawsuit. Then there may also be a motivation
of retaliation. Weighty, countervailing considerations.
QUESTION: But -- but we're talking -- we're
talking in -- in the labor context.
MR. BASKIN: Yes.
QUESTION: And you lose the suit. So, there's
-- you do not -- you're not the prevailing party in the
suit. And you -- you lose on the merits. There's nothing
the board can do about it if you've done it specifically
to retaliate and for no other purpose.
MR. BASKIN: If it is a reasonable, meritorious
suit, as this Court has defined it, where the right of
access to a court is too important to be called an unfair
labor practice solely on the ground that what is sought in
the court is to enjoin employees from exercising a
protected right because of the First Amendment to the
Constitution, the right to petition the courts with a
meritorious lawsuit.
QUESTION: But the First Amendment argument goes
by the boards once the case is over.
MR. BASKIN: No, Your Honor, because -- for the
same reasons that the Court held in Professional Real
Estate. The employer has the right not to be second
guessed with 20/20 hindsight as long as it had a
reasonable basis for the suit.
QUESTION: Yes, but that ignores the fact that
we're not concerned solely with chilling; we're also
concerned with retaliation. And if we didn't have the
retaliatory character of the lawsuit involved, I would
think you would have a much stronger argument as you just
made it. But the retaliation is there and I don't see how
we can accept your -- in effect, your chilling argument
without ignoring the retaliatory character.
MR. BASKIN: Because the employers are being
chilled and, in effect, the retaliation --
QUESTION: Well, they're being chilled in -- in
engaging in retaliation for the exercise of statutory
rights.
MR. BASKIN: But there's actually less
retaliation that's going to take place once the suit is
completed. If that were the standard, then the board
should be instructed to intervene sooner to keep the
employees from having to spend more money to defend
themselves.
QUESTION: And the -- the answer to that, it
seems to me, is set out in the cases. We've got a --
we've got a federalism interest in letting the State
courts at least adjudicate their cases. So, that's the
answer to that objection.
MR. BASKIN: Well, here there's even a more
compelling interest. You have two statutes, Federal
statutes, that the employer was invited to file lawsuits
under.
QUESTION: All right. Let's go back then to the
-- to the difference between the two Federal statutes.
The premise of Justice Breyer's question a moment ago
accepted the ambiguity. If we are not that indulgent and
if we read Bill Johnson's the way Justice Ginsburg read it
-- and I will be candid to say I read it -- number one,
the ambiguity does not leap out at us.
And number two, I'd like to go back to Justice
Ginsburg's question. Even if we assume there was
ambiguity at the beginning, we have had 20 years of board
practice which seems to me to have dissipated any
ambiguity. What's your response to that?
MR. BASKIN: Well, the ambiguity was in the
opinion that led the board to take an erroneous view --
QUESTION: That's right I believe, and the board
has made it very clear how the board is reading it, and
after 20 years, we've got a pretty clearly settled body of
law, haven't we?
MR. BASKIN: Well, a settled body of erroneous
law. And is that what the Court --
QUESTION: And we're interpreting statutes --
the -- the settled body is clear and Congress is
apparently quite agreeable to it.
MR. BASKIN: Well, first, the Court has said you
don't defer -- that -- that you can't read anything into
congressional inaction, particularly when it has taken
this long before the board ruling really was definitive.
And it has taken that long. The issue has been in doubt
for most of that 20-year period.
But the -- going beyond that, the -- the
board --
QUESTION: I don't understand that. Why do you
say it's been in doubt for most of the 20-year period?
MR. BASKIN: Because it's been in doubt. Cases
like this one have been taking a long time to wind their
way through the process. At each step, the board said,
well, we think that it -- there -- it was contested, as
the board said --
QUESTION: You mean it has been contested
constantly during that --
MR. BASKIN: Yes.
QUESTION: -- 20 -- 20-year period?
MR. BASKIN: Absolutely.
QUESTION: Has the board ever taken a different
position in the 20-year period?
MR. BASKIN: There have been dissents, but no,
the board has generally taken a consistent view.
QUESTION: So, the board's position has been
clear for 20 years.
MR. BASKIN: Yes, but the board --
QUESTION: The board is slow. It may take the
-- the cases may be in wending their way through.
MR. BASKIN: But the board is not entitled to
deference in its interpretation of the U.S. Constitution
or of this Court's decision. And that's all that we're
talking about here is the board's interpretation of the
Constitution and this Court's opinion. It's not
interpreting the statute.
QUESTION: I think we're not raising -- I think
Justice Ginsburg's question and my question is not so much
geared to an issue of deference. We're -- we're trying to
-- to get at the -- what seems to us the fact that the law
has become settled. It may require no deference. It may
have become settled because an administrative agency was
interpreting what you think was an ambiguous opinion of
this Court in the first place. But it seems to have
become settled.
And there is a good reason, which underlies
ultimately our -- our approach to stare decisis in
statutory cases, for letting settled statutory
understandings stayed settled unless the legislative
branch wants to change them. And that's the argument
we're getting at, not deference.
MR. BASKIN: Well, it is -- stare decisis is a
form of deference, and we're talking about stare decisis
would apply to the Court's own opinion. Only this Court
is required to defer to itself about its own opinion.
Your -- and so that's why we are talking about deference,
I would submit. At least I interpret your question as
asking should you stick with what the board has come up
with. This Court has not ruled on --
QUESTION: I'm saying that --
MR. BASKIN: -- on Bill Johnson's since Bill
Johnson's.
QUESTION: I'm saying that in -- as -- as your
own answers indicate, for 20 years there seems to have
been a -- a settled practice on the part of the board
which at best is not inconsistent with our opinion. Why
shouldn't we let a settled statutory regime stay settled
unless the legislative branch wants to change it?
MR. BASKIN: I contest that it's a settled
statutory regime, that we are dealing with a First
Amendment right, and that the board's outcome, which it
has taken this long to reach back to the court, is wrong
under the First Amendment. It has proved to be unworkable
and it subjects employers to the impossible situation in
future cases and in cases going on right now that they are
expected to have 100 percent certainty of the outcome.
Indeed, the -- the board could, under this
standard, say that you can win a jury verdict, go -- have
it upheld by the district court, only to be reversed by an
appeals court, and still be found under this Court's
standard to be nonmeritorious and you lose. You have --
you have violated the law.
QUESTION: If there's a retaliatory motive.
MR. BASKIN: If there's a retaliatory motive.
And that's all it takes. There's a retaliatory motive.
You go through all of that based on an attack on your
businesses, which is why employers tend to file these
lawsuits. They don't like lawyers that much, don't want
to spend the money to do it, but they're under attack.
BE&K was under attack in every conceivable forum.
QUESTION: But, I mean, that's a normal problem,
isn't it, with the labor statutes and most other statutes.
It forbids retaliatory behavior. Of course, you'll have
cases where people make the wrong decision about it, where
it's hard to predict, and so forth. But that's the
general situation.
MR. BASKIN: Well --
QUESTION: We're trying to carve out a -- an
exception where you're home free from that.
MR. BASKIN: Well, no, it's the board that's
carving out an exception from the basic First Amendment
protection that this Court has recognized already.
QUESTION: Mr. Baskin, that -- that goes back
every time to how you construe this paragraph, and so if
the position that Justice White is making a distinction
here between, on the one hand, an ongoing proceeding --
the First Amendment says you can't stop it. Never mind
deference to State courts. That's another consideration
that weighs it to the same end, but traditionally under
the First Amendment, a prior restraint, stop it, has been
what the Court has looked at most cautiously. Then
Justice White tells us, but it's different once the
adjudication is over.
The -- the line between prior restraint and
subsequent punishment goes all the way through First
Amendment learning, and you treat this as, well,
ambiguous, but if it were clear it's that there's any
difference between stopping an ongoing proceeding and
looking at a situation after it's been adjudicated?
MR. BASKIN: There -- there can be a difference,
mainly the difference of having more facts, having an
outcome in front of the board at that point. And what the
Court wanted to get across -- the issue in front of the
Court in Bill Johnson's was don't interfere with an
ongoing lawsuit. We don't know how it's going to turn
out.
All right. Once it turns out, if it's without
merit -- meritorious -- I'd just invite the Court to look
at each use of the word meritorious in the Bill Johnson's
opinion. You will regrettably find some inconsistencies
not only internally but with other opinions of this Court
both before Bill Johnson's and after. You have the
opportunity to clarify the law now in a way that is very
straightforward under the Professional Real Estate
Investors test.
If there are no other questions, I'd like to
reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.
QUESTION: Very well, Mr. Baskin.
Mr. Wallace, we'll hear from you.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. WALLACE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and
may it please the Court:
The board and the courts of appeals have had no
difficulty in reading Bill Johnson's the way I think most
people would read this Court's opinion as comprehensively
addressing what the board was doing with respect to the
unfair labor practice under section 8(a)(1) of the filing
of --
QUESTION: Mr. Wallace.
MR. WALLACE: -- retaliatory lawsuits.
QUESTION: Mr. Wallace, when I ask you a
question, please stop.
MR. WALLACE: I didn't hear you. I'm sorry.
QUESTION: Well, listen a little more closely.
Do you disagree with Mr. Baskin's contention
that the word meritorious is used inconsistently in the
part of Bill Johnson's that we're talking about?
MR. WALLACE: I do disagree with that, and --
and no court of appeals that has reviewed board decisions
since Bill Johnson's has read it that way. The Court
quite clearly distinguished between enjoining ongoing
lawsuits, which it said could be done only if the lawsuit
was baseless. Otherwise, the board has to wait until the
lawsuit has been resolved. If the lawsuit turned out
favorably to the employer, then it could not be an unfair
labor practice. But if the lawsuit turned out to be
unmeritorious, if the employer lost, then the board could
consider whether it was filed for a retaliatory purpose.
QUESTION: It did say that, but of course, that
was not the situation before the Court. I mean, it -- it
may be the clearest dictum in the world. It may be the
dictum closest to a holding possible, but it is still
dictum. The Court did not have before it a case in which
the employer had already brought the suit and had lost.
Now, you know, it said what would happen in that
situation, and you know, I think that's entitled to some
weight. But the issue that your opponent wants to argue
here is whether the Court was wrong to say that.
MR. WALLACE: I beg to differ. The Court
specifically noted that some of the claims of the employer
had already been dismissed in the State courts, and in
footnote 15, at the end of the -- its opinion, it said the
board, therefore, can use the criteria we --
QUESTION: But those cases were not before them.
It said what the board can do in those cases that are not
now before us. As I say, it may be a dictum that is the
very next thing to a holding, but it is not a holding.
Those were not cases that the Court had in front of it.
MR. WALLACE: It -- it was a direction for how
further proceedings in the case should be handled.
QUESTION: Exactly, as many dicta are. As many
dicta are, and we do not always observe those directions
when we -- when we have the opportunity to examine the
matter in a -- in a more immediate context.
MR. WALLACE: In any event, if I may turn now to
address the question that the Court asked the parties to
address in formulating the question presented here. Our
submission in this case is that this Court's holding in
Professional Real Estate Investors interpreting the
antitrust laws and the Court's decision in Bill Johnson's,
including this -- these dicta to govern further
proceedings interpreting the National Labor Relations Act,
are entirely compatible with one another in light of the
important differences in the purposes, processes,
remedies, and practicalities of enforcement that were
implicated in the two statutory schemes at issue.
QUESTION: Well, I -- I have one particular
difference in mind that I'd like you to comment on. I --
I -- it's -- it seems to me that what is sought to be done
here is much worse as far as the independence of the
courts and the guarantee of access to the courts by -- by
the citizenry is concerned than what was sought to be done
in -- in -- what case -- Professional Real Estate.
And this is the difference. In Professional
Real Estate, it would have been the courts that would have
decided the facts which would have imposed upon the losing
party attorney's fees. In this situation, it is going to
be the Labor Board that will decide the factual question
of whether there was a retaliatory motive, and the courts
will have to defer to that factual finding if there is a
basis in the record, whether the courts agree with it or
not.
I find it quite offensive to think that Article
III courts are going to be told that certain people who
have come to them for relief will pay a penalty for doing
so on the basis of a retaliatory motive found not by
Article III courts at all but by the labor court -- but by
the Labor Board. In that respect, this case is much worse
than -- than what was going on in -- in Professional Real
Estate.
MR. WALLACE: Well, the board is not
contradicting anything found by the courts. The question
of retaliatory motive was not at issue in the underlying
litigation, and the board has to wait under this Court's
decision in Bill Johnson's before it addresses the
question of whether there's been an unfair labor
practice --
QUESTION: They will address it in a proceeding
before the board. They will find an unfair labor practice
on the basis of their finding of a retaliatory motive.
And I -- I note, by the way, as to, you know,
how -- how much we can trust those -- those findings -- I
had one of my law clerks look up how many -- how many
times the board has imposed this kind of an unfair labor
practice penalty for -- for bringing a lawsuit. Since the
Power Systems case in '78, which is when they started this
process, they have 26 decisions ordering the employer to
pay attorney's fees incurred in defending a lawsuit and 3
decisions in which it -- it ordered a union to do so.
Now, is -- is there some reason that unions are not using
lawyers as much as companies are these days?
MR. WALLACE: Well, the -- the cases against
unions are much less numerous to begin with because unions
are less apt to bring lawsuits to interfere with the
rights of employees under section 7 for concerted
activity. We're talking about a retaliation against
section 7 rights. Usually that's been the subject of
employer suits, but the board does apply the same test
when --
QUESTION: There were union lawsuits in this
present case, weren't there? Plenty of them.
MR. WALLACE: But those were against the
employer, and -- and they --
QUESTION: But suits -- suits against the
employer can certainly be brought to impair the -- the
rights of the employees not to -- not to unionize.
MR. WALLACE: That would have to be a showing a
violation by the union of 8(b)(4), not -- not that the
lawsuit was an 8(a)(1) violation against the concerted
activities rights of employees. The employer would have
to show that the union lawsuit violated duties that the
union owes, and that was resolved against the employer on
the merits in this case because the -- the subject of the
lawsuits was about working conditions at the site of
employment, which was a legitimate union concern.
QUESTION: Never -- never mind the 26 to 3.
Just -- just tell me why I -- as -- as an Article III
judge, I should not be concerned about leaving it to a
Federal agency to make the factual finding that will
determine whether somebody will be punished for bringing a
reasonable lawsuit, although one which ultimately loses in
Federal courts. Why shouldn't I be concerned about that?
MR. WALLACE: Well, this isn't punishment. It's
make-whole relief under an administrative scheme which is
meant to protect employees in the exercise of their
concerted rights, and it involves no contradiction of any
issue that was before the -- the court in the underlying
litigation which did not have occasion to address whether
the suit was brought for a retaliatory purpose.
QUESTION: Mr. Wallace, Mr. Baskin told us that
there are punitive aspects to this that could lead to
debarment he said. So, it's not simply to provide for
fee-shifting, but that there are heavy consequences.
MR. WALLACE: Well, the -- the case to which the
Chief Justice referred earlier, Wisconsin Department of
Industrial Relations against Gould, was one in which this
Court held that Wisconsin law was preempted, and Wisconsin
could not refuse to make purchases, State purchases, from
companies that had been found to have violated the
National Labor Relations Act because the whole purpose of
the remedy scheme under the National Labor Relations Act
is remedial and the remedies are limited, and the idea is
to get labor disputes behind us, not to have disruptions
of the economy, to keep productivity going, and to keep
the people employed.
QUESTION: Well, is -- is the point of this
colloquy whether or not this act can be called punitive or
this NLRB doctrine can be called punitive? I -- I had
thought you said that it is punitive, or am I wrong?
Maybe you think nothing -- maybe you think nothing turns
on that.
MR. WALLACE: Well, I -- I wouldn't think that
-- that anything would turn on it, but it is not punitive.
The only remedy that's granted is a make-whole remedy that
the costs incurred by the prevailing defendants in a suit
brought for an improper motive, namely to coerce those
defendants in the exercise of rights granted them by
Federal statute when suit turned out --
QUESTION: But is there any other effect by
virtue of the finding of the unfair labor practice?
MR. WALLACE: Well --
QUESTION: I mean, true in terms of money, it's
the fees. Is there any other effect --
QUESTION: -- by virtue of their finding?
MR. WALLACE: Notice is to be posted. The cease
and desist order issues. Those -- those parts of the
remedy were not challenged in this case.
QUESTION: Well, let's just talk about the make-
whole remedy. We held in 1982 that in a private suit for
an unfair labor practice, which provides for making whole
the -- the plaintiff for -- for his damages, there was no
authority in the court to award attorney's fees, that
making whole there did not include attorney's fees. What
-- and -- and, you know, the language was very clear about
the American rule and what a -- what a change it would be.
Why -- why should it be any different when the unfair
labor practice is -- is decreed by the board rather than
in a private action?
It doesn't say explicitly that you can get
attorney's fees, just as -- just as the other -- the --
the private action provision didn't say explicitly. It
just said, you know, whatever damages you have. And
damages were not intended to include that. Why should we
hold any differently in this situation, especially when
the result is to leave it to the board to decide whether
-- whether somebody will be punished for bringing a
meritorious but ultimately unsuccessful suit in Federal
court?
MR. WALLACE: Well, board proceedings are much
less burdensome than -- than court proceedings to those
that are issue, and the Court held in Bill Johnson's that
the board remedy of recompensing the defendants who
prevailed in this suit for their costs, because the suit
was brought to defeat their section 7 rights, was a
permissible remedy by the board.
QUESTION: We held it or -- or said it. I mean,
that -- that's one of the disputes here, isn't it?
MR. WALLACE: Yes. They held it in the sense of
-- of prescribing that rule for the further proceedings to
be held in that very case on remand from the Court's
order.
QUESTION: We're just going around the dictum
point again. I consider it dictum, and -- and the issue
is whether that was a wise thing to say.
MR. WALLACE: Well, when the Court prescribes a
rule of that nature, the United States considers itself
bound by it in its further handling --
QUESTION: Yes. I'm -- I'm not criticizing you
for arguing the point, certainly not.
QUESTION: Mr. Wallace, I -- do you agree that
under the board's rule here that it does allow the board
to find the unfair labor practice and impose the sanctions
on litigation brought by employers that is not limited to
just shams and abuse of process?
MR. WALLACE: That's --
QUESTION: It does allow the imposition of these
things for an employer suit that could be considered
objectively reasonable at the time it was brought.
MR. WALLACE: Exactly so. That -- I thought the
Court made it quite clear in Bill Johnson's that as long
as the suit was an unmeritorious one, in the sense that it
did not prevail, the board could afford the limited remedy
that's available under the act.
QUESTION: Well, does that have the necessary
effect of at least chilling some conduct that is protected
by the First Amendment? I mean, it seems to me it does.
You have to -- you would have to concede that it does.
MR. WALLACE: But it -- it's a far less daunting
situation than what the Court was faced with under the
antitrust laws in the Professional Real Estate Investors
case.
QUESTION: Mr. Wallace, isn't it correct that
the scope of chilling is limited to those with a
retaliatory motive?
MR. WALLACE: Absolutely.
QUESTION: I thought it's where the board
finds --
QUESTION: -- already chilled those cases.
QUESTION: -- to those where the board and not
Federal courts on their own find a retaliatory motive.
MR. WALLACE: But, of course, the board's
findings are subject to judicial review.
QUESTION: For -- so long as there's substantial
evidence, which means -- you know.
MR. WALLACE: Correct.
QUESTION: All right. So --
QUESTION: In every 8(a)(1) case, the
retaliatory motive is found by the board. That's part of
the statutory proceeding, isn't it?
MR. WALLACE: That is correct.
QUESTION: The other parts of this statutory
proceeding do not exclude the Federal courts from their
business, do they, which this does by imposing penalties
upon people who come to the Federal courts?
MR. WALLACE: Well, I think this Court's make it
quite -- this Court's decisions make it quite clear that
under the National Labor Relations Act, it is board rather
than courts that have the responsibility of ruling about
unfair labor practices.
QUESTION: We agree with that and the only issue
is whether that statutory provision places within the
board the power to impose this particular sanction for an
unfair labor practice, a penalty for bringing a
meritorious lawsuit.
MR. WALLACE: Well, make-whole relief --
QUESTION: Isn't the make-whole relief simply
that they've said, since ours is a statute which foresees
taking labor disputes out of the courts and putting them
into the board, since that's why it was passed, we're
going to say a -- a loser in a Federal lawsuit that
violates that basic underlying purpose has to pay
attorney's fees to the winner? Now, is there anything
here other than that?
MR. WALLACE: Not -- not at all. That's -- that
is what is at issue, and the -- the National Labor
Relations Act authorizes the board, under this Court's
opinion in Bill Johnson's, to afford that kind of a
limited remedy --
QUESTION: Well, isn't what --
QUESTION: Is the courts' -- is the board's
definition of a unmeritorious lawsuit simply one which --
in which the plaintiff does not get what the plaintiff
wants. It's thrown out of court, so to speak.
MR. WALLACE: That's approximately it, yes, Mr.
Chief Justice.
QUESTION: How -- how would it vary? Why do you
use the term approximately?
MR. WALLACE: Well, there can -- there can be
cases in which a voluntary dismissal was taken with
prejudice. Sometimes the question of whether it was an
unmeritorious suit becomes a debatable question. But
ordinarily it's one, as it was in this case, in which the
courts have ruled against claims that the employer made.
QUESTION: Is -- is -- I'm sorry. Is there any
authority? I mean, I thought, as a matter of proposition,
maybe there would be some authority like a -- an
electricity generating regulator would have said in
certain kinds of lawsuits, you have to have fee-shifting.
The SEC might say in certain kinds of lawsuits, certain
companies have to pay attorney's fees. The barbers'
regulator might say in certain union -- or certain --
certain instances the barbers have to pay the legal fees
of somebody else. Is -- is there any comparable authority
any other place that you've found?
It -- it doesn't seem to me an absurd
proposition of law or of constitutional law that a
regulator who's in charge of a particular group of
individuals or businesses says in particular circumstances
there will be fee-shifting. But maybe that's total --
maybe this is the only case that's ever come up.
MR. WALLACE: Well, we -- we didn't come up with
analogies in which regulatory agencies do the fee-
shifting. There are certainly many statutes that provide
for fee-shifting. The Fogerty case discusses a number of
them.
QUESTION: But they have to be very explicit
because it's such an extraordinary thing. That's what our
jurisprudence very clearly says. And here with -- with no
more explicitness than there was in the case in Summit
Valley, the -- the agency is assuming the power to fee-
shift and to make the factual determination upon which the
fee-shifting turns. I think that's extraordinary.
MR. WALLACE: Well, there is not a reference to
fee-shifting as such in the National Labor Relations Act,
but Congress did say in section 8(a)(1) that it shall be
an unfair labor practice to an employee to interfere with,
restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of the
concerted activity rights for mutual aid and protection
that are guaranteed in section 7. And this Court in Bill
Johnson's recognized that there had been a history of the
use of the courts for that purpose.
QUESTION: Mr. Wallace --
QUESTION: In -- in a case like this, if we have
essentially these facts, if the finding of the board was
is that the purpose of the employer in bringing the suit
was because the employer's board of directors met and they
say, we are being hurt in the marketplace, public opinion
is against us, we must bring these suits to protect our
position in the business community, I take it that is a
retaliatory motive.
MR. WALLACE: Well, the retaliatory motive would
be -- it would have to be shown that the suit was brought
for the purpose of coercing, discouraging, suppressing,
restraining the employees in the exercise of their rights.
QUESTION: Well, but you -- you know what I'm
trying -- trying to get at. The -- the union is doing
these to weaken the employer and the employer meets and
says, this is hurting our business, it's hurting us in the
marketplace. Is that retaliatory?
MR. WALLACE: Well, the -- the board addresses
that question in light of all the circumstances of the
case. To the extent that the suit was not baseless in law
or fact that the employer brought --
QUESTION: Assume -- assume that there -- it's
not baseless.
MR. WALLACE: That weighs in the employer's
favor. There are other factors that weigh against the
employer. In this --
QUESTION: But it can be retaliatory for the
employer to protect its business against suits by the
union which are brought by the union for the motive of
weakening the employer. That's retaliatory.
MR. WALLACE: Well, only if the employer has
brought suits against the union or the employees. It
certainly can defend against any suit --
QUESTION: No. It's been bringing suits in
order to stop the other suits.
MR. WALLACE: Well --
QUESTION: Let -- let me ask you in a related
vein. Maybe it's an unrelated vein. Can -- could
Congress overrule Noerr-Pennington?
MR. WALLACE: This Court did not indicate in any
way that it could not reexamine, modify the rules of
Noerr-Pennington or of Professional Real Estate. The
Court --
QUESTION: In other words, Noerr-Pennington
doesn't have a constitutional underpinning.
MR. WALLACE: It -- it certainly construed the
antitrust laws in light of the fact that those laws focus
mostly on private conduct in the marketplace, not on
petitioning for Government-imposed restraints, and that
there was a need in construing them not to -- to allow
improper chilling of the bringing of lawsuits or other
forms of petitioning activity.
And in -- in Professional Real Estate itself,
the procedural posture focused on the need for summary
judgment to be available against a counterclaim for treble
damages under the antitrust laws in circumstances in which
the counterclaimant, after the underlying copyright
infringement suit was found to be objectively reasonable,
was saying, but I still need further discovery in order to
ascertain the intent and motives of the original plaintiff
in bringing the copyright infringement suit because it's
my view that -- that they didn't really expect to prevail
and that they were bringing it for anticompetitive
purposes.
And the danger that the Court was addressing
there was that much of the protective quality of the Noerr
doctrine itself could be undermined if the original
lawsuit that supposedly is protected could be chilled by
the prospect of burdensome discovery and treble damages.
QUESTION: My -- my concern -- my concern is --
is this, is that the First Amendment has its own
corrective counterspeech, but what the board has done here
is it's defined retaliatory motive so broadly that it's
taken away that First Amendment corrective. And that is
itself a distortion of First Amendment principles which
allowed the unions to bring these suits in the first
place, it seems to me.
MR. WALLACE: Well, there -- there is a very
limited remedy available here compared to the prospect
that treble damages might be awarded on the basis of
rather unpredictable findings about subjective motivation
in bringing the lawsuit. And it -- it -- it's a remedy
that's been applied against a background of what this
Court in Bill Johnson's referred to as a -- a powerful
tool. Powerful was the word the Court used.
QUESTION: Mr. Wallace, is retaliatory motive --
is that before us in this case? I mean, it may be that
this Court, by saying that the board -- that there was,
even in this case, insufficient evidence of retaliatory
motive, but I didn't think that was the question presented
here.
MR. WALLACE: I agree with you on that point,
Justice Ginsburg.
QUESTION: Because on that, I was going to ask
you, well, what is it that shows that this was in
retaliation for violation of section 7 rights instead of
being in -- in response to the union's desire simply to
harass the employer? I think that there are very serious
questions about that, but my view was of this case that --
that wasn't before us.
MR. WALLACE: I -- I agree with you completely.
In fact --
QUESTION: I take it -- I take it the background
of this case is that there was a finding of retaliatory
motive and we have to make our decision based upon the way
the board interprets retaliatory motive in cases such as
this.
MR. WALLACE: Well, it's certainly part of the
background of the case, but the Court did limit the grant
of certiorari to whether these two decisions are
compatible given the differences between the two acts.
QUESTION: And we have to defer both to the
board's determination of what constitutes a retaliatory
motive and, even more so, to the board's factual
determination that retaliatory motive existed. All it
takes is one witness who says it existed, and that would
constitute substantial evidence. And if the board goes
with that witness, the courts have to effectively penalize
the company for seeking resort in the courts.
MR. WALLACE: Well, there is seldom direct
evidence of that kind, although occasionally there is
direct evidence of animus in the bringing of the suit.
But the board has relied on a number of factors, which
we've set out on page 47 of our brief, in various -- in
various cases in seeing retaliatory motive. In this case
one of the more persuasive ones was that the lawsuit was
brought against parties that the plaintiff knew or should
have known did not participate in the allegedly unlawful
conduct. They included as defendants unions that had
not --
QUESTION: That's an issue that was raised by
question 3 of the cert petition, and we didn't grant it.
MR. WALLACE: That's correct. That's correct.
The -- the petition --
QUESTION: But -- but --
MR. WALLACE: -- was about the compatibility of
the Court's decision in Professional Real Estate with what
we had taken to be the Court's clear prescription of the
limits on the remedy of the 8(a)(1) and unfair labor
practice in the Bill Johnson's case.
QUESTION: Mr. Wallace, we are concerned with
the Bill Johnson's case, and a question has been raised
about where does the authority to come -- come from for
this fee-shifting. It does appear in the Court's opinion
in Bill Johnson's. If a violation is found, the board may
order the employer to reimburse the employees, whom he has
wrongfully sued, for their attorney's fees. Where did the
Court come up with that fee-shifting? Was that something
that the board had been doing? Did the Government propose
it? But it's right there in the Court's of opinion that
the proper remedy is fee-shifting.
MR. WALLACE: Precisely so. But the board had
been doing it regardless of the merits of the underlying
lawsuit. The board had become so concerned with the use
of the courts for retaliatory litigation that whether the
lawsuit was meritorious or not, if it found that it was
brought for the purpose of defeating section 7 rights, it
was awarding fees. And the Court said, no, wait a minute.
You can't do that and you can't enjoin lawsuits that are
not baseless. The Court was really correcting the board
and reining in that remedy in a way that the board has
complied with.
QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Wallace.
Mr. Baskin, you have 4 minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MAURICE BASKIN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BASKIN: Thank you, Your Honor. I would
just briefly like to address the question of retaliatory
motive, but only as I understood the Justices' questions
to be does it suffice alone so that they -- the board can
rightly ignore the question of the objective basis. And
-- and the reason it does not suffice, among others, is
perhaps looking at the 26 decisions Justice Scalia found,
there's only one among them where there was no finding of
retaliatory motive and there only because it was found
that the action didn't relate in any way to the union
activity.
QUESTION: There was only one -- one where what?
MR. BASKIN: Where there was no finding, where
the board found no retaliatory motive. It found against
the employers 25 out of 26 times. Once it found that the
employer had lost the lawsuit, automatically according to
the board, no merit. Even though they had all the best
circumstances leading up to the loss, they lost. No
merit.
Then the board proceeds to the retaliatory
motive step supposedly going to protect employers, and all
they say is does it relate to union activity. Well, if it
relates, except for one case where it didn't, boom, you
lose. The employers lose.
And what the result of that is, is that no
employer can go to court if any sort of protected activity
is even arguably involved because even if you convene a
panel of experts, as BE&K did in this case, and go as far
as you can to make sure you are not trampling on any
employee rights, if you go to court, you will be found to
have violated the law unless you can say with 100 percent
certainty that you're going to win. And no one can say
that.
QUESTION: I didn't know -- as long as you're
finished, I thought the 26 cases were 26 cases in which
they awarded attorney's fees.
MR. BASKIN: No. 26 cases with attorney's fees
plus, attorney's fees --
QUESTION: All right. Now, I thought they
weren't supposed to award attorney's fees or anything
unless there was a retaliatory motive.
MR. BASKIN: Yes. The board found retaliatory
motive.
QUESTION: All right. No, but I mean, of course
they did. I mean, how many cases where there where people
alleged retaliatory motive and they found the opposite?
MR. BASKIN: In the 26 cases --
QUESTION: No. Those are the ones where they
won. How many did they lose? I mean, I don't understand
this 26 case business. I thought the 26 cases were the
ones that they awarded it in, and I thought they were only
supposed to award it where it's retaliatory. So, it's
hardly surprising it's retaliatory.
MR. BASKIN: No. As I understood Justice
Scalia, and frankly our own research, is these are 26
cases that reached the board where the board could have
gone either way, and every time, except for the one, they
found no merit and retaliatory motive. And they did so
almost automatically because of their misreading of a
principle. We say a misreading. But either way, it's a
bad principle.
QUESTION: Well, when you say the board could
have gone either way, you don't mean that you know the
evidence and that, in fact, on the evidence, the board
could have gone either way. You simply mean that it's a
case in which if the evidence showed there was
retaliation, they could award the fees, and if the
evidence did not show retaliation, they couldn't award the
fees. Right?
MR. BASKIN: The 26 cases are --
QUESTION: So, all we know is that in those
cases, they found retaliatory motive. We don't know that
they're wrong.
MR. BASKIN: Yes, that's -- that's what we know.
They found retaliatory motive. And the limited point that
I'm making here at the end is that this retaliatory motive
idea is no more -- not enough protection under the NLRA
just as it is not enough protection -- and you've already
found it to be not enough protection -- under the
antitrust laws. And that's why the Professional Real
Estate standard is the correct standard and it's the only
one that protects employers' rights under the First
Amendment.
Thank you.
