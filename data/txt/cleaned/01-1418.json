Warner.\nMr. Goldblatt.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CRAIG GOLDBLATT\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. GOLDBLATT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nAn individual debtor at the end of a bankruptcy\ncase will typically receive a discharge of that debtor's\npre-bankruptcy debts. That discharge, however, is subject\nto a number of statutory exceptions, each exception\nreflecting a congressional judgment that a particular\ncategory of debt be paid notwithstanding the prior\nbankruptcy. Those exceptions include not only debts for\nmoney obtained by fraud, debts for injuries caused by\ndrunk driving, and amounts due for alimony and child\nsupport.\nWith respect to the fraud exception at issue\nhere, under the Bankruptcy Code and this Court's cases, a\ndebt is nondischargeable in bankruptcy if the creditor can\nestablish that the underlying debt arises out of an act of\nfraud. The question presented in this case is whether a\ndebt that would otherwise be nondischargeable for that\nreason becomes dischargeable if the parties enter into a\nsettlement agreement that resolves the amount of the debt.\nThe court of appeals said that a settlement did\nhave that effect, emphasizing that the effect of a\nsettlement was to trade a fraud claim for a contract\naction that would be discharged in bankruptcy.\nQUESTION: Is it your understanding that if the\nFourth Circuit were correct and were to be affirmed in\nthis case, that its rule would be the generally prevailing\nrule in all of the States, or would certain States differ\non whether or not there was, in effect, a novation when\nthere was a settlement agreement? Would we have to go\nState-by-State?\nMR. GOLDBLATT: No, Your Honor. The question of\ndischargeability is a question of Federal law. That is\nhow each of the courts of appeals that have addressed the\nquestion has treated it. Indeed, this Court, in Grogan\nversus Garner, has emphasized that the construction of\nsection 523(a) of the Bankruptcy Code is a question of\nFederal law.\nQUESTION: Well, my -- my question, perhaps, was\nnot as clear as it ought to have been. The Fourth Circuit\nplaced substantial reliance on the fact that this was a\nnovation under State law, that there was a new debt\ncreated superseding the old, et cetera, and my question is\nwhether or not -- if we affirm its judgment, that we will\nfind in almost every other State a settlement is also a\nnovation, or will the rule vary from State to State, and\nif it does vary from State to State, will the Fourth\nCircuit rule from this particular State be the majority\nrule or minority?\nMR. GOLDBLATT: Your Honor, the court of appeals\ndid, indeed, say that the -- the settlement effected a\nnovation. That is a common rule. I'm unaware of any\njurisdiction in which that -- that wouldn't be the\nprinciple. The question, nevertheless, before this Court\nis the effect as a matter of Federal bankruptcy law of\nthat settlement.\nQUESTION:\nwhat I'm just asking is -- this case came from South\nCarolina, was it?\nMR. GOLDBLATT: From North Carolina, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Oh, from North Carolina.\nMR. GOLDBLATT: Yes.\nQUESTION: Is the North Carolina rule about\nnovations and settlements the majority rule for most of\nthe States? In most States, would this be called a\nnovation?\nMR. GOLDBLATT: Yes, Your Honor. I'm unaware of\nany jurisdiction in which a settlement doesn't effect\nnovation. When the parties to a dispute settle that\ndispute, it is commonly the case that -- indeed, in every\njurisdiction of which I'm aware, following that\nsettlement, the -- the creditor or the plaintiff is unable\nto bring a new lawsuit for fraud. Rather, the party is\nleft to enforce the -- the settlement.\nQUESTION: Mr. Goldblatt, I take it you're\nsaying, yeah, a novation is fine with you. No longer do\nthey have the original claim. They have substituted for\nit, what the claim is, the amount of the settlement.\nThe -- what was it, immediate payment of X dollars? Was\nit 2,000?\nMR. GOLDBLATT: It was an immediate payment of\n$200,000 and a promissory note for $100,000.\nQUESTION: And that's -- that's what they --\nthey say is the basis of their claim in bankruptcy. They\nthink -- they know they can't go back to the original\nclaim. To that extent, it's a novation. That's not\ndisputed. But there is one element of the background of\nthis case perhaps you can clarify for me. It's odd that\nLeonard Warner stipulated that this was a nondischargeable\ndebt, but his wife, who's in the bankruptcy with him, says\nyes, it is dischargeable. What is the effect of the\nstipulation by Leonard Warner that this debt is\nnondischargeable?\nMR. GOLDBLATT: Your Honor, Leonard Warner\nstipulates that the debt is nondischargeable as to him.\nWith respect to Mrs. Warner, it would remain our burden in\nbankruptcy to show that -- that there is an act of fraud\nthat is properly attributable to her, either because she\ncommitted it herself or by some principle of agency that\nit is nondischargeable because of her, so I -- I don't\nbelieve that the -- the stipulation by its terms is -- is\ndispositive on the question of whether it is\nnondischargeable as -- as to her.\nQUESTION: But does that mean that -- let's say\nthe Fourth Circuit is affirmed, that you could still,\npost-bankruptcy, go after Mr. Warner because he stipulated\nthat the debt as to him was nondischargeable?\nMR. GOLDBLATT: I -- I believe that -- that's a\nfinal and unappealable order at this point, and yes,\nthat's right, of course. Petitioners assert that they\nhave the right as a matter of Federal bankruptcy law also\nto continue to recover on this debt as against\nMrs. Warner, who also is an obligor on the promissory\nnote.\nOn the essential point that, Justice Ginsburg,\nyou were making with respect to the holding below, the\ndescription you offered is -- is exactly right. It is\ntrue that there is a novation. It is true that the\nunderlying claim of fraud has been released, but just --\nthat was equally true in this Court's decision in Brown\nversus Felsen.\nIn Brown, the parties to a State court\nlitigation resolved that litigation by agreeing to the\nentry of a consent judgment. It was as equally true\nthere, as it is here, that the parties who had been --\nwhose litigation had ended in the consent judgment were\nbarred, in that case by the preclusive effect of the\nconsent judgment, here by the binding effect of the\nsettlement, from bringing a new suit claiming fraud. All\nthey could do was enforce the consent judgment.\nNevertheless, this Court held in a unanimous\nopinion in Brown versus Felsen that in bankruptcy, the\ncreditor nevertheless had the right to seek to establish\nthat the underlying debt arises out of an act of fraud,\nand the -- the reason this Court --\nQUESTION: Well, of course, there it wasn't just\nthe underlying debt. It was trying to find out what the\njudgment actually decided. They were -- they were able to\ngo beyond the terms of the judgment to determine what the\njudgment actually resolved. I'm not quite sure it's\nexactly parallel --\nMR. GOLDBLATT: Well, yes, Justice Stevens,\nthat's right, and here what -- what petitioners seek to do\nis go behind the settlement agreement --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. GOLDBLATT: -- and see what the settlement\nactually resolved.\nQUESTION: Supposing the settlement -- they had\ngone along with the settlement, and then they came up with\na -- a third proposal where the debtor said, I'm not sure\nI'm going to be able to meet my obligations, but I've got\nanother proposal, we'll go in the joint venture to do\nsomething else and we'll release the contract claim and\nsubstitute a third, could you go -- still continue to go\nbehind to find out what the original source of the debt\nwas?\nMR. GOLDBLATT: Yes.\nQUESTION: So even if, say, they had five or six\ndifferent transactions, each of which purported to be a\ncomplete substitute for the deal they had just been unable\nto -- you can always go -- say, Well, the whole thing\nstarted because you cheated me out of something?\nMR. GOLDBLATT: Well -- well, for each\nparticular debt that one asserts is nondischargeable, the\ncreditor bears the burden of proving in bankruptcy that\nthat debt arises out of an act of fraud.\nQUESTION: Directly or indirectly out of.\nMR. GOLDBLATT: That's right, but nevertheless,\nunder Brown versus Felsen, that is the creditor's --\nQUESTION: Suppose I have an indebtedness. I'm\nrunning a business and I have one indebtedness, and in\norder to cover the payments for that indebtedness, I incur\na second indebtedness which I otherwise would not have\nincurred, is that traceable to fraud?\nMR. GOLDBLATT: If the original indebtedness\narises out of an act of fraud, Justice Scalia, then --\nthen yes, it is all debt --\nQUESTION: Anything that happens later is --\nthat -- that wouldn't have happened but for the original\nindebtedness is, within the terms of the Bankruptcy Act,\ntraceable to the fraud?\nMR. GOLDBLATT:\ncertainly acknowledge that there must be some principle\nof, say, proximate causation.\nQUESTION: Exactly, and that's all we're talking\nabout here, isn't -- isn't it? How -- how -- you know,\nhow far down the line do we carry traceable to, and does a\nnovation end the traceability, but you -- you have to\nacknowledge it has to end somewhere.\nMR. GOLDBLATT: There certainly is a principle\nof proximate causation. You -- you need to show that\nthere is a direct connection between the act of fraud --\nQUESTION: Wait, but what about -- I mean, this\ndoesn't make too much sense to me. You say, A owes B\n$100,000 because of a fraud that A committed against B, so\nthey settle it, and they say, our settlement arrangement\nis the following. We enter into a new business called\nMacy's Department Store, and many years later there's\nanother debt between the partners arising out of buying\nfurniture for Macy's that has nothing to do with fraud,\nand now you're saying that that debt's going to be never\ndischargeable because the cause of Macy's was the fraud?\nMR. GOLDBLATT: No, Justice Breyer, I'm not\nsuggesting that there is never a point in which the\ncausation becomes too tenuous that you can't prove that\nthe debt that one is contending is --\nQUESTION: No, I -- absolutely. Macy's would\nnever have been created but for the debt, no doubt about\nthat.\nMR. GOLDBLATT: But not -- not only is -- is the\nprinciple of --\nQUESTION: They never would have had this\nfurniture argument but for the debt.\nQUESTION: Well, you're talking not just about\ncause, but about proximate cause.\nMR. GOLDBLATT: Exactly. It's not just a\nquestion of but-for causation, but as in common law,\nproximate causation.\nQUESTION: And what does that mean, proximate\ncause, then? What's the difference between this case and\nMacy's?\nMR. GOLDBLATT: Your Honor, here, all that\nhappened is that the -- the form of the debt changed. The\nparties entered into a settlement agreement in which they\nchanged the debt from an unliquidated cause of action for\nfraud into a liquidated promissory note.\nQUESTION: In -- in connection with that, one\nside said to the other, I don't care whether this has come\nout of fraud or not. Regardless of whether it came out of\nfraud, I'm going to give you this money, and we'll be\nquits. Why isn't that enough to terminate the proximity,\nbecause the averment of both parties is, never mind fraud,\nit doesn't have anything to do with fraud, we're going to\nsettle this. Whether there was fraud or whether there\nwasn't fraud, you get the money.\nMR. GOLDBLATT: That -- that's right, Your\nHonor, and all a creditor seeks to do in showing a debt as\nnondischargeable is seeks to enforce the debtor's promise\nto pay the amount of money given in that settlement.\nQUESTION: That's true, but -- but here it\nwas -- there was no acknowledgement of the fraud. It was\ngiven with the averment that this debt does not hinge upon\nfraud. This debt is just to settle this controversy\nbetween us whether there was fraud or whether there wasn't\nfraud.\nMR. GOLDBLATT: That's --\nQUESTION: Why isn't that enough to terminate\nthe proximity necessary for -- for nondischargeability in\nbankruptcy?\nMR. GOLDBLATT: Just a couple of -- of answers.\nFirst, it -- it doesn't terminate the proximity any more\nthan the consent judgment in Brown versus Felsen might\nhave terminated the proximity in that case. It's, of\ncourse, true that a -- a consent judgment operates as a --\nextinguishes the prior cause of action and the claims\nmerge into the consent judgment.\nNevertheless, this Court said in Brown versus\nFelsen that notwithstanding the preclusive effect of that\njudgment, a creditor has the right in bankruptcy to\nestablish that the debt is traceable to fraud, and what it\nsaid is --\nQUESTION: But doesn't a consent judgment\nalways, at -- always hinge upon the existence of a cause\nof action?\nMR. GOLDBLATT: Presumably yes, Your Honor,\nand --\nQUESTION: Whereas a settlement doesn't.\nMR. GOLDBLATT: That's right, and unless the\ncreditor can prove in bankruptcy that the debt that's now\nreflected in -- in the settlement agreement is traceable\nto an act of fraud, the creditor will lose the\nnondischargeability action, and the only question is\nwhether the creditor should have the opportunity to\nestablish in bankruptcy that there is, in fact, an act of\nfraud that -- that is reflected in and resolved by the\nconsent judgment.\nThe consent judgment that says expressly -- it\ndoesn't say there's no fraud. It says that this is a\ncompromise of disputed claims, and in exchange for the\nrelease, what the creditor got was a clear carve-out from\nthat release for the right to enforce the $100,000 of debt\nthat's reflected in the promissory note.\nQUESTION: It doesn't say there's no fraud, but\nit does say that this indebtedness has nothing to do with\nwhether or not there was fraud. Whether or not there was\nfraud --\nMR. GOLDBLATT: That's right. The settlement --\nQUESTION: -- this indebtedness exists. It\nseems to me it severs the connection between the fraud and\nthe indebtedness.\nMR. GOLDBLATT: But it is completely silent on\nthe question of whether fraud had occurred, just as the\nconsent judgment in Brown v. Felsen was completely silent\non the question whether that debt arose out of contract or\nfraud. In Brown, this Court said that the creditor has\nthe opportunity to look behind the fraud -- to look behind\nthe settlement to determine whether or not it was for\nfraud, and there -- there's no difference here.\nYour Honor --\nQUESTION: Would there be -- would there be a\ndifference if the settlement had expressly said, we\nstipulate that there was no fraud leading to the creation\nof the debt of -- for which this in effect is a -- a\nnovation?\nMR. GOLDBLATT: Justice Souter --\nQUESTION: Would that make a difference?\nMR. GOLDBLATT:\nmuch harder case for reasons we set out in -- in our\nbriefs. We contend as a matter of bankruptcy policy there\nare reasons why such an agreement shouldn't be enforced,\nbut that would certainly be a much more difficult case\nthan this one.\nQUESTION: But your argument here is we don't\nreally have to get to bankruptcy policy. There simply has\nnot been an agreement which eliminates the fraudulent\ncharacter of the debt. Is that basically it?\nMR. GOLDBLATT: That's -- that's exactly right,\nJustice Souter.\nThe way this works in bankruptcy is that when\nthe debtor files for bankruptcy with this promissory note\noutstanding for a hundred-and-some-thousand dollars, the\ncreditor comes into bankruptcy and files a proof of claim\nsaying, I have a claim of a hundred-and-some- thousand\ndollars, and I'm entitled to my pro rata distribution on\nthat hundred-and-some-thousand dollars. The proof of\nclaim is on page 82 of the joint appendix.\nNo one's contending that the release bars the\ncreditor from seeking recovery on the amount of that debt.\nThe only question is whether they can receive recovery in\nthe full amount of the debt by showing it's\nnondischargeable, or whether they're limited to simply the\ncents on the dollar that the claim will pay in bankruptcy,\nbecause the text of the Bankruptcy Code makes clear that\nthe form of the debt doesn't matter, that a debt -- that\nunder section 523, a debt can take any number of\ndifferent -- under -- I'm sorry.\nUnder section 523 of the Bankruptcy Code, any\ndebt, the code says, is nondischargeable if it's traceable\nto an act of fraud, and the code defines debt very broadly\nto include debts that are liquidated, unliquidated,\nreduced to judgment, et cetera. It's quite clear the form\nof the debt doesn't matter, unless --\nQUESTION: But the traceability does, and that's\nwhat we're talking about here, how traceable is traceable.\nMR. GOLDBLATT: That's right, Justice Scalia,\nand with respect to that question there is -- there is no\ndifference between a consent judgment that is a final\nadjudication of the claims between the parties and a\nsettlement agreement, both of which are equally\npreclusive, and both of which are equally silent on the\nquestion of whether fraud occurred.\nUnless the Court has further questions, I'll\nreserve the balance of my time.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Goldblatt.\nMs. Blatt, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMS. BLATT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nWhen a creditor settles a fraud claim without\nresolving the disputed issue of fraud, the creditor has\nthe right to enforce the settlement debt for the full\namount in bankruptcy by filing a proof of claim and by\nestablishing fraud in response to the defense of\ndischargeability. That conclusion is confirmed by Brown,\nwhich held that a creditor who settles a fraud claim by\nconsent judgment may establish fraud in response to a\nbankruptcy --\nQUESTION: But the real inquiry in Brown, as I\nread it, is can we go behind a judgment to see what was\nactually determined by the judgment. It wasn't any\nemphasis on the settlement aspect of it, as I read the\nopinion.\nMS. BLATT: Right.\nQUESTION: And I guess the holding is, yes, you\nmay go behind a judgment to see what was decided, and that\nseems to me a little different from going behind a\nsettlement.\nQUESTION: Well, didn't Brown decide two\nseparate issues?\nMS. BLATT:\nThe Court -- the question of fraud was not litigated in\nBrown because the case was settled, and the Court\nmentioned in its last footnote that there would be a\ndifferent situation if the question of fraud was actually\nlitigated.\nThe question before the bankruptcy court in\nBrown is whether the money owed under that consent\njudgment was money obtained by fraud. So, too, the exact\nsame question is relevant here.\nQUESTION: It didn't look to what the Court had\ndecided, but what the claim was about, but here we have\nsomething in addition. There is a judicial order. There\nwas a complaint filed, and it was dismissed as part of the\nsettlement. That complaint in the court action was\ndismissed with prejudice. What effect should that have?\nMS. BLATT: Not -- a dismissal with prejudice\nfollowing a settlement. As this Court stated in Lawlor\nversus National Screen Service, it's cited in the reply\nbrief at page 9, is that it has -- does not have\npreclusive effect on the disputed issue unless the\njudgment is accompanied by specific findings on the\ndisputed issue, and that's the classic requirement for\nissue preclusion or collateral estoppel, that the matter\nbe actually litigated.\nQUESTION:\njust -- just as far as whether it suffices to terminate\nthe traceability. That -- that isn't necessarily\ncoextensive with -- with whether there was issue\npreclusion.\nMS. BLATT: No, the -- the dismissal with\nprejudice doesn't impair the creditor's right to walk into\ncourt and sue to enforce the settlement debt, including\nthe right to try to get the full amount of the settlement\ndebt in bankruptcy, and on this issue of traceability,\nit -- it is not only identical to Brown, but the code by\nits express terms disclaims any distinction between a\nliquidated debt and an unliquidated debt. The settlement\nin Brown and the settlement here converts an unliquidated\nfraud claim into a liquidated claim to collect on the\nsettlement debt.\nQUESTION: May I -- would you just clear up one\nthing for me? Say the fraud claim was for $300,000 and\nthe contract was -- the novation was $200,000, in the\nbankruptcy court do you contend they can get the full 300\nor just the 200?\nMS. BLATT: No. Under -- under -- he would\nbe -- the -- the creditor would be bound by the settlement\nagreement under principles of State law that the amount of\nhis debt would only be the $200,000.\nQUESTION:\ndoesn't it?\nQUESTION: I don't understand that.\nQUESTION: Why shouldn't he get the full amount?\nQUESTION: You conduct this big inquiry and find\nout that the guy's been defrauded of $300, and then that\nthe settlement agreement really covers up a fraud and you\nsay, Well, but you know, a deal's a deal. Even though you\ndefrauded him of it and the whole thing's traceable to\nfraud, we're only going to give you $200,000. That's very\nstrange.\nMS. BLATT: I'm sorry, are you talking about the\nsettlement agreement itself was procured by fraud?\nQUESTION: No, no, no, no. No, the settlement\nagreement was just an arm's-length agreement, but if you\nfind that, in fact, the debt underlying that -- that\nagreement was fraudulently obtained, having gone through\nall the trouble of determining that fact, why don't you\nmake the guy cough up all the money that he got by fraud?\nMS. BLATT: The Court -- the Court addressed\nthis very issue in Brown. The creditor there did not get\na fraud judgment for exemplary damages and special --\nspecial damages under State law. He was limited to, in\nbankruptcy, of just seeking this settlement debt, and what\nthe bankruptcy code does is, it gives the creditor a\nstatutory right to render that settlement debt\nnondischargeable if fraud can be -- can be shown.\nYou don't -- and there's another way of looking\nat it, too. The Court --\nQUESTION: But -- but what's the policy reason\nbehind that. I mean, if -- if what we're concerned about\nis vindicating the Federal policy that the -- the\nBankruptcy Code protects only honest debtors and not\ndishonest debtors, why not give them the whole $300,000?\nI mean, I -- I know Brown didn't do that, but why didn't\nit do that?\nMS. BLATT: The Court in Grogan -- it's because\nof two issues, Justice Kennedy. Under State -- State law\ndetermines the amount of the debt that is owed, and\nthere's just no question, at least I don't think that the\ncreditor could make an argument that he's owed any more\nthan $300,000. He can't relitigate and try to get up to\n$600,000. That's just governed by State law.\nQUESTION: Well, the Fourth Circuit -- the\nFourth Circuit says State law says that this is a\nnovation, too, so -- and you're -- you don't want us to be\nbound by that interpretation of State law.\nMS. BLATT: The -- again, this Court in Grogan\nversus Carter said that State law determines the amount of\nthe debt, and I just don't think the creditor would have a\ngood faith argument that he could go beyond the settlement\nagreement, but on the question of nondischargeability,\nwhat the creditor is trying to do is collect the entire\namount of the debt by -- by showing fraud, and we think\napplying Brown --\nQUESTION: What their main argument, I think, on\nthe other side is, you get a debt, that's what it is, a\ndebt for money obtained by fraud, and this is not a debt\nfor money obtained by fraud, this is a debt for money owed\nunder a settlement agreement.\nNow, the virtue of that is, it's a bright line,\nand what we're saying, I think, in the negative -- the\nnegative of it is that if you depart from that, well\nthere's no end to it. You have a settlement agreement,\nand no matter how long you go into the future, whatever it\nis, that -- whatever it says you're supposed to do in that\nsettlement agreement, it is. Use the words proximate\ncause, use whatever they want, but it is a debt. Where it\ncomes from is the fraud.\nThat's where the source of the debt is, no\nmatter what it says in that settlement agreement, and\nthere's just no stopping place, no way to look into it, no\nattenuation forever, et cetera, so that's what I'd like\nyou to here address.\nMS. BLATT: Well, this Court already crossed\nthat bridge in Brown.\nQUESTION: Well, all right, so then maybe Brown\nwas wrong.\nMS. BLATT: But the second point is that --\nQUESTION: Maybe it was wrong.\nMS. BLATT: Whatever the limits of the\ntraceability point, which this Court addressed in a\nseparate decision, Cohen versus de la Cruz, which dealt\nwith the traceability aspects --\nQUESTION: There is no traceability. There's\nnever a problem. Underlying this was the fraud. Whatever\nit says in that settlement agreement is based on fraud.\nMS. BLATT: The code itself says that any\nenforceable obligation, whether or not it's liquidated or\nunliquidated or appears in a judgment, if you can prove\nthat there has been a fraudulent acquisition of money, the\nresulting debt is nondischargeable, and that is --\nQUESTION: Ms. Blatt, what is your -- what is\nthe Government's position if the parties had expressly\ndealt with it in the settlement agreement?\nMS. BLATT: We think the right would be subject\nto waiver. We don't think -- we don't see anything in the\ncode that would be --\nQUESTION: So you don't agree with petitioner's\ncounsel that it's a harder case, but wouldn't give it up?\nMS. BLATT:\nWhat we do think, though --\nQUESTION: All right, now, the language in this\nparticular settlement agreement gave up claims arising out\nof or relating to the matter of the State court\nlitigation. Was that not a waiver of this claim?\nMS. BLATT: No, it certainly wasn't a waiver of\nthe right to collect on the debt, and in fact there's an\nexpress preservation of not only the right to collect all\nthe obligations under the promissory note, but to collect\nthe amounts under the settlement agreement, and we think\nto apply a contrary rule, the rule that the court below\napplied, would be unsound for three reasons.\nIt would force creditors and parties trying to\nsettle a case to start negotiating over bankruptcy\ncontingencies that are purely hypothetical, may never\nhappen, and are entirely extraneous to the settlement.\nThe rule adopted by Brown also, our second point, is that\nit reflects the common sense and ordinary understanding\nthat settlements preserve the creditor's right to enforce\nthe settlement agreement and the statutory right to prove\nfraud to render the debt enforceable, notwithstanding\nbankruptcy, and that has been the premise of hundreds, if\nnot thousands of settlement agreements entered into by the\nGovernment that do not refer to bankruptcy contingencies.\nThird, to hold that those settlement agreements\nwaive the creditor's rights in bankruptcy would render\ndebts dischargeable even where the debtor committed fraud,\nand that result would undermine congressional policy to\nfavor the rights of innocent victims of fraud over the\nperpetrators of fraud.\nQUESTION: But you do agree that some fraud\nclaims could be waived as far as the dischargeability,\nbecause you wrote the rights settlement agreement.\nMS. BLATT: Yes, if there was an affirmative\nmanifestation of an intent.\nQUESTION: Why isn't that inconsistent with the\nstatutory policy, just as this case would be?\nMS. BLATT: Because there is a background\npresumption, Justice Stevens, that rights are subject to\nwaiver, and so if there's an intentional relinquishment of\na Federal statutory right, then a court can give that\neffect, but not only is there silence on that issue in\nthis case, there is an express reservation of the right to\nenforce the settlement agreement, and --\nQUESTION: To enforce the settlement agreement.\nMS. BLATT: Yes, and that includes --\nQUESTION: But that's not a reservation of the\nright to sue for fraud.\nMS. BLATT: They're not suing for fraud.\nThey're suing to collect on the settlement agreement for\nthe full amount in bankruptcy. By asking the bankruptcy\ncourt, not only by filing the proof of claim, but to\nrender the debt survivable and enforceable in bankruptcy.\nIt's no different than the settlement judgment in -- in\nBrown.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Blatt.\nMr. Ayer, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. AYER\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. AYER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nI would like to make four points this morning.\nThe first one, to pick up on what Justice O'Connor said, I\nthink there's a fundamental misconception in the question\nas it's presented and as it was described by Mr. Goldblatt\nthis morning, and this conception is that what we're\ndealing with here is a categorical rule that says that\nwhenever you have a settlement, because it's a contract,\nit bars any further pursuit of a nondischarge claim.\nThat is completely inconsistent with the\nholdings of the court below, all of which looked\nspecifically at the language of the release and concluded\nthat what had specifically been released was the right to\npursue the claim under 523.\nSecond --\nQUESTION: This would have been a release in\nState court proceedings?\nMR. AYER: Correct, Your Honor, and -- and that\nleads to the second point, which is that what is at issue\nhere really is the interpretation of the language, the\nspecific language --\nQUESTION: There's no language about 523, which\nyou just said --\nMR. AYER: That's correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: -- this is a standard settlement.\nIt's a compromise. Neither side is admitting anything.\nOne side is not admitting fraud, and the other side isn't\nsaying we've proved fraud. It's just a zero on there.\nMR. AYER: Well, Your Honor, I think what you\nsaid in terms of the language is certainly correct.\nI think the important issue is that this is a settlement\nand, indeed, there is also a -- a voluntary dismissal with\nprejudice in a State court case. I would submit the\nproper analysis of that is to interpret the settlement\nunder State law and then ask the question, is there some\nproblem with Federal bankruptcy law that requires you to\nsomehow override what's been agreed to or what's been done\nin State court.\nQUESTION: But isn't -- isn't the problem with\napproaching it that way -- I -- at least, I think the\nproblem with approaching it that way is that there is no\nState law analog to the issue that is being raised here.\nIn other words, under -- under State law, there was a\nfraud claim, there was a settlement of the fraud claim,\nbut there is no issue under State law about bankruptcy,\nand that is strictly a -- a Federal policy --\nMR. AYER: Well --\nQUESTION: -- and I don't know how we get --\nwe -- we look to State law to find out whether there is\ndoubt or not, but I don't know why State law should be a\nsource of an answer to this Federal question, which is\npeculiarly Federal.\nMR. AYER: Well, I -- I don't think, Your Honor,\nthat it is the final answer, but it seems to me it's\nentirely possible for parties in a State court proceeding\nto enter into a settlement that says, and we hereby\nspecifically release our 523 claim, and had that been --\nQUESTION: They -- they might be able to -- I\nmean, I'll assume for the sake of argument that they might\nbe able to do that, but in -- in that case, the -- the\nissue here would be resolved, on -- on your theory,\ncertainly, by the express agreement with the parties, and\nthey didn't do that, so we've got a case in which they\ndidn't agree on the issue expressly, and I don't see why\nState law, which doesn't have the issue, is a good place\nto look for the answer.\nMR. AYER: Well, I think -- I guess my point,\nYour Honor, is that the question of whether they expressly\nagreed to it becomes a question of interpretation, and I\nwould like to get to arguing that they did, in fact,\nexpressly agree to it. The first --\nQUESTION: Well, didn't Brown versus Felsen\nsuggest some discouragement to the idea of anticipatory\nlitigation in State courts of issues that would arise in\nbankruptcy court?\nMR. AYER: I -- I think Brown versus Felsen\ncertainly expressed the view that they didn't want to\nencourage people to have to affirmatively determine fraud\nin State court when it had been, in fact, been -- been --\nthe issue of nondischargeability had been put into the\nbankruptcy court, but nothing in Brown versus Felsen in\nany way qualifies the proposition that parties can, in a\nState court proceeding, resolve, for example, by trial an\nissue of fraud that would be preclusive under collateral\nestoppel.\nQUESTION: You say it doesn't qualify the\nproposition. It doesn't address the proposition.\nMR. AYER: Correct.\nQUESTION: Suppose --\nMR. AYER:\nin the sense, and then Grogan confirms that collateral\nestoppel does apply, so that if you have a State\nproceeding --\nQUESTION: There's -- there's no collateral\nestoppel here. That argument absolutely dumbfounded me,\nfrankly, because for collateral estoppel, issue\npreclusion, you must have raised, actually litigated,\nthere must be a court determination of the issue, and that\ndetermination must be essential to the judgment. You\ndon't have any actual litigation here, so I don't know how\nyou can --\nMR. AYER: Your Honor, under this Court's\nMatsushita decision, it is perfectly clear that in order\nto determine whether there's issue preclusion, you have to\nlook at the State law in the State where the judgment is\nentered, and -- and the State law, as we indicate in our\nbrief, in North Carolina is that if you have a voluntary\ndismissal with prejudice under the Miller Building case,\nunder the Barnes case, that voluntary dismissal with\nprejudice resolves the issues that were put in issue --\nQUESTION: The only decision that you cite from\nthe North Carolina Supreme Court says, we go down the line\nwith what is the standard understanding of issue\npreclusion, actually litigated, decided, and essential to\nthe judgment.\nMR. AYER: Your Honor, I --\nQUESTION: That's what the North Carolina\nSupreme Court said.\nMR. AYER: I disagree, Your Honor. The -- the\nThomas McInnis case that you're referring to is a case\nwhere what actually happened with regard to the issue of\nwhether prejudgment interest was available was that a\nhusband, in litigating that issue, in fact, failed to\ntimely raise it, and when he failed to timely raise it,\nthe wife was subsequently collaterally estopped from\npursuing it.\nThere's one sentence in the Thomas McInnis case\nthat says, we apply the usual principles of collateral\nestoppel. There are multiple cases, Your Honor, in North\nCarolina that are entirely clear that the rule is that if\nyou have a voluntary dismissal with prejudice, that\nvoluntary dismissal is determinative as though the matter,\nand this of -- almost a quote, as though --\nQUESTION: Well, that would certainly run\nentirely against the stream, and it would run against the\nRestatement of Judgments, which you cite, and that says\nyou must manifest -- yes, parties can make a stipulation\nfinding. They can do it in a consent judgment just as\nthey can in the settlement, but they have to make that\nmanifest.\nMR. AYER: Right.\nQUESTION: The court does not infer that an\nissue that was never litigated was, in fact, decided.\nMR. AYER: I guess what -- what I would like to\nsuggest to -- to the Court is that what we do have here is\na settlement of a State court litigation followed by a\nvoluntary dismissal with prejudice, that the effect of\nthat, of those acts, including the language, because\nthat's what the courts here -- all three of these courts\nfocus specifically on the precise language, and they\nconcluded that that language was a waiver. I would submit\nthat was --\nQUESTION: Well, if they concluded that it's a\nwaiver of claim, and we don't have any -- I presume no one\nhas a problem with that. The question is whether there\nis -- is a waiver on the disputed fact issue, and -- and\nmy -- my question to you is, you -- you refer to the\nmyriad State law cases that hold in your favor. Is it\nclear that those are cases on issue preclusion --\nMR. AYER: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: -- as opposed to claim preclusion --\nMR. AYER: Yes, Your Honor --\nQUESTION: -- or res judicata?\nMR. AYER: The -- the Miller Building case and\nthe Barnes case, both of those cases involved collateral\nestoppel. It was invoked by a new party, and it was\nclearly based upon the fact that the -- that the matter\nhad been -- in one case, it was a voluntary stipulation\nwith prejudice. The other was a voluntary --\nQUESTION: Well, was it a stipulation that --\nthat expressly addressed the -- the fact issue?\nMR. AYER: I don't believe you can tell from the\nopinion, and that's not, certainly, what they rely on.\nThe principle that is stated in those cases in a -- in a\ncategorical way, and I can -- I can read it to the Court,\nis that -- let's see.\nQUESTION: May I read you the language from\nMcInnis, which is the North Carolina Supreme Court? It\nwas not just simply a statement that, we recognize issue\npreclusion in its traditional guise. It was, issue\npreclusion does not apply unless, quote, the prior suit\nresulted in a judgment on the merits, identical issues are\ninvolved, the issue was actually litigated, the issue was\nactually determined.\nNow, you're asking us to reject that as the law\nof the -- North Carolina.\nMR. AYER: Well, I -- I think, Your Honor, there\nare -- there are many Federal court cases that recognize\nthat a matter which is not actually litigated in the sense\nthat it went to trial and was determined after a trial or\na fact-finding. If the parties intend for a settlement\nagreement to be preclusive, and that is incorporated into\na judgment, that will have collateral estoppel effect, and\nthat's what happened --\nQUESTION: Well, are you relying on -- I thought\nyou were relying on North Carolina law.\nMR. AYER: We are. I'm simply trying to point\nout that the notion that there is some sweeping,\noverarching general law that says it always must be\nactually litigated, that that, in fact, is not correct.\nQUESTION: No, I -- no, no, we made it plain,\nand I don't think there's any question here that the\nparties can stipulate, and the stipulation will have --\nwill have the same effect as a finding, but, as the\nRestatement of Judgments points out, that must be made\nmanifest. You don't imply it from words that don't say,\nand we stipulate that this claim is going to be\ndischargeable in bankruptcy.\nMR. AYER: Well, what -- let me suggest to the\nCourt a -- a way in which this was clear. First of all,\nI -- I do really want to emphasize that -- that all three\nof the opinions of the court below, none of them adopt\nthis sort of categorical, it's a contract, therefore the\nright is waived approach. That is not the issue in any of\nthese cases.\nthey reason to the conclusion.\nThe -- the court of appeals, for example,\nspecifically said that, quote, a --\nQUESTION: Where are you quoting from, Mr. Ayer?\nWhat page?\nMR. AYER: Let's see, here. Page 10a of the --\nof the appendix.\nQUESTION: Thank you.\nMR. AYER: The petition appendix.\nThey said, in invoking the novation concept,\nit's necessary --\nQUESTION: Whereabouts on the page are you?\nMR. AYER: It's actually -- I'm sorry, Your\nHonor, it's -- it's 9a. If you look at the end of the\nfirst paragraph, under the novation theory, courts need\nonly address -- wait a minute. I'm sorry, the top of the\npage on 9a. When following the novation theory, the terms\nof the settlement should be examined to determine whether\nthe nondischargeability claims were released.\nThe rest of that page is an examination of the\nterms, and if you look over onto the next page, 10a, they\nquote the West case, which says, a promissory note does\nnot discharge the underlying obligation unless the parties\nexpressly release and substitute the new. That is what\nthese cases are all about, all three of them, and the\nquestion of whether the settlement released the claim is a\nquestion, I would submit, in the first instance -- not in\nthe last instance, but in the first instance, it's a\nquestion of State law, and --\nQUESTION: I think there's no dispute that the\nsettlement released the claim. There's no dispute that\nthere was a novation here. There's no dispute that they\nno longer have the original fraud claim. They have a\nclaim only on the promissory note that they got as a\nresult of the settlement, so it -- they're -- they're not\nclaiming, oh, we can go back to the day we filed our fraud\ncomplaint. They're saying, we have a debt here, a\npromissory note, and that is the sum total of what we can\nclaim.\nMR. AYER: Right, but Your Honor, the -- the\nholding of all the courts below went beyond what Your\nHonor is saying.\nQUESTION: The words that you read --\nMR. AYER: Well --\nQUESTION: -- are simply supportive of that --\nMR. AYER: -- let me -- let me --\nQUESTION: -- but you can't -- you can't get\nanything more than the amount of the promissory note that\nresults from the settlement.\nMR. AYER:\nexample, to 35a of the petition appendix, where it is\nstated that, quote, by including in the release future\nclaims --\nQUESTION: What -- what is this from, this is\nthe opinion of the bankruptcy court?\nMR. AYER: This is the opinion of the bankruptcy\ncourt. I'm just trying to -- this was the consistent\nanalysis in all of these courts. By including in the\nrelease future claims, the court concludes that the\nplaintiffs effectively released and extinguished the\ndischargeability claim which they now seek to assert.\nQUESTION: Well, that's a new, different issue\nthan we granted, isn't it? I mean, that's -- the\nquestion, I take it, is, we're assuming there is a\nnovation, there is a settlement, and fine, and that\nsettlement says, I promise to pay $200,000, so it's a\ndebt. It's a debt for money, and the question is, is it a\ndebt for money obtained by actual fraud?\nMR. AYER: Well --\nQUESTION: If so, how do we characterize that\ndebt?\nMR. AYER: I --\nQUESTION: You're saying it was, but it was\nreleased. I -- I don't see that we reach that.\nMR. AYER:\ndifferent issue than you granted, I guess -- I -- I agree\nthat the question as it was presented in the petition --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. AYER: -- is most easily read as this broad,\nblanket rule. That is not --\nQUESTION: Well, I -- I would assume that the\ntext and the wording here that you're relying on, and the\nrule of the State about a novation and so forth, are --\nare prevalent, not universal, but are -- are the standard\nform of -- of settlement and release in almost every\nState, and apparently the novation rule is standard as\nwell, so the -- the result that you're asking us to reach\nis that this also forecloses any Federal characterization\nof this as being a debt incurred by fraud, and -- and\nthat's a very sweeping statement, and a very sweeping\nrule.\nMR. AYER: Well, I -- I think -- I think there\nis -- I think the ultimate question, and the last question\nand the fourth question I'm hoping to get to, and I will\nget to now, is the question of, if -- if you agree with me\nfor purposes of argument that initially, you look to see\nwhat the State settlement does and, indeed, here also what\nthe effect under State law of the voluntary discharge with\nprejudice is -- voluntary dismissal with prejudice is,\nand -- and you see, as these courts below held, that the\neffect is, in fact, to give up the right, then the\nquestion is, is there something about Federal bankruptcy\nlaw or policy that prevents parties from voluntarily\nagreeing to do that?\nQUESTION: May I go back just one step? Suppose\nthis settlement had been entered as a consent judgment,\njust as was the case in Brown against Felsen, what then?\nMR. AYER: I think it would depend, Your Honor,\nwhat was in the consent judgment.\nQUESTION: Nothing. The Court just enters --\nthere's -- the parties' settlement is incorporated in the\nconsent judgment.\nMR. AYER: I -- I think it would become a\nquestion of whether, under the laws of the place where the\nconsent judgment is entered, the fact that there's a\nsettlement that is somehow appended to that order, if it's\nappended, whether that becomes limiting or defining of the\nterms of what's agreed to.\nIf all you have -- I would agree with this. If\nall you have --\nQUESTION: Wasn't -- in -- in Brown against\nFelsen, there wasn't -- the settlement was not on the\nrecord?\nMR. AYER: There's -- there's no discussion,\nYour Honor.\nFelsen, and the critical difference between Brown and this\ncase is that there was no -- there was no kind of any\nrelease of a fraud claim. You simply had the settlement,\nand the -- the creditor got paid, and -- and nobody had\nyet proven affirmatively that there was fraud.\nWhat this Court said is, on those facts, you get\nto come in and prove fraud.\nQUESTION: Okay, so you're -- you're then\nconceding the following, is that right, that if, in fact,\nI owe you $300,000 because I cheated you by fraud, we then\nenter into a settlement which might be approved by the\ncourt, assume it is, and what that settlement says is, in\nlight of what you claim I did to you, cheat you through\nfraud, I promise to pay $200,000, and you are conceding if\nthat's all there is to the case, that that is\nnondischargeable?\nMR. AYER: I -- I am at least conceding that\nthere's no waiver of the right to argue --\nQUESTION: Well, I want to know on my -- the\nfacts I just gave you --\nMR. AYER: Well, it -- it --\nQUESTION: -- in your opinion --\nMR. AYER: Your --\nQUESTION: -- is that 200,000 debt\nnondischargeable?\nMR. AYER: If it amounts to a clear concession\nthat there was fraud, yes.\nQUESTION: No. What I'm saying is, you have the\nfacts I gave you.\nMR. AYER: Okay.\nQUESTION: Remember what they were.\nMR. AYER: In consideration of --\nQUESTION: You said it was $300,000 obtained by\nfraud. I said, I will settle that by entering into this\npiece of paper which says, I promise to pay 200.\nMR. AYER: I -- I would say --\nQUESTION: Approved by the court.\nMR. AYER: I would -- I would say that that is\nnon -- that is not nondischargeable without affirmatively\nproving fraud, although you would --\nQUESTION: There are -- there are too many\nnegatives in your statement.\nMR. AYER: Well, you --\nQUESTION: I'm lost.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. AYER: That leaves --\nQUESTION: I give -- remember my example. I\nwant to say, in your opinion, is that nondischargeable,\nyes or no?\nMR. AYER:\n(Laughter.)\nMR. AYER: It is not clear from the hypothetical\nthat it is nondischargeable, but it is certainly not --\nyou have the opportunity to come into bankruptcy court and\nprove fraud. Your -- your hypothetical does not establish\nfraud.\nQUESTION: Oh, okay, but you're saying you have\nan opportunity --\nMR. AYER: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- to prove the fraud?\nMR. AYER: Absolutely.\nQUESTION: And your case is different from that\nin -- I gave in which respect?\nMR. AYER: In the respect --\nQUESTION: In the release?\nMR. AYER: In the respect that our case included\nlanguage which was interpreted by all three of these\ncourts as a release -- under State law as a release of the\nright to go to bankruptcy court and pursue --\nQUESTION: Fine, and the reason that's in the\nquestion presented is?\nQUESTION: Yes, it isn't in the question\npresented, that's what I thought.\nMR. AYER: The reason it's in the question\npresented is because it's --it is the holding of the case\nbelow.\nQUESTION: Well --\nMR. AYER: The case below doesn't --\nQUESTION: -- the -- the question presented,\nMr. Ayer, is whether a debt that would otherwise be\nnondischargeable becomes dischargeable if the parties\nenter a settlement agreement under which the amount of the\ndebt is -- it literally doesn't say anything about fraud\nor collateral estoppel.\nMR. AYER: That's correct, Your Honor. I guess\nwhat I would say is that that question is --\nQUESTION: You're answering the question. You\njust want to answer it, maybe, right?\nMR. AYER: Well, that's right. The answer is\nmaybe, and it depends --\nQUESTION: Sometimes yes, sometimes no.\nMR. AYER: -- and what it depends upon is, has\nthere been a basis on which to conclude that that right\nhas been given up, and the answer is that no such basis\narises simply because there's a settlement contract. We\ndo not claim that, and neither did any of the courts\nbelow. There -- there's nobody here in this courtroom or\nin this case who says, that's the rule of law. That you\ncan say it's not the rule of law and everybody will agree\nwith you, but that's not the issue in the case.\nQUESTION: Okay, taking your terms, everybody, I\nguess, agrees that if the settlement agreement said, we\nagree, the two parties, that there was no fraud involved\nin the creation of the debt which this agreement settles,\nthat that would, in fact, be preclusive, that they could\nnot, in fact, prove fraud and -- and nondischargeability.\nWhy is the settlement here like the settlement I just\ndescribed, because that, as I understand it, is your\nargument. There's no legal difference between the\nsettlement we've got here, which says nothing about fraud,\nand the settlement that I described in which fraud is\nexpressly addressed. Why are the two alike?\nMR. AYER: Well, one reason why, and this --\nthis gets back to my point that I think you have to take a\nState court settlement under State law first to understand\nit, this -- this settlement, among the other language of\nreleases which we've talked about, also includes language\nthat commits to filing a voluntary dismissal with\nprejudice.\nNow, as I've indicated, in order --\nQUESTION: Well, isn't -- isn't that what any\nneither party settlement does?\nMR. AYER: Well, it may or may not, Your Honor,\nbut in this case in North Carolina, under North Carolina\nlaw, under Miller Building and Barnes, when you file a\nvoluntary dismissal with prejudice, it is as though the\nmatter were litigated to a conclusion and the plaintiff\nlost, and --\nQUESTION: I thought that --\nQUESTION: So far as --\nQUESTION: I thought that was true, certainly\ntrue as far as claim preclusion goes.\nMR. AYER: Right. It's --\nQUESTION: It's claim-precluded, but you\nconstantly mixed up --\nMR. AYER: Well --\nQUESTION: -- claim preclusion and issue\npreclusion --\nMR. AYER: Well, Your Honor --\nQUESTION: -- and yes, a voluntary dismissal\nwith prejudice is preclusive of that claim. You can never\nbring that claim again, but it resolves no issues.\nMR. AYER: Well, Your -- Your Honor, that --\nthat is the law in many places. That is not the law in\nNorth Carolina, and I simply -- I know this Court doesn't\nspend its time deciding State law issues, but --\nQUESTION: I haven't seen a single North\nCarolina Supreme Court decision that so holds, that a\nvoluntary -- I thought that North Carolina rules, by the\nway, were based on the Federal rules with respect to the\nvoluntary dismissal rule. Isn't that so?\nMR. AYER: I -- I think the rules are somewhat\nsimilar. I've not studied them to know how precisely\nparallel they are.\nQUESTION: And -- and the voluntary dismissal is\nclaim-preclusive but not issue-preclusive?\nMR. AYER: Well, let me -- let me just quote,\nbecause I -- I've found it -- the language in Miller\nBuilding and Barnes is that a voluntary dismissal with\nprejudice, quote, precludes subsequent litigation to the\nsame extent as if the action had been prosecuted to a\nfinal adjudication adverse to the plaintiff.\nQUESTION: All right, Mr. Ayer, let's assume\nthat that particular reason isn't necessarily going to\npersuade all of us here. Do you have another reason to\nsay that the agreement, the settlement here should be\ntreated in law by this Court under the Bankruptcy Code\njust like a settlement that expressly says there wasn't\nany fraud? Do you have any other reason?\nMR. AYER: I think the language of the release\nis quite clear. The language of the release talks about\nreleasing any and all rights, including future rights.\nQUESTION: Well, but it's a question of Federal\nlaw as to whether that includes a nondischargeability\nclaim.\nI think that's --\nMR. AYER: Well, let me --\nQUESTION: -- that's going to be the same in\nevery State, which is what I've asked. The very first\nquestion we asked, or I asked, was whether or not this was\na rule depends on the -- the vagaries of the law of North\nCarolina or not.\nMR. AYER: Well -- and let me suggest, Your\nHonor, that -- that in order --\nQUESTION: And I would -- I would have to agree\nwith what Justice -- Justice Ginsburg seems to be\nindicating, that this -- that what you're saying is that\nthere's issue preclusion as to an issue that's never been\nlitigated.\nMR. AYER: Well, and the parties --\nQUESTION: That's astounding.\nMR. AYER: But I think we know under Arizona v.\nCalifornia and other decisions that parties can do that if\nthey in -- if they indicate an intention to do it, and the\nquestion is, have they done that here.\nLet me --\nQUESTION: Can I ask -- this -- this puzzles me.\nIs it, indeed, a question of Federal law whether a\ncontract which -- which gives up all future rights in\nconnection with this claim includes -- whether -- whether\nthe contract includes the right to claim\nnondischargeability?\nMR. AYER: No, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Is -- is that a Federal question or a\nState question?\nMR. AYER: I think -- I believe it's not, and I\nreally feel --\nQUESTION: What do you -- you think it's a\nquestion of State law?\nMR. AYER: I believe it's a question of State\nlaw.\nQUESTION: It's a question of Federal law what\nthe consequence --\nMR. AYER: Correct.\nQUESTION: -- of that State contract is.\nMR. AYER: Absolutely.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. AYER: And let me address, if I could, what\nI view as the logical way to think about this. Once you\nhave a State contract that is given meaning under State\nlaw, the question is, is that somehow to be modified or\noverridden in light of Federal bankruptcy policy, and what\nwe have here, on the other side, I think, are two\ndifferent views.\nWe have one view of the petitioners that it can\nnever be done, there's no way, bankruptcy policy won't\nallow it, and the other view of the Government is that,\nwell, you can do it if it's clear enough, and then you get\ninto nice questions of what, I guess, our Federal common\nlaw --\nQUESTION: Your view, Mr. Ayer, would simply\nencourage anticipatory litigation of issues that might\narise in bankruptcy, which I think Brown suggests is not a\ngood idea.\nMR. AYER: Your Honor, I think all -- all our\napproach does is allow parties to enter into settlements\nto be given what effect they have.\nQUESTION: Well, but, I -- I think here, too,\nprobably there's general agreement. If in so many words\nyou say in the State court settlement, I waive my right to\nclaim nondischargeability in bankruptcy, probably\neverybody would say, or a majority would say yes, but you\ndon't have that here.\nMR. AYER: Well, what it -- I mean, I guess the\nnext question would be, what else might be adequate, and\ndo you really want to develop a -- a body of Federal law.\nLet me, if I could, just point to the arguments on the\nother side why this should be treated as essentially a\nFederal override of State law interpretive principles is\nbased first upon citation of a number of express\nprovisions of the Bankruptcy Code which have nothing to do\nwith the subject and, I think, prove the opposite point.\nThere's a whole section on debtor reaffirmations\nwhich set up detailed procedures that the bankruptcy court\nenforces to make sure that debtors don't get taken\nadvantage of, and they are specific, and they're clear,\nand the bankruptcy court follows them. That's an occasion\nfor the bankruptcy court to get involved.\nThere's the idea that the automatic stay cannot\nbe voluntarily given up. Again, that's the product of\nspecific language that creates an automatic stay to\nprotect the debtor and has 18 itemized exceptions,\nspecific language. There -- they invoke the preference\nprovisions which let, of course, the bankruptcy court go\nback into transactions that occur prior to bankruptcy, and\nlook at them on very specific terms set forth in section\n547. They talk about the fraudulent conveyance section\ndoes the same thing in a slightly different way, but there\nare no such provisions whatsoever with regard to waivers\nof section 523 claims. Section 523 claims are something\nthat the creditor loses if he does not affirmatively file\nwithin 60 days of the first meeting of creditors. There\nare no protections with regard to that in the code, and\nif -- if something isn't filed, they disappear.\nIndeed, the whole idea that creditors are --\nthat -- that the issues with regard to nondischargeability\nunder (a)(2), (a)(4), (a)(6), and (a)(15), are made a\nmatter of exclusive Federal jurisdiction, the reason for\nthat, and your case and Brown talk specifically about\nthat, was because creditors were abusing the process by\npursuing them. This is not a protection for creditors.\nThis is a -- a way of making sure creditors don't come in\nafter bankruptcy and basically put the screws to -- to\ndebtors who have gotten a discharge.\nWhat language there is -- and we talk about this\nin both the briefs, I think specific language runs counter\nto this. We talked in the briefs about (a)(11) and\n(a)(19), which specifically mention settlements, and I\nwould submit the better interpretation of that language is\nto say, in those instances where the language specifically\nsays that any settlement may give rise to a\nnondischargeable claim, is to allow the bankruptcy court\nto go back in and look at those facts even if the right to\na nondischarge -- right to pursue nondischarge was given\naway.\nI think the bottom line is that the arguments on\nthe other side relate to a series -- they don't relate to\nany language of the code, other than the much overbroad\nidea that it -- that it's any debt, and of course that\ndoesn't mean that a party can't be foreclosed from\nlitigating the 523 claim because he's already lost it in\nState court, so any doesn't mean absolutely every.\nThe policies that are invoked are, first, the\nhonest but unfortunate debtor policy, but nobody here,\nI think, seriously suggests that a party can't give the\nthing away, give the right away if they want to, and so\nI think -- give the right to pursue the 523 action away by\nclear enough language. That seems to be the -- the\npetitioner I think disagrees with me, but other than that,\nI think the better view is that they can, and I don't\nthink this Court in any of its cases has ever suggested\nthat the honest but unfortunate debtor policy forecloses\nrelying on prior resolutions under State law. Collateral\nestoppel certainly applies, and we think settlement\nlanguage that's clear ought to apply.\nThey claim that allowing this is some sort of a\ntrap for the unwary. It would be a trap if the rule were\nthis categorical rule that says, boy, you enter into a\nsettlement contract, you lose your 523 claim. That's not\nthe issue in the case. The issue is, does the language\nhere support the -- the idea that the -- the right to\npursue the 523 claim has been given up, and to hold\nparties to the State law effect of releases that they sign\nis no trap for the unwary. That's how we do litigation in\nthis country every day.\nQUESTION: Mr. Ayer, may I ask you this\nquestion: You started out telling us you were going to\nmake four points. I know what one, two, and four are, but\nI'm just curious as to what three was.\nMR. AYER: Three was the State law point. I --\nI guess -- three was the point that when you look at State\nlaw here, the reading of -- the fair reading of State law\ndoes, indeed, support the State law rulings of all three\nof the courts below, and point four, of course, is that\nthere's no reason in Federal law to go back and say no, we\nhave to second-guess that.\nQUESTION: I -- I suppose after this case, no\nmatter which way it goes, you can have an Archer clause\nin -- in the settlement agreement. I -- I've never seen a\nsettlement agreement in which the parties agree that it's\ngoing to be nondischargeable. As a matter of common\ncourse, do these clauses appear in contracts, or --\nMR. AYER: I'm not aware of it, Your Honor.\nThey certainly can if they want to.\nQUESTION: I know they can.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Ayer.\nMR. AYER: Thank you, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Mr. Goldblatt, you have 4 minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CRAIG GOLDBLATT\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. GOLDBLATT: Okay. Thank you. I only have\nfour points. First, with respect to the State law\nquestion of preclusion, we say in our reply brief on pages\n7 and 8 that that issue had been waived. I don't want to\nbelabor that point, but I -- I will point out that the\nbrief respondent filed in the court of appeals, which\nis -- which is, of course, in the record here, states\nState law correctly. There, on page 29 in the court of\nappeals respondent said, there is no issue of collateral\nestoppel in this case because there have never been any\nevidentiary findings.\nWe submit that's a correct statement of State\nlaw. None of the North Carolina cases cited by respondent\ninvolved a case in which a settlement agreement is given\npreclusive effect.\nSecond, with respect to the language of this\nparticular release, it would certainly present a harder\ncase if you had a situation which the release said, we\ngive up all of our rights in bankruptcy, and in the event\nyou file for bankruptcy, we will not make any effort to\ncollect on the debt. This release is quite far from that,\nand expressly preserves the right at all points to recover\non the amount that was promised in the promissory note,\nand this Court's opinion in Brown makes clear as a matter\nof Federal law that what a nondischargeability action is\nis simply an action to enforce the obligations that were\npromised as part of the settlement.\nFinally, the question of the form of the debt,\nand whether the form of the debt drove the decision below,\nthere -- the court of appeals certainly does say -- and\nthis is in the joint appendix at page 8 -- I'm sorry,\npage 9a, footnote 8. It explains quite clearly that a\nbasis for its decision is the notion that the creditor was\nsubstituting the tort claim, the fraud claim for a\ncontract claim and rests its decision on that basis.\nThe consequence of that decision would be that\nfrom the creditor's perspective, if a creditor has an\nunliquidated claim, and this applies not only to claims\nfor fraud but, say, an injury caused by drunk-driving, any\nof the categories of nondischargeability, if you have an\nunliquidated claim and they file for bankruptcy, you can\ncontend its nondischargeable.\nIf, on the other hand, you've litigated all the\nway to judgment, under Brown you can say in bankruptcy,\neven if the judgment doesn't say what it's for, that\nthat's nondischargeable. It would create an anomalous\nsituation in which the middle category, cases that are\nresolved in settlement agreements that don't resolve the\nquestion of liability, the rights in bankruptcy to show\nnondischargeability is given up, and because the code\nmakes clear that the form of the debt is irrelevant to\npersons of dischargeability, and because this Court's\ndecision in Brown versus Felsen is essentially\nindistinguishable from this case, we submit the decision\nbelow should be reversed.\nQUESTION: It's rather unfortunate,\nMr. Goldblatt, that there's nobody in the room to defend\nthe position that I understood was taken by the question\npresented, namely that a novation -- a novation is all you\nneed. I think that's, at least, an arguable position,\nbut -- but nobody -- nobody seems to want to --\nMR. GOLDBLATT: We agree that -- that --\nQUESTION: -- discuss the issue on -- on which\nwe took the case.\nMR. GOLDBLATT: Your Honor, we -- we agree, as\nwe say in our reply brief, that the principal basis of the\ndecision below has been abandoned by respondent here, and\nwe believe it's been abandoned because it can't be squared\nwith this Court's decision in Brown versus Felsen, which\nholds squarely to the contrary.\nQUESTION: Thank --\nQUESTION: What about the (a)(11) and (a) -- the\n19, the express provisions for nondischargeability?\nMR. GOLDBLATT:\ndoing in -- in sections (a)(11) -- I -- I see my time\nhas -- has run out, but what Congress was doing in (a)(11)\nand (a)(19) was giving preclusive effect --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you,\n"
