GOLDSTEIN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Stevens, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe petitioners in this case are American\ncitizens who took cruises to and from this country on\ntickets bought here that call for the application of U.S.\nlaw. They were subject to discrimination by respondent, a\nU.S.-based company on the land, in the ports, and in the\nwaters of the United States.\nThe question presented is whether the Americans\nWith Disabilities Act applies or instead whether\nrespondent's conduct is lawful because the case is\ncontrolled by Bahamian law, which freely permits cruise\nlines to discriminate against persons with disabilities.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Mr. Goldstein, may I inquire\nof you whether other countries, for instance, in the EU\narea, have applied their own disability laws to some of\nthe cruise ships that touch base in their courts?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice O'Connor, our research\ndoes not reveal that the question has arisen in the EU. I\ncan, however, provide you some information, and that is\nthat -- two points I think.\nThe first is they subscribe -- the members of\nthe EU subscribe to the same conventions and to UNCLOS\njust the way we do, which gives the port state plenary\nauthority within its ports and internal waters. And I\nhave a couple of case citations for you on this issue. In\nthe ECJ, the Diva Navigation case, 1992, ECR I-6019, and\nthe Mateo Peralta case, 1994, ECR I-3453.\nIt has not arisen in the EU, but it has arisen\nin Australia. Australia has a disability law. It applies\nthat law to cruise ships, and the rule in Australia is\nthat the port state law applies rather than the flag state\nlaw. And the citation for that is the Union Shipping\ncase, 2002, NSWCA 124 CA 40379/01. I don't know what\nthose numbers mean.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Thank you.\nAnd would you also address at some point how the\ntreaty on Safety of Life at Sea would affect the\nresolution here? For example, it has, as I understand it,\nrequirements that there be watertight doors and those\ndoors have to be set above the level of the floor so you\ncouldn't roll a handicapped wheelchair or something over\nit. Now, do you anticipate that there would have to be\nstructural changes if you were to prevail that would\nconflict with the treaty on Safety of Life at Sea?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: No, and you have put your finger\non the point, and that is that there are no conflicts. We\nknow that for a couple of reasons.\nThe first is that there has been a detailed\nrulemaking underway in which the regulatory authorities\ncharged by Congress with implementing the ADA have spent\nquite some time. They have produced this single-spaced,\nhalf-inch thick document that is dedicated to making --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Are they in effect yet?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: They are not, but in terms of\nwhether or not the statute, when it's applied, would\nconflict, you would look to this document and they took as\ntheir regulatory mission to make sure there were no such\nconflicts. What they did -- let me take your example\nspecifically and then put -- place it within the statutory\nframework.\nWithin the ADA and a question of the combings,\nwhat they said is, that's right. In certain cases SOLAS\nrequires that the coamings be a certain height. If the\ncoamings are below the bulkhead level, where you would be\nworried about water coming in below, that is not an\naccessible route, and so you don't have to worry about it\nat all. Above there, you ramp up to the coaming and ramp\ndown, unless that's structurally infeasible. So they --\nwhat they did is they -- and this is the broader point.\nthey applied the rule of the ADA that a change to the\nstructure of the vessel only has to be implemented if it's\nreadily achievable. And what the regulatory authorities\ndetermined is that if there is any conflict with SOLAS at\nall, that change need not be made.\nNow, you -- Justice O'Connor, you also focused\non the fact that there are some of our claims that\nimplicate the structure of the ship. They are, however, a\ndistinct minority, and we ought not lose sight of this\nbecause I don't think the other side has any good argument\nat all, under international law or anything else, that\nwould explain why they can charge a person with a\ndisability double.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you tell me just a little\nbit about that, how it works? Suppose that you prevail in\nthis case -- and it does seem to me that the -- the\ncharging the double doesn't involve modification of the\nship, obviously. How does it work if you have, oh, say,\nan English passenger who buys an English ticket and is\ncharged double -- I don't know if that's the English law,\nbut let's assume -- then he comes on a cruise ship and he\ngoes to New York and Miami and -- and New Orleans? Can he\n-- does he -- could he then sue, if -- if we rule for you\nin this case?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I would think on the question of\nthe charging double, the answer to that question would be\nno because it would present a traditional, not unique to\nthe ADA, choice-of-law question, and that is, if you're in\nEngland and you buy a ticket in England, your ticket is\ngoing to be subject to English common -- in that case, the\nEnglish disability law. There is an English disability\nlaw. It doesn't discuss cruise ships. It's -- but it's\nbroadly written.\nBut with respect to the structure of the ship, I\nthink that English passenger with a disability -- say that\nyou come across to the United States and you want to get\noff in New York. I think that Congress clearly intended\nthat that person would be able to come off a -- off the\ndock in a wheelchair, back onto the dock on the\nwheelchair; while you were in U.S. ports and you're\nstaying in your cabin, that you would be able to, in your\naccessible -- your accessible rest room, have grab bars.\nWe are -- and -- and let me not pass too quickly\nby the fact that even when we talk about some structural\nchanges in the ship, by and large we're talking about\nthings that have nothing to do with -- Justice O'Connor,\nyou focused the name of the treaty is the Safety of Life\nat Sea. Whether the bathroom doors swing in and out has\nnothing to do with that. Whether there is --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Goldstein, may -- may I\ntake it from your answer that it doesn't make any\ndifference in your view, your answer to the question about\nthe -- the ship leaving from a port in England and going\nmany places and touching base in New York, that kind of a\nvoyage, or what this case seems to be where the vast\nmajority of the passengers are from the United States, the\nport of departure is in the United States, the port of\nreturn is in the United States. You don't seem to\ndistinguish those cases because you say in the New York\nport, it doesn't matter if it's really a U.S.-centered\ncruise or a cruise centered in Italy or any place else.\nIs that correct?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I think your formulation is\nexactly right, Justice Ginsburg. It doesn't matter to us\nwhere the cruise is centered.\nWe do, however, and this Court's precedents do,\nhowever, leave room for a highly unusual cruise that I'm\nnot aware exists. Take, for example, a situation in which\na cruise comes from England to the United States. It\ndoesn't pick up any passengers here. They just visit.\nThey stop in 15 other countries. They stop here. The\nsame passengers get up on the ship and leave. This\nCourt's precedents involving maritime choice of law leave\nroom for the conclusion that says, look, we just don't\nthink --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But if we go back to what is\nthe more usual situation --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then you are, in effect,\nsaying that the U.S. rules the world. Even if the home\nport, the place where this vessel is usually berthed, says\nwe -- we don't require our ships to take care of the\nhandicapped, you are, in effect, saying no matter what the\nother ports say, what the U.S. law is is going to govern\nbecause practically if you're going to design the ship to\nmeet the U.S. requirements, you're not going to rip those\nout when the ship goes elsewhere.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Ginsburg, we disagree\nwith the characterization that the U.S. rules the world,\nof course. We're talking about the fact that Congress\nexercised its sovereign authority to control vessels in\nits ports and internal waters, just as in -- take the\nCunard example. In the Cunard case, there were countries\n-- and I understand it didn't involve the structure of the\nship, but the principle is the same. There were countries\nthat required alcoholic beverages to be on those vessels,\nand --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We -- we could -- we could\nrequire ships that are docked in the United States to pay\ntheir crews according to United States Jones Act\nrequirements or United States minimum wage laws and so\nforth. We don't do that. We could do it, but we don't\nbecause it conflicts with -- with the law of the flag and\n-- and that's the usual -- it's not a matter of our power\nto do it. We could do it, of course, but it's just not\nsomething we ordinarily do.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, Justice Scalia, I actually\ndisagree with your characterization and would like to\npoint you to a couple of precedents. The Benz and\nMcCulloch cases, which are very important to the\nrespondents, were very important to the Fifth Circuit,\nembody the principle that you just described, to some\nextent, and that is that when you have a foreign ship in\nour waters, we will not apply the NLRA to the labor\ncontract between the foreign crew and the foreign vessel.\nBut when Americans are involved, we do apply the NLRA, and\nthat's the Ariadne precedent that the -- and -- and in\nfact, Ariadne is the most on-point case because it --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Was -- was that the ship or was\nit longshoremen?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: It was longshoremen working on\nthe ship complaining about safety conditions on the ship.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Longshoremen. Longshoremen\nbased -- based on shore. Right?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Based on shore, but so are the\npassengers.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's a different --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: But it is a different situation,\nbut I think it's more analogous. Not only were the -- the\nprotests in Ariadne directed at the safety conditions on\nthe foreign-flagged vessel, but they were directed at the\npassengers. If I could --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What's -- what's the scope of\nwhat you're talking about here? I mean, are -- it says\ncruise ships. So I had assumed those are those big ships\nthat carry people mostly around the Mediterranean from\nFlorida. But based on what you're saying, now I think\nyou're talking about something more. Are you talking, for\nexample, about a merchant vessel that comes from, say,\nSaudi Arabia and has a few passengers? What's the --\nwhat's the scope of the definition?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: The -- well, that -- the\ndefinition -- we would have to return to the ADA. If a\nmerchant ship has a few passengers, it would not be a\nspecified form of public transportation or a public\naccommodation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because? It -- what it does is\nit carries oil, but a certain number of people like to be\non a ship with oil, I guess. And so every -- every month\nthey take 12 people and they put them in a cabin somewhere\nand they love it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's cheaper. It's cheaper\ntoo.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I'm not aware of -- of --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. I -- but all right.\nNow, I'm -- I'm being facetious.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But I am aware of -- of people\nwho have certainly gone on cruises on what is a primarily\nmerchant ship. Now that -- that I think is a common\nthing.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: If -- let me --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Are you talking -- because I\nthink that makes a difference for the reason that once you\ntalk about those, you're talking about primarily foreign-\nflagged vessels that are rarely but sometimes in the\nUnited States where the costs would be very high probably\nto change the ship and the benefit to Americans would be\ntiny. All right. So I -- I want to know what you're\ntalking about.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay. Let me first say -- and\njust to -- to lock the point down in that cost is\naccounted for in the definition of what is readily\nachievable.\nBut let's go to the definition of specified public\ntransportation because this will tell us what's going to\nbe covered by the ADA. And just for the transcript, the\ncitation is -- this is section 12181(110). It's -- it's\nvery short, but it's at the middle of page 12 of the blue\nbrief. Specified public transportation means\ntransportation by bus, rail, or any other conveyance other\nthan by aircraft, which has its own statute, that provides\nthe general public with general or special service on a\nregular and continuing basis. That too would be covered.\nAnd only the public places on the ship would be covered by\nit.\nCan I just return briefly to my Ariadne point?\nBecause I just wanted -- that's a case where the -- the\nNLRA was applied. And let me just read to you what the\nprotest was that the NLRA was applied to because it fits\nperfectly with this case. And again, for the transcript,\nthis is in the lower court opinion at 215 So.2d 53. This\nwas the handbill. Warning. Is your cruise ship a\nfloating death trap? Can a substandard foreign-flagged\ncruise ship turn your holiday into a Holocaust? They were\nvery illiterate. If thousands of unsuspecting Americans\ncontinue to place their lives in jeopardy every day on\ncruises aboard foreign-flagged floating fire traps. And\nthat -- that was a foreign-flagged ship. They we're\nconcerned about the passengers.\nJustice Scalia, you also gave the example of the\nJones Act, but remember that the Rhoditis case and the\nUravic case, which involved injuries in the United States,\nthen the Jones Act did apply. And that was -- and\nRhoditis was a case in which someone was on the ship and a\nchain broke and they were injured as a result of it, and\nU.S. law applied.\nThis is a situation in which millions of people\nin the United States are spending billions of dollars on\ncruises, and it seems --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but I -- if I understand\nyou correctly, your case really isn't limited to cruise\nships. It's limited to ships that come into -- passenger\nships, which would include the Queen Mary and Queen\nElizabeth, all the rest of them. Wouldn't it?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, but I -- I take it that the\n-- you know --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And the fact that it's based\nin Miami or it had mostly American customers really is not\nrelevant to the legal issue. Is it?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: It -- it is in the sense that it\nmakes this the recurring scenario that Congress would have\nbeen aware of when it enacted the ADA in --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But, of course, they would\nhave been aware of those that are also less American in\ntheir patronage and so forth.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: That's true. In the very rare\ncase, which I am not aware of, in which a cruise ship\ncomes to the United States, doesn't pick up passengers,\nthen it's possible that the -- that the ADA would not\napply.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, but we're not necessarily\nthinking of a cruise ship, just the transatlantic liner\nthat goes from Liverpool to Miami or something. That\nwould be covered.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: It would in -- in U.S.\nterritory. That's right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But there's no way they can\nchange the ship structurally when it's in New York and not\nhave it changed structurally when it's in Europe. So the\nmystery to me at this moment is what is the universe of\nships that I would not say fit the ordinary word cruise.\nWhat they are are ships that go between Asia and San\nFrancisco, Los Angeles, or New York and Europe, or maybe\nthrough the Suez Canal. They're only here a little bit of\nthe time. Their passengers are mostly not American.\nNow, is that something I should worry about? If\nthat were your case, I would be very worried. If that's\njust a little bit of -- of added significance, then I want\nto know what to do about it.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Let me tell you what I know, and\nthat is that the other side has not identified any\nproblems of this -- this type. My research has not\nrevealed some situation where we have a lot of these\nships. I did carefully study the -- the itineraries of\nthe major cruise lines, and 95 percent-plus of all of\ntheir trips go out from the United States and come back to\nthe United States.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you told me -- and I want\nto make sure this is your answer -- that it doesn't\nmatter, that as long as the ship comes to a U.S. port as\npart of this overall journey, you -- you answered that\nquestion and I thought that was your candid answer, that\nit doesn't matter that these -- these particular cruise\nships ply mostly U.S. waters and U.S. trade and are\ncentered, even have their principal place of business in\nthe United States. You're not concentrating on that\ncategory. You are saying that the ADA applies so long as\nthe ship puts in at -- at a U.S. port, picks up\npassengers. It applies not only while it's in the port,\nbut practically for every other place the ship goes.\nThat's why I asked isn't this the United States rules the\nworld on what -- your argument you made.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Ginsburg, here I think\nis the difference, and that is, that while U.S. law may\nhave an extraterritorial consequence, just like our\nmaritime tort law and the like, you cannot in Europe\nenforce the ADA. The fact that the structural changes --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you can enforce the --\nthe discrimination provisions, but the structural\nprovisions don't have to be enforced. Once the step is\nchanged, they're not going to change it when they get 3\nmiles out.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: That's right. But Justice --\nJustice Ginsburg's point -- I take it to be a more\nparticular one. It's true that our law will have\nconsequences abroad, but it is not the case that the U.S.\nrules the world.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it rules the world unless\nthe world does not want to use the United States ports as\nports of call.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice -- Justice Souter, I --\nI simply disagree, and that is, when you talk about the\nU.S. ruling the world, in a -- in the context, say, of\nARAMCO, we talked about the enforceability of U.S. law\nabroad. When the United States has tort standards or\nvehicle manufacturing standards and the like, all of those\nhave consequences abroad for how devices are made and\nbrought into the country. But that doesn't mean that --\nwhat's going on is the plenary authority of the United\nStates to enforce its laws in its ports and in its\ninternal waters. That very rule always will have\nextraterritorial consequences.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We're not questioning the\nauthority. We're questioning whether Congress intended\nthat to be the case. We have a rule that -- that requires\na clear statement when it has effects of this sort.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Scalia, we disagree, and\nlet me just take you to your cases. I did that, I think,\nin the Jones Act and the NLRA context. But let's just\nstate the rule, and that is, from the Wildenhus's Case and\nthat's at page 12. Foreign law governs matters of\ndiscipline and all things done on board which affected\nonly the vessel and those belonging to her and did not\ninvolve the peace or dignity of the country or the\ntranquility of the port. And what we're talking --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But, Mr. Goldstein, there's\nanother aspect that troubles me. Your view, as I\nunderstand, only applies while the ship is in American\nwaters so that if, for example, you complain about the\ntraining for a safety drill, if they conducted those after\nthey'd gone out 20 miles to sea, there would be -- there\nwould be no violation of the -- the statue. Would there?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: That is -- that is a difficult\nquestion. We have not -- we have not pleaded such a\nclaim.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: In other words, I'm trying to\nunderstand. You don't know what your position is --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: No.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- with respect to what would\notherwise be violations of the statute that occur on the\nhigh seas.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: We do believe it would be\ncovered because the accommodation was purchased here,\nalthough we haven't raised the claim in this Court.\nIf I could reserve the remainder --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but I think we should --\nthe cruise ships are entitled to know whether they may\nfreely discriminate against people in the casinos and so\nforth when they're on the high seas.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: We --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You don't know the answer to\nthat.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Stevens, our position is\nthat because of the definition of commerce in the ADA,\nwhen you purchase a public accommodation in the United\nStates, that is an agreement to provide a public\naccommodation and it doesn't --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So your view is not limited to\nwhat happens in the territorial waters.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: That is right, although we have\n-- we would win the case on the internal waters and the\nterritorial waters, and we haven't asserted in this Court\na claim relating to the high seas.\nIf I could reserve the remainder of my time.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Salmons, may I ask before\nyou begin whether the United States agrees that the\nstatute would apply to the activities of these ships when\nthey're on the high seas?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID B. SALMONS\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMR. SALMONS: Justice Stevens, and may it please\nthe Court:\nWe do not think that title III of the ADA was\nintended to apply extraterritorially. That said, we think\nthere is a question that would need to be resolved as to\nwhether applying the ADA to a public accommodation that\nwas entered into in the United States, that began in the\nUnited States, a necessary term of which we believe would\nbe nondiscrimination, would in fact be an extraterritorial\napplication of U.S. law.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: When -- when the ship is out on\nthe high seas?\nMR. SALMONS: That's correct, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You think that's a hard\nquestion --\nMR. SALMONS: No. We think the better view --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- whether that's an\nextraterritorial application of U.S. law?\nMR. SALMONS: No. We think the better view, in\nfact, Justice Scalia, is that that would not be an\nextraterritorial application of U.S. law. But if the\nCourt were to disagree, then we would say title III does\nnot apply at that time.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know what\nextraterritorial application means if it doesn't mean\nthat, that a ship that is not in the United States is\nbound by United States law. What -- why isn't that\nextraterritorial application?\nMR. SALMONS: The reason, Justice Scalia, would\nbe because the accommodation that was offered, that was\nentered into, and that began in the United States -- and\n-- and I would point out -- I think this is important to\nkeep in mind --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What you're saying is it would\n-- I thought you were saying that it would be the\nenforcement of the domestic contract of which the -- the\nstatutory provisions would be an implied term. Isn't that\nit?\nMR. SALMONS: Yes. Yes, that's correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It does not apply of its own\nforce. It applies because two parties in the United\nStates contracted that it would apply. Is that it?\nMR. SALMONS: That's correct. Now -- now, I --\nI would just add that I think it -- you could characterize\na public accommodation, you know, five nights lodging, for\nexample. If that's entered into in the United States and\n-- and that begins in the United States, that a necessary\nterm of that is nondiscrimination, and --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, then if you --\nMR. SALMONS: -- if you have an ADA claim that\ngoverns that even if the discrimination occurred abroad,\nthat would only relate to those things tied into the\naccommodation.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But if you're on a round trip\nticket from Liverpool to Miami and back, it would depend\non where you bought the ticket.\nMR. SALMONS: Well, again, we -- we think that\nif accommodation begins here in the United States, that --\nthat a necessary term of that is nondiscrimination. Now,\nwhether you characterize that as a contract claim or as a\nsubstantive application of the ADA, I'm not sure there's\nmuch of a difference.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but Justice Stevens'\nquestion is you buy the ticket in Liverpool. Is the ADA\n-- an -- an American buys the ticket in Liverpool to come\nto the United States.\nMR. SALMONS: To come to the United States.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is the ADA an applied term of\nthat contract?\nMR. SALMONS: I would -- I would assume not,\nalthough the question then would be whether or not it's a\npublic accommodation that's been offered in the United\nStates.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Don't -- don't all --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Even in U.S. waters? That\nwouldn't make sense. An American buys a ticket in -- in\nLiverpool. He's disabled. He goes to New York, Miami,\nNew Orleans, and he's discriminated at -- at each step.\nNo -- no coverage just because of where he bought the\nticket?\nMR. SALMONS: No, no, Justice Kennedy, that's\nnot our position. Let me -- let me try and be clear. We\nthink that any vessel that comes into the internal waters\nand ports of the United States and offers a public\naccommodation or a specified public transportation service\nto our residents is subject to the ADA.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, that means --\nMR. SALMONS: If -- if you had a situation --\nI'm sorry.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, go ahead.\nMR. SALMONS: If you had a situation where you\nhad a ship that -- let's say, that began in -- in Great\nBritain and came here, it didn't pick up passengers here\nin the United States, I think that the better view would\nbe, sure, United States law could apply to it because it's\nin our internal waters, but that as a substantive matter,\nwith regard to the ADA, I don't know why that would be a\npublic accommodation within the meaning of the ADA because\nit's not an accommodation that's offered --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But do you --\nMR. SALMONS: -- or available to United States\nresidents.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you agree with Mr.\nGoldstein that nothing turns on -- one might characterize\nthis kind of cruise as U.S.-centered, but his answer was\nas long as they put in, a regular cruise stop, they pick\nup, they unload passengers, they take them back again on\nthe ship, so long as they touch base at a U.S. port,\nletting off and picking up passengers, the ADA applies?\nDo you agree with that interpretation?\nMR. SALMONS: As I understand what Your Honor\njust said, I think that I would. Let me just clarify,\nthough. We think the relevant question is whether that\nship would -- has offered a public accommodation or a\nspecified public transportation service --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: This is my --\nMR. SALMONS: -- in the United States, and if\nthe answer is yes --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Let -- let me ask you the\nsame question that I asked Mr. Goldstein. Even in the\nCunard case, the prohibition case, they couldn't have\nliquor in the U.S. port, but when they leave and they go\nto Jamaica, they could pick up rum there. They could have\nliquor all the rest of the time so long as, when they\nenter and leave the U.S. port, they didn't have the liquor\naboard.\nHere what you're saying is what goes in the --\nfor the New York port goes for every other place where\nthis ship puts in.\nMR. SALMONS: Well, again, I -- not as a matter\nof -- not as a matter of extraterritorial application of\nU.S. law, but that is our position with regard to a public\naccommodation that begins in the United States. I -- I\nthink the -- the important --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose it doesn't begin in\nthe United States in that it -- it starts in, say, The\nBahamas, and stops at --\nMR. SALMONS: I should probably should not have\nsaid begin, Your Honor. What I mean is if it -- if the\npublic accommodation is provided for in the United States,\nthat would be covered by the terms of the ADA, we think\nthe ADA applies.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then you're saying exactly what\neverybody is worried about. I take it there is no way\nreally for a ship to -- they either have the right door or\nthey don't have the right door. And we're interested in\nthe set of cases in which they're going to have to change\ntheir doors. And what I came in here thinking was we're\ntalking about ships that pick up people and sail in\nFlorida and sail around the Caribbean. That's the -- now,\nI've heard nothing but we're not talking just about those.\nWe are talking about ships like I'm the last human being\nalive that went on a Swiss ship to Europe. Okay?\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: 50 years ago. And -- and we're\ntalking about those ships, or we're talking about merchant\nships that also say to the public, come as a passenger.\nNow, I would like to -- not what you're arguing.\nYou're going to say, yes, we are arguing it. I want to\nknow -- say something to relieve my concern about that\nset, which was Justice Ginsburg's concern. We are trying\nto rule the world in respect to those ships that only come\nhere occasionally or it isn't a big part of their\nbusiness, but they want to come to pick up American\npassengers.\nMR. SALMONS: Sure. Sure. And what I would say\nwith regard to that is that you're right that our broad\nview is that the ADA applies if that -- if they're\noffering public accommodation here in the United States.\nBut if you reject that, I think there are\nseveral ways you could approach that. One would be to\napply traditional choice-of-law factors that are -- that\nare applicable in maritime, and you could conclude, you\nknow, based on sort of whether or not there are sufficient\ncontacts here and whether or not --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you're saying that this\nis your position, but don't worry about it because we'll\nreject your position?\nMR. SALMONS: No, no. He asked me to say\nsomething that -- that would -- would help his concerns.\nWhat I'm trying to say --\nJUSTICE BREYER: One thing might be true, what\nyou're not saying, is there really aren't very many of\nthose ships, or another thing you might say, which you're\nnot saying because maybe isn't true, is almost all of\nthose ships that there are are already subject to tougher\n-- tougher rules, say, in Europe. But you don't say\neither of those.\nMR. SALMONS: No. No --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Since you don't you say either\nof those, I think neither may be true.\nMR. SALMONS: Well, I don't know the specific\nnumber. I would think that there are not many that the --\nthat this -- what you're concerned with primarily here are\ncruise ships that are in the business of providing public\naccommodations.\nBut I would add as well -- and I think this is\nvery important that the Court keep in mind -- that the\nclear statement rule, as it's -- as it's posited by\nrespondent here, would not just apply to the ADA. It\nwould apply to all U.S. laws, and that would include title\nII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in its prohibition of\nracial discrimination, and I would find that that would be\na remarkable construction.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It depends on what -- what kind\nof laws you're talking about. Laws that require the crew\nto be treated differently are -- are quite different from\nlaw -- laws that -- that require a passenger to be treated\na certain way in the United States.\nMR. SALMONS: Justice Scalia, you're correct,\nand that's precisely why they have --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And laws -- laws that require\nstructural alteration of a ship are quite different from\nlaws that say while you're in United States waters, you\nwon't discriminate on the basis of race.\nMR. SALMONS: If -- two -- two responses, if I\nmay, Your Honor. And that is, if you -- if that is the\nconclusion you reach, then you still need to remand this\ncase because there are an awful number of claims that are\nprecisely those kinds of claims that the Fifth Circuit\nwould not allow.\nSecondly, I think you're wrong with regard to\nthe scope of the clear statement requirement. There is no\nrequirement that you have to have a clear statement to\napply a U.S. law to a foreign vessel. There is only a\nrequirement that you need a clear statement if the conduct\nat issue would relate only to the internal matters of that\nvessel. And here you're dealing with public\naccommodation --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If we haven't expressed it yet,\nwe ought to express it then.\nMR. SALMONS: Well, I disagree, Your Honor. And\nwhat I would point you to is -- is that the long -- every\ntime this Court has spoken with regard to the clear\nstatement requirement relating to foreign-flagged ships,\nit has referred to the internal order doctrine. And that\nis embodied in a number of bilateral agreements that go\nback for centuries. The -- the treaty that was at issue\nin the Wildenhus's Case expressly said that if the -- if\nthe conduct did not relate to members of the crew but to\npassengers or other members of the port state or otherwise\naffected the interests of the port state, that the port\nstate law would apply. And that is the general rule.\nThe international regime that governs this area\nby its terms provide minimum standards and leaves it\navailable to port states and to flag states to add\nadditional requirements. That would mean --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Salmons, one of the\nalternatives you threw out, not as a response to clear\nstatement, but as a -- a response to the issue that was\nbeing raised by it, was the provision of the statute that\nit was intended to exercise the -- the fullest extent of\nthe -- of the commerce power. And The -- The Bahamas\nrespond to that by saying you could have said exactly --\nor argued exactly the same thing in McCulloch. What is\nyour response to that?\nMR. SALMONS: Well, I -- I would disagree with\nthat on -- on a couple of respects. The first is that the\ndefinition of commerce here is broader than it was and\nspecifically refers to travel between the United States\nand foreign countries. The only other statute we're aware\nof that says that is title II of the Civil Rights Act of\n1964.\nIn addition --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, may I just ask you a -- a\nfactual question? I didn't go back to the text to check\nthis. Does the text of this statute say in these words\nbasically we are exercising the fullest possible extent of\nthe commerce power?\nMR. SALMONS: Absolutely, Justice Souter. What\n-- what the text of the statute says --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And it's not in McCulloch.\nMR. SALMONS: That's correct. What the text of\nthis statute says is that -- in fact, this is the\ndefinition of commerce that relates only to title III of\nADA. And it says precisely that it includes travel\nbetween foreign countries and the United States and that\nCongress was intending to -- to reach the full sweep of\nits -- its constitutional authority.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Salmons.\nMr. Frederick.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. FREDERICK: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThis case is about congressional intent not\ncongressional power. Congress undoubtedly has the\npower --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Could you address the last\npoint?\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes. It was not the fullest\nextent of the commerce power. That statute was at issue\nin this Court's case concerning the Lanham Act where the\nCourt said that a violation of the Lanham Act that\noccurred in Mexico but had an effect in the United States\nwas intended to be covered by Congress because that\ncommerce clause, Justice Souter, did state to the fullest\nextent of Congress' power under the Commerce Clause of the\nConstitution.\nThis statute does not say that. This statute\ntalks about commerce in and between States and\nterritories, and it is much closer to the statute language\nthat this Court addressed in the ARAMCO case where --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So it -- it doesn't have the\nfullest extent language then.\nMR. FREDERICK: That's correct. That's correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How does it compare to title\nII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964?\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, there are slight\ndifferences in the language, but I don't think that's\ndispositive because title VII of the Civil Rights Act,\nwhich this Court addressed in the ARAMCO case, the Court\n-- the Chief Justice's opinion there said that that\nlanguage was not enough to express the intent.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So that would be the same for\ntitle II, which is the public accommodations part of the\nCivil Rights Act of 1964. So I take it that you are\nsaying that on these foreign-flagged vessels, just as the\nADA would be inapplicable, so title II, the public\naccommodations part of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, would\nbe inapplicable.\nMR. FREDERICK: It's all a question of\ncongressional intent, Justice Ginsburg, and there's no\nindication of an intent that Congress needed to address\nany problem that arose with respect to that form of\ndiscrimination.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So your -- but your answer\nis, there being no such indication, that a ship putting in\nat a U.S. port was free to discriminate among its\npassengers on the basis of race.\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, there would be no U.S.\ncongressional statute that would address that, Justice\nGinsburg. There would be a violation of the Bahamian\nconstitution which prohibits --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm asking about the U.S. law\nand policy which says no segregation, no discrimination in\nplaces of public accommodation.\nMR. FREDERICK: As I said, I'm not aware that\nthere has ever been an instance of that in the cruise\nindustry. Congress has not addressed that. We're talking\nabout foreign ships here.\nAnd I want to get back to the structural\nfeatures of the ship because the ADA fundamentally --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, but this is a good\nquestion, and what is your position? That the ship could\nengage in racial discrimination while in U.S. ports on the\nselling of tickets and the provision of accommodations\nwhile in U.S. ports and within the 3 --\nMR. FREDERICK: Justice O'Connor, our position\nis that Congress has not spoken to the question, and so\nthere is no congressional statute that is on point.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then your answer, I take it, is\nyes, it can discriminate and it can discriminate because\nCongress has not told it not to. Is that it?\nMR. FREDERICK: No. No. Our position is that\nit can't discriminate because a different law proscribes\nthat --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So far as United States law is\nconcerned, it could.\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And the same answer for 1981?\nMR. FREDERICK: Justice Ginsburg, as I said,\nCongress has not extended its laws to the full reach of\nU.S. territorial power, and this Court has maintained that\nposition ever since the Charming Betsy case 200 years ago,\nThe Schooner Exchange case, and Brown v. Duchesne.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, let's put it this way.\nSo my understanding of your answer is that we could write\nan opinion ruling for you but leaving these other\nquestions open? I don't see how we can do that.\nMR. FREDERICK: What you say, Justice Kennedy,\nis that the clear statement canon requires Congress to say\nwhen it intends to apply a law to a foreign vessel.\nCongress didn't do that.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But if I'm writing the opinion\nand I put that down and rule for you, it seems to me that\nI then answered necessarily Justice Ginsburg's question in\nthe negative.\nMR. FREDERICK: You do, Justice Kennedy. And\njust as this Court in the ARAMCO case said that title VII\ndoesn't apply to the foreign -- work in a foreign land by\nan American company of an American --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But these --\nMR. FREDERICK: Justice Kennedy, Congress hasn't\nextended criminal laws of the United States to the full\nreach of U.S. power. It is only proscribed 15 offenses\nthat will apply in the special maritime jurisdiction.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Frederick, this is --\nthis is what concerns me about your answer. I know that\nMr. Goldstein took the position that it doesn't matter\nwhat kind of operation this is, but the operation that\nwe're dealing with, it sells tickets mainly to -- what\npercentage of its passengers are from the USA?\nMR. FREDERICK: Approximately two-thirds to\nthree-quarters in any given year.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And does it normally start\nthe voyage and end it in U.S. ports?\nMR. FREDERICK: The majority of them do.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And how much of its\nadvertising budget is pitched at U.S. customers?\nMR. FREDERICK: Justice Ginsburg, there -- all\nof those questions are going to be answered as a\npredominant marketing effort, et cetera is directed to the\nU.S. market.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, this is the anomaly.\nYou're asking us to buy an interpretation. An enterprise\nis U.S.-centered in terms of where it gets its business\nand that enterprise, nonetheless, is not bound by what is\nour bedrock anti-discrimination law both with regard to\ncustomers, passengers, and employment.\nMR. FREDERICK: And the reason, Justice\nGinsburg, is that that law imposes structural changes on\nvessels that go to other ports.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why don't you -- why don't you\ntry to draw that line? Why don't you say that just as the\napplicability or not may depend upon whether you're\ndealing with a crew of a foreign ship or whether you're\ndealing with an American who happens to be injured on\nboard that ship, so also it may depend upon whether the\nanti-discrimination law in question is one that at least\nin some of its applications requires structural changes or\nnot? That would enable you to say the ADA doesn't apply,\nbut would not compel you to say that title II doesn't\napply.\nMR. FREDERICK: We are talking --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're not willing to take such\na limited position.\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, Justice Scalia, I think\nthe Court could certainly carve out in its clear --\narticulation of the clear statement principle some of\nthese lines. It becomes very --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, the ADA itself makes an\nexception for things that aren't readily achievable. I\nmean, you could certainly lean on that because a\nstructural change probably isn't readily achievable.\nMR. FREDERICK: Justice O'Connor, Congress, when\nit talked about readily achievable, did so in terms of\ncost. It didn't do so in terms of conflict with the laws\nof other nations or --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is there -- is there -- I mean,\nyou're giving me the answer I thought the other side\nwould give me. All right? And I appreciate it actually.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: You say that two-thirds of\nthese people, the customers, are American. So we're\ndealing with a business that is primarily American, not a\nbusiness like the Swiss ship except with the exceptional\ncases. Then you say, all right, still it's a problem\nbecause of structural changes we'll have to make. What\nchanges? That is to say, I would have thought I could\nhave read, but I haven't, that other countries like Europe\nalso have discrimination laws against disabled people, and\ntherefore, given that fact and given the document that Mr.\nGoldstein produced, it is highly unlikely that your\nclients will have to make any significant structural\nchange that they wouldn't have had to make anyway.\nMR. FREDERICK: That's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, what's the response to\nthat?\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, that's completely false.\nIn -- in the year 2000, the United States Government\nissued a report that contained an extensive appendix,\nwhich we've cited in our brief, that details in laborious\ndetail the conflicts between land-based ADA standards and\nSOLAS.\nNow, I can give you some specifics, if you would\n-- that are fairly practical, such as the ADA requires\nunder the interpretation advanced by the petitioners that\nthere be a disabled access cabin on every level of the\nship, but SOLAS requires that passengers with disabilities\nbe placed near evacuation points.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Why -- why can't you just\nfight that battle by battle on what's reasonably\nachievable? Because in order to avoid that problem, what\nyou're telling us is that a cruise line can charge a -- a\ndisabled person double the price --\nMR. FREDERICK: As a matter of fact --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- because they're a nuisance.\nAnd that's your position.\nMR. FREDERICK: Justice Kennedy, as a matter of\nfact, we categorically deny the claims of discrimination\nhere. We're having to fight this on the basis of assuming\nthe -- the allegations are true, but they are\ncategorically false. And --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it doesn't matter what\nyou want to do as a matter of good will. The question is\nwhat the law requires you to do, and you're saying it's up\nto us, we govern. You're not governed by U.S. anti-\ndiscrimination law.\nMR. FREDERICK: Justice Ginsburg, what the other\nside wants is a case-by-case method of decision-making in\nwhich a district judge becomes the special master of the\ncruise industry so that each claim of discrimination that\nwould require some modification to the ship --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That happens to every employer\nunder -- in the United States under the reasonably\nachievable standard.\nMR. FREDERICK: And that's why, Justice Kennedy,\nit's a question of congressional intent. The very same\nCongress debated extensively about whether to impose\ndesign requirements on foreign ships in the Oil Pollution\nAct of 1990, and it decided to buck the international\nsystem knowingly by imposing a design requirement that\ndouble hulls be imposed on oil tankers, foreign oil\ntankers.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Frederick, that brings up\na question I've been meaning to ask you. To what extent\nwas this whole problem of the application of this statute\nto the foreign vessels discussed in the legislative\nhistory of these statutes?\nMR. FREDERICK: Zero. There is not one word\nabout vessel --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. If -- if that's so\nand if you look at the earlier cases -- but all I could\nget out it is that those earlier cases -- the Court tries\nto do what it really would have thought Congress would\nhave intended in the circumstances. And if that's so, why\nwouldn't Congress really have intended that a business\nthat's two-thirds American has to abide by American law?\nMR. FREDERICK: Because it was encroaching on an\narea of foreign sovereignty. Foreign ships are governed\nby foreign laws.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Does -- does Britain -- or does\nBritain or does the European Union, for example, forbid\nyou to charge this double price?\nMR. FREDERICK: I don't --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Does European law -- I'd be\nsurprised if it doesn't forbid it, but do you know?\nMR. FREDERICK: I -- I don't know the answer to\nEuropean law on charging of an additional price, but I\nwould point out that pricing, like evacuation procedures,\ndo go to the structure of the vessel. And we're talking\nhere fundamentally in the ADA about structural changes\nthat they want to impose that go -- when ships travel,\nthey can't dismantle those structural changes when they\nleave U.S. waters.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. -- may I ask this question\nto you? What about a -- an American-flagged ship? Does\nthe statute apply or not?\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, the Fifth Circuit reserved\nthat question.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What is your view?\nMR. FREDERICK: Our view is that there are\narguments that can be made that it does not because\nCongress didn't --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What is your view? Not what\narguments can be made. What is your view?\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, I think --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FREDERICK: No. I think our view is that it\ndoesn't.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It does not apply.\nMR. FREDERICK: It does not apply because\nCongress didn't express the intent.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So really, we're not concerned\nwith the fact this is a foreign-flagged ship. You're\nconcerned with the fact it's a ship.\nMR. FREDERICK: The -- there's a difference and\n-- and there are about 1,000 U.S.-flagged ships that carry\npassengers, so that if Congress had given any thought to\nthe question, it is reasonable to suppose it might have\ndistinguished between U.S. ships for which U.S. law\ndirectly governs and foreign ships that are governed by a\ndifferent law. The fact --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do we need -- do we need a\nclear statement for United States ships? I thought your\ncase rested on a clear statement requirement. Is there\nany clear statement requirement for U.S. ships?\nMR. FREDERICK: No, no, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So why -- why isn't there a\nclear difference between the two?\nMR. FREDERICK: Because there aren't any words\nin the statute that go to ships. The best they can do is\na catchall phrase at the end of bus, rail, and any other\nmeans of conveyance.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's pretty good, isn't\nit?\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, it's not --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If you don't require a clear\nstatement, that's -- that's good enough, it seems to me.\nMR. FREDERICK: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Your -- your case hangs on the\nfact that, you know, when Congress wants to -- to rule the\nworld and say all ships in the -- in the world that touch\nat our ports have to have this kind of a thing, it says so\nclearly. It doesn't have to say so with perfect clarity\nwith respect to American ships.\nMR. FREDERICK: With respect to foreign ships,\nthere is a clear statement rule and that clear statement\nrule is embodied in the fact that a foreign ship is\ngoverned by the law of the flag state where it is\nregistered. That's been the rule for 200 years.\nAnd the other side's position --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, is that limited,\nthough, just to things that affect the internal order of\nthe ship? Is that the context in which we've articulated\nthat rule?\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, it's been articulated in\nseveral different contexts. In the Brown v. Duchesne\ncase, the Court 150 years ago articulated in a patent case\nwhere the Court said that a patented device on the ship,\nwhich was the French ship in Boston Harbor infringing an\nAmerican patent-holder, would not apply U.S. patent law.\nAnd the Court said, because we can't conceive that\nCongress would have imagined this general language to\nencroach on the sovereignty of a foreign ship.\nNow, the other side has exactly two sentences to\nsay about that case, but that is the case that is directly\non point because that case says that when you are dealing\nwith American laws that are generally written, you would\nnot ordinarily apply them to a foreign ship unless\nCongress said so specifically.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But -- but in that case, there\nwas -- as I understand it, there was no legal relationship\nof any sort between the supplier of the patent-infringing\nobject and the ship in the United States. So it at least\nmade sense to classify that with internal order as opposed\nto external relationships arguably involving -- or\nimplicating American law. You've got exactly the opposite\nsituation here. You've got contracts made in the United\nStates with the foreign cruise line. You didn't have that\nin your patent case.\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, Justice Souter, you have a\nforeign ship owned by a foreign corporation built in a\nforeign country under foreign engineering standards --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: With its principal place of\nbusiness in the United States.\nMR. FREDERICK: For a time before that ship\nmoves into another market.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But its significant external --\nits significant commercial relationships are in the United\nStates with people in the United States performed\npartially in the United States.\nMR. FREDERICK: In just the same way that\nMcCulloch the Court said that labor standards for a course\nof business that is regular between Honduras and the\nUnited States is not going to be sufficient to apply --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The crew members were\nHonduran in that case.\nMR. FREDERICK: They were.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: This -- if you just look at\nit, suppose you were not a lawyer and you look at this\noperation. You'd say that's got USA written all over it.\nThe passengers are from the USA. The company is centered\nin Florida. And then you have this flag of convenience\nthat it flies which can legitimately govern the\nrelationship with its crew. But to say that it governs\nthe relationship with passengers, it seems to me very\nstrange.\nAnd also the ticket says, passenger, if you're\ngoing to sue us, it's got to be in the United States and\nunder U.S. law to boot.\nMR. FREDERICK: But a choice-of-law clause,\nJustice Ginsburg, has never been held to incorporate law\nin the sense that laws that don't apply are going to be\nincorporated. I'm not aware of any choice-of-law clause\nthat -- that simply takes in every domestic statute.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Just -- it's just one other\nindicia that one looks at this operation and says this\nbelongs to the USA. A practical judgment, I think, would\ncome down there.\nMR. FREDERICK: And -- and you would have --\nunder their theory, you would have the Consumer Products\nSafety Act, the Food and Drug Act, OSHA, all sorts of\nother statutes of general application that are now going\nto be imposed on foreign vessels simply because they do a\nlot of business in the United States.\nThe problem here, as a matter of congressional\nintent, is we don't know what Congress thought about this,\nand because Congress --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, we -- we do -- we do\nhave the rule if it -- if it applies to the internal\noperations of the ship, and so far as the crew is\nconcerned, the Jones Act and OSHA, it seems to me, may\nwell be governed by the law of the flag.\nMR. FREDERICK: And the internal operations of\nthe ship, Justice Kennedy, is part and parcel of how it is\ndesigned, what are the evacuation points, how are the\ncabins laid out, what ramps are placed where, how --\neverything about the ship's design --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That's a part of the case I'm\nnot sure about, and it seems to me, again, it can be\nfought out under the reasonably achievable --\nMR. FREDERICK: It doesn't -- Justice Kennedy,\nthe problem with that theory is it just doesn't comport\nwith the language of -- of the statute. Congress didn't\nthink in terms of -- as it did in the Oil Pollution Act,\nit said, if there's a conflict with international law,\nwork it out. Get the Coast Guard with the foreign nations\nand work out the conflict. It didn't put anything like\nthat in this statute, which is a further indication that\nif Congress wants to extend this kind of disability\nprotection, it can do that, but it ought to do so\nwillingly.\nAnd the Government has had 13 years to come up\nwith rules that would govern cruise ships, and the best\nthey've done, a few days before the top-side briefs in\nthis case were filed, is to issue proposed draft\nguidelines for ferries, not cruise ships. Most of the\nregulations that they are pointing to wouldn't have an\napplication to a large passenger cruise ship. If Congress\nwants to change this, it certainly has the power, but this\nCourt need not open up a Pandora's box of domestic\nlegislation to apply to foreign ships where Congress has\nnot expressed the intent to do that.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Could you go back to Justice\nBreyer's question about the number of foreign ships? Once\nwe get beyond cruise lines, does it -- would -- would the\n-- the application on your view cover the -- the dozen\npassengers who decide they want to take a trip on a -- on\na cargo boat?\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes. I don't perceive a\nlimiting principle to the other side's position. In fact,\nthere's an amicus brief written where there's only one or\ntwo stops in the United States a year, and under their\nview, that ship would be governed by the ADA as well.\nIf -- if Congress wants to enact these limits,\nit's certainly free to do so, but this is a highly complex\narea and ships are different from land-based\naccommodations because you have to be able to evacuate\npeople within 30 minutes. And so when we train people, we\nhave --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But doesn't it -- on the other\n-- on the other side of the coin, apart from the\nstructural problem -- and I understand the arguments on\nboth sides there. With respect to things like safety\ndrills and access to gambling tables and all that, it\nseems to me that your answer to that would be, well, we'll\njust do that once we're on the high seas so there's no\nconflict with the statute when we're out there.\nMR. FREDERICK: As a matter of fact, Justice\nStevens, we give evacuation drills to the disabled in a\ndifferent way. We have special access and assistance\nsquads that go to persons with physical challenges to get\nthem off the vessel in an event of a -- a need for\nevacuation. That's a different procedure than most\npassengers, but it's -- it is one that is in place.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Frederick.\nMr. Garre.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE\nON BEHALF OF THE BAHAMAS,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT\nMR. GARRE: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may\nit please the Court:\nApplying title III of the Americans With\nDisabilities Act to foreign-flagged vessels would invite\nprecisely the sort of international discord, conflict, and\nconfusion that Congress presumably seeks to avoid when it\nwrites American laws.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you agree with Mr.\nFrederick's answer about title II of the Civil Rights Act\nof 1964? I mean, a lot of countries don't prohibit\ndiscrimination.\nMR. GARRE: Justice Ginsburg, first let me make\nclear that the Bahamian Government does and all of its\ncruise vessels are governed by that prohibition.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm asking about the\napplication of U.S. law.\nMR. GARRE: We think that that question can be\nresolved along the lines that Justice Scalia suggested,\nwhich is that when you're dealing with a matter that goes\nto the internal affairs of the ship -- and there -- we\nwould suggest that there is more central to the internal\naffairs of the ship than its construction and design.\nUnder international law, article 94 of the Law of -- Law\nof the Sea Convention, which the Bahamian Government has\nratified -- and by the way, the United States has not, and\nthat's an important principle for this Court to keep in\nmind -- foreign-flagged states may be bound by different\ninternational treaties than the United States. So simply\ntrying to draw some conflict resolution device that would\ndeal with treaties that the United States has entered\ninto, international nations have not will not address that\nproblem.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So before you go on to that,\nI want to be clear on your answer to title II of the Civil\nRights Act of '64. There's -- you say, well, that's\neasier to comply with. But that's not the principle under\nwhich you're operating.\nMR. GARRE: No. With respect, Justice Ginsburg,\nour principle is that when it comes to the matters that\nunder international law have been traditionally governed\nby the flag state, then when Congress writes its laws, we\npresume that unless Congress clearly indicates an\naffirmative intention to address those matters, it did not\nintend to. When Congress wrote the ADA, not a word of the\nstatute indicates that it considered the international\nrepercussions of applying that law to foreign-flagged\nvessels. Not a word --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What about the -- what about\nthe full sweep argument? Let's sort of come full circle\non that. You -- you say the full sweep argument is no\ngood because the same thing could have been made in\nMcCulloch. The response was there is a textual difference --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What's -- what's the full sweep\nargument? I don't --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Full sweep of the commerce\npower.\nMR. GARRE: Justice Souter, first of all, it's\n-- it -- the statute doesn't say full sweep. It says\nsweep, and that's in the findings of the ADA. It's\nreprinted on page 32 of petitioners' brief.\nAnd second of all, the definition of Congress,\nwhich doesn't contain that sweep language, is almost\nidentical to the definition of commerce in McCulloch,\nwhich is on page 15, note 3 of that decision, and that\ndefinition, the United States argued in the McCulloch\ncase, was not sufficient to extend U.S. labor laws to\nforeign-flagged vessels.\nIt's important to understand the -- the\npotential international conflicts that extending the ADA\nto foreign-flagged vessels could create. There are more\nthan 40 nations that have adopted anti-discrimination laws\nfor the disabled. Three nations have -- have adopted laws\nfor domestic vessels: Britain, Canada, and Australia. If\na country like the United States extended its laws to\nforeign vessels that entered its ports, then other nations\nmay well follow suit.\nAnd if you take a simple hypothetical example,\nthe Queen Mary II traveling from South Hampton to New\nYork, if you look at the guidelines that Britain has\nadopted for domestic vessels, those guidelines contain\ndifferent structural and design requirements than the\ndraft guidelines that the United States have promulgated.\nThere are different requirements for door widths. There\nare different requirements for sloping. There's different\nrequirements for the watertight compartments. There are\ndifferent requirements about whether vessels have to be --\nhave accessible cabins all throughout the ship.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: When you say different, you\nmean you cannot comply with both.\nMR. GARRE: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is that what you mean? Or --\nor are those just minimums and -- and the United States\nwould -- would comply with those minimums?\nMR. GARRE: Justice Scalia, I think in some you\ncould and in others you couldn't. And -- and that's an\nimportant -- important point.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And incidentally just for the\n-- are -- this ship has -- these are regulations that help\nthe disabled?\nMR. GARRE: Yes, Your -- yes, Your Honor. And\n-- and in many cases, it's not going to be clear which\nregulation is going to be more accommodating to the\ndisabled and which is not.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Could they work that out? That\nis, if two-thirds of our universe really is American-\nbased, in terms of customers, and we're now only talking\nabout conflicts in -- real conflicts that -- that affect,\nsay, one-third of the universe, that's also true in areas\nlike antitrust or others where the enforcement authorities\nget together and they try to write memoranda that -- that\nwork this out in a reasonable way. Could -- could the\nsame thing happen here if such real conflicts did emerge?\nMR. GARRE: We don't think so, Justice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because?\nMR. GARRE: We would take the same approach that\nthis Court emphasized in -- in the McCulloch case, which\nis that kind of ad hoc balancing analysis would wreak\nhavoc for the question whether a significant regulation\nlike the ADA would apply to a vessel. How would foreign\nvessels know, when they enter U.S. ports, whether they\nhave to undertake the extraordinary changes --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The answer would be yes, you\ndo. You do have to, and then if there's some other\nauthority that wants to get involved in this, the two\nauthorities would work it out.\nMR. GARRE: Justice Breyer, the way that those\nissues are worked out in the international shipping\ncontext is through the International Maritime\nOrganization. This organization has been responsible for\ncrafting scores of conventions, hundreds of shipping\ncodes, and it's already begun to address the issue of\naccessibility on ships for the disabled and the elderly.\nWe cite the 1996 guidelines in our brief. Those\nguidelines right now are -- are not binding guidelines,\nbut they could well become binding guidelines. And when\nan organization like the IMO addresses this question, it\nresolves --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's perfect because then the\nGovernment says that once it becomes a matter of binding\ninternational rule, anything that conflicts with that will\nbe viewed as not reasonably achievable. So all you have\nto do is that and then there's no longer a problem with\nAmerican law, according to them.\nMR. GARRE: Well, we don't think the readily\nachievable language in the first case in any way\ncontemplates conflicts with international law. This Court\nhas a separate canon that's almost as old as the country\nthat it presumes Congress doesn't intend to interfere with\ninternational obligations or international laws, including\ncustomary international law, as you wrote for the Court\nlast term in -- in the Empagran case. We presume that\nAmerican legislatures give respect to the interests of\nsovereign nations when they write their laws, and we don't\nassume that Congress intends to intrude on the sovereign\ninterests of other nations. And that's what extending the\nADA to foreign-flagged ships would do.\nThe Bahamian Government has a solemn\nresponsibility under international law and under its own\nlaw to govern the construction and design of all flags of\nall ships that fly -- fly its flags. Article 10 of the\nGeneva Convention on the High Seas recognizes that flag\nstates have responsibility for the construction and design\nof ships. Article 94 of the Law of the Sea Conventions\nspecifies that flag states have responsibility over\nadministrative, technical, and labor matters, including\nconstruction and design matters. These are precisely the\nsorts of matters that for centuries the flag state has\nbeen responsible for. And in the Brown v. Duchesne case,\nthis Court recognized that, a case that dealt with the\napplication of patent laws to the construction and design\nof a foreign-flagged vessels.\nThere are going to be conflicts within --\nbetween international law and the requirements of the ADA,\nbut first of all, there's going to be confusion. It's\nbeen more than a decade since the ADA was passed, and we\ndon't even have final regulations as to what rules apply.\nAnd in the meantime, foreign-flagged vessels are going to\nhave to be reviewing the case law in the United States\ncourts, determining on a vessel-by-vessel, design\nspecification-by-design specification as to what standards\napply. That's only going to create additional\ninternational discord and confusion.\nPetitioners proposed solution to this problem we\nthink is telling. They urge this Court in their reply\nbrief if there is a problem after the ADA is extended to\nforeign-flagged ships and other nations begin to follow\nsuit and you have a crazy made -- maze of different\nregulations applying to construction and design, then at\nthat point, the United States can go to the IMO and ask it\nto clean up the mess.\nWith respect, we think they have it backwards.\nThe purpose of the IMO and the international framework\nthat exists for governing regulation of shipping is to\nestablish a uniform set of rules in the first instance.\nThe IMO has already begun to address the problem at issue\nin this case, accessibility for the disabled. They are\navailable to address that in a multilateral fashion.\nAnd Congress, in enacting the ADA, gave no\nindication that it weighed any of the international\nrepercussions of the action that petitioners urges the\ncase -- petitioners urge the Court to take in this case.\nAnd we would urge this Court to return this matter to\nCongress. Congress is in the position to weigh the risk\nof international confusion, to weigh the potential for\ninternational discord and to address those matters as it\nsees -- sees fit.\nIf there are no further questions.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Garre.\nMr. Goldstein, you have about 40 seconds.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Breyer and Justice\nGinsburg, our position is the one that can accommodate\nyour concerns. Theirs cannot. Just like in Empagran,\nwhere this Court built in comity considerations, relying\non cases like Lauritzen that involved foreign-flagged\nships, it said, look, even if the text of the Sherman Act\nor the FTAIA could literally reach it, in these cases that\nwe don't think Congress could have conceived of, we're not\ngoing to apply the statute.\nBut here, we have a situation in which this\ncompany has 95 percent of its cruises going in and out\nfrom the United States. Millions of people, and billions\nof dollars in commerce are affected by this statute and\nAmericans that Congress had to have in mind.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Goldstein.\n"
