CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument

Mr. Jones.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CRAIG T. JONES
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. JONES: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and
may it please the Court:
Under United States v. Lanier, the law was
clearly established for purposes of qualified immunity
when it gives officials fair warning that their conduct is
unlawful. The fair warning standard is met when a rule
laid out by prior law applies with obvious clarity to the
conduct in question, even if the rule arises from a case
involving different facts.
The materially similar facts requirement of the
Eleventh Circuit is an unwarranted gloss upon the fair
warning standard, just like the fundamentally similar
facts requirement which this Court unanimously rejected in
Lanier. It is an impermissible gloss because it
emphasizes similarity of fact over clarity of ruling.
QUESTION: And what should be the rule that you
say was violated here? If we write out the opinion, we'd
say the rule that the officer should have known is, and we
have to fill in the blank. What is that rule?
MR. JONES: The rule established by the Eleventh
Circuit's own precedent is that it is unconstitutional to
punish an inmate through the use of restraint, and
restraint is punitive if it goes beyond the point in time
which is necessary to quell a disturbance or immediate
threat.
QUESTION: Does the include solitary
confinement?
MR. JONES: No, Your Honor. Restraint involves
total physical immobility coupled with the pain and
discomfort attendant to that.
QUESTION: And what case establishes that
proposition?
MR. JONES: Well, there is a --
QUESTION: Any physical restraint is unlawful.
What case establishes that?
MR. JONES: Physical restraint, the precedents
speak of physical restraint to a fixed object.
QUESTION: Yes, and what precedent in
particular?
MR. JONES: Gates v. Collier is the first case
of a body of law which has developed in our circuit,
Justice Scalia. Gates v. Collier was a 1974 Fifth Circuit
decision which was binding upon the present Eleventh
Circuit and it held that a variety of forms of corporal
punishment --
QUESTION: That's my problem. It was a whole
variety. They didn't say that any single one. I mean, as
I recall that case, there are a number of instances of
brutality against prisoners, and the holding of that case
was that that was cruel and unusual punishment, but I
don't recall that case saying that any single one of the
many instances that the case recited, one of which was
physical restraint, would qualify.
MR. JONES: Your Honor, the Fifth Circuit
decision in Gates affirmed a district court decision which
specifically enjoined each and every one of those
punishments, and the fact that --
QUESTION: And you think that amounts to a
holding that any single one of them would have violated
the Eighth Amendment?
MR. JONES: Yes, Your Honor, if used punitively,
that is correct, and --
QUESTION: But the court ordered stopping each
and every one of those measures. Wasn't that the nature
of the injunctive degree, not just a combination of them,
but each one?
MR. JONES: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. This was not
a case where the court viewed the totality of the
circumstances and said that the conditions constituted
cruel and usual punishment and ordered the State of
Mississippi to build a new prison. This was a case where
the State was specifically enjoined --
QUESTION: Did the reasoning follow that line?
MR. JONES: Well --
QUESTION: Was the reasoning of the opinion, did
it examine each one individually and say each one
individually was cruel and unusual?
MR. JONES: It examined a variety of practices,
and those practices were discussed in a subsection called
corporal punishment. The fact that Gates involved
multiple holdings does not make it any less important in
clearly establishing the law, otherwise a case could only
clearly establish the law if it had a single holding. The
fact that Gates v. Collier drew multiple bright lines as
opposed to a single bright line did not make --
QUESTION: Do we need --
MR. JONES: Yes.
QUESTION: In this case, do we need to get into
the issue, Mr. Jones of what this Court's holdings amount
to on this subject, or are we just limiting ourselves to
the Eleventh Circuit, perhaps the old Fifth Circuit?
MR. JONES: With respect to the underlying
constitutional violation, or with respect to qualified
immunity analysis?
QUESTION: With respect to each.
MR. JONES: Well, Your Honor, this Court has
never squarely addressed the constitutionality of
continued restraint as a form of corporal punishment. It
has acknowledged in decisions that restraints can be
harmful.
QUESTION: I suppose one would have to do that,
yes.
MR. JONES: Yes, that's correct.
QUESTION: Are you relying on anything beyond
the restraint itself? I mean, in the facts that have been
recited, the facts include leaving the individual in the
sun without a shirt on, and not giving him bathroom
breaks, and pouring water out in front of him to taunt
him. Are you relying upon those features?
MR. JONES: Not as -- not for the proposition
that the law was clearly established, with regard to those
facts. Those facts are certainly relevant on the issue of
the damages suffered by the
QUESTION: Well, do we have to assume that the
facts as alleged are true for purposes of deciding whether
summary judgment is appropriate?
MR. JONES: Based -- Justice O'Connor, based
upon the grant of certiorari by the Court, the issues
raised in the petition, and the grant, I think that is
correct.
QUESTION: I would assume we -- I gather we just
assume those are correct for purposes of evaluating the
summary judgment question.
MR. JONES: I think that is correct.
QUESTION: And the Eleventh Circuit decided
there was a constitutional violation?
MR. JONES: Yes, Your Honor.
QUESTION: And there was no cross-appeal on
that.
MR. JONES: That is correct, Your Honor.
QUESTION: So do we take that as a given, too?
MR. JONES: I think that this case is like
Saucier, where the Court acknowledged that the first step
be the inquiry of whether there was a constitutional
violation made out by the facts. That was resolved by the
circuit court.
QUESTION: Well, that gets back to the Chief
Justice's question, and I'm wondering again if the Court
writes the opinion giving you the judgment that you seek,
isn't it necessary for us to say, a) this law was clearly
established, and b) it is a correct interpretation, a
correct exposition of the Cruel and Unusual Punishment
Clause, so we are -- it would be a rather odd holding for
us to say, well, this was established in the Eleventh
Circuit, but we're not telling you whether or not that was
right.
MR. JONES: Well, I think, Justice Kennedy,
because the certiorari was only granted on the second part
of the Saucier test, that is, on the clearly established
inquiry, the Court could limit its ruling to the issue of
whether the law was clearly established and whether,
specifically whether the Eleventh Circuit applied the
proper standards in determining whether --
QUESTION: Well, maybe Justice Kennedy is
suggesting that it's fairly included within the question
granted, that it's quite impossible for a judge to say
that it does or does not violate a clearly established
constitutional principle if he doesn't think that it
violates a constitutional principle at all, clearly
established or otherwise. I mean, isn't -- doesn't -- the
one sort of wrapped up in the other?
MR. JONES: Yes, Your Honor, and I think that it
is fairly included. My point is that --
QUESTION: I take it your position, though, is
that all we have to decide is whether the substantially
similar standard is the proper standard, and if we say no,
it's not, that's like Lanier, which was -- what was it? --
substantially identical, I guess, wasn't it, something
like that?
MR. JONES: The verdict was fundamentally
similar --
QUESTION: Fundamentally, yes.
MR. JONES: --in Lanier.
QUESTION: And if we say that that gloss, the
substantially similar gloss was wrong, what you want us to
do is simply vacate and send the thing back, or do you
want us to go further and say, no, in fact, there -- we
determined that there can be no sovereign -- that there
can be no qualified immunity here, because if we have to
go the second step, then we have to get into the issue, it
seems to me, that Justice Kennedy has raised.
MR. JONES: Your Honor, I believe that the
first -- the issue of whether there's a constitutional
violation is fairly included within the questions which
were granted by the Court.
QUESTION: All right. Now, if that's what we're
going to get into, so we will determine what the violation
was and then get to immunity with respect to that
particular violation, we won't confine ourselves simply to
the substantially similar verbiage, then I go back to my
earlier question, and I take it -- and I think you've
answered it, but I want to make sure I understand you --
for purposes of determining whether there's a
constitutional violation, you are not arguing, I take it,
that we should take into consideration the particular
circumstances of the day, the heat, the shirt, the
bathroom breaks, the water, is that correct? All we look
at is the restraint itself?
MR. JONES: Yes, Your Honor, because the conduct
of these defendants was to restrain this man as a form of
punishment.
QUESTION: And some of the allegations of the
facts have been questioned, and one point was about the
lack of bathroom breaks. There's nothing in the
pleadings -- the pleadings didn't allege lack of bathroom
breaks, and how does that get into the cases if the other
circuits didn't mention that either?
MR. JONES: Well, I think it got into the case
because the respondents wanted to argue the case rather
than the law.
QUESTION: But that had not been found below,
and it hadn't been even asserted in the complaint, is that
correct?
MR. JONES: Yes, that is correct, except to the
extent that the affidavit of the plaintiff was referenced,
I think incorporated by reference into the pleadings.
QUESTION: And the plaintiffs affidavit said
that specifically, that he wasn't allowed bathroom breaks?
MR. JONES: The plaintiff's affidavit is that he
was left on the hitching post for 7 hours, and the fair
inference that can be drawn from that is that he was
restrained for 7 hours without breaks, and there's
certainly no evidence rebutting that with respect to the
second incident, which he was on the hitching post.
The first incident he was on the hitching post,
there is evidence that he was given one bathroom break,
and he was taken down that incident only after 2 hours,
which in itself is --
QUESTION: That, we got into that. That is, I
think, disputed even as to the first instance because I
think that the State said he had been offered other breaks
but he had declined them. Well, that's one thing, and
another argument that was made about the background, if
we're going to get anything beyond the hitching, that the
particular officers' names were not involved in some of
the worst aspects of that.
That is, the officers that are named defendants
here didn't tell Hope to take off his shirt, and didn't
pour water in front of him and have the dogs drink it.
Those were other people who are not named defendants, and
you don't contest that, do you?
MR. JONES: I do not contest that reading of the
record, Justice Ginsburg.
QUESTION: They didn't keep him on there for
7 hours, as far as we know. Do we know that they were in
charge of how long he would stay there?
MR. JONES: We do not know that, Your Honor,
although we do know that it was their expectation that he
be restrained indefinitely. Findings in other cases
indicate that -- including the published case of Austin v.
Hopper, indicate that inmates were routinely left on the
hitching post for the remainder of the day.
QUESTION: You say indefinitely. According to
the prison policy, they were kept on until they agreed to
go back to the work crew without disrupting it, so that he
could have been released at any time that he said I'm
ready to go back on the work crew and do the work, right?
MR. JONES: Justice --
QUESTION: That's what the prison policy says,
anyway.
MR. JONES: Well --
QUESTION: Now, is the contention in this case
that he was prepared to -- you see, I don't understand
what they could have done. Here is a prison that has a
policy of having work crews. You don't contend that
that's cruel and unusual punishment, right?
MR. JONES: That is correct.
QUESTION: And the allegation is that this
prisoner refused to work in one case, and disrupted a work
crew in another case, and according to the prison
policy -- I mean, you have to do something when he does
that. To take him back and say, oh, you know, you've got
to go back to prison, he says yes, that's exactly what I
want. What was the prison supposed to do?
MR. JONES: Well, Justice Scalia, in both
instances he was being punished for fighting. He was
being punished for --
QUESTION: Disrupting the work crew.
MR. JONES: For an altercation.
QUESTION: Okay.
MR. JONES: An altercation which subsided at the
work site, which was miles away from the prison property,
and after he -- in each instant after he was restrained
and subdued, and whatever disruption he was a part of had
abated, he was put into a van for 20 minutes without
incident, another 20 minutes were spent transporting him
to the facility without incident, he was then walked
without incident, without the necessity for the use of
force, to the post.
QUESTION: And the work rules were not brought
up by the State. The Eleventh Circuit said specifically,
we are not going to consider these work rules because they
were never put in the district court record as a reason
for the officer's behavior in question.
MR. JONES: That is correct, Justice Ginsburg,
and if they were in the record, the evidence would also be
they were not followed, which was also consistent with the
finding of the Middle District of Alabama in the case of
Austin v. Hopper.
QUESTION: Quickly, what are we supposed to take
as the fact? Do we take the fact in the second affidavit
of Larry Hope?
MR. JONES: Yes.
QUESTION: Okay. There's nothing about bathroom
breaks in that.
MR. JONES: That is correct, but the critical
time element here is the time it took them between the
time that the disruption had abated and the time that they
decided to punish him for past conduct which had occurred
an hour earlier and 10 miles away. That is the critical
time element, not the amount of time --
QUESTION: You say it's critical. Why is that
critical? I mean, must they decide to punish him
instantaneously or never?
MR. JONES: It's critical, Your Honor, because
restraint is not a proper form of punishment under those
circumstances. They can suspend privileges, they can take
away TV --
QUESTION: You say no kind of restraint is
permissible?
MR. JONES: Not as a form of punishment. If
they need to restrain him to maintain order and discipline
at the scene of exigent circumstances, that's perfectly
proper.
QUESTION: Or to make him go back to work. You
say that that issue is not in this case. You say that
there's not in this case the fact, contended by the State,
that the only reason he was restrained was to get him to
agree to go back to the work crew, and that as soon as he
said okay, I'll go back and I won't disrupt it any more,
he would have been released. You say that's not in the
case.
MR. JONES: Yes, Your Honor, because if you
fight with five prison guards, you're not going to be able
to escape punishment simply by --
QUESTION: So we should leave open -- even if we
decide in your favor, you want us to leave open the
question of whether this prison could follow the policy
that it has in effect, namely, only restraining people
this way as a means of inducing them to go back to the
work crew. That would be left open.
MR. JONES: Yes, Your Honor. We're not
attacking the policy. We're attacking the conduct which
was used in this case in violation of clearly established
law.
Thank you.
QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Jones.
Mr. Schlick, we'll hear from you.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF AUSTIN C. SCHLICK
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
MR. SCHLICK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
An official is immune from personal liability
for violating Federal rights unless the violation would
have been clear to a reasonable officer. Where, as here,
the governing legal standard does not itself establish a
violation, the practical inquiry would be whether the
violation was established by case law is not
distinguishable in a fair way.
QUESTION: What, in your view, is the governing
legal standard that you just referred to?
MR. SCHLICK: The overarching standard would be
the Harlow v. Fitzgerald, where the law was clearly
established. The --
QUESTION: Well, I thought -- you're not
talking, then, about a substantive standard?
MR. SCHLICK: In that, in the particular context
where one looks to case law, this Court's decision in
Saucier v. Katz uses the formulation whether the facts
were distinguishable in a fair way, and that would be an
appropriate gloss as well. Now --
QUESTION: I mean, we start with a prohibition
for substantive law, the prohibition against cruel and
unusual punishment. Then how do we work ourselves down
from there, or up from there, whatever you want to call
it?
MR. SCHLICK: Yes, Your Honor. We would urge
the Court in this case to take the case on the terms on
which it was briefed and decided in the Eleventh Circuit,
that is whether the law they applied in the Eleventh
Circuit in 1995 clearly established the violation. In
that context --
QUESTION: Then we don't get into the question
of our own view whether -- what the law might, or the
result might be in this case?
MR. SCHLICK: Even under that approach, the
first step would be to ask whether this Court's decisions
themselves gave clear notice, and the answer to that in
our view would be no. It's only because of the Gates v.
Collier decision that these officers had fair warning, had
clear notice.
QUESTION: So then the result could be one thing
in the Eleventh Circuit and another thing in the Fourth
Circuit?
MR. SCHLICK: Yes, the -- it could be. This
Court hasn't definitively decided whether, when it takes a
qualified immunity case, it should analyze the case in
light of its own law solely, or whether it should give
greater weight to the relevant circuits. In this case, we
think it would give most guidance to the lower courts to
analyze the case as the Eleventh Circuit did.
QUESTION: But what is the standard that the
officers should have been aware of, first in the Eleventh
Circuit, and then, assuming that we think we -- that this
case presents either the necessity or the proper
opportunity for us to say what the national standard ought
to be, what is the standard at a more specific level of
abstraction than Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause that
we should be dealing with?
MR. SCHLICK: Justice Kennedy, let me address
the Eleventh Circuit first. In the Eleventh Circuit, the
reasonable officer would have looked to the Gates v.
Collier decision, noted that it held that it violates the
Eighth Amendment to punish an inmate by handcuffing the
inmate to a fence for a prolonged period of time, or cell
bars for a prolonged period of time, or forcing him to
maintain an awkward position for a prolonged period of
time. The reasonable officer --
QUESTION: Even if -- do you maintain that the
issue of whether it was done only to get him to return to
the work crew is not in the case?
MR. SCHLICK: Yes.
QUESTION: We have to assume that he was just
put on there to punish him, and he couldn't have been
released if he had said I'm ready to go back to the work
crew?
MR. SCHLICK: Yes, Justice Scalia. The Eleventh
Circuit we think correctly explained that's not a fair
inference from the record as we must take it.
In the Eleventh Circuit, the reasonable officer
would -- could not have concluded that there is a
constitutional difference between handcuffing an inmate to
a fence or a cell bar and handcuffing an inmate to a metal
pole. Accordingly --
QUESTION: For purposes of punishment?
MR. SCHLICK: For purposes of punishment.
QUESTION: You have to add that.
MR. SCHLICK: Yes, Your Honor.
QUESTION: And you're content to have us hold
these officers liable when a few years down the line we
may find that the Eleventh Circuit's opinion was wrong?
MR. SCHLICK: Your Honor, we don't suggest a
view one way or the other on liability. We're simply
suggesting that to grant qualified immunity at this stage
of the case was improper. That brings me, though, to the
second question --
QUESTION: Well, I understand, but I mean, they
would be stripped of their qualified immunity even though
the Eleventh Circuit's opinion was wrong, and we find it
to have been wrong when we finally confront that issue.
MR. SCHLICK: I think that suggests Justice
Kennedy's second question, which was, absent Gates, how
would the case be viewed, and in that situation --
QUESTION: And don't you think we have to reach
that?
MR. SCHLICK: No. No, we don't think so, Your
Honor, because it wasn't included in the petition or in
the questions on which this Court granted certiorari, and
really it hasn't been squarely faced by the parties,
because the State is defending the Regulation 429 rather
than the facts that must be taken as true in this case.
QUESTION: Well, it's not defending Regulation
429, according to you. Regulation 429 as it reads says,
he is released as soon as he agrees to go back to the work
crew without disruption.
MR. SCHLICK: That's right. My point, Justice
Scalia --
QUESTION: So regulation 429 is not in the case,
according to you.
MR. SCHLICK: -- is that the respondents have
briefed the case as if they were acting in compliance with
Regulation 429, which is not in our view how the case must
be taken. Now --
QUESTION: At least the case in the Eleventh
Circuit, because it wasn't in the case. It wasn't in the
case before the district court. It was -- in the district
court it was just restraint as punishment. The idea of
this being a temporal measure to get him to go back to
work doesn't show up till the Eleventh Circuit, and the
Eleventh Circuit rejects it because it wasn't raised in
the district court.
MR. SCHLICK: That's correct, Justice Ginsburg.
QUESTION: So the regulation is not before us,
you're saying.
MR. SCHLICK: That's correct.
QUESTION: Okay.
MR. SCHLICK: To answer Justice Kennedy's second
question, how would this Court address the issue if Gates
v. Collier did not exist, in that case, a reasonable
officer -- the question would be, what would a reasonable
officer -- what would have been clear to a reasonable
officer. The reasonable officer could have made a
colorable argument that the appropriate analysis is the
deliberate indifference standard established by this
Court's decision in Farmer v. Brennan, that standard being
whether the officer was deliberately indifferent to a
substantial risk of serious harm.
The reasonable officer could further have
concluded that neither the May incident in this case nor
the June incident in this case presented a substantial
risk of serious harm.
QUESTION: So you think deliberately indifferent
is a sufficient standard for the imposition of liability
without more specificity. All officers must be aware that
their specific acts can be challenged under the general
standard of deliberately indifferent.
MR. SCHLICK: Yes, we think it would be
sufficient to establish a substantive violation of the
Eighth Amendment, although as the facts must be taken
here, qualified immunity would attach, because there's a
colorable argument that the threshold was not crossed, but
I'd want to say that this Court has not resolved whether
it's this deliberate indifference standard or rather the
Hudson v. McMillian test, the excessive force test of
whether force was used maliciously and sadistically to
inflict harm, and that is an unresolved question, is,
it's -- that is that very absence of certainty that would
be most relevant absent the Gates v. Collier decision. In
this --
QUESTION: Suppose I think that I have to reach
the question of whether it would violate the Constitution,
not just whether the Eleventh Circuit said it would. Do
you think it would violate the Constitution to make the
inmate stand in a corner, to immobilize him to that
extent?
MR. SCHLICK: You would need to know more,
not --
QUESTION: To go stand in the corner.
MR. SCHLICK: Not in all instances, no, Your
Honor.
QUESTION: So what makes the difference is, you
say stand in the corner, and I'm going to handcuff you,
and that's the difference between cruel and unusual, and
not cruel and unusual?
MR. SCHLICK: The relevant considerations,
Justice Scalia, would be the degree of pain and the threat
to the safety of the inmates.
QUESTION: It's not necessarily the degree of
pain. Being handcuffed to some immobile object, any --
not much more than standing in a corner.
MR. SCHLICK: The overarching question of
whether the pain was wanton and unnecessary would focus on
the degree of pain, the penalogical justification, and the
threat to the inmate's safety, so you would need to know
the facts that bear on those inquiries.
In this case, as I've said, the Eleventh Circuit
decision of Gates v. Collier was directly on point. It
provided sufficient certainty for the officers here, and
it was correct in that as applied to these facts, under
this Court's decisions, there was an Eighth Amendment
violation.
QUESTION: I didn't understand your last
statement. You say, it would depend on the facts, the
degree of pain, the circumstances. I thought your argument
for the proposition that any physical restraint as a form
of punishment is bad.
MR. SCHLICK: No, Your Honor. That --
QUESTION: You're not.
MR. SCHLICK: It's the petitioner's position,
but not a position of the United States.
QUESTION: Ah. All right. All right. All
right.
MR. SCHLICK: If the Court has no further
questions --
QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Schlick.
Mr. Forrester, we'll hear from you.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF NATHAN A. FORRESTER
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. FORRESTER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
In the last 15 years, at least eight Federal
master judges and eight Federal district judges in Alabama
have read the law to hold that handcuffing a prisoner to a
restraining bar or to a similar stationary object does not
violate the Eighth Amendment.
QUESTION: Have they discussed Gates? I didn't
go to look at the district court opinions, though you
cited them, but did those opinions discuss Gates?
MR. FORRESTER: No, Justice Souter, they didn't
pointedly cite Gates.
QUESTION: Did they just ignore the pre-Eleventh
Circuit precedent? I mean, how did they get by without --
MR. FORRESTER: Primarily they refer to the
subsequent authority in Williams v. Burton and Ort v.
White, and I don't think that we can presume that they
stargazed and ignored it, or that they just thought that
case really had been largely superseded by this subsequent
clarifying authority.
QUESTION: What was the subsequent clarifying
authority? Gates was a specific injunction. It said, we
won't use physical restraints or punishments. What came
after from the Eleventh Circuit that modified that
injunction?
MR. FORRESTER: Well, the proposition for which
petitioner's amici wish this Court to read Gates and say
that our respondents should have read Gates is this very
broad proposition that any form of restraint as a form of
punishment is unconstitutional, although that proposition
has clearly been narrowed not just by the Eleventh
Circuit's rulings and rulings in Williams v. Burton and
Ort, which indicated that certainly in an excessive force
context you could restrain a prisoner for a period of
time, but also by this Court's rulings in Wilson v. Seiter
and Whitley v. Albers, and the clarifying ruling in Farmer
v. Brennan, where this Court indicated that the fact that
a restraint was possibly objectively problematic is not
enough to create an Eighth Amendment right. There had to
be --
QUESTION: If we are assuming the fact as
alleged, as it was used here, not to quell a riot, not to
keep things calm in an interim, but as a means of
punishment -- because that's what I understood the
injunction in Gates was, not, you couldn't use restraints
in a temporary situation, but that you could not use it
strictly for punishment purposes --
MR. FORRESTER: Well --
QUESTION: And that, as far as I know, hasn't
been modified.
MR. FORRESTER: A couple of responses to that.
The first is that the restraint was not used in this case
as a form of punishment. Petitioner never alleged or
presented evidence that it was used as a form of
punishment. That phrase does not appear anywhere in his
first affidavit or his second affidavit. He simply says
that he was put on the bar, and our respondents put him on
the bar not to punish him, per se, but because he was
refusing to work under the regulation.
QUESTION: But you didn't bring up the
regulations in the district court. At least the Eleventh
Circuit said it was nowhere in the record.
MR. FORRESTER: Well, first of all we think that
the Court's entitled to take judicial notice of it,
because it is the law, that you don't have to actually
introduce the law into the record, but on top of that, it
was always in the mix. The district court -- the activity
log for the petitioner's first day on the bar is a copy of
the log that comes from the appendix to the regulations.
QUESTION: What has that got to do with it, that
reg? I mean, so what? That is, his allegation is that he
was left for 7 hours on a very hot day with his arms about
over his head, standing up, and given no water, except
once, so there are 3 hours at least without any water.
All right, that's his allegation.
Now, introduce any regulation you want, why
doesn't that create an issue for trial?
MR. FORRESTER: Well, because, the Your Honor,
the most important fact there is that he could have gotten
off the bar --
QUESTION: I don't see anything, all right, that
he said that was so, and I don't see anything where
anybody in the record said that was so.
MR. FORRESTER: The regulation --
QUESTION: So what is the regulation? Did you
move, did you say -- did you say -- I don't see in these
papers in front of me, say that the reason we're entitled
to summary judgment is, it was ordinary practice to let
the person go off, and then you'd cite that, and here
they're following ordinary practice.
Now, maybe then they'd have to have replied, but
I couldn't find anything like that. Where does it say
that in the trial court?
MR. FORRESTER: No, Your Honor, we didn't say
that, but it was petitioner's --
QUESTION: Then why isn't it --
MR. FORRESTER: Because it was petitioner's
burden, as the plaintiff, to set forth the facts that made
that his claim.
QUESTION: They set forth facts.
MR. FORRESTER: And once we --
QUESTION: They set forth facts, and the
question is, why doesn't that -- I gave you the facts, and
why doesn't that present -- I would have thought as a
trial judge you'd say, of course that's an issue for
trial, unless, of course, there's something unusual here,
something unusual that may be -- and you're saying --
where is this counter thing in the trial court? I don't
see it. I have nothing -- I take it I should take this
case as there having been nothing along the lines you're
talking about in the trial court.
MR. FORRESTER: The activity log that is in the
record is --
QUESTION: What page should I look at? I'll
look at whatever you tell me to look at in the trial
court.
MR. FORRESTER: It's pages 38 in --
QUESTION: I read through once, and I could find
nothing --
MR. FORRESTER: I'm sorry, Your Honor. Pages 38
and 39, the activity log.
QUESTION: Where do you find that, the joint
appendix?
MR. FORRESTER: Of the joint appendix.
QUESTION: 38 and 39?
MR. FORRESTER: Yes, Your Honor.
QUESTION: Is that of the second incident? I
thought there was no activity log of the --
MR. FORRESTER: Yes, that's the first incident.
QUESTION: All right. The activity log, as far
as I see it, says nothing about what you're saying. It
just says he was placed on a restraining bar for a fight.
MR. FORRESTER: Yes, Your Honor. It refers to
the two --
QUESTION: I've looked at it now. What does it
say?
MR. FORRESTER: It refers to the two conditions
that are the conditions for using the restraining bar
under reg 429.
QUESTION: Why don't you read that?
MR. FORRESTER: Refusing to work and being
disruptive to the work squad.
QUESTION: And what it says is, refusing to
work, fight.
MR. FORRESTER: Yes, Your Honor.
QUESTION: That's the reason that they put him
on the bar. Okay. Now what?
MR. FORRESTER: Yes, Your Honor. Now, the
bottom of the next page -- unfortunately there's a
typographical error in this appendix, but it says, Annex A
to AR 119. That should be 429, and we have gone back and
checked. The actual copy of this log in the record says,
AR 429.
QUESTION: Yes, and it says that right after it
says, restraining bar to be used only during daylight
hours, Annex A to AR-119, so -- now, what has that to do
with it?
MR. FORRESTER: That refers -- that's actually
429, and that is the regulation.
QUESTION: Okay. Let's suppose that you're a
genius as a trial judge, and you happen to know that when
it says here AR-119 it means AR-429, okay. Now, what it
said is, restraining bar to be used only during daylight
hours, cite, 429. Now, how does that help?
MR. FORRESTER: Well, reg 429 is what these
respondents were following when they put him on the bar,
and this petitioner has not alleged that when he was put
on the bar he could not have gotten off.
QUESTION: Okay. I'll take that into account.
My other question is whether or not it is the
case that any human being would know that it is cruel and
unusual to keep a person, if that's what happened -- it's
what he's alleged -- keep a person chained with his arms
over his head, handcuffed to a bar, for 7 hours, in the
hot sun, not giving him water but for once, so he goes at
least 3 hours without water.
Now, is there a case that would confuse what I
think would be ordinary common sense on that -- at least,
or tell me why that isn't ordinary common sense to think
that that is very cruel, and certainly an unusual thing to
do.
MR. FORRESTER: Yes, Your Honor. Let me preface
my response with one quick -- he wasn't cuffed with his
hands over his head. They were chest high. His own
pictures show that in the joint appendix, but I would draw
Your Honor's attention to a district court opinion which
is transcribed in the joint appendix. It starts at --
QUESTION: One of my pictures happens to show
it's slightly up here, his hands, and the others show it's
about eye level.
MR. FORRESTER: And he's slumping.
The -- I would like to draw Your Honor's
attention to this district court opinion that is
transcribed in the joint appendix at page 81. It's
entitled, Whitson v. Gillikin, and this was a 1994 case.
This was 1 year before the events in this case. Jim
Gates, who is one of the respondents here, was a defendant
in this case, and in this case the prisoner alleged that
he was put on the bar for 8 hours in 95-degree heat, which
is hotter than this case, was not given any water, was not
given any bathroom breaks, which has not been alleged in
this case.
The district court, or rather the magistrate
judge appointed counsel for this pro se litigant,
instructed counsel to go out and provide supplemental
briefing on the question of whether that circumstance
violated a clearly established right, and the court said,
I have done my own diligent search -- this is on page
89 -- the court has made a diligent search of the case
law, I requested additional brief from the parties, and
neither the court nor the parties have identified any
cases binding or otherwise in this circuit in which it was
found that the Eighth Amendment as violated in these
circumstances.
Now, we submit that if you have a learned
authority such as this reading the law that carefully and
not finding it in this manner, it would be exceedingly
unfair to hold our respondents --
QUESTION: This is --
MR. FORRESTER: -- responsible for doing the
same.
QUESTION: -- a post -- post Gates?
MR. FORRESTER: Yes. This is a 1994 case. This
is 20 years after Gates.
QUESTION: And it seems to me exceedingly
careless for the counsel who was appointed not to bring
that to the magistrate judge's attention.
MR. FORRESTER: Your Honor, in 28 years since
Gates v. Collier, no Federal court of which we are aware
has ever read it for the broad principle that petitioner
now seeks to read it in this case. It's clear in the
context of Gates v. Collier that the officers there were
employing -- were handcuffing prisoners to cells and to
fences for malicious and entirely arbitrary reasons. They
had no valid penalogical purpose whatsoever.
QUESTION: The more drastic episode in this case
was the second episode, and there you can't even point to
an activity log, didn't even write it up. The State
treated it as though it didn't happen.
MR. FORRESTER: Well, Your Honor, it's not clear
that they didn't write it up, and furthermore it wasn't
respondent's responsibility.
QUESTION: Whose burden was it -- whose burden
would it be to show an entry in the activity log? After
all, the prisoner doesn't -- is not the custodian of that
log. Isn't it the State's obligation to bring it forward,
just as it was brought forward with respect to the first
instance?
MR. FORRESTER: Yes. We attempted to find it,
and just couldn't find it, and these three respondents,
moreover, were not personally responsible for the activity
log. They weren't responsible for keeping it because they
weren't the one supervising him, and they weren't
responsible for his custody after it was kept.
QUESTION: They weren't responsible for how long
he was left on the bar, either.
MR. FORRESTER: Correct, Your Honor.
QUESTION: Which makes me wonder whether it was
your burden to bring in the regulation or, rather, whether
it was the burden of the plaintiff to show that these
defendants, when they put him on the bar, knew that he
would be left on the bar for 7 hours, and if that was
their burden, it seems to me it's not up to you to
volunteer the defense which is in the public record, that
in fact, if the prison policy was followed, he wouldn't
have been left there for 7 hours as soon as he agreed to
go back to the work crew.
QUESTION: But it's your position, I take it,
that so long as the regulation was in place so that he
could go back to work, that the State could legitimately
keep him --
MR. FORRESTER: Yes.
QUESTION: -- hanging to this rail for as long
as it takes, no matter how hot it is, and without water,
for as long as the State chooses to use it, just so long
as the regulation is there that says, you can go back to
work?
MR. FORRESTER: No, Your Honor.
QUESTION: Is that your position?
MR. FORRESTER: No, Your Honor, not hanging from
the rail.
QUESTION: Well, like this.
MR. FORRESTER: Chest high -- chest high, like
this --
QUESTION: All right.
MR. FORRESTER: -- where he can stand fully
erect --
QUESTION: In this case, handcuffed to the
rail --
MR. FORRESTER: Yes, Your Honor.
QUESTION: -- for as long as the State wishes
without administration of water or bathroom breaks, just
because there's a regulation that says he can go back to
work. That's your position?
MR. FORRESTER: No, Your Honor. The regulation
clearly entitles him to regular water and bathroom breaks.
QUESTION: But the allegations are that he was
not given water and not given bathroom breaks. We take
those allegations as true for purposes of a summary
judgment motion.
MR. FORRESTER: No, Your Honor, he did not
allege, ever, nor present evidence that he was denied a
bathroom break, and he did not allege that he was denied
water. He simply said that during one 3-hour stretch
these two other defendant, nondefendant officers, who are
clearly not these three respondents, deprived him of water
and -- you know, in acts --
QUESTION: -- certainly in the hot sun for 3
hours without water is fine. That's fine?
MR. FORRESTER: If it is being done because he
has refused to work -- and I would hasten to add, Your
Honor, this is --
QUESTION: But we have nothing in the record, as
I understand it, to indicate that. Your position on that,
as I understand it, is that's what the regulation makes
clear, that that's why they were doing it, but the
regulation is not on the record, and I don't see any basis
upon which a United States district court is required to
take judicial notice of every State's prison regulations
if the State doesn't want to put it into the record.
MR. FORRESTER: Yes, Your Honor. I mean, I
would note that even in the absence of the regulation the
district court didn't find his allegations in evidence
sufficient to make out a claim that would withstand
qualified immunity, so introducing that only makes the
case all that stronger, but I would hasten to add that the
Court did make a finding that he was put on the bar
because he was disruptive to the work crew -- work squad.
That is the condition in the regulations. He was not put
on the bar for a strictly punitive purpose in the sense
that petitioners are arguing --
QUESTION: Can you help me with this, Mr.
Forrester? The assumption seems to be in the State's
argument that if you restrain a person in order to -- then
choose the word, convince, coerce him to do something,
that is not punishment. I thought one of the purposes of
punishment was rehabilitation, or corrections, as well as
deterrence and prevention.
MR. FORRESTER: Yes, Your Honor.
QUESTION: Why isn't this punishment if you're
doing this in order to have him comply with your command?
MR. FORRESTER: Yes, Your Honor, it is certainly
punishment in the broad sense. For instance, it is a part
of prison life. We're not saying that it shouldn't be
analyzed as to whether it's cruel and unusual, but in the
narrow sense in which they are using it, and in the narrow
sense in which Ort v. White sought to distinguish
punishment from what it termed an immediately necessary
coercive measure, this requires --
QUESTION: Yes, but Mr. Schlick, can I just ask
you about the case you called our attention to on page 89-
90 of the -- and there, according to the magistrate
judge's opinion, Judge Putman, in that case the plaintiff
was refusing to check out in his work detail, but then he
gave him the choice of either working or being handcuffed
to the security bar. There's no such allegation in this
case, is there?
MR. FORRESTER: Petitioner never alleged that he
couldn't have gotten off the bar --
QUESTION: But you didn't allege that you gave
him the choice, did you?
MR. FORRESTER: The petitioner bears the burden,
as the plaintiff, to say I could not have gotten off the
bar if I had asked for it.
QUESTION: I must say, I can't understand why
that wasn't put in by the State. I can't -- I cannot
imagine why the State did not raise that point, that he
could have gotten off the bar at any time by just saying,
I'll go back to work. Why -- what's your explanation for
that?
MR. FORRESTER: Well, it is a regrettable --
QUESTION: Regrettable, it's incomprehensible.
MR. FORRESTER: -- litigation error.
QUESTION: Why doesn't the -- Ort, which you say
he's the magistrate on page 89 and 90, supports your
position. Interestingly enough, that case is cited by the
Government in support of its position, and I suppose the
reason is because they make very clear in that case that
it was unusual to deprive a person of water, and in that
circumstance, absolutely necessary, and so how, in this
circumstance, was it necessary to do what he says they
did?
I was deprived of water, was teased by two
officers when I asked for water, on one occasion they
started to bring me water but ended up giving it to some
dogs, I was given some once or twice during 7 hours, but
that was not enough, and at one point during the hottest
part of the day I was left without water for at least 3
hours.
All right, so for a person reading the case of
Ort, and then reading that, you would think that Ort
actually supports the Government, not you, because --
unless, of course, there's some reason that behavior like
that, if it occurred, would have been necessary, so what
is the necessity, or what can you say about it?
MR. FORRESTER: Well, I would hasten to add,
Your Honor, those allegations that you keep reading again
are not alleged against our three respondents.
QUESTION: That's, of course, what you say, but
what the allegation says is that it was your three
respondents. In -- on -- in the affidavit what he says
specifically on that is, he says, I believe that the
officer who actually put me on the hitching post was
defendant Sergeant Mark Pelzer. However, a report says I
was put there by defendant Gates, and an officer named
Mark Dempsey, and then McClaran wrote the report, and in
McClaran's reply he suggests he was there, and so I don't
see any denial here by your particular clients that they
were not responsible for this, and he alleges they were.
QUESTION: Would that be your burden? Is that
their burden to say, I was not responsible, or is it the
plaintiff's burden to say, you were responsible for not
giving me water?
QUESTION: That's not there. The language I
read was the plaintiff's affidavit saying they were
responsible in his opinion.
QUESTION: Responsible for putting him onto the
post.
MR. FORRESTER: We do believe it was the
plaintiff's burden, Justice Breyer. The excerpt you just
read actually refers to the first day he was on the bar,
May 11. The second day was not when Pelzer put him on the
bar, but it is no way clear from that that either Pelzer
or Gates, who it would appear put him on the bar, stuck
around after that.
QUESTION: It's an important point for me. I
still don't understand why coercion to comply with an
order by a restraint is not a punishment.
MR. FORRESTER: We do think it's punishment in a
broad sense. That's trying to make too fine a point. The
point I'm trying to respond to is their contention
basically that there was no valid penalogical purpose for
putting him on the restraining bar, that this was somehow
arbitrary or retaliative, or retributive and not remedial,
which was the purpose. The purpose here was to get him to
go back to work. It wasn't --
QUESTION: But he says, and we must take this as
true I think at this stage, I have no reason to say I'm
willing to go back to work because I never for a moment
said I wouldn't work. They took me away from the work
site. In one case I was having a fight with somebody, but
in neither case did I say, I won't work. This was not a
man who said, I want to be back in my cell watching the
television and not working.
MR. FORRESTER: Yes, Your Honor, but getting
into the altercation, actually getting to the point where
he had his blade raised and was ready to strike another
inmate, is certainly disruptive to the work squad, and
that's a serious security issue for these --
QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Forrester.
Mr. Schaerr, We'll hear from you.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GENE C. SCHAERR
ON BEHALF OF MISSOURI, ET AL., AS AMICI CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS
MR. SCHAERR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
We believe this case is controlled by any of
three common sense principles of law, each of which is
essential if this Court's qualified immunity doctrine is
to prevent the problems that it was designed to prevent.
The first is that where personal liability is at
stake, public officials shouldn't be expected to be more
adept at construing case law than the State court judges
whose decisions are reviewed in Federal habeas
proceedings.
Now, the United States appears to adopt a
standard that would be equivalent functionally to the
standard that this Court has already adopted in the habeas
context, and we think the United States' argument in this
point is correct, and in fact we believe the Court has
already come close to adopting that standard in the
Saucier decision, which said the proper inquiry is whether
the case on which a plaintiff relies occurred, and I
quote, under facts not distinguishable in a fair way from
the facts presented in the case at hand. It seems to me
that is just another way of saying that the facts of the
two cases can't be materially indistinguishable.
QUESTION: Well, let me ask you a different
question, though. What's the conceptual difference
between materially similar, which was used here, and
fundamentally similar, which was disapproved in Lanier?
MR. SCHAERR: Well, as I understand, the
fundamentally similar requirement required a much tighter
fit between the facts of the two cases than the materially
similar standard does, and I think --
QUESTION: I mean, maybe you're right, but I
don't know that from looking at the two words. I mean, it
sounds to me as though materially and fundamentally are
substantially similar.
(Laughter.)
QUESTION: I mean, I --
MR. SCHAERR: And not materially -- you got it.
QUESTION: But it's splitting it pretty fine, it
seems to me, and wouldn't it be better, wouldn't it serve
clarity better if we in effect said in this case, look,
stop paraphrasing the standard, and just stick to the
basic standard, and that is, would it be clear to a
reasonable officer?
MR. SCHAERR: Well, it seems to me, Justice
Souter, the way you answer that question is, you look at
the case law, and that's what at issue here. There's no
allegation that the text of the Eighth Amendment or that
any statute bars the conduct at issue here.
QUESTION: So you're saying regardless of how
they paraphrased it, when you get down to the district
court cases, on any standard, they ought to win. That's
it. You're not resting anything on materially similar as
the right way to describe it.
MR. SCHAERR: Well, I think it is important and
useful for this Court to make the link to the habeas
context, because I think that would provide greater
clarity in the law, and the ultimate standard under this
Court's decisions is whether official action violated
clearly established law.
Well, that's the exact -- that's exactly the
same phrase that's used in the habeas statute, and that
this Court has interpreted in Williams and Penry II as
meaning materially indistinguishable, and it would be
useful, and I think quite productive to apply that in this
context as well, and would bring greater clarity to the
law.
QUESTION: But isn't that -- isn't it a concern
for the State court, because here we're talking about an
officer, and did he follow what was an Eleventh Circuit
decision.
MR. SCHAERR: Right.
QUESTION: There, we're talking about a Federal
court overriding a determination by a State court, so I
don't think the settings are similar. There's a
particular concern that the habeas statute reflects, and
that is not overriding a State court's determination.
MR. SCHAERR: Sure, but -- and I agree the two
situations are not entirely identical, but if anything it
seems to me the section 1983 context raises even greater
federalism concerns, because as this Court recognized a
couple of terms ago in Geyer v. Honda, litigation can
often be the functional equivalent of a statutory -- of a
statute or a regulation, and so what happens in the 1983
context, as illustrated in this case, is that courts
articulate broad rules that purport to govern the conduct,
the day-to-day conduct of elected and nonelected State
officials, and so it seems to me if anything the
federalism concerns are greater.
In another important way, public officials,
nonlawyer, nonjudge public officials are at a disadvantage
and that, as this Court noted in Saucier, and I quote,
public officials are often forced to make split-second
judgments in circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and
rapidly evolving, unlike judges, who can take all the time
they want sometimes to --
QUESTION: Yes, but wait a minute, this is not
split-second. We're talking 7 hours here.
MR. SCHAERR: I agree with that, Justice
O'Connor, but the standard, it seems to me, needs to apply
to the full range of official action that would be covered
by 1983.
QUESTION: Yes, but you have to ask whether a
reasonable officer in these circumstances would have known
that what was done was unconstitutional.
MR. SCHAERR: I think that ultimately is the
answer, and it seems to me the way you answer that is
asking the question posed in Saucier, of whether the two
cases are materially -- well, are -- whether there's a
fair distinction between the two cases, which seems to me
amounts to material distinction.
QUESTION: If you're requested to advise the
correctional officers in your State as to the standard,
the constitutional standard they must observe with
reference to restraining inmates, and circumstances like
these, what is the standard that you tell them they must
follow?
MR. SCHAERR: Well, I don't think that's clear
from this Court's decisions at this point, as the United
States --
QUESTION: Well, they come to you, and you're
their attorney, and you have to figure out what we mean up
here.
MR. SCHAERR: Well, at --
(Laughter.)
MR. SCHAERR: At worst -- at worst I would tell
them they have to follow the standard in Farmer. That is,
their actions can't be objectively cruel, but they also --
they also cannot act with a subjective awareness of a
serious harm to the inmates, and it seems to me that's the
key distinction in this case between Gates, or the key
reason why Gates is not controlling here.
Gates was decided long before Whitley and Farmer and
all of those decisions that made clear the subjective
requirement in the Eighth Amendment, and indeed if you
look at the Eleventh Circuit's opinion, there's not even a
finding of any awareness of serious harm that would come
to these inmates. They just completely overlooked the
serious harm requirement, and so it seems to me Gates,
based on this court's current cases, Gates is easily
distinguishable, and can't be taken as controlling here.
Now, the second principle that I'd like to
address is the principle --
QUESTION: Well, I don't see in Gates -- and I'm
reading from page 1306, where they talk about being put in
awkward positions, though.
MR. SCHAERR: Right.
QUESTION: I don't see any requirement of
serious harm to the inmates.
MR. SCHAERR: Well, that's right, and that's why
it seems to me Gates had been overtaken by this Court's
subsequent decisions and therefore was not -- was no
longer binding, even if you take it on the terms that the
petitioner was --
QUESTION: What decision --
QUESTION: Yes, what --
QUESTION: -- of this Court do you rely on as
changing what Gates said?
MR. SCHAERR: Well, Farmer added a new
requirement. Well, not just Farmer, but Farmer and the
other decisions that preceded it added a requirement of
subjective awareness of a risk of serious harm. Gates
didn't impose that kind of requirement at all, and
therefore once this Court's decisions made clear that that
subjective requirement was present, Gates, it seems to me,
could no longer be regarded as controlling in this
situation, even if you interpret Gates on its own terms.
as the petitioner would have you.
QUESTION: Well, even if that were a
requirement, you think the allegations here don't suffice?
MR. SCHAERR: No, I don't. At worst, the --
QUESTION: That one would not -- a reasonable
person would not be aware that you couldn't restrain
someone on a post or rail for 7 hours in the heat, without
water more than every 3 hours?
MR. SCHAERR: Well, I think the question is
whether the harm that you could foresee from that -- and
the record does not suggest that he was without water. He
says that he received water only once or twice during that
7-hour period. Lots of people go without water and food
for 24 hours.
QUESTION: Yes, but also no bathroom breaks.
MR. SCHAERR: I'm sorry.
QUESTION: Also no bathroom breaks for 7 hours.
MR. SCHAERR: There's no allegation of that in
his affidavit.
QUESTION: Well, the court of appeals said there
was.
MR. SCHAERR: The court of appeals made a
mistake, and this Court has the ability to review the
summary judgment record de novo, and it's not a long
record.
But that leads me to the -- to my second
principle, and that is that a public official shouldn't be
held liable under section 1983, or shouldn't be stripped
of his or her qualified immunity except on the basis of
his or her own actions based on reasonable inferences from
the summary judgment record, and it seems to me that
principle is well-illustrated in the Saucier decision that
this Court decided last term.
Indeed, as Justice Ginsburg recognized in her
concurrence in that case, the evidentiary predicate for
denying qualified immunity must consist of what Rule 56(e)
calls specific facts set forth in affidavits or other
similar evidence. General allegations are not enough, in
the summary judgment context, even though they might be on
a motion to dismiss.
QUESTION: Can I just ask you a specific
point --
MR. SCHAERR: Yes.
QUESTION: -- because he's right about -- my
thing about the defendants was not June 7, it was, he
alleges it. Is there any place in the record where it's
denied that these are the right defendants?
MR. SCHAERR: With respect to some of the
activity, yes. I couldn't give you the pages as I sit
here, but the burden is on the plaintiff to make that
record.
QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Schaerr.
Mr. Jones, you have 3 minutes left.
MR. JONES: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and
may it please the Court:
If the Court has no questions, we submit that
the judgment of the court of appeals should be reversed.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Very well. Thank you,
Mr. Jones. The case is submitted.
