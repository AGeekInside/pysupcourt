FEINERMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. FEINERMAN: Thank you,\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:\nThe 1997 amendments to IDEA prohibit tuition\nreimbursement awards for students who are unilaterally\nplaced in private school without first having received\nspecial education services from the public school\ndistrict.\nThis is so under ordinary principles of\nstatutory construction and particularly so under the\nSpending Clause clear notice rule.\nPrior to 1997, IDEA did not expressly\naddress tuition reimbursement for unilaterally placed\nstudents. In 1997, Congress added section\n1412(a)(10)(C). In subsection (i), Congress provided\nthat when the school district makes a free appropriate\npublic education available, a FAPE, no reimbursement is\nallowed. And then in subsections (ii) through (iv),\nCongress addressed situations where courts and hearing\nofficers may award tuition reimbursement and said that\nreimbursement may be allowed where the school district\ndoes not make a FAPE available to a student who\npreviously received special education services from the\npublic district. Congress said nothing --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Feinerman, but the --\nthe first provision that you read, sub (i), says that\nthere will be no reimbursement if the agency has made a\nfree appropriate public education available to the child\nand the parents elected to place the child in private\nschool. But that \"if\" -- if the agency made a free\nappropriate public education -- and here, as I\nunderstand it, the school district said that this child\nwas ineligible for special education.\nMR. FEINERMAN: That's correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So if the child was\nentitled to a free appropriate public education and\ndidn't get it, then under this sub (i), wouldn't the\nparents be entitled to tuition reimbursement?\nMR. FEINERMAN: No. Subsection (i) covers\nstudents who are provided a free appropriate public\neducation. Subsections (ii) through (iv) address the\nother category of students --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that's your --\nMR. FEINERMAN: -- those who are not --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's your construction.\nBut couldn't this be read to say no reimbursement if --\nthe word is \"if\" -- the agency, not -- so the\nimplication is if the agency did not make a free\nappropriate public education available, then --\nMR. FEINERMAN: That -- that might be the\nimplication if there weren't subsection (C)(ii) through\n(C)(iv). So it's -- it's T.A.'s argument and the\ngovernment's argument that (C)(i) sets forth the general\nrule, but if that were the way that -- that Congress\nmeant the statute to operate, it wouldn't have had any\nreason to put in (C)(ii) through (C)(iv) because we\nwould already know from (C)(i) that tuition\nreimbursement was a possibility for students who did not\nreceive -- previously receive special education services\nfrom the public district.\nCongress instead went on in (C)(ii) through\n(C)(iv) to address very specifically, in the context of\na comprehensive statutory scheme, when tuition\nreimbursement would be available to students who did not\npreviously receive. And Congress specified, after\nessentially being invited to do so in Burlington, which\nof those students could get tuition reimbursement. And\nthe --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, (ii) through\n(iv) don't -- don't limit or contradict any explicit\nrequirement of (i).\nMR. FEINERMAN: Oh, no. It --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: (i) is only at most a\nnegative implication, which -- which one would not draw\nin light of (ii) through (iv), is what you're saying.\nMR. FEINERMAN: Yes, that's exactly what I'm\nsaying. And -- and they deal with different sets of\nstudents. In (i), the school district has made a FAPE\navailable; in (ii) through (iv), the school district has\nnot made a FAPE available. And no mention is made of\nwhen a FAPE is not made available to a student who had\nnot previously received.\nAnd under this Court's decision in\nArlington, because those students like T.A. who had not\npreviously received, are not mentioned, yet Congress --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then -- then what happens\nin a case which I think is like this one, where the\nchild doesn't receive special education because the\nschool has determined that the child is not eligible?\nSo the child isn't getting public education, and in the\nparents' view, confirmed by experts, the child is in\nneed of special education, can't get it from the public\nschools, because they declared the child ineligible.\nWhat is such a parent to do?\nMR. FEINERMAN: If -- if it's an incorrect\ndetermination by the school district, the problem is\nremedied rather quickly. There are very tight time\nframes in IDEA --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, the parents here\ndidn't -- didn't run off to a private school only after\nthe school district had found that their child didn't\nrequire any special education, did they?\nMR. FEINERMAN: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They -- they put him in a\nprivate school without even consulting the schools.\nMR. FEINERMAN: Right. And then only after\nthe fact went to the school district and asked for --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Saying by the way, we can\nget some money. How much -- how much money are you\ntalking about imposing on the school district here?\nMR. FEINERMAN: Well, it's -- the tuition is\n$5,200 a month.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: A month?\nMR. FEINERMAN: Yes, and then there's a\n$5,200 alumni services fee, a $1,500 interview fee. But\nlet's --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Feinerman, can we go\nback to the time frame again? I've just got a question\nof fact. I should know this, but I don't. You said\nthat if the -- if the parents and the school district\ndisagree, it can be remedied fairly quickly because\nthere's a fairly tight schedule set for the\nadministrative procedure. What I don't remember, and my\nquestion is this: When the administrative steps have\nbeen exhausted, if there is still disagreement, is there\nany limit on the time in which the -- the judicial\nappeal has to be resolved?\nMR. FEINERMAN: No, there isn't. So --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't that the -- isn't\nthat the kicker here? In other words, I -- I fully\nunderstand your -- your textual argument. I -- I can\nsee its soundness as a possibility that is open to us\nand, perhaps on the face of it, the most likely\npossibility, but there is a cost, and the cost, it seems\nto me, is that once you get into the -- once you get\ninto appeals, this thing can go on for years, and you\ncan't wait years when -- when a kid is in this kind of\ncondition.\nMR. FEINERMAN: That's correct, but there's\nno need to wait years. Let's assume that parents\nactually went through the process appropriately, unlike\nT.A.'s parents --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But if you can explain\nwhat the process is --\nMR. FEINERMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- because Justice Scalia\nsaid the parents just went away. The school at an\nearlier point said this child was ineligible for special\neducation, isn't that so? I think --\nMR. FEINERMAN: That's correct. That was in\n2001, and the district judge, at --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.\nMR. FEINERMAN: -- at page 39 of the\npetition to the -- of the appendix to the petition, page\n39 note 3, the district judge noted that the 2001\nevaluation is an appropriate part of this case. But for\nthis -- for the parents who try and get their student --\nget their student evaluated, the school district says,\n\"No. The child is ineligible\"; and then the parents --\nat that point, the timing kicks in. The parents can ask\nfor a due process hearing the next day. Under the time\nperiods that were in place when T.A.'s case was going\nthrough --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that hearing --\nMR. FEINERMAN: -- the hearing officer --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that hearing on\neligible or not, or is it on what the IEP should be?\nMR. FEINERMAN: Well, it's --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: When the school said not\neligible, is there -- is that question resolved first\nbefore we ever get to the IEP?\nMR. FEINERMAN: I think, in a situation\nwhere the school district finds the child ineligible and\nthere is an appeal, both the eligibility and the\nappropriate placement are decided in front of the\nhearing officer. And there was a 45-day time period at\nthe time T.A.'s case went through for the hearing\nofficer to make a decision. And then after that, it's\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, wouldn't the school\nsay, we -- we have no obligation to get up an IEP until\nthe question of eligibility is determined?\nMR. FEINERMAN: I suppose if the school\ndistrict were to get a stay of the hearing officer's\ndecision pending appeal to the district court. But\nthat's not what happened here. What happened here is\nthat the hearing officer decided on June -- January 26,\n2004, that T.A. was eligible. On February 19th, quicker\nthan the 30 days allowed, Forest Grove School District\nproposed an IEP that could have started as soon as\npossible thereafter, as the regulations require.\nSo you are talking about a very tight -- I\nunderstand the situation that you are hypothesizing,\nJustice Ginsburg, but we are talking about a very tight\nturnaround in T.A.'s case, 75 days, which is a matter of\nweeks, not a matter of years as was the case in\nBurlington.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What happens when we get to\ncourt?\nMR. FEINERMAN: Excuse me?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What happens when we get to\ncourt? Isn't that when it turns into a matter of years?\nMR. FEINERMAN: It turns into a matter of\nyears, but in the interim this school district, Forest\nGrove School District, while it was litigating in the\ndistrict court, Forest Grove School District offered an\nIEP, and at that point T.A.'s parents could have tried\nthe IEP out, sent the child to receive services in the\npublic school district --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The IEP -- they did the\nIEP after the hearing officer was finished?\nMR. FEINERMAN: Yes. Less than 4 weeks\nafter the hearing officer was finished, Forest Grove\noffered an IEP, and that's in the addendum to our reply\nbrief.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But I think we've\ngot to assume that Congress has some concern for the\nparents who correctly say, this IEP is no good, it just\ncan't be done in the school system, and the kid needs a\nspecial school. In that case, maybe -- your answer may\nbe that's the exceptional case and it shouldn't drive\nthe -- the inferences to be drawn about congressional\nintent. But in that case, if the district and the\nparents are at good faith loggerheads it can go on for a\nlong, long time, can't it?\nMR. FEINERMAN: It can go on for a long,\nlong time if the parents file for a due process hearing,\nand that it can --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but they get the due\nprocess hearing. The ultimate result is that the school\nproposes an IEP; the parents, based on what their\nexperts tell them, say that isn't going to work, and the\nparents say the only way we can educate this kid without\nhis falling behind more is to put him in a private\nschool. At that point, with assuming good faith here,\nit seems to me you get into court and it can go on for a\nlong time, if we accept your -- your analysis of the\ntext.\nMR. FEINERMAN: But all the parents have to\ndo in that situation is to give the IEP a try and send\ntheir child to public school.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but doesn't that get\nto the point of something pretty formalistic? I mean,\nsomebody in the brief said, given one day under the IEP\nand the -- if you win, ultimately the check can be\nwritten. That can't be right.\nMR. FEINERMAN: I don't think one day could\nbe right. The statute says -- it -- it expressly says\n\"who previously received special\" -- \"special education\nservice under the authority of a public agency.\" It\ndoesn't say how long it has to be.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe -- I'm sorry.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I remember, perhaps\nincorrectly, from the prior argument here that the\nperiod that they had to try out the school plan was ten\ndays?\nMR. FEINERMAN: That -- that's a\ndiscretionary factor that courts and hearing officers\ncan -- it's not a hard and fast rule.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not a hard and fast\nrule.\nMR. FEINERMAN: But I think it's probably\ngood as a general benchmark.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So is that -- is\nthat a period that your client's prepared to accept?\nMR. FEINERMAN: Yes, so long as -- in the\nordinary case, ten days would -- it's in the statute, so\nwe have that textual indication. And it will provide\nthe school district a chance to provide services under\nthe IEP.\nAnd as this Court mentioned in a prior case,\nIEP's -- it's not an exact science and when you look at\nit on a piece of paper it's hard to know whether it's\ngoing to work or not. The way you find out whether it\nworks is where the rubber hits the road and it could be\nthat the parents look at IEP and say, you know what, I\ndon't think this is going to work. But until you\nactually give it a chance to work -- maybe the child\ngoes in and -- and works with the special education\nteacher or the instructional assistant and they really\nhit it off.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do you think that's\nrealistic? If the parents are convinced going in that\nthis is an inappropriate IEP and they send the child to\nschool for ten days under the IEP, at the end of the ten\ndays they are going to say, oh, well, we've completely\nchanged our mind, now we think this is a good plan?\nMR. FEINERMAN: It's certainly plausible\nunder certain circumstances. It -- it may not happen\nevery time. And it may not happen half the time.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't it also plausible\nthat the district will say, ten days is not a fair trial\nfor this system, this is a child with severe learning\ndisabilities and to give this IEP a fair chance we need\nten months?\nMR. FEINERMAN: At that point those\narguments can be made under (C)(iii) and (C)(iv) because\nat that point the child would no -- the parents would no\nlonger be categorically barred from seeking tuition\nreimbursement and those are arguments that you can make\nto the hearing officer.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But you are basically\nsaying that the -- that the only necessary delay in\norder to satisfy a condition for eligibility, if the\nparents otherwise prevail, is a ten-day delay. That's\nbasically your answer?\nMR. FEINERMAN: I -- I don't think I'm\nsaying that. I'm saying --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This school does not have\nto come up with an IEP. It could tough it out and say,\nwe're going to rest on our belief that this child does\nnot need any special education, right? And unless the\nschool proposes an IEP, the parent cannot come within\nsubsection (2) by sending the kid to get the special\nservices.\nMR. FEINERMAN: I think that assumes that\nthe school district is not going to abide by the order\nof the independent hearing officer. And in this -- in\nour case.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What about before? The\nwhole point is that under the words of the statute as\nyou interpret it, there is a condition predicate that\nhas to be satisfied. So, to say that -- to answer by\nsaying, well, that assumes they won't obey the hearing\nofficer, what about before the hearing even takes place?\nMR. FEINERMAN: Right. Before the hearing\ntakes place, there is 45 days, and then well, the\nhearing -- there's a request for a due process hearing,\nthe hearing officer has 45 days, and then if the hearing\nofficer says this child is eligible, district, you must\npropose an IEP, the district has 30 days after that.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, what happens in the\ncase where --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Could the district appeal?\nThat's the end of the road? Can't the district say the\nhearing officer is wrong?\nMR. FEINERMAN: Absolutely, the district can\nappeal.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And if it does, does it\nhave to take any action in the interim.\nMR. FEINERMAN: I suppose it, yes, unless it\ngets a stay of the hearing officer's ruling.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Which is --\nMR. FEINERMAN: But that didn't happen here\nand I am not aware of any cases which it did happen. In\nthis case there are two tracks. The hearing officer\nsaid: T.A. is eligible; prepare an IEP. The district\nsaid: I disagree; I'm going to appeal to the district\ncourt.\nBut in t mean time, within less than 28\ndays, t district prepared an IEP and offered it to T.A.\nAnd at that point T.A. could have accepted the services,\nthus rendering him eligible for tuition reimbursement.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I still don't understand\nyour answer to Justice Scalia. What if the school board\njust was adamant that he is not entitled to any special\neducation? It just maintained that position throughout\nthe litigation?\nMR. FEINERMAN: I think the assumption is\nthat the school district would not abide by a lawful\norder of a hearing officer.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, they got a stay and\nthey wanted to appeal it. And if they did what happens?\nMR. FEINERMAN: In that situation there\nwould be no -- and I'm not aware of that situation ever\nhappening --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But they don't have a risk\nunder your view of the law as I understand it. They\ncould take that position and they would never be\nliable -- never be liable.\nMR. FEINERMAN: There would be a delay in\nthat situation, but I'm not aware of any case where that\nsituation -- where a school district.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But that's the consequence\nof your position as I understand it, that they could do\nthat and they would not have any risk of liability.\nMR. FEINERMAN: I think that's a\nhypothetical risk, because again I haven't seen any\nsituations where that actually has occurred.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but it's not that\nhypothetical when -- there are two prongs. Number one,\nthe school has to agree first with the diagnosis, which\nin this case they didn't even do that. They had a good\nfaith disagreement. Second, they have to have an\nadequate IEP. So there are two conditions.\nMR. FEINERMAN: That's true, and I think --\nI think the answer to the question -- it's really, this\nis really a legislative question. Perhaps Congress\nought to further amend the statute to say in those\nsituations where a school district is being obstreperous\nin refusing to comply with the hearing officer's order,\nin those situations there is going to be an exception to\nthe exception. But it's not -- it's not the statute\nthat Congress wrote. Congress wrote --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Doesn't your\ninterpretation of the statute create an incentive for\nthe school board to just say, we'll never provide any\nkind of education, special education, we will just tough\nit out? Because they can't lose, they can't be liable\nif they do that, if I understand you correctly.\nMR. FEINERMAN: I -- I suppose\nhypothetically it does, but my understanding is that\nthat just doesn't happen. In Schaffer v. Weast and\nother cases, the assumption --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Would you be surprised to\nfind a court decision which says that when the reason\nthat the plaintiff cannot comply with the requirement\nthat he first be in a plan, when the reason is -- is the\ndistrict's refusal to abide by an order to prepare a\nplan, that subsection (2) does not apply?\nMR. FEINERMAN: Your --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You can't profit by your\nown malfeasance.\nMR. FEINERMAN: That's correct. And I -- I\ndon't think there could be reimbursement under\nsubsection (ii). Perhaps if there were a parallel\nRehabilitation Act claim under 504, that might be a\nvehicle to get relief in a situation where the school\ndistrict is acting as horribly as being hypothesized,\nbut not under --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you -- you don't think\n-- you don't think a court could say the only reason\nthese people could not comply with (ii) is that the\nschool district made it impossible by not complying with\nthe order to provide an IEP; and, therefore, they --\nthey can recover for the private placement?\nMR. FEINERMAN: It's conceivable that --\nthat a court could hold that. A court could also --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think it's more than\nconceivable. I know a lot of courts that would hold\nthat.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But your position is that\nthere are basically two situations: One, the situation\nin which there is an administrative order to do an IEP\nand the school district says, no, we won't do it.\nMillions for defense; we are going right into appeal,\nand we are not going to prepare the IEP. In that\nsituation, as I understand it, you are saying, the\nparents have no way of getting relief under the statute.\nIn the case in which there is an order for\nthe IEP and the school district prepares the IEP, even\nthough the parents think it will be inadequate, there in\nfact is a ready remedy subject to two delays: One, the\ntime to prepare the IEP; and, two, ten days to give it a\ntry before the parents take the kid out of school.\nThat's basically the scheme that you are proposing that\nthe statute provides; is -- is that correct?\nMR. FEINERMAN: That's the scheme that\nCongress wrote in the statute, yes, under -- under\n(C)(ii). And it has to work that way, because -- I want\nto come back to a -- to a point that was aired in the\nbriefs, which is T.A.'s argument and the government's\nargument rests upon the notion that section\n1415(i)(2)(B)(iii) gives hearing officers the authority\nto award tuition reimbursement. That provision doesn't\ngive hearing officers any authority to do anything, let\nalone to award tuition reimbursement.\nThe only provision in IDEA that gives\nhearing officers the authority to award tuition\nreimbursement is 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii). So if the statute\ndoesn't work -- the statute doesn't work, and the\nSecretary's interpretation of 1415(i)(2)(B)(iii) is\nimplausible because it accords to hearing officers the\nauthority that it doesn't have.\nThere is another textual clue why the\nstatute works in the way that I am suggesting, and that\nis in the '97 amendments in subsections (iii) and (iv)\nCongress gave very explicit guidance to courts and\nhearing officers as to the factors the court and hearing\nofficer should consider when deciding whether to award\ntuition reimbursement to a student who previously\nreceived special education services.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The -- the problem that\nthe government and the parents have is they have to give\nsome work to (ii). Under -- under their view (ii)\ndoesn't seem to do much work.\nAnd the problem with your position is that\nit seems in a way formalistic and in some cases to\nencourage intransigence. If we adopted a presumption\nthat the school district's diagnosis was correct and a\npresumption that it's -- if -- if there was a diagnosis\nof disability, that its individual education program was\nadequate, that would, it seems to me, not be all you\nwanted, but would ameliorate the position of the school\ndistrict. Would we have authority, do you think, to\nadopt such a presumption?\nMR. FEINERMAN: I think the -- the Court\nalready has adopted that presumption in Schaffer v.\nWeast. School districts are presumed to be acting in\ngood faith.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, this -- this would\nbe a clear and convincing evidence presumption that the\n-- that the IEP is -- that the school district designs\nis right, that its diagnosis is right. That's not all\nyou -- that's not all you would be asking for.\nMR. FEINERMAN: Well --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But would we have\nauthority to do that if we were to reject your\ninterpretation of the statute?\nMR. FEINERMAN: I suppose you would have the\nauthority to do that.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How have -- how have\nhearing officers been proceeding? I mean, here we had a\ncase that went to a hearing officer. There is no IEP\nwhen the hearing officer begins the process. In the --\non the eligibility or not, do hearing officers give\ndeference to the school district and then -- so that's\neligibility. At the IEP stage, do they give deference\nto the student?\nMR. FEINERMAN: There is some deference\ngiven to -- are you talking about the deference that the\ndistrict court gives to the hearing officer?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: No, the hearing officer.\nThe hearing officer is the first-level decisionmaker.\nAnd the school board gives its reasons why it thinks the\nchild is ineligible; the parent, the reasons that the\nchild is eligible. That's the threshold determination.\nOn that threshold determination of\neligibility, do hearing officers presume in favor of the\nschool district?\nMR. FEINERMAN: Not -- not in this case. In\nthis case under Oregon law at the time -- and this was a\npre-Schaffer decision -- the hearing officer put the\nburden of proof on the school --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel --\nMR. FEINERMAN: -- on the question of\neligibility.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- why isn't it the\ncase that the school's diagnosis is a related service\nunder the statutory provision? It seems to me to be\nvery important service to the parents to know what the\nschool's diagnosis is.\nMR. FEINERMAN: I -- I think that the\ndiagnosis is more in terms of eligibility. It's\nunder -- under (b)(6), the hearing officer can decide --\ncan consider issues of identification, eligibility, and\nplacement.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I'm talking\nabout what the parents received. And they receive a\ndiagnosis, and the statute covers -- asks whether they\npreviously received special education and related\nservices. Diagnosis would seem to me to be a service\nrelated to special education.\nMR. FEINERMAN: I -- I don't think that's\nthe way it works. A diagnosis -- a finding of\neligibility or not is not a diagnosis. It is just an\neligibility finding, and that's something that the\nparents can take to a -- a due process hearing under\n1415(f).\nIf there are no further questions, I will\nreserve the remainder of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Salmons.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID B. SALMONS\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. SALMONS: That you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThe school district in this case improperly\ndenied T.A., a child with a disability who had always\nbeen enrolled in public schools, access to all public\nspecial education services. It asserts that because its\nwrong eligibility determinations prevented T.A. from\nreceiving special education services, it is immune from\nreimbursing T.A.'s parents the cost of obtaining those\nservices from another source.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is wrong with\nten days? I mean it's -- it's a big expense you are\nasking the school district to incur, that will take away\nfunds from other programs. And all -- all they are\nsaying is give it a try for ten days, and if it doesn't\nwork out, then you can go?\nMR. SALMONS: I think there are several\nproblems with that reading of the statute, Your Honor.\nFirst of all, the ten-day period that is referenced in\nsubsection (C)(iii) refers to the amount of notice that\na district needs to receive before a child is removed\nfrom the public school system.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, yes, the first\nday -- the first day they say, look, we don't think this\nis going to work out, so we are notifying you what we\nare going to do. And they say, well, you've got to do\nthat in ten days, and they said, okay, ten days.\nMR. SALMONS: But that's -- that's simply\nnot the way these things work as a general matter, and\nlet me just point out a few things about the normal\nprocess of developing IEP's. And, again, here the child\nnever even got that far. But, typically, IEP's are\ndeveloped at the end of the -- of a school year for the\nfollowing year. And the parents at that point have a\nperiod of time in which to decide to go along with that\nplan or to give notice and then make alternative\narrangements.\nAnd it's simply the -- I mean -- and that's\nthe way it works, because it's important for parents to\nbe able to get their child in an alternative program if\nthey decide that's what they want to do. And if you\nwait until the school year has already started, those\nmay not be available. And the ten-day notice\nrequirement --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I suppose\nthat's right, but once the law is clarified, schools\nthat specialize in -- in treating these kids would be\nable -- they would understand as well, and they would\nunderstand you've got to -- the people who are going to\nbe sending -- most of the people who will be sending\ntheir children to the school have to wait ten days. And\nit seems to me that the actual practice on the ground\nwould work out pretty easily.\nMR. SALMONS: But, again, Your Honor, if you\nfocus on the terms of the statute, the -- even under\nPetitioner's reading, the requirement would be to have\npreviously received special education services, not to\nhave tried out a particular plan.\nIt may be the case that the plan for the\nupcoming year is -- is very different than the plan for\nthe prior year. Perhaps they have had another\nassessment, and they had substantially changed --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, which way does\nthat cut? It seems to me that cuts the other way.\nMR. SALMONS: Well, I --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Here's a -- here's a\nnew plan. We've worked on it. Here it is. At least\ngive it ten days -- two school week tries.\nMR. SALMONS: I think the way that cuts,\nYour Honor, is -- is that that reading of what you are\npositing, I guess, in this exchange what Congress might\nhave had in mind, is not what they said in the statute.\nThey did not require parents to try out a particular\nplan; just that at some point in time they had\npreviously received special education services.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: With respect,\ncounsel, what Congress provided is that the child must\nhave previously received special education and related\nservices.\nMR. SALMONS: That's right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So I think they did\nprovide that you've got to try it out at least for a\nminimal period.\nMR. SALMONS: But not the particular plan\nthat is the subject of the IEP, Your Honor. That --\nthat connection does not exist in the statute. And --\nand we think it's counter to what Congress intended.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. So what type\nof special education services do you think do count as\nhaving been previously received?\nMR. SALMONS: Well -- well, if I -- if I\nmay, the way we read this provision, and it's set forth\non pages 3 and 4 on the addendum to the blue brief, and\nwe think it's important that we read this as a whole and\nin context, is that subsection (C)(i) provides the\ngeneral rule to govern the payment of private school\ntuition based on a unilateral placement by the parents.\nAnd subsection (C)(i) creates the only expressed\nlimitation on the right to reimbursement, and it does so\nonly in instances where the school district has provided\na free and appropriate public education.\nWe think subsection (C)(ii), (C)(iii), and\n(C)(iv) work together to govern the subset of cases that\nis Congress was most concerned about and that, in fact,\nare the most common scenario in which these disputes\nhave arised.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Except that you are reading\n(C)(i) to say something that it doesn't say. It just\nsays you don't have to pay if the agency has made a free\nappropriate public education available.\nMR. SALMONS: That is what --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you read it to say you\nmust pay whenever it hasn't made, and it just doesn't\nsay that. It -- it's a safe harbor for the school\ndistrict. It says, so long as you've made an\nappropriate public education available, you can't be\nliable for any -- any private school tuition.\nNow, you want to expand that to say, and\nwhenever that condition doesn't exist, you are liable.\nBut it really doesn't say that. And -- and the later\nsections suggest that it meant not to say that.\nMR. SALMONS: Well, that's where we part\ncompany, Your Honor, because, in fact, that negative\ninference that you refer to is precisely what\nPetitioners attempt to read into subsection (C)(ii).\nThere is nothing in subsection (C)(ii) that provides any\nrestriction on the ability to obtain reimbursement. It\nwas written in permissive language.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In reading -- in\nreading it that way, you are reading the phrase \"who\npreviously received special education services\" to mean\nalso who previously did not receive special education\nservices.\nMR. SALMONS: No, Your Honor. We are simply\nnot reading that language \"who previously received\" to\nbe a condition precedent.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah, so it doesn't\nmatter whether they previously received or not.\nMR. SALMONS: It does matter, Your Honor,\nbecause the provisions that follow in (C)(iii) and\n(C)(iv) that guide the exercise of discretion, in that\ncategory of cases that were of concern to Congress, only\napply to the cases that are defined in subsection\n(C)(ii). So in our reading the language \"who previously\nreceived\" still serves an important purpose, but it\nserves an identifying purpose for the limiting factors\nprovided in (C)(iii) and (C)(iv). It does not serve --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you are saying\nCongress went to the trouble of spelling out this\nelaborate provision in (C)(iii) and (ii) and all the\nother things, but that was not the universe of the\nsituations in which there could be reimbursement? They\nwent to that trouble, but then -- at the end you want to\nsay or some other provisions or some other\ncircumstances?\nMR. SALMONS: Well, that's right. We think\nthat Congress was focused on a particular set of cases\nwhere problems had arisen, and that's where you already\nhad a child in the process of receiving special\neducation and you had parents who removed the child out\nof that process without giving adequate notice, and\nthereby short -- excuse me -- short-circuiting an\nongoing collaborative relationship that Congress wanted\nto preserve.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but if -- if you avoid\nthat collaborative relationship entirely and just run\noff to a prior -- to a private school right away, you\nget reimbursement. Why?\nMR. SALMONS: Well you don't automatically\nget reimbursement.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why would Congress -- huh?\nMR. SALMONS: You don't -- you don't\nautomatically get reimbursement, Your Honor. There is\njust no categorical bar to seeking reimbursement. You\nstill have to show it's an appropriate remedy, which\nalways has been understood to require a showing that the\nparents acted reasonably and in good faith, and that\nthey were sincere in their efforts to obtain services\nfrom the school.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What about more than that?\nMR. SALMONS: The alternative --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why not -- I mean,\nsuppose -- the part I don't understand in this statute,\nwhich may not be relevant -- I would appreciate the\nhelp. It seems to me that (a)(10) large (A) and then\n(F) have something to do with the parent who never goes\nto public school, the child just goes to private schools\nto begin with, and they get something. If they have --\nif they have a disability, this program pays them\nsomething, right.\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not following this. I\ndon't know what section.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's at the very beginning,\nat the end of addendum page 1.\nMR. SALMONS: This is what's -- Your Honor,\nthis is what's known as the child find provision.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is that?\nMR. SALMONS: What it provides is that\nfor -- let me just step back for a moment and remind the\nCourt that the obligation on the State is to ensure that\nchildren, all children with disabilities, regardless of\nwhether they are in public or private school, have the\nopportunity for a free appropriate public education.\nWith respect to children in private school\nwho are not seeking a free appropriate public school\neducation from the public school district, the only\nrequirement under the Act is that you seek them out, you\nfind them, you identify them, and that you report that\nto the Department of Education, and that you get money\nfor those children. And for those children who are not\nenrolled in public school, you have to use a percentage\nof the funds you receive from the Federal Government --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So in other\nwords --\nMR. SALMONS: -- to provide benefits that are\navailable to all children.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- a parent who has a\ndisabled child who never thinks about the public school\nsystem still gets some money, but not as much, for the\ndisabled child?\nMR. SALMONS: It's not money to the parents,\nYour Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's money to the school.\nMR. SALMONS: It funds programs, for example\nspeech therapy or something like that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: To the school.\nMR. SALMONS: That they would then allow\nchildren in private school to -- to benefit from.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And so, it's money that\ngoes to the school for a program?\nMR. SALMONS: It's not even necessarily\nmoney that goes to the private school.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Money that the children can\nget. I get it.\nMR. SALMONS: It goes to the public schools,\nthat they provide services that they may make available\nto children regardless of their placement.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, would it\nthen work, what is -- would this system work under the\nstatute? You say, parents, if you are going to a\ndisabled child, you simply go to a private school, you\nget the services you just mentioned.\nNow, if you put in -- put the child in a\npublic school, and they find a free appropriate public\neducation, fine, that's the end of that, you have to do\nit. Now, if they don't give you a decent one, you can,\nyou can send the child to a private school, but it\nhas -- you have to give it a shot to the public school\nsystem.\nNow, that's what you don't want the\ninterpretation to be? You don't -- you are against\nthat. But -- but let's amend it a little.\nMR. SALMONS: That's not -- I would not\ndescribe it that way, Your Honor, if I -- I don't mean\nto --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I am reading the language.\nYou may require the district to pay for someone who has\nbeen enrolled in special services --\nMR. SALMONS: I mean, again, just keep in\nmind the facts of this case. This is a child who was in\nthe public school system --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You haven't heard my\namendment.\nMR. SALMONS: Okay. I'm sorry, Your Honor.\nGo ahead.\nJUSTICE BREYER: My amendment is the norm\nwill be give the public school a shot, but there could\nbe circumstances, you're getting the run-around, there\nis need to put that child in a public school now. In\nother words, special equitable circumstances that make\nit reasonable for the parent not to give the school a\nshot, though that's the norm. And in those unusual\ncircumstances, there would remain grounds for equitable\nrelief.\nWhat about that as an overall interpretation\nof the statute which has several parts to it?\nMR. SALMONS: I would submit that the way we\nread the statute, Your Honor, in fact, does precisely\nthat. Because, the school district -- just again, take\nthis --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But you have to be willing\nto accept that it's an unusual situation, though it may\nwell exist, that the judge is going to reimburse the\nparent where that parent didn't give the public school a\nshot. They will have to show there is a good reason for\nnot doing that.\nMR. SALMONS: The -- the difficulty I\nhave --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is that all right with you\nor not?\nMR. SALMONS: Well, the difficulty I have\nwith your question, Your Honor, is that the school\ndistrict always has a shot under the Act. In this case,\nthe school district assessed the child in 2001 and again\nin 2003, and both times it erroneously concluded\nthat the child --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, you are simply saying\nthat it was reasonable for the parent here. I'm not\nasking that question.\nMR. SALMONS: No, not just that it's\nreasonable, but in the process of assessing the child,\nin developing an individual education plan that is\nappropriate for that child, that is precisely the shot\nthat the statute gives the public school system to get\nit right. What the statute does --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Salmons, I thought\nthat the -- the courts, the district court, will not\nprovide for tuition reimbursement, unless at least two\nthings are shown. One is that the school district did\nnot provide an adequate education for this child. And\ntwo, that the private school did, and then there are\nequitable considerations.\nMR. SALMONS: That is absolutely correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So you must find both,\nnot just that the private school was a good place, but\nthat the school district did not offer an adequate\neducation for the child.\nMR. SALMONS: That is -- that is correct.\nThat is what this Court held in Carter. That's what the\nregulations say. I would note that there is nothing in\nthe text of the statute and the provisions that\nPetitioner relies on, (C)(ii) for example, that makes it\na statutory requirement to show that the private\nplacement is reasonable as a -- as a condition precedent\nto obtain tuition reimbursement. But both sides concede\nthat that's required, even though it's not in the\nstatute.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But procedurally we -- we\nknow that there is a provision addressed to a court for\nequitable relief. The question was put before: Where\ndoes the hearing officer get the authority to order\ntuition reimbursement? Because the statute on which you\nrely for the court speaks only to the court's authority.\nMR. SALMONS: Thank you, Your Honor. I am\nhappy to answer that question. But Petitioner makes\nthis a centerpiece of their reply brief and I think they\njust misread the statute. And again, keep in mind that\nthese amendments in 1997 were written against a backdrop\nof this longstanding statute and this Court's\ninterpretations of it. The most direct place where the\nstatute provides hearing officers the authority to hear\naddress reimbursement claims and to award\nreimbursement -- and this is on page 9 of the addendum\nin the blue brief -- is 1415(b)(6). This has always\nbeen in the statute and it states that the parents must\nbe provided an opportunity to present complaints with\nrespect to \"any matter relating to the identification,\nevaluation, or educational placement of the child, or\nthe provision of a free appropriate public education to\nsuch child.\"\nThat is -- again, that has always been\nunderstood to include the right to seek reimbursement\nbefore the hearing officer. And this Court in\nBurlington cited legislative history from the 1975 Act\nthat noted that hearing officers could award\nreimbursement and address such claims in concluding that\nit was part of the appropriate relief that courts ought\nto be able to have under 1415.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Are any of these other\nprocedures -- I took these to be procedures that have to\nbe provided by the school district, not -- not by the\nhearing officer.\nMR. SALMONS: These are -- these are\nrequired -- this whole section, Your Honor, 1412, is\nentitled \"State Eligibility,\" and these are all\nrequirements that States have to provide for process in\norder to obtain funds under the Act, and so it is a\nrequirement that States provide hearing officers that\nhave the ability to award reimbursement --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But it doesn't say hearing\nofficers. \"An opportunity to present complaints with\nrespect to any matter relating to the identification\" --\nMR. SALMONS: Those complaints --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- to present the complaint\nto the principal.\nMR. SALMONS: No, Your Honor. This is a\nreference to the due process complaint notice that is\nreferenced elsewhere in the statute. I believe\nPetitioner would agree with me that that's what this\nreferences.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but the reference is to\na right to be heard on certain subjects. It doesn't say\nanything about authorizing a particular individual or\nofficer within a school system to award relief. The\nproblem is, it says you can be heard. It doesn't say\nwho will tell you or who will tell the school district\nto write a check.\nMR. SALMONS: Right. But keep in mind that\nthe judicial review process that the statute provides --\nand this is at page 17 of the addendum. The right to\nfile a Federal action is limited to those matters that\nare raised in the due process complaint notice filed\nbefore the hearing officer. This is an exhaustion\nrequirement.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But can you raise the --\nyou can raise the claim to eligibility to a -- a private\neducation here without the hearing officer having the\nauthority to order the school district to provide it.\nMR. SALMONS: That has not been the\ninterpretation of this Act, Your Honor, and I would\nrefer the Court to 34 CFR 300.148(b), which is a\nregulation that states that hearing officers can award\nreimbursement and that has been around since the mid-\n1980s. My point is that is -- the Congress enacted\nthese amendments in 1997 against a subtle understanding\nof how this Act works. And it's always been understood\nthat hearing officers can award reimbursement. There\nwas no need to provide in the '97 amendments that\nhearing officers can also award relief.\nAnd again because it's an -- it's an\nexhaustion requirement and the judicial review provision\nonly relates to the things that you have raised before\nthe hearing officer, it makes no sense to say a court\ncan award reimbursement but you can't get reimbursement\nfrom the hearing officer. That's the subject of the\nreview of the Federal court action.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but it might make\nsenses to say that the hearing officer can determine\neligibility; it is then up to the school to pay it; and\nif the school does not pay it, then you have got to go\ninto court and get an award.\nMR. SALMONS: In fact, Your Honor, the\nhearing officers have always been permitted to award\nreimbursement, as occurred in this case, and then the\nschool district can decide either to pay that or to seek\nreview if they -- if they so choose.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And it might make also\nsense to say that if the hearing officer has no\nauthority to award a certain type of relief, neither\ndoes a court, under that general provision that --\nMR. SALMONS: But of course this Court in\nBurlington held the court did have that authority and it\nrelied on the fact that it has always been understood\nthat hearing officers have that authority in reaching\nthat conclusion in Burlington.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's right, but -- but\nwith these new provisions, if the hearing officer\ndoesn't have the authority to award the kind of relief\nthat was awarded here, then the court wouldn't either.\nMR. SALMONS: Well, I -- with respect, I\nthink there is nothing in the '97 amendments --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you agree they go, as\nwe say, in pari passu --\nMR. SALMONS: Well, I do think that it\ndoesn't make sense to say --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that -- that whatever\nthe hearing officer can do, the court can do.\nMR. SALMONS: I think generally --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- and whatever he can't\ndo, the court can't do.\nMR. SALMONS: I think they ought to be read\ntogether, yes, Your Honor. But I think they ought to be\nread to provide for the authority to provide tuition\nreimbursement.\nOne statutory point I would like to make,\nYour Honor, is that under Petitioner's reading of the\nAct, if you read (C)(ii) to be -- that reference to \"who\npreviously received\" to be an absolute precondition,\nthen I think it's the case that (C)(i) has no meaning\nwhatsoever. It does not work under the Act at all.\nWhereas on our reading of the statute, (C)(ii) still\ndoes work. It's not a precondition; it doesn't do the\nwork that Petitioner suggests; it does a more limited --\nserve a more limited function, but it still serves that\nidentifying role for the factors Congress wanted applied\nwhen it was focused on how to preserve relationships,\nongoing collaborative relationships through the IEP\nprocess that warrant preservation.\nOne other point I make, Your Honor, and\nJustice Scalia, you make reference to this principle of\nequity, that you ought not be allowed to prevent\nsomething from happening and then come into court and\nclaim, \"Ha, ha, they didn't satisfy a condition.\" And\nthat was a point that was made by Justice Cardozo in the\nR.H. Stearns case that we rely on, where he said he who\nprevents a thing from being done may not avail himself\nof the nonperformance which he himself has occasioned.\nThat's precisely what happened here. As\nthis case to this Court, it is established that is a\nchild who was entitled to receive special education\nservices back in 2001. The only reason he did not\nreceive those services is because the district violated\nits statutory duties --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought in 2001 even\nthe parents agreed that he didn't -- that they didn't\nwant to put him in special education?\nMR. SALMONS: The parents agreed, Your\nHonor, that he did not qualify for the learning\ndisabilities they tested him for, but they had an\nobligation under the Act -- and this was found by the\nhearing officer and the complaint that was filed was\nfiled within the two-year limitation to challenge that\n2001 determination, and that that was there, they had an\nobligation to test him for those other health\nimpairments at that time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. SALMONS: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Miller.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. MILLER\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT\nMR. MILLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nHad Petitioner provided T.A. a special\neducation that was later determined to be inadequate,\nthere would be no question that the district court would\nhave authority and discretion to determine whether an\naward of private school tuition reimbursement was\nappropriate. Petitioner's view is that because it\noffered no special education at all, it was therefore\ncategorically immune from such an award. That position\nis not supported by the statute and it's inconsistent\nwith the reasonable interpretation of the Secretary of\nEducation.\nThere is no basis for reading the statute to\ncreate what effectively would be an incentive for\ndistricts to stonewall and to say that if they don't --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, for 10 days,\nright? Even assuming the bad faith that you are\nascribing to the school district, it would only work for\n10 days, right?\nMR. MILLER: Well --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And then they would\nhave -- then they would have previously received special\neducation services, and they could proceed.\nMR. MILLER: We were not assuming bad faith.\nOr --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: \"Stonewall\" sounds\nto me like bad faith.\nMR. MILLER: Well there --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That was the word\nyou used.\nMR. MILLER: I -- Congress -- there is no\nreason to suppose that Congress wanted to create an\nincentive or to reward districts that do do that.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But we are talking about\ntwo different things. I think the Chief was talking\nabout putting the child in special education, and\nkeeping the child there for 10 days. You are talking\nabout the school district that says \"no special\neducation; this child is not eligible.\"\nMR. MILLER: That's absolutely right. So in\na case like this, there is -- there is nothing to try\nfor 10 days because the district has found him not\neligible, they haven't offered any special education or\nrelated services. Now to the extent --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, let's move to\nthe situation where they have a plan that the parents\nregard as inadequate.\nMR. MILLER: In the case --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In that situation\nall they would have to do is to have the child try the\nplan for 10 days.\nMR. MILLER: Well if the -- to the extent\nthat there is an interest in having parents try out the\nplan, Petitioner's reading of the statute is poorly\ntailored to that objective, because it doesn't require\nthat they try the specific plan that's being proposed\nfor 10 days.\nEven under Petitioner's reading the statute\nsimply would require that the child at some point have\nreceived some special education and related services.\nIt wouldn't have to be under the plan that was being\ntried. And --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But the odds are that it\nwould be under the plan. I mean, what you say is\ntheoretically possible, but in the real world it's\nprobably going to be under the plan, isn't it?\nMR. MILLER: Well, not necessarily because\nthere's a new plan at least once a year under the\nstatute, and they are typically proposed at the end of a\nschool year for the start of the new school year. So\nthere wouldn't be, on Petitioner's reading, a\nrequirement that you show up for the first 10 days of\nthe new year; you would just have to give notice after\nthe IEP is proposed in May or June. You give your 10\ndays' notice. You receive special education services\nunder the old plan, under the previous year. And under\n-- on Petitioner's reading, the statute would be no\nbarrier to reimbursement there.\nNow, of course, the district courts do have\nconsiderable equitable discretion, and we're not\nsuggesting that reimbursement would be mandatory in that\ncase or in any case. And --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And the parents -- I\nthink you agree that the parents would have the burden\nof showing both that the school did not provide an\nadequate education, an appropriate education, and that\nthe private school does?\nMR. MILLER: That's -- that's absolutely\nright. And they would also, in our view, have to show\nthe district court that they had genuinely cooperated\nwith the public school in making their child available\nfor evaluation --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose we thought it were\nsensible to add to that burden the further rule that the\nschool district is presumed to have made the correct\ndiagnosis and, if there is a plan in that kind of case,\nthat the plan was adequate, and that the parent would\nhave to show by clear and convincing evidence that this\nis not so, rather than just inventing it and pulling it\nout of the sky.\nIs -- is there some authority in the statute\nthat would give us warrant to do that? Or is there\nsome -- any cases that would give us warrant to -- to\nestablish a presumption of that kind in order to\nrecognize the long-standing expertise of the States in\nthis matter and in order to allow section (ii) to do\nsome work?\nMR. MILLER: Well, a clear and convincing\nevidence presumption would be difficult to reconcile, I\nthink, with 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii), which says that the\ndistrict court decision should be based on the\npreponderance of the evidence, but it is certainly\nwithin the district court's discretion and it would be\nwithin this Court's discretion, I think, to prescribe\nprinciples to guide the exercise of the district courts'\nequitable discretion --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The district court\ndoesn't get into the act until the hearing officer is\ndone.\nMR. MILLER: Right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And so it would be odd to\nhave a presumption applicable in court that isn't also\napplicable to the hearing officer, because the court is\nreviewing a decision by the hearing officer.\nMR. MILLER: Right. Well, the -- the\nstandard in both stages of the proceeding is by a\npreponderance of the evidence, and the parents, as the\nparty challenging what the school has done, have the\nburden. But at both stages, it would be appropriate to\nconsider whether they were genuinely seeking a free\nappropriate public education, and I think it would be\nentirely appropriate and consistent with the\npreponderance standard for the hearing officer or the\ncourt to take due account of the fact that the school\ndistrict has some expertise and to give some deference\nto what it has proposed.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: (i)(2)(B)(iii) --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is the department --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: (i)(2)(B)(iii)?\nMR. MILLER: Oh, it's (i)(2)(B) -- it's been\namended in 2004. There's no change in the language,\nbut it's now --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's now (C)?\nMR. MILLER: (C).\nJUSTICE SCALIA: (C)(iii).\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Does the -- does the\ndepartment have a regulation that says the hearing\nofficer may order the private school -- the parents to\nbe reimbursed for private school tuition? Because it's\nnot in the statute.\nMR. MILLER: 34 C.F.R. 300.148(b) says that\ndisagreements between the parents and a public agency\nregarding the availability of a program appropriate for\nthe child and the question of financial reimbursement\nare subject to the due process hearing procedures. So\nyes, that regulation gives hearing officers the\nauthority to award reimbursement, as indeed the hearing\nofficer had done Burlington. Burlington was the case\nwhere the reimbursement award was made in the first\ninstance by a hearing officer, and, of course, the Court\nheld that that was appropriate. And --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, this is\nSpending Clause legislation. Do you have any rough idea\nof how much of the obligation incurred by the States is\nreimbursed by the Federal Government? What percentage?\nMR. MILLER: I think of the additional costs\nof treating special education children, above those of\neducating other children, I think approximately\n10 percent, 10 to 12 percent, is reimbursed by the\nFederal Government.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if this\ninterpretation vastly expands the liability of school\ndistricts in that particular area, isn't that a\nconsideration we should consider? Since they accept --\nthe States accept 10 percent of the funds to incur these\nobligations and then you are expanding the obligation in\na way that we may at least find is ambiguous, isn't that\na pertinent factor?\nMR. MILLER: There's no basis for supposing\nthat there would be a vast expansion of liability, and\nthere are some statistics on this in the National\nDisability Rights Network's amicus brief at pages 13 and\n14. Of about 6 million children in the United States\nwho are receiving special education, barely 1 percent of\nthose are in private placements, and the vast majority\nof those are agreed-upon placements between school\ndistricts and the parents. So this sort of unilateral\nprivate placement is quite rare, because, first, the\nparents do it at their own financial risk, and so\nthere's a real barrier to parents doing it, because they\nhave to be pretty sure that they are right and that they\nare going to be able to meet the demanding standards of\n-- satisfying the district court that an award of\ntuition reimbursement is appropriate, and if they don't\ndo that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If the --\nMR. MILLER: -- they're going to be --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If the parents are\nentitled and the child is entitled to the special\neducation and the school doesn't give it, and there are\ntwo schools -- private schools in the community, A and\nB. A charges, what is it, $5,200 a month tuition; the\nother is considerably less. And they both have adequate\nprograms for the child. Is the hearing examiner\nentitled to reimburse only for the lower amount, or is\nthe parent entitled to send the child to the -- to the\nmore expensive school?\nMR. MILLER: No. What this Court said in\nCarter is that it's appropriate for the hearing officer\nto take into account whether the cost of the private\neducation was unreasonable. So in a situation where you\nhad two basically equivalent schools, that would\ncertainly be an appropriate thing for the hearing\nofficer to take into account in limiting or denying\nreimbursement.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Or there could be, I\nsuppose, an order that any tuition in excess of a\ncertain amount would be the parents' responsibility.\nMR. MILLER: That's -- that's right. That\nwould be within the discretion of the hearing officer.\nIn a case like this, where you have a\nresidential placement and the residential component of\nit -- there has been no suggestion that that was -- had\nsome educational purpose or was a part of providing an\nappropriate education, it would also be appropriate for\nthe court to decide to disaggregate that and say we are\nonly paying -- the school district only has to pay for\nthe educational component.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Let me be clear. Am I\ncorrect that under -- under the theory of the statute\nthat you are supporting, it would be possible for a\nparent, without first consulting with the school at all,\nto put the child in a private school and then later to\nrequest public school services, and when it is -- when\nthey are denied or they are inadequate, all that public\nschool -- private school tuition would be reimbursable?\nMR. MILLER: There would be no categorical\nbar in the statute in that situation, but a district\ncourt confronted with those facts would most likely\nconclude that the parents had not genuinely sought a\nfree appropriate public education and hadn't\nappropriately cooperated with the school district.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. MILLER: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Feinerman, you\nhave 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GARY S. FEINERMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. FEINERMAN: Thank you,\nMr. Chief Justice.\nI'd like to address the two provisions that\nwe have heard today for the first time. T.A. and the\ngovernment are resting their argument that tuition\nreimbursement is permitted in the unilateral placement\ncontext to students who had not previous received. The\nregulation 300.148 -- counsel referenced subsection (b),\nDisagreements about FAPE, and it does say that the\nhearing officer can consider the question of financial\nreimbursement. And the very next subsection, (c), is\nentitled Reimbursement for Private School Placement, and\nthat provision speaks only to students who previously\nreceived special education and related services under\nthe authority of a public agency.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Where are you reading\nthis?\nMR. FEINERMAN: This isn't -- this\nregulation was brought up at argument. It's not in any\nof the addendums, but I -- I would direct the Court's\nattention to subsection (c) of 300.148.\nIn terms of the -- the provision that T.A.'s\nlawyer addressed, 1415(b)(6), no argument -- there's no\nargument in the briefs that 1415(b)(6) gives hearing\nofficers the authority to grant tuition reimbursement in\nthese circumstances. The Department of Education did\nnot rely on this provision when articulating its\ncommentary that tuition reimbursement is still permitted\nunder these circumstances. The Secretary of Education\nrelied upon the 1415(i)(2)(B)(iii) provision. That of\ncourse, refers only to courts.\nAnd even if the argument were properly\npresented, which it isn't, it would be subject to the\nsame dynamic that's in play with respect to\n1412(a)(10)(C)(ii). You have a very general provision\ngiving hearing officers authority. Congress got\nspecific in 1997. There's a heading -- enacted a\nprovision under the heading Reimbursement for Private\nSchool Placement. I think that clearly indicates that's\nwhere Congress intended to repose the authority of\nhearing officers to order tuition reimbursement to\nunilaterally placed children.\nWe also have the -- and -- and it just\ndoesn't work to say that 1415(i)(2)(B)(iii) somehow\ngives hearing officers authority. Even if it were\ninterpreted that way prior to 1997, in 1997 Congress\nenacted the statute that expressly referenced hearing\nofficers and courts, and allowed both of them to give\ntuition reimbursement. So even if 1415 were interpreted\nprior to '97 -- incorrectly, we would submit -- to give\nhearing officers that authority, after 1997 where\nCongress actually went to the trouble of saying hearing\nofficers and courts can give tuition reimbursement in\ncertain circumstances, that -- that prior\ninterpretation, whatever its merits back then, no longer\nis valid --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, what happens -- what\nhappens if the hearing officer can't, but why couldn't\nthe court? I mean, they see an unusual situation. The\nparents were justified, and it doesn't say there are no\ncircumstances other than -- where you couldn't -- where\nthey may not pay. So the judge says, I think this is a\nsituation where it is -- it is equitable to pay the --\nthe reimbursement.\nMR. FEINERMAN: That's correct, but --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why not? What says you\ncan't do that, other than your basic point about the\n\"may require\"?\nMR. FEINERMAN: The Spending Clause, the\nheadings that Congress used --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. But anyway, the\nregs don't say anything about that.\nMR. FEINERMAN: At any rate -- and it's a\nsystem that doesn't make any sense, because for children\nwho did previously receive and go to the hearing officer\nto challenge either an eligibility determination or an\nimproper IEP, the hearing officer could award tuition\nreimbursement, but for children who didn't previously\nreceive and then they went in front of the hearing\nofficer, they would have to -- I don't know what the\nword would be -- appeal to the district court in order\nto get tuition reimbursement. Is it conceivable that\nthat that could be the system --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You're saying the statute\nsays the hearing officer can't do that no matter what.\nThat's a separate argument.\nMR. FEINERMAN: That's correct, but I'm\nsaying if --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right.\nMR. FEINERMAN: If T.A. is right, that would\nbe the system.\nThank you very much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
