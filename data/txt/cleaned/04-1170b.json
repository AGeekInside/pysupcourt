KLINE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis Court has never held that a specific\nmethod of weighing aggravating and mitigating evidence\nis required, yet in its individualized sentencing line\nof cases this Court has consistently said that all the\nEighth Amendment requires is that a juror consider and\ngive effect to all relevant mitigating evidence. In\npages 23 through 28 of your appendix, you will find\nthe Kansas jury instructions and Kansas law clearly,\non four occasions, instruct individual jurors that they\nmust individually consider all mitigating evidence that\nthey find. Furthermore, the jurors are instructed in\nfive different methods in which they can give that\nmitigating evidence the effect of a life sentence, and\nonly one manner in which, acting unanimously and after\nthe State has met the highest burden allowed by law in\nthree separate measurements, beyond a reasonable doubt\ndemonstrated that the death sentence is appropriate.\nSpecifically, instruction number 4, paragraph\n2 on page 24 of the joint appendix, will show the\njurors are instructed that mercy, in and of itself, is\na mitigating piece of evidence, and later, in the\ninstruction that lays out the mitigating evidence\npresented in this specific case, they are told, in\nparagraph 18 on page 26 of your joint appendix, that\nmercy, by itself, can be sufficient to warrant a\nsentence other than death.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I'm sorry, what\ninstruction is that?\nMR. KLINE: Justice Scalia, you will find it\n-- first of all, mercy is referred to in paragraph --\nin instruction number 4 --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I got --\nMR. KLINE: -- paragraph 2 -- okay.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that one. It's the other\none. It was instruction number --\nMR. KLINE: The instruction, again, is number\n4 in paragraph 18 on page --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I gotcha.\nMR. KLINE: -- 26.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: All the way at the end of 4,\nokay.\nMR. KLINE: You will see the instruction for\nmercy again.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you began by saying\nthat there's three different measures, I think -- I\nthink was the word you used. And the State, I take it,\nmust prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, (a) that it was\nan aggravated -- or, (a) that it was an aggravated\nmurder, (b) that there was another crime involved --\nMR. KLINE: Justice --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- sort of --\nMR. KLINE: -- Kennedy --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- if you could just walk\nme through that.\nMR. KLINE: Certainly. First of all, the\nState has to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, with\njury unanimity, that the defendant is guilty of capital\nmurder. And Kansas has one of the most narrow death-\npenalty statutes in the Nation. And then, past that\ntime, we then engage in a sentencing --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And --\nMR. KLINE: -- phase 5.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- capital murder includes,\nin this case --\nMR. KLINE: Capital murder includes, in this\ncase, that the homicide involved more than one person\nin a single act.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Involved more than one\nperson. Then, second?\nMR. KLINE: Then we go to the sentencing\nphase, in which the State has to prove one of eight\nstatutorily defined aggravating factors beyond a\nreasonable doubt with jury unanimity. There were three\nspecific aggravating factors that were found by the\njury in this instance. And then, the defendant\nintroduces all mitigating evidence, and the standard of\nintroduction is relevancy. But, unlike the Walton\ncase, which has a functionally identical provision that\nis at issue here, the State maintains the burden,\nwhile, in Walton, the burden was provided to the\ndefendant to demonstrate that the mitigating factors\nwere so substantial to call for leniency.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You had to prove, beyond a\nreasonable doubt, the mitigating factors do not\noutweigh the aggravating factors that have already been\nestablished.\nMR. KLINE: That is correct. And that is\nfound in instruction number 10. And as we go through\nthis process, you see that the Kansas death-penalty law\nhas a default to life in virtually every stage of the\nprosecution of the case. And then, instruction number\n10 is a determination by the legislature consistent\nwith this Court's precedent, because we have narrowed\nthe class of defendants who are eligible for death,\nconsistent with Furman and the concern for guided\ndiscretion. And then, we have allowed the introduction\nand consideration of all mitigating evidence. The\njuror is then told how to give the effect that they\ndesire, after the reasoned moral decision, to that\nmitigating evidence. As defense counsel for Mr. Marsh,\nin the transcript of the sentencing phase, on page 66,\nvolume 4 -- it is not in your joint appendix, but it is\npart of the record before the Court -- stated to the\njury in closing, \"The practical fact is that each of\nyou will decide whether or not you believe death is the\nappropriate sentence. And if you decide that death is\nnot the appropriate sentence, you have decided that the\nmitigators outweigh the aggravators.\"\nWhat instruction number 10, which is before\nyou today, which states that the State must prove\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that the mitigators do not\noutweigh the aggravating factors, is, is guidance to\nthe jury on how they can give the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I just ask --\nMR. KLINE: -- effect --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- this question and kind\nof cut through -- is it a correct interpretation of the\ninstructions, as a whole, to say, in effect, \"If you\nfind the aggravating and mitigating circumstances are\nequally balanced, you shall impose the death sentence\"?\nMR. KLINE: If a juror finds -- that is\ncorrect, Justice Stevens -- if the juror's decided\nconclusion and reasoned moral judgment is that the\nmitigating factors and the aggravating factors are in\nbalance, and finds that beyond a reasonable doubt,\ninstruction number 10 clearly indicates that death is\nthe appropriate sentence. So, it --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The difficulty I have is in\nthe phrase that you have mentioned in the course of\nyour argument a couple of times referring to the\n\"reasoned moral response.\" And the difficulty I have\nin squaring \"reasoned moral response\" with the\nconstruction that the Kansas Court and we all agree is\nthe proper construction of the -- of the -- of the\nequipoise kind of provision, is this. Kansas has a\nright, as I understand it, to define what it regards as\nthe aggravating circumstances, those that support a\ndeath verdict. And Kansas has done so. Kansas is also\nsaying that if a jury cannot find that the aggravators,\nas we've defined them, outweigh the mitigators -- i.e.,\nif the jury is in equipoise -- the result must be\ndeath, anyway. And that does not seem to be a reasoned\nmoral response. I'm assuming that a reasoned moral\nresponse would be: the death penalty should be imposed\nbecause the aggravators do outweigh -- i.e., it's not\nequipoise -- the aggravators are heavier. And because\nKansas is saying, \"Even though they're not, death is\nthe result, anyway,\" it doesn't seem like a reasoned\nmoral response. What is your answer to that?\nMR. KLINE: Justice Souter, of course the\nState believes that it is. It is, first of all,\nconsistent with this Court's precedent as what is\nrequired --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that's the issue.\nMR. KLINE: And in the -- in the Walton case,\nthis Court found that a functionally identical\nprovision in Arizona, even though the burden remained\non the defendant, was appropriate after the State had\nmet the requirements of guided discretion, as well as\nthe individualized sentencing requirement, in setting\nabout a -- proving that, \"This defendant is more\ndeserving of death than anybody else convicted of the\nsame crime.\"\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But here we have, it seems\nto me, to be a stark finding that it has not been\nproven. That is what \"equipoise\" means. If\naggravators are the basis for a death sentence, the\nequipoise finding is, \"Aggravators don't predominate.\nWe cannot make that conclusion. We're right on the\nfence.\" And it seems to me that to call that a\nreasoned moral response -- \"We're on the fence, but\nexecute anyway\" -- seems a total inconsistency.\nMR. KLINE: The State maintains, Justice\nSouter, that the decision that the mitigating factors\ndo not outweigh the aggravating factors is a decision,\nand it is a --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But it's a decision that\nsays, \"We don't know what should be done.\" If\naggravators define the basis for execution, and\nmitigators define the basis for life, the equipoise\nverdict says, in so many words, \"We don't know which is\nmore important.\" And Kansas says, when the jury comes\nback and says, \"We don't know,\" that the result should\nbe death. And that is what seems to me inconsistent\nwith the notion of a reasoned moral response.\nMR. KLINE: The distinction, Justice Souter,\nthat I believe, from your analogy, is that the Kansas\nLegislature has said they do know, and that death is\nappropriate once a defendant has been found guilty of\ncapital murder, in a very narrow definition. And then,\nonce the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me it sounds\ndifferent if you put it differently. Surely, it's a\nreasoned moral response to say, \"We have found these\nhorrible aggravating factors in this murder. It's not\neven your usual murder. There are these terrible\naggravating factors. Three of them, we found. And we\nfurther find that there is no mitigating evidence to\noutweigh those aggravating factors.\" That seems to me\na perfectly valid moral response.\nMR. KLINE: That is correct, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But that is not our case, is\nit? Because our case is not, \"We don't find that the\nmitigators outweigh.\" Our case is, \"We find the\nmitigators are of equal weight.\" That's why you get to\nequipoise. It's not a question of the failure of\nmitigators to predominate.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It is the sufficiency of\nmitigators to equal in weight. And that's what poses\nthe problem, it seems to me.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But it seems to me that to\nbe equal in weight is not to predominate. And that's\nall the jury is saying --\nMR. KLINE: I would agree, Justice Scalia --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- if there's nothing to\noutweigh the aggravating factors.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Of course it is not to\npredominate, but it is something more precise than\nmerely not predominating. It is a fact, in effect,\nthat you don't know, if all you know is that they don't\npredominate. The fact that you know, here, is that\nthey equal, and --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do we know that as a\nfact?\nMR. KLINE: Justice Roberts, I believe that\nthere are a couple of things which might help\nilluminate a little bit more what the jury faces in\nthis instance. First of all, the statement --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do we have a return\nof a verdict saying, \"We find these factors in\nequipoise\"?\nMR. KLINE: There is a verdict form that\nrequires the jury, with unanimity, if the sentence is\ndeath, to indicate that the State has met the burden\nbeyond a reasonable doubt of demonstrating --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, what we have is a\nsituation where this is a theoretical possibility under\nthe statute.\nMR. KLINE: Correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not a situation where\nthis is what the jury has said.\nMR. KLINE: The jury does not find in that\nfashion.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's right. We don't --\nwe don't know whether that was the case here or not.\nMR. KLINE: How --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: As I understand it, our\nquestion is, if a jury could return the death verdict\nin the equipoise situation, as the Kansas Supreme Court\nhas defined it, is that -- is that statute allowing for\nthat possibility constitutional? Isn't that --\nMR. KLINE: That is the issue, just --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nMR. KLINE: -- as it was in Walton, which had\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nMR. KLINE: -- a functionally identical\nprovision that required that the defendant demonstrate\nthat there were mitigating factors substantial enough\nto call for leniency, which --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We're not talking,\njust -- we're not talking about a numerical equipoise.\nI -- there's three aggravators and three mitigators,\nin equipoise. And the -- presumably, the individual\njurors can give what weight they think is appropriate\nto the mitigating factors. They can find all three\naggravators met, and say, \"Well, I still think, under\nfactor 18, that mercy ought to outweigh death.\"\nMR. KLINE: That is correct, Justice Roberts.\nAnd, in fact, they are informed that it is not a\nnumerical equation.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But is it -- is it like in\na -- in a -- take a civil case where the judge gives\nthe standard charge about, \"Imagine two plates and a\nscale, and if they are in equipoise, then you find\nagainst the party who has the burden of proof\" -- if we\nmake that comparison, then it's pretty clear that the\nburden of proof is on the defendant if the answer is --\nto the equipoise question is, \"Then you must come in\nwith a death verdict.\"\nMR. KLINE: Justice Ginsburg, unlike in\nArizona, there is a specific instruction to the jury\nthat they must decide beyond a reasonable doubt that\nthe mitigating factors do not outweigh the aggravating\nfactors before the death sentence is imposed. And it\nis analogous to instructing the jury on how to give the\neffect they desire to the mitigating and aggravating\nfactors that have been presented. I would possibly\nagree that we would have a constitutional issue if it\nwas similar to instructing a jury, \"You either mark\nblue or red on the jury verdict form, and we will not\ntell you the effect of that decision.\" However, this\ninstruction clearly lets them know that a decision\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that the State has met its\nburden, that the mitigators do not outweigh the\naggravating factors, that the effect is death. And --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Is there a difference in the\nmoral burden on the jurors, or the psychological burden\non the jurors, in the situation where they have to find\nthat the aggravators outweigh the mitigators, and,\ntherefore, make an affirmative finding that leads to\nthe sentence of death, as opposed to the situation\nwhere they can say, \"We can't decide, under the\napplicable burden of proof, which side is weightier,\"\nand, therefore, they allow a default rule to dictate\nwhat the sentence is going to be?\nMR. KLINE: Justice Alito, I do not believe\nthat that is what occurs, because, indecision, under\nKansas law, is clearly indicative of a life sentence.\nIn fact, if the jury does not, with unanimity, come\ntogether and make an affirmative decision, and indicate\nsuch on the verdict form within a reasonable time, they\nare told and instructed, \"the judge shall dismiss the\njury.\" And the State's --\nJUSTICE ALITO: No, but if they find -- if\nthey agree, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the\naggravators and the mitigators are in equipoise, then\nthey allow the default rule to dictate the sentence of\ndeath. Isn't that right?\nMR. KLINE: That is correct, at some point.\nI wouldn't term it a \"default rule\" in every statutory\nscheme involving the death penalty. There is a point\nin time when the jury is informed that the result of\ntheir deliberations is a death sentence. So, you can\ncall something a default rule in virtually any State.\nAnd, in fact, relying on the Walton decision, many\nStates have functionally identical statutes to Kansas,\nand courts have interpreted the Walton decision as\nresolving this issue. In Adamson v. Lewis, the Ninth\nCircuit said that the issue of the potential, the\nhypothetical, of equipoise was resolved in Walton.\nFurthermore, the Idaho -- the Seventh Circuit, relating\nto the Idaho scheme relating to the death penalty,\nfound that this Court resolved the issue in Walton, as\ndid the Illinois Court. So, there have been several\nfindings based on Walton. And, in fact, the Kansas\nLegislature enacted this death penalty statute soon\nafter Walton --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: General Kline, can I ask\nyou this question? Supposing the law was that you're\nsupposed to be instructed that, \"Unless the mitigating\nfactors substantially outweigh the aggravating factors,\nthe sentence shall be death.\" Would that be\npermissible?\nMR. KLINE: Justice Stevens, as you're aware,\nthat's the Blackmun dissent in Walton, in the\nhypothetical that he posed with his concern about\nWalton. I believe that there could come a point in\ntime, based on the instruction, that the jury was not\nable to give full effect to the mitigating evidence\nthat they desired.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, what about my\nhypothetical?\nMR. KLINE: That's -- that there -- it would\napproach a time, possibly, where --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Would it --\nMR. KLINE: -- this Court would find --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Would it be constitutional\nor unconstitutional?\nMR. KLINE: This Court, under --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: In your view.\nMR. KLINE: On my view? It would approach a\nproblem with this Court's --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I know it approaches the\nproblem. I'm wondering if it gets there.\n[Laughter.]\nMR. KLINE: I'd defer to the wisdom of this\nCourt.\n[Laughter.]\nJUSTICE BREYER: Leaving law out of it, which I'd\nlike to do, just for the sake of argument, imagine\nyou're a juror, and this is a totally contrived\nsituation, which I think we're deciding -- I don't know\nif there's ever been such a situation -- but you're a\njuror, and you're told the following by a fellow juror,\n\"The reason that we have these aggravating\ncircumstances, which are hard to understand here, is,\nwe want to be sure this fellow is, morally speaking,\nsomewhat more deserving of death, than the average.\"\nAnd then he says, \"And the reason that we\nhave these mitigating circumstances here is because\nevery one of them means that he's somewhat less moral --\nhe's not as morally undeserving, cuts the other way, it\nreduces -- it makes him less deserving of death,\nmorally speaking.\"\nNow, you're the juror, how do you feel about\nthis?\"\nAnd you say, \"They're absolutely in balance,\nabsolutely in balance. For every fact here on the\naggravating side that puts me thinking, morally\nspeaking, he's more deserving of death, there is a\nmitigating factor which makes me think, morally\nspeaking, he's less deserving of death. So, I'm in\nperfect balance.\"\nAnd your fellow juror says, \"Now, will you\nplease give me, then, one moral reason why he should be\nexecuted?\"\nAnd what's your answer?\nMR. KLINE: My answer would be that the law\nclearly provides that if that is the finding --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, but if the law says,\n\"You have to be able to give, morally speaking, reason\n-- you have to reason your way towards the moral\nconclusion that he's deserving of death\" -- that's why\nI tried to take the law out of it. I don't want you to\nbe a lawyer. I want you to be a juror. And I want you\nto give a moral reason --\nMR. KLINE: The moral reason would be --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- why, when this is in\nequipoise, he is more deserving of death than the\naverage.\nMR. KLINE: Justice Breyer, I would say that\nthe moral reason is, \"I know the effect of that\ndeliberation, and I know that, if I make that finding,\nthat the death sentence will be warranted.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, and of course --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- the jury doesn't have a\nfree-falling moral judgment to make. It accepts the\njudgment of the majority of the people in Kansas that\ncertain aggravators, and only those aggravators, shall\nbe counted against the defendant --\nMR. KLINE: And --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- and that all of them\nshall be -- even if the juror himself does not believe,\nmorally, that this particular aggravator ought to be\nthere. So, it's not as though our law says that\nsomehow the jury has to -- each juror has to be able to\nmake, like Solomon, his own moral judgment on this\nfellow. And one of the things that the -- that the\nKansas law prescribes is that when they're in\nequipoise, the people of Kansas think that the\naggravators that they have specified are serious enough\nthat unless there is something to overcome them, the\ndeath penalty is appropriate. That seems to me a moral\njudgment within the limited range of moral judgment\nthat the jury is accorded.\nMR. KLINE: That is correct, Justice Scalia.\nAnd the concern about unfettered moral judgment of a\njury calls into question the original purpose for\nFurman. And so, there is guided discretion --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course, they have\nunfettered discretion with respect to the mitigating\nfactors, don't they? Under --\nMR. KLINE: That is correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- under factor 18,\nany other circumstance which they find serves as a\nbasis for a sentence other than death.\nMR. KLINE: That is correct, Justice --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And I take it --\nMR. KLINE: -- Mr. Chief Justice.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- the moral answer is\nalso, \"He stands before us with the scales already\ntipped. He stands before us having been shown, beyond\na reasonable doubt, to have committed aggravated\nmurder. He has the obligation to show us why he should\nbe excused from that penalty. He has not done so. We\ncan take anything that he came -- brought to our\nattention, and we can say that this outweighs.\" It\ndoes not.\nMR. KLINE: And, Justice Kennedy, that is the\ndecision in the holding in Walton. And --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is that the law in Kansas?\nI mean, I thought -- correct me if I'm wrong, because I\nmay have made a wrong assumption here -- I thought the\nfinding of guilt to an aggravated murder is the preface\nto a determination as to whether aggravators or\nmitigators predominate. And, based upon that\ndetermination, there will be a decision as to whether\nthe sentence should be death or life.\nMR. KLINE: The first determination that a\njury engages in is whether the defendant has been\nproven, beyond a reasonable doubt, guilty of capital\nmurder --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Right.\nMR. KLINE: -- which is defined in a very\nnarrow statute. Kansas --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And, at that point, we don't\nhave any way of knowing, I take it, whether the penalty\nshould be life or death.\nMR. KLINE: Then we have -- you're correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. KLINE: And then we have a separate\nsentencing phase in which the State first bears the\nburden of demonstrating one -- eight -- of eight\naggravating factors is present. And that burden is\nbeyond a reasonable doubt --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But --\nMR. KLINE: -- with jury unanimity.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But --\nMR. KLINE: And --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- what I'm -- what I'm --\nwhat I'm getting at is, I don't -- I -- as I understand\nthe Kansas scheme, the determination of guilt, to\naggravated murder, does not create a presumption in\nfavor of the death penalty.\nMR. KLINE: No, the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. KLINE: -- that is correct. That is\ncorrect. There are several steps.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It depends on what you mean\nby a \"presumption.\" It certainly -- it certainly says\nthat unless you find something that outweighs this, the\ndeath penalty is the proper penalty.\nMR. KLINE: Justice Scalia --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The burden is on the jury to\nfind something to outweigh it. And, in the absence of\na finding of something that outweighs it, when these\naggravators are found, the death penalty is the proper\npenalty.\nMR. KLINE: Justice Scalia, that is correct.\nOnce the State has met the burden of proving that one\nof the eight statutory aggravators is present --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Right. But the fact of --\nlet me -- I think we've got a terminological problem --\nthe fact that there has been a finding of guilt of\naggravated murder is not tantamount, as I understand\nit, to a finding that aggravating factors to be\nconsidered at the penalty phase have also been found.\nIs that --\nMR. KLINE: That is --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- correct?\nMR. KLINE: -- correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. KLINE: There is a separate burden there\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. KLINE: -- Justice Souter. And as it\nrelates to the \"give effect\" language, the cases that\nthis Court has considered regarding that are\ndramatically different. In those cases, such as the\nPenry cases and other cases, the concern was, the jury\nwas affirmatively instructed that they could not use\nevidence that was introduced and relevant in a manner\nwhich would lead to mitigation, such as the defendant's\nyouthfulness. And the special instruction in Texas\nsaid that they could only utilize that evidence to\ndetermine whether there was a likelihood of re-offense.\nAnd this Court reasoned that it is possible to look at\nyouthfulness as mitigating factor which diminishes the\nmoral culpability of the defendant. There is no claim\nin this case that the jurors were unable to take the\nmitigating evidence and give it whatever effect they\ndesired in mitigation. In fact, they are instructed\nthat they must individually consider all such evidence.\nAnd then they are instructed to make their decision\nbased upon what effect that they would give it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can --\nMR. KLINE: So --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can I ask you a question\nthat goes to your response to Justice Souter's last\nquestion? As I understand the scheme, maybe my\nunderstanding is wrong, once they have found the\nexistence of those aggravating factors that justify the\ndeath penalty, and then you move into the penalty phase\nfor them to decide whether, in fact, the death penalty\nwould be imposed, it's not up to them to -- they can't\neliminate one of those aggravating factors that has\nbeen found. They have to take into account all of the\naggravating factors that have been found. Isn't that\nright?\nMR. KLINE: That's correct, Justice Scalia.\nI think the confusion is the use of the term\n\"aggravated murder,\" which would be not quite correct\nunder Kansas law. There is a statutory requirement of\na finding of guilt of capital murder, and that is in\nvery narrow circumstances. Kansas has one of the most\nnarrow death penalties in the Nation. Then once that\nguilt is determined, we then move to the phase where\nthe State must prove an aggravating factor in addition\nto having proved that the defendant is guilty of\ncapital murder.\nOnce that is achieved, then the\njurors are instructed to give way to a consideration to\nall aggravating factors that they find, with unanimity,\nto exist, and to consider all mitigating evidence which\nthey find, individually, to exist, with the only burden\non the defendant being relevancy for introduction. And\nthen, they are instructed to consider whether the State\nhas proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the\nmitigating factors do not outweigh the aggravating\nfactors.\nAnd, Mr. Chief Justice, if it may please the\nCourt, I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General\nKline.\nMs. Woodman.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF REBECCA E. WOODMAN\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT\nMS. WOODMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nSince the argument of the attorney general\nwas addressed exclusively to the question of the\nconstitutionality of the Kansas statute, I will devote\nall of my argument to that subject, as well, although I\nam sure that the Court, in deliberations, will be\nconsidering the several jurisdictional issues which\nwere briefed and argued earlier in the term. And if\nthere are no questions on those jurisdictional issues,\nI will proceed to the merits.\nTo pick up on some of the things that were\nsaid during Attorney General Kline's argument, the\nEighth Amendment requires reliability in the\ndetermination that death is an appropriate sentence.\nAnd at the selection stage, the question is whether the\njury has made a reliable, collective, responsible\ndecision based upon the unique circumstances of the\nindividual defendant that death is an appropriate\nsentence and that this defendant is particularly\nculpable in a way that distinguishes him from the mass\nof death-eligible defendants. And the problem with the\nequipoise provision here, which the State agrees can\noccur under the Kansas statute, is that we don't know\nfrom a death verdict pronounced by a jury in Kansas\nwhether the jury did decree death by equipoise or not.\nDeath sentences must be rationally reviewable. And\nwhen we look at the -- at a death sentence that's been\npronounced in Kansas, we can't determine whether the\njury decreed death by equipoise.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: We are confident that the\njury found aggravating factors. We know that.\nMS. WOODMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And we know --\nMS. WOODMAN: Yes, and I agree --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- that they found them\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\nMS. WOODMAN: Yes. The jury did find an\naggravating factor beyond --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And we know --\nMS. WOODMAN: -- a reasonable --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- we --\nMS. WOODMAN: -- doubt.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- and we know that they\nfound that the defendant had not shown that mitigating\nfactors outweighed those aggravating factors.\nMS. WOODMAN: That's right. But the Kansas\nSupreme Court, in the Kleypas case, examined the Kansas\nstatute -- which, by the way, is unique to Kansas; no\nother State in the country has a statute like this, and\nthis will affect no State outside of Kansas -- they\nexamined this statute in great detail, and they --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You disagree from your --\nwith your friend on the other side on that point.\nMS. WOODMAN: Whether it's unique?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How can we check on that?\nNo, he said that a number of other State statutes would\nbe affected by our coming out the way you would like\nus, on this.\nMS. WOODMAN: I don't see how, because --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Because he said --\nMS. WOODMAN: -- Kansas --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- he said it would change\nWalton, and that would impair those other State\nstatutes.\nMS. WOODMAN: As we argue in our brief,\nWalton simply did not speak to this --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMS. WOODMAN: -- issue. And, in fact, the\nArizona Supreme Court, in Walton, interpreted the\nArizona statute to require that aggravators outweigh\nmitigators.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't mean to\ninterrupt your argument, but presumably the attorney\ngeneral will tell us, in his rebuttal.\nMS. WOODMAN: Sure. And the Montana statute,\nwhich reads precisely the way Arizona's is, they've\ndecided the equipoise issue and said that the language\nof that statute does not mandate death by equipoise.\nSo, those statutes are distinguishable, and there's\nsimply no other State that has a statute which mandates\ndeath by equipoise.\nIn any event, the Kansas Supreme Court did\ninterpret the statute to contain a mandatory death-by-\nequipoise provision, which the State's question\npresented assumes is the case. And the court, familiar\nwith the way the statute has operated, and is likely to\noperate it in Kansas, found that equipoise can happen,\nand that it risks unreliability in capital sentencing\nin a way that's forbidden by the Eighth Amendment. And\nI think one of the problems here is that the\nterminology of \"weighing\" conveys a false impression of\npredefined weights. And the attorney general conceded\nthat that's not how juries consider the balancing of\naggravating and mitigating circumstances. And we agree\nwith that. And that's why it is wrong to view this as\nprincipally a burden-of-proof issue. It's not. The\nissue, at the selection stage -- the State certainly\nhas the burden to prove an aggravating circumstance\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, but, at the selection stage,\nthe issue is not meeting some particular burden of\nproof, it's whether the jury has made a reliable,\nresponsible, collective decision that this unique\ndefendant deserves the death penalty that distinguishes\nhim --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me that --\nMS. WOODMAN: -- from other death-eligible --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- that that --\nMS. WOODMAN: -- defendants.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- that that hurts you\nsomewhat. If you want to give us this visual metaphor\nof a scale, or a football field, where you move it\nbeyond the 50-yardline, whatever visual metaphor you\nwant, and you weigh, you balance where the scales of\njustice balances, it seems to me that that's a stronger\ncase than saying the jurors can establish their\naggravation, then they can take any mitigating factor\nthey want, for any reason, and apply it. And they\ncan't do that, because the defendant hasn't shown it.\nIt seems to me that that's -- that that's a weaker\nargument than if you had this balancing mechanism that\nwas our controlling metaphor.\nMS. WOODMAN: Well, let's look at the way\nthat equipoise can happen under the Kansas statute --\nand I think Justice Alito alluded to it -- that if the\njurors can't decide between aggravated and mitigating\ncircumstances, the sentence is death. The statute\ndecrees death, and --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: They've already decided\naggravating circumstances, you can't say they can't decide it.\nThey've already decided aggravating circumstances.\nMS. WOODMAN: They've decided --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And what they're deciding\nis that there's no mitigating circumstances to outweigh\nit.\nMS. WOODMAN: What they've decided is that,\nin looking at aggravating and mitigating circumstances\ntogether, they can't determine, one way or the other,\nwhether aggravators outweigh mitigators or mitigators --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But --\nMS. WOODMAN: -- outweigh aggravators.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But how realistic is\nthat as a possibility when you're talking about\nabstract concepts as mitigating factors, like how much\nmercy should be shown? I mean, do you really think\nthere's any juror who's going to say, \"All right, I'm\ngiving -- I've found the aggravating circumstance that\nhe killed two people, and I've found the aggravating\ncircumstance that it was particularly heinous to slash\nthe throat and leave the toddler to burn. But I also\nthink that mercy ought to be shown. But, you know, it\njust happens to come up to exactly the level of the\naggravating circumstances. So, I'm stuck. I don't\nknow what to do.\" I don't think that's the way jurors\nwould react. They either think that the need to show\nmercy or, the one before that, that he's a talented\nartist, outweighs the fact of the aggravating\ncircumstances, or it doesn't. I just think it's an\nunrealistic supposition. And there's nothing in the\nstatute -- they don't get an equipoise instruction.\nSo, how -- I mean, is there any reason to think that\njurors do come to that balance between such inchoate\nconcepts in the first place?\nMS. WOODMAN: Yes. I think it can occur in\nclose cases. And, after all, those are the only cases\nwhere equipoise would even be relevant. And let me\ngive you an example. Suppose there's a woman who wants\nto donate a million dollars to Yale Law School, and, as\npart of that donation, she's going to -- she has --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is that an aggravating\ncircumstance?\n[Laughter.]\nMS. WOODMAN: Well, bear with me for a\nminute, Your Honor. She has to choose a portrait of\nher beloved husband to hang in the law school. These\nportraits were taken at different times, they have\ndifferent qualities, different features. And she has\nto choose one. And this decision proves\nextraordinarily difficult for her to make. And she\ncompares the relative qualities of the two portraits.\nThey're both good. She loved her husband. And she\nsimply cannot choose between the two. And so, she does\none of two things. One is that she just can't bear to\ndebate with herself anymore about which one is the\nbetter-quality portrait; and so, she becomes agnostic\nabout it and says, \"I give up. Pick one.\" And so, she\npicks one. The other is that the decision is simply\ntoo difficult for her to make; and so, she abdicates\nthat decision and says, \"Let the dean pick.\"\nAnd you can analogize that to the ways in\nwhich this statute can operate. And the jury can\narrive at equipoise by becoming agnostic about the\ndecision on whether -- on the balance between\naggravating/mitigating --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think your --\nMS. WOODMAN: -- circumstances.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think your analogy\ntook away what I would have regarded as the basis for\nmy question. I think it may well be true that people\nhave difficulty deciding between two portraits. I'm\nnot sure people come to the sense that someone who's\nguilty of allowing a 19-month-old to burn to death and\nslashing the throat of her mother thinks it's equally\nbalanced when they're inclined to show mercy, for\nwhatever reason. It seems to me they either make a\ndetermination that the circumstances of his upbringing,\nemotional instability outweigh the responsibility for\nwhat they had found to be aggravating factors, or they\ndetermine that the aggravating factors outweigh the\nfact that they may show mercy for other basis. I just\n-- I can see thinking two portraits are\nindistinguishable. I just don't see a juror\nfunctioning and saying, \"I just can't decide whether to\nshow mercy or to convict for death.\" And they're\nequally balanced. I understand the idea they may\ndebate it with the other jurors, but, to come and say,\n\"You know, I just can't decide,\" it seems to me that\nthe -- particularly since they can put as much weight\ninto the mitigating factors as they want -- they can\nsay, \"I want to show a lot of mercy,\" they can say, \"I\nwant to show a little bit of mercy\" -- but to say that,\n\"I want to show just enough mercy that is exactly\nbalanced,\" I don't understand that.\nMS. WOODMAN: Well, you see, individual\njurors, in the course of deliberations -- this is a\nqualitative judgment, after all, and individual jurors,\nin the course of deliberations, might be leaning one\nway or the other at different times during\ndeliberations. But what this equipoise provision does\nis that it allows the jurors to compromise on equipoise\nwhen they simply cannot deliberate anymore, or if they\nsimply just want to avoid making the hard decision.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Would it be constitutional if\nthe Kansas statute said that, \"The jury must find, by a\npreponderance, that the aggravating factors outweigh\nthe mitigating factors\"?\nMS. WOODMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And wouldn't a defendant be\nbetter off under the current Kansas statute than under\na statute like that, where, under the current statute,\nthe jury has to find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that\nthe aggravating factors and the mitigating factors are\nat least in equipoise?\nMS. WOODMAN: Well, the jury does have to\nfind equipoise beyond a reasonable doubt. But the fact\nremains that the jury is making that decision of\nequipoise, which requires the death sentence, without\nhaving made the individualized sentencing determination\nrequired at the selection stage under the Eighth\nAmendment. And that's the problem with the equipoise\nprovision, because it allows the jury to avoid making\nthat decision, which is --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, I mean --\nMS. WOODMAN: -- required.\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- suppose the jury thinks\nthat the aggravating factors outweigh the mitigating\nfactors 51-49. Now, under the first statute that I\nhypothesized, that would result in a verdict of death,\nwould it not? What would the result be under the --\nunder the current Kansas statute, where the aggravators\nhave to be shown, beyond a reasonable doubt, to\noutweigh the mitigators?\nMS. WOODMAN: Well, I think if the statute\nrequires that the aggravators outweigh mitigators, this\nCourt has upheld that formula. That is a decision that\nthe jury has made. And the legislature can make that\ndecision. And so, when you look -- that's why I'm\ntrying to -- I mean, the State agrees that this is not\na quantitative determination. And I will grant you, if\nthe jury is -- if it were a quantitative determination,\nwhich is totally unrealistic, and we agree with the\nState's reasoning on that -- then if the jury is\nprecisely exactly equivalent, 50-50, on aggravating and\nmitigating circumstances, that might be said to\nconstitute a decision. But, as even the State argues,\nthat's not how jury deliberations work. And under this\nequipoise provision, the jury can decree death without\nhaving made the individualized sentencing decision\nrequired at the selection stage. And it's because, on\nthe one hand, if the decision is too close to call, the\nequipoise provision allows the jurors to simply give up\nand settle on equipoise as a group. This is a group\ndecision, after all. They have to be unanimous on the\nquestion of whether aggravators --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you --\nMS. WOODMAN: -- are not --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- this question?\nMS. WOODMAN: -- outweighed by mitigators.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Suppose the jurors are\ndeadlocked, six to six, and you're not -- you don't\nknow, maybe some are a little stronger there, but\nthere's a deadlock. And what if the judge told them,\n\"Well, in the event of a deadlock, you resolve it by\nflipping a coin.\" Would that be constitutional?\nMS. WOODMAN: Absolutely not, because they're\nnot making the decision that's required at the\nselection stage.\nAnd to follow up on something that General\nKline said during his argument, that the provision is\nfor a hung jury, there's no provision for a hung jury\nin the event the jury finds itself in equipoise. The\nonly provision for a hung jury, under the Kansas\nstatute, is if the jury is unable to reach a verdict.\nBut equipoise, does not prevent a death verdict. In\nfact, the statute requires a death verdict if the\njurors are in equipoise.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the verdict that\nthe jury returns is a verdict of death. They do not\nreturn a verdict saying, \"We're in equipoise,\" and then\nthe death sentence is imposed by operation of law. The\nverdict imposed is, \"We do not find -- we find these\naggravating circumstances. We find they're not\noutweighed. And, therefore, we sentence the defendant\nto death.\"\nMS. WOODMAN: Well, a determination of\nequipoise -- the jury has to find equipoise beyond a\nreasonable doubt, and that, necessarily, means that the\naggravators are not outweighed my mitigators.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, but --\nMS. WOODMAN: That's how this statute was\ninterpreted by the Kansas Supreme Court.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but I think -- I think\nthe Chief Justice's point is that you're -- you're\nreally not being accurate when you say, \"The jurors can\nthereby avoid the difficult choice.\" They don't avoid\nthe difficult choice. They're fully aware, under this\nstatutory scheme, that if they don't find that the\nmitigators outweigh, they are condemning this person to\ndeath. That's the moral choice they're faced with.\nAnd when they come in with that verdict, they know what\nthey're doing. And I consider that a moral -- a moral\njudgment on their part.\nMS. WOODMAN: Well, the jury certainly knows\nthat they are imposing a death sentence. But what this\ninstruction and the prosecutorial arguments given in\nthe cases tell them is that they can fulfill their\nresponsibilities as jurors without coming to a final\njudgment about whether aggravators outweigh mitigators,\nor vice versa.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you think that a juror\nwho believes that this person shouldn't be -- shouldn't\nbe sent to death -- that is to say, who believes that\nthe mitigators outweigh the aggravators -- would join a\njury verdict which produces the result that he's\nsentenced to death, right? I think that is so unlikely\n--\nMS. WOODMAN: But in --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that he's going to say,\n\"Well, I -- you know, I think he shouldn't go to death,\nbut the aggravators and mitigators are absolutely\nevenly balanced, so I guess I've got to send him to\ndeath,\" I don't think any juror's going to do that.\nMS. WOODMAN: But the fact that this is a\ngroup decision leads to even a greater risk of\nabdication of --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It takes only one --\nMS. WOODMAN: -- that decision.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It takes only one to\ndisagree.\nMS. WOODMAN: But it's a group decision, and\njurors are encouraged and forced to compromise to come\nto a verdict. And in close cases, with jurors leaning\nslightly one way or another, they, being forced to come\nto a consensus, are even more likely to compromise on\nequipoise, rather than engage in the draining task of\npersuading each person leaning one way or the other to\ncome together.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But regardless of the\nlikelihood of that situation in any given case -- and I\nhappen to agree with Justice Scalia; I mean, I don't\nthink the likelihood of that in a given case is great --\nwe're, nonetheless, I think, faced with the fact that\nthe Supreme Court of Kansas says, \"That can happen.\"\nMS. WOODMAN: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: \"And if it does happen, the\nresult is death.\" And I think we've --\nMS. WOODMAN: That's right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- we've got to take that as\na given. I mean --\nMS. WOODMAN: That's right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- do you see any way out of\nit? I --\nMS. WOODMAN: That's right. This Court is\nbound by the Kansas Supreme Court's interpretation of\nthe statute. And what's happening here is, when the\njurors do settle on equipoise, in whatever way they\nsettle on equipoise, the fact of the matter that -- is\nthat in either of -- either of the two cases I've --\nwell, either in -- in three cases I've described, the\njurors are following their instructions, and, in either\nof these situations, the defendant is being sentenced\nto death only as a death-eligible defendant, because\nthat's the only constitutionally required decision\nthat's actually been made by the jury in that\nsituation. And to go back to Justice Breyer's\nhypothetical about the box from the last argument, the\nlegislature has determined that the individuals will be\nseparated out as a result of equipoise, but there is\nnothing about that situation, them being in that box,\nthat separates them from any other generic death-\neligible defendant. And that's the problem with this\nequipoise provision. And, yes, the Kansas Supreme\nCourt found that it can happen. This Court is bound by\nthat interpretation. The State concedes that. And,\ntherefore --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You mentioned the --\nMS. WOODMAN: The --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- Kansas Legislature. Has\nthere been any suggestion the statute ought to be\namended to get rid of this silly little problem?\nMS. WOODMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I don't mean to call it --\nMS. WOODMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- silly little problem,\nbut --\nMS. WOODMAN: Yes, and I think --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- the very narrow --\nMS. WOODMAN: -- the Legislature is going to\ntake that up again. And there's simply no consequence\nto anyone else by affirming the Kansas Supreme Court's\ndecision in this case. The Legislature is going to\ntake the matter up again. There's no question about\nthat.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is there --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, how is it --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- anything --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- how is it -- is\nthere any question about how it's going to come out\nwhen they take it up again?\n[Laughter.]\nMS. WOODMAN: Well, I wouldn't want to\nspeculate on that. There are going to be arguments on\nboth sides, certainly.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What if they still conclude,\nas they did before, that when these aggravating factors\nare found, unless there is mitigation to overcome them,\nit is the judgment of the people of Kansas that this\nperson is deserving of death? What if they come to\nthat conclusion again? You want us to tell them, \"No,\nthe people of Kansas cannot come to that, what seems to\nme, quite rational decision\"?\nMS. WOODMAN: Well, but there is no moral\njudgment, as has been stated here. There's no moral\njudgment. The State can -- the Legislature can\ndetermine that death is an appropriate sentence. The\nLegislature -- this Court upheld a legislative\ndetermination, when aggravators outweigh mitigators, in\nBlystone, that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's so silly to say that\nKansas can circumscribe the moral judgment of the -- of\nthe jury by saying, \"You can take into account 18\naggravators, or else only two aggravators.\" That is a\n-- you know, a significant control on their moral\njudgment. But then to say that Kansas cannot\ncircumscribe their moral judgment to the very limited\ndegree of saying, \"Unless you find that the mitigators\noutweigh the aggravators, the proper response is the\ndeath penalty.\"\nMS. WOODMAN: But you cannot divorce the\nweighing process enacted by the legislature from the\nindividualized sentencing decision required under the\nEighth Amendment at the selection stage. And the\nequipoise --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But I --\nMS. WOODMAN: -- provision.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If I -- if I may interrupt\nyou, I -- your point, I take it, is, the jurors have\ngot to make this decision, not the Legislature of\nKansas.\nMS. WOODMAN: That's right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMS. WOODMAN: And if the Legislature --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But haven't the jurors made\nthe decision that, \"We have looked at all of the moral\narguments that he has presented. Each of one of the --\nof us has individually weighed them. Each one of us\nknow that if we have any moral reason not to impose the\ndeath penalty, we can do it. And we make the moral\njudgment that we cannot make that determination.\"\nMS. WOODMAN: But the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Moral judgment, from\nbeginning to end.\nMS. WOODMAN: This statute allows a third\noption of equipoise, which allows a jury to impose\ndeath without making that judgment.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay, well, what do you say\nto --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, but that's -- your term\nis \"equipoise.\" You say the jury has done nothing --\nMS. WOODMAN: The Kansas Supreme Court's --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- you say the jury has\ndone nothing. What the jury has done is, it's weighed\nall the evidence with great care, and it's said that,\n\"Beyond a reasonable doubt, the mitigating\ncircumstances do not overcome.\" That is a moral\njudgment.\nMS. WOODMAN: But the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And you label it\n\"equipoise.\"\nMS. WOODMAN: The other possibilities are\nthat the jury has found that, \"We can't decide whether\naggravators outweigh mitigators, or vice versa. And\nthe statute tells -- the instructions tell us to impose\ndeath.\"\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But I think Justice Kennedy\nis saying, when they make that determination, \"We can't\ntell whether one outweighs the other,\" that they are\nmaking a moral judgment there. And what's your --\nwhat's your answer to that?\nMS. WOODMAN: That is --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: He's saying they are making\na moral judgment.\nMS. WOODMAN: That is not a moral --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And they know what its\nconsequence is.\nMS. WOODMAN: That is not a moral judgment,\nbecause it says nothing about the personal culpability\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: In other words you're --\nMS. WOODMAN: -- of the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- saying moral --\nMS. WOODMAN: -- defendants.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- judgment has got to be an\neither/or judgment, not a \"we can't figure it out\"\njudgment.\nMS. WOODMAN: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But the difficulty, I think,\nin the case is, it's artificial. I think it is. We're\nin an artificial situation, and we're imagining those\n12 jurors saying they're in equipoise between\nmitigating and aggravating. We don't know. They --\neven. All right. Now, you could look at this as\nsaying, \"You have to have a reason for thinking these\npeople are -- this person is morally worse than the\naverage.\" And then we imagine some fungible commodity,\nlike moral badness units. And for every one we go up\non the aggravating side, we go down on the mitigating\nside, so we're back to zero. And then, some people,\nlike you, are looking at this and saying, \"See, you're\nat zero. You went up, you went down, so they're no\nworse than the average.\" But other people can look at\nit and say, \"We'll tell you about -- one thing about\nthis individual. This is an individual who did do the\naggravating things, and he has counterbalancing\nmitigating things, and that's good enough to separate\nhim out, morally speaking, from somebody who doesn't.\nNow, my problem is, you either look at it the\none way or you look at the other way, and you -- and\nI'm trying to find a reasoned -- if you -- can -- do\nyou want to add anything?\nMS. WOODMAN: Well, I mean, the Kansas\nSupreme Court determined that equipoise can happen.\nAnd in the situations that I've described, there is a\nreal risk under this statute that the jury can either\nbecome agnostic and just pick, and the statute requires\nthem to pick death, or the jury, encouraged by\nprosecutorial arguments to abdicate the decision, do\nabdicate, simply cop out and impose death, because it\nallows them to avoid making the tough choice. And I\nthink those are very real possibilities under this\nstatute. The statute requires death in those\nsituations, and it's the risk that this procedure poses\nthat presents the problem. And this Court has always\nheld that these kinds of risks of unconstitutional\nresults are intolerable in capital cases. And we\nsimply cannot look at a death sentence in Kansas and\nsay, with any reliability at all, that this jury did\nnot decree death by equipoise, that this jury made the\nreliable sentencing judgment required under the Eighth\nAmendment at the selection stage. We just can't say\nthat under this statute.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You think that under this\ninstruction, a Kansas juror could say, \"You know, I'm\nnot interested in deliberating more. I'm not going to\nparticipate\"? That's what you're want -- that's what\nyou want us to believe, right, based on this argument?\nI -- that's just -- any juror -- any jury can ignore\nits instructions. There's nothing I can do about that.\nMS. WOODMAN: Well, they're not --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Here, they are instructed\nto consider every mitigating circumstance that's\npresented and determine whether or not that should be a\nfactor in their decision.\nMS. WOODMAN: They're not -- they're not\nignoring their instructions at all. They're following\ntheir instructions if they arrive at equipoise. And\nthe instructions and the prosecutorial arguments tell\nthem to impose death. The prosecutorial --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well --\nMS. WOODMAN: -- arguments are --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but you're suggesting\nthat they kind of --\nMS. WOODMAN: -- perfectly in line.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- that they can tune out.\nMS. WOODMAN: It's not that they're tuning\nout. They take their jobs very seriously. But what\nthey are encouraged to believe by the instructions and\nthe prosecutorial arguments is that they will fulfill\ntheir responsibilities as jurors without coming to a\nfinal judgment on whether aggravators outweigh\nmitigators or vice versa. And it's the risk that they\nwill do that, that makes this statute unconstitutional.\nAnd the Kansas Supreme Court determined that there is\nsuch a risk of equipoise under this statute that it\ncannot comply with the Eighth Amendment.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms.\nWoodman.\nGeneral Kline, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PHILL KLINE\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. KLINE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nFirst, referring to Justice Scalia's question\nas it relates to other States that are affected, in the\njoint appendix, pages 98 through 107, you have a\nsummary, and, additionally, in the amici brief that was\nfiled by several States, on page 23, it identifies\nArizona, Florida, Nevada, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and\nMissouri as having similar provisions. And,\nadditionally, the cases that have relied on Walton to\ndetermine that the equipoise issue has been resolved\nare the Eleventh Circuit, in Jones v. Dugger, the\nArizona Supreme Court. And in State v. Gretzler, they\nfound that the provision provided for equipoise, as\nwell as in Idaho, in State v. Hoffman.\nAs it relates to a juror somehow imposing\ndeath when they are undecided, I would direct you to\npage 26 of the joint appendix, at instruction number 9,\nwhich reads, \"The Defendant is entitled to the\nindividual opinion of each juror. Each of you must\nconsider the evidence for the purpose of reaching a\nverdict. Each of you must decide the case for\nyourself.\"\nFurthermore, the jury is instructed, in\ninstruction number 12 in the second paragraph on page\n28 of the joint appendix, that, \"In order to reach a\nverdict in the case, your decision must be unanimous.\nAnd then, after reasonable deliberation, if you are\nunable to reach a unanimous verdict, you shall notify\nthe Court, and the result is a life sentence.\"\nKansas law is very clear that death is only\nappropriate in the singular instance in which a jury\nhas found beyond a reasonable doubt with unanimity that\nthe defendant is guilty of capital murder, that an\naggravating factor exists, and then that the mitigating\nfactors do not outweigh the aggravating factors.\nIt was in 1994 that the Kansas Legislature\npassed the death penalty in Kansas, a few years after\nthe Walton decision. And I was there for the debate,\nas a legislator. It was a compelling moment, not just\nbecause of the result, but the solemnity and\nseriousness of the debate in which they were seeking to\ndefine, through their reasoned moral judgment, what\njustice demands in instances such as this.\nAnd recognizing this Court as the final\narbiter of the meaning of the Eighth Amendment, you\nwill see, through pages 23 through 28 of your appendix,\nyour words mirrored back to you. The Legislature has\nrespected your judgment and made the reasoned moral\ndecision that death is appropriate in the instances --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Was there a particular --\nMR. KLINE: -- that we are discussing.\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- was there a reason why\nthey provided that, in the case of equipoise, the\nsentence would be death? Or is that just a quirk of\nthe way the provision was written?\nMR. KLINE: In the debate, all of these\ndecisions were discussed through committee as well as\non the legislative floor. And the belief was, in these\nvarious aggravated and narrow circumstances, that the\nState believes death is appropriate. And if we\nfollowed the individualized sentencing line of these\ncases and allowed a jury to consider all of the\nmitigating evidence that is relevant, that the State\ncould make that decision.\nThank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General\nKline.\n"
