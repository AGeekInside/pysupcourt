Myriad Genetics, Inc.\nMr. Hansen?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER A. HANSEN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. HANSEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nOne way to address the question presented by\nthis case is what exactly did Myriad invent? And the\nanswer is nothing.\nMyriad unlocked the secrets of two human\ngenes. These are genes that correlate with an increased\nrisk of breast or ovarian cancer. But the genes\nthemselves, their -- where they start and stop, what\nthey do, what they are made of, and what happens when\nthey go wrong are all decisions that were made by\nnature, not by Myriad.\nNow, Myriad deserves credit for having\nunlocked these secrets. Myriad does not deserve a\npatent for it.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Hansen, Respondents\nsay that isolating or extracting natural products, that\nhas long been considered patentable, and give -\nexamples were aspirin and whooping cough vaccine. How\nis this different from -- those start with natural -\nnatural products.\nMR. HANSEN: Well, in -- in essence, Your\nHonor, everything starts with a natural product. And\nthis Court has said repeatedly that just extracting a\nnatural product is insufficient. For example, this\nCourt has used the example of gold. You can't patent\ngold because it's a natural product.\nThe examples that you cite all involve\nfurther manipulation of a product of nature, so that the\nproduct of nature is no longer what it was in nature;\nit's become something different, and in many instances\nhas taken on a new function.\nBut -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you dispute that\nyou can patent, however, a process for extracting\nnaturally-occurring things?\nMR. HANSEN: Of course. I think that is\ntotally acceptable. And what's interesting in this case\nis, the process that Myriad uses to extract the genes is\nnot at issue in this case. It's a process that's used\nby geneticists every day all over this country. It is\nroutine, conventional science.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So isn't that -- why\nisn't that a way to in effect have patent protection for\nthe product? Does somebody who wants to use the\nproduct, the DNA -- extracted DNA in this case have to\nfind a new process from -- to extract it if they want to\nhave it available?\nMR. HANSEN: Well, the -- the process by\nwhich it's extracted is now very routine.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, no -- yes, I\nknow. I'm assuming it isn't, that they discover this\nprocess and it leads to a -- a particular product. Does\nanybody who wants to use the product either have to get\na license for the process or find a different way of\nextracting it?\nMR. HANSEN: I think they have to find a\ndifferent way of extracting it, in the same way that\nfinding a method of extracting gold does entitle you to\na patent on the method of extracting gold, it may also\nentitle you to a patent on the use of gold. For\nexample, if you find a new way of using gold to make\nearrings, or if you find a new way of using DNA to do\nsomething, you may be entitled to a patent on that,\nbecause -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can you tell me why\ntheir test wasn't given a patent? I know the method of\nextraction wasn't, and why. Why would the tests -\nwould the tests be subject to a patent?\nMR. HANSEN: The tests are also routine and\nconventional science, but in this particular case, there\nwere some method claims that we challenged. The method\nclaims in this case involved taking the genes that you\nextracted from the woman and the gene that you -- the\nway you think it should be, and simply looking back and\nforth to see if they're the same or different. And the\nFederal Circuit that -- found that that was an abstract\nidea, and not patentable.\nAnd, in fact, that's -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I'm curious as to why\nthe methodology of extracting the gene has not been\npatented. You say everybody -- everybody uses it. Why\nwasn't that patented?\nMR. HANSEN: The original -- the original\nmethodology was patented, and is -- is patentable. In\nfact, if they came up with a new process, it would be\npatentable. But it has -- but that -- it has been very\nfreely licensed. In fact, the patent may now have\nexpired. And so it's used all over the country every\nday.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Can I take you back to -- to\nJustice Ginsburg's question, because I'm -- I don't -\nI'm not sure you got at what troubles me about that.\nSuppose there is a substance, a -- a\nchemical, a molecule in the -- the leaf -- the leaves of\na plant that grows in the Amazon, and it's discovered\nthat this has tremendous medicinal purposes. Let's say\nit -- it treats breast cancer.\nA new discovery, a new way -- a way is\nfound, previously unknown, to extract that. You make a\ndrug out of that. Your answer is that cannot be\npatent -- patented; it's not eligible for patenting,\nbecause the chemical composition of the -- of the drug\nis the same as the chemical that exists in the leaves of\nthe plant.\nMR. HANSEN: If there is no alteration, if\nwe simply pick the leaf off of the tree and swallow it\nand it has some additional value, then I think it is not\npatentable. You might be able to get a method patent on\nit, you might be able to get a use patent on it, but you\ncan't get a composition patent.\nBut as -\nJUSTICE ALITO: But you're making -- you\nkeep making the hypotheticals easier than they're\nintended to be. It's not just the case of taking the\nleaf off the tree and chewing it. Let's say if you do\nthat, you'd have to eat a whole forest to get the -- the\nvalue of this. But it's extracted and -- and reduced to\na concentrated form. That's not patent -- that's not\neligible?\nMR. HANSEN: No, that may well be eligible,\nbecause you have now taken what was in nature and you've\ntransformed it in two ways. First of all, you've made\nit substantially more concentrated than it was in\nnature; and second, you've given it a function. If it\ndoesn't work in the diluted form but does work in a\nconcentrated form, you've given it a new function. And\nthe -- by both changing its nature and by giving it a\nnew function, you may well have patent -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, when you concede that,\nthen I'm not sure how you distinguish the isolated DNA\nhere, because it has a different function. Will you\ndispute that? Isolated DNA has a very different\nfunction from the DNA as it exists in nature. And\nalthough the chemical composition may not be different,\nit -- it certainly is in a different form. So what is\nthe distinction?\nMR. HANSEN: Well, I don't think it has a\nnew function, Your Honor, with respect. I believe that\nwhat -- Myriad has proffered essentially three functions\nfor the DNA outside the body as opposed to inside the\nbody. The first is we can look at it. And that's true,\nbut that's not really a new function. That's simply the\nnature of when you extract something you can look at it\nbetter.\nThe second two rationales that Myriad has\nproffered are that it can be used as probes and primers.\nThree of the -- three of lower court judges found that\nfull-length DNA, which all of these patent claims\ninclude, cannot be used as probes and primers. But more\nimportant, finding a new use for a product of nature, if\nyou don't change the product of nature, is not\npatentable. If I find a new way of taking gold and\nmaking earrings out of it, that doesn't entitle me to a\npatent on gold. If I find a new way of using lead, it\ndoesn't entitle me to a new -- to a patent on lead.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: From what you know and\nfrom what the record shows, would the process of tagging\nthe isolated DNA be patentable? The process of tagging,\nwe just don't know about that or is there a patent on\nthat?\nMR. HANSEN: The very patents in this case\ninclude claims on -- on DNA that is tagged so that it\ncan be used as a probe. We have not challenged that.\nWe are not asking the Court to strike down that.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Under our -- our law, is a\npatent ever divisible so that if it's valid in part but\ninvalid in another part, it can still stand as to the\npart?\nMR. HANSEN: No, it is not permissible under\npatent law to do essentially a narrowing -- narrowing\nconstruction of the -- of the claim.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But if you haven't\nchallenged this, then -- then where are we with respect\nto the tagging? I don't quite understand. Because\nthe -- the entire patent which includes tagging would\nfail under your argument.\nMR. HANSEN: Oh, I'm sorry, no. I\nmisunderstood. The claims that we are challenging do\nnot -- are not limited to tagging, are not limited to\nuse as probes. There are other claims that we are not\nchallenging that are limited to probes. Those would\nremain, but the -- but the claims that we're challenging\nwould in fact be struck down, because they're not so\nlimited. In fact -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Then -- then explain\nwhen you said you can't narrow. You said earlier you\ncan't narrow.\nMR. HANSEN: Yes. If a claim reaches\nsomething that is both impermissible and permissible,\nit -- the claim is invalid, period.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right, that\nindividual claim is invalid.\nMR. HANSEN: That individual claim.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But the patent with\nrespect to claims that are not invalid would still\nstand.\nMR. HANSEN: That is correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The primers and probes\nstand.\nMR. HANSEN: Would -- would still remain.\nEven if you were to rule for Petitioners, you would not\nhave to rule concerning the use of DNA as a probe or a\nprimer.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Hansen, could you tell\nme what you think the incentives are for a company to do\nwhat Myriad did? If you assume that it takes a lot of\nwork and takes a lot of investment to identify this\ngene, but the gene is not changed in composition, and\nwhat you just said is that discovering uses for that\ngene would not be patentable even if those new -- even\nif those uses are new, what does Myriad get out of this\ndeal? Why shouldn't we worry that Myriad or companies\nlike it will just say, well, you know, we're not going\nto do this work anymore?\nMR. HANSEN: Well, we know that would not\nhave happened in this particular case, Your Honor. We\nknow that there were other labs looking for the BRCA\ngenes and they had announced that they would not patent\nthem if they were the first to find it. We also know\nthat prior to the patent actually being issued, there\nwere other labs doing BRCA testing and Myriad shut all\nthat testing down. So we know in this particular case\nthat problem would not have arisen.\nBut the point of the whole -- the whole\npoint of the product of nature doctrine is that when you\nlock up a product of nature, it prevents industry from\ninnovating and -- and making new discoveries. That's\nthe reason we have the product of nature doctrine, is\nbecause there may be a million things you can do with\nthe BRCA gene, but nobody but Myriad is allowed to look\nat it and that is impeding science rather than advancing\nit.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you still haven't\nanswered her question. Why? Why would a company incur\nmassive investment if it -- if it cannot patent?\nMR. HANSEN: Well, taxpayers paid for much\nof the investment in Myriad's work, but -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're still not answering\nthe question.\nMR. HANSEN: But -- yeah. But I think\nscientists look for things for a whole variety of\nreasons, sometimes because they're curious about the\nworld as a whole; sometimes because -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Curiosity is your answer.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I thought you were going\nto -\nMR. HANSEN: Sometimes, because they want a\nNobel Prize. Sometimes -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I thought you were going to\nsay something else, Mr. Hansen, and I guess I -- I hoped\nyou were going to say something else, which is that,\nnotwithstanding that you can't get a patent on this\ngene, that -- that there are still, you know, various\nthings that you could get a patent on that would make\nthis kind of investment worthwhile in the usual case.\nBut if that's the case, I want to know what those things\nare rather than you're just saying, you know, we're\nsupposed to leave it to scientists who want Nobel\nPrizes.\nAnd I agree that there are those scientists,\nbut there are also, you know, companies that do\ninvestments in these kinds of things that you hope won't\njust shut them down.\nMR. HANSEN: Let me give a specific example\nthat may be helpful in doing a better job of answering\nthe question. One of the -- one of the amici has\nworried a lot about whether a decision for the\nPetitioners in this case would invalidate recombinant\nDNA. Recombinant DNA is in fact what all the major\ninnovations in the industry are doing these days. It's\nDNA where the scientist decides the sequence rather than\nnature deciding the sequence.\nThere is nothing in our position that would\nprevent recombinant DNA from being patented, but there\nis -- it is the cases that if the patents are upheld,\nrecombinant DNA is frustrated.\nPeople can't use pieces of the BRCA gene to\nrecombine them and find new treatments and find new\ndiagnoses and find new things that will advance medicine\nand science as a result of these patents. It's a\nperfect example of what the point of the product of\nnature doctrine is.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. But, of course, to\nprofit from -- from that recombinant DNA, you have to\nnot just isolate the gene, but then you have to do\nsomething with it afterwards. So you really haven't\ngiven us a reason why somebody would try to isolate the\ngene.\nMR. HANSEN: Well -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, sure, yes, I can do\nstuff with it afterwards, but so can everybody else.\nWhat advantage do I get from being the person that or\nthe company that isolated that -- that gene. You say\nnone at all.\nMR. HANSEN: No, I think you get enormous\nrecognition, but I don't think -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's lovely.\nMR. HANSEN: But I think that we know that\nthat's sufficient. We know it's sufficient with respect\nto these two genes. We also know it's sufficient with\nrespect to the human genome.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm not sure the\nCourt can decide the case on -- on that basis. I'm sure\nthat there are substantial arguments in the amicus brief\nthat this investment is necessary and that -- and that\nmakes sense. To say, oh, well, the taxpayers will do\nit, don't worry, is I think an insufficient answer.\nAs Justice Kagan's follow-up questions\nindicated, I thought you might say, well, there are\nprocess patents that they can have, that this is\nsufficient.\nMR. HANSEN: And that's certainly true.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I -- I just don't\nthink we can decide the case on the ground, oh, don't\nworry about investment, it'll come. I -- I just don't\nthink we can do that. It may be that the law allows you\nto prevail on the fact that this is -- occurs in nature\nand there's nothing new here, but that's quite\ndifferent.\nMR. HANSEN: And it is certainly true, as\nYour Honor suggests, that one of the incentives here is\na process patent or a development patent. If you -- if\nyou've isolated the gene and you find a new use for it,\nyou could get a patent on the new use for the patent.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's the whole point,\nisn't it? The isolation itself is not valuable; it's\nthe use you put the isolation to. That's the answer,\nisn't it?\nMR. HANSEN: That's exactly correct. Thank\nyou. Yes, that is the answer.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And so, that is the\nanswer, which is in isolation it has no value. It's\njust nature sitting there.\nMR. HANSEN: Interestingly, it has one\nvalue. And that is you can look at it to see if there's\na mutation in it. And when you find a mutation in the\nisolated gene, you write back to the woman who provided\nthe sample and you say to her: Because the isolated\ngene is the same as the gene in your body, I can tell\nyou that there's a mutation in your body.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's a failure of the\npatent law. It doesn't patent ideas.\nMR. HANSEN: And it shouldn't patent ideas,\nand -- but it also makes the point that isolated gene\nand the gene in the body are the same.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can we go to -- can we\ngo to cDNA a moment?\nMR. HANSEN: Sure.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That is artificially\ncreated in the laboratory, so it's not bound in nature.\nIt's not taking a gene and snipping something that's in\nnature. And yet you claim that can't be patented. The\nintrons are taken out, the exons are left in, and\nthey're sequenced together. Give me your brief argument\non that. I read your brief, but it is not a product of\nnature; it's a product of human invention.\nMR. HANSEN: There are two big differences\nbetween cDNA and DNA. The first is exactly the one Your\nHonor just discussed, which is that the introns, the\nnoncoding regions, have been removed. That is done in\nthe body, by the body. That's done in the process of\nDNA going to mRNA.\nWhat the scientist does who's creating the\ncDNA is they take the mRNA out of the body and then they\nsimply have the natural nature-driven nucleotide binding\nprocesses complement the mRNA. So that if the mRNA has\na C, the scientist just puts the corresponding\nnucleotide in there and nature causes them to bind up.\nThe scientist does not decide -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I know, but I don't see the\nanswer, because I gather, if I -- if I've read it\ncorrectly, that when you have an R -- the messenger RNA\ndoes not have the same base pairs. There's a U or\nsomething instead of an A or whatever it is.\nMR. HANSEN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So when you actually look,\nif you could get a super-microscope and look at what\nthey have with the cDNA, with their cDNA, you would\ndiscover something with an A, not a U. Is it AU? Is\nthat the one?\nMR. HANSEN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Okay. So -- so you\nwould discover something with an A there, you see, and\nyou wouldn't discover something with a U there. And\nthere is no such thing in nature as the no-introns AGG,\nwhatever, okay? It's not there. That's not truly\nisolated DNA. But you can go look up the Amazon,\nwherever you want. Hence the question. Now, on that\none, how? How is that found in nature? The answer is\nit isn't.\nMR. HANSEN: Well, but I would suggest, Your\nHonor, that the question is not whether it is identical\nto something in nature. The question is whether there\nwas a human invention involved, whether it is markedly\ndifferent from what is found in nature.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that goes to\nobviousness. That does not in my mind go to the issue\nof whether it's patent eligible. You may have a very\nstrong argument on obviousness, but why does it not -\nit's creating something that's not found in nature at\nall.\nMR. HANSEN: The sequence of the nucleotides\nis dictated by nature. The order that they go in is\ndictated by nature.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that's a separate\nquestion -\nMR. HANSEN: It is true -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- about whether this\nclaim is too expansive because it's claiming every 15\nnucleotides and nature produces 15 randomly. But\nassuming the claim was for the entire mutated gene and\nnot the small snippet that they want to capture the\nwhole gene with, that's -- that whole gene without the\nintrons is just not found in nature.\nMR. HANSEN: It is not -- the -- the exons\nwith the exact same composition and in the exact same\norder are found in nature, and the question is whether\nwhen the body removes the introns, has the body made\nsomething markedly different than what is in nature, and\nit is our view -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: When I first looked at\nthis case, I -- I thought that maybe the cDNA was kind\nof an economy class gene, was -- it wasn't. But my\nunderstanding is that it may have a functionality that\nthe -- the DNA isolate does not, easier to tag, et\ncetera. That may be incorrect for the record, but that\nwas my present understanding.\nMR. HANSEN: It is somewhat easier to work\nwith cDNA to make recombinant DNA, and it's recombinant\nDNA that is the place where all of the innovation and\nall the efforts are taking place. And if we lock -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is all the tagging done on\nrecombinant DNA?\nMR. HANSEN: All of the change -- all of the\nuseful things that we are inventing is done -- is done\nthrough the process of recombinant DNA. And if we lock\nup the cDNA, it makes it harder to do the recombinant\nDNA. So that if someone owns all the cDNA, I can't do\nrecombinant DNA using what the company owns.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Hansen, you answered\nmy initial question by saying they start -- everything\nstarts with a national -- natural product, but these\nothers, the examples that I gave, you said they involve\nmanipulation. The -- the cDNA can't be characterized as\ninvolving manipulation?\nMR. HANSEN: It certainly -- there's -\nthere is some manipulation, although it's -- it's\nletting nature manipulate, not doing -- not the\nscientist manipulating. But it -- what the other factor\nthat distinguishes aspirin and the other examples you\nuse from cDNA is that they have -- the alteration of the\nsubstance has also altered the function, and cDNA has\nexactly the same function as DNA with the exception of\nJustice Kennedy's, that it's easier to use with.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you -- you've really\nlost me when you say that it's nature that does the\nalteration rather than the scientist. I mean, whenever\na scientist does an alteration, he does it, you know, by\nsome force of nature.\nMR. HANSEN: No -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, he doesn't do it\nunnaturally, does he? I mean, there's some -\nMR. HANSEN: Well, let me try an analogy,\nYour Honor, that might be helpful. In our view, it's\nlike Funk Brothers in the sense that the five bacteria\nin Funk Brothers didn't sit together in nature.\nThe scientists took them and put them\ntogether in nature. Here the scientist takes the exons\nand lets the natural processes of the body put them\ntogether in -- in the laboratory. It's exactly the same\nas Funk Brothers.\nIf I could reserve the remainder of my time,\nYour Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can I ask a question, which\nI don't think will be taken from your time.\nMR. HANSEN: Sure, of course.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But I have to ask you this.\nLook, you say don't reach the cDNA issue and the reason\nis because of the nature of the claim. Okay, I look at\ntheir claim. Their claim says they want \"the isolated\nDNA of claim 1 wherein said DNA has the nucleotide\nsequence set forth in SEQ ID No. 1.\"\nThen we turn to that and the first thing it\nsays right there is it says, \"The molecule involved\nis\" -- \"Molecule type: cDNA.\" And then it has a long\nlist and that long list is a list of the basis, okay.\nSo molecule type, cDNA. So they say what do\nyou mean they aren't claiming cDNA? That's what they\nsay they're claiming.\nMR. HANSEN: No -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because of the word\n\"wherein.\" So I go back to the \"wherein\" in Prometheus\nand the \"wherein\" -- you read \"wherein\" as in context,\nand in this context you mean to say that a person who\nmakes isolated DNA that has lots of introns in it as\nwell as the sequence is going to be an infringer under\nclaim 2?\nMR. HANSEN: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is there any support for\nthat other than the treatise that you cited?\nMR. HANSEN: There -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, I looked at that\nand it said read the \"wherein\" depending on context.\nMR. HANSEN: Well, that certainly -\nJUSTICE BREYER: And then depending on -\nokay. Then you got -- you heard what I said, so I want\nto know is there anything else I should read?\nMR. HANSEN: Yes. The other support for it\nis the definition of the DNA in the patent itself, which\nwe cite, which says that whenever we use the term \"DNA\"\nwe mean both.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, I saw that. I saw\nthat.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. HANSEN: Thank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: General Verrilli?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.,\nFOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING NEITHER PARTY\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nEnforcing the distinction between human\ninvention and a product of nature preserves a necessary\nbalance in the patent system between encouraging\nindividual inventors and keeping the basic building\nblocks of innovation free for all to use. Isolated DNA\nfalls on the ineligible side of that divide because it\nis simply native DNA extracted from the body. The claim\nthat it is a -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are we fighting over\nnothing? Are you fighting over nothing? If -- if they\ncan patent this cDNA in the way they have, what does it\nmatter, since it appears as if research has to rely on\nthe cDNA to be effective?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: I actually think that --\nI think we're -- we're fighting about something of\nimportance. That question gets right to it. I want to\nanswer the question directly, Your Honor. I'd like to\nmake a prefatory point before doing so.\nThe claim that isolated DNA is a human\ninvention rests entirely on the fact that it is no\nlonger connected at the molecular level to what\nsurrounded it in the body. But allowing a patent on\nthat basis would effectively preempt anyone else from\nusing the gene itself for any medical or scientific\npurpose. That is not true about a patent on cDNA. A\npatent on cDNA leaves the isolated DNA available for\nother scientists and other -- and others in the medical\nprofession to try to generate new uses.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Hansen -- Mr. Hansen\njust said that to do recombinant technology, you have to\nuse the cDNA rather than the native D -- the isolated\nDNA. Do you disagree with that?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: That's not my\nunderstanding, Justice Kagan. My understanding is that\nyou -- that the native DNA can be used for recombinant\nDNA without the step of cDNA. We do think cDNA is\nimportant and the position of the United States is that\ncDNA is patent eligible. We disagree -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose his\nunderstanding is correct. Suppose your misunderstanding\n-- suppose your understanding is not correct.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Our position, though, is\nthat cDNA is patent eligible because we think, unlike\nthe isolated DNA which is just taken from your body,\ncDNA is an artificial creation in the laboratory that\ndoesn't correspond to anything in your body.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But Mister -- General\nVerrilli, I got the distinct impression from your brief\nthat your view was that, although the cDNA may be\npatentable, it might very well be rejected as obvious.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: That's true now, Justice\nGinsburg, but obviousness is determined at the time that\nthe patent is issued, so what may be true now might not\nhave been true at the time the patents were initially\nissued. And -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I understand -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I -- I thought\nthe basic general approach here was we have a very\nexpansive view of what is patent eligible and then we\nnarrow things through things -- issues like obviousness\nand so on. Why -- wouldn't it make more sense to\naddress the questions at issue here in the obviousness\nrealm?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: That's a little -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If you got something\nthat's big, it seems to me pretty obvious that you could\ntake a smaller part of it; that the idea -- a smaller\npart of something that's bigger is obvious. Now, yes,\nyou can have a patent on the process of extracting that\nsmall part, but I don't understand how a small part of\nsomething bigger isn't obvious. And if it is, I don't\nunderstand why this -- these issues aren't addressed at\nthat stage.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Well, I think my answer\nto that, I guess, Your Honor, would -- would point first\nto Mayo, in which the Court recognized that the\nthreshold test under Section 101 for patent eligibility\ndoes do work that the obviousness test and a novelty\ntest and a specification test do not do; and the work\nthat it does here, I would respectfully submit, is to\nensure that the natural substance, the product of nature\nitself, is not subjected effectively to a monopoly,\nbecause if it can be deemed to be a human invention\nsolely as a result of the change that occurs when you\nextract it from the body, then that means, as a -- as a\npractical matter that you have granted a patent on the\ngene itself because no one else can extract it because\nextracting it is isolating it; isolating it violates the\npatent.\nAnd so as a result of that, no one else can\ntry to develop competing tests for breast cancer, no one\nelse can try to use this gene for recombinant DNA.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm -- I'm not sure\nthat's responsive to my concern. Your answer said well,\nhere are a lot of reasons why this shouldn't have patent\nprotection. My question goes to whether we ought to\nfocus on those reasons at the eligibility stage or at\nthe obviousness stage.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Well, the Court\nidentified in Chakrabarty and then reiterated in Mayo\nthat -- that it is -- that the right answer to that\nquestion, Your Honor, is to focus on them at the\neligibility stage, because the -- because getting the\nbalance right is of critical importance.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, the issue here is a\nvery difficult one. It's one on which the Government\nhas changed its position; isn't that correct?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE ALITO: It seems that there is\ndisagreement within the Executive Branch about it. This\ncase has been structured in an effort to get us to\ndecide this on the broadest possible ground, that\nthere's no argument, that it's just about 101, it's not\nabout any other provision of the Patent Act.\nWhy -- why should we -- why should we do\nthat? We have claims that if patent eligibility is\ndenied here it will prevent investments that are\nnecessary for the development of new drugs or it will\nlead those who develop the new drugs, new diagnostic\ntechniques, to keep those secret, not disclose them to\nthe public. Why -- why should we jump in and -- and\ndecide the broadest possible question?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Well, I would -- again, I\nwould point the Court to what the Court said last term\nin Mayo, which is that the determination of patent\neligibility really is a double-edged sword.\nAnd it may be that in a -- in a particular\ncase, maybe this case, although we are not expressing a\nview on it, you could sort the issue out on some of the\nother criteria, but that won't generally be true, and\nthe proposition of whether you can patent the gene\nitself is a question we think of fundamental importance,\nand it raises exactly the two-edged sword concern that\nled the Court to conclude what it did in Mayo. And Mayo\nwas a situation very much -- I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: General Verrilli, there's\nan assertion made in Respondents' brief that the United\nStates would be in a singular position. That is, they\nsuggest that in every other industrialized nation this\ncould be subject -- could be patentable.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Yes, and that -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that so?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: No. I think the picture\nis much more complicated than that. In many other\nnations it wouldn't be patentable and the patent law is\ndifferent from nation to nation.\nI'll give one example I think helps\nillustrate the point. In Germany and France, for\nexample, you can get a patent on isolated genomic DNA\nbut only for a particular use. So you would get what is\nthe equivalent of a use patent, which is a patent that\nwe would think under our patent laws is acceptable, too.\nIf you -- just as with the question that\nJustice Alito asked earlier about identifying a -- a\nuseful substance in a plant in the Amazon, if you\nisolate that and it proves to have therapeutic effects,\nyou can get a patent on that use of it, but what you\ncan't do is get a patent on the substance itself so that\nno one else can explore it for different uses and for -\nand for different therapeutic purposes or to try to\nrecombine it and turn it into a -- an even more\ntherapeutic -- therapeutically valuable substance. And\nthat's -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I understand why you are\nsaying cDNA is patentable as a subject matter. I am\nlooking at the way the claim is phrased, however, and it\nsays that it's patenting a DNA segment 15 nucleotides\nlong or longer. The reality is that 15 nucleotides\ndoesn't necessarily bridge a sequence that goes between\nexons. It -- it can -- one exon can be 15 or more\nsequences long. So are you arguing that this claim as\nwritten is sustainable?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Your Honor, as a -- I am\ngoing to invoke my privilege as an amicus in this\nsituation. I think that's a fight between the parties.\nThe point that we wanted to make is that as a conceptual\nmatter cDNA is patent eligible.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you are not taking\nthe position that this claim as written is patentable?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: That's right, Your Honor.\nWe're just saying as a conceptual matter that we think\ncDNA is a creation of the lab, it's an artificial\ncreation; it's as a general matter patent eligible.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because as I understand\nit, 15 nucleotides long exists naturally in nature.\nThey get reproduced in that sequence of 15.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: That -- that may well be\nright, Your Honor. As I said, we're not taking a\nposition on the particulars.\nBut if I -- just to return to the point that\nJustice Alito made, the Court really was faced with a\nsimilar situation in Mayo. On the one side you had\nthe -- the industry coming in and saying: Look, we have\ngot a lot of reliance issue, PTO has issued more than\n150,000 patents here. You are going to really disrupt\nthose reliance issues. On the other side you had the\nAmerican Medical Association, as you have here, coming\nin and saying: Actually, these patents inhibit much\nmore innovation than they incent.\nAnd what the Court said is that -- as\nJustice Kennedy alluded to earlier, that the Court's not\nin a position to resolve that dispute conclusively. It\ndoesn't have the institutional wherewithal to do it.\nBut what the Court is in a position to do is to apply\nthe general principles of law as they were articulated\nin Mayo, and then if there needs to be a particular\ndifferent set of rules for the biotech industry,\nCongress can provide that different set of rules.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: General Verrilli, could\nI understand what you said, because I think it might be\na little bit different from Mr. Hansen and I just want\nto understand your position. You said that a company\ncan't get a -- a patent on the thing, but can get it on\nthe uses. So, if I find this plant, let's say, in the\nAmazon and I can't get a patent on the thing itself, but\ncan I get a patent when I discover that if you eat this\nplant it has therapeutic effects?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: May I answer briefly,\nMr. Chief Justice?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Briefly, please.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Yes, you certainly can,\nand that illustrates the difference. That patent is\njust for the use; it doesn't tie up all other potential\nuses of the substance and that's the key.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.\nMr. Castanias?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY A. CASTANIAS\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. CASTANIAS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nIt is now 33 years after Chakrabarty,\n31 years after the first isolated gene molecule patents\nissued, and 12 years after the Patent and Trademark\nOffice issued its carefully reasoned Utility Guidelines\nconfirming that new isolated gene molecules are eligible\nfor patents, and it's almost 16 years after Myriad's\npatents began to issue, Patents which -- yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is that on the basis of\na new extraction process?\nMR. CASTANIAS: On a -- a new extraction\nprocess, no. Most of the processes are known. But\nthat's not relevant to patent eligibility or, for that\nmatter, patentability. As the last sentence, Justice\nSotomayor, of Section 103A says, \"Patentability shall\nnot be negated by the manner in which the invention was\ncreated.\"\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- I have a sort of\nanalytical problem. I find it very, very difficult to\nconceive how you can patent a sequential numbering\nsystem by nature, in the same way that I have a problem\nin thinking that someone could get a patent on the\ncomputer binary code merely because they throw a certain\nnumber of things on a piece of paper in a certain order.\nI always thought that to have a patent you\nhad to take something and add to what nature does. So\nhow do you add to nature when all you are doing is\ncopying its sequence?\nMR. CASTANIAS: Well, I guess I'll -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How do you add to it\nbesides process or use?\nMR. CASTANIAS: Sure. Well, Justice\nSotomayor, I guess I'll take issue with the notion that\nthere is nothing additive here. What Myriad inventors\ncreated in this circumstance was a new molecule that had\nnever before been known to the world. Now remember,\ngenes are themselves human constructs. And this points\nup some of the serious analytical problems with the\nProduct of Nature Doctrine as the line-drawing exercise\nthat you've asked General Verrilli and Mr. Hansen to\nengage in has illustrated.\nNow, the line-drawing is what is the product\nof nature to start with? Is it me? Is it the genome?\nIs it the chromosome? Is it the -- and the gene\nultimately -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Look, I can bake -\nMR. CASTANIAS: -- is what was defined.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I can bake a chocolate\nchip cookie using natural ingredients -- salt, flour,\neggs, butter -- and I create my chocolate chip cookie.\nAnd if I combust those in some new way, I can get a\npatent on that. But I can't imagine getting a patent\nsimply on the basic items of salt, flour and eggs,\nsimply because I've created a new use or a new product\nfrom those ingredients.\nMR. CASTANIAS: And that's -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Explain to me -\nMR. CASTANIAS: Sure.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- why gene sequences,\nwhether in the actual numbers, why gene sequences are\nnot those basic products that you can't patent.\nMR. CASTANIAS: Okay. I'll start by -- by\nshowing you how this is actually a different structure.\nIt actually has an entirely different chemical name when\nyou give it the C -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's the cDNA.\nMR. CASTANIAS: No, no, no. That's\nabsolutely true with regard to the isolated molecule as\nwell. Because if you were to write it out in those -\nthose interminable chemical equations that we had to do\nin high school, it's a \"C\" very different, \"H\" very\ndifferent.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So I put salt and flour,\nand that's different?\nMR. CASTANIAS: Well, that is -- that is the\ncombination, yes, of two different things, and that's\nsort of like -- that's sort of like -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So if I take them apart,\nnow you can get a patent on the salt and now you can get\na patent on the flour?\nMR. CASTANIAS: Well, they were apart\nbefore, but they were both old. But that's the problem\nwith using the really simplistic analogies, with all due\nrespect, Your Honor, about you know, like coal -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, I guess -\nMR. CASTANIAS: -- like leaves and that sort\nof thing.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why is the chemical\ncomposition in the isolated DNA different? You were\nabout to explain that.\nMR. CASTANIAS: Yes, thank you,\nJustice Alito. It -- it's got 5,914 nucleotides. The\ngenome itself has over 3 billion. It's arranged in the\nway set forth -- as set forth in the SEQ IDs number 1\nand 2. Number 2 is the so-called genomic DNA, SEQ ID\nnumber 1 is the, as Justice Breyer understood, the cDNA\nmolecule.\nWhen you look at those particular sequences,\nthere was invention in the decision of where to begin\nthe gene and where to end the gene. That was not given\nby nature. In fact -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, well, well, well,\nthis is something I was going to ask you. I -- I assume\nthat it's true that -- that those abridged genes,\nwhatever you want to call them, do exist in the body.\nThat they do exist. You -- you haven't created a type\nof gene that does -- does not exist in the body\nnaturally.\nMR. CASTANIAS: But we've -- I'll -- I'll\nuse my own simplistic analogy which we offered in our\nbrief and which we offered to the lower court. A\nbaseball bat doesn't exist until it's isolated from a\ntree. But that's still the product of human invention\nto decide where to begin the bat and where to end the\nbat.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's true, but then\nyou were saying something that I just didn't understand,\nbecause I thought the -- the scientists who had filed\nbriefs here, as I read it, said it's quite true that the\nchromosome has the BRCA gene in the middle of it and\nit's attached to two ends.\nBut also in the body, perhaps because cells\ndie, there is isolated DNA. And that means that the DNA\nstrand, the chromosome strand is cut when a cell dies,\nand then isolated bits get around, and there may be very\nfew of them in the world, but there are some, by the\nlaws of probability, that will in fact match precisely\nthe BRCA1 gene.\nNow, have I misread what the scientists told\nus, or are you saying that the scientists are wrong?\nMR. CASTANIAS: Well, I will tell you\nthat -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I probably misread it.\nThere's a better chance that I've misread it.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. CASTANIAS: Well, no, I think -- I think\nyou may have read some of the submissions correctly,\nJustice Breyer. I think that's a question -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, which one have I not\nread -\nMR. CASTANIAS: I think that's a question of\nsome dispute in this record.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, in other words, you're\nsaying that the Lander brief is wrong.\nMR. CASTANIAS: Well, what I will tell\nyou -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I want to know, because I\nhave to admit that I read it and I did assume that as a\nmatter of science it was correct. So I would like to\nknow whether you agree, as a matter of science, that it\nis correct, not of law, but of science, or if you are\ndisagreeing with it, as a matter of science.\nMR. CASTANIAS: What I will tell you is that\nwhat are called pseudogenes -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'd like a yes or no\nanswer.\nMR. CASTANIAS: Yes. So the answer -- I\nwould say the answer is no, because there is no\nevidence -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Was the answer no, you do\nnot disagree with it? I wonder, I disagree or I do\ndisagree?\nMR. CASTANIAS: I do disagree with it with\nthe following -\nJUSTICE BREYER: As a matter of science.\nMR. CASTANIAS: As a matter of science with\nthe following -- okay.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Very well. If you\nare saying it is wrong, as a matter of science, since\nneither of us are scientists, I would like you to tell\nme what I should read that will, from a scientist, tell\nme that it's wrong.\nMR. CASTANIAS: You want me to tell you\nsomething from a scientist that you should read that\ntells you that it is wrong?\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, I need to know -\nMR. CASTANIAS: I think you could look at\nthe declaration in the -- the Joint Appendix for\nDr. Kay, for example. Dr. Kay's declaration appears\nat -- starting at page 370. You'll find an extensive\ndiscussion in there of the technology here and -- and of\nthe genetics.\nBut, Justice Breyer, just to explain the\nfinishing thought, what -- what Dr. Lander says in his\nbrief is that these pseudogenes, which are un -\nundifferentiated fragments, exist in the body. What\nhasn't been brought to the -- to the forefront is\nsomething that is new and useful and available to the\npublic for -- for allowing women to determine whether\nthey have breast or ovarian -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I -\nMR. CASTANIAS: -- mutations that are likely\nto result in cancer.\nYes, Mr. Chief Justice?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I get back to\nyour baseball bat example?\nMR. CASTANIAS: Sure.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: My understanding -\nmy understanding is that here, what's involved,\nobviously through scientific processes, but we're not\ntalking about process. Here, what's involved is\nsnipping. You've got the thing there and you snip -\nsnip off the top and you snip off the bottom and there\nyou've got it.\nThe baseball bat is quite different. You\ndon't look at a tree and say, well, I've cut the branch\nhere and cut it here and all of a sudden I've got a\nbaseball bat. You have to invent it, if you will. You\ndon't have to invent the particular segment of the -- of\nthe strand; you just have to cut it off.\nMR. CASTANIAS: Well, I -- I guess I'll even\ntake issue with that, because the -- the story of how\nthe SEQ ID number 2, the genomic DNA segment came about\nis exactly the opposite of that. If you look, for\nexample, at page 488 of the Joint Appendix, that's the\ndeclaration of one of the inventors, Donna Shaddick, at\nparagraph 27, what -- what she explains is that the\nMyriad inventors first created the cDNA, which we agree\nat least on that score with the Solicitor General, is\nindeed eligible for patenting. But then -- and by the\nway, that cDNA was created from hundreds of different\npatient samples to create what was called a consensus\nsequence.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. You've got\nthe cDNA.\nMR. CASTANIAS: And then what the -- what\nthe Myriad inventors then did to create what is called\nSEQ ID number 2 and what is claimed in claim 1 of the\n'282 patent is to take -- actually manipulate that\nfurther to add in the introns. It was in -- actually,\nthe inventive process was additive.\nNow, ultimately, again, going back to the\nlast sentence of section 103, the patentability should\nnot be negative -- or negated by the manner in which an\ninvention was made, maybe that shouldn't matter. But it\nis a -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I still don't\nunderstand what -- in what sense it's different than\njust snipping along -- along the line.\nMR. CASTANIAS: Well, first of all, you\nwouldn't even know where to snip until the Myriad\ninvention. That's the first problem.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. So that's a\nparticular -- where you snip. We're talking about\nthough the patentability of what's left -\nMR. CASTANIAS: Right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- after you've\nsnipped it.\nMR. CASTANIAS: And -- and that is indeed a\nproduct of human ingenuity and that has substantial new\nuses. Now, my friends on the other side have said -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Castanias, go back to\nJustice Alito's plant in the Amazon, right, because it\ntakes a lot of ingenuity and a lot of effort to actually\nfind that plant, just as it takes a lot of effort and a\nlot of ingenuity to figure out where to snip on -- on\nthe genetic material.\nBut are you -- are you saying that you could\npatent that plant because it takes a lot of effort and a\nlot of ingenuity to find it?\nMR. CASTANIAS: The plant itself, I think\nnot, Justice Kagan, but I think the question that was -\nthat was posed was whether I could take an extract from\nthat plant.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, but can you patent the\nthing itself?\nMR. CASTANIAS: The thing itself I would -\nin that hypothetical, I would say the answer is no.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Even though you know you\nhave to extract the plant itself -\nMR. CASTANIAS: It's a lot of -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: -- from the Amazon forest.\nMR. CASTANIAS: Ah, but you see, now you're\nadding the manipulation -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I'm not -- I mean, I don't\nknow what manipulation means. I mean, you have to take\nthe plant and uproot it, all right?\nMR. CASTANIAS: Okay.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And carry it away and\nisolate it. Can you now patent the thing itself?\nYou've now taken it out of the Amazon forest. Can you\nnow patent it?\nMR. CASTANIAS: Well, what I -- what I\nhaven't done is isolated a new thing. All I have done\nis isolate the plant from the forest. And that's the\ndistinction I think I'm trying to get across to the\nCourt, not particularly well at least in my colloquy\nwith Justice Breyer, but I'll try again. And that is\nthat what -- what was, quote, merely snipped out of the\nbody here is fundamentally different in kind from what\nwas in -- what is in the body. The most important\nreason it's different in kind is that it cannot be used\nin the body to detect the risk of breast and ovarian\ncancers.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, the plant in the\nforest can't be used for any purpose either. It only\nhas a use when it's taken out -- you know, when it's\nuprooted and taken out of the forest. But it's still\nthe same thing. And I guess what you haven't gotten me\nto understand is how this is different than that. It's\nstill the same thing, but now that you've isolated it,\nit in fact has lots of great uses.\nMR. CASTANIAS: Well, I think there are two\nways -- two ways to look at that.\nFirst of all, if you want to look at it from\nthe -- the perspective of the so-called product of\nnature doctrine, which I think has some very dangerous\nconsequences if it's not cabined and understood\ncorrectly -- but if you look at it strictly from a\nproduct of nature doctrine, you could say, well, that's\nthe same plant and it says in the 1930 legislative\nhistory of the Plant Patent Act that plants that are\nunmanipulated by the hand of man are not eligible for\npatents, and that's fine, in terms of their breeding and\ngenetics and that sort of thing.\nBut the product of nature doctrine is\ntroublesome for this reason: Modern medicine -- go\nbeyond just the isolated DNA patents here. Modern\nmedicine, particularly the area of personalized\nmedicine, is trying to get to a point where what we are\nadministering to individual patients is giving them the\nopportunity to mimic the actions of the body. And -- so\nactually, the goal of medicine is to get closer to\nnature, rather than farther away. And anything that\ntakes the product of nature doctrine beyond the simple\ntruism that the product of nature is something that is\nnot a human invention, then that's very dangerous, not\njust for our case -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But when you -- when you\nisolate the DNA, that by itself cannot be used as -- as\na probe until you add tags and -- and other chemicals\nthat make it a probe.\nMR. CASTANIAS: As a probe, that's true. As\na primer, that wouldn't be required.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So it seemed to me your -\nyour answer was not quite accurate when you said, well,\nit can't be used in the body to detect breast cancer.\nNeither can the isolate without some additions.\nMR. CASTANIAS: Well, since this Court -\nI'm sorry.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Now, if it's -- if it's\nthe process or the additions that make it patentable,\nfine. But you're say that the moment it's snipped, it's\npatentable, and that it seems to me was -- was the point\nof Justice Kagan's question.\nMR. CASTANIAS: Well, I -- I will say that\nthat is the final inventive act. It's not the only\ninventive act. It's the final inventive act. If -- if\nindeed you were creating it -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you concede -\nMR. CASTANIAS: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you concede at least\nthat the decision in the Federal Circuit, that Judge\nLourie did make an incorrect assumption, or is the\nLander brief inaccurate with respect to that, too? That\nis, Judge Lourie thought that isolated DNA fragments did\nnot exist in the human body and Dr. Lander says that -\nMR. CASTANIAS: No, what -- I think\nJustice -- Judge Lourie was exactly correct to say that\nthere is nothing in this record that says that isolated\nDNA fragments of BRCA1 exist in the body. Neither does\nDr. Lander's brief, for that matter. And for that\nmatter, those isolated fragments that are discussed in\nDr. Lander's brief again are -- are what are known\nnot -- not in any way as isolated DNA, but as\npseudogenes. They're typically things that have been\nkilled off or mutated by a virus, but they do not -\nJUSTICE ALITO: But isn't this just a\nquestion of probability? To get back to your baseball\nbat example, which at least I -- I can understand better\nthan perhaps some of this biochemistry, I suppose that\nin, you know, I don't know how many millions of years\ntrees have been around, but in all of that time possibly\nsomeplace a branch has fallen off a tree and it's fallen\ninto the ocean and it's been manipulated by the waves,\nand then something's been washed up on the shore, and\nwhat do you know, it's a baseball bat.\nIs that -\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- is that what Dr. Lander\nis talking about?\nMR. CASTANIAS: That's pretty much the same\nas what he's talking about, is that there might be\nsomething that was out there somewhere. But -- but\nthat's really -- the search for this sort of thing that\nmight be very similar to the thing but never was known\nbefore. The patent law has taught -- the patent law is\nall about pushing the frontiers.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So, when you\nare on that, that's good. A more basic question to me\nis when you use the word \"dangerous.\" I had thought -\nand you can -- I'd be interested in your view -- that\nthe patent law is filled with uneasy compromises,\nbecause on the one hand, we do want people to invent; on\nthe other hand, we're very worried about them tying up\nsome kind of whatever it is, particularly a thing that\nitself could be used for further advance.\nAnd so that the compromise that has been\nbuilt historically into this area is: Of course, if you\nget a new satisfying process to extract the sap from the\nplant in the Amazon, patented. Of course, if you get\nthe sap out and you find that you can use it, you\nmanipulate it, you use it, you figure out a way to use\nit to treat cancer, wonderful, patented. But what you\ncan't patent is the sap itself.\nNow, in any individual case that might be\nunfortunate or fortunate. But consider it in the mine\nrun of things. It's important to keep products of\nnature free of the restrictions that patents there are,\nso when Captain Ferno goes to the Amazon and discovers\n50 new types of plants, saps and medicines, discovers\nthem, although that expedition was expensive, although\nnobody had found it before, he can't get a patent on the\nthing itself. He gets a patent on the process, on the\nuse of the thing, but not the thing itself.\nNow, that's my understanding of what I'd\ncall hornbook patent law, which you I confess probably\nunderstand better than I.\nMR. CASTANIAS: Well -\nJUSTICE BREYER: And I would like you to\nexpress your view on that, because that's the framework\nthat I am bringing to the case.\nMR. CASTANIAS: I -- I will offer the view,\nJustice Breyer:\nFirst of all, in this Court's decision in\nBrenner v. Manson, followed repeatedly by the Federal\nCircuit, it has been hornbook patent law, to use your\nterm, that you do not need to -- to call out the utility\nof an invention in a particular claim. What you do have\nto do is have utility for the invention itself described\nin the specification.\nAnd that's what the Patent Office looked to\nin its Utility Guidelines in 2001. But ultimately,\nneither -- I think this case is very -- very easily\ndecided on a straightforward ground that does not\nrequire the Court to go making fine distinctions between\ncDNA and DNA.\nAnd that ground is this: The reasoned\nUtility Guidelines issued in 2001 by the Patent Office,\nwho has not, in a very significant decision, joined the\nbrief of the Solicitor General in this case -- and which\nthey continue to apply under Section 2107 of the Manual\nof Patent Examining Procedure, these guidelines not only\ntell examiners what to do, but in the Federal Register\nthey had notice and comment and 23 specific reasoned,\nsupported by case law, supported by science, responses\nto the objectors. Almost every objection that is made\nto our patents here was made there and answered there.\nThe PTO issued those guidelines to the\npublic. They have been relied on now for 12 years, and\nthey confirm a practice that has been in place much\nlonger than that. And if you take -- whether you can\ncall it the Skidmore deference or just giving respect to\nthe agency that sits at the intersection of law and\nscience -- Justice Breyer, as your opinion for the Court\nin Dickinson v. Zurko pointed out -- those -- that\ndecision by the Patent Office is entitled to respect,\nthe reliance that has been placed -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Even though -- even\nthough the Government has disavowed it, even though the\nGovernment, representing the United States -\nMR. CASTANIAS: Even so, and -- and the\nreason for that is -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: At least that the\nstrength of the presumption would be diluted.\nMR. CASTANIAS: I think you can dilute it a\nlittle bit, but you can't take away the fact that it is\na 30-plus year practice that the Patent Office, despite\nthe executive's position in this Court and in the\nFederal Circuit, continues to follow.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Castanias, could I take\nyou away from the deference point and just ask again\nabout the -- the kind of law that you would have us\nmake. Do you think that the first person who isolated\nchromosomes could have gotten a patent on that?\nMR. CASTANIAS: I think in theory that is\npossible, but I should say this: Because this case is\nabout Section 101, I'm trying -- I'm answering your\nquestion as though it's about 101, patent eligibility.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Yes.\nMR. CASTANIAS: Would it be obvious, would\nit be novel? I'm not sure. Those are different -\nthose are different analytical structures.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Right.\nMR. CASTANIAS: But would it -- and I think\nreally, the -- the statute does the work here. It is\nnew and useful composition of matter -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But the first -\nMR. CASTANIAS: -- if it had use. If it had\na new utility, then yes.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I'm sorry, because -\nbecause -- because, like Justice Breyer, I consider\nuses -- patents on uses in a different category.\nSo I'm just asking, could you patent the\nisolated chromosome?\nMR. CASTANIAS: Again, I -- I perhaps am not\nmaking myself as clear as I should. In Section 101, a\npatent claim must be shown to be useful; and that -\nthat is a utility that it has to be shown -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Yes. Chromosomes are very\nuseful.\nMR. CASTANIAS: -- in any case.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE KAGAN: The first person who found a\nchromosome and isolated it, I think we can all say that\nthat was a very useful discovery.\nAnd the question is, can you then -- can the\nperson who found that chromosome and isolated it from\nthe body, could they have gone to the PTO?\nMR. CASTANIAS: If they -- if -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And the PTO seems very\npatent happy, so could, you know, would -- would they\nhave had a good patentability argument?\nMR. CASTANIAS: I think if -- to get through\nthe Section 101 gateway, if that chromosome had a\nspecific substantial and credible utility, in other\nwords, it could be used in some -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Yes, of course it does.\nMR. CASTANIAS: -- diagnostic way in the way\nthat we're talking about here, then yes, it would pass\nthrough the Section 101 gate. Whether it would pass\nthrough the Section 102 gate or the 103 gate, I don't\nhave any opinion on.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Would -- would -- okay.\nMR. CASTANIAS: And then there's the\nfurther -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And that's interesting -\nMR. CASTANIAS: Sure.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: -- because then it's not a\nquestion about, you know, breaking these covalent bonds\nor whatever Judge Lourie thought it was about. Right?\nSo, you know, if -- if not DNA, if -- if not\nthe -- the more smaller unit in the chromosome, you\nknow, we could just go up from there and talk about all\nkinds of parts of the human body, couldn't we? Couldn't\nwe get to, you know, the first person who found a liver?\nMR. CASTANIAS: I -- I think -- I think,\nJustice Kagan, you're really putting your finger on the\nproblem with this, again, I -- I keep wanting to refer\nto as the so-called Product of Nature Doctrine because I\ndon't believe that as a separate doctrine it really\nexists. It's just the flip side of the coin of\nsomething that shows a lack of invention.\nAnd, of course, that's where Section 103\ncomes into full force as the Chief Justice mentioned\nearlier in the argument. Section 103 allows you to make\ncomparisons to what was old and what was new. I don't\nthink the organ, the liver, gets past 103 in that\ncircumstance even if you say, well -\nJUSTICE BREYER: You are saying it gets past\n101.\nMR. CASTANIAS: Even if it gets through the\n101 -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's -- that's the\nproblem. I mean, all parts of the human body? Anything\nfrom inside the body that you snip out and isolate?\nMR. CASTANIAS: No.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And it gets through 101?\nDoes it have to -- I mean, that's actually what's\nbothering me.\nMR. CASTANIAS: Okay. So let -- let me try\nto help you with that. Because -- because the\ndistinction is between the liver or the kidney, which\nwas the one brought up in the federal circuit opinion,\nbut liver, kidney, you know, gallbladder, pick your\norgan. But it's the same thing. It is the same thing\nwhen it's inside the body and it's out. That's where\nour -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you're not\nsuggesting if you cut off a piece of the liver or a\npiece of the kidney that that somehow makes that piece\npatentable.\nMR. CASTANIAS: No. Absolutely not. It's\nthe same thing.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what's the\ndifference? I mean, if you cut off a piece of the whole\nin the kidney or liver, you're saying that's not\npatentable, but you take a gene and snip off a piece,\nthat is? What's the difference between the two -\nMR. CASTANIAS: I would say that -- I would\nsay that under -- under your existing decisions in\nChakrabarty, J.E.M., that set forth a broad\nunderstanding of Section 101 and an understanding of\nwhat is within the limited exception, then what -- I --\nI would -- I mean, honestly, I think that Section 103\ndoes this work better than Section 101, but to the point\nof Section 101, there's -- there is nothing different\nabout that piece in the body.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Ah. Then -- then watch\nwhat you're doing. That's very, very interesting,\nbecause, really, we are reducing, then, 101 to anything\nunder the sun, and -- and that, it seems to me, we've\nrejected more often than we've followed it.\nAnd particularly with a thing found in\nnature doctrine, because, of course, it doesn't just -\nhuman kidneys and so forth. Everything is inside\nsomething else. Plants, rocks, whatever you want. And\nso everything will involve your vast taking something\nout of some other thing where it is, if only the\nenvironment. And it's at that point that I look for\nsome other test than just that it was found within some\nother thing.\nMR. CASTANIAS: And I think, Justice Breyer,\nthere is where I've -- I've tried to explain to you\nabout the different functions, the different values. If\nyou think about patents as economic instruments, the\ndifferent economic values that come out of this, the\ndifferent things that patients now have as a result of\nthis human ingenuity, they didn't have the BRCA1\nisolated gene before the Myriad invention.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, we could have said\nthat with atomic energy, with electric, but so far the\nchoice -- electricity -- but so far the choice of the\npatent was that we have a uniform rule for all\nindustries.\nMR. CASTANIAS: Right, but in -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and that avoids\ngiving special industries special subsidies, which is\nvery important it seems to me.\nLet me ask you this, and it's consistent\nwith my -- my preface. If we were to accept the\nGovernment's position that the DNA is not patentable but\nthe cDNA is, would that give the industry sufficient\nprotection for innovation and research? And if not, why\nnot?\nMR. CASTANIAS: The -- the problem of making\nthat decision now is that so much has happened since\nthese gene patents issued and since the utility\nguidelines. I can't tell you for a certainty whether it\nwill hurt the industry as a general matter to not have\nisolated gene but only have cDNA patents.\nBut here's what I think it will hurt, and I\nthink it ultimately will hurt the doctrine that this\nCourt comes out of this case with. Because what you\nwill then be asking litigants to do and courts to do is\nto draw fine distinctions under Section 101 between,\nwell, how much more manipulation.\nMy friend on the other side used the term,\nin response to Justice Ginsburg, \"further manipulation\nis required to take it out of the product of nature.\"\nHe -- he said no alteration, to Justice Alito, would\nmake it a product of nature. But there's no dispute in\nthis case that there has been some alteration of the\nisolated DNA molecules.\nAnd that brings me back to the utility\nguidelines. This line was drawn. It was drawn by an\nexpert agency that sits at the intersection of law and\nscience, and it has said, without any apparent -- other\nthan the declarations and amicus briefs that have been\nput into this case -- without any apparent effect on the\nexplosion in biotechnology and the successful,\neconomically successful, technologically successful, and\nlife-saving industry that is at the heart of these\ninventions.\nThat has not -- those -- that parade of\nhorribles has not happened. And you don't have to\nhypothesize at this point because you've got all of\nthese years of experience between the time these patents\nissued and the time that this -- this challenge\nbelatedly came along.\nJustice Breyer, a point about no\nimpermissible preemption before I sit down. Your\nopinion for the Court in Mayo made that very much an\nimportant point, but I think what you -- what is\nimportant to understand here is that these patent claims\naren't for methods. They don't prevent -- present that\nproblem that the Court identified in that argument and\nin the argument in Bilski. These are for specific\nmolecules that exist in the physical world. That -\nthat concern that is present with method claims is not\nhere, these patents cover -- these patent claims cover\nonly what is claimed and no more.\nThere is no risk of a natural law or a\nphysical phenomenon like energy or electricity, neither\nof which falls within the statutory categories. There\nis no risk of anything being preempted other than what\nthe claims properly claim, which are human-made\ninventions of isolated molecules.\nAnd I think one last point to close on.\nIt's important to note that molecules have been patented\nfor a very long time. That's what drugs are. And drugs\nare often made by taking one molecule and another\nmolecule, both of which are known, reacting them in a\ntest tube, which is a very common thing, reactions have\nbeen around 100 years just like snipping has been, but\nthey make something new and useful and life saving from\nthat.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I don't\nunderstand how this is at all like that, because there\nyou're obviously combining things and getting something\nnew. Here you're just snipping, and you don't have\nanything new, you have something that is a part of\nsomething that has existed previous to your\nintervention.\nMR. CASTANIAS: Well, again,\nMr. Chief Justice, I -- I -- the discussion we had\nearlier, the -- in -- in fact, the sequence that's\nclaimed in Claim 1 of the '282 patent was not created by\nsnipping. If I can just conclude with one more\nsentence?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure.\nMR. CASTANIAS: Only once it was created can\na scientist ever know how and where to make the decision\nto snip.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Hansen, you have three minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MR. HANSEN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. HANSEN: Thank you, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is there some value to\nus striking down isolated DNA and upholding the cDNA?\nIf we were to do what the Government is proposing in\nthis case, what's the consequences?\nMR. HANSEN: Of -- of course there would be\nvalue in that in the sense that -- that, A, it\nreinforces the Product of Nature Doctrine, but more\nimportantly, the effect of the patents in this case\nallows Myriad to stop all research on a part of the\nhuman body. If you uphold the patents in this case,\nMyriad can -- has the authority given it by the\nGovernment to stop anyone from doing research on a piece\nof the human body. That would be a significant advance,\nif you were to -- to make it clear that was\nimpermissible.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now, how do you\nunderstand Judge Bryson's dissent with respect to cDNA?\nI think he's saying that a gene created from -- into\ncDNA as a whole is okay, but that he had a problem with\nthe description of that claim because it included 15\nnucleotide long segments or fragments which he says\nreoccur in nature.\nMR. HANSEN: Well, and yes, I -- I agree,\nYour Honor, that he was focusing on Claims 5 and 6,\nwhich are the ones that include 15 nucleotides or -- or\nlonger.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now, I'm making your job\nharder. How could they write it to do what he thinks\nwould be patentable?\nMR. HANSEN: Well, all -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So assuming we believe\nthat there is some human invention in this process;\nwhether it's obvious or not, separate question. But\nhe's not creating -- the cDNA is not in nature\nnaturally.\nSo make that assumption. Make the\nassumption that they can make a claim for it. How do we\navoid his problem?\nMR. HANSEN: Well -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I know you are helping\nyour adversary by answering this question.\nMR. HANSEN: That's fine, Your Honor. I\nthink that the -- all of the claims in this case, all\nnine claims that we are challenging include both\nfragments and the whole gene. So I don't think there is\nanything you can do with respect to these nine claims.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I am putting that aside.\nMR. HANSEN: I think by saying that when\ngenes are transformed in such a way that the scientist\ndecides their sequence rather than the nature deciding\ntheir sequence -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Only if they do a\nrecombinant DNA, that's what you are saying.\nMR. HANSEN: Right, right. Now I don't\nthink cDNA is recombinant DNA, that's what we've argued,\nbut that's -- that's at least one plausible way of\nlooking at it.\nThe genes in this case, the patents on the\ngenes in this case cover the genes of every man, woman,\nand child in the United States. And as I just said, it\ngives the -- the government has given Myriad the\nauthority to stop research on every one of our genes.\nThat simply can't be right.\nAnd I would like to make one other point\nwith respect to Dr. Lander's brief. On page 16 of Dr.\nLander's brief he discusses specifically that the BRCA\ngenes appear in the body with covalent bonds in\nfragments. There isn't any real -- there isn't any\nscientific dispute about that fact.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why don't you take\nanother minute. You weren't afforded an opportunity to\nuse the time you were reserved.\nMR. HANSEN: Well, I guess the only other\nthing I would say, Your Honor, is to respond to what I\nmay have left a misimpression with Justice Kagan's\nquestions. We agree that you could get a patent on a\nuse of the leaf that is pulled out of the Amazon or a\nplant that is pulled out of the Amazon. We don't\ndispute that. We don't think you cannot get a patent on\nthe plant itself just because you pulled it out of the\nground and took it to the United States.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
