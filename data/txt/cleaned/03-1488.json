Cochran.\nMr. Chemerinsky.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ERWIN CHEMERINSKY\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Good morning. Mr. Chief\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\nThe injunction in this case violates the most\nbasic principles of the First Amendment. It's a prior\nrestraint. It's a content-based restriction on speech.\nIt's vastly overbroad. It even restricts the speech of\nthose who are not a party to the lawsuit, such as\nPetitioner Ruth Craft.\nThe injunction in this case is inconsistent with\nthis country's unique and profound commitment that speech\nby public officials and public figures be open, robust,\nand uninhibited.\nOne way in which the injunction is clearly\nunconstitutional is in restricting the speech of those who\nare not a party to the lawsuit. For example, Ruth Craft\nis expressly restrained from ever speaking again about\nJohnnie Cochran even though she was never named as a party\nto the lawsuit. And, in fact, Cochran's attorney admitted\nat the beginning of trial, she wasn't a part of the\nlawsuit.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: How about you? You're in\ntrouble too, aren't you?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Yes, I am, Your Honor. This\ninjunction is so broad that if I talk about Johnnie\nCochran or this case on the sidewalk in front of this\nCourt or pass out copies of the brief or speak to any\nreporter, I am violating the terms of the injunction and I\ncould be held in contempt of court.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Chemerinsky, you speak\nabout the injunction, and the injunction has three parts.\nI thought that you were not challenging -- at least the\nquestion presented doesn't suggest you're challenging --\nthe first one that concerns distance, the 300 yard from\nCochran or his place of business, and the third one, which\nis an anti-harassment provision. Do I understand\ncorrectly that it is only the second one that you're\nchallenging?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: No, Your Honor. The question\npresented is that the injunction is unconstitutional.\nOne of the reasons why the injunction is\nunconstitutional is that it's based on speech that's\nprotected by the First Amendment. All of the statements\nthat were uttered by Mr. Tory are opinion protected by the\nFirst Amendment. There is not the requisite actual\nmalice. And so it's our position that the injunction\nitself is unconstitutional.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But your question is\npreventing all future speech about an admitted public\nfigure, and the first and third provisions of this\ninjunction do not prohibit all future speech.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Yes, Your Honor, that's\ncorrect. It's our position, though, that the injunction\nis based on speech that's protected by the First\nAmendment, and we believe that the question presented is\nthat the injunction is impermissible in its restriction of\nspeech.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But that isn't what you've\nsaid in the question presented. Why shouldn't we be\nlimited to answering the question presented? And that\nwould leave the other parts there.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Well, of course, you're\nlimited to the question presented. Our position, though,\nis that the injunction in its restriction of speech is\nunconstitutional. And one of the reasons why the\ninjunction is unconstitutional is that all of the speech\nthat occurred in this case is speech that's protected by\nthe First Amendment.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes, but you understand\nJustice Ginsburg's question surely, and I would imagine\nthat even if you prevail, nothing we would order would\naffect the first and third parts.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Well, Your Honor, certainly we\nbelieve that the injunction is most clearly\nunconstitutional in its overbreadth.\nWe believe also and separately the injunction is\nunconstitutional because injunctions are not a permissible\nremedy in a defamation case, especially concerning public\nofficials and public figures.\nBut it's also our position that the injunction\nis based on speech that's protected by the First\nAmendment, and thus, the injunction violates the First\nAmendment.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but that doesn't --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Mr. Chemerinsky, is it true\nthat your client intends to go on defaming Mr. Cochran?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: No, Your Honor. We don't\nbelieve our client has ever defamed Mr. Cochran. We\nbelieve that all of his speech is just opinion.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Does he intend to continue\nmaking the same comments that he made before?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: His exact words were that\nperhaps he would continue to express his view that Mr.\nCochran owes him money.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: All right. Now, let me ask\nyou this. Under your theory, if -- if the defendant is\njudgment-proof, does respondent have any remedy at all if\nthe statements are defamatory?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: What is it?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: There is, of course, a remedy.\nSince we're dealing here with a public figure, there is\nthe remedy of expressing views which this Court has said\nin Gertz v. Welch is available to a public figure. There\nis a damage judgment that's available. Certainly, Your\nHonor, there can't be a different rule --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But if -- if the defendant is\njudgment-proof, what good does that do?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Your Honor, there is a damage\njudgment that forever would be available against the\nperson. And it cannot be, Your Honor, that those who are\npoor will have injunctions --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well -- well, your -- your\nanswer should be to Justice O'Connor there is no effective\nlegal remedy under your theory of the case.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: No, Your Honor, I disagree\nwith that.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, you -- you say he has\nthe remedy of -- of counter-speech. We're talking --\nthat's really that doesn't answer the question. The\nquestion is, is there anything he can get from the courts\nother than a damage remedy, and your answer I think is no.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: That's correct, Your Honor.\nFrom the courts, he can get a damage remedy but I don't\naccept that a damage remedy is inadequate just because a\nperson may be poor. The damage remedy will be that they'd\nbe collected for the person who gets assets in the future.\nAlso, as I was saying to Justice O'Connor, it\ncan't be --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it -- it seems to me\nthat that really avoids the problem -- the problem.\nSo suppose we disagree with you about that.\nThen it's true that there is no -- there is no legal\nremedy that he can get.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: But then, Justice Kennedy, it\ncan't be the rule that poor people have their speech\nenjoined, but those with assets can continue to speak in\nthe future.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it also can't be the rule\nthat poor people can defame ad libitum and -- and people\nwho have money cannot. I mean, that's -- that's not a\nfair rule either.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: No, Your Honor, but that's why\nthere would be, of course, the ability of a court to issue\na damage judgment. There are many instances in which\ndamage judgments can't be collected.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's worthless against a --\nagainst a person who has no assets.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: But that's true everywhere in\nthe legal system, Your Honor.\nAnd I would also argue here that none of Mr.\nTory's statements were defamatory. I would point --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Now that's another one that\nis in your brief. You say that these were statements of\nopinion not fact. But that surely is not presented in\nyour question. You -- you don't -- there were findings\nmade that these statements were defamatory, and your\nquestion presented does not seem to me to encompass at\nall the question whether these statements were defamatory.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: I would disagree, Your Honor.\nThe question presented is whether this injunction, that\nforever stops speech, violates the First Amendment. One\nreason why --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not -- not this injunction.\nThe question presented is whether a permanent injunction\nas a remedy in a defamation -- in a defamation action,\npreventing all future speech about an admitted public\nfigure, violates the First Amendment. There's no\nsuggestion in that that you claim that in this particular\ncase there was no defamation. I -- I just don't think\nit's fairly included within the question.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Your Honor, what I am saying\nis that the question presented does ask whether this\ninjunction, which permanently restricts speech --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, it doesn't. It says\nwhether a permanent injunction as a remedy in a defamation\naction preventing all future speech about an admitted\npublic figure violates the First Amendment.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: We would argue --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There's nothing about this\nparticular injunction which is based upon speech that is\nnot defamation. There's nothing in there about that.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Your Honor, our position is\nthat question asks whether an injunction violates the\nFirst Amendment, and certainly it is about this case. And\nour position is that all of the speech that was expressed\nin this case is opinion. And it's important --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, if that's\nso --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well -- well, there really --\nthere are findings against you, and to say that a lawyer\nis a crook, a liar, and a thief and you're trying to tell\nus that that's not defamatory, I mean, I -- I think we\nshould just proceed on -- on some other basis for this\nargument. We have other questions to discuss.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Sure. But, Your Honor, I want\nto just respond to that. The exact statement there was --\nand I'll quote it for you and it is on page 54 of the\njoint appendix. Johnnie is a crook, a liar, and a thief.\nCan a lawyer go to heaven? Luke 11:46. Your Honor, this\nCourt has said, for example, in Greenbelt Cooperative that\ncharging somebody with blackmail is expressing opinion.\nIn Letter Carriers v. Austin this Court said calling\nsomebody a traitor is opinion.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. That -- that --\nwhat you've quoted many -- much of this I wouldn't repeat\nin polite company. You've reported one of the most mild,\nand in fact there are two findings. One, this is not just\ndefamation. It was an action for defamation, as well as a\ntort of invasion of privacy. And there is a finding,\nfirst, that this was done intentionally to create a\nnegatively charged and ominous environment, and this is\nnot a matter of speech-related issues. It is simply the\nuse of false and defamatory and privacy-invading\ncommunications, or worse, or attempt to improperly coerce\npayment of money in tribute for -- for desisting from that\ntype of activity. All right. Now, those are the\nfindings against you.\nSo suppose I agreed with you hypothetically that\nthat, with all these findings, is nonetheless protected by\nthe First Amendment. All right? Now, suppose, in other\nwords, you convince me of that. Now, I want to know how\nto write my opinion on that assumption to protect what I\nwas worried about yesterday, that a woman who has a\nboyfriend or a husband is being continuously harassed in\n-- with methods similar to this one. See, it's easy to\ntranspose those two cases which are both on my mind.\nAnd I want to know if in your opinion that these\nrestraining orders, which try to prevent this kind of\nthing, among others, are unconstitutional, if there's a\nway of distinguishing them, if you could possibly win on\nwhat theory. And what I'm trying to get you to do is to\nsay is it absolute. Are there limits? If so, what?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: I would suggest three\ndifferent ways in which you could write the opinion that\ndistinguished the case.\nThe first is that this injunction is vastly\noverbroad, that even if there can be an injunction to say\nthat Ulysses Tory and Ruth Craft can never again say\nanything about Johnnie Cochran in any public forum, that I\ncan never speak about Johnnie Cochran would violate the\nFirst Amendment.\nA second way of distinguishing is that\ndefamation is different, that when the First Amendment was\nadopted, the clear history was that above all it was to\nprevent prior restraints, and that injunctions were not\npermitted in defamation actions. That's quite different\nthan a harassment action.\nAnd third, as I've argued, what makes this\ndifferent is the basis for this injunction is speech\nprotected by the First Amendment.\nWith regard to the findings that you referred\nto, you mentioned two.\nThe first is invasion of privacy. Your Honor,\nthe only privacy claim in this case was false light\ninvasion of privacy. California law is clear. When there\nis a defamation action and a false light claim, the false\nlight claim is automatically dismissed as duplicative when\nit's based on the same fact.\nThe second basis you pointed --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Mr. Chemerinsky, this\ncase comes up to us from a California appellate court.\nSurely they know California law better than we do.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Yes, Your Honor, but they did\nnot base their decision on the privacy claim because\nCalifornia law is clear that when it's false light\ninvasion of privacy brought together with a defamation\naction, the false light claim is dismissed. That's a\nCalifornia case, Couch v. San Jose Unified School\nDistrict.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, we're not going\nto debate among ourselves over what California law is.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: No, Your Honor. All I'm\nsaying is it's important to be clear about what the\nprivacy claim is. As I was saying to Justice Breyer,\nthere may be privacy claims that give rise to injunctions.\nHarassment claims may give rise to injunctions, but not\nthe privacy claim in this case which was just about false\nlight, which even the California Court of Appeal admitted\nis treated together with defamation.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose this picketing had\ntaken place in front of his house, every day in front of\nhis house.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Your Honor, under Frisby v.\nSchultz, that would be a different situation. Under\nFrisby v. Schultz, this Court said --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. Well -- well, then\nthis -- this argument you're making, oh, never, never, the\nsky is falling and so forth, I -- I think we have to be\nmore precise here. I think if it were in front of his\nhouse, it would be different.\nIf he had alleged $10 worth of monetary damages,\nit would be disparaging the quality of his services, which\nwould be a trade libel, and the Restatement at least -- I\ndon't know California law -- says that you -- would you\nagree that you can enjoin a trade libel --\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Well, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- that disparages quality of\ngoods to the serious injury of a -- of a business?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Actually, Your Honor, the vast\nmajority of cases have held that you cannot have an\ninjunction for product defamation. And so I think while\nthat's a different and more difficult question, most\ncourts have said no even there.\nAnd Your Honor, I'm not saying there can never\nbe injunctions. But I am saying that this Court has said\nthere's a very strong and heavy presumption against\ninjunctions, and that never, not once in the 214-year\nhistory of the First Amendment, has this Court ever upheld\nan injunction as a remedy in a defamation action.\nAnd, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, if -- if this under --\nthe underlying claim seems to be that Mr. Cochran is\nessentially being blackmailed; that is, this -- this --\nyour client wants tribute to go away. And you say, yes,\nbut it's defamation. It's a defamation action.\nTherefore, damages is the only remedy.\nIs there nothing that one can do to stop another\nfrom engaging in blackmail?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Yes, Your Honor, there is. If\nthis was blackmail or extortion, Johnnie Cochran could\nhave filed a criminal complaint with the police. He could\nhave civilly sued for blackmail or extortion. But, Your\nHonor, this wasn't extortion.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What kind of a jurisprudence\nis it that a person can go to jail but that he's freed\nfrom an injunction? I mean, why -- why do we do this?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: But Your Honor, that's\nbecause this Court has said that injunctions of speech are\neven worse than criminal penalties. I would refer this\nCourt --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but why -- is that true\nin every case? I mean, take the timid person who's not\nsure -- I know the law doesn't protect the timid person in\nthe first area, but let's -- let's assume the timid person\nis not sure. So he wants -- he wants to get an equitable\nruling first, declaratory judgment. He -- and he would\ntake an injunction. That's certainly much easier than\ngoing to jail.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: But, Your Honor, I'd remind\nyou of this Court's language in the Vance v. Universal\nAmusement where the Court said presumption against prior\nrestraints is heavier and the degree of protection broader\nthan against limits on criminal penalties.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I know, but I'm asking you why\nthat -- why that should be. If -- if you asked a person\nnot familiar with our jurisprudence, which is worse,\nhaving an injunction that you can argue about or going to\njail, I -- I think they would say that going to jail is\nworse.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: But, Your Honor, in terms of\nthe First Amendment, there are reasons why an injunction\nhas always been regarded as worse.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Always? Do you want to apply\nthat to an harassment action too against a woman who has\nthe restraining order? No restraining orders in divorce\ncases in case they're against speech because even if\nviolence is threatened, even if -- et cetera. I mean, how\n-- how far do you want to push that principle?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Your Honor, I don't want to\npush the principle at all to harassment. I believe that\ninjunctions are completely appropriate in harassment\nactions. I think it is quite important to note that the\nCalifornia harassment statute expressly excludes speech\nwhich is protected by the First Amendment as being a basis\nfor harassment.\nThe history of the First Amendment is different.\nTo go back to Justice Kennedy's question, it's always been\nthought that an injunction strikes at the very heart of\nthe First Amendment because, as Justice Scalia pointed\nout --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why can't we say that speech\nthat is -- is being used for extortion is different, just\nas speech which is being used for harassment is different?\nAnd just as you can get an injunction for the latter, you\nought to be able to get an injunction for the former. Not\nall speech, but only when speech is being used to -- to\nextort money.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Yes, Your Honor, there can be\nan injunction for extortion, but this was not extortion.\nThere was never the criminal complaint. There was never\nthe civil action. And it didn't meet the requirements for\nextortion. Your Honor, California law, Penal Code section\n518, defines extortion as, quote, the obtaining of\nproperty from another with his consent induced by a\nwrongful use of force or fear. There wasn't the wrongful\nuse of force or fear.\nNow, it may be that Ulysses Tory was speaking --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Here I think there was -- why\nisn't there a use of fear when, you know, you're afraid of\nthis person destroying your business by calling you a liar\nand a cheat? Wasn't Mr. Cochran afraid of that -- of that\nhappening?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Your Honor, this Court is\nrequired to do an independent review of the record under\nBose v. Consumers Union. There's no indication that Mr.\nCochran suffered that fear from Mr. Tory being outside.\nIt's true that Mr. Tory may have believed that he was owed\nmoney by Johnnie Cochran and was also trying to encourage\nMr. Cochran to pay. But this Court has said in cases like\nNAACP v. Claiborne Hardware speech does not lose its\nprotective character simply because it may embarrass\nothers or coerce them into action.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Chemerinsky, the district\n-- I mean, the trial court made certain findings and I'm\nlooking at page 42 of the joint appendix. The first is\nthat these statements were actually made for the purpose\nof inducing Cochran to pay Tory amounts of money which\nTory was not entitled. That's one finding. And then\nfinding 24, despite repeated requests, Tory has refused to\ncease picketing unless he was paid money -- a monetary\nsettlement by Cochran. And then 27 that says this is\nsimply use of false and privacy-invading communications to\ncoerce or attempt to improperly coerce payment of money in\ntribute for desisting from that type of activity. And\nthose sound like findings.\nIt's true that the label of extortion has been\nput on it, but it certainly does sound like the -- that\nthe purpose of the speech was to extract money not owed.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: But, Your Honor, since this is\na defamation action, not an extortion action, the rules\nunder the First Amendment for defamation have to apply.\nUnder the rules of the First Amendment for defamation,\ninjunctions are not available to public officials or\npublic figures.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, so this finding -- the\ncourt shouldn't have made these findings? It was\nirrelevant?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Well, Your Honor, I believe\nthat the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Was there an objection to the\ntestimony that established this?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Yes, Your Honor. Mr. Tory,\nwho was appearing pro se in the trial court, from the very\noutset objected that he was being held liable for speech\nprotected by the First Amendment.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but it seems to me -- and I\nthink what bothers me is -- is what bothers Justice\nKennedy. It seems to me that the argument you just made\nis an argument that given the pleadings in this case, the\nfindings that Justice Ginsburg just quoted really were\nirrelevant findings, that they should not have gotten --\nthat the court should not have gotten into extortion and\nso on and should not have provided a remedy for extortion,\nquite apart from the fact of whether it's an appropriate\nremedy, constitutional or otherwise. And that, it seems\nto me, is -- is something that we -- we are not here to\ntouch. That's a question of California law.\nWhat we are here to touch is, number one,\nwhether the injunction is overbroad with respect to pure\nspeech, and maybe we are here -- that we have a question\nabout the -- the breadth of the case we took. But maybe\nwe are here to determine whether there can be an\ninjunction against blackmail or harassing activities.\nBut I -- I think we're not here to decide\nwhether California could have gotten to the question of\nblackmail, harassment, and injunction for that. Do you\nagree with that?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: No, Your Honor. I certainly\nagree with the first point. One issue before this Court\nis whether this injunction is overbroad, and it clearly is\nin terms of the breadth of speech that's regulated and\nwhose regulated.\nBut as to the second point that you make, this\nis a defamation action, and thus the issue before this\nCourt, clearly presented in the question presented, is\nwhether a permanent injunction can be issued in a\ndefamation case remedy when the plaintiff is a public\nfigure.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it can certainly -- the\n-- the issue is certainly before us as to whether such an\ninjunction can be issued with respect to defamation pure\nand simple. But the findings that Justice Ginsburg has --\nhas read and part of the order in question here seems to\ngo beyond pure defamation. It goes to the kind of\ndemonstrative activity which plausibly is found to have\nbeen in aid of extortion. And that, it seems to me, is an\nentirely different question.\nWe may -- I'm not saying we will, but we may\nagree with you that it's overbroad. We may agree with you\nthat as to pure speech, you can't enjoin it. But that\ndoesn't necessarily mean that every part of this\ninjunction is wrong, and it seems to me it is irrelevant\nas to whether the -- the State of -- the courts of\nCalifornia should have reached extortion.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: I would disagree in this way,\nYour Honor. Bose v. Consumers Union makes clear that when\nit is a defamation action, this Court and every appellate\ncourt has to do an independent review of the record.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: With respect to the defamation,\npure and simple. I agree with you. We -- there is a\nheightened standard of review, but I don't think that\naddresses one way or the other what the standard should be\nwhen an action in the State courts has been treated as an\naction both for defamation and for extortion or\nharassment.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: But, Your Honor, it was not\ntreated here as an action for extortion or harassment --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I understand. Mr. Chemerinsky,\nlet me put the question this way. Suppose a State does\nnot have a civil action for extortion. It provides\ncriminal remedies but no civil action for extortion. Why\ndoes the Constitution not permit us to treat, in that\nState at least, a civil action for defamation which has\nwithin it elements of distortion differently from pure\ndefamation?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Your Honor, I would say the\nhistory of the First Amendment is different. A State can\ncreate a civil action then for extortion at the urging of\nthis Court, but if you open the door to injunctions in\ndefamation cases, then there's the possibility that in any\ndefamation case, somebody might plead something about\nextortion, and injunctions will not be rare but will be\nthe norm.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this -- may I ask\nthis question? Supposing the only thing he did was to\ncarry a sign that said Johnnie is a crook, a liar, and a\nthief, and the trial judge finds that is false, and he's\ncarrying it in a sign, could the trial judge enjoin him\nfrom carrying that sign in front of Johnnie Cochran's\noffice?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: No, Your Honor, because the\nlaw is clear that injunctions are not a permissible remedy\nin defamation cases.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What's the best authority you\nhave for that proposition?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Near v. Minnesota would be the\nbest authority where this Court said clearly that\ninjunctive relief should not be awarded in a defamation\ncase.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Add to Justice Stevens' -- add\nto Justice Stevens' hypothetical that he shows that he's\nlosing some clients.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: But, Your Honor, even -- yes,\nYour Honor. But I don't think that changes the\nhypothetical in terms of enjoining the defamatory speech.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Would you add too that\nhe's judgment-proof?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Well, again, as I said to\nJustice O'Connor, I don't think it can matter whether he's\njudgment-proof because we can't have a different rule that\nwe allow poor people's speech to enjoin and not wealthy\npeople.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You're saying -- you're saying\nthat a State cannot constitutionally prohibit someone from\nmaking false statements in front of the business that\ncauses the business to lose money.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Well, Your Honor, there are\nother causes of action that may allow that. If it could\nbe --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So I'm -- my question is, is\nthis constitutional to prohibit this conduct?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Not in a defamation action,\nYour Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That's --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- that's not the question.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But what is your authority for\nthat proposition?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Well, I would say that the\nauthority comes from the fact that never in 214 years has\nthis Court ever upheld an injunction in a defamation case.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Have we ever set aside an\ninjunction that did that?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Well, not under those facts.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Have we done it either way?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: No. That's correct, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Have we ever -- have we ever\nconsidered a case where there's a strong element of\nextortion involved?\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: I would say yes, extortion for\nAustin v. Keith. There was speech to pressure, and yet\nthis Court said even though the speech was to pressure,\nit's still protected by the First Amendment.\nI'd like to save the rest of the time for\nrebuttal, if that's permissible.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Very well, Mr.\nChemerinsky.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Mr. Cole, we'll hear\nfrom you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN B. COLE\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. COLE: Mr. Chief Justice Rehnquist, and may\nit please the Court:\nFor years, Mr. Tory has relentlessly targeted\nJohnnie Cochran with a pattern of defamatory speech in a\npublic forum for purpose of causing Mr. Cochran to pay Mr.\nTory money in tribute for ceasing from this unprotected\nactivity. He admitted at trial he intended to engage in\nthis conduct. He was doing it just so he could be paid\nmoney, and when asked if he would continue to do so, he\nstated he would.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, do you -- do you defend\nthe injunction in its entirety?\nMR. COLE: Yes --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: In other words, the -- the --\nMr. Chemerinsky didn't have too much chance to -- to get\nvery far into it, but one of his points was that there was\n-- quite apart from any injunction against picketing,\nharassment, et cetera, there was an injunction simply\nagainst speech on a given subject directed to a lot of\npeople with no limit of time. With respect to that last\naspect, do you defend the injunction?\nMR. COLE: Yes. First of all, I don't believe\nit was directed to a lot of people. As this --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it was directed, number\none, to a named person who was not a party to the case,\nand it was directed to agents and employees of -- of the\nnamed party. So, I -- I assume that Mr. Cochran probably\nhas a fair number of agents and employees, so it does seem\nlike a large number of people.\nMR. COLE: I believe this Court said in Madsen\nthat that would raise an abstract controversy that Mr.\nTory doesn't have standing to attack the injunction for\nother persons who are not before the court. No aider or\nabetter has ever been served with this injunction. Ms.\nCraft has never been served with this injunction. Only\nMr. Tory. So I don't believe --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, let me ask you a law\nschool question. In -- given the injunction on its face,\nwith that breadth, is that injunction defensible with\nrespect not to picketing, not to harassment, simply to\nspeech in a public place?\nMR. COLE: I defend the injunction, and\nrespondent defends the injunction on the ground that it is\nconduct that was being enjoined --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I -- I asked you --\nMR. COLE: -- from the use of unprotected\nspeech.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- to exclude the -- the issue\nof conduct. I said forget the injunction for a moment\nwith respect to picketing, with respect to harassment, and\nwe'll say with respect to blackmail, since that has come\nup. Forget that. Simply take the portion of the\ninjunction that enjoins speech by these people,\nassociates, agents, et cetera. On the subject matter of\nthe injunction for all time, do you defend that\ninjunction?\nMR. COLE: Yes, we defend the injunction.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Let's take specifically the\nwords of the injunction. It's against orally uttering\nstatements about Cochran, just orally uttering statements\nabout Cochran.\nMR. COLE: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You say that someone can be\nenjoined --\nMR. COLE: Based upon the unique facts of this\ncase, Justice Ginsburg, I say somebody can be enjoined. I\ndon't say that in the abstract.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, you can't square that\nwith the Near case at all. I -- I mean, the -- the\ninjunction on its face in part 2 has the appearance of\nbeing overly broad.\nMR. COLE: But in Near, they set forth certain\nfactors, and those factors included that it was not a\nprivate redress of private wrongs. The information was of\nlegitimate public concern. Neither of those elements are\npresent in this action.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't know that.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: You don't --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't know what future\nspeech is going to be. His future thing may be, you know,\nJohnnie Cochran shouldn't be elected mayor of San\nFrancisco. That would be a -- a question of public\nconcern.\nMR. COLE: But, Justice Scalia, what I'm relying\non is the fact that he has engaged in 3 years in a pattern\nof continuing, repetitive conduct.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what -- what you're\nsaying is that an -- an injunction can be overbroad based\non past wrongful conduct. And there is simply no\nauthority for that proposition.\nMR. COLE: I'm not suggesting that this\ninjunction is necessarily overboard based upon that\nproposition because I believe there are --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But we have just pointed out\nthat it -- that it -- it prohibits lawful, harmless,\ntruthful speech.\nMR. COLE: I disagree with that, Justice\nKennedy.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, it does on its face. I\nmean, it is clearly overbroad. Now, what should we do\nabout that?\nMR. COLE: Well, if you're asking me, based upon\nthe breadth of the injunction, what I -- if -- if there\nwas -- are you asking me what I would do to modify the\ninjunction? You could merely strike -- you could leave\nintact paragraph 2 and you could strike simply subsections\n(ii) and (iii) as being unconstitutionally overbroad.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Now, let -- let me ask you\nabout that. Let's -- let's assume, for the moment, that a\nmajority of the Court would find that some of these\nprovisions are overly broad. Is there any authority that\ntells us what to do next? This is not like a statute\nwhere we have to save the statute. Do we have any\nobligation to save the injunction? Send it back and let\nit be done. Let it be done all over again. I mean, why\n-- why should we rewrite it up here? Do you have any\nauthority that requires us or permits us to do that?\nMR. COLE: Yes. In -- in Madsen, Justice\nKennedy, you struck -- the Court struck certain provisions\nas being unconstitutionally overbroad and left certain\nintact. So there's no reason why you can't look at this\ninjunction, which clearly does not attack paragraph 1.\nThe -- they do not attack paragraph 1. They do not attack\nparagraph 3. They only level their attack at paragraph 2,\nand paragraph 2, by striking subsections (ii) and (iii),\nwould then be limited to the exact conduct in issue, which\nis picketing.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So -- so if -- before leaving\nthat point, what the injunction prohibits is that Tory and\nthose acting in concert, cooperation, or participation\nwith him from, in a public forum, orally uttering\nstatements about Cochran. All right. That's what it\nsays.\nNow, do you think that if Tory or someone acting\nin cooperation with him says, I've had a change of heart,\nJohnnie Cochran is a marvelous person, and he says that on\ntelevision -- do you think that individual at that time\nhas violated this injunction?\nMR. COLE: Absolutely not.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Absolutely not. Because?\nBecause?\nMR. COLE: First of all, that's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It said the words. They\nviolated the words. It was a statement, but he has not\nviolated the injunction because?\nMR. COLE: Because I don't believe that's a\npublic forum.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, no, no. He does it in a\npublic forum. In fact, he hires Disney Hall.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: And moreover, he gets on stage\nand announces it. Okay? There's no problem about a\npublic forum. So, now, why doesn't it violate the\ninjunction?\nMR. COLE: Your -- Your Honor, I believe there\nare alternative channels of communication here.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. I thought what you were\ngoing to say -- but you're not. So I'm very interested in\nthat, and I'm glad I asked. I thought you were going to\nsay when it says uttering statements, it means statements\nof the kind or identical to those we have identified\nearlier in this opinion.\nMR. COLE: Well, I was --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But, now, you haven't said\nthat. I said it, and I think it's too late for you to say\nit.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. COLE: I think I said it when I said there\nwas a continuing pattern of repetitive conduct under\nPittsburgh Press, over 3 years that that was the conduct\nthat he has engaged in. And that was clearly the purpose\nof this injunction, Justice Breyer. We know that. And\nthe purpose of the injunction is to enjoin conduct that's\ndesigned to extort money from Mr. Cochran.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: In more than one case,\nwe've said that an injunction has to be precise and clear\nand not leaving things to the imagination.\nMR. COLE: Well, I think this is precise and\nclear. Based upon the breadth of the injunction, it's\nvery clear. Based upon this man's prior repetitive\nconduct of defaming Mr. Cochran with unprotected speech\nfor the purpose of attempting to extort money from him --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it's -- it's --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But nothing in the injunction\nrefers to prior conduct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's right. It's --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The injunction just speaks for\nitself. It doesn't say what -- doing what you used to do\nor anything like that.\nMR. COLE: The injunction --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You cannot picket Cochran or\nCochran's law firm. Period.\nMR. COLE: If we restricted the injunction to\nspecific words used such as you cannot picket Johnnie\nCochran's law firm and say he's a crook, liar, and thief,\nthe response will be that he'll come up with five new\nwords to defame Mr. Cochran for purposes of extorting --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, maybe there are\ndifferent grades of specificity. Maybe it doesn't meet\nprecisely the same words, but I think there are other ways\nto draft it that say no picketing. Period.\nMR. COLE: Well, there could be no picketing for\npurposes of -- no -- which contains defamatory speech for\npurposes of extorting Mr. Cochran. But --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: All I'm suggesting is just\ndraft it -- just excising (ii) and (iii) from paragraph 2\nwould not necessarily solve the problem completely.\nBecause subparagraph (i) says picketing Cochran or\nCochran's law firm, which is a pretty broad prohibition.\nMR. COLE: Well, I would disagree based upon the\nprior -- continuing course of -- of repetitive conduct and\nthe fact that this -- over a period 3 years, once a week,\nthis man spent 3 to 4 hours a day of his time defaming Mr.\nCochran at his law office. When we enjoined him from\ndoing so at his law office, he moved it to the Los Angeles\nSuperior Court.\nAnd I think the fact that Mr. Cochran is a\npublic figure actually favors the breadth of this\ninjunction. If this was not a public figure, then the\npublic forum issue would not be as effective. But because\nMr. Cochran is a public figure, the only way he gets\nprotection is in the public forum because this gentleman\ncould move his picketing down to west L.A., Santa Monica\nBoulevard, nowhere near a courthouse, and to a public\nfigure he can inflict the same damage to reputation. And\nthat is the problem we were contending with in attempting\nto draft an injunction that was not overbroad and yet\ncould control Mr. Tory --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You -- you did draft this\ninjunction. It wasn't the -- an inspiration from the\njudge unaided by your advocacy. Is that so?\nMR. COLE: It --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: This -- the terms of this\ninjunction.\nMR. COLE: Were aided -- were aided by my\nadvocacy, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Aided and abetted.\nMR. COLE: Well said, Justice Rehnquist.\nWhat I'm suggesting here is Mr. Cochran would\nhave been faced with -- he has no remedy. Injunctive\nrelief is the only remedy. And he would be faced with a\nmultiplicity of actions --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why? Why couldn't he just be\nenjoined from -- from similar defamation? I mean, this --\nthis enjoins him from -- from true speech. At least he\ncould -- he could have been enjoined from in the future\ndefaming Cochran in the same manner. And if he did that,\nthen -- then he could be punished.\nMR. COLE: I think we would be -- that\ninjunction then would be attacked on being vague or\nambiguous, that Mr. Tory wouldn't have sufficient notice\nas to what he was allowed to say and not allowed to say.\nI guarantee you that was --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if -- if that's so, then\nmaybe Mr. Chemerinsky is right. We -- we shouldn't have\ninjunctions. If you're saying that injunctions can't be\nnarrowly tailored, it seems to me that you're playing\nright into the argument that the petitioner is making.\nMR. COLE: No. I think they can be tailored. I\njust don't think they can be that narrowly tailored. And\nI don't think in this case, which I believe that the test\nwe should be applying if we're going to balance, is this\n-- there's no need for this injunction to be drafted in\nthe least restrictive means.\nI also continue to advance the argument that\nthis -- the facts of this case are unique. It's the use\nof speech to engage in unprotected conduct. This -- this\nconduct is not protected by the First Amendment. The\nconduct of attempting to extort money from Mr. Cochran is\nnot protected. If that is not protected, then I believe\nwe can craft --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: You can -- you can\ncertainly have, you know, some unprotected speech in\nconnection with extortion, like give me $5 million or I'll\nshoot you. But that -- this was a far cry from that. In\nother words, it isn't just addressing the victim and\nsaying give me something. It's denouncing the victim,\nwhich gets into free speech here.\nMR. COLE: It certainly does, Justice Rehnquist.\nBut what I am suggesting is there was no remedy for Mr.\nCochran that would have avoided a multiplicity of actions\nother than to draft the injunction in a form that would\npreclude Mr. Tory from engaging in the same conduct\nwithout regard to whether it was -- and to let him know\nclearly -- give him a safe harbor as to what he could and\ncould not say.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: But the injunction\nisn't limited to the same conduct.\nMR. COLE: But I don't think it needs to be\nbecause of the pattern and practice that this man has\nengaged in over 3 years.\nAnd if we take the example, which is so he has a\nchange of heart and suddenly he now wants to praise Mr.\nCochran and that's become his -- and he's going to promote\nhim as mayor of San Francisco, he can certainly go into\nthe court and modify the injunction.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: I thought he lived in\nL.A.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think he'd like to get him up\nto San Francisco.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. COLE: He can certainly seek to modify the\ninjunction, and that, as I pointed out in a subsequent\nletter brief, there's -- California doesn't adopt the\ncollateral bar rule. And therefore, he has a check and\nbalance in this case. Under People v. Gonzales, 12\nCal.4th 805, the collateral bar rule has no application in\nthe State of California. So in the unlikely event that\nMr. Tory was engaged in speech praising Mr. Cochran, one,\nand two, in the -- in the more unlikely event that someone\nwas going to attempt to cite him for contempt for engaging\nin protected speech, he could contest, under First\nAmendment grounds, the enforcement of this injunction in\nthe State of California because the collateral bar rule\nhas no impact.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm -- I'm baffled by\nthat. What you're saying is that the injunction -- we're\njust all wasting our time? The injunction doesn't mean\nanything?\nMR. COLE: No, no, no, no. Justice Kennedy, all\nI'm saying is --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I fell off the track\nhere.\nMR. COLE: All I'm -- all I'm saying is that if\nthe collateral bar rule was in effect, you would waive\nyour right to contest. You don't have a right to contest\nthe constitutionality of the injunction on First Amendment\ngrounds or constitutional grounds when it's seek to be\nenforced against you. That's not a defense in a contempt\nproceeding. California does not adopt that rule.\nTherefore, Mr. Tory can always -- if he is engaged in\nprotected speech, he can easily contend --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Oh, yes, but he's different\nfrom other citizens because he's at -- he's at risk of a\ncontempt citation.\nMR. COLE: I don't dispute that.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, his speech is being\nchilled with -- with respect to protected speech.\nMR. COLE: But there's nothing unusual --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So the collateral bar rule\ndoesn't help you at all because he's subject to a contempt\ncitation.\nMR. COLE: He's subject to it, but there's a\ncheck and balance there in terms of when you balance, the\npotential remedy for Mr. Cochran -- what -- what is going\nto give Mr. Cochran the remedy he needs? And if we\nbalance that against the -- the breadth of this\ninjunction, I think we have to look at -- one of the\nbiggest concerns about prior restraints, when analyzed in\nterms of injunctions, is the collateral bar rule.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But it would be so easy. I\nmean, it's virtually no burden. I take it what you're\nsaying is that this injunction in paragraph 2 at its heart\nis aimed at in public forums, keeping insults suggesting\nhe was a crook against Johnnie Cochran unless you pay me\n$10,000. Then I'll stop. Okay? Now, at its heart,\nthat's what it's aimed at.\nMR. COLE: That's exactly --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And you are saying if in fact\nit's ever enforced outside that heartland, you can have a\ndefense. It would violate the First Amendment.\nBut since it's so easy just to write those words\nwe just said right in paragraph 2, why shouldn't the judge\nhave to do it? It's so easy. Say this is aimed at the\nheartland just as I said it and you said it, and it\ndoesn't apply outside of it.\nMR. COLE: And I have no dispute with that,\nJustice Breyer. I agree that was the whole purpose for\nthe injunction. That's the basis of the injunction. And\nyou could always remand for further proceedings,\nconsistent with any opinion you would write, that the\ninjunction has to be tailored to -- to deal with\ndefamatory conduct, which is designed to extort or with\nthe intent to extort. And I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's what he's arguing.\nYou're -- you're conceding that it's overbroad.\nMR. COLE: I'm saying if this Court -- well, I'm\ngleaning the impression that this Court thinks it's\noverbroad.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Ah, you're very perceptive.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. COLE: And having gleaned that perception,\nI'm trying to suggest that, number one, there was no\nattack on paragraphs 1 and 3, and now we're focused on\nparagraph 2. And paragraph 2 can be tailored, as you have\nindicated, Justice Scalia, I think consistent with First\nAmendment issues.\nAnd I think it's important to point out that if\nwe take away injunctive relief in a defamation action in\nthis day -- modern age --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You're sort of saying the\nopposite of what your opponent said. If we take it away,\nhas it ever been there?\nMR. COLE: It's never been there.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What are we taking away?\nMR. COLE: I -- I agree it's never -- you've\nnever found it there and you've never said it can't be\nthere.\nJUSTICE BREYER: How does California work in\nthat respect? Because what I've been thinking of in my\nmind is that maybe we shouldn't decide this in terms of\nState law boxes, that California seems to have an action.\nLet's call it a buzz action to get away from words. And\nwhat that action is it's a defamation but a certain kind.\nIt's defamation accompanied by extortion. And when you\nhave defamation accompanied by extortion -- call it\nwhatever you want -- an injunction is proper in these\ncircumstances.\nNow, can we decide it in such a way that we're\nnot talking about all defamation actions? We are talking\nabout this beast in California which uses the word\ndefamation but also finds injunction and therefore issues\n-- also finds extortion and therefore issues an\ninjunction.\nMR. COLE: Yes, I think that you could limit the\ninjunction to defamatory speech of a similar nature\ndesigned to extort.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Would -- would that make Mr.\nCochran happy? What -- what's the big deal about\nextortion? I mean, suppose this same conduct occurs in\nthe future, but he doesn't say I'll stop if you give me a\nlot of money. He just pickets every day and says Cochran\nis a shyster, don't do any business with Cochran. Do you\nthink Mr. Cochran would be any -- any happier simply\nbecause the guy says I'll -- hasn't said I'll stop if you\npay me $10,000?\nMR. COLE: No, and I think that would be subject\nto the same injunctive relief. I think this case is\nunique with the extortion element, but I don't disagree,\nJustice Scalia, that that is why any decision that says\ninjunctions in defamation actions would be improper. I\nthink people would start defaming with impunity.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You've got to give us some\nline. I mean, the only reason we're grabbing onto\nextortion is that -- that there's reluctance to say you\ncan issue injunctions in all defamation actions. Now,\nwhat -- what limitation do you want to place upon the\nability to issue an injunction if it is not defamation\ncombined with extortion?\nMR. COLE: I don't think you need to place a\nlimitation other than you can enjoin the defamatory\nconduct. Take, for example, the Internet. A posting goes\non of a -- of a business that -- a startup company. It\ncan't -- damages of -- for a startup company -- they're\nvery difficult to prove.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But then you run into the\npublic figure. I mean, that's a much more dangerous kind\nof rule of law, isn't it? I mean, a pure defamation\naction against a public figure, which they want to say\nthis is. You can write all kinds of things about public\nfigures. People can and do, for better or for worse. Do\n-- is there any authority for issuing in a pure defamation\naction an injunction?\nMR. COLE: There's no authority, but there's no\nauthority that says you can't do it.\nBut what I am suggesting is in -- is in a pure\ndefamation action that's not tied to any specific wrongful\nconduct, there's no reason why you couldn't enjoin. For\nexample, if you found that a specific item was defamatory\non its face, such as a posting on the Internet, the only\nway to get that posting off the Internet would be to\nenjoin it because damages aren't going to solve the\nproblem. And if it's -- even if it's purely defamatory,\nyou could restrict it to that purely defamatory posting,\nsimilar to -- to the obscenity cases where you've reviewed\na film, you found it to be obscene, and then you preclude\nit. There are procedural safeguards and you preclude it\nin the future.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you've just said\nsomething that I think that's inconsistent with your\nearlier presentation. You said you could enjoin that\nposting. Here you said it wouldn't be effective just to\nenjoin the particular placards that were used, the\nparticular words because then there would be other words.\nSo the same question could come up with an Internet\nposting if you had an injunction not simply on what was\nposted but anything about this particular individual that\nmight be posted in the future.\nMR. COLE: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think where\nthat leaves us is you'd have to engage in some sort of\nbalancing about the -- how narrowly tailored the\ninjunction is and does it provide a sufficient remedy and,\nyou know -- and -- and in this -- and what test we would\nanalyze it under, strict scrutiny, intermediate scrutiny,\nor the Ward test. And -- and I think that in applying\nthose tests, you'd have to come to a balance, and if the\nbalance is that you're going to limit it to a specific\ntype of speech or -- then that -- that would be a -- a\nreasonable limit, and if it creates a multiplicity of\nactions, well, so be it. But at least there's a remedy\nfor that posting or postings of a similar nature. So --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Now, you -- you -- to the\nextent that you're complaining about extortion-like\nconduct, something else that you drafted -- I'm looking at\nthe complaint on page 7 of the joint appendix. You have\nidentified all defamatory, including with the false light\ninvasion of privacy, but you don't have any claim that\nlooks like blackmail.\nMR. COLE: If you'd -- if I could direct you,\nJustice Ginsburg, to page 12 of the joint appendix at\nparagraphs (j) and (k) of the verified complaint, you will\nsee that we alleged in a verified complaint that he'd\nengaged in three previous efforts of this same type of\nconduct, one. And two, paragraph (k), that Tory is in the\nbusiness of professionally extorting monies from innocent\npersons and business --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I was going to ask you\nabout that. Were there findings to substantiate the\nallegations?\nMR. COLE: Findings to substantiate --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Specifically about the\nextorting money from the bank and the oil company.\nMR. COLE: No, Justice Kennedy, there were not.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No findings.\nMR. COLE: There was some testimony only on one\nof those issues, which was the oil company. There was no\nfindings on this issue.\nBut then I would refer you to paragraph (k)\nwhich specifically refers to extorting of monies. And\nalso in my opening statement, as is reflected in the\ntrial's transcript, the -- the first thing I said is this\nis speech designed for an improper purpose. It's\nunprotected speech designed to extort money from Mr.\nCochran. That was the whole theme --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But what -- what I mean is\ncould you have -- without using the label defamation, have\nstated a claim for extortion or blackmail? I'm not\nlooking at your particular allegations but how you\ndescribed on page 1 of the complaint what you were suing\nfor: libel, libel per se, slander, slander per se, and\ninvasion of privacy.\nMR. COLE: I think we could have pled extortion\nhad we chose to. We could have pled inference with\nadvantageous business relations. We probably could have\npled California's --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Does California law require\nyou to label the type of the cause of action or is it\nnotice pleading based on facts?\nMR. COLE: Notice pleading based on facts, but\nwe do label the causes of action. The -- the point I'm\ntrying to make is whether every cause of action was pled,\nif the conduct is extortion, which is what the judge\nimplicitly found by findings 20 and 27, that conduct is\nnot protected. And whether we named the cause of action\ncorrect in the complaint or we sued for that specified\ncause of action, doesn't change what it is that we were\nseeking relief for, which is stopping this man from\ndefaming Mr. Cochran until he was paid money.\nWe attempted to achieve that. We thought we did\na fair job in paragraphs 1 and 3, which they don't attack\nand I agree is not fairly included within the question\nwhich has been certified here, nor is an attack on the\nunderlying finding.\nBut we attempted in paragraph 2, broadly I\nagree, to avoid a multiplicity of actions and to give Mr.\nTory other channels of communication other than the public\nforum where he is engaged in a continuing course of\nrepetitive conduct to defame Mr. Cochran.\nHe -- and -- and this is -- one point that I\nwant to stress. We don't view this injunction as being\nviolated if he went on TV, he went on the radio, he went\nin the newspapers. We don't view those as public forums\nunder the definition that this Court has provided. Those\nare not public forums. We are not concerned about that.\nWe do not believe that those events will occur. We did\nnot seek to protect them. So we have given Mr. Tory an\nunlimited venue to speak, but we said you can't do this in\nthe public forum because of your continuing course of\nrepetitive conduct, 3 years, once a week, 52 times a year,\nover 150 times, 4 hours a day.\nAnd with that, I would submit that while the\ninjunction is broad, I don't believe it's a\nunconstitutional prior restraint, and to the extent this\nCourt believes it is overbroad, I believe striking\nsubparagraphs (ii) and (iii) of paragraph 2 would solve\nthe problem, or alternatively, that in conjunction with a\nsuggestion that it needs to be narrowed to deal with the\nspeech and conduct in issue.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Cole.\nMr. Chemerinsky, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERWIN CHEMERINSKY\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Thank you.\nJustice Breyer kindly invited my thoughts about\nhow an opinion might be written, and there are three\ndifferent ways not mutually exclusive.\nOne is that this injunction is vastly overbroad\nfor all the reasons that have been identified. Mr. Cole\nsaid a couple of things. One, he said that Mr. Tory can\ngo to court and ask for modification of the injunction,\nbut that's what makes this a prior restraint, that Mr.\nTory can only speak again if he goes to court and gets\npermission.\nAlso, he said at the end that Mr. Tory can go\nbefore the media. However, under California law, under\nDamon v. Ocean Hill, the media is defined as a public\nforum.\nA second way the opinion could be written is\nthat this for speech protected by the First Amendment.\nJustice Ginsburg, you asked me at the outset whether\nthat's in the scope of the question presented. Well, it\nis directly relevant to what Mr. Cole was saying. Because\nit's all opinion, all hyperbole it is protected by the\nFirst Amendment and can't be the basis for an extortion\nclaim.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but you're asking us now\nto -- the -- the trial court found there was defamation,\nand now you want to argue, no, it wasn't defamation. It\nwas mere opinion. I really don't see how that's included\nin the question presented.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: I think it is because it goes\nto the question whether the injunction is permissible.\nBut I go on to the third way that the opinion\ncould be written, and that's that injunctions are not\npermissible as a remedy in a defamation case. We agree\nthat if there is a cause of action for extortion, it can\nhave an injunction as a remedy. We agree if the cause of\naction is for harassment, there can be an injunction as a\nremedy. But those have specific elements that have to be\nmet. Those elements weren't met in this case.\nHistory is clear that injunctions aren't allowed\nin defamation cases, and also, Your Honor, it's quite\nimportant that Mr. Cole even said you can't craft a narrow\ninjunction in a defamation case. Any injunction is either\ntoo narrow or too broad.\nIn Near v. Minnesota, this Court said that it\nwas telling that in 150 years of the history of the First\nAmendment, there had never been an injunction approved by\nthis Court in a defamation case. We're now 70 years later\nthan that. To approve an injunction in a case like this,\neven though it's called defamation plus extortion, will\nopen the door to injunctions as a routine matter in\ndefamation cases across the country. No --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There have been -- there have\nbeen injunctions against harassing conduct, threatening,\nstalking.\nMR. CHEMERINSKY: Yes, Your Honor, and we have\nno objection to injunctions of that sort. What we object\nto is an injunction as a remedy in a defamation case and\nan injunction that is directed at speech. That's what the\nFirst Amendment prohibits.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nChemerinsky.\n"
