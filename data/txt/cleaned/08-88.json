Brillon.\nMs. Rainville.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTINA RAINVILLE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. RAINVILLE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nThere are many reasons to reverse the\nVermont Supreme Court in this case. I am going to begin\nby addressing four reasons as a matter of law that do\nnot require the Court to -- to review the record. The\nfirst is, even if we assume that the public defender is\nan assigned counsel -- and for the purposes of argument,\nI am just going to use the term \"public defender.\" If\nwe assume that public defenders do little or nothing in\na case, one cannot have a rule that that time is\nchargeable under the speedy trial right to the State\nbecause to do so creates chaos of constitutional\nproportions in the criminal justice system.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: May I ask you a question\nthat goes at least to one possible application of -- of\nyour argument? Your argument for the State, the\nposition that you just took, would -- would apply to the\nperiod of time, as I understand it, in which the\nindividual named, the defender named Sleigh, had been\nappointed to -- to represent the defendant.\nAnd as I understand it, when this case was\nargued in the Supreme Court of Vermont, the State\nconceded that, in fact, some prejudice should be\nattributed and it should be held against the State that\nSleigh in effect did nothing. They said, well, don't\nhold it against us quite as much as you might, but, in\nany case, that can be held against us.\nHere you don't take that position, and I --\nI don't know whether it's open to you -- it seems to me\nthat it's not open to you -- to take a different\nposition with respect to Sleigh here than the Attorney\nGeneral of Vermont did when it was before the Supreme\nCourt of Vermont. And I -- I have to assume that you\njust see it differently from the way the Attorney\nGeneral did. But would -- would you comment on -- on\nthe position that the State took and tell me why you can\ntake a different position here?\nMS. RAINVILLE: Yes. Yes, Your Honor. The\nState did take the position that the eight-month period,\nwhich included the four months where Attorney Sleigh was\ninvolved, was a neutral factor. And under the dicta in\nBarker, that would allow the Court to apply it against\nthe State, although not to weigh it heavily as a -- as a\nneutral factor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nMS. RAINVILLE: That was dicta in Barker,\nbut controlling to the Vermont Supreme Court. Before\nthis Court, however, on these facts --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But it was conceded, wasn't\nit, in the -- in the Vermont Supreme Court?\nMS. RAINVILLE: It was conceded that it was\na neutral time period.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nMS. RAINVILLE: And -- and --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, then, why isn't that\nconcession binding here?\nMS. RAINVILLE: I think it -- it may be\nbinding if the Court determines it's binding. But I\ndon't think it should be binding because this Court is\nconsidering policy that's going to affect all States and\nall courts. And the issue that was raised by the\nNational Governors Association, for example, as to\nwhether public defenders can be State actors -- and the\nlaw is clear that they cannot -- that's an important\nissue.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it is, but that is\nnot an issue that is necessarily implied by the -- by\nthe concession that the Attorney General made in the\nVermont Supreme Court.\nMS. RAINVILLE: Yes. Yes, but also if you\nlook at the record, the three years of delay, the time\nperiod involving Mr. Sleigh is approximately four\nmonths. If you take all four months where he was\nappointed by the docket or two months if you take the\ntime where he thought and understood that he was on the\ncase, and in light of the three-year delay, that amount\nof time is really inconsequential.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It may have been a\ngood concession below. I mean, it would -- as I\nunderstand it, the problem arose because of change in\nthe contract, right?\nMS. RAINVILLE: That's correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, that may\nwell have been attributable to the State.\nMS. RAINVILLE: It -- it may well have been\nattributable to the defender general. And that's one of\nthe problems in this case is that we don't have a record\nof why different attorneys -- Attorney No. 4, Donaldson,\nand Attorney No. 5, Sleigh, were never asked what they\ndid or --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose you are\nwilling to concede that there are situations where the\ndelay would be attributable to the State because of\nsystemic problems?\nMS. RAINVILLE: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The State has so\nmany cases, and it's only willing to hire one lawyer.\nThat lawyer can't possibly handle all the cases.\nMS. RAINVILLE: Absolutely. But that's not\nthe case here. That might be the situation if, for\nexample, the defender general said to every defendant:\nIf you want a trial with a lawyer, you have to wait a\nyear. That's not what happened here.\nWhat happened here is the defender general\nwas incredibly diligent. He appointed new counsel five\ntimes the same day. The day of the arraignment Mr.\nAmmons was appointed. The day Mr. Ammons withdrew,\nreplacement counsel, Mr. Harnett, was appointed. The\nday Mr. Harnett withdrew, replacement counsel was\nappointed. The day Mr. Donaldson withdrew, the docket\nshows that Sleigh was appointed. Five times the same\nday the defender general appointed counsel.\nThe sixth time, given that we are in\nVermont, a very small State with few lawyers, he had\ndifficulty finding a sixth lawyer. But the defender\ngeneral took extraordinary measures and went to the\nVermont Legislature and obtained funding, and the\nlegislature came up to the plate very quickly, in a\nmatter of weeks.\nThe last withdrawal of Lawyer No. 5 happens\non April 10th. It's June 20th that there is the letter\nin the appendix from the defender general saying that\nthe legislature has approved new funding. It's -- it's\nliterally a matter of weeks before the legislature comes\nto the plate and provides additional funding.\nSo to the extent that -- that that is State\naction, the defender general has been incredibly\nexpeditious, incredibly diligent, and went to the\nextraordinary length of getting additional funding for\nthe sixth lawyer. We -- we would concede --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I guess when -- when the\nlast two lawyers withdrew because their contracts had\nexpired, I suppose the court could have refused to\npermit them to withdraw, couldn't it?\nMS. RAINVILLE: It could have.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Couldn't it say you -- you\nhave an ethical duty; having undertaken representation,\nand it being very difficult to get anybody else, you --\nyou stay in the case?\nMS. RAINVILLE: The -- the court could have,\nand certainly --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Does it make it not the\nState's court -- not the State's fault no matter what?\nIs -- is the court's misfeasance the State's\nmisfeasance? Do you attribute that to the State?\nMS. RAINVILLE: The court's misfeasance\nwould -- would certainly be attributable to the State,\nbut we would argue that it would be a neutral factor.\nBut here, Your Honor, Brillon would -- in terms of the\nfourth lawyer, Mr. Donaldson, he sought to have him\nfired. And, in fact, it was his letter to the court and\nthen a subsequent motion to the court to have that\nlawyer dismissed. And in that colloquy when the -- when\nthe -- the trial judge asked Brillon, do you want to\nhave -- do you still want to have him fired despite all\nthis delay and everything, and Brillon says yes, clearly\nthe court with regard to Donaldson could have said to\nDonaldson, you stay on this case and get this case to\ntrial. But Brillon waived that. Brillon said that he\nwanted a new lawyer.\nWith regard to Sleigh --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- with that particular\nperiod. The trouble that I have with that particular\nperiod is August 1, 2003, to June 14, 2004, isn't that\nright? That is Donaldson -- or that's Moore?\nMS. RAINVILLE: That's Moore.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Donaldson was\nthe first one?\nMS. RAINVILLE: Donaldson was actually\nLawyer No. 4.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Go ahead.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Before you start, let me\njust make a comment and a -- and a question based on it.\nThe comment is I -- I'm willing to accept a lot of what\nyou say here, there is plenty of blame to go around.\nBut you accept, as I understand it, the proposition that\nthe State has simply got an affirmative duty to make\nsome kind of effective trial and representation\narrangement. It -- it -- it has that duty through\nproviding the public defender, it has that duty simply\nthrough providing a court that will keep things moving,\nand I think that's common ground.\nIf that, as it seems to be, is common\nground, then do we have anything before us in this case,\nexcept sort of going through the list of counsel, the\nlist of reasons, the list of delays and reviewing the\nVermont Supreme Court on, in effect, the details that it\nassumed in applying the rule? In other words, it seems\nto me that there isn't an issue of principle dividing\nthe parties here, it's a series of issues of details.\nIs that an unfair way to look at the case as we've got\nit?\nMS. RAINVILLE: You can certainly look at it\nin terms of details, and I think that the Vermont\nSupreme Court's findings are unsupported by the record.\nBut as a matter of law, you have delays by State actors,\nand even if you take the two or the four months for\nSleigh aside, the rest of the delay, three years of\ndelay minus -- there's four months, of course, which he\nhad no counsel -- but three years minus that time, is\nall caused by non-State actors.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah, but if you take\nSleigh, Donaldson, and the period in which there was\nno -- I guess, following Sleigh, in which there was no\ncounsel appointed at all, you're already up to just\nabout a year. And a year is -- is enough to trigger\nNeil v. Biggers. And so, it seems to me that what --\nwhat the fight, what the serious fight is about is,\nwell, within the further total of two-year period, who\nis to blame for this, who was to blame to that, and\nI'm -- I'm not sure that it's of any value to just go\nthrough and second-guess the Supreme Court of Vermont on\nthose details, because you've got enough in Neil v.\nBiggers before you even get to those details.\nMS. RAINVILLE: Well, also in terms of just\nbased on Brillon's admission, there's enough for this\nCourt to decide the case. He admits that he fired three\ndifferent lawyers.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Right.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Isn't there -- isn't there\nthat very important principle involved here that doesn't\nsimply involve calculating particular periods of delay?\nWhen you have a defendant who starts out by firing a\nlawyer and engineering the withdrawal of another lawyer\nby threatening a lawyer, is it appropriate then to go\nthrough all of the subsequent periods and attribute the\ndelay to the defendant or to the prosecution or as a\nneutral factor as if those, the initial events, hadn't\noccurred?\nWe don't know how quickly this case would\nhave gone to trial if the first lawyer hadn't been fired\nor if the third lawyer, I guess it was, had not been\nthreatened and forced to withdraw.\nMS. RAINVILLE: I believe you're absolutely\nright, Justice Alito. In this case his conduct was so\nunconscionable in threatening both his lawyer, and the\nfacts there --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I really wanted to ask you\npretty much exactly the same question. If we assume\nexactly the terrible way he fired the first two -- the\nfirst lawyer certainly, maybe the second, would it be\ntrue that no matter how long the delay occurred after\nthat, he could never get Sixth Amendment relief?\nMS. RAINVILLE: I would -- I wouldn't go\nthat far, Justice Stevens.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Why not?\nMS. RAINVILLE: Because what if the State\nkept him for ten years without a trial? I don't think\nthat would ever happen. Certainly on these facts\nthere's no basis, given his conduct, to balance anything\nin his favor. Vermont's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, there -- as I\nunderstand it, that that first year the Vermont Supreme\nCourt agrees with you.\nMS. RAINVILLE: That's right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: They said, we're not\ncounting any of that against you.\nNow we go into the second year, and the\nsecond year had to do with Mr. Donaldson, a lot of it.\nAnd it turns out that Mr. Donaldson actually had left\nthe office within a few days of his having been\nappointed to do this and then he never did anything. So\nthe Supreme Court of Vermont says, as far as Mr.\nDonaldson is concerned, we do hold that against the\nState for the reason that it is the equivalent of not\ngiving him anybody. The guy they gave him wasn't even a\npublic defender, he never did a thing. All right.\nNow we go to the third group. The third\ngroup, the State agreed they should be charged. That's\nMr. Sleigh. The third one they agreed with it. They\nsaid lightly, but they agreed with it.\nAnd as to the final group, Mrs. Moore, well,\nit looks like from the record as if the reason that was\nheld against the State had nothing to do with her\nperformance. It had to do with the fact that the State\ndidn't give certain records to her, which everybody\nwould agree, if it's true, should be chargeable to the\nprosecution, which is the State.\nSo we have four periods. In one of them you\nwon; in the second one he had no lawyer at all,\naccording to the court; in the third one you agree it\nshould be chargeable to you; and in the fourth one it\nhas to do possibly with prosecution errors, not defense\nerrors.\nNow, what are we supposed to decide? Are we\nsupposed to decide whether my statement is, in fact, a\ncorrect statement? If so, why isn't it? I guess we\nhave to read the record. But what else is there to\ndecide?\nMS. RAINVILLE: I think you can decide it\nwithout reviewing the record, based on the fact that you\nhave a defendant who fired his first lawyer six months\ninto the case, one day before trial.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And you won that.\nMS. RAINVILLE: And then filed -- fired a\nsecond lawyer when the lawyer initially argued and said,\nno, no, it's not true, I've been working; he then\nthreatened to kill the lawyer. Then he at that time was\ntold: If you want a new lawyer, there's going to be\ninevitable delays. He said: That's okay, I still want\nto fire this lawyer. Then he went on and fired yet\nanother lawyer.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose -- I'm not\nsure that we necessarily want to get into the particular\ndetails of a very complicated record, but there are\nseveral points in the Vermont Supreme Court opinion\nwhere it says that the failure of assigned lawyers to do\nanything to move the case forward is attributable to the\nState. And I thought the fundamental principle we were\ndebating is whether or not assigned lawyers who fail to\nmove a case forward, whether that is attributable to the\ndefendant or whether it is attributable to the State\nbecause they happen to work for the State.\nAnd I would assume one way to dispose of the\ncase would be to decide that general question and send\nit back for the Vermont Supreme Court with that guidance\nthat they were wrong, as a general matter, to assign\ndelay caused by the counsel to the State, to sort\nthrough the record themselves.\nMS. RAINVILLE: And I think that's a very\nimportant point, Mr. Chief Justice.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is that point in the case?\nWhere -- where is that in this case? I don't know who\n-- I didn't see anywhere where the Vermont Supreme Court\nsaid anything, said that, except in the instance where\nyou agreed with them.\nWhere is it in their -- where is it -- who\nare they are referring to when they said that? Is that\nDonaldson? Because I thought the claim with Donaldson\nwas it -- it was not his attribution, nothing he did was\nattributed. Rather, it was the State's failure to\nappoint anyone, because to appoint Donaldson was to\nappoint no one since he had left the office and since he\ndid nothing.\nNow, is that what we're supposed to decide:\nWhen a State appoints a person who has already left the\noffice and does nothing, under those circumstances is it\ncorrect to attribute to the State their failure to\nappoint anybody?\nMS. RAINVILLE: Well, first let me address\nthis point of two lawyers who did little or nothing. In\nStrickland v. Washington, this Court said how extremely\nimportant it is when determining ineffective assistance\nto have a strong presumption that counsel's conduct\nfalls within the wide range of reasonable professional\nassistance, and that there should be a hearing to ask\ncounsel what they did.\nHere the Vermont Supreme Court makes this\nruling without anyone at any point ever asking Mr.\nDonaldson or Mr. Sleigh what they did.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Rainville, underneath\nor between the lines there seems to be great discontent\non the part of the Vermont Supreme Court with the way\nthe public defender system is operating. And if we hold\nfor you as a matter of the federal speedy trial right,\nthe Vermont Supreme Court could go back and decide just\nthe same thing under the Vermont Constitution, couldn't\nit?\nMS. RAINVILLE: It could except for that we\nbelieve that this decision creates an unconstitutional\nsituation in creating two different classes of\ndefendant, indigent and non-indigent, in their speedy\ntrial rights, such that henceforth the prosecution and\nthe courts must treat every indigent defendant\ndifferently merely because they're indigent when they\nask for a continuance or when they ask for change of\ncounsel. We have to oppose those. So that we make the\nunpleasant choice of the constitutional due process\nviolation, that we would rather push a defendant who's\nindigent to trial before his counsel's ready, because\nthe constitutional violation there is only one of due\nprocess and he'll get a new trial, versus agreeing to\nallow their counsel to have time to prepare, in which\ncase we risk a speedy trial violation, where he will be\nable to walk free despite his guilt.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Rainville, you -- you\nbegan your presentation with a statement that gave me so\nmuch hope. You said you were going to give us three\nreasons why we wouldn't have to get into the hairy facts\nof the case and could decide it on -- on issues of law.\nOkay? You only mentioned the first. What are the other\ntwo?\nMS. RAINVILLE: The second is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Remind us of the first.\nMS. RAINVILLE: The first is that this\ncreates an unconstitutional situation where there are\ntwo classes of defendants treated differently by the\nState and by the courts.\nThe second is that the delays in this case\nwere caused by non-State actors and as a matter of law\nunder Polk County cannot be a constitutional violation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that sort of gets us\ninto the facts at some point. I mean, that does get us\ninto the facts.\nWhat's the third?\nMS. RAINVILLE: The third is that, based on\nhis concessions, his admissions in the brief, he's\nwaived it; and that's under Barker v. Wingo where the\nCourt talks about standard waiver doctrine applies in\nspeedy trial.\nAnd the fourth is that under the balancing\ntest based solely on his admissions, his conduct ought\nto weigh like a ton of bricks against whatever happened\nwith the State.\nand I'll reserve the rest of my time if I\nmight for rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nWe'll hear from Ms. Kruger first.\nMR. NELSON: Oh, excuse me.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Kruger.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONDRA R. KRUGER\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMS. KRUGER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIf you look on pages 27 through 28 of the\nVermont Supreme Court's opinion, it is clear that the\nVermont Supreme Court decided this case on the basis of\na single principle that it applied to the entirety of\nthe final two years of the pretrial delay in this case,\nand that is, as the Chief Justice has noted, that the\nfailure of defendant's series of assigned counsel to\nmove his case to trial should be attributable to the\nState.\nAs the question comes before the Court\ntoday, I think the primary point of dispute is whether\nthere should be an exception to the general rule that a\ndefendant is responsible for his own lawyer's delays in\nsituations in which the lawyer purportedly does little\nor nothing to move the case to trial; and for four\nreasons we think that the Court should decline to create\na kind of attorney inaction exception to the general\nrule.\nFirst of all, we think that such a rule\nwould be inconsistent with the role of a lawyer in an\nadversarial system and would undermine a lawyer's\nauthority to make day-to-day decisions about the\nscheduling of pretrial proceedings.\nSecond, we think that such a rule would be\nenormously difficult for courts to administer in\npractice, because attorney inaction is generally\ndifficult to discern in the midst of pretrial\nproceedings and the risk of error would be to deprive\nthe defendant of the time that his lawyer may genuinely\nneed in order to prepare an effective defense.\nThe third reason is that it would create\nopportunities for gamesmanship; it would create\nincentives for defendants to use the services of their\nlawyer so long as it suits them, but then to complain\nlater that the lawyer was inactive and therefore they\nshould not be held responsible for the lawyer's delay.\nAnd as to the lawyers themselves, it would create an\nincentive to unreasonably delay, with the comfort of\nknowing that the worst that would happen is the best\npossible outcome for their client, which is the\ndismissal of charges with prejudice.\nAnd finally, we think that such a rule would\ncreate an unjustifiable distinction between the\ntreatments of appointed counsel and retained counsel in\nour system.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: With respect to that last\npoint, let me ask you this question. Let's assume we --\nwe have paid counsel in a criminal case and, as a result\nof -- of delays by the prosecution, but primarily as a\nresult of requests for continuance after continuance\nafter continuance, the -- the case is not tried; it's a\nsimple case and it's not tried for three years.\nIs -- is it open to a reviewing court on\nconstitutional grounds to say that the State has got an\naffirmative obligation, a non-delegable obligation, to\nbring cases to trial in a reasonable time? And whether\nthe reason for the failure in this three-year case is\nbecause counsel just kept trying to -- to shove it off,\nor the courts were not diligent in scheduling it for\ntrial, at some point that non-delegable obligation has\nbeen violated. Is -- is that a -- a possible\nconstitutionally based position?\nMS. KRUGER: I think that Barker makes clear\nthat defendants can waive their right to a speedy trial\nand that indeed defendants will often desire to put off\ntrial as long as possible. I think that in giving\nproper consideration to the Barker Court's explanation\nof the nature and purposes of the right, and in\nparticular focusing on the fact that the only possible\nremedy for the speedy trial violation is a remedy that\nuniquely advantages defendants and poses substantial\nburdens on society, we think ultimately a defendant\ncan't escape responsibility for continuances that he has\nrequested through or without the assistance of counsel,\nsimply by blaming the prosecution for failing to object\nor by blaming the courts for failing to go along.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, what if the -- what\nif we change the facts slightly. What if the defendant\nhimself never says anything on the record? The only\nthing we've got on the record are repeated requests by\npaid counsel for continuances, and then after three\nyears the defendant fires paid counsel and says: I've\nbeen sitting in jail for three years awaiting trial, and\nI shouldn't have to wait that long. The State has\nfailed in its non-delegable duty. Would your answer\nstill be the same?\nMS. KRUGER: It would still be the same. We\nthink that fundamentally the principal safeguard against\nthat kind of unreasonable attorney-caused delay is the\nattorney's ethical obligation, which creates a duty in\nthe attorney to represent his clients with reasonable\ndiligence and promptness. We think that a rule that\nwould require --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Lots -- lots of very\neffective criminal trial lawyers believe that the first\ntactic is delay, delay, delay, delay, delay.\nMS. KRUGER: And I think it's precisely for\nthat reason, because a delay may ultimately be in the\nclient's interest, that this Court should decline to\nfashion a rule that makes the exercise of the remedy,\nwhich is again an extreme remedy that advantages the\ndefendant alone, exercisable at the option solely of the\ndefendant.\nWe think for that reason the defendant\nnecessarily has to be responsible for any delays that\nare caused either by him or by the person who is\nappointed to represent him. Again, the ethical duty of\nthe lawyer is to zealously advocate on behalf of the\ndefendant's interests, and if the defendant desires to\ngo to trial as quickly as possible, it's still the\nlawyer's duty under the ethical rules to try to\naccommodate that request, while at the same time doing\neverything he can to prepare an effective defense.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask you this\nquestion about your reliance on pages 27 and 28. If you\ndescribe it as delays by the lawyers themselves, I\nunderstand your comment as being right on the nose. But\nI understood part of that to be talking about the\nsituation in which the defender general's office has not\nperformed its duty with sufficient promptness.\nAnd would you not agree if there were a\nperiod, say, of seven or eight months in which they just\ndidn't get around to appointing a lawyer, that that\nshould be charged against the State?\nMS. KRUGER: We would agree, Justice\nStevens. In this case there were a period of a total of\nabout six months during which the Respondent was not\nrepresented at all, and we think in view of the State's\nultimate responsibility for providing counsel to\nindigent defendants, when the State doesn't comply in a\ntimely fashion with that duty, that delay is properly\nattributable to the State.\nAlthough in this case, because the delay was\nnot the product of a deliberate effort to hamper the\ndefense, we think that that period should weigh only\nlightly against the State; and ultimately, given the\nother factors at issue in this case, the absence of any\nactual trial prejudice in particular, we think that\nultimately those six months are insufficient to\nestablish a speedy trial violation.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't the prejudice factor\npretty much established as long as the guy has to stay\nin jail during this entire period?\nMS. KRUGER: I think that that's certainly\none form of prejudice, but in the Barker balancing -- in\nBarker itself, for example, the defendant was\nincarcerated for ten months during the pretrial\nproceedings, and the Court nevertheless found that there\nwas no speedy trial violation. We think a similar\nprinciple applies in this case. Although incarceration\nis obviously prejudicial to defendants, in this case\nthere was no prejudice above and beyond that. The\nVermont Supreme Court was clear in finding the absence\nof --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Did he get to offset it\nagainst the time for the pretrial incarceration?\nMS. KRUGER: I am not aware that he did, but\nthis Court made clear in Strunk that getting credit for\ntime served is not an appropriate remedy for a speedy\ntrial violation, that the only possible remedy is again\nwhat the Vermont Supreme Court did, erroneously in our\nview, which is to dismiss the charges without\npossibility of reindictment.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What would you think of a\nrule that said where most of the delay is attributable\nto the defendant, he doesn't -- he doesn't walk? That\nseems like a reasonable rule. Whatever the delay is, if\nmost of it is attributable to the defendant himself, it\nis -- it is not a basis for dismissing the indictment?\nMS. KRUGER: We think that a defendant -- we\nthink that that rule would make a great deal of sense.\nWhen a defendant --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That would make it easy to\ndecide this case because the -- the supreme court's\nopinion acknowledges that most of the -- most of the\ndelay was caused by the defendant.\nMS. KRUGER: Well, the Vermont Supreme Court\nthought that some of the delay was caused by the\ndefendant and didn't charge most of that period to the\nState to support its finding of the speedy trial\nviolation.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Would you really get by\nthat rule if there were, say, four years of delay and\ntwo years and one month was attributable to the\ndefendant and two years to the State?\nMS. KRUGER: We would think that a court\nevaluating a speedy trial claim in that case would\nproperly exclude any period that was attributable to the\ndefendant and focus specifically on that period that was\nattributable to the State in determining whether or not\nthe right was violated.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I'm sure\nyou have gone through the record and, agreeing with\nJustice Stevens that the periods where there wasn't a\ncontract, the State couldn't provide somebody, do count\nagainst the State, but disagreeing with the Vermont\nSupreme Court that when an assigned counsel fails to\nmove the case forward that is attributable to the State\nand not the defendant, what's the difference in time?\nMS. KRUGER: The difference in time is -- I\nthink that the -- as the case comes to the court, the\nfinal 11 months of the pretrial delay is not seriously\nin dispute. I think that Respondent has raised a number\nof arguments about concurrent causes of delay unrelated\nto the performance of his counsel. I think that those\narguments are not properly before the Court because they\nfall well outside the scope of the question as to which\nthis Court granted review and because they were neither\npressed nor passed on below.\nI think that leaves the middle 14 months of\nthe pretrial delay. And I think, given the Vermont\nconcession, the Vermont Supreme Court focus naturally\nrests on the 5.5-month period during which Paul\nDonaldson represented Respondent. And we think, with\nrespect --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes?\nMS. KRUGER: We think with respect to that\nperiod, we think that there is no basis for shifting the\nresponsibility for that delay that Paul Donaldson sought\nbefore going to trial from defendant to the State\nbecause, as Justice Scalia has rightly pointed out, any\ncontract expiration didn't in and of itself end the\nattorney-client relationship, and Paul Donaldson\nremained the agent and advocate of his client during\nthat period.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Nelson.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM A. NELSON\nON BEHALF OF the RESPONDENT\nMR. NELSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI apologize for jumping the gun.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sorry to delay you.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But it's not going to get\nyou off.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. NELSON: I would like to respond to --\nto Vermont's argument about there being no detailed\nrecord about why these attorneys left when they left.\nAnd I -- I think if they're right, then that augurs a\nremand, that suggests a remand. But the reason there\nwas no record of those departures is because the courts\nwho presided over those departures never requested an\nexplanation.\nWith Paul Donaldson, the matter was a\nforegone conclusion. He had no contract. He was going\ninto another line of work. So be it, he's out of there.\nNo questioning concerning Mr. Brillon's complaints about\nhis inaction, his failure to investigate, and so forth;\nnothing about are you ready to go to trial, what have\nyou done, what have you accomplished, what are you\npassing on, if anything, to the next lawyer in line,\nnone of that.\nAnd with Sleigh, the judicial disinterest,\nif that's what it was, the judicial silence is even more\nresounding. Sleigh did not request permission to\nwithdraw. He put the court on notice that he was\nwithdrawing, and this came out of the blue. I don't\nthink there was any heads-up for the court that this was\ngoing to happen, although Sleigh had expressed some\nserious reluctance to take the case and hadn't done\nanything. He didn't -- he had a filing deadline of\nApril 11th, and he was supposed to file motions on that\ndate, and instead of filing motions he filed this notice\nof withdrawal with no response from the court.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is the -- what\nis the distinction in your theory of the case between\ndelay and failure -- failure to move a case -- what did\n-- what did the Vermont case say: Failure to do\nanything to move the case forward?\nWhen do we know that that's attributable to\nthe defendant, and when is it attributable to the State?\nMR. NELSON: I think it -- I think it\ndepends on the facts, and I think in each of the -- in\nthe case of each of these two attorneys, the facts are\ndifferent. With Donaldson, I think the State's\nresponsibility -- the State's involvement in a\ndo-nothing attorney, an attorney who was really a\nnominal attorney, started from the beginning. It\nstarted from the appointment of -- of counsel who had\nbeen on contract with the State to perform defense\nservices and was appointed.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course, if the\nlawyer is a do-nothing lawyer, then I suppose there's an\nineffective-assistance claim?\nMR. NELSON: Well, it might mature into an\nineffective-assistance claim, but there couldn't be an\nineffective assistance claim on the record here because,\nwell, ineffective assistance is -- is something that\noccurs at a trial. And it can't be --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It's an anomaly, though,\nisn't it, that easily might have matured into\nineffective assistance? It wasn't yet, but if Attorneys\n4 and 5, Donaldson and Sleigh -- if the case were for\nineffective assistance of counsel, then the defendant\nwould get a new trial, but here the result is he walks.\nMR. NELSON: That's -- that's a consequence\nof the speedy-trial clause in Barker and Strunk. A\nspeedy-trial violation happens, by definition, before\ntrial. Ineffective assistance happens, by definition\nand by this Court's decisions, at trial and can't be\ndetermined until after trial. Unless there is -- is a\nspeedy trial right and unless it's going to be enforced,\nthis is the consequence. And that's --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In the abstract, you\nhave a lawyer who is a public defender or hired as a\npublic defender, and he keeps asking for continuances --\ncontinuance, continuance. How do we tell that that's\nthe State's problem as opposed to what the defendant is\ndoing through his lawyer?\nMR. NELSON: I think at first you would have\nto assume that the continuances were sought in good\nfaith and -- and for purposes of defense preparation.\nIf the defendant had demanded a speedy trial, as this\ndefendant had an early date, I think the court, looking\nat -- at a continuance motion, would have to look at it\nin that light.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, what is the trial\njudge supposed to do? The defense attorney keeps asking\nfor continuances for purposes of investigation. I need\nmore time to investigate. If -- and -- and -- can the\ncourt say: You need to tell me exactly what you are\ndoing?\nMR. NELSON: I think, Justice Alito, that a\ncourt -- when a defendant has demanded a speedy trial,\nthat a court does have some obligation to -- to\nsupervise, to monitor, to -- and -- and it happens all\nthe time in criminal courts. What have you done? Have\nyou seen your client? What -- how much time do you need\nfor these motions? When are you going to be ready for\ntrial? That happens all the time.\nAnd as the -- as time goes by, as the months\npass and -- and become years, I think a court's granting\nof continuances has to be more grudging. The courts are\nunder a duty because they have a duty to assure the\nspeedy-trial right. Because they are the -- they are\nthe primary actors in that, the court has a duty to be\n--\nJUSTICE ALITO: Aren't you giving the\nattorney a very perverse incentive there? I mean the\ndelay may help the ultimate outcome of the case, and if\nthe -- if the defense attorney can engineer enough\ndelay, he or she may also produce a speedy-trial\nviolation.\nMR. NELSON: Well, I -- yes, of course,\nthat's a -- that's a problem, and it's a problem that\nwas recognized by Barker, and -- and it's a problem that\n-- that courts are well equipped to handle. They --\ncourts are able to and commonly do. In fact, it's their\npretrial business -- main pretrial business to -- to set\nthat line to make sure lawyers adhere to them and make\nsure that the case goes to trial. They -- courts are\nwell equipped to deal with that.\nBut I -- I would like to point out that your\nhypothetical is not this case. That we are not dealing\nhere with delays that were caused by continuance\nmotions. In fact, if you look closely at the record,\ntrial dates were not pushed back by continuance motions\nin this case. Trial dates were pushed back by attorney\ninaction and withdrawals.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And by your client firing\nthe first attorney, correct?\nMR. NELSON: My client -- that's correct.\nMy client fired -- fired the first attorney, which --\nwhich the State says was the bad act. But look at the\nrecord of that firing. It wasn't really a firing, of\ncourse. He had no right to fire assigned counsel. But\nhe had just heard his lawyer telling the judge, I'm\nhandling 150 odd cases, I cannot be ready for trial,\ngive me more time. I -- I -- I could be ready maybe in\nMarch or April, but I can't be ready now. And that was\nlike three or four days before trial.\nAnd I would submit that any client, hearing\nhis lawyer making those representations to a judge,\nwould have been very upset and would, in fact, have\nwanted another lawyer.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But knowing that the new\nlawyer would have to start from scratch, from the\nbeginning, so it was going to take more time. If he got\na new lawyer, it was going to take more time than if he\nstayed with the lawyer who was already acquainted with\nthe case but just needed a few more weeks.\nMR. NELSON: Well, yes, but the lawyer who\nhad been appointed wasn't going to get those few more\nweeks, and as Mr. Brillon said to the court, I would\nrather do it right the first time. Being charged with a\nlife imprisonment offense, one can hardly blame him.\nYes, he had to make a tradeoff, but he had to do it\nbecause his lawyer was not ready.\nNow, we argued in the Vermont Supreme Court\nthat that time could not --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me, is that the\nproper remedy? I mean, it seems to me he should appeal\nto the judge and say, look, this lawyer -- is -- is that\nthe way you solve the problem of -- of an attorney who\nis not ready, like fire him so you can get another\nattorney? That seems to me very strange.\nMR. NELSON: Counsel. Counsel moved for --\nmoved for a continuance on February 22nd.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. NELSON: And --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And from what you told me\nit should have been given, right?\nMR. NELSON: Pardon me?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: From what you tell me, it\nshould have been given if indeed he was unable to\nprepare adequately for the trial?\nMR. NELSON: I believe so. The judge took a\ndifferent view. It was fully argued. The judge was the\nonly one who had -- the judge was the decider on that\none, and she said no. You don't get it.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, wasn't there a\nconcern about this defendant trying avoid a particular\njudge? That's why he wanted the continuance?\nMR. NELSON: The -- the State made that\nallegation, and it made that claim here. No court has\nfound it. The Vermont Supreme Court found the opposite.\nThe Vermont Supreme Court held that Brillon fired or\nasked for the dismissal of his first lawyer because he\nwas not prepared to go to trial, which seems like an\nample, sufficient and supported reason for the action he\ntook. That explains the case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Not only did the Vermont\nSupreme Court make that finding, it does not hear the\nwitnesses, it -- it has a record before it. I can\nunderstand if you're talking about a finding made by the\ncourt of first instance, but the Vermont Supreme Court\nis reviewing a record, it's not making findings.\nMR. NELSON: That's -- that's true, Justice\nGinsburg. The trial court, however, also didn't make\nthat finding, although it was asked to. And, in fact, I\nthink any such finding would be entirely speculative.\nIt would require the court, the fact finder,\nto interpolate various happenings that are not of\nrecord, and that we say never happened. It would\nrequire us to assume that Brillon told Ammons, I want\nyou to move for a continuance on whatever grounds you\ncan think of, but the real reason is to get rid of the\njudge. And that Ammons would do that for his client,\nand, you know, for the ostensible reason that he\npresented to the court, namely, he was overloaded and\nnot prepared to go to trial, his secret reason was to\nget rid of the judge. And I think the record doesn't\nwarrant that kind of inference, especially since it's\nbeen presented to and not accepted by the State courts.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This is not an\nunusual reason for criminal defense lawyers in the\nprivate sector to ask for a continuance. It's quite\ncommon for the lawyers to go before the judge and say,\nlook, I've got this other case going to trial next week,\nI've got this and this, can I get more time, and judges\ngive them the first two but not the third. And why in a\ncase simply where you're dealing with a public defender\ndo you presume the opposite and blame the State for\nwhat's a quite common practice in the private part?\nMR. NELSON: Mr. Chief Justice, I -- I'm\nonly saying that this -- on this record, the conclusion\nthat that was what was happening, which would be\nsignificant if the court were then to say, and\ntherefore, it was done by the defendant who wanted delay\ndespite what he said, and therefore, this is time\nconsidered waived under Barker. There is no basis for\nthat finding.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: My point is, I\nguess, how do we tell? I mean, if this is normal -- I\nthink it is normal, I think it's quite unusual for a\ndefense lawyer to be prepared to go to trial the first\ntime the trial date is set. If it is normal, how do we\ntell?\nMR. NELSON: Well, actually, this wasn't the\nfirst -- the first request for a continuance, Chief.\nAmmons had moved for a continuance before, and it had\nbeen denied.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah, but -- again,\nI assume that's -- there are probably cases in the\nprivate bar where that's true as well.\nMR. NELSON: How does one know? I think\none -- I think what makes a major difference here is\nthat Brillon had demanded a speedy trial. He had done\nso long before Ammons' motion for a continuance. He had\ndone -- he did so almost every chance he got at almost\nevery court hearing.\nYou could, and I think the State does,\nassume that this was all tomfoolery and an attempt to\nmanipulate the court, but there is nothing in the record\nto suggest that. That was the debate between the\nmajority and the dissent at the State court. The\nmajority won. As in Doggett, the -- the State is now\ncoming back and trying to refight here an essentially\nfactual issue which it lost in -- in the courts below.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What about Donaldson and\nMoore, those two periods? Those two periods, the\nDonaldson period and the Moore period, seem, as far as I\ncan tell, which isn't that far, they seem to be periods\nwhen the State -- when the court below was saying that\nall that happened here was that the lawyers who were\nappointed, did a very bad job.\nYou can't say they weren't appointed. It\nisn't that he didn't have counsel. He had counsel, and\nthey just didn't do very much.\nNow, why should that be accounted against\nthe stayer? Is Moore special? Was there really a\nproblem of prosecutorial behavior? Is Donaldson the\nsame as Sleigh? I don't know.\nMR. NELSON: Let me start --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is Donaldson a case where\nthey -- is equivalent to having no lawyer? I don't know\nhow to deal with it.\nMR. NELSON: Let me start with Donaldson,\nand I think in answer to your question, I don't think\nDonaldson is substantially different from Sleigh. I\nwon't go over the circumstances of Donaldson's\nappointment, but once he was appointed, he began\nconversations with the defender general about getting\noff the case. And I think the sense -- and -- and a\nsignificant fact about those conversations is that the\ndefender general told Donaldson he was going to be\nreplaced.\nWe don't know exactly when that happened,\nbut he told him he was going to be replaced with someone\nwho was more competent, more qualified to deal with a\nlife imprisonment case. So this is not information\nwhich will light a fire under a lawyer to prepare a\ncase, that he knows he's not going to try.\nDonaldson then asks for time. It's the only\nrequest he ever made of the court. The court gave him\ntime and set filing deadlines, and he missed them.\nMissing those deadlines should have been a red flag to\nthe court in a case that was already over a year old.\nThe court let those deadlines pass without a word.\nThe court also said, we're going to try this\ncase in October. Get ready for trial in October.\nEverything should be filed by September 23rd. And for a\nreason, which the record has no explanation for, the\nOctober trial never happened. Donaldson was still on\nthe case, his name was still on the case, and the\nOctober trial date passed without a murmur. It was not\nuntil late November that Donaldson came to the court and\nexplained the situation.\nNow the court -- I think the defender\ngeneral failed in his responsibility with regard to\nDonaldson. That's State involvement. The court failed\nin not noticing the -- the missed deadlines and in\nallowing the trial date to pass without a trial; and I\nthink the Court also failed in its duty in allowing\nDonaldson off the case, which rendered any catch-up time\nthat he had to do pointless, without any inquiry at all.\nThe court, it's clear from the record, deferred entirely\nto the defender general, and so I think the Vermont\ncourt on that record thought that there was enough State\ninvolvement here to charge -- to find the State\nresponsible and to weigh some of that responsibility\nagainst the State. The court --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What does your --\nyour argument do to the fundamental and I think quite\nvital principle in Polk County that public defenders\nwork for their clients; they don't work for the State?\nMR. NELSON: It does nothing to Polk County,\nand we acknowledge that -- that Paul Donaldson's\ninaction by itself, if it had nothing to do with the\nState, if the State did not involve itself or condone --\nif the State had no responsibility with regard to that\ntime, the State would have no responsibility under\nBarker. That's perfectly clear, and I don't think the\nVermont Supreme Court's opinion, fairly read, fairly\nread says anything other than that. The Vermont --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I guess fairly\nread, it does say the failure of several assigned\ncounsel to do anything to move the case forward is\nattributable to the State, because they didn't do\nanything, I guess is the touchstone.\nMR. NELSON: Well, I think I have two\nresponses to that. One is that in the context of the\nrest of the opinion, what the court was talking about\nwas a breakdown of the system, and the focus was on two\nactors, both State actors, the assigning agency, the\ndefender general, and the court and I don't think\nthere's any dispute that both of those are indeed State\nactions, and that delays which can be traced to them,\nwhich they have a hand in, can be weighed against panned\nthe State under Barker.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But it doesn't say that; it\nreally does say most of the delay was caused by the\ninability or unwillingness of assigned counsel, not of\nthe -- of the institution that appoints them,\nunwillingness or inability of assigned counsel to move\nthe case forward. That looks to me like --\nMR. NELSON: I think -- elsewhere in the\nopinion, Justice Scalia, I think the court is clear that\n-- that they were faulting the defender general, and to\na lesser extent the court. I think we are putting more\nstress on the court's nonfeasance than the Vermont\nSupreme Court did, but in fact, the time adds up to the\nsame. The time, we're talking 14 months from\nDonaldson's assignment until Moore's assignment in\nAugust.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you agree -- just\nfollowing up --\nMR. NELSON: Okay.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. Just\nfollowing up on your latest answer, do you agree that it\nhas to be a systemic problem? I mean, you gave us that\n-- the situation where the lawyer says I've got 150\ncases, I need a -- need a continuance.\nWhat if there's none of that? They've got,\nyou know, 500 public defenders, and the -- but the guy\nstill delays. He's responsible for not doing anything\nto move the case forward.\nMR. NELSON: Well --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is it still\nattributable to the State?\nMR. NELSON: I don't think -- I don't think\nthe result depends on there being a systemic problem. I\nthink in this case there was a systemic problem, and the\nCourt knows about that from the findings of the indigent\ndefense task force, which --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But the Chief Justice's\nquestion, I'm interested in it as well, are there\ninstances in which a State-appointed counsel can delay\nand have that not attributed to the State? Is it always\nattributed to the State --\nMR. NELSON: No.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Just because he's State --\nMR. NELSON: Absolutely there can be\nsituations like that, where there is no --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: There is a delay, but it's\nnot attributable to the State.\nMR. NELSON: It's not attributable to the\nState, it's attributable to counsel. And just the same\nas -- just the same as for private counsel. We're not\nproposing a two-tiered system there. We're --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, when is that?\nThe -- you have the same situation, the defense counsel\nappointed by the State does nothing to move the case\nforward, that's as I understand it the Vermont Supreme\nCourt touchstone. When is that attributable to the\nState and when is it not?\nMR. NELSON: It would not be attributable to\nthe State if the assigning agency was -- had no fault,\nhad no supervising duty that it failed to perform, that\nthe lawyer was essentially on his own or her own; and it\nwould also assume, I think, if the delay went on long\nenough, that there was no fault in the court in failing\nto --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I --\nMR. NELSON: -- to notice that nothing was\nhappening.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It does sound to me,\nthen, that you're saying there has to be some systemic\nproblem, that the rule that I understand the Vermont\nSupreme Court to have adopted, that when assigned\ncounsel does nothing to move the case forward, that\nthat's attributable to the State, you would disagree\nwith? You would say no, there has to be a systemic\nproblem, not the -- not just the individual lawyer, but\nthey're not assigning enough defenders, they're not\nsupervising them, whatever.\nMR. NELSON: Maybe I'm not using the word\nsystemic in the same sense you are. All I would say is\nsay is it doesn't have to happen to a lot of people, it\ncould happen to just one person, but it would only\nhappen to that one person if a public, State agency was\nresponsible for the delay.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What if you have a situation\nin which the -- an attorney is appointed, the defendant\nthreatens that attorney, the attorney withdraws. A\nsecond attorney is appointed, the client threatens that\nattorney, the attorney withdraws, and then thereafter a\nnew attorney is pointed, and there is great delay.\nMaybe more -- two or three attorneys are appointed.\nThere's great delay. Is -- does the -- does the chain\nof events that started all this get taken into account\nor do you just start counting the time from the\nappointment of the last attorney who wasn't threatened?\nMR. NELSON: I think you can't ignore what\nhappened before, but you can -- but -- but if what\nyou're saying or suggesting is that earlier bad actions\nresult in a forfeiture of speedy trial rights, I would\ndisagree. The way you -- the way it matters is that by\nfiring, threatening, unjustifiably getting rid of a --\nof a lawyer, you require the next lawyer to spend some\ntime getting up to speed on the case. And that time --\nJUSTICE ALITO: What if a small -- I don't\nknow how many lawyers are available for appointment in\nBennington. What if it's a small jurisdiction where\nthere aren't that many who are available to be\nappointed? And so you fire the public defender, you\nthreaten the first appointed counsel, and pretty soon\nyou don't have very many left, or the ones that you have\nleft are busy with other cases and delay results.\nMR. NELSON: But that's not the case here,\nand I think my answer to your question is that what\nmakes this a State response -- failure of responsibility\nis that the State had the ability to do something about\nit. If the State's hands are tied, if they run out of\nlegal talent, if there's no other way to get counsel on\nthe case than by a broken-down contract system, which\nwas not the case --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the point that\nMs. Rainville made? And she talked about this balancing\nthat comes out of Barker, and she said you have to weigh\nagainst the defendant very heavily, the episodes with\nlawyer number one and number three, because that was\nreally bad stuff. The State is perhaps responsible for\nsome of the other delays, but she called those \"neutral\"\nin the weighing process. Don't those two episodes,\ncounsel number one was fired, counsel number three, who\nsays his life was threatened by the defendant, don't\nthose have to count very heavily against the defendant?\nMR. NELSON: Justice Ginsburg, I don't think\nthat Barker works that way. I think what Barker says is\nthat time which is attributable to the defendant gets\nsubtracted from the total delay; that that's not\nconsidered. That the rest of the time is a period which\nthe State has to account for; and there are -- there\nwill be segments of that time, segments of that delay\nwhich are nobody's fault, and those delays would in fact\nbe truly neutral in the sense of they would have no\nweight against the State; and there are others that\nwould count more or less heavily against the State.\nSo I think the effect of what went on with\nJerry Altieri, which I think was not much more than two\nmonths of the total time that he was on board, I think\nthe effect of that is to subtract that period, and then\nany catch-up period that his firing or his dismissal\nrequired, subtract that period as well from the total,\nand weigh the rest more or less heavily or perhaps not\nat all against the State.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the rest, I\ncouldn't find in his final counsel's representation -- I\ndidn't see anything in her representation that would\nsuggest any lack of diligence on her part or any reason\nto count that in the speedy trial calculus. That runs\nfrom August 2003 to June 2004.\nMR. NELSON: To June 2004. That's correct.\nI -- I think that the opinion is not clear as to how\nmuch responsibility the Vermont court attributed to the\nState for that period. Vermont says they charged every\nsecond of the -- of that time to the State, and it's\nquite clear from the opinion that they didn't. They\nsaid that most of the remaining two years, as of\nDonaldson's appointment in June of '02, was attributable\nto the State. It's not clear how much of that time or\nif they actually counted it. I think that any precise\ncalculation of that time period is impossible.\nWe argue, and the record supports, that much\nof that time had to do with Ms. Moore getting files\ntogether, not only from predecessor counsel but from the\nState, and that the State delayed for many months in\nproviding an updated witness list with current\naddresses. She needed that to interview the witnesses.\nThe case was old, and she needed the State's help there,\nwith other discovery material which the record shows --\nit's not in the joint appendix, but it is in the printed\ncase, which was essentially Vermont Supreme Court's\nequivalent of an appendix. These materials were at\nissue for Moore. She needed them. The prosecutor was\ndilatory in providing them. And I think that that's a\nkind of vanilla reason to attribute some of that time to\nthe State.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Nelson --\nMR. NELSON: The court was also --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- what is your judgment\non how much time all together was attributable to the\nState?\nMR. NELSON: I think 14 -- I think the\nVermont court was clear about the 14 months from\nDonaldson through Moore, including the six months of no\ncounsel. It adds up to 14 months. And then the rest of\nthe time I don't think you can put a number on.\nMaybe it's not time that we're trying to add\nup, but responsibility. And what the -- what the State\ncourt was saying was when a case is as old as this one\nwas when Moore took it over, the court should be very\nvigilant and grudging in its grants of continuances, and\nthe case could have been tried sooner than in eight\nmonths.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your 14 months,\njust so I understand, that includes the August 2003\nthrough June 2004, when Moore was representing him?\nMR. NELSON: No. The 14 months goes from\nDonaldson on June 11th, 2002, through Moore's\nappointment in August 2003.\nThank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nNelson.\nMs. Rainville, you have a minute remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTINA RAINVILLE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. RAINVILLE: Very quickly then, Justice\nGinsburg, the answer to your question, he did receive\ncredit for his time served.\nThe important distinction that the questions\nraised show, what's so fundamentally wrong about this\ncase, is the distinction between Strickland. There you\nask the lawyers what they did. They're given deference.\nThey're given the right to defend themselves. And if\nyou prove that it would have had an effect on the\noutcome of the case, the defendant gets a new trial.\nHere the lawyers are never asked, no presumption is\ngiven, and the defendant is allowed to walk free for the\nrest of his life. It's fundamentally wrong.\nLetting a defendant walk free from a crime\nis an extraordinary remedy that should only be given in\nan extraordinary case, and that case is not this one.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
