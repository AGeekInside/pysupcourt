        "content": "(10:08 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst in Illinois Tool Works Inc. v. Independent Ink,\nInc.\nMr. Pincus.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. PINCUS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. PINCUS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nIn its opinion in Jefferson Parish, the Court\nstated that the key characteristic of illegal tying is\nthe seller's exploitation of its control over the tying\nproduct to force the purchase of the tied product. The\nCourt held that the per se rule against tying applies\nonly if the plaintiff proves that the seller has -- and\nI'm quoting from that opinion. The quote is on page 12\nof our brief -- the special ability, usually called\nmarket power, to force the purchaser to do something\nthat he would not do in a competitive market.\nIf the Court were confronted today for the\nfirst time with the question whether the presence of a\npatent on some aspect of the tying product by itself\ndemonstrates the existence of this forcing power, it's\ninconceivable that the Court would adopt that rule.\nNot only is there no empirical evidence to support it,\nthere's no logical basis for such a presumption.\nThe focus of patent rights is very different\nfrom antitrust market analysis. Patent rights are tied\nto a particular invention. Market power is buyer-\ncentric. A buyer may be able to choose from a number\nof different products, some patented, some not, to\nsatisfy his or her need. The existence of a patent on\none of those devices does not preclude at all the\nexistence of alternatives that are equally attractive,\nmaybe even more attractive, to the customer.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Let me ask you about\npatents and tying products. Are there component parts\nthat are patented in today's complicated world, and do\nthey -- do they -- do the component parts become part\nof the tying product? I mean, how does that work?\nMR. PINCUS: Absolutely, Your Honor. One of\nthe -- one of the evils of the presumption is that\nthere's nothing that says that the patent has to be on\nthe entire product. The -- the patent could be on a\ncomponent of a product. And in today's world, as Your\nHonor says, television sets, CD devices, cell phones,\nall of those devices are loaded with components, one of\nwhich may happen to be patented. It may not be the one\nthat makes the -- it may not have to do with anything\nthat makes that product attractive in the marketplace,\nbut the presence of that patent would be relied upon to\nmake the presumption applicable.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, does the patent\nsomehow spread to cover the larger product? I -- I\ndon't see how it works.\nMR. PINCUS: Well, I think -- I think the\ntheory of the application of the presumption is, first\nof all, obviously, if the whole product is patented,\nthen the presumption would be applicable. But I think\nthere also is an argument that even if some component\nis -- is patented, that component, because it's in that\nproduct, gives that product market power because the\ntheory would go the patent would exclude the ability of\nother competitors in the market to use that component.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I suppose -- I\nsuppose we could say -- I just hadn't thought of it. I\n-- I suppose we -- we could say that it's not a\nseparate product. I mean, no -- no -- there's no\nmarket for the -- for the small micro-component in the\nTV. You're selling a TV.\nMR. PINCUS: But then I think the argument --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's an -- a very\ninteresting question, but it seems to me that we could\nhandle that by just saying, well, there's not a\nseparate product.\nMR. PINCUS: Well, you could, but I think the\nquestion -- the question would be whether that product\nas a whole in the marketplace, which is -- part of it\nis made up by this component. The argument would be,\nif I'm a competitor, I can't duplicate that product\nbecause that component is patented, and therefore, that\nproduct that contains the patented component should get\nthe benefit of this market power presumption.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It's not a --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, why would the person\nwant if he thought that? I mean, why would a person\nwant a patent if, in fact, he didn't think that it gave\nhim the power to raise price above what the price would\nbe in its absence?\nMR. PINCUS: Well, Your Honor, at the -- at\nthe time that -- that the inventions are patented, it's\nnot clear -- many inventors don't know what the market\nvalue of their product will be.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, you see, you're talking\nabout the wide -- you -- you say there are a lot of\nfailed patents. The person got it because he thought\nit would, but he shouldn't have because it actually\nmade no difference.\nMR. PINCUS: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: There might be. I don't\nknow.\nMR. PINCUS: Our system encourages -- there\n-- it -- it certainly is possible there are many\npatents that -- that are -- there are many inventions\nthat are patented that don't have value in the\nmarketplace. There are some that do. The problem with\nthis --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, there might be.\nThere's a set of valueless patents.\nMR. PINCUS: Yes, but the fact --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And in respect to there\nbeing a valueless patent, the owner would not be able\nto raise the price over what it otherwise would be.\nAnd why not then make that a defense, that a person\ncould say, I have a valueless patent, and he could\nintroduce evidence to prove it?\nMR. PINCUS: Well, Your Honor, I -- I think\nthere are -- there are two answers to that question.\nFirst of all, there's no empirical showing and -- and\nno logical evidence that there -- the set of valuable\npatents is larger than the set of valueless ones. And,\nin fact, it's probably the evidence is to the contrary,\nthat the set of valueless patents is quite\nconsiderable. So by creating a presumption and\nshifting the burden based on something that's\ndemonstrably not true doesn't have a logical basis.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: As I understand the\nrespondent's position, it's not the component. They're\nnot arguing that. So you're answering a hypothetical\ncase that isn't presented here.\nAnd also, respondent says that we are talking\nonly about patents where there is a successful tie. So\nleave out all those cases where I have a patent and\nit's never produced a penny, and somehow I can make\nmileage out of that.\nMR. PINCUS: Yes, Your Honor. I -- I think\nrespondent has moved away from -- from the Loew's\nassertion that the mere existence of a patent shows\nuniqueness sufficient to -- to satisfy the market power\ntest. And -- and one of the next level presumptions\nthat they propose is that if the -- if the patent ties\nsuccessful in the marketplace that shows market power.\nBut that's inconsistent with this Court's recognition\nin -- in a number of cases that ties can be successful\nin the marketplace not because they're backed by market\npower, but because they are attractive to consumers in\na competitive market.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, let's go to --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Pincus, you -- you had a\nsecond point you were going -- in response to Justice\nBreyer's question. What was your second point?\nMR. PINCUS: Well, my second point, in\nresponse to Justice Breyer, if I can recall it, was\nthat in the component situation, which was one of the\nsituations that we were talking about, that the problem\nwith the component test, the presumptions are supposed\nto be easy to apply. And if you say, well, the entire\ndevice has to be patented, then the next case is going\nto be a case where 85 percent of the key ingredients\nare patented, 15 percent aren't, and the question will\nbe, does the presumption apply? So you're -- you're\nsetting up a presumption which is designed to -- for\nease of application that will become extremely\ndifficult to apply.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't the refutation of the\npresumption really the same thing as a demonstration of\nmarket power?\nMR. PINCUS: Yes. The -- the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and we usually leave\nthe demonstration of market power to the -- to the\nplaintiff in the case.\nMR. PINCUS: Absolutely, Your Honor, and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So it -- it'd be rather\nstrange to -- to have in this one category of cases the\nmarket power has to be -- or lack of market power has\nto be demonstrated by the defendant.\nMR. PINCUS: It would be extremely strange\nespecially because there's the lack --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think there's a\ndistinction -- do you think there's a distinction\nbetween components in cases where there's a one-on-one\nrelationship between the tied product and the tying\nproduct and cases like this which involve metering? Do\nyou think there's a different possible approach between\nthe two?\nMR. PINCUS: No, Your Honor, we don't because\nthe -- the economic literature --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But your earlier point was\nwe know that a whole lot of patents are not all that\nimportant. But is it not fair to assume that when a\npatent can generate metering in this particular kind of\nsituation, that it -- that it's a likelihood that it\nhas more power than the average patent?\nMR. PINCUS: No. I -- I think, A, it's not\nreasonable to assume that, Your Honor, and it's\ncertainly not reasonable to assume it has the level of\nmarket power that Jefferson Parish required, which was\nsignificant market power. The Court there held that a\n30 percent share of the relevant market was not enough.\nSo we're talking, in the tying context, of a very\nconsiderable market power test.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But if it's -- if it is\ntrue, as your opponent says -- and I don't know if it\nis or not -- that you're able to get twice the price\nfor the ink than you otherwise would get, does that --\nis that any evidence of market power?\nMR. PINCUS: Well, first of all, that -- that\nis not -- not true. The record reflects that the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, if it were what the\nrecord reflected.\nMR. PINCUS: Well, if it were what the record\nreflected and there was a relevant market that was --\nthat was restricted to this ink, yes. But we don't\nthink that the existence of a patent, even in the\nrequirements context, fulfills that test for the reason\nthat the economic literature is quite clear that price\ndiscrimination, which is what their theory -- their --\ntheir theory is metering should be sufficient to give\nrise to a presumption because price discrimination\nsupposedly signals market power. But as we discuss in\nour reply brief, there is a tremendous amount of\neconomic literature that says that is in fact not true,\nthat price discrimination occurs in very competitive\nmarkets from airlines to restaurants to coupons.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But isn't it also true that\nsome -- some economists disagree? And I'm just\nwondering if there's disagreement among economists,\nshould we take one view over the other?\nMR. PINCUS: Well, I think the problem, Your\nHonor, is that the presumption does take one view over\nanother based on -- based on something that was adopted\nat the time there was no analysis. The presumption\nsays we're going to presume market power, and as\nJustice Scalia said, we're going to put the entire\nburden of refuting market power, in this one context,\nseparate from all of antitrust analysis, on the\ndefendant. And we're only going to do it in tying.\nWe're not going to do it in exclusive -- vertical\nexclusive dealing arrangements where the product is a\ntie. In that situation, which theoretically should be\nexactly the same, there's never been a assumption that\nthere should be a market power presumption when the\nproduct that's the subject of the exclusive dealing\narrangement is patented. Territorial arrangements.\nThere's never been an assertion that that's true.\nThis -- this is a relic really of the fact\nthat when the Court decided these patent tying cases,\nthere was a hostility to the expansion of -- of\nintellectual property rights beyond the scope of the\npatent. That first was reflected in patent misuse\ndoctrine, and then it was carried over to antitrust\ndoctrine without any analysis about whether the\nassertion that the patent was unique, and therefore\nthere were anticompetitive effects, had anything to do\nwith the level of anticompetitive effect that the\nCourt required to show an illegal tie.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Pincus, let me go -- ask\nyou to follow up on that and, in effect, go back to --\nto Justice Ginsburg's question. I will assume that\npatents as such do not give market power. I will\nassume that there are many successful ties in which\nthat is also not true.\nWhat is -- is your kind of short answer to\nthe -- to the argument, which I think Justice Ginsburg\nwas getting to, that if it is, in fact, worth\nlitigating in an antitrust case, that is a pretty good\n-- darned good reason to assume that there is market\npower and that it is, of course, having a\ndiscriminatory price effect? What's the short answer\nto that?\nMR. PINCUS: I think the short answer to\nthat, Your Honor, is that there are a lot of antitrust\ncases that are filed that aren't successful, and\nthere's no reason to believe that just because a\nplaintiff files a case, that it is going to be\nsuccessful. And, in fact, establishing a rule that the\nfiling of the case meets an element is -- is a bit of\nan attractive nuisance.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I was going to say I --\nMR. PINCUS: It's going to attract claims --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- I would have thought the\nanswer was you could say that in any case in which an\nantitrust case is -- is brought. So essentially it --\nit gets to be reductionist.\nMR. PINCUS: Well, and I think it's an\nattractive nuisance. If that's the rule, if I can\nsatisfy the rule by filing a lawsuit, I'm certainly\nencouraged to file a lawsuit regardless of whether\nthere's underlying really market power or not because I\n-- no one will ever -- I won't have to worry about it.\nThe burden will be shifted to my opponent.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: In other words, the fact --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you think the\nexistence of the laws of -- of -- the existence of the\nlawsuit -- of -- of the presumption is what drives a\nlawsuit?\nMR. PINCUS: Yes, exactly, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, does it drive the -- I\nmean, it -- it drives the lawsuit with respect to one\nelement. And -- and I -- I guess one argument is if --\nif we reaffirm the rule that you're challenging, it\nwill invite more lawsuits. They'll say, boy, the\nSupreme Court really means it with this presumption\nnow.\nHas that, in fact, been the case that the\npresumption, at least as it has been understood up to\nthis point, has driven lawsuits and, in fact, has\ndriven lawsuits that ultimately were unsuccessful even\nthough the market power point was, of course,\nsatisfied?\nMR. PINCUS: Well, there certainly have been\nlawsuits that are unsuccessful, but -- but, Your Honor,\none of the problems with our litigation system is many\ncases are not tried to completion on the merits,\nespecially expensive antitrust cases. So if a case --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but this is -- this is\nbasically a practical question, and I -- I'm trying to\nget a -- I guess because I'm not an antitrust lawyer,\nI'm trying to get a handle on how the presumption is\nactually working in the system, and I'm not sure that I\nunderstand it.\nMR. PINCUS: Well, right now I would say the\npresumption status is somewhat murky. When the -- when\nthe Antitrust Division in the FTC came out with their\nguidelines and essentially disavowed and rejected the\nrecognition of a presumption and the Sixth Circuit also\nrejected the existence of the presumption, there was a\n-- both a conflict among the courts of appeals and\ncertainly amongst the district courts. And also, you\nhad the Federal regulators saying this presumption\ndoesn't make sense. That, I think, chilled to a large\nextent -- not completely, but to some extent -- what\nwould otherwise have been -- what would have happened\nin the lower courts if there had been a full-throated\naffirmance of the presumption.\nAnd I think the issue now is prognosticating\na bit what will happen if the Court were to affirm the\npresumption. And I think it is a fair assumption that\na presumption that says if you file a lawsuit alleging\ntying of a product that has a patent or is patented,\nthen the filing of the lawsuit plus the patent means\nthat the burden of market power has shifted, then if\nI'm a competitor trying to put some cost on my\ncompetitor in a market, that's a pretty low-cost thing\nto do because all I do is file the lawsuit. I get the\nbenefit of presumption. They've got to spend the money\nto disprove market power.\nAnd the market power element is peculiarly\nimportant in the tying context because we're dealing\nhere with a per se rule, although a somewhat peculiar\nper se rule because it has these four prerequisites.\nBut the market power one is the critical one and\ncertainly one that the Court identified --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose it's the other one\nthat's the critical one.\nMR. PINCUS: Well, Your Honor, I think the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And the other one being that\n-- the attack on the problem is there happens to be\ninstances where tying is justified for procompetitive\nreasons, risk-sharing, maintaining product quality,\nprobably Jerrold Electronics. There are a number of\nthem. And the real problem is that the law hasn't\nadmitted a defense. But where the attack should be is\non the tied product, not the tying product. What do\nyou think of that?\nMR. PINCUS: Well, Your Honor, I -- I think\nthere obviously is -- a lot of commentators have\nexpressed concern about the -- whether the per se rule\nmakes sense. And -- and Justice O'Connor. writing for\nfour Justices in Jefferson Parish, made exactly that\npoint.\nBut I think whether or not the per se rule\napplied, there's no logic underlying this presumption.\nAnd -- and at least as the law stands now, the other\nelements are their two products. There are a hundred\npages in Areeda and Turner --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Can I ask you --\nMR. PINCUS: -- with the jurisprudence of two\nproducts. So that's not a test that's going to be\neffective in screening out unjustified claims.\nYes, sir.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Can I ask you how far your\nposition extends? I think there's a good argument that\nif a patent is really a good patent, it doesn't really\nmatter whether the patentee charges a very high royalty\nor gets a -- reduces the royalty and gets profits out\nof the tied -- tied product.\nIn your view, is the rule sound that if it is\na monopoly in the tied product, that there is an\nantitrust problem?\nMR. PINCUS: If there's a monopoly in the\ntied product?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: In -- in the tying product.\nExcuse me. In the tying product.\nMR. PINCUS: All we're asking for is --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I know that's all you're\nasking for --\nMR. PINCUS: -- is the opportunity to\ndemonstrate market power, and if --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- but I'm just wondering\nif it isn't -- if it isn't the logical conclusion of\nyour position that it really doesn't matter, even if\nthere is a monopoly in the tying product.\nMR. PINCUS: No. If there is a monopoly in\nthe tying product, Your Honor, that's one of the\nelements that the Court requires. That would be\nsatisfied, and obviously, the existence of the patent\nwould be a factor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, but I'm -- I'm asking\nsort of an economic question rather than a legal\nquestion.\nMR. PINCUS: Whether even if there was a --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If your position is all the\neconomists say this is a lot of nonsense, I think maybe\nit's a lot of nonsense even if there's a monopoly in\nthe tying product is what I'm suggesting.\nMR. PINCUS: I think there are some that hold\nthat view, Your Honor, but there are some that don't.\nBut all agree that it is critical to show market power\nin the tying product. If you can't meet that test,\nthere's really no problem. If you can meet that test,\nthen there's a division. Some say there's a problem\nand some say there's not.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There was a -- a point\nthat you were in the process of answering. The -- the\nargument is made that this tying product had such clout\nthat you were able to extract not twice but three times\nthe price for the tied product. And you were saying no\nto even double the price.\nMR. PINCUS: Yes, Your Honor. As we note in\nour reply brief, the -- the document that was the basis\nof respondent's own damages study in this case said\nthat the average price charged by Trident was $85. So\nthere's no proof of that. And the district court\nspecifically found, in fact, that respondent was not\nrelying on so-called direct evidence of market power in\nthis case, such as supracompetitive prices.\nI'd like to reserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nPincus.\nMr. Hungar, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. HUNGAR\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMR. HUNGAR: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThe presumption that patents confer market\npower is counterfactual, inconsistent with this\nCourt's modern antitrust jurisprudence, out of step\nwith congressional action in the patent area, contrary\nto the views of leading antitrust commentators and the\nFederal antitrust enforcement agencies, and\nunnecessarily harmful to intellectual property rights\nand procompetitive conduct. For all those reasons, the\npresumption should be rejected.\nThere's no plausible economic basis for\ninferring market power from the mere fact that a\ndefendant has a patent on a tying product. As this\nCourt has recognized, many commercially viable products\nare the subject of patents that do not confer market\npower because there are reasonable substitutes. Nor\ndoes the combination of a tie in a patent provide a\nvalid basis for presuming market power. The patent may\nbe entirely incidental and tying is ubiquitous in fully\ncompetitive markets.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Mr. Hungar, is the issue\nof the presumption, as it applies to copyright, part of\nthe question presented? And do we have to decide that\nissue here?\nMR. HUNGAR: Strictly speaking, it's not,\nYour Honor, because of course, this is a patent case.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Right.\nMR. HUNGAR: And the only case in which this\nCourt has actually applied a presumption of economic\npower is the Loew's case, which was a copyright case.\nIn fairness, however, Loew's based the presumption that\nit recognized in the copyright context entirely on the\nreasoning of the patent misuse cases. So a -- a\nholding that there is no presumption in the patent\ncontext would eviscerate the underlying rationale for\nLoew's.\nIndeed, as we explain in our brief, Congress\nin our view has already done that because, again,\nLoew's expressly states that the rationale for the\npresumption it adopts is that in the patent misuse\ncases, the Court has -- at that time, had rejected any\nattempt to extend the monopoly. But Congress, in 1988\nin the Patent Misuse Reform Act, overruled those cases\nand held that there cannot be patent misuse in the\nabsence of an actual showing, based on all the\ncircumstances, of market power. So the rationale and\nunderpinnings of Loew's have been entirely repudiated,\nwhich is one of the reasons why we think that this\nCourt ought to make it clear that there is no\npresumption of market power in a tying case where\nthere --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And market power -- you mean\nprice -- ability to charge a price higher than\notherwise would be the case?\nMR. HUNGAR: As this Court defined market\npower --\nJUSTICE BREYER: As you're defining it. As\nyou're defining.\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, yes. The ability to raise\nprice --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Fine. Then you're talking\nabout patents where the person who paid for the\nattorney went to the Patent Office and so forth. That\nwas just a mistake.\nMR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor. Certainly many\npatents are valueless, which is one of the reasons why\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: But then are you relying on\nthat, the existence of valueless patents?\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, that's -- that's part but\nnot all.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If you're going beyond that,\nwhich patents are you talking about?\nMR. HUNGAR: Patents can be valuable, but not\nconfer meaningful, significant market power. What this\nCourt said in Jefferson Parish is significant market\npower. I mean, there can be lots of circumstances in\nwhich a competitor has the ability for some customers\nin some circumstances to raise price to some extent,\nbut we wouldn't consider that significant market power.\nAnd patents can confer value in other ways.\nFor instance, in many high-tech industries in the\nmodern high-tech environment, a patent library is\nnecessary merely in order to get cross licenses from\nyour competitors that would allow each of you to\ncompete. They're fully competitive markets, but\nwithout a patent library, you can't get in the door.\nAnd all the competitors have their patent libraries and\nthey agree to cross licenses to avoid the -- the\ninconvenience and cost of patent infringement.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, I see.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Mr. Hungar, one of the\namicus briefs for the respondent was submitted by a\nprofessor, I think, named Barry Nalebuff --\nMR. HUNGAR: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- which took the view\nthat the Court should, in any event, retain the\npresumption where a patent is being used to impose a\nvariable or a requirements tie. Do you have any\ncomment on that view?\nMR. HUNGAR: Yes, Your Honor. We think\nthat's wrong for several reasons.\nIn the first place, the presumption\nrecognized in Loew's, of course, has nothing to do with\na requirements tie. So, in effect, what that brief is\nurging the Court to do is not to retain the Loew's\npresumption but, rather, to create a new one. And\nthere is certainly not the requisite evidentiary basis\nor consensus among --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it wouldn't be a new\none. It would be just following the old IBM case and\nall those cases.\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, Your Honor, those -- those\ncases don't state a presumption of market power.\nMarket power wasn't even relevant in those days.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, but that's the example\nthey're saying it would be following. It's not a brand\nnew idea.\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, it is a brand new idea in\nthe sense that they would -- they would ask the Court\nto adopt a presumption of market power, which the Court\ndid not recognize in the IBM case or any of those cases\nbecause market power was not a part of the analysis in\nthose cases. It wasn't relevant. It wasn't relevant\nin the -- even in the International Salt case where the\nCourt -- where the Court later made clear that the --\nthe ability to prove the absence of market power was\ndeemed irrelevant by the Court in International Salt.\nMarket power's relevance didn't even begin to be\nrecognized --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But your -- your answer to\nJustice O'Connor is there should be no distinction even\nif there is evidence that there's a long-term\nrelationship, a requirements relationship, and an\nincrease in price.\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, an increase in price is a\nseparate issue which might or might not, depending on\nthe circumstances, be probative of market power in the\n-- in the tied product market or, again, depending on\nthe circumstances, it might be probative of market\npower in the tying market and certainly a plaintiff\nwould be able to rely on such evidence if they could\nestablish it.\nBut the -- the fact of a requirements tie,\nstanding alone together with a patent, is not\nmeaningfully probative of market power. His\nthesis is that requirements tie is always used for\nmetering, and metering is evidence of price\ndiscrimination, and price discrimination is evidence of\nmarket power. But again, there's a great deal of\ndisagreement and, indeed, the majority view is that\nprice discrimination is not necessarily or even usually\nevidence of market power. In fact, price\ndiscrimination is common in entirely competitive\nmarkets such as grocery retailing, airline industry,\nand many other contexts. So -- so the -- the logic of\nthe -- of the presumption he urges doesn't even hold\ntogether, and certainly there isn't the relevant -- the\nrequisite consensus that would justify the fashioning\nof a new presumption that has never been recognized by\nthe Court before.\nThe Loew's --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does the Government\nhave -- I'd like to ask you the same question Justice\nStevens asked Mr. Pincus about the broader question.\nMuch of the economic literature on which you rely sort\nof sweeps aside the particular question today because\nit rejects the notion of tying as a problem in the\nfirst place. But does the Government have a position\non that? Assuming there's monopoly power in the tying\nproduct, the Government's position is that that still\npresents an antitrust problem?\nMR. HUNGAR: Well --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This is not part of\na broader approach to get rid of the tying issue\naltogether, is it?\nMR. HUNGAR: Certainly we have not asked the\nCourt to -- to do that, and that's not necessary to\naddress in this case. The -- they're really two\nseparate issues. That is, is it -- is it rational to\npresume market power from the existence of a patent is\nquite separate and distinct in our view from the\nquestion whether it's rational to have a per se tying\nrule when there is market power. They're completely\ndistinct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And -- and what is\nthe Government's position on the latter question?\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, Justice O'Connor made\npersuasive points in her concurring opinion in\nJefferson Parish in which she explained why, in the\nview of those Justices, that the per se rule does not\nmake a whole lot of economic sense. We have not taken\na position on that question in this case because, in\nour view, it's not necessary to reach that in order to\nreverse the judgment below which -- which rests\nentirely on the presumption.\nThe Loew's presumption is also, in our view,\nundermined by this Court's modern antitrust cases, such\nas Jefferson Parish and Eastman Kodak, because the\npresumption -- the fact that the Loew's presumption\nrecognizes is not market power in the modern sense of\nthe term, as it is understood and required under\nEastman Kodak and Jefferson Parish. Rather, what the\nLoew's Court said is that uniqueness suffices to\nestablish the requisite economic power regardless of\nthe ability to control price. The Court specifically\nsaid on page 45 of the decision that -- that ability to\ncontrol price need not be shown. That's a different\nfact that -- that is being presumed in Loew's than the\nfact that is now required as part of the Court's modern\nper se tying jurisprudence, which is actual,\nsignificant market power.\nSo even if the Loew's presumption had any\ncontinuing force, which we don't think it does, it\ndoesn't presume the relevant fact under this Court's\nmodern cases. So for that reason as well, the judgment\nof the court of appeals is incorrect.\nAs has been discussed, we think that the\npresumption is not only wrong but has deleterious\nconsequences. It essentially imposes a litigation tax\non the ownership of intellectual property and -- and --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But isn't that also true\neven if there's monopoly power? That's what -- I\nreally think it's a very interesting question as to\nwhether it makes any difference whether the monopolist\nwho happened to have a patent just charges high prices\nfor product A or decides to charge a little less for\nproduct A and make hay out of product B.\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, as Justice O'Connor\nexplained in her Jefferson Parish concurrence, there's\nsignificant force to that argument. But -- but again,\nit's not presented here because there's --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No. I understand it's not.\nI'm just kind of curious about where we're going down\n-- we're going down a new road in this whole area. I'm\njust wondering how -- what our destination is.\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, I think, as I said, those\nare completely separate and -- and really, I would say,\nunrelated points because what we're talking about here\nis not whether -- whether market power is relevant, but\nrather, whether the plaintiff should be required to\nprove an element of its case, which is the normal rule\nthat this Court and the lower courts apply in -- in the\nwhole array of contexts, including in antitrust cases\nin every other context.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: We're talking about\ncomponents, for example. It doesn't seem to me it\nmakes any difference whether General Motors has a\nmonopoly or not when it wants to sell, you know, two\ncomponents as part of the same package. Anyway, I've\ngone astray too much.\nMR. HUNGAR: Thank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nHungar.\nMs. Sullivan.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF KATHLEEN M. SULLIVAN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. SULLIVAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nPetitioners and the Government have fallen\nfar short of the -- meeting the burden that would be\nrequired to overrule a presumption that has been in\nforce for nearly 60 years since the International Salt\ndecision, a presumption that, as Justice Stevens\nacknowledged, reflected the Court's prior experience\ndating back to the enactment of the Clayton Act in 1914\nwith the use of patents to enforce requirements ties\nlike the one at issue here, buy our printhead and you\nhave to buy our ink at whatever price we set for the\nlife of the product, even after the patent has expired.\nIt was precisely the Court's experience with\na series of patent cases in which such requirements\nties had been imposed that led it to set forth the\npresumption in International Salt.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, this isn't a\nrequirements tie case, is it?\nMS. SULLIVAN: Yes, it is, Justice O'Connor.\nThis is absolutely a requirements tie case. This is a\ncase in which Independent Ink seeks to sell ink that is\nrequired to operate Trident's printheads, their\npiezoelectric impulse ink jet printheads used to put\ncarton coding directly onto cartons. And the\nrequirement here -- a requirements tie is that if you\nbuy our good A, you need to buy good B that's a\nnecessary --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But that --\nMS. SULLIVAN: -- operating it in perpetuity.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- that, I would think,\nwould be one of the strongest cases for not having a\nper se rule because if, in fact, you have a\njustification, in terms of sharing risk with a new\nproduct, that would be one of the cases where you would\nexpect to find a tie. And -- and so I'm not really\nvery persuaded by the effort to draw a wedge between\nrequirements and other things.\nBut what I do find very difficult about this\ncase is -- you can see from what I'm saying -- that at\nthe bottom, I think there are cases where tying is\njustified. But the way to attack that would be to say\nhere, here, and here it's justified and that would have\nto do with the tied product. It would abolish the per\nse rule, making it into a semi-per se rule.\nBut here, we're attacking a different thing.\nWe're attacking the screen, which is a -- the tying\nproduct. Now there, that's just a screen. And -- and\nso I'm -- I'm not certain whether attacking the screen\nand insisting on a higher standard of proof is better\nthan nothing or whether you should say, well, leave the\nscreen alone and let's deal with the tied product on\nthe merits. That I think is what Justice Stevens was\ngetting at too.\nAnd -- and I'm -- I'm not being too clear.\nYou understand where I'm coming from, and I -- I want\nyou to say what you want about that. But that's what's\nbothering me here.\nMS. SULLIVAN: Justice Breyer, this is not\nJerrold Electronics. There's no indication that in\nthis case there was any price discount given on the\nprintheads in order to make it up through a\nsupracompetitive royalty payment extracted from the end\nusers by requiring them to pay three times the market\nfor ink. The end users are charged three times what\nIndependent Ink would sell them the ink for directly.\nAnd -- and the original equipment manufacturers, the\nprinters who put the Trident printhead into the printer\nto sell to the end users like General Mills and Gallo\nWines -- they're charged twice the price. So there is\na markup on the ink. This is a case in which a\nsupracompetitive profit is being extracted as a kind of\nroyalty on the ink sales for life.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. This case isn't\nwhat's bothering me.\nMS. SULLIVAN: No. Justice Breyer, if I\ncould just remind us how narrow the presumption is\nhere. The presumption here attaches to one element in\na tying case. There are still other screens. The\nother screens -- the plaintiff still bears the proof of\nshowing that there are two separate products. As\nJustice Kennedy pointed out, if two products are\nbundled together, if the tie is bundling two products\ntogether, there may well be a single product. If\nthere's a procompetitive reason for a bundle, that will\nbe screened out by the requirement that a tie involved\ntying product A to product B. If products A and B are\ncombined as components in a single product, the screen\nof separability will operate. And --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But this in -- as a\npractical matter, this screen is really the heavy\nlifting in the antitrust cases. This is where you need\nall the economic studies, you have the discovery, the\nexperts. This is what costs a lot of money and shifts\na lot of the litigation burden on the other side if you\nhave a presumption.\nMS. SULLIVAN: With respect, Mr. Chief\nJustice, this does not entail a heavy burden on the\ndefendant. What the presumption does is simply presume\nfrom a patent used to effect, as here, a requirements\ntie. And Justice O'Connor, it's not just a component\nin the larger product. The patent has to be used\nthrough the licensing of the patent to effect the tie.\nWe're not suggesting that the presumption attaches to\nany product that happens to contain a patent in the\ncomponent.\nBut when that happens, Mr. Chief Justice, the\n-- when the patent is used through its license to exact\nin perpetuity -- you have to buy a requirement for life\n-- it is quite fair to ask the defendant to come\nforward and say, well, that's not so bad because there\nare reasonable substitutes. We just looked at them\nwhen we got our patent in order to show that it was\nnovel. We looked at what the prior art was, and we've\nstudied our competitors and the printhead market\nclosely --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, except that the --\nthe Chief -- Chief Justice's question -- and it -- it's\nthe same question as Justice Souter had and is what\nconcerns me. My -- my understanding -- and it's not an\nunderstanding based on any experience litigating in\nthis area -- is that when you hire economists, in order\nto establish market power, this is a substantial\nundertaking. It's -- it's a significant part of\nlitigation costs. And what you're saying is that this\nis an important rule so that we -- we vindicate the\nimportant rule by putting the presumption on -- on the\ndefendant. But you can say that with many important\nrules in many other areas.\nMS. SULLIVAN: Justice Kennedy, the patent\npresumption makes economic sense because, more likely\nthan not, a patent used to effect a requirements tie\nwill have market power. Justice Breyer said at the\noutset that a patent is intended to confer market\npower. That's what a patent is -- is registered for.\nIt's intended to create legally enforceable barriers to\nentry that make it rivals -- entrance into the market\nmore difficult. That's what it's intended to do. It\ndoesn't matter that 95 percent --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: More often than not, it\ndoesn't.\nMS. SULLIVAN: 95 percent of patents are\nvalueless according to petitioners' own statistics, but\nthey won't arise in a patent tying case because if\nthey're valueless, they won't be licensed. And if\nthey're not licensed, they can't be used to effect the\ntie.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, that isn't so. I\nmean, you could have a patent that was valueless or\ndidn't itself confer very much, but the person is\ntrying to establish the market for the product. It's a\ncomponent, and he attaches this tied product as a\ncounting device knowing that if it's successful,\neverybody makes money, and if it's not successful, he\nand everybody else lose. That's -- that's the kind of\njustification. And that could happen with --\nMS. SULLIVAN: Justice Breyer, Justice Souter\nasked before to petitioners' counsel, has there been\nany evidence of frivolous litigation, tying litigation,\nbrought where there was a valueless patent to which a\ntie to a requirement was -- was made, and petitioners'\ncounsel could name none.\nThe focus here has been on the wrong pool.\nThe arguments are about valueless patents, which\nthere's no evidence they've been used to tie --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Let me be more specific. A\nperson has a patent on an item in a machine. This is a\ngreat machine. It's fabulous. We've all had friends\nwho have tried to get us to invest in such machines.\nWe don't know what it does, nor does anyone.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But if it's a success, we'll\nall be rich.\nNow, he decides to tie something to that.\nMS. SULLIVAN: To try to --\nJUSTICE BREYER: To tie something to the\ngreat machine.\nMS. SULLIVAN: To make up the money through a\nrequirements tie in perpetuity.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Correct, if it takes off.\nMS. SULLIVAN: If it takes off.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If it takes off, everybody\nwill be rich, and if it doesn't take off, who cares.\nNow --\nMS. SULLIVAN: Justice Breyer --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- that could happen.\nMS. SULLIVAN: Justice --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And there often does, I\nguess.\nMS. SULLIVAN: Justice Breyer, that couldn't\nhappen unless there was market power in the patented\nproduct. There's reason -- there's no reason why a\nconsumer would agree to pay supracompetitive prices for\nthe requirement --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'll put this machine in\nyour store for a penny. A penny.\nMS. SULLIVAN: Not the case here.\nJUSTICE BREYER: By the way, a penny and you\nhave to buy marvelous component. And by the way, if it\ntakes off, you'll buy a lot of marvelous component, and\nif not, not.\nMS. SULLIVAN: This returns us to Justice\nStevens' question. Can metering be procompetitive?\nAnd the petitioners and Government have utterly failed\nto show how metering could be procompetitive in a\nrequirements tie case. The briefs of Professor\nNalebuff and Professor Scherer, the only economist\nbriefs submitted in the case, show how metering is not\nnecessarily efficient. Even if it produces -- produces\nsome kind of gain to production, it transfers surplus\nfrom consumers.\nAnd in any event, metering -- if -- if the\ngoal here were to try to impose the royalty on the ink,\nif the goal here -- if -- if Trident really wanted to\nsay we want to be efficient price discriminators, we're\ncharging less for the printhead -- and there's no\nevidence there was any kind of discount on the\nprinthead here. This is not a penny for the product.\nThese are $10,000 printheads that go into $20,000\nprinters that last for 20 years. So this is not --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I have to interrupt to say\n--\nMS. SULLIVAN: -- the discount case.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- I think your opponent\nwould say the district court made a finding to the\ncontrary.\nMS. SULLIVAN: Justice Stevens, we believe\nthe district court erred in holding that there was no\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Okay.\nMS. SULLIVAN: -- direct evidence of market\npower here, and we urge, as an alternative ground for\naffirmance, that there's ample direct evidence of\nmarket power here.\nMr. Chief Justice?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If your -- if your\narguments are right, isn't that going to typically be\nthe case? In which case, why do you need a presumption\nat all?\nMS. SULLIVAN: Mr. Chief Justice, that is not\ntypically going to be the case. This is an unusual\ncase in that the direct evidence of market power comes\nfrom defendants' own customer surveys, which at pages\n393-394 of the joint appendix indicate that the\ncustomers here were deeply dissatisfied with having to\npay supracompetitive prices for ink when Independent\nInk and other independent providers were offering them\ndiscounted ink on the market. The license here\nprecluded either the original equipment manufacturers\nor the end users from buying that ink. The license\nextends to customers of Trident and to their end users.\nAnd the original equipment manufacturers were deeply\ndissatisfied.\nJefferson Parish says that there's evidence\nof market power when a -- the producer in the tying\nproduct market is able to impose onerous conditions\nthat it could not impose in a competitive market --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But the -- the only issue is\nwho has to prove that. I mean, you -- you could find\nout who their customers are in -- in discovery and --\nand go to their customers and then, you know, show that\nall of the customers are dissatisfied and wouldn't buy\n-- wouldn't buy the machine -- wouldn't buy the ink\nwere it not that they needed the machine. I mean, it's\njust a question of -- of who has to prove it. That's\nall.\nMS. SULLIVAN: That's correct, Justice\nScalia, but it's -- there -- there -- it would take a\nfar better showing than the petitioners and the\nGovernment have made to overturn a sensible rule of\nthumb that makes sense as a matter of theory and makes\nsense of -- as a matter of practice. They've failed to\nindicate a single case in which there's been frivolous\nlitigation over a patent tie. The presumption, if it\nwas going to unleash this wave of frivolous litigation\nbecause the screen was too low, you would think that\nthey could name a single case over the last 60 years in\nwhich that occurred.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We don't know how many\npeople paid -- paid off the plaintiff. We -- you know,\nfrivolous litigation becomes evident only when it\nproceeds far enough that it's -- it's reported.\nWhat -- what I assume would happen most often\nis that the -- the person who has the patent would just\nsay it's just not worth the litigation. Here. Go\naway. We don't know how much of that there is.\nMS. SULLIVAN: Well, in this case that isn't\nso because the petitioner initiated the litigation.\nLet us remember that this case began as a patent\ninfringement action in which Trident came after\nIndependent Ink for patent infringement claims, which\nwere dismissed with prejudice by the district court,\nfound to be unsustainable.\nBut, Mr. Chief Justice, just to go back to\nthe direct evidence point, you asked before isn't\nmarket power doing all the heavy lifting. Market power\ncan be shown through expert evidence, and that's what\nthe district court erroneously said that we had failed\nto provide.\nBut it can also be shown, as this Court has\nacknowledged in Kodak, as -- and in FTC v. Indiana\nDentists, market power can be shown directly. If\nthere's direct evidence of anticompetitive effects in\nthe tied product market -- here, three times the price\none wants to pay for ink in order to use the patented\nprinthead for 20 years and thereafter -- if there's\nevidence directly of anticompetitive effect in the\ntying -- in the tied product market, then there's no\nneed for that expert evidence.\nThis happens to be the rare case in which the\npetitioner was cooperative enough to have taken\ncustomer surveys showing the -- the dissatisfaction its\ncustomers had over a long period of years with having\nto pay supracompetitive prices for ink. But that won't\nbe the general case.\nAnd in other cases, the patent rule is a\nsensible rule of thumb -- the patent presumption, not a\nrule, is a sensible rule of thumb for capturing the\nwisdom that patents used to enforce requirements ties\nare more likely than not to show market power. That's\nwhat they're intended to do through barriers to entry,\nand that's what they have done. In fact, the\npetitioners and Government have been able -- unable to\nshow a single procompetitive requirements tie.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are you conceding\nthat the presumption makes no sense outside of the\nrequirements metering context?\nMS. SULLIVAN: Mr. Chief Justice, there could\nbe a sensible argument that you should always presume\nrequirements ties to indicate market power. That's not\nthe law, and we don't urge it here. We think that you\ncapture the same point if you retain the presumption,\nas it was stated in Salt, as it was restated again by\nthis Court in Jefferson Parish, as -- by the Court in\nLoew's --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'm kind of curious what\nyour answer is to the Chief Justice's question.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. SULLIVAN: Do we -- we argue that the\nrule should continue to be, as it has always been, that\nwhen a patent is used to enforce a tie for a\nrequirement -- sorry -- when a patent is used to\nenforce a tie, that's presumptive evidence of market\npower.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, but the question is\ndoes the presumption make any sense at all outside of\nthe requirements context.\nMS. SULLIVAN: We -- it -- it's not the law\nand we don't urge it in any other context. You need\nnot reach, Justice O'Connor, the question of copyrights\nhere. They are not presented. Loew's was a copyright\nbundling case. This is a patent requirements case, and\nthat's all that's at issue.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Let me try this again, and\nI'm thinking of a way of saying this more clearly.\nThis is my actual dilemma.\nIf I decide this case against you in my view\n-- and suppose it came out that way -- I would be\nconcerned lest there be a lot of big companies in the\ntechnology area that have real market power in tying\nproducts and get people -- and they extend that power\nthrough a tie into a second market and thereby insulate\nthemselves from attack. I would be afraid of that\nreally happening, and everything gets mixed up in a war\nof experts in a technology area about do we have the\npower, don't we have the power, and who knows.\nIf I decide this case in your favor, I would\nthen be afraid that particularly in the patent area,\nthere will be lots of instances where new technology,\nuncertain technology, uncertain new technology, does\nnot get off the ground because a very easy way to\nfinance the risk through a requirements contract, for\nexample, so that we make the money if the product\nsucceeds, because people buy the required product at a\nhigher price. That will never happen. And patents is\nan area where new technology is particularly at risk.\nSo I see a problem both ways, and I'm really\nnot certain what to do.\nMS. SULLIVAN: Justice Breyer, you should\naffirm the court of appeals.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. SULLIVAN: The reason is that we've had\nthe patent presumption for 60 years. It is not murky.\nIt is not the least bit murky. Congress is open,\nwilling, and -- and able to change this Court's rulings\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But why can Congress --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, didn't they do\nthat? Didn't they do that in the Patent Misuse Reform\nAct?\nMS. SULLIVAN: They -- they did not. They\ndid not, Mr. Chief Justice. The Patent Misuse Reform\nAct of 1988 eliminated a market power presumption as a\npatent misuse defense to an infringement action -- in\n-- in a patent misuse defense to an infringement\naction. But Congress declined to remove the\npresumption from the antitrust laws. And while\ncongressional inaction might not always be a good guide\nto what Congress is thinking, here the Senate actually\nplaced legislation in the -- in the bill that was sent\nto the House to remove the presumption from the\nantitrust laws as well, and the House took it out and\nthe Senate acquiesced.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But isn't it\nlogically inconsistent for Congress --\nMS. SULLIVAN: Not at --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- to say that a\npatent is insufficient evidence of market power in the\nmisuse context and then just turn around and say, but\nif you're having a straight lawsuit under antitrust, it\nis sufficient as a presumption?\nMS. SULLIVAN: It's not inconsistent, Your\nHonor, at all because the patent misuse context lacks\nthe other screens that are present here, the other\nscreens that are present here from the other elements,\nand the affirmative defenses, like the business\njustification defense in Jerrold Electronics, like the\nbusiness justification defense in Microsoft. The --\nthe other --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it gets back to\nhow important you think and how -- whether it's true or\nnot that the market power is the heavy lifting, as far\nas all these screens go.\nMS. SULLIVAN: That's correct, Your Honor.\nWe believe that if -- the narrowness of the presumption\nhere is we're only talking about patent cases, not\ncopyright cases. We're only talking about one element\nof four. The plaintiff still bears the burden on\nsubstantial effect on commerce, separate products, and\nforcing. There is still affirmative defenses available\nto the plaintiff. In your case --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I mean, once you start\nthat, then you're saying that -- which I thought was\nthe -- I would have agreed with the dissent -- the\nconcurrence in -- in Jefferson Parish, but that's not\nthe law. And so now what you're saying is, well, we\nhave to go and really make that the law.\nMS. SULLIVAN: No, no, not --\nJUSTICE BREYER: If you're going to give me\n-- if you're going -- well.\nMS. SULLIVAN: Justice Breyer, with respect\nto your concerns about stopping innovation, there's no\nreason to think that the presumption of market power in\na patent tying case has had the slightest adverse\neffect on the important new technological developments\nyou've described. To the contrary, patents have\nincreased exponentially in the 20 years since Jefferson\nParish restated the presumption of market power in --\nin a patent case.\nSo the -- the fears about innovation have --\nthe burden is on the petitioners and the Government to\nshow that a 60-year-old rule, settled precedent of this\nCourt, in a statutory case in which Congress is free to\noverrule it and which it hasn't --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I just ask your point\non that? You are giving -- your main argument is there\nare good reasons to retain this presumption. But then\nyou said even if there aren't, leave it to Congress.\nThe Court created this rule, the market power rule, not\nCongress. Why, when we're dealing with a Court-created\nrule, should we say, well, the Court has had it in play\nfor 60 years, so it's the legislature's job to fix it\nup, instead of the Court correcting its own erroneous\nway?\nMS. SULLIVAN: Justice Ginsburg, the\npresumption here arises in a very special statutory\ncontext. The Clayton Act was passed in 1914 in\nresponse to a decision of this Court which Congress\nviewed as erroneously upholding a patent tie just like\nthe one here. A.B. Dick wanted to sell you its\nmimeograph machine only if you bought its fluid and\nstencil paper in perpetuity from A.B. Dick. It was\nCongress' dissatisfaction with permitting such a -- the\nanticompetitive effects of such a patent requirements\ntie that led to the passage of the Clayton Act. And so\nthe presumption of stare decisis with respect to this\nCourt's rules to effectuate the anti-tying goals of the\nClayton Act is accorded -- should be accorded more weight\nthan just ordinary common law --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: As I remember the text of\nsection 3, it applies to other products patented or\nunpatented.\nMS. SULLIVAN: It does. It does, indeed,\nJustice Stevens. It eliminated a patent exemption from\nthe antitrust laws.\nBut we're not suggesting that patented and\nunpatented products are -- are different with respect\nto the showing of market power. Both have to be shown\nto have market power when they're used to effect a tie.\nWe're simply arguing that when the -- when a patent is\nused to force the tie, it makes sense -- it makes good\neconomic sense today, as it did in 1914, and in all the\ncases that led up to International Salt -- to assume\nthat it's only through market power that the patent is\nable to effect -- effectuate the tie.\nPatents are intended to confer market power.\nThey do in a small set of cases. Professor Scherer,\nwhose amicus brief supports the presumption, has\ndemonstrated that there's an innovation lottery in\nwhich only some patents are successful, but those that\nare successful are highly successful, highly valuable.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We're not even sure, are we,\nMs. Sullivan, that -- that you can extend, assuming\nthat there is market power in the patent -- we're not\nreally sure that you can extend it through tying. I\nmean, there's -- there's dispute among the economists\neven on that question.\nMS. SULLIVAN: Justice Scalia, the -- the\neconomic theories that focus on the relevant pool,\nwhich is patents that have sufficiently high value to\nbe used to enforce a tie, is unanimously on our side\nthat there's no procompetitive value, that there are\nanticompetitive effects.\nJUSTICE BREYER: There are no -- I thought we\nwere just talking about several.\nMS. SULLIVAN: The -- they're focusing on the\npool. Petitioners and the Government have cited a\nnumber of economists who talk about price\ndiscrimination in the abstract. We're not talking here\nabout senior citizen discounts at the movies. We're\ntalking about price discrimination with respect to a\ntying market, in which, by the way, the dangers of\nshrouding information to the consumer are demonstrated\nby this case.\nThe -- the petitioners --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Price discrimination, I\ngather, sometimes good, sometimes not. If it pushes\nout sales --\nMS. SULLIVAN: But the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- on the low side, it's\ngood. If it just extracts profits on the high side,\nit's bad.\nMS. SULLIVAN: It --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And so I think most\neconomists -- in fact, everyone I've ever read agrees\nwith that.\nMS. SULLIVAN: Most -- the majority view is\nthat price discrimination does reflect market power,\nthat you can't discriminate without it, and that's\nreflected in Judge Posner's recent decisions, for\nexample.\nSo if they're -- if they're using metering\nhere to price discriminate, all the more reason for you\nto uphold the presumption here because the metering is\nbeing used to price discriminate the very thing that\nshows there's market power.\nBut if -- to go back to Justice Stevens'\npoint about whether metering can ever be a good way for\nthe monopolist to take his profit on the ink, rather\nthan on the printhead, there's very good reason to\nthink it's bad, inefficient, and certainly bad for\nconsumers for the monopolist to take his profit on the\nink rather than on the printhead because the consumer\ncan't make, as this Court pointed out in Eastman Kodak,\na good judgment at the beginning of how much ink he's\ngoing to need for the life of the product and what it's\ngoing to cost.\nAnd in this case, petitioners did everything\npossible to keep its -- its customers from knowing what\nthe ink would cost over its lifetime. On page 396 of\nthe appendix, you'll see the customers complaining in\npetitioners' own survey that they couldn't get the ink\nconsumption rates out of Trident.\nThis is a case in which, if you shroud to the\nconsumer the true life cycle cost of using the\nprinthead with the ink need -- needed to run it, you're\ngoing to create lots of inefficiencies in the market.\nYou're going to create, first of all, the\ninefficiencies of enforcing the tie. You're going to\ncreate the inefficiencies and social costs of creating\nalternative routes when the customers seek to go\nelsewhere. Think of chop shops for auto parts.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, one of the\ninteresting aspects of this kind of discrimination is\nthe victim of the discrimination is the more powerful\nbuyer in these cases.\nMS. SULLIVAN: Well, we would argue that the\npresumption makes sense no matter whether the patentee\nis a big or a small company, and the reason is, to go\nback to Justice Scalia's question, that the -- the\npatentee will always have better information about the\nmarket for the tying product. Here, Trident is the\nexpert in printheads. Independent Ink, the plaintiff,\ndoesn't know about printheads. It knows about ink.\nFor Independent Ink to try to show that there are no\nreasonable substitutes for the printhead is a very\narduous burden to place on Independent Ink, whereas\nit's a very sensible burden to place on the defendant\nto say, show us that there are reasonable,\nnoninfringing substitutes for your printhead.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You could probably say that\nin every -- in -- in every antitrust case where --\nwhere the defendant is -- is alleging a -- a monopoly\non the part of the plaintiff. It's almost always the\ncase that the plaintiff knows -- knows more about his\nbusiness than the defendant does. It's not distinctive\nhere, it seems to me.\nMS. SULLIVAN: Justice Scalia, we argue\nsimply that it's fair to shift the burden to the\ndefendant. Remember, this is a narrow presumption.\nIt's not a per se invalidity rule. It's just a\nrebuttable presumption.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But isn't -- it's in\nfact easier for you here. You can go down to the\nPatent Office and see what they've distinguished as --\nthe sense in which their product is an innovation and\nwhy it's not just like the other products that might be\navailable that you could use.\nMS. SULLIVAN: That's correct, Mr. Chief\nJustice. But it is harder for us to find out what new\ncompetitors have come into the tying product market in\nthe meantime, and it is easier for defendants to prove\nthe affirmative, that there is a reasonable substitute.\nOf course, in their own promotions and advertising,\nthey said that nothing else is as good as their\nprinter. But it's reasonable to ask them to prove that\nthere is a reasonable substitute. It's far harder to\nask the plaintiff to prove that there's no reasonable\nsubstitute because we don't have access to the\ninformation about their competitors that they could be\nexpected to keep as a matter of ordinary business\nrecords.\nBut, Justice Ginsburg, to return to your\npoint, if there's any doubt about whether metering can\never be efficient, if there's any doubt about whether\nthere could be a procompetitive reason for a\nrequirements tie, evidence that has utterly been failed\nto be presented here, where there's no economist brief\non their side and several economist briefs on our side\nby very distinguished economists cited by the other\nside, if there is any doubt about that kind of economic\nwisdom, then indeed it should be decided by Congress.\nIt's a matter of economic policy to be decided by\nCongress. Congress has not only failed to reform the\nantitrust laws in 1988, when it looked at a bill that\nthe Senate had written and the House rejected it, it's\nfailed five times since then to reject this\npresumption. So there's nothing murky about the\npresumption. It's still the law.\nIf petitioners really believe they can come\nforward with an economic record they haven't come forward\nwith so far, Congress is open and able to correct it.\nBut when this Court has guided plaintiffs and defendants\nfor 60 years with a presumption that still makes good\neconomic sense -- and Justice Stevens, if there were\nanything to the metering argument, why wouldn't Trident\nsimply put a counting chip in the printhead and say we're\ngoing to charge you a per-use fee? Every time you put a\nbar code on a carton, you pay us a royalty. That would be\nthe way to have metering and to capture the monopoly\nprofit through the ink market without all the\ninefficiencies that come with tying the -- the sales of\nink, keeping other rivals out of the ink market --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I suppose you can do that\nunder modern computer technology. You couldn't have\ndone it 20 years ago.\nMS. SULLIVAN: Justice Stevens, that's\ncorrect. Had -- had that technology existed in 1984,\nmaybe Jefferson Parish might have mentioned it. But\nit's certainly the case that today there's no reason\nfor -- to get the efficiency gains from metering\nthrough tying arrangements. Tying arrangements are a\nvery inefficient way of getting the efficiency gains\nfrom metering when there is this completely transparent\nalternative. Trident might not want to tell people\nwhat it's really costing them to put a bar code on a\ncarton because if you tell the consumer, they might\ndefect. But it -- the -- the metering argument is\nsatisfied by a transparent use of counting technology\ntoday.\nSo there's no procompetitive reason here.\nThis is not a bundle. This is not a case where, as the\nconcurring opinion in Jefferson Parish suggested, there\nmight be very sensible ways to see efficiencies in a\nbundle where I buy two products at the same time, an\nair -- a car that comes with tires and an air\nconditioner. But it's quite a different matter because\nthe cost savings from that accrue to the consumer.\nThere are efficiencies that can be passed on to the\nconsumer by bundling two products that can be\nsimultaneously purchased and consumed together.\nBut this is a requirements tie case. There's\nno efficiency that's been demonstrated in selling the\ncar but requiring you to buy gasoline from the car\nmanufacturer for the rest of the life of the car, long\nafter any patents exist. And in the absence of that\nkind of evidence, there's no reason to overrule a\nsensible rule that does not just date to Loew's, as Mr.\nHungar incorrectly suggested. It dates back to Salt,\nto 1947 for arguments in our -- we've argued in our\nbrief that Salt had to depend on the presumption.\nAnd the Court was -- with respect to the\npetitioners' argument that the Court didn't know what\nit was doing when it decided those cases, we\nrespectfully disagree. The Court was well aware, as it\nindicated 2 years later in Standard Stations that there\nmight be some substitutes for a patented product, and\nit reaffirmed the -- the presumption anyway.\nThe presumption makes good economic sense.\nIt makes good litigation sense.\nAnd -- and as an alternative to the argument\nthat you should affirm the Federal Circuit on the\npresumption, we respectfully suggest that there's --\nthere was direct evidence of market power here, the\nsupracompetitive prices charged on ink to both the\noriginal equipment manufacturers and the end users, the\ncustomer dissatisfaction displayed in the petitioners'\nown customer surveys in the joint appendix at 393.\nBut, Mr. Chief Justice, that is the unusual case. It\nwon't be every case in which a defendant is so\nimprudent as to create a -- a record of its own\nanticompetitive effects on its tying -- on its tied\nproduct requirements market.\nAnd in the other cases, it would be a --\nthere's danger, Justice Breyer, that -- there's been no\nharm to innovation shown here. The presumption has\nbeen in effect for 60 years, but there could be grave\ndanger to this Court lifting it. There may be many\nmeritorious anticompetition cases screened out by that\nrule. So we respectfully urge you affirm the Federal\nCircuit.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms.\nSullivan.\nMr. Pincus, you have 2-and-a-half minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. PINCUS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. PINCUS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nJust a few points.\nWith respect to respondent's last argument\nabout affirming on the basis of direct evidence, that's\nan argument that the district court found to have been\nwaived. On page 30a of the joint -- of the appendix to\nthe petition, the court noted that the plaintiff\nprefers no direct evidence of market power, such as\nsupracompetitive prices. And in fact, the price\nevidence that they rely on here was not even cited or\nattached to the summary judgment motions on the market\npower issue.\nRespondent's argument is a little peculiar.\nIt -- it basically is because we can't establish a\nprocompetitive justification for this particular tie,\nthe presumption should be upheld. Of course, the issue\nin the district court wasn't whether or not this tie\nwas procompetitive, so we didn't introduce evidence\nabout whether or not the tie was procompetitive. We\nintroduced evidence about market power because the\nissue was market power. I think respondent is putting\nthe cart before the horse here in that respect.\nAnd there is no consensus of economists. And\nwe discuss this on pages 11 to 13 of our reply brief,\nthat respondent's syllogism of metering equals\nrequirements tie equals proof of market power. Each of\nthose three things are wrong. There are procompetitive\njustifications for metering. Metering and price\ndiscrimination is not evidence of -- of market power of\nthe type that the Court required in Jefferson Parish.\nIt's evidence of some modicum of market power, but not\nenough market power to meet the tying requirement. And\n-- and I -- that's very clear from the economic\nliterature.\nAnd there are other justifications that are\nadvanced. In this case preservation of quality was\nadvanced as a justification. But that's why the market\npower issue is so important. It is the principal\nscreen that -- that the lower courts used.\nRespondent mentioned no proof of frivolous\nlitigation. On page 13 of the petition, we cite a\nnumber -- page 23 of the petition. I'm sorry. We cite\na number of lower court decisions granting summary\njudgment for defendants in cases where, once the\npresumption fell out of the case, there was no proof of\nmarket power. So there is quite a record here of this\npresumption -- attempts to misuse this presumption.\nRespondent also talks about -- frames the\npresumption as patents used to enforce a tie, as if the\npresumption required some causal connection between the\npatent and the tie. It doesn't. All the presumption\nrequires is that the tying product be patented. It\ndoesn't require anything about --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nPincus.\nMR. PINCUS: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The case is\nsubmitted.\n(Whereupon, at 11:09 a.m., the case in the\nabove-entitled matter was submitted.)\n"
