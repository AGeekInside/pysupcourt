Spectators are admonished, do not talk\nuntil they leave the courtroom. The Court remains in\nsession. Mr. Goldstein.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice and may it\nplease the Court: This is a case about the right to take\nan appeal. Over Petitioner's objections, the district\ncourt confirmed a class action settlement that\nsubstantially reduces Petitioner's individual pension.\nThe Fourth Circuit held that Petitioner nonetheless may\nnot appeal to argue that the district court abused its\ndiscretion in rejecting his objections. Our principal\nsubmission is that, as Justice Kennedy explained in oral\nargument in the Felzen case, Rule 23 class members such as\nPetitioner are bound by the district court's judgment and\nthus are parties to that judgment with the right to appeal\nfrom it. Because the Government, although seated at the\nopposite side of the table, actually agrees with us that\nclass members are bound by the judgment, that objector\nappeals identify important legal errors, and that they\nalso deter collusive settlements, I will leave to the\nSolicitor General's representative any arguments to the\ncontrary that my friend Mr. Gold may make.\nQUESTION: Can I test your thesis that u are\nbound by a judgment, you are a party to it? I mean, there\nare cases where someone who has allied with a party and\nhas used the same attorney and has maybe had some input\ninto trial strategy, that that person will be bound by the\njudgment, but as far as I know, we have never allowed, no\ncourt that I know of has ever allowed such a person to\ntake an appeal on the ground that well, since you would\nhave been bound, you are a party.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Scalia, I think it\ndepends on what we mean by bound. There are different,\nmore expansive notions of collateral estoppel and res\njudicata. What I'm talking about here is that the\njudgment operates directly upon the class member. And let\nme be clear that our position is not to move beyond that.\nOur position is not that it's sufficient to be a party,\nbut that it is a necessary condition. It is also\nnecessary, and this is an important point for the\ndistinction between appealing from an approved settlement\nand for appealing a litigated judgment.\nQUESTION: You say that the judgment operates\ndirectly upon the class member, as if we are talking about\nsome sort of physical thing, but how is that operation on\nthe class member different from, say, what might be res\njudicata or collateral estoppel in some other case?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, the\ndifference is that while you can have an application of\ncollateral estoppel or res judicata that extinguishes a\nright to pursue an action, what I'm talking about here and\nlet me put it in very practical terms. The Petitioner had\na pension and that pension went down 40 percent when the\ndistrict court in this case approved a settlement that\nsaid the COLA provisions of the pension plan are null and\nvoid, and that's the kind of direct operation I'm talking\nabout.\nNow, there is an unsettled area of the law\nstretching to precedents dating from the 1850s, the\nso-called quasi-party cases. We don't think it's\nnecessary to apply those here because unlike a Rule 23.1\nclass member in the context of a derivative action, we are\ndirectly bound by the action. We are not talking about\nextinguishing a right of ours, for example, to sue on\nbehalf of a corporation.\nQUESTION: You are bound because a judge\ndetermined that you had an adequate representative. I\nagree with you that every person in that class is equally\naffected and indeed there is no opt out of this class that\nwe are dealing with. But the determination has been made\nthat you are represented by someone who is an adequate\nrepresentative of all members of the class who will fairly\nand adequately represent the class. So as long as the\nrepresentative will fairly and adequately represent the\nclass, why isn't it the end of it?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, that's a good entry into\nthe purpose and function of Rule 23(e). What happens is\nthat at the point that it's acknowledged by the\nRespondents here that at the point settlement is agreed\nto, the class representative and be opposing named parties\njoined forces to oppose objections, and that continued at\nthe stage of the case where you have to decide whether or\nnot to take an appeal.\nQUESTION: Well, Rule 23 what?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: 23(e).\nQUESTION: And where do we find that?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: That would be in the appendix of\nthe Council of Institutional Investors, Mr. Chief Justice.\nQUESTION: It's not in your brief?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: No, Mr. Chief Justice.\nQUESTION: Whereabouts in the Constitution of\nInstitutional Investors?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: (A)(4) of the appendix to that\nbrief.\nQUESTION: Thank you.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: And I'll read it very briefly\nfor the Court's benefit. A class action shall not be\ndismissed or compromised without the approval of the court\nand notice of the proposed dismissal or compromise shall\nbe given to all members of the class in such manner as the\ncourt directs. Now, let me detour for just a moment. The\nCourt will notice it noticed in the Felzen case that this\nrule doesn't actually explicitly provide for objections.\nThe advisory committee notes make clear that that was the\nintent of this provision, and in fact amended Rule 23(e)\nwhich will go into effect next year explicitly provides\nfor the right to state objections.\nTo return to Justice Ginsburg's question, what\nhappens is that this rule recognizes that the class\nrepresentative is not speaking on behalf of the objectors\nat the point an objection is taken. They in fact litigate\nactively for the settlement. Mr. Gold here is on behalf\nof the class representative in this case and goodness\nknows, he will argue that we have no right to take an\nappeal.\nThe rule, 23(e), provides an opportunity for us\nto come in, advise the district court of a problem with\nthe settlement. Our point is that nothing in these rules\ncontemplates that the objector's role would be\nextinguished at the district court, that someone uniquely\nin the context of a class action, who is bound directly by\nthe judgment and participates as of right in the district\ncourt, would only participate at the district court.\nQUESTION: But do you agree that you must\nintervene in the district court, or do you say you don't\neven do that?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, we say we do\nnot have to do that, that there is nothing about this\nCourt's precedents --\nQUESTION: Why not? That is, if this is open\nunder the language, it seems to me there is no real\ndifference between the parties as a practical matter,\nexcept you want to say the person all the time, no matter\nwhat, can bring an appeal, and they want to say what you\nshould do is intervene and that gives the district judge a\nchance to act in an unusual situation as a kind of\nsafeguard to make sure that it is fair.\nI mean, this person could be anybody under the\nsun. It could muck up the litigation for everybody else.\nThe extra time involved might be important, and it might\nbe totally unfair, given the prior history, to allow this\nindividual to bring the appeal. So all they are saying is\nthat the judge should have a chance as a gatekeeper to\nmake that determination.\nNow why not, if it's open under the language,\nsay there is a little more conservative position, gives us\na chance to not get things mixed up?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, let me, there are two\nparts to the question. The first is, is it open under the\nrules and second, why wouldn't it be a good idea to adopt\nit if it were? As to the first, it is not open under the\nrules, and let me take you again to the particular rule in\nquestion. That would be, it's suggested, rule 23(d)(2),\nand this rule says that the district court may in\nappropriate circumstances --\nQUESTION: Where are you reading, where are you\nreading from?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I'm going to read from (a)(3) in\nthe carryover to (a)(4) of the same appendix of the\nCouncil --\nQUESTION: And where are you starting on (a)(3)?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: At the bottom of the page D,\norders and conduct of actions. Your Honors, it says in\nthe conduct of actions to which this rule applies, the\ncourt may make appropriate orders and then I'm going to\njump to 2. This is the suggestion of the other side:\nrequiring for the protection of the members of a class or\notherwise for fair conduct of the action that notice be\ngiven. So there is a suggestion, where it follows, notice\nbe given, and then there is a class that says -- I'll just\ncontinue to read it:\nIn such matters the court may direct to some or\nall members, of any step in the action or of the proposed\nextent of the judgment, or of -- and this becomes critical\n-- the opportunity of members to signify whether they\nconsider the representation fair and adequate. And then\nthe clause: to intervene and present claims or defenses\nor otherwise come into the action.\nOur point is as follows, or is several fold.\nThe first is that this is a different notice from the\n23(e) notice. This is a discretionary notice that courts\ncan employ in some cases, and I think it deserves to be\nemphasized that in the 35 years since 1966, not a single\ncourt has read this provision in the way that's suggested\nby the other side, that it's mandatory that there be an\nintervention for a screening function. The particular\nreason is that this (d)(2) notice refers to intervening to\npresent claims or defenses, and that the not what an\nobjector seeks to do.\nAn objector says there is a settlement on the\ntable, I have a legal objection to it, it's either\nunlawful, as in Amchem, or it's unfair as in this case,\nand so it's a different kind of intervention. So I don't\nthink it's open and no court has ever suggested that it's\nhow the rule should be interpreted. Now, assume the Court\ndisagrees with me, Justice Breyer, why isn't it a good\nidea? It doesn't accomplish anything.\nWhat happens is this. You move to intervene,\nthe intervention motion is denied, so you appeal that, so\nyou haven't really gained anything. What you have done is\nturn the objection into the application of the abuse of\ndiscretion standard. You just added another layer on top\nof it because then the court of appeals has to decide\nwell, did the judge get the intervention motion wrong? If\nthat was an abuse of discretion, then we'll reach the\nmerits.\nQUESTION: What if the court grants your motion\nto intervene?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, then you\nhaven't accomplished anything either. All you have done\nis permitted an appeal that under our theory would be\npermitted anyway.\nQUESTION: Could we, could we go back just one\nstep. You don't have to intervene to be an objector.\nThat's very clear, isn't it?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nQUESTION: And I thought that your basic\nargument was whatever your status is in the district\ncourt, that's what your status is on appeal. If you can\ngo into a district court, which is extraordinary, usually\nthe district court doesn't let anybody come in without\nhaving intervened, but to object to a settlement, you\ndon't have to do anything except say judge, I'm an\nobjector. You don't have to be an intervenor. And I\nthought that your basic argument was whatever status you\nhave in the district court, that you can come in and\nobject, then you have that same status on appeal.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. I had taken an implicit\npremise to Justice Breyer's question that I'll come back\nto. This case will illustrate your point, Justice\nGinsburg. In this case, we objected to the settlement.\nWe moved to intervene. That intervention was denied. It\nis perfectly clear that if that intervention is properly\ndenied, and as to our attempt to come in and take\ndiscovery, disqualify class counsel, that's not within the\nquestion presented. It's not here at the court. We would\nnot have that power as an objector.\nAs an objector, we have only the right to pursue\nour individual objections, which is the distinction I take\nit you are drawing. Justice Breyer, I took the implicit\npremise of his question to be well, why don't we intervene\nfor that limited purpose? And that's I think what I took\nJustice Breyer to be getting at. He is saying what's the\nbig deal. Can't the district judge maybe help us out in\nsome cases where we might have a lot of different\nobjectors and give you a limited intervention right. That\nis akin to the rule that is applied by the Seventh\nCircuit, and that is preserved by the question presented\nwithin the petition.\nNow, the Government adds a patina on top of that\nthat Justice Breyer referred to, and that is don't merely\nhave pro forma intervention, but allow the district judge\nto actually do something and screen out the people we\ndon't want appealing. So I came back to Justice Breyer\nand I said I don't think it will actually --\nQUESTION: You have gained something. I mean,\nnormally the judge would grant it, but let's say he\ndidn't. It would be some pretty good reason. Maybe it\nwould be very unfair, etcetera and you say well, he will\njust appeal that. That's true. But it's quite a\ndifferent matter as an appellate court to decide whether\nthe judge abused his discretion there than to have to go\nthrough what could be 15 years' worth of litigation to\nfigure out whether this settlement nor the circumstances\nis a fair one.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Breyer, let me draw a\ndistinction. My point is not that in an extraordinary\ncase, that a district judge is faced with dozens upon\ndozens of objectors; the case has become completely\nunmanageable; this is an important settlement to implement\nimmediately; that a district court couldn't in that case\nexercise discretion under the broad language of subsection\n23(d). My point is that in the mine run of class actions,\nin every case, we don't need to be doing this.\nQUESTION: Well, what discretion would the\ndistrict court have if your theory is right, Mr.\nGoldstein, that an objector doesn't even have to\nintervene? I mean, in a very complicated case the objector\nsimply says I object, I'm not a party. What can the\ndistrict court judge do?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, I believe that under the\nlanguage of the rule --\nQUESTION: Of what rule?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Of subsection D, and let me\nreturn to the introductory clause, Mr. Chief Justice.\nThere is a, sort of the broad phrasing because we have all\nkinds of class actions. Justice Ginsburg pointed out we\ndon't have opt outs here but in D 3 cases we might. Just\nin the broad phrasing in the conduct of actions to which\nthe rule applies, the court may make appropriate orders.\nAnd I think the court of appeals would be very sympathetic\nto a district judge faced with an extraordinary\ncircumstance of lots of adverse objectors. But I think --\nQUESTION: So you are saying that I am reaching\nout and bringing you into the case in spite of the fact\nyou haven't moved to intervene?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I apologize, Mr. Chief Justice.\nNo. What I'm reacting to is Justice Breyer's suggestion\nthat if there are actually a lot of objectors in the case,\nand it's become a mess, we have a district judge who says\nlook, what in the world is going to happen with this case\non appeal. I'm going to try and help the court of appeals\nout. My point is that I do believe that the district\njudge in that circumstance would have the discretion to\nsay to the intervenors -- excuse me, the objectors, say to\nthe objectors, look, if you all are going to take an\nappeal, we are going to have to handle this here and try\nand create some organization.\nQUESTION: How does he give jurisdiction over\npeople that are simply on the outside; they are not\nparties; all they are doing is objecting?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I apologize, Mr. Chief Justice.\nThey are parties. This is a rule 23 class action under\nSosna vs. Iowa. At the point of class certification, they\nhave come, they are both bound by the judgment and they\nhave availed themselves of the court by appearing and\nmaking an objection.\nQUESTION: Okay. Let's assume we agree with\nyou. What does the judge then do? Does he say I'm going\nto let X and Y speak for the rest of you, and I will not\nhear separate objections from the others?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, no. I think the judge\nclearly is going to hear objections from everyone. The\nquestion is is the district judge going to exercise some\ngatekeeping determination about who goes up on appeal.\nBut Justice Souter, I could not agree more.\nQUESTION: How -- how can -- I'm lost. How does\nhe exercise gatekeeping on who appeals?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Souter, that is our\nfundamental point, is that, let me just distinguish again\nwith the Court whose position is what. We don't agree\nwith this suggestion. It wasn't employed here. We think\nit's entirely unnecessary. I'm trying to achieve --\nQUESTION: No, but you are suggesting it as an\nalternative to Justice Breyer's suggestion that maybe to\navoid chaos, you ought to have discretionary intervention,\npermissive intervention, and if you've got to avoid the\nchaos, then I assume the judge has got to be able in\neffect to limit what some parties objecting can do in\nfavor of what other parties, letting other parties\nobjecting speak.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Souter, I agree with\nyou. I don't know exactly how this is supposed to work.\nIt has never come up in 35 years since the rule was\namended fundamentally in 1966. So far as we can tell,\nneither a federal district judge for a state trial court\ndecided that he or she was presented with such an\nextraordinary case. I don't endorse this proposal --\nQUESTION: Mr. Goldstein, I was very surprised\nto hear you say you agree with Justice Souter when he used\nthe word permissive intervention. I mean, even the\nGovernment agrees with you that if you must intervene, you\nwould be an intervenor of right, not a mere \"permissive,\"\nbecause you are bound by the judgment.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Ginsburg, I didn't focus\non that word in Justice Souter's question.\nQUESTION: I retract my adjective.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: And so that's quite right. Now,\nlet me just put on the table, Your Honors, the fact that\nwe, here at the Supreme Court, the brief suggests oh, this\nwill be so easy. District judges will always allow these\nsorts of interventions. This Court's opinion in Crown,\nCork & Seal makes quite clear that isn't true. This judge\nsaid look, here's what's happening. And this is Chief\nJudge Motz in our case, said, I'm not going to let you\nintervene but if I'm wrong in rejecting your objections,\nyou have got an appeal. That's how it has worked in\nseveral circuits without any difficulty at all, with the\ncourt of appeals having been confronted with any need for\nthe district judges to act as a gatekeeper.\nAnd let me pick up, Justice Souter, if I might,\non the specific problem that you identified and that is\nthe district judge picking out one appellant versus\nanother. There is the grave difficulty that in one\nappellant goes up and the others are not permitted to\nintervene in appeal, what happens when that person\ndismisses their appeal? This is an entirely untested rule.\nQUESTION: Under your theory, any objector can\nappeal, I take it.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.\nQUESTION: And no matter how complicated the\ncase in the district court, they don't have to intervene.\nYou are going to have 15 or 20 appeals.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: But it has never happened. The\ncourts -- that there would be that many separate briefs,\nfor example, or separate appeals. Let me tell you how the\ncourts of appeals deal with this problem. They deal with\nit here like they do in all multiparty litigation. They\nrequire consolidation. For example, in the Second\nCircuit, there can only be one appellant's brief. The\npeople have to get together.\nIn addition, the Rules Advisory Committee has\nmade a very specific point that I would like to draw to\nthe Court's attention with respect to the amended rule\n23(e) that will come into place in 2003, and the court\nsays that once -- and I apologize: The advisory committee\nnote, Mr. Chief Justice, this isn't reproduced anywhere,\nbecause it's a new rule that will come into play next\nyear. But the advisory committee writes, once an objector\nappeals, control of the proceeding lies in the court of\nappeals. The court of appeals may undertake review and\napproval of a settlement with the objector perhaps as part\nof the appeal settlement procedures or may remand to the\ndistrict court to take advantage of the district court's\nfamiliarity with the action in the settlement. There is a\ngreat deal of flexibility built into the process.\nQUESTION: How, in the Second and Third Circuits\nhas, has the procedure been you can object, everybody lets\nyou object, but you can then appeal without having\nintervened?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: In excess of several decades,\nYour Honor, and it stretches in the Ninth Circuit back to\n1979, for example. And so let me point to the Court the\nlanguage that is quoted against us from another court of\nappeals is the Guthrie decision from the Eleventh Circuit,\n1985, in which that court predicted that there would be\nadministrative difficulties, Mr. Chief Justice, with a\nsystem that allowed objectors to appeal. But it has been\nthe rule in those other courts that Justice Ginsburg\nidentified for several decades, and they have not\ncomplained a whit about this.\nQUESTION: Will your rule hold for certiorari\npetitions as well, so if, let's say, a named class member\ntakes an appeal, but then the class petitions for\ncertiorari, that any non-named class member can petition\nfor certiorari?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: No, Justice Kennedy. This\ncourt's rule as I understand it is that you had to have\nbeen a party in the court of appeal, and so the failure to\npursue your individual objection in the court of appeals\nwould require, would mean that you drop out.\nQUESTION: Well, but your rule is that you are a\nparty.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: You are a party to the case, to\nthe district court's judgment. That's correct. But this\nCourt's cert proceedings turn on not whether you are a\nparty in the district court but whether you are a party in\nthe court of appeals, and I can --\nQUESTION: But under your philosophy you are a\nparty to the court of appeals because you are bound by the\njudgment.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: No, Justice Kennedy. Our point\nis this. When you appeal as an objector, as opposed to\nthe class representative, you appeal in your individual\ncapacity to pursue your individual objections. That is\nour position why the Fourth Circuit had it wrong in saying\nthat we were going to take over the case, usurp the role\nof the class representative. That's not correct.\nWe come into the court of appeals, Mr. Devlin\ndoes, on behalf of himself and when his, he is the only\nobjector appellant that was in the court. It is true that\nhe represents an organization, but his individual\nobjections are the only ones that are in the court of\nappeals.\nQUESTION: What you are saying then is not that\nhe ceases to be a party, that the nonobjecting class\nmember ceases to be a party in the court of appeals, but\nthe nonobjecting class member has waived the right to be\nseparately represented by himself, isn't it?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nQUESTION: And the objection, of course he\ncouldn't petition for cert because all he can do, he can't\nquestion anything else in the case except his objections\nto the settlement. That's all he can pursue.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: That's right. That's what rule\n23 sets up. It gives him a formal and important role in\nthe process. And it's important not to let go of the\nreason that exists, and that is that the Rules Advisory\nCommittee notes that, and, understood that these\nobjections are an important part of the process of\nidentifying legal errors as in Amchem; deterring collusive\nsettlements is another important role that they further.\nLet me identify an additional difficulty and a\nreason why you should not have an intervention rule, and\nit applies, I'm trying to advise the court about rules\nthat intersect its decision and rules that are going to\ncome into place in 2003. In 2003, assuming the rules as\nproposed to be amended are actually implemented, there is\ngoing to be a real problem with the Respondent's\nsuggestion and opt-outs. Right now, in a (b)(3) class\naction, we don't have the right to opt out, which I think\nis a point in our favor, as Justice Ginsburg noted, but in\na (b)(3) class action you can opt out at the point of\nclass certification.\nUnder the amended rule, there is going to be a\nsecond opt-out opportunity at the point of settlement.\nOur concern is that if you tell an objector, your role in\nthe case may be cut off, if the district judge makes a\nterrible legal error, and the district judge then is a\nscreen and gets to decide whether or not you are going to\nget to appeal, all that person is going to do is get out\nof the case and go litigate on their own by opting out.\nThe one thing this Court I would hope doesn't\nwant is to spread out all the parties. The point really\nis to keep everybody within the individual judgment. The\npremise of the Respondent's position, it seems to me, is\nfundamentally that we want a class action to be settled\nand over with, just the way a lawsuit of me against\nanother person would be over.\nWith respect, I think that asks too much of rule\n23. We, this is a case involving hundreds upon hundreds\nupon hundreds of people, and it's not surprising that it\ncan't just be settled by one person or another.\nQUESTION: Well, what's wrong with the\nGovernment's position, which is you have the right to\nintervene for purposes of appeal? Indeed you don't even\nhave to file your motion to intervene until after the\nsettlement has been entered as a judgment of the court.\nJust to make it clear that you are not someone who isn't\neven a part of this class, isn't even legitimately part of\nthis class, you are not just somebody that walked in off\nthe street. Why isn't that a problem?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Because the judge already knows\nthat. The only people contemplated by the Government's\nintervention proposal and screening function are those who\nhave already stated objections at the fairness hearing,\nand we know who those people are. If they weren't members\nof the class and they weren't proper appellants, we would\nargue no.\nMy point about all the different hypotheticals\nspun in a couple of pages in the government's brief where\nit discusses the screening function is that it doesn't\nactually add value and it does create collateral\nlitigation. There will be a motion to intervene; there\nwill be mandatory disclosures; there will be the\nopposition to the motion to intervene; it will be\nlitigated and then it will appeal.\nI could see, if the courts of appeals were\nactually experiencing a problem, that the advisory\ncommittee would revisit this issue and would interpose the\ndistrict judges as a screen, but that hasn't happened.\nQUESTION: The advisory committee could solve\nthis either way, couldn't they, the Rules Committee?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: It actually could. And it\nhasn't. The amended rule the advisory committee notes,\nnote the circuit split, and suggest --\nQUESTION: Well, why hasn't it? Why hasn't it\ndecided this?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I think there is one good reason\nand that is that the advisory committee goes through, in\ncycles, of course, it revisits particular rules. Rule 23,\nrule 24. Rule 23 we believe has no role to play, as\nJustice Souter suggested, in screening appellants. That's\nthe rules of appellate procedure and so it's not\nsurprising in amended rule 23 that they didn't take this\non. If I could reserve the balance of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Goldstein. Mr. Gold,\nwe'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE S. GOLD\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. GOLD: Mr. Chief Justice and may it please\nthe Court: The well settled rule that we begin from and\nthat the Petitioners accept is that only parties to a\nlawsuit or those that properly become parties may appeal\nan adverse judgment. The basic point of the Petitioners,\nthe point from which everything else springs, is that the\nunnamed class members are parties to a class action suit.\nThat premise is wrong. In a rule 23 case, the only\nlitigating persons before the court are the persons who\ninitiate and prosecute the case as parties opposing the\nclass, the persons who are served with process and defend\nthe lawsuit as representative parties, and the persons who\nmove to intervene and are granted intervention. The very\npoint of the class action is to provide for representative\nparty suits where the class is so numerous that joinder of\nall the unnamed class members is impractical.\nQUESTION: But couldn't any member of the class\nsay judge, you looked like a representative. I'm not\nadequately represented and at the point at which I'm not\nadequately represented, I have the right to come in and\nspeak for myself. And isn't that exactly what's going on\nhere? A representative of my class is fine, until the\nrepresentative is together in a deal with the other side,\nand at that point, when I object to the deal, I'm not\nadequately represented.\nMR. GOLD: The -- to the extent that that is\nyour point, and you move to intervene to replace the\nrepresentative party, that's a motion that has to be dealt\nwith. The, the \"fairness hearing\" and the process of the\ndistrict court --\nQUESTION: Mr. Gold, may I go back to the\nstatement, you said something, you moved to intervene. If\nyou have seen class actions in the Seventh Circuit and the\nThird Circuit, you can come in and object without\nintervening.\nMR. GOLD: But that wasn't --\nQUESTION: And that, you come in and object and\nyou say I object to the settlement. This representative\nis not adequate to represent me to the extent of the\nsettlement.\nMR. GOLD: Well, but you are not saying that the\nrepresentative is not adequate to represent you for\npurposes of the settlement. Your objection is that the\nsettlement is not fair, proper and adequate.\nQUESTION: Well, then let me put it in your\nterms, and I'm reading from page 30 of your brief. Once a\nproposed settlement is reached, it is axiomatic that the\nnamed representative party who has negotiated the\nsettlement does not adequately represent either the\ninterests or the viewpoint of those class members opposed\nto the settlement. You say it's axiomatic and I was just\nsaying well, you said yourself it's axiomatic that they,\nthe representative at that point does not adequately\nrepresent the class member who is opposed to the\nsettlement.\nMR. GOLD: In -- in the sense, Your Honor, what\nwe are saying is not that the class representative in fact\nhas not properly and adequately represented the class. It\nis that the individual can, has a proper argument for\nintervention on that theory. It isn't that the, the\nindividual in making objections is necessarily challenging\nthe propriety and adequacy of representation.\nQUESTION: But Mr. Gold, if he is challenging\nthe representative's fee, I think he is, which often is\nwhat the minority member of the class objects to, the\nlarge fee that the class representatives, the lawyers get.\nYou can't say there is not a conflict there.\nMR. GOLD: I'm not arguing that there is not a\n\"difference of opinion\" or conflict. If --\nQUESTION: Well, you are certainly not arguing\nthat the lawyer adequately represents the person who is\nobjecting to his fee either, are you?\nMR. GOLD: No. I am not. No. But I am arguing\nthat the making of objections, whether it is by a class\nmember or the, a nonclass member who is interested and\naffected by the class action and the class action\nsettlement, as was the case in Marino, by making an\nobjection is not entering the case and litigating in the\ncase. That is, as a party. That is the very point of the\ncourt's opinion in Marino vs. Ortiz.\nQUESTION: That was somebody who was not a\nmember of the class, right?\nMR. GOLD: That is correct.\nQUESTION: Here you are talking about members of\nthe class and even in this case, people who are made to be\nmembers of the class even if they don't want to be because\nthey can't opt out.\nMR. GOLD: Well, they are the members of the\nclass but they are not parties to the lawsuit. That is\nthe whole --\nQUESTION: They don't want to be. All they want\nto do is to say, as Justice Stevens suggests, you made the\nsettlement deal and the lawyers are getting the lion's\nshare of it and I want to object to that, why can't they\nsay that?\nMR. GOLD: There is no argument here that you\nmade a deal and the lawyers are getting the lion's share.\nHere the lawyers were paid on --\nQUESTION: But we're are not dealing with the\nmerits of it. We are dealing with first you have a right\nto come in and object, and you have agreed that you do\nhave a right to come in and object. Now, the question is,\nwhat more? And what I took to be the principal difference\nbetween your position and the Government's is the\nGovernment is very clear that there is a right to\nintervene. The objector would have a right to intervene\nfor the limited purpose of pursuing the appeal.\nYou seem to hedge on it. First you say it's\naxiomatic that there is a, no longer an identity of\ninterest, but then I can't tell, and maybe you can tell\nme. The Government says of course they have a right to\nintervene, but we want them to be orderly so they make a\nmotion, which must be granted. What is your view?\nMR. GOLD: I don't understand the Government to\nargue that the motion must be granted, and I'll --\nQUESTION: Do you understand the Government to\nsay it is intervention of right, not permissive\nintervention?\nMR. GOLD: It's intervention of, of right, but\nnot automatic. Intervention of right is not a, a motion\nthat has to be granted without a showing. Intervention of\nright is intervention of, to file, to participate in the\nlitigation by doing something. And it's our view that\nsince we are talking about a status to take an appeal in a\nrepresentative action, it's a motion to press a case into\ncourt, into the court of appeals and to litigate the case\nin the court of appeals as, for the class and\nunnecessarily on behalf of the class.\nThe point of appeal --\nQUESTION: I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mr. Gold, I\nreally don't understand what you are trying to convey\nbecause there are two kinds of intervention, intervention\nof right and permissive intervention. Intervention of\nright if you meet the terms, and in this case it would be\nwhen you claim an interest, which is the subject matter of\nthe action, and you're so situated that the disposition of\nthe action may as a practical matter impaired your ability\nto protect your own interests. So I give you one example\nis, well, this case. I will lose -- my pension is going\nto be, the COLA is going to be dead and gone, so I want to\nprotect that interest, which the settlement takes away.\nIsn't that, wouldn't that be, whether I have a\ngood case on the merits is another question, but wouldn't\nI have a right to intervene?\nMR. GOLD: You would, you have a right to\nintervene, but your -- what you are doing if you seek to\nintervene to take an appeal is to proceed on behalf of the\nclass and to invalidate and have vacated the, the\nsettlement agreement which is not an agreement which\neither cuts your COLA, the trust, having acted --\nQUESTION: The, the Government as I understand\nit says yes you have a right to intervene and you have a\nright to appeal to the limited extent that you are\ncontesting the settlement. That's the Government's\nposition. And you are saying that's a wrong position. Is\nthat --\nMR. GOLD: No. I am not saying that that is a\nwrong position. I am saying that it is our view first of\nall that it is a right position. And secondly, we would\nsuggest that the, the standard for showing intervention is\nnot simply that you are a class member, and that you have\nobjections to the settlement, but also, a showing that you\nhave colorable objections and that in, in pressing those\nobjections, you are going to do so for and on behalf of\nthe interests of the class. Now, that's our view of the\nproper standard for the proper showing on behalf of the\nintervention. We think that that standard is exactly the\ncorrect standard for maintaining the integrity of the\nclass action.\nQUESTION: Mr. Gold, that's not the standard\nthat applies to the right of a class member to participate\nin the district court proceeding, is it?\nMR. GOLD: It isn't -- it is; it would be the\nstandard for a class member to intervene as --\nQUESTION: To intervene. I'm just asking to\nparticipate in the district court objecting to the\nsettlement. Don't he have an absolute right to do that?\nMR. GOLD: He has an absolute right to\nparticipate in the, in the fairness hearing. But that is\nnot a litigating right. He is, objectors advise the court\non their views of why the settlement is --\nQUESTION: But he has that right, whether or not\nthe district court may view his objections as colorable or\nfrivolous.\nMR. GOLD: That is true, Your Honor. But the\nmaking of objections is not coming into the action to\nlitigate, but as if your objection is a motion, which the\ncourt passes on or not. The court is considering a\nquestion posed by the litigating parties, whether the\nsettlement agreement is fair and proper in order to be\napproved. Objectors have the right to state their views\nfor the court's consideration. The courts also --\nQUESTION: And to have the court rule on the\nobjection.\nMR. GOLD: No. Not to have the court rule on\nthe objection.\nQUESTION: Oh, you don't think that, they can\nfile an objection, the court doesn't have to rule on?\nMR. GOLD: No. The court rules overall, having\nconsidered --\nQUESTION: Even approving the settlement in the\nface of an objection is the ruling that the objection is\nwithout merit. It seems to me. I don't know. Maybe you\nknow something --\nMR. GOLD: No. The objections can be of all\nshapes and sizes, Justice Stevens. They can be that the\nsettlement doesn't provide enough for the X or Y class and\nthe judge doesn't say that that's precisely what the X or\nY class ought to get, and I reject that as an objection.\nThe judge's role is, is the settlement fair,\nproper and adequate? And the point is, our basic point is\nif a class member wishes to go further and take the case\nto another stage where he is litigating on behalf of the\nclass, he ought to be an intervenor and a party, not\nsimply someone who is not a party. We think that that's\nproper, whatever the right standard on intervention is,\nand we believe that the standard I have articulated makes\nsense in the class action.\nQUESTION: You disagree with anything the\ngovernment said in its brief about the objector has a\nright to intervene, he can do so even after judgment\nwithin the time allowed?\nMR. GOLD: We think definitely that an objector\nor even a class member who hasn't participated in the\nobjection process can intervene to take an appeal and to\nforward the objections made in the objection process by\nanyone, but we think that --\nQUESTION: Then you are disagreeing with the\nSeventh Circuit. Seventh Circuit, as I understand it,\nsays you have a right to intervene, but you must exercise\nit when you know about the settlement, and it's too late\nafter judgment. So you are disagreeing with that?\nMR. GOLD: Well, the Government -- neither, I\ndon't believe the Seventh Circuit has passed on the, the\npropriety of intervention after judgment. Our only point\nis --\nQUESTION: It has. It has. It --\nMR. GOLD: -- that only parties can -- no, they\nsaid that you can intervene after.\nQUESTION: No. The Seventh Circuit has said; it\nhas dismissed. It said you have a right to be here, but\nyou should have intervened when you knew that you were\nobjecting to the settlement. It's too late to do so after\nthe judgment.\nMR. GOLD: Well, the Government doesn't take\nthat position. We don't take that position.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Gold. Ms. Millett,\nwe'll hear from you.\nMS. MILLETT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court. We agree with Petitioners that\nobjectors who have expressed objections to settlement\nagreements have important interests and often should be\nallowed to appeal. Our disagreement is on the mechanism\nby which someone gets to the court of appeals.\nQUESTION: Is that a purely formal disagreement,\nor are there some distinct practical advantages that you\ncan tell us to your rule so that the district judge, I\nassume, can give some shape and direction to the appeal?\nIs that the point?\nMS. MILLETT: There is a practical significance\nto this process. I think it's important to keep in mind\nthat class actions can come in many forms and shapes and\ncan involve up to, as this Court knows from the asbestos\ncases, tens of thousands of people, any one of whom can\nexpress an objection. And it is actually incorrect and we\ndisagree with the argument that you will know at the\nobjection stage whether in fact that person even really is\na member of the class action, who has a live claim that is\ncovered by the class. So what the intervention motion\nprocess allows is, we don't think a merits determination\non the value of the objection, but we think it allows a\ndistrict court in the first instance to make a record and\naddress whether someone is a member of the class.\nI mean, you could have a class action that's not\nas discrete as this one here, but the definition of the\nclass is everyone employed by X corporation for a period\nof 10 years.\nQUESTION: Beyond the determination that they\nare members of the class, are there any further purposes\nserved by the intervention rule you propose?\nMS. MILLETT: Whether or not there is stale\nclaim. But it, you could have objections that really\nsimply don't have any relevance to the issue that will be\npresented on appeal. For example, in this case, I think\nas Mr. Gold said, objections come in many shapes and\nsizes. And if I could refer the Court to Joint Appendix\npage 125, we have an objection that says please consider\nthis letter my objection. That's it. It gives no\nelucidation to anyone on the basis for appeal. Now, how\nthe court can deal with this, this deprives the district\ncourt of any opportunity to address this concern as a part\nof the settlement.\nQUESTION: You think under Petitioner's view\nthat person would be able to appeal?\nMS. MILLETT: That's my understanding of\nPetitioner's view, without having given the district court\nany opportunity, or the attorneys who are representing\nthat person at that point, to address this concern is part\nof the fairness hearing.\nQUESTION: Well, what is the practical\ndifference? I mean, you take the position that\nintervention is of right, is that correct?\nMS. MILLETT: Yes.\nQUESTION: All right. Then the practical\ndifference is that if they move to intervene, they simply\nhave to come physically before the court, so the court can\nflush out the objection, as opposed to merely filing an\nobjection saying I object in which case the court may not\nsee them? Is that the difference?\nMS. MILLETT: They don't have to be there\nphysically, in person, but there is motions practice in\ndistrict courts, and a district court would decide whether\nor not they want someone there in person or not. But\nintervention rights --\nQUESTION: Well, why cannot the same thing be\naccomplished by saying flush out your objection?\nMS. MILLETT: There is two answers to that.\nFirst of all, intervention of right doesn't mean the\ndistrict court doesn't have some final say. But when we\nneed to understand, objections are coming before a\nsettlement has been approved, and it may well be even if\nthis objection is very vague, I have got enough other\nobjections that in fact would capture what that person is\nconcerned about without them having told me. And if they\nobject -- the objection process, the fairness hearing is\nvery flexible and informal at this point and allows the\ndistrict court to gather information and make a decision\nwhether to approve the settlement agreement.\nIt would be very unworkable, and I think unwise\nto adopt a rule that turns the fairness hearing, which is\nsupposed to focus on the settlement agreement and dealing\nwith serious objections, I think that's what courts want\nto do, into a fairness hearing/qualifications for appeal,\nwhere I have got to spend all my time not just deciding\nwhether I should approve this settlement agreement or not,\nso that you would even be aggrieved, but in advance I have\nto decide whether you are part of the class and someone\nwho could --\nQUESTION: Ms. Millett, I would be very\nimpressed with the argument you are making now about\nhaving the thing run neat and tidy, but for two things.\nAre you aware of any experience in the Second or Third\nCircuit that creates these, this pandemonium that you are\nnow describing? And second, when did the Government find\nout about the pandemonium? Because in Felzen, as I recall,\nyou took the position that the objector can come in,\nobject to the settlement, and can appeal for the limited\npurpose of challenging the settlement without intervening.\nWhat happened between Felzen and this case, and are you\nbasing your prediction of pandemonium on any experience in\nthe Second and Third Circuit that allowed objectors to\nappeal for years?\nMS. MILLETT: Concrete evidence of pandemonium,\nno, there is no concrete evidence that intervention is a\ndifficult barrier in the five circuits that have required\n-- in fact, the seven circuits that require this\nintervention motion. So our position is based on analysis\nof the rules. We have an established mechanism in the\nrules for dealing with deciding who will be a litigating\nparty, not one of the 10,000 on the sideline, but a\nlitigating party in a case.\nNow at the time of Felzen, we didn't have as\nmuch experience with the limited intervention option for\npurposes of appeal. And it seems that now when we focus\non the --\nQUESTION: When was Felzen? How long ago was it?\nMS. MILLETT: It was -- I'm sorry. I don't\nknow. About seven years. But in the intervening time,\nthere have been some decisions from the Seventh Circuit\nthat have propounded this notion, in particular, Seventh\nCircuit, that have propounded, and the Eighth Circuit,\ntoo, that have propounded this notion of limited\nintervention for purposes of appeal. And I have to say we\nhave also just reviewed and reconsidered our position, and\nlooking at the text of the rules, we have an answer to\nthis problem.\nQUESTION: Felzen was three years ago. I was --\nMS. MILLETT: I'm sorry. But the point is that\nwe have an answer, our position is that there is an answer\nin the rules to this problem and it's limited intervention\nfor purposes of appeal. And the alternative is to make up\nan ad hoc rule cut out of out of whole cloth. That seems\nto collect a variety of factors that happen to have been\npresent in this case --\nQUESTION: May I ask you, because your time is\nso limited, could you tell us what is the difference\nbetween your view of this case and Mr. Gold's view of this\ncase?\nMS. MILLETT: I think, well, putting aside, we\nthink there is more, we don't think that the objectors are\nparties but we are somewhat more sympathetic to the notion\nthat they have the same interests as quasi parties, I\nthink, than Mr. Gold is. Secondly, and I don't want to\nput words in his mouth, but my understanding of their\nbrief and argument here is that they would have some more\nrigid scrutiny of the intervention as a right motion, and\nin fact would require the person to demonstrate that they\ncan represent the interests of the class.\nQUESTION: May I ask you under your view of the\nrequirement of an intervention for purposes of appeal,\ncould the district judge in this case, in response to the\nintervention motion that was actually filed, have granted\nthat relief?\nMS. MILLETT: The intervention for purposes of\nappeal?\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMS. MILLETT: Could it have, I guess the\ndistrict court would have had the power contingently to\nreserve judgment. Because, remember that motion was made\nbefore the settlement was even distributed and notice was\ngiven, so it would have been odd to grant intervention for\na settlement judgment that had not yet been entered and\nthe judge hadn't heard objections or had a fairness\nhearing. I mean district court can only say I'll reserve\njudgment and I will renew or revisit this question for\nlimited purposes of appeal after I have judgment, if you\nare still interested, if your concerns are not addressed.\nIn this case, the intervention was, again,\nbefore the settlement was even distributed to members of\nthe class, and it was joined with a motion that asked to\nstrike class counsel for preliminary injunction. And so I\nthink, and it hasn't been contested that the district\ncourt was well within its discretion to deny.\nQUESTION: But you could deny it in court. You\ncould say to the extent that they wanted to intervene to\ncontest the settlement, fine, to the extent that they want\nto take discovery, it's not fine. But to say that because\nthey asked for too much they are not entitled to anything,\nis, I would think the Government would say the judge was\nright to say they can't engage in discovery. The judge\nwas right to say they are not entitled to an injunction.\nBut to say that they can't intervene --\nMS. MILLETT: The district court never said that\nthey can't intervene for purposes of appeal because they\nwere never --\nQUESTION: It denied the motion to intervene,\nwhich had many parts.\nMS. MILLETT: Well, it just said to intervene.\nThe motion itself just says to intervene and then was\naccompanied with this, other motions asking --\nQUESTION: So, should not the proper ruling have\nbeen yes, you can intervene, but only for this limited\npurpose, instead of saying motion denied?\nMS. MILLETT: Well, I think if this Court would\nadopt the rule and recognize that limited intervention for\npurposes of appeal is appropriate in this context,\ndistrict courts will know that that's an option and be\nable to address it or raise it with attorneys. But the\nimportant thing here is I think --\nQUESTION: This district judge certainly thought\nthat his wording on the objection, he twice said if you\ndon't agree, appeal it. And the \"it\" was his appeal of\nthe settlement.\nMS. MILLETT: He said that. He also twice told\nhim that he wasn't a party to the case, as well. I think\n-- the point is, you may have thought he would ask, but\nour interest in this case is less the particular, we gave\nthe court our best judgment of how the record --\nQUESTION: Do you disagree with the Seventh\nCircuit, which would require the motion to intervene to be\nmade prejudgment?\nMS. MILLETT: If that's how one reads -- I\nassume you are talking about the Navigant opinion?\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMS. MILLETT: I think there is a prior opinion\nand I'm sorry, the name, escapes me from, which Judge\nEasterbrook also wrote, which we think adopted our\nposition.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Millett.\nMS. MILLETT: Thank you.\nQUESTION: Mr. Goldstein, you have five minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nIf I could make four points, please, about the\nGovernment's proposal starting with its applications to\nthis case, because Justice Stevens and Justice Ginsburg\nwanted to know whether we do here, assuming what happened\nin the district court, assuming we were going to adopt the\nGovernment's position, the Government does not press, so\nfar as I understand, any further whether or not it's\npresented in this court. We have the cert petition\nidentifying the motion to intervene, the discussion of the\nSeventh Circuit's position. The question is what we did\nin the district court.\nThe argument, as I understand it, the textual\nbasis for the Government's rule is that under subsection\n(d)(2) of rule 23 you move to intervene, and the language\nof the rule is that the district court can condition your\nright to intervene.\nAnd Justice Ginsburg, if you would adopt the\nGovernment's suggestion, I think that's what you would\nhave to say was the appropriate result in this case, that\nthe district judge should have seen our intervention\nmotion and because he clearly did believe we had the right\nto take an appeal, he should have conditioned it.\nSo my principal point is that whatever the Court\ndoes in terms of its rule, we prevail.\nQUESTION: Is that still before us, I mean, the\ndenial of the intervention motion?\nQUESTION: I don't think that was properly\nraised.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, let me\nexplain why I disagree. There are, the cert petition, and\nI need to distinguish between intervention for all\npurposes and intervention for purposes of taking an\nappeal. In the cert petition, the question presented\nflags the fact that we move to intervene and discusses at\nsome length the Seventh Circuit's role which we are\ndiscussing here both in the petition and in the required\nbrief, and to that extent it clearly --\nQUESTION: But that's not, I don't think a fair\ninterpretation of the question that you have presented.\nThe question is whether you have standing to appeal.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Kennedy, the reason we\nused that formulation is because it's the formulation that\nthe Fourth Circuit used. It's just picked up from the\ncourt of --\nQUESTION: Well, we'll decide that another time.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I understand. The only other\npoint, I would make, Mr. Chief Justice, about what's\nfairly included in the question presented is I ask the\ncourt to look at the question as the Government frames it,\nwhich it only could do if it believed our position was --\nQUESTION: Well, we take it the question you\npresented and your petition for certiorari, that's what we\ngranted.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. Now,\nthe second is, I'd like to address, Justice Ginsburg, with\nrespect, I don't think that you got a comforting answer on\nthe question of whether or not this has been a problem in\nthe Second or Third circuits, i.e., is there a problem out\nthere that requires the rules to be construed --\nQUESTION: Why is it, has there been a problem\nthe other way? The seventh circuits that have gone the\nother way?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: But they don't, Justice Breyer.\nOur point is that no circuit applies the Government's\nrule. It's a little unfair to say that I can't identify a\nproblem with their rule, since no court has ever adopted\nor even suggested it.\nNow, it is a problem to the extent that there\nare circuits that require full party intervention. That\nyou have to come in, you have to be a litigant in order to\ntake an appeal. The problem is not an administrative one\nso much as that it cuts off appeals, appeals that are\nperfectly legitimate. The rule as we understand it under\nthis Court's precedents is not that only named parties can\ntake an appeal. That's why someone who sanctions can\nappeal and that's why it's uncontested that the denial of\nour motion to intervene gives us a right to appeal. It is\npersons who are directly affected by the judgment,\ndirectly bound by something that the district court did,\nand then what they can do is they can appeal to the extent\nthat the arguments that they properly presented to the\ndistrict court.\nNow, someday, will there be unusual class\nactions that require a further screen? Perhaps. Our point\nis that in an appropriate case a district court could\nemploy the Government's suggestion, but why we would want\nto add the burden of this intervention requirement in\nevery single class action in order to avoid the\nhypothetical possibility, that again has never been\nsuggested by any court, State or Federal, so far as we or\nthe Government have been able to identify.\nThe other point I would like to make, just to,\nalthough again we believe we prevail under the\nGovernment's suggestion, is to take you back to the text\nthat's supposed to require this intervention, and I think\na fair reading of the text is otherwise. There are two\ndifferent provisions for notice that we are talking about.\nThe one is the D provision that I quoted midway through\nthe argument, and the other is E, which is the settlement\nnotice. The point to recognize is that under (d)(2),\nwhich talks about intervening to present claims or\ndefenses, there is no intervention requirement when it\ncomes to presenting objections.\nAnd we are not intervening to present any claims\nor defenses. There is just no textual hook here. To the\nextent the Court did want to look at subsection D, with\nrespect, we think it's the end of that clause that says\nintervene to present claims or defenses or otherwise to\ncome into the case. There is nothing in the text of the\nrule, there is nothing in the advisory committee notes\nthat indicates that anyone contemplated the intervention\nto appeal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\n"
