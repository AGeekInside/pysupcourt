HORWICH\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. HORWICH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Vaccine Act does not provide for an\naward of attorneys' fees on a petition that is denied as\nuntimely. That's the best reading of the Act's text, it\nfits best with the structure and purposes of the Act,\nand it's the result that's consistent with the canons of\nconstruction that would apply to an award of attorneys'\nfees out of the Federal Treasury.\nNow, the -- the textual question here in\nsome sense begins with the statute of limitations, which\nis in Section 16 the Act, and which provides that no\npetition may be filed outside the applicable time\nperiod.\nNow, that provision, like most limitations\nprovisions, doesn't itself actually say what the\nconsequences of the failure to comply with the provision\nare. And in some sense, just as in the -- the civil\ncontext, it's not as if the Special Master, upon finding\nthe limitations provision hasn't been complied with, can\ngo back in time and prevent the petition from being\nfiled, just as a civil court can't prevent an action\nfrom being commenced, or a suit from being brought, or\nwhatever the limitations provision proscribes.\nSo the question really is going forward,\nwhat -- what consequences should there be once the\nadjudicator decides -- once he or the Special Master\ndecides -- that the limitations period has not been\ncomplied with. And textually speaking, it's the\ncorrespondence between the limitations provision, which\nsays that no petition may be filed, and the attorneys'\nfee provision, which depends on the existence of a\npetition filed, that signals that Congress intended the\nconsequences of untimeliness to be visited through the\napplication of the attorneys' fees provision -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Horwich -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There are other -- there\nare other provisions that refer to a petition filed.\nFor example, reporting annually to Congress, publishing\na notice in the Federal Register, those both refer to\nany petition filed. And so in those sections at least,\npetition filed would assume petition filed after the\nrunning of the statute of limitations.\nMR. HORWICH: Well, those provisions\nwould -- those provisions by their terms apply at points\nin the proceedings where we would entirely\nconventionally accept the -- the claimant's\nrepresentation that the petition has been filed in\naccordance with the time limitation. That's generally\ntrue, certainly in the civil context, that we accept the\nplaintiff's allegation.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But don't you -- don't\nyou put in the Federal Register and report to Congress\npetitions that had been filed out of time?\nMR. HORWICH: Well, with respect to -- with\nrespect to reporting to -- to Congress, that's actually\nan obligation from the Court of Federal Claims, so I\ncan't necessarily speak on their behalf of what they -\nwhat they've produced. From what I've seen, it's a\nstatistical report.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, think about the\nFederal Register.\nMR. HORWICH: The Federal -- with respect to\nthe Federal Register provision, I should first say that\nit has very recently come to my office's attention that\nthe Department of Health and Human Services has not been\ncomplying with that provision for the last few years,\nand they are taking steps to bring themselves in -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So they don't file\nanything in the Federal Register?\nMR. HORWICH: Well, it -- they -- they have\nhistorically, and let me -- up till about 2009 -- and\nagain, to be clear, they're taking steps to rectify that\nsituation. But with respect to the period up to 2009,\nwhat they would do -- and this is understandable given\nthe -- the provision that says it's supposed to be\npublished within -- and I believe it's 30 days, that\nthey -- the petitions that are received or that were\nreceived at the Department get logged into a computer\ndatabase, and then a report gets printed out, and they\nwould cross-check them for accuracy against the petition\ntitle and forward them to the Office of the Federal\nRegister.\nIt's not -- it doesn't -- it wouldn't make\nsense in a provision that's supposed to be applied\nessentially upon the filing of the petition, to go into\nan examination of the timeliness of that -- of that\npetition.\nAnd so we think that provision, just as you\nwould -- just as you would describe in a civil context,\nyou would certainly say that an action that ultimately\nproves to be held untimely would nonetheless commence\nif -- for example, if you imagine a statute of\nlimitations that says no action may be commenced, you\nwouldn't say the action hadn't been commenced at the\ntime it was pending. And -- and that's not the argument\nwe're relying on here.\nWhat -- rather, what we're relying on is the\nfact that when you get to the end of the case, which is\nwhere the attorneys' fee provision is evidently supposed\nto apply because -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Horwich, could you say a\nlittle bit more about the reporting to Congress\nprovision because that presumably does not happen at the\nvery beginning, but happens more at the end or in the\nmiddle. So do -- does the Department subtract the\nnumber of untimely petitions from the number that it\nreports?\nMR. HORWICH: I believe the -- the reporting\nprovision is a -- there's a report that the Special\nMaster is to make to the Court of Federal Claims, and\nthere's a report that the Court of Federal Claims is to\ndeliver and -- and those, from what I have seen -\nagain, the Executive Branch doesn't prepare those\nbecause it's the Special Masters and the court that do,\nbut the reports that I have seen, my understanding is\nthat the report of the Special Master is delivered\norally to the judges, and so I don't actually know what\nthe contents of that are. And the report that -- and\nthe report that the Court of Federal Claims sends to\nCongress is a statistical report of all -- actually, of\nall actions filed in the Court of Federal Claims, but it\nsends a kind of an omnibus report in satisfaction of -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: All actions filed, using\n\"filed\" in the normal sense.\nMR. HORWICH: No, no. I actually mean all\nactions filed meaning Vaccine Act actions and otherwise.\nSo it -- it actually doesn't even differentiate the\nVaccine Act -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But is -- is the upshot of\nyour argument then that filing means different things\nunder different provisions of the Act?\nMR. HORWICH: Well, I think it means -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And if that's so, it tends\nto weaken the force of your reliance on -- on filing in\nthe statute -- on the word \"filing\" in the statute of\nlimitations section.\nMR. HORWICH: Well, I don't think it\nmeans -- I don't think it means different things in the\nAct so much as it means it -- it is to be applied with\nthe understand -- it is to be applied as the -- as a\nfair stand at the time the provision is applied.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I meant -- I meant\nthat just to supplement Justice Kagan's question. I\ndidn't mean to cut it off.\nMR. HORWICH: Well, let me -- let me focus\nfor a moment then on the attorneys' fee provision,\nthough, in terms of why -- why that is particularly good\nreason to think that petitions -- a petition filed is to\nbe considered, in terms of what ought to have been done.\nAnd that's because the -- the attorneys' fee provision\nspeaks as of -- it speaks of awards of fees at the time\nof judgment. And so at that time, we know that any\nlimitations issue should have been resolved by that\npoint in the case.\nAnd therefore, it is -- it is an entirely\nnatural -- it's entirely natural to expect that the\nlimitations provision might therefore have some\nconsequences at that stage.\nIn some ways, you can think of it as an\napplication of the old maxim that equity regards as done\nwhat ought to have been done.\nSo we're saying to the Special Master, well,\nif you've gotten to the point at the end of the case\nwhere there's a judgment, and you've determined that\nthis petition was forbidden from being filed, in the\nsense that the limitations provision forbids it, then\nyou should visit the consequences there.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That sounds like a\njurisdictional argument to me. But I understand the\ngovernment to be conceding that this statute of\nlimitations is not jurisdictional. It's just a claim\nprocessing move.\nMR. HORWICH: Well, if it sounds like a\njurisdictional argument, then I suppose the answer would\nbe for this Court to say that it's jurisdictional, and\nof course, if that's true, then our position -- our\nposition would prevail.\nWe think on balance, given this Court's\nprecedence most recently in the -- the Auburn Regional\nMedical Center case, that these -- that this Court did\nnot interpret Congress's time limit provisions to be\nendowed with jurisdictional significance. It doesn't\nmean that it doesn't have any significance. It has the\nsignificance of an ordinary affirmative defense, just as\nit has the significance of the -- the timeliness\nprovision here just has the significance of an ordinary\naffirmative defense, just as -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I just want to make\nsure I heard you right. You said if it sounds\njurisdictional, we should say it is, and you win.\nMR. HORWICH: Well, what I was saying -\nwhat I was saying in response to Justice Sotomayor's\nquestion is that if -- if it seems that that argument\ncompels you to believe that it's jurisdictional, then\nthe Court should reach the conclusion that it's\njurisdictional rather than -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But your conclusion\nis that it is not jurisdictional.\nMR. HORWICH: We think -- we think that it\nis not -- we think that it is not, even if the text of\nit makes it sound like it could have jurisdictional\nsignificance, we think on balance, this Court's\nprecedents teach that time -- that time limits are\ntypically claim processing rules, and we don't think\nthat the text overcomes that view.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Assume I accept -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So using Federal rules as\nyour model, and Federal rules list statute of\nlimitations as an affirmative defense. Ordinarily,\nthat's what it is. But is it an affirmative -- well,\ncertainly it's an affirmative defense to any award of\ncompensation under the Vaccine Act.\nBut what makes it an affirmative defense to\nthe award of fees?\nMR. HORWICH: Well, it seems to -- there is\nnot anything in the compensation provision that says\nthat it's an affirmative defense any more than -- in any\nway that's more explicit than what we're relying on to\nsay that it's an affirmative defense to attorneys' fees.\nIt's not as if Congress said there -- in another section\nthere shall be no award of future medical expenses when\nthe statute of limitations is not complied with, and it\nleft that out of the attorneys' fees.\nThat's not how the statute is structured.\nSo we're in a situation where I think we ordinarily are\nwith statutes of limitation, in trying to decide what\nthe consequences of noncompliance are -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, one of -- one of\nyour -- your argument you were making is that there -\nsince the attorneys' fees provision looks to the end of\nthe case, it should not be construed to apply to the -\nthe failure to meet the filing deadline.\nIs -- is that true? I mean, the statute\nsays if the judgment does not award compensation, on a\npetition filed under Section 300aa-11 -- if the judgment\ndoes -- is there no judgment when a -- when a case is\ndismissed for failure to meet the statute requirement?\nMR. HORWICH: It -- it seems to us that the\nappropriate disposition of a case that is held to be\nuntimely is that there is a judgment denying\ncompensation. And the reasons for that have to do with\nsomething that's not really briefed, but the operation\nof the appellate provisions of the Act -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wait, so -\nMR. HORWICH: -- become confusing if you\ntreat a dismissal as something different.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Other than the judgment.\nOkay. So then -- then your argument that -- that this\nfee provision looks to the end of the case simply\ndoesn't fly. It looks to the beginning as well, if\nindeed dismissal for failure to comply with the time\nlimit is a judgment.\nMR. HORWICH: Well, we think -- we agree\nthat it's a judgment, but it -- but it has to be a\njudgment, I'm looking here at page 26A of the appendix\nto the government's brief, refers to the judgment of the\nCourt of Federal Claims on such a petition. And then\nsuch a petition refers back to a petition filed -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well -\nMR. HORWICH: -- and so that's -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. That's just\nrepeating your -- your first argument.\nMR. HORWICH: Well -- I -- but I do think\nthat -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That petition means -\nmeans a petition properly filed, but I don't see that\nthe -- that the statutory scheme, the provision that's\nat issue here, the provision for the award of attorneys'\nfees looks to the end of the case and not to the\nbeginning. It looks to the judgment. And if it's a\njudgment that dismisses because of a failure to comply\nwith the statute, it's still a judgment.\nMR. HORWICH: It's still a judgment, but it\nis -- it is not a judgment in connection with a petition\nthat should be regarded as having been filed timely -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's your first argument.\nI understand.\nMR. HORWICH: -- that is our first argument.\nBut let me say, it is also -- the -- the situation here\nis not one in which we think that it's incumbent on the\ngovernment to -- to demonstrate clearly how Congress\nwanted to withhold attorneys' fees. The canons of\nconstruction here all caution the Court to be -- to be\nextremely reluctant to extend or -- or find that\nCongress is willing to pays attorneys' fees in -- in\nthis context. And that's for -- and that's for several\nreasons.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, wait. Congress has\nwaived sovereign immunity. It's absolutely clear that\nthere's a waiver of sovereign immunity here.\nMR. HORWICH: It's clear that there's a\nwaiver, but it's -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And once we find that, I\ndon't think we nitpick the following language to\nunrealistically narrow it as much as possible. I mean,\nthe initial question of whether Congress has agreed to\nbe sued is, yes, we -- we assume it hasn't and -- and -\nbut -- but once it's clear that it has agreed to be\nsued, I think we just interpret the language reasonable.\nMR. HORWICH: Well, Your Honor, I -- I -- I\nthink this Court's decision certainly most recently in\nthe Cooper case, from a term or two ago, says that -\nthat this Court considers not only the existence but the\nextent of the waiver of sovereign immunity to be\ncontrolled by -- by canons that -- that counsel against\nextending that -- extending that waiver.\nBut that's not the only issue here. Because\nthe consequences of -- of Respondent's rule are ones\nthat -- that are entirely out of place both with fee\nproceedings in general and with this compensation\nprogram in particular.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Horwich, before you go\nto the consequences argument, just to keep on with the\ntext a little bit, is this understanding that you have\nof what it means to be filed, does it have any\nconsequences other than with respect to attorneys' fees,\nor is that the only thing that -- that depends on\nviewing the word \"filed\" in this way?\nMR. HORWICH: Well, I think viewing the word\n\"filed\" in this way also explains mechanically why the\nlimitations issue becomes an affirmative defense on the\nmerits as well because Section 13 says compensation has\nto be awarded on a record, and the record is defined as\nthe record on a petition filed. So similarly, if you\nget to the end of the case or you get to the point of\nlimitations determination, the court says, well, there\nshouldn't -- there shouldn't be -- there should not have\nbeen a petition here, and so regarding -- regarding is\ndone what should have been done, we'll say there is\nno -- there is no record available on that petition, so\nwe should deny compensation.\nSo I agree it's a little -- which I concede\nis -- is not how we ordinarily think about statutes of\nlimitation, but it -- but it certainly is that -- it is\nexactly the same textual logic in the -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I totally lost that\nanswer.\nMR. HORWICH: Sure. I'm happy to step\nthrough it in the statute itself.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you -- could you\ngo back and talk to me again about what you mean about\nnot having a record?\nMR. HORWICH: Sure. So Section 13 of the\nAct, which starts on page 19A of the government's brief\nsays that compensation is awarded \"if the Special Master\nreport finds on the record\" various matters.\nBut then it goes on, and this is on page 21A\nin Section 13(c), to define the record as the -- as the\nrecord established on a petition filed. And so in the\nsame sense that if the Special Master determines that\nthe limitations provision says, well, there shouldn't\nhave been a petition filed, the consequence is there is\nnot a basis for attorneys' fees. They're similarly in\nthis definitional provision not a basis for the record\non which compensation is to be awarded on the merits.\nAnd that produces the result that we would expect, which\nis that -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm totally confused.\nAre you suggesting that the record shouldn't be filed in\nthat case or that the record supports the conclusion\nthat it was untimely? Or neither?\nMR. HORWICH: What I'm -- what I'm\nsuggesting is -- what I'm suggesting is that when the\nlimitation -- when it's determined that the limitations\nprovision applies and should have prevented the filing\nof the petition, and the Special Master has to decide,\nwell, what are the consequences of that. Because,\nagain, the Special Master can't go back and actually\nprevent the whole thing from having happened, but the\nSpecial Master can say, well, if this direct -- if this\ndirected that there shouldn't have been a petition\nfiled, then one of the consequences is there's no -\nthere's no record on which we should be able to decide\ncompensation.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, as to the\nconsequences, let me give you these two cases. The\nfirst is the case in which the petition is timely filed\nand -- as you see it, but the claimant does not prevail\nbecause the claimant is unable to prove that the injury\nwas caused by the vaccine, but there was a reasonable\nbasis for the argument and the argument was made in good\nfaith, so there would be eligibility for attorneys'\nfees.\nThe second is a case in which there is a\nquestion about when the statute of limitations begins to\nrun. And one of the points at which it can begin to run\nis when there is the onset of significant aggravation of\nan injury, which seems like a question about which there\ncould be a factual dispute. And in that situation as\nwell, the claimant does not prevail on the statute of\nlimitations argument, but there was a reasonable basis\nfor thinking that the petition was submitted within the\nperiod after the -- the onset of this significant\naggravation.\nWhy would Congress want to draw a line\nbetween -- a distinction between those two situations\nfor the purpose of attorneys' fees?\nMR. HORWICH: Well, there's several reasons.\nThe first -- the first one is that in your -- in your\nfirst example where there's been a determination on the\nmerits, the Special Master is in a perfect situation to\ndecide whether there was a reasonable basis on the\nmerits. And this is how -- this is how the program has\nworked since its existence because to be clear, until\nthe decision below, there was no practice of awarding\nattorneys' fees on untimely petitions in the -- in the\nprogram.\nAnd so what you would get would be\nsituations like your first example, Justice Alito, where\nthe Special Master would issue a -- a written decision\non entitlement and these are -- these are 10, 15, 20,\n25 pages long in my experience, dealing in considerable\ndetail with the medical evidence, the scientific\nevidence, the expert testimony, the review of\nliterature, the different theories of causation, and\ngetting to the end, and obviously, if a decision is that\ncompensation is to be awarded, then attorneys' fees\nfollow as a matter of right, but if compensation is\ndenied, the Special Master can and typically does add,\nliterally as an afterthought, that -- but having been\nthrough all of this and having discussed all of this, I\nthink there was a reasonable basis for what was being\nargued here.\nNow, in your second example where the\nSpecial Master has only determined this essentially\ndiagnostic question of when was the first symptom of\nthis particular claimant's particular injury, the\nSpecial Master hasn't looked at any materials about\nwhether the vaccine can cause that injury. So let me\ngive as a -- as a paradigm example maybe the -- what we\ngive in our brief as the -- the Smith case, which had to\ndo with the claim of whether certain childhood vaccines\ncaused the claimant's Type 1 diabetes.\nAnd the Special Master's decision focuses on\nthe question of whether the first symptom of the\ndiabetes was a blood glucose reading that sent the\nclaimant to the hospital, and then -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Excuse me. Could you -\ncould you -- there seems to be a confusion in this\nconsequence conversation. You seem to be assuming that\nthe attorneys' fee award on good faith basis has to do\nwith the ultimate merits, did the vaccine cause this\ninjury. I would have assumed that the award of\nattorneys' fees has to do with whether the petition was\nbrought in good faith; i.e., was there a reasonable\nbasis to believe that the petition was timely. And on\nthat issue, before the Court can adjudicate the\ntimeliness question, it has to know all of the facts\nthat made the Petitioner believe it was timely.\nAnd so I'm a little bit confused as to what\nadditional factfinding the Court has to do. It has to\nbe told by a lawyer, your cases say because reasonable\nbasis has to be in fact and law. The law says first\nsymptom. She experienced X, Y, and Z, and we thought\nthe latter was the starting point of the statute, not\nthe former. What more does the Special Master need to\nknow to adjudicate whether that's in good faith, that\nbelief is in good faith?\nMR. HORWICH: Well, the question under the\nattorneys' fee provision, and this is on 26(a) of the\ngovernment's brief, is a determination that the petition\nwas brought in good faith and there was a reasonable\nbasis for the claim for which the petition was brought.\nThe question isn't was there a reasonable basis to\nbelieve it was timely, the question is -- and -- and I\nthink my friend agrees with me on this -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now, I understand.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But now, look, still, the\nworst thing, the obvious question -- I mean, as a\ntextual matter, but I don't know how you reconcile your\nposition with the -- with the first words in 3300aa-11,\nwhich is talking about a petition starts this whole\nproceeding and you want to interpret that word\n\"petition\" meaning a timely petition. You mean an\nuntimely petition doesn't start the proceeding? I mean,\nthat's the technical linguistic thing, but if you get to\nyour -- to your basic worrying you, what is worrying you\nis this proceeding, okay? That's what's worrying you, I\nthink, the shadow trial.\nMR. HORWICH: Yes, it is.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, on that, Justice\nSotomayor said, you only get into this problem when the\nattorney has filed this timeliness matter with a good\nreason to think his petition is timely, otherwise forget\nit. Okay?\nSo you look at the complaint. You see a\ncomplaint there. He had a good reason for thinking it's\ntimely. It looks, on the face of the complaint, as if\nhis client has a good claim, a plausible one. Now, if\nthe government wants to say, we want to present some\nevidence, let them do it. And if they don't, the worst\nthat happens is this person who thought she had a good\nclaim, and who was reasonable in her timeliness will get\nsome attorneys' fees paid.\nWhy is that -- why is that so terrible? Why\nis that putting such a burden on the government that\nthey have to go through hoops, I think, to try to get\nthese words in the statute, too?\nMR. HORWICH: What -- what we're worried\nabout here is -- is not the fact that some fees may be\npaid. What -- what we're worried about here, as you\nsaid, are the shadow trials, and -- and to an extent\nalso the question of whether additional cases would be\nattractive to the program.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But that's in your control,\nthe shadow trials.\nMR. HORWICH: Well -\nJUSTICE BREYER: You don't have to have a\nshadow trial if you don't want one.\nMR. HORWICH: Well, but -- but -- but, Your\nHonor, I think where we're coming -- where we're coming\nat this from is -- is saying what did Congress envision\nhere. And as this Court said in Hensley and in Pierce,\nCongress doesn't want attorneys' fees to be a second\nmajor litigation. So it seems exceedingly odd to think\nit would have set up a scheme in which the case would\nend on the merits and yet, the question on which\nattorneys' fees are to be decided -- the availability of\nattorneys' fees is to be decided is going to require\nsome further proceedings that have not -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why not -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The shadow trial brings up\nthe answer that you were giving to the second part of\nJustice Alito's question, which you never got to finish.\nMR. HORWICH: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And you were saying -- you\nwere giving the example, suppose this were a question of\ntimeliness.\nMR. HORWICH: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And when did the fact of\nthe vaccine first -- or the symptoms first become\nmanifest, and you were -- and you said that this should\nnot be tried because -- and this is finishing off\nJustice -\nMR. HORWICH: Right.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- Justice Alito's\ndichotomy.\nMR. HORWICH: Yes. Maybe if I finish giving\nthe example I was giving in response to the -- the\nsecond part of Justice Alito's dichotomy in that Smith\ncase. So the timeliness question the Special Master\nresolved was, okay, was it the blood glucose reading\nthat was within the limitations period that was the\nfirst symptom or was it the excessive thirst and\nfrequent urination that fell outside the limitations\nperiod.\nNow, the Special Master, having resolved\nthat, which is something that I think perhaps even some\nof us in the room could recognize that one of those was\nthe symptom -- was likely the first symptom or not, the\nSpecial Master then has to decide, was there a\nreasonable basis for the claim that childhood vaccines\ncause Type 1 diabetes? And that's simply not something\nthat that timeliness determination is going to be any\ngood for the Special Master in deciding.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there's a lot of\ninformation just in 11 -- what is it -- (c), tells what\nhas to be put in the petition. And there's -\ncouldn't -- couldn't a Special Master make the\ndetermination based on that?\nMR. HORWICH: Well, I think part of the\nproblem is that we would be asking the Special Master to\nspend the Special Master's time reviewing that material,\nassuming that it's even in the petition, which is not\nalways the case. We'd be asking the Special Master to\nspend -- spend her time evaluating that material in a\nproceeding that can't result in compensation to any\ninjured person, which is, of course, the point of the\nprogram, instead of spending her time on -- on other\npetitions, and it's that diversion of resources that's\nso concerning to us and we think would have been so\npeculiar to Congress.\nIf I could reserve my -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Fishman?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT T. FISHMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. FISHMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nMy friend started with Section 16. I'd like\nto start very briefly with our reading of the fee\nprovision itself. Section 15(e)(1), which says, \"Any\npetition filed under Section 11 is eligible for award of\nattorneys' fees, even if it's denied, provided that two\nconditions are satisfied. It has to be filed in good\nfaith and with a reasonable basis.\"\n15(e) itself and by its terms says nothing\nabout compliance with the statute of limitations. The\nfiling provisions of Section 11, which are Section\n11(a)(1) similarly say nothing about compliance with the\nstatute of limitations. Our position, therefore, is the\nmost direct and sensible reading of 15(e)(1), is you can\nget an award of fees on a petition that has been denied\nregardless of the reason why, and there is no textual\nbasis for saying that that provision carves out an\nexception for one class of denied cases, those denied on\nlimitations grounds.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if -- if you're\npreparing one of these filings, and you're all set to\ngo, and on the day before your filing you say, oh, gosh,\nit doesn't look like we're going to be on time. You\nshould still go ahead and file because you might be able\nto apply for attorneys' fees. While if you file it the\nday that it's due and you find out the day after, oh, my\ngosh, we weren't on time, then there's no question that\nyou could apply for attorneys' fees.\nMR. FISHMAN: Right. And if I understand\nthat comment correctly, I think that's right, and -- and\nyou see actually many Special Master decisions that\nultimately deny a petition for failure typically to\nprove causation; and when they turn to the reasonable\nbasis standard, they will say literally, your contact -\nyour client contacted you two days before the statute of\nlimitations was going to run.\nYou ran to the courthouse and filed. You\nhad a basis, we believe, for filing your claim. Further\ninvestigation, examination of the medical -- medical\nrecords made you question that judgment, and you\nabandoned the case. And -- and there can be fee awards\nin -- in that scenario.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: My hypothetical was\nnot that you had two days and you made it in time, but\nthat before the -- the time -- after the time expired or\nyou were ready to file on time, but then you decided on\nfurther research, oh, this isn't going to look like\nwe're going to comply. We thought we had the time, but\nwe don't. You should still go ahead and file, right, so\nthat you might be able to get the fees?\nMR. FISHMAN: I think that would depend -\nif -- if you're late, you're late. I think the -- the\njudgment your hypothetical would call on the attorney to\nmake is, why did we miss it, and maybe does that provide\ngrounds for equitable tolling or do we have a reasonable\nand good faith argument as to timeliness?\nIf the lawyer says, I blew it, whether by a\nday or a month or a year, I think that attorney's going\nto have a very difficult time showing a good faith\nreasonable basis for filing a claim that I think in your\nhypothetical would be by the attorney's own account,\nclearly time barred without justification.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So are you saying that\nthe good faith and the reasonableness go to two things:\nOne, the claim on the merits, and also the timeliness.\nMR. FISHMAN: That is what we're saying.\nThat's also what the Federal circuit said. I think the\nword \"claim,\" as it's used in the statute, encompasses\nthe entire case. Causation, evidence that you actually\nreceived a vaccine, the timeliness of your petition,\ndamages, the -- everything you would need to\nestablish -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So how do you answer the\nargument about a shadow trial?\nMR. FISHMAN: There's a number of arguments\nabout -- about that subject. And I think the starting\npoint because it may have been lost a little bit in the\nbriefs, is the government does not cite a single case\nwhere there has ever even been a hearing held on a fee\npetition, ever. And collectively are -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How were the records\naccumulated and when?\nMR. FISHMAN: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How were the records\naccumulated and when?\nMR. FISHMAN: They are accumulated -- the\nsystem that's established is one of front-loading.\nYou -- 11(c) requires an enormous amount of medical\ndocumentation that is to be filed with the petition when\nit's filed. If they are incomplete, you're required to\nsubmit an affidavit explaining what's missing and why.\nThe very first thing substantively that\nhappens with these things, Vaccine Act Rule 4(a) says\nwithin 30 days of filing a petition, the secretary must\nreview the medical records, and if she thinks they are\ndeficient, she has to immediately notify the Petitioner,\nand that is the very first thing that is hashed out in\nthese cases, complete medical records.\nSection -- Vaccine Act Rule 2(c)(2) says if\nyou're not going to rely solely on medical records in\nsupport of your petition -- medical records will often\ncontain evidence of causation. If the records\nthemselves don't and you're going to go outside the\nrecords, Vaccine Act Rule 2(c) -- 2(b)(2) is the actual\nrule, says you're going to rely on observations or\ntestimony of every witness -- any witness, you have to\nsubmit a detailed affidavit of the proposed testimony\nthat supports every allegation in the petition.\nSo the answer is, a lot of it's there right\nat the front end, which is not to say that as these\ncases get litigated and the areas of contention get\nrefined. Additional information can also be submitted,\nbut it is front loaded.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So is your bottom line\nthat the record is already there for the shadow\ndetermination?\nMR. FISHMAN: Sure. And that's the reason\nwhy we point out in our brief, routinely these cases are\ndecided -- fee determinations are made based on the\nwritten materials without a hearing, without any\nadditional evidence. And again there are no cases -- we\nare not aware of a single instance going to the\ninception of this program where there has ever been an\nevidentiary hearing.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And if there is a hearing,\nwould the claimant's attorney get -- potentially get\nattorneys' fees for the representation at the hearing\nabout attorneys' fees?\nMR. FISHMAN: Yes, the law is pretty clear\nthat fees are available for time incurred on seeking\nfees.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Do you think it would be\nwithin the discretion of the court or Special Master to\nlook at a case and say, for whatever strange reason,\nthis is a case where it's going to require some lengthy\nmini-trial in order to figure out fees and that's a bad\nuse of everybody's time, so I'm not going to grant\nattorneys' fees here? In other words -- you know, this\nis a \"may\" provision; would it be a sufficient reason\nthat this is just going to take too long, it's too\ninvolved, so I'm going to deny attorneys' fees in this\ncase?\nMR. FISHMAN: I think that might well be\nwithin a Special Master's discretion, if it really is\ngoing -- if a fee determination really will require the\nsort of parade of horribles that the government sees.\nIt's not our case, but I think it could be possible and\n-- and within their discretion in a subsequent case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You think the Special\nMaster \"may\" award -- so it \"may\" award is\ndiscretionary.\nMR. FISHMAN: Correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's a tough\nposition, isn't it? I mean, if you have got a difficult\nand tough and complicated case, well, you get no fees;\nbut if you've got an easy one, well, then you get fees.\nMR. FISHMAN: I don't know -- the -- no\ncourt and the parties have not briefed or addressed in\nthis case the -- the extent to which the \"may\"\ndiscretion can be exercised in a procedural way that\nJustice Kagan's hypothetical proposes. I'm just saying,\nI can't stand here and give you a hard and fast rule\nthat says that will never be appropriate.\nMaybe if that case comes before a court and\na Special Master has done that, the argument will be\nit's an abuse of discretion.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought you\nwere -- I thought you were giving us that argument when\nyou said under the fees all you need is reasonable and\ngood faith.\nMR. FISHMAN: Those are the requirements to\nbe eligible for an award of fees, the statutory\nrequirements for eligibility. But just because you meet\ngood faith and reasonable basis does not necessarily\nmean you get fees for the -- for the reasons just\ndiscussed. It is discretionary.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So is one reason\nthat should affect the exercise of discretion is that\nyou didn't comply with the statute of limitations?\nMR. FISHMAN: I think it might be. There -\nthe law is not -- this is not the issue in our case, so\nit's -- it's -- it's difficult to know the precise\ncontours of the exercise of discretion in a case where\nnobody's contended that the discretion couldn't properly\nbe exercised.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, let's take -- let's\ntake this case. What would you put in to show that you\nhave been reasonable, in good faith and reasonable, one,\nas to the claim; and two, as to the attorneys' fees?\nWhat -- what would the Special Master have to look at to\nmake those determinations in this case?\nMR. FISHMAN: I will take the second part\nfirst, reasonableness of statute of limitations. The\nFederal Circuit has already ruled that we were\nreasonable to bring this case in terms of timeliness\nbecause of the case law as it existed at the time the\npetition was filed, the fact that we actually prevailed\non the timeliness question before the three-judge panel.\nSo the Federal -- I think on that question the Federal\nCircuit has resolved it.\nBut if you want to go beyond that, I think\nyou would look at our briefs and the laws that existed\nand the analysis of the various courts that have looked\nat this and said -- and say, that was a close call, you\nactually prevailed for a couple years on this question.\nThat's reasonable, and that's good faith.\nAs to the merits, it is all the material\nthat accompanied our petition, which is principally\nmedical records, also some medical studies linking the\nHepatitis B vaccine to MS, and then a number of\naffidavits that were filed subsequently. And I think\nthat is all you would need to look at, and -- that is\nthe only thing in the record. Because the government\nhas introduced no evidence in this case at any stage\ncontesting the merits of our underlying claim.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They are arguing that\nthey don't need to, and why should be -- why should they\nbe put to the burden of doing that.\nMR. FISHMAN: The reason is you have to\nremember this is not ordinary civil litigation; it's a\nstreamlined front-loaded process. So the way the\nVaccine Act works is you file a petition with medical\nrecords, as I mentioned before. You have 30 days for\nthe government to object to the completeness of the\nrecord. The very next thing that happens under the\nrules, and it's Rule 4(c), is the Secretary has 90 days\nto set out all of her objections to the case.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But the very fact that\nit's streamlined indicates to me that we should be very\ncareful to enforce the policy of the rule which is to\ndeter the filing of stale claims. And your -- your rule\ncertainly undermines that.\nMR. FISHMAN: I think that you have to back\nup and -- and acknowledge, as a starting point, that\nthere's no question that Congress intended this program\nto award fees on petitions that have been denied. And\nas we point out in our brief, petitions are routinely\ndenied on procedural grounds where there has been no\nexamination of the underlying merits, just as the\ngovernment contends is the case with statute of\nlimitations.\nWe disagree with that. We think actually to\nresolve a statute of limitations question, a Special\nMaster is going to have a more complete understanding of\nthe underlying merits of a case than in many other\nprocedural settings. So we know that Congress has\nalready said, sure, it's a streamlined process, but\nwe're not going to pursue that objective at the expense\nof compensating attorneys who bring good faith claims,\nbut lose.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is the -- what's the\nrelationship between your position and equitable\ntolling? I mean, your case, I think, is unusual in that\nthere was a fair amount of confusion about when the\nstatute of limitations might run or that's your\nposition. I would think a lot of the cases where the\nattorney doesn't meet the limitations deadline will\ninvolve things like -- you know, I was delayed by\nHurricane Sandy or -- or whatever, or we were trying to\nfile, it got lost in the mail.\nAre those things that -- I mean, should that\nbe considered under the rubric of equitable tolling, or\nunder -- under your idea where you don't have to file on\ntime anyway?\nMR. FISHMAN: The -- the -- I think that the\nbest answer to that question is to look at the Federal\nCircuit -- Circuit's en banc ruling in Cloer I. We\nactually argued -- we didn't argue snowstorm. What our\nargument was is there was an extraordinary circumstance\nthat prevented us from filing within 36 months of the\nfirst symptom. And that circumstance was there was no\nscientific evidence of a link between the vaccine -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understand that,\nbut I would assume the more typical case is when you\nmiss a filing deadline is because the lawyer, whether\nfor good reasons or bad, missed the filing deadline.\nAnd I'm just curious if you would -- if it's not\nsufficient to support equitable tolling, whether it is,\ntherefore, unreasonable when it comes to attorneys'\nfees?\nMR. FISHMAN: I think that would be a\ncase-by-case determination as to whether the particular\nfacts relied upon supported good faith and a reasonable\nbasis. I think in Your Honor's hypothetical, you would\nbe -- a lawyer would be skating on thin ice there, too,\nbecause the Federal Circuit made clear in Cloer I that\nfraud and duress are the grounds for equitable tolling.\nSo I think if you are going to bring a claim that you\nknow is late and your only excuse is a snowstorm, you\nhave to look at Cloer I and think, I don't have a very\nstrong or maybe any equitable tolling argument.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It does seem to me, I did\nnot have the opportunity to ask the government this\nquestion, that the equitable tolling argument undercuts\nthe government's position that no petition may be filed,\nas being an absolute. Because we all know, I take it\nthe government concedes, that there is equitable\ntolling.\nMR. FISHMAN: They -- well, they fought the\nissue.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Or there can be equitable\ntolling in some cases.\nMR. FISHMAN: Sure. That's the law. They\nfought the issue below and lost, and in fairness, in\ntheir briefs to this Court, they say, we don't agree\nwith the ruling just because we didn't seek this Court's\nreview for reasons that are not identified.\nThat is the law. That's correct. And it\nis, frankly, one in a long list of inconsistencies with\ntheir conception of what it means to file under the Act.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Fishman, this may be a\nhard question for you to answer, but is your sense of\nwhy it is that petitions are untimely filed that they\nusually have to do with things like -- you know,\nsnowstorms and lawyer error, or that they usually have\nto do with questions about the manifestation of\nsymptoms?\nOr something else, if something else is -\njust the range of cases out there, what are we talking\nabout? Why are these cases untimely filed?\nMR. FISHMAN: My understanding from reading\nthe case law is it's the latter. It's not snowstorms.\nIt is here is a disease. I have a child that has been\nsick her whole life. When is the first symptom of this\ndisease? She coughed 40 months ago. She had a -- some\nother symptom 42, and the experts often battle that out,\nand -- and oftentimes the Special Master said, sorry, it\nwas the cough at 40 months that is the first symptom of\nthe disease, not the symptom you've pointed to.\nJUSTICE ALITO: This may be a question that\nthe government is in a better position to answer, but\ndo -- do you have any sense of how often claims are\nrejected on the ground of timeliness, what we're dealing\nwith?\nI mean, you mentioned in a footnote that the\nfund out of which the -- the claims and the attorneys'\nfees are paid has a positive balance of $3.5 billion.\nMaybe the only government fund that has a positive\nbalance, but -\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE ALITO: Is this going to bankrupt\nthe -- the system?\nMR. FISHMAN: I -- I can't imagine how it\nwould even really put much of a dent in that government\nobligation.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do you know how many cases\nwe might be dealing with?\nMR. FISHMAN: I -- I don't. I know that\nthere are not a huge number of published cases by\nSpecial -- unpublished decisions by Special Masters on\nthe statute of limitations question. I tend to think\nthat those numbers will actually go down moving forward,\neven under the rule we're proposing because of the law\non when the statute of limitations runs is so much\nclearer now than it was in 2005 when we brought this\ncase.\nThe other point, of course, is you're always\ngoing to have to show good faith and a reasonable basis.\nSo the government seems to suggest that the rule we're\nadvocating and the one that the Federal Circuit adopted\nis going to result in a flood of frivolous litigation.\nI think that's just not supported because of the\nrequirements you'd have to establish.\nI think there's also no reason to think that\nthat will be the case empirically, and I say that for\nthis reason: The -- the program for 25 years has\nauthorized the payment of fees to losers. It has paid\nout $2.4 billion in compensation to individuals injured\nby vaccines in that 25 years and just about $160 million\nin fees for winners and losers. It is just over\n6 percent. And one would think that if this unusual\nsystem of paying losers really encouraged the filing of\nfrivolous lawsuits so lawyers could be paid, you'd think\nthe number would be substantially higher than 6 percent.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Who pays for the Special\nMasters? Is that paid out of the fund?\nMR. FISHMAN: It is.\nI do want to answer a couple of the\nquestions that were presented during my friend's\npresentation. The -- I was not aware of the fact that\nthe Secretary no longer discharges her obligation to\npublish in the Federal Register, but as we noted in our\nbrief, our petition was published. And her obligation\nto publish it was triggered by the statute's requirement\nthat a petition has, quote, \"been filed under Section\n11.\" Ours -- ours, in fact, was published.\nThe question that -- that you raised,\nJustice Kagan, is there any other situation where this\nreading results in a petition that has been filed. The\nanswer is yes, the government argues that a petition\nfiled under Section 11, even if it's untimely, is\nsufficient to commence proceedings and confer\njurisdiction, which if that's true, it goes to your\nquestion, Justice Sotomayor. How do you get here if the\nstatute -- if the statute of limitations is not\njurisdictional? How do you get from one place to the\nnext? I -- I think there's not a good answer for that.\nAnother question that has arisen, I think,\nJustice Scalia, your comments are correct, that -- that\na filing, a judgment can occur at any time in a case. I\nthink it's also important to remember that the Secretary\nis not bound to defend a case on the merits and then\ncontest a fee award for the same reason. So there are\ncases pending before the Special Masters right now that\nfor reasons I suspect are that the Secretary wanted to\nestablish a precedent, that there is no causation\nbetween vaccine A and injury X, we want to litigate that\non the merits, and they have won. But it wasn't a slam\ndunk. There was a lot of evidence and a lot of science\nto contradict that, which was rejected.\nThose lawyers now come before the Special\nMaster and seek fees in those cases, and the Secretary\nis arguing no fees because these are time-barred. And\nin that case, you are going to have a judgment, by the\ngovernment's account, entered on the merits and then\nthey're going to come back and defend a fee award\nsaying, there is no judgment because there's never been\na case filed, and you can't get fees. And it is just a\nfundamental and glaring inconsistency with their\nposition.\nI want to address a couple additional points\non the shadow trial argument because these were raised\nin the government's reply brief.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Could I -- I have been\nthinking about your last point. Couldn't that last\npoint easily be remedied by -- by simply our holding\nthat -- you know, you -- you can't ride both horses;\nthat if, in fact, you've litigated it through to a -- to\na merits judgment in your favor, which presumably has\nstare decisis effect, you then cannot come back and say\nthe suit never occurred because the filing was too late.\nI mean, we -- I think we're able to hold that, don't you\nthink?\nMR. FISHMAN: I -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, I agree with you\nit's a terrible -- it's a terrible, outrageous thing for\nthe government to do, to win the case and get -- get\nstare decisis effect, and then to say you can't get\nlawyers' fees because there's never been a case, right?\nMR. FISHMAN: Right. I mean, I think\nthat -- yes, and I think that, in terms of authority,\npower, I think that -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We could make that up,\ncouldn't we?\nMR. FISHMAN: I think that you probably\ncould.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Sure.\nMR. FISHMAN: I think you probably could,\nbut I think that the problem is you would then be, in\nessence, adopting a procedural rule though that endorses\nthe inconsistency in the position. A petition is filed\nfor some purposes but not for others, even though\nCongress only referred to petitions filed in -- in the\ngeneric sense. It didn't distinguish between the time\nat which it's entered or the basis on which it's\nentered. And it could have easily done these things.\nThe -- the government is proposing this\nlegal fiction. Well, they say, sure, I mean, it can be\ntendered and accepted and you can litigate it for years\nand there can be all sorts of rulings, but as soon as\nthe Special Master enters a ruling on timeliness, the\nphrase is they're bound to, quote, \"refuse to recognize\"\nthat it has ever been filed.\nThey could have established that -- Congress\ncould have established that legal fiction. It could\nhave said no petition shall be deemed to be filed if it\nis brought after the statute of limitations has run.\nOr Congress could have achieved this same\nconsequence that the government is attributing to\nSection 16 by enacting a rule like this Court's Rule\n13-2; the court will not -- will not file a cert\npetition that is untimely.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You were going to address\nthe shadow trial?\nMR. FISHMAN: Yeah, a couple -- a couple\nquick points. We cited 11 cases in the discussion of\nour -- in our discussion of shadow trials for the point\nthat these petition -- petitions are denied on\nprocedural grounds all the time, and Special Masters\nresolve subsequent fee requests routinely and without a\nhearing.\nThe government -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Procedural grounds because\nthe affidavits aren't sufficient or -\nMR. FISHMAN: Inadequate records is one\nreason. Sometimes, a petitioner dies, and their family\nor estate does not want to pursue this, so it's\nabandoned. There's cases where there's just a failure\nto prosecute, it's not clear why; the lawyers lost touch\nwith a client or I don't know the reason why, it's just\na failure to prosecute.\nThere are also cases where somebody is\narguing for causation, but as their case is going\nthrough the system, other cases are being decided that\nreject their view, particularly paradigm cases. And the\npetitioners fold, they give up, but the lawyers, having\nfought the cases for years, come in and argue. So those\nare all, incidentally, examples of procedural denials\nthat are reflected in the 11 cases we cited.\nThe point I wanted to make is the government\ndoesn't say which of those cases it's referring to when\nit makes the claim that our cases reflect circumstances\nwhere the Secretary has determined the program's\nresources would be best conserved by, I think the phrase\nis \"acquiescing\" to a modest request for fees.\nThey don't identify what cases they're\ntalking about, but in 10 of the 11 cases we cited, on\ntheir face, fee awards were contested. And they're\nlitigated. And you read the opinions, and the Special\nMasters are resolving the challenges that the Secretary\nmade, and they are doing it without a hearing.\nThere also is this argument about -- I think\nwe've already gone over the fact that a statute of\nlimitations determination is not identical to a\ncausation determination. The additional argument that\nthe Secretary made in their brief is that, unlike many\nother matters that must be supported at the outset -\nthe key question in most of these cases, causation, you\ndon't have to furnish evidence or make allegations of\ncausation -- is not correct.\nUnder Section 11(c), if you're bringing a\nnon-table case, you have to allege cause and effect.\nAnd if the medical records don't support causation, you\nneed an affidavit from an expert. So that is\nfront-loaded as well.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there regulations or\nrules establishing hourly rates?\nMR. FISHMAN: There are not.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you have any idea\nfrom the cases what the ranges are?\nMR. FISHMAN: For rates?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: For rates.\nMR. FISHMAN: It varies region by region. I\nthink the Special Masters look to see what the rates in\nDenver are as opposed to the rates in New York or Los\nAngeles -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I know that civil rights\nrates, for example, are far below market rates for most\nlaw firms. Is that the same for this, or is it market\nrates generally?\nMR. FISHMAN: Right. I think it's less.\nAnd it's not -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Market rates for general\nlitigation.\nMR. FISHMAN: Right. And it's not CJA\nrates -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Right.\nMR. FISHMAN: -- but very often, it's not\nthe rates that attorneys are actually paid. It ends up\nbeing a problem -- as an aside -- with expert witnesses\nsometimes because the Special Masters don't pay what\nexperts in these cases want.\nIf there are no further questions, I will\nrelinquish the remainder of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Horwich, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN J. HORWICH\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. HORWICH: Thank you. I think it's\nimportant -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you have some\nevidence -- numbers -- to tell us how complicated the\nfee award disputes are generally -- putting aside\nbecause it hasn't until recently been an issue for cases\ndismissed -- but for other cases, particularly those\ndismissed on -- other procedural grounds.\nMR. HORWICH: Well, no, we don't. And\nactually, that's the point I wanted to start with\nis that -- is that the Federal Circuit's decision below\nputs the program into this unchartered territory, where\nwe don't really know what this is going to look like.\nThe cases that -- that my friend cites in\nhis brief are ones that either the petition is so\nfacially defective that, of course, fees can't be\nawarded on it, but there's no reason to think that's\ngoing to be the typical case.\nAnd then there's other cases where the\napplication of the reasonable basis standard is so lax\nas to essentially just turn on -- on the claimant's\npersonal say-so, that, oh, I think the vaccine caused my\ninjury. That's like -- that's the Hamrick case, for\nexample; it's cited in there.\nAnd that -- that can't be the standard for\nreasonable basis.\nAnd -- and so I think the Court needs to\nkeep in mind that, for example, when my friend says\nthere's -- the government doesn't cite a case where\nthere's been any shadow trial, the reason is because\nthere haven't been fees available on untimely petitions,\nwhich is exactly the set-up that would cause you to have\na shadow trial.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But there have been\ndismissals on other procedural grounds.\nMR. HORWICH: Well, there aren't -- there\nare not really other procedural grounds. There may be\nsituations where a petition is voluntarily withdrawn,\nand I think there is a problem there about there not\nactually being a judgment when somebody voluntarily\nwithdraws.\nBut even in those, the Special Masters\nshould have, in our view, examined whether there was a\nreasonable basis. I don't think it's right to say that\nan attorney can come in, file the petition and then the\nclaimant decides, well, I would like to withdraw, and\nthen the attorney essentially gets paid as of right.\nSo our -- it's unsurprising that there's no\nexamples of these hearings. It's also unsurprising that\nmy friend says, well, there -- for the petitions, when\nit comes time to determine fees, the record is complete.\nOf course the record is complete because the case has\nbeen decided on the merits. And that's the paradigm\nsituation under which the program has been operated.\nWhat we are talking about here is entering\nthis unchartered territory, where -- where the program\nhas not been before, and where you wouldn't think\nCongress would want to send it. And this is our central\nconcern with this case. The government's concern\nhere -- and the reason we've petitioned for certiorari\nis not because of the dollar amount involved in paying\nthese claims. The concern is about where the program's\nresources are being directed.\nThe question is -- the question is about\nwhere the finite number of Special Masters, the finite\nnumber of government attorneys, can put their time in\nresponding to these petitions for -- to deliver the\ncompensation to the very few, but very deserving people\nwho Congress wanted to award compensation to.\nAnd our concern here is -\nJUSTICE BREYER: So your view here it's the\nsame. No attorneys' fees when the client dies, or they\ndecide to withdraw the petition when it's dismissed\nearly on for a procedural ground, when the record is\ninadequate, et cetera.\nYou think that in none of those cases\nCongress would have wanted attorneys' fees.\nOr is it -\nMR. HORWICH: Well, in the case of -\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- do you think in some but\nnot others?\nMR. HORWICH: Well, no. In the case where\nthe claimant dies, the statute has provisions for that,\nand you can obtain compensation in that situation. So\nthere's no reason an attorney can't go on there -\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no, no, no.\nMR. HORWICH: -- if they want to -- if they\nwant to withdraw the petition, I guess it depends on\nexactly the circumstances under which -\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, but my question is what\nis your view? It's the same problem. He's listed, you\nheard, he listed six or seven different instances -\nfour or five anyway; he's found 11 cases, apparently.\nAnd so what is your view?\nMR. HORWICH: Well, my view -- my view is\nthe view that I think we would take under any other fee\nshifting provision, which is that if a claimant wants to\nwithdraw his or her case, I don't think that he can then\nclaim the benefit of the attorneys' fee provision,\nabsent some circumstances that -- that would warrant the\nfinding of reasonable basis. I think that is an\nunexceptional result.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
