GRAUER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. GRAUER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nFor three reasons, the important Federal policy\nfavoring arbitration would be seriously undermined if\ncourts become entangled in speculative litigation over\narbitration remedies. First, the enforceability of a\nlimitation on remedies in arbitration ought to be decided\nin the first instance by the arbitrator, since that's not\na gateway issue of arbitrability.\nSecond, it's unlikely in this case that the\narbitrator would have found that the limitations on\nremedies agreed by the parties would have precluded the\naward of RICO treble damages, and third, there is simply\nno reason why parties found by the district court to be\nsophisticated cannot mutually agree to limit remedies.\nTurning, then, to --\nQUESTION: Mr. Grauer, on the second point that\nyou made, you said it's unlikely that the arbitrators\nwould find that treble damages are inconsistent with\nthe -- with the contracts. Would you, supposing this case\nwere to be before the arbitrator, would you concede that\nthe contracts in question permit treble damages awards on\na RICO claim? Would you make that contention?\nMR. GRAUER: Yes.\nQUESTION: Thank you.\nMR. GRAUER: Yes.\nQUESTION: On your first point, suppose you have\na contract that is very clear that there can be no triple\ndamages under RICO, that's right in the contract, is it\nyour position that that goes to the arbitrator and it's\nfor the arbitrator to say that this violates public policy\nand I'm going to -- well, I mean, what would happen in\nthat case?\nMR. GRAUER: Yes, we believe that it's for the\narbitrator to decide. We believe that there's essentially\na 40-year tradition of allowing arbitrators to make\ndecisions of that nature and of allowing issues of the\nremedies that can arise in arbitration to be decided by\nthe arbitrator.\nQUESTION: The arbitrator, I take it, on the\nface of the contract simply could not award the damages,\nor are you saying that he might?\nMR. GRAUER: Yes. The arbitrator --\nQUESTION: He'd say, this is against public\npolicy and I'm giving you triple damages? I don't care\nwhat the contract says, I go beyond the scope of the\narbitration contract?\nMR. GRAUER: Well, the arbitrator is bound first\nand foremost, under both the law and under the arbitration\nclauses in this case, to comply with the controlling law.\nThis Court has held several times, in Mitsubishi, in\nVimar, in Gilmer, and in other cases that we should not\nsuppose that the arbitrator will not follow the law. We\nshould assume that the arbitrator will follow the law and,\ntherefore, if the law requires the award of treble\ndamages, even if the parties have agreed otherwise, the\narbitrator is bound to follow that law.\nQUESTION: What's our best case, or is there\none, for the proposition that if the contract says the\narbitrator may not do X, and X violates public policy,\nthat the arbitrator goes ahead and does it anyway? What's\nour case that says that?\nMR. GRAUER: I believe that that would be found\nin Mitsubishi, in the Vimar y Seguros case at page 541, in\nthe McMahon case at page --\nQUESTION: Well, but I'm not sure in any of\nthose cases it was clear that the contract in very\nexplicit terms said, you cannot do this. I -- I -- I\nrecognize that in those cases it does say if there's\nimportant public policy it can't be overturned by the\narbitration.\nMR. GRAUER: I think the -- one example -- there\nare several examples, but one that comes to mind is that\nin the Vimar case the COGSA prevented the arbitrator\nfrom -- the COGSA prevented any reduction in liability in\na bill of lading, and -- and there was a concern that the\nlaw in Japan which had been selected to conduct the\narbitration had a different set of rules that could have\nallowed the stevedores to be -- to have liability laid off\non the stevedores, and yet the Court said, we will not\nindulge in the presumption that the arbitrator will not\nfollow the appropriate law and, therefore, even though\nJapanese law was different, the arbitrator, we assumed,\nwould follow the controlling law.\nNow, in this particular case, it's -- it's not\nonly true that the -- that the Court has held several\ntimes that we should not assume that an arbitrator will\nfail to follow the controlling law, but all of the\narbitration agreements, and I would cite the Court to the\njoint appendix, pages 84, 147, 168, and 212, in each of\nthe arbitration agreements in this case, the arbitrator is\nadmonished to follow the controlling law.\nQUESTION: Well, but in one of the arbitration\nclauses, I think, it says the arbitrator shall not vary or\nignore the terms of this agreement, shall have no\nauthority to award extracontractual damages at any time,\nincluding punitive or exemplary damages.\nNow, what's the arbitrator to do with a\nprovision like that? Is that not the kind of thing that\ncourts have looked at and determined whether that's a\nvalid public policy or not?\nMR. GRAUER: I wouldn't agree with the Court\nlooking at that, and here's why. I agree that what you\nread, Justice O'Connor, is, in fact, what's in that\nagreement, but if you read on in that sentence it says,\nand the arbitrator shall follow the controlling law. At\nbest, there is a conflict or a tension between those\nterms, and this is what arbitrators do all the time.\nThere are all these agreements that are -- that\nevery day are presented to arbitrators that have a number\nof provisions that could step on each other, and -- and\nthe arbitrator has to interpret the contract. That's what\nwe bargained for in entering an arbitration agreement,\nthat if there was some tension, or some confusion or\ndispute, that the arbitr --\nQUESTION: Have we ever allowed a prospective\nwaiver of a statutory right --\nMR. GRAUER: Prospective --\nQUESTION: -- in these arbitration contexts?\nMR. GRAUER: The prospective waivers -- yes, I\nbelieve that that, for example, in our brief we cited a\nnumber of cases such as Mezzanatto that create a\npresumption that a statutory right is waivable unless\nCongress has said otherwise.\nNow, in the arbitration context, again, to get\nback to the Vimar y Seguros case, the party was agreeing\nto arbitration even though there was a concern before the\narbitration that the arbitrator might not follow the\ncorrect law.\nThe guiding principle of -- that -- that has\nguided this Court's jurisprudence for -- for years, and\nit's been reiterated in Mitsubishi, and McMahon, and --\nand Vimar, and Gilmer, is that we should assume that the\narbitrator will apply -- will apply the correct law, but\nif --\nQUESTION: Mr. Grauer, on the question of\nwaiver, you have represented, and I want to make this\nclear, that waiver would be academic in this situation,\nsince you say you will concede that all of these contracts\nallow the arbitrator to award treble damages. Is -- am I\ncorrect in understanding that waiver would be academic\nbecause you're not going to make the argument of waiver,\nyou're going to make -- you're going to concede that\ntreble damages are available if a RICO violation is found?\nMR. GRAUER: Absolutely. I agree with that,\nJustice Ginsburg, and as a matter of fact for two reasons,\nnot only because we've made that concession, but also\nbecause we agreed to arbitrate. That means we agreed to\nsubmit any issues to the arbitrator and therefore, even if\nwe had not made that concession, we would believe that the\narbitrator ought to be asked in the first instance to\ndecide the validity of a waiver.\nQUESTION: But suppose the arbitrator gets it\nwrong. Suppose the arbitrator thinks that the provision,\nno punitive damages, excludes treble damages, and that\nthat prevails. Could that be corrected by post award\nreview?\nMR. GRAUER: To the extent -- yes, I think it\ncould, and here's why. The one thing that this Court has\nsaid, no fewer than four times, and -- and has emphasized\nI think those four times, is that when a statutory claim\nis arbitrated, there -- the -- we assume that post\narbitration review is sufficient to ensure the vindication\nof statutory interests, and the Court mentioned that not\nonly in McMahon at page 232, in Gilmer at footnote 4, and\nalso in Vimar and in Mitsubishi. In all four of those\ncases, this Court has specific -- excuse me -- this Court\nhas specifically said that -- that, while limited, post\narbitration review is sufficient to ensure that statutory\ninterests are vindicated.\nQUESTION: In other words, it's quite simple. I\ndon't see what's so complicated about this. I thought\nwhat you were saying, and I thought that's what the law\nwas, but tell me if I'm not right, please, is,\ninterpreting the contract is a matter for the arbitrator,\nbut once we know what the contract means, then whether\nthat contract, as interpreted, provides sufficient remedy\nto be valid as an arbitration contract is for the judge.\nMR. GRAUER: I would -- I would agree with the\nfirst part of that, Justice Breyer, and that is --\nQUESTION: Well, why not the second? I mean,\nafter all, if I have a contract which says, Jones and\nSmith agree to arbitrate all damage claims, but no damages\nshall ever be awarded, no matter what, okay, that's pretty\nclear that the enforcement of that would invalidate that\narbitration agreement because it can't be enforced. The\nperson who should say that is the judge, because the judge\nsays, look, you people don't have an arbitration contract.\nNow, why you'd leave that to the arbitrator -- I\nguess you could, but I think that is a gateway matter that\nI think you'd have to be quadruple clear about that\nsomebody wanted that point decided by an arbitrator.\nNow, that's how I'm understanding it, so I'd\nlike you to correct me if I'm wrong.\nMR. GRAUER: I'm not sure I followed the first\npart of the hypothetical.\nQUESTION: The first part's very simple. What\nthe contract means is for the arbitrator. The parties\nhave agreed to that. But once we know what it means,\nwhether it is an enforceable arbitration contract or\nviolates some anti -- some statute that says -- or some\npublic policy and the -- which means, you two cannot\narbitrate this kind of thing with this kind of agreement,\nthat question of arbitrability is for the judge, because\nit is a gateway matter.\nIf, in fact, this contract for arbitration is\nunlawful, as against pubic policy or whatever, then there\nis no arbitration contract, and that matter is a matter\nfor the judge, unless the parties clearly indicate that\nthey want it to be decided by an arbitrator. And I read\nthrough those cases a little while ago, and that seemed to\nme what they said, and so I wrote it into an opinion which\nI think every member of this Court but one agreed to.\nMR. GRAUER: Justice Breyer, I agree with the\nfirst part, and that is this, that the gateway issue of\narbitrability involves the determination of, did the\nparties make a valid agreement to arbitrate and, if they\ndid, is the dispute within the scope of that agreement,\nbut that should end, in our view, the inquiry, because if\nyou don't end the inquiry at that point, you're -- you're\nopening the door to questions about remedies and legal\nissues and what are the elements of the cause of action\nand what have the parties agreed to, and let me give you\nan example.\nThe parties -- I sell you 10,000 widgets for a\ndollar each, as is, and no -- and liquidated damages of $1\nand no other liability, and we agree to that, okay. Now,\nthe person then sues for RICO because they want to get\naround that. Well, the only issue ought to be, did the\nparties make a valid agreement to arbitrate and, if so, is\nthe dispute in the scope of that agreement, and the fact\nthat there may be a downstream dispute about the validity\nof the remedies and the validity of the waiver of the\nremedies should not, under any circumstances, spill over\ninto the gateway --\nQUESTION: I didn't say when you would decide\nit. I said, the matter is a matter for the judge. If we\ndon't know what the contract means, then I guess we have\nto go to the arbitrator to find out before we know, before\nwe can present the judge. That's Vimar, or Vimar, isn't\nit?\nMR. GRAUER: Vimar y Seguros, and I agree,\nJustice Breyer, that post arbitration --\nQUESTION: I thought you probably would end up\nagreeing.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GRAUER: Well, post, as long as the\nagreement is that it's post arbitration. The post\narbitration review has been held four times by the Court\nto be sufficient to clean up matters at the margin that\ncould come up.\nQUESTION: But if the contract is completely\ncleared at the outset, why not pre-arbitration review?\nMR. GRAUER: If the con --\nQUESTION: Why march up the hill and then march\ndown again?\nMR. GRAUER:\ndisagree with approaching it that way, because\nunfortunately what's clear to a plaintiff's lawyer is\noften not clear to a defense lawyer, and there are many\nelements of a cause of action, there are many remedial\nlimitations --\nQUESTION: So you're saying that nothing is ever\nclear to the bar?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GRAUER: My good friend, Mr. Whatley and I\nagree on very little in the case, and that's the problem.\nQUESTION: Well, do you say that this provision\nin one of the arbitration clauses that the arbitrator\nshall have no authority to award extracontractual damages\nof any kind is not clear enough for a judge to determine\nwhether that's --\nMR. GRAUER: We feel that -- we --\nQUESTION: -- against public policy?\nMR. GRAUER: Yes, I do, and here's why.\nQUESTION: Why?\nMR. GRAUER: Because we believe that we\nbargained to have an arbitrator make that decision, and\nthere are many words in this case that may seem like it's\nclear what they mean, but may in some contexts not be so\nclear.\nThe word racketeering is used to describe a case\nwhere a doctor is seeking to be paid more for treating a\npatient. There are a lot of words in this case, and we\nfeel that we bargained to have an arbitrator interpret\nthem, and as I indicated to Justice Ginsburg, it was\nconceded some time ago that the term, extracontractual was\nnot in -- was intended to be noneconomic damages and was\nnot intended to be primarily remedial RICO treble damages,\nbut --\nQUESTION: Well, what you're arguing for\nbasically is that it should go to the arbitrator for a\ndecision of almost everything except what we have held to\nbe gateway issues, and that if it doesn't, it's just going\nto kind of get bounced back and forth like a ping pong\nball.\nMR. GRAUER: I agree, Mr. Chief Justice. I -- I\nbelieve that the importance of the Court's recent\npronouncement in Howsam about gateway arbitrability as we\nread that case is that you determine, did the parties\nintend to subject themselves to the power of an\narbitrator? Did they make an arbitration agreement, and\nis the dispute within the scope of that agreement, and if\nthe answers to those questions are yes, the only\nadditional issue that comes up, and the one that\nunfortunately became conflated in the Eleventh Circuit\nbelow, is where there is a statutory claim, there is an\nadditional analysis that this Court has traditionally\ndone, and that is, did Congress, by enacting that statute,\nintend to override or preempt the Federal Arbitration Act,\nand that's the issue that has come up, and unfortunately\nwhat's happened in the Eleventh and the Ninth Circuits is\nthat they have taken that concept of simply making a\ndetermination of whether another statute is -- preempts\nthe Federal Arbitration Act, and they've used it to create\nessentially a floating analysis of effective vindication\nthat's untethered to the statutory conflict analysis.\nQUESTION: Okay, how -- how clear has it got to\nbe before there is some kind of a tether? Let's assume\nyou had a simpler case than this one in which the\narbitration agreement provided -- this is silly, but for\nthe sake of a point, that no damages will be awarded by\nthe arbitrator for the violation of any statutory claim,\nas distinct from a tort claim, common law tort claim, or a\ncontract claim. Would you say that in that case there\nwas, in fact, a threshold question of arbitrability\nbecause that provision went so clearly to the validity of\nthe agreement that it should be treated as a, could be\nproperly treated as a threshold matter for a court?\nMR. GRAUER: It would depend, Justice Souter. I\nbelieve that there could be a situation where an\nagreement --\nQUESTION: Well, how about my situation?\nMR. GRAUER: In -- in -- in your situation, the\nreason I say your situation would depend is that there are\nmany contracts where that would be a perfectly legitimate\nunderstanding. For example, I -- I'll sell you 10,000\nwidgets, $1 each, I haven't checked them over, they may be\nno darned good, but you want them for $1 each, and I don't\nwant to be sued for this, so I want liquidated damages of\n$1. That type of commercial arrangement --\nQUESTION: Yeah, but in that case you're --\nwell, and again, maybe -- maybe this is where it gets\ntheoretical. In -- in that case, in effect, you're --\nyou're waiving any statutory claim at the beginning. In\n-- in the case I gave, maybe it's the same point, I just\nsaid you waive damages. I -- I suppose you wouldn't\nwaive -- on that theory you wouldn't be waiving equitable\nremedies if there were any, so -- so let's just take my\ncase. You waive the damages -- you don't waive the claim.\nYou waive the damages. You don't waive the right to\nequitable remedy.\nIs -- is that -- is the -- is the -- in effect\nthe -- the waiver of the right to damages in the\narbitration agreement sufficient to raise a serious enough\nquestion about the enforceability of the arbitration\nagreement to qualify that question as a gateway question?\nMR. GRAUER: I believe the answer is no, with\none exception. In general, anything relating to remedies\nshould be dealt with by the arbitrator, and we should\nassume that -- that if there is something improper about\nthat remedial limitation, that the arbitrator will -- will\ndo what he or she is supposed to do, follow the law, get\nit right.\nQUESTION: Okay, but you're saying, I think\nyou're saying, and -- and correct me if I 'm wrong,\nthat -- that no remedial question can ever rise to the\nlevel of a -- a potential threat to the potential -- to --\nto vindication of statutory rights. Whatever that phrase\nmay mean, as we have employed it, a mere question of -- of\nwaiver of remedies will never rise to that level and,\nhence, will never get to the threshold question status, is\nthat correct?\nMR. GRAUER: As a general premise, I believe\nthat's correct. I think we could envision situations\nwhere a variety of factors, including that, are linked\ntogether such that the plaintiff might make a motion to\nrevoke the arbitration agreement itself on the, on\ntraditional contract grounds should there be a whole\nseries of things that make a contract unconscionable or\nonerous, but that did not occur in this case.\nIn fact, the court found that it was not\nunconscionable or onerous. It was negotiated between\nsophisticated parties, and so the court declined to do\nsection 2 revocation of the contract for generally\napplicable contract grounds, but there could be a case\nwhere a remedial limitation, combined with other factors,\ncould rise to that level, not -- certainly not this case.\nThe problem --\nQUESTION: And I take it you would say that if\nat least the -- the details of the agreement that would\nraise the issue to that level are specifically pleaded in\n-- in -- in -- in the request, in -- in -- in the action\nthat takes it into court, that at least the -- the -- the\nbreadth of the frustration doctrine would not stand in the\nway of -- of a court's adjudicating it?\nMR. GRAUER: Well, that's correct. If I\nunderstood you correctly, I -- I -- I believe in\narbitration cases there's frequently a motion by a\nplaintiff to revoke the arbitration agreement on grounds\nof unconscionability --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. GRAUER: -- and judges deal with those from\ntime to time. This is certainly not such a case.\nQUESTION: But I think you're simply saying\nthey've got to be specific in telling us right at the\noutset what it is that makes it unconscionable. They\ncan't just come up and say, oh well, there's a potential\nfor frustration here.\nMR. GRAUER: Right, and -- and it's very\nimportant to note an additional distinction, and that is,\nthe -- the attack on unconscionability cannot be on the\ncontract as a whole, because if it is, under Prima Paint\nthat, too, should be decided by the arbitrator. The only\nunconscionability, the only type of attack that could be\nmade would be on the arbitration clause itself.\nQUESTION: Uh-huh.\nQUESTION: May I ask --\nQUESTION: Under what law is unconscionability\ndecided? Is -- is it State law?\nMR. GRAUER: In this case, because there's a\nFederal claim, and the case is in Federal court, the Court\nhas said a number of times that there is a Federal\nsubstantive law of arbitrability, but the contract itself\nwas entered between people governed by State law, and so\nthe revocability question would be a decision about\nwhether that contract either as a whole, or the\narbitration clause itself, are revocable under the\napplicable State law subject to the overlay, so to speak,\nthat's created by the Federal Arbitration Act in not\nallowing States to have unconscionability laws that\nwould --\nQUESTION: Vitiate --\nMR. GRAUER: -- vitiate an arbitration clause.\nQUESTION: May I ask, I just want to -- I may be\nmissing what's perfectly obvious, but if you have a\ncontract in which the only remedy authorized to be\nprovided is an illegal remedy for some reason that could\nnot be taken away from the plaintiff, does the\narbitrator -- is that agreement immediately nonarbitrable,\nor do you arbitrate the issues and then saying that\nthere's no remedy?\nMR. GRAUER: I don't believe either of those\nwould be the case. I believe that if -- if the -- you\nwould arbitrate the issue, and you would expect the\narbitrator to follow the law.\nQUESTION: Even if, on the face of the contract,\na judge could say, the only remedy offered to a successful\ncomplainant is one that may not be submitted to\narbitration?\nMR. GRAUER: There's only -- I -- I don't agree\nwith that.\nQUESTION: The waiver of a statutory right of\nsome kind.\nMR. GRAUER: There would be one way that the\nplaintiff's lawyer could raise that issue, which is not\none of the -- what occurred in this case, but I suppose\nyou could argue that the entire arbitration agreement is\nillusory and unconscionable, but --\nQUESTION: Then if that's true, what if you have\na case in which there are two remedies available, one of\nwhich is clearly impermissible as a matter of Federal law,\nthe other of which is permissible, but there's no\nseverability clause in the contract? What do you do\nthere?\nMR. GRAUER: I believe in that case, as in the\nprior one, you should send the matter to arbitration, you\nshould assume that the arbitrator will correctly apply the\nlaw, that if there is a provision in the contract that's\nunlawful, that the arbitrator will disregard it.\nQUESTION: I guess you'd have to -- the\narbitrator would have to decide whether implicit in the\nterms of the contract is a decision by the parties that\nwould permit him to waive the thing. I mean, Justice\nStevens' hypothetical will, I think -- I'd like the\nanswer, anyway. If we assume in the contract it says, and\nthe parties agree that this contract is exclusive in\nrespect to remedy, and the arbitrator does not have the\npower to strike out some remedies and put in others, okay,\nso now they've done that, now I take it the answer to his\nfirst hypothetical is, you go to the judge, and the\nagreement's no good. Isn't that right?\nMR. GRAUER: No. I don't agree, if I understood\nyou correctly, and the reason --\nQUESTION: The -- the contract has only one\nremedy. The remedy is clearly illegal. There is a\nsentence in the contract saying the arbitrator has no\npower to add a new remedy or to strike the old one. Now\nwe have it absolutely clear that this is an unlawful\narbitration agreement, and the judge would say that\nwithout sending it to arbitration, wouldn't he? That's\nthe same question I asked before --\nMR. GRAUER: Right.\nQUESTION: -- and I thought your answer was, of\ncourse.\nMR. GRAUER: Well --\nQUESTION: Maybe I'm wrong. That's why I'm\nasking.\nMR. GRAUER: If -- if there is a ground under\nsection 2 to revoke the arbitration clause for generally\napplicable grounds, not because it's an arbitration\nclause, then a party could make a motion of that nature\nand the court, of course, would have to address that\nmotion, and -- but -- but I didn't want to get away from\nthe fact that I think is important, is that when you're\ndealing with remedies, and when you're dealing with\narbitrators, we really need to assume that the arbitrator\nwill follow the law.\nAnd -- and in this particular case, for example,\nthe arbitration clause does contain a limitation on\nremedies, but that limitation on remedies could have been\nput elsewhere in the contract, and if it were somewhere\nelse in the contract, or it might have been -- the parties\nmight not have agreed to arbitrate. They might have\nagreed that we'll litigate in Florida, but the Court will\nnot have the power to award punitive damages. Now, you\nwould not say that the limitation on punitive damages\nprevents the parties from having to go to Florida, and you\nneed to treat an arbitration clause, we think, the same,\nor the parties might have had the remedial limitation in\nthis case, and no arbitration clause.\nNow, what would a court do? It would -- the\ncourt would evaluate the validity of the remedial\nlimitation and make a decision. Well, an arbitrator is\nexactly the same. It's simply selecting a different\nforum.\nI see my light's on. Unless there's an\nadditional question, I would reserve my time for rebuttal.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Grauer.\nMr. Whatley, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JOE R. WHATLEY, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. WHATLEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nWe start with the principle that arbitrability\nis to be determined by the court, as this Court has said\nmany times, including in AT&T and First Option, and that\nthere is no -- no presumption, or no liberal policy in\nfavor of giving that issue of arbitrability to the\narbitrator. It's exactly the opposite.\nYou go one step further, since this case\ninvolves an issue of public policy, and in both W. R.\nGrace, and later in Misco and in Eastern Associated Coal\nCorporation, this Court said that questions of public\npolicy are for the court, not for the arbitrator.\nQUESTION: We also said that that kind of\nquestion that would affect an arbitration is fairly rare,\ndidn't we?\nMR. WHATLEY: You did, Your Honor, and in fact I\nthink this case shows that it -- that it's rare, and I\nthink the various amicus briefs that have been submitted\nshows that an effort to put limits on remedies, which this\nCourt has attacked many times, is rare. I mean, other\ndefendants didn't do that here. The Well Point didn't --\nQUESTION: You say -- you say this Court has\nattacked what many times?\nMR. WHATLEY:\nof arbitration, Justice O'Connor's question, this Court\nhas never allowed the waiver of statutory remedies in the\ncontext of an arbitration, enforcing an arbitration\nprovision. If you go back to Mitsubishi and follow every\ncase right through Waffle House, this Court over and over\nand over again has quoted the portions of Mitsubishi, and\nfootnote 19 from Mitsubishi, saying that you're only\nchanging the forum when you're arbitrating.\nQUESTION: Mr. Whatley, Mr. Grauer has conceded\nthat there is no waiver here, that treble damages are\navailable, so why are we engaging in this academic\nexercise?\nMR. WHATLEY: Well, the concern I have with\nthat, Your Honor, is if -- if you read the question\npresented in his brief, that's not what it says.\nQUESTION: Well, he's made the concession right\nnow --\nMR. WHATLEY: He has made the --\nQUESTION: -- and he has five arguments for\nsaying, any good lawyer would, that these words that you\nread punitive damages, extracontractual damages, do not\nprevent the arbitrator from awarding treble damages, so he\nhas one interpreting the thing, two, if the interpretation\nfails he concedes it, three, there's nothing in the\ncontract says he can't concede it, and so why don't we\nsend this to the arbitrator to find out what the contract\nmeans before we decide that it must mean something that\nwould bar its enforcement?\nMR. WHATLEY: Well, the problem with that -- the\nproblem with that is, doing it after the fact has some\npretty severe policy implications.\nQUESTION: But didn't we, the Court hold\nprecisely, do it after the fact, in Vimar?\nMR. WHATLEY: Well --\nQUESTION: It's precisely the same circumstance.\nMR. WHATLEY: In that case, Your Honor, you were\ndealing with the international context, where you said,\nstarting in Mitsubishi is a -- is a special situation\nconcerning, where you've got to be concerned with\ninternational law. That's number one.\nNumber two, especially when you use the United\nlanguage that Justice O'Connor quoted, you couldn't get\nmuch more clear than United was in its provision, no\nextracontractual damages, including --\nQUESTION: This contract doesn't cover a tort\naction.\nMR. WHATLEY: It doesn't cover a tort action.\nQUESTION: In other words, what they wanted to\nhave is an arbitration between doctors and hospitals, and\nthe single most likely, or a very, very likely kind of\ndispute they call tort disputes, aren't even covered by\nthe arbitration agreement, and it's impossible for an\narbitrator to come to a different conclusion.\nMR. WHATLEY: That is -- that is -- that is our\nposition, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: I know that's your position. It's\njust, as I said it with my tone of voice, I'm suggesting\nit sounds implausible.\nMR. WHATLEY: Well --\nQUESTION: So what I'd like is an argument for\nthat position.\nMR. WHATLEY: Well, the argument for that\nposition is, you start with the language, and you don't\nonly start with the language that says, no\nextracontractual damages and, in fact, the issue you get\nin arbitration, and -- and -- and you go to arbitration,\nand I know we assume arbitrators are going to follow the\nlaw, absolutely, the Court has said that many times,\nalthough many arbitrators are not lawyers, but I've\nhandled many arbitrations, and --\nQUESTION: Well, many judges who are lawyers end\nup not following the law.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. WHATLEY: Your Honor, you can say that, but\nI don't think I can.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. WHATLEY: And -- and the arbitrators almost\ninvariably say, you know, this is -- this is what created\nme, the contract is my Bible, where I get my directions,\nand if the contract says very plainly, no extracontractual\ndamages, even if later on it says, and follow the law, and\nif it says -- says that you can't vary or ignore the terms\nof this agreement, which this agreement says, that is a\nstrong impediment against an arbitrator awarding\nappropriate relief where you've got a Federal statute that\ncreates tort-like damages.\nQUESTION: Every one of these contracts says the\narbitrator will follow the law, the arbitrator has no\npower to commit errors of law. Mr. Grauer, I think, said\nthat those provisions may be intention, but when they are,\nthe one that controls is the one that says the arbitrator\nmust follow the law.\nMR. WHATLEY: Well, that's good, and now that\nthe issue has been specifically raised, and after the\nfact, after it's raised they come in and waive it. The\nconcern we have is, what about the times when it's not\nspecifically raised? What about the times when you go\nforward through arbitration and perhaps --\nQUESTION: That's another case. We're deciding\nthis case.\nMR. WHATLEY: Well, it's not -- it's this\nlanguage, though, Your Honor. It's this language.\nQUESTION: But you don't litigate this language.\nYou're litigating a particular case before us.\nMR. WHATLEY: But -- but Your Honor, they didn't\ncome in and waive that position until it got before Judge\nMoreno, and Judge Moreno was going to hold it illegal,\ngoing to hold this arbitration agreement unenforceable\nbecause of the overreaching they engaged in by limiting\nthe remedies that could be awarded.\nIt was only then, having been caught, that they\nsay, okay --\nQUESTION: Mr. Whatley, they were never before\nan arbitrator, were they?\nMR. WHATLEY: Well, they were never before an\narbitrator, that's true, Your Honor. They were never\nbefore an arbitrator, but that's when it was finally\nwaived, after the issue was specifically presented, and\nthe judge was not going to enforce it, and that's when\nJudge Moreno said no, we're not going to allow this after\nthe fact waiver.\nQUESTION: After the fact -- when did he think\nit should have been waived in order to -- to assist the\npetitioner here?\nMR. WHATLEY:\nit should never -- if they're going to take --\nQUESTION: Well then, if he thought it should\nnever be, then what does after the fact mean?\nMR. WHATLEY: It means, after the issue was\npresented to the trial court.\nQUESTION: Well, but that happens all the time.\nAn issue is presented to the trial court, and you say,\nwell, on second thought I'm not going to do that.\nMR. WHATLEY: Well, but the problem with that\nis, Your Honor, it means that that provision is still\nthere. It's still addressed.\nQUESTION: Well, that's true if parties settle a\ncase.\nQUESTION: Yes, absolutely.\nMR. WHATLEY: Well, if parties settle a case,\nthat's a very different question, because this is a\nprospective provision that applies out into the future,\nand that's the difference. The way -- that's the whole\ndifference about our argument about waiver that's\npresented to you.\nOf course people waive things in settlements all\nthe time, but they don't waive things prospectively, and\nthis Court hasn't allowed the waiver of statutory rights\nprospectively. That's the big difference.\nQUESTION:\nwas there a violation of RICO, and I think one of the\nquestions from the bench suggested that the scope of\nremedy doesn't rise to the same level as, is there a\nviolation of the act, and if in this case the arbitrator\nshould find that if there is no violation of RICO on the\npart of care organizations, then there would never be any\nissue of remedy.\nMR. WHATLEY: Well, that --\nQUESTION: And, but you want to take that issue,\nwhich the parties did agree to arbitrate, and put that in\nthe courts, because you say there's something defective in\nthe remedy provision of the arbitration.\nMR. WHATLEY: That's true, but if -- if -- if a\ncourt or an arbitrator can't grant the remedies that\nCongress has authorized for a violation, including for a\ncriminal violation, if the court can't grant that relief,\nthen there is a serious public policy problem with putting\nthe parties into that forum to make that decision.\nQUESTION: And just what is that public policy\nproblem?\nMR. WHATLEY: The public policy problem is\nthat -- is that the arbitrator then cannot remedy it.\nQUESTION: Well --\nQUESTION: Well, do you take the position that\nthe arbitrator in a case like this could not even --\ncould -- let's assume -- let's assume the arbitrator took\nthe position that he couldn't award treble damages. Do\nyou take the position that under this contract the\narbitrator could not award simple compensatory damages?\nMR. WHATLEY: Under the plain language of the\nUnited contract, yes, Your Honor, because it says no\nextracontractual damages.\nQUESTION: And do you take the position that he\ncouldn't even determine liability?\nMR. WHATLEY: No, Your Honor, I don't take\nthat --\nQUESTION: Well, who --\nQUESTION: Then why isn't this premature? I\nmean, as Justice Ginsburg says, suppose he finds no\nviolation? That's the end of it.\nMR. WHATLEY: It -- it -- it's premature because\nit -- it is a -- it is -- it is a wasted process if you\ncan go through a proceeding --\nQUESTION: You mean it's not premature.\nMR. WHATLEY: To go through the arbitration\nprocess, when you know in advance that -- that the\narbitrator can't fully remedy the violation --\nQUESTION: But maybe the arbitrator will run --\nreach a conclusion that is consistent with the contract,\nsay simple contract damages, and then it is not a waste of\ntime.\nMR. WHATLEY: But Your Honor, that's exactly\nwhat Judge Moreno did.\nQUESTION: Why doesn't --\nMR. WHATLEY: Judge Moreno said that the\ncontract claim goes to the arbitrator.\nQUESTION: Well, so then you're splitting the\nthing up.\nMR. WHATLEY: But -- but Your Honor, you split\nthings up in Byrd.\nQUESTION: Well --\nMR. WHATLEY: You split things up in Volt. And\n-- and I mean, that is not -- there are many cases where\nsome cases go to arbitration and some cases --\nQUESTION: Well --\nMR. WHATLEY: And some claims stay in court.\nQUESTION: But what you're saying is, one issue\ngoes to arbitration, the other one doesn't.\nMR. WHATLEY: And then the parties decide, do\nthey want to pursue that issue in arbitration.\nQUESTION: That just really complicates the\nprocedure.\nMR. WHATLEY: Actually, it did not. In this\ninstance, it really simplified the situation, because here\nwhat you're dealing with, and what the focus of the claims\nare on, is -- is the automatic adjudication of claims the\nway they -- the way they adjudicate claims of doctors\nthrough computerized processes that by computerization\nautomatically down-code a bundle.\nYou're dealing with claims that are $5, $10,\n$15, that frankly can't be resolved through an arbitration\nprocess or any process on a claim by claim basis, but the\njudge said, you've got to go forward in arbitration on the\nbreach of contract claims and, since those weren't\npractical to pursue in any forum, we made the decision,\nand the -- and the doctors, the individual doctors made\nthe decision not to pursue them. Those are over. It was\nresolved very efficiently in the district court on whether\nthe claims should be arbitrated or not arbitrated, and\nthat dispute ended, and -- and so it was done very, very\nefficiently in this instance.\nQUESTION: When you wrote that word, or whoever\nwrote it, the word extracontractual, no extracontractual\ndamages, now, I guess it could mean one of two things. It\ncould mean what you think it means, which is, you can't\nbring any tort cases, all you can bring are contract\ncases, you can't bring any statutory cases in arbitration,\nor it might mean, if you happen to have a contract case,\nif that's the nature of the case, you cannot give damages\nfor mental suffering or other kinds of punitive damages in\na contract case.\nNow, if you were drafting this, and you wanted\nit to mean the first, rather than meaning the second, why\ndidn't you just write the words, there won't be a tort\ncase?\nMR. WHATLEY: Well --\nQUESTION: Why didn't you just write the words,\nthere won't be a statutory case?\nMR. WHATLEY: Well --\nQUESTION: Why did you run all around Robin\nHood's barn in order to -- whatever they -- my -- Rob --\nwhatever you say. I mean, why did you get such a\ncomplicated way just to tell people, we don't want tort\ncases in -- or this arbitration?\nMR. WHATLEY: Your Honor, first of all, I didn't\nwrite this.\nQUESTION: Of course you didn't.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: I'm sorry, I didn't mean to suggest\nit's your fault.\nMR. WHATLEY: This is -- this is -- this is in\nthe form contract that United presented to -- to doctors\nand medical groups and had them sign under a section that\nsays, resolution of disputes, that only refers to\narbitration when you get down into the print. It's not\neven -- it's not even entitled arbitration, but -- but --\nbut I mean, could I have written it differently to say --\nof course I could.\nBut I mean -- I mean, they wrote it, and -- and\n-- and it's really our position that they wrote it to\ndiscourage doctors from being able to -- to -- to recover\nclaims in arbitration, and to limit what doctors could\nrecover, not only to send them to arbitration, but then\nalso to place limits on what they could get once they got\nthere, because they didn't limit, they didn't have a\nprovision, like they seem to say in their briefs, we\nwaive, each party waives punitive damages against the\nother, and then you would have to consider under State\nlaw, can you do that, depending on where you are.\nInstead, they say --\nQUESTION: That is not an objection, in its --\nin itself, that goes to the question presented here, the\nfact that you think it's a one-sided contract. I mean,\nthere are lots of one-sided contracts that are enforced.\nMR. WHATLEY: Well, that's true, but I think it\nhas to be taken into the mix. That -- that's absolutely\nright, there -- there are one-sided contracts that are\nenforced, and -- and lots of one-sided arbitration\ncontracts that are enforced, but --\nQUESTION:\nend of the day if you let the arbitrator decide whether\nthere was a RICO violation, and if there is such a\nviolation, then you reach the remedy issue, and if the\narbitrator were somehow to take the position that treble\ndamages were not available, I assume that could then be\nresolved in court, could it not? I mean, what do you lose\nat the end of the day?\nMR. WHATLEY: Well, here's -- here's the problem\nwith that, especially if you read the -- the Eleventh\nCircuit RICO decisions. The issue of remedy --\nQUESTION: Uh-huh.\nMR. WHATLEY: -- and -- and in cases like Sykes,\nand I apologize, this is going beyond what's in the\nbriefs, but I'm trying to answer your question.\nQUESTION: Uh-huh.\nMR. WHATLEY: And -- and in cases like Sykes,\nthe issue of damages, either to the individual plaintiffs,\nor the damages to the class --\nQUESTION: Uh-huh.\nMR. WHATLEY: -- are so wound up in the question\nof RICO violation that what you're left with, then, is\ntrying the case twice if you do it the way you suggest.\nNow --\nQUESTION: I don't understand that. If the\ndamages initially are compensatory, I mean, the difference\nbetween punitive damages and these treble damages is, you\nget a number that's compensatory, and then you multiply it\nby three. It's not, you send it to the jury and the sky's\nthe limit, so I don't understand your answer about it\nbeing bound up with anything -- it's -- it's an ordinary\nmeasure of compensatory damages that the judge, the\narbitrator or the judge, whichever forum you're in,\ntriples.\nMR. WHATLEY: I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg, I\nthought I was answering the question of -- of what's the\nproblem with trying violation first, assuming the\narbitrator couldn't award damages, and then trying damages\nlater.\nQUESTION: But I thought that you were answering\nthat question, but you're saying the reason you can't try,\nwas there a RICO violation first, is that the remedy is\ninextricably bound up with --\nMR. WHATLEY: That's right.\nQUESTION: -- the answer to that question.\nMR. WHATLEY: That's right, so if the arbitrator\ncouldn't award damages in the first place, you would be\ntrying damages in the first instance. You would only get\na determination of violation, and then you would go back\nsomewhere else, presumably, and try the question of\nremedy, and you would retry the question of damages.\nQUESTION: I don't follow that.\nQUESTION: No, but if the arbitrator can award\nsimple damages --\nMR. WHATLEY: If the arbitrator --\nQUESTION: -- one times one damages, then that\nobjection doesn't apply.\nMR. WHATLEY: Then that takes away that\nobjection, but I didn't understand that to be the question\nI was asked.\nQUESTION: And that may -- and that may be what\nthe arbitrator decides.\nMR. WHATLEY: Well, it -- it -- it could be what\nthe arbitrator decides. Under our reading of what United\nwrote out there, and under our reading of no punitive\ndamages, after this Court has developed the concept of\npunitive damages in Gore, so -- I mean, there's almost a\npresumed trebling issue there, that if you get much below\nthat, beyond that, there become constitutional questions.\nWith -- with the development of that, then --\nthen we don't see there -- we see severe problems,\nespecially as that law developed, and especially as the\ntax, your -- your -- based on your tax decisions, saying\ntreble damages are punitive damages.\nQUESTION: And we've also said that --\nQUESTION:\nyou're -- you're doing is, you're saying that it's\nnecessary for us to declare the -- the scope of the\narbitration in court before the arbitration proceeds.\nThat's what the argument amounts to --\nMR. WHATLEY: No --\nQUESTION: -- and I think that's inconsistent\nwith the whole idea of the efficiencies to be obtained by\nthe arbitral process.\nMR. WHATLEY: What -- what I'm saying is much\nmore limited than that, Your Honor. What I'm saying is\nthat in instances where someone like United or Pacificare\ndecides not only to insist on an arbitration agreement but\nalso to place limits on what the remedies are that the\narbitrator can award, and that's what they did here, in\nthose instances, the Court should look at what those\nlimitations are on remedies and make a public policy\ndetermination if there's a Federal statutory claim out\nthere.\nQUESTION: Well, then you're opening up --\nyou're really expanding the gateway concept. In other\nwords, you're no longer talking about, did the parties\nagree to submit this to arbitration. You're talking about\nremedial terms.\nMR. WHATLEY: Well, Your Honor, remedy is\ndifferent than procedure, and -- and -- and -- and as I\nread Howsam -- and obviously, I mean, you know, it's a\nfresh opinion. You all are all much closer to it than I\nam, but as I read Howsam, it draws the procedural,\nsubstantive distinction. Remedies are not procedural\nissues, and remedies can have a direct impact on public\npolicy questions, and so for that limited area --\nQUESTION: Well, but of course, you can say\nprocedural issues will have an impact on public policy\nissues, too.\nMR. WHATLEY: Well, you certainly can, and if\nthey go far enough, and I think that's what you were\nsaying in Green Tree, had the record gone far enough in\nGreen Tree, what the Court -- the court said, there could\nbe instances where the limitations that are placed on,\nprocedurally on getting to arbitration go far enough that\nthey void the arbitration clause --\nQUESTION: We --\nMR. WHATLEY: -- but the record there didn't go\nfar enough.\nQUESTION: Well, and we didn't -- we did not\nexpress a view as to what the situation would be if the\nrecord had been different. We simply said, conceivably it\nmight.\nMR. WHATLEY: That -- that -- that's true, Your\nHonor, which I assume, and courts below I think are now,\nthere are situations where records are being developed\nfurther to determine, so that the trial courts can make\nthat determination, has the remedy, has the arbitration\nprocess been so impeded by those procedural issues that\nyou can't enforce it.\nQUESTION: Could two parties agree in advance\nthat if a RICO violation comes up they will only have\ndouble damages, nothing about arbitration, just in court?\nMR. WHATLEY: No, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: They cannot?\nMR. WHATLEY: No.\nQUESTION: Can -- can you do it in an antitrust\ncase?\nMR. WHATLEY: No.\nQUESTION: Can you ever do it?\nMR. WHATLEY: In -- in our judgment, Your Honor,\nyou -- you cannot do it.\nQUESTION: Can two parties agree in a tort suit\nthat -- before there's a tort committed, that if there is\na tort, no damages greater than a million dollars in\npunitives will be collected?\nMR. WHATLEY: It depends on the State law.\nQUESTION: So why doesn't it --\nMR. WHATLEY: That's a State law question.\nQUESTION:\ncannot -- it's void against public policy to limit in any\nway any possible damages in a future lawsuit?\nMR. WHATLEY: Your Honor, in Mc --\nQUESTION: Is there -- has that been decided?\nI --\nMR. WHATLEY: In McMahon you said that -- that\nparties cannot waive securities, future securities\nviolations even if there was a deal so that you got a\nlower -- a lower payment for the transaction.\nIn Barrentine you said, either parties or unions\ncan't respectively waive Fair Labor Standards Act\nviolations in the future.\nQUESTION: The question didn't go to waiving the\nviolations.\nMR. WHATLEY: I --\nQUESTION: It went only to the remedy.\nMR. WHATLEY: It went to remedy, and what you've\ngot, Your Honor, I think is, Congress has established what\nthat remedy is, and I think it would be void as against\npublic policy. I mean --\nQUESTION: But you then want us to adopt a\nspecific gateway rule when any arbitration agreement\nlimits a statutory remedy, and that statutory violation\nwould be arbitrable, and as I understand it, your rule is,\nany limitation in an arbitration agreement of statutory\nremedy raises a question of public policy, a question of\npublic policy is a gateway arbitrability question, and it\nalways goes to the court first. Is --\nMR. WHATLEY: Yes, sir.\nQUESTION: Is that a fair statement --\nMR. WHATLEY: Yes, sir. For that --\nQUESTION: -- your position?\nMR. WHATLEY: For that limited issue of, did the\n-- did the limitation, is there a limitation on the remedy\nauthorized by Congress.\nQUESTION: And that's, I guess you want to say\nfor -- leaving arbitration out of it, that sounds very\nfar-reaching, because I would have thought the matter\nmight have varied, depending upon the statute. I mean, I\nwould have thought Congress could sometimes pass a statute\nwith remedies, that it would not be against public policy\nfor two private persons to limit --\nMR. WHATLEY: Your Honor, Congress --\nQUESTION: Was it always -- in your view,\nalways, no matter what the statute, two people cannot say\nin advance, we will, if there should -- should a violation\narise, we will agree that, in advance, that the limitation\nwill not exceed $10 million -- or the damages won't\nexceed -- put in some reasonable amount?\nMR. WHATLEY:\nsay, in the act, parties can waive this respectively.\nQUESTION: It's only waiving, putting a\nlimitation on damages.\nMR. WHATLEY: Congress -- Congress has not done\nthat, and yes, Your Honor, that is our position. If\nCongress establishes a remedy for a violation, and I think\nthis is discussed in much more detail in the Public\nCitizen amicus brief that's submitted than it was in our\nbriefs, because we were trying to address the specific --\nQUESTION: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nMR. WHATLEY: -- arbitration issues and\nlimitations within arbitration, which is the issue before\nthis Court.\nQUESTION: Well, but that's -- I think Vimar\ncuts the other way, so the COGSA -- COGSA was certainly a\nstatute enacted by Congress.\nMR. WHATLEY: And -- and the Court said, it's\nnot clear here whether that's going to be followed or not\nfollowed.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. WHATLEY: I think you said, it is not clear\nto us whether that will be followed or not followed in\nthis instance, and that's --\nQUESTION: If --\nMR. WHATLEY:\nproceed.\nQUESTION: If your view was correct, that whole\nissue should have gone to a judge beforehand.\nMR. WHATLEY: Well, except that there's no -- I\ndon't read that. There are two issues --\nQUESTION: You don't what?\nMR. WHATLEY: I don't read that as saying\nspecifically that that act would not be followed, number\none, their contract.\nNumber two, there is the separate consideration\nthere, as in Mitsubishi, of the concerns about\ninternational, of international relations, where you have\nsaid you've got to be especially hands off, and that issue\nis not involved here.\nQUESTION: Well, but what's involved, which is\nidentical, is the kind of prudential consideration for\ncourts, don't decide a difficult issue unless you have to.\nNow, in Vimar it just said, look, we may never have to\ndecide this. Send it to the arbitrator and see.\nNow what you've suggested is to my mind a pretty\ntough issue.\nMR. WHATLEY: Well --\nQUESTION: And we may never have to decide it,\nor at least not soon.\nMR. WHATLEY:\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. WHATLEY: You might not, but it's not just,\nit's a tough issue, send it to the arbitrator and let the\narbitrator decide.\nQUESTION: The arbitrator will interpret the\ncontract to see if it really arises.\nMR. WHATLEY: But Number 2, it's also in an\ninternational setting, where we've got to be, be, you\nknow, be concerned about that and grant all possible\ndeference to that situation.\nIf there are not other questions --\nQUESTION: I have one question, and it's about\nsomething that the petitioner represented in the\npetitioners' brief at note 12, page 23.\nThe petitioner represented to us that you\nrepresented to this Court that if any issue is sent to\narbitration you simply will give up the claim, that you\nwill not arbitrate any issue in this case. Do you still\ntake that position, that -- is this representation\ncorrect, that you have disclaimed any intention to\narbitrate any claim sent to arbitration?\nMR. WHATLEY: Your Honor, that gets back to the\nproblem that I was addressing before. The claims here on\na claim by claim basis are so small that you cannot take\nthem to arbitration.\nQUESTION: Well, let's take the RICO claim. If\nyou lose on where that goes first, if it goes to\narbitration first, are you -- are you saying that you will\nnot -- that you will abandon the case anyway?\nMR. WHATLEY: Well, it's not abandoning the\ncase, Your Honor, because there is a separate conspiracy\nand aiding and abetting claim that is going forward that\nis not up before this Court.\nQUESTION: But I mean the --\nMR. WHATLEY: And the claim here, if we have to\n-- have to resolve those, even the RICO claims, even if\nyou treble $5 to get $15, if we have to try those on a\nclaim by claim basis, in terms of what the doctors'\ndamages are, it can't be done, and we will not proceed.\nQUESTION: But why would the trial be different\nin court versus arbitration on that?\nMR. WHATLEY: Well, because -- and -- and -- and\nI know you're going to address this issue in Basil to some\nextent, but the issue in court, the issues have been\ncertified in the court, so they're proceeding as a class\naction, which is the only way that -- that claims of this\nmagnitude can be handled, and so that's our problem. If\nwe could proceed in arbitration on a class-wide basis,\nsure we would do it, and -- and doing that in the Federal\nsystem has limits thus far, but -- but proceeding on a\nclaim by claim basis, where the damages are $5, $10, $15,\n$50 for the bundling down claim --\nQUESTION: Have you gotten a certification of\nanything in the district court? Did you --\nMR. WHATLEY: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: You did?\nMR. WHATLEY: Yes. Yes. The trial court has\ncertified the claims that -- that -- that are -- that are\n-- that -- that -- that -- that were not referred to\narbitration. The -- that currently is on appeal, on a\n23(f) appeal to the Eleventh Circuit. We've moving\nforward with discovery on those claims that are certified.\nQUESTION: How broad is it? Is it Nationwide?\nMR. WHATLEY: Yes, Your Honor, it's Nationwide.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Whatley.\nMR. WHATLEY: Thank you, Your Honors.\nQUESTION: Mr. Grauer, you have 3 minutes left.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM E. GRAUER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. GRAUER: Mr. Whatley's argument about $5\nhere and $10 there is flatly inconsistent with what the\ndistrict judge found, and you can note at page A25 of our\ncert petition that the court found that these cases were\nnegotiated by sophisticated groups of doctors, that the\nclaims were not small, that in fact the doctors were\nenlarging an ongoing pattern -- that's about midway\nthrough page A25 of our cert petition, that that is an\nongoing pattern of instances.\nMr. Whatley's comment about the -- the\nconspiracy claim has been certified and is going forward\nis exactly an example of the problem. Conspiracy is\nsimply a remedy that's -- that -- a way of creating\nliability for an underlying cause of action, and the\narbitration clauses in this case require the doctors to\narbitrate all of their disputes with the managed care\ncompanies, and they're trying to circumvent that on a mass\nbasis both in this appeal and by trying to say that the\nconspiracy claims are not part of the arbitration clause,\nand we don't think that's appropriate, and we think when\nwe talk about remedies in our cert petition, that would\ninclude methods of holding someone liable for a claim, and\nthe Court ought to take a look at that in the record of\nthe case.\nBut I would agree fundamentally with a point\nthat I -- I thought I heard Justice Souter making a moment\nago, and that is that if Mr. Whatley's premise that any\nremedial limitation becomes a gateway issue of\narbitrability, we are throwing -- we are overruling Howsam\nafter only a few weeks, because the whole point of Howsam\nwas, you look to whether the parties made an agreement to\narbitrate, and you look to whether the dispute is in the\nscope of the agreement.\nAnd here, at page A40 of our petition, the Court\nfinds this is an exceptionally broad arbitration\nagreement. It includes any and all controversies, and the\nCourt found that. That has never been appealed. Every --\nall of the claims are within the scope of it, and it is\ncomplete speculation to suggest that that, that any of\nthese claims are not within the scope of the arbitration\nagreement.\nThe -- the -- with re -- a final point with\nreference to the intent of the parties. The parties would\nintend an arbitrator to decide remedial limitations, and\nthe reason why the parties would intend the arbitrator to\ndecide that is because the parties have agreed to\narbitrate. They have a dispute in the scope. They would\nnever intend to go to court at all. They would intend to\ngo to arbitration and comply with their agreement, and the\nquestion of remedies would be the last thing that would\ncome up in the event, on a speculative basis, that they\nprevail, and they ought not to be able to get away from\nthat basic principle by labels, the label of punitive\ndamages, the label of RICO, the label of conspiracy.\nThose labels are being used to take away the rights of\nmanaged care companies on a wholesale, nationwide basis to\nhave these types of disputes resolved by arbitrators, as\nthe parties have agreed, and instead they're trying to\nturn it into a nationwide class action.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Grauer.\n"
