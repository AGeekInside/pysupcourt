LEE: Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nAt its core, the First Amendment is about\nfree and open debate on matters of public importance.\nIt's about citizens' rights to participate in public\ndebate and contribute their personal opinions and views\nwhether they are mainstream or not. The first\namendment is not, however, about policing the\nworkplace. It is not about constitutionalizing the law\nof public employment. Nor should it be. Yet, if the\nNinth Circuit's approach is accepted or adopted, this\nis what it will do.\nIn this section 1983 action, a deputy\ndistrict attorney prepared a disposition memorandum,\nFirst Amendmentpursuant to his prosecutorial duties,\nsetting forth the reasons why, in his prosecutorial\njudgment, the criminal case that he was supervising was\nlikely to be dismissed. The fact that the supervisor\ndid not agree with the content of that memorandum should\nnot give the plaintiff a constitutional right to\nchallenge adverse employment decisions that he claims\nwere in response to the product of that memorandum.\nThere are no First Amendment interests that\nare served when public employees are allowed to perform\nassigned job duties in such a way as to the\ndisagreement of the public employer. Essentially, what\nthe --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I --\nMS. LEE: -- Ninth Circuit --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- I suppose the public\nmight have an interest in knowing about this debate. I\ndon't know if you can say there are no public interest\nserved. It might be that there are other\ncounterbalancing first -- interests, but I don't think\nyou could say we have no interest in speech. This was\n-- this is a -- on its face, a rather interesting -- a\nrather interesting argument that they're -- that\nthey're having.\nMS. LEE: When --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: They're interested in\ncriminal law, criminal procedure, et cetera, et cetera.\nMS. LEE: Well, it's our position that when\nspeech by public employees cannot fairly be said to be\nspeech as a citizen, then the Government should have a\npresumptive right to manage its personnel affairs and\ninternal --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that -- yes, that's\nsomething different. But your statement, that there's\njust no First Amendment interest --\nMS. LEE: Well, there's no core First\nAmendment values that are furthered when public\nemployers have to justify employment decisions that\nthey make on a routine basis.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, why wasn't that\nequally true in Connick?\nMS. LEE: Well, the difference in Connick is\nthat the employee -- the prosecutor in that actions\nspoke more closely with a citizen, and the Government -\n-\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but I mean that's --\nMS. LEE: -- had --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- that's a fine\ncharacterization, but I'm not sure that that helps us.\nIn Connick, the one subject of the speech that was\nheld to be protected was the speech questioning\npolitical pressure to help in campaigns and so on. The\nissue here that would arguably favor protection is the\nissue of calling public attention to lying by police\nofficers in criminal cases. And it seems to me that\nthe -- that if there's a public interest in political\npressure, there's a public interest in mendacity in law\nenforcement.\nMS. LEE: Well, if the employee is required\nto investigate or report that kind of conduct pursuant\nto their normal duties of employment, then that is\nspeech that the employer should absolutely or\npresumptively have an ability to monitor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, yes, but why?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's the difference,\nnot the lack of public interest --\nMS. LEE: That's --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that you're --\nMS. LEE: -- absolutely right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- pointing to, is that in\none case he is making this statement as an employee;\nand you say the employer, if it's a stupid statement,\nought to be able to fire him for it. In --\nMS. LEE: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- the other case, he's\nmaking the statement as a member of the public. And\nwhat the First Amendment is all about is that we allow\nstupid statements to be made. Right?\nMS. LEE: If it's not part of -- if it's --\nif it's not part of your core job duties that you --\nthat employers should evaluate.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but it may well -- I\nguess the point that I'm trying to get at -- and it\ngoes back to your original public-interest issue -- is,\nlet's assume -- as Justice Scalia's hypo had it, let's\nassume that the statement made by the employee on the\nsubject within job duties -- case like this one -- is,\nin fact, a \"stupid statement.\" Let's assume it's\nwrong, it's inaccurate, whatnot. The issue is not\nwhether an employer, it seems to me, should, if that\nturns out to be the case, be able to fire. The issue,\nit seems to me, is whether, if it is not stupid, it\nshould be totally unprotected, so that the employer\ncould do anything, even if it's an accurate statement.\nAnd my understanding is that your argument on public\ninterest was an argument that says, even if it's\naccurate and they were lying and so on, that there\nshould be no protection. Am I -- and do I understand\nyou correctly?\nMS. LEE: Well, our position is, whether or\nnot the prosecutor in this case made an accurate\nstatement during the performance of his job -- so, in\nother words, if his disposition memorandum -- if the\nemployer accepted it and agreed with it, and the case\ndidn't go any further, there wouldn't be a basis of\nFirst Amendment, because normally he is acting pursuant\nto his job duties and it's up to the employer to\nevaluate whether or not he's adequately performing\nthose job --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Sure, but take --\nMS. LEE: -- duties.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- take the case in which\nthe employee says, \"It was accurate.\" The employer\nsays, \"No, it was stupid. You got everything wrong.\"\nI take it, in -- your position is that regardless of\nwhether the employee got it right or not, there\nshouldn't be protection, because it's within job\nduties. Is --\nMS. LEE: Right. It --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- that correct?\nMS. LEE: -- should not be protected under\nthe First Amendment.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMS. LEE: That's not to say that the public\nemployer is free from being challenged with regards to\nthe employment decision. It may be a matter for the\nemployee to seek, through the grievance procedure, that\n-- like Mr. Ceballos did initially, or even pursue it\nto civil service remedies. And those are the type of\ndecisions that the personnel in those departments are\nmore ably, I think, to decide.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Or he could go public, I\nassume. He could say, \"I got fired for saying this.\nAnd this was true.\" Right? Take it to the press. The\npress would love it.\nMS. LEE: If his job --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right?\nMS. LEE: -- is not -- if that speech was not\nrequired to be kept --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm assuming it was --\nMS. LEE: -- internally.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- not required to be kept\nconfidential.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But if he -- if it's part of\nhis job to speak publicly, then he has no -- things\nthat are said publicly in the performance of official\nresponsibilities have no First Amendment protection?\nMS. LEE: In our view, no. If it's a job --\nif the public employee's assigned job duties is to, on\nbehalf of the Government or the employer, speak to the\npublic about certain things that are going on in the\noffice, and he happens to get disciplined for it, that\nwouldn't pass our step.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So, what if the employer\ntells the employee to go out and lie? There's no First\nAmendment protection if the employee, instead, tells\nthe truth?\nMS. LEE: Well, I don't know if that's a --\nif that's a detailed enough hypothetical. I mean, if\nthe employee's core job duties are to report X, Y, and\nZ, and that employee goes out to the public and reports\nX, Y, Z, E, and F --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, no, that's not --\nMS. LEE: -- I think that's --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- that's not -- that's not\nthe hypothetical. So, suppose that a supervising\ndistrict attorney tells the deputy district attorney,\n\"Go in and make a misrepresentation to the court, or\nconceal evidence,\" or whatever --\nMS. LEE: Well, the question would be if he's\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- and he refuses to do\nthat, or he goes in and he says the opposite, he tells\nthe truth, and he's fired. What result?\nMS. LEE: Well, I think the plaintiff could\nargue that, \"That's not my core job duties. My job\nduties is to\" -- if it's a prosecutor, \"is to make\nstatements\" --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Oh, so --\nMS. LEE: -- \"pursuant to\" --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- so you're saying that\nthere's an exception to your rule, so that if, in this\ncase, he has a -- he has a defense if he said, \"Well,\nit's my duty to call it as I see it\"?\nMS. LEE: Absolutely --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Then --\nMS. LEE: -- not.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then, if that's so,\nyou ought to remand this case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, sure you'd agree with\nthat, if it's his duty to call it or -- just as it's\nthe duty of a -- of a lawyer not to lie to the court.\nIf there was a similarly clear legal duty for him to\nsay something, you'd say that was part of his job\ndescription, right?\nMS. LEE: That would be the required\nassignments of his job.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and I suppose, in\nthis case, in the hypothetical we propose, that the\nCalifornia courts and the California bar would have\ndisciplinary mechanisms against the senior attorney who\nhypothetically told the junior attorney to mislead.\nMS. LEE: Well, that would be an issue of\nfact.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Does California have, or\nhave not, disciplinary procedures in the hypothetical\ncase where a senior attorney who tells a junior\nattorney lie to the court --\nMS. LEE: They do.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: All right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What is the --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, what is it?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What is the California\nremedy? Let's say his boss says, \"Don't turn over\nBrady materials.\"\nMS. LEE: And the employer goes ahead and\nturns it over?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.\nMS. LEE: If the boss makes a determination\nthat, \"This is not Brady materials. I don't want that\ndisclosed,\" and the employee goes ahead and discloses\nit, our position is, that would not be protected First\nAmendment speech.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about -- you were\ntalking about public speaking. There was, as I\nremember, a talk that was given to the Mexican-American\nBar Association, and that was not something that his\nemployer required him to do, but he --\nMS. LEE: No, it wasn't. And it's not part\nof this lawsuit, because there's no dispute that the\ncommunication at issue in this case is that disposition\nmemorandum that he prepared purely pursuant to his\nprosecutorial duties.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But would have a 1983 case\nif he were disciplined or disadvantaged in the\nworkplace because of the talk that he gave to the\nMexican-American Bar Association in which he criticized\nDA office policies?\nMS. LEE: Then our position is, it gets past\nstep one, because it's not normally something that a\nprosecutor is required to do, and it would be subject\nto a balancing --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Pickering balancing, I take\nit.\nMS. LEE: Correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But I thought -- correct me\nif I'm wrong, just as a matter of fact -- I thought his\n1983 claim listed the speech to the Mexican-American\nBar Association as one of the reasons that he was\ndemoted, or whatever it was, transferred.\nMS. LEE: It was initially alleged, but,\nthrough the course of discovery, the focus of it was a\ndisposition memorandum, because by the time he went to\nthe Mexican-American Bar Association, he had already\nbeen disciplined, so there is no causation between his\npublic speech to the Mexican Bar Association and the\ndisciplinary actions that were --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, the --\nMS. LEE: -- are at issue.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- the focus may have\nchanged, but, I mean, he hadn't dropped the -- he\nhadn't dropped the claim that that was one of the\ncauses --\nMS. LEE: Well, in --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- of the --\nMS. LEE: -- in essence, he did, when we --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Did he?\nMS. LEE: -- when we went to the summary\njudgment motion. And that's why the district court was\nvery clear that the issue --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMS. LEE: -- in this case was a\ncommunication in the disposition memorandum. And that\nwas -- it was undisputed that that was purely pursuant\nto his prosecutorial duties --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The court --\nMS. LEE: -- and --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- the court of\nAppeals did --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- the court of\nAppeals specifically did not address the Mexican-\nAmerican Bar Association speech. It focused only on\nthe memorandum, correct?\nMS. LEE: Correct.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And you concede that's\nPickering balancing, anyway.\nMS. LEE: Well, in -- to the extent that he's\nalleging that if that's -- \"I went to the Mexican-\nAmerican Bar Association, and I alleged -- or I made\nstatements that there were some improprieties in the\ndistrict attorney's office,\" that would probably get\npast step one and the matter of public concern, and\nthen the question would be whether or not his interest\nin speaking as a citizen outweighed the interests of\nthe Government.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But let me -- let me raise\nthis question. If, in this case, he gets past step one\nbecause of the Mexican Bar Association speech, and if,\nas you suggested in answer to a question a little while\nago, that anybody could go public and get at least past\nstep one of Pickering, what is to be gained by the\nextremely -- well, strike the \"extremely\" -- what is to\nbe gained by the restrictive view that you take that if\nhe doesn't go to the Bar Association, or doesn't go\npublic, there's no protection at all? In other words,\nit seems to me that the public is being protected in a\nway subject to an immediate end run.\nMS. LEE: Well, I think what Your Honor is\nreally asking is, if the plaintiff in this case had\ntaken his disposition memorandum, and, rather than give\nit to his supervisor, which what he -- what he was\nrequired to do, he went to the public and gave it to\nthem on a pending case, I don't necessarily think that\nwould be protected under Pickering, as well.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But what if he simply goes\nto the public and says, \"Look, there's Brady material\nhere, and it should be turned over, and, instead, my\nboss is telling me to suppress it.\" That wouldn't be\nturning over his work product. And I took it, from\nwhat you said earlier, that, in that case, you would\nsay at least he gets pasts step one of Pickering for\nthe --\nMS. LEE: Well, he certainly --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- newspapers --\nMS. LEE: -- wouldn't be speaking in his\ncapacity as a prosecutor, but that doesn't necessarily\nmean that his interests would be outweighed by the\nemployer's interest. In --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, he might -- he might\nultimately lose, just the way, on all issues but one,\nthe employee in Connick lost. That's quite true. But\nat least --\nMS. LEE: And --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- there would be a claim to\ngo through the balancing --\nMS. LEE: Well, in --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- exercise.\nMS. LEE: -- in some respects, if you're\ntalking about job-required speech that you are -- part\nof those duties, and the function, is to keep it\ninternally until at least there's some decision by the\nsupervisor, and, rather than do that, you send it to\nthe press or leak that information out, I think a\ngovernmental disruption in efficiency can be presumed\nthere. So, I don't think it's as -- I don't think it's\nas clear that that -- that Mr. Ceballos would have\nultimately prevailed under the balancing. I mean, if\nhe had taken the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nMS. LEE: -- the speech externally, I think\nthere -- that he ultimately would have lost, as well --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, I understand your point.\nMS. LEE: -- because there is --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You're not saying he would\nwin on Pickering balancing, but he would at least get\nto the point of going through the balancing exercise.\nMS. LEE: And ultimately the result would be,\nthere's no protected --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Maybe.\nMS. LEE: -- First Amendment speech.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: How do you go about\ndetermining whether something falls within somebody's\njob duties? How specifically does that have to be set\nout?\nMS. LEE: If it's a function of the person's\njob -- assigned job duties. So, the -- you look at the\nspeech at issue. And here is -- it's a disposition\nmemorandum that was purely pursuant to what the -- what\nhis duties required. He's -- it's normally a function\nthat the employer would take into consideration for\nthings like promotions --\nJUSTICE ALITO: And you have to look at --\nMS. LEE: -- or demotions.\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- you have to look at a job\ndescription? And does it have to be listed\nspecifically in a job description? Could there ever be\nthings that it's understood that are things that any\nemployee ought to be concerned about, such as very\nserious wrongdoing within the office?\nMS. LEE: I mean, there could be situations\nwhere there's a general code of conduct by all\nemployees; you know, employees who feel that they've\nbeen, you know, harassed, sexually harassed, or feel\nthat others are, should report that. But that may not\nbe that person's assigned job duties. In other words,\nthat person is not assigned to investigate and report\nthose type of things.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, if --\nMS. LEE: And --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- if you adopt a principle\nthat every employee ought to -- ought to report to his\nsuperiors known wrongdoing by his co-workers, and that\nthat's part of his job duties, you -- then you always\ncut off the ability of that employee to go public,\nright? I mean, that's a -- sort of an expanding\ncategory, \"job duties.\"\nMS. LEE: Well, it would be assigned job\nduties, things that normally the employer would take\ninto consideration for things like terminating or\npromoting.\nI'd like to reserve the remainder of my time\nfor rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms. Lee.\nMr. Kneedler.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER\nFOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nMuch of the work of public employees is\nperformed by speaking or writing, and much of that work\nconcerns matters of public interest. Under the Ninth\nCircuit's decision, public employees engaged in such\nwork have at least a presumptive First Amendment right\nto perform their jobs as they see fit.\nThat conclusion rests on a fundamentally\nmistaken view of the First Amendment. When the\nGovernment pays for somebody to do its work, it has an\nabsolute right to control and direct the manner in\nwhich that work is performed. That is a basic rule of\nagency law, and insofar as Federal employees are\nconcerned, it's a basic rule of our constitutional\nstructure. Article II of the Constitution gives the\nPresident the power and responsibility to take care\nthat the laws be faithfully executed. Effectuation of\nthat power, and effectuation of the principle of\naccountability that it embodies, requires that\nsupervisors in the executive branch be able to control\nand direct the work of their subordinates. The First\nAmendment, which was adopted just a few years after the\nConstitution, was not meant to interpose the First\nAmendment in that relationship between supervisor and\nsubordinate or otherwise to regulate the internal\naffairs of the executive branch. That is the function\nof civil service laws adopted by the legislature and\ninternal executive branch directives taking into\naccount the relative costs and benefits of certain\ntypes of regulation. And finally --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, you take the position,\nthen, that -- going to the earlier hypothetical that\nsomebody brought up, that, say, in a Brady case, if the\n--if the Federal prosecutor believes there was Brady\nmaterial that -- and let's assume he's correct, just to\nmake it a simple case -- that there's Brady material to\nbe turned over, and the U.S. attorney says, \"Do not\nturn the Brady material over,\" that if the -- if the\nU.S. -- if the -- if the prosecutor tells this to a\ncourt, that he can be disciplined?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, there would, no doubt,\nbe other restrictions. Justice Kennedy mentioned\nethical rules. Under the Federal whistle-blower\nstatute --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, I'm sure --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- there would --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- that's so --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- be a restriction.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- but what about, you know,\nthe basic First Amendment --\nMR. KNEEDLER: The First Amendment would not\nbe the -- would not be the source of protection.\nWhether there would be some argument that, if the\nemployee could not be fired, it would be an\nunconstitutional condition to require him to put his\njob at peril for committing a due process violation or\nsomething like that, whether there would be a claim\nlike that, that would be a different matter. But the\nFirst Amendment --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But why would you recognize\na due process violation if you wouldn't recognize a\nFirst Amendment violation?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Because the First Amendment\ndoes not address speech that an employee undertakes in\nthe performance of his duties.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, neither does due\nprocess.\nMR. KNEEDLER: No. No, I was just suggesting\nthere would have to be some unconstitutional condition.\nWell, the due process --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but to get to the\nunconstitutional condition, wouldn't you normally look\nto the First Amendment?\nMR. KNEEDLER: My point is that the due\nprocess -- due process clause does address the conduct\nat question, which is the requirement that exculpatory\nmaterial be turned over to the defendant. And so, the\nquestion is that the employee would be put in a\nposition where he would -- where he would be instructed\nnot to perform what he understood to be a\nconstitutional violation. I think most civil service\nlaws, most ethical rules, would take care of it. And,\nas I mentioned, the Federal whistle-blower statute, in\n2302(b)(9), I think it is, has a provision that\nprotects employees who refuse --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- to obey an order --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- perhaps, 1983, if you go\nthe unconstitutional condition argument, and certainly\nin 1983 -- or arguably a civil rights prosecution\nagainst the senior who ordered --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes, there would be -- there\nwould be those sorts of restrictions. My only point is\nthat the First Amendment is not addressed to speech or\nwriting that an employee undertakes in the -- in the --\nin the course of his official duties. This --\nJUSTICE ALITO: But isn't there this -- isn't\nthere this anomaly in the position that you're\nadvocating? It would seem to me that categories of\nemployee speech that are most likely to be disruptive\nwould be public speech that's outside of the employee's\nduties, or internal speech that is outside of the\nemployee's duties. How much of a -- of a problem is it\nthat employees are bringing First Amendment claims\nbased on largely internal speech that falls within\ntheir own job duties?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I think that would be a huge\nproblem, because it would effectively constitutionalize\nthe day-to-day interactions between supervisors and\nsubordinates within the Government, and put the Federal\nCourts in charge of overseeing that. Even if these\ncases might ultimately be disposed of on summary\njudgment, there would be discovery, there would be the\nburdens of the litigation. And in a case like this,\nwhere the -- where the Government is taking the\nposition that the -- these actions were not even taken\nagainst the employee because of this disposition\nmemorandum -- they say they had perfectly valid other\nreasons -- but this case exemplifies what the problem\nwould be, is that the employee could identify something\nthat he said or did in the course of his duties that\ninvolved speech and say, \"That's the reason that I was\ndisciplined.\"\nJUSTICE ALITO: But are these going to be\ndifficult cases under Pickering balancing? You have\nthe case like this, where the employee, let's say, says\nto the prosecutor, \"I think the case should be\ndismissed.\" The prosecutor says, \"Well, I'm the\nsupervisor, and I disagree. We're not going to dismiss\nthe case.\" Typically, the employee wouldn't be\ndisciplined for doing something like that. Now, if the\nemployee persists and, you know, is insubordinate,\nthere would be another basis for taking disciplinary\naction.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, but in this case, if we\nlook at what the Ninth Circuit said, for example, when\nit got to step two, it said that the employee could\nonly be disciplined if the -- if the agency could show\nthat there was disruption or reckless disregard for the\ntruth. But when somebody is actually carrying out his\njob duties --not engaged in outside activities that may\nreflect back and be disruptive, but engaged in the job\nduties themselves, the employer has a right to insist\non more than that the employee not be disruptive or\nreckless; he has a right to insist that -- the employer\nhas a right to insist that the employee affirmatively\ncontribute to the work of the office and exercise good\njudgment. And the -- and the supervisor has to be in a\nposition to make judgments about whether that judgment\nwas good or not.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, is this going to lead\nto difficult problems in determining what falls within\nthe job duties of a particular employee?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I don't -- I don't think it --\nI don't think it will, and certainly no more problems\nthan the -- than this Court has wrestled with, and the\nlower courts have, in terms of what's a matter of\npublic concern. I think it's a common inquiry to\ndetermine what a person's job duties are. And I think\nit's a very important place to have a clear line, just\nas there is a clear line with respect to matters of\npublic concern.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Suppose, in the memo here,\nthe assistant district attorney had said, \"I think that\nthis deputy lied, and I think the deputy should be\nfired.\" Now, whether the deputy should be fired or not\nprobably isn't within the job duties of this -- of this\nemployee. So, would that be outside of your rule?\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, I think it would probably\nbe inside the rule. I think -- I would think,\nparticularly for a -- for an assistant DA to make a\nrecommendation about the consequences of illegal\nconduct would be within his -- within his job duties.\nI also want to say that this Court's decision\nin Pickering, and in that line of cases, I think, fully\nsupport this, because, as this Court pointed out in\nConnick, this Court has repeatedly stated that the\nprotection afforded by Pickering is for action taken as\na citizen on matters of public concern. That \"as a\ncitizen\" phrase was reiterated in virtually all of this\nCourt's cases in the area. And the underlying\nprinciple is that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But does the Givhan case\nfall within that?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. Yes, it does. But all\nthe Court addressed in Givhan was the question of\nwhether, if you take your concerns not publicly to the\nnewspaper, but express them to the -- in that case, the\nprincipal, that you don't lose First Amendment\nprotection. But the Court did not address the question\nof whether those comments were within the scope of the\nemployee's duties. And I think a reading of lower\ncourt's decision in Givhan indicates that they were\nnot. She was an English teacher, and she was\ncommenting to the principal about employment practices\nat the school. That would not have been within the\nscope of her employment. And then --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But if she was the vice\nprincipal, that would be -- then it would come --\nMR. KNEEDLER: I'm --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- within your --\nMR. KNEEDLER: It might be -- it might be\ncloser to that, yes. I think, again, it would depend\nif she was -- if she was vice principal for\nadministration or something, I think -- I think it\nclearly would.\nBut the purpose of the Pickering line of\ncases is to protect employees when they go outside of\ntheir -- of their job, that they shouldn't be penalized\nfor having taken a job to be able to participate in\npublic affairs, as the Court put it in Pickering. That\ndoes not suggest that the -- that the employee brings\nthe First Amendment into the job workplace and can use\nit as a shield or a sword in the day-to-day\ninteractions with his supervisors, and to do so would\nconstitutionalize, as I said, the day-to-day\noperations of employment. And this is a classic\nexample, where somebody wrote a disposition memorandum\nin the course of --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And you're suggesting --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- in the course of those\nactivities.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- that a remark made\ninternally could not provide the basis for discipline,\nbut saying exactly the same thing publicly could. I\nmean -- or vice versa.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, if it's made publicly in\nthe capacity as a citizen, assuming the public -- it\nisn't a speech that he's making in the course of his\nduties -- if he writes something to the press, he's\nspeaking in his capacity as a citizen. That doesn't\nmean that it would be constitutionally protected; it\nsimply means that you get to step two of the Pickering\nbalancing, because he's not carrying --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, I'm assuming --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- out the job duties.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- a case in which it would\nbe constitutionally protected. But you're saying if he\nsays it publicly -- assuming we pass the balancing test\n-- but if he said the same thing to his boss directly\ninternally, no protection.\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, that -- at least not if\nit's part of his job duties. And I would think --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Which is a --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- ordinarily in that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- rule that would sort of\nencourage people to go public rather than --\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, I mean --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- exhaust their internal\nremedies.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Two things about that. When\nhe's saying it internally, he's doing his job. When\nhe's going externally, he may be violating office\npolicies.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nKneedler.\nMs. Robin-Vergeer.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF BONNIE I. ROBIN-VERGEER\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nPetitioners contend that the First Amendment\nprovides no protection when the Government silences or\npunishes a public employee for speaking up on a matter\nof vital public importance in the course of performing\nhis job, even if the Government has no legitimate\nemployment reason for doing so. Such a sweeping rule\nwould stifle speech that lies at the very core of the\nFirst Amendment. Recognizing Richard Ceballos's claim\nin this case would not convert every public employment\ndispute into a constitutional case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think it's probably\na bit much to say that the core of the First Amendment\nis internal employee grievances or speech. And I think\nthe concern on the other side is that you may -- as a\nlawyer, you may have a view of what the -- what Brady\nrequires. Your superior may have a different view.\nAnd just because that disagreement exists doesn't mean\nthat you have a constitutional right to continue to\nvoice your view when your superior has reached a\ndifferent decision.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: I agree with that. The\nFirst Amendment doesn't bar the Government from\ndisciplining employees for insubordination or poor job\nperformance or for continuing or persisting in a matter\nonce their supervisor's told them to stop. Where an\nadverse employment action's motivated by such\nlegitimate employment reasons, there's no First\nAmendment violation. But the Petitioners here have not\nclaimed any legitimate interest in punishing Ceballos\nfor what he said, nor have they made the case --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, their -- the interest\nthey claim that of supervising their employees.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: That is not correct. In\nthis case, the Petitioners --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, that's the interest\nthat we're concerned with, is of having the Government\nhave the capacity to be able to control the speech of\nits employees so they could have a consistent policy\nand so that it can explain to the people what it's\ndoing.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: They've articulated that\nas an abstract principle that has no application on the\nfacts of this case, because on the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- facts of -- sorry.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Go on. I'll let --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: On the facts of this --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- let's hear your --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- case, they never claim\nthat Ceballos did anything improper, that he exercised\npoor judgment, that he was insubordinate. They just\nsaid, \"We didn't retaliate.\" That was their defense of\nthis case. And that presents a fact question for the\njury.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But you're the one that's\nasking us to adopt a rule. And I'm suggesting to you\nthat there is an interest that's sacrificed by the rule\nthat you request, and that is the Government's interest\nin regularity and consistency of its speech. They\ndon't have to claim it on a case-by-case basis. You're\nthe ones that are asking us to make this rule.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: With respect, I disagree\nwith the characterization, because -- well, there are\nthree reasons why Petitioners proposed per se rule,\nwhich would be unwise. And it is they who are asking\nfor a per se exclusion where the Court has not\npreviously adopted a per se exclusion. And the reason\nwhy it's unwise is that it will chill speech of\nparamount public importance by prosecutors and many\nother public employees. It will force many public\nemployees to go public if they want any chance of\nconstitutional protection, and it will lead to\narbitrary and unworkable linedrawing regarding whether\nan employee's speech falls --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- within his job duties.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Because public employee\nunions are so weak? They're the only strong unions\nleft in the country. I mean, really.\n[Laughter.]\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You need the Constitution to\nprotect employees against things of this sort?\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Absolutely. The Court\nhas recognized, in Pickering and in other cases, that\nthe threat of dismissal from public employment is a\npotent means of inhibiting speech. Public employees\nwho speak up within their workplaces about police\nbrutality, falsification of evidence, disaster\npreparedness, and so on, should not be compelled to\nshade the reports and the recommendations and tell\ntheir superiors only what they want to hear or else\nface reprisal for their candor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, but neither should a\nsuperior be required to get a report from a subordinate\nthat he thinks is way off base, just a result of poor\njudgment, thinking that there -- that there was a\nviolation here, when there -- when there obviously\nwasn't, or using facts that were not sufficiently\nestablished in order to claim such a violation.\nSurely, the employer is entitled to say, \"On the basis\nof this report, which you gave me, you're fired.\"\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: That's absolutely --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Or -- you know, or --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: That's absolutely\ncorrect. And if, in this case, that judgment had been\nmade by Ceballos's employer, that he had exercised poor\njudgment, that he was rash or reckless in his\nconclusions, then the employer would have had a valid\nbasis for taking an adverse employment action against\nhim. But that is not what happened in this case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but you're just\nhiding behind the fact that they claimed that it wasn't\nin retaliation. Your assertion still puts them in the\nposition of having to defend a constitutional claim on\na case-by-case basis every time there's a disagreement\nbetween a subordinate and a superior about, as in this\ncase, what Brady requires.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Well, actually, the\ndisagreement -- there wasn't any disagreement. He came\nforward and exposed police misconduct. And his\nsupervisors were on his side.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There was a\ndisagreement about whether or not his memorandum\naccurately reflected, in an appropriate way, what was\nat issue there. There was a disagreement about the\ncontent of the allegations.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: I don't think it's\nimportant, for, maybe, purposes of this, to iron this\nout, but I -- respectfully, I don't agree with that\ncharacterization, because, even in the resolution of\nthe grievance internally, the -- what they found in the\ngrievance was that they took no adverse action against\nhim because of what he said --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That doesn't --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- in connection with\nthis case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That isn't the point. I\nthink the point is, at least for -- I think point is\nwho is going to decide whether there was some\njustification here. And I read this memo. I thought\nthat the DA had a pretty good claim, that the police\ndidn't do anything wrong. And there's also an argument\nthey did. All right. So, who decides that kind of\nthing? A constitutional court or a State, under its\nprotection laws or whistle-blower statutes?\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: No --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And the argument that you\nhave to face, I think, is that it will be very\ndisruptive to have constitutional judges dive into\nthis, when there are so many other remedies, and where\nthe very act of their doing it, allowing discovery,\nallowing court cases, allowing juries, itself, will\ndisrupt the Government. Now, if you say they give you\nno protection at all, I want to hear what you have to\nsay as to what the standard is to separate the sheep\nfrom the goats.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Okay. There are a few\npoints embedded in the question, and I'd like to take\nthem one by one.\nWith respect to the standard, the standard\nis, if the employer makes a judgment that the public\nemployee has not performed his or her job properly or\nhas been insubordinate, so long as that judgment isn't\nbased on a censorial type motive, like, \"We don't\ntolerate criticism of the sheriff's department,\"\nsomething like that, then the employer's judgment\nprevails. And I'm not suggesting that a district --\nFederal district Court has license to second-guess that\njudgment, so long as that judgment's actually the\njudgment that was made. I mean, there's a pretext\nanalysis that might be made in this case --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The only cases that would go\ninto court are cases where the employer says, \"I have\nno reason at all for firing him\"?\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Well, in a case like\nthis, the county never came forward --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But that's because --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- and said that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- they think they have a\nbetter claim on the other part. I mean, if -- even if\nyou're right in this one, I promise you, the next one\nwill come along, and they'll say, \"Of course we had a\ngood reason for firing him. One, we didn't fire him\nfor that reason. Two, if we did, we would have been\njustified,\" or whatever. So --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: But --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- if your standard is, the\nonly cases that go into court under the First Amendment\nare cases where the employer says, \"I had no basis for\ndoing anything to him whatsoever,\" then I think there\nwill be few such cases, though you might convince me\nthat that standard --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- wouldn't do any harm.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- that's why I said that\nit would be subject to a pretext analysis. The\nemployer, of course, might come back and -- and, post\nhoc, come up with a rationale for --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that'll --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- why they did --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- always be --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- what they did.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- the claim. That'll\nalways be the claim. They'll always say, \"Oh, yes,\nyou said you did it because of that, but you did it\nbecause you're retaliating\" --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: You know --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- \"for this or that.\" I\nmean --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- we're not operating in\nuncharted territory here. The rule that the Ninth\nCircuit has adopted has been the prevailing rule in the\nCircuits for years. And I just want to clarify\nsomething that came up in the last argument, where I\ncited some very rough statistics about the numbers of\ncases. There's a rough -- a rough cut at the universe\nof public employee free-speech cases, of which this\ntype of case, where the speech is part of the job, is\nonly a tiny subset. These cases are not dominating the\ncourts, and you don't have all the litigation that is\nbeing --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that because --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- claimed would occur.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- they're addressed\n-- is it -- they're addressed under State and Federal\nwhistle-blower laws, or --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: No, that's -- actually\ngets me back to the second part of Justice Breyer's\nquestion, which is protection. And it's a complete\nhit-or-miss situation across the country. And just to\nrespond to something that was said about the Federal\nWhistle-blower Protection Act, that statute has a\ngaping hole in it, as construed by the Federal Circuit,\nbecause the Federal Circuit has construed it to exclude\nprotection for speech that is part of the employee's\nnormal duties. So, in any case that would come up with\na Federal employee, leaving aside what judicial\nremedies are even available for a Federal employee in\nthis area, the Federal employee would be largely\nunprotected by the Federal Whistle-blower statute. And\nwith respect to what the state of law is across the\ncountry, it's complete patchwork. Different types of\nspeech are protected, there's huge holes in coverage.\nThere is no --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about California,\nwhich was the State where this episode occurred? Was -\n- I think you mentioned that he did not make a claim\nunder the State statute.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: That's correct. And it's\nsort of interesting that neither the Petitioners, the\nUnited States, or any of the amici have cited a\nCalifornia whistle-blower statute that would have been\napplicable to this claim. I -- frankly, I think that there\nwas one that potentially might have been applicable,\nnot cited by any of the parties, but the law was in\nflux, and it really wasn't all that clear. And that's\n-- and California's probably one of the better States,\nin terms of whistle-blower protections, compared to --\nand we're talking about a local government employee,\nand the odds of protection -- it's just hit or miss\nacross the country.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Are you saying --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: The --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Are you -- are you saying\nthe California courts would tolerate a situation where\na member of the bar told one of his employees to\nmisrepresent to the court?\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: If you're --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The California courts --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- referring back to\nhypothetical --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The California courts are\ncertainly not tolerating -- and, in fact, this case was\nheard by a California court, and the -- and the judge,\nas I read the record -- it's not altogether clear --\nseemed to agree with the -- with the police officers.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: The motion to reverse\nthat was heard by a State Court judge was not run --\nthat hearing was not run by Ceballos. It was run by\nthe defense lawyers in that case. And Ceballos's\ntestimony was limited by the prosecution's own\nobjection. So, you can't judge anything from how that\ndisposition came out, whether the State Court judge\nthought it was -- the police had lied or not lied. And\nyou can't judge anything by the way that hearing was\nconducted.\nBut I want to return to why it's so important\nthat the Court not shrink First Amendment activity in\nthe workplace. It is of the utmost importance that\npublic employees, who internally report matters of\npublic concern, enjoy First Amendment protection, and\nfor two basic reasons. First, the public needs to have\na Government of public servants who do their jobs\nhonestly and with integrity, and not yes-men afraid to\ntell public officials the bad news. A per se exclusion\nof First Amendment protection creates a powerful\ndisincentive for deliberation within Government. The\nlast time, I cited an example of a FEMA employee who\nwas punished for saying to a supervisor that FEMA\nwasn't ready to handle the next hurricane. But the\nfacts of this case are just as compelling, denying a\nFirst Amendment protection for prosecutors who expose\npolice misconduct. And his disposition memo wasn't\njust a prediction about whether -- how a judge would\nrule on a motion; he exposed police misconduct and it --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- was so --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that's not -- that's not\nestablished. That's not established at all. His\nsupervisor obviously thought he didn't --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: I'm sorry, I didn't mean\nto suggest that -- the truth of that allegation may be\nopen to question, but what is not open to question --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but it's a very serious\nallegation for somebody who's in the position that this\nemployee was to make against police officers. And as I\nunderstood the case, the supervisor said, \"Wow, I don't\nwant loose cannons around down there who are accusing\nperfectly honest and respectable police officers of\nviolating the law.\" Now, that --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: And --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- hasn't been proven,\neither. But --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Right. I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that is certainly a\npossibility. And I do not want to exclude the ability\nof a supervisor to fire somebody, if that possibility\nexists, without having to go through extensive\nlitigation.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: With -- regardless of\nwhether he was ultimately correct or not, there's no\nquestion, and there's no serious argument here, that he\nhad a legitimate basis for believing that police\nmisconduct had occurred. He conferred with his\nsupervisors and his colleagues before writing the memo.\nEveryone agreed that there was a problem with the\nwarrant. And they took his allegations so seriously\nthat they released a defendant who had plead guilty.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Say it's a --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But if --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: And went to Jail\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- borderline case --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- none of that were\ntrue -- if none of that were true, he could still file\nhis complaint. Presumably it survives a motion to\ndismiss, and it goes at least to summary judgment. And\nthat's true in every case of a disagreement between a\nsubordinate and a superior.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: That's true of every\npublic employee government -- excuse me -- public\nemployee speech case, period. Almost all of these\ncases go to summary judgment. They can't be dismissed\nat the pleading stage, by and large, because they\nrequire factual development. So, all that -- all that\nthis per se rule does is add complexity and a need\nfor greater factual development. It's not the magic\nbullet that the Petitioners seem to think it is. The\nGivhan case suggests the unworkability of drawing the\nFirst Amendment line as what's part of an employee's\njob. Conferences between a teacher and her principal\ntake in the same level of generality as writing a\ndisposition memorandum --\nJUSTICE ALITO: But what about the cases --\nputting aside the clear-cut case where the employee's\nstatement is either clearly correct or clearly\nincorrect, but what about the case where the objection\nto what the employee is doing is the manner of the\nspeech? It's on the matter -- it's on the matter of\nconcern, but the supervisor just thinks that it's being\nhandled in a way that's ham-handed or indiscrete.\nAren't they going to -- aren't these cases going to\ncause terrible litigation problems?\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: No, they won't, and they\nhaven't. If the employee -- employer has a concern\nabout the manner in which it's communicated, that is a\nvalid employment concern. I mean, suppose Ceballos had\ngone a had a big meeting with --\nJUSTICE ALITO: But under --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- the sheriff's department -\n-\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- then under Pickering --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- and embarrassed them?\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- the test is going to be\nwhether the manner, which may be difficult to recreate,\ncaused -- how much of a disruption it caused to the\noperations of the office.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: These -- you'd think that\nif there was that type of disruption and hindrance of\nthe way public agencies were carrying out their\nmissions by these kinds of cases, which have been\naround for a long time, that you'd see citations to\nthem in the Petitioner's brief, in the United States\nbrief. And their silence on this point is both\ndeafening and telling, because, in fact, it has not\nbeen the problem that is being posited here, and this\nis not a new approach that we're talking about.\nBut getting back to the Givhan case,\nconferences between teachers and principals are a part\nof the teacher's job, and it's pure formalism to make\nthe protected status of the Givhan teacher's speech\nturn on whether the employee manual says a teacher has\nto work to root out race discrimination. Or what if\nshe was a part-time ombudsman who is charged to improve\nrace relations in the school? Under their approach,\nyou know, boom, it's not protected speech anymore, even\nthough the underlying First Amendment value is exactly\nthe same. It also makes it completely subject to\nmanipulation by the employer in making everything a\npart of an employer -- employee's job, in terms of\nreporting duties, which --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The First Amendment value\nmay be the same, but it -- but what is present is\nanother value. And unless the person is willing to go\npublic, in which case the balancing occurs, and\nassuming there's no prohibition of it, that other value\nis a very significant one, the ability of public\nofficials to run their offices.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: But here's the problem\nwith going public. It's perverse to create an incentive\nfor employees to go public, especially employees in\nsensitive position -- in a sensitive position. The\nFirst Amendment consequences here are especially grave,\nbecause Ceballos had no realistic alternative channel\nfor communication open to him. Had he gone to a blog,\nWeb site, podcast, and so on, as Petitioners say in\ntheir reply brief, or held a press conference, or gone\nto Los Angeles Times, and so on, he'd be fired, and\nhe'd lose any First Amendment case that he brought.\nSo, what avenue does a prosecutor who wants --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But what he has --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- to bring --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But the argument that I\nthink people are worried about, against you, is, you\nhave a case -- it's actually a wonderful example. Your\nclient thinks that, in the affidavit that the sheriffs\ngave supporting the warrant, they didn't tell the\ntruth, because they said that whoever was looking into\nit, you know, said there was a private driveway and\nthat there were tire tracks, and there were no tire\ntracks, and it wasn't a private driveway. The other\nside says, \"Yes, it was a long road, but sort of like a\ndriveway, and the edge of the -- of the driveway was\nbroken down, and that's what the sheriff's deputies\nwere referring to.\" I found it a dispute on both\nsides.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Well, you know --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, if, in fact, he's being\ndisciplined for that, the other side is telling you he\nhas a lot of remedies, he has a variety of remedies.\nGo to the bar associations. Many States have laws, the\nstatutes that protect people under these situations.\nAnd why suddenly go to a constitutional court to get\nthe same relief which will short circuit all the other\nremedies? And if you do, there are going to be\nthousands of cases less good than yours, and they'll\nall run to -- to the constitutional court. All right.\nSo, now, what's your reply?\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: There is no baseline\nlevel of protection that is available by statute or\ncivil service protections. If the Court recognizes\nthat the speech involved here, exposing Government\nmisconduct and so on, is important for First Amendment\npurposes, as it has previously recognized, then it's --\nthen it needs to be a baseline level of First Amendment\nprotection. And then if whistle-blower statutes are\npassed that protect it beyond the baseline level,\nthat's fine. I'm not maligning whistle-blower\nstatutes. But there is no such level of protection\nthat is guaranteed. For someone in his position, if\nthe First Amendment does not protect his speech, it's\njust not protected.\nAnd I want to get back to -- I started to say\nwhy it's so important that the speech be protected.\nIt's not just that the public needs to have a\nGovernment of public servants, but the Government needs\nto know how it's operating. How can Government\nfunction efficiently and effectively if it does not\npossess the information it needs to make responsible\nchoices? When an employment decision is actually made\nbecause the employee has made a bad judgment and he\nreached an unwarranted conclusion in his memo, or the\nmanner in which he conveyed it was terribly indiscrete,\nhe publicized in front of the whole sheriff's\ndepartment, and embarrassed them, when that's an issue,\nthen the employment can respond, and the courts will\nmake quick -- short shrift of those cases, as they do\nnow.\nJUSTICE ALITO: When --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that --\nJUSTICE ALITO: It --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- was my point\nearlier. They can't make short shrift of those cases,\nbecause they're not going to be thrown out at the\npleading stage. They're going to have to progress at\nleast to summary judgment, probably in every case in\nwhich an employee is terminated, because now one of his\ndefenses against termination is, \"You're violating my\nFirst Amendment rights.\"\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: But, I mean, the Court\nneeds to appreciate that for the universe of public\nemployee free-speech cases, they're mostly decided at\nsummary judgment; they aren't decided on the pleadings.\nThat's already the case. And all that adding a job-\nduty element to it is, adds complexity and requires\nmore factual development. It -- there's a number of\nissues here. First of all, what counts as part of an\nemployee's job? Does the speech have to be required by\nthe job, or merely related to the job? How do you\njudge if the speech meets the test? Do you go by the\njob description? Common practice? What if the\nemployee's speech is not required by the job, but some\nindependent ethical duty compelled him to come forward\n--\nJUSTICE ALITO: If Pickering --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- as is the case here?\nAnd, also, what if the employee --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Cases involving those\nquestions would have to go to the courts, I assume.\nBut they'd be a small percentage of all the cases that\nwould go to the courts if we adopt your position. I\nagree, there will still be some cases left that'll have\nto go to the courts to sort out these questions that\nyou mentioned. But that's going to be a small\npercentage of the totality.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Well, it's already a\nsmall percentage of the totality, because cases of this\ntype, which involve speech by a public employee while\nthey're doing their job, however that is formulated,\nare already a small subset of the universe of public\nemployee --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Perhaps --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- cases.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- because it's been\nunclear, until this Court has spoken to the subject,\nand especially in light of the dicta in our prior\ncases, which says that he has to be speaking publicly.\nThe reason for the -- for the -- for the paucity of\ncases can be, simply, that the law was not clear, and\nmost people thought the way -- the way your opponent in\nthis case thinks.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: That's incorrect. I\nmean, most of the Circuits have addressed this\nquestion, and virtually all of them are -- have sided\nwith the Ninth Circuit and has -- have refused to draw\na bright-line rule when speech has come up as part of\nthe job.\nAnd the -- and as -- Justice Scalia, you seem\nto be referring to the \"as a citizen\" phrase the Court\nhas used in its opinions. And I want to address that.\nNo decision by this Court has ever turned on the \"as a\ncitizen\" phrase, and it's always been used in\nconjunction with \"matter of public concern.\" The most\nthat can be said is the phrase characterizes the facts\nof the cases in which the Court used it. The Court\nhasn't addressed whether speech that's part of the job\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but the Court didn't\nsay this guy had blue eyes.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Speech --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It said he was speaking as a\n-- that seemed to the Court to be important to its\ndecision.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Speech -- and I don't\nmean to suggest it has no meaning, but \"speech as a\ncitizen\" means speech that one can readily imagine a\nconcerned citizen engaging in. You can imagine a\nconcerned citizen coming forward to report race\ndiscrimination --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's not --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- in a school.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- the context in\nwhich this law developed. It developed, originally --\nif you were a public employee, you did not have free-\nspeech rights as a citizen. As Justice Holmes said,\nyou know, you might have the right to speak, but you\ndon't have the right to be a policeman. So, the \"as a\ncitizen\" part didn't come out of happenstance.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It was recognizing\nthat when you are speaking \"as a citizen,\"\njuxtaposition to \"as an employee,\" then you do have\nFirst Amendment rights.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: But if you look at the\nway it was used in Pickering, which, of course, is a\ndifferent case -- but, in Pickering, the Court was\nemphasizing that public employees, like all citizens,\nhave an interest in speaking on a matter of public\nconcern. The Court, in Connick, suggested that if the\nprosecutor there had spoken to bring to light actual or\npotential wrongdoing or breach of public trust, her\nspeech would have presumptively been protected. If she\nhad done that, she'd be speaking in the same capacity\nthat Ceballos spoke here. One can readily imagine a\nconcerned citizen stepping forward to expose Government\nmisconduct. And it can be difficult to sort out in\nwhich capacity an employee is speaking. And sometimes\nan employee can speak in more than one capacity at\nonce.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If Pickering balancing is\ndone, is there anything special about the situation\nwhere the employee's speech is part of the employee's\njob duties? Is the test applied differently in that\nsituation?\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: It does, because if the\nemployer makes a judgment -- as I said before, if the\nemployer makes a judgment that the employee has carried\nhis job duties poorly, incompetently, insubordinately,\nand so on, that interest is -- it's either dispositive\nof the balance, or it's nearly so. And it -- so, from\nthat standpoint, the Court could put a gloss on the\nPickering balance that explains or emphasizes that the\nemployer's interests are controlling how the jobs are\nperformed, prevails.\nBut to get back, for a moment, to the --\nJUSTICE ALITO: No, I'm not sure I understood\nthat answer. So, in this situation, if the employer\nsaid that Mr. Ceballos was performing his job poorly,\nthat would be enough to tip the balance in the\nemployer's favor --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: If that was --\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- under Pickering here?\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: If that were really the\ncase. In a case like this, it would be clearly\npretextual, because not only -- not only was that not\nthe basis that was actually offered, but the employer\nsided with him initially and released the defendant and\nsaid he had a legitimate basis for speaking, and called\na meeting with the sheriff's department, and took all\nthese steps to show that they actually sided with him.\nAnd only when the sheriff's department accused him of\n-- as acting like a public defender and said, \"We're\ngoing to get sued if you don't back us up,\" then the\noffice changed its position and went against Ceballos.\nSo, in a case like this, it would clearly be\npretextual. In another case, however, it would not --\npresumably there are cases where it would not be\npretextual.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So, basically, the test --\nthe Pickering balancing is the same in this situation\nas it is in, let's say, the Givhan situation.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Well, this case is almost\nidentical to Givhan. The only -- the only thing is\nthat the Court, in Givhan, didn't expressly opine on\nwhat capacity in which she was speaking. But it clear\nthat --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but I --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- a teacher speaking --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: May I --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- in both capacities --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: May I interrupt you? I\nthought you said that, in this case, as distinct from\nGivhan, there would be cognizable employer interests in\nincompetence, the truth of what was said, the capacity\nto do the job without roiling the waters unduly, and so\non. And that, I take it, is not necessarily so in a\nGivhan situation. Or is it?\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: In --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Maybe the employer has the\nsame interest in each. I --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: I think --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- I have --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- the employer had the\nsame interest in both cases. The question in Givhan\nwas the fact that it was an internal report to the\nemployer: Did that matter? Did that reduce its\nprotection? The Court said no. So, the only thing\nthat it would take to make Givhan exactly like this is\nto put it in the employee manual or make her an\nombudsman so it's -- so there's not even room for\nargument that it was part --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but in --\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- of her job.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- in Givhan, if the\nemployee's assigned duties were all done competently,\nbut she had just gone off the deep end on racial\nbalance or something, the employer would not have had -\n- if -- so long as it was the -- a private\ncommunication like that, I don't know that the employer\nwould have had an interest in saying, \"Well, you're\nincompetent on the subject of racial balance, and\ntherefore I -- you know, I'm going to demote you or\nfire you.\" But in the case in which the employee is\ntalking on the subject within the job description, then\nthe employer has got -- I thought you were saying he's\ngot a direct interest in competence, truth, and so on.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Yes, that's --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: -- that's correct.\nThat's right.\nLet me turn, just for a second, to -- getting\nback to the complexity here, and the linedrawing that\nhas to be done. The Petitioner's own hypotheticals\nunderscore the arbitrariness and unworkability of their\napproach. In -- if you look in the reply brief, at\npage 13, note 11, they cite, as an example, a county\nemergency-room doctor who -- and then they put \"is not\npart of their normal duties,\" to sort of build it into\nthe hypothetical -- would have a right, a First\nAmendment right, to come forward and talk about\ninefficiencies in a county emergency room. Whereas,\nthe State health inspector, who finds health code\nviolations in nursing homes do not. The First\nAmendment value in those situations are the same. And,\nif anything, it's greater for the county emergency --\nfor the -- for the -- I've said this backwards -- the\ncounty emergency-room doctor who's talking about how\nthe -- how the county hospital is operating. There's\nno difference there. And it's a completely arbitrary\nlinedrawing.\nSuppose Ceballos had gone outside the chain\nof command, suppose he had reported to Garcetti that\nthere was police misconduct. It's not clear where that\nposition would -- where their position would lead them.\nNow it's not part of his normal job duty to go talk to\nthe DA. He's bypassed the chain of command. But it\nseems that they would say that, \"Well, because it was\nnot part of his normal job duty, it -- then it would be\nprotected.\" And, if so, what message is that sending\npublic employees about whether they should follow their\nemployer's own rules about how you communicate in the\nworkplace and what the chain of command is? It doesn't\nmake any sense to force public employees to go public,\nas that does more to increase disharmony and disruption\nin the workplace than having an employee like Ceballos,\nwho followed every rule and every order and instruction\nregarding how to handle the case and how to communicate\nwithin the workplace.\nConnick said that the First Amendment's\nprimary aim is the full protection of speech upon\nissues of public concern, as well as the practical\nrealities involved in the administration of a\nGovernment office. The proposed rule is inconsistent\nwith that primary aim. It doesn't do anyone any good\nto have U.S. attorneys and DAs blind-sided by coverups\nin their office because their employees were afraid to\ncome forward and tell their supervisors the bad news.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, for that reason,\nthey're -- for that reason, they're not likely to --\nin most instances, they would not be hostile to\nreceiving that kind of information, if it was provided\nto them.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: May I answer?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure.\nMS. ROBIN-VERGEER: Unfortunately, there's\ntoo much evidence, there's too much water under the\nbridge, that shows that public employees who deliver\nbad news, and are the unwelcome messenger, do face\nretaliation in their workplaces. And here, Ceballos\ntold his workplace, his supervisors, that police\nmisconduct had occurred, and that was an unwelcome\nmessage, and he was retaliated against for that reason.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms. Robin-\nVergeer.\nMs. Lee, you have 3 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CINDY S. LEE\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS\nMS. LEE: Thank you, Your Honor.\nI think that's an important point, Justice\nAlito. I mean, in this case, it's exactly what\nhappened. The supervisors took Mr. Ceballos's\nassessment seriously. And the difference was, after\nthey further thought about it, they didn't think --\nthey didn't agree with the proper course of action for\nthe district attorney's office, especially since there\nwas a motion pending, \"Let's let the courts decide\nthat.\" So, if -- where -- I think Plaintiff's\nsuggesting that, but for protecting speech that's\nrequired by the duties of employment, employees really\nwould not have much of a right or a remedy if it turns\nout that the employer believed that maybe they weren't\nperforming their jobs correctly, or, in our case, if\nthe supervisor had considered the speech and said, \"You\nknow what? You made a bad judgment call, and we don't\nthink it's entitled to a promotion,\" that shouldn't\ngive the Plaintiff a constitutional right to challenge\nthat decision. If that -- if the -- if Mr. Ceballos\nwas, in fact, doing his job, that was required of his\njob, and he was doing it competently, his remedy is not\nthe First Amendment. His remedy is not even -- he\ndoesn't even need a whistle-blower statute for that.\nHe could go through civil service, he could go through\na formal grievance procedure, and though -- although\nState statutes on whistle-blowers do vary, there is no\nState statute, in my understanding, that covers broadly\nthan what the Ninth Circuit does here --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Lee --\nMS. LEE: -- which is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- what do you respond to\nthe argument that this has been the law in a number of\nCircuits and the sky has not fallen?\nMS. LEE: Well, the reason that job-required\nspeech may not be -- may not be filed, or basis for\nFirst Amendment retaliation, or the reason why we may\nnot have seen that, may simply be because public\nemployees understandably do not believe they're\nexercising their First Amendment rights when they are\nsimply performing their duties of employment, when\nthey're speaking pursuant to their job duties or\nwriting reports or memorandums pursuant to their job\nduties. Just because there may not be the significant\nincrease of First Amendment litigation in the public\nemployment context for purely job-required speech does\nnot mean that this Court should not consider this\nissue.\nAnd I disagree with the representation that\nthe facts in this case are identical to Givhan. This\nCourt commented in that decision that Givhan was\ncitizen speech. And I don't necessarily think that --\nand it -- what -- that -- where our proposal -- our\napproach would add further complexity to First\nAmendment litigation in an employment context. It's\ncertainly not a difficult decision -- analysis in this\ncase.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you --\nMS. LEE: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- Ms. Lee.\n"
