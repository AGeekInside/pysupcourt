ROBERTS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. ROBERTS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis case arises out of an explosion that killed\nfour employees on a drilling barge on the inland waters of\nLouisiana. The barge is not inspected for certification\nby the Coast Guard, which therefore has almost no\nregulations that address occupational safety and health on\nthe barge. The question presented is whether the Coast\nGuard has, nonetheless, exercised authority over the\nworking conditions on the barge so as to displace\napplication of the Occupational Safety and Health Act.\nQUESTION: Well, Mr. Roberts, the Coast Guard\ndoes have regulations, though, that require an emergency\nplan and fire control devices.\nMR. ROBERTS: Not -- not that apply to this\nvessel, Your Honor. The -- the only occupational -- the\nonly regulations addressed to occupational safety and\nhealth issues on this barge that have been identified by\nrespondent and its amici are regulations that address risk\nfrom the marine sanitation devices, or the toilets, on the\nvessel.\nThe only other regulation of which I'm aware\nthat deals with occupational safety and health is a\nregulation that -- that addresses operating the vessel\nwhile intoxicated. Those regulations -- there are\nregulations that address emergency procedures on inspected\nvessels, but not on this type of uninspected vessel.\nQUESTION: Fire safety regulations are -- are\ndifferent from -- from -\nMR. ROBERTS: No, no. There are no fire and\nsafety regulations on -- on this vessel, Your Honor.\nThere are some specific fire and safety regulations\nrequired by some statutes on particular types of vessels,\nparticularly vessels propelled by machinery. Those are\nthe ones covered by -- by 46 U.S.C. 4102.\nQUESTION: Well, if -- if the Coast Guard has\nregulations that try to contain a hazardous event, after\nit occurs, as opposed to regulations trying to prevent it\nin the first place, do you say that the containment\napproach just doesn't qualify under this statute as a\nCoast Guard regulation?\nMR. ROBERTS: No, Your Honor, but -- but with\nrespect to -- to this vessel, as I -- as I was saying,\nthey don't have such regulations. The -- the containment\napproach would -- would qualify, although if -- if a\nregulation was addressed to preventing a fire for\noccurring, that would address a -- a different -- a\ndifferent hazard than a regulation that was addressed to\nresponding to that after the fire had occurred and -- and\ncould be put out.\nBut -- but here, the Coast Guard has not\nexercised statutory authority over the working conditions\ninvolved in this case, and under section 4(b)(1) of the\nact, the --\nQUESTION: Mr. Roberts, do you think you could\nexplain to us -- just go back to the basics. What is the\ndifference between an inspected vessel and an uninspected\nAnd also, you introduced just now not this type\nof an inspection. So, there are subcategories within an\ninspection. If you could just tell us what fills those\ncategories -\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes. Yes, Your Honor.\nFirst, to -- to start at the -- the beginning of\nyour question, there are certain categories of vessels\nthat are listed under the statute as inspected vessels and\nwith respect -- under Coast Guard statutes as inspected\nvessels. On those vessels, the Coast Guard inspects them\nat the beginning and then periodically for certification\nthat they're in satisfactory condition, fit for the\nservice for which they're intended and seaworthy. The\nCoast Guard also has comprehensive regulatory authority\nover those vessels, and it's exercised that authority\ncomprehensively over those vessels. So, for those\nvessels, the Secretary and the Coast Guard agree the -\nthe Occupational Safety and Health Act doesn't apply.\nThen there's another set of vessels -\nQUESTION: May I -- may I interrupt you right\nthere? And I don't want to interrupt this whole answer.\nDoes -- OSHA doesn't apply just as to those measures -\njust as to those working conditions on those vessels that\nhave been covered?\nSuppose OSHA has a regulation about kitchens.\nYou have to have guards on the carving knives or\nsomething. And the Coast Guard, on an inspected vessel,\ndoes not have that provision. Under the scheme, as it\nworks, can OSHA regulate the -- the kitchen knife problem,\nor -- or is it completely displaced? Because -\nMR. ROBERTS: It's completely displaced on the\ninspected vessels because the Coast Guard has\ncomprehensive authority over those and has exercised its\ncomprehensive authority on the inspected vessels by\npromulgating comprehensive regulations, and those\nregulations include specific ones addressing specific\nhazards, as well as general provisions such as the one\nthat I was referring to that requires that the vessels be\nfit for the service that they're intended and safe and\nseaworthy. And therefore, with respect to those, all the\nworking conditions are covered either by the specifics or\nby the general, and the OSH Act does not apply.\nBut what we're concerned with in this case is a\n-- is a vessel on which -- over which the Coast Guard has\nmuch more limited authority and with respect to which it\n-- it has authority to and has regulated only very\nspecific conditions.\nQUESTION: Getting back to the inspected\nvessels, because this might have a bearing on -- on how we\nwrite the opinion in this case, even though it's\nuninspected. Are there instances in which there are -\nthere is concurrent jurisdiction between the Coast Guard\nand OSHA on inspected vessels?\nMR. ROBERTS: Not with respect to regulation in\nterms of setting occupational safety and health standards\nand enforcing occupational safety and health standards.\nThere is, with respect to reporting or investigation on\ninspected vessels -- I mean, not -- no. I guess the\nanswer is no.\nQUESTION: I hope I didn't take you too far off\nthe track. You were talking about inspected and\nuninspected vessels.\nMR. ROBERTS: To get back to the uninspected\nvessels that -- that Justice Ginsburg had asked about and\nwhich is what we -- we have in this case, on those\nvessels, there's very limited authority. It flows from\nspecific statutory grants that deal with specific items of\nsafety. And therefore, the Coast Guard regulation of\nworking conditions on those vessels is spotty, depending\non the statutory grants of authority.\nAnd as I said before, on -- this particular type\nof inspected vessel is a -- is an inland drilling barge,\nand on this barge there -- the statutory authority doesn't\ngive the Coast Guard authority to require fire\nextinguishers or -- or those kind of things, and it gives\nthe Coast Guard no authority over the hazards from oil and\ngas drilling, which are the hazards involved in this -- in\nthis case.\nQUESTION: But some -- some uninspected are more\nclosely watched?\nMR. ROBERTS: Some uninspected are more closely\nwatched, and we -- we would submit that no uninspected\nvessel is comprehensively watched as to occupational\nsafety and health.\nBut that -- the Court doesn't need to -- to get\ninto that to -- to resolve this case. All -- all we're\nasking here is that the Court reject the holding of the\nFifth Circuit, which is that there's an industry-wide\nexemption for all seamen on all vessels from the\nOccupational Safety and Health Act, even in situations\nwhere the Coast Guard has not regulated the particular\nworking conditions on that vessel and the particular\nworking conditions that result in the occupational and\nsafety and health citation in the -- in that case.\nQUESTION: How could one know that this is a\nlittle-inspected vessel, as -- as distinguished from\nuninspected but more inspected?\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, there are different types of\n-- of uninspected vessels, and the -- depending on the\ntype, different sets of regulations apply to them. And\nthe vessel operators are well aware of what regulations\napply to them.\nBut -- but on all uninspected vessels, it\ndoesn't really matter whether it's little or more, because\nthe way the statutory scheme works is that the Coast Guard\nregulations that govern them apply to them. And the OSHA\nstandards apply to the extent that the working conditions\nare not covered by Coast Guard regulations. And that\ncomes from the -- the language of section 4(b)(1) of the\nOSH Act, which makes clear that displacement of the act is\nlimited to those working conditions with respect to which\nother agencies exercise authority to prescribe or enforce\noccupational safety and health standards. That -\nQUESTION: Now, Mr. Roberts, it seemed to me\nhere the administrative law judge seemed to say that the\nOSHA regulations were not preempted because the Coast\nGuard didn't require precisely the same thing that OSHA\ndid. And I would have thought it was a much more general\nproposition, that if the Coast Guard adopted some general\nregulations in this area, that's enough, and that you\nwouldn't look to see how closely OSHA's regs matched in\nevery detail the Coast Guard regs. What is the\nGovernment's view?\nMR. ROBERTS: The Government's view is that you\ndon't look to see if there's precisely the same regulation\nin precisely the same manner of the same -- the same\ndegree of stringency. You look to see whether the -\nwhether there is a regulation on the part of the Coast\nGuard that addresses the same working conditions, the same\nhazards that are involved. And if there are, then no\nmatter whether that's more stringent, less stringent, or\ngoes about it in a different way, it's displaced. But\nhere there's no regulation that addresses this hazard -\nQUESTION: Apparently both the Coast Guard and\nOSHA agree here.\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes, they agree. And the\nagencies, not only the Coast Guard and OSHA, but other\nagencies where this comes up, are -- have been in\nagreement. These kinds of disputes about coverage haven't\narisen because the agencies have been disputing about what\n-- when it applies and when it doesn't and what working\nconditions are covered by their different regulations.\nThey've arisen when employers have asserted that the OSH\nAct doesn't apply so that nobody -- there would be no\nregulations covering -\nQUESTION: How much of a dispute would survive\nthe Solicitor General's review of the two agencies'\ndecision?\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, we didn't -- we didn't need\nto resolve any dispute because there's been a longstanding\nunderstanding between the two agencies, based on the\nlanguage of the OSH Act, as to how the -- how the two -\nthe authority of each agency interacts with the other.\nQUESTION: If I can go back to inspected vessels\njust for 1 minute. I thought the answer you would give me\nto the question about, you know, the kitchen knives would\nbe just what you told Justice O'Connor now with reference\nto the uninspected vessels, that we look to see if the\nworking condition is regulated. Or maybe I just\nmisunderstood your answer. Was your answer to the effect\nthat on inspected vessels, generally, all working\nconditions are regulated, or at least they've been looked\nat and there's been a decision not to regulate and that's\nsufficient to displace OSHA?\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes. Yes, Your Honor. It's the\nsame -\nQUESTION: That's the best understanding -\nMR. ROBERTS: My answer was intended to say the\nsame thing, that at bottom, the same test applies whether\nthe particular working conditions have been addressed, but\nwith respect to inspected vessels, the working conditions\nhave been addressed comprehensively by the Coast Guard\nthrough specific regulations and through general\nregulations. And so, there aren't -- there aren't any\ngaps where workers would be unprotected that the OSH Act\nwould need to -- to step in.\nBut on uninspected vessels, the -- the situation\nis quite -- quite the reverse and almost the polar\nopposite where there aren't just little gaps, but there\nare potentially whole vessels that are almost completely\nunregulated with respect to occupational safety and\nhealth.\nSo, the industry-wide exemption that the Fifth\nCircuit has crafted here would, as a result, leave many\nworkers unprotected from many hazardous conditions and -\nand really frustrate the express purpose of the act which\nis to assure, insofar as possible that every working man\nand woman in the Nation has safe and healthful working\nconditions.\nAnd moreover, to -- even if there was any\nambiguity about how the statutory scheme should work, from\nlooking at its text and from looking at the -- and from\nthe fundamental purpose of the act, the Secretary has\ninterpreted the act this way for 30 years. It's been the\nSecretary's longstanding and consisted view. It's\nreflected in citations over those 30 years and regulations\nthat the Secretary promulgated in 1972 in a statutorily\nmandated report to Congress on coordination between the\nOSH Act and other laws that the Secretary submitted in\n1980. And the Secretary's view would be -- would be\nentitled to deference.\nQUESTION: That -- that view is also expressed\nin the -- in the joint agreement.\nWhat -- could you tell me -- I should know this,\nbut I just don't -- how was the joint agreement\npromulgated, if it was? Or is it simply just a private\nmemorandum of understanding exchanged between the two\nagencies?\nMR. ROBERTS: It was published in the -- in the\nFederal Register at -- at the time that it was -- it was\nentered into, Your Honor.\nTo -- to -- without -- without belaboring the\npoint, turning to the facts that are here briefly, the\nrespondent does not dispute that the Coast Guard hasn't\naddressed the particular hazards involved here. And as I\nsaid before, the only regulations that respondent and\namici have -- have pointed to that address the working\nconditions here are -- are very limited, those addressing\nthe marine sanitation devices, and there is in fact almost\nno regulation here, so that under any understanding of the\nterm working conditions, any reasonable understanding of\nwhat working conditions is under the statute, the Coast\nGuard hasn't exercised authority over the working\nconditions here.\nQUESTION: I take it the reason you say we don't\nhave to get into the distinction between the -- the hazard\nview and the area view is that the area view has been\ninterpreted, I think as you put it, narrowly to take into\nconsideration the particular area in which the particular\nhazard occurs. Is that about -\nMR. ROBERTS: That's -- that's one -- one\nreason. If -- if the area view was interpreted broadly,\nit would, in effect, completely eviscerate -\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. ROBERTS: -- the act because it would mean\nthat the regulations of the toilets preempt the -- any\nregulation of the vessel and expose all those -- all the\nhazards that might exist on the vessel would not be\nsubject to -- to regulation. So, it has been interpreted\nnarrowly.\nQUESTION: I -- I guess my only question is,\ngiven that narrow interpretation, I wonder if there is all\nthat much difference between the hazard view and the -\nand the area view as it has been -- been stated.\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, I -- I think that -- that\nthere is the potential for -- for different results to\narise between the two views, even with the -- the narrow\ninterpretation of -- of the area view because the area is\nidentified, say, as the -- the atmosphere on the boat.\nThe atmosphere might be regulated by the Coast Guard with\nrespect to particular injuries that -- that might be\ncaused by problems in the atmosphere like explosion, which\nit isn't here, but assume that it were. Yet, it wouldn't\nbe regulated for -- for other problems that might result\nfrom that like respiratory problems, particles that would\nbe in the atmosphere that would get into the -- the\nworkers' lungs.\nQUESTION: Are you saying that the regulations\njust have to be an exact -- if the regulation is not an\nexact duplicate of what OSHA would do, it isn't covered?\nMR. ROBERTS: No, Your Honor. Not that it -\nthat it has to be an exact duplicate, but that it has to\naddress the same injury, the same kind of injury from the\nsame source in essence.\nQUESTION: So, if you regulate smoke -- if the\nCoast Guard regulates smoke because of some reasons but\ndoesn't address the particulates in the smoke, OSHA could\ncome in and have a regulation for smoke coming out of the\nvessel?\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes, if -- if the Coast Guard's\nregulation didn't address the injury -- the particular\ninjury that would result from the smoke, that the -- that\nthe OSHA regulation was trying to --\nQUESTION: Well, what if the -\nMR. ROBERTS: -- to get at.\nQUESTION: -- Coast Guard regulations said that\nwe're going to regulate this aspect of smoke. Insofar as\nparticulates are concerned, we think seamen are -- can\ntake particulates.\nMR. ROBERTS: If the Coast Guard had made that\ndetermination and expressly concluded that a regulation of\nthat was not warranted, then that would be an exercise of\nits authority over -- over that working condition and the\nOSH Act would be displaced. But there's no -- no\ncontention that -- that that is what happened here, and\nthere couldn't be because the Coast Guard doesn't even\nhave authority to regulate the hazards that are involved\n-- involved here, Your Honor.\nIf there are no further questions, I'll reserve\nthe remainder of my time for rebuttal.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Roberts.\nMr. Veters, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICK J. VETERS\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. VETERS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThe Coast Guard has absolute authority to\nregulate uninspected vessels, as well inspected vessels,\nand there's not one iota of difference between the two.\nJustice O'Connor, if I could go to your question\nearlier, you're absolutely correct. The ALJ in this case\nsaid that we did not -- the Coast Guard did not have a\nstatute that mirrored the language of -- of the OSH Act.\nAs a result thereof, she concluded that the act was\ndisplaced.\nQUESTION: Yes. It sounds like the ALJ's\ndescription was probably -- didn't get it quite right, and\nI take it that your opposing counsel here concedes as\nmuch.\nMR. VETERS: I would hope so, Your Honor.\nAnd, Your Honor, to get right to the point, with\nall due respect to counsel, the Coast Guard has absolutely\nregulated emergency response. 46 C.F.R. 26. Operators of\ninspected vessels must prepare and post an emergency\ncheckoff list.\nQUESTION: Now, where are you -- you're reading\nfrom a Coast Guard regulation?\nMR. VETERS: Yes, sir, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Where -- where will we find it in the\npapers?\nMR. VETERS: We'll find that on page 13 of the\namicus brief on behalf of the AWO, Your Honor.\nThey had -- they require an -- quote, an\nemergency checkoff list.\nQUESTION: Now, is this for uninspected vessels?\nMR. VETERS: For uninspected vessels, Your\nHonor, operators of uninspected vessels covering\nemergencies, including rough weather, crossing hazardous\nbars, man overboard, as well as fire at sea. We have a\nparallel regulation. It doesn't read verbatim as the OSH\nAct, but clearly it has been addressed.\nBut to go back to Justice O'Connor's question,\nthat is not even required by the Coast Guard for\npreemption purposes. The Coast Guard has a statute -- the\nOSH Act, 4(b)(1) reads that it will not apply to working\nconditions that are -- so long as the other Federal agency\nexercises statutory authority. The Coast Guard has\nexercised statutory authority. It's not a question of\ndegrees in the statute. It's not light exercise, moderate\nexercise, or heavy exercise. It's once there has been\nexercise by a Federal agency such as the Coast Guard, the\nOSH Act is displaced.\nQUESTION: Well, there's a difference between\nhaving statutory authority and discretion to exercise it.\nAnd the Coast Guard may have statutory authority which it\nchooses not to exercise. But on -- to the extent that I\nunderstand, your argument is if the Coast Guard has\nauthority and exercises it to any extent, then that's\npreempted. Is that -- do I understand that?\nMR. VETERS: That's -- that's fairly correct,\nYour Honor.\nAnd -- and the only question -- the Government\nis mischaracterizing the extent of regulation in this\ncase. You cannot tell -- in this case, the Coast Guard -\nthere is no gap in coverage for -- for worker safety. The\nCoast Guard stepped in and investigated a serious marine\naccident pursuant to 46 U.S.C. 63. We had multiple\ndeaths. We had multiple injuries. We had property damage\nin excess of $100,000. Three Coast Guard investigators\ncame out over a 6-month period. They got control of this\nwell, of this blowout situation, and they exercised their\nauthority.\nQUESTION: But let's take a -- perhaps a\npractical example in response to Justice Ginsburg's\nquestion. Supposing all the Coast Guard had regulated\nhere was marine toilets: don't dump your toilets into the\nnavigable water. Would you say that OSHA could not do\nanything then?\nMR. VETERS: I would say that's an extreme\nexample, Your Honor. But, yes -\nQUESTION: Those are the -- the kinds of\nexamples that perhaps focus your attention.\nMR. VETERS: Your Honor, yes. I would say that\nthere has been an exercise of authority, and if -- if OSHA\nhas a complaint, it is not properly directed to the Court.\nIt's properly directed to Congress to have the Coast Guard\npromulgate regulations that address the needs of the\nseamen. That's the proper complaint. It's not for this\nCourt to step in and give OSHA -- carve out exception\nafter exception where there are no express regulations.\nIf I may refer to Justice Kennedy's question,\nhe's -- you're absolutely correct. OSHA gets -- OSHA gets\ntheir jurisdiction in this case from a memorandum of\nunderstanding, a peace treaty, an informal memorandum that\nis not a delegation of law. That memorandum says, Your\nHonor -- it says -- the memorandum of understanding says\nnothing in this MOU pertains to uninspected vessels.\nThat's what it says. That does not disclaim Coast Guard\nregulation of inspected vessels, nor does it cede to the\nGovernment jurisdiction over uninspected vessels.\nYour example about the kitchen knife is\nabsolutely correct. The Government has come in and said\nif the Coast Guard does not have an express provision -\nin this case, we did not have an express provision\nregarding the working conditions of the presence of\nnatural gas in the atmosphere of an inland drilling barge\n-- there's no such creature. If -- if the Coast Guard\ndoes not have that or if the Coast Guard does not\narticulate a policy that they will not regulate the\npresence of natural gas in the atmosphere of an inland\ndrilling barge, then OSHA can step in and regulate that.\nOSHA can step -\nQUESTION: Well, but it seems to me to that that\nargument -- that position of the Government is just\nconsistent with the statute because the -- the statute\napplies to working conditions.\nMR. VETERS: Correct.\nQUESTION: And I -- I would be surprised if the\nCoast Guard had regulations on -- on drilling barges that\nrelated to -- to blowout preventers, mud cavity\ndepressors, chemical mixturing material for mud, drilling\nbits. That's -- that's OSHA stuff not Coast Guard stuff.\nMR. VETERS: Well, Your Honor, they -- what the\nCoast Guard has is broad, general authority according to\n14 U.S.C. 2, and they can board an uninspected vessel.\nThey can inspect -- they can investigate any uninspected\nvessel on the navigable waters of the United States. They\ncan seize it partially or seize it fully. They can take\nan uninspected barge out of service if it poses a danger\nor threat to property or persons. It can even sink an\nuninspected barge if it's a threat to property or -- or\nlife.\nWith that being said, the Coast Guard does not\nhave to -- to have every minute regulation that tailors\nthat of the OSH Act to -- to assert their authority in\nthis case.\nQUESTION: Well, but they said -- the Government\nsaid, for example, in respect to the -- the regulations\nthat you cited having to do with safety on page 13 -\nMR. VETERS: Yes, sir.\nQUESTION: -- where they said that part 27,\nwhich is what you were quoting from, applies only to\ntowing vessels, that it didn't apply to barges. So,\nthat's what they said in their reply brief. And you're\ndealing with a barge. So, when we look through this, it\nseemed to me that their claim -- and I'd ask you if that\nisn't right -- that -- that the only -- the only Coast\nGuard things that seem to apply at all to the barges, an\nuninspected barge, had to do with fire extinguishers, life\npreservers, ventilation for tanks and engines, and also a\ngeneral requirement that when there's an accident, they\nlook into it to see if a law has been violated.\nMR. VETERS: I would disagree.\nQUESTION: Is that right? Which are the ones,\nin addition to those that do apply?\nMR. VETERS: Those do apply under the subchapter\nC uninspected vessels. But we submit, Your Honor, 46\nC.F.R. 24, 25, and 26 apply to all uninspected vessels.\nAnd not only that, Your Honor, the important\nthing is there are many regulations that apply to both\nuninspected vessels -\nQUESTION: Well, I'm just saying which ones\napply -\nMR. VETERS: Which ones.\nQUESTION: -- other than the ones I listed.\nMR. VETERS: Your Honor -\nQUESTION: I mean, you know, they go through\nthis in a big appendix, and -- and are they wrong in their\nappendix?\nMR. VETERS: Yes, I think they're reading -\nQUESTION: Which -- which part of the appendix\nis wrong?\nMR. VETERS: I think they're reading the -- the\nstatutes too narrowly, Your Honor. I would submit 33\nC.F.R., part 160. It's -- that governs ports and\nwaterways safety. It applies to all vessels. That -\nunder that statute, inspected as well as uninspected, the\nCoast Guard can deny entry to a port. It can seize a\nvessel that it feels is operating unsafely. It can tell\nthe operator of that vessel how to operate that vessel.\nIt can take that vessel out of service. It doesn't -- it\ndoesn't come under the subchapter of uninspected vessels,\nyet the authority is very broad. It's just like the -\nthe drug testing of people that have accidents, Your\nHonor. Any -\nQUESTION: Okay, 160. Is there any other one\nthat you think that they're wrong about?\nMR. VETERS: Yes. I think the COLLREGS, Your\nHonor. The -- the -\nQUESTION: Well, you better tell me the -- I\nmean, you know, I'm just checking them and I'll look up\nlater.\nMR. VETERS: Okay. Your Honor, I don't have the\n-- the COLLREGS, what we call the rules of the road, but\nit's the navigational rules that apply to vessels as well\nas uninspected vessels. Clearly, there are rules that\napply to both species. These -- these regulations are\ndesigned to prevent collisions and to prevent accidents\nand injuries to seamen. They -- that's another example of\nrules articulated that are -- that govern the working\nconditions -\nQUESTION: What I'm getting at is that they -\nlet's say a few minimal applications -- applied to the\nBelden, all right, which is, I take it, your -- your\nbarge, to Mr. Belden.\nMR. VETERS: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And they have a big appendix designed\nto show that. And if their appendix is right, they're\nright. So, I want to check the ones that you disagree\nwith about that appendix, so I can go back and look them\nup. What I've looked up so far, I've checked section 160.\nI'll go look that up.\nIs there any other thing I should check?\nMR. VETERS: Your Honor, I don't have their\nappendix in front of me, but yes, I would go -- we have -\nwe have a list of regulations that we've -- we've applied\nto -\nQUESTION: I know and they went through those,\nand they went and said that every one of those that you\nsay, by and large, don't apply with certain exceptions.\nSo, I'm just going to make my work a little easier -\nMR. VETERS: Oh, I understand, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: -- to find out what I do have to look\nup and what I don't.\nMR. VETERS: Your Honor, we would -- we would\nsubmit that, yes, the ones we talk about 33 C.F.R., part\n160 clearly applies. We believe 46 C.F.R. 24, part 24,\npart 25, part 26 apply. We believe the rules of the road,\nthe COLLREG, related to navigation apply. We believe the\n-- the regulations concerning drug and alcohol testing, 46\nC.F.R., part -- part 16 -- they apply. We believe 33\nC.F.R., part 155; 33 C.F.R., part 81, navigation lights.\nWhen this vessel is towed -- it's a non-self-propelled\nbarge -- when it's towed out to location, Your Honor, it\nhas to have certain navigation lights. These are all\napplication of specific regulations.\nQUESTION: But I don't know what that has to do\nwith the complexity of a -- of a well drilling operation.\nIt's just night and day. There are separate working\nconditions that prevail to oil field operations that -\nMR. VETERS: Your Honor, I think it does go back\nthat -- that this is actual exercise of authority by the\nCoast Guard.\nQUESTION: But -- but this applies to working\nconditions that -- that I've just mentioned. The statute\nsays, with respect to working conditions.\nMR. VETERS: Your Honor, we think the working\nconditions -- I believe Justice Souter mentioned it -- is\nclearly the working conditions on the barge itself. I\ndon't think you have to regulate -- the thousands of\npotential working conditions that could be regulated\ncannot be addressed in minute detail. This Court\nrecognized 60 years ago in Southern Steamship -\nQUESTION: Well, that -- that's OSHA's problem.\nMR. VETERS: Your Honor, I guess we haven't\ndiscussed is the relationship of master to seaman is\nentirely different from that of employer to employee.\nQUESTION: But before you get into that, I -- I\njust want to touch base on one thing. Your -- your\nargument -- your response to Justice Kennedy, as I\nunderstand it, depends on the point that you made in\nresponse to the Chief Justice's question. If they are\nregulating marine toilets, then they are regulating for\npurposes of -- of excluding OSHA jurisdiction. If they're\nregulating in -- in a later example that you used, running\nlights when the barge is being towed, then they're\nregulating to the exclusion of OSHA. Period. I mean,\nthat's -- that's the essence of your argument, and as I\nunderstand it, in response to Justice Kennedy, just as -\nas in response to the Chief. Am I right?\nMR. VETERS: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. VETERS: They have -- they possess statutory\nauthority to regulate and they have exercised that\nauthority. And they've emphasized it in a general way,\nmaybe not in the same exact way OSHA does, maybe not as\naggressively, but the preemption cases from this Court say\nthat once there's been an exercise of statutory authority,\nwe don't look at the quality of the regulations, we don't\nlook at the consistency or the extent.\nQUESTION: No, counsel, but isn't it true that\nwhat it really boils down to is whether rules of the road\nor navigation lights are regulations of working\nconditions?\nMR. VETERS: I believe so, Your Honor. If you\nwork on a semi-submersible drilling rig and you're being\ntowed at night and having the presence of navigation\nlights is to protect you from injury from a colliding\nvessel, I believe that does -- that goes to health and\nsafety of those seamen on that vessel. I think it clearly\ndoes. I don't think you can take very specific, you know,\nregulations -- the working environment out -- out at sea\nis very much different than it is at the, you know,\nmanufacturing facility in New Jersey. It's two different\nkind of -- two different types of animals.\nAnd that's why this Court has always considered\nseamen to be wards of the Court. That's why they enacted\nthe Jones Act for their protection, the -- the warranty of\nunseaworthiness. Seamen have been treated differently for\nas long as -\nQUESTION: But your client isn't a seaman. It's\nan employer.\nMR. VETERS: It's an employer of seamen, Your\nHonor.\nAnd one -- one thing we haven't addressed also,\nYour Honor, I think the Fifth Circuit, which I would\nsubmit is the preeminent admiralty circuit court at least\nin this -- in this country, has -- has hit the nail on the\nhead. Adopting the definition of working conditions\nespoused by the Government would create an absolute\ndisastrous and unworkable concept. I do not think\nCongress in its wisdom could have ever intended that a\nbarge within 3 miles is subject to -- to OSHA\njurisdiction. As it leaves the 3-mile area, now it's not\nsubject to OSHA jurisdiction, and in -- within 3 miles and\noutside 3 miles, it is still subject to the jurisdiction\nof the United States Coast Guard.\nQUESTION: Mr. Veters, that might have been a\nmore persuasive argument if we didn't have 30 years of\nexperience with this understanding between the -- the two\nagencies. So, what you describe as unworkable has\napparently worked for some 30 years and it's open and\nnotorious. Congress hasn't stepped in to say, agencies,\nyou've got it wrong.\nMR. VETERS: No, Your Honor. I believe that the\nMOU is important. In this case, the -- the OSHA inspector\n-- it's in the trial transcript -- who testified, where\ndid you get your jurisdiction in this case? He said, I\nlooked at the memorandum of understanding and I came to\nthe conclusion I had jurisdiction.\nThe Fifth Circuit is correct. 14 U.S.C. 2, the\nenabling statute of the Coast Guard, says it covers all\nmatters not delegated by law specifically to some of the\nFederal agencies. Two Federal agencies cannot\ncontravene -\nQUESTION: You're now addressing a different\nquestion, whether there's any statutory authority for this\narrangement. You're not addressing the question I asked\nyou.\nMR. VETERS: I'm sorry, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Where is this massive confusion if\nfor 30 years this has been in place and at least the\nagencies are telling us that -- that it's working okay?\nMR. VETERS: Your Honor, there's no confusion in\nthe Fifth Circuit because the Fifth Circuit in the Clary\ncases and the Donovan cases says with respect to the\nworking conditions of seamen, the OSH Act doesn't apply.\nPeriod. The confusion is in the Ninth Circuit. The\nconfusion is in the Eleventh Circuit when you have OSHA\nstandards being applied to seamen. And, Your Honor -\nQUESTION: I thought you said -- I thought you\nsaid that it confused it. You could not have these two\nagencies -- that there would be pandemonium out there by\nthe people who are regulated.\nMR. VETERS: That's correct.\nQUESTION: And the Government is telling us\nthat's not so. It's been that way for 30 years, and even\nthe Clary case is what? 1980?\nMR. VETERS: Yes, 1980.\nQUESTION: The Government said, well, as they\nread it, that just goes to -- it wasn't clear that it\nwasn't an inspected vessel.\nMR. VETERS: No. The Fifth Circuit had handled\nthat, Your Honor, and said it was a special purpose\ndrilling barge similar to the Mr. Belden. And -- and the\nFifth Circuit was right. It didn't matter if it was\ninspected or it wasn't inspected.\nBut, Your Honor, I would submit the Fifth\nCircuit is correct. If you let two agencies regulate the\nworking conditions of seamen and have OSHA come in with a\nnook and cranny theory and fill in gaps every place\nthere's not a Coast Guard regulation, outside of the Fifth\nCircuit of the United States, you will have absolute\nconfusion. You will have redundancy.\nQUESTION: -- you've had it for 30 years outside\nthe Fifth Circuit, and there hasn't apparently been this\nmassive confusion. Is the Government dissembling when it\ntells us that there hasn't been such confusion?\nMR. VETERS: Your Honor, I think that we have\nthree amicus briefs that were filed. We have the American\nWaterways Operators and two other entities I think\nstrongly urging this Court to adopt the position we're\nespousing for the very reason that they anticipate that,\nyes, that there will be confusion if there's two sets of\nregulations. Marine operators have to know who to look\nto -\nQUESTION: Well, why should it be anticipate\nsince this has been going on so long?\nMR. VETERS: Your Honor, I would submit that\nthere is -- there has been confusion on this issue. I -\nI would submit to you that where the OSH Act has -- has\nsupplanted or overreached into the area of the Coast\nGuard, there has been confusion. But there has not been\nconfusion in the Fifth Circuit, where we have the\nMississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico, because marine\noperators know what the law is and they've been able to\napply that.\nQUESTION: What about a -- a kind of contrary\nparade of horribles to yours if -- if we were to accept\nthe Fifth Circuit view, and that is assuming that the\nCoast Guard regulates running lights and marine sanitation\ndevices, as they were called, and things like that and\ndoes nothing more, and it does nothing more than it\npurports to do right now? There's an enormous gap in -\nin safety coverage for a whole class of workers. It seems\nto me very odd that Congress, in writing the -- the\nstatute that we're dealing with, would have intended such\na kind of a huge gap in safety coverage. What's your\nresponse to that?\nMR. VETERS: Your Honor, I do not believe there\nis a huge gap. They -- as I had mentioned earlier -\nQUESTION: Well, if they -- on your theory, if\nthey -- if the Coast Guard regulates running lights, OSHA\ncan do absolutely nothing about blowouts like this, and\nthat seems to me a pretty big gap.\nMR. VETERS: Your Honor, the -- the Coast Guard\nhas the absolute authority, statutory authority, to board,\ninspect, investigate any vessel they choose randomly at\nwill, whatever they want to do, and to seize that vessel,\nto control it -\nQUESTION: If that were -- if that were -- I\nmean, if that were the answer to my problem, I would have\nexpected Congress to tell the Coast Guard not only that it\nmay regulate, but that it must. I would have expected\nsome statute that would in -- in effect, have -- have\nrequired or have extended as a matter of law Coast Guard\nregulation regardless of the Coast Guard's discretion.\nBut we have nothing like that.\nWhat we have, on your theory, is regulation of\nrunning lights by the Coast Guard means safety in blowout\nsituations is not covered by anything. And -- and that's\nwhat I find it difficult to believe that Congress could\nhave intended.\nMR. VETERS: Your Honor, what -- I go back to\nwhat I said earlier. Under 14 U.S.C. 2, the Coast Guard\nhas been charged with the responsibility of safety and\nlife at sea. If they are not doing their job, if they\nneed to have more regulations, then yes, that is a\nquestion properly addressed to the Congress, not to this\nCourt. I respectfully submit that. Then they have to go\nto Congress and say, we need more regulations in this\narea. You need to do that. Under the marine -\nQUESTION: Congress apparently has -- has not\nbeen -- been particularly concerned about the -- the\nSecretary's interpretation of this statute and the -- to\nthe effect of the -- OSHA jurisdiction. And I gather that\nhas been a -- a subject of -- of published standards for\nwhat? 15 years, 25 years now?\nMR. VETERS: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: So, if -- if you say, well, if\nCongress doesn't like it, Congress can do something about\nit, Congress could do something about the -- the\nadministrative position and it hasn't done anything about\nit, which suggests that that's a -- a good reason behind\nthe rule of deference.\nMR. VETERS: Your Honor, the rule of deference\nonly applies if the -- it is consistent with the intent of\nCongress and the statute is unambiguous in its intention.\nI believe 14 -\nQUESTION: And you say this is an unambiguous\nstatute despite the -- the presence of the word exercise\nthere?\nMR. VETERS: I do, Your Honor. I think the\nenabling act says, covering all matters not specifically\ndelegated by law to some other Federal agencies. It was\nenacted in 1915. There's been no specific delegation by\nlaw to OSHA, and OSHA has assumed jurisdiction, so to\nspeak, of uninspected barges through a private treaty,\ninformal agreement between them and the Coast Guard. That\nis improper.\nThe Fifth Circuit has said Federal modalities\nmay not shift and exchange responsibilities between\nthemselves. If they want to go to Congress and they want\nto carve out an exemption for uninspected vessels in State\nterritorial waters, they can do that. The Congress can\nenact that, and I have no complaints. But that cannot be\nsomething done between agencies among themselves, Your\nHonor. And this -\nQUESTION: The antitrust division and the FTC do\nit all the time.\nMR. VETERS: Your Honor, I can't speak -\nQUESTION: Is that illegal too?\nMR. VETERS: I'm not an antitrust lawyer, Your\nHonor, about which I could -- I could speak to that.\nQUESTION: I mean, I just wondered how general\nstatement was. You mean in this instance they can't do\nit.\nMR. VETERS: No.\nYour Honor, if I could go back to what Justice\nKennedy had said earlier, though, about the kitchen\nknives, I think he's absolutely correct. The theory\nespoused by the Government, if there is not an express\nregulation for inspected vessels, inspected vessels being\n900-foot passenger vessels, Your Honor, if there is -- if\nthere is not a Coast Guard regulation that -- that\nspecifically addresses kitchen knives, then under the\ntheory espoused by the Government, OSHA can absolutely\nstep in and regulate -\nQUESTION: Well, that's why I wondered maybe it\nhas to do how comprehensive the regulation was, and that's\nwhat I was interested in.\nMR. VETERS: Your Honor, they've just chosen -\nOSHA has chosen not to regulate inspected vessels pursuant\nto a memorandum of understanding, but it does not -- it\ndoesn't change the statutory scheme one bit.\nQUESTION: Well, the word is exercise. The word\nis exercise in the statute.\nMR. VETERS: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: So, if they decide not to exercise\ntheir authority, then I guess they're not exercising it.\nMR. VETERS: You're right, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: If they're not exercising it, they're\nnot. Then the Coast Guard can come in. I mean, that's\nwhat the statute says.\nMR. VETERS: But, Your Honor, the statute\ndoesn't say comprehensive, pervasive exercise; it says\nexercise. And I think we give its plain meaning. And -\nand if there's been an exercise of authority by one\nFederal agency, I think it will create confusion, I think\nit will create redundancy, and it will create a\nproliferation of regulations that are not needed.\nQUESTION: So, if the Coast Guard didn't\nregulate the toilets, then OSHA could regulate it.\nMR. VETERS: According to OSHA, Your Honor,\nthat's correct. But we say -\nQUESTION: What about you? I mean, you -- you\nhave said if they exercise any authority, that's it. It's\ntotally preemptive of what the regulate and what they\ndon't regulate. Suppose they don't exercise any authority\nat all. Would this be just a no regulation plan?\nMR. VETERS: If there were no express -\nQUESTION: If the Coast Guard didn't regulate\nanything on this particular class of uninspected vessels,\nthen would there be authority in the Occupational Safety\nand Health -\nMR. VETERS: If there was just the mere\npossession of authority without the exercise, I would\nargue, Your Honor, that they still -- the Coast Guard\nstill has been charged with their responsibility and they\nstill would have that responsibility. They just were not\ndoing their job. But in this case, they have -\nQUESTION: But you don't -- you don't put\nanything -- I misunderstood your argument before. I\nthought you said if they exercise any authority, then\neverything is preempted.\nMR. VETERS: Yes, Your Honor -\nQUESTION: So, if they didn't choose to exercise\nany authority, that OSHA could -- could regulate. But now\nyou're saying there is no authority at all with respect to\nthese uninspected vessels in any agency other than the\nCoast Guard. Is that what you're saying?\nMR. VETERS: That's correct, Your Honor. I'm\nsaying that the Coast Guard has absolute, exclusive\njurisdiction over uninspected vessels. They have the\nstatutory authority and they have exercised the statutory\nauthority through regulations.\nQUESTION: No, but -- as I understand your\ntheory now, it wouldn't matter even if they had not\nexercised it.\nMR. VETERS: Your Honor, I'd say -- I would\nagree with that. I'd say that even if they had the\npossession of authority given to them by Congress and they\nchoose, for whatever reason, not to exercise that, then\nthe complaint is still not properly before this Court.\nIt's properly with Congress as to why they're not doing\ntheir job and to ensure that they do it or to take the\njurisdiction away.\nBut that's not our case. If you just look at\nthe facts of this case, Your Honor, there was -- there -\nthere was no regulations regarding atmospheric presence of\nnatural gas. Yet, what did the Coast Guard do? They\nimmediately dispatched people to the scene. They took\ncontrol of the well. They prevented pollution. They\nsaved lives. They did a 6-month investigation. OSHA did\nnothing. OSHA came out to the site, turned around, never\n-- never interviewed a -- a crew member, never stepped\nfoot aboard the Mr. Belden, and received in the mail a\ncertified letter with respect to citations.\nThe Coast Guard did their job in this case, even\nthough there's not express regulations and provisions in\nminute detail, and they continue to do that for any -- any\nmarine accident or any serious marine accident that fits\nthe criteria of deaths, personal injuries, or property\ndamage. They do the job. There -- there is not this gap\nin coverage, Your Honor.\nIf there's a death on a vessel in navigable\nwaters or an injury, whether it be an uninspected vessel\nof whatever length or -- or something larger, the Coast\nGuard is charged with the responsibility to investigate.\nAnd the Marine Safety Manual says, when they\ninvestigate, one of the other things they must do is to -\nto look at existing regulations to determine if there is a\nneed for a change in the regulations, to supplement the\nregulations, or to leave them as they are because they\nhave the expertise. They've been doing this since 1915,\nsince the Department of Transportation enabled them and\nempowered them to do their job. They have the special\nexpertise in this area.\nIf there are no further questions, Your Honor,\nI -\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Veters.\nMR. VETERS: Thank you very much.\nQUESTION: Mr. Roberts, you have 11 minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. ROBERTS: With the exception of part 160,\nwhich doesn't regulate occupational safety and health,\nnone of the regulations identified by respondent applied\nto the Mr. Belden as is explained in the -- in the\nappendix in our reply brief.\nJust to -- just to briefly mention part 26,\nwhich he started about the emergency checkoff list, that\nspecifically applies to small passenger vessels based on\nspecific authority given to the Coast Guard to regulate\nsmall passenger vessels in more detail. Many of the\nothers deal with navigational issues like running lights,\nhave nothing to do with regulation of occupational safety\nand health. None regulates the hazards from oil and gas\ndrilling.\nSection 14 U.S.C. 2 on which respondent relies,\nfirst of all, as Justice Ginsburg points out, that only\ngoes to the existence of authority, not to the exercise of\nit, and the statute is very clear that -- that the other\nagency must exercise authority to displace the OSH Act.\nQUESTION: What do you say about his argument\nthat, yes, oh, that may be true in writing, but in fact\nthe people who did investigate this accident was the Coast\nGuard?\nMR. ROBERTS: The Coast Guard has -- has\nresponsibility for investigating marine accidents.\nInvestigative authority doesn't necessarily imply that you\nhave regulatory authority as the National Transportation\nSafety Board is an illustration of. Congress wanted the\nCoast Guard to -- to investigate. It does. If it finds\nviolations, finds situations that indicate violations of\nother agency laws, it coordinates with those agencies, as\nit did here, and those agencies take appropriate\nenforcement action. The authority to investigate\naccidents after they happen, even if they might have been\ncaused by unsafe working conditions, is not regulation of\nthose working conditions, and it doesn't preempt the -\npreempt the OSH Act.\nQUESTION: Mr. Roberts, how far can a memorandum\nof understanding go? Supposing two agencies, just the two\nSecretaries or whoever is representing, sit down and say,\nlet's -- let's just divide up this area -- there can be\nsome conflict -- and just sign a very simple understanding\nthat, you know, you regulate A and I'll regulate B. How\nmuch authority should a court give to that?\nMR. ROBERTS: The -- the question of who has\nauthority here is governed by section 4(b)(1) of the OSH\nAct, not by some agreement between the -- Coast Guard and\nOSHA. That agreement reflects the Coast Guard's\nregulations and the interpretation of the OSH Act that the\nSecretary -\nQUESTION: So, you don't -- you don't rely on\nthe memorandum as any independent basis for a ruling -\nMR. ROBERTS: None whatsoever, Your Honor. We\nrely -- we rely on the text of -- of section 4(b)(1) which\nis -- is quite clear that it displaces the OSH Act with\nrespect to particular working conditions.\nThat's in stark contrast to the Fifth Circuit's\nholding here that there's an industry-wide exemption for\nall seamen on all vessels from the OSH Act. That's the\napproach that respondent endorses, admitting that\nregulation of the toilets would preempt regulation of the\nact altogether, and that you don't even need to regulate\nthat, that -- that the OSH Act simply doesn't apply\nbecause respondent mistakenly believes that the Coast\nGuard has authority, plenary authority, under section 2,\nwhen the Coast Guard has never interpreted section 2 to\ngive it plenary authority. And it's repeatedly gone back\nto Congress to get specific authority to address specific\nissues on particular uninspected vessels, and Congress has\ngiven the Coast Guard that authority, which indicates that\nneither Congress nor the Coast Guard thought section 2\ngave it that authority.\nThe -- the Secretary's view that the Coast Guard\nhas to regulate the particular working conditions at issue\nin order to displace the OSH Act is supported by the text.\nIt's supported by the purpose of the act. It's been the\nSecretary's longstanding view. It's been followed by all\nthe other circuits except for the Fifth Circuit. The\nSecond Circuit, the Ninth Circuit, the Eleventh Circuit,\nwith due respect to the maritime expertise in the Fifth\nCircuit, those circuits also have a great deal of maritime\n-- of maritime expertise.\nAnd the working conditions here, as Justice\nKennedy pointed out, are not maritime-specific. They're\nmatters over which OSHA has expertise, and 4(b)(1) allows\nthe Coast Guard to step in and displace the OSH Act when\nit has authority and when it believes that its expertise\nwarrants it to address the particular working conditions\nthat are at issue. The Coast Guard doesn't have authority\nhere. It hasn't exercised authority here, and the OSH Act\napplies here.\nQUESTION: Are there some drilling platforms on\nthe Outer Continental Shelf which are registered vessels\nand so are completely under the Coast Guard's jurisdiction\nas to drilling -\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes. A drilling vessel that went\nto the Outer Continental Shelf, in most cases, would be an\ninspected mobile oil drilling unit, which the Coast Guard\nhas comprehensive regulations covering. The Coast Guard\nalso has regulations specifically addressed to all\nfacilities at the Outer Continental Shelf which include a\ngeneral duty clause, similar to the OSHA general duty\nclause, that requires that work places there be free of -\nof recognized hazards.\nIn addition, the Interior Department has some\nregulatory authority out there specifically related to\nmineral drilling.\nQUESTION: On those vessels, if the Coast Guard\nchose, could it allow OSHA a specific regulation of a\nconcurrent -- sort of a concurrent jurisdiction?\nMR. ROBERTS: The -- it -- it could have if it\n-- if it hadn't exercised its comprehensive authority over\nthose vessels, but it has exercised its comprehensive\nauthority over those vessels, in contrast to the situation\nhere.\nIf there are no further questions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nRoberts.\n"
