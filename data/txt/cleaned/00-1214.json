PRYOR, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. PRYOR: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\n30 years ago in Argersinger v. Hamlin and then\nmore than 20 years ago in Scott v. Illinois, this Court\nestablished the principle that, under the Sixth and\nFourteenth Amendments, a State is not obligated to provide\nan indigent defendant in a misdemeanor case court-\nappointed and taxpayer-funded counsel, provided that the\ndefendant is not actually imprisoned upon conviction.\n8 years ago in Nichols v. the United States,\nthis Court reaffirmed that principle.\nThe Supreme Court of Alabama distorted this\nwell-established and workable rule and held that a\nprobated or suspended sentence, which actually liberates a\ndefendant to return to free society, nevertheless triggers\na right to court-appointed and taxpayer-funded counsel.\nThere are three arguments that I would like to\naddress this morning.\nQUESTION: Do you -- do you concede that the\nState can never impose the original sentence of time in\njail?\nMR. PRYOR: Your Honor, obviously that is not a\ncourt -- a question that this Court has directly addressed\nin either Argersinger or Scott. Our best reading --\nQUESTION: I'm asking whether the State of\nAlabama concedes that it can't ever impose that original\nsentence.\nMR. PRYOR: Our reading of Scott is that -- that\nwe cannot activate the suspended sentence. We acknowledge\nthat Mr. Fried, as an amicus, certainly has a plausible\nreading that would allow the court to activate that\nsentence. In our judgment, that original sentence relates\nback to the original offense and that the court --\nQUESTION: What -- what happens in Alabama if --\nif a -- a criminal defendant is convicted of a misdemeanor\nand placed on probation and then violates probation? Does\nthat enable the State to impose the original sentence for\nviolation of the probation?\nMR. PRYOR: Yes, ordinarily it would. But for\nthe problem presented involving an uncounseled defendant,\nit would allow the State to activate the suspended\nsentence.\nQUESTION: Well, then we're jumping probably\nahead into what you're going to tell us, but while we're\nat this point, it seems to me that if -- if you say that\nthe sentence cannot be reimposed, you're saying that the\nState courts are in the position of imposing a sentence\nthat is something of a rouse. Why should you put your own\ncourts in this position? I -- I just don't think it's\nvery sound for us to tell the State courts, well, you go\nahead and tell these people that they can -- might be put\nin prison, but that that won't really happen. It seems to\nme that that's your position.\nMR. PRYOR: Well, there's still a risk of\nimprisonment, the same risk of imprisonment, under our\nreading of Argersinger and Scott, that -- that is\naccompanied with the judgment of a mere fine. Every court\nhas the power to enforce any judgment as an essential\naspect of the administration of justice through the power\nof contempt.\nQUESTION: But you're -- you're treating the\ncontempt proceeding, in effect, as a separate proceeding\nthen, and I take it, though I'm not sure that I remember\nthis from your briefs -- I take it that on -- on your view\nof the way the scheme ought to operate in the contempt\nproceeding, before there could be any confinement on a\nfinding of contempt, that counsel would have to be\nprovided then if -- if the individual is indigent and\ndidn't waive it.\nMR. PRYOR: That's -- that's correct, Justice\nSouter.\nQUESTION: So, it's the separate counseled\nproceeding that distinguishes your case from -- from the\ncase that Mr. Fried argues for.\nMR. PRYOR: That -- that's correct, Justice\nSouter. And -- and at a minimum I would say, although I\ndon't think the Court has to ever address this question\nbecause there's been no violation of probation -- at a\nminimum the State would have the same power to enforce its\njudgment that it would a judgment of a mere fine which\nthis Court held squarely in Scott does not trigger a right\nto court-appointed --\nQUESTION: From your point of view, General\nPryor, what does the State gain as -- as opposed to what\nthe Supreme Court of Alabama said, by following --\nfollowing your -- your line of reasoning? I think as\nJustice Kennedy said, it -- it imposes a sentence, but a\nsentence that everybody knows can't be enforced.\nMR. PRYOR: The State gains the powerful tool of\nprobation to rehabilitate an offender that the State\nbelieves is a good risk, a risk to return to free society\nwho can be rehabilitated, depending on whatever mechanisms\nof probation have been adopted by the trial court.\nMeanwhile, the State is preserving its scarce judicial\nresources to incarcerate more dangerous offenders and\nprovide counsel in more serious cases.\nQUESTION: But what -- how effective is\nprobation going to be if there isn't the threat of -- of a\nsentence in case of probation violation?\nMR. PRYOR: I think at a minimum, the probation\nis going to be as effective as a judgment of a fine\nbecause the State is going to still have the flexible\npower of contempt, whether civil or criminal in nature, to\nensure that its orders are followed and -- and will\ncontinue to exercise jurisdiction of the probationer\nduring that period of probation.\nQUESTION: Is it the -- is it the case in\nAlabama that probation cannot be imposed without a\nsuspended sentence?\nMR. PRYOR: That is correct. Technically that\nis how probation is imposed, Justice Souter.\nQUESTION: Wouldn't -- wouldn't we have at least\na more candid system or wouldn't the interaction of\nArgersinger and -- and the Alabama system, as you view\nArgersinger, produce a more candid system if -- if we took\nthe position that, no, they can't impose a suspended\nsentence, and Alabama would then presumably amend its laws\nso that probation could be imposed without imposing a\nsuspended sentence, and you on your view would have your\n-- your contempt remedy. We wouldn't be -- in effect, the\n-- the two systems wouldn't be producing this kind of\nsilly effect of -- of a sentence which everyone realizes\nas such cannot be imposed.\nMR. PRYOR: Alabama certainly has the freedom to\nadopt I think either system without running afoul of the\nConstitution, which is the -- the issue before this Court.\nAlthough it might make more sense and not seem as silly to\nimpose probation without going through the mechanics of --\nQUESTION: Well, is -- is there any State which\nimposes probation without a suspended sentence that you\nknow of?\nMR. PRYOR: I know from the amicus brief of the\nNational Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers that\nthere are some States that impose, in fact, pretrial\nprobation, that that is something that --\nQUESTION: How about post-trial, after a\nconviction?\nMR. PRYOR: I just don't know. I know that\nthere were several States that were cited in Shelton's\nbriefly correctly that -- that used the same mechanism\nthat Alabama does. There were several cites --\nQUESTION: General Pryor --\nQUESTION: Well, what -- what authority would --\nwould the State have to -- to put somebody on probation\nunless -- unless it is the suspension of -- of a judgment\nof incarceration? I mean, can a State just go around\nsaying you're going to be on probation?\nMR. PRYOR: Well --\nQUESTION: It seems to me the only -- the only\nreason it -- it has that grip over the person is that --\nis that it has a right to incarcerate him.\nMR. PRYOR: The States certainly view that as an\neffective mechanism in most --\nQUESTION: I'm not sure there's an alternative\nto it. I'm not sure you can just pass a law saying judges\ncan put on probation whomever they want to put on\nprobation.\nMR. PRYOR: I think that -- that the Alabama\nlegislature has the inherent power to define what a\nsentence is, whether a sentence is a fine or whether a\nsentence is imprisonment. And in fact, I think the State\nwould have the flexibility to define a sentence -- one of\nthe sentencing options as -- as probation.\nQUESTION: I take it what they would do on that\nscheme would be to say, upon conviction of offense A, the\ncourt may impose probation, and if the conditions of\nprobation are violated and are shown in a separate trial\nor proceeding to that effect, the violation itself can be\npunished. That would be the way the scheme would work,\nwouldn't it?\nMR. PRYOR: That's correct.\nQUESTION: If -- if Alabama wanted it.\nMR. PRYOR: If Alabama wanted it. But -- but\nthis is really -- in my judgment this would be elevating\nform over substance because the -- the effect is the same\nwith whichever system Alabama wants to adopt --\nQUESTION: General Pryor, explain to me how some\nother States approach it. If I understand correctly,\nthere is no trial. It's a deferred prosecution on\ncondition that the -- the defendant abide by certain terms\nand conditions. Is that how it works?\nMR. PRYOR: That's -- that's correct.\nQUESTION: And if -- if the defendant then\ndoesn't live up to it, then it proceeds to trial.\nMR. PRYOR: Then it proceeds to trial.\nQUESTION: How many States use a system like\nthat?\nMR. PRYOR: I believe the -- the brief listed 23\nStates.\nQUESTION: Well, these are pretrial diversion\nprograms which have been very helpful in the drug context,\nbut they're extremely expensive to administer.\nMR. PRYOR: Absolutely. Absolutely. And -- and\nmany States may very well feel that -- that there's\nsomething almost unseemly about using this kind of\nbargaining process before you have adjudicated guilt or\ninnocence, and -- and the State certainly should have\nthe --\nQUESTION: Well, why is it any more unseemly\nthan the ordinary plea bargain?\nMR. PRYOR: Because at least in the -- in the\ncase of the ordinary plea bargain, the defendant comes\nforward and admits the wrongdoing. There's an indicia of\nreliability there for the State that's not present in this\nkind of pretrial system. And -- and the States who trust\ntheir system to adjudicate innocence or guilt may find\nthat that's a -- that the system that Alabama has is a\npreferable system.\nQUESTION: But Shelton was not given any\npretrial diversion. He was convicted, was he not?\nMR. PRYOR: That's correct, and Alabama doesn't\nhave it in this context except with respect to drug\noffenders.\nQUESTION: General Pryor, I can understand a\nline between a fine and any kind of confinement, and\nprobation may involve no immediate incarceration, but it\ndoes involve what could be very significant restraints on\nthe person. So, isn't it more logical to draw the line\nbetween money only on the one hand and confinement, be it\nin jail or under terms and conditions of probation?\nMR. PRYOR: Justice Ginsburg, I'd say no for a\ncouple of reasons. This Court has recognized that\nimprisonment is an intrinsically different form of\npunishment that has special constitutional significance.\nThe probation system is one that is meant more as\nrehabilitation and not as punishment to give an offender a\nsecond chance in free society. And -- and even with the\njudgment of a fine, as I mentioned earlier, there -- it --\nit is accompanied by the risk of imprisonment should the\ndefendant willfully refuse to pay that fine. So, even in\nthat context, in the judgment of -- of a fine, there is at\nleast that risk, the same risk that would exist under the\nregime that we propose.\nI do not discount the fact that probation has --\ncan have serious restrictions on liberty, but it's not the\n-- the deprivation of liberty, the loss of physical\nliberty, that is, physical confinement that this Court has\nheld triggers a right to court-appointed counsel under the\nSixth and Fourteenth Amendments.\nQUESTION: Under your view, if you enforced the\njail sentence through the contempt mechanism and reached\nthe same result, I take it you now have a second jury\ntrial.\nMR. PRYOR: Well, I guess it would be dependent\nin part on the nature of the contempt proceeding. If it's\ncivil contempt, if it's a direct contempt or an indirect\ncontempt, but if it's criminal contempt, I would imagine\n-- I say that. In Alabama, a criminal contempt procedure\nonly has a maximum term of imprisonment of 5 days. So,\nI'm not sure that -- that there would be a right to a jury\ntrial.\nFor more than 20 --\nQUESTION: But then -- but then the contempt is\n-- is really not a substitute of an equivalent for the --\nfor the imposition of the suspended sentence. They're not\nequivalent. If it's just 5 days, that's not equivalent to\nthe suspended sentence.\nMR. PRYOR: Oh, absolutely. That's absolutely\nright, although I would argue that -- that the threat of\nimprisonment is still enough to give the probationer an\nincentive to follow the orders of the court. It's\nabsolutely correct that there is a material difference\nbetween activation of the probated sentence in this case\nand the use of -- of the criminal contempt remedy that's\nprovided by the code of Alabama. There's no doubt about\nthat.\nThe -- what is at stake in this case is -- is\nthe use of probation, a valuable tool for the States that\nallow them the freedom and flexibility again to ensure\nthat scarce judicial resources can be preserved for more\nserious cases to provide counsel and to incarcerate more\nserious offenders.\nIf there are no further questions from the\nCourt, Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like to reserve the balance\nof my time for rebuttal.\nQUESTION: Very well, General Pryor.\nMr. Fried, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES FRIED\nON BEHALF OF THE AMICUS CURIAE\nIN OPPOSITION TO THE JUDGMENT BELOW\nMR. FRIED: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nFirst, if I might just refer to the deferred\nprosecution point, which was raised by Mr. Duke in his\namicus brief and in one of the questions. I think that's\na red herring because, as Mr. Duke points out, the\ndeferred prosecution requires the consent of both the\nprosecutor and the defendant. Obviously, the kind of\nprosecutions we have here are usually not consented to by\nthe defendant.\nI think it is --\nQUESTION: Why -- why is that a red herring?\nBecause I got from your brief the impression that the --\nthe -- there's a practical problem that a lot of States do\nwithout giving people lawyers. Perhaps thousands and\nthousands of cases say, go plead guilty. We'll give you\nsome light sentence that won't involve prison, but then\nthey attach to that a suspended sentence. And what I\nwondered is, well, isn't the solution to this to say --\nit's called pretrial diversion or pretrial probation or\nthey call it different names, but to say if you violate\nthe condition, what happens to you is not prison, what\nhappens to you is the trial that we haven't yet given you\nwith a lawyer. And I thought maybe that works as a\npractical matter in a lot of these States in a lot of the\ncases to which you referred.\nMR. FRIED: It -- it does work. For instance,\nwe use it a great deal in the Commonwealth of\nMassachusetts where there is a quite different rule from\n-- from the Argersinger rule where in Massachusetts we say\nif there's a risk of imprisonment, you must get a lawyer.\nAnd a number of States have that rule which is perhaps why\nthey also have the deferred prosecution.\nI say it's a red herring because what we're\nconsidering today is not the very best possible system but\nwhat is the constitutional minimum. Our emphasis in the\nbrief on Nichols is not in order to show that Nichols\nsomehow resolves this question in favor of allowing the\nprobated sentence and in favor of allowing it then to be\nactivated on violation, but rather Nichols shows that the\nquestion is an open one. Nichols doesn't resolve it, but\nthen neither does Argersinger. And I think it's a mistake\nand it's a mistake the Alabama Supreme Court made to treat\nArgersinger as having resolved this question.\nArgersinger made quite clear that there is a\ncontinuum here all the way from mere due process, which\nwas the law prior to Gideon, to a criminal -- to the right\nof a criminal defendant having a counsel in any criminal\ncase. And it picked a point. It picked a point which the\nCourt recognized had a certain arbitrariness, and it\npicked it for reasons of practicality and fairness. And\nthose considerations of practicality and fairness require\nno more than that there be counsel if the person is\nsentenced immediately then and there to prison.\nThe fairness aspect is, as the Illinois court\npointed out, that in these cases the defendant carries the\nkey to the prison in his own pocket. Whether he ends up\nin prison is a matter of his choice whether or not he\nviolates the terms of the probation.\nThat's why I think Mr. Duke enters two more red\nherrings into the argument. The stay on appeal.\nObviously in a stay case, the keys are not in the pocket\nof the defendant, but in the pocket of the appeals court.\nAnd the 30-day or $30 prison which is executed\nimmediately, in those cases the fine is either an illegal\nfine under the -- this Court's decision in Bierdon -- the\nperson doesn't pay because he cannot, and that is itself a\nconstitutional violation -- or once again, he is\nimprisoned because he chooses not to pay. And once again,\nthat is the fairness point. The keys are in his pocket.\nThat is a reasonable place to draw the line\nbecause of the very important practicalities. The\npracticalities are the literally millions of misdemeanor\ncases, the very large number -- it's hard to say exactly\nwhat the number is -- the very large number of\nprobationary misdemeanor sentences, and the fact that\nthose probationary sentences overwhelmingly are intended\nto serve a rehabilitative or preventive function. Don't\ndrive again. Take a anger management course. Go to\ncounseling. And the -- this is meant to keep people out\nof prison, not to put them into prison.\nUnfortunately, if you insert a mandatory\nformality into something which is a little bit like family\ncourt proceeding, necessarily you will have a perverse\neffect. The State has to spend more time, has to spend\nmore resources. It will do this less frequently, but it\nwill make sure it gets more of, if you like, deterrent\nbang for its buck, and the result will be perverse.\nThis system, as simply a constitutional minimum,\nallows the States the flexibility which this Court from\nthe beginning, from Argersinger on, has recognized.\nQUESTION: You do allow the possibility that\ncounsel could be provided in the event the probation is\nrevoked.\nMR. FRIED: I think that's a very real\npossibility. Ganyon talks about that in terms of due\nprocess, and I think the practicalities change --\nQUESTION: But the issue with the revocation\nhearing would not necessarily be whether he committed a\ncrime. It would just be whether he violated a term of\nprobation such as leaving the jurisdiction or something.\nMR. FRIED: That is correct.\nQUESTION: He can get counsel to defend him\nagainst that.\nMR. FRIED: That is correct.\nQUESTION: Not against the crime itself.\nMR. FRIED: That is correct.\nQUESTION: Well, it would -- it would also\ncover, I take it, whether or not the plea was voluntary\nand knowingly made originally.\nMR. FRIED: That could be brought up. Nothing\n-- nothing precludes bringing that up. What you have is a\nfunnel with a very large opening, and in terms of the\nstatistics, a very small tube at the bottom. It would\nnot --\nQUESTION: Well, is it your view that at the\nprobation hearing you reexamine the validity of the\noriginal offense, the original conviction?\nMR. FRIED: The -- Alabama is a good example of\nwhat is open at probation. In most jurisdictions, oddly\nenough, not in Massachusetts -- in most jurisdictions, the\ncourt on probation is free to impose new -- the revocation\nproceeding -- new conditions, the sentence that has\nalready been imposed, or a lesser sentence in light of all\ncircumstances, and it mentions specifically\ndepreciating --\nQUESTION: Yes, but all those alternatives\nassume the original conviction is valid.\nMR. FRIED: I don't see why in those\nproceedings --\nQUESTION: At least in a typical case.\nMR. FRIED: -- the lawyer could not argue, look,\nyou're asking whether this will depreciate the gravity of\nthe original offense. Let me tell you a little bit about\nthat. And I would think the judge would listen, and he\nhas the discretion to impose a lesser sentence.\nQUESTION: This is all pretty speculative, isn't\nit, since that question doesn't confront us here?\nMR. FRIED: No question. And I simply want to\nemphasize that that is open and is an important question\nperhaps best considered in a case where it can be fully\ndeveloped. But I don't think the Court should decide this\ncase on the assumption that that possibility might not in\na later case be open. And I think that leaves the kind of\nflexibility which is very desirable in these low level but\nvery frequently encountered cases. I think that's what\nwill serve the -- the Constitution and the interests of\nrehabilitation best.\nQUESTION: Do we have any idea of the 1.4\nmillion to 1.8 million people who are on probation for\nmisdemeanors, of what percentage of those cases the -- the\nprobation -- or the defendant was not offered a lawyer? I\nmean, the relevant feature is --\nMR. FRIED: We try --\nQUESTION: That's a rather -- yes.\nMR. FRIED: We try to infer that in the brief.\nIt's -- the statistics are not kept in a transparent or\nuseful way. But it may be in the hundreds of thousands.\nIt may be in the hundreds of thousands because as -- as we\nexplain in our brief, there are a very large number of\npersons on probation who did not have lawyers, and given\nArgersinger, we may assume that they were misdemeanors.\nSo, it's a very large number.\nBut the number of persons who are actually\nincarcerated for breach of those conditions is quite\nsmall. It's in the thousands. And that's why I think it\nbecomes quite practical to offer an attorney to help in\nthat condition, but really I think very confining and\nperhaps with a perverse effect to require it as a\nconstitutional minimum in the much larger -- very much\nlarger number of cases where the matter is first\nconsidered. After all, if the person has to be sent to\nprison, that's a failure.\nI thank the Court for its attention.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Fried, and thank you\nfor your participation as an amicus.\nMr. Duke, we'll hear from you. I'm sorry. Mr.\nMills.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM H. MILLS\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. MILLS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nIt obviously is apparent here that both the\npetitioner and the respondent come to this Court relying\non the same authority, the -- primarily the Argersinger\nand Scott cases.\nIt seems that the State is taking a rather\nshallow view, in our judgment, of the Argersinger and\nScott cases both as to their background and how\nArgersinger is -- is implemented and the effect of that\nimplementation.\nQUESTION: Do you agree that neither of those\ncases squarely control the outcome here?\nMR. MILLS: It -- it would be my position that\nArgersinger does by the -- some of the pronouncements that\nit makes.\nQUESTION: Certainly the holding does not.\nMR. MILLS: The holding does not certainly.\nAnd it would further be my position that -- that\nthe Scott case has something to say to us about this issue\nalso, although the holding -- the -- the facts certainly\ndo not coincide with this case.\nIt seems to me that the background of the\nArgersinger and Scott cases, of course, are the -- the\nPowell v. Alabama, Gideon v. Wainwright series of cases.\nAnd in those cases, it seems that the Court has\nestablished the purpose of the Counsel Clause which if we\n-- if we reduce to its barest terms is this. The purpose\nof the Counsel Clause is to prevent, to the extent humanly\npossible, the conviction of the innocent in an adversary\nproceeding. That seems to be what Justice Sutherland said\nin Powell v. Alabama and what Justice Black said in Gideon\nv. Wainwright, that what is to be done is to eliminate the\nrisk that the innocent may be convicted.\nAnd when we come to the Argersinger case,\nalthough the -- the Gideon case had -- had spoken of this\nas being a -- or nobel idea was the -- were the words used\n-- but I believe spoke of counsel for every defendant in\nevery case as being a constitutional ideal. I think in\nArgersinger, the Court was faced with the argument of\npracticability and expense and -- and the other arguments\nthat -- that the State makes in this case, that the\nmandate can't be absolute, that there must be some\naccommodation to those arguments.\nAnd in Argersinger, it -- it seems that the\nCourt made those accommodations. And if we include --\nQUESTION: Well, the Court basically said, fine\nonly? Okay. We're not going to extend the Sixth\nAmendment to that.\nNow, here we have a State that says, well, we\nknow we can't enforce the sentence. It's a toothless\ntiger. We'll say probation, but it -- we don't mean it.\nI mean, we'll -- we'll maybe have proceedings, but we --\nwe can never enforce the sentence. In light of that,\nshould we be concerned here?\nMR. MILLS: Well, that -- that puzzled me\nsomewhat when the State made that concession in its reply\nbrief that this was in -- in effect a sham sentence. And\nI see no authority in the law of Alabama or any other\nState that I'm aware of that authorizes a court --\nQUESTION: Well, if that's the case, what do we\nthink about this?\nMR. MILLS: Perhaps we're dealing with a sham\nsentence. And perhaps that's the way the Alabama Supreme\nCourt treated it. But certainly there shouldn't be, from\nthis Court or any other court, an authorization for a\ntrial court to enter a sentence that can't be enforced.\nQUESTION: Would you just clarify one thing for\nme? Did the Alabama Supreme Court endorse that view, or\nis that the Attorney General?\nMR. MILLS: That's the Attorney General's view.\nWhat the Alabama petit court -- Supreme Court did was\nmerely strike the sentence.\nQUESTION: I guess whether you strike it or not\nis a matter of State law, isn't it? I mean -- I don't\nknow what the remedy should be for a sentence that's not\n-- not an enforceable sentence and the person writes it in\nthe -- the judge writes in the book, suspended sentence.\nAnd the State and everyone else, let's say, agree that\nthat isn't a lawful sentence. So, the State Supreme Court\nsays, erase those words. Strike them. Did anyone suggest\nthat was a matter of Federal law or what you do under\nState law when a --\nMR. MILLS: Well, I believe the Alabama Supreme\nCourt said it was -- it was a matter of Federal law.\nQUESTION: That it be struck rather than just\nleft to lie there unenforceable.\nMR. MILLS: I'm not sure they articulated in\nthose terms, but their -- their basis for reaching the\ndecision they reached was the Federal cases that deal with\nthe right of counsel.\nQUESTION: One of the things that didn't happen,\nwe know for sure, in this case was that an offer of\ncounsel. Was that merely a -- an inadvertence on the\ncourt's part or does Alabama not provide assigned counsel\nfor indigents in -- in a misdemeanor like this?\nMR. MILLS: Perhaps it was inadvertence, but the\n-- the Alabama rules of criminal procedure have that as a\npart of the -- the processing of any -- any case.\nQUESTION: In any misdemeanor?\nMR. MILLS: Any criminal prosecution, yes, sir.\nQUESTION: All right. So that if -- if there\nhad been -- if there were an offense in Alabama that\ncarried as much as a 1-day sentence, the State would\nprovide counsel for an indigent, at least if requested?\nMR. MILLS: Not -- not in those terms. Not -- I\nbelieve the Alabama rules say where constitutionally\nrequired. And of course the --\nQUESTION: So, they're not providing counsel in\nthese cases now because, I take it, the State's position\nis it's not constitutionally required.\nMR. MILLS: That's correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: At what point do they regard it as\nbeing constitutionally required? When the sentence can\nexceed 6 months or what? What -- what I'm getting at is I\nwant to know -- I want your response to the argument that\nthere's going to be a -- a great practical difference if\nwe say now you may not impose sentences like this at all,\neven though they're merely suspended. I want to know what\nthe practical difference is.\nMR. MILLS: From the -- the wording of the\nAlabama Rules of Criminal Procedure about appointment of\ncounsel at the present time, I would assume that the trial\njudge must go through the process outlined in Argersinger,\nthat is, make the pretrial determination of whether\nimprisonment is a likely punishment in this particular\ncase, and if -- if so, appoint counsel. If not so,\ncounsel is not appointed.\nQUESTION: Well, any imprisonment? 1 day of\nimprisonment?\nQUESTION: Isn't that what the Federal --\nArgersinger requires?\nMR. MILLS: I think that's what Argersinger\nsays.\nQUESTION: Okay. But Alabama, in other words,\nis not doing something eccentric in this respect.\nMR. MILLS: That -- that's correct.\nQUESTION: The -- the only difference then\nbetween the cases in which -- misdemeanor cases, for\nexample, in which counsel is offered, if an individual is\nindigent, and counsel is not offered are cases in which\nthe judge says in advance I'm not going to put this guy\naway at all even if we convict him.\nMR. MILLS: Presumably that's the process that's\nbeing followed.\nQUESTION: Now, do you have -- do you have any\nbasis to tell us what practical difference it would make\nif the judge said, well, I may impose a suspended sentence\nand therefore I will have to offer counsel because I read\nArgersinger as requiring that? Do you know what\ndifference that would make in practical terms? How many\ncases would counsel have to be offered and potentially\nprovided for where it's not being offered and potentially\nprovided for now?\nMR. MILLS: I don't have any data that would --\nwould support that, but it -- but it would seem that if\nthe trial judge makes the pretrial determination that any\nsentence, whether -- whether immediate or suspended, is\nwarranted or may be warranted in this particular case,\nthat counsel should be appointed -- of course, that's the\nposition.\nQUESTION: I understand that.\nMR. MILLS: That's the position.\nQUESTION: Mr. Mills, there is one thing that I\nthink is a piece of information that -- that is in the\nrecord, and that is that most non-indigent misdemeanors\nappear in court without counsel. So, the position that\nyou're urging is kind of a superior justice for the\nindigents. Counsel, you would say, in every case where,\nat the end of the line, there may be any jail time,\nalthough most people who can't afford counsel do not have\ncounsel in cases of -- of this kind.\nMR. MILLS: That perhaps is correct. I suppose\nmy response to that would be that that's -- that that's a\nfree choice that the non-indigent makes.\nQUESTION: Isn't it true also -- isn't it true\nalso, at least according to some of the statistics quoted,\nthat frequently these cases are not prosecuted by lawyers?\nThey're simply prosecuted by the arresting officer.\nMR. MILLS: That happens occasionally in\nAlabama. It used to happen a lot. It's -- it's fairly\nrare at the present time. But -- but that does happen.\nThat does happen.\nAnd, of course, in -- in Alabama, all\nmisdemeanors, except those that are initiated by\nindictment, the first trial is in a -- a district or\nmunicipal court where there's no jury trial. And the jury\ntrial, if there is a right to jury trial, comes only by a\n-- an appeal and a de novo trial in the circuit court,\nwhich is an administrative problem. I don't see that as a\n-- as a philosophical problem. It's -- it's still the --\nmost misdemeanors are -- are being tried in courts where\nthere is no jury, certainly all of them in the first\ninstance or most of them in the first instance.\nIt seems that the petitioner's position\noverlooks the fact that -- that the Sixth Amendment is --\nis prophylactic rather than curative. Now, its -- its\nideal is to prevent the convictions, not to do something\nabout them after they occur.\nNow, let me jump right quick to -- to the point\nthat Argersinger deals with it somewhat in that way.\nArgersinger is what we might call an outcome-based\nanalysis of whether there's a right to counsel. And --\nand to that extent, maybe it's -- it's curative rather\nthan prophylactic.\nBut if -- if it is to be outcome-based analysis,\ncertainly it ought to be the -- the total outcome not just\nthe immediate outcome, and if a suspended sentence results\nin incarceration, when the probation is revoked, that\ncertainly is a part of the -- of the outcome that\nArgersinger was -- was dealing that the trial judge is\nrequired to make some decision on before trial even\nbegins. So --\nQUESTION: Do you suppose it would be\nconstitutional for the State to offer the defendant at the\noutset the promise of imposition of a suspended sentence\nif counsel were waived?\nMR. MILLS: If knowingly waived, I don't see a\nconstitutional problem with that. And I'm sure that\nhappens in fact.\nQUESTION: Is that done sometimes in Alabama?\nMR. MILLS: It -- it is. It is done. And, of\ncourse, this is -- this is the distinction between the --\nthe pretrial diversion mechanism that was addressed\nearlier and a trial. Most pretrial -- perhaps all\npretrial diversions are by definition.\nQUESTION: Well, put in its raw form, if the\njudge said, now, if -- if you agree not to have a counsel,\nI'll agree not to impose a jail sentence, that -- that\nwouldn't be permitted. I mean --\nMR. MILLS: Yes, sir, and it seems if --\nQUESTION: I assume. Correct me if I'm wrong.\nI assume it wouldn't be permitted.\nMR. MILLS: I think that's correct. In fact, I\nthink that's what Argersinger requires. I think\nArgersinger requires a trial judge to assure the defendant\nwho goes to trial without a lawyer that he's not going to\nget jail sentence. And if he can receive a jail sentence\nsomewhere down the line, the judge has given him a false\nassurance. But --\nQUESTION: The -- the jail sentence would not be\nfor the original crime necessarily but perhaps just for\nbreaking probation.\nMR. MILLS: Well, I couldn't speak to all\njurisdictions, but certainly under Alabama law, there\nwould be no -- no way to impose a sentence for breaking\nprobation. It would either be the original sentence --\nQUESTION: Well, that's what I mean. But the\nreason this -- the original sentence now becomes effective\nis because he broke probation.\nMR. MILLS: This, of course, is correct. This\nis the -- the carrot and stick analogy which -- which\nthe --\nQUESTION: Well, maybe I misunderstood General\nPryor's argument, but I thought he was here arguing no, he\nwouldn't impose the original sentence ever. We'd just\nproceed on contempt, maximum 5 days. Did I misunderstand?\nMR. MILLS: I think that's what he -- he said.\nI'm sure he -- he told us the whole story about contempt\nunder Alabama law. Each day that a contempt continues can\nbe a separate violation, a separate contempt, and -- and\ncould warrant a -- an additional 5-day sentence. So,\ncontempt -- if a person was cited for violating his\nprobation because he quit his job --\nQUESTION: Well, but that wouldn't -- that\nwouldn't involve imposition of the original sentence.\nThat's something else.\nMR. MILLS: That --\nQUESTION: That was what I understood --\nMR. MILLS: That would be something else. That\nis -- that is for the contempt itself.\nQUESTION: What is your position in the case of\nthe individual who refuses to pay the fine? No suspended\nsentence of incarceration, simply a sentence of a fine,\nand he refuses to pay it. Assuming the facts are\notherwise the same, he did not have counsel and he was not\noffered counsel if indigent. Could the fine be enforced\nby a contempt sanction?\nMR. MILLS: I think this Court has addressed\nthat issue that it constitutionally can, and I -- I assume\nthere's no -- no impediment to that under Alabama law.\nQUESTION: Well, does -- is there -- is there\nsome tension between the position you take about the\ninability of the State to enforce a -- a condition of\nsentence or a condition of suspension in the position that\nyou take or acknowledge about the ability to enforce the\n-- the sentence of fine? Why should the two cases be\ndifferent?\nMR. MILLS: Well, I think the -- the difference\nis if the suspended sentence is imposed, a person is being\nimprisoned because he committed a crime. That would\nnever --\nQUESTION: And if the fine -- if the fine is\nimposed, the fine is being imposed because the individual\ncommitted a crime.\nMR. MILLS: Well, this is true, but only if he\nwillfully refuses to pay it where he has the ability to do\nso.\nQUESTION: Well, is the -- is the difference\nthat you're making willful? That -- that violations of\nthe conditions of suspension are not willful and refusals\nto pay a fine are willful?\nMR. MILLS: Well, I believe willfulness --\nwillfully refusing to pay a fine would be a -- a\nprecondition to -- to a contempt sentence.\nQUESTION: All right. Then let's assume that\nwe're talking about the class of -- of breach of -- of\nconditions of suspension that are willful. Let's assume\nthere's a condition of suspension that says you will be\nhome every night at 9 o'clock to keep you away from the --\nyou know, the bad influences you've had, and he willfully\nrefuses. I take it your position is that the suspended\nsentence still cannot be imposed. Is that correct?\nMR. MILLS: That -- that's --\nQUESTION: But that's just as -- the willfulness\nfactor is the same in the refusal to abide by that\ncondition as it is in the refusal to pay the fine. So,\nI'm having difficulty seeing why you -- why on your view\nthe -- the two should come out differently.\nMR. MILLS: Well, the -- the fine and the -- the\ncontempt for willfully refusing to comply with some other\nconditions, I -- I could not distinguish those.\nQUESTION: No.\nMR. MILLS: Of course, let me add one other\nthing about the contempt process to -- to enforce. Under\nAlabama law, it wouldn't save the State any money. It\nwould -- in fact, it would cost the State a lot of money\nbecause of the formalities required in a criminal contempt\nproceeding. There must be a separate proceeding. I think\nthere probably would not have to be a jury trial, but\ncertainly there would have to be counsel if it is\nanticipated that imprisonment will be one of the\npunishments for willfully refusing.\nQUESTION: But -- but it would only -- it would\nonly undergo that expense where there has been a breach of\nthe conditions of -- of probation. Whereas, you're\narguing that the State must undergo the expense of counsel\nin all cases. The number of cases where there's a\nviolation of probation is -- is presumably quite small,\nand -- and to say that the State has to provide counsel in\nthose cases in order to get the contempt sanction is -- is\nnot nearly as much of an imposition as -- as you're urging\nus to impose.\nMR. MILLS: Well, I would say one thing.\nPerhaps the -- the number of cases would not be as large\nas -- as might be anticipated. Presumably in many of the\nsuspended sentence cases, the judge perhaps has already\nmade that decision, this is a possible jail case or this\nis not a possible jail case. Or if he's made a decision\nit is a possible jail case, appoints counsel, he may, of\ncourse, impose a suspended sentence rather than an\nimmediate sentence. So, perhaps many of the cases are\nalready being appointed counsel. So, the -- the number\nmay not be that large.\nI thank the Court.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Mills.\nMr. Duke, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN B. DUKE\nON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CRIMINAL\nDEFENSE LAWYERS, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENT\nMR. DUKE: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the\nCourt:\nWere this a petty offense prosecution, perhaps\nthe only legitimate, appropriate question would be the one\nthat has occupied the Court thus far this morning, but\nthis is a not a petty offense prosecution. This is a\nserious offense prosecution. As such, it is a criminal\nprosecution within the Sixth Amendment.\nThe Sixth Amendment guarantees counsel\nregardless of the sentence or sanction imposed. There are\ntwo reasons why this is so. One is textual; the other is\ncommon sensical.\nQUESTION: You're not saying it would guarantee\ncounsel if only a fine were imposed.\nMR. DUKE: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. The counsel\nwould be guaranteed in any serious offense prosecution.\nQUESTION: Well, how do you reconcile that with\nArgersinger?\nMR. DUKE: Because Argersinger, Mr. Chief\nJustice, was a petty offense case. Argersinger explicitly\nassumed that if it were a serious offense case, there\nwould be the right to counsel. In fact, the lower court\nsaid there would be a right to counsel, but the lower\ncourt said he can't have a lawyer here because this was a\npetty offense.\nQUESTION: Well, but wasn't the basis on -- the\nbasis you're submitting now wasn't the basis on which the\nSupreme Court of Alabama ruled, was it?\nMR. DUKE: It -- it was not the -- the\nrationale, but it -- it does support the result of the\nAlabama Supreme Court's decision.\nQUESTION: But I thought that the main issue\nthat we had here is the one we've been talking about, is\nyou have to give a person a lawyer when it is a petty\noffense. And the fact is that there's going to be a\nsuspended sentence. So, what about that question?\nI mean -- and I -- I thought that Mr. Fried's\nmain point was don't do it because if you say you have to\ngive a person a lawyer, where it's a petty offense and the\nonly key thing is is a suspended sentence, I'll tell you\nthere are 1,800,000 people who have received probation in\npetty offenses. And there must have been some stick if\nthey violated probation, and that stick is like a\nsuspended sentence. So, deal with it when you worry about\nthe probation violation; don't worry about it up front.\nThat's -- that's what, I take it, is basically the\nargument.\nAnd I've been waiting for you to talk because I\nthought you might be a person who'd know the statistics.\nSo, you might know if that's really so if -- or which\nseems hard to get at how many of those $1.5 million\nwalking-around probation people did -- were never offered\na lawyer. What's --\nMR. DUKE: We don't know.\nQUESTION: We don't know. So, what are we\nsupposed to do?\nMR. DUKE: The -- the studies that I've seen\nsuggest that in misdemeanor -- petty misdemeanor cases,\nfrequently the -- the people are offered a lawyer in a --\nin a group and it's suggested that most of them don't need\nlawyers because they're not going to jail.\nBut I submit, Justice Breyer, that the -- that\nthe real red herring in this case is treating this as a\npetty offense. This is not a petty --\nQUESTION: And it's not offense because?\nMR. DUKE: Because the authorized sentence in\nthis case was 1 year, which made the jury trial right --\nguaranteed him a right to a jury trial under the Sixth\nAmendment, and because this was a criminal prosecution.\nQUESTION: But the question presented is this.\nIn light of the actual imprisonment standard established\nin Argersinger, refined in Scott, does the imposition of a\nsuspended or conditional sentence in a misdemeanor case\ninvoke a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel?\nNow, I think what you're saying is that the\nSupreme Court of Alabama decision could be supported on\nanother ground, but I'm not sure it -- it fits within the\nquestion presented.\nMR. DUKE: Well, I submit it does, Mr. Chief\nJustice, because as I suggested, Argersinger dealt with a\npetty offense. Scott dealt with the question of\nimprisoning somebody, but the -- but the fundamental\nquestion here that -- that this Court should not allow\nitself to get embroiled in it to repeat the mistake is to\ntreat this as if this is a trivial case because -- or to\nput it this way, at some point someone has to ask the\nquestion how is it that this defendant in this case had a\nconstitutional right to a jury trial under the Sixth\nAmendment because this was a criminal prosecution, but he\ndid not have a right to assistance of counsel.\nQUESTION: Our -- our cases have reached\ndifferent results on those two issues.\nMR. DUKE: But, Mr. Chief Justice, the -- the\nScott opinion, which you wrote, did not actually address\nthe serious offense 6-month distinction because the\nparties were not addressing it.\nQUESTION: Where do you get that from? You're\nappealing to the text of the Constitution. Aren't all\nmisdemeanors criminal offenses?\nMR. DUKE: All --\nQUESTION: Aren't all misdemeanors criminal\noffenses?\nMR. DUKE: They're criminal offenses but they're\nnot criminal prosecutions.\nQUESTION: And -- and what does the Constitution\nsay?\nMR. DUKE: Pardon?\nQUESTION: And what does the Constitution say?\nIt says in all criminal prosecutions.\nMR. DUKE: Yes.\nQUESTION: So, if you're appealing to the\nConstitution -- and -- and you say it's clear language. I\ndon't think it is. But if -- if you think it's clear\nlanguage, you should be arguing that even in petty\noffenses you're entitled to counsel.\nMR. DUKE: I -- I don't think I have to argue\nthat, Justice Scalia.\nQUESTION: No, only if you rely on the text of\nthe Constitution, which is what I thought you were doing.\nMR. DUKE: I'm saying that the right to a jury\ntrial exists because and only because it's a criminal\nprosecution under the Sixth Amendment. Logically,\ntherefore, if it is a criminal prosecution under the Sixth\nAmendment, then there is a right to counsel because the\nSixth Amendment says there is. But what the right to\ncounsel should be in petty offenses is a different issue.\nQUESTION: Why? It's a criminal offense. If --\nif you're arguing --\nMR. DUKE: It's a criminal offense --\nQUESTION: -- from the text of the Constitution\nthat says in all criminal prosecutions, it includes petty\nmisdemeanors as well as what you call major misdemeanors.\nMR. DUKE: I'm not arguing that all petty\noffenses are criminal prosecutions. They plainly are not.\nQUESTION: I know you're arguing it.\nMR. DUKE: They're not.\nQUESTION: They are not criminal prosecutions?\nMR. DUKE: No, otherwise there would be a right\nto a jury trial. There is not a right to a jury trial.\nQUESTION: Has this Court held that there is a\ncongruent right to a jury trial and --\nMR. DUKE: No.\nQUESTION: No. All right.\nMR. DUKE: But nor has it --\nQUESTION: Now, before I wrote an opinion\nsigning on to that, I'd like to see a brief.\nMR. DUKE: Nor has it --\nQUESTION: I'd like everybody to --\nMR. DUKE: Nor has it held otherwise.\nQUESTION: What?\nMR. DUKE: Nor has it held otherwise.\nQUESTION: Fine. But before I decide something\nlike that, I'd like to have everyone present their point\nof view. I actually read the briefs. I'm interested in\nboth sides. And -- and suddenly to decide it in this\ncase, what would you suggest we do? I'm not going to\ndecide something like that myself without having it fully\nbriefed. And -- and so, what would you suggest we do with\nthis case?\nMR. DUKE: Then -- then I urge the Court to at\nleast reserve the issue of what is the appropriate right\nto counsel in a serious offense where, as in this case,\nthe defendant has a constitutional right to jury trial.\nLet me just briefly quote Justice Powell, joined\nby then Justice Rehnquist, on the following proposition.\nWherever the right to counsel line is to be drawn, it must\nbe drawn so that an indigent has a right to appointed\ncounsel in all cases where there's a right to a jury\ntrial. If there is no accompanying right to counsel, the\nright to a jury trial becomes meaningless. No Justice of\nthis Court, so far as I know, in the last 40 years has\ndisagreed with that proposition.\nQUESTION: But the jury trial line is 6 months'\nimprisonment, isn't it?\nMR. DUKE: Yes.\nQUESTION: And here, under Argersinger, it could\nbe 1 day.\nMR. DUKE: Argersinger dealt with a stop-gap\nissue about where there's no right to a jury trial, can we\ndeny counsel, and Argersinger said no, not if you send the\nperson to prison because that's the basic due process\nproposition. There's no -- it's not a criminal\nprosecution under the Sixth Amendment. It's a due process\nissue as in Powell against Alabama. It's fundamentally\nunfair to send somebody to prison without giving him a\nlawyer.\nWith respect to the -- the argument that Mr.\nFried makes, that this is essentially a little bit of an\nextension of Nichols, there's no way that a -- the\nsentence in this case could be activated, imposed without,\nin effect, holding that the defendant can be sent to jail,\nconvicted of a crime and sent to jail, without providing\nhim a lawyer. This Court --\nQUESTION: Well, it doesn't follow that he could\nbe sent to jail without providing him a lawyer in the\nsubsequent proceeding.\nMR. DUKE: Yes, but --\nQUESTION: I mean, in Nichols, after all, we had\nanother conviction, and we had a lawyer representing the\nindividual when the question came up whether the first\nconviction should be considered and so on. And that may\nwell be so, let's say, on -- on Mr. Fried's view. There\nwould be a subsequent proceeding, and there would at least\n-- this is not a position he's arguing for this morning,\nbut it would be consistent with his position that counsel\nbe provided in that subsequent proceeding.\nMR. DUKE: Yes, but the crucial difference is\nthat the defendant under this proceeding that Mr. Fried is\n-- is urging the Court to approve -- the defendant would\nbe sent to jail without his guilt ever being determined in\na criminal trial in which he was represented by counsel.\nNever.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Duke.\nGeneral Pryor, you have 6 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM H. PRYOR, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. PRYOR: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nQUESTION: General, what was the -- assuming\nthat Mr. Fried's position is adopted by the Court, what is\nthe maximum time that the Alabama trial judge could\nsentence the violator to? What's the maximum time in\nprison?\nMR. PRYOR: The suspended sentence was 30 days,\nJustice Kennedy.\nQUESTION: The suspended sentence of 30 days.\nMR. PRYOR: That's -- that's correct.\nQUESTION: Can I ask you before --\nMR. PRYOR: Yes, Justice Breyer.\nQUESTION: There are -- at the bottom line of\nthe Alabama Supreme Court has two phrases in it. The\nfirst one, it says, we reverse that aspect of his sentence\nimposing 30 days of suspended jail time. We reverse.\nMR. PRYOR: Right.\nQUESTION: Then it goes to say, we tell\neverybody to the trial court vacate that aspect which\nimposed the suspended jail time. Those are two things.\nWe reverse and we tell them to vacate.\nAs to the first, we reverse that aspect, the\nState of Alabama agrees because they were there arguing in\nthe Alabama Supreme Court that a real suspended sentence\nthat meant something could be imposed, and here you're\nsaying it's not a real sentence because we can never carry\nit out. So, am I right in thinking it's the second part\nthat you disagree with and not the first part?\nMR. PRYOR: We're trying to make sense, as we\nunderstand it, of -- of the application of the rule of\nactual imprisonment. And I will acknowledge Mr. Fried may\nbe right, and if so, we would welcome that. But our\nunderstanding of Argersinger and Scott is we cannot\nactivate the suspended sentence --\nQUESTION: I'm not really asking about your -- I\njust want to know if you agree or you disagree with their\npart which says we reverse that aspect of the sentence.\nMR. PRYOR: No. No, Justice Breyer, I don't\nagree with that. And -- and the reason I don't agree with\nthat is because Mr. Mills said something that I think is\ncorrect when he said that the Alabama Supreme Court struck\nonly the suspended sentence and based only on Federal law,\nand what I contend is a misapprehension of Federal law.\nBut the suspended sentence itself is not a sham. It's a\ndevice to allow the court to impose probation, which is at\na minimum then fully enforceable through the same power\nthat's available to the -- to any court to enforce any\njudgment, including a mere fine, which Mr. Mills concedes\ndoes not trigger a right to court-appointed counsel.\nNow, I wanted to address one of the concerns\nraised by Justice Souter as to the practicality. There\nare some aspects -- some statistics we know as to the\npracticalities that are helpful, but I will admit we don't\nknow everything that we need to know. We know that there\nare approximately 115,000 misdemeanors each year in the\nState of Alabama. Those are addressed in our reply brief,\nthe yellow brief. We know that approximately 25,000 of\nthose result in supervised probation. We don't know from\nthe administrative office of courts in Alabama how many\nresult in unsupervised probation.\nWe also know in Alabama -- this is not addressed\nin our brief, but I checked it with -- with information in\nState government -- that between -- there are between\n2,100 and 2,200 attorneys in Alabama who accept court-\nappointed work. Unfortunately, the fact that we don't\nknow is how many of these cases, whether supervised or\nunsupervised probation and in misdemeanor cases, involve\nindigent defendants. But I hope that's at least somewhat\nhelpful.\nQUESTION: Let me ask you one more question.\nAnd I -- I don't imagine your statistics show this, but I\nwant to pass it up. Out of the 115, do we know, A, how\nmany of those were fine-only cases, not suspended\nsentences, but fine-only cases, and B, how many of those\nwere motor vehicle cases?\nMR. PRYOR: Were -- were?\nQUESTION: Were motor vehicle cases because the\nmotor vehicle cases take you out of this problem, I\nassume, in fine situations because if the fine isn't paid,\nthe motor vehicle -- I mean, the -- the motor vehicle laws\nsimply provide a -- a purely civil administrative means of\n-- of remedying the problem. And if they are a\nsubstantial part of the 115, then the -- the fear of what\nthis will do, in fact, is somewhat -- the Alabama Supreme\nCourt's view is -- is somewhat lessened. Do you know\nthose numbers?\nMR. PRYOR: No, I don't. But -- but I do know\nthat 2,100 lawyers to take -- when we have 25,000\nsupervised probation and some number in excess of that of\nunsupervised probation, still means that it's a daunting\ntask.\nJustice Ginsburg, the point that you raised\nabout the cost of counsel not being incurred by more\naffluent defendants I think is relevant from this\nstandpoint, when you consider that it is reasonable then\nfor the State to preserve its own resources, just as a\nmore affluent defendant would -- would preserve its\nresources not to incur the cost of counsel in this kind of\ncircumstance.\nAs to the argument that Argersinger would\nrequire the trial judge to inform the defendant that a\nsentence of imprisonment will not be imposed because\ncounsel is not being appointed, that is not what\nArgersinger or Scott require. Argersinger and Scott\nmerely deprive the trial court of that remedy upon\nconviction, but there's no requirement that the defendant\nbe informed of that.\nAs to Mr. Duke's argument that -- that there's a\ndistinction made in those decisions between petty and\nserious offenses, it's -- it's simply not there, and --\nand this is a misdemeanor case. It's clearly a criminal\nproceeding where the defendant not only enjoyed a Sixth\nAmendment right to retain counsel, but the record shows\nthat he clearly understood that right to retain counsel.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, General\nPryor.\n"
