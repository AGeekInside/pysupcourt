United States.
Ms. Freeland.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA B. FREELAND
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. FREELAND: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
Believing its hands were tied by a policy
statement created to prevent application of this Court's
decision in Booker to section 3582(c) proceedings, the
district court imposed a mandatory guideline sentence
that exceeded the maximum authorized by the jury's
verdict by more than six years. Sentencing Commission
policy cannot override this Court's clear and
unambiguous directive to courts to treat the guidelines
as advisory in all cases moving forward, and any
interpretation of section 3582(c) that permits the
Commission to mandate sentences must be rejected, not
only as a matter of statutory stare decisis, but because
it would violate the Sixth Amendment.
In an effort to avoid this result, the
government elevates form over substance, arguing that
section 3582(c) proceedings are not sentencings at
the -- and that the sentence imposed is not a new
sentence. The government is wrong.
Section 3582(c) proceedings are sentencings
at which Booker's constitutional and remedial holdings
must apply. The --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Freeland --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if the
Sentencing Commission just issued a new guideline and
said anyone with a -- a crack sentence, their sentence
is going to be reduced by 10 percent? That wouldn't
present any problems, would it?
MS. FREELAND: Mr. Chief Justice, I think it
would present precisely the same problems here. By
indicating an amount of time that a sentence could be
reduced, the Sentencing Commission would be doing
precisely what it did here, which is setting a lower
level, mandatory lower level, on sentences --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But there's no --
MS. FREELAND: -- that the district court
could impose.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But 3553(a) doesn't
even come into play under my hypothetical.
MS. FREELAND: I'm sorry, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 3553(a) doesn't even
come into play, so there's not a resentencing by a
judge. It is just an across-the-board policy, like
increasing good time credits.
MS. FREELAND: I disagree, Your Honor,
because Congress in this case decided to enact a
statute, 3582(c), that invokes the discretionary
sentencing power of the court.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right, in -- in this
case, but in my hypothetical Congress hasn't done that.
It hasn't -- or the Sentencing Commission hasn't done
that. They haven't invoked the discretionary
sentencing. They just said: Across the board, 10
percent off.
MS. FREELAND: And, Your Honor, perhaps I
misunderstood, but once the Sentencing Commission acts
to revise a guideline under its power under 994(u) and
opts to make that amendment retroactive under -- I mean,
994(o) -- and opts to make it retroactive under 994(u),
only the court has power to lower a sentence. Congress
enacted --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, why is that? It's
the same hypothetical of the Chief Justice. I'm not
interrupting your -- your discussion with him. Suppose,
pursuant to a permissible regulation, the BOP says: Just
file paperwork with us, and if -- and if you show that
you were under a crack cocaine sentence, you're going
to be reduced by X number of months, period. Just file
it. What --
MS. FREELAND: And, Justice Kennedy --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is there a problem with that?
MS. FREELAND: Justice Kennedy, I think there
would be. And, again, I don't mean to be dodging the question.
The problem is section 3582(c). Congress clearly indicated
that it wanted these types of reductions to be treated
differently than those under 3624(b), which are
delegated to the Bureau of Prisons. And those types of
reductions --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, but the -- the
hypothetical is Congress doesn't do this. The
hypothetical is that Congress just tells the BOP: Find
out who's in on crack cocaine and release them --
whatever, 20 months early.
MS. FREELAND: Your Honor --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: What's wrong with that?
MS. FREELAND: Your Honor, if
Congress chose to draft a statute similar to 3624(b) to
empower the Bureau of Prisons to act whenever the
Commission lowered a guideline or -- or changed a
guideline under 994(o), I agree with Your Honor. It
would not present the problems here.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Okay. Then the Chief
Justice's hypothetical, at least for me, meant: What --
why should there be a difference?
MS. FREELAND: The difference, again -- and
I don't mean to be dodging your questions. The
difference is that Congress acted in two very different
ways here. It enacted 3582(c) to deal with reductions
in sentence that are -- that are prompted by revisions
to the guidelines, and it enacted 3624(b) to deal with
revisions that are prompted by good behavior. And
it --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What is the
constitutional difference that would inure a Sixth
Amendment right in the resentencing by the court that
doesn't when it's a resentencing or a modification of a
sentence by the Bureau of Prisons?
MS. FREELAND: Justice Sotomayor, I think
the difference would be that when it is delegated to the
courts under a statute like 3582(c), the court is then
dealing with a mandatory guideline range, and the Sixth
Amendment problem arises when the court sentences --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But is this truly a new
sentence, meaning a person serving a sentence? This is
an act of clemency. Whether the Bureau of Prisons does
it or the court does it, why should we introduce a
different binding or non-binding constitutional limit on
one body rather than the other?
MS. FREELAND: Justice Sotomayor, I disagree
with the premise of your question that this is an act of
clemency similar to the reductions for good time
behavior.
The -- the term "clemency," "leniency,"
"grace," connotes the idea that you deserve to be
punished for this, but we're going to -- we're going
to exercise leniency --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Freeland --
MS. FREELAND: -- and give you a lesser
sentence.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I take
you on another path, not the question of the difference
between the two -- two sections. We have a large
prison population, and then Booker comes down, and then
the guidelines change only as to crack cocaine, nothing
else. All of the others whose sentence has become final
cannot get into the court's door because they don't have
the entering wedge.
In what system -- what fair system would
say, aha, because the crack cocaine guideline was
reduced -- the disparity was reduced -- these people are
now going to overcome the finality bar, but all of the
others who are identically situated with respect to all
other factors, they don't get their sentences revised?
MS. FREELAND: Justice Ginsburg, I have a
couple of responses to your question. The first is that
I think that a decision by a district court judge to
correct a sentence under 3582(c) should be analogous to
a decision of a district court judge to correct a
sentence under 2255.
Once the decision is made that the sentence
should be corrected, finality is extinguished, and when
the court goes about imposing the new sentence, it must
comport with the law of the land at the time.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But why should, bearing
in mind that entire prison population similarly
situated, the courts say it's -- the finality bar is lifted
only to the extent that the crack cocaine guideline disparity
has been reduced?
MS. FREELAND: And, Your Honor, once the
finality bar is lifted, the concerns about retroactivity
should slip away. But with respect to fairness, which I
think is at the heart of your question, the fact that
this partial remedy for an urgent and compelling
problem, that is, the crack guideline, was afforded to
some should not prevent the court from seeing justice
for those like Mr. Dillon, even though there are some in
prison that are serving unconstitutional sentences that
will not be able to seek relief.
Mr. Dillon is properly compared to other
defendants who were sentenced under the amended crack
guideline, not the original crack guideline. His
sentence is an amended crack guideline sentence, and for
purposes of avoiding unwarranted disparities, Mr. Dillon
is most comparable to those other defendants that are
sentenced after the crack guideline.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: If you -- if you are
right that this benefit goes to -- only to the class
that can get in the door, wouldn't that be a powerful
motive to the Sentencing Commission not to make its
guidelines reductions retroactive?
MS. FREELAND: Your Honor, I would certainly
hope not. 994 clearly contemplates that the Commission
will undertake a constant review and revision of the
guidelines to make sure that they serve the purposes of
punishment. And 994(u) clearly shows that Congress
contemplated that some of those decisions would warrant
retroactive application.
If the Commission were to respond to a
decision by this Court in Mr. Dillon's favor by refusing
to revise the guidelines in the future or refusing to
make any of those revisions retroactive, I submit that
it would be abdicating its duty under 994.
JUSTICE SCALIA: It wouldn't say that. It
just wouldn't do it. That's all.
MS. FREELAND: You're right, Your Honor.
It just wouldn't do that, but history would speak for
itself. The Commission has constantly undertaken this
duty under 994(o).
JUSTICE SCALIA: But it's certainly a
factor that if I were -- if I were on the Commission, I
would certainly take that factor into account. Every
time I make it retroactive, it's going to reopen --
going to reopen the whole sentencing and -- and allow
a Booker application where -- where it didn't apply
before. How can I close my eyes to that if --
MS. FREELAND: Well, Your Honor --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- if I'm making the
retroactivity determination?
MS. FREELAND: Your Honor, if I could, I'm
not suggesting that the Commission close its eyes to
anything. However, what we're asking for in this case
is not a full resentencing where all sentencing
decisions would be reopened. We're simply saying that
when a court imposes a new sentence, that new sentence
must comply with this Court's decision in Booker, and --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Only Booker?
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that means it --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Only Booker?
What if there is another constitutional objection
to the sentence, and he goes back under --
under the crack cocaine? Can you say, oh, and, you
know, also, it violated my rights under equal
protection? You didn't notice that before, but here's
the argument. Is that before the sentencing court?
MS. FREELAND: Your Honor, I would have to
say that it is. The -- the new sentence --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, you would you
have to say. So --
MS. FREELAND: The sentence imposed would
have to comply with the Constitution.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it's not only as
unfair as Justice Ginsburg hypothesized. It's even more
unfair than that, because just because of the crack
cocaine change, somebody with an equal protection
challenge gets to raise that. While somebody in prison
without an equal -- with an equal protection challenge
but not the crack cocaine one is still stuck.
MS. FREELAND: That's true,
Mr. Chief Justice, but that's the case in any situation
where a defendant has raised an issue on appeal or has
presented a claim in a 2255 petition, and just by
happenstance the decision awarding them a new -- a new
trial or a new sentence happens when a new
constitutional rule is announced by this Court.
Now, certain --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's a new
constitutional rule. This is an old one. This is one
that was -- you know, the equal protection clause has
been in the books for a while. And -- and he -- he just
gets the chance to raise it solely because of the fact
that his conviction involved crack cocaine.
MS. FREELAND: And, again, Your Honor, I
think that he would get to raise it, but I want to point
out that not every constitutional issue would be ripe
for the court's decision at that proceeding. If there
were an opportunity to raise -- as you said, equal
protection isn't a new law like -- we're talking about
Booker being a new law for Mr. -- for Mr. Dillon. If
there were an equal protection challenge that had not
been lodged at the original sentencing, the district
court would apply the law of the case and then --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, no, no, no. I
thought under your theory this is a whole new
sentencing. So who cares whether he waived it at the
first one? We're starting from -- from point zero.
MS. FREELAND: Mr. Chief Justice, I must
have misspoken. That is certainly not what I meant to
indicate. What I meant to say is, certainly, all
sentences imposed ought to comply with the Constitution,
but we live in a system that has waiver principles, law
of the case, mandate rule. These are all obstacles that
a defendant seeking to overturn a sentencing or raise an
issue on equal protection grounds that weren't presented
before would serve as obstacles to their doing so.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And my point is that
they shouldn't under your theory. The fact that he
waived it at the earlier sentencing under your theory
should not matter at all, because your theory is that
this is a whole new sentencing, so who cares what went
on in the prior sentencing?
MS. FREELAND: I disagree, Your Honor, that
my theory does not encompass that part of the rule. And
I think with respect to our criminal history issue that
we've raised that's precisely what we've said, that
there are errors that a district court may not be able
to correct in a 3582(c) proceeding --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why do you -- why do
you pick on -- on Booker as -- as not carrying over? I
mean, if you say that there carries over from the prior
sentencing his failure to raise the equal protection
claim, why can't you say it's also law of the case that
the Booker objection doesn't stand? It's law of the case.
It was decided before Booker, and that's the law of the
case as far as that's concerned.
MS. FREELAND: Well, Your Honor, if the law
of the case were in place before Booker were decided, the
new law would be an exception to the law of the case if
Mr. Dillon were resentenced as he were after the Court's
decision in Booker.
I'm not sure if that answers your question
precisely. For Mr. Dillon, Booker is new law at his new
sentencing. He did not have an opportunity to raise a
Booker objection or ask for a sentence below the
guideline range at his original sentencing.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Under your theory,
there's no bar to an upward sentence by the -- by the
judge, because if it's a brand new hearing subject to
Booker, which mandates complete discretion under 3553,
the judges define the sentence that fits the crime and
the defendant. So you don't mind an upward --
MS. FREELAND: Well, under 3582(c), Your
Honor, statute -- the statute provides that it --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I know you want --
MS. FREELAND: -- a sentence be only reduced
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You only want part of
-- the statute, not the whole statute?
MS. FREELAND: Your Honor, I think we want
the whole statute, the statute that allows --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If you want the whole
statute, then it's a new sentence. You can't beg and say
the statute limits up and down, but I only want the
down --
MS. FREELAND: Your Honor --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- and I want a new sentence.
It doesn't make sense.
MS. FREELAND: I think I understand your
point. The -- the problem is with the statute. 3582(c)
does not authorize a court to increase the sentence.
The fact that a sentence cannot be increased
does not divest the proceeding at which it's imposed --
JUSTICE BREYER: So what's -- what's the --
the words in the statute is that it may reduce the term.
You can't change the term -- you cannot change a
sentence, except that you can reduce the term if such
reduction is consistent with applicable policy
statements.
MS. FREELAND: That's correct, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER: Do you see anything --
what's -- what's unconstitutional about that? Then they
issue a policy statement, and the policy statement says
you can't reduce it except insofar as our new --
whatever the new thing is -- applies.
If you're arguing that that violates the
Constitution, what I'm missing is why? What violates
the Constitution in that?
MS. FREELAND: Your Honor, post-Booker, what
violates the Constitution is the policy statement's use
of the word "shall." That's a -- that's a
significant change --
JUSTICE BREYER: I don't remember --
MS. FREELAND: -- in the wording of 1.10
JUSTICE BREYER: I thought in Booker --
and I have to go back and look at it, but I thought in
Booker the Court held that certain specific -- like
certain specific words in certain specific provisions
of the -- the sentencing statutes were unconstitutional
because of Apprendi and because of the other part,
Booker itself.
Well, 3582 wasn't one of them. So -- so
there must be something unconstitutional if you're
right. I don't see how you get around this statute.
MS. FREELAND: Your Honor, in our view
3582(c) is not unconstitutional. It --
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. If it's not
unconstitutional, then why don't you have to follow it?
Because what it says is, you cannot get a reduction
except in respect to what the policy guideline says.
And the policy guideline says you don't get a reduction,
except insofar as we've reduced a sentence in a
particular respect.
What's unconstitutional about that? I'm --
I'm not saying there isn't. I want to know what your
argument is that it is unconstitutional.
MS. FREELAND: Justice Breyer, post-Booker,
if 3582(c) is interpreted as you just said, that the
sentence -- the reduction in sentence must be consistent
with applicable policy statements absolutely --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's what it says.
I don't know how you'd interpret it some other way --
MS. FREELAND: And that the --
JUSTICE BREYER: -- if that's what it says.
MS. FREELAND: And that the policy statement
then requires the court to impose a mandatory guideline
sentence --
JUSTICE BREYER: No, it just says what we're
doing is we're reopening the sentencing in respect to
the particular way we reduce people's sentence, not in
respect to something else. That's what I read the
policy statement to say. That if there were 19 things
that were considered in the sentence and one of those 19
is changed in a downward direction, then it says we make
an exception, says the policy statement. You can reopen
number 19, but not the first 18.
Now, why is that unconstitutional? What in
the Constitution prohibits doing that?
MS. FREELAND: The -- Your Honor, if I could,
the constitutional problem with section 1B1.10(b)(2)(A)
is that it requires the district court to impose a
sentence within the guideline range. Therein lies
the problem. The requirement, a mandatory guideline
sentence based on a judicially enhanced range --
therein lies the problem.
Section 3582(c) does not mandate guideline
sentencing. It's 1B1.10.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Freeland, what would
happen if the -- the motion is made with respect to the
crack cocaine, and the judge said, I'm -- I'm not going
to -- I deny the motion? Would the judge then have to
go on and consider Booker and say, now, on this piece,
I deny the motion, but now I can just do whatever I want
with the rest of it?
MS. FREELAND: Your Honor, if I could, if a
judge is presented with a 3582(c) motion and denies the
motion, all the court has done is enter an order denying
a motion.
It's not until the district court decides to
grant the 3582(c) motion and reduce the defendant's
sentence that 3553(a) factors come into play, the policy
statements come into play, and a new sentence is
thereafter imposed.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, if -- suppose
Congress and the Sentencing Commission had made it
crystal clear that they are authorizing a reopening but
only with respect to one piece. You say -- you say no
matter how clear it is, as a matter of constitutional
law, because Booker has been decided, the whole sentence
is up for --
MS. FREELAND: Justice Ginsburg --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- consideration?
MS. FREELAND: Justice Ginsburg, that's
correct. And the reason is because 3582(c) is a
provision that is used by courts to correct sentences.
Once the court decides that the defendant is worthy of a
correction, that the sentence should be corrected, it
grants a motion extinguishing the old sentence and
imposes a new sentence.
Our position is simply that when it imposes
the new sentence, it must comply with Booker's
constitutional and remedial holdings.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I have a better answer to
Justice Breyer's question. You want my better answer?
MS. FREELAND: Please, Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Sure.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SCALIA: It's -- it's -- it's not --
it's not section 3582 that's unconstitutional, and it
isn't even the provision for being guided by a policy
statement of the Sentencing Commission that's
unconstitutional. It is the nature of the Sentencing
Commission's policy statement that is unconstitutional.
Surely, if the Sentencing Commission had a
policy statement which said you will reduce it for white
prisoners but not for black prisoners, that would surely
be unconstitutional, right?
MS. FREELAND: Absolutely, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And your point here is that
the policy statement which says you effectively will
disregard Booker is unconstitutional?
MS. FREELAND: I agree.
JUSTICE SCALIA: That works, doesn't it?
MS. FREELAND: I agree. And, Justice
Breyer --
JUSTICE BREYER: You agree. Now -- now,
what -- that's what I -- I could understand that if 3582
said to the judge you resentence him. But it doesn't
say that. So there's a sentence in effect, and what
3582 says is a -- a sentence can be reduced just as if,
to go back to the beginning, Congress passed a statute
or the Commission said everybody's sentence will be
reduced. That doesn't change what the sentence was. It
says there's a reduction, like for good -- good time.
So it says a defendant, if he has been
sentenced based on factor 19 in the case, the court may
reduce the term of imprisonment, the term of
imprisonment there under the sentence. So I'm back to
my question.
What's unconstitutional about that?
MS. FREELAND: Justice --
JUSTICE BREYER: And what the court just says
is the court -- the Commission says: That's right. You
may reduce it in respect to what we've considered; you
may not reduce it in respect to something which is
not considered.
So I'm still puzzled about the constitutional
problem.
MS. FREELAND: And, Justice Breyer, I
apologize because I may not be --
JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, you don't have to
apologize.
MS. FREELAND: -- I may not be understanding
your question.
JUSTICE BREYER: I understand your argument
now. And I didn't quite and now I do. So there's nothing
to apologize for.
MS. FREELAND: Okay. I'd like to --
JUSTICE BREYER: You wanted to get the idea
in my mind. I'm not expressing that in my question, but
I got your answer.
MS. FREELAND: Okay, thank you.
(Laughter.)
MS. FREELAND: A couple of points, though,
that I -- that -- from reading the text of the statute
that I'd like to point out. Justice Breyer, notice
it doesn't say "sentence." It says "term of
imprisonment." "Term of imprisonment" is -- is a term
of art in the Federal Code. A "term of imprisonment"
is an authorized sentence under 3551 of the United
States Code. And under 3621, the Bureau of Prisons
cannot hold someone in custody absent a sentence of
imprisonment.
And in this case, there are two judgments,
two sentences of imprisonment. The Bureau of Prisons
would not have been able to hold Mr. Dillon for
270 months under the 1993 judgment, and the Bureau of
Prisons certainly cannot hold Mr. Dillon for 322 months
under the --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. Why --
MS. FREELAND: -- the June 2008 judgment.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why could they --
the first part of that, why could they not hold him for
the term under the 1993 sentence?
MS. FREELAND: Under 3621, it's very clear
that the -- the Bureau of Prisons, absent a reduction
under 3624(b) for good time, is directed to hold the
defendant in the custody of Bureau of Prisons for the
term of imprisonment on the judgment.
In this case, following the --
JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what if the
President reduces the sentence using his pardon
power? He cuts it back; he cuts it in half. The Bureau
of Prisons has to hold him for the full term of the
imprisonment? No, that can't be true.
MS. FREELAND: Justice Scalia, I'm certain
that that's not true. And I mean, there -- I'm not
familiar --
JUSTICE SCALIA: So why is this any
different?
MS. FREELAND: -- with those provisions.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why is this any different?
I mean, there are obviously -- what it proves is that
there are exceptions to that requirement that they hold
him for the term of imprisonment. They -- they have to
hold him for the term of imprisonment unless it has been
shortened, right, by -- by pardon or remission of part
of the term by the President or what the argument for
the government is, or by application of this retroactive
rule by -- by the Commission.
MS. FREELAND: And again, Your Honor, I'm
not familiar with the clemency and commutation
procedures. I would have to think that some piece of
paper, some order directing the Bureau of Prisons to
reduce the sentence, just as a new judgment in a 3582(c)
is a new sentence of 270 months, would have to be
presented so that the Bureau of Prisons would release.
But -- but that aside, the -- the real point
here is that the new judgment is a new judgment; it is a
new sentence. This is not a reduction in the old
sentence. It --
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's what it says.
It's -- the other thing that has bothered me, to tell you
the truth, is -- is the part of the point that was brought
up previously, that it is up to the Commission whether to
make it retroactive. It is.
MS. FREELAND: I agree.
JUSTICE BREYER: I don't know why they
couldn't take into account that to make any drug-related
change, you see, and then make that retroactive, is
going to reopen the sentencing for every single person
who has already been convicted of a drug crime in the
Federal courts, of which there are probably tens of
thousands.
And -- and I think they would properly take
that into account. And, therefore, they might properly
say, we're not going to make this retroactive.
MS. FREELAND: Your Honor, the -- the
practice in the court of appeals post-Booker of
remanding all of the cases that were in the pipeline
shows that the Federal courts are able to handle
revisiting thousands of sentences imposed under a
mandatory system to revisit them under 3553(a). And as
Justice Walton said in testifying before the Sentencing
Commission with respect to this issue, that the courts
are fully prepared to handle any administrative burden
and believes that such a burden would be sufficiently
justified for people like Mr. Dillon who are deserving.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'll make this brief
because your -- your rebuttal light is on. Your answer
made sense when we talk about term as opposed to
sentence, if you just look at (c). But (b) says,
"Notwithstanding the fact that a sentence to imprisonment
can be modified ... a judgment of conviction that
includes such a sentence constitutes a final judgment."
Does (b) not apply to (c)?
MS. FREELAND: (b) does apply to (c), Your
Honor, and I'm glad that you raised that because 3582(b)
is significant in that it does not distinguish the
effect of finality of remands, modifications under
3582(c); it's the judgment of conviction -- the
conviction that remains final. The sentence is no
longer final if modified under any of the provisions
listed in 3582(b).
If there are no further questions, I'd
like to reserve the remainder of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms.
Freeland.
Ms. Kruger.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONDRA R. KRUGER
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MS. KRUGER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The provisions of the Sentencing Reform Act
at issue in this case, unlike the provisions that were
at issue in Booker, do not govern the imposition of
sentence. They instead provide a discretionary
mechanism for the exercise of leniency for defendants
who have already been sentenced. The district court in
this case properly exercised its authority under the
statute to reduce Petitioner's sentence by a little bit
more than 4 years, which was the maximum amount of
reduction that was consistent with the Sentencing
Commission's specification under section 994(u) about
whether and to what extent its crack cocaine amendments
warranted reductions in already imposed sentences.
The district court had neither a further
obligation nor indeed the authority to set Petitioner's
sentence aside altogether and resentence Petitioner
under the advisory guidelines regime announced in
Booker.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Does that extend to --
which was part of this case -- the court notices that
there was a technical error; it was a calculation error
the first time, and the judge says, well, I'll fix
that up, too. That was an arithmetic error.
MS. KRUGER: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, the same
rule applies to the calculation error that Petitioner is
raising.
Section 3582(c)(2) wasn't designed by
Congress to serve as effectively a less restrictive
substitute for raising such challenges on direct appeal
or where otherwise available under section 2255. It was
instead designed for the limited purpose of providing an
opportunity to extend leniency to defendants whose
sentences are otherwise final, nonappealable, and
therefore not subject to any modification.
Justice Sotomayor, you had asked earlier
whether this provision was designed as an act of
clemency or was instead designed as a kind of adjunct to
the court's judicial review power, a kind of 2255-type
power. We think the answer is clearly that it was
designed as a mechanism for the exercise of a type of
clemency power. I think that's particularly clear if
you look at the parallel provisions in section
3582(c)(1), which are reprinted at pages 3a and 4a of the
appendix to the government's brief.
Those provisions also provide for similar
types of sentence reductions in cases where the director
of the Bureau of Prisons makes a motion for sentence
reduction based either on extraordinary and compelling
reasons or because the defendant is over the age of 70
and has served more than 30 years in prison.
In all of these cases, the district court
exercises a discretionary power to reduce the sentence
in the exercise of leniency, not because of legal error
but for equitable reasons.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that gets tied up,
doesn't it, to your argument that this is not a part of
the criminal prosecution, that this is a -- not a Sixth
Amendment proceeding, but -- not a Sixth Amendment
proceeding, so it doesn't require constitutional
protection?
MS. KRUGER: That's correct, Justice
Sotomayor. We think that what Congress has called for
in all of the sentence reduction provisions of section
3582(c) is a kind of discretionary mechanism for
reducing sentences that are already final and
nonappealable and can't be modified in any other respect.
It hasn't called for a de novo plenary resentencing so
to allow defendants in the position that Petitioner is
in to come into court and reopen every aspect of their
sentence, requiring reconsideration of guidelines
determinations made in this case more than a decade ago
or requiring application of intervening changes in the
law.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Am I correct in
understanding that 3582(c) was enacted prior to our
decision in Booker?
MS. KRUGER: Yes, it -- it was.
JUSTICE STEVENS: And is it clear that it
should be construed as though the system was mandatory
before the decision in Booker, rather than construed in
the light of the remedial decision in Booker?
MS. KRUGER: Well, I think there are two
questions that are raised here about how this statutory
scheme comports with Booker. One is the Sixth Amendment
question, whether this is a statutory provision that
calls for a resentencing, at which Booker and its
decision about the Sixth Amendment would apply.
And then the second question is even if you
think there is no constitutional problem with reading
the statute in accordance with its plain terms, whether
Booker's remedial analysis requires treating the
reference to the policy statements in section 3582(c)(2)
as purely advisory.
We think with respect to that question, not
even Petitioner is quite willing to embrace the full
consequences of that argument. It would mean severing
and excising the portion of 3582(c)(2) that requires
consistency with the applicable policy statements.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Right. Is that any more
a dramatic change than was made in the Booker remedial
opinion itself?
MS. KRUGER: I'm not sure whether or not
it's a more dramatic change in terms of the number of
cases that would be affected, but it's --
JUSTICE STEVENS: But the remedial opinion
basically rewrote the whole statute on -- except first
it didn't have to reach 3582(c), but it certainly
changed the -- the nature of the mandatory provisions
that were previously in the statute.
MS. KRUGER: That's true, and it did so in
order to solve the constitutional difficulties that were
created by a mandatory guidelines system with respect to
the imposition of sentence.
Without that same kind of Sixth Amendment
violation in the context of discretionary sentence
reduction proceedings, we think there is no basis in
Booker's analysis for severing and excising any portion
of 3582(c)(2), but I would note that the consequence of
severing and excising the requirement of consistency with
the applicable policy statements would be to free
district courts not only from the Sentencing
Commission's specifications about how much to reduce
sentences, but also which of its amendments to the
guidelines would justify retroactive application,
because it is after all in a policy statement, section
1B1.10, that the Sentencing Commission has specified
which of its amendments, among many, justify sentence
reductions under 3582(c)(2). That would mean that every
time the Sentencing Commission revises its guidelines
and reduces applicable sentencing ranges, any number of
defendants would be free to come to the district courts
and ask them to make their own independent judgment
about whether or not they should be effectively
resentenced as a consequence. And that would certainly
provide a significant disincentive for the Sentencing
Commission ever to revise sentencing guidelines in a
downward direction.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Have there been other
guidelines ranges that have been reduced, and, if so,
were those also retroactive?
MS. KRUGER: There have -- there have been
many guidelines ranges that have been reduced over the
course of the existence of the sentencing guidelines. I
believe that right now, the current number of -- of
guidelines amendments the Sentencing Commission has made
retroactive stands at 27.
This was the -- one of the first decisions
that the Sentencing Commission made about retroactivity
in the wake of Booker, and it did so with full
consciousness of the potential for broadly reopening
sentences. And it certainly weighed very heavily in the
Sentencing Commission's deliberations that the
traditional understanding, existing long before Booker
was ever decided, was that 3582(c)(2) proceedings do not
constitute plenary resentencings that incorporate all
intervening changes to the law.
JUSTICE BREYER: Can -- can I ask you a
different question on the secondary argument that they
make? When I read the secondary argument, that there
was an error in the calculation of the guidelines and
she would like to have that error corrected, I didn't
see anything in the policy statement that would prevent
her from getting that correction.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I think you told me -- I
asked you that question, and you told me it could not be
corrected, because everything was final.
MS. KRUGER: That's correct --
JUSTICE BREYER: But why?
MS. KRUGER: -- and the policy statement
actually also --
JUSTICE BREYER: What in the policy
statement? Because what it says is: What you're
supposed to do is: Judge, you go and look at the
guidelines that were applied. Now, substitute the
new one reducing the sentence for the old one, and
then go apply it.
And, therefore, that seems to me not to
block a claim that would say, when you apply these
guidelines with the new one substituted for the old one,
apply them; that is, if, in fact, there was an error
the first time.
Now, she may have a hard time showing that,
but if she can show it, what in the words that are right
there in (b)(1) stops her from getting that correction?
MS. KRUGER: It's on page -- if you look at
page 8a of the appendix --
JUSTICE BREYER: I have it.
MS. KRUGER: -- in the government's brief --
JUSTICE BREYER: I have it in front of me.
MS. KRUGER: In the final sentence, it says,
"In making such determination, the court shall
substitute only the amendments listed in subsection (c)" --
JUSTICE BREYER: That's right.
MS. KRUGER: -- "for the corresponding provisions
that were applied" ---
JUSTICE BREYER: That's right.
MS. KRUGER: -- "and shall leave all other
guideline application decisions unaffected."
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, all other guideline
application decisions, and the claim is that they just
made an error, like a clerical error, a clear error,
manifest injustice, in that first math. Do you think
that this would leave them unaffected?
MS. KRUGER: I do.
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. I see.
MS. KRUGER: I think that that is the plain
meaning of the Sentencing Commission's directive there.
I would say that the question --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I guess they also made a
mistake in not applying Booker, right?
(Laughter.)
MS. KRUGER: Well, the premise of that
question, I think, assumes two things. It assumes that
3582(c)(2) proceedings are plenary sentencings at which
Booker applies, which the Sentencing Commission, based
on a very long history of rejections and precisely
that parameter.
JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. I would have thought
the objection to that is: No, they didn't make a mistake
in applying Booker, because this Court has said that Booker
isn't retroactive.
MS. KRUGER: Well --
JUSTICE BREYER: And, of course, they did make
a mistake if it is retroactive. And then the Court should
have said it is retroactive, in which case there would
be no problem.
MS. KRUGER: Well, if Booker were
retroactive, I think that our position would still be
that this is not the proper vehicle for applying it,
that the proper vehicle would be to file a motion for --
to vacate or set aside the sentence under section 2255.
Congress didn't intend these sentence
reduction proceedings to serve essentially the same
purpose. It -- it intended them to serve simply the
purpose of reducing otherwise final, nonappealable
sentences. I would say --
JUSTICE BREYER: I know my word was: It
shall leave all other guideline application decisions.
Well, that's -- that's -- their claim is not that the
guideline -- it's that they -- they chose the wrong
guideline or they didn't apply the right words. You
see, so they weren't applying that -- they just applied
the wrong thing. Now you say I'm working too hard.
Okay.
MS. KRUGER: I think you may be working a
little hard, Justice Breyer.
(Laughter.)
MS. KRUGER: I would say that, on that
point, we also fundamentally disagree with Petitioner's
submission that there was any error in the calculation
of his criminal history score in 1993.
But to the extent that Petitioner wanted to
raise any challenges to that determination, we think the
appropriate time and place to do that would have been on
direct appeal of that sentencing decision, rather than
waiting a decade and attempting to use the 3582(c)(2)
proceedings as a kind of vehicle for collaterally
reopening that aspect of his sentence.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: When the judge considers
the adjustment motion under the -- under the section,
does he consider how the prisoner has behaved in prison;
i.e., if he has behaved very badly, he doesn't give
the -- the reduction?
MS. KRUGER: The district court can consider
any disciplinary proceedings that have occurred in the
course of the defendant's imprisonment, yes.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But he -- but he can't go
below.
The -- the Petitioner makes the argument
metaphysically that there's just a new sentence. In
your view, is that refuted by the language of (c)(2)
because they talk about in the case of a defendant who
has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment, and then
they say the term can be reduced, and it doesn't use the
words "a new sentence shall be imposed"? I assume that's
your argument.
MS. KRUGER: I mean, I think that that
certainly reinforces the conclusion that I think also
arises from other aspects of the provision, that what
Congress had in mind wasn't the imposition of a
brandnew sentence, but simply a discretionary reduction
of the old one. I think that's right, Justice Kennedy.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm troubled by
your response to Justice Kennedy's previous question,
that the judge can take into account conduct in prison
and all these other things. It does seem to open it up
to other factors than the crack cocaine disparity, and
once you're looking at other factors, why not look at
everything?
MS. KRUGER: Well, I think the answer to
that question is resolved by looking at the plain text
of 3582(c)(2), Mr. Chief Justice, which directs that
district courts have a discretion to reduce sentences in
a manner that's consistent with applicable policy
statements, but after considering these statutory
sentencing factors under section 3553(a), which
include, of course, the need to protect the public from
future crimes committed by the defendant, as well as the
history and characteristics of the prisoner.
The reference to 3553(a) guides district
courts' discretion in deciding whether or not to grant a
reduction that's authorized by the Sentencing Commission
in the course of its statutory duty under 994(u) to
specify whether and to what extent its amendments
justify retroactive application.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: So, it's a one-way ratchet?
MS. KRUGER: Effectively. I mean, it works
in both directions. It can justify granting a
reduction; in the case of Petitioner, the district court
thought that the 3553(a) factors clearly pointed in
favor of granting the reduction. But it also -- those
factors can work in the direction of denying an
otherwise available reduction.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: The Petitioner's brief
opens with a statement about his rehabilitation. We
don't know if that has been contested. You don't
respond to it. But let's assume that's all true. He
established schools, and he helped young people and so
forth.
Does the Justice Department ever make
recommendations that prisoners like this have their
sentence commuted?
MS. KRUGER: I am not aware of the answer to
that, Justice Kennedy. It is certainly true that
evidence of that type of rehabilitation factored into
the government's recommendation in this case that
Petitioner --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And isn't the population
of prisoners in the Federal prisons about 185,000 now?
MS. KRUGER: I think --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think it is. And were
there -- how many commutations last year? None. How many
commutations the year before? Five.
Does this show that something is not working
in the system? 185,000 prisoners? I think that's the
number.
MS. KRUGER: I -- I'm not prepared to speak
to that question today, Justice Kennedy. I can tell you
that the government very much takes those considerations
into account when making recommendations about available
sentence reductions under section 3582(c)(2).
And, indeed, in this case, the government
agreed that the Petitioner should receive the full
measure of the benefit that the Sentencing Commission
had made available when it decided to make the crack
cocaine amendments retroactive, based in large part on
Petitioner's conduct in prison and his other
characteristics.
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question?
Accepting the point that there's no constitutional
compulsion that they had to open up for a full new
sentencing, and I understand one reason for not doing it
is that you don't impose too much work on the district
courts for doing it, but could you explain to me why
as -- just as a matter of policy and good judgment, the
Commission would say, well, you can take a look at all
the negative factors that would argue against reduction,
but you cannot look at any of the factors that would show
why you should have had the same sentence that if -- why
you should get the kind of sentence you would have
gotten if you had been sentenced in the first place
today?
Because I guess this particular man is
going to be -- spend 22 more years in jail than if he
-- if he had been sentenced today.
MS. KRUGER: The reason why the Commission
doesn't do that is because it wouldn't comply with its
statutory mandate under 28 U.S.C. 994(u) to specify both
which guidelines amendments justify retroactive
application and the amount by which sentences may be
reduced.
The Sentencing Commission would have no
power to simply say in its policy statement: District
courts, you are free to reduce sentences by however
much amount you believe is appropriate.
JUSTICE STEVENS: You think the statute
would have prohibited a more generous policy statement,
then?
MS. KRUGER: I do think the statute would
have prohibited such a policy statement. Yes, that's
correct, Justice Stevens.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But I -- I still don't
understand how you fit into that your answer to the
Chief Justice earlier that, in fact, the court can
consider other factors in -- in 3553 when it's making
the reduction.
MS. KRUGER: Justice Scalia, I think the
answer is simply that the 3553(a) factors and their
consideration under 3582(c)(2) is designed for a
different purpose than for the consideration that goes
into the initial imposition of the sentence.
The point of considering the 3553(a)
factors, to the extent they are applicable, to use the
words of 3582(c)(2) --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.
MS. KRUGER: -- is just to determine whether
or not the district court will grant a reduction that is
authorized, to the extent it is authorized, by applicable
policy statements. It's not to determine whether the
resulting sentence, as an original matter, is greater
than necessary to comport with the statutory sentencing
factors. It's simply for the limited purpose of
deciding whether to exercise discretion to reduce the
sentence in a manner that's authorized by the statute.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I see. But -- but I
thought you said you could take into account good
behavior in that determination? But that isn't --
that isn't a factor that would cause you to disallow
the reduction. It's a factor that --
MS. KRUGER: It's a factor that would cause
you to permit the reduction, presumably. It's one of
the many considerations that a district court can take
into account in deciding that it will, in fact, exercise
its discretion to reduce the sentence to the extent that
that's permitted by Congress and applicable policy
statements.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it -- it's also
a factor that would -- might guide the district court to
a decision not to reduce the sentence.
MS. KRUGER: That's correct. It can point
in either direction in any given case.
But the critical point is that Congress has
set the parameters for the district court's exercise of
discretion in these proceedings. Whatever the district
court chooses to do has to be consistent with applicable
policy statements, including the Commission's policy
statement in which it's implemented its statutory
authority to specify whether and to what extent its
guidelines amendments will justify retroactive
application.
If the Court has no further questions, we
would ask that the judgment of the court of appeals be
affirmed.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Ms. Kruger.
Ms. Freeland, have you 3 minutes remaining.
MS. FREELAND: I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice
-- how many minutes?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Three.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LISA B. FREELAND
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. FREELAND: Three minutes, thank you.
A couple of points. I wanted to answer
Justice Kennedy's question. The court is not only
permitted to consider bad behavior in prison; under
1B1.10, the court is required. The word is "shall."
And, so, all of these things and many of your questions
point to the fact that this is an adversarial
proceeding.
Section 3582(c) describes a sentencing. It
requires the court to consider all of the 3553(a)
factors. It requires the court to be consistent with
policy statements. It requires the court to impose a new
sentence.
And the word "modification" that's used in
3582(c) connotes correction, not leniency, not grace.
Those are the functions of the executive branch, not of the
judicial branch. And, in this context, the court decided,
after the Commission reduced the sentencing -- the
sentencing guidelines for crack offenders, that a
correction was warranted. There was an error in the
prior sentence that 3582(c) permitted the district court
to correct, and when it imposed a new sentence, that new
sentence has to comport with current law.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can I get you to go back
to -- you said something that only the executive can grant
clemency or ought. What -- what about a program where a
district judge says I'm going to have this person undergo a
course -- a drug addiction course, and if the defendant
successfully passes the course, then I'll give a
lighter sentence? That -- that --
MS. FREELAND: Justice Ginsburg -- I'm
sorry.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did your answer exclude
that -- that possibility?
MS. FREELAND: Justice Ginsburg, your
hypothetical -- the court is imposing a sentence or
conditions of a sentence, and once those conditions have
been met, the defendant is relieved, just as when the
conditions of a sentence of imprisonment have been met,
the defendant is released from prison.
One point that I'd like to get back to,
because there were many questions about it, is this
consistent with policy statements? Policy statements by
definition do not bind. The Sentencing Commission in
this case changed the 1B1.10 to say that the sentencing
court could not, shall not, impose a sentence below the
guideline range. 1B1.10 for all of the 26 retroactive
amendments that preceded the crack amendment read
district courts should sentence within the amended
guideline range, and that's appropriately a policy
statement. 1B1.10(b)(2)(A) is not a policy statement.
It purports to be a binding rule. And as this Court
knows, policy statements do not bind.
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but they do if
Congress says they do.
MS. FREELAND: When Congress says consistent
with policy statements -- and, Your Honor, I would
direct you -- I see my red light is on, if I could
finish --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can answer
Justice Breyer's question.
MS. FREELAND: I would direct you to the
amicus brief on behalf of the defenders, at pages 23 and
24, and our reply brief, at pages 25 and 26, for an
excellent --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
MS. FREELAND: Thank you very much.
