Am I pronouncing your name\ncorrectly?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. ROADARMEL, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. ROADARMEL: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:\nIn 1996 the Antiterrorism and Effective Death\nPenalty Act, or AEDPA, was enacted, which imposed a 1\nyear limitation period upon the filing of Federal habeas\npetitions following the finality of a State criminal\nconviction.\nIn Duncan v. Walker, this Court held that the 1\nyear limitation period may be tolled during the pendency\nof a properly filed State post-conviction or other\ncollateral application, but not during the pendency of a\nFederal habeas application.\nDespite that holding, the Ninth Circuit in this\ncase concluded that the district court's dismissal of\nadmittedly mixed Federal habeas petitions was improper and\nprejudicial because the district court did not provide\ncertain advisements designed to effectuate the Ninth\nCircuit's practice of stay and abeyance.\nQUESTION: Is there some peculiar virtue about\nthe word advisements as opposed to advice?\nMR. ROADARMEL: No, not in this particular\nsituation, Your Honor.\nWe believe stay and abeyance is incompatible\nwith this Court's precedent, as well as AEDPA, for four\nreasons.\nQUESTION: Before we get to that, do you agree\nthat some kind of remedy is required here, warnings or no\nwarnings, as a result of the fact that what the judge did\ntell the -- the defendant in this case seems to have been\njust affirmatively misleading. He said you -- dismiss and\nthen you can come back when it was perfectly clear, that\n-- that he could never come back that the time in -- in\nall practical terms would have run. Haven't we got to do\nsomething or hasn't the courts got to do something to\ncorrect that?\nMR. ROADARMEL: We don't believe that the advice\nwas misleading or erroneous in this case.\nQUESTION: Well, is -- is there any chance -\nQUESTION: Well, is that issue still open? I\nmean, even if you're correct on your premise that a court\ndoesn't have to inform a defendant of the statute of\nlimitations, is -- is the issue of possible misleading of\nthe defendant open on the remand even if you were\nsuccessful?\nMR. ROADARMEL: No, we don't believe it would\nbe.\nQUESTION: Well, shouldn't it be? I mean, if -\nif we think that the record shows there is some evidence\nof misleading where the defendant expressed concern about\na statute of limitations problem and was told it wouldn't\npresent a problem, when in fact it did -- it had already\nrun -- you don't think that should be open on remand?\nMR. ROADARMEL: If that were the case, perhaps\nthat would be the situation or perhaps that would be the\nremedy. That wasn't the case here. The district court\ntold Ford that he could refile his petitions following\nexhaustion and dismissed the mixed petitions without\nprejudice.\nQUESTION: But it wasn't without prejudice. For\nall intents and purposes, he could never come back because\nthe statute of limitations, as I understand the facts, had\nalready run before the case was even dismissed in the\ndistrict court. So he could never come back. Therefore,\nwithout prejudice was surely misleading.\nMR. ROADARMEL: No. Dismissal without prejudice\nmerely means that the petitioner can refile. It will be a\nseparate issue as to whether the claims of the petition\nthat he refiles will be considered on its merits.\nQUESTION: Do you think any person in the\nprisoner's position would conceivably have understood the\nstatement as you have just defined the term, without\nprejudice?\nMR. ROADARMEL: Yes. I -\nQUESTION: I mean, maybe somebody who -- who had\nthree law degrees could figure that out, but a defendant\nstanding here certainly isn't going to understand that.\nMR. ROADARMEL: Well, that -- that has always\nbeen the procedure when courts have addressed mixed\npetitions. They have always dismissed them without\nprejudice.\nQUESTION: And they have always made a statement\nthat was affirmatively misleading?\nMR. ROADARMEL: There is no statement here, we\nbelieve, that was affirmatively misleading.\nQUESTION: I mean, we -- we may agree with you\nthat the court does not have to give warnings. That's -\nthat's a -- that's an open question. But surely the court\nis -- is not free to make misleading statements.\nMR. ROADARMEL: Well, the court -\nQUESTION: We need to -- let me put it this way.\nWouldn't any defendant in his right mind, if he had known\nthat he could not come back into court, that the statute\nhad run, at least have said, well, judge, get rid of the\nunexhausted claims so that I can at least litigate the\nones which I have filed in time and which are exhausted?\nWouldn't that have been the only sensible thing for him to\ndo if -- if he had understood what you understand?\nMR. ROADARMEL: Not necessarily. A Federal\nhabeas petitioner may believe, in fact, that his exhausted\nclaims are unmeritorious or frivolous compared with the\nclaims that he wishes to exhaust in State court. So there\nmay be circumstances where a Federal habeas petitioner\nwill not, in fact, object to the dismissal of even his\nexhausted claims or to the -- the dismissal of an entire\npetition.\nQUESTION: May I ask you about the unexhausted\nclaims that have to go first to the State court? When\nRose v. Lundy was decided, this problem of time didn't\nexist because there was no statute of limitations on\nFederal habeas. Now that there is this bind, why isn't it\nappropriate to say the stay and abeyance applies not\nsimply to the Federal claim but to the entire complaint,\nwhich is -- is the ordinary rule when there's a -- a prior\naction pending or abstention? Usually the -- the whole\ncomplaint just sits in Federal court till the State court\nis through. Why shouldn't this, now with the statute of\nlimitations, the 12 months, in the picture, be the same\nway?\nMR. ROADARMEL: I think there are two responses\nto that. The first is that Congress would not have\ncontemplated that procedure because Congress, in\nincorporating section 2254(b)(1) in virtually unaltered\nform, would have contemplated Rose v. Lundy's application\nin the way it had always been applied by this Court.\nThe second response is that a stay of the\nproceeding under those circumstances would make sense only\nif the claims that are being dismissed as unexhausted can\nbe added back and would, in fact, be -\nQUESTION: So not added back. I mean, this is\nthe Third Circuit's solution, and I'm asking you why isn't\nthat the simplest way to deal with this. Nothing is added\nback. Everything, the entire complaint sits in Federal\ncourt while the petitioner goes over to State court to\nexhaust the State claims and then comes back to the\nFederal court with nothing to supplement. The complaint\nis already there.\nMR. ROADARMEL: That procedure guts Rose v.\nLundy and AEDPA. Rose v. Lundy would have absolutely no\nmeaning under that procedure because Rose v. Lundy never\ncontemplated that procedure. It contemplated the complete\ndismissal of a mixed petition or, at most, the dismissal\nof unexhausted claims from a mixed petition.\nQUESTION: But coming -- with the ability to\ncome back, which was not a problem then because there was\nno statute of limitations.\nMR. ROADARMEL: Well, even prior to the\nenactment of AEDPA, refiled petitions would not\nnecessarily be considered on their merits. Claims could\nbe procedurally defaulted, for instance, and if the\ndefault was based upon an adequate and independent State\nground, the claims would not be considered on their\nmerits, but would be summarily denied. So even prior to\nthe enactment of AEDPA, this Court contemplated that\nrefiled petitions would not necessarily be considered on\ntheir merits.\nBut --\nQUESTION: I mean, just to elaborate on Justice\nGinsburg's question, what is your answer to her point?\nWhy -- imagine the imaginary author of Rose v. Lundy.\nWhen I read this, I think they're worried about exhausting\nthe State claim so the State will have a chance to pass on\nit. All right. Now, what Justice Ginsburg just said\ngives the State the chance to pass on it. What is it in\nRose v. Lundy that cares whether the way you give the\nState to pass on it is to dismiss the whole thing and let\nthem pass on it or hold it on the docket and let them pass\non it or call them into your office, any other thing you\ncan think of? I mean, what is it in Rose v. Lundy that\ncares how you give the State the opportunity to pass on it\nas long as they pass on it?\nMR. ROADARMEL: Because Rose v. Lundy\ncontemplates the unexhausted claims will be presented in\nState court first, and it enforces or promotes that\nthrough what this Court has referred to in Rose v. Lundy\nas a rigorously enforced total exhaustion requirement.\nNow, if the petitioner can simply file a mixed petition in\nFederal court without any consequences either under Rose\nv. Lundy or under AEDPA, what we will have is a situation\nwhere petitioners have an incentive to file mixed\npetitions in Federal court instead of presenting their\nunexhausted claims in State court first.\nContrary to this Court's holding in Duncan v.\nWalker that AEDPA is not indifferent between State and\nFederal filings, but promotes and encourages the filing of\nunexhausted claims in State court first -\nQUESTION: I guess Rose v. Lundy could have --\ncould have said what is now being proposed if it had\nwanted to. I mean, Rose v. Lundy could have said -\ninstead of you have to dismiss the whole thing, they could\nhave simply said, you know, hold it in abeyance.\nMR. ROADARMEL: Yes. And in fact, this Court\nhas always disapproved of stays of -- of mixed petitions.\nQUESTION: So -- so you think -\nQUESTION: So, of course, there was no statute\nof limitations in place when Rose was decided. There\nwould have been no point to put that in the opinion when\nthere was no statute of limitations in place.\nMR. ROADARMEL: That's correct, but -\nQUESTION: Well, presumably Congress knew about\nRose v. Lundy when it enacted AEDPA and didn't indicate\nany change in Rose v. Lundy.\nMR. ROADARMEL: No. And Congress certainly, if\nit had desired a stay or contemplated a stay of\nproceedings pending exhaustion, could have put something\ninto AEDPA that -\nQUESTION: Is -- is there any indications when\nthey passed AEDPA, that the Congress was aware of the fact\nthat like two-thirds of all petitions are filed\nincorrectly in the Federal courts because they don't know\nwhere to go? I mean, these are not legally represented\npeople. Is -- I mean, I'd be interested in that. Is\nthere information there that suggests Congress focused on\nthat and said, we don't want to -- we -- we just want to\n-- is there or not?\nMR. ROADARMEL: There's nothing in the\ncongressional record to indicate that as to what\nindividual Members of Congress had before them in terms of\nstudies or other data at the time AEDPA was crafted. I'm\nnot aware. But the congressional record doesn't speak to\nthat.\nBut certainly Congress -\nQUESTION: Counsel, you're asking us in this\ncase to say that the stay and abeyance procedure is -- is\nnot a valid procedure.\nMR. ROADARMEL: Yes.\nQUESTION: And yet, it didn't occur in this\ncase. Here Mr. Ford chose dismissal without prejudice.\nThere was not a stay and abeyance used here. Why should\nwe rule on that?\nMR. ROADARMEL: Because it's -\nQUESTION: I mean, it's just you're asking us to\nreach beyond the confines of this case in doing that.\nMR. ROADARMEL: Because the correctness of the\nNinth Circuit's advisement requirements can't be\nadequately addressed or intelligently addressed without\nunderstanding what it is they promote and without\nunderstanding what the practice is of the Ninth Circuit.\nQUESTION: I would think it would. We have a\nquestion here of whether some particular advice was\nrequired, yes or no, and I don't see how we get into stay\nand abeyance in this case properly.\nMR. ROADARMEL: Well, because -\nQUESTION: Six of the seven circuits allow it I\nknow, but I don't see how we -- we get into it here.\nMR. ROADARMEL: Because the Ninth Circuit\nmajority concluded that the failure to advise in the\nmanner in which they thought was appropriate was improper\nand prejudicial because they assumed that had the\nadvisement been given with regard to the dismissal of\nunexhausted claims as a precondition to the consideration\nof a motion to stay, that Ford would have dismissed his\nunexhausted claims. And in doing so, the district court\nwould have been required to grant the motion to stay. In\nfact, the majority concludes it would have been abuse of\ndiscretion not to do so. So it's inextricably bound in\nthe advisement requirement in this case.\nQUESTION: But we could rule, I suppose, that\nthe advice was unnecessary when leaving open the question\nof whether the stay and abey proceeding is permissible or\ndesirable, whatever.\nMR. ROADARMEL: Yes, I believe that's true.\nQUESTION: And there's also a second question\npresented about the relation back. I -- I hope you'll\ntake an opportunity to state your point of view on that.\nMR. ROADARMEL: Yes. The Ninth Circuit, after\nconcluding that the advisements that were given in this\ncase were inadequate and misleading, fashioned a remedy\nfor that particular error which it believed occurred by\nway of applying rule 15(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure in a manner that no other circuit court has ever\napplied before. In fact, three prior panels of the Ninth\nCircuit itself concluded that relation back would not\napply under these circumstances because there's nothing to\nwhich the subsequent proceeding can relate back.\nQUESTION: But the Ninth Circuit did that only\nbecause their own precedents said all you can stay is the\nFederal claim. You can't stay the entire petition. That\nwas the preliminary to doing this fancy 15(c) application.\nMR. ROADARMEL: Yes, but in doing so, what the\nNinth Circuit majority did was have a subsequent\nproceeding relate back to a prior proceeding that had been\ndismissed and was no longer pending.\nQUESTION: If the Ninth Circuit decided or if we\ndecided that equitable tolling is permissible in this\ncase, what -- what procedure should be adopted to reflect\nthat rule? I know that's maybe not -- not your position,\nbut if that -- if that were the holding, how -- how would\nthat work? And -- and how is that any different than\nrelation back?\nMR. ROADARMEL: Well, it's -- it's difficult to\nsay because equitable tolling has been applied differently\nin different situations. The Ninth Circuit itself applies\nit in a very different fashion than it was applied in this\ncase. I suppose equitable tolling could be applied to\ntoll the limitation period during the pendency of the\nfirst set of proceedings, the 1997 proceedings, up to the\ntime that the claims were -- or the petitions were\ndismissed as unexhausted. That would leave Ford with 5\ndays to file his unexhausted claims in State court,\nexhaust, and -- and then return with those claims to\nFederal court.\nQUESTION: Let -- let me ask you this somewhat\nrelated question. You look at the records that the -\nthat's presented -- the petitions that are presented to\nthe district courts through their magistrates, and they're\nbewildering. The petitioner really restates a claim in\nthree or four different ways to make sure he's left\nnothing out. And the -- the district courts are -- are\nvery busy.\nSuppose you have a sort of Johnny-on-the-spot,\nprompt attorney at -- at the habeas level in a Federal\ncourt and he files on day one. He has got a year but he\nfiles on day one. The district court just doesn't get\naround to it until, say, the 10th month, and then it says,\noh, well, this has -- this has some unexhausted claim.\nAny relief for the -- or even on day 360. Any relief\navailable there for the petitioner?\nMR. ROADARMEL: It certainly wouldn't appear to\nbe the case under AEDPA because AEDPA doesn't toll the\nlimitation period during pendency of the Federal habeas\nproceeding, and that's very clear, we believe, from the\nstatute itself. So an individual filing a petition in\nFederal court is well advised, of course, to ensure that\nall the claims are fully exhausted.\nThe Eighth Circuit in Akins v. Kenney suggested\nthat where a petitioner is concerned that any of his\nclaims may be unexhausted, he's well advised under AEDPA\nto present those claims in State court first and\naccomplish two goals simultaneously. First, he exhausts\nbeyond any doubt, and second, he tolls the limitation\nperiod during the pendency of that proceeding.\nQUESTION: But -- but in my hypothetical\ndistrict judge number one rules in a week. District judge\nnumber two waits 300 days. The petitioner is in the same\nposition in either case in your view.\nMR. ROADARMEL: Yes, because I think the\npetitioner has to contemplate the vagaries of any kind of\njudicial interpretation or ruling on his matters, and that\nmay depend upon the particular court. It may depend upon\nthe caseload. It may depend upon the particular matter\nthat's put before the court, the number of claims, the\ncomplexity, and so on. That's always going to vary in any\ncase. A petitioner who files a one-claim petition will\nmost assuredly receive a quicker resolution of that than\nthe petitioner who files a 200-page petition containing\nhundreds of claims. That's just in the nature of any kind\nof adjudication in any kind of court.\nAnd that has to be contemplated and anticipated\nby any would-be Federal habeas petitioner because if that\npetitioner files a mixed petition under AEDPA, the clock\nkeeps ticking during the pendency of that Federal habeas\nproceeding no matter how long or how short. So, again,\nhe's well advised, as the Eighth Circuit noted, to file\nany claims that he's unsure about in State court first.\nAnd that's what AEDPA contemplates, as this Court\nconcluded in Duncan v. Walker.\nTo allow petitioners to file mixed petitions in\nFederal court without any consequences and -- and to do so\nin the manner in which the Ninth Circuit contemplates it\nhere and in other cases would eviscerate AEDPA's\nlimitation period because, as we point out in our\nbriefing, a petitioner could well file a mixed petition\ncontaining only one exhausted claim, confident that all of\nhis unexhausted claims will be purged from the petition,\nthe remaining exhausted claims stayed, and those purged\nclaims, following exhaustion, will be added back to the\nState petition, no matter that they were pursued in State\ncourt after the expiration of the limitation period, and\nthey will be deemed timely by the Ninth Circuit.\nQUESTION: Well, of course, that -- that would\n-- that may well be the Ninth Circuit rule, but you could\nalso have a stay and abey rule in which in order to -- to\ngrant the petitioner time to go back and -- and litigate\nthe State claims, he has to make a -- a showing first that\nthere is some reason to excuse his delay, in other words,\na -- a kind of an equitable tolling argument at the\nthreshold. And -- and if -- if that were the requirement,\nthen the -- the scenario that you just -- just outlined\nwould -- would not be an objection.\nMR. ROADARMEL: Well, I think the problem with\nthat approach, first of all, with regard to the\napplication of equitable tolling to AEDPA, is that AEDPA\nitself doesn't contemplate the application of such\ntolling.\nQUESTION: So you're -- you're saying that --\nthat there cannot be equitable tolling under AEDPA?\nMR. ROADARMEL: It certainly seems foreclosed by\nthis Court's holdings in United States v. Beggerly, United\nStates v. Brockamp, and Lampf v. Gilbertson. In all of\nthose cases, this Court concluded, in reviewing Federal\nlimitation periods, that because the statutes contain\ntolling provisions within them, it would be inconsistent,\nincompatible with those statutes to apply equitable\ntolling. Congress had spoken as to the circumstances\nunder which tolling could be applied.\nIn Beggerly, in particular, this Court concluded\nthat under the Federal Quiet Title Act, equitable tolling\nwould be inapplicable because there was already an accrual\nor tolling provision built in that provided that the\nlimitation period did not begin to run until the plaintiff\nknew or reasonably should have known of the claim of the\nUnited States.\nAEDPA contains a very similar provision in\nsection 2244(d)(1), subsection (D), which provides that\nthe limitation period does not begin to run until the\npetitioner was aware of the factual predicate of the claim\nor claims through the exercise of due diligence.\nIn Brockamp, this Court commented upon the\ntolling provisions in the IRS tax refund statute and noted\nthat because they were numerous and very specific,\nequitable tolling likewise would be incompatible with the\nstatute.\nAEDPA also contains very specific tolling\nprovisions, beyond the one that I just described, tolling\nwhere there is a properly filed State post-conviction or\nother collateral application, tolling where, for instance,\nunconstitutional State action leads to an impediment to\nfiling, tolling where this Court issues a ruling on an\nissue of Federal constitutional law that's made\nretroactively applicable to cases on collateral review.\nQUESTION: Leaving aside tolling, you said\nsomething I didn't quite grasp; that is, if you allowed\nthe Federal petition to sit while you went to State court,\nall this is well within the 12-month period. You're in\nState court, you exhaust everything there. The statute is\ntolled during that time. Then you come back to Federal\ncourt and you -- as long as you're still within the 12\nmonths, you're okay. It doesn't gut the statute of\nlimitations. It just recognizes that it's tolled while\nyou're in State court.\nMR. ROADARMEL: I'm sorry. I misunderstood your\nhypothetical, Your Honor. If claims are presented in\nState court, prior to the expiration of the limitation\nperiod, yes, they will toll the limitation period. The\nproblem with stay and abeyance under that situation,\nhowever, is that it actually gives the petitioner greater\nbenefits under AEDPA than he received prior to the\nenactment of AEDPA.\nPrior to the enactment of AEDPA, mixed petitions\nin -- in certain circuits would actually, instead of being\ndismissed, have their unexhausted claims purged, and the\npetitioner would go back to State court and exhaust those\nclaims. But the purged petition, the purged Federal\nhabeas petition, would go forward and be resolved\nexpeditiously. It would not be stayed.\nAnd that I think was the basis of the\nplurality's warning in Rose v. Lundy that where a\npetitioner chooses that course of action, he will be\nbarred from having his refiled claims considered on the\nmerits because they will consist of a second or successive\napplication. They will consist of a second or successive\napplication only if the purged Federal habeas petition\ngoes forward. If it's stayed, there will never be a\nsecond or successive application relating to those claims.\nAnd that would, I think, vitiate not only rule 9(b) of the\nrules governing -\nQUESTION: Are you now questioning the propriety\nof -- let's just stick with the Rose v. Lundy the way it\nwas. You have the Federal claim and the State claims.\nYou lop off the State claims. Are you saying the Federal\ncourt can't say, well, I'm going to let this Federal claim\nsit until the State is through? Why should I adjudicate\nit? Maybe he'll prevail on some claim in the State court.\nMR. ROADARMEL: Well, this Court has never\nintimated that that wouldn't be an appropriate procedure.\nIn fact, under Rose v. Lundy, in -\nQUESTION: That it would or wouldn't?\nMR. ROADARMEL: It would not. In -- in\nMcCleskey v. Zant, when this Court talked about second or\nsuccessive applications and abuse of the writ, it\ncontemplated or presumed that that procedure if followed\nunder Rose v. Lundy would lead to those refiled claims\nconstituting second or successive applications.\nQUESTION: So are you saying that the Federal\ncourt would have no choice under the -- we'll keep the\nFederal claim in Federal court, no choice but to go full\nsteam ahead on that claim?\nMR. ROADARMEL: I think so because to do\notherwise would be inconsistent with Rose v. Lundy, rule\n9(b), but it would also be inconsistent with AEDPA because\nAEDPA contains a provision in section 2244(b)(1) of title\n28 of the United States Code that requires claims that are\ndismissed from an initial petition and submitted as a\nsecond or successive application to be dismissed.\nIf we're always going to stay mixed petitions,\npending the exhaustion of even timely presented\nunexhausted claims, it certainly leads one to wonder what\nthe purpose of section 2244(b)(1) would be. That also\nappears to contemplate what the plurality suggested in\nRose v. Lundy, which is that the purged Federal habeas\npetition goes full speed ahead, to use your words, and\nthat it's not, in fact, stayed.\nTo stay the Federal habeas petition under those\ncircumstances would also result in delay, which is\nsomething that is inimical to AEDPA. As a number of lower\ncourts have pointed out, one of the primary purposes of\nAEDPA is to tighten the Federal habeas process.\nQUESTION: Am I wrong in thinking some Federal\ncourts did that and after exhaustion was over, the case\ncame back and -- with now the State claims added in?\nMR. ROADARMEL: No, you're not wrong in thinking\nthat. In fact, the Third Circuit in Crews v. Horn follows\nthat particular procedure.\nQUESTION: The Third Circuit follows what I -- I\nsuggested to you might, in this post-AEDPA world, be\nappropriate, that is, to say we're going to stay -- we're\ngoing to let the whole complaint sit here.\nMR. ROADARMEL: Yes.\nQUESTION: Not -- we're not going to lop off the\nState claims. We just won't turn to it till the State\ngets finished.\nMR. ROADARMEL: Yes, that's correct.\nUnless the Court has any further questions, I'd\nlike to reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Roadarmel.\nMs. Bassis, we'll hear from you. Am I\npronouncing your name correctly?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA M. BASSIS\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. BASSIS: Yes, you are, Mr. Chief Justice.\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:\nWhen this Court adopted the total exhaustion\nrule in Rose, there was no statute of limitations for the\nfiling of Federal habeas petitions, and a prisoner seeking\nto file a second Federal petition, after fully exhausting\nState remedies, faced no time bar. But AEDPA added to the\nmix a 1-year statute of limitations, which in many cases,\nsuch as Mr. Ford's, converts the choices under Rose into a\ncomplete bar on Federal habeas corpus review.\nQUESTION: Well, isn't it reasonable to -- at\nleast one view, to think that Congress -- we think\nCongress legislates in the light of existing law or\nexisting rules from this Court, that that's exactly what\nCongress intended?\nMS. BASSIS: No, I disagree, Your Honor. What\nRose said is that a prisoner be afforded a choice, and\nthat choice involves either proceeding on exhausted claims\nand deleting the unexhausted or dismissing the petition\nwithout prejudice to a right to return.\nNo one ever suggested in Rose that the\npetitioner would lose the right to have even his exhausted\nclaims heard on the merits. In order to avoid the\nexhaustion requirement from becoming what would, in\neffect, be a trap for the unwary pro se prisoner requires\nnothing more than adding a sentence to what Rose already\nrequires, a sentence made critical by AEDPA, which was\nnonexistent at the time of Rose.\nThere is no need for warning, however, if the\ncourt issues a stay. The lower courts almost unanimously\ndo so and endorse State procedures where the failure to do\nso would result in a forfeiture of the right to Federal\nhabeas review.\nQUESTION: Well, if -- if you say there's no\nneed for a warning, then do you think the Ninth Circuit\nwas mistaken here to require a warning?\nMS. BASSIS: No, I don't, not under the\ncircumstances of this case. First of all, the Ninth\nCircuit's stay procedure is somewhat unusual. It makes it\nincumbent upon the prisoner litigant to withdraw his\nunexhausted claims and then renew a motion to stay. So\nthe motion to stay is at the defendant's or the\npetitioner's election.\nBut without being apprised of that peculiar\nprocedure, Mr. Ford was not informed as to his choice of\noptions with regard to amendment. The only choices he was\ngiven were the two choices under Rose: delete the\nunexhausted claims and proceed on the exhausted or\ndismissal of the entire petition without prejudice, an\noption which was illusory at the time it was given to him\nbecause of the running of the limitations period.\n57 percent of the habeas petitions filed are\ndismissed for want of exhaustion.\nQUESTION: Were there -- were there any\npotential equitable tolling arguments open to him other\nthan based on the so-called misleading advice?\nMS. BASSIS: Well, I believe that there were.\nQUESTION: In other words, was it absolutely\nclear at the time that he could not come back?\nMS. BASSIS: Well --\nQUESTION: Do you agree he had no -- no basis to\nargue that he could come back?\nMS. BASSIS: Well, the issue is that he had a\npotential argument, but I don't know what Mr. Ford knew at\nthat time in terms of the availability of equitable\ntolling. He certainly didn't know about the availability\nof filing a contemporaneous writ petition in State court\nin order to toll the limitations period. Had he done so,\nmost assuredly he would not have pursued the option of\nmotions to stay, which he filed contemporaneously with his\nwrit. I doubt that he also knew about equitable tolling,\nstatutory tolling, or really the statute of limitations\nand how that was calculated. All he knew is that there\nwas 1 year, and he filed in time.\nBut he also did so by simultaneously filing a\nmotion to stay. However, without -- or without knowledge\nat the time the court made a judicial disposition of Mr.\nFord's petitions, that he could elect a stay procedure,\nthe court -- he -- he merely went with the option of\ndismissal without prejudice. That decision was not\ninformed absent further information about the availability\nof the stay.\nQUESTION: What should be the rule if the habeas\npetitioner files in -- in Federal habeas on claims one,\ntwo and three, and those have already been exhausted? But\nthen a week after he files in the Federal court, makes a\ntimely filing, he says, my heavens, I have claim number\nfour, and he files that in the State court. Does that\nstay claims one, two, and three in the Federal court?\nMS. BASSIS: Well, if it's filed untimely, I\ndon't know how it would absent a stay unless the court\ngranted a stay -\nQUESTION: So the court -- so the Federal court\nalways has to file a stay when it knows that claim four\nhas just been filed in the State court?\nMS. BASSIS: No. I believe that a court, when\nit determines that a petition is unexhausted, may on its\nown -- has the discretionary authority, taking many\nfactors into consideration, to grant a stay on its own and\ndelete the unexhausted claims.\nQUESTION: But the -- the Ninth Circuit opinion\nsuggests that a district court really doesn't have\ndiscretion. It's -- to me it suggested that the district\ncourt had to do this.\nMS. BASSIS: Under Ninth Circuit precedent, the\n-- the Ninth Circuit believed that a district court lacks\ndiscretion to stay a mixed petition. I actually believe\nthat courts have broader authority than what the Ninth\nCircuit held. The discretionary authority to stay is part\nof the inherent power of the courts, and courts routinely\nstay matters pending before them while there -- a\ndetermination of independent matters relating to the case\nare being made.\nQUESTION: So if district judge had advised the\npetitioner of the Ninth Circuit law, the district judge\nwould have been wrong.\nMS. BASSIS: I'm sorry. Pardon?\nQUESTION: If the district court -- based on\nwhat you say, if the district court had advised the\npetitioner of what the Ninth Circuit law was, the district\ncourt would have been wrong, because you say the Ninth\nCircuit is wrong.\nMS. BASSIS: I'm not -- I'm saying that the\nNinth Circuit followed its own precedent, but I'm saying\nthat the power to stay is broader than what the Ninth\nCircuit precedent currently allows. I do believe the\ncourts -\nQUESTION: Well, all this -- all this seems to\nme a good argument that the -- that the district courts\nshouldn't have to advise clients of their rights. It's\nthe -- the job of the client to figure that out.\nMS. BASSIS: I believe that that's impossible\nwithout further information regarding the choices under\nRose. The reason the Court ruled as it did is because pro\nse -- 93 percent of the habeas petitioners are proceeding\nin pro se. Mindful of the fact that pro se litigants\nrequire certain procedural protections, the Court stepped\nin and said that ceratin advisements are required in -- in\norder to -- to assure that there is no unwarranted\nforfeiture of the right to Federal -\nQUESTION: But it's -- it can be a very\ncomplicated question to know what time is left to make a\nState claim. The court is often not in a -- a good\nposition to even know that information as required by the\nNinth Circuit.\nMS. BASSIS: Justice O'Connor, I agree with you,\nbut I'm not advocating that the court calculate the\nlimitations period. What I'm requesting is not -\nQUESTION: Well, the -- the Ninth Circuit ruling\nseems very broad. Are -- are you suggesting that some\nlesser notification would be adequate?\nMS. BASSIS: I'm -- I'm requesting a specific\nnotification, not an advisement, but a warning, and I\nbelieve that there is a distinction. But what I propose\nthat the circuit courts be required to give, where a mixed\npetition is filed, is after the Rose options are afforded\nto the prisoner, they also be told prisoners have a 1\nyear period, generally starting when their conviction\nbecomes final and excluding the time when a State post\nconviction application is pending, in which to file a\nFederal habeas corpus petition, absent cause for equitable\ntolling. Before deciding to dismiss your petition to\nexhaust claims, you should determine whether your 1-year\nperiod has expired and, if not, how much time remains.\nIt requires no additional burden for the\ndistrict court to give this kind of admonition or this\nkind of warning. The court is not required to calculate\nthe limitations period, and I agree with Your Honor. At\nthe time that this decision is made, the court probably\ndoesn't have a sufficient record to make -- to undergo the\ncomplex task of computing the limitations period and\nmaking that decision.\nQUESTION: If that's so -\nQUESTION: That's the problem -\nQUESTION: If -- if that's so, Ms. Bassis, why\ndo you not agree that the Third Circuit's approach in\nCrews v. Horn is the right one? It's the simplest, just\nto say you don't have to tell the -- the petitioner, you\ndon't have to read any particular litany. You just say\nwe'll put the Federal complaint on ice while he goes off\nto -- to the State court.\nMS. BASSIS: Well, I agree with Your Honor\ncompletely. And in fact, I don't believe that warnings\nare necessary if stays are permitted. In fact, it would\nmake the stays essentially superfluous, but a stay is -- a\nwarning is necessary if there is no stay.\nNow, one of the cases cited by the petitioner\nSlayton was cited for the proposition that the court lacks\nauthority to stay a mixed petition. Slayton is\ndistinguishable in that, first of all, it didn't involve a\nmixed petition. It involved a singular claim. And the\nState in that case argued that the claim, the senility of\nthe trial court judge, was a matter, a sensitive matter,\nexclusively of State court concern. So for that reason,\nthis Court held that a stay was inappropriate. Yet, at\nthe same time, it acknowledged --\nQUESTION: Before -- before we -- we launch into\nthe -- into the stay alternative, I -- I'd like to finish\nup the -- the advisement alternative. This is not the\nonly situation in which pro se litigants would profit from\nsome good advice from the court. We generally do not\nrequire the courts to -- to act as counsel for the\nlitigants, if only for the reason that they may give wrong\nadvice, in which case you will -- you -- you will have an\nequitable -- an equitable claim. What -- what is\ndistinctive about -- about this area that -- that we\nshould depart from that rule?\nMS. BASSIS: Because of the right of Federal\nhabeas corpus review. This is a very, very significant\nright, one of the last equitable bastions that remain\navailable to a litigant to challenge their State court\nconviction.\nQUESTION: Well, there are a lot of other\nsignificant rights that -- that pro se litigants bring\nbefore courts, and -- and I'm -- I'm just resistant to the\nidea that, in addition to the requirements that the\nConstitution imposes to give counsel to -- to litigants,\nwe're -- we're going to add on that a -- a requirement in\nsome situations that the court act as counsel for the\nlitigants.\nMS. BASSIS: I understand. However, this Court\nalready requires advisements in certain limited instances\nin recognition of the fact that pro se litigants' rights\nrequire careful protection.\nQUESTION: Well, what is that? I -- I think we\n-- we do it where it's necessary to assure, for example,\nthe -- the constitutional validity of a confession.\nMS. BASSIS: That's true, but this Court -\nQUESTION: But that's -- that's not a matter of,\nyou know, legal advice as to how you should proceed with\nyour litigation.\nMS. BASSIS: That's true, and that constitutes\nan advisement as distinguished from a warning. However,\nin United States v. Castro, this Court did require certain\nlimited advisements when recharacterizing a motion for\nrelief.\nQUESTION: But that was -- that was when the\ncourt was doing something on its own.\nMS. BASSIS: True, and this is -- this -- the\nadvisement or the warning that I'm requesting is done in\norder to effectuate the choices under Rose.\nQUESTION: Well, I think it -\nQUESTION: Those are two different things.\nQUESTION: I think it's really a -- a major\ndeparture from -- from the -- the position that the Court\nin -- in common law jurisprudence has occupied. It would\nbe the first time that I know of where, not on -- not\nbecause of something the court itself is doing, the court\nhas to provide legal advice to a -- to -- to an indigent\nprisoner.\nMS. BASSIS: Well, in light of Rose v. Lundy, I\nbelieve that the options afforded are misleading. And\nthis Court never -- never intended that those options be\nexercised in a manner that would forfeit the right --\nresult in a forfeiture of the right to Federal review.\nQUESTION: How do you know what the Court\nintended in Rose v. Lundy, other than reading the opinion?\nMS. BASSIS: Well, it appears that -- that\nbeginning with the line of cases, Rose starts a line of\ncases. Two other significant ones are this Court's\nopinions in Slack and in Martinez which affirmed a right\nof return following exhaustion. And it said that that\nright of return, where the first petition was filed\nwithout a determination on the merits because either -\nQUESTION: But that was an -- was an\ninterpretation of AEDPA.\nMS. BASSIS: Yes, exactly. But they were not -\nbut the ensuing application was not deemed to be second or\nsuccessive and it approved a right of return.\nIn this -- in this particular case, the\noperation of -- the impact of AEDPA on Rose v. Lundy\noperates as a bar to the right of return in the event the\ndefendant files a mixed petition.\nQUESTION: Well, but it -- it certainly makes it\nmore difficult for the defendant. But, you know, Congress\nwasn't trying to make things easy for defendants in AEDPA.\nMS. BASSIS: That's true, but Congress also\nnever prohibited the choices that have been afforded under\nRose. And in order to implement those choices, I believe\nan additional sentence is necessary and is made critical\nby the adoption for the first time of a 1-year limitations\nperiod in order to ensure that prisoners do not lose this\nvery important right to Federal writ relief.\nAs far as the operation of the relation back\ndoctrine under rule 15(c), I believe that that was a\nremedial device that was adopted by the Ninth Circuit in\norder to restore Mr. Ford -\nQUESTION: But there wasn't a second petition\nthere to which it could relate back. I don't see how we\ncould possibly sustain that -\nMS. BASSIS: That's true.\nQUESTION: -- order of the Ninth Circuit. That\njust came out of no place. There wasn't anything to which\nit could relate back.\nMS. BASSIS: Unless, of course, one follows the\nrationale of the opinion, which is that the petitions\nshould have been stayed not dismissed, and therefore to\nrestore Mr. Ford to the position he was in previously -\nQUESTION: But there wasn't a stay order. I\nmean, that -- that's just manufacturing something. In\nthis case the petitions were dismissed.\nMS. BASSIS: That's true, and other cases faced\nwith that kind of situation have either used their\nequitable authority to reinstate the improperly dismissed\npetitions or have used the doctrine of nunc pro tunc,\neither of which would be available.\nIn any event, the Ninth Circuit -\nQUESTION: Well, why would -- I mean, have we\nsanctioned the use of, quote, nunc pro tunc, closed quote,\nin similar situations to this?\nMS. BASSIS: In Anthony v. Cambra, that's what\nthe Ninth Circuit used.\nQUESTION: I said have we.\nMS. BASSIS: No, I don't believe it has, Your\nHonor, and I believe the reason for that is because this\nis a relatively -- this case -- this is the first case to\nhave gone this far.\nQUESTION: But in any case, your client would be\nin exactly the same position that the Ninth Circuit tried\nto put your client in if the Ninth Circuit had simply said\na -- a mistake was made, either because there was\nmisleading advice or because there was a failure to give\nthe advice that we say should have been given, and we're\nsimply going to put him back in the position that he would\nhave been in had there not been that mistake, i.e., put\nhim back with a petition before the district court just as\nthere was within the -- the 1-year period.\nMS. BASSIS: Yes, taking -\nQUESTION: So -- so the relation back is simply\n-- well, it's -- I guess it's one way of explaining\nsomething that the court, on your view simply under its\npower to correct an error, could have done.\nMS. BASSIS: Exactly, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: On your view, Ms. Bassis, would there\nbe any disincentive for a litigant to bring a mixed\npetition, to come to the Federal court first rather than\nto go to the State courts, which is certainly what -- what\nAEDPA contemplates? What -- what disincentive is there?\nMS. BASSIS: Well -\nQUESTION: What does he -- what does he have to\nlose by just marching off to Federal court with all his\nclaims?\nMS. BASSIS: Well, first of all, he loses\nprecious time. Most of these litigants believe that\nthey're -- they've been unfairly convicted. Many are\nserving life terms, and they want to have -- they're\ninterested in an expeditious resolution of their claim.\nThey want to do it right. They want to have their claim\nheard on the merits as quickly as possible. They're not\ninterested in delay. And so, they would not choose a\nprocedure that would cause them to return to State court.\nIt's not in their interest to do so.\nQUESTION: Well, it isn't there -- in their\ninterest, but they're not lawyers.\nMS. BASSIS: That's -\nQUESTION: And they say, you know, I don't know\nwhich ones need exhaustion and which ones don't. I'm just\ngoing to dump the whole thing onto Federal court. Won't\nthat happen in every situation? And is that -- is that\nwhat AEDPA contemplated?\nMS. BASSIS: I don't think AEDPA contemplated\nthat -- well, in fact, I believe AEDPA recognized the\npossibility that mixed petitions would be filed.\nAnd indeed, the exhaustion requirement is an\nextremely difficult one both for lawyers and pro se\nlitigants alike. By the time a judicial determination has\nbeen made, on average 263 days go by after that Federal\nwrit petition has been filed. So you can easily have a\nsituation where your pro se litigant filed well in\nadvance, maybe 3 months after the limitations period\nstarted, only the -- to find that by the time he -- a\njudicial determination is made, that he's failed to\nexhaust the -\nQUESTION: Would -- would you have a reason to\nobject to a -- a modification of what the Ninth Circuit\nwas talking about? And instead simply of this kind of\nautomatic stay and -- and abeyance procedure, there were\nengrafted on it a further condition, and the condition be\nthat before the -- the stay be granted and -- and the\npetition kept in abeyance, the -- the defendant would have\nto show that there was some good reason for or excuse for\nhis failure to exhaust the -- the unexhausted claims.\nThat would accommodate -- the reason I raise it is that\nwould accommodate the -- the issue, at least in part, that\nJustice Scalia is raising and it would address the case\nthat your answer didn't address, and that is, of -- of the\nprisoner under a death sentence who does not want fast\naction at all. He wants the slowest action possible.\nWould there be an objection to -- to engrafting that\nfurther condition of a defendant must excuse failure to\nthe Ninth Circuit's procedure?\nMS. BASSIS: No. In -- in fact, I believe that\nthat condition is inherent in a court's discretionary\nauthority to stay. It can take into consideration a -- a\nvariety of factors, including whether or not the\npetitioner has been diligent in exhausting. The reason -\nQUESTION: Justice Souter is suggesting that it\nmust take into account that factor.\nMS. BASSIS: I believe it already does, but I -\nI would have no problem with that.\nQUESTION: What -- what would be a good excuse?\nThat I -- I didn't know enough?\nMS. BASSIS: No.\nQUESTION: Would it -- would it be an excuse\nthat I'm not a lawyer and I didn't realize I had to\nexhaust?\nMS. BASSIS: No. I believe one of them would be\nthat I didn't receive my transcripts from my State\nappellate attorney, and I didn't know what claims were\nthere because I didn't receive the information. The other\n-- one of the other reasons -\nQUESTION: He's bringing the claim in Federal\ncourt.\nMS. BASSIS: Yes.\nQUESTION: How could he not know the claim?\nHe's bringing it in Federal court, and -- and the\nobjection is you should have brought it in State court\nfirst. What possible excuse could he have? I mean, the\nnormal excuse is going to be, you know, I'm just -- I'm\njust a simple prisoner. I'm not a lawyer. I -- I had no\nidea I had to exhaust.\nMS. BASSIS: Well, for example, a defendant may\nhave had a direct appeal, but it doesn't mean that other\nclaims such as ineffective assistance of counsel claims,\nwhich normally must be raised in a writ, have been pursued\nat all. This requires reliance on extrajudicial evidence.\nNormally counsel, at least in California, appointed\ncounsel in some districts, is not authorized to file a\nwrit petition without express permission of the court of\nappeal. Very often those counsel don't pursue that, and\ntherefore the writable issues, the -- which rely on\nextrajudicial evidence, have not been developed, and they\nhave -- those claims have, therefore, not been exhausted.\nSo there are a number of reasons why a pro se prisoner\nlitigant may find that certain viable claims, meritorious\nclaims, have not been exhausted -\nQUESTION: Well, I don't -- I don't certainly\nsee that condition in -- in the procedure that the Ninth\nCircuit has adopted, that it -- there has to be some\njustification for not having exhausted. Is -- is that set\nforth in -- in the Ninth Circuit's procedure?\nMS. BASSIS: No, it isn't, but Your Honor -\nQUESTION: That's new to me.\nMS. BASSIS: -- a stay is discretionary, and in\ndeciding whether or not a stay is appropriate, the court\ntakes into factors such as a petitioner's dilatoriness,\nwhether or not they're attempting to evade a time\nlimitation, whether or not their efforts are in good\nfaith. I believe that these are all factors that the\ndistrict courts already are mindful of.\nQUESTION: But you -- and you disagree then with\nthe Ninth Circuit which said, in effect, that it is -- the\ndistrict courts don't have discretion. They must grant a\nstay.\nMS. BASSIS: No. I -- I disagree with the Ninth\nCircuit's opinion that it lacks authority to stay a mixed\nopinion. I believe that all district courts have the\ninherent authority to stay a mixed opinion. And in fact,\nthere's considerable authority for it based upon this\nCourt's own precedent.\nQUESTION: But perhaps you and I don't read the\nNinth Circuit's opinion the same way insofar as the -- the\nauthority of a district court to -- in its discretion to\nturn down a stay application. I thought the Ninth Circuit\nsaid that there was no discretion.\nMS. BASSIS: No. I believe that what the court\nsaid, in a circumstance -- it -- it -- I agree with Your\nHonor. On one hand, it appears to speak in mandatory\nterms. On the other hand, I believe that the issue that\nthere may potentially be a forfeiture of the right to\nFederal review is a factor which the district court must\nalso take into consideration in deciding whether or not to\nenter a stay. So it's just one additional factor. While\nit did appear that the Ninth Circuit spoke in mandatory\nterms, I don't believe it's mandated, the -- the decision\nof whether or not a district court should stay a mixed\npetition.\nAnd I believe it also has authority under this\nCourt's decisions in Nelson and in Wade to stay an unmixed\npetition, which I know is not the issue before us with\nregard to this case.\nQUESTION: Can you give us any idea, perhaps\nanecdotally, about the number of -- of times we have mixed\npetition arguments or questions about mixed petitions? Is\nit 10 percent of the time, do you think, or 90 percent of\nthe time? I see them all the time.\nThe reason I ask is you say the district judge\nhas discretion to stay and abey in every case. This is a\n-- a huge undertaking by the judicial system to make AEDPA\nwork, and AEDPA was supposed to simplify things.\nMS. BASSIS: Well, AEDPA was supposed to\nsimplify things, but it was adopted 8 years ago and we're\nstill litigating nearly every sentence of AEDPA. So I\nwish it had simplified things, but unfortunately, it is\nnot a simple statute to understand.\nQUESTION: Do -- do you have any idea of the -\nthe number of instances in which there's an allegation of\na mixed petition?\nMS. BASSIS: I know that 57 percent of the -- of\ncases are dismissed for failure to exhaust.\nQUESTION: About 5 -- 7?\nMS. BASSIS: 5 -- 7.\nQUESTION: And is this in the Central District\nor the California or all over?\nMS. BASSIS: I think it's all over, and in fact,\nthe statistics comes from this Court's opinion in Duncan,\nand I believe it's Justice Breyer's opinion where he cites\nto the statistics.\nQUESTION: I think it was something like -- I\ngot it from some official source -- said there were about\ntwo-thirds were actually filed in the wrong court, namely\nthe Federal court. And I think it was 57 percent of those\nthat were dismissed.\nMS. BASSIS: Right, for failure to exhaust.\nQUESTION: That's where it came from. That's\nwhat -\nMS. BASSIS: So what I am proposing is that the\nCourt permit -- approve a stay of mixed petitions, but if\nnot, that it gives a warning to pro se litigants about how\nthe Rose choices are effectuated, that it gives the Rose\nchoices and then it continues to apprise the defendant\nabout the running of the 1-year limitations period, and\nthat they essentially must calculate the limitations\nperiod on their own.\nIf the Court has no further questions.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Bassis.\nMr. Roadarmel, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. ROADARMEL, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. ROADARMEL: With the Court's permission, I'd\nlike to make four brief points.\nThe proof is in the pudding regarding stay and\nabeyance and what we're experiencing in California. We're\nexperiencing greater delays since the enactment of AEDPA\nthan we ever experienced before because of stay and\nabeyance and relation back, particularly in capital\nFederal habeas cases.\nWe make mention in footnote 1 of our reply brief\nof a capital Federal habeas case pending in the Central\nDistrict Court of California called Reno v. Woodford. In\nthat case, the district court issued a stay of the purged\npetition on May 7th, 1999 for the ostensible purpose of\nallowing the petitioner to exhaust his State court\nremedies. To date, no State court exhaustion petition has\nbeen filed. None is on the horizon. But under stay and\nabeyance and relation back, whenever one is filed and the\nclaims are exhausted and added back into the State\npetition, those claims will be deemed timely by the\ndistrict court, notwithstanding the fact that at this\npoint in time, at best, they will be presented for\nexhaustion in State court more than 5 years after the\nexpiration of AEDPA's limitation period.\nThe second point is that Ford in this case knew\nthat the 1997 petitions he filed contained unexhausted\nclaims. He admitted as much to the district court in\nconnection with our motion to dismiss those petitions.\nThat's found at pages 56 to 57 and 75 to 78 of the joint\nappendix. Ford purposely filed mixed petitions. He knew\nof the limitation period as well because he indicated in\nfilings to the district court that he was in a hurry to\nget his 1997 petitions in in time so that he would have\nthem before the court prior to the expiration of the\nlimitation period.\nWhat stay and abeyance does is reward\npetitioners like Ford who file admittedly mixed petitions\nknowing full well the identity of the unexhausted claims\nthat they're asserting. If they're aware of those\nunexhausted claims, there's no reason why those\npetitioners should not have and could not have presented\nthose claims in State court first, and they would have\nreceived a proper benefit under AEDPA by doing so. They\nwould have exhausted the claims so the Federal court could\nconsider them on the merits conceivably if there wasn't\nsome kind of default that was applicable, and they would\nalso toll the limitation period during the pendency of\nthat State proceeding.\nFord was under the misapprehension that his\nFederal filing tolled the limitation period in much the\nsame way that the petitioner in Duncan was under the\nmisapprehension that his first mixed petition tolled the\nlimitation period in that case as well. We know from\nDuncan v. Walker that it does not.\nFinally, advice regarding AEDPA's limitation\nperiod, to be meaningful at all, to be more than just a\nmeaningless gesture, has to rely on specific documents and\nhas to provide specific information that a district court\nis simply in no position to provide at the time a mixed\npetition is dismissed. The only documents a district\ncourt typically has before it at that time are documents\nrelating to filings by the petitioner in the State supreme\ncourt. The allegations contained in those documents are\nthen compared against the allegations in the Federal\nhabeas proceeding for the purpose of determining whether\nthe claims are exhausted. The court does not have before\nit the entire record of proceedings.\nAnd even if it did, there are certain\ncircumstances that would warrant tolling that would not be\ncontained in those documents and the court would not be\nable to make any kind of a reasoned decision or give any\nkind of reason or correct advice regarding the impact of\nthe limitation period on any unexhausted claims.\nStay and abeyance we believe vitiates AEDPA by\nrendering largely irrelevant the limitation period,\nrendering the State court tolling provision near\nsurplusage, and in effect, encouraging petitioners to file\nmixed petitions in Federal court instead of presenting\ntheir unexhausted claims in State court first.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nRoadarmel.\n"
