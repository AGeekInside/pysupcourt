SEYMOUR\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. SEYMOUR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe four doctors who are shareholder-directors\nof the petitioner are not employees under the ADA, the\nAmericans With Disabilities Act, because, like partners,\nthey own and manage their own clinic.\nQUESTION: What -- what is the common law rule\non respondeat superior for an ordinary corporation vis a\nvis a director? Is a director of an ordinary corporation\nan employee of the corporation?\nMR. SEYMOUR: In an ordinary corporation, the\ncommon law rule is that the employee is like a servant.\nQUESTION: Well, if -- if that's so --\nQUESTION: Well, what is your answer?\nQUESTION: I didn't hear you.\nQUESTION: I couldn't hear the response.\nMR. SEYMOUR: I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: Your answer was yes, was -- he is an\nemployee?\nMR. SEYMOUR: Yes.\nQUESTION: Okay. Well, then Darden says common\nlaw, common law says directors are employees, and these\nare directors, end of case. Why not?\nMR. SEYMOUR: Because Darden doesn't apply here.\nDarden was --\nQUESTION: Well, you didn't even cite Darden, I\ndon't think.\nMR. SEYMOUR: I believe I did.\nQUESTION: Did you?\nMR. SEYMOUR: Yes.\nQUESTION: I would think Darden would be the\nfirst place we'd look.\nMR. SEYMOUR: Well, the difference between this\ncase and Darden is significant. Darden was a case in\nwhich the Court was required to determine whether an\nindividual was an independent contractor --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. SEYMOUR: -- or an employee.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. SEYMOUR: That's not a choice here.\nQUESTION: No, but the decision has to be made\non whether these people are employees.\nMR. SEYMOUR: That's right.\nQUESTION: And Darden says, well, we're going to\nlook to the common law, so what makes you think we'd do\nsomething else in this situation?\nMR. SEYMOUR: Because there are frankly not much\ncommon law that gives us guidance on how to decide whether\na director-shareholder in a professional corporation is an\nemployee or not.\nThe -- in Darden, it cited factors that are\nreally quite good at determining whether an individual is\nan independent contractor or an employee. Those factors\ndon't work very well here, because they're not designed to\naddress the issues that we're looking at.\nThat is, for example, one of the factors that\nthe common law looks to to determine whether a -- an\nindividual is an independent contractor is whether the\nindividual provides their own tools of the trade. Well,\nthat's not the kind of factor that's going to work very\nwell in this kind of case. Therefore, we're suggesting\nthat a Darden-like analysis is very appropriate, but we\nthink that it's better to use factors such as suggested by\nthe Government in their brief, that is, the EEOC guidance,\nbecause those kinds of factors suggested in the EEOC\nguidance go the heart of the difference between\nshareholder-directors and employees.\nThe factors in Darden do not, so therefore the\nDarden factors are like trying to pound a round peg into a\nsquare hole. We shouldn't do that, because it becomes\nclumsy.\nQUESTION: It may be clumsy --\nQUESTION: But this was a case where it was very\nimportant to the shareholders in this corporation that\nthey be labeled employees for ERISA purposes. It had to\nbe -- if they weren't employees, they weren't going to be\nable to get themselves covered under the retirement plan\nas the law then was, so in -- in the ERISA context you\nwould be saying, of course they're employees. That's how\nthey qualified under ERISA. We set this thing up solely\nfor that reason.\nMR. SEYMOUR: Yes, Your Honor, except that I\nthink that the -- the tax purposes were more under the\ngeneral tax laws, not under ERISA, because they could\nestablish an ERISA plan and deduct the expenses.\nQUESTION: But didn't they -- in order to be\ncovered, didn't they have to be employees?\nMR. SEYMOUR: Yes.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. SEYMOUR: And -- and just --\nQUESTION: And they wouldn't -- on your theory,\nthey're not -- so they are employees for that purpose?\nMR. SEYMOUR: Well, they're treated as employees\nfor that purpose, but they should not be treated as\nemployees for purposes of the ADA.\nFor example, if we turn the coin over and look\nat the other side, and the Court is required to examine\nwhether someone who is labeled a partner is, in reality,\na -- an employee. If the Court finds that, looking at the\neconomic realities of that situation, that the partner is\nreally an employee, that doesn't mean that the\nnow-employer should issue W-2's, or that they should have\nbeen withholding. Those are tax issues, and they don't\nhave the same purposes as the ADA.\nQUESTION: But the -- am I wrong in thinking\nthat the -- the whole thing was set up the way it was,\ninstead of as a partnership, for the reason that these\npeople needed to be characterized as employees for\nretirement plan purposes?\nMR. SEYMOUR: Yes.\nQUESTION: And are they not also employees for\nWorker's Compensation purposes?\nMR. SEYMOUR: Under Oregon law, they can opt out\nof Worker's Compensation.\nQUESTION: But they'd have to opt out. They\nstart out by being in.\nMR. SEYMOUR: Yes.\nQUESTION: They start out as being -- do they\nget salaries?\nMR. SEYMOUR: They get salaries plus a bonus,\nwhich is the division of their profits.\nQUESTION: But they get salaries. There's\nnothing inconsistent with being, say, the president of the\ncompany and principal shareholder and being both an owner\nand an employee.\nMR. SEYMOUR: That's true. There's nothing\ninconsistent about that, and our concern with this case\nis, the court didn't go past the fact that the clinic was\norganized as a professional corporation, and when the --\nQUESTION: Why should it, because I'm still\nstuck with the language of Darden, which reads as a\ngeneral rule, when Congress has used the term, employee,\nwithout defining it, we have concluded that Congress\nintended to describe the conventional master-servant\nrelationship as understood by common law agency doctrine,\nand it says, that rule stood as an independent authority\nfor the copyright decision. So, too, should it stand\nhere.\nNow, is your view, it should not stand here in\nthis case --\nMR. SEYMOUR: That's our view.\nQUESTION: -- as sufficient?\nMR. SEYMOUR: That's our view.\nQUESTION: All right, so you're asking us to\ndepart from Darden and to make an exception from the\nDarden rule for the -- this particular act.\nMR. SEYMOUR: For this --\nQUESTION: Is that right?\nMR. SEYMOUR: For this particular circumstance,\nthat's correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Well, when you say circumstance,\nthere's a word in an act, so you're saying that the word,\nemployee, in this title of the ADA does not bear the\ncommon law definition?\nMR. SEYMOUR: Well, I think the common law\ndefinition is one thing to look at. That is the --\nQUESTION: No, no, I'm asking -- they said in\nDarden that's the end of it, and you say -- I want to be\njust clear about it. You say, it is not the end of it.\nCommon law is not the end of it.\nMR. SEYMOUR: Yes, that's what we're saying.\nQUESTION: All right, and so --\nMR. SEYMOUR: Common law is not the end of it.\nQUESTION: Okay. Now I understand.\nQUESTION: Would -- would you say that the EEOC\nguidelines and writings and treatises on the differences\nbetween professional corporations and other corporations\nmight themselves be part of what we call the common law?\nI -- I take it part of your position is based on\nthe proposition that the common law, I suppose of agency,\nup through the 1950s just didn't have much on this subject\nat all, when we're talking about the difference between\npartners and professional and -- and employees of a\nprofessional corporation. There just wasn't a corpus of\nwriting on that subject.\nMR. SEYMOUR: No, there isn't much in the common\nlaw, because a professional corporation is not a product\nof the common law, nor is a limited liability partnership,\nnor a limited liability company, and all three of those\norganizations are virtually functionally identical once\nthey're up and running. They have the same --\nQUESTION: Well, and as -- as courts begin to\nwrite about these things in the area of subchapter S\nstatus, tax status and so forth, there is an emerging\ndecisional law, at least, that's -- that's evolving, I\ntake it, and you might say that has some common law\nattributes. It might not be common law as we -- as we\nusually define it.\nMR. SEYMOUR: Attributes, yes, but not that\nfocus on this particular question, and that is whether a\nshareholder-director in a professional corporation should\nbe considered an employee for purposes of defining who --\nQUESTION: Who -- Darden also says, a couple of\npages after the quote that Justice Breyer -- since the\ncommon law test contains no shorthand formula or magic\nphrase that can be applied to find the answer, all of the\nincidents of the relationship must be assessed and weighed\nwith no one factor being decisive, which suggests a more\nfluid test, certainly, than the other language.\nMR. SEYMOUR: And a more fluid test would be\ncertainly more flexible, because --\nQUESTION: But that's exactly my point. That's\nwhy I started out asking you whether you concede that a\ndirector of a corporation is an employee under the common\nlaw, because if you concede that, you're saying that the\ncommon law fluid test ends up with the director being an\nemployee, and I take it that it's well-established a\ndirector is an employee.\nMR. SEYMOUR: Well, that's -- I -- I understood\nyour question to be --\nQUESTION: No, my question was to try to get the\nframework. Either you're saying the common law, you win,\nor you're saying, common law, I lose, but I win anyway\nbecause it's not the common law, so if you want to take\nthe tack, common law test, I still win, explain it to me.\nHow is a director ordinarily an employee, but this one\nisn't?\nMR. SEYMOUR: Well, under an ordinary\ncorporation, I think your -- your question would be yes,\nbut under a professional corporation, it's different.\nIt's much more like a partnership, because if we\nlook at the emergence of these new entities like limited\nliability partnerships, limited liability corporations,\nand professional corporations, they're all emerging for\nprofessional businesses like this clinic from sole\nproprietorships or general partnerships, and the only --\nthere's really no difference, functionally, when we look\nat those different entities.\nQUESTION: Oh, but isn't there a huge\ndifference, that they've got limited liability?\nIf you have -- the corporation is liable if you\nhave, you're incorporated? Isn't that the true with your\ncase, too?\nMR. SEYMOUR: No, the --\nQUESTION: Whereas in partnership, the\nindividuals are liable?\nMR. SEYMOUR: In the partnership, individuals\nare liable, but in a professional corporation, in a\nlimited liability partnership, in a limited liability\ncompany, the -- for professionals, those limited\nliabilities are all the same, and they're not as good as a\ngeneral corporation, or an ordinary corporation.\nIn other words, the doctors in this clinic, in a\nPC, have liability for their own acts, and limited\nvicarious liability for the acts of the other doctors.\nThat's not true inside an ordinary corporation. It is\ntrue inside a limited liability partnership and a limited\nliability company.\nQUESTION: Am I wrong in thinking that the --\nthat the individual liability is not across the board, but\nit's only for malpractice-type claims?\nMR. SEYMOUR: That's right, it's for\nmalpractice-type claims, and I think --\nQUESTION: So --\nMR. SEYMOUR: -- that's pretty much true not\njust in --\nQUESTION: But other claims against the clinic,\nit -- they -- they would have limited liability?\nMR. SEYMOUR: Yes, they do, and that's true for\nall three of those emerging types of entities,\nprofessional corporations, limited liability partnerships,\nand limited liability companies.\nQUESTION: Well, maybe there isn't -- there\nisn't any settled law, is there, that a limited liability\npartnership would not be treated the same way that this\nentity is -- is treated?\nMR. SEYMOUR: Well, for example, as a partner in\na partnership, limited liability partnership, I have\nexactly the same limits on my liability as the doctors in\nthis clinic, and I am not an employee, I'm a partner, and\nthe only difference between my status and the status of\nthese doctors is the form of the business, and that's\nreally just a label.\nQUESTION: Well, you say you're not an employee,\nbut isn't that the question we have to decide?\nMR. SEYMOUR: Well, every court that's addressed\nthe issue of whether partners are employees, including\nthis Court --\nQUESTION: Well, you wouldn't suggest that every\npartner -- no partner is ever an employee. You're not\nsuggesting that, are you? Say you've got a law firm\nthat's got 250 partners, you're going to say none of them\nare -- are employees?\nMR. SEYMOUR: I'm sure there are some who would\nsay that, but I think that what the courts need to do is\nlook at the individual, not just at a label, and look\nbeyond the label to find out, as the EEOC standards --\nQUESTION: Well, we don't have a partnership\nhere. We have a professional corporation --\nMR. SEYMOUR: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- do we not?\nMR. SEYMOUR: That's correct.\nQUESTION: That's what we're talking about.\nWe're not talking about partnership.\nMR. SEYMOUR: But I'm saying that a -- a limited\nliability partnership and a professional corporation\nshould be treated alike for purposes of the EEOC. Excuse\nme, for purposes of --\nQUESTION: But then we're away from --\nMR. SEYMOUR: Pardon me?\nQUESTION: I thought you had a very good case in\nyour brief, and then I read Darden, and I realized the\nreason I was thinking it, I was out of date and thinking\nthat Hearst was still good law. That's Frankfurter's\nopinion on employee. I thought it was a great opinion,\nall right, but I can't square that with what the Court\nsaid. That was my initial question, and I'm still there,\nbecause I haven't really heard you explain why it is that\nthe common law test won't pick up your clients.\nMR. SEYMOUR: And I'm -- if I may, the -- the\nproblem with Darden is, it's examining a different\nrelationship than we have in this case.\nIn the Darden case, the issue was whether an\nindividual was an independent contractor, and we deal with\nthose issues all the time. Our clients come and say, I\nwant to be an independent contractor, or make my employees\nindependent contractors, and we have to go through the\nbooks and say, no, we can't let you do that because of\nDarden, or whatever.\nWe don't see those kinds of circumstances in the\nlaw. There's no common law --\nQUESTION: Well, maybe the price that has to be\npaid for professionals to set up a professional\ncorporation is to be subject to the ADA, and the anti-\ndiscrimination law of title VII, and so forth, because\nthese people are going to be counted. In this case, it\nmakes a difference.\nMR. SEYMOUR: Well --\nQUESTION: Is that all bad, that they have to be\nsubject to these provisions?\nMR. SEYMOUR: The reason that it's bad -- yes,\nit is all bad.\nQUESTION: Why?\nMR. SEYMOUR: And the reason is that we should\ntreat similarly situated businesses the same, and there\nare a -- a class of partner-like or proprietor-like\nindividuals, and there is a class of employee-like\nindividuals, and just because -- let's say it starts out\nas a general partnership. Just because they shift into a\nlimited liability partnership, or a professional\ncorporation, or a limited liability company, that\nshouldn't change who belongs in which class, and if we\nlook beyond the label of professional corporation, then we\ncan see what the relationships are and therefore settle\nthat issue.\nI'd like to reserve the balance of my time for\nrebuttal.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Seymour.\nMr. Gornstein, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVING L. GORNSTEIN\nFOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it --\nmay it please the Court:\nUnder the EEOC's guidance, the question whether\nshareholder-directors are employees depends on whether\nthey operate independently and manage the business or,\ninstead, are subject to the organization's control. That\nstandard aligns the test for determining the employment\nstatus of shareholder-directors with the test that courts\nhave long used in deciding whether partners are employees.\nQUESTION: Well, do you say that the EEOC has\nadopted standards that differ from the common law, and has\nby regulation or otherwise determined that we should apply\nits test to this question?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: I guess largely, yes. The EEOC\nstarted with the common, common law right to control test\nthat is used to distinguish between independent\ncontractors and employees and adapted it to make a\ndistinction between those who were the proprietors of the\nbusiness and that business' employees, and it did so in a\nway to align its standards for looking at the question of\nshareholder-director with the same standards that have\nbeen used by all the courts in deciding whether partners\nor -- are employees\nQUESTION: And do you agree with the\npetitioner's attorney that if you look to the common law\ntest, these people would be employees?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: If you look to the Restatement\nas the measure of the common law --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: -- then generally speaking, a --\na director who didn't employ service -- perform services\nwould not have been an employee, but a director who\nperformed services would be.\nNow, the only hesitation I would have is to say\nthat the -- that at the time of the Restatement there\nwasn't -- there weren't professional corporations that\nmixed and matched features of partnership and\ncorporations, so there's not as clear an answer on that.\nQUESTION: Do we owe deference to the EEOC\nstandard?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: The -- the Court should give\nweight to the -- the EEOC's test because it reflects its\naccumulated and longstanding experience in administering\nthe act, but we're not asking for Chevron deference here.\nQUESTION: Didn't the Court say the EEOC doesn't\nget such deference? I mean, didn't -- wasn't that way\nback in the Gilbert case?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: It -- it did say that, that\nit -- it doesn't get Chevron deference. Now, there is an\nexception now. Under the ADA, the EEOC can issue\nregulations, and this Court has held that those\nregulations are entitled to Chevron deference, but this is\nguidance that applies across the board to all the\nnondiscrimination laws, and what the Court has said in\nthat context is that the EEOC's analysis gets weight, in\nlight of the fact that it has accumulated experience under\nthe law.\nQUESTION: But it would be kind of a Skidmore\ndeference.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: It would be a Skidmore\ndeference, that's correct. Now, what --\nQUESTION: I hate to be a bore on this, but will\nyou please write the two sentences for me where I have to\nsay either that, we apply the common law test, and in this\ninstance, the common law test comes out in your favor, or\nwe have to say, we don't apply the common law test because\nthe EE -- this statute is different. Which of those two\npaths, both of which could lead to your victory or your\ndefeat, do you think we should take?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Neither of those two, Justice\nBreyer.\nQUESTION: Neither, all right. Then write that\nsection of the opinion.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: I -- let me get to Darden,\nbecause I think that's the focus of your questions.\nAs we read Darden, there is language that is\ncertainly broad enough in it to say that any time you use\nthe word, employee, you mean common law employee, but I\nthink that those, what -- you have to understand Darden in\nthe context of the -- the issue it was resolving in that\ncase, and there it was trying to draw a distinction,\nwhether the term employee embraces independent\ncontractors, and in that setting, Congress had twice\namended statutes to make clear that the term, employee,\ndid not mean independent contractor after this Court has\nsaid that it could, and in that context, it makes perfect\nsense to start out with a very strong presumption that\nwhen Congress uses the term, employee, it does not mean\nindependent contractor.\nBut that's not the situation we have here, and\nin other cases where the Court has looked at statutes that\nuse common law terms, like Title VII does with respect to\nthe term, agent, it has felt a lot more freedom to adjust\nthat common law term to the purposes of the statute, and I\nwould point you to the Faragher case and the Kolstadt case\nas two examples of that, and that's what the EEOC has done\nhere.\nIt has adapted that common law principle in\nlight of the fact that we have an established tradition in\nthe courts, well-established, of looking at the question\nof partnership in a functional way, does this person\nactually operate as a proprietor of the business, or is\nthis a partner in name only, and it makes perfect sense\nfor the EEOC to apply that same kind of functional\nanalysis in deciding whether shareholder-directors are\nemployees, because for purposes of deciding who should get\nthe protection of the act, and that's what we're talking\nabout primarily here, there is no practical difference\nbetween shareholder-directors who run a business and\npartners who run a business, and so it makes sense to --\nto use the same test.\nApplying the same test also makes sense in light\nof the purposes of the small business exemption, because\nthe purpose of that exemption is to spare small businesses\nthe very substantial burdens of complying with the\nnondiscrimination laws, and those burdens are experienced\nin exactly the same way regardless of whether those who\nchoose to organize a small business do so through a\npartnership form or a corporate form, and the -- the\nanalysis that the tests should be the same across the\nboard also makes --\nQUESTION: May I ask you a question about the\napplication of your test? You -- you urge us to remand\nthe case, as I understand it --\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Yes, we do.\nQUESTION: -- to answer the question whether\nthese individuals operate independently and manage and\ncontrol the business on the one hand, or are subject to\nthe organization's control on the other, and I ask you, is\nit not possible that the same individual could meet both\nhalves of that test?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: No.\nQUESTION: Some of his duties, he'd be manager,\nand some others he'd have to respond to what the group\ntold him to do?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Well, it -- it's possible that's\ntrue, but what the EEOC's guidance --\nQUESTION: What do you do if you find such a\ncase?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: You make --\nQUESTION: With respect to surgery, he takes\norders from the directors. With respect to advising\npatients, he's on -- on his own.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: What -- what we have here under\nthe EEOC's guidance is, ultimately you make an overall\njudgment that's either-or, based on all the considerations\nin the guidance, and they are at page 9 of our brief, so\nthat, just as in the partnership context, you look at all\nof these factors, and just as you would in an independent\ncontractor status kind of situation, you look at all the\nrelevant factors, and then you make an overall judgment\nabout, essentially does this person function as a\nproprietor of the business, or is he functioning as an\nemployee of the business overall.\nQUESTION: Why isn't it simpler just to say,\nwell, they picked a corporate form with their eyes open\nbecause it was important for them to be labeled employees,\nat least for retirement purposes, so they have to take the\nbitter with the sweet. They got that qualification so\nthey could have their retirement plans, and then it's just\nmuch simpler to say, that's the form that they chose, and\nthe law for many -- in many contexts does follow what --\nthe form parties choose for their arrangement. Why\nshouldn't that be the answer?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: The -- the approach that the\nEEOC has taken is to -- is a functional approach that\ntries to treat all people alike, and to look to the real\nfunctional relationship between the individual and the\nemployee, and the fact that somebody may have chosen to do\nsomething for tax consequences, or chose to do something\nfor purposes of limiting individual liability, really\ndoesn't have anything to do with whether he is the sort of\nperson who should receive protection under the\nnondiscrimination laws, and this is ultimately what we are\ndetermining here, are these shareholder-directors people\nwho are employees and therefore receive protection under\nthe nondiscrimination laws, because it's only those people\nwho are the --\nQUESTION: Well, I thought we were looking to\nsee if some other, lower employee was covered, not these\ndirectors, and that turns on whether you count them as\nemployees --\nMR. GORNSTEIN: That's --\nQUESTION: -- or not.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: That's correct.\nQUESTION: We're not looking to see if they\nthemselves are covered under the ADA in this case.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: But in order to answer the\nquestion you have in front of you, which is, is this a\nsmall business and does this employee get protection, you\nfirst have to answer the question of, are these\nshareholder-directors employees who get protection under\nthe law, so that is the inevitable product of having to\ndecide the small business exemption, is that you have to\ndecide, these are people who get protection under the\nlaws, and it -- it's just not the case that the policies\nthat underlie decisions about incorporation having to do\nwith tax consequences and individual liability have\nanything to do with whether these are the kind of people\nwho should receive protection under the nondiscrimination\nlaws.\nQUESTION: Well, I just thought Congress was\nmore concerned with not making really small businesses\ncovered by these acts, that we weren't focused on whether\nthese professional shareholders should be covered, but\nwhether this was the kind of small business that shouldn't\nbe covered at all.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Well -- I'm sorry, Justice\nO'Connor.\nQUESTION: Is that right?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: I -- what Congress did in the\nsmall business exemption is to link the exemption to the\nnumber of people who receive protection under the laws,\nand that makes sense, because it means that at most, when\nthe small business exemption applies, at most, 14\nindividuals will be excluded who otherwise would have had\nprotection.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Gornstein.\nMr. Crispin, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CRAIG A. CRISPIN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. CRISPIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe position of the clinic and the Government in\nthis case essentially is to look to ignore the form and\nstructure of the corporate business, yet just 2 years ago,\nin Cedric Kushner versus King, this Court held that a sole\nshareholder was separate and distinct from the corporate\nstructure itself, and that's the -- the essence of the\nquestion.\nQUESTION: What kind of a legal issue was it\nthere, Mr. Crispin? What act were we construing?\nMR. CRISPIN: That was a RICO question, and the\nquestion was whether or not the two parts of the -- the\nRICO enterprise on the one hand and the -- the other\naspect of the RICO question existed with both the\nindividual sole shareholder and director of the\ncorporation as being separate and distinct from the\ncorporation itself, and in that case the Court said, you\ncannot collapse the two.\nThe defense position was, they are, in fact, the\nsame identity, and this Court said no, that's not true.\nWhat -- the corporate structure is something separate and\ndistinct, which is recognized by this Court, has been\nrecognized for years and years and years, and that that is\nsomething that cannot and should not be ignored.\nQUESTION: Well, the -- the reason we said it\nwas that we couldn't find any basis in the statutory\nhistory or the text that -- that gave us a clue that\nCongress, in effect, wanted to ignore something which is\nsuch hornbook law.\nThe argument on the other side, I think, is that\nthere is a reason to think Congress would want to look\nat -- at nontraditional concepts here. The argument is\nthat the common law definition of employee does not\naxiomatically apply because it's not addressing the issue\nthat Congress was addressing in that -- in this statute.\nThe issue that Congress was addressing in this statute, as\nI understand the argument, in fact taking the -- the very\nwords that Mr. Gornstein used a moment ago, was the issue\nof protecting people who can be hurt by discrimination.\nIt was a protection issue.\nSo that I think what he's saying, and -- and\nwhat the petitioner's counsel are saying is, the one thing\nthat we do know about employees is that they were people\nwho were intended to be protected by this statute. If\nthat is true, it is not probable that they were trying to\ninclude as employees, the protected category, people who\ndon't need protection because they are in ultimate control\nof the business, the ones who, if there's going to be\ndiscrimination, are going to be doing the discriminating,\nso it's probable that the people who have that ultimate\ncontrol would intend it to be within the employee\ncategory. That's an issue that the common law didn't\naddress.\nHow do you respond to that argument?\nMR. CRISPIN: Justice Souter, the individuals\nthat are subject to discrimination in this particular case\nare not only the lower-level employees as this case\npresents. We have four shareholder-directors, and any one\nof those could come down with a disability and have the\nremaining three shareholders refuse to accommodate or\notherwise violate the ADA with respect to that one\nindividual, so the -- the individual --\nQUESTION: So you're saying, even on the premise\nof their argument, it does not exclude any one of the\nfour.\nMR. CRISPIN: That's correct.\nQUESTION: I suppose if one of the four had a\n51 percent, a truly indefeasibly controlling interest,\nyou'd concede that, but short of that, which apparently is\nnot the case here, you say, even if I take their premises,\nthey lose.\nMR. CRISPIN: That's right, Your Honor, I --\nalthough I -- let me comment that I'm not sure I would\nconcede the 51 percent, all -- I would concede it for your\nhypothetical.\nQUESTION: Yes, right.\nMR. CRISPIN: But our position is that the\nemploying enterprise is the determining factor.\nQUESTION: How -- how does the EEOC treat an\nordinary corporation that, let's say, has 12 regular\nemployees and then three directors, the cousin, the\nfather, the son, or whatever, of the owner, so there -- so\nit's as -- if you count the three -- and it's a perfectly\nordinary corporation. There's nothing special about it.\nDo they count those three directors, or not, as employees?\nMR. CRISPIN: As I read their position, I -- I\nbelieve that they, under the new guidance, would count\nthose directors under their balancing test. They would\napply the -- this multiple-factor balancing test, look at\nthe degree of control, and decide on a case-by-case basis.\nQUESTION: So remember, these three are just\ncousins. They're not -- I mean, they only show up once a\nyear, and they vote, and -- and that's it. That's their\nconnection.\nMR. CRISPIN: Well, in that case, Your Honor --\nQUESTION: Do they count them or not?\nMR. CRISPIN: In that case, Your Honor, they\nwould not be counted.\nQUESTION: They don't count?\nMR. CRISPIN: They don't count, because they're\nnot performing services --\nQUESTION: All right. Then -- and those are\npeople who the common law really would consider to be\nemployees, at least while they're there for that hour a\nyear, is that right?\nMR. CRISPIN: I'm not sure what the answer would\nbe. We know that -- that employee is considered a person\nwho performs services for the corporation --\nQUESTION: Well, they're there once a year for\nan hour, and during that time they spill some water,\nsomebody slips -- I mean, a corporation, I guess, would be\nliable, or -- or not?\nMR. CRISPIN: On their acts, if they are\nperforming services --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. CRISPIN: -- for the corporation for\ncompensation they would at -- for that hour --\nQUESTION: Yes, for that hour.\nMR. CRISPIN: -- be considered employees.\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. CRISPIN: Now, of course, under the ADA\nwe're looking at numbers of employees over 20 weeks within\na calendar year.\nQUESTION: Yeah, yeah, yeah, right.\nMR. CRISPIN: But again, the idea, as this Court\nrecognized in Walters versus Metro Educational, was that\nthe determinations under the employment discrimination\nstatutes should be subject to ready and easy\ndetermination. Complex and expensive factual inquiries\nshould be avoided, but yet the Government's test and the\nclinic's test, which has adopted the Government's test,\nwould have this Court look at the facts in each individual\ncase every time --\nQUESTION: Well, don't we have to give some\nweight to the EEOC view? Do you just want to ignore it\ncompletely?\nMR. CRISPIN: No, Your Honor. The Skidmore\ndeference is appropriate, Justice O'Connor.\nQUESTION: Why? Why, because I would think then\nyou lose. I mean, here -- if I'm very frank about it,\nthere are two competing things here, and the one thing,\ngive weight to the agency, let them define these terms,\nparticularly at the margin, but that's Hearst, and -- and\nthe other is, no, no, it doesn't matter what they say, pay\nno attention whatsoever to what they say. What they have\nto do is follow the common law definition. That's Darden.\nSo if Darden applies, I take it you win, but if\nDarden doesn't apply, it seems to be much harder for you\nto win, because then the agency should get deference under\nSkidmore, at least, in applying the term, and the agency\nhere has a different definition than the one that helps\nyou.\nSo that's where I am, and I'm quite uncertain\nabout it.\nMR. CRISPIN: Your Honor, two -- two responses\nto your question. Under Darden, it -- it does -- the\nCourt has decided that the common law applies, and we\nwould say that's appropriate. The precise test under\nDarden dealt with the independent contractor versus\nemployee test. That is not absolutely translatable here,\nbut the key concept is that the common law applies is\nappropriate.\nThe second aspect of your question, Your Honor,\nwas on the deference entitled to the EEOC opinion, and as\nI understand Skidmore deference, it's only that deference\nwhich is appropriate under the circumstances of their\ntest. In this case, the EEOC's test is not workable. It\nleads to inconsistent results, and it fails to further\nthe -- the interests that are looked at under the statute,\nand I can turn to those points.\nQUESTION: Doesn't it, perhaps better than the,\njust straight common law, of course, deal with the coming\nof -- of age, so to speak, of the professional\ncorporation, which really didn't -- didn't amount to much,\nif -- if it even existed 20 or 25 years ago?\nMR. CRISPIN: Mr. Chief Justice, it may address\nit, but it need not. It need not treat a corporation,\nwhether it's a professional corporation or a general\ncorporation, differently --\nQUESTION: No, it need not, but it has chosen to\ndo so, and the -- the question, I guess, before us is,\nunder Skidmore deference, is that a reasonable decision?\nMR. CRISPIN: It's not a reasonable decision in\nlooking at the professional corporation as the EEOC's test\nwould apply to it, and -- and the reasons are that, as --\nas the EEOC and the clinic has suggested, an important\nissue is one of consistency, yet applying their test does\nnot lead to consistent results.\nOne can imagine the -- the circumstance of a\nprofessional corporation with one shareholder-director and\n14 employees. Under their test, that individual\ncorporation would not be covered. It has fewer than 15.\nTake the situation, though, where there are 14,\n15 director-shareholders of the professional corporation\nand 14 employees, a business nearly twice the size of the\nfirst one, and yet that one would be covered because of\nthe 15 employees.\nQUESTION: Are you -- are you basing your\nestimate of what the EEOC would cover on the materials set\nforth in the Government's brief at page 9?\nMR. CRISPIN: Well, as I -- as I read the test,\nwhat the EEOC would do in that circumstance would look at\nthe number of employees, and the 15 employees, whether\nthere was 1 or 14 shareholders would make no difference,\nand -- and yet with 15 or 14, or 15 or 25 shareholders,\nwhether or not they were considered employees or not, the\n15 individual employees would be enough to provide\ncoverage, yet take the same circumstance and back off the\none with the number of employees, and under the EEOC's\ntest, it would be a factual shareholder-by-shareholder\ndetermination which would be required to determine whether\nthis company -- corporation is, in fact, covered or not.\nAnd so we have the situations where many more\nentities, enterprises with a lot of people working for\nthem, which may not be covered on the one hand, and down\nthe street a very similar corporation --\nQUESTION: But if they have many people working\nfor them, they won't be subject to the small business\nexception.\nMR. CRISPIN: That -- that's right, unless they\nhave less than 15 employees, but yet in a professional\ncorporation as we have here, the individual shareholders\nare performing services for the corporation. In fact,\nthat's the business of the corporation, is to provide the\nmedical services that these four shareholders were\nperforming. They created revenue which came into the\ncorporation, they got the benefits of the corporate\nstructure for tax benefits and for ERISA purposes, and yet\nthey -- and yet the EEOC would -- would put a factual\ndetermination on whether or not one or more of the\nindividuals were, in fact, employees.\nThe interest of predictability would be lost in\nsuch a situation. Predictability is important for both\nthe enterprise itself to know whether it's covered, and\nalso for the individual employee, the secretary or the\nnurse down the hall. In a -- a test that says, we adopt\nthe corporate structure as the appropriate test, those\nindividuals, the enterprise, the nurse, the secretary, all\nthey have to do is look at their paycheck to see if it's a\ncorporation, and count up the number of people working for\nthat corporation, performing services --\nQUESTION: Well, what -- why would they be doing\nthis? I mean, are you suggesting that the secretaries\nwon't work for the corporation unless they know it's\ncovered under this statute?\nMR. CRISPIN: I -- I think that's a possibility,\nyes.\nQUESTION: No, I mean, is it a realistic\npossibility? I mean, are people making employment\ndecisions depending on whether they -- they're going to be\nable to sue if there is discrimination likely?\nMR. CRISPIN: In -- in my practice, which is\nexclusively dealing with employment matters, yes, we see\nthat, individuals who are quite concerned. Also, I am\naware of, although I cannot cite you to studies which\nindicate that fear of retaliation for bringing a claim is\na real factor on individuals. If they know they're not\nprotected, they don't bring the claim. Now, that's --\nQUESTION: But if there are no -- if they're not\nprotected, they have no claim to make.\nMR. CRISPIN: That's true. If they -- if they\nknow they're not protected, then they -- they don't risk\nthe kind of retaliation for raising the claim, and they go\non and just do their jobs.\nQUESTION: So I'm quite -- still -- I hate to go\nback to this, but it seems to me there might be millions\nof small businesses in the country that have about 10 or\n12 employees where if you count their directors, they are\ngoing to be covered, and if you don't count them, they\nwon't be, and I'm curious about the practical effect of\nthat. Of course, if the EEOC counts them now, there's no\nproblem. If it doesn't count them now, this decision\nwould -- would affect that. Do you have any sense of what\nthe facts are?\nMR. CRISPIN: I think the numbers are\nsignificant, that there are quite a number of -- of small\nbusinesses in that category, professional corporations,\nbut whether that's a factor that should enter into the\nCourt is, of course, your decision, not mine, but if\nCongress -- but the -- the touchstone of that question,\nthen, would be, though, the intent of -- of Congress,\nwhether Congress intended the term, employee, to have a\ncommon law application and, if that's the case, then they\nshould be, in fact, covered. That's what Congress wanted\nto do.\nQUESTION: How do you respond to the famous two\nclinic examples, one is set up as a partnership and one is\na professional corporation?\nMR. CRISPIN: Well, Your Honor, Number -- I've\ngot two responses to that. Number 1, it -- it's one\nexample of a way that it would provide inconsistent\nresults, but I just talked about a different one which is\nvery different, which provides inconsistent results by\ntheir test.\nSecond, this Court has never held that a\npartnership is not subject to Title VII or ADA because\nit's a partnership. Some of the lower courts have done\nthat, and Justice Powell in his concurring opinion in the\nHishon case did, in fact, address that, but this Court has\nnever so held. That's not a question that this Court need\naddress in this opinion, but it is something that the\nCourt may want to look at in terms of, under the -- for\nexample, under the Restatement Second of Agency in 1958,\nthe partnership was recognized as being able to have\nemployees as members of its partners who were performing\nservices for that partnership, so --\nQUESTION: Are you making a distinction between\nowner-directors who are also working every day providing\nthe services of the entity, and owner-directors who are\nnot involved in the day-to-day service delivery function\nof the enterprise?\nMR. CRISPIN: Justice Ginsburg, I -- I\nbelieve -- I believe your question addresses whether those\ndirectors who are not involved day-to-day --\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. CRISPIN: -- would be covered as employees,\nbut the common law test, as I understand it, is that\nthere's a question of compensation. If the services are\nbeing provided, and there's compensation for those\nservices, then the individual would be counted as an\nemployee and, as we indicated earlier, the question under\nthe ADA deals with five work days in 20 different weeks,\nso the -- the director who comes in just on occasional\nbasis, even if compensated, would not be enough to -- to,\ntypically to add another employee.\nQUESTION: Well, if you say the director gets a\nfee, and the meetings are not frequent but the director is\nexpected to remain au courant with what's going on in the\nbusiness, so how do we judge that? We can't say, only\nthe -- for the hour of the meeting that director counts.\nMR. CRISPIN: Your Honor, the -- the decision of\nthis Court in, in the A -- in determining what employees\ncount for ADA purposes was, the -- the decision was the\npayroll method, and looked to the payroll, whether an\nindividual is on the payroll for 5 days of the week for\n20 weeks in the preceding or current calendar year, so the\ndirector, if that director is performing services adequate\nto put him or her on the payroll for the entire week,\nwould be counted as an employee for that particular week.\nI -- I would suggest that that would be a rare\noccasion where a director who had no other role in the\ncompany but to come in and sit in on a meeting or keep up\nwith things would appear on the payroll, but if they were,\nthen they should be counted as employees, because they are\nperforming services, receiving compensation, and then it\njust simply moves into the -- the method of counting those\nemployees.\nQUESTION: In any event, the director, the\nowner-directors, shareholder-directors that we have here\nare working for the corporation every day, and they are on\nsalary?\nMR. CRISPIN: They are on salary. They work\nevery day. The compensation or revenue they produce goes\ninto the corporation. They enjoy the corporate shield\nfrom liability for all but that small category of exposure\nto malpractice cases --\nQUESTION: Why is that small, when you're\ntalking about a professional medical corporation? It\nseems to me that that would be the biggest liability, not\nthe small --\nMR. CRISPIN: It very well may be the largest\nmonetary, but one could -- could list a number of things,\nsuch as liability on the leasehold, liability for employee\nclaims, liability for employment contracts, liability for\ntax payments, that would be the liability of the\ncorporation, and for which the individual shareholder-\ndirectors would not have --\nQUESTION: But with -- with malpractice, don't\nyou have a much greater likelihood of punitive damages and\nthings like that, that you don't have arising just out of\na contract claim?\nMR. CRISPIN: Exactly, Mr. Chief Justice,\nthat -- that is correct, and so, from the -- the monetary\nstandpoint, as I said, that would be the greatest problem,\nbut the -- the idea of limited liability exists in this\ncorporation, as it does, in fact, in the limited liability\npartnerships and limited liability companies, and if the\ntouchstone is whether there are corporate limited\nliability features, then it doesn't make any difference\nwhatsoever whether we're dealing with a limited liability\npartnership, limited liability corporation, a professional\ncorporation, or a general corporation, individuals would\nbe employees if they met the requirements otherwise.\nIf there are no other questions, I'll conclude.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Crispin.\nMr. Seymour, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN W. SEYMOUR\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. SEYMOUR: Thank you.\nThe protected class, people in the protected\nclass should be the same as are counted toward the\n15-employee threshold. That is, we should look at the\nindividuals in the business enterprise the same, whether\nwe are determining whether they are eligible to file a\nlawsuit, or are protected by the act, or are counted\ntowards the act's coverage.\nMust these doctors take the bitter with the\nsweet? What we're saying is that what these doctors\ndeserve is to be treated the same as their colleagues in\nbusinesses that are identical, but have a different form.\nThat is, these doctors in the professional corporation\nshould be treated the same as doctors in a limited\nliability partnership or a limited liability company.\nWould it be simpler to simply look at the form\nof the business and stop there? It would, but it would\nalso be simpler if we looked at the term, partner and\nsaid, well, partners can never be employees, or we look at\nthe term, independent contractor, and say well,\nindependent contractors can never be employees, but we\ndon't do that for good reasons. We look beyond the label,\nand I'm suggesting that that is appropriate here as well.\nLook beyond the label and see what the realities are, a\nreality check.\nDoes the EEOC count directors as employees?\nGenerally, in -- in business law there's a big difference\nbetween a director, an officer, a shareholder, and an\nemployee, so as I read the EEOC guidance, that is a\nvehicle through which businesses, courts, and the EEOC can\nlook at an individual and determine, well, is the -- is\nthe label, director, in this circumstance appropriate, or\nare they really functioning as an employee?\nYou can, of course, have inside directors, that\nis, employees who are appointed to the board of directors,\nor you can have outside directors in some circumstances\nwhere they aren't affiliated except in an advisory role,\nas a member of the board, and they -- members of the board\nof directors could be paid or they could be not paid, and\nI don't think that's an issue that should necessarily be\ndeterminative on deciding whether or not they are an\nemployee.\nThe court of appeals here did not look beyond\nthe fact that the shareholder-directors had organized as a\nprofessional corporation, but the trial court did, and\nlooked at factors similar to those identified in the EEOC\nguidance, and concluded that these shareholder-directors\nwere not employees. We believe that is the correct\napproach the Court should take.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you,\n"
