WAXMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. WAXMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe question presented is how to interpret a\nsince-amended version of Regulation Z. In amicus briefs\nfiled, solicited by the First Circuit and by this Court,\nthe Federal Reserve Board has confirmed that it has long\ninterpreted its regulation just as Chase Bank and the\nrest of the regulated credit card industry understood.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Waxman?\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes, Justice Kagan?\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Can I ask you about the\ndeference that we should give to the briefs that have\nbeen filed in the First Circuit and the invitation brief\nin this case?\nAuer deference seems pretty four-square with\nthis. It's a brief that was filed to interpret an\nagency regulation. But I'm wondering whether Auer\ncontinues to remain good law after Christensen and Mead.\nIn Christensen, the Court held -- and I quote -\n\"Interpretations such as those in opinion letters -\nlike interpretations contained in policy statements,\nagency manuals, and enforcement guidelines, all of which\nlack the force of law -- do not warrant Chevron-style\ndeference.\" And Mead said pretty much the same thing.\nSo it seems to me that there are three\npossibilities for why Auer remains good law. One is\nthat briefs are somehow different from all those other\nthings that we talked about in Christensen.\nAnother is that an agency gets more\ndeference when interpreting regulations than when\ninterpreting its own statutes -- something that I think\nI just don't quite understand, but maybe you could\nconvince me of it.\nAnd a third is, well, look, they're just\nbasically inconsistent, but Auer was Auer, and we don't\nfeel like overruling cases, and we're not so sure we got\nit right in Christensen and Mead anyway.\nSo, which is it?\nMR. WAXMAN: A lot of the above.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. WAXMAN: First of all, Auer has been\napplied in the context of amicus briefs since\nChristensen and Mead, both -- unanimously both in\nKennedy and in Long Island Care at Home. And I must\nsay, in both of those cases, the deference was to a\nbrief that acknowledged a change in the agency's\nposition, which is quite unlike what's going on here.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Absolutely right, Mr.\nWaxman, but in each of those cases it was basically a\nsentence or two. We never really addressed the possible\nconflict between Auer and Christensen and Mead.\nMR. WAXMAN: Nonetheless, I think those\ncases stand for the proposition that Auer is alive and\nwell. And, in any event, as your question pointed out,\nboth Mead and Christensen and the passage in Christensen\nthat you're referring to dealt with the question of\nChevron deference to informal letters from the -- from,\nyou know, a -- somebody who was employed by an\nadministrative agency.\nAnd the question in the case, the\ninterpretive question in the case, in the Chevron\ncontext, is: What confidence can we have that Congress\nhas, in fact, delegated to the agency interpretive or\nrulemaking authority in this context? And so, for\nexample, in Mead, the Court distinguished between\nnotice-and-comment regulations that Customs put out, as\nopposed to the kind of determinations that were made by\n46 different offices at the rate of something like\n15,000 letters a year.\nIn the -- when Christensen dealt with the\nAuer question, because it did involve a -- an informal\nopinion of the Wage and Hour Administrator both\ninterpreting the Fair Labor Standards Act and a\nregulation, when it came to interpreting the regulation\nwhat this Court said is: Our deference doesn't apply\nhere because we read the regulation as clear. And Auer,\nof course, made clear that deference is due to an agency\nbrief unless it is plainly erroneous or the regulation\nis clear.\nNow, here we have a situation in which it is\nnot an agency staff or whatever that is applied. The\nFirst Circuit asked the government for -- solicited the\nFederal Reserve Board itself to explain the meaning of\nits own regulation. And the brief that was filed\nrepresented that it was the longstanding and consistent\ninterpretation of the Federal Reserve Board -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Waxman, I take it\nfrom this whole discussion that you are recognizing that\nthis is not a crystal-clear regulation; there is some\nambiguity, and that's why we are talking about how much\ndeference we owe to the agency.\nMR. WAXMAN: That's correct. We think that\nthe Federal Reserve Board's reading of the two\nregulatory provisions is the better reading, but we\nacknowledge, as every court I think that has -- that has\naddressed this, that there is some ambiguity, just\nlooking at the regulations.\nBut I think it's important to understand\nalso that the views expressed in the amicus brief\nsolicited by the First Circuit and by this Court are\nentirely consistent with explanations that the Board, as\na Board, provided in the course of a 4-year rulemaking\nprocess about what these provisions mean.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you think the same\ndeference is owed to ANPRs as to the amicus briefs?\nWhat is your position on that?\nMR. WAXMAN: I -- I think that if it weren't\nfor the amicus briefs in this case, which are later in\ntime and address the very specific question that is\npresented in this case, our deference would be\nappropriate.\nAnd it's not just an ANPR. There was the\nFederal Reserve explanation accompanying the ANPR, a\nfunctionally identical explanation accompanying the\nproposed rule, and one also accompanying the final rule.\nAnd those explanations of the Board are entitled to Auer\ndeference.\nAfter all, in Anderson Ford, another case\ninvolving the construction of Regulation Z, this Court\nacknowledged that deference was due to a proposed -- the\ncommentary accompanying a proposed change in Regulation\nZ which had not in fact even been implemented. So -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, I suppose -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Judge Cudahy in dissent\nrelied very much on the advance notice of proposed\nrulemaking.\nMR. WAXMAN: I'm sorry? Judge -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Judge Cudahy in dissent\nrelied -- put considerable reliance on the ANPR.\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes. And in fact,\nJustice Kennedy, I would say that both the majority and\nthe dissent below referred to the ANPR when -- both when\nthey were referring to the commentary to the ANPR and\nthe commentary to the actual proposed rule in 2007.\nNow, of course, Judge Cudahy was deciding\nthis before the First Circuit had solicited the views.\nOn rehearing, we urged the Ninth Circuit to solicit the\nviews of the Federal Reserve Board if there were any\ndoubt, because a split had been created, but it declined\nto do so. And -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I suppose, having done it\ntwice before, we could in this case apply Auer without\nexplaining why it is that Auer is not inconsistent with\nMead, right? We did it twice before; we could do it\nhere.\nMR. WAXMAN: Sure. Or -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Absolutely.\nMR. WAXMAN: Or you could -- you could\nexplain that it is not in any way inconsistent with\nMead, because Mead -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's a lot more trouble,\nthough.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. WAXMAN: To be sure, but you granted\nplenary review in this case. And I do -- I just want to\nunderscore -- I'm not trying -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why \"to be sure\"?\nMR. WAXMAN: I'm not trying to be flip here.\nI don't think that there is any inconsistency between\nAuer and Mead. Mead involved the question of whether or\nnot there was -- the Court could be confident that\nCongress had delegated some sort of lawmaking function\nto these letters that were written by Customs officers\nacross the country to individual importers, when the\nletters themselves made clear that they couldn't be\nrelied on by anybody other than that particular importer\nand only unless and until the Customs officer changed\nher mind.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But Mead did put a lot of\nemphasis on procedural formality. So, you know,\nJustice Scalia sort of snidely, but I think accurately,\ndescribed Mead as saying: \"Only when agencies act\nthrough 'adjudication[,] notice-and-comment rulemaking,\nor...some other [procedure] indicat[ing] comparable\ncongressional intent [whatever that means]' is Chevron\ndeference applicable.\" So, you know -\nMR. WAXMAN: I don't -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: This is -- this is not an\nadjudication. It's not a notice-and-comment rulemaking,\nand it's hard to see why there is some procedure here\nindicating comparable congressional intent, as Mead was\n-- would require.\nMR. WAXMAN: Justice Kagan, with respect to\nthe Mead question, which is a Chevron question, the -\nthe Board's explanation in -- published in the Federal\nRegister in 2004, and again in 2007, and again in 2009,\nis a formal explication of the Board's rules pursuant to\nits very, very broad rulemaking authority under the\nTruth in Lending Act.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Of course, you can also\nread Mead and decide what it says. Being in the\nmajority, I thought the dissent's characterization was\nnot what it said. I mean, the dissent -\nMR. WAXMAN: I -- I don't think there's -\nJUSTICE BREYER: The dissent can write what\nit wants to write. But I don't think that that was what\nMead said, but I guess there's disagreement about that.\nWhat did you think?\nMR. WAXMAN: Given my chosen line of work,\nit may be meet for me not to inject myself into this\ndebate, but -\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. But I -- I'm\nsorry. You're an informed reader, and I -- I thought\nMead definitely did not say that. That was the\ndissent's characterization of what it said.\nMR. WAXMAN: Giving the dissent its full\nweight, I had understood both the majority and the\ndissent to explain that notice -- the existence of\nformal notice-and-comment rulemaking is an important\nindicator -\nJUSTICE BREYER: That is one indicator.\nMR. WAXMAN: -- one indicator of\ncongressional delegation of rulemaking authority.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But not exclusive.\nMR. WAXMAN: But not exclusive.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Waxman, why are we\ngetting into all of this, because there's no question in\nthis case that the Federal Reserve Board had authority\nto issue Regulation Z? There's no question about what\nauthority Congress gave to -- to the Board.\nMR. WAXMAN: Correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So -- and the only\nquestion is: So -- so the Board adopts Regulation Z,\nand then a question comes up, what does it mean? Well,\nsurely the Board that wrote the rule is first and\nforemost the proper interpreter.\nMR. WAXMAN: Right. As to -- I agree with\nthat. And, as to why we're getting into all this, you\nknow, I had a prepared statement that actually was going\noff in a different direction.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. WAXMAN: Not in the sense that I'm\ndisagreeing with the Court, but the point that it seems\nto me -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This is not new to\nyou, is it, this method of proceeding?\nMR. WAXMAN: So I think the -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do I understand -\nbefore you move in the direction you'd like to, I\nunderstand your view to be that Chevron and Auer apply,\nand it's consistent with Mead because you have more\nindications that Congress delegated this authority to\nthe Board than you -- than were present in Mead?\nMR. WAXMAN: That's correct. And I think,\nyou know, to the extent that there's anything more\nthat's needed, it seems to me the icing on the cake here\nis that the rulemaking that I've been discussing during\nwhich over the course of several years the Board engaged\nin consumer testing, in surveys, in comments, and\ndecided to change its regulation -- it produced as what\nit called a, quote, \"major change,\" an entirely new\nsection of Regulation Z, 226.9, that establishes as a\nnew requirement what the Respondent in this case\nerroneously ascribes to the previously unamended text.\nAnd that is -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, I do think -- I do\nthink, counsel, that that major change doesn't have to\nbe the way you describe it. The difference between\neither contemporary notice and/or 15-day notice versus\n45 is a significant change.\nMR. WAXMAN: That's correct, and it's -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And so it doesn't need\nto have been precipitated solely by a decision that the\nold rule, if it's as your adversary advocates it, didn't\nexist.\nMR. WAXMAN: I -- I agree, Justice\nSotomayor, that that -- that one of the two changes that\nthe Board made could be characterized and was, in fact,\na major change. But if the Court will take note of the\npages, the Federal Register record cites that we've\nprovided on page 29, note 7, of our blue brief, and that\nthe Federal Reserve Board's amicus brief in the First\nCircuit provided at page 12a of the Government's brief,\nI think you will see that what the Board -- the Board in\n2009 was very careful to explain, as it did in 2007,\nthat it was making in this respect two major changes.\nOne is that in those instances in which the\ncontract was being changed, that is a term of the\ncontract was being changed, advance notice of 45 days\nwould be required regardless of what kind of change it\nwas, but that when there was an -- a rate increase,\nquote, \"due to delinquency, deficiency, or penalty, not\ndue to a change in contractual terms of the consumer's\naccount,\" reference should be made to new subsection\n(g). And the Federal Reserve Board was very, very clear\nthat it was making two different changes: one to extend\nthe advance notice period with respect to changes in\nterms from what the original disclosure provided; and\nanother to provide that if you are increasing the rate,\neven if it is entirely consistent with the initial\ndisclosures, you are required by this new subsection to\nprovide advance notice.\nJUSTICE ALITO: May I ask you a question\nabout how the contract works in the situation in which a\ncardholder is found by -- was found by Chase to have\ndefaulted by failing to make some payment other than\npayment on the Chase credit card? So you determine, I\nguess from information obtained from a credit agency,\nthat the cardholder has failed to make payments to\nsomeone else on time, you conclude that the cardholder\nis in default, you increase the -- the interest rate.\nHow is the -- the cardholder, knowing,\nthinking that he or she has made all Chase payments on\ntime, is not going to be alerted to the fact that there\nmay be an increase in the rate. So how is that\ncardholder going to realize what has happened, just by\nscrutinizing the monthly statement and seeing that the\nlittle interest figure is different from what it was the\nlast time?\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes. And now, of course, we're\ntalking about a rule that's -- it had been amended -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Yes, I saw that.\nMR. WAXMAN: -- amended 2 years ago, but\nunder the old regime the cardholder was on notice -- I\nmean, there had to be -- and the Reg Z commentary was\nclear that in order for it to be a default rate, it had\nto specify in the initial disclosures both the precise\ntriggering event, that is, what constitutes a default -\nand here there's no doubt that it was specified that\nwhat constitutes a default is a default or failure to\nmake a payment to any creditor -- and there also has to\nbe a specification of the maximum rate that could be\napplied as a result.\nNow, in this case, as the Board explained,\nthe -- the consumer would be notified in the next\nmonthly statement -- and it is pretty prominent -- that\nthe interest rate applied to all balances for that month\nwas as follows.\nMay I save the balance of my time?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Waxman, you refer to\nfootnote 7 on page 29 of your blue brief? Is that what\nyou said?\nMR. WAXMAN: Oh, gosh, I hope I have this\nright.\nOh, no. I'm sorry. It's footnote 7 on page\n29 of our petition.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, of the petition. All\nright.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Palmore.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH R. PALMORE,\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. PALMORE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nDuring the relevant time period, the Federal\nReserve Board's Regulation Z did not require provision\nof a change-in-terms notice when a credit card issuer\nmerely implemented a contractual penalty rate provision\nthat had already been disclosed. This is clear from the\nstaff commentary to the rule, from the Board's own\nstatements in the Federal Register when discussing\nchanges to this very rule, and finally from the amicus\nbriefs filed by the Board in the First Circuit and in\nthis Court.\nI think it's important to put the particular\nregulatory provisions here in a larger context because\nthe policy question at issue here, whether there should\nbe advance notice under these circumstances, is not new.\nIt did not arise with this litigation. It has been the\nsubject of intense regulatory focus at the Board since\n2004. It has been the subject of two rounds of\nnotice-and-comment rulemaking, of consumer testing, and\nfinally of an amendment to the rule to provide notice\nunder these circumstances, notice that in the court of\nappeals' view had always been required, unbeknownst to\nthe Board or anyone in the regulatory community.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I take it, apart\nfrom the amendment to the rule, you think those\ncircumstances provide for Chevron/Auer deference.\nMR. PALMORE: I do. This is, of course, not\na Chevron case. There's no provision in the Truth in\nLending Act that deals with subsequent disclosure. The\nsubsequent disclosure -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Our Long Island\nhealth care case?\nMR. PALMORE: It's an -- it's an Auer case,\nand we believe that all of these provisions, certainly\nthe staff commentary deserves deference, and that was\nthe holding of this Court in Milhollin, in the Milhollin\ncase. But also the Board's own authoritative statements\nin rulemaking proceedings about what its old rules meant\ncertainly deserve deference, and we believe the amicus\nbriefs do as well.\nIn 2004, it was -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you know, we don't -\nwe don't do that with Congress. When -- when a later\nCongress says what a statute enacted by an earlier\nCongress meant, we don't -- we don't retroactively say,\nwell, that must be what it meant. Are there other\nexamples of where the Board says what a prior rule meant\nthat we deferred on?\nMR. PALMORE: Well, this Board -- this\nCourt, of course, in Long Island Care at Home deferred\nto an internal advisory memorandum that was -- that was\nprovided after the court of appeals decision that was at\nissue. That was an after-the-fact reading, and it was a\nchange in policy.\nIn the context of Auer deference, when\nyou're looking to the author of the agency's regulation\nto elucidate what that regulation has meant -- means,\nthe Court has looked at a broad range of material\nbecause it understands that, when Congress delegates\nrulemaking authority to an agency, that it also as an\nadjunct to that delegates authority to interpret those\nrules.\nSo, in 2004, the Board launched a proceeding\nbecause it was concerned with the very issue that\nunderlies this litigation. And then, in 2007, it issued\nrules to address this situation. And in that rulemaking\nnotice -- and this is at page 12 of the blue brief -\nthe Board described what the old rules required. And it\ndid so in a way that's irreconcilable with the court of\nappeals' view of what the old rules required. The Board\nnoted that staff comment 9(c)-1 did not require\nprovision of a change-in-terms notice when a specific\nchange had been previously disclosed.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Palmore, what would the\nBoard's position be on the following hypothetical: That\na card issuer says when any of 50 different things\nhappen, so 50 different triggering events, the -- the\nissuer can raise the rate anywhere up to 300 percent, so\nhas complete discretion if any of a quite large number\nof triggering events occurs. And then one of those 50\ntriggering events occurs, and the card issuer says,\nokay, we'll raise the interest rate to 42 percent.\nWould there need to be notice for that?\nMR. PALMORE: Under the old rule, no.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Under the old rule?\nMR. PALMORE: Under the old rule, no.\nThere's a specific staff comment, 6(a)(2)-11, which\ndeals with the initial disclosure of penalty rate\nprovisions, and it said there are two requirements of\nspecificity. The specific maximum rate that may be\napplied must be disclosed, and the specific event or\nevents that could lead to imposition of that specific\nmaximum rate must be disclosed.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Palmore, suppose\nthere was no triggering event, but in the initial\nstatement the company said: We reserve the right to\nraise the interest to X amount. No triggering event,\njust a reservation of the right to raise the interest.\nWould that have to be -- and then it implements that\nlater on. Would the cardholder have to have notice of\nthat under the old reg?\nMR. PALMORE: Yes. Under staff comment\n9(c)-1, the staff makes clear that if there's a general\n-- exercise of a change in rates pursuant to a general\nreservation of rights clause that's not specific with\nrespect to the maximum rate that could apply or the\nspecific triggering events that could lead to imposition\nof the maximum rate, that advance notice is required.\nBut the staff contrasted that to the\nsituation we have here, when the specific change is\npreviously disclosed, and it provided some examples, the\nthird of which is quite analogous here. It's a\nsituation where the cardholder has agreed to maintain a\ncertain balance in a savings account at the risk of\nhaving his rate go up if he -- if he goes below that\nbalance.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And when was that staff\ncomment made?\nMR. PALMORE: That was in -- that's been\nthere since 1981, Justice Kennedy.\nBut going back to the 2007 notice of\nproposed rulemaking, the Court specifically -- sorry -\nthe Board specifically addressed this situation. It\nsaid: \"Some credit card account agreements permit the\ncard issuer to increase the periodic rate if the\nconsumer makes a late payment. Because the\ncircumstances of the increase are specified in advance\nin the account agreement, the creditor currently need\nnot provide a change-in-terms notice; under current\n226.7(d), the new rate will appear on the periodic\nstatement for the cycle in which the increase occurs.\"\nThis statement by the Board authoritatively\ninterpreting its rules is inconsistent with the court of\nappeals' view of those rules.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could you address\nyour friend's contention that because the notice doesn't\noccur -- the notice that the increase has gone into\neffect doesn't occur until the end of a billing cycle,\nit's a retroactive increase without notice.\nMR. PALMORE: It's a retroactive increase\nwithout notice that was specifically disclosed\ninitially. So, if you look to the cardholder agreement\nhere on page 20a of the petition appendix, Chase was up\nfront that that's what would happen, that the change\nwould be -- the increase in rates would be applied to\nexisting balances and that -- and that consistent with\nthe statement from the notice of proposed rulemaking,\nthat the consumer would find out about that when he\nreceived his next periodic statement. That's a\nbackward-looking statement.\nThat's inconsistent with the court of\nappeals' view that advance notice had always been\nrequired. The court of appeals tried to dismiss this\nstatement and others like it as incidental descriptions\nof current law.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it is correct to\ncharacterize what's being allowed under your\ninterpretation as an increase in rates without notice?\nMR. PALMORE: Without advance notice. There\nare actually two kinds of notice under the old rule.\nNow there are three.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, advance notice\n--\nMR. PALMORE: First, you have to be -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Advance notice is\nnotice, right?\nMR. PALMORE: Right. It has to be -- it has\nto be disclosed initially. It had to be disclosed\ninitially, and if the cardholder didn't like the term,\nhe didn't have to sign up for that card. And then it\nhad to be disclosed subsequently on the periodic\nstatement immediately following the rate increase, which\nwould typically be within a matter of weeks.\nNow, the Board now believes that there\nshould be a third form of notice -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, what would have to be\ndisclosed, just the increase in rate?\nMR. PALMORE: The new rate, right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not the reason for the -\nMR. PALMORE: Not the reason. Under the new\nrule, a general reason has to be given.\nSo, when the court of appeals described this\nas an incidental description of current law, it was\ncorrect that this is a description of current law, but\nit wasn't at all incidental. It was inherent in the\nrulemaking proceeding. The agency needed to explain\nwhat its old rules required while it was -- so the\nreaders could make sense of what it was proposing to do\nto those rules.\nAnd then, as Mr. Waxman said, when the -\nwhen the Board then adopted amendments, it did two\ndifferent things. It changed 226.9(c), the provision at\nissue here, to extend the notice period to 45 days. But\nthen it did something additional. It adopted a new\nsubsection, 226.9(g), to provide for notice in\nsituations where there was no change in terms, where, by\ncontrast, the card issuer was simply implementing terms\nthat had previously been disclosed.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Did the Board think that\nthis -- that requiring the card-issuing company to\nprovide immediate notice would be very burdensome? And\nif not, what's the -- what was its reason for\ninterpreting the Regulation Z the way it did?\nMR. PALMORE: I think it's important to note\nthat in 1981, as we discussed earlier, there was no\nprovision in the Truth in Lending Act requiring\nsubsequent disclosure at all. And the focus in the\nstatute at that time and in the Board at that time was\non the importance of initial disclosure. And it was\nthought that initial disclosure was the key tool that\nconsumers could use to comparison shop for credit. And\nthe Board wasn't as focused on things that happened\nlater in that credit arrangement. And it thought that\nthe initial disclosure and the subsequent disclosure was\nsufficient, in the same way that, in a variable rate\nplan, there's initial disclosure of the variable rate\nand there's subsequent disclosure on the periodic\nstatement after the rate adjusts.\nThere was no requirement and there still is\nno requirement that there be advance notice when a\nvariable rate increases. The consumer finds out about\nit on the periodic statement within a matter of weeks of\nthe rate adjustment. And the Board previously viewed\nthese penalty rate provisions in much the same way. The\nBoard has now come to a different judgment.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Beck.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY A. BECK\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. BECK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe question in this case is whether a bank\nmust provide notice of a change in terms when, after\nprominently disclosing a specific purchase rate in the\ncardholder agreement, the bank then changes that rate -\nthen changes that rate based on a reservation of\ndiscretion in the fine print of the cardholder\nagreement.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Changes the rate in the\ncardholder's favor?\nMR. BECK: Changes the rate -- the rules,\nthe regulations, as they -- as they exist as relevant to\nthis case, provide that you do not need to provide\nnotice if the interest rate is reduced. Is that your\nquestion, Justice Ginsburg?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but would you -\nwould it be in the greater interest of your client if\nthe initial notice said we're going to raise it to the\ntop, no discretion?\nMR. BECK: It -- there -- Justice Ginsburg,\nthere would still be discretion. And we're not -- and\nnothing we say would take away discretion or discourage\ndiscretion. We're simply saying that either the -- the\ncredit card company has to decide specifically what rate\nwill apply beforehand and put it in the cardholder\nagreement, or it can specify a range of possible rates,\nreserve that discretion, and then when it decides which\nrate it wants to apply, it would then inform the\nborrower what that rate is.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But if it says: We\nprefer one notice to two. So, sorry, we can't give our\ncardholders that benefit. We'll say this is the rate,\nthis is going to be it. Then we will spare ourselves a\nsecond notice.\nMR. BECK: Right. And -- and there's -- but\nthere has been no showing that the -- this notice cost\nwould be -- would be a significant burden on the credit\ncard companies. And the important thing is that, if you\ndon't know, if you don't get that notice and all you\nknow is that the credit card company has discretion to\nraise the rate, then you never know for sure whether\nyour rate has even gone up or not, much less how much\nit's gone up. So you never have that opportunity to go\nand see whether there's a better-priced loan available.\nYou might not -- you might miss an opportunity to avoid\nmaking a purchase that would -- that would be at a rate\nhigher than you expected, and the lack of that -- that\nability to shop between loans is really the central\nmotivating -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, you know the\nhighest rate, because that's stated in the original\nnotice, and you could shop on the basis of that.\nMR. BECK: You -- you could, but you\nwouldn't know that the rate had gone up at all, because\nall you know is that there's a maximum rate, and the -\nand the credit card company has discretion to raise the\nrate or not. So absent any notice, the assumption would\nbe that the rate hasn't changed, that there's -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you get the notice\nwith your next statement. But you're talking about the\npurchases made before the next statement, right?\nMR. BECK: Right. You -- you don't get\nnotice on your next statement, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you get notice if\nyour rates changed. It would show it, wouldn't it?\nMR. BECK: It will -- it will state, Your\nHonor, it will state on the statement that -- what your\nrate is.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. BECK: But it will not tell you that the\nrate has changed, and it won't tell you how much it has\nchanged. So you'd have to figure that out by yourself.\nSo it's not notice of a change in that sense.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What's to figure out? I\nmean -\nMR. BECK: Well -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If he had been paying,\nwhat, 10 percent and it's now 25 percent, it would seem\nevident on the face. But that doesn't solve the problem\nof the purchases that you have made before you got that\nstatement.\nMR. BECK: Well, that's right -- that's\ncorrect, Your Honor. It still doesn't solve that\nproblem. And when the rate is applied retroactively\nback to the beginning of the cycle, so this would go\nback to the first of the month even before the default\noccurred, as happens in this case, then the problem is\nexacerbated even more.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Beck, just to clarify\nyour position, if the initial agreement said your rate\nis 10 percent, but if you're delinquent, your rate will\nbe 20 percent, so not up to 20 percent, just 20 percent,\nit's an automatic increase in your rate -- in that case,\nwould notice -- would subsequent notice be required?\nMR. BECK: I think if the disclosure was\nspecific and -- and prominent, as required by the\ninitial disclosures, and it wasn't retroactive, then I\nthink the best reading of the rules would be you would\nnot need to disclose that.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So if you don't need to\ndisclose this -- and I think that this is the import of\nJustice Ginsburg's question -\nMR. BECK: Right.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: -- what's the difference\nbetween going, okay, we'll do the initial agreement, 10\npercent to 20 percent; then we can always lower the rate\nwithout providing notice; we'll go back down to\n12 percent, and now you have a 12 percent rate. What's\nthe difference between doing that and, on the other\nhand, doing what the card issuer said here, which is if\nyou're delinquent, we have the discretion to go up to 20\npercent, but, you know, we could also go to 12?\nMR. BECK: Well, the easy answer to that\nquestion is that it -- it's different because the\nlanguage of the regulation specifies a different result\nin each case. Section 226.9(c)(2) says that no notice\nis required when any component of the finance charge\ndecreases or is changed in the customer's favor. So\nthere would be under the plain language of the\nregulation no need to -- to provide notice there.\nBut I think the intent of the question is,\nis Chase's argument about there's no practical\ndifference between the two, that is, there's basically\nno harm from -- from not telling people that the -\nabout their rate change. And we disagree with that as\nwell, first of all because, as I was saying to Justice\nGinsburg, you need to have the notice that there has\nbeen a change at all in order to -- to realize that you\nmight want to avoid making extra purchases or\nconsider -- not throw away the low APR offer that comes\nin the mail, for example.\nAnd also, aside from that, we think that\nwhen you have only a -- a maximum rate, that's basically\nthe equivalent of a range of possible rates between the\ninitial rate and the maximum rate. And that undercuts\nthe ability to compare loans at the time of the\ncardholder agreement, even before the whole default\ncomes into play, because at that point you have to\ncompare two loans with two possible ranges of rates, and\nthe key factor between the two, the value of the two\nloans, is how the credit card company will issue -- will\nuse its discretion in -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's just\nsaying that the problem that Justice Ginsburg is\nconcerned with isn't likely to come up, because a credit\ncard issuer realizes he's not going to get chosen by a\nconsumer if he says your rate is going to be somewhere\nbetween 5 and 20 percent. No one's going to sign up for\nthat card.\nMR. BECK: Well, that's -- that's part of\nthe problem, Mr. Chief Justice, because the point of -\nthe central motivating purpose of TILA is to provide\nclear and up-front and specific disclosures, and that -\nthat would put the burden on the consumer to -- to look\ninto the fine print to figure out the conditions, and\nafter judging all the applicability of those conditions,\nto figure out how it would apply and compare with other\nloans.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And it's fine to say\nthen, Federal Reserve Board, this regulation that you\nhad and that you explained a number of times was a bad\none; you should change it, which they did. But you are\nup against a regulation that both sides say has some\nambiguity, but that the Board has said what it meant a\nnumber of times. So is -- is the Court free to say the\nnew rule is much better so we're going to say that\nthat's what the old rule was as well, in the face of\nwhat the Board has said?\nMR. BECK: No, definitely not, Justice\nGinsburg. But -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why not? Can't an agency\ninterpret its own rules? I thought there was a long\nline of cases, Udall v. -- whatever it was. I mean,\nthere are like 50 of them -\nMR. BECK: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- where an agency can\ninterpret its own rules, and if it has authority to make\nthe rule, it can decide that it means something\ndifferent. Why not? Where -- where in the law does it\nsay they can't do that?\nMR. BECK: It doesn't, Justice Breyer, and\n-- and all we're saying is that agencies speak with\nvarying levels of authority, and -- and those different\nmethods of statement make a difference in how much\ndeference will go towards those statements. And what we\nhave here is the official staff commentary which the\nBoard has designated as the official source of -- of\ninterpretation of the rules, and we're asking the Court\nto -- to read those rules and defer to those.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But at the Board -- I mean,\nisn't there realism in this? When you read what the\nBoard later said in -- in these reports, you'd say,\nwell, is this what the Board now thinks? And what in\nthe law prevents the Board, which is in charge of its\nown regulations, from telling us what it thinks, if it's\nin good faith and isn't making up some kind of ex-post\nrationalization? That's the word used, you know, in the\nbrief case.\nMR. BECK: I think that the Board itself\nmade that law when it decided that it would issue\nofficial staff commentary through a notice-and-comment\nprocess and interpret the rules in that way.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the problem with that\nis in the Ninth Circuit split about the official\nstatements, and Judge Cudahy gave a very cogent\nexplanation of why the majority just is dead wrong in\nhow it read those official comments. So you're relying\non what two judges have said the official interpretation\nwas, against the dissenting opinion and the Board itself\nsaying that's what we meant in our official comments, in\nour official comments.\nMR. BECK: Well, we -- we think that Justice\nCudahy's analysis made the same mistake that other\ncourts have made in examining the regulations, which is\nto defer to the -- the unofficial statements of the\nBoard, the Board or the Board's staff, before coming to\na conclusion about the plain meaning of the official\nregulations, the official interpretation.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And what about the\ninvited brief in the First Circuit?\nMR. BECK: Well, there's no question that\nthe invited brief is against our position, and we\ncertainly wouldn't argue otherwise. But -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You talk about the plain\nmeaning or -- I thought you agreed that the -- that the\nregulation is ambiguous.\nMR. BECK: No, we don't agree that the\nregulation is ambiguous.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I thought you did.\nMR. BECK: And I'd like to talk about that.\nSection 226.9 is the relevant change-of-terms provision,\nand it states that notice is required, quote, \"whenever\nany term required to be disclosed under section 226 is\nchanged.\" And section 226.6 in turn states that -- that\nthere is a required disclosure when -- \"of each periodic\nrate that may be used to compute the finance charge.\"\nAnd so those two sections working together\nsay that you have to -- you have to disclose when\nthere's a change of terms and -- and that one of the\nterms that has to be disclosed is the interest rate.\nAnd, in fact, the interest rate is the most important\ndisclosure -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But the rate -- the rate\nthat may be charged -\nMR. BECK: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- hasn't been changed.\nThat still remains what it was.\nMR. BECK: All right. But I don't think the\nword \"may\" here can be read to exclude the requirement\nthat the bank also disclose the rates that are charged.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Ah. No, you're the one\nthat's reading it to say something different from what\nit says. It says the rates that may be charged. That's\nthe term, \"these rates may be charged.\" That term\nhadn't been changed. You want to change it to \"the\nrates that are charged.\"\nMR. BECK: But even -- even the Board and\neven Chase does not argue that you do not have to\ndisclose the actual -- the actual purchase rate at the\nbeginning of the agreement. Everybody agrees that that\nhas to be disclosed, and that has to be disclosed with\nspecificity. So the word \"may\" has to include the -\nboth rates that might be applied and rates that are\napplied.\nAnd the reason the word \"may\" has to be\nthere is because it's quite possible that a -- that a\nrate may never come into play. For example, if you have\nan initial rate that changes at the end of 6 months and\nyou leave the credit card before the 6 months are up,\nthen that new rate will never come into play. But that\ndoesn't mean you don't also have to disclose the rate\nthat happened at the beginning of the credit card\nagreement.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I think it's at least\na horse race, and that brings us back to how much\ndeference you give to the -- to the Board.\nMR. BECK: Uh-huh. And I -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're trying to make the\nargument that it's clear. The fact that it says \"may be\ncharged\" alone makes it unclear, it seems to me.\nMR. BECK: Well, I would say that even the\nGovernment doesn't -- doesn't agree with that, that\n\"may\" means that. Because that would -- the Government\ndoesn't argue initial disclosures don't have to be\nspecific and don't have to be -- don't have to be made.\nThe Government's argument is a little bit\ndifferent. What they're saying is that the word \"term\"\nin section 226.9 means contractual terms rather than\ncredit terms. And that's a different argument because\nit doesn't -- it wouldn't -- it wouldn't affect the\ninitial disclosures. It would only -- it would only\nmean that you don't have to give subsequent notice if\nyou haven't changed the contract in the first instance.\nAnd so these are actually somewhat -\nsomewhat different theories. And under the Government's\ntheory, there would be no role for section 226.9 to play\nbecause you would -- the only times it would come into\nplay is when there's a change in the contract. And any\ntime there's a change in the contract, under the basic\ncontract law of every State, you have to provide notice\nat least to the other party to the contract. So the\nonly time notice would be required under section 226.9\nwould be when the -- when contract law requires that\nnotice to be given anyway.\nAnd even worse than that, it would -- it\nwould actually cut back on the required notice that\nwould be available under contract law, because, for\nexample, Delaware says you have to give 15 days' advance\nnotice of a change in terms to a credit card agreement\nin the event of a default. And under this reading, you\nwould -- even if the creditor changed the terms of the\ncontract, as in increased the default rate above the\nmaximum that the contract would authorize, so the\ncontract says we can charge you 30 percent in the event\nof a default and you impose an interest rate of\n100 percent -- then even in those circumstances, you\nonly have to provide contemporaneous notice of the\nchange. So you would basically have to put a letter in\nthe mailbox on the day that you implement the new\n100 percent interest rate that was not disclosed in the\ninitial agreement.\nAnd our submission is that that's not a\nreasonable interpretation of section 226.9. And it is\ntrue that the rules have been amended, but we have to\nlook at the purpose of the rules from the point of view\nof the -- of the Board which enacted those rules in\n1981. And you can't assume that the Board at that time\nexpected a set of rules that would never -- that would\nnever require subsequent notice to be -- to be supplied\nunless there is a change in the terms of a contract, in\nwhich -- in which notice would have to be required\nanyway.\nThe next point that the parties -- aside\nfrom the language of the -- of the regulation itself,\nthe parties rely on the official staff commentary, as do\nwe, in supporting their position. And the parties argue\nthat the word \"specific\" allows them to -- I'm sorry -\nthe Government and Chase Bank argue that the word\n\"specific\" allows them to specify in advance only the\nmaximum rate and that the word \"specific\" encompasses a\nmaximum and the circumstances of causing that maximum to\ngo in effect of a universal default situation, where if\nyou default to any creditor or make a late payment to\nany creditor, then it triggers the new rate, which goes\nup to a discretionary maximum.\nIt's our contention that that kind of\nsituation of a universal default and a discretionary\nmaximum rate is not a specific disclosure under any\nsense of the word. And -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So we're getting back to\nwhat was my initial question. So you say you can't have\nflexibility that would favor the cardholder. If the\ninitial notice is to count, then it has to be a fixed\nrate and the company can't exercise discretion to reduce\nthe rate. That's what you're saying: A fixed rate\nwould be okay. The problem with this is the company\nprovided flexibility to reduce the rate in the interest\nof the cardholder.\nMR. BECK: That's one of the problems. The\nother problems are that the triggering event is not\nspecific enough and that it applies retroactively.\nBut, as to that problem, which we -- we do\nagree is a problem, that's a result of the Board's\ndecision to allow reductions in interest rates without\nrequiring notice. And if it were true that that meant\nthat there's no point in giving a specific interest rate\nbecause it could always, after all, be lower -\nJUSTICE BREYER: It doesn't say \"specific\ninterest rate.\" I mean, my understanding of it -- and\nI'm asking, so you can correct me if that isn't so -- is\nthere's a regulation, Regulation Z.\nMR. BECK: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And then the staff put out\nsome commentary and says here's what that means, among\nother things: That the creditor can increase the rate\nat its discretion, and you've got to give notice. You\nhave to give notice, but you have to give some more\nnotice if the original notice does not include specific\nterms for an increase.\nAnd then they give an example. Suppose the\nincrease could occur under the creditor's contract\nreservation right to increase the periodic rate.\nMR. BECK: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's a little obscure.\nAs I say it, I'm not sure what I'm talking about. So\nthen, later on, the Board puts out another -- not called\nofficial staff commentary, but they say: We'll tell you\nwhat that specific -- word \"specific\" terms mean. It\nmeans when they didn't say anything about the interest\nrate or they didn't say when in fact they were going to\nincrease the interest rate from X to Y, then they didn't\ngive specific notice.\nBut they did give specific notice if they\ntold you when it would increase, by default -- when you\ndefault. And they did give specific notice when they\ntold you what the maximum it would go up to was, like 8\npercent or 18 or whatever it is. Okay? So that's the\nBoard's interpretation of its official staff commentary,\nwhich in turn is an interpretation of the reg.\nSo if we're supposed to defer to their\ninterpretation of their own reg -- I mean, my goodness,\nwouldn't we defer like double to their own\ninterpretation of their own staff commentary, which is\nan interpretation of a reg which they have an authority\nto issue under the -- you see my point.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BECK: I see your point, Justice Breyer.\nBut I would say that when you're talking about an\ninterpretation of an interpretation, you're even further\naway from the original congressional intent that's\nempowering these kinds of interpretations. So I don't\nthink that would -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, that would be an\nargument you could make. You could say that -- that\ntheir interpretation here exceeds their authority under\nthe statute. Now, of course, if you're right about\nthat, all this stuff goes out the window.\nMR. BECK: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But it's a pretty hard\nargument to make that one, I think.\nMR. BECK: And we're not making that\nargument, Your Honor. But what we are saying is -- is\nthat when you look at the interpretation, you have to\njudge it based on the authority that comes with it and\nthe deliberation that comes with it.\nAnd in this case, we know that the Board\nitself has designated the official staff commentary with\nnotice-and-comment process as the way that it wants to\nofficially interpret rules. And there's good reason for\nthat, because the Board was concerned, as Congress was\nconcerned, that there was all these differing\ninterpretations of the -- of Regulation Z that were\ngoing out in the form of opinion letters.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What's left of your\narguments if we decide that the statute is ambiguous,\nthe official staff commentary is ambiguous? What's\nleft? Is Auer deference then required?\nMR. BECK: I think -- I think Auer -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: To -- to the amicus\nbrief at least? We can talk about whether the ANPRs or\nthe unofficial commentaries are -- are due deference.\nBut what are we left with if we think there is\nambiguity?\nMR. BECK: I think in that case that the\nCourt would have to defer to some degree to the brief,\nbecause that would be the only source of the Board's\nopinion in that case.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So your case rises and\nfalls on whether we believe that the statute is clear?\nMR. BECK: The regulation and the official\nstaff commentary.\nBut I would also say that that deference\ndoes not have to be conclusive, and it should not be\ngiven the force of law, even to the brief, because the\nagency has said that it doesn't -- it specified the\nofficial staff commentary so that there aren't these\nmultiplicity of different opinions going out,\ninterpretations of Regulation Z that are difficult for\nbanks to access to figure out what their obligations are\nunder the regulations.\nAnd -- and so the Board itself doesn't want\nopinion letters and briefs and things to be -- to be\ninterpreted as -- with the force of law, because that\nwould, you know -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that's a different\nquestion. You're claiming that the Board's regulations\nsupersede whatever deference Auer would otherwise give\nto amicus briefs?\nMR. BECK: Yes. I think that's right or at\nleast limit that deference. I think that the Court\nshould at least -- should at least view the brief with\nmore skepticism, given that the Board has wanted this\nvery careful deliberative process for making its rules.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Bauer, if -- most of\nyour argument seems to rely on the official staff\ncommentary, but the official staff commentary itself\nseems to me to cut against you. It says no notice may\nbe -- need be given if the specific change is set forth\ninitially. And then it gives examples of what that\nmeans. And it says such as an increase that occurs when\nthe consumer has been under an agreement to maintain a\ncertain balance in a savings account in order to keep a\nparticular rate and the account balance falls below the\nspecified minimum.\nSo the example that they give is an example\nwhere there's a triggering event and there's a penalty\nrate that comes into effect as a result of the\ntriggering event. And that's exactly what is true here.\nMR. BECK: Yes, but in that case, Justice\nKagan, you know for certain anyone who has a bank\naccount can know what the balance of that bank account\nis. And so there's no uncertainty about whether the\nbalance triggering event is satisfied. And then there's\nno uncertainty about what the resulting rate is because\nsection 226.6 says you have to disclose each interest\nrate and the range of balances to which it is\napplicable. So you have to know both the interest rate\nand you have to know the triggering event. And that's\nvery different from a case where you're not sure, first\nof all, whether the bank is going to use its discretion\nat all. You don't know for sure whether your -- whether\nthere's anything negative on your credit report that\nwould even trigger that discretion to begin with. And\nyou don't know, if the discretion is triggered, what the\nrate will be because the bank reserves discretion to set\nit anywhere up to the maximum.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, on the triggering\nevent first, it's true that you might know your account\nbalance, but it's also true that you might know whether\nyou paid your bills on time. What's the difference?\nMR. BECK: Well, as -- there's the\ndiscretionary difference, for example. There's no -- in\nthe bank situation, the rate is automatic and is not\nbased -- it doesn't just trigger an exercise of\ndiscretion.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I don't see that in\nthe example that's given. I don't see that it limits it\nto a situation in which there is an automatic increase\nin your rate rather than a discretionary increase in\nyour rate.\nMR. Beck: Well, for that, I would look to\nsection 226.6(a)(2), which says that each periodic rate\nand the range of balances to which it is applicable must\nbe set forth initially. And so you know from the very\nbeginning which balances on your account will trigger a\ncertain interest rate. And so there's no -- in that\ncase, there's no uncertainty. But the other difference\nis that in the bank account situation, your balance is\neither above the maximum or below the maximum.\nBut when you're talking about universal\ndefault, it's not always going to be obvious to you,\nfirst of all, whether anyone has reported anything to\nthe credit agency. Oftentimes, certain creditors will\noverlook a certain late payment, for example, and maybe\nthey reported one and it might not show up on your\nExperian credit report for months or years later, and\nthen you will not know at what point it comes into play.\nSo you would -- the only way to know for sure in that\ncircumstance is to subscribe to the Experian credit\nreporting service just like Chase does so that you would\nknow when there's any negative events that are reported\nto the credit agency that would possibly trigger Chase's\ndiscretion, but even in that case you wouldn't know for\nsure whether Chase had implemented its discretion or\nnot.\nAnd I wanted to say that the -- that the\ngovernment -- its own interpretation of the regulation\nis, especially when considering the amendment, is itself\ninconsistent, because the government says that the new\nregulation fixed the problem. But the new regulation\nuses the same language as the old regulation when it\ncomes to what's required for a -- for a later change.\nIt does carve out the default rate situation as a\nspecial case. But for every other kind of rate increase\nthat has happened subsequent to the initial disclosure,\nit still uses as a triggering event any change in terms\nrequired to be disclosed by section 226.6.\nAnd if it were true that -- that what the\nBoard wanted to do was fix this ambiguity and this\nproblem that was set forth in -- that was in the\noriginal regulations, then it would be very, very\nunlikely that the government would then implement the\nsame language in the amended regulation and leave that\nsame ambiguity in place rather than clarifying exactly\nwhen subsequent notice would be required.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm not following that\nargument. I thought that the new regulation says now\nany time there is a change in the rate, whether it was\nannounced originally or comes up later, just keeping it\nnice and simple, a rate change, you send notice. And\nyou've got -- and you have to do it -- give 45 days'\nnotice. I thought that that's what the new regulation\nwas.\nMR. BECK: That's why I am saying the\ngovernment is inconsistent because that's what the\ngovernment says that it does, but what it -- what the\nregulation actually says in 226.6(c), the new version,\nany change required to be disclosed -- a change in any\nterm required to be disclosed by section 226.6 is the\nsame thing. It is true that there's a new subsection\n(g) that applies just to default rates, and it's very\nextensive because it covers a lot of aspects of default\nrates. So now I think it is clear that default rate\nincreases would have to be disclosed. So the problem in\nthis case would certainly be resolved.\nBut the Government's position is that -\nthat there was a consolidation of all change notices\ninto one 45-day notice period, and that's not clear from\nthe regulation because it still uses this same ambiguous\nlanguage that was in the old version. So I think the\nCourt -- the Court should -- and for us that's an\nindependent reason for the Court to view skeptically the\nGovernment's submissions in this case and to view it\nwith some skepticism instead of granting it the force of\nlaw, because the Court should -- should consider that.\nThe Board itself hasn't -- hasn't adopted a consistent\ninterpretation of the language at issue.\nUnless there are any further questions -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Beck.\nMR. BECK: Thank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Waxman, you have\n3 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. WAXMAN: May it please the Court:\nJust three small points. My interest was\npiqued when Justice Breyer said that he acknowledged\nthat he may have no idea what he was talking about in -\nwith respect to a reservation of rights. And I just\nwant to be clear that reservation of rights clauses,\nwhich are also referred to as change-in-terms clauses,\nare ubiquitous in these -- in contracts and initial\ndisclosures. They are a term of art, as the Board has\nrecognized. And what they are is simply a statement by\nthe credit card issuer in a consumer open-credit account\narrangement that, you know, it may decide to change any\nterm in any respect at any time. And the Board's\nregulations make clear that if you do that, that is if\nyou implement a change in terms pursuant to a\nreservation of rights clause, you have to provide\nnotice.\nNow, the specific -- what \"specific\" means\nin the commentary to the regulation, which is a question\nthat Justice Kagan asked, it seems to me was absolutely\nexplained by the Board in a 1998 amendment to Regulation\nZ, which is comment 6(a)(2)-11, which is reprinted in\nrelevant part on page A of our blue brief. This really\nis in our blue brief.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So in your view, that's\nstaff commentary, the staff thing means -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Page A?\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- look, if you didn't\nsay -\nMR. WAXMAN: Page 8.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: 8.\nMR. WAXMAN: 8.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If you failed to say in\nyour original notice that default is the trigger, then\nyou would have to give another notice?\nMR. WAXMAN: Correct. You have to -- I\nmean, what it says -- and I'm quoting from, like,\nfour-fifths of the way down page 8 -- quote: \"If the\ninitial rate may increase upon the occurrence of one or\nmore specific events, such as a late payment or an\nextension of credit that exceeds the credit limit, the\ncreditor must disclose the initial rate and the\nincreased penalty rate that may apply.\" And this was an\namendment in 1998 that the Board made to Reg Z in what\nit recognized, what it stated was on account of the\nincreased use of default penalty terms in the initial\ndisclosures, that it wanted to make clear that if both\nthe triggering event and the maximum rate was specified,\nthere would be no change in terms if an increased rate\nwere implemented.\nAnd finally, I just want to address my\nfriend's point that there may be some question about\nwhether TILA even authorizes the Board's explanation of\nthe type of subsequent disclosure that was or wasn't\nrequired and underscore Mr. Palmore's observation that\nin TILA until 2009, there was a requirement for initial\ndisclosures, there was a requirement for periodic\nstatements, but nothing at all about subsequent\ndisclosures. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
