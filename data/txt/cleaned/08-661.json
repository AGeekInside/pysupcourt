The National Football League.\nMr. Nager.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GLEN D. NAGER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. NAGER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nIn this case, the Court of Appeals for the\nSeventh Circuit held that an agreement of the 32 teams\nof the National Football League was immune from any\nscrutiny under section 1 of the Sherman Act on the\nground that the agreement allegedly fails the\nplurality of actor requirement of this Court's\njurisprudence.\nThe 32 teams of the National Football League\nare separately owned and controlled profit-making\nenterprises. Under this Court's decision in NCAA, as\nwell as the Court's more general joint venture\njurisprudence, those clubs are entities whose distinct\nagreements are, indeed, subject to section 1 scrutiny.\nThe fact of the matter is there is a long\nstanding consensus, judicial and legislative, that\nagreements among sports teams about whether and how\nthey will participate in the marketplace is subject to\nscrutiny under the Sherman Act, section 1.\nThe Court's decision in NCAA is most\ndirectly on point. In that case, the Court held that\na policy of the NCAA that restricted the ability of\nmember institutions of the NCAA to sell TV rights\nviolated section 1. Just as with the NFL, the\ndecisions of the NCAA were ultimately controlled by\nthe vote of its members, and for that reason, the\nCourt held that the NCAA policy was a horizontal\nrestraint, and it --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But there was no joint\nventure with respect to the television rights, meaning\nthere was no separate activity, other than the\ntelevising of the shows at issue. Here, the Solicitor\nGeneral is saying there is a joint venture, and it has\nto do with the licensing of trademarks, with their\nquality control, et cetera.\nIsn't that a substantial difference?\nMR. NAGER: No, I don't -- I don't think so,\nbecause what we're -- what we're asking about here is\n-- is the question of whether or not the agreement of\nthe teams involves a plurality of actors. And just as\nin NCAA, the members' institutions -- because they\ncontrolled the operation of the NCAA and the policy\nthat it was promulgating, there was a plurality of\nactors.\nSo, too, here, the 32 teams of the National\nFootball League have entered into an agreement and\ncontrol the use, collectively, of the trademarks and\nlogos of the individual teams. And for that reason,\nthere is concerted activity that is involved.\nJustice Sotomayor, the point that you raise\nmight be of -- a point of difference that the NFL\ncould argue in the context of an ancillary restraint\nanalysis, in the context of a rule of reason analysis,\nbut it's not a point of distinction that they can\nargue properly in the context of the concerted conduct\ninquiry.\nThe NCAA case simply applies the consistent\nteachings of this Court in cases like Sealy, BMI, and\nCopperweld, that separately owned and controlled\nentities entering into agreements -- those agreements\nconstitute concerted conduct subject to scrutiny under\nthe antitrust laws. The --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Does that cover\neverything that the NFLA does? Because everything is\nsubject to agreement. It's all concerted action. So,\nis everything under the Sherman Act, and then it goes\nto rule of reason analysis? Or are there some things\nthat escape, entirely, antitrust analysis?\nMR. NAGER: Certainly everything in the --\nthat's challenged in this case, because this involves\na restriction on the activities of the venturers\nthemselves. But more generally, I would -- I would\nanswer your question, Justice Ginsburg, to say that\nyes, that everything that these 32 separately owned\nand controlled teams joined together to do by -- in\nconcert, by agreement, by consent, is a contract.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Changes in the -- in the\nrule apply? They make a change to make it -- give\nthe passer more protection, but there's -- this really\nhurts certain teams, which mostly run, and so -- rule\nof reason?\nMR. NAGER: Yes, it is concerted activity.\nI don't think it would be a plausible rule of reason\nclaim.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, how -- you know the\nlitigation system. How do we know?\nMR. NAGER: Well, I think we know the\nfollowing, Justice Kennedy: That under this Court's\nrule of reasons jurisprudence, a plaintiff has to be\nable to plead an identifiable anticompetitive effect\nin a market in which the defendant plausibly has\nmarket power, and the -- the plaintiff also has to be\none who can --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, my -- my\nhypothetical: Two or three teams which aren't\nparticularly popular in the league are hurt by the\nrule change. And --\nMR. NAGER: That --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And notice, there's --\nthat the owners sit around the room, they are liable\nfor a conspiracy. I mean, this is serious stuff.\nTriple damages.\nI don't -- and my question, really, was the\nsame as Justice Ginsburg's. Can you give us a zone\nwhere we are sure a rule of reason inquiry will be --\nwould be inappropriate? We can take care of it on\nsummary judgment. Because if you don't have some sort\nof section 1 carve-out for joint action, then -- then\neverything is under the rule of reason.\nMR. NAGER: Well, Justice Kennedy, let me\nanswer your question in two parts. First of all, to\nthe extent that the Court is looking for a zone, the\nconcerted conduct doctrine is the wrong place to do\nit, because remember, if something is deemed not to be\nconcerted conduct, it is a per -- then it's per se,\nnot subject to section 1 and per se legal. And I\nthink for the Court's jurisprudence over the last\n30 years, the Court has been trying to get out of per\nse rules and have a more focused inquiry into what the\nanticompetitive effects and pro-competitive effects of\na particular restraint are. The concerted conduct\ndoctrine would be a very blunt tool to use for that\npurpose.\nNow, that is not to say -- and I appreciate\nyour question -- in the NCAA case itself, where\nconditions of competition and the like were raised,\nJustice Stevens's opinion for the Court says that in\ncontrast to the TV restraint, these other types of\nrules and regulations of the sports league are\npresumptively competitive, pro-competitive,\npresumptively favorable to consumers, because they are\nintegral and bound up with the creation of the\nfootball venture itself.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, let me give you\nanother example that you mention in your brief. The\nNFL teams agree among themselves regarding scheduling:\nThey'll play 16 games a year and they will have a\nplayoff schedule and they won't play any other games.\nNow, would that be a clear case under the rule of\nreason? You mention and some of your amici mention\nthat, for example, the English football leagues\noperate very differently.\nMR. NAGER: Justice Alito, if I -- I may not\nhave gotten all of your question, but let me answer it\nin two parts. The antitrust laws do not require joint\nventures to maximize output. They don't require joint\nventures to maximize competition. They simply\nprohibit people entering into contracts from\nunreasonably restraining trade.\nSo a mere agreement among the team owners\nthat they would have a 14-game schedule rather than a\n16-game schedule is not a prima facie showing of an\nanticompetitive impact, because all it's showing us is\nwhat the joint venturers have done with their own\noutput. They have -- you haven't alleged a\nmarket-wide reduction in output. Now, if by your\nquestion you were saying, in addition --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, what if one of the\nteam wants -- one of the teams wants to play\nadditional games --\nMR. NAGER: Well --\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- against a rival team\nwhere they will get more money?\nMR. NAGER: What I -- what I was going to\njump right to is: If in addition to changing the\nleague schedule, the team owners in concert agreed to\nprohibit the teams of the National Football League\nfrom -- from playing any other games -- doing an\nexhibition game in Japan, the Redskins and the Giants\nplaying another game -- that might show a market-wide\nreduction in output. And the Court's decision in NCAA\nsays very specifically that the most important\ncondition of ensuring the competitiveness of joint\nventures is ensuring the freedom of the individual\nventurers to produce output, increase output.\nNow, that doesn't mean that a league rule of\nthat type would be unlawful. All I'm trying to\nsuggest is if, in addition to changing the schedule of\ngames for the league, they also imposed a restriction\non the individual venturers from producing additional\ngames on their own, we might have something that\nlooked more like a plausible rule of restraint --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They couldn't -- they\ncouldn't stop that team from joining another league?\nLet's assume -- and I -- you know, I don't know enough\nabout football, but let's assume there are two leagues\nplaying. One of them plays on Saturday and the other\nplays on Sunday. You're suggesting that the venture\ncouldn't stop their members from joining that other\nleague? What's the purpose of being in a venture if\n-- if you are free to reject it and go to somewhere\nelse?\nMR. NAGER: What I'm saying is, first of\nall, it would plainly be concerted activity on the\npart of the team owners because they would have\nentered into a horizontal restraint on the activity of\nthe venturers. Whether or not that horizontal\nrestraint violated the antitrust laws, one would have\nto go through the following analysis, Justice\nSotomayor: First, we would ask whether or not that\nrestriction is an ancillary -- an ancillary restraint.\nAnd an ancillary restraint, starting with\nJudge Taft, later Chief Justice Taft's, opinion in the\nAddison Pipe case, is: Is that restraint reasonably\nnecessary to achieve the efficiency-enhancing purposes\nof the joint venture and is it no broader than\nnecessary?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It seems --\nMR. NAGER: And if it is, then we would\nanalyze that restraint by reference not only to its\nown pro-competitive benefits and anticompetitive\neffects; we would analyze it by reference to the\nbenefits of the joint venture as a whole.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, it seems to\nme -- your last few answers seem to me to beg the\nquestion. You start out by saying, well, obviously\nit's a horizontal agreement among the teams, and then\nyou explain how you are going to analyze it.\nI thought that was the very question before\nus: Whether these sorts of rules and regulations are\nhorizontal agreements between the teams or whether\nthey are part of a particular -- a single entity's\narticulation of rules.\nMR. NAGER: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, you are\nexactly right, and the real --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That you have been\nbegging the question? Is that -- that part?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. NAGER: Well, let me try to address\nJustice Sotomayor's subsequent question in the context\nof the way you are posing the question,\nMr. Chief Justice.\nThe reason it's a horizontal restraint is\nbecause these -- under the Court's doctrine,\nconsistent teachings, whether it be Sealy, BMI,\nCopperweld, these teams are separately owned. They're\nseparate decision-makers joining together, and they're\nmaking a decision about how they are going to jointly\nproduce something or not produce something. And\nthat's what makes it concerted activity under this\nCourt's consistent teachings. The distinction between\nunilateral activity under section 1 and concerted\nactivity under section 1 has consistently been the\ndistinction between ownership integration of assets --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Can I --\nMR. NAGER: -- and contract integration of\nassets.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Can I interrupt with this\nquestion? Is it not part of your burden not only to\nargue there are multiple actors, but also that their\nagreement has an adverse effect on competition?\nMR. NAGER: It -- absolutely, as the\nplaintiff in the case, Justice Stevens, that we do.\nThat is not the ground of decision of the court below.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I understand it isn't, but\nit is part of your burden to say that this is not a\npro-competitive agreement.\nMR. NAGER: Absolutely. And I'm not --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But not -- not here.\nMR. NAGER: In the -- I'm sorry, Justice --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not here.\nMR. NAGER: I -- I don't have to argue -- I\nmean, I don't think I have to argue in this Court. I\njust have to answer your questions, but --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, you at least have to\nrelate it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If -- if we find for you\nand it goes back, then you would -- you would bear\nthat burden.\nMR. NAGER: That's correct. And, in fact,\nin this case, Justice Stevens, I would point out that\nthe NFL initially moved to dismiss the -- the rule of\nreason count on the ground that it didn't state a\ncognizable, plausible rule of reason claim, and the\ndistrict court judge denied that motion.\nHe found that the complaint alleged a market\nin which he could not say, as a matter of law, that\nthe NFL defendants did not have market power, and he\nrecognized that the -- that the teams had agreed\ntogether to prohibit competition in an aspect of their\nlicensing activity and in an aspect of their\nmerchandising activity.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How does it work?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But what if he -- what if\nhe further concluded that the agreement had the\noverall effect of stimulating additional -- it was\npro-competitive in that it would equalize the economic\nstrength of the teams and, therefore, made them all\nbetter competitors on the playing field? Would that\nhave been a defense?\nMR. NAGER: I'm sorry, Justice Stevens, I'm\nnot quite sure. I thought you were saying if in the\nresponse to a motion to dismiss --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Right.\nMR. NAGER: -- he had -- had held --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: He said: Sure, there's an\nagreement here, but the burden is on the plaintiff to\nshow that the agreement has an adverse effect on\ncompetition. And that the -- as I understand the\nfacts, you've -- there's revenue sharing here, isn't\nthere? That they -- they all share in the product of\nthe sales of the joint product?\nMR. NAGER: Well, let me explain what\nthey've done, and I will then explain why it does have\na -- identifiable anticompetitive effects, which\ncertainly satisfy the pleading standards for a rule of\nreason claim.\nWhat the teams did here was they got\ntogether and they agreed that they would not\nthemselves individually license their trademarks or\nlogos. They agreed that they -- under -- the current\nmarket system included the issuance of multiple\nblanket licenses. They would eliminate all but one of\nthose blanket licenses from the market, and they would\ngive it in the exclusive control of Reebok, and they\nwould limit the circumstances in which they competed\nagainst each other and with Reebok, and said --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So I thought --\nI thought -- as I read your complaint, almost every\nword of it had to do with pro -- per se violations.\nSo I forget those here, right?\nMR. NAGER: The per se violation was\ndismissed and --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You forget -- just yes or\nno. I forget it. Okay.\nMR. NAGER: -- is not before the Court.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, I've suddenly heard\nyou talk -- the only thing left I could see was where\nyou say, by their agreement to grant an exclusive\nlicense to Reebok, they unreasonably restrained trade\nin the markets. That's what I'm supposed to focus on?\nMR. NAGER: Well, no. What I -- what I\nwould say, Justice --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What other paragraph do you\nwant me to focus on?\nMR. NAGER: Well, what I would point you to\nis the statement -- I mean, if --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, I'm interested in the\ncomplaint at the moment.\nMR. NAGER: What the complaint talks about\nis the granting of an exclusive license here.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Okay. So I'm looking\nat the complaint.\nMR. NAGER: -- with the exclusivity as to --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Fine. I get the point.\nI'm asking a question. And I just heard you say that\nyou want, for example, were it -- you want the\nPatriots to sell T-shirts in competition with the\nSaints, or whoever. The Red Sox. All right. You see\nthe point? The Red Sox -- I know baseball better.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: You want the Red Sox to\ncompete in selling T-shirts with the Yankees; is that\nright?\nMR. NAGER: The ability to compete. Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Okay. I don't know a\nRed Sox fan who would take a Yankees sweatshirt if you\ngave it away.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, I don't know where\nyou're going to get your expert from that is going to\nsay there is competition --\nMR. NAGER: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYRE: -- between those two\nproducts. I think they would rather -- they would\nrather wear a baseball, a football, a hockey shirt.\nMR. NAGER: I understand the -- the point.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But you're going to go back\nand prove that actually there is competition between\nthose --\nMR. NAGER: Well, I understand the point you\nare making. I would also make the point that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is that what this case is\nabout?\nMR. NAGER: In part. But you've got to\nrecognize what the competition is for. The\ncompetition is for fans. And the fact of the matter\nis you're right that someone who has lived in New York\nCity for a long time is unlikely to be a Red Sox fan\nand easily be persuaded to be a Red Sox fan, but the\nperson who is 3 years old can easily be persuaded.\nJUSTICE BREYER: They have very small\nallowances, the 3-year-olds.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. You think -- I\nguess you have a right to that. I'm not -- you have a\nright, but that's what you're going to have to try --\nMR. NAGER: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYRE: -- to prove: That they're\n--\nMR. NAGER: But the other point I would make\nis --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMr. NAGER: -- that's just showing that each\nteam has substantial market power.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMr. NAGER: And again, they --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But I'm trying to look --\nwhat I'm trying to get in my mind is what specific\nrestraint you are focusing on.\nYou listed three or four, and one of them is\nyou want, in effect -- I'm joking about it, but it's\ntrue -- you are arguing that the Yankees should\ncompete with the Red Sox in selling shirts.\nAnother thing you are complaining about,\nwhich is the one I understand less, is that these\nteams got together and they agreed that they would\njust have one person sell all this stuff together.\nAnd what you think is that they individually should\nhave decided whether to choose that one person, or\nmaybe to choose two people, or three.\nMR. NAGER: We --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is that right?\nMR. NAGER: Not quite.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Nager, do I have to\nfigure this out here? Is --\nMR. NAGER: No.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is this issue before us\nhere? Or is it just the issue of whether the lower\ncourt was wrong to dismiss your suit on the basis that\nthis is a unitary operation?\nMR. NAGER: You're --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought that was the only\nissue.\nMR. NAGER: That is the only issue,\nJustice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why am I worrying\nabout this other stuff?\nMR. NAGER: Because counsel has an\nobligation to respond to questions.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: I find --\nMR. NAGER: I appreciate, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I find it easier --\nMr. NAGER: You'd be a good blocker.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- to think about the case\nif I know what's going on. And I'm not certain this\nis irrelevant, but given Justice Scalia's persuasive\nremark, I will withdraw my question.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. NAGER: Thank you, Justice Breyer.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but it seems to me\nwhat we are doing is exploring the consequences of\ncompletely discarding the unitary theory.\nMR. NAGER: Well, we're not --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And so -- and the earlier\nquestions, it seemed to me, were helpful. The\nSaturday/Sunday scheduling issue, it seems to me,\npretty clearly on its face does limit competition.\nYou -- you have one day instead of two days.\nThen Justice Stevens said: Suppose it makes\nthem better players because they are rested and so\nthey can perform better. I take it that was the\npurpose of the question. And I -- I still don't get\nany answers. I don't know where we are with this.\nMR. NAGER: The answer to --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and it's a\ndifficult area, but I'd like -- and -- but I'd like\nsome guidance.\nMR. NAGER: Well, the guidance I would give\nyou, Justice Kennedy, is that as Justice Scalia says,\nthe only question before the Court is whether or not\nthese agreements constitute concerted activity. They\nplainly do, because they are agreements between\nseparately owned and controlled competing businesses.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Nager, I think you\nanswered my question originally: Yes, everything.\nBecause they are separate entities, they agree on\neverything. There's agreement in every case. So\nthere's nothing that you would take outside, and you\nput everything under the rule of reason analysis.\nMR. NAGER: That -- that is correct. But\nthat doesn't mean that the rule of reason is some\nunstructured, indeterminate --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: One -- one concern in the\nlitigation is, you know, if it doesn't come under the\nSherman Act at all, they go home after the case is\ndismissed on the -- on the pleadings.\nBut once you say no, it's got to be a rule\nof reason analysis, then you have discovery, which can\nbe costly. And I thought that that was a feature of\nthis case, that the -- that the plaintiff wanted more\ndiscovery, and the court said: You've had enough.\nMR. NAGER: Well, no. The -- the judge only\nallowed discovery on the single entity issue. He did\nnot allow discovery on -- on the rule of reason\nquestion. So there's been -- not been -- discovery on\nthe substance of the case has not been conducted.\nSo in that regard, the question of how the\ncase would be managed going forward is something that\nwould be in the hands of the district court on remand\nfrom this Court and the court of appeals, after this\nerroneous conclusion that the agreements don't\nconstitute concerted conduct is put to the side.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, could you\narticulate for me as succinctly as possible the extent\nto which your position departs from the position of\nthe Solicitor General?\nMR. NAGER: The Solicitor General's position\nis correct insofar as it criticizes the Seventh\nCircuit's reasoning.\nThe test that the Solicitor General proposes\nis conceptually and doctrinally unsound, and it will\ncreate a lack of clarity where there presently exists\nclarity in the cases, and it will produce inefficiency\nand waste in the conduct of litigation that does not\npresently exist. And I could give --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I would have\nthought it's just the transfer of the inefficiency and\nlack of clarity from the -- the first question to the\nrule of reason. I mean, I'm not quite sure it -- you\ndon't have the same problem. It's just a question of\nwhere you want to rest the inefficiency and confusion.\nMR. NAGER: Well, I understand your point,\nMr. Chief Justice: That to the extent that rule of\nreason inquiries are not as refined as they need to\nbe, since the Solicitor General's concerted conduct\ninquiry includes rule of reason inquiries -- indeed,\non its effective merger standard, it says it has to\nsurvive a rule of reason analysis or somehow be\nwaived, or you would have to do it as part of the\nconcerted conduct inquiry, so that there is no doubt\nto the extent that -- that the rule of reason is a\ncontinuing project of this Court, we would be\ntransferring some of that project into the concerted\nconduct inquiry.\nWith all respect, Mr. Chief Justice, I don't\nthink that would be a healthy development in the law.\nThe courts actually understand the concerted conduct\ndoctrine as it presently exists.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I -- I thought\nthe purpose of their submission was to respond to some\nof the questions we've seen, like scheduling, like\nwhat the rules are going to be about, about the game.\nThere are some things that it just seems odd to\nsubject to a rule of reason analysis. And you\nyourself have said: Well, that's going to be an easy\ncase under the rule of reason. Why doesn't it make\nsense to sort of carve those out at the outset, rather\nthan at the end of the case?\nMR. NAGER: Well, I think the answer is, you\nshould -- you should use English language and doctrine\nto address the issue that you are actually trying to\naddress, rather than call it something else.\nRight now, we have an antitrust doctrine\nthat says you've got to have concerted conduct and you\nhave to have an unreasonable restraint of trade. We\nhave courts that understand how to apply this Court's\ncases on concerted conduct. This Court, for\nunderstandable reasons, is sensitive to the fact that\nthe rule of reason is not quite as well understood and\nis an evolutionary doctrine, perfectly well understood\nby me.\nThere are certain issues this Court has\nsaid come up in a rule of reason analysis and, to\nquote the Court from Cal. Dental, \"can be dealt with\nin the twinkling of an eye\"; that is, some claims, as\nthe NCAA Court said, are not going to be serious rule\nof reason claims and can be dismissed on the\npleadings. The Court said that in Twombly as well.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And as I understand your\nposition, that could be the result in this case. We\ndon't know whether the district court was right or\nwrong in what he did on the -- on the rule of reason\nissue.\nMR. NAGER: In terms of what this Court --\nobviously, on my client's behalf, I have to vigorously\nstate to the Court we think we have a bona fide,\nserious rule of reason claim -- but, yes, Justice\nStevens --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And one thing I wondered\nabout the record: There is discussion in the briefs\nabout the fact that the teams share the revenues from\nthese -- these sales. Is that -- how did that get in\nthe record, the revenue sharing aspect of their -- of\nthe different teams' participation?\nMR. NAGER: Well, I -- I didn't handle the\ncase below, so I don't quite know how it got into the\nrecord. It is my -- certainly my understanding that\nthere is an affidavit in the record that says that the\nrevenues that the NFLP entity receives are distributed\nto the teams in equal shares, so that that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Would -- wouldn't that --\nthat affidavit support the conclusion that this is\nbasically a pro-competitive agreement because it tends\nto make competition stronger on the playing field,\nand, therefore, that's a sufficient defense under the\nrule of reason, and that's the end of the ball game?\nMR. NAGER: I -- I think not. You have to\nremember that that agreement to not compete and have\nonly one entity --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but you are not just\ncompeting --\nMR. NAGER: That's the very thing the case\nchallenges.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But with regard to sales\nof the paraphernalia and so forth that you have here,\nyou're not just competing among the members of the\nleague; you're competing in a market that includes all\nsports paraphernalia.\nMR. NAGER: No, our market was alleged and\nheld not to be legally invalid by the district court,\nto be NFL-logoed hats and apparel.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That assumes there is no\ncompetition between the sales of those logos and the\nsales of other sports logos.\nMR. NAGER: Well, that -- that's correct.\nAnd the district court judge held that that was a --\nbased upon this Court's decision in NCAA and the\nInternational Boxing case, was a plausible market to\nallege in which the NFL teams had market power. And\nso it would be a question for the district court\nmanaging the case going forward to determine whether\nor not that was a factually supportable market.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, you -- the\nSolicitor General is asking us to remand under his new\ntest to find out whether you are challenging the joint\nventure or challenging simply the licensing to one\nindividual or one entity. What are you doing? Do you\nhave an answer to that?\nMR. NAGER: Well, the -- the answer is --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Meaning -- I don't --\nMR. NAGER: I understood -- that the\nAmerican Needle said in the court below that what it\nwas challenging was the grant of an exclusive license\nto NFLP that prohibited the individual team\ncompetition and limited all competition in the market\nin blanket licenses.\nWhen the case came to this Court, on page 2\nof the orange brief, the NFL said they understood\nexactly what our case was -- this is on page 2, the\nsecond sentence: \"American Needle alleged that the\ndecades-old agreement among the member clubs to\ncollectively market such intellectual property was\nunlawful under Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, at\nleast after the 2001 decision to collectively license\nthe marks to a single headwear manufacturer.\"\nThe NFL stood -- understood exactly what we\nwere arguing, and they have understood it throughout\nthis case, as did the lower courts. I'm not quite\nsure why the Solicitor General doesn't understand it.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is your point that your\nclient wasn't hurt until they dealt exclusively with\none manufacturer?\nMR. NAGER: That's correct,\nJustice Ginsburg.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So you have nothing --\nyou had no damages before?\nMR. NAGER: Before.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Nager.\nMr. Stewart.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING NEITHER PARTY\nMR. STEWART: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI think that by focusing on a rather mundane\naspect of the NFL commissioner's powers, this may help\nto explain why the United States is not four-square in\nsupport of either party's theory in this case. Among\nthe powers that is vested in the commissioner by the\nNFL -- by the NFL constitution is the power to incur\nexpenses to carry on the ordinary business of the\nleague, and this includes renting office space, hiring\nemployees, and procuring supplies.\nAnd if the commissioner, pursuant to that\ndelegation of authority, decides from which company\nhe's going to -- to acquire paper for the league's\noffices or decides what the wage scale for secretaries\nin the league offices should be, our view is that\nthat's the conduct of a single entity. It may be that\nthe commissioner's power to do those things is\nultimately derived from the consent of the individual\nteams within the league, but once that consent has\nbeen given, once that authority has been centralized,\nthen the commissioner's decision about a paper\nsupplier or wages for employees --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And then the question I\nhave -- I now understand this much better in light of\nthat. And -- but I don't -- and -- and I see your\npoint. What I'm not certain about is: Is it better\nto characterize it as a single entity, in which case\nwe get into the kind of confusion that I think exists\nin this case? Or just say, look, it's a joint\nventure?\nIf Panagra creates a joint venture, of\ncourse they are going to buy things like office space\nand employees, so it's reasonable by definition. We\ndon't even look into it. Those things that are close\nenough -- take your criteria from 17, page 17, which\nare excellent criteria in my mind, and you say these\nare the criteria by which we decide whether those\nancillary parts of a joint venture that is itself\nreasonable are also reasonable.\nMR. STEWART: I guess we would say two\nthings: The first is, up to now there has been no\nsuch thing in the law as concerted action that is per\nse legal or per se reasonable.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. We wouldn't say\nper se. We are saying that the justification here:\nThey are reasonable. Why are they reasonable?\nBecause there is a legitimate joint venture, and this\nis an ancillary part of that legitimate joint venture.\nPeople can attack it, but it's going to be\nno easier to attack than if they tried to attack what\nyou call a single entity.\nMR. STEWART: I guess my point is that if,\nfor instance, a disappointed bidder for the paper\nsupply conduct -- contract challenged this as a\nsection 1 violation and said the commissioner's\ndecision to go to Staples rather than Office Depot was\nunreasonable --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I see.\nMR. STEWART: -- because Office Depot was\noffering a better product at a lower price -- that\nthere are certainly decisions that the commissioner\ncould make with respect to procurement of supplies or\nthe setting of wage levels that would be unreasonable\nin a business judgment sense, in that they wouldn't\neffectively carry on the mission of the organization,\nbut they wouldn't be unreasonable in the -- the\nsection 1 sense.\nAnd the other thing I would say is that line\nof argument could have been made in Copperweld; that\nis, the Court could have concluded that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Copperweld -- look, your\nsecond criteria opens it up to attack in precisely the\nsame way that my use of rule of reason does, because\nthey are going to have to show it doesn't\nsignificantly affect actual or potential competition.\nTherefore, they file their claim; they say they win\nunder the second criteria. That's precisely the same\nas a person filing his claim and saying it's\nunreasonable.\nWe are only talking terminology, but what\nworries me about this is the terminology, because I\nthink that the lower courts have taken Copperweld\nterminology and transferred it to a place where it\ndoes, I think, perhaps not belong.\nMR. STEWART: Well -- well, in Dagher, for\ninstance, the Court was dealing with a situation\nthat's in some ways analogous to the one that you have\nhere; that is, a joint venture in which entities that\nwere economic competitors in some aspects of their\nbusinesses joined forces with respect to other\naspects. And the Court in Dagher didn't squarely\nresolve these questions, whether section 1 applied,\nbut it said that in pricing its products, Equilon, the\njoint venture, was acting as a single firm, a single\nentity.\nThe other point I would like to make\nabout my -- my paper and employee example is that, in\nour view, the NFL commissioner, when carrying out\nthose functions on behalf of the league, would be\nacting as a single entity, even though his power was\nderived from the consent of the teams. But if the Jets\nand the Giants agreed among themselves as to what\nwages they would pay their secretaries or from whom\nthey would buy paper, that would be an entirely\ndifferent thing. The fact that those teams are for\nsome purposes part of a --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you this\nquestion, Mr. Stewart? Would the antitrust issue\nbefore us be any different if instead of giving an\nexclusive contract to one purveyor of the product, the\ncommissioner had entered into a multitude of different\ncontracts, but specified a minimum price in every one\nhe specified?\nMR. STEWART: I think the section -- the\nquestion of whether section 1 applied would not be any\ndifferent; that is, the central section 1 that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So the fact that this is\nan exclusive agreement is kind of a red herring in\nthis case, isn't it?\nMR. STEWART: It -- it may not be a red\nherring with respect to the ultimate resolution of the\ncase; that is, if the court on -- the lower court, on\nremand, if the case were remanded, applied rule of\nreason analysis, the -- the precise nature of the\ncontract might bear on whether the restraint was\nreasonable, but it wouldn't bear on the question of\nwhether concerted activity was involved; that is,\nwhat --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't -- I'm\nsorry. I didn't mean to interrupt your answer.\nMR. STEWART: I guess my point was, once --\nonce the teams decided that they would -- rather than\neach negotiating individually, either with a single\nlicensee or with multiple licensees, once they decided\nthey would negotiate as a collective and that any\npotential licensee had to go to the collective rather\nthan to the individual teams, that's the central\nsection 1 issue. And if the -- the collective had\ndecided, we will give contracts to a multitude of\npotential bidders, that would not have affected the\nfact that concerted action was involved.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So under your --\nfollowing of your paper case, are you saying that if\nthe teams delegated to the commissioner the authority\nto decide whether we are going to enter -- whether the\nleague is going to enter into one contract on logo\nproducts or let each team decide, that would be all\nright?\nMR. STEWART: That would -- that initial\ndelegation of authority would be subject to a\nsection 1 challenge, because that would be concerted\naction in the same way that the Court in Dagher\nsaid --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why isn't the\ndecision to order paper from one company rather than\nanother subject to section 1 challenge?\nMR. STEWART: Because that -- that occurs\nafter the point at which the commissioner has been\nvested with that authority.\nIf somehow a plaintiff wanted to say there\nwas an -- there was illicit concerted action when the\nteams agreed to give the commissioner this general\npower, that would be subject to section 1 review. It\nseems -- because that would be concerted action. It\nseems highly unlikely that such a challenge would\nprevail. But if --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why is that? I\nmean, if I'm Office Depot and I'm selling paper to\nthe -- to the Giants -- or does this only apply to the\ncommissioner's office?\nMR. STEWART: This only applies to carrying\nout the ordinary business of the league. It -- it\nwould only apply to the commissioner's running of --\nof the league office, not the running of the\nindividual teams. And as I say, our central point is\nthat --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could -- using your\nexample, could you tell me what the different\nquestions would be under the single control theory\nyou're proposing and a rule of reason application in\nits normal course? So, what are the questions you\nwould ask under your theory, and how do they differ\nfrom what would happen under a rule of reason\nanalysis?\nMR. STEWART: I guess under our theory, we\nwould first ask, as to an entity like this, which is\nentities that compete in some respects with --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's -- let's not go\ninto this case. Let's -- let's stay with your single\ncommissioner.\nMR. STEWART: I think we would ask first:\nIs -- is the commissioner acting as a single entity\nwhen he exercises delegated authority in making a\nbusiness judgment about which supplier to buy paper or\nwhat the wages should be?\nIf the answer is yes, then the section 1\ninquiry is over, then the case is no different from a\nchallenge to the --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, how does that stop\nany group of competitors from coming in and saying:\nGee, I want to sell my gas; I'm going to let this\nsingle commissioner decide how much my gas will sell\nfor, and if he chooses to sell it at the same price to\neverybody, both gas products, that's okay. How do you\nget to that?\nMR. STEWART: Well, I think if a single\nbusiness is deciding whether to buy paper from one\nsupplier or from several, that wouldn't be subject to\nsection 1 review, because the decision of the single\nbusiness might affect the welfare of the competitors,\nbut it wouldn't be concerted action.\nAnd our point is that when -- I think the\nway in which our position differs from that of the two\nparties is that on the one hand, I think it is the\nlogical implication of Petitioner's position that\nbecause the commissioner's authority to buy supplies\nfor the league or hire referees for the league is\nultimately derived from the consent of the individual\nteams who are independently owned, the logic of\nPetitioner's position suggests that that would be\nsubject to section 1 scrutiny.\nOn the other hand, the logic of the NFL's\nposition suggests that because the commissioner can\nset price, can decide from whom to buy paper on behalf\nof the league, the Jets and the Giants could reach a\nsimilar agreement, and the -- or the Jets and the\nGiants could agree on the prices they will pay\nsecretaries --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no, no, no,\nbecause they are not part of the broader concerted\nentity. There's no separate -- you're saying, well,\njust because all 32 teams can act as -- as an\nindividual entity, any group of those teams can act as\nan individual entity.\nMR. STEWART: I think that follows logically\nfrom the position that this is one entity. Because in\nCopperweld, for instance, the Court noted that\ncoordination between different divisions of a single\ncompany would not be subject to section 1 scrutiny,\nand that implies not just that all the divisions could\nget together, but that any two could confer among\nthemselves without raising section 1 concerns.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Levy.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGG H. LEVY\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. LEVY: Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThe formation of a professional sports\nleague, like the formation of any joint venture, may\nbe subject to section 1 scrutiny. Were it not for an\nact of Congress, the merger of the National Football\nLeague and the American Football League in 1970 would\nbe one such example. But there is no challenge to\nventure formation here.\nThere is no dispute that the NFL, including\nits licensing arm, NFL Properties, is a lawful\nventure. If venture formation is not an issue, then\ndecisions by the venture about the venture's product\nare unilateral venture decisions, unilateral venture\nactions. They are not concerted actions of the -- of\nthe venture's members.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, do we have to ask\nwhat was the intent at the beginning, as kind of an\noriginalism thing? Everybody sits around and says:\nLet's have a football league. And 20 years later,\nthey say: You know, the sale of hats and shirts is a\npretty good thing; let's get into that business, too.\nThat would -- that would -- that's case 1.\nCase 2 is, when they formed the league\ninitially, 30 years ago, they said: And be sure we\nwill sell hats, and -- I don't understand the base\npoint from which I find that this is a single entity.\nMR. LEVY: Your Honor, we know here that at\nleast as of 1963, when NFL Properties was formed, that\nthere was a single entity formed, a single entity to\nproduce and promote NFL football.\nNow, I take issue with your suggestion --\nyour implication that there was a decision made here:\nLet's set up a separate line of business; we are going\nto sell hats also. That's not what happened, and the\nrecord on that is unambiguously clear here. It's\nundisputed. Clubs --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, do you take issue\nwith my question that this is a relevant inquiry? Is\nit part of the original agreement or isn't it, and why\nis it that the original agreement is somehow\nsacrosanct? I don't understand.\nMR. LEVY: I'm not suggesting that the\noriginal agreement is sacrosanct. That's why I\nsuggested that by 1963 -- or the mid-1960s, when NFL\nProperties was formed, there was venture formation at\nthat point.\nAt that point, what was the question? The\nquestion was: How should the league, how should the\nventure members, best promote the venture product?\nAnd the decision was made to use the licenses of their\nintellectual property as a promotional tool.\nOn that issue, the discovery and the record\nbelow was undisputed. There is documentary evidence\nfrom the NFL Properties' articles of incorporation.\nThere's testimony from an NFL executive, Mr. Herzog.\nAnd the best proof, if there were any question about\nthat, is reflected in the -- the organic documents of\nNFL Properties, which at the outset said that, if\nthere were any revenues from the licensing activities,\nthey would be donated to charitable and educational\ncauses.\nNow, you know, Dagher confirmed the general\nprinciple, but if the venture is lawfully formed, the\nventure's decisions about how best to produce and\npromote its product are venture decisions, not the\ndecisions of the venture members.\nBut Copperweld provides the framework that\ndecides the issue here, and neither Mr. Stewart nor\nMr. Nager mention Copperweld, except in passing.\nCopperweld is the case by which this Court turned the\npage, if you will, on the formalism of prior cases,\nincluding Sealy, which Mr. Nager --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May -- may I ask you to\ngo back just one step? Because you seem to treat this\nas though the NFLP was formed in 1963 and that was the\nend of it, but another description is: Well, it was\nformed, but then there were some teams that were not\nin it until later, and there were some other parts,\nthat it has expanded. What it does has expanded since\n1963.\nSo it wasn't one point in time where there\nwas formation, and then if you didn't -- if you're not\nchallenging that, everything else is okay.\nMR. LEVY: Well, I -- I don't disagree with\nthat, Your Honor. I think that in 1970, the league\nexpanded. There was a merger. That merger of the\nNational Football League and the American Football\nLeague would have been subject to section 1 challenge\nbecause it involved venture formation, but an act of\nCongress said that that wasn't necessary.\nAfter 1970, there have been six teams, I\nbelieve, that have been added, essentially created, if\nyou will, like Adam's rib. They have been created\nfrom the other NFL clubs, but it's essentially the\nsame venture. The venture has expanded its production\ncapability by adding new teams. It's expanded its\noutput by adding new teams.\nAnd the role of licensing of intellectual\nproperty throughout that process has remained the\nsame. The role has been to promote the venture's\nproduct. It's not --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Excuse me. Did the\nteams -- did the NFL Properties or some centralized\nentity always exploit the trademarks of all the\nfranchises, or was there a long period of time in\nwhich they each individually franchised their\nproducts?\nMR. LEVY: The record, Your Honor, says --\nreflects that there was very little exploitation of\nintellectual property of the franchises prior to the\ncreation of NFL Properties.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But there was some, and\nthat was done by the individual teams?\nMR. LEVY: It was done, and it was done -- I\nmean, that's sort of an historic artifact. It was\ndone, I believe collectively, through Roy Rogers\nEnterprises. But the -- but the teams continued to\nown their intellectual property. That's right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The problem, as I see, for\nyou in this case is that the basic conclusion is in\nthe court of appeals, where it says: \"Viewed in this\nlight, the NFL teams are best described as a single\nsource of economic power when promoting NFL football\nthrough licensing.\" Well, how do we know that?\nMR. LEVY: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Their allegation is that\nthat isn't true. And I have -- and Copperweld just\nseems to me to be very confusing on this, since --\nsince my hornbook knowledge of it was we have\nCopperweld to deal with the case that we don't make\nbooths in department stores compete in price against\neach other. All right?\nNormally, however, we say independent\nvendors can't get together and say they fix prices.\nThat's per se. And joint ventures are in the middle,\nso we apply a rule of reason.\nNow, very simple. I thought that has been\nthe law since Panagra. I don't know what, in fact,\nCopperweld has to do with it. And they are saying\nthat this basic joint venture for promoting is not a\nreasonable agreement. So why shouldn't they have\ntheir shot? You might well win, but they want to make\nthat claim.\nMR. LEVY: The reason we know that this is\nnot your typical joint venture is because Copperweld\nestablished a standard that said that what section 1\nis intended to regulate is not matters of form, not\ngeneral market conditions, but rather the sudden\njoining together of independent sources of economic\npower. That's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Fine, but that's the\nconclusion here. That's not the -- that's the\nconclusion. The question is: Should they be\npermitted to join their centers of economic power into\none when they promote and sell their T-shirts,\nsweatshirts, et cetera?\nMR. LEVY: But --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, you can't answer that\nquestion by announcing the conclusion.\nMR. LEVY: But, Your Honor, we know that\nthey are not independent sources of economic power,\nbecause none of them can produce the product of the\nventure on their own. No NFL club can produce a\nsingle unit of production, a single game or --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, can't it ask someone\nto do that?\nOh. Oh, you are saying the game.\nMR. LEVY: That's -- that's right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What does a game to do with\nthis? I thought we were talking about T-shirts and\nhelmets, and I -- I thought it's the simplest thing in\nthe world. You pick up the phone and say: Hello,\nShanghai, do you have a helmet?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. LEVY: Your Honor, if -- if this were a\nventure designed to go out and license or manufacture\nor distribute caps, you'd be right. But this is\ndifferent, and we -- the undisputed evidence in the\nrecord below demonstrates it's different.\nIt's different because the purpose of the\nlicensing here is to promote the product. It's to\npromote the game. And the NFL member clubs are not\nindependent sources of economic power in generating\nthat game.\nJUSTICE BREYER: This is a summary judgment\nmotion?\nMR. LEVY: Yes. It was a summary judgment.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, the stated purpose is\nto promote the game. The purpose is to make money. I\ndon't think that they care whether the sale of the\nhelmet or the T-shirt promotes the game. They -- they\nsell it to make money from the sale.\nMR. LEVY: I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Now, it promotes the game\nif the money from the sale goes to the whole group, I\nsuppose. But -- but don't tell me that there is not\n-- absent this agreement, there would not be an\nindependent, individual incentive for each of the\nteams to sell as many of its own -- of its own shirts\nand helmets as possible.\nMR. LEVY: Your Honor, I'd agree with you\n100 percent that the purpose of the licensing is to\nmake money, but not necessarily to make money through\nthe royalties. The purpose of the licensing is to\nimprove and promote the attractiveness of the game\nproduct, to get more people interested in watching the\ngames on television, to get more people interested in\nbuying tickets to the game.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I suppose that --\nthat could -- that issue could be tried.\nMR. LEVY: And --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But I don't -- I don't\nthink so. And I suppose that's a triable issue, as to\nwhether the purpose of -- of selling these things is\nto promote the whole NFL or to promote the particular\nteam.\nMR. LEVY: And --\nJUSTICE SCALIS: It wants its own adherents\nand wants to sell its own product.\nMR. LEVY: In the abstract, that's a triable\nissue, Your Honor, but not here. Here, the record was\nundisputed. There's evidence in the record on that\npoint. The record -- there was evidentiary -- there\nwas documentary evidence. There's evidence that goes\nback to the organic documents of NFL Properties. And\nas I mentioned before, in the early days, the -- the\nnet revenues, if any, the net royalties of the\nlicensing operations went to charity. So there's no\n-- there's no question here. Discovery was allowed on\nthis issue, and the record is undisputed.\nSo we have a classic case, a perfect, clean\nopportunity for this Court to apply the principles of\nCopperweld and the principles of Dagher to an area of\nthe law that has been troubled for many years. Since\n1984, the courts have wrestled with the question of\nhow to deal with professional sports leagues and\nsection 1 claims against professional sports leagues.\nAnd the cases the courts have been -- have\n-- and with the exception of this case and the Bulls\nII case, the courts have been guided principally by\npre-Copperweld precedent that rests on an era of\nformalism, an era when even an agreement between a\nparent and its subsidiary --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What decision could the\nsports teams make that would be subject to the\nantitrust scrutiny under your definition of the\npermissible range of the joint venture activities? It\nseems to me that if the venture wanted to make sure\nall the teams hired secretaries at the same\n$1,000-a-year salary, that under your theory, that's\nokay, because it's a joint venture.\nMR. LEVY: Your Honor, my view is that the\n-- the NFL clubs are not separate sources of\nindependent power. As a result, they are a unit.\nThey are a single entity, and it's a --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So the answer to my\nquestion is there is -- you are seeking through this\nruling what you haven't gotten from Congress: an\nabsolute bar to an antitrust claim.\nMR. LEVY: No, Your Honor, that's not right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So -- so answer my\nquestion. What decision --\nMR. LEVY: The direct answer to your\nquestion is this: With regard to section 1 claims --\nlet's put aside section 2 claims. Let's put aside\nclaims between the NFL and other leagues. Let's put\naside claims that relate to nonventure conduct, like\nthe example of creating a trucking company that's\nreflected in our brief.\nThe -- I can understand an argument, and we\nsuggested as much in our brief below, that if the\nleague engages in a practice of representing itself,\ngoing to the market -- the clubs go to market as\nindependent entities. I can see an argument that\nwould basically say, based on estoppel principles,\nthat they should not be able to agree on -- on uniform\nprices or uniform wages for secretaries, for example.\nWe did -- we made the point in our brief in\nthe context of -- of coaches. But even -- even in the\ncontext of coaches, put aside for a moment, section 2\nremains available to the coaches if in fact they can\ndemonstrate that there has been monopolization or\nattempted monopolization of a market.\nBut the line that I draw is the line between\nproduction and promotion of the game. Coaches are\ncloser to production and promotion of the game than\nsecretaries, but I -- you know, there may be some --\nsome gap there. But -- but as long as the NFL clubs\nare -- are members of a unit; if they compete as a\nunit in the entertainment marketplace, as -- to use\nthe language that Justice Rehnquist used -- they\nshould be deemed a single entity and not subject to\nsection 1 --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But now the question is:\nAre you basing that on economic-related data about the\npros and the cons of -- you know, the economic harms\nof stopping them from competing versus the economic\nbenefits of allowing them to act as a separate -- as a\nsingle entity? Or are you basing it on a pure legal\nword called \"single entity\"?\nAnd what worried -- I thought when I read\nthe opinion, first, of the district court, that he's\njust following what I think started in the Seventh\nCircuit, unfortunately, of taking this word \"single\nentity\" and throwing around -- throwing it around all\nover the place and stopping the economic analysis.\nBut then when I read the last paragraphs of\nhis opinion, he seems to be saying, when I go back to\nthe record, which you want me to do, I will discover\nthat there is lots of information showing economic\nbenefit to this venture of promoting together.\nThere's nothing to suggest they could compete, and so\nit's clear, to the point where they don't get to\ntrial, that this is a reasonable agreement.\nAll right. Now, is -- have I -- am I right\nin thinking what you are thinking?\nMR. LEVY: That's not my position, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Good. Then I\nwant to know what your position is.\nMR. LEVY: My position is based on the\nintended scope of the Sherman Act, section 1 of the\nSherman Act, which this Court, in Copperweld, made\nclear. The principle is articulated five or six\nseparate times in the Copperweld opinion that section\n1 of the Sherman Act is intended to regulate the\nsudden joining together of separate sources of\neconomic power. That's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes --\nMR. LEVY: That's not this case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I wouldn't read --\ncan you read Copperweld as follows? Copperweld is\nratifying a decision by an entrepreneur or several to\norganize his entrepreneurial entity as one where there\nare obvious efficiencies in doing that, such as it\nwould obviously be inefficient to have the sales\npeople behind counters in a single department store\ncompeting with each other in price.\nA joint venture is a situation where it's\ndebatable whether or not there is that kind of\nefficiency in organization, and, therefore, we apply a\nrule of reason. That's Panagra. I don't see anything\nin Copperweld that's intended to overrule Panagra.\nAnd as long as Panagra is not overruled, we would\napply, at least to major decisions by joint ventures,\na rule of reason.\nNow, what is wrong with -- and you might\nstill win on the rule of reason. But why isn't that\nanalysis correct? I'm putting it forward as a\nhypothesis for you to discuss.\nMR. LEVY: The analysis is not correct\nbecause there has been no challenge to venture\nformation here. I don't disagree that if there had\nbeen a challenge to venture formation here, that the\nconsiderations that you identify with regard to\nPanagra would apply. But that's not the case here.\nThere's really no ambiguity about what has been\nchallenged here.\nJUSTICE BREYER: There is very definitely a\njoint venture here to play football, but there isn't a\njoint venture to build houses, and there isn't a joint\nventure obviously in sight to promote.\nSo they're saying that there's such a\ndifferent activity, the playing of football versus the\npromotion of a logo, that we ought to go and look\nunder a rule of reason as to whether a joint venture\nin promoting a logo is justified in terms of\ncompetition's harms and economic benefits.\nMR. LEVY: Justice Breyer, I agree with you\nthat there is a difference, an important difference,\nbetween venture and nonventure activity. If the NFL\nclubs were to create a trucking company or, in your\nexample, would go off and build houses, that's not a\nventure activity.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, it would be if they\ntried to do it, but, there, they would be attacked on\nthe ground that under the rule of reason, they do not\nhave the justification such that the antitrust law\nwould allow them to do it.\nMR. LEVY: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And they are saying: And\npromoting is precisely the same. That's why it seems\nto me to be something that you can't decide in theory.\nIt's a matter of going back to economic facts with\nwitnesses and so forth.\nMR. LEVY: Your Honor, the ancillary\nrestraints doctrine would enable the court, in the\ncircumstance that you describe, to categorize the\ndecision to build housing as a non-venture activity --\na non-venture decision, and, therefore, it would be\nevaluated independently of the considerations that\napply to the venturers' objective.\nBut, here, you cannot separate the -- the\nventure activity of -- of -- for both football --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, but you -- you\ncertainly could because they certainly could --\ntheoretically, each club could sell its own logo.\nMR. LEVY: Each -- of course, each club\ncould sell its own logo, Your Honor, but the clubs\nhave decided that the most effective way to promote --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: They have decided not to\ndo it that way, but it could be done.\nMR. LEVY: Forgive me. I shouldn't speak\nover you.\nThe clubs have decided that the most\neffective way to promote their product, to promote NFL\nfootball, is to do so collectively, to ensure that the\nmarks of all 32 clubs are -- are out there, in --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But maybe they also\ncollectively decide the best way to make money and\nfinance -- attendance and so forth, all agree on a\nhousing program that they all jointly sponsor.\nMR. LEVY: Well, Your Honor, that -- I\nrespectfully suggest that doesn't --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It would be the most\neffective way to -- to raise the money to pay these\nplayers who make so much money.\nMR. LEVY: Well, that doesn't -- there's a\nplausibility standard that really has to be applied in\nterms of the -- of the arguments at issue.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but if it's a\nplausibility standard at the threshold inquiry,\nthere's a range of things, and I guess your -- your\nfriend on the other side is just saying selling logos\nis closer to selling houses than it is to playing\nfootball.\nMR. LEVY: Well, but there is a difference\nhere, Your Honor, because there is a record. This --\nthis wasn't decided on a motion to dismiss. It was\ndecided on summary judgment. There was undisputed\nevidence that the purpose of the licensing, going back\n40 years -- 45 years, at this point, was to promote\nthe game, and that's not an implausible determination\nto be made, but the -- but the evidence was\nundisputed.\nThe case was decided on summary judgment,\nand so -- you know, this is not a situation where --\nwhere there's the type of -- you know, the range of\nissues that needs to be -- you know, that needs to be\nresolved, of the kind that you described.\nYou know, this is a situation that Judge\nMoran --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if there's a\nfactual -- if there's a factual dispute about whether\na particular activity of the league is designed to\npromote the game or is designed simply to make more\nmoney, than that is the sort of thing that goes to\ntrial?\nMR. LEVY: Well, I wouldn't -- I wouldn't\nput it in terms of \"make more money\" because I have\nagreed with Justice Scalia --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Or do something\nelse, do something other than promote the game?\nMR. LEVY: If -- Your Honor, just as in\nDagher -- in Dagher, the issue was how to price the\nproduct. It's a fundamental decision that any venture\nhas to make. This is a decision -- the undisputed\nevidence shows that this is a decision about how to\npromote the product, and that's no different from\npricing a product in terms of the -- you know, the\noperations of a venture.\nYou can't -- you can't hope to market a\nproduct, unless you have decided on how to promote it,\nand the antitrust laws in the Sherman Act encourage\npromotion. They encourage -- Copperweld encourages\nbusiness people to make the judgment about how best to\nproduce and to promote their product and how best to\ncompete in the marketplace.\nThey made very clear that they don't want\nthose judgments cabined or inhibited or chilled by --\nby decisions by the court or decisions by a jury.\nBut, here, Judge Moran did what we thought was the --\nand we continue to think is the most appropriate way\nto serve the interests of both the Sherman Act and the\nconsiderations that this Court has recognized in\nTwombly and other cases, and that's to provide an\nearly opportunity for a determination of whether or\nnot the venture -- the venture conduct, the venture\ndecision that is at issue, is a venture decision of a\nsingle entity or whether it is a collective decision\nof the -- of the venture participants.\nHe allowed discovery limited to the single\nentity issue. The -- the -- there is no challenge to\nthe scope of discovery here. We have a complete\nrecord on this point that confirms and addresses the\nquestion that you presented, that the purpose of\nlicensing here is to promote the product.\nBut even if it weren't -- even if it\nweren't, I'd suggest that -- that the -- the evidence\nshows that fans identify with the logos, and we are\ntalking about the logos and the marks here, not\nbecause they have some sort of intrinsic value, not\nbecause they, you know, derive -- they derive some\nvalue from their attractiveness or appeal,\nindependently in the marketplace; they derive their\nvalue from their identification with an NFL club that\ncompetes on the football field. And even -- even\nAmerican Needle's president so confirmed in the\ndeclaration that he submitted in the case.\nSo we have here a record that makes this --\nthis judgment for the Court relatively\nstraightforward. It provides a straightforward\nopportunity for this -- this Court to confirm the\nprinciples established in -- established in Copperweld\nand to -- and to extend the principles that this Court\nnoted in Dagher.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The -- if the\nreasonableness of this decision, that T-shirts promote\nthe game, is so self-evident, then why wouldn't the\nrule of reason control completely?\nMR. LEVY: Well, Your Honor, I don't have --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why do we need to even\ngo to the single-entity question when, by your own\nanswer, it is undisputed, so abundantly clear, so\nreasonable?\nMR. LEVY: The answer --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What's the need to -- to\nlabel it \"single entity,\" as opposed to label it what\nit is, reasonable?\nMR. LEVY: The answer, Your Honor, is\ninherent in the rule of reason. In the modern era,\ndefending a claim like this on the merits involves an\ninvestment of tens of millions of dollars, thousands\nof hours of executive time, hours and hours of court\ntime. In the Salvino case, there were 3 years of\ndiscovery spent on rule of reason issues --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But is not the whole\npurpose, and I certainly sympathize with that\nargument. But isn't the proposition of antitrust law\nthat we have a reason for worrying about concerted\nactivity? We have a genuine concern as -- well,\nCongress does -- about independent entities joining\ntogether and fixing prices.\nAnd we permit them to do so, as Justice\nBreyer indicated, when the venture has a purpose\nthat's independent than -- from the individual\ninterests, but we say, when it doesn't, we have to\nensure, under the rule of reason, that what they are\ndoing is reasonable.\nI'm -- I'm very swayed by your arguments,\nbut I can very much see a counterargument that\npromoting T-shirts is only to make money. It doesn't\nreally promote the game. It promotes the making of\nmoney. And once you fix prices for making money,\nthat's a Sherman Act violation.\nMR. LEVY: But, Your Honor, I would agree\nwith almost everything that you said, but we are not\ndealing here with independent sources of economic\npower. These clubs are not independent. None could\nproduce their product on their own.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But they own the\ntrademarks, so they could.\nMR. LEVY: They do, but the trademarks don't\nhave any value. They don't have any purpose\nindependent of the game. The trademarks are invented\nto identify the clubs on the field. They are -- they\nare promoted and distributed to -- to encourage\nloyalty among fans of the clubs. The -- the\ntrademarks are simply a tool that the clubs use to --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So let's call it \"NFL\nsupermarket.\" Red Sox supermarket, Patriots\nautomobile shop, Patriots tractor store -- everything\nbecomes Patriots. Everything -- no competition\nanywhere. Now, you say that's ridiculous, and once\nyou say that's ridiculous, you are now into the\nbusiness of deciding whether this aspect of the\nundeniable legal joint venture to play baseball or\nfootball -- whether this aspect is properly the\nsubject of merger.\nAnd once you're into that, you're into your\n$7 million, and I can't really think of anything\nthat's going to help you there.\nMR. LEVY: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And the SG in its brief,\nyou see, on that key 16 and 17, it seemed to me,\nsimply reproduces in precisely somewhat different\nlanguage, but precisely the argument you are now\nhaving: Is this the kind of thing that should be\nmerged? We know by applying the rule of reason.\nAnd, second, if it is merged, is this\nparticular aspect of it something where there could be\ncompetition, and there isn't much justification?\nThat's their rule, too. Again, we are back to the\nrule of reason. So, how do I save you the $7 million?\nMR. LEVY: But, Your Honor, this case is the\nperfect example. We were able to resolve this case on\nsummary judgment without incurring the burden of rule\nof reason discovery, and your reference to the\nPatriots tractor store drives home a distinction that\nI think is worth leaving with the Court at this point.\nThis is not a situation, like the situation\nto which we adverted in our brief, where John Deere\nand International Harvester get together and fix the\nprices of their logos for sale to cap manufacturers.\nJohn Deere and International Harvester, for\nmany years -- I mean, early on, they gave away the\nhats throughout the Midwest to encourage farmers to\nbuy their farm equipment. They are independent\nsources of economic power.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you -- you say that\nthe -- that the trademarks have no value apart from\nthe -- from the game. I guess you could say the same\nthing for each individual franchise of each of the 32\nclubs. They are worthless, if NFL football\ndisappears. So does that mean they -- they can agree\nto fix the price at which their -- their franchises\nwill be sold, by concerted agreement, because after\nall, they're worthless apart from the NFL?\nMR. LEVY: Well, I -- I certainly agree with\nyour -- your premise, Your Honor, that they are\nworthless apart from the -- except -- I mean, there's\nsome residual value. I don't -- I don't --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. LEVY: I don't dispute -- dispute that.\nCould they agree on prices for their franchises to be\nsold? Yes, I assume they could agree because they are\nnot independent sources of economic power.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, okay, you --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So we don't even ask the\nquestion whether under the rule of reason such a thing\nis reasonable or justified?\nMR. LEVY: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought I was reducing it\nto the absurd. But you --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. LEVY: You know, I -- I can bring the\nbasic point that I -- I want to leave you with back to\nour example that's a little bit closer to home.\nIn 1999 -- 1919, when Judge Covington and\nMr. Burling went to join forces, they formed a law\nfirm, a venture. Ninety years later, that venture\ndecides on the prices, the rates that Mr. Ludwin and I\nwill -- will decide for our -- will charge for our\nservices. Sometimes that venture, the firm, decides\nthat we won't do business with a particular client or\nthat we'll limit our business to a particular client\nin a particular industry.\nNobody suggests that that decision of the\nventure, a lawful venture, is subject to section 1\nscrutiny as a violation of the Sherman Act,\nconstitutes a concerted refusal to deal.\nBut if Mr. Ludwin and I leave the -- leave\nthe firm and we set up solo practices and then decide\non what our rates are going to be or then decide on\nwhat our -- what clients we will serve and not serve,\nthat is an agreement between independent competitors.\nThat's the fundamental difference.\nThat is a fundamentally different situation\nbetween -- compared to the situation of the firm\nsetting our rates. And it reflects the intersection\nof Copperweld and Dagher. It shows how Dagher and\nCopperweld fit together hand in glove to demonstrate\nthat the NFL, for purposes of promoting its football\nproduct, is a single entity.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Nager, you have 3 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GLEN D. NAGER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. NAGER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nI'd just like to pick up on a question that\nChief Justice Roberts asked me with a point that\nJustice Breyer made, which is that both the Solicitor\nGeneral's position and the NFL's position are taking\nrule of reason concepts and trying to push them into\nthe concerted conduct inquiry, which will have the\neffect, of course, of confusing courts that presently\nunderstand the inquiry. That's Justice Breyer's point\nabout terminology.\nIt also has substantive impact because of\nthe way litigation gets conducted. As Mr. Levy has\nsaid, this case was litigated below at the district\ncourt judge's direction only on the concerted conduct\nquestion, not on the -- the rule of reason questions.\nSo, American Needle didn't have the opportunity to\nconduct discovery and make proof about anticompetitive\neffects and to try to rebut the arguments that the NFL\nwas making about pro-competitive justifications.\nThe NFL's argument is asking -- they are\nasking for a per se rule of legality for everything\nthat the NFL does that is related to football. That\ncan't be the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What's the answer to\nthe -- what's the answer to the hypothetical Mr. Levy\nended with, the law firm?\nMR. NAGER: On the -- the partnership\nexample? Well, the partnership is -- is as follows:\nAs -- as to the extent that there's case law\non the subject, as with all joint ventures, the case\nlaw treats law firm partnerships as joint ventures and\nsubjects them to the rule of reason, and every\ncommentator, whether it be Judge Bork or anyone else,\nhas said: But, of course, law firms don't have market\npower so they couldn't possibly have anticompetitive\neffects on the market, and a rule of reason claim\ntrying to challenge the rates at which a law firm sets\nits partnership rates wouldn't pass -- survive a\nmotion to dismiss.\nWith respect to his analogy to Dagher, the\ndifference between the Dagher effects -- of course\nthis Court in Dagher didn't accept the argument that\nI made on behalf of Texaco and Shell that they should\nbe treated as a single entity if, in fact, their\nformation was lawful. This Court only ruled on the -\non the price-fixing issue.\nBut the argument that was made in Dagher was\nif you had a wholly integrated joint venture, one in\nwhich there had been a complete pooling of relevant\ncapital, a complete sharing of profits and losses, and\nan enforceable non-compete agreement, in those\ncircumstances the -- the owners of that joint venture\nwere not like typical joint venturers; they, in fact,\nwere like the shareholders in a publicly held company\nbecause their only interest at that point is in their\ninvestment. They have no other economic interests\nthat are affected by their ownership and control of\nthat entity. And at that point, they could be treated\nas one.\nAnd Justice Thomas's opinion for the Court\nhas some resonance of that in it, but it specifically\nsays it's only addressing it in terms of the per se\nrule.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
