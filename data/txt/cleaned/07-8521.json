HANSEN CHAVIS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. CHAVIS: Mr. Chief Justice and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis case is about a logical reading of the\nstatute's plain language, and section 3599(a)(2) that's\nprinted on page 1 of the blue brief provides that when a\nstate death row inmate seeks 2254 relief he shall be\nrepresented by counsel, he shall be appointed counsel by\nthe federal court. And that representation is governed\nby subsection (e). Subsection (e) that is on page 2a of\nour blue brief defines the scope of counsel's\nrepresentation and also divides that representation by\ntwo clauses that begin with the word \"shall.\"\nThis case is controlled by the second\n\"shall\" clause, which appears about four lines up from\nthe bottom of subsection (e). And that clause says\nthat: \"Counsel shall also represent the defendant in\nproceedings for executive or other clemency as may be\navailable to him.\"\nWe know that this means state clemency\nproceedings because of the words \"available\" and the\nwords \"or other.\" For a 2254 petitioner or defendant\nlike Mr. Harbison, the only type of clemency that is\navailable to him is state clemency, and in order to give\neffect to the words \"or other\" that were used by\nCongress we know that that must refer to state clemency\nbecause the only type of clemency that the Federal\nGovernment provides is executive clemency.\nNow, not only is the interpretation of this\nstatute controlled by the plain language, but this\ninterpretation makes sense, and it makes sense that\nCongress would provide for continuous representation for\na capital defendant in that it fills a need, a gap in\nrepresentation, it's efficient, and it also helps to\nimprove the reliability of the death penalty as it's\nadministered in this country.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your interpretation\nwould make all of the provisions of subsection (e)\napplicable in state proceedings, so long as there's been\na 2254 petition filed?\nMS. CHAVIS: No, Your Honor. And if I may,\nI would like to discuss the structure of subsection (e).\nAnd I believe your question would go to the very first\n\"shall\" clause, which begins at line 3 of subsection\n(e), and that would -- in that counsel that is appointed\nunder (a)(2) \"shall represent the defendant in\nsubsequent stages of judicial proceedings.\" And for the\n(a)(2) lawyer, the lawyer appointed under subsection\n(a)(2), that stage of proceeding that the representation\nbegins with is described in (e) as \"all available\npost-conviction process.\" And then it goes on for the\nremainder of the statute, together with the applications\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. Where\nare you reading, the first part, \"available\npost-conviction process\"?\nMS. CHAVIS: Right. It begins at the \"and,\"\nwhich is eight lines down or about seven lines up, right\nin the middle of subsection (e).\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that doesn't\nmodify what comes before it, does it? New trial,\nappeals? In other words, if at the end of the habeas\nproceeding things start all over then presumably the\nappointed counsel represents the defendant throughout\nall those new proceedings?\nMS. CHAVIS: No, Your Honor. With respect\nto the habeas attorney the representation would begin\nwith the \"all available post-conviction process.\" If\nthat attorney did obtain relief for the defendant or the\nfederal court granted relief for the capital defendant\nand that case were to return to state court, then of\ncourse we're not talking about continued representation\nof the federal habeas counsel because --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why not? Why not?\nMS. CHAVIS: Well, because, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That would be a subsequent\n-- a subsequent stage of available judicial proceedings,\nhis retrial in state courts.\nMS. CHAVIS: Your Honor, the retrial and the\ntrial proceedings that's referred to in subsection (e),\nthose are duties of counsel appointed under (a)(1) of\nthe statute, which is on page 1a, which would be trial\ncounsel for those defendants charged with a federal\ncapital crime.\nWe would not -- a habeas lawyer would not\nparticipate in a retrial because -- for a few reasons.\nThe first reason is because of the statute and the\nstructure of the statute, which sets out the ordinary\ncourse of the capital case, so that there's nothing\nsubsequent, no duties listed here that are a subsequent\nstage for habeas counsel.\nJUSTICE ALITO: I don't see how that's\npossible a plain reading of the statutory language. You\nstarted out by saying you're relying on the plain\nmeaning of the statutory language.\nMS. CHAVIS: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE ALITO: How do you get that out of\nthe statutory language at (e)?\nMS. CHAVIS: It's in context with the whole\nof the statute. With respect, we look at (a)(1) and\n(a)(2) for that context for subsection (e). So --\nJUSTICE ALITO: So now you're out of the\nplain language of the (e) and you're looking at the\ncontext of the whole statute.\nMS. CHAVIS: Your Honor, I would submit that\nlooking at the context of the whole statute is in\naccordance with also looking at the plain language used\nby Congress. And we do look at the statute as a whole\nin order to inform our --\nJUSTICE ALITO: What's your answer to the\nplain language of (e)? That was your prime -- that was\nthe argument you started out with, that this fell under\nthe plain language of (e).\nMS. CHAVIS: Yes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: How do you explain under the\nplain language of (e) why -- how you avoid the result\nthat once habeas counsel is appointed in federal court,\nthe counsel has to appear in all of these other\nproceedings?\nMS. CHAVIS: Yes --\nJUSTICE ALITO: New trial in state court,\netcetera.\nMS. CHAVIS: \"In all subsequent stages of\njudicial proceedings\" is exactly what subsection (e)\nstates.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you are including\nthen -- suppose that the result of the federal habeas is\nthat the State -- that relief is granted unless the\nState retries the defendant in X number of days. And\nyour reading I think would be the appointed counsel on\nfederal habeas would be responsible for representation\nin all available post-conviction process, and that would\nbe an available post-conviction process.\nMS. CHAVIS: Respectfully, Your Honor, the\nState retrial would be an entirely new case that would\nnot fall under \"all available post-conviction process.\"\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What would? Tell me,\nwhat would fall under \"all available post-conviction\nprocess\" in addition to clemency and competency\nproceedings?\nMS. CHAVIS: Your Honor, \"all available\npost-conviction process\" I submit would be defined by\nthe 2254 or 2255 proceeding, now these together with\nappropriate applications for stays and appropriate\nmotions and procedures. Now, that is a part of this\nfirst clause in subsection (e) that, under appropriate\ncircumstances, may permit the federally appointed lawyer\nto return to state court if deemed appropriate by the\nfederal court. If the federal court found that an issue\nin the federal habeas case needed to be exhausted in\norder to aid that judge's determination of the habeas\npetition, then it would be appropriate for the federal\njudge to say: Counsel, please return to state court and\nexhaust the issue.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but he couldn't find\nit inappropriate, could he? If you're again talking\nabout the plain language of the statute, I don't see\nthere's much room for the district judge to say: Well,\nnow, I'm not going to say that you have to participate\nin further state post-conviction proceedings, the\nunexhausted claim. It seems to me under your reading of\nthe statute the appointed counsel, say in an unexhausted\nclaim instance, would have to under the statute\nrepresent the defendant in further State collateral\npost-conviction proceedings.\nMS. CHAVIS: Well, Your Honor, again the key\nhere is that Congress used the word \"appropriate\" and\nthat's an easy legal standard for the federal judge to\ndetermine. The statute does not say State\npost-conviction process or State post-conviction case.\nIt indicates \"appropriate motions or procedures.\" So\nthat would be for the federal judge --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. I'm sure\nI'm missing something here, because the statute does say\n\"all available post-conviction process.\"\nMS. CHAVIS: Yes, Your Honor, and I submit\nthat that is a reference to, if we look at (a)(2), where\nit says, the very first line, \"post-conviction\nproceedings under 2254 and '55.\" So that describes all\navailable post-conviction process, describes the 2254 or\n2255 proceedings.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you're just\nsaying a new trial because you succeed on habeas is not\npost-conviction process?\nMS. CHAVIS: No, Your Honor, not by a plain\ndefinition of that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well then, if you\nlook up earlier in the statute, it says \"shall represent\nthe defendant throughout every subsequent stage of\navailable judicial proceeding.\"\nMS. CHAVIS: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why doesn't it fall\nunder that?\nMS. CHAVIS: Yes. Well, that's the key,\n\"subsequent stage.\" And a retrial would not be a\nsubsequent stage. That would be an entirely new case\nback in the state court.\nThere's also a second reason why federal\nhabeas counsel would not represent the defendant in many\nretrials or resentencings, and that would be --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why would it not be a\nsubsequent stage of available judicial proceedings?\nMS. CHAVIS: I'm sorry, Your Honor?\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why is it not a \"subsequent\nstage of available judicial proceeding\"?\nMS. CHAVIS: Well, under the structure of\nthe statute there's nothing subsequent --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Without using the word\n\"structure of the statute,\" because there I think you\nget into lots of trouble -- and you started out by\nsaying the plain language of (e) and I'm still\nstruggling to understand what you're doing with the\nplain language of (e).\nMS. CHAVIS: Okay. Well, there is another\nreason why federal habeas counsel would not do a State\nretrial, and that's because under (a)(2), the clause or\nthe part of the statute that does provide for the\nappointment of counsel, if there is already counsel\navailable then that appointment clause would not be\ntriggered.\nIf we look at (a)(2), which is on page 1a,\nthe trigger for the appointment of counsel is that we\nhave an indigent defendant. It says \"a defendant who\nis\" -- four lines down -- \"a defendant who is or becomes\nfinancially unable to obtain adequate representation\nshall be appointed a lawyer.\"\nIn a retrial, the State must provide trial\ncounsel --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no, no. That\ndoesn't work. The language you just quoted is simply to\nsay when you get somebody appointed.\nMS. CHAVIS: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You are financially\nunable so you get somebody appointed. Then you go back\nand say that person shall represent you through every\nsubsequent stage. It doesn't say that, oh, if you\nsuddenly get somebody else appointed, you know, then you\ncan -- then he doesn't have that obligation.\nMS. CHAVIS: Your Honor, I would submit that\nthese circumstances that trigger the appointment do\ncarry through the appointment process in that, if you\nlook at the language used by Congress, it says \"any\ndefendant who is or becomes financially unable.\" So\nCongress was --\nJUSTICE ALITO: What if the remand is for\nState post-conviction review, and there is no attorney\navailable under State law for State post-conviction\nreview?\nMS. CHAVIS: Yes, Your Honor, then we would\nbe looking again at the first clause of subsection (e),\nand we would be looking at the language used by Congress\n-- \"any appropriate motions and procedures.\"\nAnd again, appropriateness is an easy legal\nstandard applied by the courts. The federal judge\noverseeing the case could determine whether to --\nwhether returning for that State post-conviction process\nis appropriate. It would be just like a federal judge\ndetermining that in order to aid its decision-making\nprocess, it needs to certify a question back to the\nState courts.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. I have lost\nyou. Where is the \"appropriate\"? I don't see any\n\"appropriate.\"\nMS. CHAVIS: Your Honor, \"appropriate\" --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It says \"shall represent\nthe defendant throughout every subsequent\" -- every\nsubsequent stage of available judicial proceedings.\nMS. CHAVIS: Yes, and then it describes\nthose stages.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, right.\nMS. CHAVIS: And then we are at four lines\nup from the bottom.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMS. CHAVIS: I'm sorry. Five lines up from\nthe bottom.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it says \"and all\" --\nMS. CHAVIS: And other appropriate --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMS. CHAVIS: -- motions.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: \"Other appropriate,\" but as\nfar as what's covered by the first clause is concerned,\n\"appropriate\" doesn't apply to that.\nMS. CHAVIS: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: \"Represent throughout every\nsubsequent stage of available proceedings, including\npretrial, trial, sentencing, motions for a new trial,\nappeals, applications for writ of certiorari. There is\nno \"appropriate\" in any of that.\nMS. CHAVIS: Yes, sir. But, Your Honor,\nthat is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: \"And shall also represent\"\n-- and \"other appropriate motions and procedures,\" but\nthat doesn't cover the earlier stuff.\nMS. CHAVIS: Your Honor, if we were looking\nat the possibility of exhausting a claim in State court,\nthen we wouldn't be -- none of this first part of (e)\nwould apply. That wouldn't be a pretrial proceeding.\nThat wouldn't be a trial. That wouldn't be a\nsentencing. What that would come under would be after\n\"and all available post-conviction process,\" that would\nbe described as \"other appropriate motions and\nprocedures.\"\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So you would interpret\n\"all available post-conviction process\" as meaning\nfederal?\nMS. CHAVIS: The habeas proceeding. Yes,\nYour Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then why don't\nwe interpret the clemency provision the same way, as\nbeing limited to Federal?\nMS. CHAVIS: Well, because, Your Honor,\nCongress doesn't use the word \"Federal\" here, and if we\nwere to interpret it as --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But then the use of\n\"Federal\" -- we were just talking about.\nMS. CHAVIS: Well, that's correct, Your\nHonor; however, when we look at post-conviction process\nin (e), we have the context of (a)(2), that talks about\npost-conviction proceeding under section 2254 and 2255.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't know why you\njust didn't take the position and say, yes, it applies\nto all these provisions. That doesn't seem to me a --\nto doom your position at all. Once have you somebody\nappointed who helps you on the Federal habeas --\npresumably they do a lot of work, they get up to speed\non everything -- they ought to represent you through the\nnext stage of available proceedings.\nMS. CHAVIS: Well, Your Honor, and that's\ntrue. The interpretation of this first clause of\nsubsection (e) doesn't impact the second -- the\ninterpretation of the second clause, which says\nspecifically counsel shall represent the defendant in\nthose clemency proceedings that are available to him.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you see why --\nI mean, if you say, well, the first part is implicitly\nonly federal, that makes it very hard for you to argue\nthat the second part is not also implicitly only\nfederal.\nMS. CHAVIS: Respectfully, Your Honor, I\nwould disagree, and that's because the words are\ndifferent, used by Congress. Congress is very explicit\nin stating other clemency as may be available to the\ndefendant. There is no way that that could be\ninterpreted as federal clemency. There is no other\nfederal clemency --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I just want to make clear\nwhat your position is. Federal determination on habeas\ncorpus, that there are unexhausted claims, ordered to\nreturn to the State court: Is the appointed counsel\nrequired under the statute to represent the defendant in\nthe State court in further post-conviction proceedings?\nMS. CHAVIS: No, and for two reasons: One\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you have to take that\nposition? But that is your --\nMS. CHAVIS: Your Honor, I don't have to.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But that is your position?\nMS. CHAVIS: Your Honor, that is my\nposition. However, of course, again, the interpretation\nof this first part of this statute is separate from an\ninterpretation of the clemency clause, but for two\nreasons the answer would be no to that question, because\nthis statute -- number one, (e) does not specifically\nset that out as a subsequent stage of judicial\nproceedings, okay? What it does instead is it states\n\"appropriate motions or procedures.\" So it would be\ndiscretionary. On a case-by-case basis, the district\njudge could determine whether he believed it was\nappropriate, non-abusive, to return to State court to\nexhaust a claim.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but -- but, you know,\nit mentions trial proceedings, trial, motion for a new\ntrial, appeals, applications for writ of certiorari.\nAnd then, in the next clause it just says \"and all\navailable post-conviction process.\" Now, you would\nacknowledge that going back to exhaust claims that had\nnot been exhausted before the State courts would be\npost-conviction process or not?\nMS. CHAVIS: Not with respect to subsection\n(e). I mean, ordinarily an exhaustion proceeding is not\na subsequent stage. Ordinarily, if that is what this\nstatute contemplates, is the ordinary course --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: \"Subsequent stage\" does not\napply to this clause. I'm reading the clause \"and all\navailable post- conviction process.\"\nMS. CHAVIS: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nMS. CHAVIS: The very beginning of (w)\nindicates \"each attorney so appointed shall represent\nthe defendant throughout every subsequent stage of\navailable judicial proceedings including\" -- and then it\nrecites all of those stages.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But if it did not have the\nincluding phrase, if it just stopped there, would it\nthen include proceedings necessary to exhaust the State\nremedies? I'm a little unclear why you think it does\nnot include necessary proceedings -- proceedings\nnecessary to exhaust State remedies.\nMS. CHAVIS: I'm sorry, Your Honor, if I\nwasn't clear. It may include. It does not require. It\nmay include going back to State court to exhaust.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Why doesn't the word\n\"shall\" require it?\nMS. CHAVIS: Because, Your Honor, we're --\nwhen we're talking about an exhaustion proceeding or\nreturning to State court, it can only fit under this\npart of (e) that says that it would be an appropriate\nmotion or procedure. That's the only thing that you\ncould define a State proceeding under in this statute.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If you step back and\nlook at the structure, it seems to me unusual that your\ninterpretation would be correct. It seems to me that it\nwould be more likely that Congress wanted this counsel\nto continue on in State proceedings, trials.\nThe clemency thing seems a little bit more\nremoved. It's a different argument -- you know, we're\nguilty, but show us mercy -- than what may well be the\nsame sort of argument on the subsequent State proceeding\nas was raised in the Federal habeas. I mean, if I were\nwriting this, I would want them to continue in the\nsubsequent State proceedings before I would want them to\ncontinue -- before I would want to have them represent\nthe defendant in clemency.\nMS. CHAVIS: And I understand that, Your\nHonor, but I think also, if we look at the\nrepresentation as it does occur in the real world, we\nhave the AEDPA, we have this Court's decisions that\nstructure the -- the capital litigation so that State\ncourt exhaustion normally comes before the Federal\nhabeas process.\nBut, again, there are these two separate\nclauses. The first goes to judicial proceedings; the\nsecond clause goes to -- to nonjudicial proceedings,\nincluding competency, because the Court in Ford v.\nWainwright indicated that we need not have a judicial\nproceeding, a judicial determination of competency so\nCongress has separated out competency and separated out\nclemency, knowing that those are stages of a capital\ncase that come at the very end of Federal habeas, that\nthe Federal habeas counsel would be in the best position\nto represent that defendant at that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: This goes back to my\nearlier question: So what else fits under \"all\navailable post-conviction process\" other than competency\nand clemency? What else?\nMS. CHAVIS: Your Honor, competency and\nclemency are in their own \"shall\" clause, mandatory\nclause, in and of themselves. They are not included in\nthe -- the post-conviction process.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Right. But what would be\nincluded?\nMS. CHAVIS: The post-conviction process\nwould refer to anything in the 2254 to 2255. For\nexample, it could be the discovery motions; it could\nbe -- it could be notions in aid of an evidentiary\nhearing; it could be motions in aid of an appeal. So,\nthat's the descriptor.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But only things in Federal\ncourt?\nMS. CHAVIS: Your Honor, that is it my\nreading of \"all available post-conviction process,\" as\nreferring to the 2254, 2255.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Does that seem reasonable\nthat Congress would have -- suppose you had a real\ncomplicated case with five or six issues in it, and they\nfind out one issue is not exhausted. The capital case\nhas been around for two or three years. Does Congress\nthink, well, you've got to go on your own when you go\nback to the State court and try and exhaust that one\nclaim?\nMS. CHAVIS: No, Your Honor. I don't think\nCongress contemplated that, and that's why I think they\nincluded this language \"appropriate motions and\nprocedures,\" to encompass a return to State court where\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Now, where is that\nlanguage again, \"appropriate motions\" --\nMS. CHAVIS: It's four lines up -- five\nlines up from the bottom, the end of that line --\n\"appropriate\" --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, but that's in the next\nclause.\nMS. CHAVIS: That's in the first \"subsequent\nstage\" clause.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Why does that limit the\ninterpretation that -- of the words \"subsequent stage\"\n-- \"throughout every subsequent stage of available\njudicial proceedings\"? And doesn't the State collateral\nproceeding which is necessary to exhaust a remedy fall\nright within that language?\nMS. CHAVIS: Your Honor, it may.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What?\nMS. CHAVIS: It may. However, in our -- my\nreading of the statute, when we look at the subsequent\nstage, exhaustion ordinarily comes before Federal\nhabeas. It would be, you know, an unordinary situation\nwhere you would have to go back and exhaust. But I\nbelieve the statute contemplates that with \"appropriate\nmotions and procedures.\"\nBut of course, Congress could have\ncontemplated that the Federal lawyer continue to\nrepresent the defendant in exhaustion proceedings. Back\nwhen the statute was created, Congress was looking at\nthe States and looking at the fact that States were not\nproviding counsel for capital defendants in these cases.\nAnd Congress --\nJUSTICE ALITO: But I thought it was your\nposition that it didn't apply in that situation.\nMS. CHAVIS: I'm sorry, Your Honor?\nJUSTICE ALITO: I thought it was your\nposition that it did not apply in that situation.\nMS. CHAVIS: That it wasn't mandatory. It\ndoesn't require. As is appropriate --\nJUSTICE ALITO: So you think it's\ndiscretionary.\nMS. CHAVIS: Yes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: The court can -- as a matter\nof discretion, can order the counsel who is appointed to\nrepresent the Petitioner in the habeas to go back and\nhandle the exhaustion of a claim in State court\"?\nMS. CHAVIS: Absolutely, Your Honor, just\nlike this Court in Rhines v. Webber said it's\ndiscretionary as to whether this -- as to whether the\nFederal judge is going to determine that we are going to\nhold this case in abeyance, we are going to stay this\ncase while we -- while counsel goes back to exhaust some\nclaims.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Chavis, what do you do\nabout(a)(1)? That also is not limited by its terms --\nMS. CHAVIS: Correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- to federal prisoners.\nWould you argue that it says \"in every criminal action,\nwhich defendant is charged with a crime that is\npunishable by death.\"\nMS. CHAVIS: It does, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So even in the original\nState trial, he is entitled to a federal defendant; is\nthat right?\nMS. CHAVIS: No, Your Honor. For --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why not? It doesn't limit\nit to Federal trials.\nMS. CHAVIS: Well, Your Honor, in this case,\nin (a)(1), we would -- because (a)(1) sets out the\nfactors that trigger the appointment of counsel, we have\nto have a defendant who is charged with a capital crime,\nwho is indigent, and who otherwise doesn't have a\nlawyer.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right. It says he \"shall\nbe entitled to the appointment of one or more\nattorneys.\"\nMS. CHAVIS: That's correct, but, Your\nHonor, for a State capital trial, for a State capital\ndirect appeal, the States do provide counsel, and\nCongress would know that States have to provide counsel\nunder --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So what? I mean, it still\nis -- is unqualified.\nMS. CHAVIS: No.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And part of your argument,\nnot your only argument but a large part of your\nargument, is since it is unqualified in (E), the last\nclause, it has to include State. Well, you could say\nthe same about (a)(1).\nMS. CHAVIS: Your Honor, certainly last\nclause of (e) is unqualified and unambiguous; however,\n(a)(1) there is a qualifier in that it says \"unable to\nobtain adequate representation.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, but -- but --\nMS. CHAVIS: If the State provides\nrepresentation, then you don't have a federally\nappointed counsel.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So -- so if the State\ndoesn't provide counsel, the Federal Government will\nprovide it, and the States can recede from their\nobligation to provide counsel, right.\nMS. CHAVIS: Your Honor, I think this Court\nwould have problems under Gideon -- if the States cannot\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why? Why? So long as he\nhas counsel, we don't care who pays for it.\nMS. CHAVIS: Well --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It says \"adequate\nrepresentation.\" And then later on it says the lawyers\nwe appoint here has to have five years of experience,\nthree years experience in felony trials. I think that\nis a lot better than most of the attorneys who are going\nto be appointed under the State system. So I would say:\nLook, this statute itself recognizes that this person\nyou have appointed under the State system is not\nadequate. They say you have got to have five\nyears/three years, so I want one of those.\nMS. CHAVIS: Well, Your Honor, again, the\nanswer to that question under (a)(1) is that you would\nnot get federally appointed counsel when you have\ncounsel available to you otherwise. And that simply is\nthe fact, that the States do provide for counsel.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what about expert\nservices? I think most States don't provide for that.\nMS. CHAVIS: Well, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The Federal Government will\nprovide expert -- compensation for the use of experts\nwhen the States won't?\nMS. CHAVIS: That is -- that is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Under (a)(1)?\nMS. CHAVIS: That is part of (a)(1), and\nit's part of (a)(2). However, you still have to have --\nyou still have to have those -- those three\ncircumstances present.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Sure.\nMS. CHAVIS: And I believe that that -- that\nstill would not -- the States, if they provide any sort\nof resources at all, and if they provide a lawyer, then\ncertainly the trigger for appointment isn't -- isn't\navailable under (a)(1).\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It seems -- it seems to me,\ncounsel, that the mere fact that it doesn't mention\n\"federal\" explicitly is -- is not a very strong argument\nunless you are going to take the position that even\n(a)(1) applies to federal and state. And -- and really\nwhat you are -- the only strong strength to your bow is\nthat it says \"executive or other clemency.\" And -- and\nthere -- there seems to be no federal clemency except\nexecutive clemency, I guess. I guess.\nCan Congress declare something that has been\na crime no longer a crime and set the guy loose? I\ndon't know. Is that \"clemency\"?\nMS. CHAVIS: Your Honor, it's the\nConstitution that determines the -- the federal\nauthority for clemency. So Congress cannot effect that.\nThere is -- the -- only --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It says here the President\ncan. It doesn't say Congress can't. Does it say\nCongress can't?\nMS. CHAVIS: No, Your Honor, it does not say\nthat.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You put a lot of\nweight on -- I mean, the problem arises because Congress\ndid not specify whether it was limited to federal or\nstate. And yet you are saying they were -- what they\nclearly meant to do when they said \"executive or other\nclemency\" was to signal implicitly that it must cover\nstate because there is no other kind of clemency. It's\n-- it's kind of a real round-about way to make that\npoint, isn't it?\nMS. CHAVIS: Well, Your Honor --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Somebody's not going\nto sit there and say, oh, we put \"other\" in because we\nknow that in the federal system it's only executive, but\nin the State system there might be others.\nMS. CHAVIS: Your Honor --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That guy wouldn't\nsuddenly say, well, maybe we should say this is meant to\ncover the State system.\nMS. CHAVIS: Your Honor, these are the words\nthat Congress used. They know that the -- that the\nStates provide for forms of clemency other than\nexecutive clemency. We know that -- that Congress\nspecifically stated they wanted the defendant to be\nrepresented in that clemency proceeding that is\navailable to him. And in -- in these cases --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And we know that they read\nthis text carefully before they voted for it, right?\nMS. CHAVIS: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We don't know any of that.\nMS. CHAVIS: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: These are all assumptions.\nThat's all.\nMS. CHAVIS: The -- the language of the\nstatute is the best intent of Congress, yes, Your Honor.\nIf I have any time remaining, I would like\nto reserve it for rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Jay.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM M. JAY\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE,\nIN SUPPORT OF THE JUDGMENT BELOW\nMR. JAY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nSection 3599 authorizes federally funded\nrepresentation only in the three categories of\nproceedings specified in subsection (e). At least three\ndistinct aspects of the statute's text and structure\nshow that the only proceedings included are federal\nproceedings before a federal officer.\nFirst, as Justice Scalia pointed out during\nthe previous argument, the word \"federal\" does not\nappear anywhere in the statute, including in (a)(1).\nSeveral other terms in the statute, including the phrase\n\"every criminal proceeding,\" plainly refer to federal\nproceedings and federal proceedings only. Congress\nplainly saw no need to include the modifier \"federal\" to\nmake that limitation manifest.\nSecond, the statute requires that appointed\nattorneys have federal qualifications based on\nexperience practicing in federal court and it requires\nthat federal judges exercise significant oversight of\nthe attorney's representation. Both these federal\nrequirements for qualifications and federal requirements\nfor oversight make sense only if the proceedings that\nthe qualifications and oversight pertain to are federal\nones. Third, if Petitioner were right that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I just make sure I\nunderstand your position. Does (a)(2) authorize the --\nthe federal judge to appoint counsel for a -- a person\non death row under a state death conviction under 2254\nor 2255?\nMR. JAY: For that -- for that habeas -- for\nthat person's federal habeas petition --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMR. JAY: -- it requires the appointment of\n-- of a federal habeas attorney qualified to practice in\nfederal court.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So he is -- he is entitled\nto a lawyer in the -- in the federal collateral review\nof a State death penalty case?\nMR. JAY: In the federal review, that's\ncorrect.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And what in the statute\nlimits the scope of that review?\nMR. JAY: Well, subsection (e) limits the\nscope of that review, Justice Stevens. It specifies the\ntypes of proceedings that the attorney is -- is\npermitted to -- permitted and, indeed, required to --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But you agree that (e)\napplies to State prisoners?\nMR. JAY: We agree that (e) sets out the\nscope of services to be provided by the appointed\nattorney during the 2254 proceeding.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: In the -- for a State\nprisoner in a federal collateral proceeding?\nMR. JAY: We agree -- we agree with that,\nYour Honor, because we think that term \"proceeding\" --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What, then, in that\nproceeding does the word \"clemency\" refer to? Is that\nclemency by the President of the United States?\nMR. JAY: We think, Your Honor, that a -- a\nhabeas petitioner who is coming to federal court under\nsection 2254 has available to him no proceedings for\nclemency because the term \"proceedings\" --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Even though the statute\nsays so in so many words?\nMR. JAY: Well, it's -- I -- it's -- the\nmenu of services, if you will, set out in subsection (e)\napplies both to lawyers who are appointed under (a)(1)\nwho are doing work in federal court for federal\ndefendants facing a federal capital charge and also for\nattorneys appointed under (a)(2) who are representing\nhabeas petitioners under section 2254.\nBecause the term \"proceedings\" -- it is our\nposition -- each time it appears in subsection (e)\nrefers to federal proceedings before a federal officer,\na 2254 petitioner has available to him no proceedings\nfor executive or other clemency. That person can obtain\nthe services that are -- that are available to him under\nsubsection (e), which includes representation throughout\nthe 2254 proceedings.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Now, supposing on the eve\nof execution he wanted to apply for a stay of execution.\nHe'd be entitled to representation before a federal\njudge, right?\nMR. JAY: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But what if the federal\njudge says, you have to -- under our practice you can't\nget a federal stay without first exhausting your attempt\nto get a State stay. Could he represent the defendant\napplying for -- in the State court for a stay of\nexecution in that situation?\nMR. JAY: Subsection (e) would not authorize\nthat, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So he would have to get a\nseparate counsel to -- to go to the State court because\n-- even though the federal judge required him as a\nnormal matter of practice to exhaust the State remedy\nunder the very limited situation of a stay on the eve of\nexecution?\nMR. JAY: Well, Your Honor, State courts\nalso appoint counsel --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I understand that, but he\nwould have no right to have his federal lawyer get paid\nfor doing that work?\nMR. JAY: Would not get paid by the Federal\nGovernment for litigating a matter in State court that\nmay have no connection to federal law.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Just for this, for the\nstay application on the eve of execution?\nMR. JAY: Well, Your Honor, I -- it would\nnot be a federal judicial proceeding, and, therefore, it\nwould not be covered under subsection (a)(2).\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It comes in with the --\nthe general language \"other appropriate motions and\nprocedures,\" and so forth. That's got to be tailored\nback to mean other appropriate motions and procedures in\na federal tribunal?\nMR. JAY: We -- we think that the federal\nlimitation applies throughout the section --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You think that is\nperfectly clear from the text of the statute?\nMR. JAY: I am sorry, Justice Stevens?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think that is\nperfectly clear from the text of the statute?\nMR. JAY: Well, Your Honor, I think that the\nfederal limitation is apparent from a number of aspects\nof the statute, including the fact that Congress didn't\nuse the \"federal\" modifier anywhere else in the statute.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It could have used the\n\"federal\" modifier very easily just by inserting the\nword \"federal\" in places.\nMR. JAY: Well, if it had inserted the word\n\"federal\" in some places and left it out in others, that\nmight be probative intent -- probative evidence that\nCongress intended the -- the other instances to be\nfederal and State as well. But we don't have that here.\nWe have -- we have terms that are clearly indicated to\nbe federal only in nature such as every criminal\nproceeding in (a)(1).\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't doubt in\nthe scenario Justice Stevens hypothesized that the\nfederal defender would in fact represent the person\nbefore the State court. You are in an emergency stay\nsituation. He's -- he's allowed to go to federal court.\nHe does so. The federal judge says, you got to go back\nto State court. There's 12 hours left. He's not going\nto say, you know, get another lawyer. He's going to\nrepresent the person before the state court. And I\ngather he can do that; he's just not going to get paid\nfor that.\nMR. JAY: But the -- subsection (e) doesn't\nbar the lawyer from doing that. And two points on that:\nThere might be other sources of funding available; and\nindeed, the same lawyer who need not be a federal\ndefender -- he may be a panel attorney appointed -- who\nis in private practice appointed from the district\ncourt's panel of available attorneys who meet the\nfederal qualifications.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So he presumably --\nMR. JAY: He may be appointed as well.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So he presumably is\nspending a huge amount of time and resources on this --\nin the nature of these proceedings, and you want to go\nback and say, all right, on this day you spent six hours\nredoing your papers that were filed before the Federal\njudge to file them before the State judge, and you don't\nget paid the whatever -- how -- what do CJA attorneys\nget paid these days?\nMR. JAY: In capital cases for fiscal year\n2008 it's $170 an hour.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So he goes back and\nsays: Look, you don't get that; you know, you get the\n$15,000 you spent on the last ten days on this but you\ndon't get the $810. That -- does it seem reasonable to\nimpose that burden on the public defender?\nMR. JAY: Well, Your Honor --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Since you know as a\npractical matter, because of professional responsibility\nthat person is going to represent the defendant in the\nState court proceedings.\nMR. JAY: Well, Your Honor, the limitations\nin subsection (e) are there for a reason, and it's\nprecisely because the State -- the State post-conviction\nprocess that would become available under Petitioner's\nreading of the statute is certainly not limited to a few\nhours spent on the eve of execution in State court. It\npotentially could include returning to State court for\nany form of post-conviction process at any time after\nthe Federal habeas application is filed.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Would we have to reach that\nquestion here? I mean, I don't understand three things\nthat you've said. You said it says Federal; I don't see\nany place it says Federal. It doesn't use that word.\nThen you say it doesn't say Federal and State; in my\ncopy it does say Federal and State. It talks about 2254\nand 2255. So if I just read this in English, it says\nthat once you appoint the person, and it's either State\nor Federal, 2254 or 2255, that person shall also\nrepresent the defendant in such competency proceedings\nand proceedings for executive or other clemency as may\nbe available to the defendant. QED, end of the case.\nAll right, now why isn't it?\nMR. JAY: I think it isn't, Justice Breyer,\nbecause 2254 is not a reference to proceedings in State\ncourt. A 2254 proceeding is in Federal court, it\ninvolves Federal constitutional issues and a Federal\nconstitutional challenge to the legitimacy of the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's right. That's\nright, because they are referring to people who are\nunder State death penalty or Federal death penalty, and\nwhat it says is that they shall get a person to\nrepresent them in these later habeas proceedings. And\nthen it adds that that person -- and no point quoting it\nagain; you heard what I just said -- it adds that that\nperson will represent them in clemency proceedings.\nNow, is there any reason for thinking that\nCongress ---and contrary to some things mentioned, I\nbelieve that probably Congressman Conyers did read what\nhe wrote. He certainly referred to it enough in\nspeeches, and those speeches make very clear to me that\nthat is what he had in mind, what it says. Now other\npeople can read it differently, but I -- I mean, I've\nread it. I read the language. What's the answer?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought this was a\nFederal law. Is this a Conyers law; is that what it is\nhere?\nJUSTICE BREYER: He happens to be the person\nwho wrote it, and it's referred to in the Solicitor\nGeneral's brief, and on page 21, I took what you said, I\nwent back and looked it up, just as you might have\nsuggested I would by putting in the relevant citations,\nokay?\nSo having looked it up, as implicitly you\nsuggested, I think Conyers knew what he said. I think\nhe did mean those words to say what it says, but you can\nconvince me to the contrary. That's why I raised it.\nMR. JAY: Well, I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Did his colleagues know\nwhat he said?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, they did.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. Counsel,\nyou lead.\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We direct our\nquestions to counsel.\nJUSTICE BREYER: My experience in Congress\nis that the members of Congress do know the kinds of\nthings that they are voting on; maybe others have\ndifferent experience.\nMR. JAY: Well, Your Honor, let me answer\nyour point about Congressman Conyers first, because I\nthink that the suggestion in Petitioner's brief is that\nCongressman Conyers was -- had misinterpreted the text\nof his own amendment, and as we have shown, the text of\nthe amendment proposed by Congressman Conyers in the\nHouse and the text of the amendment proposed by Senator\nLevin in the Senate using the same -- using virtually\nthe identical language, each of them provided no funding\nfor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I think you are wrong about\nthat. The reason I think you are wrong about that is\nthat that language to which you refer is language that\nCongressman Conyers himself introduced in response to a\nbill by Representative Gekus, and in Representative\nGekus's bill he referred, just like this one, to both\nState defendants and to the Federal defendants. And the\npurpose of Conyers' amendment, which was to substitute\nfor the Gekus amendment, was to extend, not to limit,\nwhat Gekus has done. And he introduced lots of\ninformation, all of which referred almost uniquely to\nState defendants.\nThat's then picked up in the Senate, and the\nSenate, which is Levin, is trying to do precisely what\nConyers was trying to do in the House, which we know\nfrom the fact that he said it.\nNow, I can't find anything in that\nlegislative history that supports the statement that you\nmade on page 21 that this initially was meant to refer\nonly to people under Federal sentence of death.\nMR. JAY: Well, Your Honor, the text of\nCongressman Conyers' amendment wiped out the Gekus\namendment. It replaced subsections (q)(1) through\n(q)(4) of the Gekus amendment. Subsection (q)(4) is\nwhat you are referring to, referring to 2254\npetitioners. Congressman Conyers replaced that with a\nlengthy piece of legislation that is the predecessor of\nwhat appears in the statute today, and it made no\nprovision whatsoever for 2254 petitioners, even those\nappearing in Federal court.\nNow, your previous question to me, which I\ndidn't get -- which I would like to come back to, is\nabout the 2254 representation. When a State prisoner\ncomes to Federal court raising a constitutional\nchallenge to his conviction in a 2254 proceeding, there\nis a direct Federal interest and his Federal rights are\nat stake, and it makes sense that Congress was providing\ncounsel for the vindication of those Federal rights.\nThat is not so with the clemency proceedings before a\nState governor, which are a matter of grace, they don't\nturn on Federal issues, and they don't deal with an\ninmate under a Federal sentence of death.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What do you do with\n\"other\"? I mean, there is no \"other\" clemency for\nFederal defendants, right? It's just executive\nclemency?\nMR. JAY: We think, Your Honor, that the\npurpose of that phrase, which was added, as I tried to\nexplain in my previous answer, was added at a time when\nthere was no -- there was no funding available for a\n2254 petitioner. We think the purpose of that language\nis to be as capacious as possible when a Federal\ndefendant seeks clemency, and that the -- recognizing\nthat the proceedings for clemency in which counsel might\nbe helpful might include proceedings that don't take\nplace before the Chief Executive himself, and there are\na couple of examples.\nThroughout history presidents have enlisted\nthe assistance of various people, including individuals\nwho don't work for the Executive Branch.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I understand that, but it's\nstill executive clemency.\nMR. JAY: We agree, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: When a clemency decision is\nmade, it's not being made by these other people who are\nhelping out the president. It's being made by the\nexecutive.\nMR. JAY: We don't disagree with that at\nall, Justice Souter, but we think that the phrase \"or\nother\" was simply Congress' attempt to make sure that\nproceedings before these other officers --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Should the Constitution be\namended it would cover that, right?\nMR. JAY: Should the Constitution be amended\nto permit -- to permit legislative clemency, I think\nthat that -- I think that that is right. But at any\nrate, the phrase \"or other,\" we don't think that it's a\nsub silentio or at least a very subtle way of indicating\nState clemency, because as we pointed out in our brief,\nthe existence of non-executive clemency in the States\nis -- in every State that has the death penalty,\nclemency is a matter -- is a decision made by the\ngovernor or his appointees or other executive officials.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Jay, would you comment\non this general reaction I had when I read the statute?\nI had the impression that most lawyers appointed under\nthis statute would be to represent defendants in State\nexecution cases, and there are a few cases where there\nare Federal death penalty cases, but not very many\nacross the whole spectrum. Am I right about that?\nMR. JAY: In terms of the numbers of\nclients, yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But you're primarily\ndealing with the representation of State defendants in\ncapital proceedings, and the number of cases in Federal\nproceedings where at the last minute there is a plea for\nexecutive clemency is very rare. And you think this\nparticular provision we are debating here was really\nintended just to take care of the rare case where a\nFederal defendant is on death row seeking executive\nclemency, and not even to consider all the cases in\nwhich -- in State -- before -- that originate in State\ntrials, where there is a lot of applications for\nexecutive clemency. You think it was intended to focus\non that very narrow category?\nMR. JAY: Well, we think the entire statute\nis intended to focus on when Federal rights and Federal\ninterests are at stake in the administration of the\ndeath penalty. And in the clemency context, because\nclemency does not actually -- does not involve the\nvindication of a Federal right -- or a constitutional\nright at all, the number of instances where the clemency\nprocess actually involves such a Federal case is a\nlimited --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: There are occasionally\nFederal constitutional question and sometimes arguments\nmade in Federal clemency -- I mean, in State clemency\nproceedings and Federal clemency proceedings.\nMR. JAY: There are sometimes such arguments\nmade but there is no such thing as a Federal\nconstitutional right to clemency, and indeed the\ngovernor is --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But arguably there is\nFederal right or constitutional right to a fair\nproceeding in a clemency application?\nMR. JAY: Well, there is a -- in a capital\nclemency proceeding, the Court has recognized a limited\ndue process right, but that is not the sort of right\nthat would be vindicated in a habeas proceeding at all.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Jay, I assume that\n(a)(1), which provides for the appointment of counsel to\nconduct the trial in a capital case, would not have very\nmuch application either, would it?\nMR. JAY: That's right, Your Honor, (a)(1)\napplies only in federal proceedings.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Only in federal capital\ncases, of which there are very, very few.\nMR. JAY: That's correct, Your Honor. So\nmany of the -- many of the provisions -- even on\nPetitioner's reading, which places great reliance on the\nsubsequent stage language -- many of these provisions\nsuch as pretrial proceedings, trial sentencing, would\napply only to the limited number of federal death\npenalty defendants.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The government's principal\nconcern in this case is the possibility to potential,\nassuming the Petitioner prevails, of appointment of\ncounsel in State post conviction collateral proceedings,\ni.e., when there are unexhausted claims. Apparently the\nSixth Circuit in bank addressed this, and in your brief\nyou indicated there is a number of additional claims.\nIs that the principle thrust of your concern rather than\nclemency?\nMR. JAY: It is the principle thrust of our\nconcern, I think that's fair to say, Justice Kennedy.\nAnd that's because the word \"proceedings,\" which appears\nthree times in subsection E, we think that either that\nis limited to federal proceedings each time it appears\nor it's not each time it appears.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You think there is no way\nto interpret that the statute so that it could include\nstate clemency proceedings but only federal post\nconviction review proceedings in judicial -- before\njudicial tribunals?\nMR. JAY: We don't see a way to have a\nfederal limitation before judicial proceedings and not\nhave it before --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Surely, you could. You\ncould put all I don't remember weight on the other\nexecutive or other -- and you could say that's the only\nprovision where it's apparently clear from the text that\nState proceedings were included.\nAssuming you are wrong, that there are\nnon-executive State clemency proceedings, you are sure\nthat there aren't?\nMR. JAY: Well, our position, Your Honor, is\nthat in every State with the death penalty, the clemency\ndecision is made either by -- in most cases, by the\ngovernor or gubernatorial appointees or by other\nexecutive officials. And the Petitioner has suggested\nthat gubernatorial appointees for that purpose might be\n\"other.\" But, there is -- there are no -- we have been\nable to find no instances of, for example, legislative\nclemency in the capital case. That is limited.\nThe constitutional provisions that the Tenth\nCircuit relied on that there is such an institution of\nlegislative clemency, that's limited to treason against\nthe State, a noncapital felony or mostly noncapital\nfelony that we can't find a treason against the State\nprosecution since the 1940's.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Of course, it would have\nmade sense for Congress to use to other -- as a way of\nreferring to the states simply because it would have\nbeen a matter of indifference to Congress whether a\nState process was executive or was other in some way, in\neffect, just leaving the issue open as an irrelevance.\nMR. JAY: I think if your premise,\nJustice Souter, were right, that Congress intended to\nfund proceedings on both levels, then I suspect that\nthat is right, that it would be a matter of indifference\nto Congress which form the State clemency process took.\nBut we think that Congress intended to fund only those\nproceedings in which there are federal rights or federal\ninterests at stake, and State clemency proceedings do\nnot meet that qualification.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That still leaves you with\nthe question that the -- what the words \"or other\" can\npossibly refer to, given the present state of federal\nlaw and federal constitutional law, unless they refer to\nState proceedings.\nMR. JAY: Well, the phrase is -- the phrase\nis ambiguous. We turn to legislative history to\npartially resolve that ambiguity, because as we have set\nout in our brief and I alluded to earlier, they were\nadded -- they were added at a time when funding wasn't\ncontemplated for 2254 proceedings at all.\nEven if that -- even if that weren't the\ncase, we would think that because of the impact on the\nfederal-State balance that would result from funding the\nState proceedings, that that's not the kind of clear\nstatement that would qualify. So I mentioned before,\none of the two possibilities that we see for what \"or\nother\" might mean --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me, what do you mean\nby the federal-State balance? Because this is funding\nsomebody to argue against the interests of the State,\nisn't it?\nMR. JAY: It is, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, assuming the state\nhas convicted somebody, you are arguing against the\nState.\nMR. JAY: That's true, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And the federal government\nis funding that.\nMR. JAY: The federal government would be\nfunding that.\nWe see another instance in which there is an\nimpact on the federal-State balance, which is the fact\nthat if, on Petitioner's reading, the attorney must\nreturn -- must go to State court or go into State\nproceedings and continue the representation there, they\nstill answer to the federal judge who supervises their\nappointment, supervises their qualifications, and\ndetermines whether and to what extent they will be paid.\nAnd of critical importance, the federal judge determines\nwhen the attorney will be permitted to withdraw. And\nthe federal judge may not permit such a withdrawal,\nunless and until the federal judge can find another\nattorney who meets the same qualifications for a federal\nappointment.\nSo you would have, on Petitioner's reading,\nan attorney appointed by federal court who would go into\nState judicial proceedings and would be unable to ask\nthe State tribunal before whom he or she was appearing\nfor permission to withdraw from the engagement. He or\nshe would have to return to the federal court for that\npermission. We see that as a direct -- direct\ninfringement on the State tribunal process.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I just be clear on one\nthing on your position, Mr. Jay? Is it your view that\nthe federal judge may not allow the lawyer to do\nanything in an unexhausted claim, or does he have some\ndiscretion?\nMR. JAY: Well, I think -- this statute,\nYour Honor, doesn't deal with discretion. It deals with\nshall. And -- so we don't think it is possible under\nthis statute. It is possible.\nNow, there is another provision in federal\ncourt to the appointment of counsel, the Criminal\nJustice Act 18 U.S.C. 3006 capital A, which was in\nexistence long before this statute, used to permit\ndiscretionary appointment of counsel in 2254 cases. It\ndoes contain a provision for some ancillary\nrepresentation. It is possible that an attorney might\nbe able to invoke that provision which has its own\nlegislative --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What is the government's\nposition on that issue?\nMR. JAY: I don't -- I don't think we have\na -- have a position on that issue, because it --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me that issue\nwould arise more often than the issue we are fighting\nabout in this case.\nMR. JAY: It -- it might, Your Honor,\nbecause the Criminal Justice Act applies to noncapital\ncases as well. But I have not seen it litigated. And\nso, I don't think we have taken a position on it. But\nthat is -- that is a potential source for discretionary\nfunding.\nBut the suggestion that subsection E permits\nsome exercise of discretion because of the inclusion of\n\"and other appropriate motions and procedures,\" I don't\nthink that works in this case to cabin the necessary\nimplications of Petitioner's reading, because the three\ncategories of proceedings are judicial proceedings,\ncompetency proceedings and proceedings for executive or\nother clemency, and each of the examples from pretrial\nproceedings down through applications for stays of\nexecution and other appropriate motions and procedures\nfall into the category of judicial proceedings.\nIt is our position that those are to be\nfederal proceedings, not proceedings in State court.\nAnything that is on that list, from -- again from\npretrial proceedings down through -- at least to all\navailable post conviction process, that is not\ndiscretionary, and we don't think that the district\ncourt could decide that even though something were\navailable post conviction process, it was not to be\nfunded because the district court deemed it not to be\nappropriate.\nAnd many of the filings that a habeas\ncounsel might wish to make in State court, if the\nPetitioner's reading were adopted, would fall under the\ncategory of available post conviction process, a\nsuccessive writ of habeas corpus or a writ of coram\nnobis, such as the one that Petitioner litigated in the\nTennessee Court of Criminal Appeals while its federal\nhabeas proceedings was pending.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But all this is dependent\nupon the defendant is showing that he is financially\nunable to obtained adequate representation. And if he\nis in the State court, then that's the answer to it.\nIt's the only when he isn't. And I thought in the\nclemency cases, particularly, there was no funds in\nState court.\nMR. JAY: There are some funds on the State\nlevel, and I would like to come back to how Tennessee\nhandles that in a moment. But as a general answer to\nyour question, the statute does not make clear that if\nPetitioner can obtain counsel at no cost to himself,\nthat he is no longer eligible for federal counsel under\nthis provision, because he, after all, would still be\nindigent. And I think the situation that occurred here\nin the Tennessee courts highlights the difficulty that\nwould be raised by creating a -- by permitting funding\nfor State proceedings.\nThe Tennessee post conviction defender is\nauthorized by statute to represent inmates under a\nsentence of death in post conviction and clemency\nproceedings in State court, and he has discretion over\nthe clemency portion.\nThe post conviction defender in this case\ndeclined to use his -- to use his resources to represent\nPetitioner in the clemency proceedings, because he\ndetermined that he didn't have the resources and he was\nfocusing on other cases. So, there -- at least as a\nmatter of Tennessee law that that option was available\nto him but it's not been suggested that he was not\nhimself financially unable to obtain counsel.\nSo, in any instance like that in which there\nis -- there are, in some circumstances, State-funded\ncounsel available, I think he would set up -- you would\ncreate a powerful incentive for the State to say it\nwishes to go second that allow federal -- allow federal\nfunding to come first and state funding to come second,\nand for the federal government to respond in like\nmeasure.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that's the government's\nposition, under this provision, even if -- even if State\nfunding -- well, as you say State isn't covered anyway.\nMR. JAY: Right. Our position,\nJustice Scalia, is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Assuming State funding is\ncovered, assuming representation in the State is\ncovered, it does seem to be the case that the test of\nwhether you get some Federal lawyer appointed is not\nwhether you don't have a State lawyer, but rather\nwhether you can pay for counsel, right?\nMR. JAY: Whether you as a personal\nmatter --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can pay.\nMR. JAY: -- are financially unable.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's strange.\nMR. JAY: And the ultimate test for\nappointment is also based on when the defend -- at the\ntime the defendant is or becomes financially unable,\nthere is no reference in the statute to when -- to the\ndefendant becoming financially able again. It has been\ninterpreted in some instances to permit revisiting that\nfinancial ability decision, but in circumstances unlike\nwhat we are discussing here, where the State provides\nfree counsel.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, you don't\nreally think the fact that this provision was recodified\nhelps your argument at all, do you?\nMR. JAY: Well, it doesn't hurt, Your Honor,\nand we do think that it helps because --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When I see that\nargument, particularly in a gray brief, that strikes me\nas tantamount to a confession of error.\nMR. JAY: Well, I am certainly not here to\nconfess to error, Your Honor. We do think that it helps\nour argument because to the extent that there is any\nambiguity or there is any doubt left in the Court's\nmind, I think the fact that Congress chose to use the\nsame words again --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You were earlier\nresisting the notion that the particular legislative\nhistory here showed anything because of how broadly it\nmay have been familiar, but there is no evidence at all\nthat when Congress recodified this language it was in\nfact aware of the different court of appeals decisions\nyou cite, right?\nMR. JAY: Other than the general presumption\nthat this Court apply ins these ratification cases,\nthat's right, Your Honor; we can't -- we can't point to\nany particular report or colloquy. The term proceeding\nhas to be given a consistent construction across section\n3599(e). Clemency proceedings, judicial proceedings and\nclemency proceedings, we submit, are made clear by the\ntext and structure of the statute to refer only to\nFederal proceedings. Adopting Petitioner's reading,\neven if -- even though in this case it refers only to a\nclemency proceeding, would inevitably lead to Federal\nfunding for any proceeding on the State level that meets\none of the descriptions set out in subsection (e).\nClemency would be a particularly poor candidate for such\nfunding because a clemency decision before a State\ngovernor, which may indeed be initiated before the --\nbefore the inmate comes to Federal court for habeas\npetition, implicates no Federal rights and implicates\nindicates no Federal interests. For those reasons we\nsubmit judgment of the Court of Appeals should be\naffirmed. Thank you all.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Jay.\nMS. CHAVIS, you have a minute left.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DANA C. HANSEN CHAVIS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. CHAVIS: Thank you, Your Honor.\nThe word proceedings in subsection (e) is\ngiven meaning by Congress by the words that Congress\nused, and when it says proceedings for clemency, it\nmeans proceedings for that clemency that is available to\nthe defendant. Subsection (a)(2) put 2254 defendants\nand 2255 defendants on the same footing, and if we don't\ngive affect to the \"or other\" language or the available\nlanguage in the clemency clause, then we are rendering\nthose words meaningless. We're -- and we are saying\nthat Congress somehow sub silentio read out 2454\ndefendants from the clemency clause.\nIn addition, Your Honor, I just would like\nto point out that giving a lawyer for an -- giving an\nattorney for a person on death row to present a case for\nclemency before the clemency decisionmaker is not an\nintrusion on the States. If it were we would see the\nStates lined up here in opposition to our interpretation\nof the case, and they have not done that. In particular\nin this case, the State of Tennessee takes no position,\nand at least four other times this statute has been\nlitigated, other death penalty States have taken no\nposition. So there simply is no intrusion in providing\na person a lawyer, and we have heard from 11 governors\nrepresenting seven other death penalty States that say\nit's very important for them to be fully informed when\nthey make this life or death decision when they are\npresented with these capital clemency petitions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How often has\nclemency been granted in Tennessee?\nMS. CHAVIS: Your Honor, clemency has been\ngranted one time since Furman, that I am aware of, Your\nHonor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One time in the last\nhow many decades?\nMS. CHAVIS: That would be the last 20 or\n30, Your Honor. We just recently started having\nexecutions.\nIf I -- if I might may just add one other\nfactor. Clemency was granted four times in 2008\nthroughout the country.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
