WALTERS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. WALTERS: Mr. Chief Justice and may it\nplease the Court:\nPatent exhaustion provides that once a\npatented article is sold, it passes outside the\nprotection of the Patent Act. It is available to be\nused by the purchaser to practice the invention.\nNow, what's the invention here? The\ninvention is a bit of DNA that, when asserted into a soy\nbean seed, makes that seed and all the plants that grow\nfrom that seed resistant to the active ingredient in\nRoundup. Now, the only way to practice that invention\nis to plant the seed and to grow more seeds.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why in the world\nwould anybody spend any money to try to improve the seed\nif as soon as they sold the first one anybody could grow\nmore and have as many of those seeds as they want?\nMR. WALTERS: I agree no one would do that,\nand I don't think that is the situation here. I think\nwe have, and we have explained how Respondents here can\nprotect their invention through contracts. They don't\nhave to sell it outright. They can sell it through an\nagency model, but I think the more important --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's true, that's\ntrue in the case of any patented article, right?\nMR. WALTERS: Correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the patent system\nis based, I think, on the recognition that contractual\nprotection is inadequate to encourage invention.\nMR. WALTERS: Well, part of the patent\npolicy, as well, is to protect the purchaser, and that's\nbeen part of this Court's law for more than 150 years.\nUnder Respondent's theory, any farmer who\ngrows a soy bean seed is infringing the patent, but for\nthe grace of Monsanto. And that's -- a lot of farmers\nin this country, when we have over 90 percent of the\nacreage that is Roundup Ready. So under Monsanto's\ntheory, there is really no limit by the Exhaustion\nDoctrine?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't understand that\nlast sentence. Any farmer who plants and grows soybeans\nis violating the patent?\nMR. WALTERS: Is infringing under license by\nMonsanto. Let's take the first --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought that their claim\nis he only violates the patent if he tries to grow\nadditional seeds from his first crop. Right? Isn't\nthat the only claim here?\nMR. WALTERS: The reach of Monsanto's theory\nis that once that seed is sold, even though title has\npassed to the farmer, and the farmer assumes all risks\nassociated with farming, that they can still control the\nownership of that seed, control how that seed is used.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, not that seed. It's\ndifferent seed. That seed is done. It's been planted\nin the ground and has grown other seed. It's the other\nseed we are talking about. It's not the very seed that\nwas sold. Right?\nMR. WALTERS: That's correct, Your Honor,\nbut if we don't apply -- if exhaustion is eliminated,\nrather, for the progeny seed, then you are taking away\nthe ability of people to exchange these goods freely in\ncommerce. You have essentially a servitude on these\nthings that are exchanged, and every grain elevator who\nmakes a sale is infringing.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I think you may be\nright in the way you characterize Monsanto's argument,\nand I have great difficulties with characterizing it\nthat way, as Justice Scalia's question indicates. But\nMonsanto can still prevail if you say that there's a\npatent infringement, if he plants it for seed and uses\nthe seed to replant. That's not as far as Monsanto\ngoes, but it seems to me it's one way to characterize\ntheir argument and to make it sensible.\nMR. WALTERS: If you assume that there is\nexhaustion in the seeds that are sold to the farmer --\nlet's take our particular case here. Mr. Bowman went to\na grain elevator and he bought from the grain elevator\nwithout restriction seeds to -- with his purpose to\nplant them. Now, the only way that he can make use --\nif you assume in the first instance that there is\nexhaustion to the seeds that Mr. Bowman purchased from\nthe grain elevator, you are taking away any ability for\nhim to use that seed or use the invention.\nLet's take for example Claim 130, which is\nat supplemental appendix 19, that is a method for\nselectively controlling weeds in a field. It has two\nelements; the first element is planting the crop seed\nand it's a particular crop seed with all the particular\ngenetics that encode for resistance to Roundup, and then\nthe next step is to apply to the crop and weeds in the\nfield a sufficient amount of glyphosate herbicide.\nNow, if you say that there is exhaustion in\nthe seeds that Mr. Bowman purchased from the grain\nelevator, but you say it doesn't apply to the progeny,\nyou are not allowing him to actually practice the\ninvention to grow more seeds.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, but you are allowing\nhim to use those seeds for anything else he wants to do.\nIt has nothing to do with those seeds.\nThere are three generations of seeds. Maybe\nthree generations of seeds is enough.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: It is for this example.\nFirst of you have the Monsanto, the first generation\nthey sold. They have children, which is the second\ngeneration. And those children have children, which is\nthe third generation, okay? So bad joke.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: So we are talking here --\nhe can do what he wants with the first generation.\nAnything he wants. And moreover, when he buys them from\nMonsanto, he can make new seeds. He can make generation\n2 because they've licensed him to do it.\nHere, he buys generation 2. Now, he can do\nwhat he wants with those seeds. But I'll tell you,\nthere is a problem because the coming about of the third\ngeneration is itself the infringement. So the second\ngeneration seeds have nothing to do with it. If he went\ninto a room and had a box that he bought from a lab and\nhe put rocks in it and he said, hocus-pocus and lo and\nbehold out came the third generation of seeds, he would\nhave infringed Monsanto's patent with that third\ngeneration, would he not?\nMR. WALTERS: No.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, he wouldn't have? You\nmean if he goes and finds a new way of making these\nseeds, which happens to be you pick some grass and you\nintertwine it and various things like that, and lo and\nbehold you have a perfect copy of Monsanto's patented\nseed, he hasn't made it, he hasn't infringed? Why not?\nMR. WALTERS: Well, I guess I misunderstood\nyour question.\nJUSTICE BREYER: My question is the same\nwith the grass as with the magic box. I am saying the\nproblem for you here, I think, is that, infringement\nlies in the fact that he made generation three. It has\nnothing to do with generation 2. That has just a\ncoincidence. But that is, in fact, the way he made\nthese seeds. But he can sell, resell generation 2, he\ncan do whatever he wants with it.\nIf he sterilizes it and uses them in a\ncircus, he can do it. The only thing he cannot do is he\ncannot create generation 3, just as he couldn't use\ngeneration 2 seeds to rob a bank.\nYou know, there are certain things that the\nlaw prohibits. What it prohibits here is making a copy\nof the patented invention. And that is what he did. So\nit's generation 3 that concerns us. And that's the end\nof it.\nNow, what is your response to that?\nMR. WALTERS: Justice Breyer, my response\nis, if you applied the law that way to side making over\nuse, you are eliminating the Exhaustion Doctrine in the\ncontext of -- of patented seeds. You're saying that he\ncan do --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But why --\nMR. WALTERS: -- anything but practice the\ninvention.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But why -- you said\nmaking or use and it isn't an either-or thing then -- as\nthe other side has pointed out. You can use the seed to\nmake new seeds. So use and make aren't -- it's not\neither you use it or you make it. You can use it to\nmake a new item.\nMR. WALTERS: Justice Ginsburg, that is the\npoint of the invention here. If you look at claim 130\nagain, for example, you are saying he can't practice\nclaim 130, which is certainly embodied in the seeds he\npurchased from the grain elevator.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, suppose he -- he\nhad never bought any Monsanto seeds. He just goes to\nthe grain elevator and 90-odd percent of those seeds\nhave the genetic composition. So -- and he planted that\nand he harvested it. Would he be infringing on\nMonsanto's patents?\nMR. WALTERS: No.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So he never has to buy\nany seed, at all, from Monsanto.\nMR. WALTERS: Well, in practical matters it\ndoesn't work that way because the seed that's available\nat a grain elevator is not a very good source of seed\nand farmers are not going to be able to eliminate the\nneed to go to Monsanto or the other seed companies every\nyear by going to the grain elevator.\nGreat evidence of that is the fact that my\nclient, every year that he planted a second crop using\nthe grain elevator seed, he bought high quality seed\nfrom Pioneer. Now, if this grain elevator -- grain\nelevator seed was so good, why didn't he use it for his\nfirst crop?\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm still not getting the\nanswer. I'm going to try once more. Now, when you buy\ngeneration 2, well, there are a lot of things you can do\nwith it. You can feed it to animals, you can feed it to\nyour family, make tofu turkeys. I mean, you know, there\nare a lot of things you can do with it, all right.\nBut I'll give you two that you can't do.\nOne, you can't pick up those seeds that you've just\nbought and throw them in a child's face. You can't do\nthat because there's a law that says you can't do it.\nNow, there's another law that says you\ncannot make copies of a patented invention. And that\nlaw you have violated when you use it to make generation\n3, just as you have violated the law against assault\nwere you to use it to commit an assault.\nNow, I think that's what the Federal Circuit\nis trying to get at. And so it really has nothing to do\nwith the Exhaustion Doctrine. It has to do with some\nother doctrine, perhaps, that -- that somehow you think\nshould give you the right to use something that has as a\nbasic purpose making a copy of itself. Maybe you\nshould, but I don't see that. Where is that in the law?\nMR. WALTERS: Your Honor, that's an\nexception to the Exhaustion Doctrine for\nself-replicating inventions.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. WALTERS: The invention here is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is that there? Is that --\nis that there in the Exhaustion Doctrine?\nMR. WALTERS: It is not there. This -- this\nCourt has -- has not created an exception to the\nExhaustion Doctrine, and in fact it's explicitly said it\nwon't do that and that's an act -- and that's an\nactivity for Congress.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. The\nExhaustion Doctrine permits you to use the good that you\nbuy. It never permits you to make another item from\nthat item you bought. So that's what I think\nJustice Breyer is saying, which is you can use the seed,\nyou can plant it, but what you can't do is use its\nprogeny unless you are licensed to because its progeny\nis a new item.\nMR. WALTERS: This is obviously a brand-new\ncase where we're dealing with the -- the doctrine of\npatent exhaustion in the context of self-replicating\ntechnologies. So what you have here is if you take the\nFederal Circuit's view, then you have no ability -- you\nhave no exhaustion at all for someone to practice the\ninvention. Sure, you can do all the things that you\ntalked about, Mr. Breyer -- or Justice Breyer, but that\nhas nothing to do with the -- or with the invention.\nSo you're taking the Exhaustion Doctrine for\nself-replicating inventions, you're modifying this\nCourt's case law substantially, and that's something\nthat ought to be done in Congress. In fact --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, you just said\nthat -- that we haven't had a case involving\nself-replicating. I mean, the Exhaustion Doctrine was\nshaped with the idea of an article; there was an article\nthat you could use and then you use it and it's used up.\nBut we haven't applied the Exhaustion Doctrine when you\nhave a new -- when you create a copy of the original.\nSo it's -- it's not that we have law in\nplace. We've been dealing with an item with the\nExhaustion Doctrine and now we have hundreds of items,\nthousands of items, all growing from that original seed.\nMR. WALTERS: The Exhaustion Doctrine, the\npolicy that underlies this Court's cases is -- is\nfundamentally a choice about the purchaser's rights in\nthat personal property over the patentee's rights in the\nmonopoly to use that monopoly and increase its sales.\nThis Court has always chosen the purchaser's rights over\nthe patentee's rights to increase sales. And we're just\nasking you to make the same choice here.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, except to the extent,\nas Justice Breyer suggested, except to the extent that\nthe purchase is going to use the article just to create\na new one of the exact same kind. And it seems to me\nthat what you're suggesting is that the basic rule that\nsays that the purchaser does not get to do that should\nhave an exception for self-replicating technologies.\nMR. WALTERS: First, we disagree that the\nactivity of basic farming could be considered making the\ninvention. If you read the statute, it says making the\ninvention, not just making a copy like it would be in\nthe Copyright Act. We have the invention, which is a\nparticular genetic sequence that was made, principally,\nby Monsanto's genetic engineers. And farmers, when they\nplant seeds, they don't exercise any control or dominion\nover -- over their crop. Otherwise, every year they'd\nhave a bumper crop.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you mean they don't\ndo any work, they don't lay the soil and the nutrients\nit needs, water when it needs watering, protect it from\nanimals? They do no work --\nMR. WALTERS: They absolutely --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- in growing the seed?\nMR. WALTERS: They absolutely do work, but\nthey don't have control over the creative process. They\nplant, they spray and they pray.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sure if they don't\ndo all of the things I said, it doesn't grow. So aren't\nthey involved in its creative -- in its creation?\nMR. WALTERS: They certainly aren't in\ncontrol of it. You ask any farmer who's lived through a\ndrought or through a terrible flood and they will say\nthey're not the ones who are making these --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you only need\none -- I mean, you throw the seeds on the ground, one or\ntwo of them are going to grow and you still have the\nsame case, right?\nMR. WALTERS: Absolutely. And -- and that's\nhow broad this position is. It doesn't matter how you\ncome into possession with these seeds. You are\ncommitting patent infringement if you -- any cell\ndivision is patent infringement.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's true, but that's\nwhat I thought you were going to respond. I thought you\nwere going to respond to me that my question then makes\nit infringement when your client buys generation 1 from\nMonsanto because they buy generation 1 from Monsanto,\nthey plant it in the ground and lo and behold up comes\ngeneration 2. And generation 2, on the basis of what I\nwas asking you, is just as much a violation.\nBut I think, though I'll find out from them,\nthat the response of that is, yes, you're right, it is\njust as much a violation. That's why we, Monsanto, give\nthe buyer a license to do it.\nAnd so it all seems to work out. You don't\nneed any exception. There's no exception from anything.\nWhen you create a new generation, you have made a\npatented item, which you cannot do without the approval\nof the patent owner. Therefore, Monsanto gives that\napproval when you buy generation 1.\nNow, it seems to me all to work out without\nany need for exception. And I'm putting to you my whole\nthought so that you can respond to it.\nMR. WALTERS: Thank you, Justice Breyer.\nWhat Monsanto wants to do in your scenario is they want\nthe farmer to assume all the risks of farming. They\nwant -- but they still want to control and act as owners\nof the property that is owned, no doubt, by that farmer.\nWhen that farmer grows the progeny seed, they insure the\nrisk that they're not going to have a crop in the first\nplace. If they drive to the grain dealer to sell their\nharvest -- they get one paycheck a year, by the way --\nthey, if they get into a wreck, that's not Monsanto's\nproblem; that's the farmer's problem.\nSo what they're essentially asking for is\nfor the farmers to bear all the risks of farming, yet\nthey can sit back and control how that property is used.\nAnd that's fundamentally inconsistent with how this\nCourt has interpreted the Exhaustion Doctrine. The\nthing that's very important is this is not a license,\nthis is an outright sale to the farmers of the first\ngeneration.\nAnd then they are -- they plant those seeds\nbecause they have, under the Exhaustion Doctrine, a\nright to use the invention, and then those progeny seeds\nare owned outright by every farmer, and they assume all\nrisk of loss. So if -- if -- Monsanto wants to\ncontrol --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And they may -- they may\nthey own them, but that doesn't mean that they are\ninfringing. They may -- the seeds are owned by the\nfarmer. But when he uses them to grow more seeds, he's\ninfringing on that patent. So I don't think that the\nownership has anything to do with it.\nMR. WALTERS: It's the servitude on the\ntitle. And those things get sold to the grain\nelevators, and now every time the grain elevator makes a\nsale, it's technically infringing. And -- and that's\nsomething that our law has never allowed for centuries.\nAnd one of the main problems is that you have farmers,\ntheir main livelihood here is to sell the seeds that\nthey grow. Now, if they don't have clear title and if\nthey don't have the ability to sell the property that\nthey -- that they grow, then that impinges upon their\nability to make a living.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I have only one question\nso far, and it's a farming question. With some crops if\nyou are going to make seeds, you leave the crop in\nlonger. In -- what about soybeans? If the farmer has\nthe north 40 and the south 40, the north 40, he's going\nto plants soybeans to be used for flour, human\nconsumption, and south 40, he wants seeds. Does he\nleave the plants in the ground the same amount of time?\nMR. WALTERS: You know, most farmers are not\ngrowing soybeans for -- for seed. There are various\ntypes of --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You would not? Okay.\nMR. WALTERS: -- various types of farmers\nwho are -- who are growing foundation seed, for example,\nthat is very close to the -- to the first generation\nseed that's engineered.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand this. I\nthought soybeans are seeds.\nMR. WALTERS: They are.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's -- if you're\ngoing to use the soybeans for seeds as opposed to flour,\ndo you leave them in the ground any longer?\nMR. WALTERS: I don't know the answer to\nthat question.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Okay.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Walters, can you go back\nto the Chief Justice's opening question because the\nChief Justice asked you what incentive Monsanto would\nhave to produce this kind of product if you were right.\nAnd you said, well, they can protect themselves by\ncontract.\nActually, it seems to me that that answer is\npeculiarly insufficient in this kind of a case because\nall that has to happen is that one seed escapes the web\nof these contracts, and that seed because it can\nself-replicate in the way that it can, essentially makes\nall the contracts worthless. So again, we are back to\nthe Chief Justice's problem, that Monsanto would have no\nincentive to create a product like this one.\nMR. WALTERS: Taking our example here\nwhere -- where Petitioner bought commodity seeds, it's\nan undifferentiated mixture, it can't be overemphasized\nhow different every single seed is, you don't know a\nMonsanto from a Pioneer from an Asgrow. You don't know\nthe maturity rate. If I am a farmer, I need a\nparticular maturity bean for my field because I don't\nwant it to mature before it gets high enough for the\ncombine to come around and cut it.\nSo you want to be able to have -- you have\nall these things dialed in, these different\nvariabilities. So if you go to the grain elevator and\nyou don't know what exactly it is that you want and you\njust get a mixture, that's not going to be real --\ncompetitive at all to Monsanto's first generation seed.\nNow, the possibility of somebody selecting\none and saying, ah, that's the exact one that I need for\nmy field, I'm going to cultivate that and let it grow\ninto enough seeds so I can plant my first crop, that\nwould take a number of years to grow a 1,000-acre farm,\nand it's not -- and by that time, farmers -- the nature\nwould have changed and evolved where you would want the\nlatest disease resistance by that point.\nSo there are --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Please correct me if I am\nwrong. I thought that's exactly what Bowman did here.\nHe went to a grain elevator and he -- he used the seeds,\nand -- and he didn't know exactly the percentage mix,\nbut he used them.\nMR. WALTERS: Well, he --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So he did exactly what you\nsaid is uneconomical.\nMR. WALTERS: No. Actually, he did\nsomething quite different. He didn't select a\nparticular variety. He selected for the particular\ntrait, Roundup Ready, but there are probably more than a\ndozen different ways in which the seed can vary --\ndisease resistance, maturity rates. And if you are a\nfarm --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry, maybe I\ndidn't read this right. I thought what he did was plant\nall the commodity seeds, and then applied the Roundup,\nso that all that was left was the Roundup\nReady-resistance seeds, and then he used those.\nMR. WALTERS: That's correct. But if you\nlook at a field that you've planted with grain elevator\nseed, it's going to be all different colors because\nthey're going to be all different varieties, they're all\ngoing to mature at a different rate. So that if -- when\nit comes harvest time, some of them are going to be too\nclose to the ground so that your combine's going to\nmiss --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Including the Monsanto\nseeds?\nMR. WALTERS: Including the Monsanto seeds.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Some of them would -- would\ngrow at different rates than others.\nMR. WALTERS: Absolutely.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How come that's not\na problem the first time you plant?\nMR. WALTERS: It's a problem each time.\nThis is a very poor choice -- choice of seed, but it\nonly makes sense to plant in a risky situation, like\nwhen a farmer has been washed out from a flood, for\nexample, and it's late in the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no. I mean the\nvery first time, you get nothing but Monsanto Ready --\nRoundup Ready seeds and you plant those. Are you\ntelling us you have the same problem with them growing\nat different rates and all that?\nMR. WALTERS: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that doesn't make\nthe commodity seeds any different?\nMR. WALTERS: I'm sorry. I must have\nmisunderstood your question. The commodity seeds,\nwith -- the Roundup Ready commodity seeds will all grow\nat different rates and have different disease\nresistance, different maturity rates.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But not the original batch\nthat he buys from Monsanto?\nMR. WALTERS: Correct. So --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The original batch that he\nbuys from Monsanto, in addition to being resistant to\nthe chemical that kills the weeds, in addition to that,\nthey all mature at the same rate.\nMR. WALTERS: Exactly. They're a uniform\nvariety. They are exactly what a farmer needs for\ntheir --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So all the Monsanto seeds\nare not -- are not fungible.\nMR. WALTERS: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There are some of them that\nmature early, some mature later.\nMR. WALTERS: It makes sense. I mean, they\nallow these seeds to be dumped into the common grain\nelevator. They don't put any restrictions on what the\nelevator does with it. There were no restrictions on my\nclient when he purchased them from the grain elevator.\nSo it's less of a problem for Monsanto for\npeople going to the grain elevator to plant.\nNevertheless, it's -- it's an outright sale, an\nexhaustion applies to that particular sale, and permits\nthat farmer to use it. It's never going to be a threat\nto Monsanto's business -- people planting grain elevator\nseed.\nNow, to answer your question, Justice Kagan,\nabout -- well, under our theory, if somebody does breach\na contract with Monsanto, they don't have to do it under\ncontract law, they can actually do it under an agency\nmodel, like General Electric did in the 1920s. And then\nthat's only fair because there, the agent growers are\nassuming -- well, Monsanto was assuming the risk that\nthe farmers are.\nAnd there is some equitability there with\nthe -- the risk sharing between the farmers and\nMonsanto. Now they want the farmers to take all the\nrisks associated with farming, yet they want to control\nhow they use those seeds all the way down the\ndistribution chain.\nI will reserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMs. Sherry?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MELISSA ARBUS SHERRY,\nFOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nI'd like to start by talking about this\nCourt's decision in J.E.M. because I think it largely\nresolves this case. J.E.M. was a patent case, and the\nissue there was whether or not you could get a utility\npatent on a plant. The argument was that you couldn't\nget a utility patent because the Plant Variety\nProtection Act implicitly repealed the Patent Act in\nthat respect.\nThis Court rejected that argument, and the\nreason it rejected that argument was because it found no\nconflict between the two statutes. The reason it found\nno conflict between the two statutes is because it said\nthat it is harder to get a utility patent, and for that\nreason, you get greater protections -- under the Patent\nAct, you get greater rights of exclusion under the\nPatent Act than you do under the PVPA.\nAnd it said, most notably, there is no seed\nsaving exemption in the Patent Act, there is no research\nexemption in the Patent Act. The consequence of\nPetitioner's argument would be that this Court would not\nonly be reading a seed-saving exemption into the Patent\nAct, and a research exemption, it would be doing much,\nmuch, much more under the guise of patent exhaustion.\nJustice Breyer, as you pointed out, the\nExhaustion Doctrine really has nothing to do with this\ncase, and that's because the Exhaustion Doctrine has\nalways been limited to the particular article that was\nsold, and we are talking about a different article here.\nAnd it's never extended to the making of a new article.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but I mean,\nthis -- the reason it's never is because this is an\nentirely different case. It's the reason it's here\nbecause you have the intersection of the Exhaustion\nDoctrine and the -- the normal protection of reinvented\narticles. So I don't think it gets you very far to say\nthat we've never applied the Exhaustion Doctrine that\nway either. We have never applied the Reinvention\nDoctrine to articles that reinvent themselves like plant\nseed.\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: It's true that the Court\nhasn't had an exhaustion case specifically involving the\nsort of replicating technology, but when the Court has\ntalked about exhaustion it has always focused on the\nspecific article that's sold and it has done that for a\nreason. The concept underlying exhaustion is that when\nthe patentholder controls that very first sale it gets\nthe one royalty with respect to the actual article sold.\nPetitioner's argument isn't limited to the\ncommodity grain that we are talking about. It's not\neven limited -- when you talk -- Justice Breyer, you\nmentioned the three different generations of seeds.\nThere is actually quite a few more generations than\nthose three.\nIf the concept is the sale of a parent plant\nexhausts the patentholder's rights, not only with\nrespect to that seed, but with respect to all the\nprogeny seed, we would have to go all the way back to\nthe very first Roundup Ready plant that was created as\npart of the transformation event. Every single Roundup\nReady seed in existence today is the progeny of that one\nparent plant and, as Your Honor pointed out, that would\neviscerate patent protections. There would be no\nincentive to invest, not just in Roundup Ready soybeans\nor not even agricultural technology, but it's quite a\nbit broader than that.\nIn order to encourage investment, the Patent\nAct provides 20 years of exclusivity. This would be\nreducing the 20-year term to essentially one and only\nsale. It would be near impossible to recoup your\ninvestments with that first sale and so the more likely\nconsequence is that research dollars would be put\nelsewhere.\nThe other --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's a pretty horrible\nresult, but let me give you another horrible result, and\nthat is if -- if we agree with you, farmers will not be\nable to do a second planting by simply getting the\nundifferentiated seeds from -- from a grain elevator\nbecause at least a few of those seeds will always be\npatented seeds, and no farmer could ever plant anything\nfrom a grain elevator, which means -- I gather they use\nit for second plantings where the risks are so high that\nit doesn't pay to buy expensive seed. Now they can't do\nthat any more because there's practically no grain\nelevator that doesn't have at least one patented seed in\nit.\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: And the answer to that is\nthis is actually not a traditional farming practice.\nDespite what Petitioner says, farmers do not generally\ngo to grain elevators, buy commingled grain, plant it in\nthe ground as seed. If you look at the American Soybean\nAssociation brief submitted on behalf of soybean\nfarmers, it says as much. If you look at the CHS brief,\nwhich is submitted on behalf of grain elevators, it also\nexplains that.\nAnd there is a number of reasons why that is\nthe case. There's the reasons that Petitioner talked\nabout, which is that they an undifferentiated mix, but\nthere are other reasons as well. The business of grain\nelevators is not to sell commingled grain as seed. If\nthat was their business they would have to comply with\nseed labeling laws. They do not do so because it's not\ntheir business model.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's why it's so cheap.\nAnd that's why farmers --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- and that's why farmers\nwant to use it, for a cheap planting.\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: But farmers wouldn't be\nable to use it for another reason as well. Even if you\ntake patent law and you put it entirely to the side,\nthere is still the Plant Variety Protection Act.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But correct me -- correct\nme if I am wrong; I thought that is what Bowman did.\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: Bowman did, absolutely\ndid it in this circumstance. But Bowman also said that\nhe is not aware of other farmers who are engaging in\nthis practice.\nAnd again, there is another reason. Putting\naside the labeling laws, there is the Plant Variety\nProtection Act and, as Pioneer points out in their\namicus brief, it is quite likely that a large amount of\nthe commingled grain is not only protected by patent,\nbut is actually protected by a Plant Variety Protection\nCertificate, and what Petitioner did here would infringe\nthe Plant Variety Protection Certificate. So even\nputting patent law to the side, this is not an\neconomically viable source of seed for farmers,\nregardless.\nAnd Petitioner's argument again isn't\nlimited to the grain elevators. It would apply to\nsaving your own seed and planting it generation after\ngeneration.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Sure, sure, I understand.\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: It would apply to selling\nseeds to your neighboring farmer, and it would allow\nseed companies to essentially compete with Monsanto upon\nthe first sale.\nNow to the extent --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So when -- when are\nthe patent rights exhausted in the seed?\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: The patent rights are\nexhausted in the seed at the same time they are\nexhausted with respect to any other product, upon an\nauthorized sale. And so, Justice Breyer, again you had\nit right when you were saying that you can do what you\nwant. In our view, once there is an authorized sale,\nyou can do what you want with respect to the seed that\nyou've actually purchased. That is the tangible article\nyou paid for.\nBut you do need permission from the\npatentholder in order to make a new generation of seed.\nIf -- to the extent, you know, any middle ground is\nwarranted, with all due respect, we would point to\nCongress as the appropriate body. This Court said --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. Just so\nI can follow your -- just so I can follow your answer,\nMonsanto sells the seed to the farmer. And you are\nsaying if the farmer grows the seed, he can sell it to\nanybody he wants, right?\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: If Monsanto authorizes --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm putting aside\nall the contracts and stuff.\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: Right. So if Monsanto\nauthorized that first sale and authorized the planting,\nthey would also have to authorize the sale of the second\ngeneration seed because it's a new article. And that's\nexactly what happened here.\nIf you look at the technology agreement --\nand it's not just because it's a contract because I\nthink it's significant to the analysis -- Monsanto, upon\nthe first sale of the bag of Roundup Ready seed,\nauthorizes the planting for one commercial crop and it\nauthorizes the farmer to sell that as a commercial crop\nor to use it for any purpose other than replanting.\nThat is an authorized sale. So if you take\nthat second generation seed -- \"second generation\" is a\nbit of a misnomer, but if you take that seed and you\nfollow it through, all of the patent rights with respect\nto that particular seed have been exhausted. But you\ncannot take that seed without separate authorization,\nplant it in the ground, and come up with the next\ngeneration of seed. That would be --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That sounds like the\npatent rights haven't been exhausted then.\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: They have been exhausted\nwith respect to the particular article sold. When the\nCourt's talked about patent exhaustion, you are not\nexhausting the rights with respect to the patented\ninvention. You're exhausting --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You are saying it's\nexhausted with respect to the one bean?\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: Yes, and that's always\nthe case just as if I sell -- I mean, even if you think\nin the copyright --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's always the\ncase because it's a very -- the other cases haven't\ninvolved the -- this situation where you are talking\nabout a self-regenerating product.\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: But I think there is\nother technology out there. I mean, even if you think\nof software, for example, there are plenty of other\nproducts where one reasonable use is to make more. I\ncan purchase software; one reasonable use would be to\nmake a dozen other copies to give to my friends or sell\non eBay. It's a reasonable use, but it's an infringing\none.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, we haven't had\nthat case either.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: The Court hasn't had that\ncase exactly, but it did decide Microsoft v. AT&T, and\ngranted that was on a slightly different issue, but in\nthat case the Court recognized -- that case, it was\ncopies from a master disk, and it treated them as\nseparate copies because they were actually separate\narticles, even though it was really easy to do, even\nthough the actual copying is not done by human hands,\nit's done by -- by mechanical processes. In fact, in\nthat case the Court talked and compared the making of\nsoftware to the reproduction through biological\nprocesses, which is what we are talking about here.\nAnd so all we are asking the Court to do\ntoday -- I recognize it's a new technology and to the\nextent new technologies require different rules,\nCongress is the body that should be making those\ndifferent rules. And when Congress has acted in this\narea, in the Plant Variety Protection Act and also in\nthe software context in the Copyright Act, it has not\nadopted the wholesale exemption that Petitioner is\ntalking for here.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Sherry -- I'm sorry. In\neverything you've said you agree with Mr. Waxman. There\nis this issue in the case where you disagree, which is\nthe Conditional Sale Doctrine. I am just wondering,\nbefore you finish up, could you say a bit about whether\nthat doctrine is causing trouble as it presently exists\nin the Federal Circuit? In other words, could we just\nignore that doctrine if we wanted to, or is it a very\nproblematic one that we should take this opportunity to\ndo something about?\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: Your Honor, may I?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure.\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: I think the Court does\nnot need to do something about it in this case. I think\nQuanta largely decided the issue, even though it didn't\nsay so explicitly, and as far as I'm aware the Federal\nCircuit has not applied their previous version of the\nConditional Sale Doctrine to enforce the post-sale\nrestrictions since this Court's decision in Quanta.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Waxman.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. WAXMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nLet me start by answering a couple of, I\nguess, science or technology questions that came up\nbefore launching into our doctrinal position.\nFirst of all, Justice Kennedy, soybeans are\nsoybeans. They are harvested at a particular point in\ntime, whatever use is going to be made for them. It is\nnot a plant like a flower, geranium for example, which\nhas to be left to go to seed, or alfalfa. The bean is\nthe seed.\nAll soybeans have to be processed to be used\nin any way. If they are going to be planted, they have\nto be cleaned before they are put in the ground at the\nright time. If they are being fed to either humans or\nanimals, they have to be processed in a way that\neliminates an enzyme that makes them indigestible by\nanimals.\nJustice Scalia, your question about well,\nfarmers now just can't do second plantings because\nsoybeans are put in huge grain elevators and different\nvarieties are mingled, that is true in the sense that if\none or more of those soybeans were protected by a\npatent, the actual growing of the use of those patented\ninventions without a license would be infringement,\nalthough, of course, if no glyphosate were put on top of\nit, neither the farmer nor Monsanto would ever know that\nthere was an act of infringement.\nBut more to the point, farmers -- I mean,\nthe planting of second crops, that is crop rotation of\ninterspersing soybeans and winter wheat, is very, very\ncommon. There are hundreds of thousands of soybean\nfarmers who do this every year.\nMr. Bowman has acknowledged that so far as\nhe knows, he's the only one who's doing it this way.\nBut there are plenty of other ways in which he could\nobtain a much less expensive crop of -- you know, a\nparticular variety of soybean, so one that will all grow\nto the same height and germinate at the same time. And\nin fact, he explained this to the district court in his\nresponse to the motion for summary judgment at page 152a\nof the joint appendix.\nHe said defendant wanted a cheap source of\nseed for his second crop beans because of the normal\nrisks in growing \"wheat beans;\" that is, the second crop\nthat follows the harvesting of winter wheat.\nQuote, \"defendant simply wasn't going to\nplant the high priced soybean seed after his wheat\ncrop.\" And here's the relevant sentence. \"Defendant\ncould have purchased conventional seed, that is,\nnon-patented seed, and then saved its offspring for\nwheat beans.\"\nIn other words, he could have gone and\nbought a non-patented -- a bag of non-patented seed for\nmuch less money, and used it as his second crop, or\nharvested a portion of it -- and soybeans replicate at a\nrate between 20 and 80 times in each generation -- and\nhave a perpetual source for his second crop thereafter.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But he couldn't put the\nherbicide on -- he couldn't -- if he went and bought\nconventional seeds, not the genetically improved seeds\n--\nMR. WAXMAN: Exactly.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- then -- then he\nwouldn't -- what would the yield be if he put the\nherbicide on it and they were all killed?\nMR. WAXMAN: Justice Ginsburg, the -- the\nglyphosate resistance doesn't change the yield of a\nparticular plant, it changes the way you have to control\nweeds. And he would not be able to use Monsanto's\ntechnology that would allow aerial application of an\nherbicide. He would have to -- if he wanted to buy\nplain old, you know, conventional soybeans, he has to\ncontrol for weeds in the conventional way.\nAnd here's the very next sentence in his\nresponse to the Court. \"Defendant\" -- that is, instead\nof purchasing conventional seeds and saving them, he\nsays \"Defendant decided to purchase a grain dealer's\ncommodity grain because he felt there was a good chance\nhe would obtain mostly grain that would be resistant to\nglyphosate,\" and therefore, he could use Monsanto's\ntechnology without having to pay for it.\nMr. Chief Justice, your question about this\nis a new case and -- let me go first to your first\nquestion in the case, which is why would a company ever\nwant to do this? I think the answer is that without the\nability -- let's talk about soybeans and then broaden it\nto other kinds of readily replicable technologies --\nwithout the ability to limit reproduction of soybeans\ncontaining this patented trait, Monsanto could not have\ncommercialized its invention, and never would have\nproduced what is, by now, the most popular agricultural\ntechnology in America because, as Ms. Sherry was\npointing out, the sale of the very first Roundup Ready\nsoybean seed, from which all the trillions of Roundup\nReady soybean seeds in existence now derive, would have,\nunder Mr. Bowman's theory, fully exhausted not only\nMonsanto's rights in that seed that was sold, but in all\nprogeny unto the -- however many generations\nJustice Breyer thinks is \"not too many.\"\nI think it's important to understand how\nthis technology works. The Department of Agriculture\nlicensed Monsanto to engage in a transformation event;\nthat is, to introduce its recombinant gene into soybean\ngerm plasma. It's illegal to do it unless you get a\ngovernment license to do it. And you can do it once.\nAnd that is done by the technology company, use --\ntaking something what's called a gene gun and using the\ngene gun to inject recombinant DNA into regular germ\nplasm.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What do you mean you can do\nit once? I don't know what you --\nMR. WAXMAN: The -- the Department of\nAgriculture authorized Monsanto to engage in -- to\ntransform natural -- natural plant material with its\nrecombinant gene in one single event that is referred to\nas a transformation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: One shot of a gun.\nMR. WAXMAN: I think you may be able to\nshoot several -- I don't know whether you can shoot a\nwhole round or whatever. But in any event, it's one\nevent.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You can't rob a bank with\nit, though, right?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. WAXMAN: I, in my mind, have been trying\nto figure out what a gene gun looks like. And I don't\nknow -- I don't know if you could use it to rob a bank.\nBut the point is -- and the -- the Federal Register site\nfor the transformation event with respect to Roundup\nReady is -- is provided in a footnote in our brief.\nWhat happens then is that Monsanto uses those\ntransformed cells to grow a soybean plant.\nAnd that soybean plant produces genetic --\nproduces seeds or soybeans that have the recombinant\nRoundup Ready technology in it. Monsanto then provides\n-- in almost all of the cases, Monsanto engages in\nlicensed sales of those transformed seeds to hundreds of\ndifferent seed companies that produce different\nvarieties, and they make both conventional seed with a\nparticular varietal makeup and a Roundup Ready version\nof that variety.\nMonsanto provides the soybeans that it has\ntransformed to the seed companies, to the hundreds of\nseed companies for consideration. Under Mr. Bowman's\ntheory, that was it for all of Monsanto's rights with\nrespect to this technology. The very first time it took\nan original transformed seed and sold it to a seed\ncompany so that it could bulk up and cross-breed and\nproduce different varieties, Monsanto had lost all of\nits patent rights.\nIn other words, by go at -- having committed\nhundreds of millions of dollars in 13 years to develop\nthis technology in the very first sale of an article\nthat practices the patent, it would have exhausted its\nrights in perpetuity.\nNow, we --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Waxman, there is a\nworrisome thing on the other side, though, too. And\nthat is that your position has the -- has the capacity\nto make infringers out of everybody. And that is\nhighlighted actually in this case by how successful this\nproduct is and how large a percentage of the market it\nhas had.\nSo that -- you know, seeds can be blown onto\na farmer's farm by wind, and all of a sudden you have\nRoundup seeds there and the person -- farmer is\ninfringing, or there's a 10-year-old who wants to do a\nscience project of creating a soybean plant, and he goes\nto the supermarket and gets an edamame, and it turns out\nthat it's Roundup seeds.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And, you know, these Roundup\nseeds are everywhere, it seems to me. There's, what,\n90 percent of all the seeds that are around? So it\nseems as though -- like pretty much everybody is an\ninfringer at this point, aren't they?\nMR. WAXMAN: Certainly not. Let me make --\nlet me make three points, starting with the edamame and\nmoving up to inadvertent infringers.\nEdamame is an immature form of the soybean\nseed. You can plant edamame --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Okay. I'll change my\nhypothetical.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. WAXMAN: If I take my -- you know, my\nGirl Scout troop and have them do a science experiment,\nit will rot, but it will not generate. And that --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And I thought I was being so\nclever, too.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, it also reminds me that\nmy original answer to Justice Kennedy is wrong, which is\nthat edamame is taken from the pods before the -- the\nthing becomes actually a seed that can be processed in\nany other way.\nYour point about the ubiquity of Roundup\nReady -- Roundup Ready's use is a fair one. I mean,\nthis is probably the most rapidly adopted technological\nadvance in history. The very first Roundup Ready\nsoybean seed was only made in 1996. And it now is grown\nby more than 90 percent of the 275,000 soybean farms in\nthe United States.\nBut size -- that is, success -- has never\nbeen thought and can't be thought to affect the contour\nof patent rights. You may very -- with soybeans, the\nproblem of blowing seed is not an issue for soybeans.\nSoybeans don't -- I mean, it would take Hurricane Sandy\nto blow a soybean into some other farmer's field. And\nsoybeans, in any event, are -- you know, have perfect\nflowers; that is, they contain both the pollen and the\nstamen, so that they -- which is the reason that they\nbreed -- breed true, unlike, for example, corn.\nThe point that there may be many farmers\nwith respect to other crops, like alfalfa, that may have\nsome inadvertent Roundup Ready alfalfa in their fields\nmay be true, although it's -- it is not well documented.\nThere would be inadvertent infringement if the farmer\nwas cultivating a patented crop, but there would be no\nenforcement of that.\nThe farmer wouldn't know, Monsanto wouldn't\nknow, and in any event, the damages would be zero\nbecause you would ask what the reasonable royalty would\nbe, and if the farmer doesn't want Roundup Ready\ntechnology and isn't using Roundup Ready technology to\nsave costs and increase productivity, the -- the royalty\nvalue would be zero.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, is -- I mean, that is\nan interesting question because you can imagine -- you\nsee, this is -- your answer -- this really deals with\nall -- it could be with genetic patents, with -- with\nhosts of things which are self-replicating.\nMR. WAXMAN: Mm-hmm.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And some of the\nself-replicating items, which are infringing items, end\nup inadvertently all over the place. Is there anything\nin the patent law that deals with that? Is an\ninvoluntary infringer treated the same under patent law\nas a voluntary infringer?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is -- is there precautions\nthat you take? I mean, is there anything in patent law\nthat helps?\nMR. WAXMAN: So infringement is -- unlike\ncontributory infringement or induced infringement, the\nact of infringement, that is a violation of Section\n271 --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Right.\nMR. WAXMAN: -- is a strict liability tort,\nbut it requires affirmative volitional contact --\nconduct. That is, it's not that -- a thing doesn't\ninfringe; a person infringes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, the person plants it.\nMR. WAXMAN: The person --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, he plants it, but\nhe doesn't even know, you know. He's just got -- we can\nimagine a lot of circumstances where this would be a --\nwhere Justice Kagan's question could apply.\nMR. WAXMAN: I mean, take the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But you're just saying that\nwould need a --\nMR. WAXMAN: Sure.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- modification in patent\nlaw.\nMR. WAXMAN: Of course. I mean, take the\nexample, and this goes to I think the comment made by\nthe Chief Justice, that even in the software context, we\nhaven't had this case yet. You did have this case in --\nin Microsoft v. AT&T that involved, you know,\nMicrosoft's golden disk that has the Windows Operating\nSystem on it, which is patented, and was being exported\noverseas for introduction into, you know, computers that\nwere manufactured overseas. And AT&T's patent, which\nwas a method of compressing speech, was practiced by the\nWindows software.\nAnd this Court held that, although the\nwriting of the Windows Operating System into computers\nin the United States would have infringed the patent,\nand when Microsoft did that it did infringe AT&T's\npatent, the fact that the copies were made onto the hard\ndrives of the computer overseas meant that the act of\ninfringement occurred overseas and there was not an\nexport of -- of an infringing product for the purposes\nof infringing overseas for purposes of Section 271(f).\nSo I think you have decided in the context\nof software, which of course replicates even more\nreadily than soybeans do or vaccines or cell lines or\nplasmids, that the copies that are actually made when\na -- a software is written onto the hard drive of a\ncomputer is a different thing than the disk that was\nsent and is infringing, if it occurs within the United\nStates.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What about -- what about\nthe other question --\nMR. WAXMAN: So the other one --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no, no, I want to go\nback to a different question that was asked, which was\nthe question what do you think we should do about this\nother aspect of the case, the licensing aspect? I mean,\nI would have thought it doesn't concern Monsanto's\nlicense of generation 1 because, insofar as it's\nrelevant, here generation 1 carries the license that is\njust permissive.\nIt is to create generation 2. But -- but\nthey also said something in the circuit about a\nlicense -- about a restriction, implied perhaps, on --\non the use of generation 2 by the grain elevator for\ncreating generation 3, namely you can't do that.\nNow, they -- they thought, the circuit, that\nthere's some restriction in a license and they have a\ndoctrine that seems to say that you can restrict\nlicenses -- through licenses the use of a product after\nit's been sold. And that would seem contrary to the\nFirst Sale Doctrine.\nMR. WAXMAN: Okay. Let me -- let me answer\nyour question this way: First of all, we don't think\nthat there's any need whatsoever for this Court -- we\nagree with the government that there's no need for the\nCourt to address the question of conditional sales and\nthe extent to which patent law recognizes under some\ncircumstances conditional sales because in this case the\nFederal Circuit did not address that ground which we\nadvocated and we still advocate, but instead said -- and\nI'm reading from 14a of the petition appendix.\n\"Even if Monsanto's patent rights in the\ncommodity seeds are exhausted, such a conclusion would\nbe of no consequence because once a grower like Bowman\nplants the commodity seeds containing Monsanto's Roundup\nReady technology and the next generation of seed\ndevelops, the grower has created a newly infringing\narticle.\"\nIn other words, what the Federal Circuit\ndecided, and it is entirely correct and it should be\naffirmed on that basis, is what you're calling, I think\ngeneration 3, let's say that for simplicity's sake,\nsince generation 1 is the original soybean sold by\nMonsanto to seed companies, let's just say that the bags\nof soybean seeds that farmers go to purchase from seed\ndealers is called generation N and they are licensed to\nproduce generation N plus 1. But then, what about N\nplus 2?\nSo what the Federal Circuit held is N plus 2\nhas never been sold. It was created, it exists without\na sale, and because a sale is the sine qua non of patent\nexhaustion, which is also referred to as first sale,\nthere is no exhaustion.\nAlternatively, the Federal Circuit said in\nany event, even when exhaustion applies, it only\nprivileges the using or selling of the article sold; as\nYour Honor's questions pointed out originally, it never\nprivileges the making of a new infringing product.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Could -- could you prevail\nin this case if we focused just on use rather than make?\nMR. WAXMAN: If you're referring to\ngeneration N plus 2, the answer is yes, because those\nare newly infringing products with no exhaustion of\nMonsanto's rights, and as a consequence farmers have no\nauthority to use, make, sell, or offer to sell without\nMonsanto's authorization. That is a -- just a\nstraightforward application of Section 271.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Waxman, I want to go\nback to Justice Breyer's question and reformulate it as\na different question, with I think the same answer --\nMR. WAXMAN: Okay.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- but I just want to\nmake sure you and the government are exactly on the same\npage.\nBoth of you are suggesting, I think -- that\nwas Ms. Sherry's last response -- that we were explicit\nenough in Quanta and we don't have to address whatever\nlingering confusion the Federal Circuit may have with\nrespect to conditional sales at all in this case?\nMR. WAXMAN: I --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're -- you're telling\nus we don't need to reach that prong and we shouldn't.\nMR. WAXMAN: I'm -- I agree that you don't\nneed to reach the prong and you shouldn't.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I understand we don't\nneed to, but the question is should we? Is there a\nneed --\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, I think --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- generally in -- in\nclarifying some lingering confusion?\nMR. WAXMAN: I think that -- I think that an\nappropriate case will come up where it will be important\nfor you to determine that. And our third argument,\nwhich wasn't addressed by the Federal Circuit and isn't\nnecessary to affirm, is that conditional sales are not\nipso facto unenforceable; that is, a -- in an instant --\neverybody understands that if instead of selling\ntechnology, you lease it, and you sign a license that\nimposes conditions on that lease, you know, unless they\nare unreasonable, conditions that are reasonably related\nto exploitation of the invention are enforceable. Mr.\nBowman acknowledges that. Everyone acknowledges that.\nOur single submission here is that where you\nhave a technology that cannot be leased because it will\nconsume itself in whatever use one makes of it, and\ntherefore has to be -- an article embodying the\ninvention has to be sold and where the invention cannot\nbe commercialized if it -- if the inventor has to\nrealize its full costs of development and a reasonable\nrate of return on the first sale, the fact that there is\nthis necessary sale in order to commercialize the\ninvention cannot ipso facto make all such conditions\nunenforceable. And that's all -- if you were to reach\nthe conditional sale issue in this case, that is all we\nthink this case stands for. And the reason I think --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Actually then you do\nhave a different position than the government does.\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes, and I think the reason, if\nwe take it out of the soybean area, let's look at\nvaccines. Because the Roundup Ready gene essentially\nimmunizes soybean plants from the herbicide in the same\nway that a life-saving vaccine will immunize individuals\nthat receive it from some external -- it wouldn't be a\nherbicide -- a life threat.\nOkay. Vaccines are live. They have live\ncultures; they can regenerate themselves. If a company\ndevelops the vaccine for, you know, H1 -- I shouldn't be\nusing -- an important life-saving vaccine --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. WAXMAN: -- it's unsupportable to say\nthat you cannot sell a quantity of that vaccine without\nexhausting all of your rights in it.\nI mean, when -- when Schering-Plough or\nBristol-Myers develops a vaccine and sells some of it to\nCVS so I can go in and get injected, they haven't lost\nall of their patent rights in that vaccine. CVS can't\nturn around and become a competitor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Simplifying this case,\nyou can't take the person who's been given the vaccine\nand take vials of their blood and keep selling it? Is\nthat your --\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes, and keep -- well, keep\nreplicating it in competition. Take another example --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, is that how it\nworks?\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I'm serious. I\nmean, your example, it seems to me, is not quite on\npoint because it's not a situation where the intended\nuse of the vaccine necessarily results in regeneration\nof it. In your hypothetical, CVS was going to some lab\nand making more, right?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, CVS was presumably buying\nit either from the manufacturer or another lab. But the\npoint here is, to take the software example, if I go to,\nyou know, Staples and buy the Windows operating system\non a disk, I don't have the authority to put it in a\ndisk replicator and press a button and make a million\ncopies of it. And --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But you don't need that\nbecause in each instance, as you say, you are making new\nones. It's the making of the new ones, not the use of\nthe old ones, where you prevent that from being done.\nMR. WAXMAN: Yeah. Well, let me -- the\nexample that comes to mind is, of course, poor\nDr. Chakrabarty who, you know, invented a new man-made\nbacteria. Bacteria replicate themselves, unlike\nsoybeans which require human intervention. I mean, the\nnotion --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then you use the word\n\"use.\"\nMR. WAXMAN: Excuse me?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then you use the word \"use\"\nand you get to the same place.\nMR. WAXMAN: I mean, my submission about --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't think you can think\nof an example. I mean, you say -- I don't think you can\nthink of an example where if you win on the other\nground, you can produce a bad result for the\nmanufacturer or the inventor because you haven't treated\nthe conditional sale like a license. I'm not saying you\ncan't, I just can't think of one.\nMR. WAXMAN: Okay. Here's one. I will use\nsomething that doesn't make itself because we think that\nis covered by the new article. Let's say that I invent\na new, miraculous new machine. I get a patent for it.\nI want people to be able -- I'm going to\ncommercialize it. Or I'm going to license with people\nto commercialize it, but I want people to be able to\nstudy it and research it. And so, like Monsanto with\nits seeds, I sign -- I provide a copy of the machine to\nMIT, with a research-only license; that is, you can use\nthis machine to figure out how it works and develop new\napplications and all that sort of stuff.\nIf that sale is exhausting for all purposes,\nI can't prevent MIT or a third party that MIT provides\nthe machine for --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So lease it.\nMR. WAXMAN: -- to go into competition with\nit.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So lease it.\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes, but you can't lease\narticles like software and, you know, soybeans that\nconsume themselves in any use, other than an art\nexperiment.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I do have this problem\nthat goes back to Justice Scalia's example. What about\nthe commodity bin that has 2 percent of the patented\nseeds in them? Now, you get away from the article by\nsaying, oh, well, almost all seeds are Roundup these\ndays. But let's have some different commodity where\nthere are three or four different patented items, but 1\npercent or 2 percent of the seeds are in the bin. You\ncan't -- you can't sell those. That seems to me a very\nextreme result.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, I mean, when you say you\ncan't sell them. So, as Ms. Sherry was pointing out --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You can't sell them if\nthey know they are going to be used for seeds, and you\ncan't use them for seeds even though there is only\n1 percent of the seeds?\nMR. WAXMAN: That would be true even if this\ncase came out another way, Justice Kennedy. First of\nall, because grain elevators are prohibited by State and\nFederal law from selling seed, period. They sell --\nthey buy grain and they sell grain. They can't sell\nseed.\nNumber 2, almost all varieties of soybeans\nor other crop plants are currently protected by the --\nunder the patent -- the Plant Variety Protection Act.\nAs this Court and Congress recognized, the requisites\nfor getting a certificate are -- I mean, it's like a\nregistration requirement.\nAnd we know from J.E.M., and the relevant\nprovision of the PVPA, that it is unlawful to divert\ncrops that are protected by a PVPA certificate for\nreproductive uses. So irrespective of all of this,\nwhatever happens, even if there is only 1 percent of\npatented soybeans in a grain elevator, the grain\nelevator can't sell it as seed both under the Federal\nand State seed laws and under the Patent Variety\nProtection Act.\nThat's why the solution for farmers like\nMonsanto -- like Mr. Bowman, is to simply buy\nconventional seed, multiply it, you know, 20, 30, 40,\n50, 80 times in a single generation and save 1/80th of\nit to replant in his second crop, if he doesn't want to\nbuy Roundup Ready technology for his second crop and use\nthe glyphosate aerially.\nUnless the Court has further questions, we\nwill submit.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Waxman.\nMr. Walters, you have five minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARK P. WALTERS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. WALTERS: I'd like to first address the\nstatement that this is not a traditional farming\npractice. It may be occasional, when a farmer is in a\nreal desperate situation, or it may apply to\nMr. Bowman's situation, where he wanted a very cheap\nsource of seed for his second crop.\nBut in the record at 153a, among other\nplaces, he discusses how he's gone to the grain elevator\nover the years a number of times, and how other farmers\nhave gone to the grain elevator for generations. So a\nruling in favor of Monsanto here would effectively\neliminate that seed --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you agree that it's\nunlawful for grain elevators to sell it for replanting?\nMR. WALTERS: No. I do not. And what he is\nreferring to is State labeling laws that prevent grain\nelevators from actually scooping up grain, packaging it\nup and saying this is seed, because they all look alike\nto -- to the eye. And so grain elevators are certainly\nnot allowed to dupe seed purchasers, but those laws are\nthere to protect the seed purchasers.\nMr. Bowman bought grain without any\nrestrictions on how he could use it. That broke no\nlaws, and it does not violate the PVPA. I mean,\nMonsanto didn't assert a PVPA certificate. Surely it\nhas them. Did not assert them in this case and could\nnot assert them in this case because there's no single\nvariety that Mr. Bowman planted. So that's not a good\nargument.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- what about\nMr. Waxman's suggestion that we've already decided this\nin Microsoft v. AT&T?\nMR. WALTERS: That case is not on point,\nYour Honor. That had to do with 271(f), and actually\ncame out on the side of more restrictive patent rights.\nAnd this is not like software. This is an invention\nthat the only way to use the invention -- now, repeat,\nthe only way to use the invention -- is to plant it and\nto grow more seeds.\nSo if you don't apply the Exhaustion\nDoctrine and allow someone to use it, you're choosing\npatent rights over personal property rights, and that's\nnever been done in 150 years of this Court's exhaustion\ncase law.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Don't people or animals eat\nthem?\nMR. WALTERS: That is certainly a use, but\nit's not the invention.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, then why is it the\nonly way you can do is to plant them? That isn't the\nonly thing you could do with it.\nMR. WALTERS: Well, that's not use of the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You can buy them from the\ngrain elevator and sell them for other things.\nMR. WALTERS: That's not use of the\ninvention, Justice Breyer. And exhaustion is about\nconferring on the purchaser a right to use the\ninvention. There's no limit to Monsanto's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The invented product. The\ninvented thing. The invented aspect of the seed is it\nhas a gene in it that repels some other insecticide or\nsomething that they have. I understand that.\nMR. WALTERS: The same argument came up in\nQuanta, Your Honor, with --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You don't use that. I\ndon't think they used that particular -- well, go ahead.\nYou go ahead.\nMR. WALTERS: There were other uses for the\ncomputer chips, of course, that were asserted. And the\nkey was that those computer chips practiced the patent.\nAnd you would swallow up the Exhaustion Doctrine\nentirely if we just could think of other uses for these\nthings that have been sold.\nThe key is, does it use -- is the purchaser\nallowed to use the invention? And under Monsanto's\ntheory, the purchaser isn't allowed to do that. And\nthat's no Exhaustion Doctrine at all --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The people buying from\ngrain elevators are mostly people who take these\nchips -- whatever they are, the seeds -- and they sell\nthem for making tofu, or they sell them to eat, or\nthis -- there are loads of uses, aren't there?\nMR. WALTERS: But the only use of the\ninvention is to plant it, and that's the use that\nMr. Bowman makes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but -- but that's --\nnothing prevents him from planting it. What he is\nprevented from doing is using the -- the consequences of\nthat planting, the second generation seeds, for another\nplanting. That's all he is prevented from doing. He\ncan plant and harvest and eat or sell. He just can't\nplant, harvest, and then replant.\nMR. WALTERS: So -- the judgment in this\ncase was based on acres planted, and so I'm not sure how\nmany -- we talked a bit about the N plus 2 generation,\nand we don't know in the record what the N plus 2\ngeneration was, in terms of his sales or his yields.\nThat wasn't before the district court on summary\njudgment. So I'm not sure how you could affirm based on\nthe judgment below, which was a finding that conditional\nsales prevented the application of the Exhaustion\nDoctrine.\nThe other thing --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry, I didn't\nfollow that answer to Justice Scalia's question.\nMR. WALTERS: Could you ask it again?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You know, you're saying\nthat you are preventing him from using it. He's not\nprevented from using it. He can use it for what it's\nmeant for, for raising a crop. He just cannot use the\nproduct -- that new crop -- for replanting. That's all.\nHe has to sell that new crop for feed or for some other\npurpose. But to say that -- that he's prevented from\nusing what he has bought is simply not true. He can use\nit, plant it, and harvest the crop.\nMR. WALTERS: But you're saying that there's\nno exhaustion in the progeny where he owns that seed\noutright.\nWith that, we'll submit, and we'll ask that\nthe Court of Appeals be reversed.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
