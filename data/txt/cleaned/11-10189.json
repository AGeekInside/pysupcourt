WOLF\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. WOLF: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has\nsaid, repeatedly, \"As a general rule, a defendant should\nnot raise an issue of ineffective assistance of counsel\non direct appeal,\" and has recognized that Texas\nprocedure make it, \"virtually impossible for appellate\ncounsel to adequately present such a claim.\" Those\nclaims are the choices made by the sovereign State of\nTexas, and it renders this case just like Martinez.\nThis case well illustrates the consequences\nof that choice. The transcript in this case was not\nready -- available for 7 months. That's 4 1/2 months\nafter the trial lost -- trial court lost jurisdiction on\nany new trial motion.\nThe State itself argued, quote -- in\nSprouse -- \"Without access to that record, new counsel\nwould have little basis for attacking the performance of\ntrial counsel.\"\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose the State's\nposition were not as you accurately have stated the\nTexas Court of Criminal Appeal. It didn't say\ncollateral review is the preferred route. It said\neither way will do. You can bring it up on direct\nappeal, or you can bring it up on collateral.\nWould you say that Martinez applies in that\nsituation? Or does it depend on having the -- the State\nhighest court in the matter saying, this is the\npreferred way to go?\nMR. WOLF: Texas systemically channels\nineffective assistance claims to collateral -- to State\nhabeas.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And if it didn't, if it\njust said, you can bring it up on direct, but we realize\nthese limitations because the transcript won't be ready,\nso you can wait and bring it up on habeas.\nI'm just asking how far -- the rule that you\nwould like us to adopt -- you say this is just like\nMartinez. Is that where you would draw the line, that\nthe -- the State's highest court has to say, we prefer\nthis matter to be brought up on collateral review?\nMR. WOLF: It's not just them saying it in\nwords, but it's also saying it in the legislation and in\nthe rules that the State of Texas has adopted.\nIn order to expand the record in a Wiggins\nclaim -- which is what's the basis of Mr. Trevino's\nclaim, in order to expand that record, you have a 30-day\nwindow to file a motion for new trial, and 75 days --\n75 days to have a hearing on it or else the court loses\njurisdiction by operation of law.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The district court,\nthe trial court?\nMR. WOLF: That's correct. And so you\ncouldn't expand the record. And, in order to present a\nWiggins claim, especially, it takes a considerable\namount of extra record investigation.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Has the Texas --\nhave the Texas appellate courts ever sent a -- a claim\nback for an evidentiary hearing?\nMR. WOLF: After 75 days, the -- the\ndistrict court loses jurisdiction, and I realize there\nare some jurisdictions around the country that have that\nopportunity. But Texas has a finality where there is no\nprovision to expand the record after that 75-day period.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So far as you know,\nthe court -- the appellate court's never done that?\nMR. WOLF: That's correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. Why does\nTexas afford people in your client's position a new\nappellate counsel?\nMR. WOLF: Well, there's two -- actually,\nTexas has a dual-track system. It was developed in\n1995, a year before the Federal system was developed in\nAEDPA. And the concept -- and the reason for it -- the\nrationale, was to expedite these type of claims,\nespecially in death penalty claims, under\nSection 11.071.\nBut the -- and the purpose is that there is\ntwo counsels that are appointed. One counsel is\nappointed to handle the record-based claims, and that's\ndone on direct appeal. The other counsel is appointed\nin all cases -- there's no question -- on habeas.\nAnd that attorney -- that counsel is\nappointed with the understanding that he's going to have\nthe time to do the extra-record-based claims. In a case\nlike this, the record wasn't even prepared for 7 months\nafter the date of the judgment.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I don't know\nthat you've answered Justice Ginsburg's question, and so\nI'm going to take it up because it interests me.\nLet's assume, as she did in her\nhypothetical, that a State says -- doesn't have any case\nlaw like Texas does, that says, we prefer you to go that\nway, for non-record-based claims.\nIs the difference between that hypothetical\nState that says, you can do either, and the Texas\nsituation, is that Texas, in your mind, puts up\nprocedural impediments to using the direct appeal\nmechanism and so that, if the other State hasn't done\nthat, has made the development of evidence, has provided\na full opportunity for you to develop a record before\nthe direct appeal is over with, that State wouldn't be\nsubject to Martinez, and Texas is subject to it only\nbecause it has the procedural impediments?\nMR. WOLF: That's correct because the -- the\nscheme that Texas has developed systemically channels\nthe habeas claim, the IAC claim, the ineffective\nassistance claim, into habeas. There is no -- to say\nthat it could be done is really an illusion.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: How -- how do you want us\nto formulate the rule if we write the opinion in your\nfavor? If a State does not give a realistic\nopportunity -- a feasible means for expanding the record\non direct review, then Martinez applies because it is\nthe collateral proceeding that is the meaningful one --\nand then we go through 50 States to see if that rule\napplies?\nMR. WOLF: Well, it wouldn't really affect\n50 States because some States provide a mechanism for an\nabatement to go back on direct appeal and -- and expand\nthe record. Other States require that it go to direct\nappeal, and each -- and those States made -- have made a\nchoice.\nAnd Texas has made a choice by developing\nthis scheme. And as far as the other States, they would\nhave to compare themselves to the situation that -- that\nwe would -- that would come out of this. This --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, I have the same\nquestions that my colleagues have asked. Could you give\nus, in a sentence or two, the test that you would like\nus to apply? Where a State does not, like Arizona,\nprohibit the raising of this issue on direct appeal,\nMartinez, nevertheless, applies where the State does\nblank. Fill in the blank.\nMR. WOLF: When it makes it impracticable,\nin the vast majority of cases, to raise the claim on\ndirect appeal.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Impracticable, in the vast\nmajority of cases. Now, that really would require a\ncase-by-case determination in every other State that\ndoesn't fall within the Martinez category, wouldn't it?\nMR. WOLF: Well, not necessarily --\nJUSTICE ALITO: No?\nMR. WOLF: -- Justice Alito, because\nthere's -- some States require that their -- their cases\nare directed back to -- to direct appeal, and there's a\nmechanism to expand the record. There is some -- there\nis -- some require it to go to direct appeal.\nBut, in Texas, what we have is a limitation\nthat's the rules that the Texas Supreme Court has\ndevised, with Texas --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, I understand that.\nBut -- so -- so the State says, you have to raise this\non direct appeal, but you have to comply with our time\nlimits on direct appeal. And they don't appoint -- you\nknow, you don't get a new -- you don't get a new\nattorney on direct appeal. It's the same attorney who\nrepresented you at trial. So that attorney is in the\nposition of arguing that he or she was ineffective at\ntrial.\nAnd that would be okay?\nMR. WOLF: If the -- let me make sure I\nunderstand the question.\nJUSTICE ALITO: You have to raise it on\ndirect appeal or it's lost. You can't wait until\ncollateral -- until the collateral proceeding, and, by\nthe way, you don't get a new attorney. You get the same\nattorney that represented you at trial. Would that be\nall right?\nMR. WOLF: No, because the new -- the old\nattorney -- the trial attorney is in the worst, really,\nposition to understand his ineffectiveness. There is a\ndisincentive for him --\nJUSTICE ALITO: All right. So you have the\nsame system where you get a new attorney, but you have\nto comply with the time limits.\nMR. WOLF: And that --\nJUSTICE ALITO: And then you say, well, I\ncan't do all of this social background research that\nWiggins requires within the time limits, so that's\nimpracticable. Is that State okay?\nMR. WOLF: No, because that's --\nJUSTICE ALITO: That's not okay, either.\nMR. WOLF: Because that State is -- in the\nTexas scheme -- in the Texas scheme, the -- Texas gives\nus another attorney in this dual track -- this system,\nand it's understood that that attorney is the habeas\nattorney. And he doesn't -- he doesn't have that time\nlimitation that the direct appeal attorney has,\nthat's -- that 75-day limitation.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But is your point that he\nhas to have one full and fair opportunity to make the\nWiggins claim, and it doesn't matter whether it's direct\nor collateral? I think you mentioned that at least one\nState requires you to do it on direct, but does provide\nfor developing the record.\nMR. WOLF: But the -- the bottom line in --\nin our situation, in Texas, is that we have a scheme.\nWe have a set of -- of laws and -- and rules that\nchannel these type of claims.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What are the rules other\nthan the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals having said, in\nseveral decisions, the preferred route is collateral\nreview?\nMR. WOLF: Well, first of all, the -- the\nRule -- the Rules of Appellate Procedure 21.8 talk about\nthe limitations of -- the number of days that you have\nto expand the record in a motion for new trial.\n75 days, the -- the district court loses jurisdiction,\nthey cannot hear anything else on this case. The record\nin this case wasn't even available for 7 months after\nthe date of the trial.\nSo, even with a new attorney that's\nappointed -- first of all, that new attorney is a\nstranger to the case. He doesn't know anything about\nthe case. He's not in a position to talk to the client.\nThe client is not the best person to understand the\nRules of Appellate Procedure.\nSo he's got to wait on that -- on that trial\nrecord, first of all, to see what's there. And then --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm -- I'm not sure\nexactly what Justice Ginsburg's formulation was, but I\ndidn't -- I don't understand why you didn't say, oh,\nyes, that's right, there has to be one full fair\nopportunity to raise the issue. And that's what we are\narguing here.\nMR. WOLF: I'm sorry if -- if I missed that,\nbut that's exactly the point. And that's what --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Then the next -- then my\nquestion is: Does this apply just to capital cases?\nMR. WOLF: No.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Could we in a -- oh. So\nthis doesn't apply just to capital cases, in your\nopinion?\nMR. WOLF: Not necessarily. But the -- in\nthe capital arena in Texas, we have the dual-track\nsystem, where you get an attorney appointed\nautomatically in a habeas setting, where, in a non-death\npenalty setting, there is a possibility of getting an\nattorney in the interest of justice, but it's not always\nguaranteed. And, in that case, the appeal is done in a\nsuccessive way, not in this dual-track way.\nAnd in -- in the death penalty arena, it\nmanifests -- it makes it even more manifestly obvious\nthat there is a systematic channeling by the State\nreferring these type of claims into habeas, while the\nState attorney, the district appeals attorney, focuses\non the record-based claim, and the habeas attorney is\ndealing with all of the case, not just the trial, but\nthe -- the appeal, to make sure that there was no\nineffectiveness on his part, that -- and also to do the\ninvestigation on the extra-record-based claims, which\ntakes a substantial amount of time.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, you -- you\nstarted to answer this question, but it is something\nraised by many of the amici opposing your position,\nwhich is that, by adopting your position, we're\nessentially having to examine the 49-plus -- because we\nhave territories that have collateral and direct review\nas well -- plus systems to see which apply -- to which\nMartinez applies and to which -- to which Martinez\ndoesn't apply.\nAnd so the question is: How do we write\nthis to sort of give enough guidance, so that we're not\nexamining each of the 49 -- or 49 systems -- or maybe\n48, after we've decided Martinez?\nMR. WOLF: Right. Well, I would suggest --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And -- and why should we\nnot fear that outcome?\nMR. WOLF: Okay. I would suggest the rule\nto be that Martinez applies when a State channels\nineffective assistance of counsel claims to State habeas\nand makes it impracticable in the vast majority of cases\nto raise the claim on direct appeal.\nAnd, in answer to your question about all of\nthe States, many of the States do make it -- do make\nhabeas available in the direct appeal arena. So it's --\nJUSTICE ALITO: So the reason why -- the\nreason why there was a movement to channel ineffective\nassistance of counsel claims to collateral review is\nthat it is often -- maybe in the great majority of\ncases -- impracticable to adjudicate them on direct\nappeal. So, under your standard, it seems to me that\ncovers every State.\nMR. WOLF: Well, it wouldn't, Justice Alito,\nfor this reason: Many States have a mechanism, unlike\nthe Texas scheme, which permits the expansion of the\nrecord. Some States, like Utah, who authored the amicus\nbrief, has a Rule 21.3, which permits the claimant to go\nback and expand the record. We don't have the -- that\nability in Texas.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, your friend\nsays, page 18 of his brief, that you do. He says,\n\"Under Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 21, direct\nappeal counsel can supplement the record with evidence\ndeveloped by investigators and experts, the ones that\nare appointed and paid for by the State on appeal.\"\nNow, is that just wrong?\nMR. WOLF: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.\nMR. WOLF: And the reason I say that is, in\norder to obtain a record, one, you need to -- when you\nfile your motion for new trial, you have to specifically\nset out the factual basis for the claim; and, two, the\naffidavit has to identify the evidence that any further\ninvestigation would have revealed.\nSo you've got that 30-day window when you\nfile that motion for new trial that you have to do all\nof those things, and that's not enough time.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So if everything -- if\neverything in Texas's system were the same, but you had\na year, would that flip Texas into a different category?\nMR. WOLF: If the --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Is the problem -- is what\nmakes this impracticable just the amount of time?\nMR. WOLF: Yes, because the time -- the\ntime -- especially in a Wiggins claim, is prohibitive in\norder to be able to prepare and -- not just the time\nthere, but the time that is imposed by the Rules of --\nof Appellate Procedure.\nThat 75-day window, in order to expand the\nrecord, is part of this whole system, that it's\nunderstood that the habeas claim is the -- the IAC claim\nis channelled into habeas.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, let me try this one\nmore time. You -- you seem to say, in your brief, that\nthe Kansas procedure and the -- the Michigan procedure\ntake those States outside of the Martinez category; is\nthat correct?\nMR. WOLF: Yes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: All right. Now, as I\nunderstand the procedure in those cases, it is the\nfollowing: On direct appeal, the attorney can make a\nmotion for a new trial based on ineffective assistance\nof counsel, and, if some threshold is met, the appellate\ncourt can remand the case to the trial court for a\nhearing on ineffective assistance.\nIs that correct?\nMR. WOLF: Yes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Okay. And that would -- in\nmost of those cases, the attorney on direct appeal is\ngoing to be the attorney who represented the defendant\nat trial and is probably not going to be in a very good\nposition to argue that he or she was ineffective at\ntrial, but that would still be okay?\nMR. WOLF: Well, but it's a --\nJUSTICE ALITO: And if you don't do that,\nyou've lost it.\nMR. WOLF: Well, there's a problem with\ndeclaring yourself ineffective. One, it's -- it's kind\nof counterintuitive. In Texas, if you declare yourself\nineffective, there's repercussions. You're no longer\navailable to -- you know, be taken off the list to get\nappointments on these type of claims.\nAnd -- and it's also against the Bar rules\nto -- to have that adverse interest against your client.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, if that is the\nsystem in Kansas and Michigan, then why -- why is it\noutside Martinez, if the point is you can't effectively\npresent the ineffective assistance counsel when you've\ngot the same counsel who was alleged to have been\nineffective and is not going to condemn himself?\nMR. WOLF: Well, that -- as far as their\nState -- you know, other States are concerned -- you\nknow, those are problems within those States. But as\nfar as Texas is concerned -- you know, we are in a\nsituation that we find ourselves in -- in a Martinez\nsituation, where there was no ability to -- to raise --\nthe system that we have prevents you from raising this\nclaim.\nAnd, as far as the other States are\nconcerned, some of the States have a more liberal\nopportunity to -- to expand the record, but that's not\nthe system that we have in Texas. And this --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Explain why the time that\nyou have on direct appeal isn't adequate. So you say\nyou need -- need to investigate. Well, some of the\nthings, like school records, his prison records, it\ndoesn't take a long time to get those, does it?\nMR. WOLF: Well, it -- it takes a while.\nI'm not going to say a long while, but releases are\nrequired. Sometimes, there's opposition to releasing\nthose records. But the biggest part of -- of this whole\nproblem is getting the record, is also, in our\nsituation, to have Mr. Trevino evaluated regarding\nhis -- there was never a psychological or sociological\nstudy done in his case, and to have a psychological eval\ndone, that doesn't happen in 30 days.\nAnd one -- you've got to get the records,\nand, in some of these situations, one record leads to\nanother record and finding one witness leads to another\nwitness. And, by the time you start developing all\nthese other avenues and when you put all that together,\nthen you're in a position to present that to an expert,\nin order to make that sort of evaluation.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, surely --\nsurely, the trial court in Texas, when it gets a new\ntrial motion within 30 days, and the new counsel on\nappeal says, well, I have reason to believe -- well, we\ncan see that there wasn't an adequate investigation of\nmitigating circumstances or whatever made below, and I\nwould like the time to conduct -- you know, the\npsychological evaluation or to contact these witnesses,\nis the trial court going to say no?\nMR. WOLF: That's correct because the\n30 days is -- is a limit; it's a bar. That's all he\nhas. And, in addition, the -- the direct appeal\nattorney has his own responsibilities. There's a\ndivision of labor that's here, that the direct appeal\nattorney is supposed to review the entire record, to\nlook for all of whatever errors that might be there.\nAnd while -- and that's why, in Texas, where\nyou have this dual-track system in order to expedite the\nappeal, there is a new attorney that's appointed to do\nthe habeas work.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And because of the rather\nsharp disagreements in the briefs on what the actual\nfacts are here, I looked at the brief filed by the State\nBar of Texas in support of neither party.\nCan you tell me -- and that they are\ncritical of having new counsel work simultaneously on a\nsimultaneous timeframe concurrently with the -- with the\nnew direct appeal counsel.\nCan you tell me how anything that's said in\nthe Texas Bar briefs helps your case?\nMR. WOLF: Well, it helps our case because\nit recognizes the dual-track system, and it recognizes\nthat the extra record under Section 12.22 of the\nguide -- of the Texas guidelines that -- that were\nformulated that the State Bar was -- one of their\ncommittees on indigent defense helped develop.\nThey recognize the fact that extra record\ninvestigation is the responsibility of the habeas\ncounsel.\nI would like to reserve the balance of my\ntime.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Oldham?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW S. OLDHAM\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. OLDHAM: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nTexas's procedures for raising\nineffectiveness claims are some of the most generous in\nthe country. Those procedures offered Petitioner two\nbites at the apple.\nThe first bite came in a constitutionally\nprotected direct appeal proceeding. And any deficiency\nin that proceeding would have been the source of cause\nunder existing cause and prejudice standards to excuse a\nsubsequent default.\nAllowing the Petitioner to assert cause on\nthe basis of a second bite at the apple -- that is, a\nState habeas proceeding -- would create an unwarranted\nand unworkable extension of Martinez.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why is it a second bite\nwhen the Texas Supreme Court -- court of criminal\nappeals, has said, again and again, as a general rule,\ndefendants should not raise ineffective assistance of\ntrial counsel on direct appeal, should raise it on\ncollateral review?\nMR. OLDHAM: Justice Ginsburg, the very next\nsentence of that opinion, Mata v. State, states that the\nlack of a clear record, usually, will prevent the\nappellant from meeting the first part of the Strickland\ntest as the reasonableness of counsel's choices and\nmotivations during trial can be proven deficient only\nthrough facts that don't normally appear in the\nappellate record.\nSo the only question presented by those\ninstructions that are quoted over and over again in the\nPetitioner's briefs is whether and to what extent\nnewly-appointed counsel -- as Justice Alito was pointing\nout, Texas provides newly-appointed counsel on direct\nappeal in capital cases -- can supplement the appellate\nrecord with an explanation from the trial -- trial\ncounsel.\nAnd where the new counsel gets an\nexplanation of the strategies of the trial counsel, the\nrecord is then complete --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't -- does the\nstatement \"defendants should not raise ineffective\nassistance of trial counsel on direct appeal\" doesn't\nmean what it says?\nMR. OLDHAM: Oh, yes, ma'am. It does mean\nthat. It's just that what -- what the Court is\nsaying -- the very next sentence following the ones that\nare quoted in the Petitioner's brief, says, \"The reason\nthat one should not raise an issue of ineffective\nassistance of counsel on direct appeal is because, in\ncases where there is no explanation from the trial\ncounsel, it will be impossible to adjudicate the first\nprong of the Strickland test.\"\nIt doesn't say that, as a general rule, you\nshould just never do it. It just says, if you are\nactually going to raise a claim of ineffective\nassistance, you should create the proper record before\nyou do it. And --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But then -- but the\ncomment is that the record has to be done within a very\nshort period of time, and the -- and the trial record\nisn't even available for -- the transcript, for some 7\nmonths.\nMR. OLDHAM: Yes, Justice Kennedy, and that\nis why Texas has a procedure for abating and remanding\nappeals that is materially identical to the one that\nKansas provides and the Petitioner concedes is\nsufficient to satisfy this Court's inquiry in Martinez.\nSo the way that the procedure in Texas would\nwork, as it does in Kansas, is that the newly appointed\ndirect appeal lawyer -- who has no conflict and is,\ntherefore, free to accuse trial counsel of being\nineffective -- would file a motion to stay the appeal,\nabate it, and remand it to the trial court.\nThe showing in both States is roughly the\nsame; it's a facially plausible claim of\nineffectiveness.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So the new counsel on\ndirect waits for 7 months, gets the transcript. In the\nmeantime, let's assume has made some investigation, and\nhe said -- and he tells the appellate court, we have\nsome very important material that we want to introduce\nand we need to supplement the record; please remand this\ncase.\nMR. OLDHAM: Yes, Your Honor. And one\npoint --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That -- that has never\nhappened in the State of Texas in a capital case, I take\nit?\nMR. OLDHAM: I'm not aware of a capital\ncase, but it has been done in many, many noncapital\ncases. And the Court of Criminal Appeals has\nspecifically blessed it, especially -- particularly in a\ncase involving a Wiggins type ineffective assistance of\ncounsel at punishment phase.\nThat is a case called Cooks v. State. It's\ncited on pages 32 and 34 of our brief.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And the Fifth Circuit was\nwrong, the circuit that ruled in favor of Texas, but\nsaid, in the Ibarra case, the Texas Court of Criminal\nAppeals has made it clear that State habeas petitions --\nand the State habeas petition is the preferred vehicle\nfor developing ineffective assistance claims?\nWas that wrong?\nMR. OLDHAM: I believe it just needs to be\ntaken in the context of -- it is the preferred vehicle\nif you have not developed the record to bring a claim --\nor to bring a claim appropriately on direct appeal.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you just please --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Oldham, I --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice Sotomayor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let me understand what\nyou are suggesting. Counsel doesn't have a record. He\nor she is newly appointed. Can they go into court and\nsay, I don't know if there is an ineffective assistance\nof counsel claim, but I need to protect my client and\nabate this hearing now, until I get the trial record,\nwhether it takes 6 months, 7 months, or a year.\nWhat will the court do with its rule that\nrequires counsel to provide affidavits setting forth the\ngood-faith basis for a claim?\nMR. OLDHAM: Well, Justice Sotomayor,\nmany -- many prisoners in Texas, in capital and\nnoncapital contexts alike, have done that within the\n30 days, but I want to emphasize --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How many were given an\nindefinite stay until they got the trial record to set\nforth the affidavits?\nMR. OLDHAM: Well, if it's done within the\nfirst 30 days, you don't need a stay, indefinite or\notherwise. You can just file --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what do you do with\nthe 75-day rule, which I think is absolute, which says,\nif the court hasn't ruled on the new trial within\n75 days, the matter ends?\nMR. OLDHAM: I think the easiest way to\nthink about it is there are basically three stages.\nThere is the first 30-day window, and, as I say, many\ncapital and noncapital prisoners have effectively\nbrought their claims in that 30-day window.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Some of them have the\ninformation, and some don't.\nMR. OLDHAM: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So --\nMR. OLDHAM: So that's the first box, but\nit's certainly not the last.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The guys who do it, it's\nbecause they have the information, and so they've\nexhausted their claim. But we are talking about the\npeople who don't.\nMR. OLDHAM: So to the second -- the second\nbox. After the new trial motion has been denied by an\noperation of law, you can make, effectively, a factual\nproffer of -- so the -- the trial court no longer has\njurisdiction to grant your motion, but you can make a\nfactual proffer of what you would have shown and what\nyou want to show to the court of appeals.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That assumes you get the\ntranscript.\nMR. OLDHAM: Well, we are still prior to the\ntranscript because this is still -- this is still --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, the 75 days has\npassed.\nMR. OLDHAM: And then, after that, there is\nno briefing that has been done in the appellate court at\nthis point because the appellate briefing schedule and\nthe transcript production are tied to one another, so it\nwould never be a case where you're actually litigating a\ndirect appeal without the transcript. You -- the latter\ndoesn't start until you get the former.\nAnd, at that point, you can make a motion to\nstay and abate to return to the district court and to\nsupplement the record with evidence of your trial\ncounsel's ineffectiveness.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even beyond the\n75 days?\nMR. OLDHAM: Yes, Your Honor. It\neffectively restarts the 30-day clock, so the -- the old\n75 days is obviously gone, and you get a new 35 days on\nthe stay and abate motion. So, in that sense, it's\nmaterially identical to the procedure that Kansas\napplies, although, as I mentioned earlier, in capital\ncases, the State of Texas guarantees its prisoners a new\nconflict-free lawyer, who can help with that proceeding.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So he can do this -- I\ndidn't understand this. I'm sorry.\nJoe Smith is convicted on day 1. The\ntranscript appears 9 months later. Okay? 9 months\nlater his new lawyer, who is supposed to proceed on\nappeal, reads the transcript. He thinks, hmm, I think\nthere was a problem with his lawyer at the trial, and I\nwould like to raise this claim and get a new trial.\nAnd you are saying what he does is he goes\nback to the trial court, and he says, Judge, I just read\nthis, it raises some factual matters; will you please\ngive me an evidentiary hearing with the old lawyer there\nand me there, so we can develop this?\nNow, that is what -- how Texas works?\nMR. OLDHAM: Your --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because I did not get that\nimpression from the State Bar brief, but you are saying\nthat is how it works?\nMR. OLDHAM: Almost exactly, except that you\ngo to -- you go to the court of appeals and --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You go to the court of\nappeals, and what do you say? You say, court of\nappeals, will you please direct the trial court to have\nan evidentiary hearing on the adequacy of trial counsel\nbefore you hear the appeal?\nMR. OLDHAM: You ask for --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is that yes or no?\nMR. OLDHAM: Yes, although it's called a new\ntrial motion.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Even if you haven't made\nthe new trial motion within the 30 days, initially?\nMR. OLDHAM: That's right. This is the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So you are just\nsaying that they are all wrong about how Texas works, so\nI guess you -- you could refer to a case where that\nhappened.\nMR. OLDHAM: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, in what case did that\nhappen?\nMR. OLDHAM: It's called Cooks vs. State.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Cooks vs. State. And they\ngot the transcript, months later, and they looked back,\nand they said, oh, dear, there was something wrong with\nthe trial performance. So we go to the Federal\nappeals -- the State appeals court, and we say, State\nappeals court, please direct an evidentiary hearing.\nAnd they directed an evidentiary hearing,\nand they had an evidentiary hearing before the trial\njudge -- really, what would have happened on State\nhabeas?\nMR. OLDHAM: Except that they didn't get\nactually get the evidentiary hearing in Cooks because\nthere was no facially plausible showing of the claim\nthat they would have raised. But --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, I am\npuzzled about what I'm supposed to do because I would\nhave thought that the standard's fairly easy, that this\nindividual must always have one full and fair\nopportunity to present his claim of inadequate\nassistance at trial.\nThere are certain things that could deprive\nhim of that. One, his lawyer in the habeas State could\nbe incompetent -- all these lawyers could be\nincompetent. Or the State, at a certain stage, didn't\ngive him enough proceeding. All right?\nWell, what do I do, where people are\ndisagreeing about how the State procedure works, as to\nwhether it was full and fair? What do I do? What is\nyour suggestion?\nBy the way, if he doesn't get the full and\nfair, he still has to show to the Federal habeas judge\nthat he has a substantial claim, that that trial was\nnot -- so what do you suggest?\nMR. OLDHAM: Well, Your Honor, where he\ndoesn't get a full and fair opportunity, whether it's\nbecause his new lawyer is ineffective, his old lawyer\nwas ineffective, the transcript wasn't available, the\nvery case that we're talking about, the Cooks case,\nrecognizes that that is a violation of the United States\nConstitution.\nAnd you have -- that prisoner would have a\nconstitutional claim to assert for the failure of his\ncounsel, the failure of the circumstances --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Right now -- but I'm saying\nwhat I would like you to sympathize with my problem. My\nproblem is I have seen -- I have a bunch of briefs. And\nthey seem to me that what you have just described is a\nfull and fair procedure to develop all these evidentiary\nmatters before the appeal even takes place.\nIt exists in Texas, and, therefore, unless\nhe could say his lawyer there was incompetent, he's out\nof luck. Okay? The other side seems to say, no, it\ndoesn't exist in Texas. And, now, what am I supposed to\ndo, since I am not an expert on Texas procedure?\nMR. OLDHAM: Well, Your Honor, I think you\ncould do one of two things. You could always certify\nthe question with the Court of Criminal Appeals if you\nthought that the question -- that the answer turns on\nwhat the Texas procedures are and that the parties\ndisagree with them.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I tried that once in a case\ninvolving Pennsylvania, and the result was such that I\nresolved never to do it again.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: But -- but don't say never.\nAll right. So one thing we got --\nJUSTICE ALITO: That was a case in which --\nthat was the case in which the Court unwisely reversed a\ncertain Third Circuit decision.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do we have a clue,\nMr. Oldham, if the information is correct, that direct\nappeal counsel in the county involved here gets a very\nlimited amount of money -- gets, they said it's $1,500\nfixed fee.\nBut, if counsel who's appointed as\ncollateral review gets $25,000, doesn't that suggest\nthat the -- that the counsel on direct appeal is\nexpected to deal with trial errors and the one that gets\nall this $25,000 can go out and find a psychologist, a\nsociologist, whoever is going to give us a profile on\nthis person?\nMR. OLDHAM: No, Your Honor. And that is\nbecause the funding thresholds that are cited for the\nfirst time in the reply brief are wrong in two respects.\nOne is those -- those only came into effect after the\nfiling of the State habeas and after the filing of the\ndirect appeal in this case.\nBut the second -- and perhaps I think more\nrelevant sense in which they're wrong, is it does apply\nto the amount of money that are given to the lawyers;\nwhereas the subsection (l) provision that we've cited in\nour brief applies to the money for investigators and\nexperts.\nIt's reimbursement for investigators and\nexperts. It's not the amount of money they give to the\nlawyer.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it true that it's the\ncounty that reimburses the direct appeal counsel and the\nState reimburses the habeas counsel?\nMR. OLDHAM: Yes, Your Honor, after 1999.\nBut the State habeas application in this case was filed\na month before that statute went into effect.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but you -- you say\nit's before, but this -- this indicates how Texas views\nits system. And, as Justice Ginsburg indicates, Texas\nviews this system as being one in which the collateral\nappeal -- or the collateral proceeding counsel is in the\nbest position to raise IAC claims.\nThat's -- that's just where it is. And\nthe -- the State Bar says -- agrees with the\nRespondent -- pardon me -- with the Petitioner on this\npoint.\nMR. OLDHAM: Justice Kennedy, the court of\ncriminal appeals has said that the -- that claims of\nineffective assistance of trial counsel properly can be\nbrought on direct appeal.\nThe Texas State legislature has said it by\nauthorizing a new direct appeal attorney and stating,\nthroughout the legislative history -- and I think in the\ntext and structure of the statute -- that they intend\nfor these claims to be able to be brought on direct\nappeal -- not that they are channeled on direct appeal;\nthey're not channelled either way.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, able -- able to be\nbrought, Mr. Oldham, but, as Justice Ginsburg started\noff by saying, many times, the court of criminal appeals\nhas said the preferred method is to bring it on\ncollateral appeal.\nAnd, more to the point even, when attorneys\ntry to bring these kinds of claims on a motion for a new\ntrial, the typical response is to say, no, this is not\nthe proper venue for that, go back and do it again on\ncollateral review.\nSo we have -- you say that there's a formal\nmechanism that could be used. But it seems as though\nthe courts and the lawyers, both, in Texas, are being\ntold continually, don't use that form of mechanism;\ninstead, do this on collateral review.\nMR. OLDHAM: Justice Kagan, I am aware of no\ncase where someone's brought a new trial motion that --\nin the procedurally proper way -- and been told not to\ndo it that way. I think what we --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, isn't the usual\nresponse just to dismiss it without prejudice and to\nsay, we don't have time to deal with this, go away, come\nback again on collateral review?\nMR. OLDHAM: No, Your Honor. That's --\nthat's the usual response when the record is\ninsufficient. That is, when you haven't -- you haven't\ngiven your trial lawyer --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, because, mostly, the\nrecord isn't sufficient for a Wiggins claim. So anytime\nsomebody brings a Wiggins claim on this 30-day window,\nthe Court says -- you know, there's only 30 days, the\nrecord is insufficient. Go away, do it again.\nMR. OLDHAM: Your Honor, that's not what\nhappened in the Armstrong case, where someone brought a\nWiggins -- it's not what happened in the --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: That's your one case, it\nseems to me. You only have one case. It's Armstrong.\nArmstrong seems to me sort of like proof as to why it is\nthat the Texas courts don't do that generally because\nwhat they did in Armstrong was they ended up trying to\nadjudicate that on the merits and realizing that there\nwas -- that the record wasn't sufficient.\nMR. OLDHAM: Your Honor, it's -- it's not\nthe only case -- you know, we have -- a similar claim\nwas raised in the Motley case, which was cited in our\nbrief. It was also raised in a Rosales case, also cited\nin our brief. Similar to Wiggins kinds of cases.\nAnd then -- in the Motley case, they were\nable to have school teachers testify. There was a\nneurological examination done. I mean, it's certainly a\npractical way to do it, and it -- it is as generous or\nmore generous than a lot of the States in the country,\nincluding States that Petitioner concedes are --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Do you agree, Mr. Oldham,\nthat, if you didn't have the mechanism for a new trial,\nthen you would form under the Martinez rule?\nMR. OLDHAM: With no new trial and no\nstanding abatement?\nJUSTICE KAGAN: In other words, no\nopportunity for factual development.\nMR. OLDHAM: If there was no opportunity to\ndevelop -- to develop the facts and there was\npractically no opportunity to -- to raise the claim on\ndirect appeal, I think the question would still turn on\nwhether and to what extent there was a constitutional\nright to have an effective appeal of that issue.\nAnd the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has\nafforded constitutional protection to that new trial\nwindow and to the meaningfulness of the record necessary\nto raise these claims on direct appeal. And I think\nthat is what is sufficient to move this case out of the\nMartinez box and into the normal cause and prejudice\nstandards that this Court applies --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I -- can I go back\nto what you are proposing, okay, and what you are saying\nthis system stands for? If an ineffective assistance of\ncounsel claim is brought on direct appeal, with or\nwithout a record -- or it says, we don't have a record,\nit throws it into collateral review, as I have seen it\ndo dozens of times -- are you saying, in that situation,\nthat Martinez applies?\nCounsel raised it, but was told, we're not\ngoing to decide it. Puts them into collateral review.\nDoes Martinez apply there?\nMR. OLDHAM: If it happened in every single\ncase and there was no opportunity --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, forget it -- that --\nwhen it happens?\nMR. OLDHAM: Oh, no, Your Honor. I don't\nbelieve that Martinez would apply in that circumstance.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Okay. So they haven't\ngotten a full and fair opportunity because they\npresented their case, but Texas has said, we don't want\nto do it here, do it there. You are still saying\nMartinez doesn't apply?\nMR. OLDHAM: Precisely, because there is no\ndefault upon which to apply Martinez, so there's\nnothing -- there is no work for Martinez to do in that\nhypothetical, precisely because the claim can be met --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So because it can, but\nTexas chose not to, now there's no protection, there is\nno full and fair opportunity for the petitioner to have\nhad that claim adjudicated?\nThat's really the end result of what you're\nsaying.\nMR. OLDHAM: Well, I'm certainly not\nsuggesting that the rule needs to turn on the\nmeaningfulness of the opportunity to raise it on direct\nappeal. I think that Martinez was very clear when it\nsaid -- whether it's a complete --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You raised it, and the\nState said, well, go to collateral review. You're\nsaying, no -- no Martinez protection?\nMR. OLDHAM: Well, I don't --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The counsel was\nineffective in habeas in that -- in State habeas, you --\nyou can do nothing about it.\nMR. OLDHAM: Well, you don't -- there's\nnothing to do in the sense that, in that very\nhypothetical, that very claim could be raised in habeas\nthe first time, but it also could be --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There's clearly no Martinez\nprotection. The question you are being asked, I think,\nboils down to whether we should develop a new case,\nMartinez plus, in which -- even though there is,\ntechnically, the ability to raise it, which is all that\nMartinez spoke about, the mere fact that the ability to\nraise it is not effective enough should produce the same\nresult that Martinez produced.\nI don't think there is any -- I'm not even\nsure the other side claims that Martinez said what --\nwhat he is arguing here.\nMR. OLDHAM: I think that's exactly right,\nJustice Scalia, and, in the hypothetical that Justice\nSotomayor was asking, the court's ordinary cause and\nprejudice standards would accommodate for that. There\nwould be no inequity for the court -- for Martinez to do\nanything.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What happens -- imagine we\nhave a State supreme court, and it says, okay, you could\nraise this claim on appeal, we don't advise it, we\nthink -- it's so much easier to do it in State habeas.\nPlease do it in State habeas. It's not absolutely\nbinding, but do it. Okay? That's what they are saying.\nNow, he raises nine of his ten ineffective\nassistance of counsel claims in State habeas. And the\nState habeas court says, no, you are out on all nine,\nbut he never raised the tenth.\nNow, we are in Federal court, and the\nprisoner says -- you know, that tenth claim is fabulous.\nAnd the judge says, it is substantial. And he says, you\nknow why it wasn't raised before? Because my counsel\nwas incompetent on State habeas, and they didn't raise\nit on appeal because that's just how people normally do\nthings in Texas, they don't raise it on appeal. They\nwait until State habeas.\nHas that person had a full and fair\nopportunity to raise this tenth claim in the State\ncourt?\nMR. OLDHAM: Well, if the -- if the Court by\nhypothesis is telling the Bar not to bring claims under\nany set of circumstances on direct appeal, I think\nthat --\nJUSTICE BREYER: They are not saying never.\nThey are just saying it works so much better. What they\nsay is we appoint State habeas counsel at the same time,\nit's easier to develop it. Please. We won't say never.\nWe'll just say hardly ever.\nNow, what's -- what is the -- what is your\nview about whether that person has had a full and fair\nopportunity to develop his tenth ineffective assistance\nclaim in the State courts.\nMR. OLDHAM: Justice Breyer, Martinez should\nnot apply, even to that hypothetical.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm not even thinking about\nMartinez at the moment because I don't want to get into\nwhether it is an extension or just an elaboration or\njust a situation covered, but they didn't think of it or\njust a lot of other things.\nI just want to know, given Martinez, what do\nyou think?\nMR. OLDHAM: I'm not sure how to answer the\nfull and fair opportunity question because that --\nthat's certainly not the standard that we are advocating\nhere.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is the standard you\nare advocating?\nMR. OLDHAM: We believe that Martinez\napplies where it said that it applies, and that is where\na State makes a deliberate choice to disallow all claims\non direct appeal. We understand the necessity to having\na Martinez clause to apply to an eventual default.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But if, in fact, they say,\nyes, there is a route, never used, but once, filled with\nminefields, very hard when compared with the other one,\nthere you say, it isn't Martinez, it is a totally -- it\nis a new thing because Martinez, after all, had no\nrationale.\nMR. OLDHAM: Your Honor, I think --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm being sarcastic there,\nbut I don't mean to be. I mean, you see what I'm trying\nto get to?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It was the nose of the\ncamel, which is what Martinez was -- which is what the\ndissent said, actually.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, the dissent said that.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: This is -- this is very\namusing in a capital case.\nLet me ask you this question: Is there\nanything in the State Bar brief that substantially helps\nyour position? I'm -- I'm very interested in the State\nBar brief. It's a little hard for me to parse. It did\nsay there is a conflict of interest in -- between the\nhabeas counsel and the -- and the counsel on direct.\nAnd it also -- it also indicates that the\nhabeas counsel has to file the application in the\nconvicting court not later than 180 days after -- or not\nlater than 45 days after the State's original brief,\nwhich seems to help the Petitioner here because the\noriginal brief in -- in the direct appeal proceeding is\ndeemed important for the habeas counsel.\nMR. OLDHAM: Justice Kennedy, I don't think\nthere is anything in the State Bar brief that helps\neither side in this sense because the State Bar agrees\nthat there were no relevant guidelines of any kind at\nthe time of any of the proceedings in this case.\nThe only guideline that any Bar association\nhad promulgated at the time of the direct appeal\nproceeding or State habeas proceeding in this case was\nthe 1989 American Bar Association guideline, 11.9.2,\nwhich specifically told the direct appeal lawyer in this\ncase to raise every colorable claim he could, regardless\nof any State procedures to the contrary.\nAnd, if he had raised a substantial Wiggins\nclaim or if he had even tried his best to raise a\nWiggins claim that could be -- could be amplified and\nfurther developed on State habeas, we wouldn't be\nstanding here today because it would have been properly\nexhausted and adjudicated on the merits in State court.\nSo I don't think that the Bar association\nreally has anything one way to say or the other, which\nis maybe why it filed on behalf of neither party.\nBut to return to Justice Breyer's question,\nI don't think that what -- what we're talking about is\nto come up with anything new. I think what we're\ntalking about in this outside-of-Martinez world is\nactually very old. We are just talking about the\nCarrier rule, the normal rule that applies to cause and\nprejudice for all defaults in States across the country.\nAnd I think that the best way to understand\nit is to imagine, in the very hypothetical that you\noffered, where there is just one person who could get\nthrough, that person would have a constitutional claim\nin the State of -- I'm sorry, the other 900 or however\nmany there were, those people would have constitutional\nclaims in the State of Texas for the deprivation of a\nmeaningful opportunity to press their claims on direct\nappeal.\nAnd as from the Federal -- and that would\nserve as cause, if the State courts denied it, that\nwould serve as cause to overcome a default in Federal\ncourt and to get an adjudication of that claim.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Oldham, I had thought\nthat Martinez was really an equitable rule. It was an\nequitable rule about giving people an opportunity to\nraise a trial ineffectiveness claim.\nAnd if it's true that, although Texas has a\ntechnical possibility of doing that outside of\ncollateral review, but, in fact, that the lawyers are\ntold not to use that route, that the lawyers don't use\nthat route, that, if they do use that route, the\nlikelihood is that they will be thrown out for using\nthat route, the question is why that -- the formal\navailability of a mechanism that nobody uses and that\neverybody is told not to use should matter with respect\nto the application of an equitable rule like Martinez?\nMR. OLDHAM: Justice Kagan, there is no work\nfor an equitable rule in Martinez to do if you can get\nthere another way. And it's not just that you can raise\nit on direct appeal, it's also that, if your direct\nappeal lawyer doesn't do it, you can, under certain\ncircumstances, establish cause against your direct\nappeal -- direct appeal lawyer to overcome an ensuing\ndefault.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Has there ever been such\na case, any case in which a direct appeal counsel has\nbeen found ineffective for failing to present a Wiggins\nclaim?\nMR. OLDHAM: I'm not sure about specifically\nWiggins claims, but, yes, it is, in fact, established in\nthe leading treatise on Texas practice cited by both\nsides that is ineffective assistance of appellate\ncounsel to fail to develop the record to allow any claim\nto be adjudicated on direct appeal.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But I asked, if there was\nany decisions that said, you should have raised it on\nappeal, appeals counsel didn't rely on the advice of the\nTexas Court of Criminal Appeals, and, therefore, because\ncounsel followed the advice of Texas Court of Criminal\nAppeals, she was ineffective?\nMR. OLDHAM: No, Justice -- Justice\nGinsburg, I am not aware of any particular case on\nWiggins in particular. But -- but the claims against\nappellate ineffectiveness for failure to raise a claim\non direct appeal are -- are raised and adjudicated on\nthe merits all the time in Texas courts.\nAnd there are specific ones that say that\nineffective assistance of appellate counsel to fail to\ndevelop the record using the procedures which the State\nhas allowed through the new trial window.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the -- the Texas\nCourt of Criminal Appeals, in addition to saying, as a\ngeneral rule, bring it up on -- on collateral review,\nsaid -- and there's a reason. The reason why is the\nundeveloped record on direct appeal would be\ninsufficient to establish claims that must be supported\nby extra-record evidence.\nSo that seems to be an expectation that\nextra-record evidence will be developed on collateral\nreview, not direct appeal.\nMR. OLDHAM: No, Justice Ginsburg, I think\nit's an expectation that the extra-record evidence will\nbe developed, either through the new trial proceeding,\nthrough a factual proffer following it, or through a\nstay and abatement procedure, to make sure that, when\nthe claim actually gets to the court -- the court of\nappeals, that it has a record upon which to adjudicate\nthe claim.\nThat's all that -- and, to the extent that\nthe appellate lawyer fails to do that, that can\nconstitute cause under the ordinary rules of cause and\nprejudice without creating another Martinez exception,\nwhich we would submit is going to be highly, highly\nunworkable, given that the court is going to have to\ndetermine when is a little bit enough and when is not\nenough sufficient for Martinez.\nJUSTICE ALITO: The Respondent says that the\nKansas and the Michigan procedures are sufficient to\ntake the case -- to take the States outside of Martinez.\nYou say your stay and abate proceeding is the same,\nessentially, as those procedures.\nHis response is that Texas has used this\nremedy in only one situation, and that is when a\ndefendant is deprived of counsel during the new trial\nwindow and suffers prejudice from the deprivation.\nNow, is that correct.\nMR. OLDHAM: It's when the counsel -- when\nthe prisoner has suffered a deprivation of the\nopportunity to develop the record in the new trial\nwindow. So, in the Cooks case, for example, that was --\nthere was only a lawyer for 10 of the 30 days, and\nthis -- the court said the new trial window is a\ncritical stage for the development of a particular\nrecord for raising a Wiggins-style claim on direct\nappeal, and because that is so --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Finish your\nsentence.\nMR. OLDHAM: Thank you.\nAnd because that is so, where there has been\na deprivation of counsel in that circumstance that\nprohibits the development of that meaningful record, we\nwill allow you to go back, assuming you can show\nprejudice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Wolf, you have seven minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WARREN A. WOLF\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. WOLF: I want to be very clear about\nthis abatement issue. The abatement issue, as\nJustice Alito just said, is only available -- as\nreferred in our brief on page 6, is only available when\nthere is a denial of the constitutional right to an\nattorney.\nAnd those situations is when there's a delay\nin appointing the direct appeal attorney after the\ntrial. So, during the 30-day window to file the motion\nfor new trial, that time limitation is -- is -- that\nclock is running, and, if there's no attorney appointed,\nthe constitutional violation is considered a critical\nstage of the trial.\nAnd since there's -- if there's no attorney\nappointed during those 30 days, that is the only time,\nas Justice Kennedy is correct in saying, that that is\nthe time that the abatement procedure is permitted.\nThat is the only time.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So you are suggesting that\nif -- if an attorney is appointed within a few days or\nwithin a week, as happened here, that, in that case,\nthere would not be that opportunity, it would be the\n30 days, that's it, stop?\nMR. WOLF: And when that new -- that's\ncorrect. And, if a new attorney is appointed because\nthere was no attorney appointed, that new attorney, he,\nhimself, also has only 30 days. The clock starts --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But what about -- what\nabout the 75-day --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice Kennedy.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I understood that, if the\n30-day rule had been complied with, within the 75 days,\nyou can ask the appellate court to please remand because\nthere is some additional evidence to be --\nMR. WOLF: That's not true.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- to be determined.\nMR. WOLF: That is not a correct statement\nof the law, and -- and I would refer the Court to our\nbriefs, to the -- to the time that the -- the\nauthorities that we cite and also the amicus brief from\nthe State Bar of Texas.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what are --\nwhat are these investigators, experts, they're available\nto the new appellate counsel, what -- what are they\nsupposed to be doing?\nMR. WOLF: To the direct appeal attorney?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, the direct\nappeal attorney. You say -- basically, you're saying\nthere's no way they can do anything within these time\nlimits, and, yet, the State procedure provides for\ninvestigators and experts. It seems to me it would be\nodd for them to provide for people and to pay for people\nwho can't do anything.\nMR. WOLF: Well, they don't -- to do a\nWiggins claim -- to do -- they're doing things that\nwould -- investigates things that came out of the\nrecord because that's what is relegated to the direct\nappeal. The habeas attorney has more money available\nand has more time available to do the things, and it\nbecomes a function of time as well.\nBut I want to direct the Court's attention\nalso to the -- to the statement in Sprouse. And -- and\nthe statement --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The statement?\nMR. WOLF: In the case of Sprouse, in our --\nwhere am I?\nIt's page 20 -- 20 of our reply brief, that\nthe position in Sprouse is that there would be no\nconstitutional defect if appellate counsel didn't have\ntime or the record to raise the ineffective assistance\nclaim, and that's because the habeas proceeding is\navailable to direct -- to develop the claim and is the\nproper place to do so. And that's the State's brief.\nIt's on page 20 of our reply brief.\nThe other thing that I wanted to -- to bring\nto the Court's attention is that the Respondent cites a\ncouple of cases that are aberrant -- they're\naberrations, and they really don't -- shouldn't -- since\nthis Court has -- has brought out a sensible rule in\nMartinez and this Court has said this Court's rule\nsensibly speak to the ordinary case, not -- not the\naberrational. And that's exactly what we have here.\nThe last thing that I wanted to say is -- is\nthat the direct appeal, if -- if -- there's a choice\nhere that the State has systemically developed a system\nthat has caused -- that has directed attorneys on appeal\nthat the habeas attorney does the extra-record claims,\nthe Wiggins-type claims, and that the -- the claims that\nare raised on the record go to the direct appeal\nattorney.\nThat is the system that the State has\ndeveloped. Those are the rules that govern this system\nthat have been promulgated by the court of criminal\nappeals and the Supreme Court, and that's the system --\nthe scheme that we are under.\nAnd because --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the position\nof the State that says Martinez is relatively new, if\nthere is an extension of Martinez to cover this case,\nthen at least give the Texas courts the first crack at\ndeciding whether there was ineffective assistance of\ncounsel, instead of having that done in the Federal\ncourt?\nMR. WOLF: We're just looking for the --\nbecause of the procedural default scenario that we find\nourselves in, we tried to do that.\nAnd -- and because 11.071 also has -- when\nthey -- when that was promulgated in 1995 in order to\nexpedite these claims, it provided three things: One, a\nnew attorney; two, the money to fund those claims; and,\nthree, an abuse of the writ, which is Section 5a, which\nis what we met in -- in our case.\nThe Texas scheme, because of that abuse of\nthe writ, proceeds -- causes procedural default, and\nthat puts us in this quandary, where a person like\nMr. Trevino is unable to get relief because he has an\nineffective trial lawyer. And, now, he is -- that\nineffective trial lawyer -- his ineffectiveness is being\ninsulated by the ineffectiveness of his -- of his habeas\nlawyer.\nAnd that's not what should happen. It's --\nit's just not equitable, it's not fair. And\nMr. Trevino, someone in his situation, should have a\nright to complain about the ineffectiveness of his trial\nlawyer.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
