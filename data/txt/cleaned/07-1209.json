MILLER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. MILLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court.\nCongress has directed the Veterans Court to\ntake due account of the rule of prejudicial error in\nreviewing administrative determinations of veterans\nbenefits. For four reasons, the court of appeals erred\nin holding that the Veterans Court should presume the\nexistence of prejudice whenever it finds that the VA has\nerred in providing notice to the claimant.\nFirst, section 7261, the Veterans Court\nprejudicial errors statute, is in language that is\nessentially identical to that of the APA's prejudicial\nerror provision. And when Congress adopted that\nlanguage in 1988, it was understood to place upon the\nparty challenging an agency's action the burden of\nshowing that any error was prejudicial.\nSecond, a notice error of the kind at issue\nhere does not --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why do you say that? That\nit was understood so? Because of the Attorney General's\ncommentary on that?\nMR. MILLER: The principal reason that it\nwas understood is because the uniform practice in the\ncourts of appeals as of 1988 was to place upon\nchallengers to agency action the burden of showing\nprejudice from the error. And the Congress was well\naware of that, and in particular the Senate Veterans\nAffairs Committee was cited in the Ninth Circuit's\ndecision in Seine & Line Fishermen's Union.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You basically have\nfour cases in the courts of appeals to support that\nproposition, right?\nMR. MILLER: Well, Your Honor, it's\nconsiderably more than that. And the only cases that\ncould even suggest any support to the contrary rule are\nin the very different context of notice and comment\nrulemaking under section 553.\nAnd the reason that that's different is\nreally for two reasons. That is that the -- the\ninterest that section 553 is intended to protect is not\nthe interest of any particular commenter or particular\noutcome of the rulemaking. It's the interest of the\npublic in having the agency's decisionmaking fully\ninformed by all of the relevant comments.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but this is --\nI mean, it's kind of the -- it's the first notice. It\ngets the ball rolling. I think it's like, you know, two\nteams and you don't tell one of the teams when the game\nstarts and then you say, well, it doesn't matter because\nthey would have lost anyway, there is no prejudice.\nMR. MILLER: The reason that in a great many\ncases there is not going to be prejudicial error of the\nkind at issue here is that the VA has an informal\nnon-adversarial system and many opportunities to correct\nthe effect of any official notice error. That is\nillustrated by the history of the cases. To take the\nMs. Simmons's case, for example --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Can we go back to the\nquestion that was just posed? We have never held that\nevery agency -- agencies come in many sizes and shapes,\nbut in all cases, the APA places the burden on the -- on\nthe petitioner. But this Court has never held that\nacross the board, no matter what agency we are talking\nabout, that's the rule.\nMR. MILLER: That's correct. This Court has\nnot held that. But Congress was aware that the uniform\npractice, certainly in agency adjudications in the\ncourts of appeals, was to place the burden on the\nchallenger, and Congress --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Was Congress aware of this\nwhen the Administrative Procedure Act was passed, you\nmean?\nMR. MILLER: No, the statute at issue here\nis the Veterans Judicial Review Act of 1988. So the\nrelevant time we are looking at what the practice was is\nas of 1988 when Congress incorporated the language from\nthe APA and placed it into section 7261. And as of\n1988, it was clear that the burden was on the\nchallengers.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Can I ask you to clarify\nexactly what you mean by the \"burden\" of showing\nprejudice? Is it correct that neither of the following\n-- to borrow the terminology that you would use in\nformal litigation, and I understand this is not formal\nlitigation before an agency, but to borrow that\nterminology, is it correct that the issue here doesn't\nconcern either the burden of production or the risk of\nnonpersuasion before the administrative agency? Before\nthe regional office? In other words, if there's -- if\nthere is evidence that the veteran as opposed to the VA\nhas to produce, that doesn't change, and whatever the\nstandard is that has to be met to show an entitlement to\nbenefits, that doesn't change either, so that all that's\ninvolved here is whether -- whatever showing needs to be\nmade is to be made on appeal or on remand?\nMR. MILLER: That's correct. If we are\ntalking about what showing needs to be made on appeal.\nAnd as this Court suggested in O'Neal, you know, the\nburden language is perhaps more appropriate for the\ncontext where there's people presenting competing\nevidentiary submissions to a factfinder and that's not\nwhat we have here.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's in O'Neal. It says\nthat, but most of the court joined and the reason it\nsays it is it just confuses everybody, at least me, to\ntalk about \"burden\" in this context. I think if O'Neal\nis right, it says what this is, is not involving a jury,\nnot involving -- it's just what Justice Alito says, and\nfollowing that, what you have, you say to the judge,\n\"Judge, your job is to decide this. Decide. Decide\nwhether you think that the one side -- whether there is\nerror or whether the error is harmless or whether it\nisn't. Decide it.\"\nNow, it could be in a rare instance the\njudge just can't decide. He's in grave doubt. And so\nwhat we are talking about is what to do in that -- what\nshould be a very, very rare instance.\nNow, when I read this case, I thought the\nVeterans Affairs is absolutely common sense on this. It\nsays, well, when you really don't know what to do,\nJudge, if the veteran got no notice at all, then\nprobably the error was harmful. But if he got the basic\nnotice, and all that's at issue is who should produce\nwhat or whether he thinks that he didn't know that he's\nsupposed to produce a lot of information, well, there,\nit would be pretty rare that it was harmful. So then\nyou'd better say to him, veteran, why did this hurt you?\nThat's all common sense, and it seemed to me\nthat that's what the Veterans Court was saying and then\nthe Federal Circuit unfortunately, like I might have\ndone, too, got it all mixed up with this burden of proof\nlanguage. Now, you tell me, legally is that result\nwhich I am talking about sensible, and if so, how do I\nget there legally?\nMR. MILLER: Justice Breyer, the reason that\nwe have used the language of \"burden\" --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm not criticizing you for\nthat. I'm not -- it's not a criticism. I'm just really\ntrying to figure out to get to what I see as common\nsense legally.\nMR. MILLER: The point that we are trying to\nemphasize is that, in the ordinary course the Veterans\nCourt, like any court, is going to act on the basis of\narguments that are presented to it by the parties. So\nwhen you speak of the \"burden,\" you mean the challenger\nhas the obligation, if it wants the Veterans Court to\nfind prejudice -- to articulate some theory of how there\nwas prejudice. And that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The theory is he didn't\nknow anything about this, got no notice whatsoever, so\nhe didn't know that he's supposed to produce more\ninformation or he'll lose. That's the theory.\nMR. MILLER: But in order to -- in order to\nconnect that error -- I mean, that's an identification\nof an error under the Veterans Claims Assistance Act.\nBut if you connect error --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But if you connect it by\nsaying normally a veteran who isn't that knowledgeable\n-- not everybody is a genius in law -- when he doesn't\nget a notice that tells him you got to produce something\nmore or you lose, he might forget to produce something\nmore. That's the theory.\nMR. MILLER: If he has something more. And\nwhat we are saying is that in order to get a remand, the\nclaimant, by the time they get to the Veterans Court,\nhas already identified the error, has made an argument\nto explain to the court that there was in fact an error,\nat that point they ought to explain how the error\naffected them. If it prevented them from put in a piece\nof evidence, they ought to tell the court, \"Here's the\npiece of evidence that I want to put in.\"\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, usually, when\nyou have an appellate court, with a hard question, is\neasily divided, the case is resolved on the basis of the\nstandard of review. What is the presumption, if it's a\nclose case? And why isn't that all sort of what we are\ntalking about here? It's a close case, and the judge --\nthe panel says, well, this side has the burden of\npersuasion, so we're going to come out the other way.\nMR. MILLER: Because I think in a case where\nthe -- like these, where plaintiff has not identified\nanything that they would have done differently, it isn't\na close case with respect to the question.\nNow, we have to be clear: If a claimant can\narticulate something they would have done differently,\nwe are not saying they have the obligation of showing\nthat the outcome definitely would have been different or\nmore likely than not, it would have been different. It\nwould be sufficient to identify what they would have\ndone differently.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what if what\nthey would have done differently is get different\nmedical tests, or done something like that, or have the\ndoctor in the prior testing who prepared the diagnosis\nlook at something that they didn't have them look at\nbefore? In other words, it's not simply the absence of\ndocuments that they know they can submit or could have\nsubmitted. It's that type of question where nobody\nknows. I mean, you don't know what would have happened\nif they had the doctor look at the issue that now turns\nout to be critical, but if they had gotten the right\nnotice they might have had time to do that.\nMR. MILLER: Well, depending on the state of\nthe record in a particular case, that might be\nsufficient to show a reasonable probability that the\noutcome would have been different. But in a lot of\ncases it won't be, and I think Simmons's case is a good\nexample of that.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But if the government has\nthe obligation at the very first to tell the veteran\nwhat the veteran must produce to substantiate the claim\nand the government doesn't do that, why shouldn't it be\nthe responsibility of the government to say to the\ncourt, \"this is what, if we had done what we were\nsupposed to do, this is what we would have included in\nour notice.\" And looking at that, the court can tell\nwhether there's anything the veteran might have done.\nBut why shouldn't the government at least have the\nobligation to say what it would have done had it\ncomplied with the statute, what it would have said\nspecifically in this case?\nMR. MILLER: Well, I mean, how does the\ngovernment comply, to take Simmons's case as an example,\nwhen the VA sent her the notice letter, her claim was\nfor an increased rating. She had a hearing loss that\nhad already been determined to be service-connected, but\nwas not sufficiently severe to be compensable, and she\nsaid: My hearing has gotten worse and it now is\nseverely worse to be a compensable disability. The\nnotice letter that was sent to her, which is on page 43\nof the joint appendix, was incorrect and simply\ndescribed the general requirements for establishing a\nservice connection. It didn't specifically say to make\nout an increased rating claim you have to show that your\nhearing has become worse.\nBut as soon as she got a decision from the\nregional office, which is the first decisionmaker in the\nVA system, she was told that the reason her claim had\nbeen denied was because her hearing loss was not\nsufficiently severe. And there's a mechanical\napplication of the certain number of decibels in each\near yields a certain disability rating, and the notice\nthat she got from the regional office explained all of\nthat and cited the regulation that we produced in the\ntables.\nSo at that point she was aware of why her\nclaim had been denied and what was missing, namely,\nevidence that her hearing had become worse. And she had\nbeen given at that point a series of hearing\nexaminations -- examinations for hearing by VA doctors\nand the results of those were all reproduced in the\ndecision that she got. And yet, the Veterans Court\nfound that the government had failed to carry its burden\nof showing a lack of prejudice, because we couldn't show\nas a matter of law that there was no way she could\nobtain --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Which is fine. If I get\nthat record and if it is the way you describe, I'm not\nin grave doubt. No problem. The record's the way you\ndescribed it, she knew everything she was supposed to\nknow, so there's no harmful error, okay? We are only\ntalking about cases where there is real doubt in the\njudge's mind about whether this failure of the agency\ndid or did not hurt the woman or man. Now, when in\ndoubt, we have the Veterans Court telling us the best\nway to administer this stuff is when they get no notice\nat all, and you are really in doubt, judge, you don't\nknow if it was harmful or not, here's what you do:\nAssume it was harmful. They're the ones who know. I\ndon't know.\nMR. MILLER: With respect, Your Honor, I\ndon't think that's a fair description of the effect of\nthe rule adopted by the court below.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose then we look at our\nrule, we read the first paragraph, what this court said,\nand we all held it, and therefore, we say, those are the\ncases we're talking about, where you are in doubt, and\nwhen you are in doubt, go proceed as the Veterans Court\ntold you in terms of who has to show what.\nMR. MILLER: I think this case is a good\nillustration about why that sort of grave doubt you are\ndescribing doesn't arise in a case like this, where at\nno state in the proceedings has the claimant offered\nanything that they would have done any differently. If\nthey can't say, you know, here's what would have\nhappened differently, than there really isn't any doubt\nwhat will happen on the remand, because if on the remand\nif they don't do anything different then the result is\nnot going to be any different.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Maybe I am not following\nthis as I should, but it seems to me you are suggesting\nthat there is no error.\nMR. MILLER: No, certainly there was an\nerror. There was an error.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What was the error?\nMR. MILLER: The error was that the initial\nletter that was sent to her describing what the evidence\nneeded to -- that she needed to submit in order to\nestablish her claim, misidentified that evidence; that\nit described the elements of general claim for service\nconnectiveness, didn't specifically explain what was\nneeded just an increased rating claim.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Are you saying that error\nwas not prejudicial because the earlier information she\nreceived gave her what she needed?\nMR. MILLER: The principal reason why that\nerror was not prejudicial is because the only way she\ncould have received benefits for an increased rating\nclaim was evidence that her hearing had become worse.\nAnd she had a VA hearing test that said her hearing did\nnot meet the schedule A criteria for being compensable\ndamages.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Why wasn't that statement\nyou just made sufficient to discharge the burden of\nshowing no prejudice?\nMR. MILLER: The fact -- I -- we believe it\nshouldn't, then. But under the rule as imposed by the\ncourts below, it clearly wasn't.\nUnder the decision of the Federal Circuit,\nthe VA has the burden of showing that there was no way\nthat benefits could have been awarded as a matter of\nlaw. And that had been in effect prior to the VA\nproving negative by demonstrating the non-existence of\nany evidence anywhere that might have been material to\nthe claim.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You know -- it's\neasy to look back and view this in the abstract legal\nterms, but we are dealing with lay people who are trying\nto get something from the government, which is always a\ndifficult thing. And you have one notice saying you\nhave got to show that this was during the service, then\nthey get another notice or decision saying it wasn't\nsevere enough. Why is it so difficult, when the\ngovernment made a mistake in dealing with this layperson\nwho is just trying to get benefits to which they are\nentitled, to say that the government has to show that it\ndidn't make any difference, rather than requiring the\nlayperson to do that?\nMR. MILLER: Well, because there are two\nresponses. The first is that it's important to keep in\nmind the stage of the proceedings which this inquiry\ninvolved. The prejudicial inquiry is only at issue once\nthe claimant has reached the Veterans Court, which is an\nadversary proceeding in which claimants do have counsel,\nand they identified an error and they have explained to\nthe court: Here's what the error was. So that's the\nstage in which it would be incumbent upon them to\narticulate how the error might have affected them.\nThe other point to be made is under the rule\nof the court of appeals it's going to be very, very\ndifficult in many cases for the government to discharge\nthe burden of showing there is no evidence that could\nhave possibly been produced. And the result is a large\nnumber of remands.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And as between the two\ncourts, the court of appeals, the Veterans Court and the\nCourt of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, do we owe\neither of them, maybe not deference in the Chevron\nsense, but some deference because of their expertise in\ndealing with these claims, and if that is so then do we\nowe more deference to the court of appeals or the\nVeterans Court?\nTHE WITNESS: I'm not aware that this Court\nhas ever --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean it's an issue of\nlaw, so I take it it's de novo.\nMR. MILLER: It's certainly that.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But in the exercise of\nthat review, don't we have to give some weight to the\ndetermination of the Court of Appeals for Veterans\nClaims that sees these claims all the time? I actually\nthought that that's where you were going to start out\nbecause you cited 7261, which says that the Court of\nAppeals for the Federal Claims shall, what, give due\neffect to -- take due account of the rule of prejudicial\nerror. And I think you could get from that that they\nhave a certain amount of latitude in determining what\nthe best rule is. But you're not going to -- you don't\ntell us that?\nMR. MILLER: No, and I think that by\nadopting language from the APA using the same language\nthat applies to all kinds of judicial review of agency\nactions, Congress strongly suggested that it didn't want\na unique rule for judicial review of VA determinations.\nAnd so I think there is no reason to defer to either the\nVeterans Court or the Federal Circuit on this general\nquestion of the standard of prejudicial review.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask a factual\nquestion. You said most of these people were\nrepresented by counsel. There used to be a rule that\nthey could only be paid ten dollars a case. Is that\nstill in effect?\nMR. MILLER: When I said they were\nrepresented by counsel, I meant in the Court of appeals\nfor Veterans Claims, not at the administrative --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But not during the nisi\nprius proceeding.\nMR. MILLER: In the administrative\nproceeding the restrictions on payment of counsel have\nnow been relaxed at the Court of Veterans Appeals stage.\nSo there generally -- there is not counsel at the\nregional office, but once the case reaches the board\nthere can be counsel.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: There can be counsel. But\nis it really typical?\nMR. MILLER: I don't know the statistics on\nthat, because --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: There would be a dramatic\nchange, because years ago I remember a case in which the\nCourt upheld a ten-dollar fee limit on the notion that\nthese people didn't need lawyers at all, which struck me\nas a little strange.\nMR. MILLER: In any event, that is no longer\nthe case at the board level, and even those claimants\nwho do not have counsel, the great majority of them, I\nthink about three-quarters at the regional office level\nand 98 percent at the board level are represented by\nsome sort of non-attorney representative, either service\norganizations like the American Legion, or many States\nhave organizations that assist claimants. Like Ms.\nSimmons, for example, was represented by a North\nCarolina State agency before the VA. So there is some\nassistance to claimants there.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Miller, could you help\nme out on how the system works in practice in a\ndifferent way? One of your answers a few moments ago\nwas that when -- I think it was Ms. Simmons was told why\nshe lost, she in effect got as much notice as she would\nhave needed to have to in effect do better on a remand.\nMy first question is: Is there an automatic right to a\nremand?\nMR. MILLER: If you are talking about after\nthe initial decision from the regional office, there is\nnot an automatic right to a remand, but there is an\nautomatic right to a de novo review by a more senior\nofficial at the regional office.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: With new evidence?\nMR. MILLER: Yes. You can get a hearing.\nYou can present new evidence. It's a decision review\nofficer. And then if you are still dissatisfied with\nthe resolution after that, you can go to the board, and\nyou can get a hearing before the board. The board's\nreview is de novo.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But even on the --\non the functioning of the system as you have explained\nit, at the -- at the very least the person says -- let's\nassume Simmons says: Oh, now I understand and I will\nget the following piece of evidence, which I didn't\nrealize was my responsibility.\nEven on that explanation, it means that the\nclaimant is going to have to go through another stage in\nthe administrative litigation process.\nSo I assume that ought to count as some sort\nof prejudice, and I assume it's something that, as it\nwere, the burden of championing the VA ought to bear\nrather than the claimant.\nMR. MILLER: Well, I guess to the extent\nthat the delay in adjudicating the claim is a kind of\nprejudice, it's not a prejudice that would in any sense\nbe cured by a remand for further proceedings, which will\njust result in further delay.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If the -- I'm sorry. I\ndidn't mean to interrupt.\nMR. MILLER: I would just add that the --\nthe effective date of the claim, which is the date as of\nwhich benefits are awarded, is the date the claim was\nfiled, so you wouldn't be losing money when you --\nexcept for the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but you are going to\nhave to go through another stage of litigation. One of\nthe functions of the burden rule, and it might be too\nsubtle a function to worry much about, but one of the\nfunctions is to puts the party with the burden on -- on\nnotice that if you fail in your obligation, you're the\none who is going to have to pay, unless you can convince\neverybody that there was in fact no harm done by this.\nAnd this induces the party with the burden to do what\nthe primary obligation says the party ought to do.\nAnd on your -- and on your analysis, since\nthe government would not have that obligation, the\ngovernment has less of an inducement to follow the\nstatutory obligation.\nMR. MILLER: But the government has a very\nstrong inducement to follow the statutory obligation.\nLike every agency -- -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it may have a strong\ninducement, but I'm talking about a stronger one. If\nthe government knows that it is going to bear the burden\nof any doubt about the significance of its failure, to\nsome extent I suppose that is going to induce the\ngovernment to be on its toes.\nMR. MILLER: Well, I suppose that is right,\nbut I think in a lot of cases -- the VA in all cases\nstrives conscientiously to comply with its statutory\nobligations. The notice requirements as described in\nsection 5103 are fairly vague. They -- the notice has\nto be tailored, at least to some extent, to the nature\nof the claim that's presented. And every time that the\nVeterans Court or the Federal Circuit elaborates on\nexactly what kind of notice is required, to the extent\nthat the VA wasn't aware of that elaboration before,\nthere are going to have to be remands in all those\npending cases.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I mean that's the\nessential problem with common law adjudication. And\nthere is not much we can do about that.\nMR. MILLER: But it's a problem that is\nparticularly acute here, given the volume of claims that\nthe VA has.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What is the experience?\nWhen the case is remanded, it goes back to the -- does\nit go back to the regional? Suppose the -- the veteran\nis now given an opportunity to present whatever\nadditional substantiation.\nMR. MILLER: The claim, when remanded from\nthe Court of appeals for Veterans Claims, goes back to\nthe board. In most instances the board would then send\nit back to the regional office for further development.\nIf I could reserve the remainder of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nMiller.\nMr. Meade.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER J. MEADE\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT SIMMONS\nMR. MEADE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI would like to make three points. First,\nbecause notice is integral to the system that Congress\ndesigned, the VA's failure to provide notice is likely\nto prejudice the veteran.\nSecond, it would be difficult for the\nveteran and comparatively easy for the government to\ncarry a burden. It would be difficult for the veteran\nbecause under the government's rule the veteran would\nneed to engage in a speculative exercise, identifying\nwhat evidence would have been developed had the veteran\nbeen notified and had he received the full assistance of\nthe agency.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why is it a speculative\nenterprise? If you are correct, and the proper\nresolution in a case like this is a remand, let's say\nall the way back to the regional office, and if before\nthe regional office it's the veteran who will need to\ncome forward with some evidence supporting the claim,\nwhy does it make sense to remand the case to the\nregional office if there is no possibility that when the\ncase gets back there the veteran can come forward with\nmedical evidence that's needed?\nMR. MEADE: Two reasons, Justice Alito:\nFirst, it's not clear even in the Veterans Court that\nthe veteran will have notice of what's required, a point\nI would like to address.\nBut, second, if it's remanded, the process\nwill develop as it should have in the first place,\nbecause under the statutory scheme there is both the VA\nand the veteran, the informed veteran, who have joint\nduties and together during an interactive process they\ndevelop the evidence together. And during this\ninteractive process, to answer to Justice Stevens's\nquestion, the veteran is prohibited from hiring a\nlawyer. Without having the most basic notice of what's\nrequired, the veteran cannot participate in this\nprocess. And the only way we can know how the process\nwould really work would be to give the veteran the\nnotice that he was entitled to in the first place and\nthen allow the process to unfold as it should have.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What if you have the\nsituation -- and I think actually your co-Respondent's\ncase illustrates this better than yours. But you have a\nsituation where the record as it has developed contains\nsome evidence that supports the veteran's position and\nsome evidence that supports the position in favor of\ndenial of benefits. The Veterans Administration all the\nway up through the process finds that the evidence\ncontrary to the veteran's position is much stronger and\ndenies the claim on that basis. The veteran says: I\ndidn't get notice of what exactly I needed to prove.\nNow, if on remand to the regional office\nit's still going to be up to the veteran to come forward\nwith medical evidence showing hearing loss or vision --\nconnecting the vision loss to something that happened in\nthe service, why does it make sense to send it back if\nthere's no possibility that the veteran is going to be\nable to do that when the case gets back?\nMR. MEADE: Well, the answer is, first of\nall, that we don't know how the process would unfold\nonce the veteran has notice. Even if there is evidence\nin the record, we don't know what evidence would have\nbeen developed had the veteran had proper notice.\nIn addition, veterans often are not --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. Why is that?\nI'm not sure I follow you on that point. Once he's got\nup to the next level and finds what the notice should\nhave told him, why can't he come up with it then?\nMR. MEADE: Well, for a few reasons. First\nof all --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You say it's a de novo,\nright, at this next level?\nMR. MEADE: First of all, it's unclear\nwhether the veteran would even have notice even at that\npoint. None of the other requirements that the agency's\nis required to give are the same as the notice\nrequirement. However, if in appropriate cases they have\ngiven the actual notice by the time it reaches the\nVeterans Court, they can use that to rebut the\nprejudice. And that's what the Veterans Court said in\nVasquez-Flores.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In your case did your\nclient attend the initial hearing?\nMR. MEADE: There was a medical examination\nthat she didn't attend. There was a question of where\nthe notice was sent, and this is at 70a of the\nPetitioner's appendix. There was confusion.\nApparently, notice was sent to the wrong address by the\nagency.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what's the first\ntime that your client knew that this claim was going to\nbe processed at a particular time or the first time your\nclient knew it had been denied? I just was never clear\non the fact of what happened. If the notice was lost in\nthe mail, so how did she know there was a hearing at\nall, or did she?\nMR. MEADE: She later informed the agency\nthat she had changed her address. But even it appears\nthat further notices were sent to the wrong address.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm just trying to -- it\nseems to me at the first hearing, if she in fact is\nthere, they say, well, now you have to give us some\nnotice. And then at that point -- or some\ndocumentation, and at that point, at the initial\nhearing, everybody knows who has to produce what.\nMR. MEADE: But there is not necessarily a\nhearing. It was a medical examination that was supposed\nto be scheduled that she didn't attend, partly because\nof confusion of where the notice was sent.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is there usually an\ninitial hearing?\nMR. MEADE: No. There's only a hearing if\nthe veteran requests it.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Okay.\nMR. MEADE: There is no hearing unless the\nveteran requests it. So here we have a situation where\nthe veteran did not know what she needed to provide.\nShe has two sets of claims, one for her left ear and one\nfor her right ear. Neither claim was intuitive. And\nshe couldn't figure out what she needed to do without he\nnotice --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And so, why not just say\nthat? What's the big problem of saying, judge, and then\nyou say just what you said? And then the judge again\nwon't be in doubt any more. So there's no need for this\ncase because, either -- either -- either the veteran's\nagency will say, look, I walked that veteran through the\nprocess, I walked him through the process, walking him\nthrough the process he was told everything he needed to\nknow, and there is no real problem here. It's just a\nformality that he didn't get the notice. And if that's\ntrue, I'm not in any doubt, unless the veteran tells me\nthat that's wrong, and here was something, okay?\nOn the other hand, we have your case. Your\ncase, she didn't go to the doctor. If she went to the\ndoctor, maybe she would have found something out.\nAgain, I have no doubt, there is harmful\nerror. So this case is a theoretical law professor's\ncase that is never going to come up, because there is\nnever any doubt. Either the VA did walk him through it\nand it's no deal -- big deal, because she can't come up\nwith anything, or she can come up with something.\nMR. MEADE: I agree that burdens only matter\nin a handful of cases, but it makes sense to put the\nburden on the government for a number of reasons.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It certainly does because\nit makes sense to tell the government: Government, you\nhave to come up with every possible conceivable factual\nscenario and prove there wasn't a man from Mars who came\nin, and -- you know, that doesn't make sense.\nMR. MEADE: But that's not what we ask for\nhere. First of all, if the veteran actually received\nnotice during this dialogue that the government\ndescribes, then the government can point to that as a\nway to disprove prejudice.\nSecond of all, veterans are often\nvulnerable. They are often unrepresented in the\nVeterans Court. Under the latest statistics, 64 percent\nare unrepresented at the beginning of the Veterans\nCourt, 24 percent at the conclusion of the Veterans\nCourt. Many have psychological and mental disabilities\nlike post-traumatic stress disorder. Twelve percent of\nthose who currently receive disabilities receive\nbenefits for PTSD.\nAnd it's not clear -- this is not lawyers;\nthis is not doctors trying to receive benefits. This is\nnot just lay people. They are veterans who served the\ncountry --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I know all this and why\ndon't you just tell the judge that and say: Look at my\nclient, judge, look at my client. My client obviously\nisn't going to understand what to do unless the client\nis told. And here my client wasn't told.\nI'm the judge, I'm not in any doubt, you're\ngoing to win, okay?\nSo what I can't figure out is how to deal\nwith this case, which as I said strikes me as a law\nprofessor's case that shouldn't make any difference in\nany real situation.\nMR. MEADE: The reason is that it's helpful\nto have presumptions to deal with the typical case where\nwe have in our case a first element notice error. The\nquestion where the veteran does not even know what\nevidence he needs to put forward, in that case it makes\nsense because of the high likelihood of prejudice to\nhave a general rule that the burden should be on the\ngovernment and not on the veteran.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No court is going to\naccept as a showing of prejudice the idea that, here,\nlook at my client as a layperson who didn't know what to\ndo. That's not going to be adequate, is it?\nMR. MEADE: I don't think it would be.\nThat's why it makes sense to have a general presumption.\nIn cases where the government can either show that the\nprocess worked as it should have or that the veteran\nactually received notice during the process, it can\nrebut that prejudice.\nIn fact, in 2008 alone, the government has\nbeen able to do so. And it has done so at least a dozen\ntimes in a number of cases, rebutting the burden of\nprejudice that was established by the Veterans Court.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What's wrong with\nMr. Miller's response that at the very first level of\nreview, you can start all over; and at that point you\nknow precisely why your claim was denied?\nMR. MEADE: Well, again, there are various\nlevels of review. But the notice to start that first\nlevel of appellate review does not necessarily give the\nveteran the notice that she is entitled to.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That was my\nquestion. Is it -- is it -- I take it it's more than\njust a stamp saying \"denied,\" right? There is some\nexplanation in every case?\nMR. MEADE: Exactly. There is a statutory\nrequirement that a statement of reasons needs to be\nprovided, but the statement of reasons don't necessarily\ncorrelate with the detailed requirements under the\nnotice statute. Under Vasquez-Flores what the Veterans\nCourt said was that the notice needs to be quite\ndetailed and the denial letter in a particular case\nmight not map on to those particular requirements.\nIn October of this year, Congress went\nfarther and said: We want these notice letters to be\neven more detailed. We want to give the veterans more\nnotice, which shows that the Congress is concerned about\nthese notice letters and wants to make it clear to the\nveteran what is required.\nLet me answer a point that Justice Alito\nraised before. We are not asking here for a presumption\nof benefits. All we are asking for is a remand so that\nthe veteran can get notice and have the process proceed\nas it was meant to in the original circumstance.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Does the -- the notice\ncan be given -- skipped entirely, as it was in Simmons\ncase, or notice could be given but it's defective. It\ncan be defective in a major way, it can leave out -- you\nsaid Congress recently required a more detailed notice.\nDo we treat all those like, as long as the notice\ndoesn't measure up fully to their statutory requirement,\nthen the veteran goes back to square one? And so, you\nwouldn't make any distinction between whether the notice\nwas not given at all, and the case where the notice was\ngiven, but it was incomplete?\nMR. MEADE: The question of whether the\nnotice is okay or not, is a question for the Veterans\nCourt, a factual finding.\nGenerally, though, I would agree with you\nthat either no notice or incomplete notice are the same\nand would trigger a first notice error. There would be\ncases, I suspect, where the notice was erroneous, but\nonly on a technical ground, that the Veterans Court\nwould not think of as being a first level notice error.\nOne final point I would like to make, Your\nHonor, is that in passing the statute Congress made it\nclear that it wanted to assist all veterans, including\nthose whose claims did not appear meritorious on their\nface, and it did so by overruling the decision in Morton\nv. West in the Veterans Court.\nThat case has said that a veteran needs to\nmeet a certain minimal threshold before receiving VA's\nassistance, that first the veteran needs to show that\nthe claim is well grounded. Congress rejected that in\npassing the statute and said: Congress wants to help\nall veterans, including those whose claims don't seem\nmeritorious on the face and including those who can't\nmake a threshold requirement. And Congress specifically\nrejected the policy rationale of the Veterans Court and\nsaid that they want -- Congress wants to use resources\nto help all veterans, including those whose claims are\nnot meritorious on its face.\nThank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nMeade.\nMr. Lippman.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK R. LIPPMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT SANDERS\nMR. LIPPMAN: Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nJustice Br eyer, I would like to address one\nof the observations you made applying O'Neal and\nKotteakos and the \"grave doubt\" standard.\nThe problem here is that those standards\nassume a fully developed record. That's why it's not a\nperfect fit here because the very notice failure, the\ndefective notice, prevents a fully developed record.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, it seems -- what I\nwas trying to get to, which I don't see how to quite get\nthere -- it seems to me that if something really went\nwrong, if there -- there's no notice, that \"veteran, you\nhave to put in some material, or you are going to\nlose,\" if there is no notice of that, and he really\ndidn't get any notice during all this cooperative\nprocess, then I think the Veteran's Court is right. At\nthat point I think it's fair to assume that he's hurt.\nBut if he got the notice -- and there'll be\na few cases where he had nothing to produce, but a lot\nof them he would have had something to produce. They\nknow it, we don't know. The Veteran's Court knows. Now\nthe other three matters -- who is supposed to produce\nwhat, and do you have general knowledge, can you produce\nwhatever you want -- I would think it would be very rare\nthat a veteran was hurt, if he knows the first, by not\nknowing the second, third and fourth.\nAnd therefore, I think he better come forth\nto explain in the brief, in the brief, why this matters.\nNow, that's what it seemed to me the Veterans Court set\nup. They know about it. They set that up. It's common\nsense. So, how do I get to a legal result that says\njust that? Or can I or should I?\nMR. LIPPMAN: I don't think you should, and\nif my case could be used as an example --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Your case is one where\nthe veteran did get what they call the first level\nnotice.\nMR. LIPPMAN: Correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So Justice -- the\nimplication of Justice Breyer's question is that your\nclient would lose, because your client did get the first\nlevel notice and you say that that's not good enough.\nMR. LIPPMAN: That's correct. He did not\nget the second or third level of notices; that is, what\nthe government said it will get and what he was required\nto get.\nThis is the letter or part of the letter,\ncritical part of the letter he got. It says: \"We are\nmaking reasonable efforts to help you get private\nrecords or evidence necessary to support your claim.\"\nSo he had every reason to assume that the -- that the VA\nwould get the evidence that was necessary.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why doesn't this make sense\nin your case? I think this illustrates what is\ntroubling to me about the Federal Circuit's decision,\nbut maybe I am missing the point.\nYour client was denied benefits for failure\nto show a causal connection, to show that his vision\nloss is service-related. He provided evidence from two\nprivate ophthalmologists or optometrists providing very\nweak causes of -- evidence of causation. One said it\nwas not inconceivable that this was the cause of it. He\nwas examined by two VA doctors, who said it was more\nlikely that this was caused by post-service infection\nrather than by an explosion while he was in the service.\nNow if the case -- if the notice was\ndefective, why does it not make sense to say to your\nclient, show us that you can come up with some medical\nevidence that shows that this is service-related,\nsomething more than a doctor who says it's not\ninconceivable?\nThen it makes sense to remand it. But if\nyou can't do it on appeal, what sense does it make to\nremand it, where the same failure to provide evidence is\ngoing to doom his claim?\nMR. LIPPMAN: Two answers to that, Your\nHonor.\nThe first is, the government makes the\nproposition that all we need to do is offer an\nexplanation. But in legal terms, that is a proffer on\nappeal, and that is every bit as evidential as the\nactual evidence itself. Now, if we -- if we are to have\na whole practice of proffers, it opens up a Pandora's\nbox. I mean, where -- where do you stop if you make an\nexception for extra-record evidence, when the statutes\nmake it clear that the evidence or whatever you are\nusing has to be before the agency.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why is that such a tough\nthing to do? It sounds like it's sort of -- is there\nsome law out there that stops you from saying in the\nbrief in a paragraph that, we would just like you to\nknow, Judge, that we had some evidence here, or we have\nsome now that we want to present to them. That's all.\nAnd then if I see that, I would say, my\ngoodness -- and you describe it in three sentences. Now\nwhat is -- the Constitution doesn't stop you from doing\nthat, does it? What stops you from doing that?\nMR. LIPPMAN: The statutes stop you from\ndoing that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: They stop you, but the\nVeterans Court said to do it. So -- and they are the\none who know this area and they said you should have to\ndo it.\nMR. LIPPMAN: But with all due respect, I\nthink the Veterans Court got it wrong. I mean --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Between me and the Veterans\nCourt, as to who knows best how to work this system,\nit's ten to one it's not me.\nMR. LIPPMAN: Okay. Let's look at it this\nway. Let's take it outside the VCAA context. A veteran\nhas a right to a hearing, an evidentiary hearing, upon\nrequest. Let's say he requests the hearing, and for\nwhatever reason the VA doesn't schedule one. He loses\nthat right even though he requests it. Are we then now\nto have proffers on the court of appeals saying, well, I\nwould have said this, I would have said this, I would\nhave said --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What they decided there is\nif there's no notice at all, no, you don't have to have\na proffer, because it's up to the agency to do just what\nyou want. But if it's one of these other three, far\nmore technical things, which occur far more rarely, on\nthat one, you better tell the judge in the brief how it\nmakes a difference.\nThat's their conclusion. What's wrong with\nthat?\nMR. LIPPMAN: Well, there -- there is\ncertainly no analysis to it. I mean, it's sort of an\nintuitive distinction and in my case, it doesn't work.\nAnd I think --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, the -- the statute\nsays, and this is consistent with Justice Breyer's line\nof questioning, that the Veterans Court, the Court of\nAppeals, the Veterans Court of Appeals, shall give due\naccount to the notice -- to the rule of prejudicial\nerror. That seems to me to indicate that it has some\ndiscretion in how to decide the harmless error rules\nthat it will apply, and that it knows more about it, in\nJustice Breyer's term, than either we or the Court of\nAppeals for the Federal Circuit. Why can't I get that\nout of this statute?\nMR. LIPPMAN: Well, I guess you would have\nto reconcile the more specific statute that deals with\nonly able to submit evidence or any other material at\nthe time -- at the of the agency's adjudication. In\nother words, I don't see that statute allowing\npost-agency adjudication proffers or even submitting\nevidence. I mean, just by the very line of your\nquestioning, it seems to me that you find it\ninterchangeable whether you assert it in your brief that\nthis is what I would have done or whether you would have\nsubmitted the evidence itself. They are both\nevidential. And another problem, which is really --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Your position seems to be\nnot that the government should have to show prejudice,\nbut as applied to a case like yours, that there is an\nirrebuttal presumption of prejudice. What could the\ngovernment show? They would have to show that there is\nnot a single ophthalmologist in the country who, if he\nor she examined Mr. Sanders, would find that the vision\nloss was attributable to a bazooka explosion in World\nWar II?\nMR. LIPPMAN: No, Your Honor. The -- what\nthe government must show is well set forth in the\nFederal Circuit's opinion. It must show that the\nclaimant had either actual knowledge of what he needed\nto submit; second, that he had some constructive\nknowledge, in other words a reasonable claimant would\nhave had notice; or three, that the claim couldn't\nentitled to benefits as a matter of law.\nSo that's the beauty --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- but I don't understand\nthat. I mean, let's suppose, contrary to your wishes,\nthat the client was not hurt. He was hurt by some other\nthing, nothing to do with the bazooka. That's not your\nclient -- that's the imaginary client -- but everything\nelse is the same.\nWell, does that mean because they forgot to\ntell the client that the client has to go and produce\nsome evidence, and she thought the Veterans\nAdministration would produce all the evidence? Because\nthey forgot that, your client wins and gets the money?\nMR. LIPPMAN: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That doesn't seem --\nMR. LIPPMAN: -- he wouldn't get the money,\nokay? Because all -- we are talking about a remand, not\na --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I know. Now you are going\nto be back in the remand and you now have to produce\nsome evidence, don't you, or you lose?\nMR. LIPPMAN: Correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So then why is it a big\ndeal that you summarize what you're going to produce in\nthe brief? We're back where we started.\nMR. LIPPMAN: Let me answer it this way.\nLet's assume we do make proffers, as you suggest, at the\nVeterans --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I might have called them a\nproffer. I just want to say it's a description in the\nbrief of how you're hurt.\nMR. LIPPMAN: Well, in the legal sense I\nconsider it the same thing. Maybe Your Honors don't,\nbut I do. And -- let -- let's say he proffers or\ndescribes in his brief what medical evidence he needs to\nsubmit.\nHow could he in good faith make a proffer\nand speculate on what the doctor -- let's say he is\nseeing a treating doctor. And on page 49 in the\nfootnote, there is a discussion of what I'm going to\nexplain to you now. But let's say he alleges, well, if\nI had gotten notice, I would have gone to my treating\ndoctor, and I would have submitted questions and I would\nhave submitted the claims file, but I can't know in good\nfaith what the doctor would say. It's inherently\nspeculative. And that's one good policy reason, apart\nfrom the clear categorical language of the statute.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You started earlier,\nat one point, to say how this actually worked out in\nyour case. Could you just spend a minute to explain\nthat?\nMR. LIPPMAN: How --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How it makes a\ndifference in your case.\nMR. LIPPMAN: Sure. It was a little unclear\nuntil a case -- if I may answer it this way, Your Honor.\nMy -- the Board of Veterans Appeals decided\nthere was only one medical evidence it would follow, and\nthat was the 2000 VA exam. And that exam really denied\nthe veteran because there was no corroborating medical\nevidence contemporary with his injury and the\nsymptomology thereafter. If I could have it go back\ndown, what I would do is try to find what we call \"buddy\nstatements,\" lay statements, that would corroborate that\nhe had symptoms from time of service and well on, which\nunder a case called Buchanan is sufficient evidence to\nbase a finding of service connection.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So why wasn't that\nenough for you to establish prejudice, regardless of who\nhad the burden?\nMR. LIPPMAN: To make that allegation at the\ncourt of appeal that I would have gotten this?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Uh-hmm.\nMR. LIPPMAN: Quite frankly, I don't know if\nI would have gotten it. I mean, I would try.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you would\nphrase the prejudice in terms of what you would have\ndone and what you weren't able to do, and which you can\nnow go back and do if it's remanded. You don't have to\nhave the evidence that three people would say he was\ncomplaining about the vision loss at the time. It just\nseems a reasonable thing to -- you know, maybe it is\nreasonable, maybe it's not; but the Veterans\nAdministration has more knowledge about that.\nMR. LIPPMAN: Your Honor, in a way, the\nthird prong of the Federal Circuit's analysis does that.\nIt tells the government: Look, if the veteran could not\nprove his claim, no matter what the facts -- evidentiary\ndevelopment was, then the veteran loses.\nSo really it's all contained in the third\nprong. And that's why the Federal Circuit's analysis in\nmy opinion is so good. It's because it doesn't make you\ngo outside of the record to reach these issues, and it\nallows the government a lot of room to prove that it's\nnot worthwhile, this claim's not worthwhile to, remand.\nI ask the Court to really carefully look at\nthat because I know the Federal Circuit spent -- must\nhave spent a lot of time in coming up with that\nanalysis.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you know where this\nfirst level, second level -- I'm looking at the statute\non page 98a of the petition. And it seems to me all\npart of one. It is one notice? It doesn't seem to\nspecify a second and a third. It's describing the\ncontents.\nMR. LIPPMAN: Well --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: \"As part of that notice,\nthe Secretary shall indicate which portion of the\ninformation and evidence is to be provided by the\nclaimant and which portion by the Secretary.\" The\nstatute seems to be talking about one notice, not \"first\nlevel,\" \"second level.\"\nMR. LIPPMAN: Well, they haven't enumerated\nit, Your Honor, as such. But analytically it breaks\ndown to that. But the fourth element, because it says,\nlook, you'll have to tell the claimant what the\ncontents, what you need. Then it says, well, what we\nare going to get for you, and then that's the second.\nAnd third one is what you have to get.\nThe fourth one was engrafted upon it because\nin the regs 3.159 has a more generalized advisement, in\naddition to this --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that was taken\nout, the fourth one. No?\nMR. LIPPMAN: Not to my knowledge, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And tell me what that is.\nIt's not in the statute?\nMR. LIPPMAN: No, it's in 3.159. I don't\nrecall the exact -- it's 38 C.F.R. 3.159. I don't\nrecall offhand the exact subdivision, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it just tells that\nthe Secretary requests the claimant provide any evidence\nin the claimant's possession that pertains to the claim.\nMR. LIPPMAN: Right.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That's fairly\nstraightforward.\nMR. LIPPMAN: It's not as important as the\nfirst, second, and third elements of the statute, for\nsure, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. LIPPMAN: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Miller, you have\nfour minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. MILLER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. MILLER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nI would like to make just three points.\nFirst, on the question of what is provided to the\nclaimant after the denial in the regional office.\nBefore they get to the Board of Veterans Appeals, the\nregional office issued them a statement of the case, and\nthat's described at 38 C.F.R. 19.29, and that regulation\nhas fairly detailed requirements about what has to be in\nthere in terms of a description of the evidence, the\ndescription of the applicable laws and regulations and\nanalysis of the board's conclusions, or the regional\noffice's conclusions and its application of the law to\nthe evidence.\nThe second point --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think it's\nperfectly clear from that what gaps need to be filled\nin?\nMR. MILLER: In many cases, it would be.\nBut perhaps there would be some where it wouldn't, and\nof course in those cases if there can be some\narticulation of why it wasn't then we would agree --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: At that point is the\nclaimant disentitled to have a lawyer?\nMR. MILLER: No. Once they file the notice\nof disagreement in the regional office and receive the\nstatement of the case, they could then have a lawyer in\nthe board.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But at the point they get\nthe notice and they are trying to evaluate the\nsignificance of the notice, they are not entitled to a\nlawyer?\nMR. MILLER: If you are referring to the\nstatement of the case, by the time they receive the\nstatement of the case they are at the stage of the\nproceedings where they could get a lawyer.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But what about the notice,\nthe original notice? They don't have a lawyer at that\npoint? That was Justice Souter's question. I didn't --\nMR. MILLER: Oh, if you meant the original\nnotice required by the statute. No.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No -- at the point where\nthe statute requires original notice, they are not\nentitled to a lawyer.\nMR. MILLER: Correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: We agree on that. Now,\nthey have gone through stage one of the litigation and\nthey have lost. And they are getting a statement of\nreasons. At that point, are they entitled to have a\nlawyer?\nMR. MILLER: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But whether -- I guess the\nsituation that I am concerned with is, the person up to\nthat moment not only does not have, but is not entitled\nto have a lawyer. The person then gets a piece of paper\nin the mail that says, \"You lost. These are the\nreasons.\" If the person -- if the claimant then says,\n\"I don't know what they are talking about. I will go\nget a lawyer,\" then I can understand at that point a\nrelatively sophisticated mind is going to come in to\nunderstand it. But if the client simply reads it and\nsays, \"I really don't know what they are talking about\nhere or at least I think I know what they are talking\nabout, and I guess it's hopeless,\" the person is not\nlikely to have legal advice.\nAnd what I'm getting at is that the person\nat that stage, at the moment the notice arrives, is in a\nposition, I would think, of extreme relative\ndisadvantage.\nMR. MILLER: I think --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You can see where I am\ngoing with the argument.\nMR. MILLER: Yes. The important point is\nthat the only way the prejudicial error becomes an issue\nand really the paradigmatic case that we are talking\nabout is where the veteran does get counsel and has\nreached the Veterans Court and has identified the error\nin a way that's persuasive to the Veterans Court, but\nnonetheless identifies no additional evidence that they\nwould have --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but it seems to me that\nthere are two points at which the veteran is at a\ndisadvantage. And you are talking about the second of\nthe two. I am talking about the first of the two. And\nthe first of the two is the point at which the -- I\nmean, following the hearing, the veteran gets the notice\nand the veteran is not in a very sophisticated position\nto evaluate what the veteran is being told.\nMR. MILLER: Yes, and a claimant who in the\nVeterans Court can say, you know, \"I didn't understand\nand as a result I failed to present the -- because of\nthe defective notice and my lack of understanding of the\nstatement of the case, I didn't present this important\npiece of evidence, and here's how it would have been\nmaterial,\" in that case, they would be entitled to a\nremand. But a remand --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When you have been\nsaying \"entitled to a lawyer,\" do you mean entitled to a\nlawyer or allowed to have a lawyer?\nMR. MILLER: Allowed to retain counsel.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can finish\nyour --\nMR. MILLER: I was just going to say that,\ngiven the volume of cases that the VA confronts, there\nis a serious harm to the system in unnecessary remands\nthat have to be given priority over other cases and that\ndivert resources from the adjudication of meritorious\nclaims.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
