GIBBONS\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS\nMR. GIBBONS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nWhat is at stake in this case is the\nauthority of the Federal courts to uphold the rule of\nlaw. Respondents assert that their actions are\nabsolutely immune from judicial examination whenever\nthey elect to detain foreign nationals outside our\nborders. Under this theory, neither the length of\nthe detention, the conditions of their confinement,\nnor the fact that they have been wrongfully detained\nmakes the slightest difference.\nRespondents would create a lawless enclave\ninsulating the executive branch from any judicial\nscrutiny now or in the future.\nQUESTION: Mr. Gibbons, I understand that\nyour clients have been detained approximately two\nyears?\nMR. GIBBONS: That's correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Supposing they had only been\ndetained six months, how much would that weaken your\ncase?\nMR. GIBBONS: It wouldn't weaken it at all\nbecause as I'll get into in the argument, the case\ndepends on compliance with provisions of a binding\ntreaty, which requires a prompt determination of\ntheir status.\nQUESTION: So they would have had a habeas\ncorpus entitlement, in your view, within weeks after\ntheir, after their detention?\nMR. GIBBONS: They would have had\nentitlement to the process specified in the Geneva\nConvention, and if they had that process --\nQUESTION: Did they have that right when\nthey were in Afghanistan?\nMR. GIBBONS: They allege not, and on this\nrecord, you have to assume that, as did the Court of\nAppeals.\nQUESTION: But now in Johnson vs.\nEisentrager, we said that the Geneva Convention did\nnot confer a private right of action.\nMR. GIBBONS: Your Honor, the question of\nthe private right of action really is not presented\nin this case. We are not asking to imply a private\nright of action from the Geneva Convention or any\nother treaty. What we are saying is that the cause\nof action is created by the Habeas Corpus Statute and\nby the Administrative Procedure Act. The treaty\nprovides a rule of decision, not a cause of action.\nQUESTION: Well, I guess, at least the\nquestion presented is just whether the Federal court\nhas jurisdiction under the Habeas Statute, Section\n2241, is that right?\nMR. GIBBONS: That's correct.\nQUESTION: And you don't raise the issue\nof any potential jurisdiction on the basis of the\nConstitution alone. We are here debating the\njurisdiction under the Habeas Statute, is that right?\nMR. GIBBONS: That's correct, Justice\nO'Connor. As a matter of fact --\nQUESTION: 1331. I thought --\nMR. GIBBONS: It doesn't depend on Section\n1331, although the Administrative Procedure Act claim\ndoes depend on Section 1331.\nQUESTION: That's what I'm asking. Is\nthat here or not? You mentioned the APA claim.\nMR. GIBBONS: Yes.\nQUESTION: I thought you were still\nasserting that, are you not?\nMR. GIBBONS: Yes. I'm asserting that.\nQUESTION: So it isn't just habeas then,\nit's also --\nMR. GIBBONS: That does --\nQUESTION: It's also 13 --\nMR. GIBBONS: Your Honor, Justice Scalia,\nit does depend on Section 1331.\nQUESTION: So we have two things, the\nHabeas Statute and 1331?\nMR. GIBBONS: Yes.\nQUESTION: But you still win.\nMR. GIBBONS: Now --\nQUESTION: If you win under the Habeas\nStatute?\nMR. GIBBONS: Oh, absolutely.\nQUESTION: Yes. You don't need both.\nMR. GIBBONS: No. We don't. Now, if you\nlook at the Court of Appeals ruling in this case, the\nCourt of Appeals assumed that these people were\nfriendly aliens, assumed that they had never been\nmembers of any armed forces, and had never carried\nout any belligerent activity against the United\nStates. Assumed that they had never had the hearing\nrequired by the Geneva Convention to determine\nwhether or not in fact they were civilians who should\nhave been repatriated.\nWhat the Court of Appeals held was, and\nit's on page 1141 of the court's opinion, if the\nConstitution does not entitle detainees to due\nprocess, and it does not, they cannot invoke the\njurisdiction of our courts to test the\nconstitutionality or legality of restraints on their\nliberty.\nThus the Court of Appeals assumed that\nthe -- that the result turned on the absence of a\nconstitutional right, and that simply misreads the\nHabeas Corpus Statute. Section 2241(c)(1), which is\ncarried forward in virtually identical language from\nSection 14 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, antedated\nthe Bill of Rights. All it required, all it has ever\nrequired is Federal custody simpliciter, and that\ngives habeas corpus jurisdiction.\nQUESTION: Well, but other than producing\nthe person before the court so that the system is\nsatisfied that we know where the person is, surely\nyou have to go beyond that and assert some sort of\nright. And you -- you say that --\nMR. GIBBONS: Of course.\nQUESTION: -- the Geneva Convention is\nreally not the basis for the cause of action, which I\nagree, so where do we go after that? So he is here\nin front of the court. Now what?\nMR. GIBBONS: Your Honor, the Geneva\nConvention is the supreme law of the land. That's\nwhat the Constitution says about habeas.\nQUESTION: But it may not be\nself-executing. That's the problem, I guess. The\nindications are it's not.\nMR. GIBBONS: Your Honor, Your Honor --\nQUESTION: Forgetting the Geneva\nConvention, what happens when the person comes before\nthe court? You prevail and there is a writ of habeas\ncorpus, it comes here, and the judge says, now what\nam I supposed to do.\nMR. GIBBONS: What the judge is supposed\nto do is determine first whether or not the\ngovernment's response that the detention is legal is\nin fact an adequate response. Now, the government in\nthis case probably will respond, we don't have to\ngive the hearings required by the Geneva Convention.\nBut if you're going to treat a binding United States\ntreaty as the supreme law of the land, that is not an\nadequate answer.\nNow, this question of, is the treaty\nself-executing or not self-executing, I suggest is a\nstraw man. Since 1813, if a treaty provides a rule\nof decision and something else provides a cause of\naction, the treaty nevertheless provides the rule of\ndecision. That was several --\nQUESTION: But Johnson said quite\nspecifically that the Geneva Convention was not\navailable to the Petitioners in that case because it\ndid not confer any right of action.\nMR. GIBBONS: Well, Your Honor, I think\nthe latter part of your sentence is probably an\noverreading of Johnson. In Johnson, which I suggest\nis clearly distinguishable from this case, there were\nthree critical facts. One was that they were\nadmitted enemy aliens. Our Petitioners plead that\nthey are not.\nThe other was that they had a hearing\nbefore a military tribunal which comported with\nFederal legislation and with the extant rules of\ninternational law, and our Petitioners have had no\nsuch hearing.\nQUESTION: Well --\nQUESTION: But I take it you are --\nQUESTION: -- if you, if you, if your\nclients here had been given the review that has been\ndescribed to us in the government's brief, by\nmilitary authorities to determine whether these\npeople are indeed being held as enemy combatants,\nwould you be here if you knew that that review had\nbeen provided?\nMR. GIBBONS: We would not be. What we\nare seeking is the review provided --\nQUESTION: Well, I don't see how that --\nQUESTION: Wouldn't that depend on what\nthe review showed? And I thought you have alleged that\nyour\nclients were not enemy aliens. If it showed they\nwere tourists, they were just picked up by mistake,\nwould you be here or would you not be here?\nMR. GIBBONS: If they were detained after\na hearing determined that they were civilian\ndetainees who under Article IV of the Geneva\nConvention should be repatriated, we would be here.\nQUESTION: I don't see how those merits\nquestion go to the issue of jurisdiction of the\nCourt. It may well be that if those factors you\nmentioned were changed, you'd be entitled to judgment\nhere, even though the plaintiffs in Eisentrager were\nnot entitled to judgment, but we are not talking\nabout the merits right now. We are talking about\njurisdiction. Certainly jurisdiction doesn't turn on\nthe merits whether you were an enemy alien or not.\nMR. GIBBONS: Well, I suggest that a fair\nreading of Eisentrager is that that did turn on the\nmerits.\nQUESTION: No, but I thought your -- may\nI, may I ask you this, because I'm having the trouble\nJustice Scalia is having. I thought your principal\nargument on the basis of Eisentrager was that it\ncannot stand for the proposition that there is no\njurisdiction because in fact, in Eisentrager, there\nwas enough mention of matters on the merits so that\nit was clear that's what was driving the ultimate\nresolution in Eisentrager.\nAnd it cannot stand for the proposition\nthat a court cannot even inquire, and the only issue\nwe have got is whether under the Habeas Statute the\ncourt can even inquire. Do I misunderstand your\nposition?\nMR. GIBBONS: No, you do not, Justice\nSouter.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. GIBBONS: It's our position that\nEisentrager was a decision on the merits as a matter\nof fact. The Court says that they -- Petitioners\nwere extended the same preliminary hearing as the\nsufficiency application that was extended in Quirin,\nYamashita and Hirota versus McArthur, all of which\nwere decisions on the merits.\nQUESTION: But in several different\nplaces, Mr. Gibbons, in Eisentrager, the Court says\nthat we are talking about the Habeas Statute, and we\nare saying these Petitioners are not entitled to\nhabeas.\nMR. GIBBONS: Well, they are not as a\nmatter -- let me be clear about that. The result on\nthe merits in Eisentrager is perfectly correct. What\nthe Court did in Eisentrager was apply the scope of\nreview on habeas corpus, which was standard at that\ntime. If the military tribunal had lawful\njurisdiction, that ended the habeas inquiry.\nQUESTION: Well, there is another problem.\nAt that time, that case was decided when Ahrens\nagainst Clark was the statement of the law, so there\nis no statutory basis for jurisdiction there, and the\nissue is whether the Constitution by itself provided\njurisdiction. And of course, all that's changed now.\nMR. GIBBONS: Well, Your Honor, in\nEisentrager, both the Court of Appeals and the\nSupreme Court made it clear that they disapproved,\nthey were not adopting the ruling of the District\nCourt based on Ahrens v. Clark. Of course, in any\nevent, that does not go to subject matter\njurisdiction. That's a Rule 12(b)(2) issue of in\npersonam jurisdiction, whether a proper Respondent is\nbefore the Court. In Eisentrager, the Court assumed\n--\nQUESTION: Well, you didn't raise the question\nof whether the territorial jurisdiction provision\ncovered it. There was no territorial jurisdiction if\nthey were outside the district under the ruling in\nAhrens against Clark, which means they had to rely on\nthe Constitution to support jurisdiction, which in\nturn means that once they have overruled Ahrens\nagainst Clark, which they did, there is now a\nstatutory basis for jurisdiction that did not then\nexist.\nMR. GIBBONS: Your Honor, respectfully, I\ndon't think you can fairly read Justice Jackson's\nopinion as adopting the Ahrens v. Clark position.\nQUESTION: No. But Ahrens v. Clark was\nthe law at the time of that decision, and it was\nsubsequently overruled. So that -- that case was\ndecided when the legal climate was different than it\nhas been since Ahrens against Clark was overruled.\nMR. GIBBONS: Well -- in any event --\nQUESTION: Let me help you.\nMR. GIBBONS: In any event, there is no\nquestion that the Ahrens v. Clark rule does not apply\ntoday. These Respondents are the proper Respondents.\nQUESTION: Of course, it's a question of\nhow much it doesn't apply, whether it doesn't apply\nonly when there is at least clear statutory\njurisdiction in one, in one Federal court so it's\nalmost a venue call. It isn't clear that it's been\noverruled when there is no statutory jurisdiction in\nany Federal court. That's certainly an open question.\nMR. GIBBONS: Well, Your Honor, as to the\nabsence of jurisdiction, 2241(c)(1) could not be\nplainer. It's been plain for 215 years. If there is\nFederal detention and there is a proper Respondent\nbefore the Court as there is, there is habeas corpus\njurisdiction. I don't see any, even ambiguity in\nthat statute.\nQUESTION: What do you do if you have a\nlawful combatant in a declared war, and the\ncombatant, an enemy of the United States is captured\nand detained, habeas?\nMR. GIBBONS: Habeas, you mean on the\nbattlefield? Absolutely not.\nQUESTION: We'll take it from the\nbattlefield, and a week later, 10 miles away, then\nsix months later, a thousand miles away.\nMR. GIBBONS: In the zone of active\nmilitary operations or in an occupied area under\nmartial law, habeas corpus jurisdiction has never\nextended. It is the common law.\nQUESTION: Suppose it's Guantanamo.\nMR. GIBBONS: Well, the --\nQUESTION: A declared war and a lawful\ncombatant.\nMR. GIBBONS: A declared war and someone\nwho has been determined to be a combatant in\naccordance with Article V of the Geneva Convention,\nan application for a writ of habeas corpus in those\ncircumstances would, under Rule 12(b)(6), be\nsummarily dismissed.\nQUESTION: You are close to the merits.\nQUESTION: You are back to the Geneva\nConvention again, so I just have to assume your case\ndepends on the Geneva Convention.\nMR. GIBBONS: Well, it --\nQUESTION: It's not self-executing.\nMR. GIBBONS: It depends on the Geneva\nConvention and on the military regulations duly\nadopted and binding on the military forces of the\nUnited States.\nQUESTION: But isn't that the merits case\nthat you are talking about? I mean, your\njurisdictional argument doesn't depend, as I\nunderstand it, on military regulations or the Geneva\nConvention. It depends on this statute.\nMR. GIBBONS: No. It does not.\nQUESTION: If you get into court, your\nclients may raise Geneva Convention and all sorts of\nthings, but that's not what your case here depends\non.\nMR. GIBBONS: No. Our position is that\nthe Habeas Corpus Statute has meant what it said\nsince 1789.\nQUESTION: I mean, you have to think down\nthe road, is there an alternative to the Geneva\nConvention that is on the substantive claim. I was\nalso thinking, and here I want your view on it, that\nif you have, if they get in the door, and now they\nhave a claim that they are being held without a\ncompetent tribunal assessing it, you get to your\nroute as well by saying that the part about the Fifth\nAmendment in Eisentrager is, in effect, overruled by\nReid v. Covert. And in fact, if you follow Harlan\nand by following Harlan, you apply some kind of due\nprocess, and the Geneva Convention comes in to inform\nthe content of that due process.\nNow, is there an argument there or not?\nMR. GIBBONS: There certainly is, Your\nHonor, but since --\nQUESTION: You're not simply being polite?\nI want to --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GIBBONS: I have more to say about it.\nQUESTION: But you do have the impediment,\nMr. Gibbons, that the D.C. Circuit said it decided\nthe merits as well as jurisdiction, so I think\nJustice O'Connor and Justice Kennedy were asking you\nbefore, well, if you prevail on jurisdiction under\nthat opinion, don't you go out the door immediately\nbecause the D.C. Circuit said, at least as far as the\nConstitution is concerned, nonresident aliens have no\ndue process rights.\nMR. GIBBONS: As far as the Constitution\nis concerned, that's what the District of Columbia\nCircuit said. Now, as to whether or not that's right\n--\nQUESTION: But that's not before us.\nMR. GIBBONS: First of all --\nQUESTION: Whether -- as I take it we ask\nyou to address only the bare jurisdictional question.\nMR. GIBBONS: The bare jurisdictional\nquestion depends on Federal custody simpliciter, and\nthen the Court goes on to decide, is there any legal\nbasis for the government's response to the writ.\nQUESTION: Can I ask this, Mr. Gibbons.\nIf the jurisdictional question rests on Habeas\nStatute simpliciter, without reference to the Geneva\nConvention or any of the other merits points that\nyou've been raising, how then do you answer Justice\nKennedy's question if the merits are out and it\ndoesn't matter whether you are a combatant or\nnoncombatant, is there jurisdiction when somebody is\ncaptured on the field of battle and held immediately\non the field of battle, why wouldn't there be\njurisdiction there? The only answers you give are\nmerits answers, not jurisdictional answers.\nMR. GIBBONS: Your Honor, what I'm\nsuggesting is that whether you call it jurisdiction\nor whether you call it the merits, in the battlefield\nsituation, it's going to go out under Rule 12, in any\nevent.\nQUESTION: But that's, that's quite\ndifferent. I mean, all we are theoretically talking\nabout here is jurisdiction. And the idea that, you\nknow, you have Justice Kennedy's example, a lawful\ncombatant, a declared war, detained at Guantanamo\nmaybe two months after he is captured, and an\naction's brought here in the District of Columbia for\nhabeas corpus and what does a -- what does a judge\nsay when he considers that sort of petition?\nMR. GIBBONS: When he sees that petition,\nhe should dismiss it summarily, whether he dismisses\nit under 12(b)(1) or 12(b)(6), it won't take him any\nmore time. Habeas corpus, as the historians' brief,\nand others among the amici point out, has never run\nto the battlefield, as a matter of habeas corpus\ncommon law. And it is, after all, a common law writ.\nIt has never run to any place except where the\nsovereign issuing the writ has some undisputed\ncontrol.\nQUESTION: Well, suppose at Guantanamo,\nyou still have to summarily dismiss under the\nhypothetical, right?\nMR. GIBBONS: Yes, Justice Kennedy --\nKennedy, and the Court of Appeals did rely on some\nmystical ultimate sovereignty of Cuba over, as we\nNavy types call it, Gitmo, treating the Navy base\nthere as a no law zone. Now, Guantanamo Navy base,\nas I can attest from a year of personal experience,\nis under complete United States control and has been\nfor a century.\nQUESTION: We don't need your personal\nexperience. That's what it says in the treaty. It\nsays complete jurisdiction.\nMR. GIBBONS: That's exactly what it says.\nQUESTION: Complete jurisdictional control.\nMR. GIBBONS: That's exactly what it says\n-- yes.\nQUESTION: Now, it also says Cuba retains\nsovereignty.\nMR. GIBBONS: It does not say that. It\nsays that if the United States decides to surrender\nthe perpetual lease, Cuba has ultimate sovereignty,\nwhatever that means. Now, for lawyers and judges\ndealing with the word sovereignty, it doesn't\nself-define.\nQUESTION: Excuse me. Does it say that,\nCuba has ultimate sovereignty only if the United\nStates decides to surrender?\nMR. GIBBONS: Yes.\nQUESTION: Where would that text be? I\ndid not realize that was there.\nMR. GIBBONS: Perhaps one of my colleagues\ncan find the language in the appendix.\nQUESTION: Why don't you go ahead.\nMR. GIBBONS: But, for example, if one of\nthe detainees here assaulted another detainee in\nGuantanamo, there is no question they would be\nprosecuted under American law because no other law\napplies there. Cuban law doesn't apply there.\nNow, if the test is sovereignty, that term\nmust be given some rational meaning by judges.\nRespondents concede that habeas corpus would extend\nto citizens detained in Guantanamo. That would be no\ninterference with Cuban sovereignty, and extending\nhabeas corpus to noncitizens there is no more an\ninterference with Cuban sovereignty.\nIf there isn't -- if there isn't\nsovereignty over that base where no law applies,\nlegislative, judicial or otherwise, the term has no\nmeaning. Sovereignty for legal purposes must at\nleast mean that some political organization has a\nmonopoly on sanction in that defined geographic area.\nQUESTION: Mr. Gibbons, I'm quoting from\npage 8 of the government's brief, which I assume is\nan accurate quote of the treaty. It doesn't just say\nthat Cuba has sovereignty if we give up the lease.\nIt says the United States -- this is the treaty,\nrecognizes the continuance of the ultimate\nsovereignty of the Republic of Cuba over the leased\narea. Now I take that to mean that they are\nsovereign even during the term of the lease. You may\nsay it's artificial, but there it is.\nMR. GIBBONS: I --\nQUESTION: It's the law of the land, as\nyou say.\nMR. GIBBONS: I misspoke, Justice Scalia,\nby omitting the reference to continuing. But it\ndoesn't make any difference. That continuing\nsovereignty -- Queen Elizabeth is the nominal\nsovereign of Canada. That doesn't determine whether\nor not Canadian courts can grant a writ of habeas\ncorpus. She's also the nominal sovereign of\nAustralia.\nQUESTION: I don't think sovereignty is\nbeing used in the same sense. I mean, it would be a\ngood point if you --\nMR. GIBBONS: Well, that's the point.\nQUESTION: If you said that England was\nsovereign over Canada, and I don't think anybody\nwould say that.\nMR. GIBBONS: But if the reference in the\nlease meant that Cuban law somehow applied in the\nUnited States Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, that would\nbe one thing. But Cuban law has never had any\napplication inside that base. A stamp with Fidel\nCastro's picture on it wouldn't get a letter off the\nbase.\nQUESTION: But you couldn't sublease --\nQUESTION: Mr. Gibbons --\nQUESTION: -- could we -- we couldn't\nsublease Gitmo and we couldn't sell any of Gitmo to a\nforeign country, could we? Why not? Because Cuba is\nsovereign.\nMR. GIBBONS: Well, there are all sorts of\ntreaties in which the United States, or perhaps\nleases in other respects, in which the United States\nknew its own authority, but that doesn't mean that\nthe United States has surrendered its sovereignty.\nQUESTION: Is it like a Federal enclave\nwithin a State? I was trying to think of anything\nthat might be -- resemble this relationship of the\nUnited States to a territory inside another\nterritory?\nMR. GIBBONS: Well, Guantanamo is to some\nextent unique. One of the amicus briefs that surveyed\na United States Navy base elsewhere points out that\nthis is the only base, for example, where the United\nStates has not entered into a status of forces --\nforces agreement.\nIt's not at all clear that we have\nexclusive jurisdiction, civil jurisdiction in any of\nour other enclaves in foreign countries. But we have\nexclusive jurisdiction and control over civil law in\nGuantanamo, and have had for a century. So it's --\nso it's so totally artificial to say that because of\nthis provision in the lease, the executive branch can\ncreate a no law zone where it is not accountable to\nany judiciary, anywhere.\nNow, in some other places where the United\nStates has a base, there may be other civil authority\nthat can demand an accounting. But what the\nexecutive branch is saying here is we don't have to\naccount to anyone, anywhere.\nJustice Breyer, you asked me a question\nbefore, and someone else, that's not unusual,\ninterrupted before I answered you. And to tell you\nthe truth, I don't remember your question at this\npoint.\nQUESTION: I can explore it with the\nSolicitor General possibly.\nMR. GIBBONS: Well, Your Honor, I was also\nasked a question about whether or not aliens had any\nconstitutional rights. In Verdugo, speaking for four\nmembers of the Court at least, Mr. Chief Justice, you\nsaid that Eisentrager stood for the proposition that\n--\nQUESTION: I think I was speaking for\nfive. I think Justice Kennedy joined the opinion.\nMR. GIBBONS: Well, he did. But he wrote\nseparately, I think, and at least cast some doubt on\nwhether or not he agreed with your position that\nthere is no Fifth Amendment right for an alien\noutside the United States.\nNow, of course, that reading of\nEisentrager assumes that it was a decision on the\nmerits and not a jurisdictional decision. But be\nthat as it may, our position, and again, it's not\nnecessary for reversal in this case, and perhaps\nshould not even be addressed because you could avoid\na constitutional decision by making a statutory\ndecision, but our position is that that statement in\nVerdugo is overbroad.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Gibbons.\nGeneral Olson, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SOLICITOR GENERAL THEODORE B. OLSON\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS\nGENERAL OLSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nThe United States is at war. Over 10,000\nAmerican troops are in Afghanistan today in response\nto a virtually unanimous Congressional declaration of\nan unusual and extraordinarily -- extraordinary\nthreat to our national security, and an authorization\nto the President to use all necessary and appropriate\nforce to deter and prevent acts of terrorism against\nthe United States.\nIt's in that context that Petitioners ask\nthis Court to assert jurisdiction that is not\nauthorized by Congress, does not arise from the\nConstitution, has never been exercised by this Court\n--\nQUESTION: Mr. Olson, supposing the war\nhad ended, could you continue to detain these people\non Guantanamo? Would there then be jurisdiction?\nGENERAL OLSON: We believe that there\nwould not be jurisdiction, just --\nQUESTION: So the existence of the war is\nreally irrelevant to the legal issue?\nGENERAL OLSON: It is not irrelevant,\nbecause it is in this context that that question is\nraised, and I would -- the question, the case of\nJohnson vs. Eisentrager, which we have discussed\nhere, even the dissent in that case said that it\nwould be fantastic to assume that habeas corpus\njurisdiction would exist in the time of war. So that\nthat case is not --\nQUESTION: No, but your position does not\ndepend on the existence of a war?\nGENERAL OLSON: It doesn't depend upon\nthat, Justice Stevens, but it's even more forceful.\nAnd more compelling. Because all of the Justices in\nthe Eisentrager case would have held that there was\nno jurisdiction under these circumstances.\nQUESTION: What if one of the Plaintiffs\nwere an American citizen here, but being held in\nGuantanamo.\nGENERAL OLSON: We have not --\nQUESTION: Jurisdiction under Habeas\nStatute?\nGENERAL OLSON: We would acknowledge\njurisdiction. The Court has never --\nQUESTION: Excuse me.\nGENERAL OLSON: We would acknowledge that\nthere would be jurisdiction --\nQUESTION: Why?\nGENERAL OLSON: -- under the Habeas Corpus\nStatute for the reasons that are explained in\nEisentrager itself, that citizenship is a foundation\nfor a relationship between the nation and the\nindividual and a foundation for --\nQUESTION: Is that sufficient to give us\njurisdiction over Guantanamo, which is another\nsovereign?\nGENERAL OLSON: With respect to the\nindividual. We would, we would still argue --\nQUESTION: What if the American citizen\nwas in the middle of the battlefield in Iraq?\nGENERAL OLSON: We would still argue that\nthe jurisdiction under the Habeas Statute would not\nextend under these circumstances to a wartime\nsituation, Justice Stevens, but that the -- what the\nEisentrager Court said, that there is enhanced\nrespect with respect to the power of the Court under\nthe habeas corpus jurisdiction with respect to\nquestions involving citizenship.\nBut what was unquestionable with respect\nto that case is that an alien who had never had any\nrelationship to the United States and who was being\nheld as a result of a combat situation or a war\nsituation in a foreign jurisdiction, there was no\njurisdiction under the Habeas Statute.\nQUESTION: Well, it's clear that there was\nno relief. What do you say to Mr. Gibbons' position\nthat because in fact they did discuss the merits,\nthat case cannot really be taken as authority for\nthe -- leaving Ahrens and Braden aside, that the case\ncannot be taken as authority for the proposition that\nthere is no jurisdiction in the sense of allowing the\nperson through the door to make whatever claim the\nperson wants to make. What is your response to that?\nGENERAL OLSON: Our response to that is\nthroughout the decision in Eisentrager, the Court\nreferred to the question of jurisdiction.\nQUESTION: Oh, it did.\nGENERAL OLSON: It starts --\nQUESTION: I'm really not asking a\nquestion about, frankly, about the Court's\nterminology. I'm asking about the holding in the\ncase.\nGENERAL OLSON: The holding --\nQUESTION: The mere argument is you can't\nsay it held anything more than that there was no\nrelief at the end of the road.\nGENERAL OLSON: It held that there was no\nrelief at the end of the road, because the ultimate\nquestion, to use the words of the Court, the ultimate\nquestion is jurisdiction. The Court over and over\nagain said that we are deciding how far the Habeas\nStatute reaches.\nQUESTION: General Olson, would you look\nat page 777 of the Johnson v. Eisentrager opinion,\nand it says -- this is a hard opinion to fathom, but\nit does say we are here confronted with, and there is\na whole list of things. And one of them is, is an\nenemy alien, and another is, was tried and convicted\nby a military commission sitting outside the United\nStates.\nWhy would the Court think it necessary to\nsay this is what we confronted in this case which\nmakes it worlds different from our case, where there\nhas been no trial and conviction, where these people\nare saying, and we must accept for the moment that\nit's true, that they are innocents. That they are\nnot combatants of any kind.\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, those were\nunquestionably facts that related to the case, that\nrelated to the facts that came to the Court, but in\nthe very next paragraph, the Court goes on to say\nthat we have pointed out that the privilege of\nlitigation has been extended to aliens whether\nfriendly or enemy, that specifically addresses one of\nthe points you mentioned, only because permitting\ntheir presence in the country implied protection.\nAnd the Court went on to say, no such\nbasis can be invoked here for these prisoners at no\nrelevant time were within any territory over which\nthe United States is sovereign, and the scenes of\ntheir offense, their capture, their trial and their\npunishment were all beyond the territorial\njurisdiction of the United States.\nAnd earlier in that --\nQUESTION: Their trial and their\npunishment. This is a completed episode. This is a\nvery difficult decision to understand. I would say\nit's at least ambiguous.\nGENERAL OLSON: It seems to me -- it seems\nto me that those statements all have to be read in\nthe context -- context of the Court saying the\nultimate question is jurisdiction.\nQUESTION: But it was so unnecessary to\nsay, to give that list that appears on page 777.\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, I suspect that there\nare many decisions of this Court where, when the\nCourt is dealing with the facts of a specific case,\nespecially in the context of a Court of Appeals\ndecision, if the Court were to turn to the briefs\nthat were written before to present the issue in this\nCourt, the only -- the question presented, submitted\nin this case, in this Court, in Eisentrager was the\njurisdiction under the Habeas Statute. But the case\narose in the context where the Court of --\nQUESTION: Was it really -- was it really\nunder the Habeas Statute or under the Constitution?\nGENERAL OLSON: It was --\nQUESTION: Because if the, if the views of\nthe dissenters in Ahrens against Clark were the law\nat that time as they perhaps are now, then there\nwould have been statutory jurisdiction, which was not\npresent at that time.\nGENERAL OLSON: But the Court was\nspecifically focusing on the jurisdictional incidents\nattached to the condition of the individual --\nQUESTION: But the Eisentrager Court never\nonce mentioned the statute, the Habeas Statute in its\nopinion. What it seemed to do was to reach the\nmerits and say at the end of the day, these people\nhave no rights. They have had a trial under the\nmilitary tribunal and they have no rights that could\nbe granted at the end of the day, and no mention of\nthe Habeas Statute.\nGENERAL OLSON: The Court specifically did\nsay, but did not mention the statute, Justice\nO'Connor, but the statute is mentioned throughout the\nbriefs, in the government's brief when it says what\n-- the statute at issue, the Habeas Corpus Statute\nand within its territory, the language of Part A.\nThe statute that exists today is the same statute\nthat the Eisentrager Court was considering.\nQUESTION: Well, the briefs may have\nmentioned it, but wasn't the problem that Eisentrager\nhad to confront, the problem created by Ahrens,\nconstruing respective jurisdiction, and therefore,\nthe only way there could be habeas jurisdiction in\nEisentrager was if due process demanded it.\nAnd the Court went on to say, well, there\nare various reasons why there is no ultimate due\nprocess entitlement, and therefore, due process does\nnot demand entertainment of jurisdiction.\nAfter Braden, that argument is gone. Why,\ntherefore, is Eisentrager not undercut to the point\nwhere it's no further authority on the jurisdictional\npoint?\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, it seems to me again\nthe entire opinion has to be taken in context. The\nCourt did specifically say that there is no statutory\nauthority. It didn't say, it didn't identify by\nnumber a provision of the code, but it specifically\nsaid no statutory authority.\nQUESTION: The reason it said that was\nbecause Ahrens was then the law.\nQUESTION: Yeah.\nQUESTION: And that was very clear in the\nCourt of Appeals opinion. They rested their decision\nsolely on the Constitution.\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, Justice Stevens, I\nsubmit that in the context of the case, in the\ncontext of the way the dissent understood it, as well\nas the majority understood it --\nQUESTION: Yes, but the fact case was --\nthe case was decided when the majority view in Ahrens\nwas the law, and that is no longer the law.\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, we would submit that\nAhrens, the over -- partial overruling, I think, has\nbeen pointed out before. Ahrens has no effect on the\nvitality of the Eisentrager case. The Court made\nclear that it was deciding -- and everyone -- the\nreason I mentioned the briefs is the context in which\nthe case was presented to the Court, and argued to\nthe Court and the decision that was made by the\nmajority in the Court, focusing on the identity of\nthe Petitioner, whether alien or friendly.\nJustice Black in his dissenting opinion\nsays this decision would apply to whether someone was\nhostile or not, and the entire context of the case,\nJustice Stevens, it seems to me, and does not --\nQUESTION: The context of the case was it\nwas decided at a time when Ahrens against Clark was\nthe law. And if the dissenting opinion in Ahrens\nagainst Clark had been the law, it would have been\ndecided differently.\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, it seems to me that\na fair reading of the case goes much further than\nthat, because the Court was not focusing on that. It\ndidn't specify that it was making its decision on\nthat basis. It did specify over and over again, and\nthe dissent referred to this as well, that it was\nfocusing on the fact that the individuals bringing\nthe petition had no sufficient contacts with the\nUnited States. That's in part why the Court\ndistinguished --\nQUESTION: And that's a complete response\nto an argument resting entirely on the Constitution.\nQUESTION: Did it cite Ahrens?\nGENERAL OLSON: It did not, as I'm --\nQUESTION: I don't recall.\nGENERAL OLSON: I don't recall that it\ndid. The District Court --\nQUESTION: Kind of extraordinary if it was\nrelying entirely on that --\nGENERAL OLSON: The District Court relied\nupon that decision. The Court of Appeals went much\nfurther with respect to -- in fact, the Court, and\nthis Court, Justice Jackson's opinion for the Court\nin this case specifically points out that the Court\nof Appeals went back to something it called\nfundamentals, because it couldn't find any authority\nin either the statute or the Constitution.\nQUESTION: Well, didn't the Johnson\nopinion also say, we don't have to concern ourselves\nhere with the proper custodian. We kind of finesse\nthat point?\nGENERAL OLSON: I believe that's a correct\ncharacterization. What -- the other portion of the\ndecision that it seems to me important to recognize\nis that this is a decision that was widely perceived,\nand has been consistently perceived, as a definition\nof the scope of the Habeas Statute. Going back to\nthe early 1800s, this Court decided that the extent\nof habeas jurisdiction arose from the statute, not\nfrom the common law.\nQUESTION: That gets me back to your\nstatement that if this had been a citizen held in\nGuantanamo, that habeas would be available. But the\nstatute doesn't talk about citizens. It says\nprisoners held under the authority of the United\nStates. Now, if the citizen can say that he is a\nprisoner held under the authority of the United\nStates in Guantanamo, why couldn't a noncitizen under\nthe statute say the same thing?\nGENERAL OLSON: I think, Justice Kennedy,\nthe answer to that is, in the first place, we are\nnot, we are not saying that there necessarily would\nbe jurisdiction there, but we are saying that the\nCourt -- that the Court would go further with respect\nto that because, and this is also in Eisentrager and\na number of other Court's -- of this Court's\ndecisions, that the Court will find more protection\nfor citizens as a result of the relationship going\nback --\nQUESTION: Well, but the only way we can\ndo it --\nQUESTION: I don't, I don't mean to\nmisconstrue it or to misstate it, I had thought you\nsaid at the outset that if this had been a citizen of\nthe United States held in Guantanamo, there would be\nhabeas corpus.\nGENERAL OLSON: We are not -- we are\nsaying that we would not be contesting it, Justice\nKennedy, and the Court will be dealing with other\nissues involving citizens.\nQUESTION: You don't have to contest the\njurisdictional objection. If there is no\njurisdiction, there is no jurisdiction, whether you\ncontest it or not.\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, I guess the only way\nI can answer this, Justice Stevens, is to say that\nwhat the Court seemed to say, not only in the\nmajority opinion, but in the dissenting opinion, that\nmore rights would be given to citizens --\nQUESTION: No, but there are no rights\nthat can be recognized unless there is jurisdiction\nin the first place. And if the Court is going to\nmake good on what you have just said it said, it has\ngot to do so presupposing jurisdiction. So if you\nare going to rely upon those statements, don't you\nnecessarily have to concede jurisdiction?\nGENERAL OLSON: I don't --\nQUESTION: With respect to the citizen?\nDoesn't make any difference if they have got lots of\nrights if there is no jurisdiction to get into a\ncourt to enforce them.\nGENERAL OLSON: I think that the answer is\nthat that does not necessarily follow. The Court has\nnot reached that decision yet, and that's something\nthat is not before the Court.\nQUESTION: Certainly the argument is\navailable that in that situation, the Constitution\nrequires jurisdiction. The Constitution requires\nthat an American citizen who has the protection of\nthe Constitution have some manner of vindicating his\nrights under the Constitution. That would be the\nargument.\nGENERAL OLSON: I agree with that, justice\nScalia, and this Court has said again and again that\n--\nQUESTION: And that was part of his\nargument in Eisentrager.\nGENERAL OLSON: And it was -- and in that\ncase, the Court specifically said the Fifth Amendment\ndid not extend to the Petitioners in that case. The\nCourt has said that again in the Verdugo case in\nterms of the Fourth Amendment.\nQUESTION: Is that your answer to Justice\nKennedy, that there would be jurisdiction because due\nprocess would require it for citizens, but there\nwould not be statutory jurisdiction in the case of\nthe citizen at Guantanamo?\nGENERAL OLSON: I think it would be an\ninterpretation. And what this Court is doing is\ninterpreting the statute because the Habeas Corpus\nStatute defines the extent of rights --\nQUESTION: Well, but what is the\nposition -- I mean, I want to know what the position\nof the United States is for the same reason Justice\nKennedy does.\nGENERAL OLSON: Our answer to that\nquestion, Justice Souter, is that citizens of the\nUnited States, because of their constitutional\ncircumstances, may have greater rights with respect\nto the scope and reach of the Habeas Statute as the\nCourt has or would interpret it. That case has never\ncome before this Court, and it's important to\nemphasize that --\nQUESTION: You go outside of the statutory\nlanguage for your case that's in front of us.\nGENERAL OLSON: Excuse me, Justice --\nQUESTION: You are going outside of the\nstatutory language to resolve both the hypothetical\ncase and the case in front of us. This is a\nprisoner, and he is detained under the authority of\nthe United States.\nGENERAL OLSON: And this Court construed\nthose provisions in the Eisentrager case and\ndetermined that the statute did not reach aliens that\ndid have no contact with the United States and were\nheld in a foreign jurisdiction outside the\nsovereignty of the United States.\nQUESTION: It did not construe the\nstatute. It assumed the statute was inapplicable and\nconcluded that the Constitution was not a substitute\nfor the statute.\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, Justice Stevens, I\nrespectfully disagree. I think the Court was\nconstruing the statute not to be applicable, then it\nwent on because the Court of Appeals had addressed\nthe constitutional question.\nQUESTION: Not a word, not a word in the\nopinion that supports it.\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, I respectfully\ndisagree. The Court does say, we don't find any\nauthority in the statute. We don't find any\nauthority in the Constitution. We will not go to\nso-called fundamentals to find it someplace else.\nThat is consistent with what this Court decided in\nthe --\nQUESTION: Well, it's obvious that there\nis language in Eisentrager that supports you, obvious\nto me, but you have just heard that judges don't\nalways distinguish between 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), not\neven in this Court, at least we don't always get it\nright. And there is also language, as you have\nheard, that's against you. I think there is some in\nthere.\nSo what I'm thinking now, assuming that\nit's very hard to interpret Eisentrager, is that if\nwe go with you, it has a virtue of clarity. There is\na clear rule. Not a citizen, outside the United\nStates, you don't get your foot in the door. But\nagainst you is that same fact.\nIt seems rather contrary to an idea of a\nConstitution with three branches that the executive\nwould be free to do whatever they want, whatever they\nwant without a check. That's problem one.\nProblem two is that we have several\nhundred years of British history where the cases\ninterpreting habeas corpus said to the contrary\nanyway. And then we have the possibility of really\nhelping you with what you're really worried about,\nwhich is undue court interference by shaping the\nsubstantive right to deal with all those problems of\nthe military that led you to begin your talk by\nreminding us of those problems.\nSo if it's that choice, why not say, sure,\nyou get your foot in the door, prisoners in\nGuantanamo, and we'll use the substantive rights to\nwork out something that's protective but practical.\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, Justice Breyer,\nthere are several answers to that. You started with\nthe proposition that there was no check and that the\nexecutive is asserting no check. This is the\ninterpretation of the scope of a Habeas Statute.\nCongress had -- has had 54 years with full awareness\nof the decision to change it.\nIndeed, as we point out in our brief,\neight months after the Eisentrager decision, a bill\nwas introduced that would have changed that statute,\nH.R. 2812, which would specifically have changed the\nstatute to deal with the Eisentrager situation, so\nthere is a check.\nQUESTION: It could have been just a\nclarifying, General Olson. As you well know, the\nfact that a bill was introduced and not passed\ncarries very little weight on what law that exists\nmeans.\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, I understand that,\nbut the bill was -- came eight months after\nEisentrager.\nQUESTION: You're not using it to say what\nthe law was. You're using it to show that there was\navailable, and is available, a perfectly good check\nupon the executive branch. If the people think that\nthis is unfair, if Congress thinks it's unfair, with\na stroke of the pen, they can change the Habeas\nStatute.\nGENERAL OLSON: That's precisely correct.\nAnd they had a bill before them eight months after\nthe Eisentrager decision which had -- that Congress\nproceeded on it. Congress has also dealt with the\nHabeas Statute in a variety of other ways. It has\nseen fit in no way to change the decision required by\nthis Court with respect to the statute.\nYou mentioned several hundred years of\nBritish history was your second point. All of those\ncases, or virtually all of those same cases that have\nbeen brought up in the briefs, and the amicus briefs\ntoday, were in the briefs that were before the\nEisentrager --\nQUESTION: I grant you this. My question\nhas to assume that Eisentrager is ambiguous and not\nclearly determinative. But then on that assumption,\nI'm still honestly most worried about the fact that\nthere would be a large category of unchecked and\nuncheckable actions dealing with the detention of\nindividuals that are being held in a place where\nAmerica has power to do everything.\nNow, that's what's worrying me because of\nArticle III, and the other thing on the opposite\nside, as I said, is it's possible to tailor the\nsubstance to take care of the problems that are\nworrying you. Those are my two basic points.\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, let me get back to\nit again. Those earlier cases were decided and\nrejected in Eisen -- in the Eisentrager case.\nWhether there is a check on the executive, there is a\nCongressional check through the power of legislation,\nthrough the power of oversight, through the power of\nappropriations. There is --\nQUESTION: Can we hold hearings to\ndetermine the problems that are bothering you? I\nmean, we have to take your word for what the problems\nare. We can't call witnesses and see what the real\nproblems are, can we, in creating this new\nsubstantive rule that we are going to let the courts\ncreate. Congress could do all that, though, couldn't\nit?\nGENERAL OLSON: Congress could do all that\n--\nQUESTION: If it wanted to change the\nHabeas Statute, it could make all sorts of refined\nmodifications.\nGENERAL OLSON: Yes, it could --\nQUESTION: About issues that we know\nnothing whatever about, because we have only lawyers\nbefore us. We have no witnesses. We have no\ncross-examination, we have no investigative staff.\nAnd we should be the ones, Justice Breyer suggests,\nto draw up this reticulated system to preserve our\nmilitary from intervention by the courts.\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, we would agree with\nthat and we would emphasize the point that stepping\nacross that line would be impossible to go back from\nwith respect to prisoners in the battlefield. In\nfact, the reply brief refers to the front lines in\nIraq, in a battle station in Iraq. We are talking\nhere about battlefield decisions and --\nQUESTION: The battlefield, I might, since\n-- all I mean by working out the substantive rights\nis what Justice Harlan meant and what Justice Kennedy\nmeant in adopting Justice Harlan's view in Verdugo.\nAnd that really derives from the insular cases, and I\ndon't think it's something that requires witnesses\nand reticulated whatever they are, tax cuts.\n(Laughter.)\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, to the extent that\nthe Court would say, the executive, you must give a\nmilitary process because the Petitioners in this\ncase, first of all, demanded in their petition and\nthey would have a right to raise these issues to the\nextent they have not backed off in this case, but\nthey demanded in their petition, their release,\nunmonitored communications with counsel, cessation of\ninterrogations, evidentiary hearings.\nQUESTION: Wasn't it --\nQUESTION: Our, our doctrine would have to\nbe applied in the first instance by 800 different\ndistrict judges, I take it.\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, there is no question\nthat that is exactly right. And to the extent that\nwhat the Petitioners are seeking is to oversee the\ncircumstances -- this is the language in their brief,\nto oversee the circumstances of detention. That is\ngoing to vary from case to case.\nQUESTION: General Olson, I have looked at\nthe reply brief, which is the last chance to say what\nthey mean. And they say we are not asking for any of\nthose things, and certainly not asking to have a\nlawyer there while these people are being\ninterrogated.\nThey are saying, look, we are claiming\nthat our people are innocents. And for purposes of\nthis proceeding, we must assume that. And all we\nwant is some process to determine whether they are\nindeed innocent, and it doesn't have to be a court\nprocess.\nGENERAL OLSON: But Justice Ginsburg, the\nrelief that I was articulating is what they asked for\nin the first instance. If they have jurisdiction in\nthis Court, the next Petitioner doesn't have to say\nwell, I only want a process. And if they only\nwant -- now they are saying they only want an\nexecutive branch process to review. As we\nexplained --\nQUESTION: But to go back to the\njurisdiction, so I understand really what your\nargument is. Would this be entirely different, as\nfar as their jurisdiction is concerned, if we were\ntalking about -- if the people were prisoners on\nEllis Island or in Puerto Rico?\nGENERAL OLSON: Yes, we would. Because we\nare talking about territorial sovereign jurisdiction\nof the United States. What -- what exists in\nGuantanamo is no different than existed in Lansberg\nPrison and --\nQUESTION: Why is that, why is that\ncrucial? I mean, it's not crucial, I take it, under\nthe respective jurisdiction clause of 2241. Is it\ncrucial under the Due Process Clause?\nGENERAL OLSON: It is, it is the line that\nthis Court drew and repeatedly articulated --\nQUESTION: But why is it a good line? I\nmean, what is -- what is the justification?\nGENERAL OLSON: Because it is a line that\nis, is -- has the virtue of what Justice Breyer was\ntalking about, of having relative certainty. It is a\nline that's defined by State to State relationships.\nQUESTION: Why does it have complete\njurisdiction? No one else has jurisdiction.\nComplete jurisdiction of satisfactory lines.\nGENERAL OLSON: Well, the complete\njurisdiction is a phrase in that lease, the lease\nspecifically says that ultimate sovereignty is\nCuba's. It specifically says that the United States\n--\nQUESTION: How many years have we been\noperating in Guantanamo with Cuban law never\napplying?\nGENERAL OLSON: With respect -- the lease\nrestricts the ability of the United States to use\nthat property for only Naval or coaling purposes. It\nspecifically says it may not be used for any other\npurpose.\nQUESTION: General Olson, there is a whole\nother issue in this case which you have not addressed\nand I don't think your brief much addressed it.\nThere is also a claim of jurisdiction under Section\n1331 in the Administrative Procedure Act. Will you\nsay at least a few words about what your response to\nthat is? I don't even see the APA cited in your\nbrief.\nGENERAL OLSON: What is cited in the\nbrief, and we explain that the President is not an\nagency under the APA, that the United States military\nwith respect to operations and military operations\nare specifically exempted by the APA.\nQUESTION: That goes to the merits.\nGENERAL OLSON: And that the fundamental\nnature of what the Petitioners are seeking here is\nthe review of the nature and status of their\ndetention, which sounds in -- and is examined by this\nCourt repeatedly under the doctrine of habeas corpus.\nAnd that there is no foundation. In fact, I submit\nthat the way the briefs have been written, the\nPetitioners don't even feel strongly about the APA\nposition.\nWhat they are talking about, and why most\nof their briefs explain, they are focusing on\nfundamental habeas corpus as it existed throughout\nthe centuries. What is important to emphasize here\nwith respect to all of these questions, with respect\nto, well, how much control would there be, how much\ncontrol would there be in Guantanamo versus a place\nin Afghanistan or another place --\nQUESTION: No, I think Guantanamo, everyone\nagrees, is an animal, there is no other like it. The\nclosest would be the Canal Zone, I suppose.\nGENERAL OLSON: The Canal Zone was treated\ndifferently by Congress. Congress created, applied,\nunder its responsibility with respect to territorial\nand insular or unincorporated territory, applied laws\nthere, put a court there. So it's very different\nthan the Canal Zone.\nQUESTION: Why isn't this like, as I asked\nMr. Gibbons, a Federal enclave within a State?\nGENERAL OLSON: Because it is -- because\nit is a -- in the first place, the question of\nsovereignty is a political decision. It would be\nremarkable for the judiciary to start deciding where\nthe United States is sovereign and where the United\nStates has control --\nQUESTION: The word is physical control,\npower.\nGENERAL OLSON: We have that, Justice\nGinsburg, in every place where we would put military\ndetainees, in a field of combat where there are\nprisons in Afghanistan where we have complete control\nwith respect to the circumstances.\nQUESTION: But those -- Afghanistan is not\na place where American law is, and for a century, has\ncustomarily been applied to all aspects of life. We\neven protect the Cuban iguana. We bring -- in\nbringing people from Afghanistan or wherever they\nwere brought to Guantanamo, we are doing in\nfunctional terms exactly what we would do if we\nbrought them to the District of Columbia, in a\nfunctional sense, leaving aside the metaphysics of\nultimate sovereignty.\nIf the metaphysics of ultimate sovereignty\ndo not preclude us from doing what we have been doing\nfor the last 100 years, why is it a bar to the\nexercise of judicial jurisdiction under the Habeas\nStatute?\nGENERAL OLSON: The Court actually heard a\ncase, Neely vs. Henkel, in 1901, which specifically\naddressed that, and held that the United States did\nnot have sovereignty for the enforcement of its laws\nin Guantanamo. And at that point --\nQUESTION: We've been doing a pretty good\njob of it since then, am I right?\nGENERAL OLSON: With respect to a certain\narea, a military base in Germany, a military base in\nAfghanistan, the United States must have and does\nexercise relatively complete control. Every argument\nthat's being made here today could be made by the two\nmillion persons that were in custody at the end of\nWorld War II, and judges would have to decide the\ncircumstances of their detention, whether there had\nbeen adequate military process, what control existed\nover the territory in which they were being kept.\nWhat this is --\nQUESTION: Are you saying that there is no\nstatutory regime that applies to Guantanamo which is\ndifferent from the statutory or legal regime that\napplied to occupied territories after World War II or\nindeed that applies to territory under the control of\nthe American military in Afghanistan or Iraq?\nGENERAL OLSON: There is a great deal of\ndifferences in connection with every area over which\nthe United States has some degree of control. The\ndegree of control that it has here is limited to\nspecific purposes in -- with respect to the\nsovereignty of Cuba.\nQUESTION: Thank you, General Olson. The\ncase is submitted.\n(Whereupon, at 11:02 a.m., the case in the\nabove-entitled matter was submitted.)\n"
