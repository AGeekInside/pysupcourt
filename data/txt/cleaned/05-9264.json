        "content": "(10:04 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst this morning in James versus United States.\nMr. Crawford?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CRAIG L. CRAWFORD, ESQ.\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. CRAWFORD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nWe confront today the Eleventh Circuit's\ntroubling interpretation of the otherwise clause of the\nArmed Career Criminal Act. Under the text and structure\nof the act, as well as the categorical approach that this\nCourt recognized in Shepard and Taylor, Florida\nattempted burglary convictions should not qualify as\nthey -- these types of convictions do not involve\nexplicitly, implicitly or even inherently, a serious\npotential risk of physical injury to another.\nThe Respondent in their brief has enunciated\na test to determine whether a conviction should qualify,\nand that test that they enunciate is basically a\ndistrict court judge or a sentencing judge uses their\ncommon sense and experience to determine whether an\noffense should qualify. That type of test is not the\nkind of test that this Court enunciated in Taylor and\nShepard when it looked at the very elemental approach at\ndetermining whether convictions should qualify.\nThe categorical approach that this Court\nenunciated refers to predicate offenses in terms not of\nprior conduct but of prior convictions and the elements\nof those crimes.\nAs such, the Government's argument would\nopen up a -- is a broad mandate that courts could use to\nbring in almost any type of crime, any kind of felony to\nbe included within the Armed Career Criminal Act. For\ninstance, simple possession of cocaine is a third-degree\nfelony in Florida. It's a five-year statutory maximum.\nUnder the serious drug offense that Congress enumerated,\nit would only qualify if it had a 10-year statutory\nmaximum and it involved the distribution of drugs. Yet,\nif the Government's approach to the interpretation of\nthe otherwise clause is to be used, that simple\npossession of cocaine could qualify if a judge using\ntheir common sense and everyday experience determines it\npresents a serious potential risk of physical\ninjury to another. Obviously --\nJUSTICE ALITO: If we were looking at\nattempted generic burglary of a residence, wouldn't that\ninvolve conduct that presents the serious potential risk\nof physical injury to another?\nMR. CRAWFORD: Your Honor, in Taylor, this\nCourt was clear that under enumerated burglary or\ngeneric burglary, the offense becomes a -- has that\nserious potential risk when the person actually enters\nthe dwelling or enters the structure; and under an\nattempted burglary, at least in Florida and in most\nother States, that act has not occurred. You haven't\nentered, the defendant has not entered the property.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If the would-be burglar is\nclimbing through the window or on a ladder with the\nintent to climb through the window, wouldn't that\ninvolve almost the same risk or maybe the same risk?\nMR. CRAWFORD: If the conduct -- again,\nwe're looking at, then, a fact-based inquiry.\nObviously, some attempted burglaries could get that far.\nOther attempted burglaries are caught well before that\nactually occurs. But if you were to say that the\nattempted burglary was climbing up a ladder trying to\nget into the place and the person actually didn't get\nin, again, under Taylor, it says the risk is when the\nperson enters. The risk is much less outside the\ndwelling than inside the dwelling.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But in Florida, that\nwould be burglary itself, right, because it covers the\ncurtilage around the house?\nMR. CRAWFORD: The curtilage is a unique\nconcept, I guess in Florida, in that the curtilage is the\nenclosed space around the house that has some kind of\nenclosure, whether by fence or whether by bushes. So if\nthe place was enclosed and you had a ladder going up to\nthe residence, that would actually be a burglary within\nthe State of Florida. In other States, it may not.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. And we don't\neven have to ask whether that presents a serious\npotential risk under the statute, right? Because, if\nburglary is identified as -- a predicate offense without\nthe need to resort to the definition?\nMR. CRAWFORD: Well, it would be a burglary\nin the State of Florida, but under the test enunciated\nin Taylor, it wouldn't qualify because Taylor was very\nspecific. It is the entering a dwelling or structure.\nAnd in Florida, you could be guilty of a burglary\nwithout entering a structure or dwelling, just like in a\ncurtilage burglary.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you could do it in a\nnoncurtilage burglary State simply by putting the\nladder up to the window and getting on the first rung of\nthe ladder. I mean, you would have -- you would have taken\na substantial step. You would have made an attempt. Now\nwhy would that not qualify under the words of the\nstatute that referred to a potential risk? Haven't you\ncreated the potential for the risk of harm that the\nstatute is getting at when you take the substantial\nstep?\nMR. CRAWFORD: Well, trying to use the\nCourt's words in Taylor, Taylor talked about that --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, how about my question\nfirst?\nMR. CRAWFORD: Okay.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, haven't you in the\nwords of the statute, created the potential for the risk\nwhen you take that substantial step by starting up the\nladder?\nMR. CRAWFORD: If you started up the ladder\nand that's the way the attempted burglary conviction\ncame down, it would be a lot closer call to say that\nwould be a potential risk. Whether it's a serious\npotential risk under Taylor, it is not as clear.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you wouldn't analyze it\non the basis of whether this defendant started up the\nladder. As I understand, you would -- you have to\nanalyze it on the basis of whether generically attempted\nburglary as a whole presents a serious enough risk;\nisn't that the way it has to be done?\nMR. CRAWFORD: That's the way that we submit\nit has to be done, and you wouldn't be getting to those\nfacts.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but I thought your\nargument was that that analysis would not lead to the\nresult unfavorable to your client because the nature of\nstarting up the ladder did not create or could not\nreasonably be seen as creating this kind of risk.\nIn other words, I thought you were saying --\nmaybe I misunderstood your argument -- that the reason\nthe Taylor analysis favors you is that merely taking a\nsubstantial step -- which is what the indictment would\ncharge -- could not be seen as creating the potential\nrisk that the statute talks about.\nNow if I'm not understanding your argument\ncorrectly, you know, straighten me out here.\nMR. CRAWFORD: I think I understand. That\nsubstantial step in even taking a step up the ladder,\nMr. James would submit based on the language of the\nstatute, would not qualify and would not create that\nserious potential risk of physical injury.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And that's why simply\ncharging attempted burglary will never satisfy the\nstatute under a Taylor analysis as you understand it.\nMR. CRAWFORD: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But even if it would,\nthat's only one manner of attempt. And it seems to me,\nif you're going to do it generically, you have to look\nover the whole scope of possible attempts and say does\nthe whole scope of possible attempts bear, I would say,\na similar risk of the use of physical force as do the\nspecifically mentioned crimes of burglary, arson or\nextortion? Indeed, I guess you have to use the least\ndangerous. Wouldn't you say extortion is probably, of\nthose mentioned crimes, burglary, arson, extortion, or\nthe use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct.\nNow that \"otherwise\", that refers me back to the crimes\nalready mentioned, and I would say that means that the\nunnamed crime has to have a similar risk, at least a\nrisk as high as the least dangerous of the crimes\nmentioned, which I would take to be extortion.\nWouldn't you say?\nMR. CRAWFORD: Of those four, extortion does\nseem to potentially have the least risk of all those\ncrimes enumerated. But --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And what's a potential\nrisk, by the way?\nMR. CRAWFORD: A potential risk --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: A potential potential? I\nmean, every risk is potential, isn't it?\nMR. CRAWFORD: In the Government's -- in the\nRespondent's brief, they talked about how risk and\npotential and serious, some of those worlds potentially\nknock each other out, and I apologize for using that\nvery word, but --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You think potential risk is\njust risk really?\nMR. CRAWFORD: I think it is a risk.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But isn't one way of\nlooking at it -- I mean, I, when I read it, you know, I\nthought it's just redundant. But it may very well be\nthat the word potential is in there in order to\naccommodate attempts.\nMR. CRAWFORD: If that were true, I mean,\nCongress when they wrote the statute, and in\n924(e)(2)(B)(ii), or (e)(2)(B)(ii)(1), they specifically\nenumerated attempted crimes to qualify under that\nviolence. So it has an element, use of or attempted use\nof, or threatened use of physical force. But under\nprong two, they specifically deleted that word\n\"attempt\".\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Specifically deleted\nor didn't --\nMR. CRAWFORD: They did not include it, and\nunder --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's quite\ndifferent than specifically deleting it. In other\nwords, it was never there in the proposal.\nMR. CRAWFORD: In 1984 actually, there was a\nproposal where burglary would qualify and attempted\nburglary would qualify. That was passed by the Senate,\nnever passed by the House, never enacted.\nSo later on when burglary was actually\ndefined, burglary was defined as the type of burglary\nthat Taylor came close to defining the same way.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, do I understand\nyour submission to be that putting a ladder against the\nside of a house to attempt burglary, starting up the\nladder, that that generically does not pose a potential\nrisk of physical injury?\nMR. CRAWFORD: If that were the only way to\nprove an attempted burglary within a State, if that\nwould be -- that would be the requirement, the legal\nrequirement that you have to put the ladder against the\nhouse and that's an element of the offense, that to me\nwould be a much closer call; but still, under the\nanalysis that we have provided the Court with the\nRussello presumption, it should not qualify. But it is\na closer case.\nWhereas categorically when you look at\nattempted burglaries, the putting the ladder against the\nside of the house is an element of the offense.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We understand from\nyour friend on the other side that an overt act toward\nfulfilling the attempt is required under Florida law.\nIn other words, it's not just enough to have burglary\ntools in your house.\nMR. CRAWFORD: Correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You've got to take\nan affirmative step toward accomplishing the burglary.\nMR. CRAWFORD: It is an overt act that is\nbeyond mere thinking about it.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why doesn't anybody -- you\nknow, count. It sounds to me if you're wondering about\nwhether there's a specific serious risk of harm, you could\nfind out. Look at the conviction that in Florida for\nattempted burglary, look at the convictions for burglary,\nand see if the harm involved, the number of cases in which\npeople are harmed is roughly similar. We have all these\nlaw professors who like statistics. Now they like law in\neconomics and everything. So why don't they go out\nthere and count, and then we'd actually know, instead of\nsitting here and trying to figure out something I know\nnothing about. I've never been involved in a lot of\nburglaries. I don't know how the burglaries operate. I\nsuspect some people are hurt, but rather than my\nsuspicion why don't we find out what the facts are?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: We're not going to be\nable to do that in time to decide this case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But wouldn't it be, as a\nmethod of approaching --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It would also keep the\nprofessors from other mischief.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But what do we know about\nthe dimensions of the Florida attempt crime? For\nexample, you have said it doesn't mean that you possess\nburglary tools. Does it mean or does it exclude casing\nthe house, walking up and down the street, around the\nblock?\nWhen is a step substantial enough to\nconstitute an attempt under Florida law?\nMR. CRAWFORD: Well, it's not really a step\nanalysis, a substantial step analysis. It is an overt\nact. It's some overt act manifesting your intent to\nactually --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What is that concretely?\nIt's not possessing burglar's tools, it's not casing the\nplace. What qualifies as an overt act that would make\none guilty of the crime of attempted burglary?\nMR. CRAWFORD: If you had a diagram of the\nperson's house and you had burglary tools in your car\nand you had maybe even called to make sure the business\nwas closed and you were driving there and as you're\ndriving there you're telling the person sitting beside\nyou: I'm going to break into that, you know, business\nat 254 Main Street. That would be enough under Florida\nlaw to convict someone for attempted burglary of a\nstructure.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I guess we have to decide\nhow many attempts involve that kind of initial action,\nwhich doesn't seem very physical threatening, and how\nmany of them involve putting a ladder up against the\nside of the house.\nHow do we possibly figure that out, to\ndecide whether as a whole the degree of risk from\nattempted burglary is as high as at least the degree of\nrisk from extortion?\nMR. CRAWFORD: That may be -- that may be a\nvery difficult question to answer, and maybe the\nRespondent had that obligation in the district court,\nbecause they have the obligation to prove that this\nenhancement has that substantial or that serious\npotential risk of physical injury to another and of\ncourse they didn't do that. But if you look back in\nthis Court's decision in 1985 in Tennessee versus\nGarner, this Court was talking about completed\nburglaries and it talked about physical violence to a\nperson would only occur in a rare case, and it gave the\npercentage I think of 3.6 or 3.8 percent of the time.\nBut that's in a completed burglary. That's\nnot even talking about an attempted burglary, what's the\nrisk --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you this\nquestion: It seems to me there are two ways to read the\nburglary, arson or extortion examples: That they are\nclear examples of crimes that would involve harm to\nindividuals, physical injury to another; or they are put\nin the statute to say, even though they don't involve\nserious risk, these specific crimes will be covered,\nbecause your statistic of 3 percent suggests that\nburglary itself probably would not qualify as a crime\nthat presents a serious risk of physical injury, but the\nstatute nevertheless defines it.\nSo do you read those terms as giving\nexamples of crimes that would not involve that risk of\ninjury or as examples of crimes that would?\nMR. CRAWFORD: I think it can be read either\nway, although I think even the Government's brief in\n-- or the Respondent's brief in Taylor talks about\nextortion and burglary being crimes that can be\ncommitted with no risk of physical injury to another\nperson and yet Congress still specifically\nenumerated those --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Crawford, if you had\nthat meaning in mind, you would not have used the word\n\"otherwise\". You would have simply said is burglary,\narson or extortion, involves the use of explosives, or\ninvolves conduct that presents a serious potential risk.\nThe other purpose of the \"otherwise,\" which means in\nsome other manner, some other manner -- other from what?\nOther from the preceding ones.\nI don't think there is any sensible way to\nread it except, you know, in some other manner than\nthese previously named crimes involves a physical risk;\nand that is what causes me to say, well, what's the\nleast dangerous of the previously mentioned crimes, and\nany crime you want to get into this residual category\nhas to be at least as dangerous as that. As I've said,\nI think that's extortion.\nMR. CRAWFORD: Using that analysis, it's\nhard to figure out, but again the Government had this\nobligation or we submit the Government had this\nobligation, and they've not shown an attempted burglary\nto be any more dangerous.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think that,\nis conspiracy to commit burglary a crime that poses a\nserious potential risk as burglary does?\nMR. CRAWFORD: In Florida, or in the\nEleventh Circuit, they have determined that conspiracy\nto commit enumerated offenses do present that serious\npotential risk.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Sorry, go ahead.\nMR. CRAWFORD: So in the Eleventh Circuit\nthey have determined that. But again, we submit under\nthat Russello presumption or even the statute itself,\nCongress enumerated those four property crimes,\nprimarily property crimes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Doesn't that seem\nlike a fine line? I mean, if you're sitting around with\nyour coconspirator planning it you can be covered under\nthis provision, planning a burglary. But if you\nactually get out there with the burglary tools, you put\nthe ladder against the door and you start up the ladder,\nthat somehow involves less of a potential risk of\nphysical injury?\nMR. CRAWFORD: They both present very little\npotential risk. They don't even really -- under a\nserious potential risk, they don't present that. A\nconspiracy shouldn't either. A conspiracy and attempt\nare not different things because a conspiracy doesn't\nqualify --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You think the\nEleventh Circuit is wrong?\nMR. CRAWFORD: I believe the Eleventh\nCircuit is wrong with conspiracy as well.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If we don't know and if I\ncan't get too far with the language and I frankly could\nsit in my office looking at the computer screen I think\nfor hours and I wouldn't be closer to knowing whether\nthere is or is not a lot of injury that accompanies\nattempted burglary, but that is something that is\npossible to know. All we have to do, as I said before,\nis count and there are a lot of people who can do that.\nIn fact, there are people who at least have a mandate to\ndo it and that is the sentencing commission. So they\nhave the tools. They have the ability. And so in the\nabsence on a question like this of my being able to get\nanywhere by cogitating about the language and in a\nborderline case where it isn't obvious, why don't we as\na Court simply follow a reasonable interpretation of\nwhat the sentencing commission did in the absence of\nbetter information from some other place?\nMR. CRAWFORD: Well, the sentencing\ncommission when they were interpreting the career\noffender statute, or guidelines, they were looking at a\nguideline that is worded different than the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: They're trying to find out\nthe same answer to the same kind of question: How many\nof these attempted burglaries, how many burglaries, how\nmany other crimes are accompanied by an individual being\nhurt? And as I say, I cannot imagine how to answer that\nquestion in a borderline case without trying to find the\nnumbers, which I don't have here, and therefore since I\ndon't have them, why don't I look to the best, second\nbest alternative, which is at least they could get them,\nand I hope they did get them before coming to the\nconclusion they did.\nMR. CRAWFORD: Well, they came to that\nconclusion dealing with whether a career offender\nprovision should include attempted burglary not under\nthe armed career criminal statute and they specifically\nrecognized that.\nMoreover, when they dealt with whether they\nwanted to include attempted burglary, they were dealing\nwith career offender, which has, although it increases\nthe guideline range a person can be sentenced to, it\ncertainly doesn't increase the statutory maximum in zero\nto 10 year offense to a 15 years to life offense.\nSo for those reasons, even if the sentencing\ncommission feels that the career offender statute or\nguideline should include attempted burglary, that\ndoesn't mean this Court should use that for the armed\ncareer criminal statute.\nMoreover, the career offender statute says\nit's only a burglary of a dwelling, although the armed\ncareer criminal statute says a burglary qualifies if\nit's a dwelling or a structure.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Crawford, we've held\nthat the named crimes have to be considered generically\naccording to their elements, right? Burglary, arson.\nHave we ever held that the residual category or\n\"otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious\npotential risk of physical injury,\" that that has to be\ndecided generically? I mean, if we could apply that\nresidual category, not generically but according to the\ncrime that was actually tried and of which the defendant\nhas been convicted, such as laying a ladder up against\nthe house, that particular sort of burglary, it seems to\nme it would be a much easier, much easier case, wouldn't\nit? We'd be able to tell whether there was a serious\nrisk of physical injury.\nIs there any obstacle to doing that?\nMR. CRAWFORD: Well, Taylor and Shepard both\ntalk about that predicate offenses under 924(e) should\nbe looked at in a -- using a categorical approach, and\nthe Court has talked about that being an approach looking\nto the elements of the offense.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Was it referring to the\nresidual category?\nMR. CRAWFORD: It didn't specifically refer\nto the residual category. But even in Shepard --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe it's not too late to\nsave ourselves from sending out legions of law\nprofessors to do studies.\nMR. CRAWFORD: If the Court were to step\nback and say that the \"otherwise\" clause should be\ninterpreted in a noncategorical manner and we're going\nto -- the Court decides it's a factual-based approach,\nin Mr. James' case there are no facts, so it may not\nmake any difference for him because there's no facts to\nindicate what kind of burglary really occurred here.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You mean no facts in the\nindictment or charging documents?\nMR. CRAWFORD: Correct.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But there is in the\npresentence report?\nMR. CRAWFORD: That is correct. There were\nfacts that were presented in the presentence report that\ncame from police reports.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't have any\ndoubt that, at least with respect to two of the other\nnamed crimes, attempts would present a serious potential\nrisk? In other words, attempted arson or attempted use\nof explosives? You concede those would be covered,\ndon't you?\nMR. CRAWFORD: Actually, no. Those crimes,\nattempted crimes, also should not come in unless there's\nsomething about an attempted arson statute that has as\nan element or something that presents a serious\npotential risk of physical injury to another, which at\nleast in Florida that's not the case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Don't you think attempted\nuse of explosives is at least as dangerous as extortion?\nI mean as far as the risk of physical injury is\nconcerned, I would think attempted use of explosives is\nmuch more dangerous to physical health than extortion.\nMR. CRAWFORD: Getting back to your\nquestion, maybe this answers part of it: Although the\nCourt -- you asked, Justice Scalia, you asked a question\nabout why can't we make this basically maybe a\nfact-based inquiry. And if you were to do so, the whole\ncategorical approach that we're dealing with in all the\nother sections would almost become irrelevant because if\nsomething doesn't apply categorically, then we'll go to\na fact-based inquiry and that kind of defeats the whole\npurpose of the categorical approach.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Crawford, does the\nrecord show that the facts in the PSR came from police\nreports rather than from a plea colloquy or someplace in the\ncourt records?\nMR. CRAWFORD: The plea colloquy was not\never presented or produced, and it does show that they\ncame from police reports.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Where is that in the record?\nMR. CRAWFORD: I believe that is stated in\nthe PSR regarding the facts that they alleged under the\nattempted burglary, which again were objected to.\nSpecifically, the facts weren't necessarily objected to,\nbut the use of the attempted burglary was objected to,\nand both the district court and the Eleventh Circuit\ntook that as being an objection to using anything\nregarding the attempted burglary.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Crawford, may I ask you a\nquestion about the relationship between generic burglary\nand what Florida takes as sufficient to show an attempt?\nAnd what I'm getting at is the issue that at least was\nalluded to in the Jones case.\nDo you understand Florida law on attempted\nburglary to be as follows: that there must be an overt\nact taken toward entering either a dwelling or a\nstructure, as distinct from an overt act taken to get\nwithin the curtilage?\nMR. CRAWFORD: The evidence -- I see my time\nis up. Little me briefly answer this question. Or -- I\nwant to remain, or let some remain for my rebuttal.\nVery quickly, the overt act has to refer to the\nattempting to enter the dwelling. And so --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So there's no such thing as\nattempted entry of the curtilage as an attempt offense\nunder burglary under Florida law.\nMR. CRAWFORD: Under Florida law attempting\nto enter the curtilage is an attempted burglary; it is\nthe same thing. Dwelling is defined as the building or\nthe curtilage.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, so when you say\ndwelling you mean dwelling as defined to include\ncurtilage.\nMR. CRAWFORD: Correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. CRAWFORD: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Crawford.\nMr. Marcus?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN L. MARCUS,\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. MARCUS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court.\nPetitioner's conviction for attempted\nburglary of a dwelling under Florida law is a violent\nfelony under the Armed Career Criminal Act because like\nthe crime of burglary Petitioner's crime categorically\ninvolves conduct that presents a serious potential risk\nof physical injury to another.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Marcus, do you agree\nwith your brother's answer to my last question that\nthere would be an attempt -- could be an attempt under\nFlorida law simply to take an overt -- to commit an\novert act toward entering the curtilage as distinct from\nentering a physical dwelling or a physical structure?\nMR. MARCUS: Yes, while I would disagree\nwith that, but while there are -- with your\ncharacterization. But there are no -- the number of\nreported cases involving an attempted burglary that\ninvolved an attempt to get on to the curtilage, if -- I\nthink -- based on --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: We don't know basically\nwhat Florida law is? I mean, is that the best answer?\nMR. MARCUS: Yes. I don't, I don't think\nyou could conclude, they have -- there is no decision\ntelling you whether that would suffice. But we're not\ntaking the position that it could not involve an\nattempted entry into the curtilage.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So that literally, I take\nit then if someone did have a fence around the house,\nand I, I -- I walked from the sidewalk onto the lawn\ntoward the fence, with the intent of getting over the\nfence, that would qualify then, as you understand it, as\nan attempted burglary under Florida law?\nMR. MARCUS: Yes -- it could. It could --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Would that be true if I\nsimply wanted to get into the -- if my intent was to get\non the other side of the fence but not into the\ndwelling? For example, you know, I wanted to steal the\napples on the tree?\nMR. MARCUS: Well, I think --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Would that qualify as\nattempted burglary?\nMR. MARCUS: I think it could. I think --\nbut I think you --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Doesn't that give you a\npretty tough row to hoe, in saying that there is a\nsufficient potential risk of the sort of harm that\nqualifies under the act?\nMR. MARCUS: I don't think so, Your Honor.\nI mean Florida, in the State versus Hamilton case, we\ndiscussed in our brief, Florida has defined curtilage\nnarrowly, strictly construed the word curtilage\nnarrowly, to limit that concept to an enclosed area that\nimmediately surrounds the dwelling. And the case\ndiscusses a couple of cases from various Florida courts\nof appeals where the courts construed the concept of\ncurtilage and held that in one case it was marijuana\nthat was quite a distance away from the, from a dwelling\nhouse, in another case a whiskey still that was a\ndistance about 50 yards away from the dwelling house,\nthat those were too far out to be considered part of the\ncurtilage, part of that area that immediately surrounds\nthe dwelling that's associated with the intimate\nactivities of the dwelling. So Florida -- and Florida\n-- and I think the Court should take the Florida Supreme\nCourt at its word when it said it's going to strictly\nconstrue that concept, and when it said it's not going\nto construe it to produce absurd, harsh or unreasonable\nresults, keeping in mind how serious the offense of\nburglary is.\nSo I think the -- so the first step, I\nthink, if you don't -- if you don't believe that the way\nFlorida defines burglary is generic in the way Congress\nhad in mind, I don't think you could conclude that it\npresents a categorically different set of risks such that it\nwould even fall outside the otherwise clause.\nJUSTICE ALITO: There are a number of\nFlorida cases that involve open carports. How would you\napply it there? Somebody, if you had a carport that's\nnot fenced off at all, just 20 feet let's say from the\nstreet, somebody walks into the carport and steals a\ngarden rake?\nMR. MARCUS: Well, I think under the\ncurrent, I think under the current statute, it has been\namended since, since 1993 and '94, and -- which is\nrelevant, the statute is relevant to this case. I think\nnow carports are considered part of the dwelling itself,\nthe structure itself but under -- but if it -- but under\nthe Florida's concept of curtilage if the area was not\nenclosed, it was not enclosed by a fence or other\nstructure it would not be considered part of the\ncurtilage. And in fact, the State versus Hamilton case,\nit cited a case that cast a doubt on a prior case that\nhad found a burglary that took place on a driveway, and\nnoted that the court in that case hadn't determined\nwhether the area, whether the driveway was enclosed.\nSo it does -- the statute does -- the\nconcept does require an enclosure and the area\nimmediately surrounding the dwelling and I think it is\nvery difficult to conclude that that, that defined in\nthat way, in that limited way, that someone who's\nintending to get on to a residence into the area either\nin or right around the dwelling, that that person is not\nsort of categorically dangerous kind of person that\nCongress had in mind when it set out burglary as one of\nthe paradigmatic offenses in the statute.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So in an ordinary city street\nin Miami walking along the street, there are a lot of\nhouses, and there's a little bit of lawn or bushes in\nfront, and there's not a fence, because there isn't, or\nthere aren't fences in many city blocks, a person goes\nup to the house and starts to monkey around with the\nwindow to raise it or whatever, that's attempted\nburglary, not burglary, in Florida?\nMR. MARCUS: That -- yes. That is my\nunderstanding. If it was not enclosed.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So then I doubt\n-- then again I'm left at sea. I don't know how often\nthat happens or is dangerous. So if I think that this\nis really a statistical question, and I think maybe it\nis -- and the Government is in the best position, they\nhave all the statistics, they have whole bureaus over\nthere. So what about a presumption against the Government?\nIn a case where it seems to be a close case and it is a\nstatistical question, and the Government doesn't have\nany statistics?\nMR. MARCUS: Well, I think -- I don't think\nwhen Congress enacted this law that it expected the\ncourts would have statistics available to --\nJUSTICE BREYER: How are you supposed to\ndecide it if there's a question as there is this instance\nI think? I just don't know how dangerous attempted\nburglaries are. I mean, maybe I'm not supposed to admit\nthere are a lot of things I don't know but there are.\nAnd this is one of them.\nMR. MARCUS: Well, there are several things\nyou can do. First you can look at the text of the\nstatute.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I read the text several\ntimes.\nMR. MARCUS: Congress provided some guidance\nby setting out four examples of crimes that do present\nthe type of risk they had in mind.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Correct. And here I think\nit might be less than burglary. And extortion, though\none thinks of somebody writing a poison pen letter or\nsomething and revealing a secret from the past -- many\nsuch crimes are threats of violence. I mean, and that\njust read through the statutes, and that's what they are\naiming at. So I would say extortion is something that\nquite often could involve violence.\nBut again that's cogitating. So I get\nto attempted burglary. I don't know. Now what do I do?\nMR. MARCUS: Well, I think -- I think you\nhave to consider what Congress's purpose -- in enacting\nthe statute, Congress directed your attention to the\nserious potential risk that an offense presents. I\nthink that just -- and criminal law requires courts and\njuries all the time to take into account and to use\ntheir common sense and experience to judge the risks\nthat are presented by a particular crime. I mean, the\nvery concept of recklessness itself refers to a\nsubstantial disregard of --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Marcus, it is a lot\neasier to do that with respect to the facts and\ncircumstances of a particular crime than it is to do it\ngenerically -- you know -- picking out attempted\nburglary. It is very hard to do that. Why shouldn't we\nread this, this residual category to refer to the facts\nand circumstances of the particular crime of which the\ndefendant has been convicted? The language enables you\nto do that. The term violent felony means any crime\npunishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\nthat involves conduct that presents a serious potential\nrisk of injury, physical injury to another.\nWhy can't we not, not interpret that to mean\ngeneric crime, but rather the particular crime of which\nthis defendant stands convicted?\nMR. MARCUS: Well, all that -- this law has\nbeen interpreted for many years. No courts of appeals\nhave, have construed that it way. They have construed\nit to require a categorical approach. And then if you\nlook at the structure of the provision, Congress clearly\nwith respect to the listed offenses had in mind a sort\nof a categorical approach that, while these courts had,\nsort of looking at one of these crimes on an ex post\nbasis, it might not present any risk, the idea that\nthese crimes categorically present a potential -- a\nserious potential risk of physical injury.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And would you agree,\nMr. Marcus, that this Court's decision in Shepard\nexcludes that interpretation? If you look at the\nparticular crime?\nMR. MARCUS: Well, I think the Court\nreferred both in Taylor and Shepard to the -- to\nCongress's approach. And under the statute, that sort\nof that it wants you to take a categorical approach to\ncrimes that are inherently presented --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Didn't we -- didn't we also\ngo further and say one reason to construe it that way is\nwe don't want courts to have to be, in effect, having\nsort of subsidiary collateral trials after the fact, to\nestablish -- you know -- the facts of old trials. There\nwas an administrability analysis involved. I think\nthere was. Yeah, I wrote Shepard. And I think that's\nwhat --\nMR. MARCUS: There was that as well. And I\ndon't think it is beyond the ability of courts to\ntake a crime, look at the elements of the crime, figure\nout what conduct is necessary to satisfy those elements\nand then use common sense and experience to make a\njudgment about how that -- the risks that are posed by\nthat conduct. Looking at the situation --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Marcus, isn't there\nthis -- this linguistic problem with the statute anyway?\nBecause this language if it said -- that sometimes\npresents a serious risk, then the answer would be\nobvious. If otherwise it said that characteristically\npresents a serious risk, then it might be closer. And\nwhich do you think is the more normal reading of it?\nI think either is -- certainly fits the\nlanguage.\nMR. MARCUS: And either --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Either means sometimes\npresents a potential risk of physical injury, then\nobviously they're all covered. Or if it says\ncharacteristically presents the risk, potential risk,\nthen do you have to decide whether that, it is a\ncharacteristic of potential burglary that it -- that it\ndoes present this risk or that just once in a while it\ndoes.\nMR. MARCUS: No. I think it's not -- no I\nthink it has to, characteristically taken at a general\nlevel, the conduct required to commit a burglary, of\ngetting --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If that were true, and if\nas your opponent said, that in actual burglaries there's\nonly three percent of them actually involve risk to --\nof physical injury to another, then attempted burglary\nmust necessarily be somewhat less than three percent. I\nwould think that. Would that satisfy the characteristic\nrequirement?\nMR. MARCUS: I think it would. First of\nall, Congress --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Why is it two or three\npercent?\nMR. MARCUS: The statistics he is referring\nto came out before Congress amended the statute in 1986\nand expanded it and specifically enumerated burglary as\none of the crimes that it thought paradigmatically\npresented a serious potential risk of injury.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, I don't think that's\nperfectly clear. The \"otherwise\" language does suggest\nthat you are right. But if the statute instead of\nsaying \"otherwise\" had said, \"or involves other conduct\nthat presents a serious risk,\" which I think is a\npermissible reading, perhaps not the best reading, but\nif it said that, then it is not -- you are not taking as\na given the fact that the others satisfy the violent\nrequirement but rather that they are eligible, whether\nor not they do.\nMR. MARCUS: Well, this Court interpreted\nthe statute that way in Taylor -- I mean, I'm sorry, on\npage -- on page 597 of Taylor. I mean this Court said\nthat Congress's choice of language indicates that\nCongress thought ordinary burglaries as well as\nburglaries involving some aspect making them especially\ndangerous, presented a sufficiently serious potential\nrisk to count toward enhancement. I mean, that's right\nin the Taylor decision, and I think that has got to be\nthe correct reading of the statute. Because why did\nCongress identify -- they created two categories of\nviolent felonies. The first is with respect to an\nelement of the offense that goes to targeting a person\nfor physical harm. The second category are those crimes\nthat don't necessarily target a person for physical harm\nbut necessarily present, inherently present a risk of\nphysical injury to a person.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That would be fine if\nburglary were the only thing that Congress said there,\nbut it also said extortion. And I think it absolutely\nfanciful to believe that extortion characteristically --\ncharacteristically -- involves a risk of physical harm.\nI just don't think it does.\nMR. MARCUS: Well, Congress identified it as\na violent felony presumably because it believed it had\n-- it had the criteria.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but is the criterion\n\"characteristically,\" or is the criterion whatever\nminimal risk of harm there is in extortion?\nMR. MARCUS: Well, that it carries the\npotential risk, because when any -- when someone\ncommits extortion there might be a tendency to -- if\nthere --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is the level of potential\nrisk the level that exists in extortion? Right? That's\nwhat the otherwise refers you to.\nMR. MARCUS: Yes. To the level of risk\nthat's presented by any of the preceding examples.\nThat's correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Maybe, the same point,\nisn't it reasonable to assume that the risk of harm in\nthese attempt cases is characteristically going to be\npretty close to zero? I mean, they're not in the house.\nThey're just on the ladder, in the kind of examples\nwe've been talking about.\nMR. MARCUS: I don't agree, Your Honor. The\nstatute directs you to consider the serious potential\nrisk.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: One way to do that is to\nsay the potential risk is the potential for the risk of\nthe harm that comes from the commission of the crime\nitself.\nI mean, there is -- I don't want to overdo\nit, but the risk of harm to others from the -- from the\nstep on the ladder is zero, if you consider simply the\nact itself of putting the ladder up against the building\nand taking the step. It's only because that creates the\npotential for getting inside where the risk, in fact, is\nmeasurable. I mean, we know there are cases in which\nvictims get shot when they appear in the course of\nburglaries, but the risk associated with the mere\nattempt in isolation is going to be minuscule.\nMR. MARCUS: When you're assessing the risk\npresented by particular conduct, I think you have to\ntake into account the intent that goes along with that\nconduct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, I agree with you. But\nthe act that involved -- the act that constitutes the --\nthat qualifies for the attempt doesn't involve it. I'm\ntrying to help you here. I mean --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Don't believe it for\na minute.\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why do you look at\nthe risk of burglary and then view attempt as a sort of\nlesser included offense? I mean, attempts themselves\nhave their own independent risk of physical injury.\nObviously, if you've got a ladder up against the side of\nmy house and you're halfway up and I come home, there's\na risk of injury there, even though there's no --\nregardless of whether the person gets into the house or\nnot.\nAnd I think perhaps there's even a greater\nrisk of potential -- greater potential risk of injury\nwith respect to attempts because they don't succeed.\nWhy don't they succeed? Because something interrupts\nthem. And what interrupts them, it may well be the home\nowner. So I don't know that you have to look to sort of\nattempt as a lesser risk than the burglary itself.\nMR. MARCUS: Well, Congress doesn't look to\nattempt as a lesser offense. We pointed out in our\nbrief that the vast majority of provisions in the U.S.\nCriminal Code punish the attempt the same as for the\ncompleted offense. And if you think about the purpose\nof the ACCA, and the ACCA is not focused on the results\nof the prior crimes of the armed felon committed, it is\nfocused on the risk, the propensity that somebody has,\nhas demonstrated by engaging in at least three prior\nviolent felonies or serious drug offenses to engage\nin behavior that is dangerous, that presents\ndangers to public safety. So if you think about the\nattempt and the whole concept of attempt, I mean, someone\nwho has committed attempt by definition has intended to\ncommit the offense and as you said, Mr. Chief Justice,\nhas only failed by reason of an unforeseen event.\nWhy would Congress in this statute want to differentiate\nbetween the frustrated burglar whose only -- who hasn't\nsucceeded only by virtue of an unforeseen event, and the\nsuccessful burglar? I think the serious potential risk\nlanguage allows you to sort of look at the attempt as\nyou said, Mr. Chief Justice, as virtually the\nequivalent --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I would suppose the\nunsuccessful burglar poses a greater risk of physical\ninjury than the successful burglar.\nMR. MARCUS: Arguably. I mean, if you look\nat the case law, the vast majority of cases, the\nfurthest out, the furthest case the Petitioner can find,\nthe most extreme case that he's found involves someone\nwho's in the backyard of a dwelling reconnoitering or\ncasing the dwelling, and that was the most extreme\nexample. So even with attempts, you find in all the\ncase law, you do find the physical proximity to the\npremises.\nAnd one of the main reasons it wouldn't\nsucceed is because somebody, there's the presence of\nsomeone who frustrates the entry. So that even on that\nlevel, at that level, it is hard to say that there's any\nlower risk presented by the attempt.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, what do you say about\nyour brother's argument that the statistics show there's\na 3 percent chance, I think it was a 3 percent chance of\nviolence in the course of committing the burglary? I\ntake it there isn't any statistic available, if we want\nto take Justice Breyer's approach, about the\npotential -- the actual proven potential for violence at\nthe near attempt stage.\nMR. MARCUS: But again, I think -- I don't\nthink you need to have those statistics.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, I don't think you do\neither, but I mean, I think your whole argument has got\nto rest really on the potential for harm in the\ncommission of the offense.\nMR. MARCUS: That's the very reason that\nattempts are prohibited, because they present the\nserious potential to produce the harms that the\ncompleted offense presents.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do I correctly understand,\nwe don't need the statistics, I guess they're not\navailable, but in your view if we did have statistics\nand they showed that in 1/10 of 1 percent of the\ncategory of crimes across the nation, there was this\nrisk, that would be enough?\nMR. MARCUS: For attempts?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes. Well, for attempts\nor complete -- I mean, just say the standard of what\npresents a serious potential risk of physical injury, if\n1/10 of 1 percent of the crimes -- whatever the\ncategory, did present such a risk, that would be\nsufficient under your view.\nMR. MARCUS: Yes, I think Congress wanted to\ntreat a frustrated burglar the same --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The answer is yes?\nMR. MARCUS: Yes. They've shown the same\npropensity to engage in the conduct that Congress was\nconcerned about that falls at the heart of the statute.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So then it's a really easy\ncase, because really there is some risk in every case.\nThere's some risk that somebody will, you know, bump\ninto somebody or give them a punch in the nose at least.\nMR. MARCUS: But that's not what we're\nasking the Court here. We're asking the Court to look\nat the elements of the offense, and to look at the\nelements of the offense to see whether that creates a\nsituation in which violence is likely to arise. Here\nyou're talking about, this is attempted burglary of a\ndwelling where you have --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but none of the\nelements of the offense satisfy the risk of physical\ninjury in the burglary case. You can have unarmed\nburglars.\nMR. MARCUS: But in considering the conduct\ninvolved in the offense, the attempting to get, the\nattempt to enter a dwelling, enter someone's home,\nsomeone's residence, that creates a dynamic situation in\nwhich violence could occur --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Right. And as I\nunderstand your view --\nMR. MARCUS: That doesn't --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If in 1/10 of 1 percent of\nthe cases, there is in fact a physical confrontation,\nthat's enough, which makes it a pretty easy case.\nMR. MARCUS: Yes. But again, first of all,\nI don't think the statistics would show that. I don't\nthink logically they would show that in light of the\nnumbers that are shown for completed burglary. But\nagain, I don't see -- with respect to the offenses that\nare covered that are at the core of the statute, I don't\nsee why you would distinguish between the person who\ntried to get in but was frustrated by some unforeseen\nevent. They have created the same set of risks, they've\ntriggered the same set of risks that the successful\nburglar has.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So in other words, you're\nsaying that in measuring the risk, you should consider\nnot just what this particular defendant succeeded in\naccomplishing, but what the defendant was attempting to\naccomplish?\nMR. MARCUS: That's correct. I think the\nstatute permits you to do that with its plain language\nof focusing on the potential risk of the conduct, the\nserious potential risk. And that -- and also in looking\nat the rationale for attempts and why we punish\nattempts, in terms of the person is, you get punished\nfor attempts because you sufficiently manifested your\ndangerousness in the same way as someone who's completed\nthe offense. Again, the State codes, the vast majority\nof State codes demonstrate the riskiness of attempt\nbehavior. They predicate felony murder convictions on\nattempted burglary as well as burglary. And as I said\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: What about attempted\nassault? I bet nobody has ever been hurt in an\nattempted assault.\nMR. MARCUS: Well, I think, my understanding\nwould be that would be covered under the first subsection\nfor the use -- attempted use or threat, threatened use of\nforce.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. But it wouldn't\nfit within your -- I mean, I just wonder what happens\nwhen you try to get away from numbers. Maybe there are\na certain number of people injured during mail fraud or\nembezzlement, you know, some people get annoyed during\nan embezzlement and start hitting each other.\nI can't get away from the numbers.\nMR. MARCUS: But there in those type\noffenses, if you look at the elements of the offense,\nthere's no nexus between those elements and the -- a\nreaction that someone might have just to being\nprosecuted. I mean, that's not --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So what's the test? The\ntest is either a high statistical number of injuries or\nif not, a nexus to a crime that does have a high\nstatistical number of injuries? I like the word nexus\nbecause whenever I see it in an opinion, I have no idea\nwhat it means.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. MARCUS: Well, in this statute you're\ntalking about career criminals, people who have\ncommitted a number of crimes and have recently just been\nconvicted of being an armed felon. And I think\nthat's -- when you look at -- that can be your starting\npoint, and take -- so this case doesn't present\nquestions about other cases that might present --\narguably present, or present a serious risk of physical\ninjury, but don't necessarily seem to fit with the\ncrimes that are listed and what the crimes that Congress\nhad in mind. I think that's another case. This case\nfalls at the core of the statute; we're talking about\nsomeone who intends to commit the core crime Congress\nwas talking about.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Marcus, assuming we\naccept your view about the way the statute should be\nread, I take it you agree that because of the curtilage\npossibility under Florida law, that Florida law, that\nburglary in Florida is not a generic burglary?\nMR. MARCUS: We haven't argued that it is\ngeneric burglary. That's correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I guess my -- so that leads\nme to this question, because -- I mean, I, my\nunderstanding is it's not a generic burglary.\nTherefore, even on your reading of the\nstatute, an attempted burglary in Florida doesn't\nnecessarily satisfy the prong, and it's got to come in\nunder the residuary clause, of course. And because\nthere is a possibility that the only burglary charged\nwas a burglary of the curtilage, we've got to -- don't\nwe have to send the thing back to find out either from\ncourt records whether something more than a mere\npenetration of curtilage was involved here? And if so,\nwhether -- whether that penetration carried with it the\npotential for harm?\nMR. MARCUS: I mean, no. That's why you\nhave the otherwise clause, to cover offenses just as\nthis Court said in Taylor, that they weren't --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but the only thing we\nknow under the otherwise clause, is that this was an\nattempt at burglary. If the burglary were a generic\nburglary, your analysis, if we accept it, would be the\nend of the case.\nMR. MARCUS: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But this is not a generic\nburglary. Therefore, we have to assume that the attempt\nin this case could have been nothing more than stepping\nacross the grass, moving toward the fence, to lean over\nto take the apple. And therefore, don't we have to go\nto court records? In other words, don't we have to take\nadvantage of the qualification in Shepard and Taylor\nbefore this case can finally be decided?\nMR. MARCUS: No. I mean, you've identified\nan additional step that the Court has to consider in\ndeciding the question in this case, but that step doesn't\nnecessarily require you to go to court records. I mean,\nit's our position that even including the curtilage, the\narea, enclosed area immediately surrounding the dwelling\npresents a serious potential risk of physical injury\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, could you tell us\nwhat your position is if we choose to use the\nnoncategorical or the modified categorical approach?\nIs there a nexus between what's in the presentence\nreport and some other charging documents, or is it just\nin the presentencing report?\nMR. MARCUS: Yes. The charging documents\nare not part of the record in this case. The record\nright now is solely comprised of the presentence report.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And we don't have any\ntranscript of colloquies with the court or anything like\nthat?\nMR. MARCUS: No.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, what about -- do you\nthink the facts in the presentence report are admitted\nby your opponent or not?\nMR. MARCUS: He didn't object to the facts\nin the presentence report. He also did not object --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Therefore, can we consider\nthem?\nMR. MARCUS: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So therefore, then the\nquestion is whether throwing the hammer through the\nwindow is sufficient; is that right?\nMR. MARCUS: Well, that would resolve\nJustice Souter's question about whether it would involve\nthe curtilage at all, which would show that there was an\nattempted physical entry into the residence.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Would you think that the\nhammer through the window is a decisive fact if we do\nlook at the individual case?\nMR. MARCUS: Well, we don't -- yes,\ncertainly we think that any attempted burglary of a\ndwelling presents a serious potential risk\ncategorically. But if you didn't agree with that, then,\nand you thought that only a subset of attempted\nburglaries of dwellings would present serious potential\nrisk, then clearly this offense here that would certainly\nsatisfy any conception of that.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Because the hammer is\nthrown through the window, is that -- I just want to be\nsure I understand your view of the importance of the\nhammer.\nMR. MARCUS: Because there was an attempted\nphysical entry into the residence. The person was right\non the threshold of the dwelling.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'm still a little unclear\nas to how much significance we pay to that hammer.\nMR. MARCUS: Again, we don't think you have\nto attribute any particular significance to that. I\nmean, it's our position that categorically this crime is\ncovered. And again, the case law shows that there's --\nthat with attempted burglary cases, there is a physical\nproximity to the dwelling, but even if there was --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Even though there's some\ncases in this large category that clearly wouldn't\ninvolve any risk to anybody. Say the enterprising but\ncareful burglar who keeps watch for several days to see\nwhen no one is in the house, that that's when he chooses\nto make his entry.\nMR. MARCUS: That's correct. You can always\nposit, under the categorical risk, you could always\nposit a specific nonthreatening hypothetical that\nequally applies to burglary as it does to attempted\nburglary. And so while you could posit a hypothetical\nwhere someone trying to get onto the curtilage might\nseem like it wouldn't present any injuries, if you think\ncategorically about people who are trying to surmount,\nget over fences and walls to commit offenses in the\ndwelling or immediately around the dwelling, they're\npresenting the same sort of risk, and therefore the\nCourt can conclude that it also -- within the otherwise\nclause, the burglary under Florida law is not so\ndifferent from the kind of burglary that Congress had in\nmind that it would just drop out of the picture\nentirely. Armed felons who have the propensity to go\ninto the curtilage of someone's home, to either go in\nthe house or right around the house, present the very\nkind of risk that Congress was concerned about.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you agree that this\npresentence report cannot be consulted under the\nreasoning of Shepard, we need more?\nMR. MARCUS: Well, under Shepard, the\ndefendant in Shepard had objected to the use of police\nreports. My understanding is he also submitted an\naffidavit saying he didn't acknowledge the truth of\nanything in the police report. So I think this case is\ndistinguishable in that there was no objection to the\nfacts in the PSR and there was no objection\nspecifically to using the police report as the source\nfor those facts.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You don't think the PSR\nhas some kind of significance that the police report did\nnot?\nMR. MARCUS: It wouldn't, no. I don't think\nit would. But -- no.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is the following sort of\nsummary fair: Because Florida is not a generic burglary\nState, the mere conviction of burglary would not satisfy\nthe burglary prong in subsection 2? But on your\nargument, even though Florida is not a generic burglary\nState, an attempted burglary will always satisfy the\n\"otherwise\" prong; is that correct?\nMR. MARCUS: Argument --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is that a fair statement of\nyour argument?\nMR. MARCUS: Yes. If the completed offense\nis a violent felony, the attempt to commit that offense\nis also a violent felony. That's a fair statement of\nour position.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nMarcus.\nMR. MARCUS: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Crawford, you\nhave four minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CRAIG L. CRAWFORD\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. CRAWFORD: It seems to me that\nRespondent's position is taking the \"otherwise\" clause\nto trump the entire rest of the statute. Any crime, any\nfelony, has a potential of violence. In fact, in\nfootnote 9 of the reply brief we cited the Golden opinion\nfrom the Seventh Circuit and in that particular opinion\nthe court found that serious potential risk for someone\nwho failed to report to a jail because they speculate,\nyou know, law enforcement might have to go and arrest\nthem and there could be violence in that situation.\nWell, that happens in all crimes, the potential for law\nenforcement to arrest somebody. There's always a\npotential for violence.\nSo the Government's position --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's different when\nyou're dealing with an escapee or someone who has\nvisitation right and then doesn't report back and\nqualifies as a escaped felon from prison. That's quite\na bit different from an arrest in a normal situation.\nMR. CRAWFORD: But there's still the same\npotential for violence in either one of those.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. There's a\ngreater -- I had this case in the D.C. Circuit. There's\na greater degree of potential when you're dealing with\nsomeone who's escaped from prison than with someone\nelse who's being arrested. Of course there's always the\npotential, but the judgment was that there's a greater\ndegree of potential when you're trying to apprehend\nsomeone who's escaped.\nMR. CRAWFORD: For someone who's escaped.\nGolden wasn't dealing with that. Golden was dealing\nwith someone who failed to report to a facility after\nbeing sentenced to do so. The same could be said for\nsomeone failing to report to a court for a hearing. A\nbench warrant is issued. The same type of risk would be\ninherent in that type of -- for that person as for\nsomeone who fails to report to a jail upon being\nsentenced.\nAll of those potential crimes, basically\nthat would leave open any potential felony to qualify\nunder the \"otherwise\" prong. Congress obviously\ncouldn't have intended that.\nMoreover, there's still an issue that was\nbrought up in Shepard on the constitutional avoidance.\nHow do we actually make these determinations and are\nthese necessarily determinations that were found by the\nFlorida court or by the Florida system for a Florida\nattempted burglary conviction? We submit it's not.\nAnd you're going beyond the mere fact of the\nprior conviction. You're looking at many other\ncomponents, the risk of the conviction, which is not the\nsame thing as the mere fact of the prior conviction.\nIf there are no further questions --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Crawford.\n"
