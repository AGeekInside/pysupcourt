MOORE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. MOORE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nWhether the Court chooses to view Title II of\nthe Americans with Disabilities Act in the entirety of its\nindiscriminate application through every facet of every\nstate program, activity, and service, or in the\nalternative, as the private respondents urge, in the\nnarrow courthouse access context, presented by the\nparticular allegations of the complaint they have filed in\nthis case, the Court should conclude that Title II exceeds\nCongress' enforcement authority under section 5 of the\nFourteenth Amendment for essentially two reasons.\nFirst, because there was no evidence before\nCongress that the states were involved in a widespread\npattern of violations of the Fourteenth Amendment rights\nof disabled persons when the ADA was enacted in 1990. And\nsecond, because Title II shares all of the incongruent and\ndisproportionate features that proved fatal to Title I of\nthe same statute in the Garrett case and then some.\nTitle II's lack of congruence and\nproportionality to any identified constitutional injury\ninflicted upon disabled persons by the states is apparent,\nwe say, on the face of the statute. Congress made no\neffort to tailor its provisions to those contexts which\nmight conceivably pose a threat to the exercise of\nfundamental constitutional rights by individuals with\ndisabilities. Instead, Title II applies indiscriminately\nto every service, program, or activity of the states.\nQUESTION: Let's assume that the - that the state\n- and it's just an assumption - would concede that\nsovereign immunity could be abrogated insofar as access to\ncourthouses for handicapped people, so that Congress could\nhave drafted a congruent and proportional statute. The\nfact that this injury comes within a statute which has a\nmuch larger coverage is grounds for striking the statute\ndown, even though this case involves what we will assume\nto be a - an injury that could be remedied under the\nFourteenth Amendment with money damages?\nMR. MOORE: Your Honor's question focuses on a\ndebate that we really haven't engaged in. It's - it's one\nbetween the respondents and the United States, because in\nour view, whether the Court views the statute in its - in\noverall operation, or as focused narrowly on the\ncourthouse access context, either analysis leads to the\nsame conclusion.\nHaving said that, I would say that the\nprohibition of Title II is a single, unitary, very elegant\none-sentence prohibition in section 12132 of Title 42. It\ndoesn't purport to subdivide the statute - the statute's\nprohibitions into particular subject matter areas. And as\nthe United States points out in its brief, this Court's\nprior congruence and proportionality cases in - in the\nabrogation context suggest that the Court looks usually at\nthe overall operation of the statute.\nIf the Court chooses that perspective on this\nproblem, we think yes indeed, even if the statute,\nassuming the statute, a narrowly-tailored statute could\nhave been drafted that would validly abrogate sovereign\nimmunity in the courthouse access context, Title II's flaw\nis that it is not so targeted. In fact, of the myriad\nactivities it covers, Your Honor, a very small percentage\nconceivably implicate the exercise of any constitutional\nright.\nQUESTION: Mr. Moore, does Tennessee provide any\ncause of action for the alleged violations here, the lack\nof access to the courthouse?\nMR. MOORE: No private right of action under our\nState Public Buildings Act. Our State Public Buildings\nAct, Your Honor, was enacted in 1970. It applied to all\nbuildings constructed on or after that date.\nQUESTION: So you're satisfied that under\nTennessee law, there would be no monetary relief\navailable?\nMR. MOORE: I think that is - I think that is\nright.\nQUESTION: And would there be any enforcement\naction at all available to compel under Tennessee law the\ncourthouses to be accessible?\nMR. MOORE: No, Your Honor, because under\nTennessee law, the - the injunction to build fully\naccessible buildings applies to buildings constructed\nafter the enactment of the Public Buildings Act in 1970.\nThere is no provision in the Public Buildings Act\nrequiring retrofitting. But, of course, in this case,\nTennessee does not dispute its obligation to comply with\nTitle II, and we do not dispute that our state officials\ncan be called to account for a failure to comply with the\nprovisions of Title II in an Ex parte Young action.\nQUESTION: Well, do you take the position that\nTitle II, even if this Court were to find monetary damages\nare not available, is there a way to enforce Title II by\nthe Federal Government against the State of Tennessee?\nMR. MOORE: Yes, Your Honor, there is, in an\nenforcement action by the United States, injunctive relief\nand monetary damages would be available against the state.\nIn addition -\nQUESTION: Under what power? I guess - I guess\nyou're arguing that there's no section 5 authority -\nMR. MOORE: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: - for enactment of this provision.\nAnd that would leave what, the Commerce Clause?\nMR. MOORE: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And you think it would survive the\nCommerce Clause challenge, do you, as applied to states?\nMR. MOORE: Your - Your Honor, of course, this -\nthis case doesn't present that question.\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. MOORE: But -\nQUESTION: But I'm asking.\nMR. MOORE: But we have not challenged and do not\nquestion Congress' -\nQUESTION: Other states have though, have they\nnot?\nMR. MOORE: I - it's my understanding that that\nclaim has been raised in certain lower Federal courts,\nyes.\nQUESTION: How about an action under Ex parte\nYoung -\nMR. MOORE: Absolutely, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: - against a state official, not for\nmoney damages, but for compliance?\nMR. MOORE: Absolutely, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Well, I can understand that if the\nstate official was standing at the door saying, no, you\ncannot bring a wheelchair in here. But if the building\nitself simply does not allow for - for - for ready access,\nhow would an Ex parte Young action be a source of remedy?\nMR. MOORE: Well, of course, Your Honor, Title II\ndoesn't really apply to buildings. It applies to\nservices, programs, and activities, and so long as they -\nQUESTION: Well, if the - if the activity - the -\nthe conduct of - of the business of courts is taking\nplace in a courthouse, I think that gets us to focus on\nthe building, doesn't it?\nMR. MOORE: But so long as the - so long as the\ncourt in question offers the service in - in a - in\nanother venue, for example, as occurred in this case, Mr.\n- at every step of Mr. Lane's interaction with the Polk\nCounty criminal court, an accommodation was offered to\nhim, albeit it was rejected.\nQUESTION: So they're - they're saying, look, you\n- you could have an Ex parte order - Young order - saying\nhold court on the first floor. That's - that's what\nyou're getting at? Okay.\nMR. MOORE: Yes, Your Honor. I mean, the - I - I\nshould think a - a court could fashion whatever remedy is\n- is deemed appropriate to ensure that a - a person in Mr.\nLane's circumstance enjoys the full panoply of his - of\nhis constitutional rights in - in -\nQUESTION: But I - I take it your position would\nbe that under Ex parte Young, a court could not say to a\nstate official, build an elevator?\nMR. MOORE: Well, I think courts have wide\ndiscretion to fashion injunctive relief in Ex parte Young\nactions, and if, in a particular circumstance, that were\nthe only reasonable way of delivering the service, I - I\nthink that would be inappropriate.\nQUESTION: So you would as - as a last ditch, you\nwould concede that?\nMR. MOORE: Yes. I think - I think in an Ex\nparte Young action, courts have enormous discretion to\nfashion equitable relief that is appropriate to - to\nwhatever the particular facts and circumstances are\npresented -\nQUESTION: But that would still be Commerce\nClause-based, right? Because you're excluding the\nFourteenth Amendment altogether.\nMR. MOORE: That would be true, Your Honor, yes.\nQUESTION: And there is something strange about\nthat, given that it was Congress' purpose to enable people\nto exercise the rights - the full rights of citizenship.\nI mean, it's a kind of a dignity right that Congress was\nrecognizing, and it doesn't fit as comfortably under the\nCommerce Clause, does it, as it would under the Fourteenth\nAmendment?\nMR. MOORE: I think it fits quite comfortably\nunder - under the Commerce Clause, Your Honor. But, of\ncourse, under this Court's case law, in order to invoke\nits Section 5 power, Congress had to have evidence before\nit or some reason to believe that the states were engaged\nin a widespread pattern of violating the constitutional\nrights of disabled or - or - of - of whatever group is\ninvolved, and here there was no such evidence, certainly\nnot in the courthouse access context.\nQUESTION: Well, what about the - that's what I\nwant to get to. I - I mean, to put the whole question to\nyou, I'm assuming we're talking here to use the statute\nabout judicial or courthouse-related services, programs,\nor activities. So I was seeing this as a kind of as-\napplied challenge, and if it's constitutional in this\narea, maybe we leave the other areas for a later time.\nNow, on that assumption, as you well know and I\ndo, the majority criticized my appendix in Garrett -\n(Laughter.)\nMR. MOORE: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: - for certain inadequacies. And among\nthose inadequacies which it highlighted was, one, the\ninadequacy that it talked about public employment instead\nof, says the majority, public accommodations and public\nservices. Here we're talking about public accommodations\nand public services. Second, the majority criticized it -\nI'm, you know, aware of these criticisms, I read them\ncarefully.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: The - the - the - criticized it\nbecause the Senate reports hadn't said anything. Well,\nhere the committee report talks - says discrimination\nstill persists in such critical areas as public\naccommodations and public services. And third, the - the\nconcurring opinion says there is no record of litigation\non this point and the SG has filed a whole brief with\nloads of - and fourth, the majority made a major point of\nthere being a relaxed, rational basis standard of judicial\nreview, but here we have access to a courthouse, something\nthat would seem to call for more strict scrutiny than\nthat.\nAll right. Those are the four things that I\ncould see as distinguishing this case, and I think it's\nreasonable to ask you, why don't they?\nMR. MOORE: They don't, Your Honor. Let me take\neach one in turn. First of all, in the appendix to the\nSolicitor General's brief, indeed, if the Court will look\nat all of the hundreds of pages of briefs filed in this\ncase by respondents and their amici, the Court will not\nfind a single case from a single jurisdiction that has\nheld that anytime, anywhere in the United States, a\nperson's fundamental constitutional rights of access to\nthe courts has been denied as the result of architectural\nbarriers at courthouses. And if there's one context in\nwhich one would expect to find case law, it is in the\ncourthouse access context, because after all, the business\nthat takes place there is litigation. We think that is a\nparticularly telling point.\nSimilarly, in - we find in the Government's\nbrief, who has - the Government has called from Your\nHonor's appendix the pertinent entries, and we find eight\nof them that have sufficient detail that would permit one\nto actually ask the question, was a constitutional\nviolation involved? And we say that under the - even the\nmost creative interpretation of any of them, they don't\nmake out a constitutional violation. All of the other\nreferences to courthouses in appendix C to Your Honor's\nopinion, we've pulled every single one of them, and they\nsimply - they simply label courthouse facilities as\ninaccessible.\nBut, of course, under the ADA, inaccessible is a\nterm of art. It doesn't mean there's literally a wall\naround the building and no one can get in. It means that\nthey are inaccessible in the sense that the - the\namenities required by the ADA are not present, so that\nthere are not - there is no evidence before this Court,\nand there was no evidence before Congress, that anyone's\nconstitutional rights, rights of access to the courts,\nwere being violated as the result of the existence of\nthese architectural barriers. And for those reasons, we\ndon't think the - the so-called task force report, which\nis summarized in the appendix to Your Honor's dissent in\nGarrett, helps the respondents.\nThere is no mention in the text of the act\nitself, of course, of courthouse access, and if one looks\nat the Senate and House reports on the legislation, one\nwill discover that there is not a single mention of the\nsubject anywhere and no other indication that Congress\nthought courthouse access was a matter of particular\nconcern.\nQUESTION: Mr. Moore, I'm sort of concerned about\nthis. Our prior cases dealing with this issue of - of the\nscope of Congress' - whether Congress' power under the\nFourteenth Amendment has been properly exercised, none of\nour prior cases parse it out issue by issue. Boerne, for\nexample, doesn't - doesn't just limit it to, you know, to\n- to whether, given that there was no - no discrimination\nin this case, Congress could move. You're - what you're -\nthe State of Tennessee is entirely happy to have us\nchange course and begin to rule upon congressional\nlegislation of this sort, case by case -\nMR. MOORE: No, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: - whether there was enough evidence on\ncourthouses, whether there was enough evidences - enough\nevidence on each of the other innumerable state functions\nthat - that were covered by this bill. But, I mean,\nthat's the argument you're making.\nto - to say there's not enough evidence about courthouses,\nand therefore, in this case, they can't do it. And we'll\nhear - we'll hear another case further down the line\nabout, you know, any of the other innumerable state\nfunctions that are impinged upon by this law.\nMR. MOORE: I would agree with Your Honor that -\nthat the Court's prior abrogation cases, each one of them\nlooks at the overall operation of the statutory scheme and\ndoes not look at its application in a context-by-contact -\ncontext basis. And we would agree that if the Court\nchooses to continue that practice and - and for many of\nthe reasons discussed in the United States brief, we think\nthat is probably the better view of it, this statute\nclearly falls, because under no circumstances can - can\none say that it - it - it is congruent and proportional to\na valid, remedial objective.\nQUESTION: How - how do you do that? Because if\nI think of the antitrust laws, for example, or other\ncongressional statutes in olden days when the Court, you\nknow, was worried about the scope of the Commerce Clause,\nwhat would happen is they would say, of course the\nantitrust law is valid, the statute's valid, but it's not\nvalid to apply it to baseball, because baseball's not an\ninterstate commerce, or it's not valid to apply it to\ninsurance.\napproach here, that this statute may be valid as applied\nto X, Y, and Z, where they did have enough evidence, but\nnot A, B, and C, where they didn't?\nMR. MOORE: I - because I think the abrogation\ninquiry is fundamentally different. The abrogation\ninquiry focuses on whether Congress invoked its power\nunder Section 5 in a fashion that is congruent and\nproportional with a valid, remedial objective, that being\na - a - an identified pattern of unconstitutional\nbehavior.\nQUESTION: In City of -\nMR. MOORE: And in order to - excuse me, Mr.\nChief Justice.\nQUESTION: In City of Boerne, we certainly did\nnot go in and analyze whether the church has a claim under\nthe Constitution or not.\nMR. MOORE: That's true. That's true, and - and\nthe same can be said of the Kimel case. The Court didn't\nfocus on the peculiar allegations of the complaint in that\ncase.\nQUESTION: Justice Breyer's question, how can you\ndo that, reminds me of, you know, there's a story about\nthe Baptist minister who was asked whether he believed in\ntotal immersion baptism, and he said, believe in it, I've\nseen it done.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: And that - that is surely the\nsituation here. We've done it before in - in each of the\nother cases involving this area.\nMR. MOORE: Yes, Your Honor. The statute lacks\ncongruence and proportionality also, not just because of\nits sheer breadth, which Justice Scalia's question\nhighlights, but also because in the myriad contexts to\nwhich it applies, it imposes obligations on the state that\ngo far beyond what the Constitution itself commands.\nIt really does so in two ways generally. First,\nmost of the rules under Title II promulgated by the\nJustice Department to enforce its provisions require\nstates to modify otherwise disability-neutral policies and\npractices in order to eliminate adverse, disparate effects\nthose policies may have on the interests of disabled\npersons, whereas, as this Court noted in the Garrett case\nitself, under the Fourteenth Amendment, disparate -\ndisparate effects of that - those sorts, without more, do\nnot make out any sort of constitutional violation. Second\n- yes, Your Honor?\nQUESTION: I was going to ask you to get out of\nthe courthouse area of the case for a minute. The\nGovernment's brief contains a statement that in 1975,\napproximately one million disabled students were excluded\nentirely from the public school system. If that were\ntrue, and if - because of their disability, if that were\ntrue, would that constitute a constitutional violation?\nMR. MOORE: I don't think we have enough facts to\ndraw any conclusion.\nQUESTION: And then my next question is, there's\nnothing in the record - suppose you had several\nCongressmen who said, I'm going to vote for this statute\nbecause I'm convinced that this fact is true, but there's\nnothing in the hearings, but - but it definitely motivated\nthe voting of people who voted for this statute, could -\nwould it be valid in that fact, that situation? Or do we\nhave to have evidence in a - in a congressional hearing in\norder to justify a congressional decision?\nMR. MOORE: I think there must be evidence of a\npattern of constitutional violations, and merely saying\nthat a particular class of persons is excluded from public\nschools, for example -\nQUESTION: Is it - is it -\nMR. MOORE: - without more information doesn't\npermit a conclusion necessarily that a constitutional\nviolation is going on.\nQUESTION: Is it true then that in a case like\nthis, we must examine legislative history in order to\ndetermine the validity of the statute?\nMR. MOORE: Unless - I mean, there are certain\ncontexts where - where the - the history of discrimination\nis so well known and has been documented in this Court's\nown opinions, that perhaps that's unnecessary.\nQUESTION: Well, it hasn't been - I'm assuming it\nhasn't, but it's just clear that the Congressmen who voted\nfor the statute thought it was true. They got letters\nfrom their constituents and acted on that sort of\ninformation, and that - but that can never be sufficient\nunder your understanding of our cases? It must be\nsomething in the congressional record?\nMR. MOORE: I think there must be something in\nthe - in the record that establishes a state - state\nparticipation in a widespread pattern of unconstitutional\nbehavior, yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Mr. Moore, you - you don't concede, I\nassume, that the Constitution is violated by not - not\nproviding educational - public educational facilities that\nwill be accessible to all handicapped persons? You don't\nconcede that that's a constitutional violation, do you?\nMR. MOORE: No, I do not. No, I do not.\nQUESTION: I didn't think it was.\nMR. MOORE: The - the - and in fact -\nQUESTION: I mean, you - you need a rational\nbasis.\nMR. MOORE: That's right.\nQUESTION: And - and if - if the - the additional\nexpense for constructing the buildings in - in a manner\nthat would render them accessible to all handicapped\npersons is excessive, it's not a constitutional violation.\nNow, it may be a very bad idea, but we've never held that\nthat's a constitutional violation.\nMR. MOORE: I - I think that's right, Your Honor.\nThe only -\nQUESTION: So saying that so many handicapped\npersons couldn't get into public schools would prove\nnothing at all, would it?\nMR. MOORE: I think you're absolutely right, Your\nHonor. The only context in which this Court has applied\nheightened scrutiny in - in the education context is where\nthere was a - a - a punitive class-based exclusion, and -\nand there only in the K through 12 context, and so merely\nreciting that a certain number of students were being\nexcluded without more information, Your Honor, I think\nwould not make out a constitutional violation.\nQUESTION: Just out of curiosity, in your view,\nis the requirement that Congress have a kind of\nlegislative - I've called it an administrative or court\nrecord - to document the evidence of unconstitutionality\nof practices applicable only in Section 5 of the - of the\nFourteenth Amendment, or is something - is it a\nconstitutional requirement that applies to all the\nprovisions of Article I, including the Commerce Clause and\nother provisions?\nMR. MOORE: Quite frankly, I focused only on this\nCourt's cases construing Section 5 requirements in this\ncontext. But I - I think - I think Congress - when\nCongress invokes one of its powers in a way that intrudes\nupon the sovereignty of the states, it must document that\nit has an adequate basis in fact for concluding that that\npower exists.\nQUESTION: It's like - it's like a mean question,\nbecause if you - if you answered the question that they\nhad to be different, I'd said why, and if you answered the\nquestion they'd have to be the same, each of us can cast\nour minds over dozens of pieces of important legislation\nwhere, let's say, the underpinning - let's take the\nCopyright Clause or let's take any one of a dozen where\nthere isn't really much of a legislative record. I mean,\nthat's - do you want to say anything about that? I mean,\nthat's the problem I see there.\nMR. MOORE: Well, of course, here, this case\ndeals with a specific context, the - the - the invocation\nof Congress' power to - to abrogate the state's sovereign\nimmunity, and it seems entirely reasonable for the Court\nto construe section 5 as requiring that before the\nCongress alters the Federal-state balance in such a grave\nway, that it document very carefully its basis for doing\nso.\nQUESTION: Of course, the - the commerce power\nexists whether or not other - other facts are - are\nestablished. It is a power that Congress always and\neverywhere possesses. Congress does not always and\neverywhere possess the power to subject the states to - to\n- to lawsuits.\nQUESTION: Yes, but -\nQUESTION: That power exists only - only when, as\n- as we - we found was not well-enough established in\nBoerne, only when there has been a constitutional\nviolation by the states, so why isn't that an adequate\nreason for the difference?\nQUESTION: But is that quite correct? Isn't it\ntrue that under section 5 they prohibited the poll tax and\nliteracy tests, even though they'd been held permissible?\nThey were not unconstitutional, they were prophylactic\nmeasures.\nMR. MOORE: But that was, Your Honor, only after\na - a well-documented history of discrimination and\ndiscriminatory application of those -\nQUESTION: But you would agree that it's not\nessential that there be a constitutional violation?\nMR. MOORE: I - I think there must be evidence of\na pattern of a unconstitutional behavior.\nQUESTION: The answer is no. The answer is no.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: You don't agree with that. There has\nto be a constitutional violation.\nMR. MOORE: There has to be -\nQUESTION: The remedy may go beyond the\nconstitutional violation, but there has to be a\nconstitutional violation, does there not?\nMR. MOORE: I agree with you, Your Honor, 100\npercent, and I would like, Mr. Chief Justice, to reserve\nthe rest of my time for rebuttal.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Moore.\nMr. Brown, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM J. BROWN\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS LANE AND JONES\nMR. BROWN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nUnlike Garrett and Kimel, and entirely\nconsistent with this Court's opinion in Hibbs, Title II as\napplied to the case that is before the Court today\npresents a constitutional application of the powers of\nCongress under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nQUESTION: When you say, Mr. Brown, as applied to\nthe case that's before the Court, you're suggesting that\nit can be kind of sliced up and just, say, address\ncourthouses?\nMR. BROWN: Your Honor, please, I think the\nhistory that this Court has used in the past is to focus\non the case and the circumstance and the issue that's\nbefore the Court. The case that's before the Court\ninvolves the fundamental right of access to the court.\nQUESTION: Well, but in - in our other cases\ndealing with Congress' section 5 power, I don't think\nwe've taken that position. We have said, particularly in\nthe City of Boerne, the Government response must be\ncongruent and proportional, which suggests that there may\nbe constitutional violations, but they're simply not\nsufficient to justify what Congress did. That's the\nmeaning of - I understood - of the term, congruence\nproportionality.\nNow, if you - if you simply focus down narrowly\nenough and say, was there a constitutional violation in\ndenying the church the zoning, the - that really\neliminates the idea of proportionality entirely.\nMR. BROWN: Respectfully, Chief Justice, the way\nthat I took Boerne was that this Court made a direct\nstatement to Congress that they had overstepped their\nbounds in interpreting the First Amendment and the\nFourteenth Amendment and its applications. The Court\nlooked directly at Congress and said not that in these\nparticular circumstances, but on this particular\nconstitutional issue, you went too far.\nNow, what we're talking about in this case today\nis not about whether or not Congress dealt with a\nfundamental right. That's unquestionable. Today what\nwe're talking about here is what I would suggest to the\nCourt the quintessential element of the Fourteenth\nAmendment, and that is the right of each of us as\nindividuals to due process of law, to life, liberty, and\nproperty.\nQUESTION: The legislation doesn't deal with that\nconstitutional right. It doesn't - doesn't mention, you\nknow, due process and - and - and courthouses\nspecifically. It - it embraces innumerable things. And\nwhat you're saying is, because one of the innumerable\nthings that it embraces happens to involve a\nconstitutional right, the legislation is a valid exercise\nof - of section 5 power as to that particular\nconstitutional right.\nAnd I - that doesn't strike me as - as accurate.\nIf Congress wants to enact such a sweeping statute, a\nstatute that - that, in effect, as we said in Boerne --\nwhat was going on in Boerne was that Congress was\nrewriting the First Amendment, and here Congress is\nrewriting the Equal Protection Clause essentially, saying\nthat - that - that there must be constitutionally or by\nvirtue of this - of this supposedly constitutionally\nremedially statute, there must be equal treatment of - of\nhandicapped people.\nAnd it - it seems to me it's exactly parallel to\nwhat was going on in - in Boerne, rewriting the First\nAmendment versus rewriting the Equal Protection Clause,\nand we looked at the whole sweep of - of Congress' action,\nnot just at the particular First Amendment claim.\nMR. BROWN: Justice Scalia, respectfully,\nCongress does not have a real good record of writing\nmemorandum opinions. What it said specifically was, this\nlaw deals with the Fourteenth Amendment, and what the\nstatute says is that citizens, qualified citizens for\nprograms and services and activities of the state, have a\nright to participate in those activities without having\nthe onerous issue of their disability come into play.\nQUESTION: Mr. Brown, are you saying that these -\nwhat fits within this statute would independently violate\nthe Constitution, and all that the statute does is\nprovide, in this case, a damage remedy?\nMR. BROWN: I think it does.\nQUESTION: So that in - in all the cases that\nwould fit under this legislation, someone could come in,\nsay, and seek injunctive relief -\nMR. BROWN: Well, absolutely.\nQUESTION: - for a violation of a constitutional\nright?\nMR. BROWN: Well, the beauty of Title II is that\nwe don't have to chase all those rabbits. I mean, Title\nII gave me the benefit of a trial lawyer in Tennessee\nwhose sole purpose and interest was, one, to make sure\nthat our courthouses in Tennessee were accessible, and\ntwo, that individuals that were harmed, that suffered\npain, embarrassment, humiliation, as they individually, on\ntheir own, by virtue of their right under the Fourteenth\nAmendment to represent themselves had to crawl up the\nstairs of one of our courthouses -\nQUESTION: But let's take, say, it's a - it's a\nseat in - in a public stadium, which is also covered, or a\ntheater, and it's inaccessible to certain people with\ndisabilities, would that be a violation of the\nConstitution, for which this statute provides a remedy?\nMR. BROWN: It may not provide or deal with a\nconstitutional violation, but it certainly deals with a\nprophylaxis issue. And - and let me give you this\nexample.\nstadium, suppose the President came to address a large\naudience of individuals in that particular stadium, and\nthose individuals who have mobility disabilities decided\nthat they wanted to go and hold up a sign that says, Mr.\nPresident, make our buildings accessible. Is that not\nreally a fundamental First Amendment right, and the fact\nthat they can't get there implicates their right to\npetition their government?\nThe concept that we as individuals have a right\nunder the Fourteenth Amendment to be citizens in all of\nits aspects, not just simply in one context that may or\nmight - may not ever come, surely today in the year 2004,\nCongress has the power to ensure that we as individuals\nhave all the rights of citizenship without reference to\nany individual context.\nQUESTION: Then - then would you -\nMR. BROWN: That doesn't make any sense.\nQUESTION: Would you explain to me the difference\nbetween your position and the Government's position then?\nBecause you've - you've gone beyond - at least, as I\nunderstand your answer, you've gone beyond a - a kind of a\nstrict, as-applied argument, and - and I'm not sure where\nyou and the - and the Government part company at this\npoint, if you do.\nMR. BROWN: Your Honor, I represent six people in\nTennessee who are trying to get access to the courts of\nour state. If I can win their cause, then I will be\nsatisfied with the results that I initiated in 1998 when I\nfiled this lawsuit. If I have a responsibility to go\nbroader and to defend all the other aspects of Title II,\nbut lose my clients' case, then I have not done them a\nservice, nor have I done a service to other individuals\nwho are seeking access.\nQUESTION: Is - is your argument still that what\nyou are complaining of would independently be a\nconstitutional violation, so that the virtue of this act,\nin effect, is to provide a remedy, and that's all we need\nto consider?\nMR. BROWN: Absolutely, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nQUESTION: You - we don't have to just say this\none individual, do we? I mean, there is a pretty good\nrecord here. I - well, I better not characterize it,\nbecause I come from a certain point of view on this, but\nthere's a pretty good record, and I felt the Chief\nJustice's question was getting to this. I mean, are you\narguing that if this - this statute could constitutionally\nbe written giving you constitutionally this lawsuit as a\nremedy, in respect to your client that's good enough, that\nis a harder argument possibly than to say, well, if it's\nvalid in respect to the general problem of providing\njudicial services, which is a big category, one whole\nbranch of the state. I mean, that category might be\nvalid.\nMR. BROWN: Let me say, Your Honor, respectfully,\nI think we do have to establish a category. I don't think\nthat Title II nor this Court would ever suggest that\nliterally every person who comes in with a Title II claim\nhas to state a constitutional violation, because then it\ntakes away from the prophylaxis benefits of Title II.\nWhat is says, what Title II fundamentally says,\nand literally adopts what I think is the fundamental\npurpose of the Fourteenth Amendment, is back to what I\nsaid before. We as individuals have a right to be there\nwhere our government works and where it operates. And\nGeorge Lane is a classic example of that. George Lane\nconfronted as an individual with a misdemeanor charge, a\ndriving on a revoked license case, the proposition that\nthe only way he could get to the courtroom where his\nliberty was at stake was by crawling. The state suggests\nthere were alternatives. Where were the people offering\nto carry him up the stairs the first time? Where were\nthey?\nQUESTION: There has to be an affirmative offer?\nHe could not have asked for assistance getting up the\nstairs?\nMR. BROWN: Your Honor -\nQUESTION: It's a constitutional violation not to\noffer it as opposed to refuse it when he asks for it?\nMR. BROWN: Your Honor, please.\nQUESTION: I mean, he appears downstairs and -\nand he sees one of the constables there and says, you\nknow, I can't make it upstairs in my wheelchair, could I\nhave assistance get - getting upstairs? Now, is that a -\nis that a constitutional violation not to have an\nelevator for him, but to say, you know, we'll - we'll see\nthat you are carried up by - by constables? Is that a\nconstitutional violation?\nMR. BROWN: I think that it is, Your Honor,\nbecause the presumption is that somebody would be there to\ncarry him.\nQUESTION: I - I don't understand that. It is\nbecause the presumption is that somebody -\nMR. BROWN: There is no constitutional right - if\nhe doesn't have a constitutional right generally to get\nthere, what gives him the constitutional right to have\nsomebody carry him up there? You're asking what George\nLane to rely on -\nQUESTION: He has a constitutional right for the\nstate to provide him the means of being present at his\ntrial. Now, does the means have to be an elevator or\ncould it be someone assisting up the stairs? Now, there -\nit - it may be less dignified in the latter - in the\nlatter situation, and that's a proper subject for\nstatutory activity, but is it a constitutional violation,\nso long as the state assures that he can - he can be\npresent at his trial?\nMR. BROWN: His safety, Your Honor, is a critical\nissue. Ralph Ramsey, who is one of my clients, weighs 350\npounds. To say that he has a constitutional expectation\nthat one or two or five or the whole battalion of deputy\nsheriffs in Cocke County would and could carry him up\nthose stairs, I mean, what's he going to do, file a\nFederal lawsuit to make sure that somebody will carry him\nup there? I don't think he has that right.\nWhat he has is the prophylaxis benefit of a law\nthat says we're going to create buildings where people can\ngain access to their rights as citizens. That is as\nimportant to say as it is to say that we all have a right,\nno matter what our circumstances, our background, our\nclass, to get to the civic center of life, public life in\nour communities, and that should be done, Your Honor, and\nI don't know that you all have ever said that, but that\nshould be done with dignity and respect that the\nFourteenth Amendment speaks about all of us as\nindividuals. And today I think that is what is so\nimportant and at stake. This case is not just about\nindividuals with disabilities.\nQUESTION: Probably this is universally accepted\nwhat you're saying, and what I wonder is, is why, if you\ncould explain it, what your opponent is saying is that to\ngive people a remedy for the violation of that principle,\nit is adequate to have the Federal Government bring a\nlawsuit or they bring an Ex parte Young, et cetera,\naction. Now, why isn't that sufficient?\nMR. BROWN: Your Honor, please, the Federal\nGovernment was not there the day George Lane confronted\nthose stairs. George Lane could not call upon the Federal\nGovernment that day to ensure that he didn't go to jail\nbecause he refused to crawl those stairs.\nQUESTION: Neither was a Federal judge who could\nhear his lawsuit.\nMR. BROWN: And that's why the -\nQUESTION: I mean, the Federal Government brings\na lawsuit or he brings a lawsuit.\nMR. BROWN: That's -\nQUESTION: Neither one of them is there\ninstanter.\nMR. BROWN: Respectfully, Your Honor, that is why\nTitle II is there, to make the State of Tennessee\nanticipate that problem, solve that problem, so our\ncitizens don't have to confront those obstacles and face\npain, suffering, and public humiliation as a condition of\ncitizenship.\nRespectfully, Your Honor, please, this deals\nagain, as I have said, not just with the rights of\ndisability individuals, but the rights of all of us to go,\nto petition our government, to have a right to represent\nourselves in a court of law.\nQUESTION: There is a difference, though, if you\ntalk about non-discrimination, say, with respect to race\nor religion, you - you use the word dignity to say the\nstate has to respect the dignity of every human being, but\nto respect the dignity of certain people with disability,\nthe state has to do more than not harm them, not\ndiscriminate against them. It has to have a kind of\naffirmative action that's permanent, isn't that so?\nMR. BROWN: Respectfully, Justice Ginsburg, an\nelevator to an individual with disabilities is no\ndifferent than stairs are to me as a person without\ndisabilities. It's the way I get there. The fact that I\nhappen to have an opportunity to walk upstairs doesn't\nmake those accommodations any different to me than it is\nwith an individual with disabilities. The point of the\nmatter is, suppose as in Meigs County, where you've got a\nstairway getting to the second floor that barely one\nperson can climb up, it's creaky, I mean, are we going to\nsay if they shut down those stairs, we can haul people up\nwith a pulley and a rope?\nQUESTION: That's not the point that I'm making.\nMR. BROWN: I'm sorry, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: The point is that sometimes to respect\nthe equal dignity of a person, we have to treat them\nspecially, and I think that that's what the elevator is.\nIt is special for a class. It isn't the same as everybody\nelse has.\nMR. BROWN: Your Honor, I think the word special\naccommodation is something that is a problem. I - I hope\nthe Court will understand that -\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Brown.\nMR. BROWN: I'm sorry, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Mr. Clement, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT UNITED STATES\nMR. CLEMENT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nUnlike Title I of the ADA, which regulates\nstates as employers and treats public and private\nemployers alike, Title II of the ADA focuses on states and\nstate governments as governments in their distinct role as\nproviders of public services. As a result, Congress\nfocused specifically on the conduct of state and local\nofficials rather than simply extrapolating from the\nexperience of private employers.\nEqually important, Congress in the statutory\nfindings and legislative reports, the same reports this\nCourt found lacking in the Garrett case because they did\nnot include specific findings of public sector\ndiscrimination in employment, those same findings and\nreports found persistent discrimination in such critical\nareas as access to public services and voting. Moreover,\nas this Court -\nQUESTION: That - that - that's persuasive or\nnot, depending on what was meant by the term\ndiscrimination. If it simply meant that - that the\nhandicapped were not accommodated by special provisions,\nsuch as elevators, that might be quite true, but it would\nalso not be a constitutional violation, would it?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Scalia, I think that\nbrings us to the second important distinction between\nTitle I and Title II, which is because -\nQUESTION: Well, let - let's stay on your first\none. I'm - I'm - I'm waiting to hear what - what findings\nCongress made that has anything to do with constitutional\nviolations by the states -\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, and - and -\nQUESTION: - which is the premise for this\nlegislation.\nMR. CLEMENT: And again, Justice Scalia, I think\nthe problem in Garrett, when this Court saw findings of\ndiscrimination in an area like employment discrimination,\nthat's governed by rational basis review, then there's\nvery little reason to think that the small \"d\", if you\nwill, discrimination Congress found resulted in\nunconstitutional discrimination. But because Title II\nfocuses on government services, many of which implicate\nfundamental rights, there's every reason to believe that\nwhen government - when - when the Congress found - take\nvoting for example - discrimination in voting, that they\nwere actually finding unconstitutional discrimination in\nvoting, because voting and access to polling places\ntriggers fundamental rights and heightened scrutiny. And\nas this Court recognized in -\nQUESTION: Well -\nMR. CLEMENT: - in the Hibbs case, when -\nQUESTION: These two sections - these - these two\nthings were debated and - and passed simultaneously, or at\nvery different times?\nMR. CLEMENT: Title I and Title II?\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. CLEMENT: They - they passed at the same\ntime.\nQUESTION: And - and they're - they're using\ndiscrimination to mean one thing in - in one half and\nanother thing in the other half? That's - that's what you\nwant to argue to the Court?\nMR. CLEMENT: I think whatever way they were\nusing discrimination, I think that that finding of\ndiscrimination is going to be much more likely to be\ncorrelated with actual constitutional violations in an\narea that implicates fundamental rights. And I think when\nthere's a specific finding in the text of the legislation\nitself of discrimination in voting, I think it's very\nlikely, given the heightened scrutiny that applies to\nvoting -\nQUESTION: Okay. You said - but now what - what\ndoes it mean to say discrimination in voting? Does that\nmean that a person was actually not allowed to vote?\nMR. CLEMENT: In - in some cases, Mr. Chief -\nQUESTION: How - how many cases do they - do you\nhave where the person was not actually allowed to vote\ninstead of not being facilitated in the ability to vote?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, let me say\nthe - the relevant congressional committee heard testimony\nof individuals that were turned away from the voting place\non - on election day, so there is that kind of evidence.\nNow, I can't articulate for you how many instances of that\nthere were.\nQUESTION: What - what do you mean by turned\naway? Turned away because there was no elevator?\nMR. CLEMENT: Turned away because there was no\nelevator, turned away because -\nQUESTION: Is - is that a constitutional\nviolation?\nMR. CLEMENT: If - if the voting official tells\nthe individual, we - you can't vote here, because this -\nQUESTION: He tells them -\nMR. CLEMENT: - this is not accessible -\nQUESTION: - we - we don't have an - we don't\nhave an elevator.\nMR. CLEMENT: Right. If he tells them -\nQUESTION: So if you want to get up to vote, you\nhave to find assistance to get up there. It's very bad,\nand this legislation is directed against it, and can\nremedy it upon a suit by the United States, but is it a\nconstitutional violation?\nMR. CLEMENT: With respect, I think maybe you'd\nneed to know more, but if the individual in the polling\nplace is turning people away because of their disability\nand they're not offering, don't worry, we have a school\ndown the road that is accessible, that's not the facts.\nThey're saying, you can't vote, I'm sorry, we don't have\nthe facilities. I think that would state a constitutional\nviolation.\nQUESTION: How - how many of these instances did\nCongress find of people who were actually refused the\nright to vote?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, there was\ntestimony of individuals, I don't have the exact number,\nand -\nQUESTION: What - what order of magnitude?\nMR. CLEMENT: I - I think it was anecdotal\nevidence, and I would say - I mean, to give you a feel for\nthe - the - the sort of order of magnitude, in the state\ntask force reports that Congress authorized, there were 35\ninstances of inaccessible voting places. Now, I can't\ntell you the breakdown of how many of those involved\npeople refused at the door and how many of those involved\nsimply physical barriers. But I do think it shows that\nthere was a significant problem in this area.\nQUESTION: I don't think it does at all.\nInaccessible voting place proves nothing at all. It just\nproves that the state did not go out of its way to make it\neasy for the handicapped to vote, as it should, but as it\nis not constitutionally required to do.\nmany voting places are inaccessible proves nothing at all.\nMR. CLEMENT: And again, Justice Scalia, I think\nthat when you couple an inaccessible voting place with\nlocal officials who are saying, you can't vote today, we\ndon't have any facilities for you, that does violate the\nConstitution.\nQUESTION: They're not saying you can't vote,\nthey're saying we don't have facilities for you to get to\nthe voting place.\nMR. CLEMENT: I - I guess I fail to understand\nthe difference in that in a practical way.\nQUESTION: I do too.\nMR. CLEMENT: And I think this Court has said on\na number of occasions, in areas of fundamental rights, it\nis simply not true that only intentional discrimination of\nthe kind you have in mind would violate the Constitution.\nIn the access to court context, in particular, this\nCourt's decision in M.L.B against S.L.J. suggests that in\nmany instances in order to avoid unconstitutional\ndiscrimination, the courts have to waive filing fees of\nindigent defendants or indigent individuals trying to\nprovide their constitutional right.\nIf that's true in areas of fundamental rights,\nit's not clear why - why state officials don't have some\nobligations under the Constitution itself to make\naccommodations for individuals with disabilities.\nQUESTION: I'm not under - I really don't\nunderstand one - one argument that's going on. I don't\nknow why one violation wouldn't be enough to justify\ncongressional action. It often is that one - one incident\ntriggers a legislative response. Why wouldn't one - one\nexample be enough?\nMR. CLEMENT: Justice Stevens, I think one\nexample might be enough, especially when coupled by other\nevidence in the record that is reinforcing and suggestive\nof the problem, especially when coupled with judicial\ndecisions that we provide in appendix A of our brief. If\nyou put all that evidence together, it's clear that\nCongress was reacting to a real problem in this context.\nQUESTION: And solve that problem by requiring\naccess to - to state-owned hockey rinks or any state-\nowned buildings, whether it's a courthouse or anything\nelse. I mean, you're - you're talking about it as though\nall Congress was directing this legislation at was - was\nthe problem of people getting to the voting place or the\nproblem of people getting to - to courthouses. That's not\nhow the legislation reads. It's all public facilities run\nby the state, hockey rinks, whatever.\nMR. CLEMENT: That's true, Justice Scalia. And\nlet me say two things in response.\nCongress was entitled, once it found a problem in areas of\nfundamental rights, to say that it's permissible\nprophylaxis to - to provide a remedy for a broader array\nof government services.\nQUESTION: Well, there - do -\nQUESTION: Where there are no conceivable\nconstitutional rights involved.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, if I could respond to that, I\ndon't think it's that there's no conceivable\nconstitutional rights involved. Even in areas that don't\nimplicate fundamental rights, this Court itself has found\na constitutional violation in the disability context in a\ncase like Cleburne. And I think if Congress finds that\nstates are engaging in unconstitutional discrimination in\nareas implicating fundamental rights, that may lead to an\ninference that they're simply not turning off the switch\nwhen they get into other areas.\nQUESTION: Well, would it - would it be a\nviolation - a constitutional violation to refuse to afford\nspecial access to a hockey rink?\nMR. CLEMENT: I - I don't think standing alone,\nMr. Chief Justice, it would, and I think I would defend\nthat in part as part of the permissible prophylaxis of the\nstatute. If I could say -\nQUESTION: This is what I'd like to get at. I -\nI have the impression from your brief that you were\nsuggesting that we could just address the fundamental\nrights aspect of this case and forget about the rest, but\nyou seem to be saying now that we should consider the\nwhole thing and consider it all valid as a prophylaxis\nproposition. Which is it -\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I guess -\nQUESTION: - that you're proposing?\nMR. CLEMENT: In fairness, Justice O'Connor, it's\nboth. I mean, I'm here defending the constitutionality of\nthe statute as a whole, but I also think it would be fair\nfor this Court to follow the practice that I think was\nsuggested in a case it decided called United States\nagainst Raines, and focus in on the aspect of the statute\nthat is constitutional, that is valid, and that would be\nfundamental rights.\nQUESTION: Well, we haven't really done that in\nother cases of this type, of the sovereign immunity of the\nstates, have we?\nMR. CLEMENT: You have not, Justice O'Connor.\nQUESTION: No.\nMR. CLEMENT: And we pointed that out, and I\nthink there is some tension between the proportionality\nand congruence test in this as-applied mode of analysis.\nBut I do think the Raines case points out -\nQUESTION: It was decided maybe 50 years ago,\nbefore any of our more recent cases.\nMR. CLEMENT: I think that's fair, Mr. Chief\nJustice. I simply point to Raines because Raines shows\nthat there's nothing inherently inconsistent between\nanalyzing a section 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment or\nsection 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment piece of\nlegislation, an as-applied analysis. And I think there's\nan important relationship between this Court and Raines,\nbecause in Raines, this Court in a sense identified a\nfault line in a statute that was broadly applicable. It\napplied both to state actors and private individuals. And\nin a case in which it applied to state actors, they said,\nwe may have some concerns about whether it can validly\napply to private actors, but we're going to uphold the\nstatute as applied to state actors.\nAnd in the same way, I think if this Court\nthinks that the statute is constitutional as applied to\nfundamental rights, but has concerns in its applications\nto non-fundamental rights, that it could, in effect,\ndecide the case along the same lines. And, of course, the\nnarrowest ground this Court could decide the case on would\nbe to simply focus on access to the courts.\nQUESTION: Suppose the state is building a new\nstadium, a new hockey rink. Does it have a constitutional\nobligation to make it accessible to the handicapped?\nMR. CLEMENT: I'm not sure that it does, Justice\nKennedy. I think that if you isolate the example of the\nnon-fundamental right and ask the question of whether or\nnot that standing alone violates the Constitution -\nQUESTION: So - so the Government - the\nGovernment's position is citizens don't have some rights\nof access to public facilities as a matter of the\nConstitution?\nMR. CLEMENT: I think they have - they might have\nsome access under the Constitution and some right. I'm\nnot sure though that I'd be able to make an argument that\nthat constitutional right is protected by something more\nthan that rational basis review. I think that -\nQUESTION: You're - you're saying that if the\nonly public facility without a ramp was a hockey rink,\nyou'd have a tough row to hoe, but if every public\nfacility, courthouses, schools, et cetera, have no ramps,\nthen you've got a broader context and you've got a\ndifferent argument?\nMR. CLEMENT: That's exactly right, Justice\nSouter. And one other thing I think that's worth bearing\nin mind is that -\nQUESTION: And what is - what is the\nconstitutional right? Freedom of movement?\nMR. CLEMENT: In - in - in the hockey ring\ncontext?\nQUESTION: What is the - what is the basis for\nthe constitutional right that you accepted in your\nresponse to your question - in response to Justice\nSouter's question?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I think it would depend on\nthe facility in particular. I think in the access to the\n- in - in trying to get access to a court, it would be\naccess to the courts. In trying to get access to a\npolling place, it would be the right to vote. I think one\nthing I'd like to emphasize though is that the - that\nTitle II -\nQUESTION: There's - there's no - there's no\ngreater right to freedom of movement or general - on the\npart of citizens, freedom of access to all governmental\nfacilities?\nMR. CLEMENT: I - I'm not sure that - that this\nCourt has said that yet. If it's interested in -\nQUESTION: I'm asking your position whether or\nnot in your view there is such a right.\nMR. CLEMENT: It's certainly not one that this\nCourt has ever articulated, and - and - what I would say\nthough is that -\nQUESTION: So you don't have a position on the\npoint?\nMR. CLEMENT: I have - it's not - it's not a\nmatter I've really given any thought, Justice Kennedy. I\napologize for that. I think the one thing I would like to\nemphasize is that Title II does not just give an access to\nbuildings, it doesn't give an access to hockey rinks. It\ngives an access to programs, services, and activities, and\nin many cases, it's going to be the same municipal\nbuilding that has the courthouse in it as well as other\nnon-fundamental rights, and that's exactly a good\nillustration of why Title II is appropriate prophylaxis,\nbecause by making the municipal building accessible, even\nfor something like a kiddie concert that might not\nimplicate fundamental rights, you're also making the\ncourtroom in the same building accessible to individuals\nwho have a constitutional right to access to that\nbuilding.\nOne other point I'd like to make is with respect\nto the damages remedy, which is precisely what seems to be\nthe gravamen of the concern of the state here. As Justice\nO'Connor pointed out, this is not a situation like other\ncases, where, if the Court strikes this down as\ninappropriate section 5 legislation, there's going to be\nlots of other remedies. The state provides none and\npeople are raising constitutional challenges to the\nCommerce Clause legislation.\nThe damages remedy that's particularly provided\nin Title II of the ADA is provided by double cross-\nreference. Title II incorporates the remedies available\nunder the Rehabilitation Act, which in turn incorporates\nthe remedies available under Title VI. Those remedies are\nentirely judge-made, and as the Thornburgh amicus briefs\npoints out, to the extent that those remedies are the\ngravamen of the constitutional concern, their judge-made\norigins gives this Court unique flexibility to interpret\nthe compensatory damages remedy in a way that renders the\nstatute as a whole constitutional.\nBroadly speaking, Congress, in passing this\nstatute, found a real problem with the individuals and the\nentities that are responsible for protecting the civil\nrights of everyone, denying the rights of individuals with\ndisabilities. One element of its solution was the element\nof compensatory damages. Those compensatory damages are\nan appropriate response, but it would be very sad if that\none element of the statute was used to bring down the\nentirety of Title II, given that it remains vitally\nnecessary to make the promise of the Fourteenth Amendment\na reality for individuals with disabilities.\nQUESTION: Is there a reason why there's a damage\nremedy in Title II and not in Title III?\nMR. CLEMENT: I think there is, Justice Ginsburg.\nI think that one thing, I think, is that Congress - the\ndifference in remedies between Title II and Title III\nreflects two things. One, it reflects a judgment that -\nthat unconstitutional action by a state is worse than\nunconstitutional action by a private entity.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Clement.\nMr. Moore, you have four minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL E. MOORE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. MOORE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Very\nbriefly, the type of discrimination Congress was referring\nto in the statement of findings of - and purpose of the\nact itself is made clear if the Court examines the fifth\nfinding, which - which tells us what sort - what - what\nconcept of discrimination was in Congress' mind when they\nused the term throughout those findings. And it talks\nabout not just outright intentional exclusion, but it\ntalks about discriminatory effects of architectural,\ntransportation, and communication barriers. It talks\nabout overprotective rules and policies and their effects.\nIt talks about failures to make modifications to existing\nfacilities and practices, and exclusionary standards that\nscreen people out, in other words, an another disparate\nimpact sort of conception of discrimination.\nAnd I think for that reason one can reliably\nconclude that - that - that Congress was not using\ndiscrimination in the sense of completely arbitrary and\nirrational discrimination of the sort that's prohibited by\nsection 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment with respect to\ndisabled persons, but rather, in the findings and purpose,\nCongress makes clear that it is addressing a very real\nsocial problem, one that needs addressing, but one that\ndoes not arise to the level of a - a widespread pattern of\nconstitutional violations on the part of the state.\nQUESTION: But it begins section 5 by saying,\nindividuals with disabilities continually encounter\nvarious forms of discrimination, including outright\nintentional exclusion. So it seems to want to deal with\nit all.\nMR. MOORE: Right, but out - of course, outright\nintentional exclusion is not necessarily unconstitutional\neither if it is rationally based, with respect to disabled\npersons. So one - the use of the term discrimination -\nQUESTION: What - what's your authority for that\nproposition?\nMR. MOORE: The City of Cleburne case, Your\nHonor. Action by the state that intentionally and\nexpressly classifies on the basis of disability is subject\nto minimum rational basis scrutiny, and in the examples\ndiscussed during the Solicitor General's argument, for\nexample, the hockey rink example, I mean, one impact of a\nlack of ramps or - or -\nQUESTION: May I ask you about the hockey\nexample? Supposing building a new hockey example, the\narchitect said you could do it with equal cost, providing\naccess and not providing access. Would it be\nconstitutional assuming there's no extra expense to\nprovide no access?\nMR. MOORE: I - I think so, depending upon if\nthere were other reasons for doing it. If - cost isn't\nthe only factor that dictates the design of a building.\nIt might be that the site -\nQUESTION: Well, supposing the general manager of\nthe hockey team doesn't like handicapped people. Would\nthat be a sufficient reason?\nMR. MOORE: Your - your hypothetical is that the\narchitect expressly designs the building to spite disabled\npeople?\nQUESTION: No, the - he has two - two plans, one\nlets them in and one doesn't, and the manager says, oh, we\ndon't want these people, they're too much trouble to\nhandle for the ushers when they get them in their seats\nand so forth.\nMR. MOORE: Your Honor's question posits a\nrational basis for that decision.\nQUESTION: And that would be a sufficient\nrational basis in your view?\nMR. MOORE: That - under this Court's minimum\nrational basis jurisprudence, yes, it would.\nQUESTION: Do you think the Cleburne case was a\nminimal rational basis case?\nMR. MOORE: I - I know, Your Honor, there - there\nhas been a lot of scholarly debate about that, but as a\nlawyer for a state, we must take what the Court said at\nface value. Thank you very much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Moore.\n"
