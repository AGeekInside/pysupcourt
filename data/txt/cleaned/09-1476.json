ORTIZ\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. ORTIZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn asking this Court to cabin Connick v.\nMyers' public concern requirement, Respondent would\nconstitutionalize, under the Petition Clause, large\nparts of the law of public employee discipline, and\nthereby grant to public employees a broad constitutional\nemployment right that private employees do not enjoy.\nTwo independent reasons, however, argue strongly for\napplying the public concern requirement to discipline\nclaims brought both under the Free Speech and the\nPetition Clauses.\nFirst, the constitutional framework\nprinciples this Court has repeatedly identified in its\npublic employment cases argue strongly for requiring it.\nAnd second, McDonald v. Smith's principle of parity\nargues strongly for creating no hierarchy between the\nFree Speech and Petition Clauses.\nWhen -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You agree that the Petition\nClause is -- is different and does have a separate\ncontent?\nMR. ORTIZ: Your Honor, we agree that the\nPetition Clause -- that when the Petition Clause and the\nFree Speech Clause cover the same activity, they\napply -- they cover it under McDonald in the same way.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But the Speech Clause, in\nthe employment context, has been interpreted to cover\nthe content. Whether it -- whether it applies or not\ndepends upon the content, right?\nMR. ORTIZ: One part of that inquiry turns\non the content.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you want the Petition\nClause also to turn on the content?\nMR. ORTIZ: Part of the inquiry, yes, Your\nHonor, should turn on the content.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But it seems to me you're\neither petitioning the government or you're not\npetitioning the government. Why -- why shouldn't the\nline be, if you're petitioning the government as\nemployer is different from petitioning the government as\nruler? Why shouldn't that be the line that we draw?\nMR. ORTIZ: Well, the -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Which wouldn't necessarily\nbreak out the same way as whether it's a matter of\nprivate concern versus a matter of public concern.\nMR. ORTIZ: Your Honor, this -- under the\nconstitutional background principles this Court has\ndeveloped, this Court should look at -- looks at how\nclose to the core a particular example of employee\nactivity is, and then talks about how much of a burden\nthat kind of activity poses to the efficient operation\nof the workplace.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But the core -- the core of\nthe Petition Clause is petitioning. The core of the\nFree Speech Clause is political speech, of course -\nspeech in public interest -- but the core of the\nPetition Clause is quite different. It's simply whether\nyou're petitioning. Surely you -- you could petition\nthe -- most of the petitions in the early years were\nregarding private matters; isn't that right?\nMR. ORTIZ: That is right, Your Honor, just\nas most examples of speech concern private matters, too.\nYet that does not define the core of the Free Speech\nClause. There's not an empirical inquiry. That depends\nupon the purpose of the clause. And as this Court\nstated very definitely in McDonald, the core of the\nPetition Clause, like the Free Speech Clause, was -- was\naimed at promoting democratic self-government.\nPetitioning is a particular form of speech.\nIt is speech directed to a particular audience, the\ngovernment, some arm of government, some individual in\ngovernment, and it is speech that has a particular\npurpose: Asking for a change of some sort in government\npolicy.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's true, and it seems\nto me the -- the core is involved whenever you're asking\nfor a change. And it seems to me that the key\ndistinction, if there is one, is whether you're asking\nfor a change in -- by your employer in your employment\nconditions or a change by the government in some matters\nover which the government has control as -- as\nsovereign.\nMR. ORTIZ: Well, Your Honor, in practice,\nthat inquiry would not align much differently than the\nConnick inquiry.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It may well be, may well\nbe.\nMR. ORTIZ: And in this particular case,\ndesigning a kind of threshold inquiry along those lines\nwould actually advantage Petitioners.\nOne difficulty in application, though, is\nthat this Court has always identified the purpose of the\nConnick threshold test as categoricalizing in a way the\nPickering balancing inquiry. And if you had a threshold\ntest that basically did not match, was a little oblique\nto the Pickering balancing inquiry, it would create much\nmore work for the lower courts along the way. Or\nperhaps this Court would want to change the Pickering\nbalancing inquiry.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Would they have to do both?\nWould they have to do both?\nMR. ORTIZ: They might well, Your Honor. If\nthe Pickering balancing inquiry still aligns with the\ntraditional framework that this Court has described in\nits employment cases, what I describe, and this other\ninquiry, which you're suggesting, Justice Scalia, was\nsomewhat oblique to it, then it might conceivably be\nnecessary to do both. One -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If you're proceeding with a\nclaim under two separate provisions of the Constitution,\nit should not be surprising that you might have two\ndifferent tests.\nMR. ORTIZ: Well, Your Honor, then that\nmight argue for more reengineering of the rest of the -\nthe enterprise as well, a step that this Court has not\nidentified as appropriate under -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why would it make -- why\nwould it make a difference at what you call the\nbalancing stage whether it is -- whether the distinction\nis between public speech and private speech on the one\nhand or government as employer and government as\nsovereign on the other? Why would there be any\ndifference?\nMR. ORTIZ: Well, Your Honor, if at the\nfirst stage the Court is running an inquiry that is\nsomething different from Connick, that is not going to\nmap onto traditional Pickering balancing, at least as\nthis Court has described it, at the second stage.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why not?\nMR. ORTIZ: Because, Your Honor, Pickering\nbalancing has gone to things like how -- how -- how\nimportant that particular example of speech is, how\nclose it is to the core of what the First Amendment\nprotects, and then that is weighed against the kind of\nburden it would place on the government to have that\nactivity protected in a very strong way.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think all you're saying\nis that one of the elements of Pickering balancing is\nthe element of Petition Clause jurisprudence, as I\nsuggested it -- it might be applied; that is, in\nPickering balancing, certainly you have to ask, was what\nthe individual was asking for a change in employment\nconditions? That would be one of the questions. If so,\nit was a private matter, and then you go on to the rest\nof the balancing.\nBut it seems to me you have to make that\ndetermination under Pickering balancing anyway, and once\nyou make it, you've answered the -- the Petition Clause\nquestion.\nMR. ORTIZ: Well, Your Honor, if this -- if\nthis Court were to proceed down that road, Petitioners,\nI believe, would still end up victorious. This is a\ncase, as I understand your -- your approach, where the\npetition does concern purely employment matters. It is\nnot a petition aimed at or directed at the government in\nits capacity as sovereign, so under that kind of\nanalysis, that is where the initial trigger, this case,\nwould have not been constitutionalized.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What kind of case,\nhypothetically, would qualify under your theory as a\npetitioning case to the sovereign? Would a claim of\nretaliation because of a termination based on race\nqualify?\nMR. ORTIZ: It would depend upon the\nparticular claims involved, or statements in the\npetition. If it were a statement that there was a\npolicy, involved a petition against a policy in a\ngovernment department involving race, that would\ncertainly qualify. That would be like the Gibbons case\nunder the Free Speech Clause, Your Honor.\nIf, however, it were a one-off allegation\nthat a particular, say, low-level governmental\nsupervisor had engaged in a form of discriminatory\nactivity -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Doesn't that get to\nthe -- to the merits of the case? You have to from -\nyou can't invite a question as to whether the sovereign\nis responsible until you litigate the issue.\nSo what is the -- addressing Justice\nScalia's question to you, what would qualify as a\npetition to the employer as opposed to a petition to the\nsovereign and why?\nMR. ORTIZ: Your Honor, a petition to the\nemployer about changing the hours of employment -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Those are clear cases.\nMR. ORTIZ: -- for overtime -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I was asking the flip.\nMR. ORTIZ: The flip. A petition, a\ncomplaint to an employer about the employer's pervasive\nor apparently pervasive policies in violation of the\nlaw, would certainly qualify as something to -- a\npetition to the sovereign.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, you have to\nwrestle with the same problem if you apply the other\ntest that you -- you were proposing.\nMR. ORTIZ: For sure.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Namely, whether it's a\nprivate matter or a matter of public concern. You\nconfront the same difficulty, don't you?\nMR. ORTIZ: You certainly do, Your Honor,\nand presumably this Court would look at some of the same\nfactors involved there: The form, the content, and the\ncontext of the communication. All of those things are\nrelevant. This Court has admitted that that inquiry is\nsometimes messy, that there are some -- many cases where\nthe line of distinction is not clear. But it is -- this\nCourt has not hesitated to apply that test because of\nits importance to the public employment environment.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Ortiz, you're not\ndrawing any line depending on the branch of government,\nin other words, executive, legislature. Those are\ncertainly branches of government to which one can\npetition. But access to court you agree comes within\nthe Petition Clause?\nMR. ORTIZ: A lawsuit, pursuing a lawsuit,\nis definitely a form of petitioning activity, Your\nHonor. Petitioners do not contest that.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the -- this as\nI understand it, came up originally as arbitration under\nthe -- wasn't it under the collective bargaining\ncontract?\nMR. ORTIZ: Yes, Your Honor, that is the\ncase.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Would that count also,\nbecause it is a mechanism set up by a government\nemployer?\nMR. ORTIZ: It would qualify under the\noriginal conception of what a petition is all about that\nwas in this case. It is Petitioner's view that it would\nnot qualify under the access to courts definition or\nconception of petition that Respondent has developed\nsince the case was first before the district court.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If -- if lawsuits are\ncovered by the Petition Clause, why is it that in the\ninnumerable cases this Court has had concerning what due\nprocess of law consists of, we've never mentioned what\nthe Petition Clause requires. I mean, if the Petition\nClause guarantees access to the courts, certainly there\nare some minimum requirements that it imposes as well,\nand I don't recall any of our cases dealing with\nlawsuits that mention the Petition Clause. That's\nrather extraordinary if indeed it governs all lawsuits.\nMR. ORTIZ: Well, Your Honor, that might be\nexplained by the fact that the Due Process Clause has\nbeen interpreted more robustly and supplies a certain\nfloor of constitutional protection for lawsuits. And\nthe Petition Clause, since it is directed at petitions\ngenerally and in particular the framers, the evidence\nis, had in mind not petitions to the courts, but\npetitions to the legislature, if lawsuits -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe that's all they had\nin mind, or petitions to the executive as well. What -\nwhat evidence do you have that it applied to lawsuits?\nMR. ORTIZ: The evidence is that developed\nby Professor Andrews, and the argument is a somewhat\nslender one that goes as follows: At the time of\nfounding, Congress was the central sort of clearinghouse\nfor petitions and handled both what we think of as the\nstereotypical paradigmatic petitions, pleas to Congress\nto sort of change the law, and also handled a lot of\nprivate bills. Over time, Congress handed over much of\nthe responsibility for handling the things that came\nthrough private bills to the courts, and so to the\nextent -- this is Respondent's argument -- that the\ncourts handled, took over those things, the lawsuits are\nprotected.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I agree with you that\nthat's slender.\nMR. ORTIZ: Thank you, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you are not\nchallenging that, as I understand.\nMR. ORTIZ: No, Your Honor. In the district\ncourt it was conceded that the grievance activity would\nbe -- was protected. However, Petitioners do contest\nquite sharply that under Respondent's new view of the\nPetition Clause that the things of central importance\nare lawsuits and other communications that would be\nprotected, perhaps be protected, otherwise under the\naccess to courts doctrine, that arbitration, the\narbitration involved in this case, does not count and\nshould not receive any kind of heightened protection.\nThe problem, much of the problem here, is the theory of\nwhat is a petition from Respondent's side has changed\nfrom the district court to this Court.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Ortiz, can I try a\nhypothetical on you? Suppose that there is a city\nemployee and unrelated to the fact that he is a city\nemployee the government takes some part of his property\nwithout just compensation. And he sues the government,\nand the government says, somebody says, his employer,\nthat his supervisor said: Do you know what he's just\ndone? He's just sued the city; I think we should fire\nhim. And he brings a retaliation claim. Is that\nprotected under the Petition Clause?\nMR. ORTIZ: Yes, Your Honor, it would be\nprotected for two different reasons. First, that would\n-- similar activity would be protected under the Free\nSpeech Clause, so that would preserve the principle of\nparity.\nSecond -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Really? What has he done\nthat's protected under the Free Speech Clause? He has\nbrought a suit saying: I'm entitled to just\ncompensation. It seems to me -- the reason I ask is\nbecause this seems to me a purely private matter which\nwould not get protection under your test.\nMR. ORTIZ: It's not employment-related or\nrelated to his particular job, and this Court has always\ndrawn the distinction there. For example, in National\nTreasury Employees Union this Court applied that kind of\nanalysis.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I see, so that goes back to\nJustice Scala's difference test, which is it's not a\nmatter of public concern versus private concern, but\nit's a matter of employment-related versus not\nemployment-related, correct? Is that correct?\nMR. ORTIZ: Well, that shows how closely\nthose two things have been related in this Court's\napproach. In -- but certainly something that is\nprivately-related, a public employee is complaining\nabout tax assessment or something like that and tries to\nsue for retaliation under, under that theory, not for\nanything related to his or her job, this Court -- under\nthis Court's and the lower court's application of the\nConnick principles, there would be no problem there\ntreating it as speech or as a petition.\nSo it is only when the lawsuit or the\npetition involves something related to the person's\nemployment that these particular -- this particular test\nwould kick in. And that's consistent, Your Honor, with\nthis Court's twin background constitutional framework\nprinciples, one that you look at how much disruption\nsomething is likely to pose to the workforce and how\ncentral it is to the particular constitutional provision\ninvolved.\nIn this case, if in general it's not\nemployment-related the government has much less interest\nin worrying over it this way and applying the Connick\nthreshold test is much less justified. You would have\nto do Pickering balancing, proceed directly to Pickering\nbalancing in that case.\nNow, Your Honor, Respondent's view presents\nseveral problems of sort of practical application, or\nwould, to this Court. First, it would allow for the\neasy circumvention of Connick, which is a test that on\nthe free speech side this Court has long held is very\nimportant for the public employment field to work\nefficiently. It would be very easy for a particular\nemployee to take activity that Connick would not allow\nto proceed, to turn into a lawsuit on the free speech\nclause, and just by rephrasing it, respinning it,\nwhatever, to turn it into a petition where under\nRespondent's rule the result would be very different.\nIt also would require the Court to create a\nhierarchy between speech claims and petition claims,\nand, more importantly, if the Court were to go down the\nparticular road that Respondent describes and see the\ncenter of the Petition Clause as defined by the access\nto courts doctrine it would create a hierarchy among\ndifferent forms of petition. All of a sudden, petitions\nthat at the founding were thought to be at the\nperiphery, if there, of the Petition Clause would define\nits center, and a paradigmatic petition of a letter to\nCongress asking it to change its position on something\nwould not be covered at all.\nIf there are no further questions, I would\nlike to retain my remaining time for rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Ortiz.\nMr. Palmore.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH R. PALMORE,\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMR. PALMORE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Third Circuit rule here at issue is\nflawed for two fundamental reasons. First, contrary to\nthis Court's admonitions, it quite literally\nconstitutionalizes the employee grievance process by\nsupplanting carefully calibrated nonconstitutional\nsafeguards and by providing a potential First Amendment\nclaim in Federal court to any employee who has filed a\ngrievance on a matter of only private interest. And\nsecond -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How much of your\nargument is premised on the fact that there was an\nalternative mechanism to the court system available.\nMR. PALMORE: That certainly -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Meaning let's assume\nthere wasn't a collective bargaining agreement, let's\nassume there wasn't a State law protection, all of the\nitems that you mention in your brief as existing to\nresolve disputes, that the only avenue for redress were\nthe courts. So where would that put your argument?\nMR. PALMORE: Well, it's a hard hypothetical\nto answer, of course, because the grievance was filed\npursuant to the collective bargaining agreement.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Putting it aside.\nYou -- you were talking about constitutionalizing a\ngrievance process. I'm going more broadly and saying\nhow much of your argument depends on that fact?\nMR. PALMORE: Well, I think that's an\nimportant part -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What was the meaning\nwould -- it is harder if all they have access to is a\ncourt proceeding.\nMR. PALMORE: I think that's an important\npart of the argument, for this reason: If you look at\nthe Third Circuit's case in San Filippo, the court had a\nkind of a doctrinal basis for its ruling, but it also\nhad a practical concern that not affording protection\nfor this kind of petitioning activity would be a trap to\nthe unwary. But there was really no basis for that\nconcern, because the issue here is when a sovereign\nprovides a remedial mechanism or enters into a\ncollective bargaining agreement that provides a remedial\nmechanism -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How about if they don't?\nMR. PALMORE: It typically -- well -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How about if they don't?\nThat's my point. Then what happens to the Third\nCircuit's definition?\nMR. PALMORE: Well, then I think the -- the\nresult is the same, and -- and our position is you -\nyou still apply Connick, just as speech on matters of\nprivate concern is protected by the First Amendment, yet\nunder Connick, an employee who engages in speech on a\nmatter of private concern is not going to be protected\nin the employment context in all respects.\nAnd that reflects a very important balance\nthat this Court has struck between its view of how the\nConstitution applies to the government as sovereign\nregulator of the general public and how it applies to\nthe government and its proprietary status as an\nemployer. And in that latter situation, Connick has\nbeen critical in providing a bulwark against allowing\nrun-of-the-mill employment disputes from becoming\nconstitutional cases in Federal Court.\nAnd the second main problem with the Third\nCircuit's approach, and it's one that Mr. Ortiz\nhighlighted, is that it privileges petition activity\nover speech activity, contrary to this Court's numerous\nstatements that there is no such hierarchy in the First\nAmendment. So going back to Thomas v. Collins in 1945,\nthe Court called the two rights inseparable.\nIn the United Mine Workers case, which is a\ncase relied on by the other side, it's an access to\ncourts case, the Court interchangeably applied the\nspeech right, the petition right, and the assembly\nright, and it said they were intimately connected in\norigin and purpose. And, of course -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Palmore -- I'm sorry.\nMR. PALMORE: No, please.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Suppose a State legislature\npasses a law depriving all State employees of collective\nbargaining rights, and a State employee files a lawsuit\nsaying that this law violates the State constitution,\nand the State employee is thereupon fired. Is that a\nmatter of public concern or not?\nMR. PALMORE: It -- it likely would be, and\nI think this -- this goes to some of the questions\nJustice Scalia was asking. But as this Court said in\nConnick that the question about -- of whether speech is\na matter of public concern is assessed not only by the\ncontent, but by the form and the context.\nSo in the case that Your Honor is positing,\nthe content of the -- of the speech, which was that an\nact of the legislature was illegal, would suggest that\nit was a matter of public concern, the form, the form of\na lawsuit is relevant to the consideration, and the\ncontext that it came in part of a larger political\ndebate would likely be relevant, too.\nThe problem with the Third Circuit approach\nis that it never engages in that kind of inquiry.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And suppose -- now going\nback to Justice Sotomayor's example, suppose that there\nwere a -- a class action alleging systemic\ndiscrimination in some governmental workplace. Would\nthat be a matter of public concern?\nMR. PALMORE: It very well might be. That's\nsimilar to this Court's decision in the GiVon case. So\nthat was a case where a teacher went to complain to her\nprincipal about the school's general policy of\ndiscrimination, and this Court held that that was speech\non a matter of public concern, that it affected more\nthan just that individual employee's employment status.\nSo many of these hypotheticals and many\nsubmissions and petitions to the government as sovereign\nwill, in fact, satisfy the public concern test, and then\nyou'll get into Pickering balancing.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you -- can you think of\nany instance where speech by the employee would not be\nprotected under the Pickering-Connick free speech\ncalculus but would be protected under the Petition\nClause?\nMR. PALMORE: I think that, no, if you put\nit in that way; this Court has never separately analyzed\nthe two. But I think it is important to note that I\nthink the Connick test already takes into account the\ndistinction between what might be deemed petitioning\nconduct and non-petitioning conduct because of its use\nof the term \"form.\" So, again, the Connick test calls\non courts to look on the content, the context and the\nform. So if the form of an employee complaint takes the\nform of a lawsuit filed in Federal court, that's\nsomething that -- that should be taken into account.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What -- wouldn't a -- a\nwritten letter to -- to the employer, the government\nemployer, similarly be a petition? Is a lawsuit any\nmore of a petition, if indeed it is a petition at all,\nwhich I doubt? Surely filing a statement with the\nemployer is a petition as well. So how does the form\nmake any difference?\nMR. PALMORE: I -- it's -- I think it's a\nserious question about whether a letter submitted to an\nemployer as an employer, not as a sovereign, is a\npetition. But that's the kind of line-drawing that the\nThird Circuit approach requires.\nThis Court has had a very broad conception\nof what counts as petitioning activity, so in Edwards v.\nSouth Carolina the Court said that a march to the\ngrounds of the State capitol in South Carolina to\nprotest segregation was an example of petitioning\nconduct in its most classic and pristine form.\nThe Third Circuit doesn't -- doesn't\ncount -- wouldn't count that as a petition for this\npurpose. It has kind of a gerrymandered view of what\nwill count as a petition, basically a lawsuit and an\nemployee grievance.\nNow, the -- the approach followed by the\nmajority of the circuits and the approach we advocate\ntoday doesn't require that kind of line-drawing, because\nwhether, for example, the grievance filed in this case\nis a petition or not, it's certainly speech, and so we\nwould agree that it's susceptible to analysis under the\nnormal Connick v. Myers framework.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Palmore, what about\nthe distinction that the other side brings up that\nConnick is about what happens inside the workplace -\nyou don't want to disrupt the routine by the kind of\nactivity in which Myers was involved -- but the Petition\nClause, they're talking about conduct outside the\nworkplace, that is a complaint filed in court, nothing\nthat's happening in the workplace.\nMR. PALMORE: Well, I think it's workplace\nrelated and I think that's the test. So I don't think\nit -- you know, where an employee physically was when he\nor she filed the petition isn't really relevant. The\nquestion is the connection to the workplace and the\nconnection to the employer-employee relationship.\nSo as Mr. Ortiz answered before, the NTEU\ncase provides a separate set of protections under the\nFirst Amendment, under the speech protection for\nemployees who engage in speech conduct that has no\nconnection to the workplace, and it would limit the\nability of a government employer to take action against\nsuch an employee.\nBut the conduct here is the -- the\ngrievances that were filed here were obviously\nintimately connected to the workplace relationship\nbetween Chief Guarnieri and the Borough Council. This\nwas not a case like NTEU, where someone wanted to go out\nand give a speech on something that had no connection to\ntheir job or go out and file a lawsuit or some kind of\npetitioning activity on something that had no connection\nto the workplace.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Palmore, on that matter,\none last hypothetical. Suppose the New York City\ncouncil passed a resolution that said a precinct house\nwould be closed all night long from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m.,\nand the chief of -- of that precinct filed suit saying\nthat this was micromanagement and it was going to affect\nthe public safety of the citizenry, and then that chief\nof police was fired.\nIs that a matter of public concern?\nMR. PALMORE: It very well might be. It's\nhard to answer in the abstract, because what this Court\nhas said is that the question has to be analyzed in\nlight of the whole record and in light of the context -\ncontent, the context, and the form.\nIt's not necessary for this Court in this\ncase to decide whether the petitioning and speech\nactivity here was on a matter of public or private\nconcern. The question presented says that it was on a\nmatter of private concern. So all the Court needs to\ndecide is -- is whether that makes a difference or not\nin terms of the constitutional analysis. And then the\nThird Circuit on remand could -- could decide, assuming\nthe arguments were preserved, could look at the whole\nrecord and decide whether the speech activity here was\non a matter of public or private concern.\nIf there are no further questions, we ask\nthe judgment be reversed.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Schnapper.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nNeither the text, history, or purpose of the\nPetition Clause nor the interest of a government\nemployer in an efficient workplace provide a basis for\ndistinguishing and giving less protection to a petition\nbecause it didn't involve a matter of public concern.\nThe text of the Petition Clause certainly\ndraws no such distinction. The subject of the petition\nmust be a grievance and a grievance I think is measured\nby whether the matter is of concern to the petitioner.\nIf it's a problem of concern to the petitioner, that\nsatisfies that constitutional element. It does not\nmatter whether the public cares a lot, it doesn't\ncare -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But all of our cases\nhave equated the Petition Clause reach with that of the\nFirst Amendment, and our cases under the First Amendment\nhave made clear that we don't want to constitutionalize\nthe -- the employee grievance procedures.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Well, with all respect, Mr.\nChief Justice, I don't think this Court is committed to\nthe view that the Petition Clause and the Free Speech\nClause cover exactly the same things. In fact,\nemphatically they -- obviously they don't because the\nFree Speech Clause covers many things that the Petition\nClause would not. It covered, for example, the\nremark -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does the Petition\nClause cover anything that the First Amendment does not?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: I believe so, Your Honor.\nThis Court's decisions in the antitrust area and under\nthe National Labor Relations Act with regard to -- an -\naccess to the government or -- or the courts, they've\nalways been framed solely in terms of the Petition\nClause, not the Free Speech Clause. It would be at\nleast very awkward to characterize those -- those\nproblems as free speech cases, particularly where, as is\ntypically the case, the -- the underlying activity was\non the part of, say, a lawyer rather than an individual\nwho -- who is asserting the petition right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, getting back\nto the second part of my question -\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- in the First\nAmendment cases we were concerned about, as I said,\nconstitutionalizing employee grievances. If you\nconstitutionalize it under the Petition Clause, how is\nthat any less a problem of constitutionalizing it under\nthe First Amendment?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Well, it -- it's our view,\nMr. Chief Justice, that -- and in this respect to some\nextent I think we agree with a statement made by\nPetitioners -- that every gripe that an individual\nemployee might have, indeed most of them, wouldn't be\ncovered by the Petition Clause. In the petition reply\nbrief, the Petitioners state, and we agree with this,\nthat the ordinary, routine e-mails, give and take within\nthe office, that's not covered by the Petition Clause.\nWe would agree with that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All you have to do\nthen is add a sentence to your complaint saying: This\nis an example of how the government employer mistreats\nits employees?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: No.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And then it becomes\nmore generalized?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: No, no, Your Honor. That -\nthat -- that's their view, that -- that it becomes a\nmatter of public concern if you say it affects a lot of\npeople. Our view is that that's not relevant. It -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What if added to that is\n\"and I'm going to sue\" or \"I'm going to file a\ngrievance\"?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: No, Your Honor, saying that\nwouldn't have that effect. The case to which they refer\nis one in which an employee indicated, as indeed\noccurred, that he was going to file a lawsuit, and the\nemployer retaliated in a peremptory fashion because of\nthat. That -- that's been the rule in the Third\nCircuit, it has only come up twice, but if I might point\nout, that's the rule under any -- any number of Federal\nstatutes which protect filing a charge with the EEOC or\nfiling a lawsuit. The lower courts have agreed -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, under -- under the\nFirst Amendment speech clause -\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: We have said that an\nemployee's, public employee's, right to speech can be\nregulated, can be confined, can be restricted beyond\nwhat the State could do for a nonemployee. Are you\nsaying that if -- if the Petition Clause is involved\nthere is no right to restrict what the -- employer does?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: No, Your Honor. No, Your\nHonor. The government -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Then you have to offer a\ntest and you don't want the public concern test, so\nwhat's your test?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: The, the -- that it, the\ngovernment's interest as an employer is part of the\ncalculus if -- if this issue arose under the Petition\nClause, and under ordinary balancing one would look at\nthe nature of the government's interest and the degree\nof burden that's imposed, and that's the way the Court\nhas administered the Petition Clause.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And you would be content\nto apply that analytic, broad analytic framework to the\nPetition Clause?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Yes, that's what the Court\nhas done. Now, that said, I think there are\ncircumstances where the government would be hard pressed\nto argue that it had a generalized interest in stopping\na particular form of petition. For example, the\nPetitioners express a considerable unhappiness that\nthey're subject to suit under section 1983. It's\nexpensive, it requires lawyers, they could have to pay\ncounsel fees. Those are judgments that the Congress of\nthe United States made in 1871 when it adopted section\n1983. It knew the government was -- local governments\nwould be subject to it. When the Congress strikes that\nbalance, and -- and of course, section 1983 is a very\ncomplicated piece of machinery -- the balance Congress\nstruck is -- is ordinarily going to be controlling -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, let's talk about it.\nI find it difficult to believe that lawsuits are covered\nby the Petition Clause when it is very clear that the\nCongress can prevent all lawsuits against the Federal\nGovernment by simply refusing to waive sovereign\nimmunity. Now, you know, how can you have a\nconstitutional guarantee of the right to petition the\ngovernment, which you say includes the -- the right to\n-- to be in law court, and yet the Federal Government\ncan exempt itself from suits in law courts?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Your Honor, the -- the\nFederal Government is not obligated to provide a -- a\nlower court system for -- authorized to hear suits\nagainst it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not talking about just\na lower court system. I'm talking about all suits,\nright up to the Supreme Court. The Federal Government\ncan say: You can't sue us.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: It can. But it cannot set\nup a court system and then punish government employees\nfor using it. They are not -- historic -- if I might\nstep back a couple hundred years here, the -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying that the\nPetition Clause only covers those petitions that the\ngovernment chooses to allow; is -- is that what the\nconstitutional guarantee is? If you choose to allow a\ncertain kind of petition, it is constitutionally\nguaranteed. That's not much of a guarantee.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: No, I think -- I think\nhistorically that -- that's a fairly accurate\ndescription of what has happened with the emergence of\nthe Petition Clause over the last 6 or 700 years of\nAnglo-American history. There were no courts to which\npeople could seek redress against the crown at the time\nof Magna Carta. Over time the courts became available\nto do that. Insofar as they did, on our view, the\nPetition Clause would now apply.\nAnd if I might turn to a question you asked\nearlier. You expressed some skepticism about whether\nthe Petition Clause applies to lawsuits. I note that in\nat least half a dozen decisions that this Court has held\nthat, and I think that was the premise of your\nconcurring opinion in the BE & K Construction case a few\nyears ago.\nAnd we don't in this regard have to get\ndeeply into history in the debate about whether courts\nare covered. The text of the First -- of the Petition\nClause is sufficient on its face. It doesn't say\npetitions to the legislature. It says petitions to the\ngovernment, and that was clearly a deliberate choice,\nbecause the States -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Schnapper, you can\nwrite a letter to the president, you can write a letter\nto your congressional representative, but getting to a\ncourt, you have to pay a filing fee. And since this\nwould be a civil case, this Court has held if you\nhaven't got whatever is the filing fee amount, too bad,\nyou don't have access to the Court.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Yes, Your Honor, and I think\nthose cases are clearly distinguishable. The -- the\ncore historical purpose of concern of the Petition\nClause was reprisals by the government against people\nfor -- for petitioning the government. There's a\nfundamental difference here between what's at stake\nhere, where the Borough is asserting a right to punish\npeople for going to court, and the question about\nwhether the government has an affirmative obligation to\nremove the incidental barriers that may exist to\nbringing lawsuits.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do you -- do you think -\nMR. SCHNAPPER: And so, we think those\ncases are distinguishable.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you suggesting that\nin one of these suits you wouldn't have to pay the\nfiling fee?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: No, no, precisely to the\ncontrary. We are asserting only that the government\ncannot punish Mr. Guarnieri for filing a lawsuit. We\nare not suggesting the government has to pay his filing\nfee, any more than if -- if the -- if Mr. Guarnieri\nwants to go to Harrisburg and meet with his or her\nrepresentative, the government, our view, Duryea, can't\npunish him for doing it, but they don't have to give him\ngas money, and if he doesn't have enough money for gas\nthat's just too bad.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Suppose the Borough here\nbought something from a company under a contract that\nincluded an arbitration clause. Would that, would the\nright of the company to engage in arbitration be\nprotected by the Petition Clause?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Yes. The -- we believe the\nPetition Clause applies to government-created mechanisms\nfor redressing grievances; and if the government sets up\nan arbitration procedure like that, we think that that's\ncovered. An arbitration agreement between two private\nparties would not be, be covered by the Petition Clause,\nbecause the government wouldn't have been involved in\nstanding that up. And that distinction really has its\nroots in history. The petition started out; back at the\ntime of Magna Carta petitions only went to the king.\nOver time the British government and ultimately the\nAmerican government developed other mechanisms that were\nsimply more efficient.\nSo that, for example, at the time the\nPetition Clause was written, Congress received a large\nnumber of petitions from wounded veterans, and after\nseveral years of dealing with that it adopted the\nInvalid Pension Act and turned that over to a somewhat\nunusual combination of administrative and judicial\nofficials. So I think the creation of -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What's the earliest English\nor American case you have that refers to a lawsuit as\nprotected by the Petition Clause?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: I'm not familiar with\nEnglish law in that respect. With regard to the\ndecisions of this Court, I think it's California Motor\nTransport, which I think is about 40 years ago.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How many?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: About 40.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: 40 years ago.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: There's precious little -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So for a couple hundred\nyears, nobody -- nobody connected the two?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Many of the constitutional\nissues this Court deals with were not raised for -- for\na very long period of time.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In the Garcetti case, the\ndistrict attorney was disciplined for sending a memo\nbecause he disagreed with how the trial strategy was\nsupposed to unfold, and then he actually made that\nargument in court and was disciplined for that.\nWould he have been protected if he had just\ngone to court to sue the office of the district attorney\non some sort of a prospective injunction saying, with\nreference to all search warrants you should follow the\nfollowing procedures? Would that have been protected,\neven though the memo was not?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Well, it would have been a\npetition. It would not necessarily have been protected.\nThe government has an interest in such matters as an\nemployer, and that might indeed outweigh -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Would you have objected if\nthe same analysis were used in the Petition Clause case\nas in the actual case? Just take the -\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Right, right. The question\nis, was the -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Just white out \"Speech\nClause\" and put in \"Petition Clause\" and file the same\nopinion?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: The question I take it\nyou're asking is -- is whether the Garcetti principle\nwould apply to a Petition Clause case where the\ngovernment -- it was part of the official -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I want to know how the\nanalytic framework differs.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: I don't -- I don't think -\nthe specific question is whether the Garcetti rule\nshould apply in a Petition Clause case. I don't think\nwe have a position on that. It's not raised in this\ncase.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Schnapper, can I\nask Justice Kennedy's question in maybe a little bit of\na different way?\nIn -- in the Connick inquiry, you have a\nthreshold inquiry and then you have a balancing test.\nNow, you're suggesting that the threshold inquiry, the\npublic concern inquiry, is kind of apples and oranges\nhere; it's just not appropriate for the Petition Clause.\nBut the question that then follows is,\nshould there be a replacement threshold inquiry before\nyou get to the balancing that Connick suggests is the\nsecond stage of the process?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Probably not in the sense\nthat you're asking. There would be a threshold inquiry\nas to whether what had happened was petitioning. If it\nwere, this Court's decisions indicate that the Court\nmight impose a threshold inquiry consistent with, say,\nthe line of cases, most recently BE&K Construction, as\nto whether the underlying petition had a -- a reasonable\nbasis or was -- had been pursued in good faith. But I\nthink if you got past that, then there would be no\nfurther threshold.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What if a number of\nmunicipal employees prepare a formal document called\n\"Petition,\" and they say: We have a grievance, and our\ngrievance is that the quality of the food in the\ncafeteria is poor? Now, is that protected by the\nPetition Clause?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: As you describe it, on our\nview, not so, because our view is that, putting aside\nthe historical and somewhat unusual but less common\ninstance of a petition directed to, let's say at the\nFederal level the Congress or the president, the\nPetition Clause ordinarily applies only where the\ngovernment has created a specific remedial mechanism for\naddressing a particular kind of grievance. It's\nsomething that's just outside the ordinary give-and-take\nof the office, something like, you know, a separate\nagency or an arbitrator or a court, something like that.\nAnd that -- there's an historical -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Where does that rule come\nfrom? It's drawn out of thin air?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: No. No, it isn't. That's\nthe -- historically, that's the kind of distinction that\nwas there. If you had a problem in England, if the\nundersheriff took your cow, you could go to the sheriff,\nbut historically, that wasn't called a petition. If you\nwent to the king, that was a petition. It was not going\nto the local.\nSo we -- we do have a great deal of\nhistorical material, as Justice Scalia points out, about\nindividuals, including Federal Government officials,\npetitioning Congress. And I -- we think the framers\nwould have regarded those as petitions. I don't think\nthey would regard a beef with the Secretary of the\nTreasury as -- as -- so we would -- there's no -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Schnapper, this is\nnot -- if you're -- if you're talking about the\npractical significance, Myers in Connick was going\naround the office, collecting signatures. She was\ntaking a poll. She was taking a poll and the poll was\ngoing to be presented to the employer. That sounds much\nmore petition-like than filing a grievance pursuant to a\ncollective bargaining agreement.\nSo the -- the distinction between Connick,\nwho was taking a poll -- why wasn't that a petition?\nMaybe -- did she just put the wrong label on it? If she\ncalled her case a petition case, it would have been all\nright?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: No. No, Your Honor. Our\nview, as I indicated to Justice Alito, is that a gripe\nwithin the office, whether you label it a petition or\nnot, would not, except in maybe some extraordinary\ncircumstance, constitute a petition.\nBut if I might respond, I think your\nquestion raises a second important linguistic point,\nwhich is the word \"petition\" today has acquired a\nsomewhat different meaning than it would have probably\nhad in the 18th century. We think of petitions as the\nthings you see out on tables, along the street; people\nsay, come on, sign my petition to do this, that, or the\nother thing.\nThat was not a common phenomena in the 18th\ncentury. Petitions were ordinarily things from one\nindividual or a couple of people. There were some\nexceptions, but that was -- that was not the normal -\nthe normal practice. In fact, the very idea that you\ncould have large numbers of people signing something\ncalled a petition was much controverted at that time.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you're the expert in\nthis area, but that -- that surprises me. I thought it\nwas quite common in the early 1800s for you to go to all\nyour neighbors -- and the book \"Quarreling About\nSlavery\" explains this, where there were petitions\nsigned by many of the constituents in the congressman's\ndistrict.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: There -- there were. It\ncame to be used that way as -- that is largely a -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And there were scores,\nscores of -- of signatures on these petitions. So\nthat's like your card table.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: It is, but what I'm\nsuggesting is that is a 19th and 20th-century\nphenomenon. You see very little of that in the 18th\ncentury or earlier. And I'd note, although -- I mean,\nI, I think that if that's done by private individuals\nand directed to the government, it would be protected by\nthe Petition Clause.\nI note, just to give you a sense of the\nhistory, that at the time that happened, its legitimacy\nwas challenged, and the argument was made by the\nproponents of slavery in support of a gag order adopted\nby Congress that this was not really a legitimate\npetition. The legitimate petition ought to be something\nabout your personal problems; an abolitionist really had\nno business signing these things; it wasn't a personal\ngrievance.\nNow, I think that's wrong. I think it's\ncertainly not consistent with current case law. But it\nillustrates how the position advanced by Petitioners\nstands on its head the historical evolution of the\nPetition Clause, which starts as about private matters,\nand only over time and after a good deal of struggle is\nit extended to things of broader concern and possibly a\npetition signed by people who don't have a personal\nstake in -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That was the Calhoun\nposition, not the John Q. Adams position.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Right. Right. That's\nright.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Schnapper, let's come\nto the century in which we are now living. We have\nTitle VII. Title VII has this provision, an explicit\nprovision against retaliation. But suppose it didn't.\nSuppose it just prohibited discrimination and it didn't\nhave a retaliation clause. It's the thrust of your\narguments that the government employee would have a\nclaim for retaliation, although someone in the private\nsector would not?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Exactly. Exactly. And here\nwe part company with -- I think the government expressed\nthe concern in its brief and perhaps at oral argument --\nI guess it was Petitioner that made this point -- that\nthere was something amiss about government employees\nhaving rights that private employees don't. That\ndistinction exists because the Bill of Rights and the -\nand the other constitutional guarantees, with the\nexception of the Thirteenth Amendment and the right to\ntravel in interstate commerce, those rights don't apply\nto private -- to people dealing with private employers.\nThat's just -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But -- but that's\nthe basis of our law in this area is that when the\ngovernment is actually the employer the rights of the\nindividuals are somewhat different, and they're closer\nto the rights that private employees have. So simply\nsaying that these constitutional provisions apply\nagainst the government and therefore, you don't have to\nworry about the distinction between private employers\nand government employers doesn't seem to be -- me to be\ncompletely responsive to our precedent.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: And -- and we're not taking\nissue with the assertion of the government that the\ngovernment as an employer has interests which are\ndifferent than it -- it -- those it has just as a\nsovereign. But that distinction has nothing to do with\nthe distinction they propose in this case between\nmatters of public concern and matters of only private\nconcern.\nIndeed, to the contrary. To the extent that\nthe government's -- the government's interests might be\ngreater, surely a petition that deals with a matter of\npublic importance is going to cause the government a lot\nmore trouble than a purely private matter. A lawsuit\nalleging systemic employment discrimination on the basis\nof religion or even an individual, if -- if\nMr. Guarnieri had alleged and a court had found that he\nhad been fired because he was Catholic, the\nramifications politically and in terms of just -- the\nramifications in terms of the workplace would have been\nfar more serious than the -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Schnapper, isn't the\nreal question in these cases whether the employee is\nacting as a citizen or instead whether the employee is\nacting as an employee? And in the speech cases, that\ndistinction suggests a public concern threshold inquiry.\nMaybe in the petition cases it suggests something else,\nbut that that's really the question we should be asking\nis, is this employee acting as an employee or as a\ncitizen?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: With all due respect, our\nview is it depends whether or not the -- the employee is\nacting as a petitioner within the meaning of the\nPetition Clause. The petition Clause was not adopted,\nlike the Free Speech Clause, to foster a vigorous public\ndebate. The purpose of the Petition Clause, as the\nCourt said in Christopher v. Harbury, is to enable an\nindividual to seek relief for a wrong. And that has -\nthat's not the same as the -- the free speech interests\nthat -- that might exist to engage as a citizen in a\nrobust public debate.\nMr. Guarnieri didn't file his complaint in\nFederal court, for example, looking to the second\npetition, in the hopes of a robust debate between\nhimself and Judge Caputo. He -- he filed that complaint\nto get redress for an alleged violation of his\nconstitutional rights.\nSo -- so the citizen versus employee\ndistinction in -- in Connick is inapt here. It's -\nit's -- it's rooted in the purpose of the -- of the Free\nSpeech Clause, which is protecting vigorous public\ndebate on matters of public concern. The Petition\nClause is not about matters of public concern. It's\nabout -- about people's ability to seek redress. It\ndoesn't guarantee redress, but it protects the ability\nto ask for it.\nThe -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You do, I think,\nrecognize that it would be possible then to circumvent\nConnick if you could turn around and file a pleading and\nsay: Now I have a petition, not just a grievance.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Your Honor, we don't think\nthat that is a serious problem for three reasons. First\nof all, the Petitioners have in -- in highly expressive\nlanguage described the decision in Filippo as one which\nwould lead to an avalanche, tsunami, an overwhelming\nnumber of new lawsuits.\nWe pointed out in our reply brief that they\nhad not adduced any evidence that any such thing had\nhappened in the 17 years since San Filippo. Their reply\nbrief does not purport to have any information to -- to\nsupport that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but things\nwill be a lot different if we give the sanction to your\ntheory. I think the idea that it hasn't happened in 17\nyears in the wake of San Filippo is a little bit -- it's\nnot very compelling.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Well, I think your -- I\nthink there are two -- two other reasons why this is not\na -- a major concern. The first one is it simply isn't\nthe case that you could take any beef, write \"Federal\ncomplaint\" at the top of it and file it in Federal court\nand be protected. Most internal gripes don't raise a\ncolorable claim under Federal or State law, and this\nCourt's Petition Clause cases make it clear that a\npetition, particularly a lawsuit, that doesn't have a\nreasonable basis simply isn't going to be protected.\nIt's also, to be frank, based on my contact\nwith private petitioners, it's highly unrealistic to\nsuggest that if an employee, government employee, took\nsome gripe and went to a lawyer and said, let's file\nthis in Federal court, I want to get it off my chest, to\nfind a lawyer on a contingent fee basis that is going to\ndo that. If a chance case has no chance of success,\nyou're not going to find a lawyer who will do it; and on\na police officer's salary, you're certainly not going to\nbe able to hire one.\nThird -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but the most\nlikely solution when you have an employee grievance\nalong with it is that some umbrella settlement -- I\nmean, the employer doesn't want to spend -- I mean,\nthat's part of the reason our doctrine developed under\nthe First Amendment. The employer doesn't want to have\nto worry about spending time and money in court to\nresolve what is essentially an employee grievance.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Few -- few private lawyers\nwho aren't independently wealthy are going to take a\nbaseless case on the theory that they're going to get\nsome umbrella settlement. It's just -- it simply\ndoesn't happen. It -- it -- and realistically, we don't\nreally have a plausible account of why an employee would\ndo this. I mean, you're an employee, you're unhappy\nwith the way you're being treated at work, you -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counselor, your client\nwon everything in his collective bargaining grievance.\nHe got his pay back, he got them to stop doing what they\ndid, and he found a lawyer to file a constitutional\nclaim. So your suggestion that lawyers won't fight\nsemi-chaotic adventures is realistic as well.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Your Honor, this -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: People get upset about\nhow they're treated all of the time, and they find\nlawyers to file suits about that treatment.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Your Honor, I can certainly\ntell you that people who are upset all the time call me\nostensibly unable to find lawyers. I mean, remember,\nthe -- the fact that Mr. Guarnieri was able to find a\nlawyer to take this case doesn't prove that people can\nfind lawyers to take baseless cases. Mr. Guarnieri\nfound a lawyer, she brought this case, she got past\nsummary judgment, she took it to trial and she won.\nThis is a case that not only had a substantial basis,\nbut on the facts, and this issue is no longer before us,\nshe prevailed.\nIf the Court has no -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Your submission is there are\nnot very many -- throughout the whole country there are\nvery few frivolous 1983 cases or employment cases,\nthat's your point?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: No, they -- they -\ncertainly they happen, but the notion that this is going\nto unleash a flood of them seems to me unrealistic.\nA particular institution like this where the\ntheory of this is that the private -- the government\nemployee reads Connick, realizes they can't write a\nletter to the boss with -- with their gripe, and\nundissatisfied with their ability to talk about it with\nfriends and family and gripe with pals at the bar,\ndecides that the only way they can get it off their\nchest is to have it be in a complaint in some Federal\ncourthouse, where it would then probably be dismissed.\nI think in the real world that's something that would\nmake very little sense to an employee.\nIf the Court has no further questions -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Ortiz, you have a minute left.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL R. ORTIZ\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. ORTIZ: Your Honor, it defies the\nimagination that the radical Republicans and the framers\nunderstood that the Petition Clause would\nconstitutionalize public employee grievance, and as\nacademic commentary that Respondent cites suggests,\ntheir -- Respondents long-centered view of the Petition\nClause would call into question, sovereign immunity\ndoctrine, parts of Rule 11, suggest a right to appeal\nand a right to judicial review whenever anyone has\nagreed to government action.\nThere is also a danger that it would\nconstitutionalize the arbitration process whenever the\ngovernment is a party.\nIf I can just answer one question. Connick\nis focused not on where speech happens, as Respondent\ninsists, but rather where its effects occur. As this\nCourt held in the City of San Diego v. Roe, employee\nspeech completely outside of the workplace raises the\nsame kind of concerns.\nIf there are no further questions,\nPetitioners will rest on their submissions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
