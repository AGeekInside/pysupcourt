GUERRA\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. GUERRA: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe government claims in this case that\nCongress decided to treat retaliation against Federal\nworkers who complain of age discrimination differently\nthan every other species of retaliatory conduct, that\nfor age-based retaliation alone Congress created a\nfour-part patchwork scheme in which a small cadre of\nFederal employees have a full judicial remedy, but tens\nof thousands of others who suffer retaliatory conduct\nhave absolutely no remedies at all.\nThis scheme is inconsistent with over three\ndecades of administrative interpretations by the\nagencies charged with administering and enforcing the\nstatute and it is flatly inconsistent, most importantly,\nwith the plain language and historical origins of the\nstatute itself. By its plain terms, Section 633a(a)\nbars retaliation against covered workers who have\ncomplained that have they suffered age discrimination.\nSuch retaliation is directed at persons over --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. By its plain\nterms?\nMR. GUERRA: Yes, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Read it to me, would you?\nMR. GUERRA: The provision is: \"All\npersonnel actions shall be made\" -- \"affecting covered\nemployees shall be made free from any discrimination\nbased on age.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is retaliation\ndiscrimination based on age? I can see your argument\nthat it ought to be covered, but to say that the plain\nlanguage covers it, I mean that's extraordinary. The\nplain language doesn't cover it.\nMR. GUERRA: With respect, Justice Scalia, I\nsubmit it does cover it for at least three reasons.\nFirst of all discrimination -- retaliatory conduct aimed\nat a 40-year-old or someone over age 40 because he or\nshe is asserting rights she possesses by virtue of being\nage 40 or older is discrimination based on age.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, it's not. I\nmean, a company could have a policy of firing everybody\nwho complains about anything and the fact that a worker\nis over the age of 40 and is fired does not mean that he\nis being fired because of age.\nMR. GUERRA: Mr. Chief Justice, the issue in\nthis case is whether plaintiff is entitled to allege and\nultimately prove that she was -- she suffered adverse\npersonnel actions because she complained of age\ndiscrimination. It may be that in some, that in a\ncertain case the employer could demonstrate that in fact\nthe retaliatory conduct was not triggered by the nature\nof the complaint, and in fact there have been Title VII\ncases where the courts have found that it was the manner\nin which a complaint was lodged, that there was, that\nthere was false statements or it was too inflammatory,\nand so the employer prevailed.\nBut if -- the issue here is whether, if\nMs. Gomez can prove ultimately that the retaliatory\nconduct was a function of the fact that as a 40-year-old\nshe was asserting her rights to be free from age\ndiscrimination, we submit that is covered by the plain\nlanguage of the statute. And that is confirmed by this\ncourt's interpretation of Title IX in the Jackson case\nbecause there the Court --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course the\nstatute that covers age discrimination in the private\nsector does have an express provision addressing\nretaliation. The one that governs Federal employees\ndoes not, and that's the government's main argument,\nthat it's expressed in the private sector, it's not\nthere in the public sector and so you shouldn't imply\none. What's your answer to that?\nMR. GUERRA: Mr. Chief Justice, three\nresponses to that. First of you, as this Court\nexplained in Jackson itself, it's improper to narrow the\nscope of a stand-alone general discrimination ban that\ndoes not identify any discriminatory practices based on\na comparison with an enumeration ban that sets forth a\ndetailed series of prohibitions. And that's precisely\nthe comparison that the Court rejected in Jackson and\nthe government is asking the court to draw here.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But in Jackson it was in a\ndifferent statute and here it's in the same statute.\nSurely that makes a big difference.\nMR. GUERRA: It doesn't in this case,\nJustice Scalia, for two reasons. First of all,\nsubsection (f) of section 633a effectively deems the\nprivate sector and the Federal sector provisions of the\nAge Act to be the functional equivalents of two separate\nstatutes. So I think that distinction is refuted by\nthat provision. But more fundamentally, the\ngovernment's argument --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not familiar with that\nprovision. What does that provision say?\nMR. GUERRA: That is the provision that the\ngovernment cites in its brief and it provides that:\n\"Any personnel action of any department, agency, or\nother entity referred to in subsection (a) of this\nsection shall not be subject to or affected by any\nprovision of this chapter other than the provisions of\nSection 631b of this title.\" And the government's\nposition is that that provision makes these statutory\nschemes utterly distinct from one another.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, no. I mean, they're\nall in the same, in the same statute, and what that\nprovision says is that just because we give certain\nrelief in, in the portion applicable to private\ndiscrimination, does not mean that we give that relief\nin the section applicable to government discrimination,\nwhere it is explicitly withheld -- it can't be\nexplicitly withheld -- where it is withheld, although\nit's explicitly included for private discrimination. I\nthink that's the only sensible way to read that\nprovision. It surely doesn't make two statutes out of,\nout of one. It is simply one statute.\nMR. GUERRA: Justice Scalia, if I may, two\npoints. One is it's clear that the scope of the\nlanguage of 633a(a) is broader in its own right than\n623a, which is the -- or 623a and 623b operate in\nconjunction with each other. So we know that the\nstand-alone prohibition in the Federal sector side is\nintended to be broader than the -- the discrimination\nban of 623(a). So it's not anomalous at all to conclude\nthat because it sweeps more broadly and because it's not\nlimited by any other provision that operates in\nconjunction with it, that there's no basis for drawing a\nnegative inference.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, why would Congress\nhave taken this drafting approach? The private sector\nprovisions were already in existence when it made the\nstatute applicable to Federal workers and there was a\nspecific provision prohibiting retaliation in the\nprivate sector. If Congress wanted to carry that over\nto the Federal sector, why wouldn't they have either\ncopied that or incorporated it? And they did neither,\nand in fact they enacted a provision that says that the\nprivate sector provisions are not incorporated unless\nthey're specifically noted. And this isn't one of the\nones that's noted.\nMR. GUERRA: Justice Alito, if I could --\nthe second point I was going to address to Justice\nScalia I think answers this, this point. Congress did\nthe exact same thing in Title VII two years earlier. It\ncould have added Federal employers to the definition of\nemployer and subjected them to the private sector regime\nthere, but instead it created a stand-alone prohibition.\nIf you take the government's logic in this case and\napply it to Title VII, it would lead to the conclusion\nthat the Federal sector ban in Title VII, which is\n717(a), does not bar retaliation either, and yet we know\nthat's not true. Because --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why? This Court hasn't\nso held. We haven't had that issue before us.\nMR. GUERRA: You -- that's correct, Your\nHonor. It's not true because of this Court's holdings,\nbut it's true because of the structure of the statute,\nthe consistent interpretations of the lower courts and\nthe administrative agency. The structure of the statute\nis, in 717(a), the language, the prohibition there is\nvirtually identical to the prohibition here except it\nproscribes race discrimination, et cetera, instead of\nage discrimination.\nThen, in the remedy section Congress\nexplicitly made a remedy for retaliation available for\nviolations of 717(a)'s substantive norm. The only\nreason to do that was because Congress understood that\nsubstantive norm to prohibit retaliation. Congress then\ncopied that very same language into 633a(a), thereby\ngiving it the same breadth.\nAnd so the negative inference theory the\ngovernment puts forward with respect to Title VII fails\non that statute because of the incorporation of the\nremedies, we know that that prohibition bars\nretaliation. And because the norm at issue here was\ncopied from that Federal sector prohibition in Title\nVII, the same reasoning dictates that the argument fail\nhere as well.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The Federal\nemployee, though, has all of the remedies under the\nCivil Service Reform Act for any type of employment\npractice. Those remedies are elaborately reticulated\nand almost impenetrable, and yet this would add\ncomplication. In other words, despite all the remedies\nunder the CSRA that says in some cases you go here, in\nother cases you go here, and you get different types of\nreview depending on the facts, all of that would be\nwiped away if you can bring a direct action under the\nage discrimination statute.\nMR. GUERRA: Three points, Mr. Chief\nJustice: First of all, everything you just said would\nbe equally true of discrimination under Title VII, and\nyet the government acknowledges that retaliatory conduct\nfor race discrimination claims, sex discrimination\nclaims, can all be brought directly in court,\nnotwithstanding the existence of the CSRA.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Did the government --\nwell, we'll ask the government, but I thought they kind\nof qualified that in their brief. The brief says that\nthe case -- this case presents no occasion to consider\nwhether Title VII's ban on discrimination against\nFederal sector employees incorporates that Act's private\nsector retaliation ban. So they haven't made a\nconcession.\nMR. GUERRA: Well, I -- Justice Ginsburg, I\nread them to be conceding for purposes of this case and\nthe analysis of this case, and if they're willing to\nacknowledge, at least for purposes of this case, that\nall these other retaliatory claims can be brought\noutside of the CSRA regime, it makes no sense, I submit,\nto single out retaliation based on age discrimination\nclaims. And, in fact, Congress --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think you're saying even\nif, even if that were the case, they would still urge\nthe Court to come out the way they do. I don't think\nthey're conceding that that's the case.\nMR. GUERRA: But, Justice Scalia, even if --\nif -- even if taken on the \"even if\" premise, you still\nare in the situation where you have an irrational\ndistinction by saying the CSRA is the exclusive remedy\nfor retaliation for age complaints and yet not for\nretaliation under Title VII.\nAlso, Mr. Chief Justice, the CSRA itself\nexplicitly carves out claims under the ADEA and Title\nVII. So, Congress did not view it as the exclusive --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But not retaliation\nclaims. In other words, although the direct claims, as\nyou put it, may or may not be carved out, a retaliation\nclaim fits under the employment practices provisions of\nthe CSRA, regardless of the basis for retaliation. In\nother words, you took personnel action against me for an\nimpermissible basis and therefore I'm entitled to the\nvarious civil service remedies.\nMR. GUERRA: That's -- that's correct,\nMr. Chief Justice. And of course, the CSRA covers\nretaliation that has nothing to do with complaints of\nemployment discrimination as well. So it would not be\nrendered a dead letter by recognizing our position.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Does it cover your client?\nMR. GUERRA: I don't believe it would,\nJustice Souter, because she did not suffer an adverse\naction. No, and in fact putting that aside --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: She could complain; it's\njust that she couldn't go very far with the complaint.\nMR. GUERRA: Well, more fundamentally,\nJustice Ginsburg, she's not covered at all by the CSRA.\nAnd that was the third point I wanted to make. The CSRA\nexcludes thousands of employees.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it does that for\na reason. We have a lot of cases in the Federal Circuit\nand the D.C. Circuit that addresses a lot of these\nproblems say that when the CSRA excludes certain types\nof claims of employees, they do it for a reason. In\nother words, it's not simply that they didn't cover them\nor inadvertence, but they make the decision that the\nremedies that they've provided don't apply in a\nparticular case. And to say that those people who are\nexcluded under the CSRA nonetheless have remedies for\nemployment practices seems to me to undermine that --\nthat judgment.\nMR. GUERRA: Mr. Chief Justice, with\nrespect, the problem with the government's reliance on\nthe statute is that it doesn't -- on their view, White\nHouse employees and congressional employees have a full\njudicial remedy for retaliation suffered for raising age\ndiscrimination complaints. And our argument is it makes\nno sense to permit that one band of employees, many\nhigh-level policy employee -- policymakers, to bring\nretaliation claims in Federal court, while excluding\nPostal Service workers who have only collective\nbargaining rights and tens of thousands of other\nemployees for --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The answer is that it\ndoesn't exclude them, that they have all these\ncollective bargaining rights; they have the civil\nservice rights; they can go and bring their same claim\nwith other remedies. You could make the opposite claim:\nWhy should they have two rights? Everybody else has\none. I mean, that seems to me what they're argument is\nunderlying this.\nThen when you go to Title VII -- and this I\ndon't understand fully. Look at Title VII and Title VII\nin 16(e) has a basic ban. Is that right?\nMR. GUERRA: That's correct, Justice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And then, in 16(d) it says\ncertain of those things govern Federal suits, suits\nagainst the Federal Government. Then it incorporates\nsome provisions. And it says that you get that certain\nrelief against the Federal Government where there is\ndiscrimination on account of race, color, religion, sex,\nor national origin. Then it says \"or in violation of\n3(a).\" And then 3(a) refers to retaliation.\nSo it looks like Title VII does give you a\nremedy, in 3(a), for retaliation. And it's rather\nspecific, and that suggests that those other words don't\npick up retaliation. It's rather that specific thing.\nNow, what have I missed?\nMR. GUERRA: Justice Breyer, the -- you are\nright to focus on these remedies, but the remedies\nthemselves are not incorporated as substantive bans.\nThey are simply remedies, and our point is by making a\nretaliation remedy available for a violation of the ban\nthat you identified in subsection 717(a), Congress\nnecessarily understood that substantive ban, 717(a), to\nprohibit retaliation. Otherwise there would be no\nreason to provide a remedy for retaliation as one of the\nremedies for a violation of --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, you could say that,\nbut you could also say, well, look here in Title VII\nCongress has some words, and these words give you a\nspecific -- if you're a Federal employee and somebody's\nretaliating against you because you went and complained\nabout race or something, just read those words; you can\nbring a lawsuit, right? Am I right about that?\nMR. GUERRA: I don't think so --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No?\nMR. GUERRA: -- Justice Breyer. You can\nbring a lawsuit under section --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You go to the EEOC?\nMR. GUERRA: Well, you can bring a lawsuit\nunder Title VII if you are a person, an employee or\napplicant aggrieved.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where is this stuff? Where\nis this text that we're talking about?\nMR. GUERRA: I apologize, Justice Scalia.\nIt is not in --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's not in your brief.\nIt's not in the appendix. So I don't know what you're\ntalking about.\nMR. GUERRA: I am talking about subsection\n(c) of 717a, the Federal sector provisions of Title VII.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Which we don't have here\nnow. I guess I can ask --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I'm not totally\ncertain what I'm talking about either. So we could go\non.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GUERRA: I'd like to think I -- I can\nilluminate the -- the language that authorizes Federal\nemployees to bring suits for violations of Title VII\nsays that if they are aggrieved by final disposition of\nthe complaint, they may bring a civil action under Title\nVII, and aggrieved -- they can bring complaints for\nviolations of subsection (a), which like subsection (a)\nin our statute says \"all personnel actions affecting\nemployees or applicants for employment shall be made\nfree from any discrimination based on race, color,\nreligion,\" et cetera.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Or in violation of --\nMR. GUERRA: No, it does not say that,\nJustice Breyer. The prohibition of subsection (a) of\n717a in substantive terms is identical, except it\nspecifies a different protected status. So this is a\nban on discrimination based on race, color, religion,\nand you are authorized to bring a suit if you are\naggrieved by a violation of that provision, and one of\nthe remedies that's made available is a remedy that's\navailable for violations of the private sector provision\non retaliation.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why is that so clear,\nbecause section 2000e, 16(d) says section, whatever it\nis, f through k of this title, as applicable, shall\ngovern civil actions brought hereunder. And if there is\nno right against retaliation, then the remedy wouldn't\nbe applicable.\nMR. GUERRA: Justice Ginsburg, the language\n\"as applicable\" I submit has to be referring to whether\nthe case itself would implicate the need for that\nremedy. In other words, it would not be applicable to\nhave a reinstatement remedy in a case where there was no\ndischarge.\nBut the reading that you have suggested\nassumes that Congress didn't know what it was -- the\nscope of the prohibition it enacted in Section 717(a)\nand was effectively saying: Here are some remedies; we\ndon't know whether they apply or not, but if they do, go\nahead and use them.\nAnd I submit that is an improper assumption\nabout congressional understanding of its own\nlegislation. The proper assumption is that Congress\nunderstood 717(a) to bar retaliation. That's why it\nprovided a retaliation remedy, and that assumption is\nbuttressed by the fact that, as this Court explained in\nthe Brown v. GSA case, Congress adopted Title VII\nprecisely because it found that fear of reprisal had\nmade the old scheme ineffective.\nSo it makes perfect sense that it would want\nto prohibit retaliation under Title VII in the Federal\nsector because reprisals had rendered the old\nprotections useless.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, could you proceed\nwith that? That is, a very simple way of thinking of\nthis as one possible way of reading it is that Congress\nsays: When private employers discriminate, there can be\nwhistleblower's, and they need protection; so let's put\nsome in. When State officials discriminate, say, on the\nbasis of race, there can be some whistleblower's. Maybe\nthey protect them in some States; maybe they don't\nprotect them in others. We better put some in. When\nFederal Government officials discriminate against on the\nbasis of race, whistleblower's should be protected.\nBut we have a whole system here to protect\nthem. And so let's just use that system and treat all\nwhistleblower's alike, and that's the end of the matter.\nWe don't need any special protection for whistleblower's\nhere.\nNow, the answer to that is what?\nMR. GUERRA: That is the very system that\nCongress had deemed ineffective to prevent retaliation\nfor the very claims you're talking about in -- and\nthat's why it chose to adopt the amendments to Title VII\nin 1972. That's what the Brown case canvasses; and, in\nfact --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's sort of\nbegging the question. I mean, you're saying it's not\ntrue because our interpretation of Title VII is true.\nBut the point goes to how you ought to interpret Title\nVII. That is, it makes more sense to say when it's\nretaliatory action you use your Federally prescribed\nremedies within the agency.\nI mean, it doesn't answer the point that\nJustice Breyer made to say, because we want to interpret\nTitle VII the way we want to interpret it. His point\nis: One reason to interpret it the way you do want to\ninterpret it is that it makes more sense to have all of\nthe Federal remedies applied through the agency, through\nthe agency mechanism, rather than in court.\nMR. GUERRA: Justice Scalia, I apologize if\nI wasn't clear in my response, but what I'm saying is\nthat in the Brown case this Court looked at the\nlegislative history of Title VII -- excuse me -- yes, in\n1972 and 1977 -- and said that the reason Congress\nadopted these, this new prohibition, was because the\nvery scheme that Justice Breyer is suggesting would have\nbeen a fix for whistle blowing was ineffective. That --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then it's ineffective here.\nMR. GUERRA: And it is ineffective here.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And if it's ineffective\nhere and Congress has made it clear that the only way to\ncure the ineffectiveness is with a separate provision\nand you don't have a separate provision, you're out.\nMR. GUERRA: That's correct. And the\nineffectiveness here is because of the extraordinarily\nlimited nature of the types of conduct that would\ntrigger any rights that the employee could control under\nthe CSRA. Retaliation rarely takes the form of a\nremoval from position or a suspension of more than 14\ndays. The most typical things are poor performance\nevaluations, what we have in this case, allegations of\ngroundless charges of misconduct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When you qualified\nyour answer by saying that the employee can control, was\nthat a way to dismiss the collective bargaining rights?\nMR. GUERRA: Well, I was talking about\nactually the -- the -- you can complain about\nnon-adverse actions under the CSRA, but all you can do\nis ask the Office of Special Counsel to investigate.\nAnd then you have no right to compel any further action\nat any step of the process. So if the counsel decides\nnot to investigate, that's the end of the matter. If\nthey do and the agency refuses to take their advice,\nthat's the end of the matter. There's no judicial\nremedy for the vast majority of retaliatory actions that\na Federal employee could suffer under the CSRA.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about review\nunder -- by the Merit Systems Protection Board?\nMR. GUERRA: That is the remedy under the\nCSRA, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So when you're\ntalking about the Office of Special Counsel --\nMR. GUERRA: If the Office of Special\nCounsel doesn't pursue the case -- and the statistics in\nthe NTEU brief suggest that it rarely -- out of\nthousands and thousands of complaints, it pursued only\nin a small handful. You have no right as the employee\nto do anything, to go to the MSPB or to any Federal\ncourt, if they decide not to pursue that claim. And so\nthat is -- and, again, both because Title VII, I submit,\nclearly based on the remedial structure, would allow\nemployees to bring all types of retaliation claims\nunrelated to age discrimination complaints in Federal\ncourt, it doesn't make sense for Congress to have\nrelegated older workers who suffer age discrimination to\nthis one scheme, especially because it excludes --\nPetitioner herself has no rights under the CSRA.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Guerra, can you help\nme on a provision of the statute that I'm a little\npuzzled about? Am I correct in believing that Section\n2000e-16, which is the provision under Title -- 42\nU.S.C. -- I'm using the code number -- that that is the\nprovision that makes the Federal Government liable for\nretaliation based on sex and race?\nMR. GUERRA: That is.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is there another provision\nthat is necessary for there to be a remedy against the\nFederal Government?\nMR. GUERRA: For retaliation based on race\nand sex?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Under Title VII.\nMR. GUERRA: No. That's the remedy.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Then -- your argument, if\nI understand it, is that precisely the same language\nthat's found in 2000-16e is found in 233a.\nMR. GUERRA: 633a.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: 633a.\nMR. GUERRA: Yes, Justice Stevens.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And, therefore, the two\nshould be treated alike?\nMR. GUERRA: Precisely. That is the -- that\nis our -- one of our central arguments. Of course, we\nalso realize --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: In other words, that the\nlanguage \"shall be made free from any discrimination\nbased on race, color, or religion,\" and so forth, covers\nretaliation. And when you use the same language based\non age it also would cover retaliation.\nMR. GUERRA: Absolutely, Justice Stevens.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It's just as simple as\nthose two provisions being exactly --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It isn't that simple\nbecause the government hasn't conceded that, with\nrespect to Title VII, Federal employees are covered for\nretaliation. If the Government -- we'll ask them --\nwill make that concession, then the argument is very\nstrong. The words are identical.\nMR. GUERRA: Justice Ginsburg, even if, as I\nanticipate, they will not make that concession, the fact\nof the matter is that the remedial structure of Title\nVII, the Federal sector provision, confirms that the\nsubstantive ban that Justice Stevens read necessarily\ncovers retaliation. Otherwise, Congress wouldn't have\nmade a retaliation remedy available.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, another reason\nit's not that simple is that under the Age\nDiscrimination Act you have a private remedy that\nspecifically provides for retaliation. And that is\nnoticeably absent from the Federal remedy. And I\nthought that was the strongest argument on the\ngovernment's side.\nMR. GUERRA: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, that\nis precisely the same -- the same is precisely true of\nTitle VII. Section 704a of Title VII is the analog to\n623(b) in our case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought there was\na more express incorporation in Title VII of the private\nanti-retaliation remedy, and you don't have that in this\ncase.\nMR. GUERRA: That is true, but our position\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that makes it not\nprecisely the same situation.\nMR. GUERRA: Not precisely the same,\nMr. Chief Justice, but this Court's -- in that case, for\nexample, this court said when you copy language verbatim\ninto another statute, there must be some compelling\nevidence that you've intended to have given it a\ndifferent meaning.\nIf you look at the remedy section of Section\n633a(c), all you see there is not some dramatic\ndifference, but what Congress did was it replicated the\ncivil action provisions of the private sector in the\nFederal sector provision. So it's not as though there's\nsome stark evidence that Congress intended to have a\ndrastically different regime. It simply didn't --\nrather than incorporate subsection (c) of the private\nsection, 626c, it simply replicated it.\nI would like to reserve the balance of my\ntime.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Garre.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. GARRE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThe Age Discrimination and Employment Act\ndoes not expressly prohibit retaliation in the Federal\nsector context and it should not be read to impliedly\nprohibits such conduct either.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why not, given the\nJackson precedent, where there was a similarly general\nban on discrimination and we defined discrimination to\ninclude retaliation for complaining about\ndiscrimination?\nMR. GARRE: Justice Ginsburg, the Court did\nso very, very focused on Title IX, the Court's cases\ninterpreting the language of discrimination in Title IX\nbroadly. And it specifically distinguished statutes\nlike Title VII and the Age Discrimination Act which\ndelineate different types of discrimination.\nIn fact, on page 175 of the Court's decision\nin Jackson, the Court said because Congress did not list\nany specific discriminatory practices when it wrote\nTitle IX, its failure to mention one such practice does\nnot tell us anything. And then it pointed to the fact\nthat Title VII had delineated certain types of\npractices.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Would it be -- would it be\nunkind to say that the government's position seems to be\nthat a general ban on discrimination includes a ban on\nretaliation except when the government is being sued?\nIn Jackson the government argued that discrimination on\nthe basis of sex included retaliation. Tomorrow the\ngovernment is going to argue that the prohibition of\ndiscrimination in section 1981 includes retaliation.\nAnd yet here you're arguing exactly, what seems to me\nexactly the opposite position.\nMR. GARRE: I think that would be unfair,\nJustice Alito. The government's position is that\nstatutory context matters. It made that clear in\nfootnote 1 of its Jackson brief before this Court. It's\nmade it clear in this case.\nIn this case, there are several indicia of\nstatutory intent that are lacking where you have a\ngeneral prohibition in the context of the inferred right\nthat has -- that this Court has treated differently, as\nit did in Jackson and as it should in the did in the\nCBOCS case that you'll hear about tomorrow.\nIn the Age Discrimination Act you have\nseparate provisions of the Act which explicitly\ndelineate different types of discrimination, including\nretaliatory discrimination, and in the Federal sector\nprohibition the Congress added in 1974, it added that at\na time where it decided to treat State employers like\nFederal employers, specifically put the State employers\nin the definition of employer for the Federal -- for the\nprivate sector provision of the Age Discrimination Act,\nand it created a stand-alone provision for Federal\nemployers.\nAnd then it went even further. It\nspecifically said in subsection (f) of section 633a, the\nFederal sector provision, that the Federal sector\nprovision should be unaffected by the private sector\nprovision, the bootstrap to make clear that courts\nshould not be reading into the Federal sector provision\nthe additional protections or other provisions in the\nprivate sector provisions. And this Court recognized\nthe significance of that construction, that statutory\nscheme in the Lehman v. Nakshian case.\nIn that case, the Court considered whether\nFederal employees were entitled to a right to a jury\ntrial in an action for discrimination under the Federal\nsector prohibition. Private sector employees were\nentitled to that. And so the plaintiffs in that case\nmade an argument very much similar to the argument made\nby Petitioners in this case: Well, the private sector\nprovisions covered a jury trial right; it would make no\nsense not to have a jury trial --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's -- Mr. Garre,\nthat's traditionally when you're suing the government,\nyou don't get a jury. And so that's on one side.\nHere, as I think you would recognize,\nretaliation claims go hand in hand with discrimination\nclaims. A person who is discriminated against will\nquite commonly say: I was not promoted because that was\ndiscrimination and then because I complained about it\nall these bad things happened to me. It's very common\nthat those two go together.\nAnd yet, without any indication that\nCongress meant to send a Federal employee off to one\nforum to argue discrimination and another forum to argue\nretaliation, without any hint that that's what Congress\nhad in mind, it would be rather strange.\nMR. GARRE: Well, let me try to answer that\nquestion, Justice Ginsburg, but I just want to make one\nfinal point on Lehman and the statutory construction in\nthat case. The Court specifically said on page 162 of\nits decision that because Congress demonstrated that it\nknew how to provide a statutory right to a jury trial\nwhen it wished to do so elsewhere in the very\nlegislation cited, but in section 633a it explicitly\nfailed to do so, and it said that that was the\nconclusive point of statutory construction in that case.\nSo we do think the Lehman case is very on point here.\nWith respect to the general notion that it's\nuncommon to provide -- not to provide an\nanti-retaliation right when you do have an underlying\nanti-discrimination prohibition, certainly we would\nagree with you that it is uncommon, but we don't think\nthat it is absurd. It's certainly not absurd where\nCongress was aware that there was a separate set of\nprotections available for Federal workers --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you -- I recognize\nit's not absurd. But if there is ambiguity and one\ninterpretation is, well, that in every other context\nretaliation goes together with discrimination, why would\nCongress leave out this one category of persons,\nespecially when it might have said, well, the Supreme\nCourt says discrimination includes retaliation?\nMR. GARRE: Well, we know that Congress in\nthe Civil Service Reform Act, as the Chief Justice\nnoted, we know that it didn't think that additional\nanti-retaliation protections were necessary for some\nFederal employees. So the fact that Congress wouldn't\nhave a separate anti-retaliation -- anti-retaliation\nright in some situation in itself is not unprecedented.\nWe do think that the statute has several\nindicia that make clear that Congress did not intend to\nprovide an anti-retaliation right here. Not only the\ncontrast between the private sector and Federal sector\nprovisions, but look at what Congress expressed in\nsection 633a. In at least three respects this is\nmaterially unlike the typical anti-retaliation right.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Can you say what the\ngovernment's position is on Title VII, whether there is\na retaliation remedy against the Federal Government?\nMR. GARRE: As we make clear in our brief,\nwe have not conceded that, Justice Alito. We don't\nthink it's necessary for the courts to decide that in\nthis case --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What is the government's\nposition? What does, for example, EEOC or whoever\npasses on these complaints, what is the government's\nposition in practice with respect to a Federal employee\nwho complains, A, I was discriminated against because of\nmy race and then they retaliated against me for\ncomplaining?\nMR. GARRE: I think in practice, Your Honor,\nwe have not challenged the interpretation of the Federal\ncourts that have found that Title VII does incorporate\nan anti-retaliation right. But there are at least --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Has any Federal court\nfound otherwise?\nMR. GARRE: I'm not aware of a circuit court\nthat has gone the other way on Title VII. Certainly the\nAge Discrimination Act is different. The First Circuit\nin this case explicitly recognized that the textual\ndifferences between Title VII and the Age Act call for a\ndifferent result. And there are at least two\ndifferences that we do think call for a different result\nunder the Age Act.\nThe first is the fact that, whereas Title\nVII expressly incorporates the private sector provisions\nof the Act and by reference the anti-retaliation\nprovision of the Act --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So you agree -- then you\nagree with Mr. Garre about the meaning of those words\n\"as applicable\"?\nMR. GARRE: Well, this Court actually has\ninterpreted that phrase, \"as applicable,\" in a case\ncalled Chandler v. Radabush. It wasn't cited in the\nbrief, but it is directly responsive to that question.\nAnd the cite there is 425 U.S. 840. And in that case\nthe Court said that the \"as applicable\" language just\nmeans that there are certain provisions of the private\nsector remedies that are inherently incompatible in the\nFederal sector context. And it pointed to the\nprovisions in the private sector part of Title VII that\nallowed EEOC or the attorney general to intervene in the\nprivate action and take over the suit.\nSo the \"as applicable\" doesn't undermine the\nexpress incorporation of private sector remedies and\nanti-retaliation. And that's a critical difference\nbetween Title VII and the Age Act. The Age Act not only\ndoes not include that express incorporation, it goes in\njust the opposite direction, and Congress went out of\nits way to say don't import the private sector\nprovisions -- it did that in section 633a(f) -- don't\nincorporate those provisions, and that's what this Court\nrecognized.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do we know what Congress\nhad in mind when it said don't incorporate private\nsector?\nMR. GARRE: Well, this Court in the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There must be an\nexplanation for that section.\nMR. GARRE: I don't think there is any\nlegislative history on point. The Petitioners argue\nthat it meant don't incorporate the more restrictive\nfeatures. But that argument is directly contradicted by\nthis Court's decision in Lehman, where it pointed to\nsection, subsection (f) of that provision as a reason to\nnot import in the jury trial right that was not\nrecognized for private sector employees.\nThe other way --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you agree with\nyour friend that this employee has no remedy under the\nCivil Service Reform Act?\nMR. GARRE: Yes. She is a\nnonpreference-eligible employee of the Postal Service.\nThat means that she has to pursue her remedies under the\ncollective bargaining arrangement, which gives her a\nremedy to complain about reprisal. And it means that\nthe union representative would present that grievance on\nher behalf. But it also means that if for some reason\nshe felt that her right of -- her obligation of fair\nrepresentation was not carried through, she could go to\ncourt and complain about that.\nThis Court in a case called Bowen v. United\nStates Postal Service recognized that employees who\ndon't get fair representation can go into court and\ncomplain about that. So she is protected --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What could she get --\nwhat could she get by way of remedy? And you recognize\nthat this employee is not covered by the Civil Service\nAct, but does have collective bargaining rights.\nSuppose there is a finding of reprisal in that forum.\nMR. GARRE: I believe the remedies are\nlargely co-extensive in that the principal remedy that\nyou would get under the Age Act, under the Civil Service\nReform Act and I believe under the collective bargaining\nagreements, although I frankly am not certain about\nthat --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about --\nMR. GARRE -- is corrective -- is corrective\naction, Justice Ginsburg. There is no right -- unlike\nTitle VII, there is no right to compensatory damages\nunder the Age Act for things like pain and suffering or\nemotional distress; and so in that respect the Age Act\nis quite different. What you typically get -- you get\nthis under the Civil Service Reform Act and under the\nAge Act for discrimination claims -- is back pay, front\npay and corrective action to -- to address the\ndiscrimination.\nThe other way in which the Age Act, section\n663a, is different than Title VII -- and this is\nactually another thing that makes it inherently\nincompatible with an anti-retaliation right -- is that\nthe prohibition in section 663a, the Federal sector\nprovision of the Age Act, is limited to employees who\nfit within the protected class, employees over the age\nof 40.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why is that? I\nmean, if you have the private -- the private sector\nremedy is not so limited, right?\nMR. GARRE: Right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if we imply or\nincorporate into the Federal anti-discrimination remedy\nan anti-retaliation provision, I assume it would be in\nthe same scope as the private anti -- the private\nanti-retaliation provision.\nMR. GARRE: Well, then this Court would be\ndirectly disregarding the express intent in section\n663a, where it says affecting employees or applicants of\nemployees -- for employment who are at least 40 years of\nage. And further, in section 633 --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, Mr. Garre isn't the\nmost that argument gets you that the only individuals\nwho could complain against retaliation are those over\n40? It doesn't get you out -- it doesn't get you where\nyou want to go. It's not retaliation right at all.\nMR. GARRE: I think that's right, but if\nwe're going to talk about anomalies then we have to\nrecognize that that is an anomalous grant of retaliation\nprotection right that only protects people within the\nprotected class with respect to discrimination.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, is it any more\nanomalous than the fact that the only protection of the\nage protection is simply for people over 40? In other\nwords, Congress didn't care whether there are employers\nin the world who don't like youthful people.\nMR. GARRE: If --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: They're just worried about\nthe age. So if it's an anomaly it's an anomaly across\nthe board in the statute.\nMR. GARRE: I think it's a great deal more\nanomalous, with respect, Justice Souter. With both\nanti-retaliation provisions, whistleblower provisions,\nall the provisions that the government is aware of,\nincluding all the ones cited in Petitioners in its\nbrief, protect all employees, all --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But the same anomaly\napplies to the private sector, because section 631a\napplies to the private sector and 631b to the public\nsector.\nMR. GARRE: Well, that's not the way the\ncourts have interpreted it, Justice --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The language is the same.\nThey both are limited to prohibitions to people who are\nover 40.\nMR. GARRE: What the courts have focused on\nis the \"any employee\" language of section 623d of the\nprivate sector provisions. And that's the way --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But that's no reason why\nthat trumps -- any more reason why that trumps 631a than\n631b.\nMR. GARRE: And that's the longstanding\ninterpretation of the EEOC and I don't think there's\nbeen any doubt in the courts to date that under the\nprivate sector provision you can bring claims for\nretaliation if you're an employee, and of course that's\nthe way it is under Title VII.\nWe do think that it would be anomalous to\nsay that employees who complain about age discrimination\nor who testify about age discrimination in a case are\nnot entitled to protection if there is an\nanti-retaliation right, and if they are under the age of\n40; and there is at least two other respects in which --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I don't think it says that\n-- the protection doesn't apply. The word is\nprohibition -- but that --\nMR. GARRE: Well, I think that that's right.\nBut it's odd to say that this prohibition in 663a, which\nis clearly limited to people -- and I think by --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That's the explanation why\nthe problem doesn't arise in the private sector. The\nsame explanation would apply to the public sector, if\nyou choose the word prohibition as talking about these\npeople who are protected by the --\nMR. GARRE: That's not -- that's not the way\nthe courts have interpreted for more than 20 years under\nthe statute.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I though we are talking\nhere a prohibition against taking retaliatory action.\nIsn't that a prohibition?\nMR. GARRE: It is a prohibition.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. GARRE: Right, and then that would be --\ntheir argument is that 663a contains that prohibition,\nand so therefore it is limited by 631b.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't this an\nunusual retaliation case in that the person allegedly\nretaliated against also has substantive\nanti-discrimination claims? And I gather -- I think it\nwould take a particularly incompetent lawyer that\ncouldn't phrase retaliation in those cases as underlying\ndiscrimination.\nMR. GARRE: I wouldn't disagree with that,\nMr. Chief Justice. I'm not sure it's unusual to have\nretaliation claims piggyback on discrimination claims,\nbut I think you're right.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Isn't it quite the contrary,\nMr. Garre, that most -- if you did a statistical\nanalysis of all the cases in which there was a\nretaliation claim, you doubt that you would find that a\nvery high percentage of those are cases in which the\nperson claiming retaliation is also the person who\nclaimed the underlying discrimination?\nMR. GARRE: I wouldn't doubt that. I think\nin most cases you do have discrimination claims. I\nwould say, though, that our research indicated that in\nthe Age Discrimination Act context, at least the private\nsector context, only 14 percent of the claims involve --\ncases involve retaliation claims, which is lower than\nother statutes.\nI wanted to point out two respects --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are those, are those\nmostly witness cases?\nMR. GARRE: I don't know.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In other words, it's\na witness saying I think so and so was fired because of\nhis age.\nMR. GARRE: I don't know the answer to that\nquestion.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't the typical\nretaliations claim, though, like the one in this case,\nwhether it's under Title VII or the Age Discrimination\nAct? That is, I think I have a solid claim of\ndiscrimination, but maybe not. Nevertheless, once I\nfiled that complaint, this unit doesn't like people who\ncomplain about sex discrimination, age discrimination.\nTherefore, I was retaliated against.\nIn this case, isn't it the fact that the age\ndiscrimination claim, the claim of direct\ndiscrimination, was rejected and the question is but\nnonetheless, was there a retaliation claim?\nMR. GARRE: She abandoned that claim at the\nsummary judgment stage. That's my understanding,\nJustice Ginsburg, and of course we are here today\nbecause she is still pursuing her anti-retaliation\nclaim; and certainly if there is an anti-retaliation\nright, we've agreed that you could pursue that\nindependent of whether you complained about the\nunderlying discrimination, but we do think that in at\nleast three respects the prohibition in 663a is\nincompatible with an anti-retaliation right.\nOne, we think it is limited only to the\npeople within the protected class, people 40 years old.\nTwo, it's limited to personnel actions, which means if\nyou think about it in the context of this Court's\ndecision in the Burlington Northern case and the Oregon\ncase, it's limited to workplace-related things that\nhappened to you, and in Burlington Northern the Court\nspecifically said, in holding that Title VII's\nanti-retaliatory provision was broader than that, was\nthat it would defeat or at least limit the purpose of\nachieving the purpose of an anti-retaliation provision,\nto limit it workplace-related harm.\nAnd then third, of course, the\ndiscrimination that's expressed in section 633 is\ndiscrimination based on age, not discrimination based on\nconduct -- the conduct of complaining about or\nexercising your rights under Federal law. And that,\nthat --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That does bring up\nJustice Alito's point. I mean, tomorrow you're going to\nargue the exact opposite, right?\nMR. GARRE: With respect --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Or else that\ndistinction between conduct and status would require you\nto lose.\nMR. GARRE: I think if we have the conduct\nand status alone, then I think you're in the Jackson\nbox. But where you've got the three indicia that you\nhave here, which indicate that this provision is\nincompatible with the typical anti-retaliatory\nprovision, and you couple that with other indicia of\nstatutory intent -- you have the competing schemes in\nthe statute between private sector where Congress\nspecifically delineated an anti-retaliation right, with\nthe fact that it didn't delineate that right in the\nFederal sector scheme; the evolution of the statute --\nwhere you have Congress specifically deciding not to put\nin Federal employers with private employers, as it did\nfor States having the separate provision; and the\ndistinctions between 663a and 623 of the Act -- 623 of\nthe Act is the main private sector prohibition; 663a,\nthe Federal sector provision, doesn't have all the other\ntypes of practices that are prohibited by 623.\nFor example, pensions -- pensions are\nspecifically addressed by 623. Congress didn't address\nthat in 663a of this Act. It presumably understood that\nit either would address it through other means if there\nwere other protections out there.\nSimilarly we think with respect to\nretaliation. Congress knew how to express an\nanti-retaliation right. It did so forcibly in the\nprivate sector provisions of the Act; and that language\nwhich you find in 623d of the Act is simply completely\nabsent in 663a of the Act.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do you think it's plausible\nthat Congress intended to treat the issue of retaliation\nin the Federal sector differently under the various\nFederal anti-discrimination statutes?\nMR. GARRE: I do think that, Justice Alito.\nThere certainly are several differences between Title\nVII and the Age Act, and I'm not sure that Congress has\nexplained each difference, but nevertheless they exist\nand this Court has recognized them, most recently in the\nSmith v. City of Jackson case, where the Court noted\nthat because of textual differences between acts, there\nis less protection with disparate impacts of\ndiscrimination under the Age Act and Title VII.\nIt's also the case that Congress has\nprovided for compensatory damages in Title VII and not\nin the Age Act. It's also the case that there is a\nright, a Federal right to a jury trial in Federal sector\nactions in Title VII but not in the age act. And this\nCourt has recognized, in Smith v. City of Jackson, that\nCongress has treated age discrimination as if it's\nqualitatively different and presumably accorded\ndifferent protections taking that into account.\nSo, the notion that this -- that the Age Act\nis different than Title VII or different than other\nFederal statutes in itself with respect to retaliation\nin itself is not unusual, and it's especially not\nunusual when you take into account that there is this\nback-stop protection that's --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Garre, can I go back\nto the authority you're pointing out for a moment? Is\nit your reading of 631a, the private sector section,\nthat says \"the prohibitions in this chapter shall be\nlimited to individuals who are at least 40 years of\nage,\" that it's correctly read as the prohibitions in\nthis chapter, except those contained in 623a, shall be\nlimited? That's the way you read it?\nMR. GARRE: Well, we -- no, Justice Stevens.\nI think that the textual argument that the courts have\nembraced with respect to 623d, the anti-retaliation\nprovision, is because in 623d the Congress specifically\nsaid \"with respect to any employees or applicants.\" It\ncouldn't have meant with respect to only 40, only\nemployees who are over 40. And, again, that's the way\nit's been interpreted consistently for decades under the\nstatute. And we think, though, that giving effect to\nthe language in 633a, you have express prohibition\nlimited to people over 40 years old, and that it is\nanomaly, and we're not aware of any other situation that\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But the effect of giving\nthe effect to the word \"any\" in this section is in\neffect to read in this exception.\nMR. GARRE: I think --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do you --\nMR.GARRE: I think --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That's the practical\neffect?\nMR. GARRE: I think that is the practical\neffect. This Court has recognized, in Bush -- in the\nBush v. Lucas case, which dealt with the question of\nwhether to infer a retaliation remedy for constitutional\nclaims by a Federal employee -- that Federal employment\npractices present different questions. It's an area in\nwhich this Court uniquely defers to the policy judgments\nof Congress, recognizing that Congress has greater\nresources to police Federal employment, that there are a\nnumber of balances that have to be struck between\ngovernment efficiency and the rights of Federal\nemployees.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Am I right now in thinking,\njust as a matter of practice, where there is\nretaliation, a claim of retaliation in respect to race\ndiscrimination, Federal Government, that the person\nmaking that claim can go to the EEOC and then to court?\nThat's right?\nMR. GARRE: That's true --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The same thing in respect\nto age, they can't, and what they have to do is they go\nthrough the civil service system or the collective\nbargaining agreement; is that right?\nMR. GARRE: Well, what would happen, if you\nhad an employee alleging discrimination on the basis of\nage and retaliation, that would be a so-called mixed\ncomplaint. They could bring that to the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, not what they do if\ntheir claim is a retaliation claim.\nMR. GARRE: If it's purely --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. GARRE: -- a retaliation claim, they'd\nhave to bring it under the protections afforded by the\nCivil Service Reform Act.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. And now, do you have\n-- two things: A, do you have any evidence one way or\nthe other that one of these two systems -- the civil\nservice plus collective bargaining, on the other hand;\nor EEOC plus the court, on the other -- works better,\nworks the same, works worse?\nMR. GARRE: I don't have any evidence.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. So we don't know.\nMR. GARRE: I wasn't --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Now what reason --\nokay. So we don't know.\nMR. GARRE: Well, I guess, if I could just\nadd though, I don't think there's any reason to doubt\nthat certainly Congress had any concerns about whether\nthe system under the Civil Service Reform Act is working\nproperly.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But that's drawing\nsomething from where you don't know. Okay. So that's\nfair enough.\nBut is there any -- what is the best reason,\nin your opinion, that Congress would have wanted to make\nthis distinction? What are the best two or three\nreasons? If you were just starting with a blank slate,\nwhy would Congress have wanted to send the one to the\none route and the other to the other route.\nMR. GARRE: My assumption is that Congress\nfelt that the back-stop protections that were available\nfor Federal workers at the time it passed the Age\nDiscrimination Act and that were subsequently codified\nby Congress in the Civil Service Reform Act were\nappropriate for people who complained about age. As I\nmentioned earlier --\nJUSTICE BREYER: For the people who\ncomplained about race.\nMR. GARRE: I don't know the -- Congress\ndidn't tell us the answer to that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But I'm asking you, and if\nyou were sitting there writing it, my -- my thought --\nthe conclusion that I would reach from what you're\nsaying is you can't think of any reason why you'd treat\nthem differently.\nMR. GARRE: Well, I think the reason would\nbe that Congress viewed age discrimination as materially\ndifferent than other types of discrimination, and it --\neither it felt that the risk of retaliation wasn't as\ngreat or that the protections -- that it didn't need to\nadd protections. And as I mentioned --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But why would it have\nthought that? In other words, if -- I can understand\nwhy you say -- if you're going to put a rational gloss\non it, that must be what they were thinking, but why\nwould they think such a thing?\nMR. GARRE: Your Honor, again, Congress\ndidn't say -- I'm not -- I think you can make the same\nargument with respect to why it gave Federal employees a\njury trial right under Title VII but not under the Age\nAct, why it gave Federal employees compensatory damages\nunder Title VII but not under the Age Act.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Garre, I just want to\nmake sure I understood something you said before, rather\npleadingly. One is if one could imagine a claim just\nfor reprisal, but you called something a \"mixed claim\"\nif you're suing, as she started out to sue, for both.\nSo if you're suing for both, on your theory you still\nmust split them up? You cannot bring the reprisal claim\ntogether with the discrimination claim?\nMR. GARRE: Well, you can bring them\ntogether. What you would do is you would bring a\ndiscrimination claim under the Age Act and you'd bring a\nreprisal claim under the Civil Service Reform Act.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there's a different\nadministrative mechanism.\nMR. GARRE: You can bring them both together\nbefore the Merit Systems Protection Board, if you're --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Oh, oh, but how about\ncourt?\nMR. GARRE: Well, in -- what would happen\nthere is you would have your proceeding in the Merit\nSystems Protection Board, which would decide the\ndiscrimination claim and the retaliation claim. At that\npoint, the employee could decide to go to the EEOC to\ntry to fight on discrimination, or the employee could go\nto Federal court, and in Federal court he would get a de\nnovo trial on his -- on his discrimination claim and a\nrecord review --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But then you -- you would\nbe putting everything under the civil service umbrella\nand nothing under the --\nMR. GARRE: No, I don't think so. And it's\na clear difference. There are several types of mixed\nclaims that can be brought in this fashion. Once you\nget to Federal court on your Age Act discrimination\nclaim, you get a trial de novo on that claim. You just\nonly get record review of the Civil Service Reform Act\nclaim because that's what Congress deemed appropriate.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But if it didn't amount\nto an adverse action under the Civil Service Act --\nMR. GARRE: If it doesn't amount to an\nadverse action, then you have to go the route that\nCongress thought appropriate for --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And you wouldn't get to\ncourt.\nMR. GARRE: Well, you would have -- you\nwould -- it would be investigated by the Office of\nSpecial Counsel.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but it would not be\nwithin your control. It would not be up to the --\nMR. GARRE: It would not, and that's what\nCongress deemed appropriate for those types of actions.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But it seems to me,\nMr. Garre, that, following up on Justice Breyer's\nquestion of what's the reason for it, the most striking\nthing to me is that Congress used precisely the same\nlanguage in the two sections: \"All personnel actions\nshall be made free from any discrimination based on\nrace, color\" and so forth. That clearly includes\nretaliation. But \"all personnel actions shall be made\nfree from discrimination on account of age\" does not\ninclude retaliation seems to me rather anomalous.\nMR. GARRE: But there are at least two\nmaterial textual differences between Title VII and the\nADA -- and the Age Act. The first is that the Title --\nthe Title VII --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: In the key section\ndescribing the prohibition, the language is exactly the\nsame.\nMR. GARRE: Well, to understand the meaning\nof that section you have to understand the meaning of\nthe whole section itself including this express\nincorporation. And, secondly --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Garre, are we going to\nhave to decide the Title VII question in this case? We\ndon't even have the materials in front of us. They\nhaven't been put in the appendix to the briefs. And in\norder to decide this case, we're going to have to decide\na Title VII case that hasn't even been presented?\nMR. GARRE: The Court does not have to\ndecide the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I would\nhave thought the answer to Justice Breyer's question\nwould be: This is an unusual situation where you have\nthe employer writing the law about what the employees\ncan do, and Congress realized, perhaps unlike the\nsituation in Title VII, everybody over 40 would be\ncovered; and every time somebody over 40 was fired or\ndisciplined or didn't get a raise, they could claim that\nit was age discrimination; and Congress decided that\nthey as the employer didn't want to face that\ndisturbance, particularly since they have the Civil\nService Reform Act already.\nMR. GARRE: I think that that's right,\nMr. Chief Justice, and I think this Court recognized\nsimilar considerations in the Bush versus Lucas case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Wasn't there -- there was\nsomething that was said about this -- that doesn't apply\nto congressional employees or White House employees,\nthat they would have a claim of retaliation.\nMR. GARRE: Well -- and that's because\nCongress gave them one, and this is --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So why would Congress say\nwhen you -- when it's Congress that's doing the\nreprisal, we're going to give you a suit, but not if\nsome other --\nMR. GARRE: I think, at least with respect\nto congressional employees, I'm not sure that they would\nhave been protected by the Civil Service Reform Act\nprotections that existed for executive agency employees,\nbut -- but look at the statutes -- and we cite them at\npage 36 in the appendix and our brief -- in those two\nstatutes, Congress used the same substantive prohibition\nthat is in section 633(a): \"All personnel actions\naffecting these employees shall be made free from\ndiscrimination based on age.\" But they explicitly\nincluded a separate anti-retaliation provision, which,\nagain -- that's a subsequent statute, but that's --\nagain, that's another indication that Congress doesn't\nthink that this kind of general prohibition in section\n633(a) covers discrimination. When it wants to cover\nretaliation, it passes an express anti-retaliation\nprovision Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Garre.\nMr. Guerra, you have four minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH R. GUERRA\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. GUERRA: I'd like to make three points.\nFirst, I want to emphasize the practical reality that\nthere are thousands of employees who have no remedies\nunder any of the schemes we are talking about:\nEmployees of TVA, employees of the General Accounting\nOffice, these employees of the Transportation Security\nAdministration.\nThey have no collective bargaining remedies,\nno CSR remedy, and, according to the Government, no\nremedy under the ADEA.\nJustice Ginsburg, on Title VII, not only has\nthe Government failed to challenge the lower --\nconsistent lower court interpretations. The EEOC's\ninterpretation of this provision is that it bars\nretaliation in the Title VII sector -- Title VII bans.\nAnd so when you --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. Would you\nclarify your earlier statement: These people have no\nremedies just for retaliation? They do have remedies\nfor the age discrimination, but not for retaliation?\nMR. GUERRA: They have no remedies for\nretaliation under --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But they have remedies for\nage discrimination?\nMR. GUERRA: They do, Justice Scalia, but my\npoint is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nMR. GUERRA: Our argument is that it makes\nno sense to give some people remedies under one scheme\nand leave some -- congressional employees getting full\nremedial relief, people under the CSRA getting a limited\nremedial relief, others getting remedies under the\ncollective bargaining rights and thousands of others\nhave no remedies only with respect --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that because they\nmay not engage in collective bargaining, or because they\nhave chosen not to?\nMR. GUERRA: I believe they are not allowed\nto. The entities I mentioned, I believe, are not\nallowed to.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: To have a remedy.\nMR. GUERRA: Because they simply have none\nof the remedies the Government has put before --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Who -- who is such a\nperson?\nMR. GUERRA: An employee of the\nTransportation Security Administration.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why can't they -- why can't\nthey go to like the Merit System Protection Board?\nMR. GUERRA: They are excluded from the\nCivil Service Reform Act.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So they are outside the\nCivil Service, and they don't have unions?\nMR. GUERRA: They don't have bargaining\nrights.\nJUSTICE BREYER: They don't have a union?\nMR. GUERRA: Correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So they could be fired for\nanything.\nMR. GUERRA: Well, they have claims for\ndiscrimination if they suffer age discrimination\ndirectly, but if they complain about age discrimination\nand then get fired in retaliation, they have nothing.\nAnd -- and just --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose that's\nconsistent with whatever prohibition it is that\nprecludes them from engaging in collective bargaining.\nMR. GUERRA: But it's not consistent with\ntheir rights under Title VII, Mr. Chief Justice, because\nas the EEOC has -- an -- is entitled to deference, it\nhas said, for three decades.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think we do\nhave to decide the Title VII question if you are to\nprevail.\nMR. GUERRA: I do. Well, I don't know that\nyou necessarily do, but I certainly think it compels the\nconclusion I am advocating if you reach -- if you reach\nthe issue.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You should have given us\nthe statute to look at if that's the case.\nMR. GUERRA: I recognize that, Justice\nScalia, and I apologize.\nI would also like to note that there was a\nsuggestion that perhaps Congress didn't care as much\nabout age discrimination. That's refuted by the House\nreport that accompanied this very statute.\nIt's quoted at page 23 of the AARP brief\nwhere the Congress said age is as great an evil in our\nsociety as discrimination based on race and religion.\nWhether or not this Court agrees with that assessment as\nan objective matter, that's the view of the Congress\nthat adopted this statute.\nAnd, as Justice Stevens noted, they have --\nthey adopted the statute by incorporating the language\nfrom Title VII, the exact same language where Title\nVII's remedial scheme makes clear, and the EEOC's\nconsistent interpretation confirms, that that then\nprohibits retaliation for complaints of race or gender\ndiscrimination.\nBy incorporating that same language in the\nADEA's federal sector provision, Congress necessarily\ngave it the same scope; and, by doing so, eliminated the\nvarious anomalies, to put it mildly, that the\nGovernment's position leads to.\nIf the Court has no further questions --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you counsel.\n"
