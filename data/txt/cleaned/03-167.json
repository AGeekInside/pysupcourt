Carlos Dominguez\nBenitez.\nMr. Himmelfarb.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAN HIMMELFARB\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis Court has consistently held in both\nharmless error and plain error cases that an error affects\nsubstantial rights if it affected the outcome of the\ndistrict court proceeding. Applying that principle to a\nviolation of rule 11 at a guilty plea proceeding, 9 of the\n12 courts of appeals that hear criminal cases have\nconcluded that a rule 11 error affects substantial rights\nif it affected the defendant's decision to plead guilty,\nwhich means that the defendant would not have gone forward\nwith his plea if the error had not occurred. That\nstandard is correct.\nThe Ninth Circuit standard which the -\nQUESTION: May I just ask this one question?\nBecause I'm -- I'm not at all sure of the -- is it\nperfectly clear that the -- in terms -- effect of the\ndecision necessarily is equated to the fact he would not\nhave otherwise have pleaded guilty?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: In the context of a guilty\nplea, I think it is, Justice Stevens. That's the relevant\ndecision. This Court's cases have applied the harmless\nerror and plain error effect on substantial rights element\nin a variety of circumstances: at a detention hearing,\nduring the course of a grand jury proceeding, most\nfrequently a trial, of course, and also at sentencing.\nEach of those four circumstances, the Court made clear\nthat the relevant question was whether the effect of that\nparticular proceeding would have been the same -\nQUESTION: Well -\nMR. HIMMELFARB: -- if the error had not been\nmade.\nQUESTION: Except that we -- I mean, the -- the\nmeaning of that term varies. In -- in some contexts, we\nsay, well, it's -- it's enough if -- if confidence in -\nin that the result would have been the same has been\nshattered. In -- in the case at the other extreme with a\ncase -- we -- I think that is strongest for you, we --\nwe've said in the ineffective assistance of counsel\ncontext, yes, you've got to show that he wouldn't have\npleaded guilty or he's got to show that he wouldn't have\npleaded guilty otherwise. And -- and it seems to me that\nthe -- the issue here is, is this enough -- is the context\nhere enough like the context in ineffective assistance of\ncounsel to -- to put the heaviest burden on the\npetitioner, or is it -- are there -- are enough\ndistinctions so that maybe the burden shouldn't be quite\nthat heavy?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: We think the -- we think it's\ndirectly analogous to the ineffective assistance of\ncounsel context. In that context, you have a deficient\nperformance by the defendant's lawyer in connection with\nadvice about a guilty plea. And this Court's decision in\nHill v. Lockhart makes clear that the next step of the\nStrickland analysis, the prejudice analysis, is whether\nbut for that deficient performance, the defendant would\nnot have pleaded guilty and would have gone forward to\ntrial.\nQUESTION: All right. No. Your -- we -\nMR. HIMMELFARB: We think the same rule applies\nhere.\nQUESTION: Let me -- let me suggest at least a\nreason why maybe it isn't. I'd like your comment on it.\nIn -- in the ineffective assistance of counsel\ncontext, one reason for putting a high -- you know, the\nheaviest burden on the defendant is that it is so very\ndifficult to police effective assistance as you go along.\nThe judge watching the -- the plea hearing has no way of\nknowing what's going on or has gone on between the lawyer\nand -- and the client.\nHere, we're in a different position. There -\nthere are a couple of people in a position to -- to avoid\nthe kind of problem that we've got here. One obviously is\nthe Federal judge. If he had a checklist in front of him,\nsomething like this wouldn't have happened.\nThe second is counsel for the Government. The\ncounsel for the Government can get up in a case like this\nand say, Judge, you forgot something, and avoid this\nproblem.\nSo it may be that because there are easier ways\nto avoid this, the burden on the defendant shouldn't have\nto be so heavy. What do you say to that?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Well, this Court's decision\nmakes clear in Vonn that the defendant has a burden, of\ncourse, rejected the contention in that case that no\nmatter when -- regardless of the circumstances of when a\nrule 11 error occurs, the Government bears the burden of\nshowing that there was no effect on substantial rights.\nThe holding of Vonn is that the defendant bears the\nburden.\nThe only question in this case is what that\nstandard is, and we think again it's directly analogous to\nthe ineffective assistance of counsel context.\nQUESTION: Well, you don't think that the\nstandard for plain error that the Court spelled out in\nUnited States v. Olano provides the standard?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Justice O'Connor, that's\nexactly our position. Our position is that a\nstraightforward application of Olano --\nQUESTION: Well, if -- if that's so, Olano's\nfourth prong, if you will, is that the error -- asks\nwhether the error seriously affects the fairness,\nintegrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\nAnd I'm not sure that I understand, under your test, how\nthat fourth prong would be applied or if it's still part\nof the test.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: It certainly is, Justice\nO'Connor. We make two alternative arguments, one under\nthe third prong of the plain error rule, one under the\nfourth. Our primary submission is that in order to\nsatisfy the third requirement of the plain error rule --\nin other words, in order to show an effect on substantial\nrights -- that's right -- a defendant has to show that the\nerror affected his decision to plead guilty.\nOur alternative argument is that the Court -\neven if the Ninth Circuit standard is correct so that a\ndefendant would not have to show that the error affected\nhis decision to plead guilty in order to show an effect on\nsubstantial rights and he could therefore satisfy the\nthird requirement of the plain error rule, he can't\nsatisfy the fourth requirement unless he makes that\nshowing. And we think that conclusion follows from this\nCourt's decisions in Cotton and Johnson where the Court\nassumed, without deciding, that the failure to submit an\nelement of the offense to the grand jury or the petit jury\naffected substantial rights, but held that the defendant\ncould not satisfy the fourth requirement of the plain\nerror rule because the error had no effect on the outcome\nof the grand jury proceeding or of the trial. So we're\nmaking two alternative arguments here, one under the -\nQUESTION: May I ask you a question about the\npractical aspect of it? And you're asking the Court to\nchoose -- well, the plain error is what we're doing and\nhow high a burden the defendant would have to meet. But\nthis relates to a question Justice Souter asked.\nI was surprised, given that this was not a new\ndistrict judge, that she didn't have a litany that would\ncover all the rule 11 elements. And I was also surprised\nthat the Assistant U.S. Attorney didn't say at the end of\nthe colloquy, judge, you forgot to mention that this plea\ncan't be withdrawn.\nIs there a manual that judges follow? Are U.S.\n-- Assistant U.S. Attorneys instructed, when something is\nleft out of rule 11, to remind the judge?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Justice Ginsburg, my\nunderstanding is that there is a bench book available to\njudges, and obviously there are a great many district\njudges in the United States district courts and some are\ngoing to be more meticulous than others.\nAssistant U.S. Attorneys often or at least are\nsupposed to bring checklists with them to a guilty plea\nproceeding so that they can ensure that rule 11 is\nstrictly complied with. Of course, a prosecutor has no\nmore interest in litigating a rule 11 error on appeal than\nanybody else does. So it's very much in the prosecutor's\ninterest to try to ensure that there's strict compliance.\nVonn makes clear, though, that in the event that\none of the -- one of the advisements slips -- and there\nwas only one here that the district judge did not give --\nit's the defendant's burden to object and if he doesn't,\nhe's in a plain error posture on appeal, not a harmless\nerror posture.\nQUESTION: Mr. Himmelfarb, is it -- is it clear\nin this case that the defendant believed that he could\nwithdraw his plea? Do we know that?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: We don't. The record is silent\non that question.\nQUESTION: Do you think that -- that a defendant\nmaking a guilty plea would normally believe that he could\nwithdraw it when the Government has promised him nothing\nexcept that it would recommend to the judge a certain\nsentence?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Well, it depends, Justice\nScalia. In a case like this, we think a defendant would\nnot reasonably be under that impression because in this\ncase, this -- this defendant -- respondent was repeatedly\nadvised that the judge was not bound by the guilty plea\nand that he would face a 10-year mandatory minimum\nsentence if the parties' recommendation was not followed.\nQUESTION: If I was given all of that\ninformation, I -- I certainly wouldn't leap to the\nconclusion that, well, if the judge doesn't accept it, I\ncan withdraw the guilty plea. I don't know why he would\nnaturally believe that. I would think he would naturally\nbelieve the opposite.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: We agree, Justice Scalia, and\nthat's why we think -\nQUESTION: Wasn't -- wasn't that covered in -\nin the plea agreement itself which was translated into\nSpanish for him, specifically that he could not -- he\ncould not withdraw his plea if the judge did not accept\nthe plea?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: That -- that's exactly right,\nMr. Chief Justice.\nQUESTION: Your basic point is that this part of\nthe rule is pointless.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Not at all, Justice Stevens.\nQUESTION: Well, I guess that's Justice Scalia's\npoint.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: No. There may --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: I'm sorry.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: My point is that in a case like\nthis where a defendant is advised that the judge is not\nbound by the parties' agreement, it's probably not\nreasonable for that defendant to assume that he can\nwithdraw his plea if the judge doesn't follow the -\nQUESTION: My point is not that it's pointless.\nMy point is that when it is omitted, it does not\nnecessarily produce substantial injustice. It's a good\nidea to give it, of course. But in the absence of giving\nit, I would think that normally you'd think that he would\nassume that anyway.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: That's exactly right. That's\nour position, Justice Scalia.\nQUESTION: But if that's right and I were a\ndistrict judge, I could probably save time by just\nomitting this regularly then.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: No, Justice Stevens, I don't\nthink that's likely to happen. District judges are\ngenerally quite conscientious about complying with rule\n11. Prosecutors are generally quite conscientious about\nmaking sure that district judges comply with rule 11.\nNobody has an interest in having appellate litigation over\nrule 11 errors. Everyone has an interest -- everyone has\nan interest in making sure that rule 11 is strictly\ncomplied with so that the judgment of conviction can be\nentered and people can move on to other business. So I\ndon't think -\nQUESTION: Even -- even respondent doesn't argue\nhere that any omission from the rule 11 requirement\nproduces an automatic reversal. Does respondent argue\nthat?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: No. My -\nQUESTION: So, I mean, that's -- that's not the\ntheory here, that if you don't -- if you don't produce an\nautomatic reversal, people won't give the rule 11\nrequirements.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: That's right. The Ninth\nCircuit does not have a rule of automatic reversal. The\nNinth Circuit standard is if the error is not minor or\ntechnical and the defendant wasn't otherwise aware of the\nomitted information, he shows an effect on substantial\nrights.\nOur position is that knowledge of the omitted\ninformation is a sufficient condition to defeat a claim\nthat there was an effect on substantial rights, but it's\nnot necessary.\nQUESTION: Now, is your knowledge of requirement\na wholly subjective test? We -- we want to know what this\ndefendant thought. Or is it what a reasonable person\nwould have concluded based on all of the circumstances?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: It's a subjective standard,\nJustice Kennedy. In the context of a guilty plea, when\nthe question is whether the error affected the defendant's\ndecision to plead guilty, the relevant question is whether\nthis particular defendant would have pled -- would have\ngone to trial.\nQUESTION: So you put him on the stand. You put\nhim on the stand and -\nMR. HIMMELFARB: No, you don't. You can't\nbecause by definition in the plain error/harmless error\ncontext, you're limited to the record on appeal.\nObjective considerations are obviously relevant\nin making the subjective determination of whether this\nparticular defendant would have pled guilty.\nQUESTION: Well, you're limited to the record on\nappeal. Could there have been a hearing in the -- in the\ndistrict court on the rule 11 -\nMR. HIMMELFARB: There could, Justice Kennedy.\nFor example, if the defendant had moved to withdraw his\nplea after he pled but before sentencing, it might have\nbeen within the district court's discretion to hold a\nhearing and you could have had the defendant testify at\nthat hearing.\nQUESTION: But after sentence, it's impossible\nfor him to testify?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: That's right. Under -- under\nrule 11, a defendant can move to withdraw his plea for any\nreason before it's accepted.\nQUESTION: But he didn't do that. This question\nwasn't raised until appeal -- the appeal. He didn't\nsay -\nMR. HIMMELFARB: That's exactly right. It\nwasn't raised at any point in the district court, Justice\nGinsburg.\nQUESTION: But -- but my question is in -- in\nother cases it would not be possible to put him on the\nstand at any time after sentencing.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: No. After sentencing, the rule\nmakes clear a defendant can't move to withdraw his plea.\nThe only way he can attack his plea is by direct appeal or\na collateral attack. But before sentencing it's -\nQUESTION: On collateral attack, could he take\nthe stand?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Sure. It would be within the\ndiscretion of the district judge and his willingness to\ntestify.\nQUESTION: Under your -\nQUESTION: Can you -\nQUESTION: Excuse me.\nQUESTION: Can you collaterally attack a plea\nbefore 0 appealed and sought to have it set aside?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: No, Mr. Chief Justice. There's\n-- there's, of course, a requirement that you file a\ndirect appeal. Otherwise you will have procedurally\ndefaulted.\nI should also say that this Court held in\nTimmreck that a formal violation of rule 11, which is all\nthat we have here, is not cognizable in a 2255 proceeding.\nQUESTION: Normally -- you may know -- I'm just\ndrawing on your background. Normally when you say did it\naffect somebody's substantial rights, when I see those\nwords, I think the judge did something to this person.\nAnd when I say did it affect his substantial rights, I\nthink, well, did it matter in terms of what the judge or\nthe jury did to him. Now, is that a correct way to think\nabout it? Are there other instances where substantial\nrights means something different than that?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: In the ordinary context, the\nrelevant decision-maker is, of course, the judge, and\nthe -\nQUESTION: No, I'm not talking about -- I'm\nsaying something happened to this human being who is there\nin court, and when I say did this affect his substantial\nrights, I usually ask myself did this error make a\ndifference in terms of what happened to him. That's how I\n-- it's very colloquial, but that's the question I\nnormally ask myself. Now, maybe all these years I've been\ndoing it wrong or maybe there's some circumstances where I\nshould ask that question. You know, like a death case,\nwhich is a horrible case, sometimes there's harmless error\nand usually the question there is did it matter in terms\nof his being sentenced to death. Those come up a lot.\nI'm just asking you a general question. I don't\nhave a point here. I'm trying to figure out how best to\nthink about this.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: No. We think your formulation\nis exactly the right way to think -\nQUESTION: Fine. If that is the correct\nformulation, can you think of other instances in the\ncriminal law where substantial rights meant something\nother than this formulation?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: I can. The -- an affect on\nsubstantial rights means that there's an affect on the\noutcome.\nQUESTION: That's my question. I'm asking it to\ninform myself and I have the same question for the other\nside too.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Let -- let me qualify that -\nthat answer if I could, Justice Breyer. That is the\ngeneral rule. There are, of course, certain types of\nerror, as this Court has made clear, which do not require\na showing of -\nQUESTION: Like structural error. That's one\nkind of exception.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: That's exactly right.\nQUESTION: But I don't think we normally speak\nin terms of substantial rights in those cases. Maybe we\ndo. I don't know.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Well, sometimes the question\nwill be whether the third requirement of the plain error\nrule, which is a substantial rights requirement, has been\naffected.\nQUESTION: All right. So -- so structural error\ncases are an instance where my colloquial question is not\nright and nobody claims here this is a structural error\ncase.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: We certainly don't, Justice\nBreyer. I -- I don't believe respondent does, and the\ncourt of appeals did not take that position either.\nQUESTION: Mr. Himmelfarb, there's -- there's\nanother specific about this case that might have averted\nwhat happened. The -- the entire plea agreement was read\nto the defendant in translation because he didn't speak\nEnglish. And that was the day before. If it had been the\npractice to give him a copy of the translation, instead of\njust having him hear it orally, then it would have --\nmight better for him to read and we would have had more\nsecurity that he knew.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Justice Ginsburg, I don't know\nas an empirical matter which is more likely to ensure that\na defendant is aware of what's in the plea agreement,\nsitting down with a lawyer and a Spanish interpreter as\nhappened here and having the three of them go over the\nplea agreement, having the Spanish interpreter translate\nit for the defendant in the presence of counsel so that\nthe defendant can ask any questions of counsel that are\nnecessary and counsel can answer them, on the one hand, or\nthe suggestion which you just made.\nQUESTION: But I meant both, that is, that there\nwould be the written -- written-out plea agreement, which\nif he could read English, he could have read, and then the\nlawyer and the translator go over that written document\nwith him, that that I think would be more effective than\njust hearing it orally.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Again, I'm not sure whether\nthat's true as an empirical matter. As a legal matter,\nthe question here is when a defendant has forfeited a\nclaim of error and he has to show an effect on substantial\nrights on appeal, if you have -\nQUESTION: But I didn't mean this to be legally\ndispositive. It's in the same way -- how could this be\nwarded off so we don't get a Federal case out of these\nrule 11 slips.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Again, Justice Ginsburg, I -- I\ndon't think it's ordinarily the practice of U.S.\nAttorney's offices to provide Spanish translations of plea\nagreements to Spanish speakers who don't speak English.\nIt's always the practice, whether the translator is at -\ncomes at the defendant's expense or the court's expense,\nfor a translator to translate the plea agreement for the\ndefendant in -- in the presence of counsel. I -- I don't\nknow what would be the source of any requirement for the\nGovernment to provide a Spanish -\nQUESTION: I -- I wasn't suggesting that -- that\nit was a requirement.\nMay -- may I ask just one more puzzling thing\nabout this case, background of it? The reason that the\ndeal didn't -- wasn't possible was that this man had three\npriors instead of everybody thought -- well, at least the\njudge thought or the prosecutor thought, until the\npresentence report, there was only one. But the defendant\nmust have known how many priors he had.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: That's right. The defendant,\nof course, knew that he had three prior convictions and\nnot just one. I'm not sure what bearing that fact has on\nthe plain error analysis in this case because it's not\njust the fact of the prior convictions that would have\nrendered this defendant ineligible for a sentence below\nthe mandatory minimum. There has to be a guidelines\ncalculation and assignment of criminal history points to\neach conviction, and if you get above one criminal history\npoint, you're not eligible for a sentence below the\nmandatory minimum. So you would -\nQUESTION: Well, you might -- you might say that\nthe fact that the defendant must have known that he had\nthree priors would have made him realize that the plea\nagreement probably wouldn't be accepted.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: One could reasonably conclude\nthat he should have had substantial doubt about whether he\nwould have been eligible for the -\nQUESTION: Are you assuming he understood the\nsentencing guidelines in that detail?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: No. That's -\nQUESTION: It'd be rather unusual. The basic\nproblem here is we're dealing with dumb defendants.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: That's the problem. That's why you\nhave to tell them twice.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Well, that's true, Justice\nStevens.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Rule 11 imposes a requirement\non the district judge to advise the defendant of his\nrights. Nobody disputes that that didn't happen here for\none of the advisements and nobody disputes that there was\ntherefore rule 11 error. Nor does anybody dispute that it\nwas a plain error. But since defendant didn't object --\nrespondent didn't object in the district court, we're in a\nplain error posture. That is a difficult standard to\nmeet. He has to show not only that there's an error\nthat's plain, but he has to satisfy these two other\nrequirements that I'll mention.\nQUESTION: Why shouldn't it be as an objective\ntest, do you think? I don't know why you focus on -- on\nsomething else. I mean, can't we assess whether -- in\ndetermining whether it affects substantial rights, how the\nevidence against the defendant was, what the benefits of\nthe plea were, and what he was told in just objective\nterms?\nQUESTION: In other words, reasonable\nprobability.\nQUESTION: Yes. I mean, why do you want to make\nit something else?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Justice O'Connor, it is\nabsolutely the case that in undertaking this analysis, a\ncourt should and ordinarily will look at objective\nfactors. In most cases -\nQUESTION: I would think you would win under an\nobjective test. I don't know why you're trying to urge\nsomething else.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: We think that -- we agree that\nwe win under either an objective or a subjective standard,\ngiven the strength of the case against respondent and\ngiven the fact that he received a substantial benefit from\npleading. We think that a -- a subjective test is the\nappropriate one because this is not a situation like you\nhave when there's trial error and you have to determine\nwhether the jury objectively would have reached the same\ndecision -\nQUESTION: But -- but if you're doing a\nsubjective test, you might as -- as long as you're doing\nthat, why not accept the Ninth Circuit test: did he know?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Well, Justice Kennedy, we think\nthat if he did knew -- if he did know, that's a sufficient\nbasis for rejecting his claim because if he knew, the fact\nthat the judge didn't tell him a second time -\nQUESTION: No, no. I -- I thought that this was\nthe Ninth Circuit test that you disagree with. And my -\nmy point is if you're going to go this objective route,\nyou might as well ask the basic question as the Ninth\nCircuit did.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: We -- we have no problem with\nthe question the Ninth Circuit asked. Our problem is that\nthey stopped after they asked that question. That should\nprobably be the first question. If there's evidence in\nthe record that the defendant was otherwise aware of the\nomitted rule 11 information, it would be very difficult to\nsay that he would have gone to trial if the judge had\nomitted to say something that he already knew. That's why\nwe think that's a sufficient --\nQUESTION: I still would like to understand why\nyou think an objective test is not acceptable.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: In -- in the -- when a\ndefendant is confronted with a choice of pleading guilty\nor going to trial, he has -- he, of course, has an\nabsolute right to go to trial. No matter how strong the\nevidence is against him, no matter what benefits he could\nget from pleading guilty, if he chooses, for whatever\npersonal or idiosyncratic reason, to go to trial despite\nthose things, he's got the right to do it. That's why we\nthink -\nQUESTION: Maybe -- maybe you think the courts\nwould not -- would not stand by an objective test in the\nsituation where the facts are such that any intelligent\ndefendant would have -- would have made the plea even if\nhe knew that it couldn't be revoked. But this particular\ndefendant, for whatever reason -- and it's clear on the\nrecord he told his counsel or he left -- left a note and\nsaid, well, there's no harm in making this plea because I\ncan always withdraw it if the judge doesn't go along with\nthe recommended sentence. And in that situation, I think\nit's very hard for a court to say, oh, yes, a -- since a\nreasonable defendant would -- would have gone ahead\nanyway, this -- this defendant who would not have gone\nahead anyway must be held to his guilty plea.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: I think that's right.\nLet me -- let me just add this point to what\nI've already said. While the objective question of\nwhether a reasonable defendant in the defendant's\ncircumstances would have pleaded is not, we think, the\ncorrect analysis under the third component of the plain\nerror rule, we do think it could be taken into account in\nconnection with the fourth requirement, which is the\ndiscretionary component.\nSo, in other words, if you have a situation\nwhere a defendant for some idiosyncratic reason was intent\non going to trial, even though it was essentially suicidal\nfor him to do that, he might be able to satisfy the third\nrequirement because it affected his decision to plead\nguilty, but a court could permissibly say, that doesn't\nserious affect the fairness, integrity, and public\nreputation of judicial proceedings because he undoubtedly\nwould have been convicted if he had gone to trial and\nwould have gotten a longer sentence.\nI'd like to reserve the balance of my time for\nrebuttal.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Himmelfarb.\nMs. Mossman, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MYRA D. MOSSMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. MOSSMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI have three points to make.\nFirst, Olano created a framework that the lower\ncourts have been consistently applying -- applying in\nevaluating forfeited errors in a rule 11 context for 11\nyears.\nSecond, now having suffered an adverse ruling in\na fact-specific case, the Government is urging this Court\nto adopt a strict, heavy burden, bright line, but-for\nprejudice test in every case that eliminates the lower\ncourt's flexibility.\nThird, not only is the Government's test\nincorrect, but the Ninth Circuit cited and applied Olano\nand was consistent with Olano in Benitez.\nNow, first, the Olano standard is a national\nstandard under plain error review where an error affects\nthe substantial rights. And that means -- generally is\ntaken to mean it's prejudiced. And in most cases\nprejudice means that it affects the outcome of the\nproceedings. In Benitez, this is what the Ninth Circuit\nheld as well because in Benitez, if it's not minor or\ntechnical, that means it's prejudicial.\nQUESTION: Why?\nQUESTION: But that's not so.\nQUESTION: Has -- has --\nQUESTION: I mean -\nMS. MOSSMAN: Or consistently can be -\nQUESTION: I read the Ninth Circuit. It seemed\nto me we said just what you said we said. What the Ninth\nCircuit says is Benitez must prove that the error was not\nminor or technical, which by the way, has nothing to do\nwith it because a minor or technical error could well\naffect the outcome. And then it says, and that he did not\nunderstand the rights at issue, which again is a necessary\nbut not sufficient condition.\nNow, where did they say anything about\nsubstantial rights? They used those words, but if\nsubstantial rights means what I -- we just discussed,\nwhich I'd like your view about, they never talked about\nsubstantial rights.\nMS. MOSSMAN: They don't talk about\nsubstantial -\nQUESTION: Well, didn't they say just what I\nread?\nMS. MOSSMAN: Yes, but if -\nQUESTION: So why isn't it like summary reverse?\nWe said this. You say that.\nMS. MOSSMAN: Well, it's -- we -- we see that\nnot minor or technical means it has -- it affected his\nsubstantial rights, and they actually cite to Olano.\nQUESTION: Oh, I see. Now, then what does\naffect substantial rights mean? Now, we have an error\nhere that's not minor or technical.\nMS. MOSSMAN: Correct, and -\nQUESTION: Now he, in fact -- let's say second\n-- did not understand that he had a right to withdraw.\nMS. MOSSMAN: Correct.\nQUESTION: Now, is that the end of the thing?\nMS. MOSSMAN: No, they -- then -\nQUESTION: Ah, ah, where -- that's -- that's the\npoint. Where in this opinion does it say that's not the\nend of the matter?\nMS. MOSSMAN: Well, they do go to the fourth\nprong. They -\nQUESTION: No, no, not the fourth prong. Where\ndoes it say that's not the end of the matter under the\nthird prong?\nYou see, I could have a nontechnical matter.\nCorrect?\nMS. MOSSMAN: Correct.\nQUESTION: I could -- it could have affected my\nunderstanding, but it might be that I would have pled\nguilty anyway.\nMS. MOSSMAN: Well, I think -\nQUESTION: That's what's worrying me.\nMS. MOSSMAN: But -\nQUESTION: And the most obvious case is where\nthe judge gives me the sentence I hoped for.\nMS. MOSSMAN: That is the obvious case, Justice\nBreyer, and that was Chan and they cite to that in Benitez\nwhere they got exactly the sentence that they bargained\nfor. Therefore, the error is not minor or technical.\nQUESTION: Oh, I'm sorry. A terribly minor,\nterribly important error, terribly important. Indeed, the\njudge has a whooping cough fit and nothing comes out of\nhis mouth, but he gives them the sentence he asks for.\nOkay?\nMS. MOSSMAN: Yes.\nQUESTION: What about that?\nMS. MOSSMAN: Well, I think what's coupled here\nis that it has to be knowing. There has to be a\nknowingness and a voluntariness. And in that situation,\nif the -- if the defendant knew that he was possibly -\nthat the sentence that he bargained for was -\nQUESTION: No. The -- he knew nothing. The\ndefendant knew nothing. It was a major error. He just\ngot what he asked for.\nMS. MOSSMAN: We believe that is consistent. He\n-- he got what he -- if the sentence is less than he -- or\ngot the sentence that he bargained for, where is the\nerror?\nQUESTION: Of course.\nMS. MOSSMAN: But the --\nQUESTION: Of course. That's what's bothering\nme.\nMS. MOSSMAN: Because we're -\nQUESTION: If in fact the major error -- and he\ndid not understand it -- made no difference to the\noutcome, then, says the Government, he shouldn't be able\nto appeal it. And that's the problem. As I read the\nNinth Circuit, they didn't make that last statement.\nMS. MOSSMAN: So if the -\nQUESTION: And they want an -- do you agree with\nthem that they should have an opportunity to go back and\nto say, judge, we want this client also to be able to show\nit made no difference to the outcome? If you agree with\nthat, that's the end of the case I think.\nMS. MOSSMAN: Justice Breyer, if they -- if it's\na major rule 11 error, it would not be minor or technical.\nThe analysis would -- would address that fact.\nQUESTION: Well, how -- how do you know, just\nfrom reading rule 11, which errors are minor and technical\nand which aren't?\nMS. MOSSMAN: We don't believe all errors in\nrule 11 -\nQUESTION: How do you -- how do you -- what's\nyour standard for telling the difference?\nMS. MOSSMAN: Well, we think -- Congress has\nenacted this and the full panoply of errors -\nQUESTION: Panoply.\nMS. MOSSMAN: -- of rule 11 advisements are\nimportant, and none them can be considered minor or\ntechnical --\nQUESTION: So --\nMS. MOSSMAN: -- in and of themselves.\nQUESTION: But just a moment ago, you said not\nevery rule 11 violation is necessarily not minor or\ntechnical. You say it's -- you -- I thought you intimated\nsome of the could be.\nMS. MOSSMAN: It's part of the analysis. I\nthink you have to complete the analysis.\nQUESTION: Well, but I'm trying to get you to\nanswer a rather specific question. How do you define\nminor or technical?\nMS. MOSSMAN: Well, I think that was brought out\nin actually the advisory committee notes. So, for\ninstance, if the -- if the judge failed to advise the\ndefendant that if he lies on the stand, he'd be subjected\nto perjury charges. That's considered not a minor or --\nthat's considered basically a minor or technical\nadvisement.\nAlso, if there was -- the judge failed to cite\nto an element of the offense, but the defendant\ndemonstrated that he specifically knew about that, that\nwould not be considered minor or technical.\nIf the judge misstates a -- the maximum\nsentence, but the defendant receives a sentence that's\nsubstantially lower, that was considered under the\nadvisory committee notes basically -\nQUESTION: Did the -- did the advisory committee\npurport to cover all possible minor or technical errors?\nMS. MOSSMAN: They were just giving -- it was\nillustrative I believe.\nQUESTION: Examples.\nMS. MOSSMAN: Yes.\nQUESTION: In -- in assessing how weighty this\nparticular lapse is, should we take into account that as\nfar as I know, this defendant has never said in the\ndistrict court or on appeal that he indeed wants to go to\ntrial.\nMS. MOSSMAN: It's our position that I wouldn't\nbe here if he didn't want his plea vacated.\nQUESTION: But he -- on -- on -- the plea\nvacated is one thing.\nMS. MOSSMAN: Well, we -\nQUESTION: Because then you have -- given that\nhe has three priors, his sentence -- he was sentenced at\nthe mandatory minimum. How much better could he do on a\nresentencing? So it's got to be he wants to go to a trial\nbecause do you agree that if we -- if we just say new\nsentencing, he couldn't do any better given -\nMS. MOSSMAN: Justice Ginsburg, it's our\nposition that this particular defendant at every single\nproceeding, he -- he expressed his dissatisfaction with\nhis counsel, and the respondent's second letter to the\ncourt, which is at the joint appendix, number 96, was\nexactly -- could be construed, because it was a pro se\nfiling, as a motion to withdraw. He asked for new counsel\nto look at his case anew.\nQUESTION: But that's not the question I asked\nyou. I asked did he ever say at any stage, judge, I'd\nlike to have a trial. I want to plead not guilty.\nMS. MOSSMAN: Justice Ginsburg, after the\nconference on the substitution of hearing, a sentencing\ndate was -- was set, and this particular defendant did not\nobject to the -- to a trial date -- excuse me -- a trial\ndate was set, and this particular defendant did not\nobject. His attorney made some comments about maybe it's\nnot necessary.\nQUESTION: It's not -- one thing not to object\nto a setting of a trial date, but did this man ever say I\nwant to exercise my right to trial by jury?\nMS. MOSSMAN: His first statement to the court\nat that substitution of -- of counsel hearing was at no\ntime have I decided to go to trial. But that's not\nconclusive. He needed more -\nQUESTION: I thought he was stronger than that.\nI thought -- thought he had said at one point I don't want\nto go to trial.\nMS. MOSSMAN: He never said that specifically or\ndefinitively. He said at no time have I decided not -\nQUESTION: But in any case, if he -- if -- but\nhis concern is that his substantial rights or -- have been\nviolated. And the possible effect on the outcome is\nrelevant. And my question is how could the outcome be\naffected if he got the mandatory minimum? He got the\nlowest sentence that the law allowed the judge to impose.\nSo unless he wants to go to trial, he isn't harmed by what\nhappened. And so I'm asking if there's any stage where he\nsaid, I want to go to trial.\nMS. MOSSMAN: This particular defendant made\nrequests of his attorney that were not brought to the\ncourt's attention. He acted pro se in -- in three\ninstances. We -- the record is actually void to know if\nhe -- and he was actually silenced when he wanted to ask\nthis -- the judge questions at his change of plea hearing.\nHe said I was asked -- I wanted to ask the judge questions\nand I was silenced. So the record is actually void\nspecifically to answer your question. We don't -\nQUESTION: What was -- what was the evidence in\nthe case? What was the evidence against him? What -\nwhat did the Government have?\nMS. MOSSMAN: Basically his own confession and\ntwo co-defendants. He was caught by -- basically the deal\nwent down through a confidential informant.\nQUESTION: Would -- would anybody in his right\nmind have wanted to go to trial?\nMS. MOSSMAN: In our opening brief -\nQUESTION: And risk getting more than the\nmandatory minimum?\nMS. MOSSMAN: In our opening brief, we\ncompletely briefed out the defense of entrapment, and this\nis brought out through the -- the language of this\ndefendant through the three letters that were submitted to\nthe court through his own pro se actions. We believe that\nhe had a possible defense of entrapment. I was not his\ntrial attorney. So -\nQUESTION: But you -- you have looked at the\ncases on entrapment.\nMS. MOSSMAN: Yes.\nQUESTION: And if you've got a predisposition,\nyou don't have much of a prayer on a entrapment claim.\nQUESTION: And he had three priors. Were -\nwere the three priors of the same -- same line of\ncommerce?\nMS. MOSSMAN: No, they were not. No, they -\nthey were not, Justice Scalia.\nQUESTION: If -- if you were to prevail and he\nwere to have a trial and be convicted, could he get a more\nlengthy sentence or would that raise problems of\nvindictive prosecution? Would failure to accept\nresponsibility be a ground for an increase?\nMS. MOSSMAN: I don't think that would be fair.\nHe has a fundamental right to go to trial.\nQUESTION: That's not --\nMS. MOSSMAN: Also, the -\nQUESTION: My question is can he get -- if he\ngets a new trial, can he get an increased sentence?\nMS. MOSSMAN: It's possible, but -- it's\npossible, Your -- Justice Kennedy.\nQUESTION: There's -- there's no vindictive\nprosecution problem?\nMS. MOSSMAN: There possibly is. I mean, I --\nhe would not get the acceptance of responsibility points,\nbut that -- but the acceptance of responsibility points\ndoesn't make the -- the bottom line here because of the\nmandatory minimum. So he still would be looking at a 10\nyear mandatory minimum, even if he went to trial, and\noften defendants that go to trial on these drug\nconvictions do get the mandatory minimum, irregardless if\nthey have gone to trial or -- and even irregardless if\nthey don't get the acceptance of responsibility points.\nQUESTION: Let me -- let me ask you this\nquestion. You argue for a subjective test in a context in\nwhich the defendant can't take the stand to say what his\nunderstanding was. That doesn't make a lot of sense to\nme.\nMS. MOSSMAN: Well, defendants plead guilty for\nall types of reasons. We don't know what's in the mind of\ndefendants.\nQUESTION: No, no. But you're saying that you\nwant a subjective test. You want -- you want to defend\nthe Ninth Circuit which said the question is whether or\nnot he knew that he had this specific burden, that he was\nwaiving the specific right the minute he entered the plea.\nAnd you want a -- a test to say that he didn't, in fact,\nknow that. And yet, we can't put him on the stand. That\n-- that seems to me an odd test.\nMS. MOSSMAN: Well -\nQUESTION: An odd -- an odd way to run the\nsystem.\nMS. MOSSMAN: I think it's important to see if\nthe -- this implicates the constitutional principles under\nthe Due Process Clause. It has to be a knowing and\nvoluntary plea. That is a subjective test. That's sort\nof built into the rule 11 -\nQUESTION: But the Ninth Circuit didn't follow\n-- didn't find that his plea was involuntary in a\nconstitutional sense.\nMS. MOSSMAN: Excuse me, Chief -- Mr. Chief\nJustice. They did under the fourth prong of Olano. They\n-- the actual citation would have been he did not\nunderstand the -- the consequences of his plea, which is\ntherefore not voluntary.\nQUESTION: Did -- did they say it was a\nconstitutionally invalid plea?\nMS. MOSSMAN: They cited to Graibe.\nQUESTION: Ms. Mossman, you've been asked\nquestions by several different members of the Court and\nyou don't seem to really respond to the questions. I'm\nasking you a very specific question now.\nMS. MOSSMAN: Yes, Your Honor. They cited to\nGraibe with cites to the Constitution.\nQUESTION: I'm rather confused because are -\nwhere -- there -- there are two kinds of questions we've\nbeen discussing. One is whether in fact, if he had been\ntold specifically, what he was supposed to be told, he\nwould then have withdrawn his guilty plea. That's\nquestion one. And most of what we've been talking about\nis that.\nBut I thought we're actually here to ask a\ndifferent question and the different question is I thought\nthe Ninth Circuit -- and I did think that from reading its\nopinion -- said what we've just been discussing has\nnothing to do with the matter.\nMS. MOSSMAN: Yes.\nQUESTION: All that -- all that the person has\nto show is that he didn't understand his rights. Now,\nwhat do you think about that question?\nMS. MOSSMAN: I think, Justice Breyer -\nQUESTION: So let's assume -- it's absolutely\nclear. They can come in with 52 bishops who are prepared\nto swear that if he had understood everything perfectly,\nhe nonetheless would have gone ahead and pled guilty. But\nit's also clear he did not understand his rights. Okay?\nMS. MOSSMAN: Yes.\nQUESTION: What's supposed to happen?\nMS. MOSSMAN: If he -- is he alleging a rule 11\nviolation?\nQUESTION: Oh, there -- look, what happened was\nthe judge never told him that you're stuck with your plea\nif I don't give you what you think you're going to get.\nHe never told him that. It's clear in rule 11 he was\nsupposed to. And now, in addition, we know for sure that\nthis person didn't understand that. But we also know for\nsure it made not one whit of difference to his plea.\nWhat's supposed to happen?\nMS. MOSSMAN: Justice Breyer, this is -- I\nbelieve you're talking about a motivated pleader, a\npleader that was --\nQUESTION: I'm talking what I think is about\nthis case.\nMS. MOSSMAN: This case.\nQUESTION: Yes. I think as it's presented in\nthe questions presented and in the opinion that was\nwritten by the Ninth Circuit. Now, I might be wrong and\nyou could explain to me why I'm not. But -- but in any\ncase, if you think that might be this case that's\npresented here, I -- in the Ninth Circuit opinion, I'd -\nI'd like an answer or your best answer.\nMS. MOSSMAN: I -- Justice, if I can answer your\nquestion, it's the -- a defendant that's caught in the\njustice -- a criminal justice labyrinth and he -- he\ndoesn't understand, he doesn't understand the language,\nhe's not confident in his counsel, and he believes he can\nwithdraw his plea. Is that correct?\nQUESTION: Yes. But in fact, we know he never\nwould have. We know it for sure.\nMS. MOSSMAN: But he -- he should -\nQUESTION: He's written secret letters to his\nrelations --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: -- and whatever. Do it in any sort\nyou want, but -- but I mean, that's -- that's a little bit\nof a technical matter here. But I did think in reading\nthe Ninth Circuit opinion and reading the Government's\nbrief, that that's what they're worried about, that there\ncould be cases where he does not understand the nature of\nthat rule 11 right, but nonetheless it makes no difference\nto his decision to plead guilty.\nSo that -- that's a bit of a technical point\nhere, I agree. But as I read the Ninth Circuit, I\nthought, well, that's what's going on in this case. Now,\nyou could explain to me, if you want, that I'm completely\nout to lunch, so to speak.\nMS. MOSSMAN: Well, Justice Breyer, if he was\nmotivated to plead guilty and there was an error in the\nrule 11 colloquy and he had the opportunity to replead, he\ncould replead to another type of plea agreement, a C plea\nagreement. He could ask for different provisions within\nthat -- that plea agreement, for instance, less supervised\nrelease. He could ask for a type C plea agreement.\nQUESTION: Why -- why would they give him a\nbetter deal the second time around? I mean, they'd say,\nyou know, okay, we forgot to tell you that you couldn't\nwithdraw it. We now tell you you can't withdraw it. And\nwe offer you the same deal we offered you last time. Why\n-- why would he get a better deal?\nMS. MOSSMAN: Well, he would -- if he's\nmotivated to plea -\nQUESTION: In fact, they might -- they might be\nmad at him for having backed out and -- and not give him\nas good a deal. But I can't imagine that he'd -- he'd get\na better deal the second time around.\nMS. MOSSMAN: Justice Scalia, I believe he would\nhave an opportunity to renegotiate or he could be\nrepleading to the -- and have confidence in the process.\nQUESTION: What leverage does he have? What\nleverage does he have when he's faced with a mandatory\nminimum that he can't escape from and that's what he's\ngot? I -- I can't -- could you describe for this\ndefendant what that better deal would be?\nMS. MOSSMAN: Justice Ginsburg, it possibly\ncould be less time on supervised release, less time -- or\n-- or actually a type C plea agreement instead of the type\nplea agreement. You're correct in saying they might not\noffer him that type, but 95 percent of criminal -- Federal\ncriminal convictions go by way of guilty pleas. So\nthey're going to offer him something.\nQUESTION: But how could -- could he escape from\nthe mandatory minimum in any way other than what they\nthought might work here, this so-called safety valve?\nMS. MOSSMAN: The mandatory minimum just becomes\nthe bottom line then.\nQUESTION: And that's what he got, and that's\nwhy I can't understand any better deal that this defendant\nmight have received.\nMS. MOSSMAN: Well, Justice Ginsburg, he could\nhave confidence in the plea proceeding if it was -- if he\nwas given the full panoply of his -\nQUESTION: You'd do it all over again with the\nsame bottom line, but he's going to feel better about it\nthe second time?\nMS. MOSSMAN: Possibly, yes. I mean, maybe that\nmeans something to this motivated pleader.\nQUESTION: Well, I'd like to ask you a question\nthat I asked Mr. Himmelfarb and that it seemed puzzling to\nme that the safety valve which everyone hoped would allow\na sentence below the mandatory minimum could never work\nfrom day one because he had two additional prior offenses.\nNow, if anyone knew about those priors, which were under a\ndifferent name, which is why they weren't found\nimmediately, certainly the defendant knew.\nMS. MOSSMAN: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, the\ndefendant knew, but it was confirmed on the record by the\ndistrict court judge that he actually fully disclosed to\nhis attorney his priors. This was brought out in the\nrecord at the sentencing hearing, and the judge confirmed\nthis. And so to talk about -\nQUESTION: So his -- his attorney knew that he\nwas disqualified for this plea?\nMS. MOSSMAN: This -- it was confirmed. The\ndefendant said I completely disclosed everything to my\nattorney. I -- I don't understand what's going on. The\npoints weren't explained to me. The safety valve wasn't\nexplained to me. This was brought out in the sentencing\ntranscript that -- that his priors were confirmed.\nQUESTION: That they were confirmed, but at\nwhat --\nMS. MOSSMAN: He exposed -\nQUESTION: -- at what point in time?\nMS. MOSSMAN: He exposed his prior convictions\nto his attorney. This is what brought this -- Mr. Benitez\nto confusion, and this was articulated in -- in the\nsentencing transcript.\nQUESTION: Which we don't have or do we have it?\nMS. MOSSMAN: Yes, you do. The sentencing\ntranscript is at joint appendix 104.\nQUESTION: And could -- could you point to that\nplace where it says that before he made this deal, which\ninvoked the safety valve, he had told his counsel that I\nhave three -\nMS. MOSSMAN: It's at -- Justice Ginsburg, it's\nat page 109. If I may read for the Court.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMS. MOSSMAN: The Defendant: I never felt that\nI had the proper representation, the way it should have\nbeen in my case.\nFrom the beginning, I never had any knowledge\nabout the points of responsibility, the safety valve, or\nanything like that. I honestly, from the beginning, I\naccepted through my -- responsibility through my attorney,\nbut he never paid any attention to me, what I had told him\nabout the problem that I had. I told him from the\nbeginning that I had a problem, that I was attending the\nprogram. And at the end, he told me that I -- allegedly\nthat I had never told him, that I had never notified him\nof it.\nI never hid anything in my case about the things\nthat I have done. Everything I said -- I have said --\neverything I said -- I have said has always been the truth\nand the reasons why I did it. And I have always asked for\nanother chance. I've always asked him for an opportunity\nto meet with the government and he never wanted me to do\nthat.\nQUESTION: I don't see where he said, I told my\nlawyer that I had three prior convictions.\nMS. MOSSMAN: He's trying to say, Justice\nGinsburg, that I never hid anything and then -- from my\nattorney about this case.\nAnd then the -- the judge goes on to question\nhim.\nQUESTION: Well, that's all right. I don't want\nto intrude on -- on your time.\nMS. MOSSMAN: It's -- I -- I think it's on page\n110.\nSo what you're -- the Court: So what you're\nindicating you believe everyone knew about your criminal\nhistory. Is that what you're saying?\nThe Defendant: Well, from the very beginning\nwhen he went -- when he came to see me, I explained it to\nhim.\nThe Court: I understand.\nSo what you're indicating to me is that you\nbelieve from the beginning you had disclosed that you had\na criminal record. Is that right?\nThe Defendant: Yes.\nSo he -\nQUESTION: And the trial judge told him, you\nknow, if you don't qualify, I might give you 10 years. Do\nyou understand that? And he says, yes.\nMS. MOSSMAN: Yes.\nQUESTION: And he says, knowing you have a\nmandatory minimum, I have to give you 10 years. Do you\nstill want to go forward with your plea? He says, yes.\nMS. MOSSMAN: Yes, correct, but this -\nQUESTION: So it's pretty hard to argue that -\nI mean -- go ahead.\nMS. MOSSMAN: Justice Breyer, but this defendant\n-- it's not clear that he did not know that he could not\nwithdraw his plea. He was under the impression, which is\ncommon sense impression, that he -- if -- if he doesn't\nget the sentence that he -- that he asked for, he could\nwithdraw his plea.\nQUESTION: Well, how -- how could he have had\nthat when the thing in the plea agreement itself was\nexplained to him in Spanish saying that he couldn't?\nMS. MOSSMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, our contention\nis that the -- the fact that the plea agreement wasn't in\nSpanish is fatal here because his attorney couldn't speak\nSpanish.\nQUESTION: Well, but there was an interpreter\nthere.\nMS. MOSSMAN: But his -- his attorney didn't -\nif his attorney couldn't speak Spanish, he doesn't know\nexactly what the interpreter is saying.\nQUESTION: Well, the interpreter can presumably\nspeak English.\nMS. MOSSMAN: The -- well, there was a\ncontention here between the defendant and his counsel in\nnumerous instances before the court. He expressed to the\ncourt that he couldn't communicate with his attorney and\nthe prosecution knew about this. They also characterized\nthe case as -- under paralysis, and yet they still gave\nthis defendant -\nQUESTION: This is new to me. I -- I didn't see\nany -- any indication in your briefs or in the record that\nhe claims he was never told by the interpreter. I thought\nit was -- I thought it was common ground that the\ninterpreter had correctly explained the written plea\nagreement to him. You're now saying that he contends that\nhe was deceived as to the meaning of the plea agreement?\nMS. MOSSMAN: No, Justice Scalia, we're not\ncontending that, but we agree with the Ninth Circuit that\nthe plea agreement in and of itself in -- in this case is\nnot conclusive of understanding.\nQUESTION: Because? Because? Because the plea\nagreement was read to him in Spanish. Is that right?\nMS. MOSSMAN: That's part of it, Justice Breyer,\nyes.\nQUESTION: That is right.\nMS. MOSSMAN: Yes, but also -\nQUESTION: All right. The plea -- so he hears\nin Spanish someone read to him the words, you cannot\nwithdraw your plea agreement -- cannot withdraw if they\ndon't accept it. And that's conceded in this case. Is\nthat right?\nMS. MOSSMAN: Yes, it -- this was -\nQUESTION: Okay.\nThen afterwards the judge tells him, in\naddition, if -- has anyone explained to you that -- do you\nunderstand that if you -- that if you don't qualify for\nthe safety valve, you go for 10 years. Yes.\nHas anyone promised you you will qualify for the\nsafety valve? No.\nSo you realize you could get 10 years. Yes.\nAll right? Knowing that, you still want to go\nahead with your guilty plea? Yes.\nMS. MOSSMAN: Our -- Justice Breyer, our\nposition is consistent with the Ninth Circuit that he was\nunder an expectation, a highly -- a highly -- high\nexpectation that he would -- would get the safety valve,\nand like the Ninth Circuit said, he had no incentive to\nread or double check the provisions within the plea\nagreement himself. And this -- this -\nQUESTION: I thought one -- one of your points\nwas that this was a rather long agreement and this was\nparagraph 19.\nMS. MOSSMAN: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, that was\ngoing to be my next point. This provision was buried in\nthe plea agreement and one doesn't know, because his\ncounsel couldn't -- doesn't speak Spanish. If he -- if\nthe -- if the interpreter inadvertently misstated that\nprovision -\nQUESTION: I -- I didn't know that you were\nclaiming that this hadn't been an accurate translation.\nMS. MOSSMAN: We -\nQUESTION: I thought your -- your point was that\nit was a lot to absorb without having a written copy to\nfollow.\nMS. MOSSMAN: In our -- Justice Ginsburg, in our\nopposition to the petition for writ of certiorari, we -\nwe claimed that that point, that -- that we have no\ncertainty because there was not a transcript of the\nSpanish interpretation.\nQUESTION: Did you claim that before the Ninth\nCircuit?\nMS. MOSSMAN: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.\nQUESTION: Did the Ninth -- did the opinion\nreflect that at all in the Ninth Circuit?\nMS. MOSSMAN: Yes.\nQUESTION: That -- that you said that it was a\nnot a correct translation?\nMS. MOSSMAN: They -- yes -\nQUESTION: Did it or did it not?\nMS. MOSSMAN: Yes.\nQUESTION: Whereabouts?\nMS. MOSSMAN: I can read -- excuse me, if I may\ncorrect myself, Mr. Chief Justice.\nQUESTION: Yes, please do.\nMS. MOSSMAN: They didn't say that it was not a\ncorrect translation, but they did hold it as not\nconclusive. And they state that in their decision when\nthey say that Mr. --\nQUESTION: Well, finish. Go ahead. Finish the\nrest of your argument.\nMS. MOSSMAN: Just move on?\nQUESTION: Yes, please.\nMS. MOSSMAN: Okay.\nI'd just like to say that the Government's\nburden is -- the Government's test, the prejudice test,\nthe but-for test, is asking this defendant to go back in\ntime and to prove a counter-factual. It's not in this\nrecord, that if not for the error, he would not have pled\nguilty. That's a very heavy burden here. And we believe\nit emasculates the knowing requirements and makes\nawareness of the consequences of the plea irrelevant. And\nthe -- a defendant, if he does not understand the scope of\nthe prosecution's promise, he cannot evaluate the risks\ninherent in the type of plea agreement that he's signing.\nWe think that's critical. The Ninth Circuit agreed that\n-- that the rule 11(e)(2) warning and the type of plea\nagreement that this particular defendant entered into is\nhighly critical and affords a high degree of risk to this\ndefendant because it couldn't withdraw. And it's\ncounterintuitive to enter into an agreement when you\nunderstand that one party could withdraw, to think that\nyou can't.\nThat's why the Congress has asked -- has asked\nthat this warning be expressly made in the rule 11\ncolloquy, that if we -- if I -- I -- I'm not bound by the\nrecommendation. The judge has said I'm not bound by the\nrecommendations, but you cannot withdraw if I do not give\nyou the sentence that you bargained for because that's a\ncounterintuitive understanding. I believe Justice Scalia\nwas getting at this when he talked to Mr. Himmelfarb.\nAnd in closing, I'd just like to say this Court\nshould adhere to the Olano prejudice test and reject the\nGovernment's invitation to adopt a but-for, highly\nprejudiced, highly burden -- excuse me -- strict bright\nline ruling test. And this Court should affirm the Ninth\nCircuit's result, but if they do not -\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Mossman.\nMr. Himmelfarb, you have 5 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAN HIMMELFARB\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Unless there are further\nquestions, we'll waive rebuttal.\nQUESTION: Well, I do have a question. I -- I\nthink that her strongest point there is that he said in\nthe later sentencing hearing that he told his lawyer about\nthe priors. Now, if that's true, the lawyer would have\nknown immediately he couldn't qualify for the safety valve\nand would have told him this whole agreement is a joke\nbecause the judge doesn't have the power to give you\nanything less than 10 years.\nSo if -- if that's true, she must have some kind\nof a claim.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: He may have an ineffective\nassistance of counsel claim -\nQUESTION: An ineffective assistance claim.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: -- Justice Breyer, which he\nwould be -- which he would have to raise in a 2255\nproceeding. But the plain error rule should not be used\nto deal with that type of problem.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nHimmelfarb.\n"
