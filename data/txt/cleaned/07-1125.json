ROTHFELD\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. ROTHFELD: Thank you. If it please the\nCourt:\nThe court of appeals in this case -- excuse\nme, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Could you raise the\npodium?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Actually, I have never used\nthis before, so it's a learning experience for me, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That's enough.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Okay.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: We can't see you.\nMR. ROTHFIELD: That -- that may be an\nadvantage, Your Honor.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But we can hear you.\nMR. ROTHFELD: If -- if I should modify it,\nplease -- please let me know.\nThe court of appeals in this case made two\nfundamental and separate errors, each of which should\nrequire reversal of its decision. First, all agree that\nthe question whether Title IX precludes the use of\nSection 1983 to enforce the Constitution is a matter of\ncongressional intent. Yet, the court of appeals\nentirely disregarded all of the ordinary indicia of\ncongressional intent: The statutory text, the statutory\nbackground structure and evolution, the unquestioned\nlegislative purpose.\nEach of these considerations points\nconclusively towards a single outcome: Congress did not\nmean Title IX to preclude the use of Section 1983 to\nenforce the Constitution.\nSecond, rather than consider any of this\ndirect and compelling evidence of what Congress actually\nhad in mind in Title IX, the court of appeals applied\nwhat it thought to be a presumption that the\navailability of Title IX's implied right of action to\nenforce Title IX's own statutory prohibition of gender\ndiscrimination somehow should be taken to mean that\nCongress meant to preclude the use of Section 1983 to\nenforce constitutional rules against discrimination.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, there is --\nthere is a little bit of an air of unreality about all\nthis, because, of course, Congress didn't provide a\ncause of action in Title IX to start with. And the\nreason they don't have all these limitations and\nrestrictions is because they didn't put in the cause of\naction.\nWe implied it from the statute, and so it\nseems kind of awkward to say: Well, there are no\nlimitations, as I said, when there was no cause of\naction.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, I -- I guess there --\nthere are a number of points that I -- I can make in\nresponse to that, Your Honor. First of all, I think\nwhat -- what you say is absolutely right. Congress did\nnot expressly provide a cause of action in Title IX.\nAnd so since -- since the question in a\npreclusion case, the question whether or not Congress\nmeant to preclude the use of Section 1983, is whether\nthere is a clear indication of congressional intent to\ndo so, that there -- as a matter of definition, that\ncan't be present here. But -- but before --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe the question ought to\nbe whether this Court intended to have the Title IX\naction which it invented preclude 1983. Why don't we\nlook to the intent of this Court?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, I -- I think not, Your\nHonor. I think that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Would you agree that this\nCourt invented the cause of action?\nMR. ROTHFELD: No, I -- I don't agree with\nthat. I -- I do think -- and -- and I -- this is not my\nprincipal point, but I do think it's quite clear that if\nwe are talking about what is the clear intent of\nCongress regarding preclusion of use of Section 1983,\nthat the Congress did not expressly create a -- a\nprivate right of action at all bears very significantly\non that.\nI don't at all disagree that Congress\nintended and expected that the courts would recognize\nthe right of action under -- under Title IX. But\nCongress actually in Title IX specifically I think\naddressed the preclusion question that we have here.\nThere is a clear statutory test that answers\nthe question in this case in -- in several respects.\nFirst of all, when Congress enacted Title IX, it\nspecifically provided that -- it specifically\ncontemplated that there would be continued, private\nconstitutional litigation challenging -- to end\ndiscrimination.\nIt specifically authorized the attorney\ngeneral to intervene in private litigation \"whenever\" --\nand I am here quoting from the text of the statute --\n\"whenever suit is initiated in any court of the United\nStates to assert rights, deprivation of equal\nprotection, under the Fourteenth Amendment of the\nConstitution on account of sex.\"\nCongress, therefore, specifically\ncontemplated when it enacted Title IX that there would\nbe -- there would, in fact, be constitutional litigation\nchallenging gender discrimination on account of sex.\nAnd Congress surely knew that that litigation would\nproceed under Section 1983. Respondents --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Did we rely on that\nprovision in implying the right of action under Title\nIX?\nMR. ROTHFELD: The -- the Court did not. I\nmean there, the -- the Court looked at what it took to\nbe the general -- the manifest congressional intent when\n-- when it enacted Title IX. But it did not\nspecifically rely on -- on that legislation. The\nlegislation, of course, goes to whether or not Section\n1983 suits were available, not whether there is a Title\nIX implied right of action available.\nAnd, as I say, in that -- in that\nlegislative language Congress made expressly clear that\nit intended -- and intended actually to facilitate by\nallowing the attorney general to intervene in --\ncontinued Section 1983 litigation to enforce allegations\nof -- of gender discrimination.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Rothfeld, I follow\nyour argument entirely, and then in the civil rights\narea there are a lot of overlapping statutes. You can\nsue under Title VII. It doesn't take away your right\nunder 1981.\nBut in this case, as we get down to what\nthis case is about, we have a determination by a court\nthat the school district acted reasonably in relation to\nthese complaints. And then you say: But we have\nconstitutional claim. A constitutional claim requires\nyou to show deliberate, intentional conduct if it's an\nindividual; if you are talking about an institution,\nsome kind of not just one incident, but a custom, a\npattern.\nWhat, when you get down to the merits, is\ndifferent about those? In other words, is it on the\nwrong track to talk about precluding a statute? Instead\nof talking about just plain old issue preclusion, what\nis different about 1983?\nYes, you have two claims; but if you lose\nunder IX, you are going to lose under 1983 as well.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, that -- that is right,\nYour Honor, to the extent that the claims are identical\nand that they have actually been adjudicated.\nThe -- the First Circuit in this case\nresolved the Title IX claim focusing on deliberate\nindifference in response to the peer-on-peer sexual\nharassment. To the extent that there is a federal\nconstitutional claim growing out of that conduct of the\nsame sort and to the extent that the elements of that\nclaim are identical, then we agree that at that point\nthat would be precluded. But we think that there is\nmore to this case than that one issue that has been\nresolved.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What more? What more is\nalleged in the complaint? I thought the complaint just\nspoke about deliberate indifference.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, I -- I guess there are\n-- are two points in -- in response to that, Your Honor.\nFirst of all, I think that the complaint can be taken to\nallege in addition more generic --\n(Banging sound.)\nMR. ROTHFELD: I hope I am not responsible\nfor that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will give you an\nextra ten seconds.\nMR. ROTHFELD: And I -- I assure you I will\n-- I will use them, Your Honor.\nThe -- the complaint, we think, should be\ntaken also to be generally in response to complaints of\n-- of misconduct by individuals within the school, but\nin --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Spell that out -- spell\nthat out practically. I know you used --\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, I think -- for example,\nYour Honor, we think that one thing that -- that could\nbe developed and explored further is disparate treatment\nof complaints; for example, the treatment of\ncomplaints of bullying by boys more favorably perhaps\nthan by girls, believing testimony of boys rather than\nbelieving testimony of girls.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there was no\nallegation at all of that kind in this complaint.\nMR. ROTHFELD: I -- I -- I agree that that\nwas not set out specifically in the complaint. The\ncomplaint did say in a -- in a general sense that\nJacqueline Fitzgerald was denied equal access to the\nbenefits of education. It says that the discrimination\nshe suffered included but was not limited to sexual\nharassment. It asked for relief, injunctive relief, to\nbar unconstitutional treatment not only of Jacqueline\nFitzgerald but of all female students in the school,\nwhich I think --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, could you have\nbrought a claim that they didn't let the female students\nplay hockey under your complaint? I mean, that's\nadditional discrimination.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, I think --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Didn't it have to be\nrelated to the particular facts?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Yes, that's right. I\nthink --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And you talked about you\nwanted some additional discovery. What? What is it\nthat you could go to a district judge now and say,\nJudge, I have a basis here for asking for discovery on a\ndifferent but related theory? What words would you use?\nWhat would you write in that request?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, there are a number of\npoints I should make in response to that, Your Honor. I\nthink one is, just as a general matter, we think that\nthat's something -- this entire set of questions are\nthings that are better resolved by the courts of\nappeals -- on -- the court of appeals on remand. I\nthink that there are -- there are unresolved\nconstitutional --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The reason I ask is\nobviously if this case happens to be a case in which,\nbecause of the finding that there was no intentional\ndiscrimination and the school board behaved properly,\nthat if that's the finding and therefore you have no\nclaim under 1983 in respect to that, it becomes very\ntheoretical to say that they went too far and said you\nmight have no other 1983 claim because you would have\nsome other 1983 claim, but we should dismiss this as\nimprovidently granted and wait until somebody does this\nagain.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, certainly -- I --\ncertainly, I understand that suggestion, Justice Breyer.\nAnd let me give you two responses to that. First a\nspecific response to why it could happen on remand.\nThis is not a theoretical possibility. There was\nactually discovery that was requested concerning\nadditional complaints, concerning additional\ndisciplinary action against other students, concerning\nrequests for bus monitors, as to which could have been\ndeveloped that there was disparate treatment as to\nthose. The Respondents declined --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I still don't follow.\nWhat disparate treatment? Did you have to have that\nthey treated girl's complaints one way and boy's\ncomplaints another way?\nMR. ROTHFELD: That -- that would be one way\nin which --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And as far as this record\nshows, there has just been this one incident of\nharassment.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Again, Your Honor, I think\none of the problems is that this case sort of went off\nthe tracks at the earliest possible stage, at the -- at\nthe time this motion for dismissal was granted. And it\ncould have developed in quite a different way.\nFor example, discovery was requested on\nthese subjects that I -- that I mentioned to Justice\nBreyer, which -- which could have been used to develop\nthat, in fact, requests by boys were treated more\nfavorably than requests by girls; complaints by boys\nwere responded to more -- more favor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is that request here in the\nrecord?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Excuse me, Your Honor?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is that request here?\nMR. ROTHFELD: The discovery request?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Do I have the request in\nthe joint -- in the a -- do I have it in the appendix\nhere?\nMR. ROTHFELD: No. No. It --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, we don't have it in\nfront of us?\nMR. ROTHFELD: You do not have it in front\nof you. But I can tell you that the request was made,\nthe Respondents declined to respond it to it for, among\nother reasons, the -- their assertion that it would not\nlead to the discovery of relevant evidence or admissible\nevidence. After the 1983 conclusion ruling, and because\nof the conclusion ruling, that was not followed up\nbecause it would have been futile to try to develop\nadditional argumentation in that -- in that direction.\nHad the case not hopped the track at this\npoint, if the complaint could have amended -- could have\nbeen amended, additional individual defendants could\nhave been added, the case could have gone on in quite a\ndifferent direction.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Rothfeld, we were -- we\nwere warned about all these problems in the brief in\nopposition, weren't we?\nMR. ROTHFELD: That is correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Didn't that focus almost\nentirely upon the fact that there is no 1983 cause of\naction anyway?\nMR. ROTHFELD: That is exactly --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And we nonetheless\ngranted -- granted cert?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Precisely the same arguments\nthat were made in almost identical language in the brief\nin opposition are now being made as an argument as to\nwhy this Court should decide the merits of the 1983\nclaim or dismiss as improvidently granted.\nThe Court -- I don't presume to tell the\nCourt what it was thinking when it granted review of the\ncase, but it did presumably reject those arguments at\nthat point, and there is no reason that they are any\nadditional basis now.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What I understand, Mr.\nRothfeld, that if you win on the question presented, you\nwould agree that the -- the arguments the other side\nmakes on this, on whether there's a cause of action\nunder equal protection and so forth, that would remain\nopen on remand?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And you may still lose the\nlawsuit even if you win here?\nMR. ROTHFELD: That is -- that is absolutely\ncorrect. The constitutional arguments were made on the\nmerits to the district court and to the court of\nappeals. They were not addressed by either. Those\ncourts cut it short and threw the case out on conclusion\ngrounds.\nAnd I -- I think the way in which the court\nof appeals decided the case actually suggests that it\nwas of the view that there was more to the case than\nsimply the Title IX claims that had been rejected,\nbecause one would have thought that if the court of\nappeals was of the view that there is nothing to the\ncase beyond the Title IX peer-on-peer harassment claim\nthat has been reject, it would have ended its discussion\nat that point. It would have said: We reject your\nTitle IX claim; there is nothing more to your 1983\nconstitutional claim; that's the end of the matter.\nBut it didn't do that. It decided the Title\nIX claim on the merits, rejecting it. And it then\nseparately went on to address the Section 1983\nconstitutional claim and said: We are not going to\naddress those merits at all; we are going to say that\nthose claims are precluded as a matter of per se Title\nIX law, that Title IX is preclusive. And, therefore,\none would think that the court of appeals had it in mind\nthat there was more that could have been decided about\nthe merits --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But we find that out on\nremand.\nMR. ROTHFELD: And we'll find that out on\nremand.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What you're saying is\nthey made a basic legal error.\nMR. ROTHFELD: That's --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You may have a losing\ncase under 1983, but let the First Circuit decide that?\nMR. ROTHFELD: That -- that is absolutely\ncorrect. That is our --\nJUSTICE BREYER: How do we know that the\nFirst Circuit wasn't just thinking about the facts of\nthis case in front of it when it said that there's no\n1983 action. I mean, they didn't think there was no\n1983 action for search and seizure. They must have had\nsome idea of what the limitations of their saying no --\nno -- no 1983 action was. So why do we know that they\nwent beyond what they had in front of them in this case?\nI'm not saying they didn't? I am just wanting to know\nwhat we -- how we know that?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, I -- I think one of the\nproblems is, of course, we don't know for sure what --\nwhat they were thinking, and therefore, it makes sense\nto think that this Court, in the regular course of its\npractice could decide the question presented and to send\nthe case back down to the lower courts --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But you see, the question\npresented, I guess is -- I'm trying to get the exact\nwords, but it's whether the Title IX replaces the --\nwhat is it, it's whether -- I'm sorry. You have it\nright in front of you there.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Whether Title IX precludes\nthe assertion of constitutional claims for gender\ndiscrimination in schools under section 1983. The --\nthe -- the reason that I think --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You think they're --\nthey're referring to all of Title IX, no matter what the\nclaims, whether they are overlapping or not?\nMR. ROTHFELD: I think that that is the\nlanguage that the First Circuit uses. The First Circuit\nsays, in so many words, that Title IX is the exclusive\navenue for the assertion of claims of gender\ndiscrimination arising out of -- arising from schools.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, because they were\nrelying on case where we did say that a very detailed\nscheme was pre-emptive?\nMR. ROTHFELD: They were relying on one case\nin which the Court said that, in Smith v. Robinson, the\nonly time in 140 years that Section 1983 has been on the\nbooks that this Court has ever said that Congress meant\nto preclude its use to enforce a particular\nconstitutional right. And I think --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It did that because if\nyou could use 1983, then the very elaborate mechanism\nthat Congress had set up, who would use it?\nMR. ROTHFELD: That's -- that's absolutely\nright. But I -- I -- I add parenthetically that\nCongress promptly responded to the Court's decision in\nSmith by restoring the remedy --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Just on that one issue on\nattorneys' fees.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, I think that the\nlanguage used is actually broader in the -- in the --\nlegislation. But that, as I said, is a parenthetical\npoint.\nI -- I think that something that we have\nhere which was not present in Smith at all -- and as you\nsaid, Justice Ginsburg, it is absolutely right that\nthere was a much more elaborate, involved administrative\nremedial scheme in the statute considered there, there\nis nothing remotely like that in Title IX. But before\nyou could even get to that point, there is this\nexpressed evidence in the statutory text of Title IX\nthat Congress did not mean to preclude. This is Section\n1983.\nFirst there is the provision that I\nmentioned regarding the attorney general, which -- which\nexpressly contemplates there will be continued Section\n1983 constitutional gender discrimination after the\nenactment of Title IX. I think that in and of itself\nwas positive and tells the Court all it needs to know.\nBut beyond -- there is -- there is more.\nBeyond that, there is the language of the\nantidiscrimination provisions of Title IX, which was\nborrowed directly, is identical to the language of Title\nVI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Congress dropped\nthe phrase \"race, color and national origin\" that\nappears in Title VI and substituted \"sex\" in Title IX.\nAnd, so, the Court has recognized that\nCongress expected and intended that Title IX would be\ninterpreted just as -- as had been Title VI.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Have there been any\ndecisions on Title VI and 1983?\nMR. ROTHFELD: There -- there had been a\nmyriad of such decisions. There had been, as we cite in\nour brief, as the American Bar Association cites in its\namicus brief supporting us, the American Civil Liberties\nUnion cites in its brief, there have been almost two\ndozen cases decided before the enactment of Title IX in\nwhich courts allowed the simultaneous assertion of\nstatutory discrimination claims under Title VI and\nsection 1983 discrimination claims under Title IX.\nThere had not been a single suggestion by any decision\nthat there might possibly be preclusion. And so, at the\ntime that Congress used the language of Title IX, it\nknew that that language had been uniformly, widely\nconstrued across the country to allow the simultaneous\nassertion of those claims, not the preclusion of Section\n1983 claims for discrimination.\nAnd so it's when Congress -- when\nlegislative language has been the subject of judicial\nconstruction, as the Court has said many times, and\nCongress repeats that language in a new statute, its\nexpectation and intention is that the judicial\nconstruction is going to be taken as well.\nAnd so that I think that is also dispositive\nof the question in this case, because the Congress chose\nlanguage that it necessarily knew had been understood\nnot to preclude the use of Section 1983.\nAnd I will mention as well, just to throw in\nthe suspenders along with the belt, an additional\nconsideration that the court of appeals ignored here was\nthe manifest legislative purpose of section -- of Title\nIX, which was to expand and strengthen protections\nagainst discrimination in schools.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, of course,\nTitle IX is Spending Clause legislation, and that, under\nour precedents, imposes certain limitations on how we\ninterpret it that would not be applicable under Section\n1983.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Absolutely correct. And I\nthink that there are --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the point is\nthat that would then allow 1983 actions to circumvent\nthose limitations on the Title IX remedy.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, I -- I think not, for a\ncouple of reasons, Your Honor. First, as I say, there\nis this direct evidence of what Congress had in mind.\nIt specifically referred to constitutional litigation\nunder the Fourteenth Amendment when it enacted Title IX,\nand, therefore, by definition it could not have been\nconcerned about evasion in that sense. But I think that\ntheir -- \"evasion\" is not the word to use here because,\non the one hand, there are statutory rights created by\nTitle IX; on the other, there are pre-existing\nconstitutional rights.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And those constitutional\nrights have negated -- I think it might be -- it's at\nleast arguable that it would be harder to win a 1983\ncase, given that, as to the individual, you have\nqualified immunity, and, as to the institution, you have\nto show a custom or practice.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, the only availability\nfor individual liability is under the Constitution,\nbecause Title IX, at least as construed by the lower\ncourts, does not permit suits directly against the\nindividual, only against the institution, which I think\nis a significant distinction between the two and\nsupports the argument that Congress could not have\nintended to preclude because, as the Court has\nrecognized repeatedly, the availability of individual\nliability greatly adds to the deterrence, the effect of\ndeterring constitutional violations.\nAnd the suggestion that, when Congress\nenacted Title IX it would have -- meant to have the\nperverse effect of allowing a school, by accepting\nfederal funds, to insulate school policymakers from any\npersonal statutory liability, you know, for even the\nmost blatant and obvious acts of unconstitutional sex\ndiscrimination, would turn Title IX on its head. It's\ninconceivable that Congress could have had that in mind\nwhen it enacted a statute that was clearly designed to\nexpand and strength protections against sex\ndiscrimination.\nI'll make sort of two additional points,\nYour Honor. As I suggest, I think the direct evidence\nin the statutory text, as well as the legislative\npurpose, is dispositive here and the Court need not go\nbeyond that to answer the question here. That leaves\nthe question of how the court of appeals got the matter\nso far wrong. And I think that the reason that they did\nis, ignoring the text, they applied what they thought to\nbe a presumption derived from this Court's decision in\ncases like Smith v. Robinson and the Palos Verdes case\nthat the creation of a new statutory right and a new\nstatutory remedy necessarily reflects a congressional\nintent to preclude the use of Section 1983 to enforce\noverlapping constitutional remedies. There has never\nbeen such a presumption.\nThe Court has said repeatedly, I think, as\nwas suggested earlier in the discussion, that when\nCongress creates new statutory rights and new statutory\nremedies, they are presumed to overlap with and to\nsupplement existing statutory rights and remedies,\nunless the two are positively repugnant to one another,\nunless they are inconsistent and can't be reconciled.\nThat certainly is not the case here. The Section 1983\nconstitutional claims and Title IX supplement and\ncomplement each other. The two statutes are by no means\ncoterminous in who can be sued.\nThe Court has certainly never presumed that\nthe creation of any statutory right or statutory remedy\nbars the use of Section 1983 to enforce the\nConstitution, as suggested by Justice Ginsburg's\nquestion. The Court has only once in well more than a\ncentury that Section 1983 has been on the books held\nthat availability of the constitutional remedy had been\nprecluded. As I say, Congress promptly responded by\nproviding that remedy.\nThe Palos Verdes decision, which was the\nfulcrum of the court of appeals decision, I think\nsuggests what's wrong with its analysis. Palos Verdes\ninvolved a new statutory right, a new statutory action\nto enforce that right. The statutory action was limited\nin significant respects, and the Court concluded, as a\nmatter of common sense, that one could infer from that\nsituation Congress intended that the new right with the\nnew remedial system would be exclusive, otherwise\nplaintiffs could immediately go to court and render that\nsystem a dead letter.\nBut, as Justice Scalia pointed out in his\nopinion for the Court, that remedy had no effect\nwhatsoever on section 1983. It meant that Congress had\nplaced the new remedy outside of section 1983's remedial\nframework, but that claims that were available prior to\nthe existence of that new right, prior to the creation\nof that new right, remained available under section\n1983. And that is exactly the situation that we have\nhere. Plaintiffs are not trying to allege a new\nstatutory right that is outside the section 1983's\nremedial framework; instead, they are asserting\nfundamental, pre-existing constitutional rights.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I take it they don't\nhave to bring these actions together. They can sue\nunder Title IX; if they lose, then they can start a\nwhole new lawsuit under 1983?\nMR. ROTHFELD: Well, I think that to the\nextent -- as was suggested by Justice Ginsburg's point\nin questioning, to the extent that the claims are the\nsame, then they would preclude it. If the 1983 has the\nsame elements, the same cause of action, it --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It would be a different\nclaim, but there would be issue preclusion.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Issue preclusion. That's\nright.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even if you have\ndifferent -- I guess would you have a different set of\ndefendants, right? You would have the school in the\nTitle IX case, the individuals in the 1983 action?\nMR. ROTHFELD: I think, to the extent that\nthe suit was initially brought against the school under\nTitle IX for a type of claim that could have been\nbrought as a parallel claim against the individual under\nsection 1983, and the Title IX claim was rejected, to\nthe extent that the elements are the same, presumably\nthere would be a defense of collateral estoppel.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And the official -- it's\nthe plaintiff who would be precluded.\nMR. ROTHFELD: That's right. That's right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And the plaintiff has had\na full and fair opportunity to argue those issues.\nMR. ROTHFELD: That's exactly correct.\nIf the Court has no further questions, Your\nHonor --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. ROTHFELD: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Hodge, we will\nhear from you on behalf of the Barnstable School\nCommittee.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF KAY H. HODGE\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMS. HODGE: Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice,\nmay it please the Court:\nTitle IX provides for sex discrimination and\nprovides a remedy for sex discrimination in a broader\ncategory of circumstances than the Equal Protection\nClause. Therefore, having Title IX preclude section\n1983 Equal Protection claims does not deny petitioners\nin this or any other case availability --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Would you go over that\nagain? I didn't understand it. You said Title IX\nprovides --\nMS. HODGE: Title IX --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- against sex\ndiscrimination than the Constitution does.\nMS. HODGE: Correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Explain that to me.\nMS. HODGE: The Title IX prohibits\ndiscrimination on the basis of sex. The Equal\nProtection Clause or section 1983 and the Equal\nProtection Clause require that additional intentional\ndiscrimination that this Court found in Personnel\nAdministrator of Massachusetts v. Feeney. We would\nsuggest to the Court that Title IX actually covers a\nbroad range of circumstances that may not involve that\nvery specific intent required to perfect a\nconstitutional violation. And clearly -- if you look at\nthe cases, the cases clearly involve a variety of\ninstances which would not be sufficient under, say, a\nconstitutional evaluation.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Give me an example.\nMS. HODGE: An example would be the\nsituation such as this particular situation. We are\ntold this is a case of peer-on-peer, student-on-student\nharassment. In this situation, the standard as decided\nby this Court in Davis is deliberate indifference.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And what would the\nstandard be under 1983?\nMS. HODGE: The standard under 1983 is also\ndeliberate indifference, but it requires then that the\ndeliberate indifference be shown to be not just the act\nof a school administrator who does not do what they\nshould do in order to pursue a particular complaint;\nbut, rather, there needs to be the specific intent to\ndiscriminate or -- or specific intent to choose boys\nover girls or girls over boys in that decisionmaking\nprocess.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but if you lose under\n-- under Title IX, a fortiori, you would lose under the\nConstitution, I would think.\nMS. HODGE: I -- I believe -- and that is,\nin essence, the position that the Barnstable School\nCommittee and Superintendent Debra are arguing in this\ncase; that is, that because deliberate indifference is\nthe standard that is applicable both under Title IX and\nalso under the Constitution, that it is -- it is --\nhaving lost the issue of deliberate indifference before\nthe First Circuit, that finding of the First Circuit\nprecludes any further controversy between the parties in\nthis case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But they didn't go on the\nissue of preclusion. If they had done that, it would be\na different case. They said that Title IX is preemptive\nof 1983. And they cited the cases where -- like Smith\nagainst Robinson where that is what the Court held.\nMS. HODGE: I believe, Your Honor, that we\nhave a situation in which you have both claim\npreclusion -- both preclusion under Smith v. Robinson as\nwell as issue preclusion, which makes it somewhat\ncomplicated. But I would suggest in this case under\nthese circumstances, because the issue was deliberate\nindifference and because there was a finding both as a\nlegal matter as well as a factual matter of deliberate\nindifference, that essentially the two sort of collapsed\ninto one.\nWith regard to Smith, I would point out that\nunder the Smith theory constitutional claims can be\nprecluded if the -- under the statute under review it\nhas comprehensive, remedial schemes. And we would argue\nthat there is a comprehensive remedial scheme, and that\nthis Court has, in fact, sort of found that and even\nadded to it in the development -- have found that\nCongress intended to add to the remedial scheme an\nimplied right of action.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you -- you must, I\nthink, recognize that the elaborate scheme that Congress\nset up under the Education of the Handicapped Act is\nquite different from what this Court did. It just said\nthere is a private right -- right of action. There is\nan implied private right of action.\nIt didn't set up any administrative\nmechanism. It didn't set up any regime for going to --\nto an agency first and then coming to the court, none of\nthat.\nMS. HODGE: There is not. But I would\nsuggest that that is appropriate under the\ncircumstances. And I would also suggest that there is,\nin fact, an administrative scheme. The regulations\nthat, in fact -- that have been promulgated by the\nOffice of Civil Rights and the Department of Education,\nin fact, have a number of prerequisites and\nrequirements. They impose upon --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You are not arguing\nthat the agency regulations have the effect of\nprecluding the 1983 action.\nMS. HODGE: No. I mean we are not arguing\n-- we are arguing that some of those steps are\nillustrations of sort of a -- the -- the scheme that was\ncreated. But there is a remedial -- the -- the remedial\nscheme leads to the potential loss of federal funding --\nof --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Are you saying -- are you\n-- is this what you are saying: We imagine that we have\na institution that is receiving Federal assistance,\nokay? And we also imagine that somebody is claiming\nthat on the basis of gender they have been excluded from\nparticipating in, or denied the benefit of, or have been\nsubject to discrimination.\nAre you saying that it is impossible for\nanyone to imagine a circumstance in which it would be\nheld the defendant did not violate Title IX, but in\nwhich the court held it did violate the Equal Protection\nClause? There is no such circumstance; no one can\nimagine one. Is that what you are saying?\nMS. HODGE: Your Honor, what I am saying is\nI cannot imagine one. And I don't believe --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You cannot imagine one.\nAnd you think no one can imagine one. So the obvious\nquestion on rebuttal is, since we have limited it to\nthat universe, it would be the other side must imagine\none?\nMS. HODGE: I believe that that is true.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's simple.\nMS. HODGE: And I would point out that in\nresponse to the Petitioners' argument today, they have\nattempted to suggest that there may be some issues that\nwere not discovered; that were not, in fact, fully\nreviewed by the court below.\nAnd I suggest that the First Circuit did, in\nfact, look at specifically that issue. And the First\nCircuit said in their decision that, in looking at the\nequal protection claim in particular, that the\npetitioners offer -- or in that case, they offer, the\nplaintiffs offer -- no theory of liability under the\nequal protection clause other than the defendants'\nsupposed failure to take adequate actions to prevent\nand/or remediate the peer-on-peer harassment that\nJacqueline experienced.\nAnd I suggest to you that that is exactly\nthe issue that -- that that is exactly the issue. The\nissue is whether or not, if you look at the complaint,\nthe claim that is being brought under Title IX and the\nclaim that is being brought under Section 1983 in the\nConstitution are virtually identical, which is a second\nproblem of the Smith test: If there is a comprehensive\nremedial scheme. Again, it's a remedial scheme.\nAnd, second, the question is: Are the\nclaims virtually identical? And I would suggest to you\nthat the First Circuit found that they were virtually\nidentical. And I would suggest that that is what leads\nto preclusion.\nNow, that doesn't mean that there aren't\nother claims that could be made with regard to others.\nBut for the institution, it -- I -- the -- it is very\nimportant. Congress established this particular scheme\nunder Section 19 -- under Title IX, and it would be our\nview that Congress specifically and intentionally\nfocused -- fixed the responsibility for sex\ndiscrimination on the institution and on the\ninstitutional recipient of Federal financial assistance.\nAnd that if you were to allow Section 1983\nclaims, that enforcement would not be nearly as\nequitable. We would point out that it's obvious, but it\nis important to consider that recipients of Federal\nfinancial assistance include not only municipalities\nthat include public schools; they include State entities\nwhich under this Court's decision -- under this Court's\nprior decision in Wills versus Michigan are not subject\nto suit under Section 1983 and private entities that are\nnot subject to 1983 at all.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Does a disparate-impact\nclaim violate section -- Title IX?\nMS. HODGE: There -- there --it is not 100\npercent clear except for the following, and I would\nsuggest this: Title IX prohibits discrimination. If it\nwere determined that a policy or other practice led to a\ndenial of equal access to the benefits in -- in -- and\nparticipatory activities of an individual student based\non their gender, I believe it is covered; and I believe\nit is discrimination; and I believe it is prohibited.\nAnd the fact of the matter is, though, that\nunder the law as developed by this Court and the Equal\nProtection Cause, the fact of the matter is that it\nwould not cover disparate impact, because this Court has\nheld that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you have any case in\nall of Title IX that -- that fits that abstract picture\nthat you have just described? I mean you have to have a\npattern and practice of what -- a pattern and practice\nof discrimination -- to get -- to get under the\nConstitution or under 1983?\nYou have to have deliberate indifference to\nwhat: To the gender harassment, to the gender\ndiscrimination? So can you describe to me that --\nanything, any Title IX case, that has a disparate\nimpact? We really didn't want a Feeney type of case.\nWe really didn't want this to happen but we had a test,\nand it came out that way.\nMS. HODGE: Well, I believe --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you describe a Title\nIX case that's like Feeney in that respect where we\ndidn't want this diverse impact to occur; we really\ndidn't want it at all, but it happened?\nMS. HODGE: I believe that the fact that it\nhappened is sufficient discrimination to come under\nTitle IX. I would point out to Your Honor that the\nCannon case, in fact, involved essentially the -- a\ndisparate-impact type case. It dealt with admissions\npolicies and the effect of the admissions policies on\nindividuals.\nAnd, consequently, I believe that it is not\nethereal. It is quite real. But the difference is that\nthe question becomes one of whether or not an\nindividual, based on their gender, is being denied the\nbenefits of, and participation in, available --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: On the basis of gender.\nMS. HODGE: On the basis of gender -- on the\nbasis of gender, but I don't believe the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And Feeney says it wasn't\non the basis of gender. It was on the basis that she\nwasn't a veteran.\nMS. HODGE: But you see, I believe that the\nimpact, which would have been an individual would not\nhave been allowed to participate, may be an additive\nfactual conclusion which would go to the general\ndiscrimination issue. The position that -- the argument\nwe are making to this Court includes the fact that since\nTitle IX is as broad, if not broader, and I would\nsuggest the following through a visual picture.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there is -- you are\nleaving out something quite glaring in that respect.\nFor example, single sex schools, military academies,\nadmissions to elementary and high schools, are not\ncovered by Title IX.\nMS. HODGE: Oh, you are absolutely correct,\nYour Honor, and under those circumstances, we would\nsuggest that as this Court found in Mississippi v Hogan,\nthat those institutions would then be subject to section\n1983 review, but on the highly constitutional standard\nwhich requires intentional discrimination; and second of\nall, we believe that that is -- that Mississippi is an\nillustration of the reason why the argument of\nPetitioner regarding 2000h of Title IX, which deals with\nthe fact that -- that when they passed Title IX, they\nalso reserve the opportunity for the Attorney General to\nbecome involved in a case under 1983, that the intention\nof that language was not necessarily to preserve 1983 in\ncases against recipients who are in fact covered, but it\nwould have been to reserve the right of the Attorney\nGeneral to -- to intervene in cases in which either the\ninstitution was not covered -- because you are\nabsolutely right, there are institutions which are not\ncovered -- and as you decided in Mississippi v Hogan,\nthey would be subject to section 1983; and/or\nindividuals that the First Circuit recognized might,\nbecause they -- if they are -- if they are State actors,\nthat is not the case you have here, which was\npeer-on-peer harassment -- but if you is had a situation\nwhere for example, a teacher or an administrator was in\nfact the alleged harasser, that a 1983 could be brought\nagainst the individual, and indeed the Attorney General\ncould intervene in those cases.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If it's an individual,\nunder Title IX you can't bring the suit.\nMS. HODGE: Correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. But you could\nunder 1983?\nMS. HODGE: Correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay.\nMS. HODGE: But --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So your point then is --\nand that's why I have had trouble with this case -- is\nthat if you look at the First Circuit opinion, it sort\nof seems to say, \"if there is a difference, of course\nyou can have a 1983 suit, but if there is no difference,\nyou can't.\" I mean, everybody here seems to agree to\nthat, I guess.\nSo I'm not certain what to do, because Selya\nstarted his opinion by saying this isn't a case where\nTitle IX doesn't apply; it does apply; they have the\nfunding; but he doesn't talk about the exemptions and he\ndoesn't really talk about the -- a difference between\nsuing an institution and suing an individual. So maybe\nwhat we should say is, maybe he meant it, but he didn't\nsay it.\nMS. HODGE: Well, I would argue -- I would\nargue to the Court that I would hope that this Court\nwould take -- would affirm the First Circuit opinion,\nbut I would say to -- to -- to Your Honor the following:\nthat with regard to the individual defendant in this\ncase, who is the superintendent of schools, who as we\nargue, the question presented only deals with the\ninstitutional recipient; but nevertheless the First\nCircuit found that the individual was acting only in\ntheir official capacity.\nAnd once again, that -- that issue is not\nbefore this Court. And having decided that they were\nacting in the individual's official capacity, we would\nargue therefore that the individual would not be sued,\nbecause the claim and all of the facts --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So you were saying if it's\nan individual acting in his official capacity, you\ncannot sue him under Title IX?\nMS. HODGE: To the -- yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Okay.\nMS. HODGE: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then their answer to that\nwhich is now say, look, we want to sue an individual in\nhis official capacity; that's why we want to bring our\n1983 suit. And then you reply, but there are bars here\nof collateral estoppel. Claim preclusion, whatever it\nis.\nMS. HODGE: Issue preclusion.\nJUSTICE BREYER: They all have new names.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. HODGE: Okay.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The -- the -- okay, so\nthat's your argument.\nSo why don't we just send it back, say\nthat's right; this suit is not precluded by 1983;\nindeed, that's the only place can you bring it; it's not\nprecluded by Title IX, and now court, you go decide\nwhether claim preclusion exists, or whatever they call\nit. Collateral estoppel, or -- you understand what I\nmean.\nMS. HODGE: Your Honor, I believe that they\ndid decide that in the language I did quote to you just\na moment ago from the First Circuit opinion, which is\nfound at the appendix 23a or the decision. Essentially\nthey are -- they are saying that -- that there was --\nthat because no theory of liability was offered other\nthan this, that there isn't any further claim available.\nWith regard to sending this case back, we\nargue, based upon the deliberative difference standard,\nwhich I think is indisputably -- the standard falls\nunder Title IX, and the standard under the Equal\nProtection Clause -- that that deliberative difference\nstandard and -- and the fact the First Circuit found\nthat -- that there was -- that the Barnstable School\nCommittee acted reasonably and without deliberative\ndifference, precludes -- there is no issue in\ncontroversy anymore.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yet the other side says\nthat there may be, and I don't know why we ought to get\ninto that. Why can't we just send it back and let them\nfigure that out? And -- and -- and decide what we took\nthis case to decide, namely, the split that now exists\nin the Federal courts over whether Title IX precludes\nthe use of 1983. That is an important question. It's\nwhy we took the case. Why can't we decide that issue\nand then for all these loose ends, send it back to the\ncourt of appeals?\nMS. HODGE: Because there must be an issue\nin controversy for this Court to send any -- there must\nbe an issue in controversy here and also --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He says there is an issue\nin controversy, that's good enough for me.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. HODGE: Well -- well, with all due\nrespect, I would suggest that what you have to look at\nis the complaint, and you have to look at the argument,\nyou know, what was in fact argued. And I would\nsuggest --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- I'm sorry, so\nyou seem to be saying that they were right, that 1983\nactions are not always precluded, depending on whether\nthere is a difference in the issues that are presented\nor whatever.\nSo you should never say that Title IX\nprecludes an action under 1983. In fact, you should say\nthat sometimes the issues that are litigated under Title\nIX may result in the fact that you don't have\navailable -- you don't get relief under 1983, but there\nis still a cause of action.\nMS. HODGE: I don't -- I don't believe that\nthat is -- that that -- that that should -- that should\nbe the result of your decisionmaking.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's kind of odd to\nsay that -- as I understand what you are saying, you are\nsaying that whenever there is issue preclusion, the\nconsequence is that 1983 is precluded in the sense that\nactions were precluded in Smith. Well why -- I guess\nI've gotten -- maybe I am repeating the question. Why\ndo we have to decide that, and we would just say there\nis a 1983 action, but you may not be able to pursue it,\nI guess is the way to put it, if your claims are\nprecluded or the issues result in the fact that you\ndon't recover.\nMS. HODGE: I -- I believe that that would\nbe satisfactory. From our point of view because we\nbelieve the issue preclusion applies that would be\nsatisfactory because we --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That -- but that doesn't\ncover the situation in which a plaintiff says, I don't\nwant to proceed under Title IX; I want to proceed first\nunder 1983. Then there is going to be no question about\nwhether 1983 is -- is unavailable because of issue\npreclusion. He is starting with 1983.\nMS. HODGE: There is no question, but in\nthose circumstances then as to an institution --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What is your position on\nthat --\nMS. HODGE: Our position is that as a\nrecipient of Federal -- if the institution involved is a\nrecipient of Federal financial assistance who is covered\nby Title IX --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You can't proceed under\n1983.\nMS. HODGE: Cannot proceed under 1983.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you are disagreeing.\nMS. HODGE: Yes, we are. Yes, we are\ndisagreeing, and I would suggest that the difficulty\nthat this Court is having, or at least as I experience\nit, the difficulty with regard to issue preclusion and\nclaim preclusion turns in this case on the fact that\nthis perhaps being a peer-on-peer harassment case --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't it quite clear we\ncan forget about issue preclusion and assume as\nJustice Scalia did, the client brought an action under\n1983 and did not rely on Title IX at all, and just sued\nthe school board, you would say he can't do that?\nMS. HODGE: Correct. Correct.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And that's your issue,\nwhether that's right or wrong. We don't have to talk\nabout issue -- issue preclusion to decide that issue.\nMS. HODGE: That is correct, except that as\nwe argue -- what we have argued before the Court is that\nunder Smith the question is, is there a comprehensive\nremedial scheme, and we would argue that there is; but\nthen have you to determine whether the claims are\nvirtually identical; and we would argue that here the\nclaims are virtually identical.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Wouldn't your reasoning\napply to, say, a race discrimination case in employment?\nWe have got title VII and you have 1981. Title VII has\na lot of accoutrements, a lot of text to go through;\n1981 is plain and simple. So therefore, title VII ought\nto preempt 1981, right? So you -- in the area of race\ndiscrimination and employment, title VII would end any\naccess to 1981. It would be the same kind of argument,\nwouldn't it?\nMS. HODGE: I believe that -- that there is\nthat argument, but to be honest, I'm not in a position\nright now to reflect on exactly -- I believe that that\nwould be certainly the direction, however, there are\nunique aspects of race. And I believe that that is yet\nanother basis on which I would quarrel with the\nPetitioner with regard to suggesting that Title VI\nand -- and Title IX ought to be treated exactly the\nsame. The history of sex discrimination versus race\ndiscrimination are quite different in scope.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What does that have to\ngot to do with what you are arguing is that if you have\nan elaborate mechanism, which you said you have under\nTitle IX, I think that is debatable? But that was\ncertainly the picture in Smith, and it's the picture in\nTitle VII, Title VII versus 1981. That -- that fits\nyour -- the -- your description, Title VII and 1981,\nmuch better than Title IX and 1983, I think.\nMS. HODGE: I guess I -- I don't agree. It\nis our -- it is our view that 19 -- that in this\nparticular instance -- and I -- and I think I may have\nmisspoken if the view is, is that it's the\nadministrative schemes that get compared. I -- I\nbelieve under Smith, the issue is whether or not there\nis a comprehensive remedial scheme, and here you have\nthe remedy -- both an administrative remedy as well as a\nprivate right of action, which we would argue should\npreclude the 1983 claims.\nMoreover, we would also look with regard to\nthe fact that this is a constitutional claim to the --\nto Bivens -- to the line of cases under Bivens which we\ncite in our brief, the fact that when Congress provides\na remedy for a particular area -- in a particular area,\nthat that remedy can preclude an independent action\nwhich even is based on the Constitution. And we would\nsuggest that that would be -- that that is something\nthat we would urge this Court to consider --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's because\nwe're still in the business of implying rights of action\nunder Bivens. And it's different to say -- you know, if\nyou say we are applying it, but as soon as Congress does\nsomething, we are not going to do that. That's quite\ndifferent than construing a provision like 1983 which\nCongress has enacted.\nMS. HODGE: Well, that is correct, except\nthat this Court has, in fact, applied its preclusion\ndoctrine by looking at whether or not Congress has made\nany statement in the statute, then if you want to take\nit statute to statute, then what you would be looking at\nis you would be looking at essentially Rancho Palos\nVerdes. And as -- as this Court did in -- when it\ndecided Rancho Palos Verdes, it remanded for\nconsideration communities of equity, which is a Title IX\ncase for reconsideration by, I believe it's the Eighth\nCircuit under the Rancho Palos Verdes decision.\nAnd while that case ultimately did not come\nback to this Court, but the circuit court determined\nthat it treated -- it treated the issue differently, and\nwe would argue that that is a part of this split, and\nthat that is -- and that is not the appropriate\nresolution.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There was no\nconstitutional claim in -- what was it -- Palos Verdes.\nMS. HODGE: Exactly. There was no\nconstitutional claim in Rancho Palos Verdes. However,\nthis Court did cite Smith and did cite Smith in its\ndecision and -- and favorably so. But moreover, we\nwould argue that -- the question is really a different\n-- comparing a statute to statute, which is Title IX to\nsection 1983. Congress allowed for actions in 1983,\nCongress allows for actions under Title IX, or whether\nor not you are looking at the issue of Title IX versus a\nconstitutional claim.\nNow, I want to just make the point that\npreclusion makes sense. Congress really did put the\nfocus in Title IX on the institution, and Congress is\nalso seeking to have equity of enforcement.\nFurther, as set for in the amici in support\nof the Respondents' position, we would point out that if\nsection 1983 claims are not precluded, that it would\nrequire the expenditure of funds by -- by recipients of\nfederal financial assistance on a variety of issues that\nare totally unnecessary including qualified immunity.\nAnd on the peer-on-peer harassment case, I\nthink it's very important to focus on what this case is.\nIt is a peer-on-peer, student-on-student harassment\nwhere, what you would have is, if you were going to\nallow additional claims under section 1983 against the\ninstitution, it would -- it would intrude and interfere\nwith the school's processes of disciplining students.\nAnd I would also suggest that it might also\ninterfere in the classic manner in which --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask you one sort of\nanomaly that keeps running through my mind in this case.\nIf you have two school boards, one of -- two schools,\nstate schools, one gets federal funds and the other does\nnot, does this preclude -- no 1983 remedy against one,\nbut there is a 1983 remedy against the other, that's\nyour view, isn't it?\nMS. HODGE: It is exactly our view because\nthe recipients would be subject to the remedial scheme\nset forth in Title IX.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is it anomalous to think\nit --\nMS. HODGE: I don't think anomalous. I\nbelieve the reverse is anomalous, because what you would\nbe suggesting if you do not preclude section 1983, you\nwould suggest that the recipient could have both the\n1983 and a Title IX, whereas the nonrecipient would have\njust section 1983.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Would it prove the same\nfacts in both cases? I mean, the case of it would\ninvolve the same evidence, same alleged wrongdoing, and\nthen one case you can rely on 1983 and the other you\ncan't?\nMS. HODGE: I believe under those\ncircumstances, Justice Stevens, that what we would be\ntalking about would be the situation where a -- under\nTitle IX there is -- there's actually an easier path to\nrecovery, if you will, because it does not require the\nspecific intent required by Massachusetts v. Feeney,\nwhich we believe sets a slightly higher -- a bar and a\nhigher level of intentionality.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought you just said\nthat a deliberate indifference under both statutes,\nunder 1983 and Title IX.\nMS. HODGE: Your Honor, it is -- deliberate\nindifference is the standard. However, in order to\nprove a constitutional violation, you must also have the\nspecific intent for invidious discrimination that we --\nthat this Court has not imposed and did not impose in\nDavis for violations of peer -- for peer-on-peer\nharassment cases.\nSo, while the discrimination needs to be\nintentional under Title IX, it is not required that\nthere be the specific intent to favor one over the other\nor one protected status over the other.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then you wouldn't have\ngender discrimination.\nMS. HODGE: But you -- excuse me, I'm sorry.\nYou would have gender discrimination if you have a\ntypical -- in the peer-on-peer harassment cases, the\nquestion is whether or not the institution was or was\nnot deliberately indifferent in the manner in which it\nresponds. In -- in a deliberate indifference --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Response to what?\nResponse --\nMS. HODGE: To a complaint about sexual\nharassment. If the institution fails to respond\nappropriately, the lower courts have found that that can\nbe gender discrimination under Title IX. They do not in\nany way look to ensure that -- look to determine whether\nor not there is that specific invidious discrimination\nthat we would argue this Court has imposed in its cases\nunder the Equal Protection Clause.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So you wouldn't have --\nif you work for a municipality and your boss has been\nharassing you, you would not have a case under 1983?\nMS. HODGE: If you were a municipality and\nyour boss was harassing you, in a school setting by a\nrecipient of federal financial assistance?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You were saying the\nconstitutional standard is different, so I am just\ngiving you a case. It could be a school, it could be\nanother municipal employment.\nMS. HODGE: You would need to have the\nspecific intent, invidious intent that we believe is an\nadditional element and a much harder element to prove in\nthat situation.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms.\nHodge. Mr. Rothfeld, you have five minutes, remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. ROTHFELD: Thank you, Your Honor. I\nwill try not to use my extra ten seconds.\nTwo principal points. First on the proper\ndisposition of this case. The First Circuit's holding,\nand I'm reading from 24a of the petition appendix: the\ncomprehensiveness of Title IX's remedial scheme\nindicates Congress saw Title IX solely as vindicating\nthe constitutional right to be free from gender\ndiscrimination perpetrated by educational institutions;\nit follows that the plaintiff's equal protection claims\nare precluded.\nThat was not a holding that had to do with\nclaim preclusion, issue preclusion, title estoppel; it's\na holding that constitutional claims simply cannot go\nforward. So there were constitutional claims were\nadvanced below, argued to both courts, that have not\nbeen discussed by any court at any point, and I think\nthe proper disposition here is, the most regular course\nin a case of this sort to is decide the question\npresented, send the case back.\nIt certainly is not the case -- it's a\ncommonplace that the Court has threshold questions that\nare presented to it. There are remaining issues that\nhave to be resolved on remand, it's certainly not the\nCourt's usual practice to decide whether or not\nplaintiffs can -- can prevail on those claims on remand\nbefore deciding the threshold question on which cert was\ngranted. I think that's the appropriate approach for\nthe Court to take here.\nOn the merits, very quickly. Again I think\nwe have to -- the gold standard of evidence as to\npreclusion, we have expressed statutory text that deals\nwith it. Learned colleague suggested that the Attorney\nGeneral intervention provision somehow limited the cases\ninvolving claims by schools that do not accept Federal\nfunds are somehow not subject to Title IX. That is not\nthe language of the provision. The provision says\nwhenever -- whenever it is claimed, it is initiated, in\na court of the United States asserting deprivation of\nrights essentially on account of sex, the Attorney\nGeneral can intervene. Clearly Congress had it in mind\nthat there would be such claims, and this was enacted as\npart of -- Title IX was enacted as part of the statute\nthat creates rights against discrimination by schools\nreceiving Federal funds. It makes no sense to suggest\nthat Congress --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, does that provision\napply only when there is a Title IX cause of action?\nMR. ROTHFELD: No. No.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh well, if it doesn't,\nthen it -- then it has validity whether or not you agree\nwith your position.\nMR. ROTHFELD: That's true but I think it\nanswers the preclusion question that it suggests that\nCongress has it in mind that there would in fact be\nsection 1983 constitutional litigation involving gender\ndiscrimination.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They thought only in cases\nwhere there is no Title IX action.\nMR. ROTHFELD: They said whenever there is a\nclaim of unconstitutional gender discrimination. I\nthink it's a blanket suggestion Congress made --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, you don't think they\nmean whether there is a valid claim? Even when there is\na claim that isn't allowed under the law?\nMR. ROTHFELD: I am suggesting that the\nlanguage says that whenever a claim of gender\ndiscrimination is advanced under the Constitution, the\nAttorney General can intervene. I think what we can\ndraw from that is Congress imagined, it said there would\nbe constitutional litigation involving gender\ndiscrimination after they enacted the law. And because\nthat provision was added to the law as part of Title IX,\nCongress surely contemplated that these suits would\ninvolve gender discrimination involving schools.\nThe other sort of clear textual indication\nwhich again, again my learned colleague has not really\ndiscussed, is the Title VI history of enforcement prior\nto the enactment of Title IX, which would absolutely --\nthat there are almost two such dozen decisions, which\nthis Court incorporated into the canon, which suggests\nit is not only appropriate, it's realistic to think that\nwhen Congress was aware of at the time it enacted Title\nIX. Those decisions clearly indicated there was no\npreclusion. The language of Title VI and Title IX is\nidentical. There can be no doubt, I think, that\nCongress would have had it in mind, which, if it is not\nappropriate in this context as well.\nOne final, very quick point. This is an\nimplied right of action; to suggest that Congress meant\nto preclude the use of the Constitution to enforce --\npreclude section 1983 to enforce the Constitution while\nleaving it to the courts to imply the alternative\nremedy, to devise the contours on and the limitations on\nthat remedy, would require -- hypothesize a remarkable\nleap of faith on the part of Congress.\nIt also would require the most extravagant\nand speculative reading of Title IX, to understand that\nit's not only to include private rights of action but to\npreclude the assertion of express rights of action\ncreated by Congress by a language in another statute.\nIf there are no further questions, Your\nHonor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
