        "content": "(10:03 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear\nargument first this morning in Case 10-238, Arizona Free\nEnterprise Club's Freedom Club PAC v. Bennett and the\nconsolidated case.\nMr. Maurer.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM R. MAURER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. MAURER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis case is about whether the government\nmay insert itself into elections and manipulate campaign\nspending to favor its preferred candidates. Arizona\ndoes this in a manner that is even more burdensome to\nfree speech than the law at issue in Davis v. FEC.\nArizona burdens the law of three groups that pose no\nthreat of corruption under this Court's precedents:\nIndependent expenditure groups, self-financed\ncandidates, and candidates who raise private funds under\none of the lowest contribution limits in the Nation.\nUnder Davis v. FEC and this Court's\nwell-established precedents, the matching funds\nprovision is unconstitutional and should be struck down.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Maurer, you -- you\ndon't have any objection, you wouldn't have any\nobjection, if Arizona trebled the amount at the outset?\nIn other words, there was a maximum amount, the\nso-called matching funds; if it were given all in one\nlump and the publicly funded candidate was told, give it\nback if you don't use it, that would be okay?\nMR. MAURER: That would be constitutional\nunder Davis, Your Honor.\nThis case is not about whether the State of\nArizona may provide campaign financing using public\nfunds, nor is it about whether -- the ability of Arizona\nto ensure that those who receive the public funds can\nrun effective campaigns. What this case is about is\nwhether the government can turn my act of speaking into\nthe vehicle by which my political opponents benefit with\ndirect government subsidies.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Could I try to understand\nthat argument a little bit better, Mr. Maurer?\nSuppose -- and I know that you think this is not the\ncase, but just bear with the hypothetical. Suppose that\nthere were, in fact, no deterrent effect on your speech\nor on the speech of any candidate; in other words, that\npeople thought, well, you know, I would rather be -\nhave me be the only person who talks, but -- but I would\nrather talk than be silent, even if it means my opponent\ncan talk, too, so that there's no deterrent effect from\nthis law whatsoever.\nWould there still be a constitutional\nobjection?\nMR. MAURER: Your Honor, in Davis this Court\nrecognized that a trigger like this, a -- the law that\nturns the choice of -- my choice to speak effectively\ninto fundraising advantages for my opponents constitutes\na substantial burden. So even if candidates continue to\nspeak, the law constitutes a substantial burden on their\nspeech.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, it constitutes a\nsubstantial burden, so even if every single person makes\na choice, yes, I want to continue to speak, it does not\nchill any speak -- any speech. I suppose I'm not sure\nwhat it means to constitute a substantial burden if, in\nfact, the law does not chill speech.\nMR. MAURER: Well, Your -- Your Honor, this\nCourt in Davis recognized that when the government\nreaches into a campaign and attempts to manipulate\ncampaign financing in order to -- in order to basically\neffectuate the outcome, that constitutes a -- an\nillegitimate governmental purpose.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Maurer, suppose -\nsuppose the government imposes a fine of $500 for all\npolitical speech, and people nonetheless continue to\nengage in political speech and pay the $500. Would that\nmake the $500 penalty for political speech\nconstitutional?\nMR. MAURER: No, it would not, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But, in fact, there's no\nsuch restriction here, is there, Mr. Maurer? There's no\nrestriction at all here; it's more speech all the way\naround?\nMR. MAURER: I would disagree with that,\nrespectfully, Your Honor. There is a restriction here.\nEvery time an independent expenditure group or a\nprivately financed candidate speaks above a certain\namount, the government creates real penalties for them\nto have engaged in unfettered political expression.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, doesn't the government\nactually just give a selective subsidy? It's not a\npenalty, it's just saying, in order to -- to run an\neffective public financing system, when you speak, we're\ngoing to give a subsidy over a certain amount. So the\ntrigger does not trigger a penalty; it triggers a\nsubsidy.\nMR. MAURER: Your Honor, in Davis, this\nCourt recognized that in the context of competitive\nelections, which are a zero-sum game, what benefits one\ncandidate will burden, necessarily, or harm the other\ncandidate.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Didn't they call it a\nsubsidy in Davis? I -- if I recall the argument, I\nthink that's what -- what it was characterized as there,\ntoo. Did they characterize it as a penalty? I doubt\nit.\nMR. MAURER: In fact, it was not a subsidy\nin Davis, Your Honor. The -- the effect of this law is\nconsiderably harsher than the law at issue in Davis. In\nDavis, the non-millionaires' candidate still had to go\nout and actually raise the funds that the Millionaires'\nAmendment permitted him to raise. In this case, the law\nprovides direct government subsidies, based on my act of\nspeaking, to my political opponents.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: There is, though, a\nsignificant difference between Davis and this case.\nWhat the expenditure triggered in Davis was a\ndiscriminatory restriction that would never be allowed\nin and of itself. What the law triggers here is\nsomething that, as Justice Ginsburg said, the government\ncould do from the get-go, which is subsidize the speech\nof a candidate who decides to participate in a public\nfinancing system.\nMR. MAURER: Well, Your Honor, the -- I\nwould point out that independent expenditure groups do\nnot have that choice of participating in the subsidy or\nnot. So to the extent that Davis relied on the fact\nthat there was a discriminatory treatment of speakers in\nthe same race, this case -- this law replicates and\nactually exacerbates the harm that was at issue in\nDavis.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But there's no particular\nas-applied challenge from independent speakers in this\nlawsuit, is there?\nMR. MAURER: Yes, there is, Your Honor. I\nrepresent two independent expenditure groups.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: My -- my understanding was\nthat the suit was brought as a facial challenge to the\nentire law.\nMR. MAURER: This is a facial and as-applied\nchallenge, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In -- in this case, do you\nthink the law is content-neutral within its own\nuniverse, which applies just to political speech, so\nit's not content-neutral in that sense? But within the\nscheme that it sets up, is it content-neutral?\nMR. MAURER: Absolutely not, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Why?\nMR. MAURER: Because the only thing that\nwill trigger matching funds, particularly for\nindependent expenditure groups, is the content of the\nmessage. If an independent expenditure group speaks in\nfavor of a privately financed candidate, they will not\ntrigger matching funds. If they speak against a\npublicly financed candidate, they will trigger matching\nfunds. That not is only content-based; it is also a\nrejection of the standard this Court enunciated in\nCitizens United that the government cannot make\ndistinguishing burdens on the basis of an identity of a\nspeaker.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In Justice Ginsburg's\nhypothetical -- I'm still trying to think about -\nsuppose there is one candidate for the -- for the pink\nparty, and then three candidates for the orange party,\nand all three candidates for the orange party received\nthe lump sum Justice Ginsburg was talking about. But\nthere's only one candidate on the other side, and he has\nto face, or she has to face, three.\nIs that constitutional?\nMR. MAURER: It would not be -- I'm sorry.\nIt would be constitutional under Davis. And I -- and I\nthink that the point, Your Honor, is reflected -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't understand the\nhypothetical. I really didn't.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: One person is on one side;\nthree people are on the other side. And under the\nArizona law, if the three people on the other side are\nall participating candidates, each of them gets a bonus\nif there's only one person speaking on behalf of the\nnon-participating candidate, right?\nMR. MAURER: Yes, that's absolutely true.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. So $10,000 by\nthe non-participating candidate triggers off $30,000\nagainst him?\nMR. MAURER: That's exactly right.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. In Justice\nGinsburg's hypothetical, wouldn't you have the same\nproblem in different terms, in that one candidate faces\nthree people, all of whom are funded by the -- by the\ngovernment?\nMR. MAURER: Well, this case is not\nchallenging a public financing system, and -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm just asking as a\ntheoretical matter whether there would be a\nconstitutional problem in the case that I put under\nJustice Ginsburg's hypothetical.\nMR. MAURER: Not under Davis, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How about not under\nBuckley?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: How about under the First\nAmendment?\nMR. MAURER: There may be -- there may be\ninstances where a public financing law is so lopsided\nthat it creates a coercive effect, and Buckley was quite\nclear that one of the things that was acceptable about\nthe public financing system at issue in that case was\nthat it was voluntary.\nBut in this case, we're dealing with a very\ndifferent type of First Amendment harm. The trigger\nmatters, Your Honors. It is, in fact, determinative.\nIt is exactly the same kind of trigger -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that the point\nof Buckley was that the public funding, which you can\naccept or reject, the justification for it was that it\nincreased rather than decreased speech. And the -- I\nthink you were quite right in recognizing that matching\nfunds, this Court has said, do not conflict with the -\nwith the First Amendment.\nMR. MAURER: Your Honor, if I -- if I had\nsaid that, I was mistaken.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Not matching funds.\nPublic funding.\nMR. MAURER: Oh, okay.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Public funding. And so\nif it turns out that the States -- public funding isn't\nbeing used because -- because the limits are low, and\nyet the, the State wants to conserve the public fisc.\nSo instead of just increasing the amount at the outset,\nit says the -- the -- the object is the same, but we're\neconomizing by not giving it out in one lump sum, we're\ngiving it out in installments.\nMR. MAURER: Your Honor, in Riley v.\nNational Federation of the Blind, this Court recognized\nthat -- that the government cannot sacrifice speech for\nefficiency, and what -- if -- if we accept the holding\nof Davis v. FEC and accept that that is still a holding\nthat is viable under the First Amendment, then what\nthe -- the position of the Respondents is, is that they,\nin fact, can sacrifice free speech in order to be more\nefficient, but -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can you -- can you tell me\non that, because I take it you agree with Justice\nGinsburg about Buckley. In Buckley the Court says,\npublic financing is a means of eliminating the improper\ninfluence of large private corporations, furthers a\nsignificant government interest.\nWe both agree that's what it says?\nMR. MAURER: Yes, that's what Buckley says,\nYour Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I take it that's what it\nmeans. All right.\nNow, your objection is how much do they pay.\nMR. MAURER: No.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Here they have a trigger,\nnot -- not quantitatively. But here they say it's okay\nto finance a public candidate publicly, okay to do that.\nNow, what we're going to do is give them a million\ndollars to start with, up to $3 million to spend,\ndepending on how much their opponents spend. Now, you\nthink that's unconstitutional?\nMy question to you is, what would be a\nconstitutional system in your opinion?\nMR. MAURER: Your Honor -\nJUSTICE BREYER: That would be helpful.\nMR. MAURER: Your Honor, in Buckley this\nCourt recognized -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm not interested in\nBuckley. I'm interested in your opinion. You object to\nthe amount being paid in installments. What, in your\nopinion, would be a constitutional system? I don't need\nto repeat my question, which I just did, but I want that\nanswer, your answer to that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I assume your opinion can\nbe based upon Buckley, however.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. MAURER: Yes, the presidential financing\nsystem is constitutional, Your Honor. And I would\nalso -- I would also respectfully disagree with your\ncharacterization that the -- the nature of our objection\nhas to do with the fact that our opponents are receiving\nmoney.\nThe problem here is not that our -- the\nopponents of my clients are receiving money. It's what\ntriggers that, and what triggers that is my exercise of\nmy free speech rights.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Would there be anything\nunconstitutional about a system that worked roughly like\nthis? At the beginning -- at some point prior to each\nelection cycle, the commission that supervises this law\nwould make a calculation about how much money would be\nneeded for a candidate in a gubernatorial race or a\nState senate race or an assembly race, if that's what\nit's called in Arizona, to get that candidate's message\nout to the electorate, and that would be the amount of\nthe public funding, period.\nMR. MAURER: That would be a constitutional\nsystem, Your Honor. There is no constitutional\nobjection or at least we're not raising any\nconstitutional objection to the idea that there is a -\nthat public financing means that people can't run\neffective races. You can have a public financing system\nwith sufficient funds to run an effective race. But\nwhat you cannot do is exactly what Arizona has done,\nwhich is turn my act of speaking into the vehicle by\nwhich my political opponents benefit.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But that's interesting,\nMr. Maurer, because I don't see all that much of a\ndifference between Justice Alito's hypothetical and the\nfacts here. In other words, you said that Justice\nAlito's hypothetical would be constitutional, even\nthough under Justice Alito's hypothetical the State is\ntrying to figure out how much money it takes to run a\ncompetitive race and giving people who enter the public\nfinancing system that amount of money. That's exactly\nwhat the State is doing here, but it's doing it in\nactually a more accurate way.\nSo if Justice Alito's hypothetical is\nconstitutional, why isn't this? They're both trying to\ndo the same thing, which is to put sufficient money in\nthe hands of people who enter the public financing\nsystem in order to run a competitive race.\nMR. MAURER: Your Honor, one of the things\nthat would distinguish that is that it -- Justice\nAlito's hypothetical completely divorces the amount of\nthe grant from my political activity or the political\nactivity of people who don't want to or cannot take\npublic funds in Arizona.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I think, to the\ncontrary, in Justice Alito's hypothetical, just the\nState is estimating how much a person will spend. Here\nthe State is measuring how much a person will spend.\nThe only difference is that one is more accurate than\nthe other.\nMR. MAURER: Your Honor, I believe the\ndistinction would lie in the fact that the purpose of\nthis law is not to provide necessarily the ability of\ncandidates to run effective publicly financed campaigns.\nThe purpose of this law is to limit spending in\nelections and to level the playing field. Justice\nAlito's hypothetical -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I think the purpose of this\nlaw is to prevent corruption. That's what the purpose\nof all public financing systems are.\nMR. MAURER: Your Honor, I would\nrespectfully disagree that the purpose of this law is to\nprevent corruption, and I would like to read from the\nexecutive director of the Clean Elections Commission who\nsaid that: \"It cannot be disputed that the purpose of\nthe Clean Elections Act is to equalize the playing field\nand to give participating candidates equal opportunity\nto get their message out,\" which is at Joint Appendix\n236.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Maurer, some\npeople may use certain buzz words and other people don't\nuse those buzz words, but isn't it true that for 40\nyears what public financing systems have been based upon\nis the idea that when there is a lot of private money\nfloating around the political system, that candidates\nand then public office holders get beholden to various\npeople who are giving that money and make actions based\non how much they receive from those people, and that's\nthe idea of a public financing system is to try to\nprevent that?\nMR. MAURER: Well, that is the basis of\npublic financing systems in general, but this system\ndoes not actually address that because this Court -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We have the contrary argue\nhere. I'm sure that in some of the public financing\ncases that we've heard argued, it was asserted that the\npurpose was to level the playing field, and that that\nwas an entirely valid purpose. I'm unaware that all\npublic financing laws have had as their purpose simply\nto avoid corruption.\nMR. MAURER: Your Honor, it -- when this law\nwas promoted, when it was drafted, when it was\npropagated and -- and -- and campaigned about to the\npeople of the State of Arizona, it was presented as\ndoing two things: Leveling the playing field and\nlimiting spending in campaigns.\nIt wasn't until this Court's decision in -\nin Davis that the State of Arizona suddenly discovered\nthat the purpose of the law was actually to fight\ncorruption or the primary purpose was to actually fight\ncorruption.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about all the\nbackground, there had been a number of scandals in\nArizona, there had been vote buying? I thought that\nthat was part of the origin of this law, was not as you\nnow say had nothing to do with corruption. I thought it\nemerged out of that, those startling incidents of people\nactually selling their votes.\nMR. MAURER: Well, they were selling their\nvotes for outright bribes, Your Honor. They weren't\nselling them for campaign contributions. And if this\nlaw was aimed at the single narrow exception that this\nCourt recognized to the -- to the general principle that\nrestrictions on political activity violate the First\nAmendment, then they would not have structured this law\nin the way that they did, which is to burden the speech\nof three political speakers that pose no threat of\ncorruption under this Court's precedents. It's -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, you keep -\nI -- I just want to understand exactly what you claim\nthe burden is, because I thought that what the circuit\nand the courts below said was that there was no evidence\nthat any candidate actually didn't speak or didn't fund\nraise because of this law. There's some claims to the\ncontrary in your briefs before us, but I've looked for\nthat below, and there doesn't appear to be any record of\nthat.\nSo, I'm going to start from that -- that\nassumption, that there was no evidence in the courts\nbelow that any candidate stopped speaking because of or\nstopped collecting money because of this. So exactly\nwhat is the burden otherwise? What are you claiming the\nburden is? The burden is that the -- that the\ngovernment is choosing to give someone else money?\nMR. MAURER: No, Your Honor. First, I would\nrespectfully disagree with the characterization of the\nNinth Circuit of the evidence produced at the district\ncourt. There was considerable evidence of people not\nmaking expenditures, of slowing their fund-raising,\nas -- as one of my clients put it, to a crawl in order\nto avoid triggering matching funds. But even if that\nwere relevant, the -- or even if that -- that material\ndid not exist, in Davis this Court recognized that the\ninherent structure of the Act constitutes a substantial\nburden on speech because it presents the choice of\nhaving to either engage -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- I want to go, not\nrely on Davis, but just articulate for me, assuming my\nhypothetical, the burden is that you have to delay\nfund-raising or delay expenditures because you're\nchoosing to do so.\nMR. MAURER: We are not choosing to do so.\nWe're -- we are being coerced into do -- doing so by the\ngovernment.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, if you spend it -\nif you spend it at the time you want to, you collect it\nat the time you want, no one's -- the law's not telling\nyou not to do it. You find it an advantage not to do\nit, correct?\nMR. MAURER: No.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because your opponent\nwon't speak as loud and won't respond, correct?\nMR. MAURER: I -- I would respectfully\ndisagree, Your Honor. What the harm in delaying your\nspeech is that in order to minimize the -- the\ntriggering of substantial, and I would -- I would also\nadd unfair benefits to a publicly financed candidate\nbased on one's act of unfettered political expression,\ncandidates and independent expenditure groups all\ntestified, all the Petitioners testified that they\ndelayed speaking in order to minimize the effect of\nmatching funds, and the -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Suppose the -- suppose the\nCourt after this argument sent you a letter saying if\nyou would like to file an additional brief, you have the\nopportunity to do so, and we're not going to allow your\nopponent to file a brief. Would you take advantage of\nthat opportunity?\nMR. MAURER: All thing -- all else things\nbeing equal, yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Now, if we said you can file\nan extra brief, but if you do that your opponent will\nalso be able to file an extra brief. Would that figure\nin your thinking?\nMR. MAURER: It certainly would, Your Honor;\nand under Arizona's system, if you applied Arizona's\nsystem to this hypothetical, not only would Mr. Phillips\nbe able to file an additional brief, but the State of\nArizona would be able to file an additional brief, and\nthe Solicitor General's office would be able to file an\nadditional brief, and anyone who weighed in on the other\nside would be able to file an additional brief.\nThat's the very nature of this law, in that\nit creates -- it is entirely structured to create\ndisincentives, as the proponents of this act were quite\nclear, it was to create disincentives on people speaking\nor engaging in political activity more than the\ngovernment preferred.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you think it would be a\nfair characterization of this law to say that its\npurpose and its effect are to produce less speech in\npolitical campaigns?\nMR. MAURER: I believe that that is a -- a\ngoal, and I believe that's the effect. The entire -\nthe entire motivation of this law was to limit the -\nlimit spending in leveling the playing field. Limiting\nspending indicates that they wanted less political\nspeech in the State of Arizona, and that's what they've\ngot.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Do you think that if Joe\nSmith doesn't have much money, takes public finance at\nall, that that could discourage some other people, Brown\nand Johnson, from running?\nMR. MAURER: No, I don't believe so.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, there's not -- it's not\ngoing to -- it's not going to be a situation where\ngovernment paying a million dollars to Smith to help him\nin the campaign would discourage some other person from\nrunning?\nMR. MAURER: I don't believe so, Your Honor.\nIt -- it's not -\nJUSTICE BREYER: If we -- if we say, you can\nfile a brief and if you do, other people can file, is\nthat my -- forget the briefs. It's too farfetched.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's very clear, however.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: I did -- I did think you\nwould give the other answer, to tell you the truth,\nbecause I just don't see why giving somebody a million\ndollars might not discourage a -- a poorer candidate\nfrom running.\nMR. MAURER: Well, Your Honor, the courts\nthat have looked at public financing systems, including\nthe Buckley court, noticed or were made clear that one\nof the things that constitutes a constitutional public\nfinancing system is its voluntariness. At certain\nmargins -\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. Joe, the guy who\nwants it, it's voluntary for him; but his opponents\ncan't do anything about that.\nI'm just saying Joe takes the money, so\nBrown and Smith say: Oh my God, he has a million\ndollars, forget it. I'll stay home. I won't run.\nMR. MAURER: Well -\nJUSTICE BREYER: And you say that just\ndoesn't happen?\nMR. MAURER: I -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Never happens? Okay.\nMR. MAURER: I -\nJUSTICE BREYER: And I gather that people\nwho have looked into the Arizona scheme also say what\nyou think will happen never happens, either.\nMR. MAURER: Your -- Your Honor -\nJUSTICE BREYER: So should we look at both\ninstances?\nMR. MAURER: Your Honor, it's not the\nquestion of people being dissuaded from running because\ntheir opponent may be able to mount an effective\ncampaign. The issue is the government turning my speech\ninto the vehicle by which my entire political message is\nundercut.\nAnd if there are no further questions, I would\nlike to reserve the remainder of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Phillips.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF BRADLEY S. PHILLIPS\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. PHILLIPS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nPublic funding of elections results in more\nspeech and more electoral competition and directly\nfurthers the government's compelling interest in\ncombatting real and apparent corruption in politics.\nThere was a suggestion in response, I believe, to\nJustice Kagan's question that this law was not intended\nto combat corruption, but I -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But counsel, how -\nthe supposition that it results in more speech, let's\ntake the independent expenditure example. You've got\none candidate running against three others. There's an\nindependent expenditure on behalf of the one candidate.\nThat means, say $10,000. That means each of the other\nthree get $10,000 of their own. Now, that might promote\nmore speech, but the effect may well be for the\nindependent expenditure to say, I'm not going to spend\nthe money, and so the other candidates don't get the\nmoney and you have less speech.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, Your Honor, it would\nresult in more speech certainly if all the candidates\ngot the $10,000. There's no evidence in the record of\nanyone actually not spending, any independent group not\nspending money either in that circumstance or any other\ncircumstance.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How would you -\nwhat would that evidence look like?\nMR. PHILLIPS: The evidence would -- would\nsimply look -- plausibly, even just someone saying that\nthey didn't spend money because of that, although that\nwould be not very hard evidence. But there isn't even\nthat sort of evidence with respect to independent groups\nhere, Your Honor. And it makes sense, Your Honor -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, other than\nsomebody saying it, I'm just curious what the evidence\nwould look like. You're -- it's -- you're proving a\nnegative. You're saying, well, this person didn't do\nsomething because of this, and that's pretty hard to do.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I -- that's possibly true,\nYour Honor. The statistical data, however, here\nindicates that individual expenditures have in fact gone\nup since the implementation of matching funds in\nArizona. That obviously doesn't directly address the\nthree-candidate situation, I acknowledge that. But\nthere's no evidence that independent expenditures have\nbeen suppressed at all, Your Honor. And I would -- I\nthink the question here, Your Honor, is -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: May I ask how it -- how it\ncombats corruption unless it suppresses large\ncontributions -\nMR. PHILLIPS: It combats -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- by certain entities? I\nmean, I can understand you say, well, it will stop big\ndonors from giving $10 million to somebody's campaign\nand having that person in his pocket. But that -- that\ndonor is still going to have that -- that senator or\nwhoever it is just as much indebted to him if he gives\n$10 million, regardless of whether everybody else gets\n$10 million as well.\nHow does it -- how does it combat corruption\nunless -- unless the other side is correct that its\nwhole purpose is to suppress the contribution of $10\nmillion, to make it unworthwhile for anybody to give $10\nmillion?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Your Honor, Arizona's\ntriggered matching funds provision combats corruption in\nthe same manner that public funding combats corruption,\nbecause that -- the law is designed to encourage\ncandidates to accept public funding because it offers a\nviable public funding option to them while conserving\nthe State's resources. And public funding serves the\nanticorruption rationale in two fundamental ways.\nFirst, it frees the candidates who accept public funding\nfrom the need to accept potentially corrupting private\ncontributions.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, there are States that\nhave public funding without having a matching fund\nprovision. I would appreciate it if you would compare\nthese two regimes. The first is exactly what Arizona\nhas now. The second is exactly what Arizona has now\nminus the matching fund provision. So under the second\none you have very strict contribution limits, and you\nhave reporting of all contributions. Now, why does the\naddition of the matching fund provision serve an\nanticorruption interest?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, Your Honor, I think for\nthe same reasons I think that are implicit in the\nBuckley Court's upholding of public funding at the same\ntime that the Court upheld contribution limits and\ndisclosure requirements, I think implicitly therefore\nholding that the three could go together, serving the\nanticorruption interests. And I think it does that,\nfirst, by, first by -- first by freeing, as I said,\nfreeing the publicly funded candidates from the need\neven to take the limited privately -- private\ncontributions that would be allowed under the law, and\nwhich this Court has never held there's a minimum at\nwhich that no longer conceivably becomes corrupting.\nBut secondly, it -- it combats corruption by\nproviding for more candidates running, more political\nspeech, and more electoral competition, all of which\nhave happened in Arizona. And where you have more\ncandidates and more electoral competition, you have less\n-- you are going to have less corruption. The record -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- so the idea is\nthis is a way of encouraging candidates to take the\npublic financing, right?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would it encourage\nmore candidates to do that if you doubled the amount\nthat was available for every additional amount that the\nprivately financed candidate spends? He spends $1,000\nover the amount and the publicly financed candidate gets\n$2,000. A lot more people are going to do the publicly\nfinancing route if that were the case.\nMR. PHILLIPS: It would encourage them more,\nYour Honor. It's not our contention that anything that\na State or Congress did to encourage public funding\nwould necessarily be constitutional. I think the\nquestion would be different if it were a two to one or,\nto make a more stark contrast, a ten to one match. I\nthink that would raise multiple questions.\nOne question would be, looking at the\nstatute in its entirety, has the public funding scheme\nbecome coercive rather than voluntary? It would raise\nthe question whether the purpose of the law were really\nto simply provide viable funding to candidates -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's kind of\nan odd line to find in the First Amendment, isn't it?\nThat you get a 100 percent matching as opposed to, say,\n110 percent or 150 percent? Somewhere in the First\nAmendment the line is drawn on the amount?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I think somewhere in the\nFirst Amendment there is a line, Your Honor, implicit in\nBuckley, where a public funding law provides such\nsubstantial benefits without sufficient countervailing\nburdens to publicly funded candidates that it becomes\ncoercive rather than voluntary, and therefore you have\ncoerced someone into accepting a spending limit, which I\nbelieve would be certainly subject to strict scrutiny\nand almost surely unconstitutional. And I think that is\n-- the Court would need to assess that in each instance,\nand I think it could be done. I certainly don't think\nthat here you have a coercive system. A third of the\ncandidates don't accept public funding, and most of\nthose who don't and accept -- and face publicly funded\ncandidates actually win.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it doesn't work?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Certainly it doesn't work in\nthe sense, Your Honor, if the goal were for everyone to\naccept public funding, it doesn't work in that sense.\nBut it certainly works in the sense that two-thirds of\nthe candidates do, and it works in the sense that there\nhasn't been a repeat of the public corruption scandals\nin Arizona since the law was passed.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you think that one\nreason for people to decline participation in the\nprogram is because they do not want to deter independent\nexpenditures? And let me -- we'll talk about\nindependent expenditures for just a few minutes if you\ndon't mind. You indicated independent expenditure has\ngone up. I thought there was some data in the record\nthat showed the population has gone up and so there's an\nargument about that. But just as a common sense matter,\nif I'm someone with the capacity and the will to make an\nindependent expenditure, why don't I think twice if this\nis going to generate an equal amount on the other side,\nwhich might be better spent. Sometimes an independent\nexpenditure is not really that effective, it's in a bad\nmarket, it's a bad message. But this results in cash to\nthe participating candidate, who then can use it in the\nmost effective way.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Your Honor, independent -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: All of which is designed\nto probe this idea that this somehow does not deter\nindependent expenditures. I frankly am tempted to\nbelieve the opposite view, so you can tell me about\nthat.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, Your Honor, independent\nexpenditure groups -- there's no evidence that it really\nin fact has been deterred. Your Honor, independent\nexpenditure groups essentially have to take their\ncandidates as they find them, if they will. There's no\ndiscrimination among someone who is speaking in favor of\na privately financed candidate and one who is speaking\nin favor of a participating candidate.\nThe different treatment is the different\ntreatment of the candidates. Someone who speaks against\na privately financed candidate runs the risk that that\nperson is going to use the ad against them to do all of\nthe things that the public financed candidate may not\ndo. He can raise private contributions, he can take\nmoney from his political party, he can spend his own\nmoney and he can spend unlimited amounts of money.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know how you can\nsay that there's no evidence that it's been deterred.\nIs something true just because you say it? There are in\nthe briefs statistical evidence of how much the\npopulation of Arizona has increased and how much less\nsince the enactment of this law the total expenditures\nhave increased.\nThere was testimony in the, in the district\ncourt from individuals who said that they withheld their\ncontributions because of this. It's -- it's obvious\nstatistically also that many of the expenditures were\nmade late in the game, where perhaps they were not as\neffective, in order to be unable to trigger the matching\nfunds in time for the opposing candidate to do anything\nabout it. I do not understand how you can say that\nthere is no evidence. I mean, maybe you might say I do\nnot find the evidence persuasive, but don't tell me\nthere's no evidence.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Maybe I should say there's no\nsignificant evidence, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Ah.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But with respect to each of\nthe items that you mentioned: With respect to the\npopulation point, Your Honor, there is no evidence in\nthe record and it does not make sense that expenditures\neither by candidates or by independent groups would\nincrease proportionally to the population of a State\nbecause most of the expenses of a campaign are fixed and\n-\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Rhode Island -\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- and not variable.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- has the same\nexpenditures as New York State?\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, no, Your Honor. Of\ncourse not.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't expect the two to\nhave any relationship?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Of course not, Your Honor. I\ndon't suggest that there's no relationship between\npopulation and expenditures, but you wouldn't expect it\nto go up proportionally, which is what the argument that\nthe Petitioners make, is that it didn't go up\nproportionally. You wouldn't expect that, particularly\ngiven what the demographics of the population increase\nhave been in Arizona and elsewhere in the country.\nWith respect to the evidence of individuals,\nthere are two Petitioner independent committees in this\ncase, Your Honor, the Arizona Taxpayers Action Committee\nand the Arizona Free Enterprise Club. At Joint Appendix\n584 is the testimony of the first that they never\nwithheld money from a race because of matching funds and\ncan't recall any contributor to them doing so. And the\nArizona Free Enterprise Club at Joint Appendix 666 and\n670, the treasurer testified that matching funds never\ncaused them not to make a contribution and that the PAC\nto which they contribute at JA 670 didn't recall making\na decision not to spend money because of matching funds\nwith respect to -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: On that, there's a\nback and forth about the record and common sense. As a\nmatter of common sense -- I think this has already been\nasked -- if you knew that a $10,000 expenditure that you\nwould make that would support a candidate would result\nin $30,000, 40,000, 50,000, depending on how many\nopposition candidates there were available for them,\nwouldn't you think twice about it?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I might think twice about it,\nYour Honor. But first, I think thinking twice is not a\nsevere burden. I think I might think twice in some\ncircumstances if I knew that by spending a certain\namount of money I had to disclose the fact that I was\ndoing that and what my political views were and lose my\nanonymity, but thinking twice this Court has held in\nthat circumstance doesn't create a severe burden, and we\nwould submit that thinking twice here similarly does\nnot.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if you're\nthinking twice and one way you're thinking is not to do\nit, that sounds like a sufficient burden.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, Your Honor, if it were\na sufficient burden, it would presumably have been a\nsufficient burden with respect to disclosure, where this\nCourt has recognized that some people may not spend or\ncontribute because of the disclosure requirements.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Our cases, as you\nknow, have drawn a distinction between expression and\ndisclosure.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes. Yes, Your Honor, but\nthe point I'm making is that the disclosure, this Court\nhas recognized, potentially chills, deters the\nexpression itself.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Are you saying that\nanything that has to be disclosed can also be\nprohibited? I mean, I just don't see the equivalence\nhere.\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, Your Honor, I wasn't\nsuggesting that. But I -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me that this\nlaw has a severe criticisms leveled at it, severe legal\ninvalidities alleged, quite without reference to\ndisclosure.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, Your Honor, I was\nmaking the analogy to disclosure in the sense of the\nthink-twice notion that Mr. Chief Justice raised, but I\ndon't think -- I don't think this creates any more of a\nburden, indeed we would submit less of a burden, than a\ndisclosure requirement. You would expect somebody who\nbelieves that their speech is more persuasive than the\nother participants in the race, whether they be an\nindependent group or a candidate, to choose more speech,\nbecause they think that, if I speak, even if the other\npeople speak, my message is going to get out there and\nit's going to be preferable.\nThere may be some few candidates, although\nthere's not a record of that here, some few groups or\ncandidates who would decide that they would prefer less\nspeech. It's better for me if my opponent or the other\ncandidate doesn't speak more because he's going to be\nmore persuasive than I am.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your focus on\npersuasiveness -- your focus on persuasiveness is a\nparticular view of the political process that may not be\napplicable in every case. Political scientists\nsometimes tell you that it's not persuasion, but simply\nplaying to your base, getting them more actively\ninvolved. So it's not the somewhat more academic view\nthat people are going to sit down and just regard which\none is persuasive. Is that a permissible objective for\nthe State to pursue, to value a particular view of the\nelectoral process over another?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, Your Honor, I don't\nthink that the State is doing that. What I'm addressing\nis the effect of the law, and I think Your Honor makes a\ngood point, which is that they assume, Petitioners\nassume, that essentially this is a zero-sum game and\nthat because if I spend $10,000 the other guy is going\nto get $10,000 to respond, that somehow that's a wash.\nWell, it's not a wash, first, because I think my speech\nis more persuasive so I'm going to do it anyway, because\nI'd rather get it out there; and secondly, because I may\nbe spending my $10,000 on getting out my voters, and I\nneed to do that regardless.\nAnd that's why you don't see in the\nstatistics any evidence that this actually suppresses\nspeech. And as I said, there may be some few candidates\nwho would opt for less speech because it's strategically\nbetter for them, but we would submit that that -\nJUSTICE ALITO: But even if it is the case\nthat those candidates who choose not to participate are\nwilling to spend additional money even though it\ntriggers matching funds, I don't see what that proves.\nA candidate who is deciding whether to participate or\nnot presumably makes a calculation at the beginning: Do\nI want to spend more than the matching fund amount, even\nthough I know that if I do that, the other side will get\nadditional money?\nNow, if they say, no, I don't -- I'm not\ngoing to do it under those circumstances, they will take\nthe public financing. And if they choose the private\nfinancing, it means they probably made a decision going\nin that they're going to -- they're going to be one of\nthose who is willing to suffer the consequences of\nspending over the amount. So I don't see what this -- I\ndon't see what that proves.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, Your Honor, I think\nwhat it proves is that you -- the key point in here is\nthat initial choice that is voluntarily made by each of\nthe candidates, whether the system of public financing\nunder which you may receive matching funds is better for\nthem or whether the system -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Could I ask z question that\ngoes back to Justice Kennedy's question, which I don't\nthink you fully had a chance to -- or fully answered?\nAnd that has to do with the independent expenditures.\nLet's say there are two candidates running\nfor governor, and one who is a participating candidate\nis taking a position on a very controversial Arizona\nissue with which I disagree, and the other is a\nnon-participating candidate who is taking a position on\nthat controversial issue and I agree with that.\nNow, if I choose to run an ad, pay for an ad\nsupporting the non-participating candidate, I know that\nthe -- the candidate that I dislike on that issue is\ngoing to get an additional amount of funds, and -- but\nif I choose to run an ad supporting the participating\ncandidate, the opposite doesn't happen. Now, why isn't\nthat a clear-cut discrimination based on the content of\nspeech?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Because, Your Honor, the\ndiscrimination, if you want to -- if you call it\ndiscrimination or different treatment, is based on the\ninitial choices of the candidates as to how they're\ngoing to finance their campaigns. It's not based on the\ncontent of the speech.\nThere's -- matching funds do not turn in any\nway on the ideas or the messages or the viewpoints or\nthe subject matter of the candidate or the independent\ngroup's speech or on the identity of the speaker. It\nturns entirely on what choice the candidate made at the\noutset.\nAnd it is analogous, in a sense, Your Honor,\nto the situation that's faced by a contributor who is\ndeciding whether to contribute, for example, to a\n501(c)(3) or a 501(c)(4) organization. If they\ncontribute to the organization that can lobby, they\ndon't get a tax deduction.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But if I'm the\nindependent -- if I'm the independent expenditure maker,\nI haven't made a choice at the beginning. I haven't\ndecided to participate or not participate. What I care\nabout is the issue that's being debated between these\ntwo candidates.\nMR. PHILLIPS: And -- and, Your Honor, two\npoints. You're free, of course, to run an ad that\naddresses the issue without expressly advocating for or\nagainst any candidate without triggering matching funds.\nAnd secondly, the candidates made a choice, and if\nyou're the person who is -- who supports the\nparticipating candidate, you can't make a contribution\nto that candidate, while you could to the other\ncandidate because of the choice that was made. And you\ncan be responded to, if you run an ad criticizing the\nnon-participating candidate, you can be responded to\nwith unlimited amounts of money from -- taken from a\npolitical party, the person's own money, whereas, too,\nif you attack a privately financed candidate, you would\nonly be subject to being potentially responded to with\nlimited matching funds.\nAnd it all flows from the voluntary choice\nthat is made at the outset by the candidates about which\nsystem of financing is better for them.\nAnd this is a system, the matching funds\nsystem, is a mechanism that the State uses in order to\nbe able to offer viable public funding to candidates\nwithout wasting public resources, and both the logic and\nevidence demonstrates that it is, in fact, effective,\nboth at promoting speech by encouraging candidates to\nrun and, indeed, particularly resulting in more\ncompetitive races for incumbents -- against incumbents\nin Arizona and promoting speech.\nAnd I would just like briefly to address\nJustice Alito's question about the ex ante measurement\nof the funds. Now, of course, we would submit that it's\nnot relevant because we're not in -- should not be in\nstrict scrutiny and therefore don't need to show this is\nthe least restrictive means, Your Honor.\nBut, Justice Alito, an ex ante system would\nrun substantial risks of underfunding or overfunding\nraces, and in particular -- and therefore wouldn't serve\nthe State's interest in saving money or in properly\nmeasuring -- but, in particular, would run the risk of\nhaving an incumbent who might have been in office for\nseveral terms unopposed and not having spent any money\nin those races, and now you are measuring how much his\npossibly now viable challenger will get in public\nfunding based upon some minuscule amount of money that\nthe incumbent has needed to spend.\nSo I think that that would not serve the\nState's interests in ensuring the candidates actually\nhave viable public funding.\nAnd I see my time has expired. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nPhillips.\nMr. Jay.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM M. JAY,\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. JAY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI would like to begin, if I may, with\nJustice Alito's question to Mr. Phillips about whether\nthe independent expenditure aspect of this statute is\ncontent-neutral, and I think that, looking at this in\nthe context of a multi-candidate race, which most races\nin Arizona are, is important to set the context, because\nmost races in Arizona are not one candidate against\nanother candidate.\nEvery House district in Arizona has two -\nhas two members, so every general election has at least\nfour candidates. And it simply is not the case that\nrunning an ad in support of a publicly financed\ncandidate does not trigger matching funds. It depends\nnot on what the ad says, not even on who the candidate\nis being supported, but on whether another candidate in\nthe race takes public financing. So money spent to\nsupport one publicly financed candidate may trigger\nmatching funds to another. That's not a content\ndiscrimination.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Jay -- Mr. Jay, do you\nagree with the -- the assertion of Mr. Phillips that\nthis does not favor incumbents?\nI would have thought that if I'm an\nincumbent with name recognition, I would love to be able\nto not raise any money and just -- just take the public\nfunding, knowing that if worse comes to worse and I have\nan opponent who does have a lot of independent\nexpenditures for him, I'll be able to get that money\nfree from the State. It seems to me it's very much\npro-incumbent rather than anti-incumbent.\nMR. JAY: Oh, Justice Scalia -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Which -- which one should\nexpect campaign finance restrictions to be.\nMR. JAY: Justice Scalia, I'm happy to -- to\nendorse the sentiment, because I think that the\nPetitioners' evidence in this case, the Petitioners who\nwere incumbent office holders and say that they did not\nspend money because they were -- they feared the\nresponse that would be paid for by matching funds, I\nthink their own evidence, including the declaration that\nthey put in at Joint Appendix 364, says: If I can keep\nthe spending down, me as an incumbent, I have a\ntremendous advantage. That's an Arizona legislator\ntalking to one of the -- talking to the -- to one of\ntheir experts.\nAnd that's because -- and a race that\nfeatures low dollar amounts on both sides often\nadvantages an incumbent. And that is the purpose -\nthat is the purpose of the matching funds provision, to\nallow -- to allow challengers to be competitively\nfunded. That's the purpose of the initial grant. The\nreason that -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Your answer -- your answer\ndepends upon whether you believe that this scheme will\nkeep the expenditures down, or rather, will elevate the\nexpenditures. And if you believe that it will deter\npeople from making contributions, it will keep the\nexpenditures down.\nMR. JAY: It's not -- it's not a matter of\ndeterring people from making contributions, Justice\nScalia. When there are competitive races, the matching\nfunds provision provides a formula for giving the\npublicly funded candidate as much money as the private\n-- as the privately funded candidate that they're\ncompeting with. And in most cases the incentives on\nboth sides are for more speech, for both sides to get\nout their message, run their ads, and persuade the\nvoters.\nIn some cases -- and we submit that the\nanecdotal evidence the Petitioners have submitted\ntouches on these cases -- the privately funded candidate\nmay have an incentive to keep spending down, but we\ndon't think that's true systemically under this system.\nWe think that the -- that the public financing in\ngeneral and the matching funds provision in particular\nfacilitates speech, because the only consequence of\nrunning an independent expenditure, for example, at\nmost, the consequence is that another party will get to\nrun a responsive ad, and the sum of speech will be\nincreased.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, do you\nagree that under our precedents, leveling the playing\nfield for candidates is not a legitimate State purpose?\nMR. JAY: We do, Mr. Chief Justice. That -\nthat, of course, is not what's at work here.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I checked the\nCitizens' Clean Elections Commission website this\nmorning, and it says that this act was passed to, quote,\n\"level the playing field\" when it comes to running for\noffice. Why isn't that clear evidence that it's\nunconstitutional?\nMR. JAY: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, whatever\nthe Citizens Clean Elections Commission says on its web\nsite I think isn't dispositive of what the voters of\nArizona had in mind when they passed this initiative.\nThe Court -- this Court has recognized since Buckley\nthat public financing serves a valid anticorruption\npurpose, and it does so because it eliminates the\ninfluence of private contributions on the candidates who\ntake public financing. And it -\nJUSTICE ALITO: But would you agree that the\nmatching fund provision by itself does not serve an\nanticorruption purpose?\nMR. JAY: Well, Justice Alito, the matching\nfunds provision the State of Arizona has concluded is an\nimportant way of ensuring that candidates will take\npublic financing, because it is a formula of ensuring\nthat candidates will have enough money to run\ncompetitive races without wasting the State's money\nby -- by -\nJUSTICE BREYER: And what about -- it's a\ngeneral question. Answer this if you wish. Don't if\nyou don't want to, and the same goes for your opponent.\nBut as I hear this argument, what's going through my\nmind is we are deeply into the details of a very complex\nbill. McCain-Feingold is hundreds of pages, and we\ncannot possibly test each provision which is related to\nthe others on such a test of whether it equalizes or\nincentivizes or some other thing, because the answer is\nnormally we don't know.\nAnd it is better to say it's all illegal\nthan to subject these things to death by a thousand\ncuts, because we don't know what will happen when we\nstart tinkering with one provision rather than another.\nThat thought went through my mind as I've heard this\ndiscussion. Comment or not upon it as you wish.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. JAY: I -- I will comment in this way,\nJustice Breyer. I think that it's remarkable -- I\nappreciate the opportunity, and I will take it. The\nparties in this case agree that public financing is\nitself not objectionable. The parties in this case\nagree that even a large government grant at the outset\nwhich could be used to fund responsive ads to a -- to a\nprivately financed candidate or to independent\nexpenditures, that's not problematic.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But anything that, anything\nthat makes it more attractive to take the public\nfinancing is okay?\nMR. JAY: That's not our position.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, what if -- what if\nthe State of Arizona says we're not going to give -\njust give money to the other candidates; we're going to\nsend out officers of Arizona to argue on behalf of these\nother candidates? That would be clearly banned, right?\nMR. JAY: Yes -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And would you come in and\nsay, well, it's perfectly okay because its purpose is to\nmake public funding attractive to candidates? The mere\nfact that it makes it more attractive does not answer\nthe question whether it's constitutional.\nMR. JAY: It doesn't make -- it doesn't just\nmake it more attractive, Justice Scalia. It allows\npublicly-funded candidates to run on the same footing as\nprivately-funded candidates, because they can spend\ncomparable amounts. That is the point that we're\nmaking, not that any -- not that any incentive the State\ncould dream up would be constitutional.\nBut the mere fact that there is -- that\nthere are incentives and disincentives on both sides, I\nthink doesn't suffice to answer the question. The fact,\nas Mr. Phillips pointed out, there may be disincentives\nto engage in speech when a disclosure requirement takes\neffect. Anyone who wishes to run an independent\nexpenditure under the system upheld in Buckley, anyone\nwho had spent over $100 had to disclose. And the Court\nrecognized in Buckley that it was undeniably the case\nthat public disclosure would deter some individuals.\nThe Court nonetheless didn't apply strict scrutiny\nbecause that is not the kind of severe burden that the\nFirst Amendment recognizes. The Court -\nJUSTICE ALITO: What you just said was that\nthis law aims to allow publicly financed candidates to\nrun on the same footing as privately financed\ncandidates; isn't that right?\nMR. JAY: The same dollar amount footing,\nJustice Alito. But there's a -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Right, and that's equal -\nMR. JAY: -- far different mix of benefits\nand burdens -\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- that's equal -- that's\nleveling the playing field, isn't it?\nMR. JAY: It's not, Justice Alito, because\nthere is a far different mix of benefits and burdens\nthat a publicly-financed candidate takes. There is an\nabsolute cap -- under this matching funds provision,\nthere is an absolute cap above which a publicly-financed\ncandidate cannot spend, no matter what.\nOnce a publicly-financed candidate reaches\nthat cap, which they've agreed to as a condition of\ntaking public financing, independent groups and their\nopponents can -- can raise more money, can run more ads\nagainst them, completely without limit, and you -- you\nhave to take that into consideration when you're\nconsidering what incentives and what deterrent effect\nthe matching funds provision is having.\nPublicly-funded candidates accept certain\nlimits, and one of those limits is an absolute limit on\nspending. The matching funds provision simply adjusts\nthat limit based on how much is being spent in that\nrace.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why -- why do you\nthink the elections commission then tells us its purpose\nis to level the playing field?\nMR. JAY: I can't -- I -- I don't speak for\nthe elections commission, Mr. Chief Justice, but the\nState of Arizona has said in -- in this case that the\npurpose of public financing, as indeed was the purpose\nof the presidential public financing system that this\nCourt upheld in Buckley, is to combat corruption. And\npublic financing is a recognized way of combatting\ncorruption, and giving out these matching funds is a way\nof encouraging candidates to participate.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, in your hypothetical\nof the -- of -- of a participating candidate who spends\nup to the limit, what happens if independent\nexpenditures are then made on his behalf?\nMR. JAY: Independent expenditures on his\nbehalf don't -- would trigger public matching funds to\nany other matching -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no.\nMR. JAY: To any other candidate in the\nrace.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: There's -- there's -\nthere's two participants -- there's two candidates, one\nwho's a participating and one who's not. The\nparticipating candidate spends up to his limit, he can't\nspend any more money. But then he gets a lot of\nadditional support from independent groups, correct?\nMR. JAY: In a two-person race, Justice\nKennedy -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, that could -- that\ncould happen?\nMR. JAY: It could. And the privately\nfinanced candidate, unlike the publicly financed\ncandidate who is the target of independent expenditures,\nis free to raise more money and use that -- use those\nadditional funds to respond.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But the -- but the point\nthat you made that the participating candidate is\nlimited leaves out the fact that there can be additional\nexpenditures on his behalf by independent groups?\nMR. JAY: There can be -- may I finish the\nsentence? There can be, but a candidate deciding\nwhether to participate by definition doesn't know in\nadvance whether there will be independent expenditures\non his behalf, and the matching funds provision allows\nthat candidate to know when he elects public financing\nthat he will have enough money to compete.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Jay.\nMr. Maurer, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM R. MAURER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. MAURER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nWith regard to the record evidence of an\nactual chill, I would note that the record -- if this\nCourt takes the opportunity, as it's obliged to do under\nthe Bose Corp. decision to look at the entire record,\nthe evidence is replete with examples of people not\nmaking expenditures such as Tony Bouie, who refrained\nfrom sending out mailers, making auto calls or\ndistributing information, John McComish also had a\nsimilar response, the Arizona Taxpayers Action Committee\ndid not engage in a particular campaign because it would\nhave triggered matching funds.\nBut ultimately when we get right down to it,\nthough, the question is does this create the same kind\nof burden in -- as -- as in Davis, and I could go\nthrough point by point, Mr. Phillips, and Mr. Jay's\nargument, but they're all answered by Davis.\nDavis recognized that this type of\ninterference with the -- with the voters' decision as to\nwho to elect to office and the purpose of doing that in\norder to raise the voices of those the government thinks\nis speaking too little and muffle the voices of those\nthe government think is speaking too much is completely\nillegitimate.\nThis case is determined by Davis. For\ninstance, the -- the argument that Mr. Phillips made\nthat speech has gone up in -- in Arizona is -- is undone\nby Davis, which recognizes that increases in the\naggregate of speech cannot justify restrictions on\nindividual First Amendment rights.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Maurer, Davis starts off\nby saying that if what had been triggered was not an\ninequitable contribution limit raised but instead both a\ncontribution raised for both candidates, that would have\nbeen perfectly appropriate, notwithstanding that that\nwould have put many independent funders to a real\nchoice. The independent funder says, well, I'm not\ntaking any contributions, so that's only going to help\nmy opponent. What's the difference in that case?\nMR. MAURER: I think what this Court was\nrecognizing in Davis is that when the -- when the\ngovernment relaxes restrictions on free speech, when\nthere's more freedom, that doesn't constitute a\nviolation of the First Amendment.\nThat's not what the government is doing\nhere. It's effectuating its goal of limiting spending\nin leveling the playing field by burdening and\ndisincentivizing people to engage in their First\nAmendment rights.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, as I said, the Davis\nsystem that was -- the system that was specifically\napproved in Davis would disincentivize many people, many\nindependent funders from speaking, would put that person\nto a choice of the kind that you say that your clients\nare being put to a choice, the exact same kind of\nchoice.\nMR. MAURER: It would not have the unfair\ntrigger that this system has. The entire argument here\nis not that -- that our clients have a concern with too\nmuch speech. Our concern is that their speech is\nturning into the mechanism by which their political\ngoals are undercut. So each time they speak, the more\nwork that they do, the more their opponents benefit.\nThat is -- that on its face creates a -- a -- a common\nsense disincentive to engage in more and more political\nactivity.\nIf there are no further questions, Your\nHonor, I'll thank the Court for its time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
