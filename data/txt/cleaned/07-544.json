        "content": "(11:04 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in Case 07-544, Hedgpeth versus Pulido.\nMr. Friedlander.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JEREMY FRIEDLANDER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. FRIEDLANDER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nRespondent has agreed with us that the ninth\ncircuit was wrong when it said that the error here and\nthe one in Stromberg were structural defects.\nThe remaining question is whether Respondent\ncan salvage the Stromberg rule by making it part of a\nproper harmless error test as he attempted to do.\nHis harmless error test is wrong for several\nreasons, but the Stromberg part of it was wrong for\nbasically one reason. He makes the Stromberg rule into\na rule of harmless error, and it is not even a correct\nrule of error.\nThis Court has defined \"instructional error\"\nto require not merely a mistake in instruction, but a\nreasonable likelihood that the jury misapplied the law.\nSo when Respondent says, invoking Stromberg, that to\ninstruct the jury on valid and invalid theories is\nharmless error if the jury adopted a valid theory, what\nRespondent is saying is nothing more than that no error\noccurred in the first place. Because the jury found\neverything it needed to find in order to convict and,\ntherefore, did not misapply the law.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do that again, will you?\nMR. FRIEDLANDER: We need to have a\nreasonable likelihood that the jury misapplied the law.\nThat's how we get to error. Respondent invokes\nStromberg to say if the jury is instructed a right way\nand a wrong way and they went the right way, we have\nharmless error.\nNo. What we really have is no error at all.\nBecause there is the -- the jury did not misapply the\nlaw. Moreover, Stromberg is not even a correct rule of\nerror. Because under Stromberg you have error if the\njury could have misapplied the law.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Can I interrupt you? You\nare saying no error occurred, and on page 11 of your\nbrief you say, \"An unconstitutional instructional error\noccurred in this case because there was a reasonable\nlikelihood the jury found,\" and so forth and so on.\nMR. FRIEDLANDER: Yes. I agree that error\noccurred in this case. What I'm trying to argue here is\nthat Respondent is entirely off base in importing the\nStromberg rule into a harmless error determination.\nStromberg is, at most, a rule of error. The jury went\nthe wrong way. That is a rule of error, but it is not\neven a correct rule of error because under Stromberg you\nsay, could the jury have gone the wrong way; whereas,\nunder this Court's modern precedent you have to have a\nreasonable likelihood that the jury --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But you said that's what\nhappened here. That's what your brief says.\nMR. FRIEDLANDER: Yes. I agree that there\nwas an error here but not because of Stromberg. Because\nthis was a reasonable likelihood that the jury\nmisapplied the law.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But you should have said\n\"no\" to the question, I think. Because I thought the\nquestion -- whatever it was, you are saying that there\nisn't a reasonable likelihood that its error influenced\nthe outcome. You are not saying that?\nMR. FRIEDLANDER: There is a reasonable\nlikelihood that the jury misapplied the law. That's the\nerror question.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. FRIEDLANDER: Then the harmless error\nquestion is: Given that they misapplied the law, do we\nknow under the requisite degree of certainty -- Chapman\non direct review, Brecht here -- that they would still\nhave found him guilty of felony murder under a proper\ninstruction?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do you agree that the\nCalifornia Supreme Court gave an incorrect explanation\nto the answer to that question? They said there was no\nharmless error because the -- the jury made a specific\nfinding that rebutted that, and that finding depended on\nthe difference between the word \"and\" and \"or.\"\nMR. FRIEDLANDER: I'm not sure I followed\nthe last part of the question, but I agree with you if\nwhat you are saying is that the California Supreme\nCourt, in effect, applied a Stromberg-like test. They\nsaid \"necessarily resolved.\"\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No. I'm -- I'm\nquestioning the basis for the Supreme Court's conclusion\nthat the error was harmless.\nMR. FRIEDLANDER: Their basis for the\nconclusion was the jury's \"special circumstance\"\nfinding.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Right.\nMR. FRIEDLANDER: Now, they did not\nconsider, when they made that \"special\" -- when they\ninterpreted that \"special circumstance,\" the \"and/or\"\nmistake that was embedded in the instructions.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Which meant that the jury\nreally hadn't answered the question they thought it had\nanswered.\nMR. FRIEDLANDER: No, it didn't mean that.\nWe don't agree with that. We don't believe that that is\na correct interpretation of the instruction.\nBut let me skip past that if you'll allow\nme. Even if you -- even if you accent any meaning from\nthat \"special circumstance\" finding -- and we don't\nagree with that but even if you did -- you had at a\nminimum here the nature --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If you do that, you are\nremoving the basis for the California Supreme Court's\ndecision.\nMR. FRIEDLANDER: Well --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is that not right?\nMR. FRIEDLANDER: The basis --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: At least the basis --\nMR. FRIEDLANDER: The basis for the\nCalifornia Supreme Court --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The basis --\nMR. FRIEDLANDER: I think -- I think that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- for the decision was a\n-- was a specific finding --\nMR. FRIEDLANDER: The reasoning behind the\ndecision, yes, I think that's right.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: All right.\nMR. FRIEDLANDER: Okay. But it doesn't\nmatter because we are going to apply Brecht anyway.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Could you clarify the -- the\ncategory of cases that would be affected if your\nargument is accepted? There would be -- an error would\nbe -- would not be harmless under Brecht if it had a\nsubstantial or -- or injurious effect, right?\nMR. FRIEDLANDER: True.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Now, what is the standard\nunder California law for submitting a theory of\nliability to the jury? Presumably, you have to have\nsome evidence in support of it.\nMR. FRIEDLANDER: I'm not sure I understand\nthe question. I think that goes to the question of\nwhether there is error in the first place in submitting\na factually unsupported theory.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, you are -- you are\narguing that there are instances in which, when a theory\nof liability is submitted to the jury, the error -- and\nit's erroneous -- the error can be harmless.\nMR. FRIEDLANDER: Yes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Correct? Now, what are the\n-- what is the standard under California law for\nsubmitting the theory of liability to the jury in the\nfirst place? You have to have -- presumably, there has\nto be some evidence in support of that, right? How\nmuch?\nMR. FRIEDLANDER: I don't think -- I don't\nthink I know the answer to that question. It would\ncertainly be error under California State law if there\nis a reasonable -- if they have the same reasonable\nlikelihood standard that the Federal courts have, if\nthere is a reasonable likelihood that the jury\nmisapplied the law.\nNow, in a -- but you seem to be focusing on\nan evidentiary sufficiency, and I think that's governed\nby Griffith where if you -- if you have an insufficient\n-- if you have insufficient evidence to support the\ntheory, then it's inappropriate --\nJUSTICE ALITO: What I'm asking is: When is\nthere going to be a case in which a theory of liability\nis submitted to the jury and it's -- and it's erroneous\n-- multiple theories are submitted; one erroneous. And\nyet it would turn out that the submission of the\nerroneous theory did not have a substantial or injurious\neffect.\nMR. FRIEDLANDER: This one -- this case --\nthis case was submitted to the jury on two alternative\ntheories: One of them correct, pre- killing aiding and\nabetting; one of them incorrect, post-killing aiding and\nabetting. And it didn't have a substantial injurious\neffect because we know that at an absolute minimum here\nthe jury found that the defendant acted -- aided and\nabetted robbery with reckless indifference to human life\nand was a major participant in the robbery. And those\nfindings were not compatible with post-killing aiding\nand abetting.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought there was --\nthat there was this -- there were three possibilities,\nand one was that the defendant didn't do anything\nbefore, didn't do anything during, but was simply an\naccessory after the fact.\nIf the jury believed that, then there was no\nway it could convict him of the crime that he was\nconvicted of.\nMR. FRIEDLANDER: Well, the jury rejected\naccessory after the fact but --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How do we know that? Was\nthere a special verdict?\nMR. FRIEDLANDER: They were instructed on\naccessory after the fact as the lesser offense and they\nfound in essence robbery and felony murder.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: They found the greater\noffense, so there would have been no need for them to go\nto the lesser included offense. Your trouble is -- and\nI think the problem that we are having is that in\nfinding the greater offense, they may have done so under\na theory of accomplice liability that was consistent\nwith the accomplice simply coming in at a late stage in\nthe proceedings.\nMR. FRIEDLANDER: Yes. That's right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, that's the\ndifficulty we are having.\nMR. FRIEDLANDER: Yes. There is a\nreasonable likelihood that in deciding felony murder\nthey failed to decide that he engaged in the robbery\nbefore the killing.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Right.\nMR. FRIEDLANDER: However, they went and\nfound the special circumstance in which they found\nreckless, aiding and abetting with reckless indifference\nto human life and as a major participant.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I thought the, the\ndifficulty with using that as a means of answering the\nfirst error was that the way the special circumstance\ninstruction was phrased, they could have found the\nspecial circumstance without finding anything more than\nthat he came in at a late stage.\nMR. FRIEDLANDER: No. That's not correct.\nI don't believe that's correct. It is true that part of\nthe instruction, that and/or difficulty, focused on a\ndifferent question, a different point, said that if you\n-- if they -- I'm blanking out but --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The second -- go ahead.\nMR. FRIEDLANDER: It didn't address the\nreckless indifference to human life and the major\nparticipant, but that was embedded in the instructions,\nand from the start the courts that have looked at this\nand have reached this question have all agreed that\nthere was a jury finding of reckless indifference to\nhuman life and major participant, and they have\ndisagreed as to what it might have meant. Okay? Now,\nthe U.S. district court --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How do we -- in this --\nhow do we know what the jury found? They just came in\nwith a guilty verdict; is that right?\nMR. FRIEDLANDER: No. They came in with a\nspecial circumstance finding. The special circumstance\nfinding that this was --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't the special\ncircumstance finding the one that had the word \"or\" in\nit, and therefore allowed the jury to give a post-\nkilling interpretation of the event.\nMR. FRIEDLANDER: No. The special --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I thought that was what\nthe California Supreme Court relied on?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I agree with Justice\nStevens. I thought that was the whole problem, the \"or\"\nand the \"and\" is the problem for you.\nMR. FRIEDLANDER: The -- I'll read from JA\n14. This is the special circumstance instruction that\nwas -- was mistaken: \"The murder was committed while\nthe defendant was engaged in the commission or attempted\ncommission of a robbery, or the murder was committed in\norder to carry out or advance the commission of the\ncrime of robbery, et cetera.\"\nNow, that -- that finding alone we agree if\nyou -- if you -- if you just follow that finding, that\ndoesn't implicate the defendant. But you have to read\nat JA 13, the instruction, JA 13: \"The defendant with\nreckless indifference to human life and as a major\nparticipant aided and abetted in the commission of a\nrobbery which resulted in the death of Flores.\" That's\nat JA 13.\nSo there were multiple findings here. And\n-- and the district court which -- this is at the bottom\nof the first paragraph of JA 13.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but isn't -- maybe I'm\nnot getting it. Help me out here. One possibility\nunder -- under the instruction at JA 13 is \"or assisted\nin the crime of robbery.\" And the other instructions\nbecause they are erroneous leave open the possibility of\nfinding that he assisted in the crime of robbery only if\nhe came in late. And that's why it does not solve the\noriginal error.\nMR. FRIEDLANDER: No. The -- the problem\nwith the, I think you're mixing up two things here.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I may be doing that.\nMR. FRIEDLANDER: The felony murder\ninstructions did not speak to this question of\ncontemporaneity. They left it open. That was error.\nWe acknowledge that that was error. Okay? So they\narguably find felony murder, aiding and abetting felony\nmurder based on post- killing aiding and abetting. Now,\nthe jury has to get to the special circumstance finding,\nright?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nMR. FRIEDLANDER: And now it has to decide,\namong other things, as I -- as I read to you, \"did he\naid and abet robbery with reckless indifference to human\nlife and as a major participant in the commission of a\nrobbery which resulted in the death of Flores?\" That's\nat JA 13. So what we --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Where does it say that he\nmust have assisted prior to --\nMR. FRIEDLANDER: It doesn't. It doesn't\nsay that.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then that doesn't cure the\nerror.\nMR. FRIEDLANDER: Yes, it does, and the\nreason that it does is because the harmless error test\nis not whether the jury actually made the finding that\nit needed to make; rather, the harmless error test is do\nwe know from the evidence and from the findings that the\njury would have made the findings that it was required\nto make had it been properly instructed?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It seems to me that\nyou're arguing one of two things: First, that there was\nno error at all under Stromberg; or second, that if\nthere was error, it was harmless error. And I thought\nthe case was about whether or not the Ninth Circuit\nerred in concluding that harmless error analysis didn't\napply to a Stromberg error.\nMR. FRIEDLANDER: Yes. I'm not arguing the\nfirst point. I -- I concede there was error. I just\nwanted to make the point that Stromberg itself is an\nincorrect rule of error. But I can see that that's led\nus down a path that I didn't need to go down.\nNow, we are certainly arguing harmless\nerror. As for the Ninth Circuit's opinion, we said --\nthe Ninth Circuit said this is structural error. We\ndon't even start a harmless error analysis.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The district court didn't\nsay that.\nMR. FRIEDLANDER: No, it did not. And --\nand we said that's wrong. This is trial error, not\nstructural error.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So if we were to say,\nNinth Circuit, you were wrong, but the district court\nwas right --\nMR. FRIEDLANDER: Well, the district court\nwas right to the extent that it found it to be trial\nerror. It was wrong to the extent that it found it to\nbe prejudicial trial error. But Respondent has agreed\nwith us that this is not structural error, that we need\nto do a harmless error analysis, and what Respondent has\ndone is import into this harmless error analysis we are\nsaying the Stromberg rule; and it doesn't belong there.\nThe Stromberg rule is not a proper rule of\nharmless error. It's at most a rule of error. I'd\nlike --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But do you not agree that\nthe harmless error -- the -- the rationale of the\nCalifornia Supreme Court was incorrect?\nMR. FRIEDLANDER: Was the rationale\nincorrect? If --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: In the harmless error\nanalysis. Actually, I'm agreeing with you that there\nshould have been harmless error. Did it perform the\nproper --\nMR. FRIEDLANDER: It's incorrect in the way\nthat you're thinking it is incorrect, but it was also\nincorrect in another way. It was incorrect in a way\nthat it applied too strict a standard. It said has this\nquestion been necessarily been resolved; and it said\nyes, it has been necessarily resolved. Well, that's not\nthe question. The harmless error question --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The -- answer was\nincorrect, too, wasn't it? And that answer was\nincorrect?\nMR. FRIEDLANDER: That answer was incorrect;\nand as well as what you're thinking, it was incorrect,\nin that they premised it on a factual basis that was not\nin fact the case. But I better reserve time for\nrebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Shah.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PRATIK A. SHAH\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. SHAH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI think the Chief Justice framed the main\nissue in this case properly. Consistent with the last\ntwo decades of this Court's instructional error\njurisprudence, the Court should hold that the type of\nerror at issue is not structural and is subject to\nharmless error review.\nThe Ninth Circuit's contrary interpretation\nof Stromberg creates the untenable result that adding an\ninvalid theory -- adding a valid theory to an invalid\none somehow makes the error worse. Even Respondent now\nrejects that interpretation. It follows that this Court\nshould reverse the Ninth Circuit and remand for\napplication of harmless error review under Brecht.\nThe main issue --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's what the district\njudge did, right?\nMR. SHAH: Yes, Your Honor. The district\ncourt did apply harmless error review under Brecht. The\ncourt of appeals, of course, did not.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It could just review the\ndistrict court's decision using the standards that the\ndistrict court used?\nMR. SHAH: This Court could do that, but the\nlongstanding and customary practice of this Court is\nthat when the court of appeals does not address the\nharmless error question, that it remands to that court.\nIt did that in Rose V. Clark, in Pope V. Illinois and\nCalifornia V. Roy, and more recently in Recuenco.\nAnd in several of those cases the\nintermediate court or the district court, in the habeas\ncontext, did address it and the court of appeals didn't\nin all of those cases that the Court did remand for\napplication of harmless error.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I wasn't questioning\nthat. The issue, is the United States position say\nstructural error was wrong, harmless error was right,\nand then just have the Ninth Circuit review the district\ncourt's decision that held that there was harmless error\nthe way it would ordinarily review a district court\ndecision?\nMR. SHAH: Yes, Your Honor, but I would add\nthat this Court should also clarify the scope of that\nharmless error inquiry. I think there are two important\nprinciples. There is no logical reason to apply a\nnarrower form of harmless error review in this case than\nthe Court did in Neder.\nSo I think that this Court should clarify\nthat the principles of harmlessness articulated in Neder\nshould apply on remand to the Ninth Circuit. I think\nthose of those principles bear mention.\nFirst, the question is not what the jury\nactually or necessarily found, but rather, it\nencompasses what a rationale jury would have found\nabsent the error.\nAnd I think the second important point for\nthis Court to clarify is that harmlessness review is not\nlimited to cases, is not limited to cases where the\nrelevant elements are undisputed, but rather even when\ndisputed, a reviewing court should consider the entire\nrecord and determine whether, in light of the jury\nfinding, there is sufficient evidence to support a\ncontrary verdict. And then it should remand, Your\nHonor, to the court of appeals to apply those\nprinciples.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why do you say in light of\nthe jury finding when you have disavowed any necessity\nthat the jury had found this?\nMR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, we do --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean \"in light of the\njury finding,\" why don't you just drop that.\nMR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, we think it's\nimportant because there are certain jury findings that\nwe know the jury made in this case. The jury returned a\nspecial circumstance verdict. And we know based upon\nthat verdict that at a minimum, the jury found that\nRespondent was a major participant in the crime -- just\ntaking the facts of this case, the Respondent was a\nmajor participant in the robbery, that he exhibited a\nreckless disregard for human life.\nAnd we also know that the jury rejected a\nduress defense. The jury was instructed on that\ndefense, and yet the jury came back guilty.\nSo I don't think that the -- that the\ninquiry should take place in a vacuum, but, of course,\nthe reviewing court should have the benefit of the\nlimited jury findings that we do know were made, and\nthen apply the sufficiency inquiry in light of those\njury findings. There is no reason to disregard the jury\nfindings that were made.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Suppose it's not, in\nthe abstract anyway, necessarily true that this case\nfollows a fortiori, because here, at least you have a\nvalid theory. That may make it a harder case, because\nthe jury had based its entire verdict on an invalid\ntheory.\nIt may be more difficult than a situation\nwhere you've got a theory of the case that is invalid\nbecause a particular element is missing. And you can\nlook and see whether or not that was harmless or not.\nMR. SHAH: I would disagree, Mr. Chief\nJustice. I think there are two possibilities in a case\nwith alternative theories. One possibility is that the\njury relies upon the defective instruction. For\nexample, there is one element omitted just like the\ninstruction in Neder. If that's what the jury had done,\nthen this case is no different than Neder, no better, no\nworse, right.\nThe other possibility, however, is that the\njury relies on the completely valid theory. If the jury\nrelied on the completely valid theory, then there is\neven less of a problem than Neder. There is no problem\nat all.\nSo I don't see how the error in this\nalternative valid theory and defense theory circumstance\ncould be any --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The difference is when you\nonly got one theory, you know what he relied on. When\nyou got alternatives, how do you know which one he\nrelied on?\nMR. SHAH: Well, you don't -- you don't,\nYour Honor. And that's what the reviewing court has to\ndecide. But in either scenario, if it -- if you assume\nthat the jury relied on the defective theory, then we\nare in the same box as in Neder, and the reviewing court\nwould decide whether there was -- you know, they would\napply the harmless error review to the missing element\nand decide whether there was sufficient evidence to\nrender that error harmless; or the court could ask,\nwell, is that uncontraverted or overwhelming evidence\nthat the defendant would have been found guilty under\nthe valid theory.\nAnd that would also be a permissible\ninquiry.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I guess,\nthough, the point is when you have invalid and valid\ntheories, it would be a little harder than Neder,\nbecause they don't have to make any findings under the\nvalid theory. You know, because you don't just have to\nfill in a missing piece of the puzzle, as in Neder. You\nhave to -- they might have been working on an entirely\ndifferent puzzle.\nMR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, in almost all\nconceivable cases there is going to be at least some\noverlap between -- between the two theories. And what\nthe -- the reason why that's relevant is because you\nknow that when the jury has returned a general verdict\nof guilt, they have necessarily found beyond a\nreasonable doubt that each of those elements has been\nsatisfied.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No. But in this case the\nquestion is whether the uncle did it or the nephew did\nit. And if there is a lot of doubt about -- about -- if\nthere is substantial reason to believe maybe it was the\nuncle, they might have taken the easy case out. I think\nthis is vastly different from a single theory case.\nMR. SHAH: Well, Your honor, here's why --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Because it's an -- there\nis plenty of evidence that he might have been guilty\nafter the fact. There is no doubt about that. But\nthere is doubt about the former.\nMR. SHAH: Your Honor, here's why I think\nthe cases aren't that different, because, you know, at a\nminimum from the general verdict of guilt if you take a\ncase like this, you know that the jury found that there\nwas an unlawful killing. You know that the jury found\nthat there was a robbery. You know that the jury found\nthat Respondent was involved in the robbery. The only\nelement that we don't know --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Perhaps after -- after the\ndeath occurred. That's all we really know.\nMR. SHAH: It is possible that the jury\nwould have found that, and that's the question that the\nreviewing court would perform in harmless error review,\njust like if there -- basically that is the exact same\nquestion the Court would form, would do under Neder if\nthe timing element were omitted all together. The\nreviewing court would look at the evidence and decide is\nthere sufficient evidence to support an after-the-fact\nparticipation.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So what we are\ntalking about, in other words, is the application of\nharmless error, which may or may not be harder in the\nmultiple theory case, and not the question of whether\nharmless error analysis should be applied.\nMR. SHAH: Yes, Your Honor. That's going to\nbe completely fact dependent whether it's harder or not.\nBut I think analytically it's exactly the same as in\nNeder.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Aren't there going to be\ncases in which there's enough evidence to support the\nsubmission of a theory of liability to the jury, but so\nlittle that the court is going to be able to say that\nit's harmless under -- that the submission of the\ninvalid theory was harmless under Brecht?\nMR. SHAH: Yes. I mean, you can image in a\ncase -- take Neder. By this Neder instruction, the one\nomitting the materiality element, was submitted to the\njury certainly enough evidence to support it, and then\nthere was another valid theory --\nJUSTICE ALITO: There is difference. An\nelement of the defense has to be submitted to the jury.\nAnd it may be that that it's -- the element is\nundisputed, but a theory of liability isn't going to be\nsubmitted to the jury unless there is some evidence to\nsupport it.\nMR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, if -- if there\nis some evidence to support it, if we were in a direct\nreview context, that's the inquiry that Neder says. So\non a clean slate it might be that if there is sufficient\nevidence to support a contrary verdict, that that would\nend the inquiry.\nBut in many of these cases we are going to\nknow that the jury has made at least some findings, has\nfound some of the elements. And that might inform the\nharmless error inquiry, just like in this as we know\nthat the jury has found things like a respondent was a\nmajor participant, exhibited a reckless disregard for\nhuman life, discounted a significant portion of this --\nof his statement by rejecting the duress defense.\nIf there are no further questions, Your\nHonor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Shah.\nMr. O'Connell.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF J. BRADLEY O'CONNELL\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. O'CONNELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nUnlike the Sarausad case argued earlier this\nmorning, this is a case of conceded constitutional error\nunder the reasonable likelihood standard, the same\nquestion that consumed so much of the Sarausad argument.\nWe acknowledge that this is a trial error\nand is subject to the Brecht prejudice standard. And as\nI believe Justice Souter commented during the Sarausad\nargument, in a Brecht situation, the defendant wins the\nbenefit of the doubt. That is a lesson of this Court's\ndecision.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I agree with that. And my\nquestion is going to be -- at some point, both of you\nseem to agree with that so -- pretty much, it's a\nharmless error standard of review. I think a wrote a\ncase on that, which says that --\nMR. O'CONNELL: Yes. You wrote on O'Neal,\nYour Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Right. So why don't we\njust send it back and say apply the standard?\nMR. O'CONNELL: Your Honor, although the\nNinth Circuit admittedly used a structural defect\nnomenclature with which we don't agree, we believe that\nthe Court can't -- that upon considering both the Ninth\nCircuit decision and the district court decision, this\nCourt can affirm because the inquiry which the Ninth\nCircuit did conduct was actually a case-specific\ninquiry, not really a structural defect inquiry, and\nwhen an examination of the evidence and the verdicts and\nthe instructions and anything else indicative of the\njury's thinking still leaves the court uncertain whether\nthe jurors relied on the valid or the invalid theory,\nthat's a substantial and injurious influence. That is\ngrave doubt. That is equipoise, in the language of Your\nHonor's opinion.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You're saying that I should\nhave grave doubt myself and any judge would have to. He\nmade an argument here I think that wasn't such a bad\none. He said look at page 14 and you'll see the\nmistake, you know, in the joint appendix.\nMR. O'CONNELL: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: There it is. And it's\nabsolutely wrong. The basic instruction under the law\nsays you have to be engaged in the crime and you have to\nhave a certain state of intent. You have to have\ncommitted this murder in order to help the crime or at\nleast in order to escape.\nMR. O'CONNELL: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And that's wrong. Put them\ntogether, but then look at the instruction on page 13,\nwhich he actually gave, and the one on 13 really does\nseem to say that, or more so. It says, you can only\napply -- jury, you can only apply this special\ninstruction if two things are true: First, in lines 9\nthrough 12 of that instruction, it seems to repeat that\nyou have to be engaged in the crime. And then just\nbefore that, it says, and you have to have one of two\nstates of mind. You have to either intend to kill the\nperson or at least be recklessly indifferent. And since\nthat's what we said on page 13, the fact we made a\nmistake on page 14 doesn't matter that much. That's one\nof his arguments that I'm sure they have a lot of\nevidentiary ones and a bunch of other ones.\nMR. O'CONNELL: Your Honor, I think the\nanswer to that question is in the underlying trial\nreporter's transcript at pages 1015 to 1016, the\ndistrict attorney's cross-examination of Mr. Pulido.\nThe district attorney developed the theme quite\neffectively that, even under Mr. Pulido's own account,\nhe exhibited reckless indifference because he saw the\nmortally wounded victim lying there, and the D.A. said,\ndid you try to resuscitate him? Have you ever had a CPR\nclass? I did once. Well, did you do CPR on him? No.\nDid you call 9-11? You didn't care whether he lived or\ndied, did you?\nSo this entire line of cross-examination, to\nwhich the district attorney came back again, though\nsomewhat less dramatically, at 1330 of the transcript\nand again at 1337 to 1338, commenting that he -- that\nMr. Pulido did not go back in at some later point to\ncheck on the victim's condition, that entire line of\ncross-examination encouraged the theme that even under\nMr. Pulido's own account of the facts, he showed\nreckless indifference. And --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the error wasn't\nharmless. And that's an argument you can make before\nthe Ninth Circuit on remand.\nMR. O'CONNELL: That certainly is an\nargument that if the Court -- if the Court is convinced\nthat the Ninth Circuit's analysis in substance --\nbecause I realize the nomenclature -- the nomenclature\nwas inconsistent with harmless error, and I'm not going\nto defend that. If the Court is convinced that the\nsubstance of the Ninth Circuit's analysis was so far\nremoved from what harmless error analysis requires in\nthis context, we agree that the usual course would be to\nsend it back.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why don't we\njust take them at their word? As you say, they are\napplying the wrong nomenclature. It would be easy\nenough for them when they get it back to say, oh, we\nmeant, you know, harmless error under Brecht. But that\nseems to me to be at least an open question.\nMR. O'CONNELL: Your Honor, I think I could\nbest answer that by offering my own critique of the\nNinth Circuit opinion and -- which may explain why it\nmay be unnecessary. In my opinion, what the analysis\nthat the Ninth Circuit conducted was equivalent to a\nsufficient analysis, equivalent to the point of\nequipoise discussed in O'Neal. That is to say, it\nreviewed the evidence and said -- and the verdicts and\nthe instructions -- and said we're uncertain, we can't\ntell which way the jury went.\nMy critique of the Ninth Circuit's -- at\nleast its per curiam opinion, as opposed to one of the\nconcurring opinions, is that in fact this is not just a\ngeneral verdict case. We know a great deal about the\njurors' thinking in this case. We know that by a vote\nof either 8-4 or 4-8, the jurors rejected the\nprosecution's primary theory, which was that Pulido\npersonally shot the victim and that, in the prosecutor's\nwords, Aragon had nothing to do with this, Aragon wasn't\nthere, Aragon isn't a murderer.\nWe also know -- and this will be another\necho of the Sarausad case -- we also know that\nthroughout their five days of deliberations, the jurors\nsubmitted question after question directed to what are\nnow -- what are concededly defective erroneous\ninstructions, and moreover, those questions focused\nright in on the defect in the instructions and in\nparticular the timing of Mr. Pulido's assistance.\nAnd I refer the Court in particular to the\njurors' handwritten diagrams of alternative conceptions\nof felony-murder aiding and abetting liability, which\nare at 36 to 38 of the joint appendix, and also the\njurors' question at page 41 of the joint appendix\nwhether -- this goes right -- this goes, as the district\ncourt said, to the crux of the issue: Does the\ndefendant have to have knowledge before or during the\ncrime of the -- of the unlawful purpose of the\nperpetrator? And as to both of those questions the\njudge said: Go back and reread those same instructions,\nwhich of course were erroneous.\nSo my critique of the Ninth Circuit opinion,\nwhich is again slightly different, I think, than the\nState's, would be that it neglected to mention that\ncompelling evidence that in fact the jurors actually\nfound a set of facts corresponding to the invalid late\njoiner theory, because in my view what -- the analysis\nthe Ninth Circuit conducted gets us to a point of\nequipoise, and that's enough for Brecht. The defect in\nthe Ninth Circuit's analysis is they neglected to also\nfactor in those juror queries, and in my view the juror\nqueries move us from a state of equipoise to a very high\nprobability that the jurors relied on the -- and adopted\na factual scenario corresponding to an invalid theory.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Under Brecht, you\nhave the burden of showing a substantial injurious\neffect.\nMR. O'CONNELL: Well, actually, Your Honor,\nas understand O'Neal the Court specifically renounced\ndescribing it as a burden, and in fact said that we are\nnot going to use the \"burden\" terminology, and rather\nthan talk about allocating burdens, we are going to\naddress it from the perspective of the judge and say, if\nthe judge is in equipoise, that is sufficient.\nWe also know that -- drawing upon the\nrelationship between the Brecht standard and others, we\nknow that a Strickland standard is deemed to -- that if\nyou have Strickland prejudice, you don't have to go\nthrough a separate Brecht analysis. Because of\nStrickland, reasonable probability also satisfies\nBrecht's substantial and injurious influence. Well,\nthis Court has said again and again, in construing\nStrickland, it does not require a more likely than not\nshowing; it simply requires a showing sufficient to\nundermine confidence in the outcome. And --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think you win\nunder Brecht?\nMR. O'CONNELL: I think we will under\nBrecht, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You think the Ninth\nCircuit, although it didn't use that label, actually\napplied the Brecht standard?\nMR. O'CONNELL: In substance, it did even\nthough, as I said, I will -- I can't -- I can't run from\nthe language the Ninth Circuit actually used.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure. Well, then it\nseems to me you agree with your friend that the Brecht\nstandard -- and the government -- that the Brecht\nstandard applies.\nMR. O'CONNELL: Yes, we do, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And all the fight is\nover is whether the Ninth Circuit applied that standard\nor not?\nMR. O'CONNELL: Yes, Your Honor, whether it\napplied it in substance.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why don't we just\nsend it back and ask them? Say: We can't tell. The\nparties are having disagreement about what you did.\nWhat did you do?\nMR. O'CONNELL: Your Honor, as I said a\nlittle earlier, if I fail to persuade the Court that the\nsubstance of what the Ninth Circuit did was --\neffectively satisfied Brecht as interpreted in O'Neal,\nthen I agree that's an appropriate course, and we\nindicated that in the final section of our brief. There\nis not --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm sure that would be -- I\nmean, what worries me is proliferating arguments among\njudges. Why not just say, you know, apply Brecht. I'd\nlike it with the O'Neal clause because it seems to me\nthe O'Neal clause applies.\nMR. O'CONNELL: I agree, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Just go do it. And then\nthey can say \"we already did it,\" or they can say \"we\ndidn't already do it, but we'll do it now.\" Let them\nsay what they want to say.\nMR. O'CONNELL: Your Honor -- and, again, I\ndon't -- I don't strenuously object to that because, as\nI've mentioned if the court, if the court remains,\nremains of the view that what the Ninth Circuit did was\nsimply incompatible with Brecht, then I agree it should\nbe sent back and I -- and I understand why that might be\nthe Court's inclination. Let me offer another angle for\nwhy what the Ninth Circuit did is entirely compatible\nwith Brecht.\nIn civil cases, this Court routinely applies\nthe same sort of general verdict analysis which in\ncriminal cases has become to be known as the Stromberg\nline. In fact, it did it as recently this summer in the\nExxon Valdez case. Now civil cases don't have Chapman,\nthey don't have structural defect; civil cases are\nsubject to a harmless error standard which ultimately\ngoes back to the identical statute which was construed\nin Kotteakos.\nAnd going back to the opinion of the Court\nin O'Neal, in addressing the relationship between\nKotteakos/Brecht harmless error review and civil\nharmless error review, the Court indicated he think\nrather strongly that those standards are either\nequivalent or to the extent that they differ, the\nBrecht/ Kotteakos standard is less forgiving of error\nbecause of the liberty interest at stake. Now that\nmeans two things. From a retrospective point of view of\nsimply construing this Court's different lines of cases,\nI think it demonstrates that this general verdict\nanalysis is entirely consistent with a Kotteakos type\nharmless error analysis, but it also has some\nperspective implications, because if this Court were to\nwholly disavow that type of analysis and say that has\nnothing to do with harmless error review, that's going\nto impact civil cases, too; and obviously in all this\nCourt's opinions, the Court is considering not only the\nimmediate case, but what is going to happen if we -- if\nwe rule one way or another.\nSo this case -- this case supports a finding\nof prejudice under that O'Neal equipoise and as for the\nNinth Circuit did, that's not what it called it, it even\nmore strongly supports prejudice when one factors in the\nrest of the record, notably the juror -- the juror\nqueries and another item which I think may be responsive\nto some of Justice Alito's earlier questions, which is\nthe strength of the evidence on the various theories.\nThere were three theories and obviously\nthere was evidence in support of the prosecution's main\ntheory that Pulido shot the victim himself. There was\nevidence -- obviously there was substantial evidence in\nthe form of Pulido's own testimony in support of the\ninvalid late-joiner theory. Out of these the one theory\nthat had least support in the record before the jury was\nthe valid aiding and abetting theory, because no witness\ntestified to a scenario in which Pulido assisted in some\nfashion or another prior to the shooting; nor did the\nprosecutor attempt to develop that type of scenario in\nargument because the prosecutor was very clear:\nProsecutor said you're going to get aiding and abetting\ninstructions just in case. They only apply -- if --\nthey only come into play if you were to believe the\ndefendant's story which was a real whopper; but if you\nbelieve the defendant's story the felony murder rule\napplies.\nBut then the prosecutor immediately went\nback, \"but I don't think it applies at all, Aragon\nwasn't there. Aragon didn't do it. Pulido did it,\" and\nprosecutor went back to his primary theory.\nSo the theory which the -- present in the\ninstructions was least before the jury, was the valid\naiding and abetting theory, yet defining this conceded\nerror harmless depends on the notion either that the\njury actually adopted a pre-shooting aiding or abetting\nor that they necessarily would have adopted one if\nproperly instructed.\nThere is one final point I'd like to make,\nwhich is there is a qualitative aspect to Brecht; and\nwhen one has an error under which the defense testimony\neven if believed renders the defendant guilty\nerroneously, that derails the entire defense. That it\nseems to me is the quintessential substantial and\ninjurious influence; because it practically renders the\ntrial nullity by erroneously telling the jury even if\nyou find this set of facts, the defendant is guilty.\nSo for these reasons and additionally for\nthe very thorough prejudice analysis found in the\ndistrict court opinion, we urge the Court to affirm,\ndespite the Ninth Circuit's inept nomenclature, but in\nthe event the Court is dissatisfied with that\nexplanation, we have acknowledged that the appropriate\ncourse in that instance would be to send it back under\nBrecht.\nUnless the Court has any further questions,\nI'm prepared to submit.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. O'Connell.\nMR. O'CONNELL: Thank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Friedlander, you\nhave three minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEREMY FRIEDLANDER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. FRIEDLANDER: We agree that we need to\ndo Brecht. We disagree on what Brecht is. Respondent\nis telling you that Brecht is the error test, whether\nthe jury relied on the valid or invalid theory. That's\nwhat he says Brecht is. In Calderon v Coleman, this\nCourt said there is a difference between the error test\nand the harmless error test.\nAll these questions that the jury asked went\nto the question of error. Did the jury misapply the law\nby failing to find a contemporaneity aspect of felony\nmurder? They did not go to the harmless error question\nof what the jury would have done had it been properly\ninstructed.\nWe urge the Court in remanding the case to\nmake clear that the error analysis must be kept separate\nfrom the harmless error analysis. This is a mistake\nJudge Thomas made in his concurring opinion. We -- he\nassumes -- he sees a mistake in an instruction; he\nassumes that the mistake rises to the level of\nconstitutional error; and then he does a prejudice\nanalysis by deciding whether the mistake caused the jury\nto misapply the law. In other words, he -- he applies\nan error analysis to decide prejudice. And what he does\nis he includes all this evidence of the questions the\njury asked when those questions went only to the\nmisapplication of law that was the error, and did\nnothing to show the basis of the jury's special\ncircumstance finding, which is the heart of the harmless\nerror determination here. If there are no further\nquestions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n"
