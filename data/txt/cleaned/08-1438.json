RUSSELL: Actually, it's Mr. Russell.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, I'm sorry. I'm\nlooking ahead. And, oh, I've got the argument wrong,\ntoo.\nWe will hear argument in 08-1438,\nSossamon v. Texas.\nYou don't look like Mr. Schnapper. Mr.\nRussell.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN K. RUSSELL\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. RUSSELL: By accepting Federal funds for\nits prisons, Texas consented to suit for appropriate\nrelief for violations of the Religious Land Use and\nInstitutionalized Persons Act. The question in this\ncase is whether that appropriate relief encompasses\ndamages. If you simply asked what kind of relief is\ngenerally appropriate against a State, the answer would\nbe no relief, not even an injunction, because States\nordinarily are not subject even to suit without their\nconsent. And so RLUIPA necessarily asks a more precise\nquestion, and that is what relief is appropriate against\na State that has consented to be sued for violations of\nthis sort. Damages, for example, are perfectly\nappropriate against a State that has consented to be\nsued for breach of contract.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Now, what would it be,\nMr. Russell, if there were a suit under RFRA because a\nFederal penal institution was not allowing for the\nreligious practices that the act protects?\nMR. RUSSELL: In -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In a suit under RFRA,\ncould there be -- would damages be an appropriate\nremedy?\nMR. RUSSELL: In our view they are, although\nit's a different context, and we recognize that the\ngovernment disagrees with us on that. We can't point to\nthe Spending Clause-contract analogy that applies with\nrespect to Spending Clause legislation as RFRA applies\nto the Federal Government. But there are other\nindications, including for example the long tradition of\ndamages being appropriate relief for the violation of\ncivil rights.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, could we back up.\nYou are saying you could get them against the Federal\nGovernment too, but the government doesn't think so?\nMR. RUSSELL: That is our view, although we\nrecognize that RLUIPA is different in this respect, in\nthat it's a Spending Clause statute under which -- and\nthis Court's decision in Barnes v. Gorman makes clear\nthat damages are traditionally appropriate relief for\nthe violation of any Spending Clause statute.\nOf course, there is also a tradition that\ndamages are for the violation of civil rights. Take\nstatutes like Title VI, Title VII, Title IX, section 504\nof the ADA, the list goes on and on, where Congress has\ncreated damages as the quintessential remedy to enforce\ncivil rights, and when Congress has subjected States to\nsuits under such statutes, it has always put them on\nequal footing with other defendants and subjected them\nto damages as well. But even beyond that -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But did it use such\nlanguage as \"appropriate relief\"?\nMR. RUSSELL: Well, for example -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, that's the\nquestion. Our cases say it has to be clear to the State\nwhen they go into one of these schemes, it has to be\nclear what liability they are subjecting themselves to.\nAnd in these other cases I think it was clear. I don't\nthink it's clear with simply the word \"appropriate\nrelief.\"\nMR. RUSSELL: No, we are not saying that the\nword \"appropriate relief\" in itself supplies the\nclarity. It's looking at that language and the way the\ncourt interprets statutes generally, among other things,\nlooking at the tradition of what constitutes appropriate\nrelief for a violation of this sort.\nWe do think that Barnes v. Gorman is\nappropriate precedent in telling the court -- in telling\nTexas what kind of relief is generally thought\nappropriate to satisfy Congress's desire to remedy\nviolations of a Spending Clause statute.\nWe recognize, of course, that Barnes didn't\ninvolve sovereign defendants, but the local governments\nin that case had the same rights as a State would. It\njust comes out of the Spending Clause rather than the\nEleventh Amendment. That is, both constitutional\nprovisions prohibit Congress from subjecting defendants\nto damages suits under Spending Clause legislation\nwithout their consent. And this Court has enforced that\nidentical constitutional right with the same clear\nstatement test derived from Pennhurst v. Halderman.\nEven more, the contract analogy the Court\nrelied on in Barnes is no less apt simply because one of\nthe recipients is a State.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The contract\nanalogy, I suppose, would provide that the meaning of\nthe contract is interpreted against the drafter. Right?\nMR. RUSSELL: That would have been true in\nBarnes as well.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. So to the\nextent the State is arguing for a restrictive\ninterpretation, it gets at least a little help from the\nfact that the Federal Government wrote the statute.\nMR. RUSSELL: Well, it gets the same amount\nof help that the local governments got in Barnes, which\nwasn't enough. And Not only does the analogy, I think,\napply; so does the remedy. Damages are a quintessential\nappropriate remedy for breach of contract by a State so\nlong as the State has agreed to be sued for violation of\na contract.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Russell, the State\nlooks at this statute and says, oh, this statute\npreserves the PLRA, and under the PLRA there are no\ndamages without having a physical injury. So putting\nthe PLRA together with \"appropriate relief,\" PLRA is\ntelling us it's not appropriate relief when there is no\nphysical injury.\nMR. RUSSELL: Well, I would say two things\nabout that. One, keep in mind that the PLRA limitations\nonly apply to incarcerated individuals. It doesn't\napply to the people RLUIPA protects in State-run nursing\nhomes or mental health facilities. So Congress wouldn't\nhave been thinking that appropriate relief is defined in\nsome sense by the scope of the PLRA.\nIn addition, we think that the fact that\nCongress expressly said that the PLRA applies to limit\nthe relief that's otherwise available under RLUIPA shows\nthat Congress didn't think that the PLRA itself made the\nrelief inappropriate. It's simply that there is some\nrelief that is otherwise appropriate that will be\nlimited in some circumstances by the PLRA.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But in the prison\nsetting, then, isn't it an academic question, because\nthere are not going to be damages anyway?\nMR. RUSSELL: No, that's not true, for a\ncouple of reasons. One, there are many cases involving\npecuniary damages. There is destruction of religious\nitems that won't be subject to the PLRA limitation.\nThere are -- there are cases that give rise\nto pecuniary claims. So there is destruction of a\nreligious item, a Bible or something like that.\nThere are also cases in which the violation\nwill result in a physical injury. There are cases where\npeople are deprived of food for long periods of time.\nThere is a case where a prison refused to transport an\ninmate for medical treatment outside the facility\nbecause he wouldn't take off his yarmulke. Congress, I\ndon't think would have thought that the PLRA limitations\nrendered a damages remedy unimportant. And at the very\nleast -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Does it include punitive\ndamages?\nMR. RUSSELL: Excuse me?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Does it include punitive\ndamages?\nMR. RUSSELL: The statute, I think, does not\nin light of Barnes, because Barnes said that you get\ntraditional contract remedies and punitive damages are\nnot a traditional contract remedy.\nBeyond that tradition, though, there's also\ntextual cues in the statue itself. There are three of\nthem that I would like to focus on. I'll list them and\nthen discuss them.\nOne is the definitions section, which lumps\nStates in together with local governments in the\ndefinition of \"government.\" The second is the Federal\nenforcement provision, which specifically allows suits\nby the United States, but only for the equitable and\ndeclaratory relief that the State says is the only thing\nthat's available under appropriate relief. And finally\nis the fact that the statute separately already\nauthorizes suits for injunctive relief against State\nofficials, making the addition of suits against States\neffectively surplusage unless some other kind of relief\nis available against the State.\nBeginning with the definitions section, this\nCourt recognized in the United States v. Nordic Village\nthat where Congress, in the Bankruptcy Act, defined\n\"governmental unit\" to include both the United States\nand a State, that Congress was making clear, quote, that\n\"States and Federal sovereigns are to be treated the\nsame for immunity purposes.\"\nI think the same lesson comes out of the\nfact that RLUIPA defines \"governments\" to include not\nonly States, but local governments, and subjects all\ngovernments to the same cause of action for the same\nappropriate relief. Congress was expressing there as\nclear as it could that there was a definitional\nequivalence between States and local government.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah, but -- but, I mean,\nthat means either that the Federal Government -- that\nthe State government is liable for damages just as\nmunicipalities are, or that municipalities are immune to\nsuit for damages just as the States are.\nI mean, that -- you don't know which way\nthat cuts, do you?\nMR. RUSSELL: Well, I will point you to\nother provisions of the statute.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, maybe let's talk\nabout them, then.\nMR. RUSSELL: Okay. One is the fact that,\nas I mentioned before, the statute -- and I think the\nState agrees -- already allows suits for injunctive\nrelief against State officials in their official\ncapacity. The only thing that adding States as\ndefendant would accomplish in light of that would simply\nbe a change in the caption of the lawsuit, unless States\nare subject to some relief that State officials under Ex\nparte Young are not.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, except this would\nbe a violation of a statute, not a violation of a\nconstitutional right. So under Ex parte Young they\ncouldn't necessarily get an injunction.\nMR. RUSSELL: Well, I would set aside the\nquestion of whether Ex parte Young applies of its own\nforce. I think by defining \"officials\" as a form of\ngovernment and authorizing suits for appropriate relief\nagainst officials, I think everybody agrees that that\nauthorizes suits against the officials for at least\ninjunctive relief.\nAnd then the question is, well, what does it\naccomplish to also authorize suits against States? And\nI think the obvious answer is it authorizes a damages\nclaim against the State. And even in light of Barnes,\nthe State seems to acknowledge that damages are\nappropriate relief against local governments under this\nstatute.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I can conceive of a\ncase where -- where the State's violation of RLUIPA\nconsists of a State statute that simply deprives the\nindividual of his rights under RLUIPA.\nWhat State official would you -- would you\nsue? It seems to me you couldn't sue the State\nlegislature, so it would make sense to have an\ninjunction against the State.\nMR. RUSSELL: I think it's common in that\ncircumstance to sue the State attorney general for Ex\nparte Young relief, for example, if you have a\nconstitutional claim against the statute, as may very\nwell have happened in the California case, or the\ngovernor, I guess. So I don't think that naming -\nhaving a State as a defendant is necessary for that\npurpose here.\nIn addition, as I mentioned before, I think\neven the State acknowledges that damages are appropriate\nrelief against local governments, but Congress made\nclear that when it intended the identity of a party to\nresult in a dramatically different scope of relief, it\ndid so expressly, and you can see that in the U.S.\nenforcement provision. There, Congress specially\nauthorized suits by the United States and had its own\nremedial provision which provides only for declaratory\nand injunctive relief.\nAnd that shows both that Congress didn't\nexpect courts to simply figure out that different kinds\nof defendants would be subject to different appropriate\nrelief, but also -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Isn't it argued that a\npossible purpose of that was to make it clear that the\nFederal Government couldn't sue a State to recover money\nthat had been given to it?\nMR. RUSSELL: Well, the fact -- I would say\ntwo things about that. One is Congress didn't limit\nthat provision to suits against States. It's anybody\nwho gets sued by the United States is limited to\nequitable injunctive relief.\nAnd that's, again, an example of Congress\ntreating States the same as everybody else. Whether\nthey are sued by the United States or sued by a private\nparty, it is the same relief. It's the same remedial\nprovision and we think that suggests the same relief.\nThat provision also kind of -- the language\nof that provision, \"injunctive or declaratory relief,\"\nstands in pretty stark contrast to the facially broader\nphrase \"appropriate relief\" in the general provision.\nIn addition to RLUIPA itself, I think it's\nalso worth pointing out that the State had independent\nnotice under section 2000(d)(7) -- this is the\nRehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986, where Congress\nmade clear to Texas that it would be subject to suit for\ndamages under any statute that -- under a section of any\nstatute that prohibits discrimination by Federal funding\nrecipients.\nAnd I think the question here boils down to\nwhether RLUIPA is materially distinguishable from\nsection 504, which is listed in section 2000(d)(7) as an\nexample of a statute prohibiting discrimination. And\nif -- I think that means that the catch-all has to at\nleast be broad enough to encompass section 504, and in\nour view, the two statutes are not distinguishable.\nBoth prohibit both the kind of disparate treatment of\nsimilarly-situated individuals that the State\nacknowledges constitutes discrimination and requires\naccommodations in some circumstances.\nJUSTICE ALITO: You addressed the -- the\neffect of the issue here on persons who are in State\ninstitutions other than penal institutions.\nWhat would be -- what's the effect of the\nissue here on land use restrictions? Are there many\ncases in which issues involving land use restrictions\nare -- are raised in litigation against the State as\nopposed to a municipality?\nMR. RUSSELL: It's quite rare. I am aware\nof one pending case in Vermont where there is a\nchallenge to a -- a State environmental regulation, but\nfor the most part it isn't.\nBut if this Court were to, you know,\nsection -- the provision that we are talking about here\napplies to land use as well as to institutionalized\npersons, and one would ordinarily think that the statute\nwould have the same meaning depending on context.\nI recognize that the State's basic argument\nis that the meaning changes depending on who the\ndefendant is, and I suppose if you accept that it could\nalso depend on -- on what provision is being applied.\nBut that's not normally how statutes work.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the answer to\nJustice Alito's question is that in the land use area,\nzoning for example, those are mostly cases against\nmunicipalities or counties?\nMR. RUSSELL: That is correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Not against the State.\nMR. RUSSELL: That is correct.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The government is going to\ntell us that the standard for waiver with respect to the\nFederal Government is different from the standard with\nrespect to the State. Do you -- I think that's what\nthey are going to tell us. Do you agree with that?\nMR. RUSSELL: No. I actually don't\nunderstand them to be making that argument, either. But\nI know for sure that that's not our position. And the\nCourt's decision in Barnes I think, for example, is\nentirely consistent with the Court's recent decisions,\nincluding for example in Richlin, where it's made clear\nthat when you are considering the scope of waiver of\nsovereign immunity, you engage in ordinary statutory\ninterpretation and then the sovereign is respected. If\nat the end of that interpretation the statute remains\nunclear, you know, certainly the sovereign wins. But -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But it seems to me that\nthe States are in need of special protection. With -\nwith the Congress, if it's a Federal immunity, the\nCongress can always -- always change its law.\nMR. RUSSELL: Well -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That just can't happen\nwith the State.\nMR. RUSSELL: I don't know that this Court's\ncases support the idea that -- that heightened clear\nstatement rule for States versus the Federal Government.\nIf anything, I think they suggest the opposite, but so\nlong as the statute is clear.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's the suggestion of the\nopposite that -- that I am trying -- I am trying to\nexplore.\nYou have your white light on.\nMR. RUSSELL: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nRussell.\nMs. Harrington.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SARAH E. HARRINGTON,\nFOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMS. HARRINGTON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nThe Respondent in this case agrees that when\nit accepts Federal funds for its correctional system it\nvoluntarily waives its sovereign immunity to private\nsuits in Federal court to enforce RLUIPA, and it is\nclear under this Court's decisions in cases such as\nFranklin and Barnes that that voluntary waiver\nencompasses a waiver to suits for money damages.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Suppose Congress passes a\nstatute that creates a private right of action against\nboth the Federal Government and against the States and\nin both instances authorizes all appropriate relief.\nAre damages available in the action against the Federal\nGovernment as well as the State government?\nMS. HARRINGTON: Well, it would depend on\nthe context to answer both questions.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, the State -- the State\nprovision is a Spending Clause provision.\nMS. HARRINGTON: Then the answer would be\nyes as to the States. This Court has been clear in\ncases such as Franklin and Barnes that in the Spending\nClause context, unless Congress indicates an intent to\nrebut the presumption somehow -\nJUSTICE ALITO: And what about the Federal\nGovernment?\nMS. HARRINGTON: In the Federal Government\nprobably not, although this Court has looked to\nbackground principles in interpreting words such as\n\"appropriate.\"\nJUSTICE ALITO: What sense does it make?\nOther than -- I know you are representing a client and\nso special pleading for your client is -- is to be\nexpected, but I find that very difficult to accept. If\n\"all appropriate relief\" includes damages as against the\nState that accepts Federal money, then you know, what's\ngood for the State should be good for the Federal\nGovernment.\nMS. HARRINGTON: Well, I would say two\nthings. First, in both cases what you want is a clear\nstatement of an intent to waive the sovereign's\nimmunity, either by the Federal Government or the State\ngovernment. And also that it's important to keep in\nmind that in cases such as Franklin and Barnes, this\nCourt was construing statutes that did not say anything\nabout what remedies were appropriate, didn't mention\nremedies whatsoever.\nAnd so we don't rely so much on RLUIPA's use\nof the phrase \"appropriate relief\" as we do on the\nSpending Clause context.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But those cases did not\ninvolve States, right?\nMS. HARRINGTON: Those cases did not involve\nStates, that's true. But -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And I think that the -\nthe core question here is the State -- and Justice Alito\njust posed it: the State is being treated with less\ndignity than the Federal Government, because your\nposition is that the Federal Government is shielded by\nits sovereign immunity, and you say the State is not.\nMS. HARRINGTON: On the contrary, as to the\ndignity point, Your Honor, if -- the State voluntarily\nwaives its immunity when it accepts Federal funds that\nclearly condition the acceptance of the funds on the\nwaiver of its immunity. The State in this case doesn't\ncontest that it has waived its sovereign immunity\nvoluntarily to some universe of suits to enforce RLUIPA.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But we are talking about\ngeneral principles of interpretation and the proposition\nthat we are suggesting is that the State surely should\nbe entitled to the same dignity, the same protection\nagainst suits as the Federal Government, and you suggest\njust the opposite.\nMS. HARRINGTON: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And it seems to me that's\ncontrary to standard principles of the Federal -- of\nprotecting the Federal balance.\nMS. HARRINGTON: If you were construing a\nState statute that voluntarily waived its own immunity,\nthen you might -- we might say the use of appropriate\nrelief in that statute should be construed the same as\nthe use of appropriate relief in RFRA. But in this case\nyou are not talking about a State's waiver of its\nimmunity through its -- through statutory language. The\nCourt said in College Savings Bank that when a -- when a\nState takes Federal funds that are conditioned on a\nwaiver of immunity, it is the act of accepting the funds\nthat is the waiver and it waives its immunity to suits\nto the extent that it has noticed that it is doing so.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But it's -- but it's only\nbecause they accept the funds at all that the Spending\n-- that the Spending Clause is even operative.\nMS. HARRINGTON: That's right. But again,\nit's -- it's the act of accepting the funds that are\nclearly conditioned that constitutes the waiver. So\nthat the waiver -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the waiver -- I mean,\non the State side they can say it says \"appropriate\nrelief.\" All right; we accept that we are going to be\nvulnerable to an injunction suit. But we're the State\nand it's our treasury, and it is not appropriate relief.\nWe didn't waive it. It's not -- doesn't say in the\nSpending Clause legislation that we open up our\ntreasury.\nMS. HARRINGTON: But there is no basis in\neither the Eleventh Amendment or the statutory\nprovisions in RLUIPA for distinguishing relief of an\ninjunctive nature from relief in damages against the\nState. The Eleventh Amendment talks about suits in law\nand in equity, and there is nothing in RLUIPA that would\ngive the States notice that they are waiving their\nimmunity to suits for injunctive relief, but not give\nthem notice that they are waiving their immunity to\nsuits for money damages. This Court -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The word \"appropriate\" -\nthe word \"appropriate\" would -- would suggest that to\nme. If -- if I'm a State attorney general, and I -- I\nknow that the rule is sovereign immunity and -- and\nespecially with regard to raids on the State treasury, I\nthink it would be at least plausible that I would -- I\nwould read \"appropriate relief\" not to include monetary\nrelief.\nAnd we have said -- the language from our\ncases -- Lane says a waiver of sovereign immunity must\nbe unequivocally expressed in the statutory text and\nwill be strictly construed in terms of its scope in\nfavor of the sovereign. That's -- that's a high test.\nMS. HARRINGTON: But even -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and although I might\nsit down and come out with a conclusion after intensive\nstudy that yes, maybe the best reading of this statute\nis that it allows money damages, I find it hard to say\nthat it is unequivocally expressed in the statutory\ntext.\nMS. HARRINGTON: Well, two things if I\ncould, Your Honor. In Lane v. Pena, the question before\nthe Court was it wasn't -- it was outside the Spending\nClause context, because the question was whether section\n504 of the Rehabilitation Act applied to the Federal\nGovernment, and when the Federal Government applies,\neven in the Spending Clause context, conditions on\nitself there is no contract-like relationship. But the\nsecond thing this Court said in Barnes -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you deny that it has\nto be unequivocal?\nMS. HARRINGTON: It has to be unequivocal,\nbut -- but the context in which you are construing\nwhether -- whether the sovereign is expressing its\nintent to waive its immunity is different when you are\ntalking about the Federal Government applying\nobligations on itself than when you are talking about\nthe Federal Government offering money to a State in -\nin exchange for its agreeing to comply with -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that has nothing to\ndo with whether the language is clear or not to\nconstitute a waiver. There is no principle of law that\nyou are articulating that says it -- it has to be -\nthis is not clear enough for the Federal Government, but\nit is clear enough for the State. \"Appropriate relief\"\neither has a meaning or it doesn't.\nMS. HARRINGTON: Right. And again, we are\nnot relying so much on the use of the phrase\n\"appropriate relief\" in the statute. What that -- the\nwork that does is it affirms that the background\npresumption of the Bell v. Hood cases applies to proper\ndefendants under RLUIPA, which include State\ngovernments.\nBut as this Court said in Barnes, when a -\nwhen a recipient of Federal funds takes the funds, it is\non notice that it is going to be subject not only to the\nremedies explicitly provided in the text of the relevant\nlegislation, but also to remedies that are traditionally\navailable in suits for breach of contract, and those\ninclude compensatory damages and injunctive relief.\nNow the State would have this Court turn\nthat presumption, in terms of traditional contract\nrules, on its head by saying that this -- that this\nCourt should hold that the State presumptively waived\nits immunity to suits for injunctive relief but not for\ndamages.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What do you say about -- I\nthink I read in one of these briefs that what I think is\nthe most relevant similar statute, RFRA, has been held\nnot to encompass the same word -- not to encompass the\nmonetary relief, and also there was some legislative\nhistory where people testified and told Congress at the\ntime that the word \"appropriate\" won't encompass\nmonetary relief. Am I remembering that correctly?\nMS. HARRINGTON: Well, I would give you the\nsame answer I just gave, which is that we are not\npointing so much to the use of the -- using the phrase\n\"appropriate relief\" in the statute as we are to the\nSpending Clause context. And this Court has held that\nwhen there is these conditions placed on Federal funds,\nthe recipient of the funds understands when it takes the\nmoney that when it intentionally violates the conditions\nto which it has agreed it will be subject to suit for\nmoney damages.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But then you're\nbracketing the State with counties and municipalities.\nIt really comes down to a question -- who decides\nwhether the state fisc is touched. And why isn't it\nmost appropriate for this Court to say, Congress can\ncall it either way, but our rule is, Congress, if you\nwant to reach the State treasury, you have to say so\nexplicitly. And then there is no doubt when the State\nenters a contract that it's going to be subject to money\ndamages as well as injunctive relief.\nMS. HARRINGTON: Well, this Court has\nconsistently applied a clear notice requirement to\nconditions that Congress places on Federal funds. That\nclear notice requirement arose out of cases like\nPennhurst and South Dakota v. Dole, in which there were\nState recipients of Federal funds. And the Court said\nthat the validity of Congress's constitutional action in\nexercising its Spending Clause authority depends on it\ngiving the recipients of the funds clear notice of the\nconditions that they are agreeing to because of the\ncontract-like nature of Spending Clause legislation.\nNow, that same rule was applied in Franklin\nand Gebser and Davis and Dole, even though the\ndefendants in those cases were not sovereigns. It's\nstill the same notice requirement and there is no reason\nto think that a county government would be able to\nunderstand, would be on notice that it would be subject\nto compensatory damages suits, and a State government\nwould not. To be sure, the State government has more to\ngive up. It might be a harder choice for the State\nabout whether to take the money or not. But the choice\nis the State's, and when it says yes, I'm going to take\nthis money, it agrees to the conditions that are\nattached to the money.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMS. HARRINGTON: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Ho.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES C. HO\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. HO: The phrase \"appropriate relief\" is\na textbook example of ambiguity, not unmistakable\nclarity. And that should end the inquiry.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If it is, why is\ninjunctive relief included at all? Meaning, what you\nseem to be saying to me is that no relief should be\nappropriate, because no relief is clear whether it's\ninjunctive relief or damages?\nMR. HO: We agree with the U.S.'s reading of\nRFRA. The same should attach here. There is an express\ncause of action. So that cause of action has to do\nsomething and we are applying to that express cause of\naction the narrowest reading, which is -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Some would say that\ninjunctive relief attaches more to the public FISC then\ncompensatory relief. Because future conduct or change\nof conduct can have an enormous intrusion on the public\nFISC, so why do we draw the line between saying one is\nmore intrusive than the other?\nMR. HO: Two answers, Your Honor. The\ntraditional line drawing that you see in sovereign\nimmunity is injunctive relief. Any prospective relief\nis less intrusive on sovereign immunity than any form of\nretrospective relief, damages and that sort of thing.\nBut especially true in this context, because when you\ntalk about the Spending Clause, we can walk away from\ninjunctive relief, from an injunction at any time. We\ncan simply stop receiving the funds and stop accepting\nthe funds and the injunction evaporates, but we can't\nwalk away from a damage remedy. So we are construing\nthe express cause of action in RLUIPA, like in RFRA, to\ndo the judicial minimum. Which is that judicial relief\nwhich requires states to do what we are already required\nto do, which is to comply with the substantial burden\nmandatory under RLUIPA. So the fact that appropriate\nrelief is essentially inherently ambiguous should end\nthe analysis, because after all, the Court is required\nunmistakably clear text and rejected merely permissible\ninferences for two reasons, to ensure both careful,\nrobust deliberation by Congress before disturbing the\nfederal state balance of power, as well as to ensure\nclear notice.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I was looking at the cases\nthe best I can at the moment. I think you might say\nthat there are a lot of cases which interpret the word\n\"appropriate relief\" to include monetary relief. And\nthen there is some that don't. And to get a rule out of\nthem, you would have to say, well, they are looking to\ncontext. And in context it sometimes is clear,\nsometimes occasionally not. But here, isn't this and\nmaybe this was asked, but I want your answer. The\ncontext here, the words appropriate relief, govern both\nthe prison situation and the land use situation, don't\nthey? You are given an action when the government\nthrough a general land use regulation infringes\nsomebody's right to build, for example. Now, wouldn't\nthat kind of interference with the use of property quite\noften and normally require some kind of monetary\ncompensation? This isn't just the odd thing in a\nprison, where it's talking about it might be called\nbuilding a religious building or building some kind of\nparking, all kinds of things that have monetary\ncompensation. Do you see my question?\nMR. HO: I think I do, Your Honor. First of\nall, we certainly agree that your premise, which is that\ncontext matters, the Court has said specifically\nappropriate relief can enlarge or contract, it could be\nmean monetary or it could mean not monetary, so it does\ndepend on context. I confess that your question is\ninteresting, we are obviously focused on section 3.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I know, but isn't it the\nsame word that governs both?\nMR. HO: It is the same word.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If it's the same word that\ngoverns both and if land cases very often involve claims\nfor money, I would think that would cut against you.\nBut that's why I ask. I want to get your response.\nMR. HO: Well, we are still looking for\nexpress language in the text.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But there are loads of\ncases that have nothing more than appropriate relief and\nin those cases context makes it clear. The only one\nreally I thought strongly -- your strongest case seems\nto me to be RFRA.\nMR. HO: RFRA certainly is the direct\ncontext from which the words appropriate relief in this\nstatute are drawn. And RFRA, of course, is land use,\nit's prisons, it's anything, RFRA applies to the federal\ngovernment or any activity under the sun.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Uh-huh.\nMR. HO: So for that reason alone, I think\nwe might resist the notion that the specific uses of\nappropriate relief in RLUIPA would somehow provide any\nsort of change or certainly any expectation that we\nwould have or that Congress would have, for that matter,\nthat the words appropriate relief would take on a new\nmeaning just because it's land use.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, so often, what I'm\nthinking of, a church wands to build, and they can't\nbecause of a land restriction. And it turns out that\nthat land restriction violates this statute. And in the\nmeantime they have had to rent buildings, they have had\nto maybe build somewhere else and they have had to do\nall kinds of things that cost money. And that's why I\nwould think in that context money would be a natural\nthing.\nMR. HO: I'm not sure though -\nJUSTICE BREYER: To fulfill appropriateness.\nMR. HO: I'm actually not sure that that\nwould be true even in that context. Certainly anybody\nmight want money, but when it comes to what Congress has\nindicated and what states would expect, I would imagine\nthat the federal government's biggest interest is in\nmaking sure that states and other recipients use the\nmoney for what it's supposed to be for, comply with the\nsubstantial burden mandate. And a local government is\nnot doing so with regard to a church, then they should\nbe enjoined so that they would be required to comply\nwith it. If anything, damages might exacerbate the\nproblem just in the sense that we are now taking federal\nmoney and applying damages to it.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought a local\ngovernment would be subject to damages. We are talking\nabout the state.\nMR. HO: We are talking about the state,\nYour Honor. To be clear, we do not actually concede\nthat damages would even be available against a local\ngovernment. Our point here is that simply it doesn't\nmatter for us, because we obviously are treated very\ndifferently from local governments. I think they have,\nboth the Petitioner and U.S. have indicated that the\nstatute should treat state and locals the same way. The\nproblem with that is the Constitution obviously treats\nstates and locals very differently. The Constitution\ntreats the state and federal government in the same way,\nin that both enjoy sovereign immunity and included in\nthat are the principles of sovereign immunity, the need\nfor specific waiver, not just a clear waiver, but\nspecific as to the scope of the waiver, and specific as\nto the remedies.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So now we have three\ndistinctions. With respect to land use discrimination,\nthe Rehab Act would presumably apply. So the Rehab Act\nsays compensatory damages are permissible for that kind\nof discriminatory claim, so now we have compensatory\ndamages for that. We have, potentially, compensatory\ndamages for local governments, but not for State or\nFederal level.\nWe are chopping up the statute at each\nstage, correct? We are treating different defendants\ndifferently and different claims differently with\nrespect to the relief that's permissible?\nMR. HO: That would not be our submission,\nYour Honor. If we are talking about the 2000d(7)\nlanguage, all that 2000(d)(7) says if you are a\nprovision prohibiting discrimination, then you get the\nsame remedies against a State that you would get against\nany other nonsovereign defendant. And if we were\nrepresenting the City of Austin, we actually would\nargue -- we think we have a good argument -- that\ndamages would not be available even against the City of\nAustin. Our point here is simply that -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you explain why?\nMR. HO: Sure. I think if I were the City\nof Austin, I would make three arguments. One, the words\n\"appropriate relief\" are in the statute. I think\nthey -- the other one wants to read this as surplusage.\nWe would think that the words \"appropriate relief\"\nshould do something, and we note that there were several\njustices who dissented in West v. Gibson, noting that\nthe words \"appropriate relief\" seemed to indicate\nequitable discretion, or discretion, and therefore\nequitable relief.\nIn addition, we will note that the words\n\"appropriate relief\" in (4)(A) -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But equity permits money\nas well. Equity permits money as well.\nMR. HO: In some limited formats, but it\nwouldn't be compensatory damages in the sense that we\nare talking about in this case.\nAn additional indication would be the fact\nthat the words \"appropriate relief\" aren't just attached\nto the claim. It's attached to both claim or defense.\nAnd of course it makes no sense to say that you can get\nmoney damages by asserting RLUIPA as a defense.\nSo for all those reasons, the City of Austin\nmight actually have a good case that damages aren't\navailable even against them. Of course, it doesn't\nmatter for our case, because the whole point is if the\nCity of Austin were to lose due to Barnes and Franklin,\nwhat we know for sure here is that Barnes and Franklin\nhave nothing, nothing whatsoever, to do with the States.\nIf I may, I would like to spend a little bit\nof time on that issue.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Before you do that, Barnes\nand Franklin were cases involving implied rights of\naction; isn't that right?\nMR. HO: Yes. With the 2000d(7) backdrop,\nbut yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Okay.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And I'm -- this one\nquestion may be covered, but can you give me any\nexamples where States have turned down money under the\nSpending Clause, say we don't want it, the restrictions\nare too great? Does this happen all the time, or ever?\nMR. HO: Where States turn down money?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Where States tell the\nFederal Government: No, thank you, we don't want the\nmoney.\nMR. HO: It's starting to happen in Texas.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Under programs like this?\nMR. HO: I don't -- I can't think of a\nsituation where Texas has turned down RLUIPA Federal\nprison money. But there -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean other States -\nthey say, oh, the liabilities are just too great, we\ndon't want it?\nMR. HO: I'm not aware of any State in the\ncountry that has turned down Federal prison funds. Of\ncourse, if damages were somehow inflicted, if Congress\nchanged the law, perhaps States would start to\nrecalibrate that decision.\nTheir core argument is that we should just\nextend Franklin and Barnes to States. The fatal flaw\nwith that argument is that the very principle on which\nFranklin and Barnes apply -- are premised, that\nprinciple does not apply to sovereigns. When Congress\npasses a cause of action and is silent or ambiguous with\nrespect to the remedies, there is a traditional\npresumption that we apply. Non-sovereigns now expect to\nbe subject to any possible remedy under the sun.\nPrecisely the opposite rule applies to\nsovereigns. We know that for sure as a matter of\nprecedent in Lane, which rejected Franklin as applied to\na sovereign. We also know this as a more fundamental\nbasic principle of sovereign immunity, because when it\ncomes to sovereigns, we have to have not only a clear\nwaiver, but also a waiver that is specific to the remedy\nthat is being sought.\nThese two rules can't be reconciled. You\neither can apply the traditional presumption of all\nremedies, or you apply the other rule that sovereigns\nbenefit from.\nPetitioner claims that maybe a special rule\nshould apply that is unique to the Spending Clause, that\nmaybe that's a way to get around the sovereign immunity\nproblem, but we submit that fundamentally misreads\nFranklin and Barnes, because what's doing the work in\nFranklin and Barnes isn't the Spending Clause. It's\nactually quite the opposite. The Spending Clause is\ncutting back against the traditional presumption.\nIn Franklin -- I will take each case in\nturn. In Franklin, you see pages and pages of analysis\nin section 2 of the opinion, where there is exhaustive\nresearch about Bell v. Hood and the traditional\npresumptions that the Court has applied for decades\nunder any thought of Federal power.\nThe Spending Clause makes an appearance in\nFranklin only at the very end in section 4, invoked by\nthe defense as a potential reason not to apply the\ntraditional presumption. The court, you know, gets past\nthat on the grounds that the traditional presumption is\nso strong that it does provide the clarity for\nnon-sovereigns. It doesn't indisputably apply to\nnon-sovereigns; why not apply it under the Spending\nClause as well?\nThe point, though, is it's not the Spending\nClause that does the work. It is -- it is the\ntraditional presumption. That has even more dramatic\nforce in Barnes v. Gorman. Mr. Gorman would have had a\n$1.2 million punitive damage award that he would have\nbeen entitled to, except for the fact that this was a\nSpending Clause case, and that's precisely why he lost\nthat punitive damage award.\nSo put simply, yes, it could be that under\nBarnes and Franklin, remedies would be clear enough in\nthat one context. The problem is it's not clear enough\nin this context, because sovereigns present a completely\ndifferent constitutional context.\nI want to address very quickly Justice\nSotomayor's question about Ex parte Young. I think you\nwere exactly right that Ex parte -- that our reading\nisn't in any way redundant with Ex parte Young, but I\nwant to note an additional reason why we are not\nredundant.\nWe need to confirm, Congress needed to\nconfirm, that there was in fact a privately enforceable\nright, and that's why our reading in no way renders the\nEx parte Young concept redundant.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What do you do with the\npractical problem that's been brought up that if a State\nis sued, it can release the prisoner, it can transfer\nthe prisoner, and then no relief is appropriate? That\nthe only way that the State is going to take its\nobligation seriously is if it's exposed to compensatory\ndamages?\nMR. HO: If a prisoner is transferred,\nreleased, or the State simply changes its mind and gives\nup and provides the accommodation, in all those\nsituations, the prisoner is no longer suffering from the\ncomplaint of condition. That's why this Court's\nmootness doctrines would apply.\nPut another way, mootness is really just\nanother word for settlement, and we would think that\nsettlement, the State essentially capitulating and\nsaying: Our bad, we should have complied, we should\nhave provided the accommodation, that actually\nvindicates the purpose of RLUIPA, and indeed, it avoids\nthe need for costly litigation to do so.\nI want to mention briefly the U.S. -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What's the inducement to\ndo it more quickly rather than to delay, to remedy the\nwrong faster rather than to delay?\nMR. HO: The reason to do it?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Uh-huh.\nMR. HO: Simply to avoid litigation. I\nmean, the way this works practically on the ground,\nprisons obviously have a lot to deal with, a lot of\nsecurity concerns. They set general policies. They may\nnot be aware that their policy might have an application\nfor a certain individual of a particular faith. If\nthat's brought to their attention and -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's an ideal world,\nthat they'll respond, but there is an allegation that\nsome prisons wait until the eve of the trial after\nonerous discovery on the plaintiff and after enormous\nharm to plaintiffs, physical and otherwise, before they\ncapitulate. So what's the inducement?\nMR. HO: Well, the inducement is to -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: To move faster.\nMR. HO: States are -- States are suffering\nthe litigation costs as well. We are not in the\nbusiness to litigate just because we want to. We have\nplenty of other suits to deal with.\nThis very case, I think, is a good example.\nOnce the prisoner -- once Mr. Sossamon agreed with\nrespect to the salt restriction policy, we immediately\nabandoned that policy, before litigation was even filed.\nWith respect to the U.S. cause of action\nprovision, there was an argument that appropriate relief\nhas to mean damages, because otherwise just take that\ndeclaratory or injunctive relief language and put it\ninto the private cause of action. The reason that\nargument doesn't work is because these are two\nfundamentally different provisions.\nThere is (4)(F) of RFRA, which is the U.S.\ncause of action, and there was (4)(A) of -- I'm sorry,\nof RLUIPA -- and there is (4)(A) of RLUIPA, which is not\njust a private cause of action, but also a defense. So\nagain, if you can imagine sticking in the words\n\"declaratory and injunctive relief\" and putting it right\ninto (4)(A), it doesn't work. It doesn't make any\nsense, because what person asserting a defense would\nseek an injunctive relief? If you take what's -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Let me ask -- get this\ninformation from you. As I understand it, there are\nsome cases that find the words \"appropriate relief\" in a\nstatute to include damages and there's some that don't.\nLet's look at the ones that don't.\nThere is some where it's pretty hard to do\nit because it's in a heading called \"injunction,\" and\nthat's obvious. But there are only two statutes,\nreally, where the courts have ever held in significant\nnumbers that the word \"appropriate relief\" does not\ninclude money damages. One is the IDEA, the\nDisabilities Act, and the other is RFRA.\nIs there anything else that you've come\nacross?\nMR. HO: Those are two great examples.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but are there any\nothers? I mean, I just want to get down on a piece of\npaper what I have to look at.\nMR. HO: Sure. I think there are two -- two\ngreat examples. I would note -\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So you don't\nhave any others, I'm judging from your hesitation.\nMR. HO: No, no -- I would actually -- I\nwould note there are two other cases -\nJUSTICE BREYER: What?\nMR. HO: -- that I would refer you to, and\nof course discussed in the briefs. West v. Gibson which\ntalks about how the words appropriate relief, remedies\nin that context, by definition have no fixed meaning;\nthey can't possibly have fixed meaning. So it has to\nenlarge or contract. And prior to 1991 -- prior to 1991\namendment at issue in that case -- the Court would\nunanimously agreed that appropriate relief would not\nhave included money damages.\nRuckelshaus provides similar guidance, in\nthat I think the phrase was, there was no possible -- no\ncomprehensible or principled meaning to the phrase\n\"appropriate\" as attached to a remedy.\nI will briefly touch on the 2000d-7 issue\nunless there are questions about that. Assuming the\nissue is even preserved for this Court's consideration,\n2000d-7 doesn't allow relief, either. I think there are\na lot of reasons why that would be so, but I think the\nsimplest is simply to acknowledge the difference between\nsection 2 of RLUIPA and section 3.\nSection 2 of RLUIPA is much like the four\nprovisions expressly enumerated in 2000d-7, in that all\nof them have the word discrimination and more\nimportantly turn on the concept of discrimination. A\ndiscrimination is an element of a cause of action under\nsection 2, or under any of the four provisions\nenumerated.\nBy contrast section 3 is not. You can have\ndiscrimination as -- as part of your fact background if\nyou want but it will have nothing whatsoever to do with\nwhether have you a valid section 3 claim or not.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You -- you have already\naddressed this but I think it's their -- the position of\nyour friend on the other side of the case is that with\nthe Spending Clause you have a contract. The State has\nsome extra protection, and therefore we need not be\nquite so strict in -- in construing waivers -- waivers\nof immunity, because you have the contract.\nCan you comment on that argument? And -\nand you might want to say that the Spending Clause is\npotentially so sweeping that the State should have\nspecial protection and we should be particularly careful\nabout the clear statement rule.\nOr do you think the clear statement rule\napplies with equal force whether it's a Spending Clause\nor a direct regulation under say, the Fourteenth\nAmendment?\nMR. HO: I'll try to take each of those\npoints in turn.\nWe don't see anything in the law that\nsuggests that sometimes there is a clear statement rule\nand sometimes there is a super-duper clear statement\nrule. I think there has been some suggestion -- or\nmaybe there has not been any more; I'm not sure; I read\nthe briefs the same way, I think the same way that the\nJustices did. But they seem not to be arguing that any\nmore.\nSo it should be the same standard. I -- I\ncertainly acknowledge that when it comes to the Spending\nClause as you wrote in your dissent in Davis v. Monroe,\nthat the Spending Clause if anything does raise special\nconstitutional considerations as a general matter,\ninasmuch as the Spending Clause could be used to impose\nFederal restrictions on States that they could never\ndream of under Article I otherwise. RLUIPA of course is\na prime example of that.\nBut at the end of the day, the Spending\nClause is not doing any work with regard to providing an\nassumption or presumption of remedies. Again, it's\nexactly precisely the opposite. Franklin and Barnes\nboth articulate that it's the traditional presumption\nthat applies to any exercise of Federal power. That\ntraditional presumption is what's doing the work. The\nSpending Clause if anything is a cut back. So the\nnotion that just invoking the Spending Clause suddenly\nputs States on this fabulously clear notice, I think\njust does not work.\nIf there are no further questions, Your\nHonor?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Ho.\nMR. HO: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Russell, you\nhave four minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN K. RUSSELL\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. RUSSELL: Thank you.\nNearly every argument the state made here\ntoday could have been made by the local governments in\nBarnes. Ranging from the complaint that the language\nlike appropriate relief is too unclear, to the assertion\nthat they were not on notice, that by accepting federal\nfunds they were subjecting themselves to suits. And\nthat's because the local government, like any other\nstate, had the same right to the same clear statement\nrule. Unless this Court is, in fact, going to create a\nproliferation or hierarchy of clear statement rules, the\nPennhurst rule that applies in the Spending Clause\ncontext of local governments applies in exactly the same\nway to a state government under the Eleventh Amendment\nand Barnes' Court construed the express private right of\naction under section 504, which incorporated by\nreference the remedies available under Title XI, which\nthis Court construed to authorize appropriate relief.\nExactly the same remedy that RLUIPA authorizes. And so\nthe state for the first time today has suggested that\nthe city of Austin is not bound by Barnes. I don't see\nhow they can reach that conclusion. Barnes quite\nclearly says that the local government is subject to -\nand is on notice that it has clear, there is a clear\nstatement in every Spending Clause statute that they are\nsubject to a damages remedy so long as they accept the\nfunds because of the contractual nature of the\nobligation. That applies.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Was that contested in\nBarnes?\nMR. RUSSELL: Which part, I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Was the liability for\ncompensatory damages contested in Barnes?\nMR. RUSSELL: No. The question in Barnes is\npunitive.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Just punitive. And there\nis a lot of discussion, the assumption that they were\nliable for compensatory, but it really wasn't litigated,\nwas it?\nMR. RUSSELL: Well, the legal principle this\nCourt adopted to resolve that issue was one that, I take\nit, was not just a principle for that case, but that in\ngeneral, funding recipients are on notice that they are\nsubject to contract remedies and unless this Court is\ngoing to back away from that as a general matter, unless\nthe Court is going to say that Pennhurst applies\ndifferently in the Spending Clause context than it does\nin the sovereign immunity context, I don't see how you\ncan come to a different result in this case.\nJustice Breyer, with respect to RFRA, as far\nas I know, there is only one court of appeals case that\nsays the United States is not subject to suits and that\nwas decided six years after RLUIPA was enacted. With\nrespect to the IDEA, there are a handful of lower courts\ndecisions that say damages are unavailable. Those -\nthey give reasons that are specific to the IDEA and the\nfact that that remedial provision is part of the due\nprocess hearing process there. In general, damages are\nthe quintessential appropriate relief for violations of\ncivil rights, and there is no reason to think that\nCongress was creating in RLUIPA a second class civil\nright that wasn't deserving of a remedy that Congress\nhas provided even against states in every other context.\nWith respect to the state's belief that the Eleventh\nAmendment somehow prefers injunctions over damages\nremedies, as counsel for the United States pointed out,\nthe Eleventh Amendment is no basis for that. It treats\ninjunctions and damages as equally offensive to state\nsovereignty, and in fact, particularly in RLUIPA, where\ndamages are often capped significantly by the PLRA, the\nconcern really ought to be on the states by injunctive\nrelief, which will frequently have a much more\nsignificant effect on the public FISC than a small\ndamages award.\nAnd finally with the state's argument that\nthe words appropriate relief are too inherently\nambiguous to meet any clear statement. Well, this Court\nrejected that kind of argument in West where it\nconstrued appropriate remedy to encompass a damages\nremedy by engaging an ordinary statutory interpretation,\nwhich is entirely appropriate in this context. This\nCourt has repeatedly in cases like Ruckelshaus, for\nexample, like Richlin, relied on how statutes apply with\nrespect to private parties to give meaning to the\notherwise ambiguous word \"appropriate\" in the federal\nstatute waiving the federal government's sovereign\nimmunity.
