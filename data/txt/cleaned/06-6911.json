        "content": "(11:03 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in case 06-6911, Logan v. United States.\nMr. Coad.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD A. COAD\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. COAD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe provision at issue determines which\nconvictions constitute a prior felony for imposition of\nthe Federal firearms ban and its increased penalties.\nIts exemption clause prescribes certain ways in which a\nconviction that otherwise meets that definition is\nnevertheless exempt. Specifically, it looks to a\nState's indication that an offense is deprived of any\ncontinuing effect, such as whether the status of an\noffender's civil rights are the same after a conviction\nas they were before conviction.\nThe issue before the Court is whether the\nstatute should be read to exempt convictions for which\ncivil rights were lost and later regained while at the\nsame time not exempting a conviction for which civil\nrights were never lost, even though both -- in the end,\nboth offenders have their civil rights following their\nconviction.\nCongress's underlying objective in drafting\nthe exemption clause was to ensure that Federal law\nrespected a State's considered judgment that a\nparticular offense should not subject a person to the\nFederal firearms law. The Seventh Circuit's\ninterpretation, which counted convictions for which\nrights were never lost, fails to respect that judgment.\nIt disregards the State's unequivocal indication to the\nFederal statute that an offender is worthy of fully\nparticipating in civic life.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So if you had a\nstatute -- a State like, I'm told, Vermont, that doesn't\ntake away any one's civil rights, not even a first\ndegree murderer's, then that first degree murderer would\nbe equated to someone whose civil rights were taken away\nand then restored.\nMR. COAD: That's correct. And I think that\nthe Government points to Maine as an example where no\noffenders lose their civil rights, but felons lose their\ngun rights and certain misdemeanants also lose their gun\nrights, but get that gun right back. And in States like\nMaine and in Vermont, the \"unless\" clause still applies\nand still precludes those types of convictions. So I\nthink when the Government alleges that there are certain\nanomalies that arise from our interpretation, it is\nsimply not the case, and if they are anomalies that\narise from our interpretation --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: They're not anomalies\nbecause the gun prohibition would cover them, even\nthough they never had their civil rights taken away? Is\nthat -- is that what you're saying?\nMR. COAD: Correct. We have to read the --\nboth clauses, the exemption clause and the unless cause.\nAnd --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Coad, how are -- how\nare civil rights which have been taken away typically\nrestored? What is -- what is the process for restoring\nthem? Just if you don't commit another offense within a\ncertain number of years?\nMR. COAD: It depends on the State. In the\nNACDL lodging that the Court has -- I believe 29 States\nwere identified as having some type of restoration\nprocedures. The majority of those, it is by automatic\noperation of law. So there's no subsequent conditions\nmet by the offender.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but even -- even\nthere I assume the law waits for a certain passage of\ntime, and I would assume that there can be no felony\ncommitted during that interim period or the person's\nsentence has to be served or something? It's ongoing,\nit's prospective. And so restoration has a real\ncomponent, in that -- that is not present in the statute\nthat we're faced with here.\nMR. COAD: Well, I think that there really\nisn't a difference between -- by operation of law, a\nState taking away someone's rights and giving it back or\nallowing a offender to retain civil rights --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it is of -- maybe no\ndifference if the operation of law is 24 hours later.\nMR. COAD: It could be a matter --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I assume that's not\nthe case. I assume that there's in every case, as\nJustice Scalia's question indicates, a certain passage\nof time that takes place.\nMR. COAD: It could be as short as 24 hours.\nIn certain States if a probationer is convicted, rights\naren't taken away. But if a felony offender is\nsentenced to even one day in jail those rights are in\ntheory taken away for that one day and restored to that\noffender the minute he walks out of jail.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you -- you can say,\nhowever, that -- that in the restoring situation, there\nis at least a greater individuation of the -- of the\nState's determination of the -- the trustworthiness of\nthe individual to be -- to be trusted with arms.\nThat is to say well, this person has not\ncommitted an offense within so many years. Or maybe in\nsome States, it may be an individual determination.\nThat's why I asked you the question. Is it ever one by\none, you apply to have them restored?\nMR. COAD: In a minority of States, yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I mean, that's --\nthat's a totally different thing from just a gross\ndetermination by a State that everybody who commits this\ncrime does not lose -- does not lose firearm rights.\nI think it's -- it's -- there's a greater\ndegree of assurance when you're dealing with those\nStates that -- that have some degree of individuation.\nAt least this is an individual who hasn't committed an\noffense for so many years. Or in those States where you\nhave to apply personally, I think they're different\nsituations.\nMR. COAD: I -- I don't think they are, Your\nHonor. As I just mentioned there are States in which a\nday in jail, your rights are lost and restored. And\nthere really isn't any difference between a broad\nlegislative determination by a State --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but I'm\nsuggesting -- and I haven't done the research -- that\nthat's atypical.\nMR. COAD: No, it's not atypical. In 18 out\nof the 29 States identified in the NACDL lodging, rights\nare automatically restored. There's no --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I think it's atypical to\ngive a felon one day in jail.\nMR. COAD: Well, it could be a misdemeanor.\nThere are certainly misdemeanors punishable by more than\ntwo years. In fact two of the misdemeanors at question\nhere that were punishable by more than two years, my\nclient did not serve a day in jail.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But a misdemeanor? I see.\nMR. COAD: So there are misdemeanors --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understand that --\nI understand that it is rare for misdemeanants to lose\ntheir civil rights.\nMR. COAD: It -- that's the assumption. But\nhere we've identified in at least 12 States -- excuse\nme, 16 States misdemeanors punishable by more than two\nyears or felonies, rights are retained.\nSo there are States, for example, Maryland,\nwhere rights are lost for a misdemeanor punishable by\nmore than two years.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But certainly the\nminority approach. In most States if you are convicted\nof a misdemeanor you do not lose civil rights?\nMR. COAD: Absolutely.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your argument, if\naccepted, would essentially weed out, or at least for a\nmajority of the States, weed out subdivision\n(a)(20)(A)(b) -- (a)(20)(B)? In other words, there's\ncoverage under the statute if you are convicted under a\nmisdemeanor and you want to say, well, if your civil\nrights were never taken away, you shouldn't be covered.\nWell, that would mean most misdemeanors aren't going to\nbe covered.\nMR. COAD: Well, in, for example, Maryland,\nthat's not the case. In many -- in 12 States, it is the\ncase.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if I say most\nmisdemeanors aren't going to be covered, it's not an\nanswer to say, well, here's one State where they are\ncovered. It's maybe 49 are not.\nMR. COAD: There really are only 16 States\nin total that have misdemeanors punishable by more than\ntwo years where rights are retained. We're not talking\nabout a very big group to begin with. This certainly is\nan issue on the margins.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Coad, may I ask you a\nquestion that involves the comparison of what, for\nshorthand purposes I'll call Subsection (20) and\nSubsection (33). I take it, it is your position that --\nand (20) applies here. But I take it that it's your\nposition that under (33), your argument could not\nprevail because the language of (33) makes it clear that\nthere's got to be a -- in effect, a revocation of the\nright first, before there can be a restoration within\nthe meaning of that statute?\nYou accept that?\nMR. COAD: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Now that applies as I\nrecall to cases, or primarily to cases, in which there\nhas been a misdemeanor conviction for domestic violence,\nis that correct?\nMR. COAD: It only applies in that instance.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. If your position\nprevails, then Subsection (20), which applies to more\nserious offenses, would in effect be held to provide for\na restoration when, in fact, nothing had been taken\naway.\nWhereas under (33), which applies simply to\na relatively minor set of crimes in relation to (20),\nwould not provide this relief. So you would have the\nanomaly that in the more serious cases, you would win.\nIn the less serious cases, you would lose, because the\nstatute was more onerous. That's anomalous.\nAnd my point is, and this is what I want you\nto comment on, I'll assume for the sake of argument that\nyou're pointing out an anomaly here if you just look at\n(20) alone. But if you look at (20) and (33), by going\nyour way, we're going to create another anomaly, the\nother anomaly being that the more serious offense or the\nmore serious offender gets better treatment than the\nless serious offender.\nSo either way we go, there's going to be\nsome anomaly. Am I right in reading it that way?\nMR. COAD: Well, in part. Congress was\nspecific in 1996 when it enacted the Lautenberg\nAmendment, which was the genesis for the (a)(33) and the\nprohibition on firearms for misdemeanor crimes of\ndomestic violence, it was very -- Congress was very\nspecific that it thought those types of offenders were\nparticularly dangerous. Whereas when you look at\n(a)(20), yes, it generally applies to felons and to\nmisdemeanors punishable by more than two years.\nBut in that group of people, you had varying\ndegrees of seriousness. You could have embezzlement\nconvictions --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But none of them is less\nserious in the classification of the crime than those\ncovered by 33, because 33 simply covers a misdemeanor of\ndomestic violence.\nMR. COAD: I think what we have to look to\nhere is Congress's clear choice in both. In The\nFirearms Owners' Protection Act for (a)(20), Congress\nwanted to provide a broad exemption for individual\nStates deemed to be trustworthy. Whereas in (a)(33),\nCongress was legislating under a very different purpose,\nwhich was to target misdemeanor crimes of domestic\nviolence as particularly dangerous offenders in relation\nto gun possession.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but the State's\njudgment about trustworthiness may very well be the same\nin each case. So the trustworthiness criterion, it\nseems to me, is being -- would be applied differently in\nthe two cases if we take your position.\nMR. COAD: It is. And I think that it is\nokay for the Court to decide that because of the very\nspecific nature of only one type of offender in (a)(33),\nwhich Congress decided they didn't want them to possess\nguns. Whereas in (a)(20), The Firearms Owners'\nProtection Act had a very different purpose. It was to\nexpand gun ownership to even felons who States determine\nto be otherwise trustworthy.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't there another\ndifficulty for you in this statutory comparison that\nJustice Souter has noted? You're argument under (a)(20)\nis that it would be absurd for Congress to take people,\nexempt people, whose rights have been restored, but not\npeople whose rights were never taken away. That is\nexactly what Congress did in (a)(33).\nSo if Congress thought it was all right even\nin albeit in a different context, it seems to me to be\nvery difficult to argue that it is inherently absurd to\ndo it somewhere else.\nMR. COAD: Our absurdity argument you've\nidentified for (a)(20) is more particular than that. It\nis when you look to a particular State, because again\nwe're in the realm here of delegation or at least\ndeferring to States this trustworthy judgment. It is\nwithin a particular State that a less serious offender\nas determined by that State ends up being punished more\nharshly than its more serious offenders.\nWhereas in (a)(33) you don't run into that\nproblem. You accept the anomalies amongst the States.\nThere are varying States -- ways to -- States handle\nthese types of issues. But with (a)(33) you have one\ntype of offender, and a State treats that offender in\none particular way.\nYou aren't comparing State by State. We\ndon't look to Wisconsin versus Louisiana to see an\nabsurdity. We look within a particular State, for\nexample, in Wisconsin to identify an absurdity. There\ncertainly is an acceptance when Congress decided --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Are you sure about that?\n(33) applies to a number of different crimes, it seems\nto me, within every State. Are you sure that in none of\nthose crimes the civil rights are not taken away for\nsome of them, but are taken away for others?\nMR. COAD: The difference here, I think,\nbetween (a)(20) and (a)(33) is that Congress was\nlegislating under the assumption for a felony you're\ngoing to lose your civil rights. Whereas in (a)(33)\nYour Honor is correct. Typically misdemeanors\npunishable by nine months or up to a year, rights are\nnot lost.\nAnd so I think that's the difference Your\nHonor is getting to. I'm not sure if I answered the\nquestion.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, with respect to the\nin-State anomaly that you were talking about, the\ngovernment argues on page 30 -- 29 and 30 of its brief\nthat there really are only a few States where this\nexists, and even in those -- even in the States where it\nexists, there are very significant restrictions on the\nability of the felon to obtain restoration of civil\nrights.\nIs that incorrect?\nMR. COAD: I think it is incorrect in the\nsense that when the government sort of narrowed the\nnumber of States that we identified as being problem\nStates, what it ignores is that the Armed Career\nCriminal Act and the prohibition against firearms goes\nback forever really. You have to look at all of State\nlaw for 1980s, '70s '60s.\nNow, the government argued, well, right now\nthere are only a handful of States. That might be\ncorrect for now. But State laws have changed over the\nyears. And so, we have to look back farther. So, it is\na deeper problem than the government identified.\nAnd I think what's key is that we're talking\nabout Congress separating dangerous offenders from those\nwho are otherwise considered trustworthy by a particular\nState. And this Court has recognized this principal in\nboth Caron and in Small. And when you are excluding\nfrom the protections of the exemption clause offenders\nfor which a State has clearly identified as its most --\nif you want to consider them its most trustworthy\noffenders, that is absurd.\nAnd it certainly offends the societal norm\nthat, all things being equal, we don't punish less\nserious offenders more harshly than we do more serious\noffenders.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, then, maybe the\nproblem was that Congress included misdemeanants who\nwere subject to over a two- year sentence.\nThe point has been made that, on your\nreading, that was a futile gesture, or Congress did one\nthing that was cancelled out by someone else, by another\nprovision. And then they put in this group of\nmisdemeanants who were subject to an over-two-year\nsentence; but most of that group -- and in many states\nall of them -- would not have their civil rights taken\naway.\nSo what is left of the group that was put\nin, misdemeanants with over-two-year sentences?\nMR. COAD: I'm not sure I understand Your\nHonor's question.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What was the point of\nputting that group in the statute as covered by the\nCareer Criminal Act?\nMR. COAD: Well, I -- I think the point is\nthat -- that we can't ignore Congress's clear intent to\nexempt the -- the most trustworthy offenders in a -- in\na given State. And that's --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But how many would be --\ntake a State that doesn't take civil rights away and gun\nrights from misdemeanants.\nWhat effect in that State would this\nlegislation have -- what effect would the provision of\nthis legislation -- that says misdemeanants who are\nsubject to a two-year -- over-two-year term are covered?\nIt wouldn't be covered because the -- because they're\nnot having their civil rights taken away.\nMR. COAD: Well, certainly, the Federal\nstatute set a two-year floor, if you will. But I don't\nthink that we should read the civil-rights-restored\nexception in isolation. I mean we have to make sense of\nCongress's choice to look to civil rights.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But does it make much\nsense, as -- as Justice Ginsburg suggests, to read\n(a)(20)(B) as covering almost nothing?\nI mean, you know, why go to the trouble of\nputting in that provision if it's only going to make a\ndifference in those -- in those very few States where --\nwell --\nMR. COAD: Well, we're talking about very\nfew States overall. I mean even the problem we've\nidentified is certainly a limited one. We're talking\nabout a dozen States, at most.\nAnd so we can say, well, you know, it\nvitiates (B) because only two States are left that fall\ninto (B). But when we're talking about the civil rights\nrestoration provision as applying to rights retained,\nwe're still only talking about a dozen States. So I\ndon't think that that necessarily vitiates (B).\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You phrased\nCongress's intent as allowing an exemption for people\nthe State has found trustworthy. But I don't think\nthat's how this legislative process works.\nYou have additional punishment, and then\nsomebody says: Oh, let's not apply it to people who are\nconvicted of antitrust violations. And you say: Yeah,\nyeah.\nAnd then somebody says: Let's not apply it\nto people whose civil rights have been restored. And\nthey say: Fine.\nAnd then nobody pipes up and says: Well,\nlet's not apply it to people whose civil rights were\nnever taken away.\nIn other words, it's not an intent that is\nnot effectuated. It is just you want the intent to\nreach more broadly.\nMR. COAD: I think that the intent was\nbroad, and Congress was operating under the assumption\nthat rights would generally be lost for those serious\ntypes of offenses that it thought it was covering in\n(a)(20). And I think there is no evidence in the\nCongressional Record --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it's based on a\ncongressional mistake, in other words, about the\nbreadth, but it still doesn't --\nMR. COAD: It is an unthought-of application\nof the statute that -- that leads to absurd results,\nwhich, if we go with the government's interpretation, we\nfrustrate Congress's intent with passing legislation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can we rewrite statutes\nlike that? Because, gee, look at this statute.\nCongress didn't think about this, and it makes a really\nbad result here. So we're going to add this -- this\nnew -- I don't think that that's how we operate.\nMR. COAD: In the context of identifying an\nabsurdity, it certainly strengthens the absurdity\nargument where --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's not that absurd if\nCongress did the same thing in (a)(33).\nMR. COAD: It's -- it's -- it might not be\nabsurd in (a) (33). But Congress, when it showed that\n-- when it chose to limit the concept of restoration, it\nknew how to do so.\nIt was aware of three circuit courts\nevaluating (a)(20) to include rights retained, and so it\ndid it there. But it didn't do it in (a)(20).\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about\nsecurities law violations? (A)(20)(A)says this doesn't\napply if it's an antitrust violation. Now, did\nCongress -- you could say: Well, they would have\napplied it to securities law violations, too. It's a\nbusiness offense. They're not interested in that. So\nwe should read this as applying to securities law\nviolations.\nMR. COAD: I think that's different, because\nthat's a separate type of violation; whereas, here we're\ntalking about an area that Congress clearly identified,\nwhich is how a State treats the civil rights of its\noffenders.\nAnd you're also talking about, in most\ninstances, a broad, legislative determination that a\nState decides: Well, we're not going to take them away,\nor we're going to take them away and give them back; but\nit has nothing to do with the offender. There is no act\nof forgiveness on the part of the State. It is just a\nbroad, legislative rule.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That kind of begs\nthe question for you to say Congress is worried about\noffenders States think are trustworthy. What they\nactually said are, of course, offenders who have had\ntheir civil rights restored.\nMaybe if they focused on the question of\nwhether or not civil rights were taken away in the first\nplace, they would have made a different judgment, as\nthey did, of course, in (a)(33).\nMR. COAD: Well -- and, again, in (a)(33)\nthey did it for a very particular type of offender and a\ndifferent type of offender.\nAnd I think, if you even just look at the\nNACDL lodging, the expansiveness of it and the amount of\ndetail, none of that is in the Congressional Record.\nIt's clear that Congress didn't consider exactly what\nwas going to happen with the civil rights restored\nprovision. They just assumed rights would generally be\nlost for those types of convictions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, isn't -- under\nour precedents, isn't what you just said fatal to your\ncase: In other words, Congress didn't think about this,\nor they made a mistake in thinking about it?\nIn either case it's clear that they didn't\nlegislate with respect to it.\nMR. COAD: I -- I think that they did\nlegislate with respect to civil rights. They just\ndidn't consider that this certain circumstance would\nexist. And it's -- and it's absurd to conclude that a\nless serious offender should be included within the\nFederal ban; whereas, a more serious offender should not\nas the State has determined.\nAnd I think if you look at it this way, too,\nthe -- a State, in order to -- if the Court decides:\nWell, sorry, you're out of luck to civil rights\nretained, if a State wishes to have its less serious\noffenders avoid the Federal ban, it would have to treat\nthem more harshly than it currently does in order for\nthose offenders to be treated better under Federal law.\nAnd I think that that's an absurd notion.\nAnd I also -- I think -- I just want to give\none what I think is the most clear example, which is the\nState of North Dakota. We're not talking about\nmisdemeanors here. We're talking about felony\nconvictions.\nIn North Dakota the State has decided that\nif a felon is not sentenced to imprisonment, then the\nfelon retains his civil rights, and his right to possess\na firearm is restored after a short waiting period.\nWhereas, a felon who is convicted to -- and\nsent to prison, his rights are taken away and later\nrestored. So we have the result here of the complete\nopposite of what North Dakota intended, which is to\ntreat the less serious offender accordingly and treat\nthe more serious offender accordingly.\nAnd that's directly contrary to Congress's\npurpose in passing a firearm owner's protection act,\nwhich was in direct response to this Court's holding in\nDickerson, which ignored a State's expungement of -- of\na conviction, which, again, is another way of a State\nidentifying an individual as trustworthy.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you know, since you\nseem to have looked at it: In North Carolina, for the\nperson whose had his civil rights taken away, is -- is\nthere any mechanism to get them back earlier by -- by\napplying for clemency or a pardon or --\nMR. COAD: In North Dakota -- in North\nDakota you can apply for a pardon, I believe. I'd have\nto check, but I think --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That would be about the\nonly way?\nMR. COAD: Yes. And so you're talking about\nrequiring less serious offenders to seek, in some\ninstances, extraordinary relief in order to get on the\nsame footing as more serious offenders.\nAnd I -- and I would look to point to the\nexample of Wisconsin and the offenses, in particular,\nthat we're talking about here.\nFor a misdemeanor crime as a repeat\noffender, before 2003, it was punishable by up to three\nyears. Now Wisconsin has changed that law, and it is\nonly punishable by two years. So it would be exempt\nunder (b).\nBut Wisconsin allows that type of offender\nto retain civil rights and to retain the rights to\npossess a firearm. And, yet, under the government's\nreading and the Seventh Circuit's reading the Federal\nstatute would ignore that determination by the State and\nwould impose the ban on that individual and require that\nindividual to get on the same footing as a felon to\nreceive a pardon, which are generally not available to\nmisdemeanants but are readily available to -- to felons.\nAnd so you are talking about a less serious\noffender having to seek extraordinary remedies under\nState laws -- and this, I think, is not just unique to\nthe State of Wisconsin -- in order to put themselves on\nthe same footing as a more serious offender as\nidentified by that State.\nAnd if I can reserve the rest of my time?\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Coad.\nMr. Joseffer.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DARYL JOSEFFER\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. JOSEFFER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nWe just have a two points. The first is\nthat restoring a right does not mean leaving it alone,\nand the second is that the statute is not absurd. And\nfor those reasons, Petitioner's prior offenses are\nviolent felonies under the meaning of the act.\nThe statute is clear on point. It says\n\"restored,\" and restoring a right means giving back a\nright that has been taken away. It does not mean\nleaving a right alone. And though words can sometimes\nhave different meanings in contexts, we are aware of no\ncontext in which \"restore\" was \"leave alone.\"\nAnd this is certainly not such a context\nbecause the statute refers to a pardon, a set-aside, an\nexpungement, or a restoration of rights. And the one\nthing that those four items all have in common is that\nthere are ways which a State essentially undoes its\nconviction by relieving a defendant of some or all of\nthe consequences of that conviction.\nGiving back rights that have been taken away\nas part of the conviction has that effect. Simply\nleaving the rights alone does not. And for that reason,\nbecause the statute is so clear, the only question in\nthis case is whether the scope of the statutory\nexemption is so absurd that this Court should take the\nliberty to amend it in order to add an additional\nexemption for defendants who never lost their civil\nrights in the first place. And the Court should not\ndo so for numerous reasons. The first is that the\nabsurd results canon applies only if it is clear that\nCongress could not possibly have intended the result of\nthe plain statutory text.\nAnd as the Chief Justice pointed out, and\nJustice Souter did as well, we know from the subsequent\nenactment of the domestic violence misdemeanor provision\nthat this result is not something that's beyond\nCongress's comprehension. Everyone agrees that Congress\ndid in fact mandate the supposedly alleged absurd\nresults in a closely analogous statute. And that's just\nfatal to the absurdity argument.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Everyone in this case.\nThe point might be arguable in a case that involved that\ndomestic violence statute.\nEveryone in this case. This case doesn't\ninvolve that other provision.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Well, that's true, but my\npoint is just that on the face of the domestic violence\nstatute, and what it says is that the restoration of\nrights exception is limited to circumstances where the\nlaw of the applicable jurisdiction provides for the loss\nof civil rights. So on the face of that provision --\nthe provision says restoration occurs only if civil\nrights have been lost. So it's clear as day that what\nCongress was saying there was it was mandating the\nallegedly absurd result here in situations where rights\nwere not lost.\nAnd what that means is that you can't say\nthat it's impossible that Congress --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There are cases in the\npipeline that don't think it's as clear as day.\nMR. JOSEFFER: There is -- in the context of\nsubsection (33) -- in the context of the domestic\nviolence misdemeanor provision --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.\nMR. JOSEFFER: -- there is one circuit that\nhas applied -- that has basically overlooked the plain\nlanguage there, not even attempted to deal with the\nplain language there. And it's true, and it's found\nthat that exemption was somehow satisfied in a situation\nwhere civil rights were never taken away or restored.\nBut the fact that, you know, a court of appeals reached\nthat conclusion without even attempting to take a look\nat the statutory language doesn't diminish the very\nplain meaning --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What court --\nMR. JOSEFFER: -- of the statutory language.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What court of appeals was\nthat? I didn't get that.\nMR. JOSEFFER: It was the Sixth Circuit in\nthe Burgin case, I believe it's called. And the Sixth\nCircuit there, similar to the First Circuit in\nconstruing this statute, was very clear that it was just\nskipping the language and doing what it thought Congress\nwould have wanted to do if it had thought about it.\nBut the plain language in the domestic\nviolence provision is unmistakable because it expressly\nrefers to civil rights --\nJUSTICE ALITO: If Congress thought about\nthe problem, what reason could they have for saying that\nthe firearms ban should apply to someone who never lost\nhis or her civil rights, but not -- but would not apply\nto someone who had civil rights restored?\nAutomatically, let's say. Automatically and within a\nshort period of time. What rationale reason could there\nbe for doing that?\nMR. JOSEFFER: The reason is that Congress\nwas balancing two policies. On the one hand, what it\nwas looking to do in this provision was to defer to a\nState's decision to essentially undo its conviction.\nAnd that applies where rights have been taken away and\nrestored, but does not have anything to do with rights\nbeing left alone.\nOn the other hand, and a couple of Justices\nalready made this point as well, Congress wanted to\napply the Federal firearms disability to serious\nfelonies, to felonies punishable by more than two years\nof imprisonment, but if Congress had included a\nretention of rights exemption, that would have all but\ngutted the statutory prohibition on serious\nmisdemeanants possessing firearms. And that's why,\nconsistent with Congress's desire to get tough on\nfirearms and impose the firearms disability on serious\nfelons, it couldn't include a retention of rights\nexemption.\nSo it's a situation where Congress had a\ncouple of different policies. It clearly pursued both\nof them, and as a result, there is a seam, there is this\nanomaly that Petitioners have pointed to, but that's an\ninevitable consequence of Congress's desire to balance\nthese two policies. And because that's an inevitable\nand probably foreseen result of Congress's intent, it\ndoesn't call Congress's intent into question.\nIn addition, the scope of the anomalies here\nis really quite minor. There are -- if you -- read\naccording to its plain language, there are a few States\nin which the Petitioner -- the anomaly the Petitioner\npoints to occurs. It's currently about three States.\nIt used to be about six States.\nOn the other hand, if you take Petitioner's\nview, you create anomaly in a couple other States, which\nJustice Ginsburg referred to, whereby the most serious\noffenders, first-degree murderers, would not be treated\nas having their civil rights restored.\nBut in all of these States, the effect of\nthe anomaly is greatly reduced by the firearms exception\nto the restoration of rights exemption because in --\nPetitioner's example was North Carolina, where he said\nthat a more serious offender would be able to get\nfirearms rights back promptly. I guess what he meant by\n\"shortly\" was that the offender could get them back 10\nyears after completing the sentence if he had not\ncommitted further crimes.\nSo the incidence of this issue is really not\nvery significant. Instead, the real significance to\ndeparting from the plain statutory language would be to\ngut the statute as applied to misdemeanors punishable by\ntiers of imprisonment, which is contrary to Congress's\nclearly expressed intent by including such misdemeanors\nwithin the scope of the statute.\nPetitioner has also argued at length that\nwhat Congress was looking at here was trustworthiness.\nDid the State find the defendant trustworthy to possess\nfirearms? But we know, and this Court explained in\nCaron, that that's not what this provision goes to\nbecause the whole point of the Federal firearms laws is\nto prohibit firearms possession in some circumstances\nwhere at least some States were permitting it.\nSo the fact that a State would let a person\npossess firearms is not relevant here. Instead,\nCongress was not deferring generally to the States'\ntrustworthiness views but instead was looking to defer\nto their specific determination to essentially undo\ntheir own conviction. If a State wanted to undo its own\nconviction, Congress was willing to give effect to that,\nbut that's the only thing it was deferring to.\nAnd it also bears emphasis that Congress --\nJUSTICE ALITO: I can understand that\nargument where there's an individualized determination\nabout each -- each defendant, but I don't quite\nunderstand it when it's a blanket restoration of rights.\nMR. JOSEFFER: Right. That's --\nJUSTICE ALITO: It's a formal difference\nmatter. There's no substance to it, is there?\nMR. JOSEFFER: Well, there's still substance\nto the fact that rights were, in fact, taken away and\nwere, in fact, restored, as opposed to someone having\nhis rights all the time. There's certainly a\nsubstantive legal difference there, but as a practical\nmatter, I mean one reason that Congress may have decided\nnot to distinguish between automatic and individualized\nrestorations of rights is simply that it didn't want to\nattempt to micromanage the States in how they would go\nabout choosing to do a pardon or a restoration of\nrights. I mean -- and -- with respect to restoration or\nrights. Louisiana automatically pardons most first-time\noffenders. As this Court explained in Dickerson, of the\nStates that expunge convictions, many of them do it\nautomatically as well. And so Congress from -- because\nof what it was doing here was advocating Dickerson, was\npresumably aware of these points this Court had made in\nDickerson regarding the great variance in the laws and\nthe fact some of it was automatic.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Louisiana\nautomatically pardons all first-time offenders?\nMR. JOSEFFER: Most.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Most?\nMR. JOSEFFER: Most, and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not murderers, I assume?\nMR. JOSEFFER: I don't -- I think that they\nare not automatically pardoned.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, that's --\nMR. JOSEFFER: In fact, this practice is\nenshrined in the Louisiana Constitution.\nBut in any event, I think the point is just\nthat Congress was going to defer to the States' decision\nto effectively undo their convictions, but was not going\nto micromanage how the States did it. But the most that\none might determine from that point of view is that if\nyou think that Congress was really thinking about an\nindividualized determination, then what that would mean\nis that some offenders who get automatic restorations\nare currently essentially catching a break from the fact\nthat they got an automatic one. But the fact that the\nplain language of the statute may give someone of the\noffenders a break is no reason to depart from the plain\nlanguage of the statute, to give other offenders a break\nthat Congress clearly did not intend.\nAnd, Justice Scalia, you asked about what's\na typical restoration process. At the time the statute\nwas enacted in 1986, of the States that did\nrestorations, about half of them did it automatically\nand about half of them required individualized\nconsideration before returning at least one of the\nrights.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And in the automatic\ncategory, I take it, it's usually after the sentence has\nbeen served?\nMR. JOSEFFER: There's some variance. In\nfact, the 50 States follow 49 different approaches to\nrevoking and restoring civil rights. So there's an\nexception to just about anything in this area, which\nagain underscores why anomalies are inevitable, and\ntherefore don't really call Congress's intention into\nquestion.\nBut the standard practice is that after a\ndefendant has finished serving his sentence, and that\nwould include not just maybe one day in jail but also\nthe probationary period following that -- but after the\ndefendant has finished serving his sentence, if\nrestoration is automatic, it will either be at the\nconclusion of the sentence or at some time period\nthereafter, which in some instances can be significantly\nthereafter.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: At any time in\nconsideration of these statutes did Congress consider,\nto your knowledge, perhaps making the test be the length\nof the actual sentence served rather than eligibility\nfor -- it seems to me one normal way of differentiating\nbetween those who are most trustworthy and those less\ntrustworthy would be by looking at the actual sentence\nserved.\nMR. JOSEFFER: I think that's true. I guess\nthere are two parts to that. One is that, I mean, the\nprovisions at issue here about the length of sentence\nserved, were in the statute before this amendment was\nmade. They were in the statute before 1986. So they're\nnot directly relevant to the intent of the '86 Congress.\nBut I'm not aware of -- I mean, of legislative history\npredating 1986 in which Congress looked at the length as\nopposed to the maximum term. And also, one thing that\nreflects is that what Congress was not doing here was\njust looking to defer to the States' trustworthiness\ndeterminations as this Court explained in Caron. The\nwhole point of this law was to get tougher on gun crime\nthan many of the States were at the time.\nIf the Court has no further questions?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Joseffer.\nMr. Coad, you have three minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD A. COAD\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. COAD: Thank you, Your Honor.\nFirst I would like to respond to my\ncolleague's last point. He speculates that -- about\nlegislate history and I think actually it is the exact\n-- exact opposite. Congress enacted a Firearm Owners\nProtection Act to broaden exemptions to the gun control\nact. There's no question about that, and it did so in a\nway that would respect State law decisions about who\nshould be eligible for exemptions.\nAnd secondly, I was asked about -- by the\nCourt about substantive difference between automatic\nrestoration of rights versus a State automatically\nallowing an individual to retain rights. In many\ninstances there's no passage of time. There are no\nadditional conditions that an offender must meet in\norder to get that restoration. It is just as automatic\nas not having them taken away in the first instance.\nAnd I think my last point to the Court: If\nthe meaning of restored in (a)(20) is so clear, as the\nGovernment says it is, then I don't know why Congress\nwould need to have added language to (a)(33) to clarify\nthat they were limiting that concept to only rights that\nwere taken away and restored.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Coad.\n"
