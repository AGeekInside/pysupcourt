        "content": "(11:05 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in Wachovia Bank v. Schmidt.\nMr. Frey.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. FREY\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. FREY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe question in this case is whether, for\npurposes of Federal diversity jurisdiction, a national\nbank is a citizen of every State where it has a branch,\nor perhaps where it has any physical presence, or only\na citizen of the State where it was chartered or, if\ndifferent, where its main office is located.\nThe question turns on the meaning of the word\nlocated in 28 U.S.C. 1348, which states that national\nbanking associations shall be deemed citizens of the\nStates in which they are respectively located.\nNow, before turning to the --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Now, that was enacted, was\nit not, in 1887?\nMR. FREY: That's correct. The law --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And hasn't the -- the word\nhasn't changed --\nMR. FREY: It hasn't changed.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- in all those years.\nAnd there were no interstate branches in\n1887, I assume.\nMR. FREY: I'm -- I'm not aware of any.\nThere may have been a few State banks that had\ninterstate branches, although they would have been\ncitizens only of the State of their incorporation.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: So it's a little hard to\nlook for congressional intent.\nMR. FREY: Well, it -- it -- I don't believe\nit is, Your Honor, because of the sequence of statutes.\nYou have to start with the 1882 statute and what the\nSupreme Court has said.\nBut -- but I'd like to make a preliminary\ncomment before I turn to the substantive points here,\nwhich is that nobody has ever suggested, not the Fourth\nCircuit and not the respondent, any reason why Congress\nwould want the result reached by the Fourth Circuit, in\n-- in 1887 or in 1948 or any other relevant time, to\nuniquely restrict the access of national banks to\nFederal diversity jurisdiction.\nIndeed, the suggestion is incongruous that\nCongress would want to do that. National banks are,\nafter all, federally created and federally regulated\ninstrumentalities.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Congress makes mistakes\nsometimes.\nMR. FREY: Yes, they -- they might have --\nthey might have done that.\nAnd I -- I acknowledge that this\nconsideration is not controlling, standing by itself,\non the case. That is, if the statute plainly and\nunambiguously called for such an implausible outcome,\nthen we might have a debate about whether an absurd\noutcome that the plain language calls for is one that\nshould be enforced. But this is a background\nconsideration that I don't think the Court can put\naside or deem irrelevant to the outcome of this case.\nSo the key holding of the Fourth Circuit was\nthat the word located has an unambiguous meaning, and\nit's -- that it's the one adopted by the Fourth Circuit\nmajority and not by the Fourth Circuit dissent, the\nFifth Circuit, the Seventh Circuit, the Comptroller of\nthe Currency, or anybody else.\nThe battle of the dictionary definition seems\nto me plainly inconclusive. The biggest problem with the\ndefinitions is that they are cast in terms of the\nlocation of tangible physical things, a table, a lake,\na piece of land; whereas we're dealing here with an\nincorporeal abstraction, a corporation, the location of\nwhich is not necessarily tied to any particular\nphysical presence.\nBoth we and the Government have given Ford\nMotor Company as an example in the brief. If you ask\nsomebody where is Ford Motor Company located, I venture\nto say that most people would say Michigan. But when\nyou stop and think about it, it's possible that it\ncould be also located every place where it has\nmanufacturing facilities or sales outlets.\nThe only dictionary definition that I've seen\nthat is specific to the location of an incorporeal\nentity, and specifically a bank, is the one that's\ncited in the Chase -- JPMorgan Chase amicus brief,\nwhich was taken from the 1951 edition of Black's Law\nDictionary, roughly contemporaneous with the enactment\nof current section 1348, which states that a bank is,\nquote, located, close quote, in the place specified in\nits organization certificate.\nThe term also appears many places in the\nNational Bank Act, sometimes meaning a specific\nheadquarters location and sometimes meaning any place\nwhere there are physical facilities.\nAnd the Court -- this Court itself has given\nlocated -- the word located various meanings. In the\nBougas case, which is much discussed in the briefs, the\nCourt said that the term has no enduring rigidity, and\nthe Court did not base its decision on the inherent or\nnatural or ordinary meaning of the word located.\nIn Federal Power Commission v. Texaco, which\nis 377 U.S. 33, the Court interpreted the words in the\nvenue statute for appeals from Federal Power Commission\ndecisions which said the appeal could be taken to the\nplace where the company seeking review was located.\nTexaco said, well, we have substantial facilities in\nthe Tenth Circuit. This matter that is the subject of\nthis arose in the Tenth Circuit. And the Court looked\nat the statute and it said, no, located means where --\nyour place of incorporation.\nNow --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, a -- a\nnational bank charter typically lists the national\nbank's principal place of business. Correct?\nMR. FREY: Well, it lists --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Its main office.\nMR. FREY: -- it lists the -- the charter\nlocation, where it's established. And until 1994, that\nwould have been synonymous with its principal place of\nbusiness.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But isn't that\namended if the principal place of business changes?\nThe charter is amended.\nMR. FREY: You can -- just like a corporation\ncould reincorporate in another State, a bank could move\nits main office, which I think is the term that's used\nin 12 U.S.C., section 30.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So this would put\nnational banks in a favored position compared to\ncorporations --\nMR. FREY: No.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- which are citizens\nof their State of incorporation and their -- their\nprincipal place of business.\nMR. FREY: Well, if there's -- I don't know\nwhether there's a divergence between principal place of\nbusiness and -- and main office, which is what the\nComptroller, I think, considers the equivalent of the\nplace of incorporation. It is possible.\nBut remember, at the time all of these\nstatutes were enacted, there would have been complete\nparity because principal place of business was not --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: My point is just --\nMR. FREY: A corporation was not a citizen of\n-- of its principal place of business, only of its\nState of incorporation. So there would have been total\nparity in 1882, 1887, 1911, 1948.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: A good bit of your\nargument is that your friend's interpretation on the\nother side would put national banks in a disfavored\nposition.\nMR. FREY: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your argument would\nput them in a favored position compared to a typical\ncorporation.\nMR. FREY: Well, not necessarily. You could\ninterpret located to include principal place of\nbusiness. This issue doesn't arise in this case\nbecause what -- what you have to decide is whether the\nfact that the bank has a branch in South Carolina means\nthey're located in South Carolina. South Carolina is\nnot Wachovia's principal place of business or --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what would -- what\nwould be your view? I know the question is not before\nus, but suppose we had a question like the principal\nplace of business.\nMR. FREY: Our -- our view is that it's the\nmain office. I would defer somewhat to my colleague\nfrom the Government who can speak for the Comptroller\non this question, but our view would be that it's the\nmain office.\nAnd -- and I think it's important to\nunderstand that when we're interpreting these statutes,\nat every time when one of these -- when the statute was\nreenacted, there would have been total parity between\nour definition of located. There would have been one\nplace for a national bank. There would have been one\ncitizenship for a State bank.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Frey, in practice, is\nthere, as there often is for a corporation, a\ndivergence between those two places? You have many\ncorporations incorporated in Delaware with their\nprincipal place of business, say, in Michigan.\nIn the case of a national bank, is there that\nsimilar difference that what you call its main office\nor where it's chartered is different from where it has\nits principal place of business?\nMR. FREY: It's possible that there would be\nfor some banks, but the main office is the place that\n-- that the Comptroller that -- that is in their\narticles of association, which can be amended to change\nthe main office, and it's approved by the Comptroller\nof the Currency. And -- and they can move their main\noffice.\nWhether it -- all -- I know that in the case\nof Wachovia, there is no divergence. North Carolina is\nits main office and is its principal place of business.\nBut I can't speak for everything.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you would say that\nthe main office is the place where they're established.\nIs that what you think the word established refers to?\nMR. FREY: No. I'm not sure what the word\nestablished means. That would be different. As the\nCourt said in Bougas, it wasn't going there, and I\ndon't know that we need to go there today. Established\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I -- I think we need\nto go there, at least -- it seems strange to me that\nyou have two different words and if, indeed,\nestablished means the same thing that you're telling us\nlocated means, I'm not going to agree with you. I\nmean, they're -- they're two different words --\nMR. FREY: Well, established could, I\nsuppose, mean the place of the original charter\nlocation, and located could mean the place where --\nwhere the main office is today. They could mean\ndifferent things.\nRemember that at every -- at every enactment\nof this statute, there was no difference between\nestablished and located. The terms had no different\napplication because a national bank had only one\nlocation, which was the place where it was established.\nSo as a practical matter, there was total parity with\nState banks because up until 1958 a corporation was a\ncitizen only of the -- its place of incorporation, and\nthere was total parity with national banks because they\nwere -- they were confined to their original State.\nThey could not branch outside their State until 1994.\nSo we are interpreting statutes that were passed for the\npurpose of achieving parity and at a time when they\nsucceeded in achieving parity.\nAnd -- and the Chief Justice's question and\n-- and your question suggest that today, with the\nchanges in the map of interstate banking, you might\nhave some small lack of total overlap between State\nbanks or other corporations, on the one hand, and\nnational banks. But that is not a reason to say that\nnational banks are citizens of every place where they\nhave any physical presence.\nAnd one of the problems with the Fourth\nCircuit's reading is that it injects substantial\nambiguity into the question of where a bank is located.\nIt's -- the Fourth Circuit said branches, but what\nabout where it has an office that's not a branch? What\nabout where it stores -- where it has warehouses that\nstore its records? What about where it has employees?\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Or an ATM.\nMR. FREY: What about where it has an ATM.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, there I think the\nFourth Circuit said we -- we had a case that resolved\nthat.\nMR. FREY: Excuse me?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think the Fourth Circuit\nsaid that we had a case that -- that answered that\nquestion, not a case involving this particular\nprovision --\nMR. FREY: I don't -- I don't recall.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- but a case involving\nanother provision of -- of the banking laws.\nMR. FREY: I don't recall that. I don't\nrecall that, but I think the -- I think the question is\nnot at all clear where -- where a bank would be located\nif it's in a State where it has facilities, property,\nor employees but not a branch. And as you said in your\nconcurring opinion in Sisson against Ruby, it's not a\ngood idea to have a jurisdictional statute -- reading\nof a jurisdictional statute that creates ambiguities.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Frey, remind me of the\nState bank. A State bank is, for Federal diversity\npurposes, a citizen of two -- two places or only one?\nMR. FREY: It depends on how it does\nbusiness. A State bank is a corporation and it is --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So it would be the --\nMR. FREY: -- the same as any corporation.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- its place of\nincorporation and --\nMR. FREY: Same as any corporation.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- principal place of\nbusiness if it's different.\nMR. FREY: So in 1958, under -- if -- if you\nfollow the Chief Justice's question, in 1958 when it\nbecame possible for corporations to be citizens of more\nthan one State, maybe the meaning of this statute that\nwas passed in 1948 changed. I -- I don't think that\nmakes sense. We're -- we're trying to interpret a\nstatute that Congress passed in 1948. At that time,\nthere was complete parity. The fact that in 1958\nCongress perceived a problem which is not a problem\nwith national banks, where there was a divergence, a\nserious divergence, between the place of incorporation\nand the principal place of business that Congress said\nwe've got to deal with this problem. And so they\namended section 1332 in 1958 to deal with that\nparticular problem. That is not a problem that affects\nnational banks. So there's been no occasion. When\nthey enacted Riegle-Neal, there was no -- no need for\nthem to change --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but you're --\nyou're asking us to interpret a statute that they\npassed in light of events subsequent to the passage of\nthe statute.\nMR. FREY: No.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're saying that\nwhen they passed it, national banks were only in one\nplace. Well, they were only located in one place --\nMR. FREY: That's true.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- even if you adopt\nthe reading of the Fourth Circuit.\nMR. FREY: Well, let me -- let's -- let's go\nback and -- because Justice O'Connor started me off,\nand I -- I don't want to fail to get to her question.\nThe first statute was the 1882 statute. The\n1882 statute unambiguously stated that the jurisdiction\nshall be the same as and not other than the\njurisdiction for suits by or against banks not\norganized under any law of the United States. So the\n-- the purpose of Congress was to -- to give national\nbanks access to diversity jurisdiction on the same\nbasis as State banks. And that -- in the Leather\nManufacturers Bank case, that was recognized by the\nCourt.\nThen in 1887, Congress went to a different\nwording totally. It injected the word location. And I\n-- I should point out that the 1882 statute was in the\nBank Act and the 1887 statute was in the Judiciary Act.\nSo it was -- it's not clear what they thought they\nwere doing with the 1882 statute when they adopted the\n1887 statute.\nBut it is clear what this Court said they\nwere doing in the Petri case. This Court said no\nreason is perceived why it should be held that Congress\nintended that national banks should not resort to\nFederal tribunals as other corporations and individual\ncitizens might. It then said further on, on page 651\nof 142 U.S., the clause was intended to have and must\nreceive the same effect and operation as that of the\nproviso to the fourth section of the act of July 12,\n1882. And finally, they close by saying, no\nlimitation in the regard of access to Federal\ndiversity jurisdiction was intended.\nThen we have the 1911 codification, and in --\nand after 1911, we have several Supreme Court cases,\nincluding the Mitchell case, which again says that the\ncodification worked no change. It says, the Court held\nthat as to suits with -- within the specified\nexceptions, national banks were, by the acts of 1882\nand 1887, put on the same basis in respect of\njurisdiction as if they had not been organized under an\nact of Congress.\nAnd then in 1948, you have the reenactment or\nthe codification of the current judicial code, not\nintended to work any change in the meaning of the\nstatute.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you think a lawyer has\nto go back, in order to advise a client, and -- and\nwhen he has a word -- two words in -- in a provision --\none, established; the other, located -- he has to go\nback and figure out every one of these reenactments and\ninquire into, you know, what Congress meant at the\ntime?\nMR. FREY: Well, I don't think it's so\ndifficult to --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He -- he has -- he has a\nstatute that says established in one part, located in\nanother, and he has a Supreme Court case, which I\nmentioned, but you apparently disregard, which is\nBougas, which --\nMR. FREY: I don't disregard it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, which -- when I asked\nabout it, you -- you drew a blank. I mean, that's the\ncase I was referring to. And in -- which had a similar\nprovision using the word established and located and\nsaid that established meant one thing and said what in\nthis case it meant.\nNow, it was for a different purpose, to be\nsure, but if I were a lawyer looking up -- and it --\nyou know, it dealt with banks. And if -- if I were a\n-- a lawyer, I would have -- I would have said, gee,\nthere it is. The Supreme Court --\nMR. FREY: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- says where you have\nestablished and located in -- in the same provision,\nlocated means where they have a branch.\nMR. FREY: Well, it didn't say that\nestablished meant something different. It said it\nwould not consider what established meant. And in\ndeciding what located meant, it didn't say located had\nsome obvious meaning. It said it was going to look at\nthe purpose, and the purpose was the convenience of the\nbank.\nAnd what -- what the Court did in Bougas was\nto place national banks in a position of parity with\nState banks with regard to venue. State banks could be\nsued anyplace they had a branch, and under Bougas,\nnational banks could be sued.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That may well be.\nMR. FREY: What the Fourth Circuit has done\nis destroy --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and whatever --\nwhatever the outcome, whether it was equality or non-\nequality, and whatever the rationale, whether it was\nthe purpose to be served or something else, the Court\nheld that the word located in a banking statute which\nhad both the words established and located in it --\nMR. FREY: But --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- meant where they have a\nbranch. And -- and that seems to me a very persuasive\nindication for a lawyer --\nMR. FREY: I think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- who's trying to figure\nout how to advise his client.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In a venue statute, as\nopposed to a subject matter jurisdiction statute, the\nvenue means where, where -- what particular court.\nSubject matter jurisdiction is which court system.\nThey're entirely geared to entirely different things.\nMR. FREY: Entirely different things and\nentirely different concerns. And I don't think --\nwell, I'd like to think that most lawyers would go\nbeyond the logic that Your Honor has suggested, would\nlook at what the Supreme Court had said in its cases\ninterpreting section 1348 and its predecessors, and\nwould look at the mode of analysis that the Supreme\nCourt used in Bougas, and applying that mode of\nanalysis, the Fourth Circuit result is wrong.\nI'd like to reserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Srinivasan, we'll hear now from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\nFor purposes of determining its State\ncitizenship under 28 U.S.C. 1348, a national banking\nassociation is located in the State in which its main\noffice is found, not every State in which it may\nmaintain a branch office or other form of physical\npresence.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about its principal\nplace of business if it's different from its main\noffice?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: The --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Principal place of\nbusiness.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: We -- we don't think that a\nnational banking association is a citizen of a State in\nwhich its principal place of business is found, insofar\nas that might be different from the State in which its\nmain office is located.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So the main office is it,\nlike 1332 before the '58 amendment.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: That's right, Justice\nGinsburg, and in part, that's because of the historical\nchronology. The word located was first used in 1887\nand the current version of section 1348 was enacted in\n1948, which was 10 years before the concept of\nprincipal place of business had any jurisdictional\nsalience. That was the first time that Congress --\nthis was in 1958 -- that Congress enacted a specific\nprovision dealing with corporate citizenship, and\nthat's the first time that we see the concept of\nprincipal place of business having relevance in the\njurisdictional context.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What did the Government\nargue in Bougas? I -- I didn't look up the briefs in\nthe case. Did the Government appear in -- in that\ncase?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: No.\nBut -- but Bougas I think is -- shouldn't\ngovern the resolution of this case for several reasons,\nand one that I think is salient with respect to the\npoints that you were raising earlier, Justice Scalia,\nis that it really is a happenstance of codification\nthat the terms, established and located, appear\ntogether in section 1348. The paragraph that contained\nestablished and the paragraph that contained located\nwere enacted in separate years. They concerned\nseparate subjects, and they were always treated as\nseparate provisions until the recodification of the\njudicial code in 1911. And that recodification stated\nin its explicit text that the provisions were -- were\nto continue to carry the substantive meaning that they\nhad beforehand and that the arrangement of the\nprovisions were purely -- was purely for convenience.\nAnd so I don't think it's fair to say that because\nestablished and located happen to appear in the same\nprovision of section 1348 that they necessarily should\nbe given different meanings.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: In Bougas, they were there\nto -- they were put in originally in the original\ndrafting. They were paired, right?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Just about, Justice Souter.\nI -- the -- the paragraph containing established was\nin there in the 1863 National Banking Law, and -- and\nthe provision containing located was added to that\nprovision in 1864. So the first time that they both\nappeared, they did appear together, which is another\ndistinction from the circumstance that the Court faces\nwith respect to 1348.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could I -- could I\nget your position again on exactly 1348? You say main\noffice is where the bank is located?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: That's right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about if that's\ndifferent from the national bank charter?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: It would still be the main\noffice. The -- the national bank charter -- I think\nit's called the organization certificate under the\nterms of the statute -- is a historic document that\ndocuments where the national bank's initial main office\nwas located. But, of course, a national bank can\nrelocate its main office under 12 U.S.C. 30. And we\nthink that when a national bank relocates its main\noffice, it's the current main office that's\ncontrolling.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even if its charter\nsays something else.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Even if its charter says\nsomething else.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Because I gather you\ndon't have to amend your charter.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: You don't. In fact -- in\nfact, there's no provision for amending the charter.\nWhat you have to do is amend your articles of\nassociation if you move the main office -- if you move\nthe main office outside the city or town in which the\nmain office previously was found.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How -- how do you\ntell where a bank's main office is?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, as I was saying, you'd\nhave to amend the articles of association if you move\nto a different city. So you could look at the articles\nof association, and those are on file with the\nComptroller. So I think where a national bank's main\noffice is located is readily identifiable and it's\npublicly available information.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So its main office\nwould be -- be where its articles of incorporation say,\neven if it has 90 percent of its branches in another\nState?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: That's right. It's -- it's\n-- the main office is -- is controlled by where the\nnational bank designates its main office to be.\nNow, it's a little bit different than\ncorporations in the following sense, that with the main\noffice of a national bank, it at least has to be a\nplace where the bank is conducting the business of\nbanking. That's required by the statutes. Whereas\nwith a corporation, you could conceivably have a\nsituation where they were incorporated in one State --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you can have these\nbanks -- I don't know -- presumably a State that they\nbear little or no relation to could offer some\nfavorable treatment of them and they could suddenly\nsay, you know, Wachovia's main office is in Wyoming or\nsomething, even though it doesn't -- it has one -- it\nhas one ATM or one branch there. And that would be all\nright with you? That would be where -- where they were\nlocated?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: That's right, for --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That would be the\nonly place that they were located.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: For purposes of this\nprovision. There -- there are other provisions where\nthe word located encompasses branch locations, but for\npurposes of this provision, we think location is\nsynonymous with main office.\nAnd I would say that the court of appeals\nassumed in its opinion, by the way -- and this is at\npages 8a and 11a of the -- of the petition appendix --\nthat it's rarely going to be the case that a national\nbank's main office will -- will deviate from the\nnational bank's principal place of business.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If a national bank changes\nits main office, it must get the approval of the\nComptroller to do so?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: It -- in -- in some\ncircumstances, yes. If it changes its main office --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What sort of circumstance?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: -- the same city --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Does it say -- just to take\nthe Chief Justice's example, say they decided they want\nto open a branch in -- just a -- just a one-window\nbranch in Wyoming and make that the main office. Would\nthere have been any reason why they couldn't do it?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: No, because it's a -- it's\nsimply a product of where the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So in other words, the --\nthe Comptroller would automatically approve such a\nchange.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: I -- I think so. I don't --\nI'm not aware of any criterion by which -- substantive\ncriterion by which the Comptroller limits where a\nnational banking association could designate its main\noffice to be.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Does the term, main office,\nhave any significance for -- for any purpose other than\nthis jurisdictional issue in this case?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Yes. It -- it has\nsignificance in a number of provisions. For example,\nit determines where the bank is located with respect to\nwhat interest rates it might charge under 12 U.S.C. 85,\nand that's an issue that this Court confronted a few\nterms ago in the Smiley case and also in the Marquette\ncase.\nBut there are other provisions that refer to\nthe -- the location of a national banking association,\nand in all of those we think, as a starting point, the\nlocation would be the main office, and in some\nsituations, it would also encompass branch locations.\nFor purposes of this provision, we don't\nthink that the location would encompass branch\nlocations. And one reason, in particular, is because\nthe subject that section 1348 deals with is the State\ncitizenship of a national banking association. And the\nconcept of citizenship has always been thought to\nrequire a distinctive association with a State and, in\nparticular, has been thought to require something more\nthan mere physical presence in a State. That's always\nbeen the rule with respect to national persons, and of\nparticular significance, it's always been a rule with\nrespect -- it's always been the rule with respect to\ncorporations. And Congress defined national banking\nassociations as, quote, a body corporate, close quote,\nin 12 U.S.C. 24.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you another\nquestion that is really a follow-up on the Chief\nJustice's earlier -- for a private corporation, it's\nlocated both where it's incorporated and where it has\nits principal place of business. Is it your view that\na national bank may have two parallel locations or just\none?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: It -- it could have a main\noffice that's different from what one would construe to\nbe its principal place of business under the test that\napplies to corporations under 1332(c), if -- if that's\nwhat you're asking, so that factual circumstances --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It could -- it could have a\n-- it could be a citizen of the State where its -- its\npapers say its main office is and also the State where,\nin fact, its main office is.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: No. Well, I -- well, I\ndon't -- in fact, its main office is -- is a creature\nof statutory designation, but I think what --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, I should use a\ndifferent word. Where its principal place of business\n--\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Principal place of business.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- they have a big\noperation in New York and a -- and a Delaware\nheadquarters in -- in Dover.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: No. Our view is that it\nwouldn't be a citizen of a State simply by virtue of\nthe fact that it has its principal place of business\nthere.\nNow, I would say, though, that it's not an\nopen and shut case because the Court in a case that\nspecifically raised the issue, which of course this one\ndoesn't, it could construe 1332(c), which is the\nprovision that deals with corporations generally, as\nalso applying to national banking associations insofar\nas national banking associations are, after all,\ncorporations.\nBut we think the better reading is that the\nspecific governs the general, and therefore, that\nsection 1348, which specifically deals with the\nquestion of national bank citizenship, would govern\nover the 1332(c) which more generally deals with the\nquestion of corporate citizenship.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And if we did -- if we did\ninterpret 1332(c) that way, there wouldn't be any\nfavoritism for national banks.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: That's right. It would\nentirely eliminate favoritism.\nBut I think it's important to note that the\ntype of favoritism that we're discussing is the\npotential inequity as between one State and two States;\nwhereas under the court of appeals' interpretation of\nsection 1348, you could have an inequity that -- and\nit's not farfetched to think -- that would encompass 50\nStates in the case of a national banking association\nand one or two States in the case of a State\ncorporation. And so we're --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- what do you\nmean that national banking associations are, after all,\ncorporations? I thought they were distinct entities\nfrom corporations.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: No. They're -- they're not\nState chartered corporations. They're federally\nchartered corporations, but they are corporate in the\n-- as -- as distinguished from other sort of forms that\nan entity, an incorporeal entity, may take. And\nCongress specifically provided that in 12 U.S.C. 24 --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You mean --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: -- when it defined them as,\nquote, a body corporate, close quote. So I think it\nmakes sense to apply the normal rules that we apply to\ncorporate citizenship.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They're not\nincorporated -- they're not incorporated under the laws\nof any State, though.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: They're not incorporated\nunder the laws of any State, but they're incorporated\nunder -- under the National Bank Act. They're\nfederally chartered corporations like other federally\nchartered corporations. And so in that sense, we think\nit makes sense to apply the normal rules that apply to\ncorporate citizenship to national banks.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But -- I'm sorry.\nMaybe this is something everybody knows but me. But I\nwould have thought that a national association is\ndistinct from a corporation in a way, for example, that\na partnership is distinct from a corporation. And I\nwouldn't have assumed that the laws with respect to\ncorporations automatically applied to national banking\nassociations. But you say they do?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: If I could just -- just\nbriefly.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: I think what I'm trying to\nsay is that federally -- national banks are federally\nchartered corporations and they share the salient\ncharacteristics of a corporation, i.e., there's limited\nliability for shareholders -- and that's at 12 U.S.C.\n64(a) -- and they have a perpetual existence in the\nsame way that corporations do, and that's at 12 U.S.C.\n24.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you did say 1332(c)\ndoes not apply to the national bank. It's only one\nlocation.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: That -- that's our view, but\nagain, I'm -- I wouldn't characterize it an -- as an\nopen and shut case because 1332(c) refers generally to\ncorporations, and so one could reach the conclusion\nthat 1332's reference to principal place of business\nshould also apply to national banks.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Gilreath.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES R. GILREATH\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. GILREATH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nMr. Chief Justice, I want to follow up on a\npoint you -- you were on about this thing about an\nassociation.\nBefore I do that, I want -- I want to say so\nI'll be sure I don't forget it. Wachovia, according to\n-- I think we've got it in our papers that we filed in\nopposition to the petition -- has 179 branches in South\nCarolina.\nBut it -- but it is important, as -- as you\npointed out, Mr. Chief Justice, that a national bank is\nnot a corporation, but it is a association formed under\nFederal law. So there's no State to which this Court\ncan look or anybody can look to determine what their\ncitizenship is. In fact, in the Langdeau case, they\nsaid it was a quasi-public institution, national in\ncharacter. So it's not a -- it's not a State\ncorporation. It's got no ties to a State corporation.\nSo if it's going to have citizenship for diversity\npurposes, Congress has got to say how we going to\nfigure that out. And that's what they did in 1448.\nThis Court, in a series of cases back in the\nmid-'80's, was faced with the -- with the issue of how\ndo you determine the citizenship of a corporation, and\nit went back and forth but finally came down with a\ndoctrine that said a corporation will be deemed a\ncitizen of the State in which it is incorporated.\nAnd then in 1958, Congress enacted 1332 and\nadded the additional clause of principal place of\nbusiness.\nNow, given that it is a national association\nand it's not a State corporation, it was necessary for\nCongress to legislate and enact a statute so we could\ndetermine how it would have diversity. And that's what\nthey did in 28-1448.\nAnd going to the question Justice Scalia\nasked, do we have to go back and look at all of this\nstatutory history -- and you can believe I've been\nlooking at it a lot more than I'd like to have lately.\nIt kind of ruined my holiday.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GILREATH: But I think I understand it.\nAnd my answer to your question is that you do not.\nWhen Congress enacts a statute that says you are deemed\nto be a citizen of a State -- let me be sure I read it\nright here -- deemed to be a citizen of the State in\nwhich you're respectively located, I don't know how\nCongress can speak much clearer.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Let me -- let me raise the\nreality check question. If -- if we assume that that\nis not the only possible reading of that statute, why\nin the world would Congress have wanted to impose the\n-- the system that follows from -- from your result in\nwhich the -- the national banks are -- are excluded\nfrom diversity jurisdiction to a degree that the State\nbanks clearly are not?\nMR. GILREATH: I don't think, when Congress\nenacted section 1448, that they even knew about branch\nbanking. The -- the -- that -- that is something that\nhas evolved really since 1994 when the Neal-Riegle Act\nwas enacted.\nSo the statute says --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But the -- I guess the\nproblem is if -- if we start with the assumption that I\nmade a second ago that your reading is not a necessity\n-- it's a possible reading. No question about it. But\nif -- if we assume that it's not an absolute necessity,\nwe -- we try to avoid freakish results, and this seems\nlike a freakish result. And I take it your answer is\nit may be a freakish result. We're not claiming that\nCongress intended it. But that still leaves us, I\nthink, with the problem of a -- a reading which is not\nabsolutely necessary that does produce a freakish\nresult. And if that's the case, why shouldn't you\nlose?\nMR. GILREATH: Well, that assumes that you\nwant to give the -- the -- I'm not suggesting that you\n-- you want to do this, but that -- that a court would\nwant to give the national banks what I say is a free\nticket to the Federal courts, to the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: No. The question is why\nwould Congress -- let's assume we have a choice between\ntwo readings. Why would Congress want to give the\nState courts -- the State banks -- State banks --\ngreater access to Federal courts than it gives national\nbanks? What earthly reason would there be for Congress\nwanting to do that?\nMR. GILREATH: I can't -- I can't give you a\nreason for that. I -- I would suggest that they --\nthey don't want to give greater access one way or the\nother, but they've got to write a statute. And when\nthey wrote the statute, nobody had in mind what the\nbranch banking system was going to be today. And so\nnow what this Court is faced with is they are looking\nat a statute that, when you read it literally, says\nthat they ought to be deemed to be a citizen of South\nCarolina if they have a branch in South Carolina.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it -- it says\nlocated. I mean, do you -- what about an ATM? Does an\nATM make them -- that's all they've got in Wyoming.\nDoes that make them located in Wyoming?\nMR. GILREATH: That's a good question. I --\nI think you could argue either way. I -- I would say\nthey probably are located there because if --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What -- what about if we go\nback to 1880 or whatever and they had a messenger? You\nknow, they only had one office, but they had depositors\nin different States, and this messenger went from State\nto State handing out the cash and collecting a fee.\nWould Congress at that time have considered that bank\nto be located in all the States where the messenger\nshowed up?\nMR. GILREATH: I'm -- I'm not sure that even\nI could say that located goes quite that far. I'm not\neven sure that back then the -- the statutes would have\nallowed them to have had a messenger, but assuming it\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: Couldn't have a messenger?\nHe just delivered some mail. The post office was slow.\nMR. GILREATH: You make a good point.\nI can't -- I can't argue too much --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The Pony Express.\nMR. GILREATH: -- with that point.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can have private\ndelivery of mail. Can you?\nWell, that's a -- but what -- what even more\n-- what about a -- a warehouse? I mean, it's where\nthey keep the -- the money bags or whatever.\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's all that's --\nthat's all that's -- and that's all that's in the\nState. Are they located in that State?\nMR. GILREATH: They've got a presence there\nand they're doing business there. I think they would\nbe deemed located there.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you -- call your\nattention to another word in the statute that seems\npersuasive to me? It's the word respectively. The\nstatute says all national banking associations shall\nbe, for the purposes of all other actions by or against\nthem, be deemed citizens of the State in which they are\nrespectively located, which I would read as saying in\nwhich each of them is located. Isn't that --\nMR. GILREATH: That -- that's the way I read\nit, and we -- we discussed that in our brief, that --\nthat word. We -- we said more so that it doesn't take\naway from the position that we've got, but I -- I agree\nwith what you're saying. It could be each State.\nAnd -- and the statute also says States, in\nthe plural, in which they're located.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: They're talking about a\nplural banking associations, not just plural branches\nof one association. And it's in which each -- in which\nthey are respectively located, which strikes me as\nsaying in -- in which each of those national banking\nassociation is located, which seems to me to read as\nthough there's only one location for each bank.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that -- that would be\ntrue if it said the State in which they are -- in which\nthey are respectively located, but it does say of the\nStates.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That's what it does say:\nthe States in which they are respectively located.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, so each one could be in\nmany States. No?\nMR. GILREATH: I read it, because it says\nStates, that it's referring to more than one State in\nwhich they could be located.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And of course, it refers to\nmore than one State because it referred to even more\nthan one national bank association. It's a plural\nassociations, and then it says, each of them shall be\ndeemed a citizen of the State in which -- it says in\nthe plural -- in which they are respectively located.\nMR. GILREATH: I think what -- what we said\nin our brief was that the word respectively is -- is in\nthere so that you are not talking about all the banks,\nbut talking about each bank.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Correct. That's exactly\nright.\nMR. GILREATH: If I could move on. There are\nmany different business entities that anybody can elect\nto -- to do business under. As I think the Chief\nJustice raised earlier, a limited partnership, for\ninstance, is deemed to have the citizenship of all of\nits various partners.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But not with every State\nwith which it has a close nexus.\nMR. GILREATH: Right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So, in other words, the\npartnership -- we have a corporation where it's\nincorporated and Congress said a principal place of\nbusiness. We have a partnership where each partner is\nlocated. I don't know of any instance where for\nsubject matter jurisdiction, that is, which court\nsystem you go to, as distinguished from personal\njurisdiction or venue, you have a notion that someone\nis a citizen of every place where it does the business.\nIs there -- is there any other example? It's\ncertainly not true of a partnership. It isn't true of\n-- of a corporation. Is there any other entity that\nwould, for subject matter jurisdiction purposes --\nMR. GILREATH: I don't know of any. It's the\n-- it's the same for a limited liability company as it\nis for a partnership I believe, that you have to -- you\nhave to look through it.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Its members.\nMR. GILREATH: But the point -- the point I\nwas making is that it -- it doesn't necessarily have to\nbe the same rule that it is for a corporation, and --\nand that -- that's what this Court decided in the\nCarden case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but the question that\nI asked you is, in the realm of subject matter\njurisdiction, that is, which court system, Federal or\nState, as distinguished from where can I grab this\nperson for personal jurisdiction purposes, what are my\nvenue choices, is there any other example in all of\ntitle 28 where, for subject matter jurisdiction\npurposes, this -- every place where it's located\ncounts?\nMR. GILREATH: Not -- not that I know of.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do we owe any degree\nof deference to the Comptroller's interpretation of the\nprovision?\nMR. GILREATH: There -- there is some\nauthority that I think is cited in their brief or\nsomebody's brief that the Court should give deference\nto -- to their interpretations. But this Court is not\nbound by their interpretations. If -- if this Court\nconcludes that their interpretation is -- is clearly\nincorrect, then it's not -- it's not bound by it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This is not a matter of --\nof -- over which the Comptroller has administrative\nresponsibility, is it? I mean, this is just a matter\nfor the courts as to what court these associations can\nbe -- can be sued in. And I don't see how the\nComptroller has any business in that area.\nMR. GILREATH: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, I -- I guess he\ndeals with these associations all the time, so we\nshould -- we should listen to him, but -- but he -- he\nis not authoritative as to -- as to who comes into\ncourt, is he?\nMR. GILREATH: No. I would agree. In fact,\nCongress has the final say-so, and then this Court has\ngot to look at what Congress says to interpret it. And\nCongress said, I say very simply, that they're deemed a\ncitizen of any State wherever they are located.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What do you do with\ntheir -- their hypothetical in both your friend's brief\nand the Government's brief about Ford Motor Company,\nnot in terms of 1332 but common parlance? If you ask\nsomebody where Ford Motor is located, they're likely to\nrespond by saying, well, what do you mean? Do you mean\ntheir headquarters? Do you mean the -- the plant down\nthe street? Do you mean the dealership? It does\nsuggest that located doesn't have the clear meaning\nthat you rely on.\nMR. GILREATH: You -- you can make that\nargument, but it -- it depends on, like you say, what\n-- what do you mean when you ask that question. If\nyou're going out to buy a Ford car, then you obviously\nwould want to know where it's located other than in\nMichigan. You'd want to know where the nearest Ford\ndealership is.\nLocated, obviously, can have several\nmeanings, but that's one of the points, I think, that\nJudge Luttig made in his opinion, is you've got to look\nat it in the context in which it is said in the\nstatute. And looking at the statute, in the context in\nwhich the word located is there, it says where -- in --\nin the States where it's located.\nNow, there are other places in the statute,\nwhich I'm sure they will argue or have argued in their\nbrief, that -- that say, you know, it's located, when\nthey're talking about a bank -- a branch bank where you\ncan do insurance or whatever, that it can -- it can\nsell insurance in any branch where -- where it's\nlocated, and that means another meaning to locate. But\nyou've got to look at locate in the context in which\nit's used, and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But the -- the argument here\nis -- is in the context of deciding which citizen an\nentity is a citizen -- which State an entity is a\ncitizen of, we normally don't think that entities are\ncitizens of multiple States. Just as you wouldn't\nthink if -- if you're asking, you know, where does the\nFord Motor Company manage its -- its operations from,\nyou wouldn't think from multiple States.\nSo here when you're talking about\ncitizenship, why doesn't this argument of context cut\nprecisely against you? We're talking about\ncitizenship. People aren't citizens of -- of 50\nStates. I mean, that -- that's an extraordinary result\nto reach.\nMR. GILREATH: I -- I agree. A citizen is a\ncitizen.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So we should be looking for\none State or maybe two States at most.\nMR. GILREATH: Well, we -- I -- I contend --\nI can understand why you say that, but if you read the\n-- the statute the way it's worded and you -- and you\nlook at what's going on out there, I don't see any\nproblem with this Court construing that they are a\ncitizen of a State like South Carolina where they've\ngot 179 branches. The -- according to the brief by, I\nthink, the ABA or one of the amicus, they've got\nsomething like 3,600 branches.\nNow, they come into South Carolina, they're\ntaking -- if I bank with them, they're taking my money\nand the -- and the money of other millions of South\nCarolinians and -- who -- who are entrusting their\nmoney to them, as opposed to entrust it to a State\ncourt, and if I'm banking with them, I've got to go sue\nthem in -- in Federal court. Whereas, if I'm banking\nwith a --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In South Carolina. It's\nnot -- it's not as though you're being sent to some\nother place. The only question is whether they would\nhave access to the Federal court. But as far as\npersonal jurisdiction is concerned, you have it in\nSouth Carolina.\nMR. GILREATH: No. I think if -- if we -- if\nthis Court adopts the position the petitioner wants,\nthey would be deemed a -- a citizen of North Carolina,\nnot South Carolina. And if I had -- if I got into a\ncontroversy with them about something in my account, I\nwould have to go file court -- file suit in a Federal\ncourt to bring them to South Carolina where I would be\ndrawing a jury from 8 or 10 counties as opposed if they\nwere a State bank or --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it would still be in\nSouth Carolina.\nMR. GILREATH: It would still be in South\nCarolina.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And the same would be\ntrue if you were dealing with a State bank incorporated\nin North Carolina with its principal place of business\nin Virginia that had 50 branches in South Carolina.\nThe same thing --\nMR. GILREATH: That's -- that's true.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- would still be\ntrue.\nMR. GILREATH: That's exactly true.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And that's the parity\nthat Congress has -- that has been the guiding\nprinciple of Congress' enactments in this area since\n1882.\nMR. GILREATH: Well, I don't -- I don't know\nwhether I necessarily agree with that or with this\nparity argument that they've got. I wanted -- I want\nto address that just briefly, if I could, is the parity\nargument -- and -- and all of this parity argument they\nget they get from -- from these 1882, 1885, 1887\nstatutes. All of those statutes have been repealed.\nThe parity argument is gone. If -- if Congress had\nwanted parity, then where is parity in section 1448?\nIt's not there. It was there in 1882, 1885 and '87,\nbut those statutes have been repealed. Parity is not\nsome doctrine or something in the Constitution. So I\nthink --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I go -- may I go back\nto the textual argument that Justice Scalia was\nsuggesting a little while ago? If we presume that\nnormally a citizen is a citizen of only one place --\nthere are multiple -- there are other situations where\nyou have a dual citizen -- and that you would normally\nassume they're only a citizen in one place, then\nCongress, in order to solve the problem of corporate\nheadquarters in the private commercial world, corporate\nheadquarters, a main piece of business, went out of its\nway to say corporations shall be deemed to be a citizen\nof two places -- they made a special statute when they\ncould be a citizen of two places, which overcomes the\npresumption that it's a citizen of only one place. But\nthere's nothing to overcome the presumption that in\n1348 they're assuming each citizen has only one place\nof citizenship because that statute just used the word\nrespectively. It talks about many banks but in --\nrespectively citizens of -- of different States. But I\nthink that's fully consistent with the notion, sort of\nthe basic background notion, that one person has one --\none citizenship; one corporation has only one place of\ncitizenship.\nMR. GILREATH: I can't -- I can't argue with\nthe logic that you've got. But I -- I still come back\nto the language of the statute.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, this -- I'm -- I'm\nrelying strictly on the statutory language in making\nthis argument.\nMR. GILREATH: Are you talking about 1448?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, because it doesn't say\nanything about anybody being a -- capable of being a\ncitizen of two different places, whereas 1332 does,\nwhich is the unusual situation.\nMR. GILREATH: I agree, but it says they\nshall be deemed citizens of the States in which they\nare respectively located.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Respectively.\nMR. GILREATH: The statute says State -- says\ncitizens, which to me says the statute is allowing you\nto find that they can be a citizen of more than one\nState.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: See, but it's clearly\nunusual to say you can be a citizen of two places. And\nto do that, you had a special statute in 1332. To say\nyou can be a citizen of 40 or 50 States simultaneously,\nthere really is no precedent for that.\nMR. GILREATH: I -- I can't argue with you,\nbut I -- I still come back, you know, to the statute.\nI -- I think -- I think the real problem here is that\nyou've got a statute that was enacted in 1948 that\nreally, if you go back and look, it goes back to 1911.\nAnd obviously, in 1911, nobody knew the proliferation\nof branch banking that was going to take place. Nobody\nknew the proliferation of branch banking that was going\nto take place in -- in 1948 when it was enacted.\nAnd I think the real decision that this Court\nhas got to make is whether you -- you read the statute\nand apply it or either whether you're going to leave it\nto Congress to -- to make that change.\nI'm not -- and -- and you may -- you may\napply it the way I'm arguing, and I hope you do. And\nit may be -- and -- and if you do, then the national\nbanking associations, with all the clout they've got,\ncan go over here across the street to Congress and they\ncan get it changed. And you can bet they probably will\nbe trying.\nBut I think the real question is -- is are\nyou going to read the statute for what it says or are\nyou going to, you know, give it the reading they want\nby going back in all this history and twisting and\nturning to get to the point they want to get to.\nThey even -- I think this is one point I want\nto make is if you look at their brief, right at the\nlast page of their brief -- and I think this highlights\nthe -- the problem that you've got is they say you\ndon't need to go so far as to determine two places.\nThey just want you to determine one place. And I think\nthat highlights the fact of how far they're trying to\nstretch the rubber band on this word to -- to get the\n-- get the meaning that they want. They -- they say\nthat ought to be left for another day.\nAnd so I come back that the -- the ordinary\nmeaning of the word located should -- should put it in\neach State. The -- I -- I think this -- I come back\nand I think the statute is unambiguous.\nAnd that leads me to the -- the Bougas case,\nwhich was talked about a little bit. It's not very\noften that you have a statute where this Court has\nalready ruled, as it did in Bougas some 28 years ago, a\n-- a virtually identical statute dealing with the\nbanking laws. They -- they try to say, well, the in\npari materia doctrine ought not to apply, but I mean,\nyou've got a statute there that's a -- a banking\nstatute, admittedly dealing with venue, where this\nCourt found the same meaning that we would like for it\nto find here. The courts -- and -- and their argument\nabout established and located completely goes away\nbecause the Court said whatever the reason behind the\ndistinction in those two words, it does exist and we\nrecognize it.\nAnd -- and even if you say, well, in pari\nmateria doesn't apply -- and that's what they argue.\nJudge Luttig said, well, it -- it's -- still there's\nsome authority that similar statutes should apply.\nAnd here, we have a decision that's\nconstruing an almost identical statute. It reaches the\nconclusion that -- that we would like.\nIn summary, kind of the way I look at it it's\nkind of like in 1948 the Congress tailored a\ncitizenship suit of clothes for national banks, and --\nand that suit of clothes, a pattern of which was laid\nout even back into the -- the 19th century, still fits\nthe bill today. It's old. It's a 57-year-old suit of\nclothes, and -- but it still -- it can still work. It\nmay not work the way the banks want it to work, but it\nwill work. And if the banks want to get a new suit of\nclothes for jurisdiction, then they need to go over\nacross the street here to Congress and let it make that\nenactment.\nIf you have no further questions, that\nconcludes my argument.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Frey, you have 2 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. FREY\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. FREY: Thank you, I'll try to speak\nquickly. I just have a couple of points.\nOne is with regard to the spread of national\nbanks. There is a comparable spread of State banks.\nFor instance, Sun Trust is a bank that's comparable in\nscope to Wachovia. It has operations in many States.\nIt has many branches, I assume, in South Carolina. And\nyet, it is a citizen only of its home State, its State\nof incorporation, or principal place of business.\nIf there were a problem of abuse of\nrelocation, which I think the Court was a little bit\nworried about, Congress would deal with it the way they\ndealt with the abuses of corporate -- stated place of\nincorporation by passing 1332(c).\nSo let me --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, but if there were\nthe problems that you hypothesize here, Congress could\nhave dealt with them by enacting something that dealt\nwith the proliferation of branch banks rather than\ninterpreting the 1948 statute in light of 1980's --\nMR. FREY: It could have, but it saw no need.\nThere was a statute that had been consistently on the\nbooks for a century that meant the same thing, which is\nsurely what Congress wanted. Why would Congress bother\nwhen it enacted Riegle-Neal and allowed interstate\nbranching, to say, by the way, just like State\ncorporations which conduct business in many States, you\nknow, the rule that we -- we've adopted that banks are\nlocated in their main office or their charter location,\nstill applies? That would --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that's not\na rule that they've adopted. All they say is that\nthey're citizens of wherever they're located.\nMR. FREY: But it's been interpreted by the\nCourt. It's -- it's been -- you have a series of\nstatutes, and each time the Court says it doesn't\nchange from the original 1882 meaning. You have the\n1882 statute then you have 1887, and the Court says this\nmeans the same thing as 1882. Then you have 1911. The\nCourt says this means the same thing as 1911. Then\n1948. I think Langdeau says it means the same thing\nthere.\nLet me just, in the brief time I have left,\non in pari materia, which is at the heart of Justice\nScalia's question about the Bougas case. Let me just\ncite two cases to the Court that I think are\ninstructive on this, United States against Granderson,\n511 U.S. 39, and Fort Stewart Schools, 495 U.S. 641,\nboth refusing to apply the in pari materia doctrine\nwhere you had quite comparable statutes.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
