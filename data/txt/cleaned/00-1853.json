        "content": "(11:17 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nnext in Number 00-1853, Akos Swierkiewicz v. Sorema.\nMr. Goodman.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF HAROLD I. GOODMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. GOODMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis c case brings up for review a fairly\nstraightforward but nonetheless essential question as it\napplies to Federal practice and procedure, namely, whether\nor not notice pleading is sufficient with compliance with\nRule 8(a)(2), or whether or not the rule requires some\nelement of fact pleading to overcome a Rule 12(b)(6)\nmotion to dismiss. It arises in the context of a title\nVII national origin and an age discrimination case under\nthe ADEA. Mr. Swierkiewicz was fired from his job by\nSorema, his former employer. He brought suit in the\ndistrict court claiming that that firing was based upon\nhis national origin -- he's Hungarian -- and his age. He\nwas about 51 at the time.\nHe pled that there was no valid reason for his\ndischarge. He pointed to the fact that he himself had\nincurred a history over 2 years of discrimination based on\nhis national origin and his age, coming from 1995, when he\nwas demoted from his position as chief underwriting\nofficer, through and including two successive years where\nhe was the victim of continuous discrimination by being\nexcluded from meetings, business decisions, and isolated\nand denied any career growth.\nThe Second Circuit, affirming the Southern\nDistrict of New York, concluded that conclusory\nallegations of discrimination, what it referred to as\nnaked allegations, were insufficient. Some facts had to\nbe proved, proved via a complaint, because it adopted as a\npleading standard this Court's elements of a prima facie\ncase in McDonnell Douglas v. Green.\nQUESTION: You don't deny that some facts have\nto be stated, do you?\nMR. GOODMAN: I do not.\nQUESTION: I mean, can I come in just with a\ncomplaint that says, I have been unlawfully discriminated\nagainst by my employer, who is -- and I name the employer.\nMR. GOODMAN: I think if you did not identify\nthe adverse action, there would not be sufficient\ninformation alleged to be able to sustain a motion for\ndismissal. However, even in that --\nQUESTION: That was contained here? They --\nMR. GOODMAN: Absolutely.\nQUESTION: You would have to also allege,\nwouldn't you, that you were discriminated against because\nof your race, or because of your nationality?\nMR. GOODMAN: Absolutely.\nQUESTION: And you again say that was done here.\nMR. GOODMAN: Five times in the complaint. Five\ntimes, so that while I absolutely agree that sufficient\ninformation must be pled, a) to put a defendant on notice,\nwhat is this claim all about, so I can begin the\ninvestigative work of defending it and responding via a\nresponsive pleading, and ultimately so that the case can\nhave res judicata effect so that we know what the claim is\nthat normally, as this Court's precedents unanimously and\nconsistently have said, notice pleading, and more\nparticularly, simplified notice pleading is more than\nenough.\nSo we contrast what the Second Circuit did with\nthree critical barometers. The first and most critical\nare these Court's precedents, starting, of course, with\nConley in 1957, a case brought under the Railway Labor Act\nclaiming that the union did not fairly represent the\ninterests of African American conductors and porters. As\nJustice Black, writing for the Court, said, the\nallegations were entirely general, but in response to the\nunion's argument that more specificity, some specificity\nhad to be alleged, the Court wrote, the law requires\nunions to represent minorities on the same basis as\nnonminorities. That --\nQUESTION: Mr. Goodman, why do you start with\nConley v. Gibson rather than Dioguardi v. Durning. I\nthought that was always the classic.\nMR. GOODMAN: Dioguardi is my favorite case,\nsimply because it has been authored by then Judge and\nlater Chief Judge Clark, who was the reporter for this\nCourt's advisory committee. It was decided in 1944, and\nthe argument the Government made in opposition to the\ncomplaint, which was a pro se complaint, was simply that\nsome facts had to be alleged to support the plaintiff's\nclaims that the Government a) had undersold his medicinal\ntonic, and b) had lost two cases of his medicinal tonic,\nto which Judge Clark said, no, the time for ascertaining\nthe facts under the new Federal system, then 6 years old,\nwas through discovery, and if the case was nonmeritorious,\nthrough summary judgment, but it's enough that this pro se\nlitigant simply said, you deprived me of my goods, you\nundersold my property. That is the leading case and,\nindeed, in Conley --\nQUESTION: That's the leading case? I would\nthink you might say a case from this Court were a leading\ncase --\nMR. GOODMAN: Well --\nQUESTION: -- as opposed to one from the Second\nCircuit.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GOODMAN: I do, indeed. I do, indeed, and\nthat's why I started with Conley, but it is interesting\nand, I think, prophetic, that footnote 5 of Conley cites\nDioguardi with approval.\nNow, in Conley the Court rebuffed unanimously\nthe claim that some specificity had to be embossed upon\nthe complaint. 17 years later, in Scheuer, again a\nunanimous court then through Chief Justice Burger rebuffed\nclaims by Ohio that the National Guard and the Governor of\nOhio, who were defendants, were sued on a 1983 damage\nclaim with only the bare allegation that the National\nGuard had done wrong and was responsible for the deaths of\nthe plaintiffs in that case, rebuffing unanimously the\nargument that some facts had be pled. The Court turned\naside that holding and that case of the Sixth Circuit and,\nindeed, said, you do not need to do it in a complaint.\nNotice pleading, as we pointed out in Conley, is more than\nsufficient. You will have sufficient time to flesh out\nissues, to learn facts in discovery.\nHad that been the end of the trilogy, it would\nhave been enough, but, as this Court knows, just 9 years\nago, 8 years ago, in 1993 in Leatherman, again confronted\nwith a similar issue in a 1983 municipal liability case,\nthe Court had to decide whether or not some facts were\nessential to a 1983 failure-to-train case under Canton.\nThe decision of the Sixth Circuit, which was accepted on\nreview, had said in no uncertain terms the complaint here\nalleges no facts, none, to support the failure-to-train\ncase. In response, the Court, through the Chief Justice,\nunanimously said no. We meant what we said in Conley.\nRule 8(a)(2) is sufficient if a plaintiff provides\ninformation that puts a defendant on notice of the claims.\nThat's all that's required.\nIf, today, we had to revise the rules there is a\nprocess for doing that and that might result, for 1983\npurposes, in a revision to Rule 8(a)(2) such as that\n9(a)(2), which now only requires particularity in cases of\nfraud and mistake, might have a third entry for\nparticularity purposes, a 1983 action, for example, or\nhere. If, upon proper review and the process of this\nCourt's committee and its adoption of rules and those by\nCongress, it was felt that a title VII case or an age case\nought to also require particularity, that would be the\ntime and that would be the place to do it.\nBut I submit that there are two substantial\nother reasons for reversal here, and they are bedded in\nthe Federal rules and have not changed in six decades, and\nthey emanate from Rule 84, the rule, scarcely utilized,\nbut is important in this case, which simply says the\nforms, the official forms that are attached to the rules,\nare sufficient for Federal pleading. In particular, Rule,\nor a Form 5 deals with goods sold and delivered. It's one\nsentence. Between June of 1936 and December of 1936 the\nplaintiff had goods for which the defendant was\nresponsible, wherefore clause, prayer for relief. That was\ndeemed sufficient.\nOfficial form 9, a three-paragraph complaint\nalleging negligence. A defendant, driving a vehicle on\nBoylston Street in Boston, committed negligence. Injuries\nresult --\nQUESTION: Negligently drove. Negligently\ndrove.\nMR. GOODMAN: Negligently drove, doesn't deal\nwith what the standard of care was, whether it was\nbreached, whether there was or was not causation.\nQUESTION: Mr. Goodman, if --\nQUESTION: It gave a date. It gave a date, too,\ndidn't it?\nMR. GOODMAN: It did.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. GOODMAN: As we did here.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nQUESTION: If the judge said, okay, this\ncomplaint measures up to Conley v. Goodman, but I don't\nwant to allow extensive discovery fishing expeditions,\nwhat can the judge do to curtail the pretrial proceeding?\nMR. GOODMAN: Rule 16 gives the district court\nconsiderable discretion to isolate issues, to isolate\ndiscovery. If, for example, a Rix-type defense was\nraised, which isn't true in this case, on statute of\nlimitations ground -- a professor denied tenure. The\ncomplaint doesn't mention anything about the date the\ntenure was denied, but does say the date employment ended.\nThe University of Pennsylvania determines that we know\nwhen the tenure decision was made. It's not pled in the\ncomplaint.\nAt a Rule 16 conference it requests the trial\ncourt to isolate that issue, allow discovery to be taken\non that issue, and allow summary judgment to follow on\nthat issue. If it's granted, the case is over. If it's\ndenied, the case proceeds on full merits. There are\nnumerous arsenal of remedies that district courts have to\nboth curtail --\nQUESTION: Mr. Goodman, may I ask you this\nquestion: Is one of the things the district judge can do,\nis -- you refer on page -- in paragraph 31 of the\ncomplaint to a particular memorandum which your client\nsent to the other side, and the other side filed an\naffidavit saying, here's the memorandum. They put the\nwhole memorandum in. May the judge review that memorandum\nand take it into account in ruling on the motion?\nMR. GOODMAN: Uh -- excuse me. Not in the\ncontext, I think, of this case, for two reasons. One, it\nwas an ex parte submission. The affidavit of defense\ncounsel says, I received a request from the district\ncourt. Plaintiff was never notified of it. I thought it\nwas odd that it was made of defense counsel, so there was\nno --\nQUESTION: Supposing you did give notice and you\ndidn't challenge the genuineness of the -- of that paper,.\ncould the judge look at it in deciding the case?\nMR. GOODMAN: I think in some instances, yes,\nbut not --\nQUESTION: In this instance.\nMR. GOODMAN: Not in this, because it raises all\nsorts of questions of credibility and inference.\nMr. Swierkiewicz, for example, referred to a\nhostile work environment. He work -- he indicated --\nQUESTION: Well, I'm assuming the judge would\nresolve all instances in favor of the plaintiff. If the\njudge did that, could the judge look at the affidavit in\nruling on the motion to -- I mean, look at the paper\nthat's referred to in the complaint and ruling on the\nsufficiency of the complaint?\nMR. GOODMAN: I think so. I think so. I think\nit depends, though, on the substance of the document. I'm\nassuming that authenticity, for example, is not in\ndispute. I'm assuming that all inferences in the document\non a motion to dismiss are going to be accorded to the\nplaintiff and not to the defendant. Assuming that, and\nalso assuming that the underlying document is essential to\nthe case, then, I think, under the case law it may be\nconsidered by the district court.\nQUESTION: Well, it must be essential, if you\nrefer to it in your complaint.\nMR. GOODMAN: Yes. That's why I answered the\nquestion yes.\nQUESTION: In the Rule 16 conference can the\njudge say, I've looked at this pleading, and it passes\nunder the Federal rule, but I think discovery would be\nexpedited if you made it much, much more complete. I want\nto file an amended complaint setting forth the allegations\nand the reasons for your injury in much more detail. Can\nhe do that?\nMR. GOODMAN: I think it is permissible, but\nlargely an abuse of discretion if the court has stated,\nwhich was implicit or explicit, Justice Kennedy, in your\nquestion, that the complaint satisfies Rule 8(a)(2). If\nthe complaint were deemed so vague and ambiguous, to quote\nprecisely rule 12(e), a defendant could make that motion\nto flush out much more factual, or more information, or\nregarding either liability or damages, but I would say\nexcept in the most egregious case a sua sponte direction\nby a district court who has said, it is my view that your\ncomplaint satisfies 8(a)(2), it would be precisely what\nRule 8(a)(2) and the simplified notice pleading\nrequirements were intended to avoid, which was a lot of\nlitigation up front to avoid a disposition on the merits.\nQUESTION: So then the other option is for the\njudge to allow discovery to go forward but on a limited\nbasis and keep control of it that way?\nMR. GOODMAN: Absolutely and, of course, the\nrevisions to the rules, both in terms, for example, of the\nnumber of interrogatories, the number of depositions, have\ngone a considerable way towards that effect in any event,\nbut the district court has considerable latitude to add to\nthat.\nQUESTION: Mr. Goodman, I think this case in a\nway puts notice pleading to the test. In the form\ncomplaint that you referred to involving an automobile\naccident, you know, ordinarily automobile accidents don't\nhappen unless there's been some negligence on the part of\none party or the other, but you get hit with a car, and\nyou know, have reason to suspect there was some\nnegligence.\nBut people are fired, people are not promoted\nall the time, without any necessary implication of\nwrongdoing, and something seems wrong that when you're\ndismissed you can say, I was dismissed because I'm a\nHungarian, without having any evidence whatever, and can\nbring a complaint and then use the courts essentially as\nan investigatory arm to find out whether you indeed do\nhave any basis for complaining. I think it just seems --\nMR. GOODMAN: I think there are two responses to\nthat. First of all, if the complaint is frivolous or\nbought in bad faith, as an officer of the court the\nplaintiff's law him or herself would be exposed to\ndamages, so there's got to be some sort of good faith at\nthe outset in making that kind of allegation.\nQUESTION: So the lawyer must know something\nmore than the mere fact that I was fired, and I think I\nwas fired because I was a Hungarian. Presumably the\nlawyer has to ask the client, why do you think you were\nfired because you were a Hungarian? What makes you think\nthat was the reason?\nMR. GOODMAN: I think you're --\nQUESTION: And if you can tell that to the\nlawyer, why can't you put it in the complaint?\nMR. GOODMAN: The question is whether or not you\nmust put it in the complaint, and for purposes of this\nCourt's precedents, and again I come back to Conley and\nScheuer and Leatherman, the only way that they must be put\nin the case, with all due respect, is if Rule 8(a)(2) were\namended, or Rule 9(b) were amended, and if --\nQUESTION: You're certainly not required to\nplead the evidence in support of your charge.\nMR. GOODMAN: Exactly, and that was my last\npoint, and I'll end with it, and that is that the decision\nof the district court here in effect conflated elements of\nevidence with elements of pleading.\nMcDonnell Douglas v. Green was a recognition of\nwhat we all know to be true. Employers do not look you in\nthe eye and say you're too old, I'm firing you, you're\nHungarian, you are black, you are a woman, you are\ndisabled. It doesn't work that way. That's what\nMcDonnell Douglas did. It said, we can find an indirect\nway, circumstantially, to come to the same result. This\nis what a plaintiff needs do to overcome summary judgment\nor to prevail at trial.\nThe Second Circuit, unlike every circuit that\nhas considered the issue, namely, The D.C., the Third,\nthe Sixth, the Seventh, the Eighth, and the Ninth, made\nyou put the evidence at the outset of the case and if I\nmight, Justice Scalia, much of that evidence is not known\nto the plaintiff at the outset.\nAs this Court has held just last term in Reeves,\nthe key to the evidence frequently is in the hands of the\ndefendant: Who replaced Mr. Swierkiewicz? Why was he\nfired instantly, on the spot? Who made that decision?\nYou need discovery for that.\nQUESTION: You say some of it must be known to\nthe plaintiff. It's just not enough that I'm Hungarian,\nI'm fired. I just can't come into a lawyer and say, sue\nthis guy because I'm Hungarian and he fired me.\nMR. GOODMAN: I agree with that.\nQUESTION: And I think he fired me because I'm\nHungarian. You have to find something else.\nMR. GOODMAN: And this complaint pleads far more\nthan that. This complaint pleads 2 years of ongoing\ncontinuous discrimination based on national origin and\nbased on age.\nNow, I would say that if it said I was fired\nbecause I'm Hungarian, because I'm 51, gives the date in\nApril 1997, identifies the individual who fired him,\nFrancois Chavel, identifies five other people who were\nfired for cause and got substantial severance benefits,\nthat that satisfied any kind of notice pleading ever set\nup by this Court. We did more than we had to.\nFor those reasons --\nQUESTION: I think last was not even necessary.\nThat to the last was not --\nMR. GOODMAN: Correct. For those reasons we\nrespectfully request the Court to reverse. Thank you.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Goodman.\nMr. Minear.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY P. MINEAR\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. MINEAR: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThe court of appeals in this case clearly erred\nin ruling that the pleadings, in this case the complaint,\nwere insufficient. The Court's -- this Court's ruling in\nConley v. Gibson makes clear that notice is what's\nessential in the complaint. In this case, the complaint\nset forth a short and plain statement of the claim, and it\nindicated a request for relief.\nQUESTION: It was nine pages long, wasn't it?\nMR. MINEAR: Yes, it was.\nQUESTION: Can you necessarily say that's a\nshort statement?\nMR. MINEAR: Well, obviously the length of the\ncomplaint will vary on the degree of complexity of the\ncase, but I think that simply underscores the fact that\nthis complaint was more than ample in setting forth the\nnecessary elements of a complaint.\nWhat's important about the complaint in this\ncase is, it did identify both the adverse action that was\ninvolved and also allege that the adverse action was the\nproduct of a prohibited discrimination. That was\nsufficient to put the employer on notice of the basis for\nthe complaint, and provided a basis for relief if proved\nat trial.\nThe Federal rules do not require that a party\ninclude additional facts that go beyond this, including\nwhat the employer calls here an inference of\ndiscrimination. Rule 9 makes clear that elements of\nconditions of mind, for instance, can be averred\ngenerally, and that includes matters such as intent and\nmotive, and the Federal rules certainly do not require\nthat the parties set forth all the elements of a prima\nfacie case under McDonnell Douglas v. Green.\nAs petitioner's counsel has pointed out, that\nruling of the Second Circuit basically confuses the\nrequirements for pleading a complaint, and the evidentiary\nburdens that a plaintiff would bear at trial in proving a\ndisparate treatment case in a situation where\ncircumstantial evidence was being used.\nQUESTION: Suppose a person simply feels -- he's\nbeen fired, and he thinks his work was good, and the\nemployer said it was bad, so he thinks, they couldn't have\nfired me because my work was bad. It's good. What reason\ncould there have been? Well, I sense an anti-Hungarian\natmosphere in this office. That's it. All right, so they\nwrite that into the complaint right there.\nNow, you see, I did good work, he said it was\nbad work, he fired me, and I think it's because I'm a\nHungarian, all right. Good faith. He believes it.\nNow -- automatically get discovery and costs,\nquite a lot of money?\nMR. MINEAR: You certainly do not\nautomatically --\nQUESTION: How could a judge refuse discovery on\nthat -- on these --\nMR. MINEAR: Very simply, the complaint in this\nsituation presents an issue of fact. Was there, or was\nthere not discrimination, and the Federal rules\ncontemplated the mechanism for resolving that issue was\nsummary judgment. In this case, the defendant's counsel\nis free to bring a motion --\nQUESTION: But we're talking about discovery.\nHow does the judge refuse discovery in my case?\nMR. MINEAR: It may be that a complete refusal\nof discovery is not appropriate, but what's important here\nis that Rule 16, which deals with pretrial conference,\ncoupled with Rule 26, regulating discovery, and Rule 56,\ndealing with --\nQUESTION: So then, what the Second Circuit is\nactually saying is, since the judge can't refuse discovery\nin my case, let's go back and look and see what the cause\nof action is, and the cause of action is such that my case\ndoesn't really fall within it. I mean, I'm trying to\nfigure out what they're driving at. It must be something\nlike that.\nMR. MINEAR: Well, I think that the problem the\nSecond Circuit discerned is, as Justice Scalia pointed\nout, it's very easy to allege discrimination and, in fact,\nit can sometimes be very difficult to prove it as well.\nThe Federal rules deal with the situation by providing a\nmechanism, by providing a procedure. The complaint is\nneeded to put the parties on notice of what the --\nQUESTION: Does the complaint, Mr. Minear,\nrequire you under the Federal rules to put in all the\nelements of a cause of action in order to survive a\n12(b)(6) motion?\nMR. MINEAR: Your Honor, no, it does not, and in\nfact this was one of the aims of the advisory committee in\n1938, when we revised the rule, to get away from the code\npractice of requiring the facts of the cause of action all\nbe pleaded. That led itself --\nQUESTION: That's why these rules religiously\navoid determining cause of action. You do not have to\nplead the elements of a cause of action.\nMR. MINEAR: That is exactly right, and I think\nthat principle is clearly enough established to be\nHornbook law. We cite a selection of the cases that deal\nwith this on page 13 of our brief.\nQUESTION: May I ask you one question? In\nparagraph 31 of the complaint, they refer to this\nmemorandum as outlining the plaintiff's grievances and\nrequesting -- outlining grievances, then the memorandum\nwas put into the record by the defendant and the judge\nreviewed the memorandum and thought it didn't really show\nany discrimination. He said at oral argument plaintiff's\ncounsel concedes that there's nothing in the memorandum\nfrom which an inference of age or national origin\ndiscrimination can be made, and if that were true, would\nthat provide any basis for a 12(b)(6) motion?\nMR. MINEAR: Well, if I can break down this\nquestion and answer it in several parts, first of all we\nagree it may well have been abuse of discretion for the\ndistrict court to have considered this memorandum rather\nthan converting the motion to summary judgment where\nquestions of fact and -- rather than having to take all\nthe inferences, giving all of the inferences to the\nplaintiff, the facts could be waived with regard to the\nmeaning of that memorandum.\nWe think that if the memorandum in fact provided\nno basis for this suit whatsoever and it was the only\nbasis on which the plaintiff had premised is claim, then\nthat might, in fact, be fatal to the complaint, but that's\nnot the situation here and, in fact, there are inferences\nthat can be drawn from that memorandum, such as the\nreference to a glass ceiling, that could be read favorably\nto the plaintiff to support his cause of action.\nQUESTION: You'd have to allow discovery anyway\nbefore you could rule under 12(b)(6), right?\nMR. MINEAR: Under the circumstances of\nconsidering this memorandum, I think it makes it very\ndifficult not being included in discovery, and I that\nmeans that it should be converted to a summary judgment\nmotion under Rule 12(b)(6).\nQUESTION: Yes. That's the difference,\nbasically, between a 12(b)(6) motion and a motion for\nsummary judgment, is that the 12(b)(6) is just on the\nbasis of the pleadings, and the summary judgment is,\npresumably you can consider affidavits and depositions\nthat are taken outside the pleadings.\nMR. MINEAR: That's exactly right, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: That's exactly what I meant, that you\ncouldn't get rid of the case on the basis of summary\njudgment without allowing discovery, so there's basically\nno way to prevent being subjected to discovery on the\nbasis of a claim by somebody who just suspects, with no\nreason to suspect, that he has been fired because he's\nHungarian.\nMR. MINEAR: I think that's not, strictly\nspeaking, true in this sense, that the way Rule 56 is\nstructured is that if the defendant makes the motion for\nsummary judgment the plaintiff is under an obligation to\ncome forward with the facts sufficient to indicate there's\na triable issue. If the plaintiff does not have those\nfacts, it can request discovery at that point.\nQUESTION: Well, what is it that -- how would\nyou describe the standard that's binding on the plaintiff\nand his attorney for firing the complaint, going back to\nJustice Breyer's question? You say, you know, I think\nthere could be something wrong here. I'd like to\ndiscover. Is that enough?\nMR. MINEAR: No, I don't think it's enough.\nQUESTION: It has to be well-founded suspicion.\nIs there some verbal formulation that floats around the\nlegal world, in the legal world that helps me?\nMR. MINEAR: I think the benchmark for the\ncomplaint is whether it provides the employer fair notice\nof the action. That's how the complaint --\nQUESTION: What is the standard of confidence,\nthe standard of belief that the plaintiff and the attorney\nmust have before starting the action?\nMR. MINEAR: I think that's set forth in Rule\n11, and that requires a good faith belief --\nQUESTION: A good faith belief?\nMR. MINEAR: Yes, a good faith belief that there\nare facts to support the action.\nNow, it may often be the case that the facts are\nnot --\nQUESTION: Well, you could have a good faith\nbelief that is entirely erroneous. I mean, I am sure that\nI was fired because I'm Hungarian. I don't know a single\nfact, but by God, I really believe that there are some\nfacts. Is that enough -- and he conveys that to his\nlawyer.\nMR. MINEAR: Well, this is the important role\nthat the lawyer and the officer of the court plays in\npolicing these efforts. The lawyer himself must make an\ninvestigation.\nQUESTION: Well, doesn't he have to investigate\nthe state of mind of the plaintiff to determine is bona\nfides, or does he -- is there some objective standard\nimplicit in the good faith, there have to be some\nobjective basis for the good faith belief?\nMR. MINEAR: Well, I'm not sure if we can fine-\ntune the standard here to that degree. I think the\nimportant point is that these facts, these issues can be\npromptly tested through summary judgment, and summary\njudgment is designed to deal summarily with those cases\nwhich are not substantial, that are not substantial.\nThere may be a requirement of some level of\ndiscovery, but the district court, who is -- has the tools\navailable to structure discovery, can limit discovery to\nthose issues that are in fact -- provide the --\nQUESTION: Your client says, you know, I can\ntell by looking at people whether they're lying or not,\nand I think the employer lied to me. I just can tell.\nMR. MINEAR: For a lawyer, I think that would be\nan insufficient basis on which to go forward.\nQUESTION: Mr. Minear, what is the status in\ntoday's trial where -- it's a long time ago, but we used\nto make -- see a lot of complaints where facts were\nalleged on information and belief, and therefore they\nwould set them out very particularly but not necessarily\nconclusively, but I don't see any information and belief\nallegations in this complaint. Is that approach used\ntoday at all?\nMR. MINEAR: It continues to be used, Your\nHonor.\nThank you.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Minear.\nMs. Brody, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LAUREN R. BRODY\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. BRODY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nThis case presents the question of whether a\nplaintiff must allege an inference of discrimination in\norder to stay the claim under title VII in the Age\nDiscrimination and Employment Act. The petitioner here\nalleged that his employment was terminated on account of\nhis national origin and age. The district court and the\ncourt of appeals both found that this allegation was\ninsufficient to sustain a claim, and that petitioner\nhad --\nQUESTION: May I ask you right at the outset,\nbecause I want to get to -- if the complaint itself,\nwithout illumination from the memorandum that you put in,\nwas sufficient, would he lose because you create a\ndifferent atmosphere from looking at the memorandum?\nMS. BRODY: Your Honor, no. The memorandum --\nQUESTION: So we can look at the case without\nlooking at the memorandum?\nMS. BRODY: You can look at the case without\nlooking at the memorandum, because the complaint alleges\nthat the memorandum outlined the petitioner's grievances\nwith the company and requested a severance package. There\nis nothing from that allegation which suggests that there\nwas any kind of discrimination, and that is sufficient in\norder for the court --\nQUESTION: 31 is not enough by itself, but there\nare other allegations in there to at least raise an\ninference, I think.\nMS. BRODY: There are no other allegations in\nthis complaint that raise an inference. What the\npetitioner has alleged here is generally that he was\nHungarian, that he was a Hungarian -- that he was of\nHungarian heritage --\nQUESTION: No, paragraph 37 alleges plaintiff's\nage and national origin were motivating factors in\nSorema's decision to terminate his employment. That's\npretty direct.\nMS. BRODY: Justice Stevens, that's conclusion.\nThat is not permitted by the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure or by this Court's decisions, including Conley\nv. Gibson, which said that in order to provide fair notice\nthe plaintiff must provide in the complaint a statement of\nthe claims that gives fair notice of what the claims is,\nas well as the grounds on which\nQUESTION: Well, why isn't that fair notice, Ms.\nBrody? He claimed the employer discriminated against him\nbecause of his nationality and because of his age.\nMS. BRODY: Yes, he does, Your Honor, but\nthat's -- Mr. Chief Justice, but that's a conclusion, and\nthat is not sufficient under Federal rules.\nQUESTION: What do you mean by saying it's a\nconclusion?\nMS. BRODY: It's a conclusion that does not set\nforth what Rule 8 requires, and Rule 8 says that you have\nto indicate what the grounds on which the claim is\nbased --\nQUESTION: Ms. Brody, why is it any more or less\nof a conclusion, any different from negligently drove?\nForm 9 says that's enough, just say negligent -- tell the\ntime and place and say, defendant negligently drove. You\ndon't have to say whether he was speeding, or went out of\nhis line, or anything like that. You just say negligent.\nIsn't that a conclusion, that he drove in a manner that\nwas negligent? What facts -- flush that out.\nMS. BRODY: Your Honor, if you look at that\ncomplaint, that Form 9 complaint, which alleges\nnegligence, it sets forth all the elements of the claim.\nIt alleges a duty. The defendant was driving on a highway\nand had an obligation to do so with care. It alleges a\nbreach of that duty, which is that he drove --\nQUESTION: I don't see that -- what you added\nmaybe so, but the form doesn't say that. It says, gives\nthe place, and it says, negligently drove.\nMS. BRODY: Those are reasonably inferences that\ncan be drawn from a very simple negligence action.\nQUESTION: Well, surely the same inferences\ncould be drawn here, couldn't they? It seems to me this\nis more precise, these allegations, than the allegations\nJustice Ginsburg just described about the simple word\nnegligently.\nMS. BRODY: Mr. Chief Justice, I don't believe\nthat's the case, because in the negligence action when an\nindividual drives a car into another individual, it can be\ninferred that negligence was involved in that.\nQUESTION: You don't have to infer it. It says\nit.\nMS. BRODY: It does say it, Your Honor, but in\nan employment situation, when an individual is terminated,\nindividuals are terminated every day.\nQUESTION: Yes, but here he alleged that he was\nterminated because of his nationality and because of his\nage.\nMS. BRODY: There is nothing that connects his\nnationality and his age with the termination of his\nemployment.\nQUESTION: Well, he -- but he says that he was\nterminated for that reason. I think if you want to have\nhim spell it out in more detail, you're asking that he\nplead evidence, which I don't think is required.\nMS. BRODY: Mr. Chief Justice, we are not asking\nthat a plaintiff plead evidence. We agree that that is\nnot appropriate at the pleading stage, and a complaint\ndoes not have to contain any evidence. All that a\ncomplaint has to contain are allegations based on the\nplaintiff's good faith belief that he was terminated\nbecause the circumstances indicated that there was\ndiscrimination.\nAll that the plaintiff has to allege is some\ninference of discrimination, and that inference is not the\nemployer's reason for the termination. There are\nsurrounding circumstances that occur when an employee is\nterminated. It does not occur in a vacuum, and this Court\nhas identified various circumstances under which the\ninference arises. It arises when one employee is treated\ndifferently than another employee because of their\nprotected class. It arises when --\nQUESTION: I thought there was a statement here\nthat other people who had been -- were not let go, people\nfor whom there was cause. wasn't there something to that\neffect?\nMS. BRODY: Justice Ginsburg, there is nothing\nin connection with the termination of employment that\nindicates that the petitioner was treated differently from\nother employees. There were allegations that were made\nrelating to an act that occurred 2 years later -- excuse\nme, 2 years earlier, in 1995, when the petitioner claims\nthat he was demoted, and he makes various allegations\nabout other individuals who were of different\nnationalities, different citizenships, and different ages,\nbut he does not connect any of those allegations to his\nsituation, which is being a United States citizen of\nHungarian heritage.\nThe problem is that those prior allegations\nrelating to an act which occurred prior to his termination\nand which are time-barred do not have any reference --\nQUESTION: But he can still use them to show\nthat is the mind set of the employer.\nIt seems to me that you are asking to have facts\nalleged in this complaint which, like it or not, the\nFederal rules don't require.\nMS. BRODY: Justice Ginsburg, I respectfully\ndisagree. We were not asking the petitioner to allege\nfacts. We were only asking him to make good faith\nallegations which would give rise to some inference of\ndiscrimination.\nQUESTION: Sorry, then I'm confused, because\nI -- you don't -- an inference isn't the kind of thing\nthat you allege. An inference is the kind of thing that\nyou make, so you must be saying he has to allege facts\nthat would give rise to an inference, or if you -- are you\nsaying that?\nMS. BRODY: That -- facts, factual allegations.\nQUESTION: That would -- you have -- he has to\nallege certain facts that would give rise to an inference,\nall right.\nMS. BRODY: That is correct.\nQUESTION: What he did allege was, he alleged as\na matter of fact over 2 years people who he alleges were\nfactually less qualified and were either younger or not\nHungarian obtained all kinds of advantages that he did\nnot, and then he was fired because of his grievances, and\na fair reading is that is both a factual allegation, and\ngrievance refers to what he called -- said earlier in the\ncomplaint, so why don't those facts give rise to an\ninference that his -- what he said was the conclusion?\nMS. BRODY: Those allegations import into this\ncase a concept which has never been asserted, and that is\nthis continuing violation theory. The petitioner -- there\nare two separate acts here. There is a demotion and a\ntermination, and the petitioner is trying to link those by\nmaking the conclusory allegation that there was ongoing\ndiscrimination during this 2-year period, but this Court\nhas already held in Rix that a conclusory allegation like\nthat cannot link two separate acts.\nWhat we need to do is look at the circumstances\nat the time of the termination of employment.\nQUESTION: Which case are you mentioning now?\nMS. BRODY: Rix v. Delaware State College.\nQUESTION: Was that a 12(b)(6) case?\nMS. BRODY: That was a 12(b)(6) case, Your\nHonor.\nQUESTION: And the complaint was held\ninsufficient?\nMS. BRODY: The complaint was held insufficient,\nand this Court refused --\nQUESTION: Well, it was held to be time-barred\nbecause the relevant time was when he lost his seniority,\nrather than when he was terminated, and here you're\narguing that the only evidence of discrimination is that\nduring the 2 or 3 years before they treated the French\nemployees better than the Hungarian employees, and it's\nunreasonable to infer from that that the discharge was\nsimilarly motivated.\nMS. BRODY: That is correct.\nQUESTION: And they say it was, and so there's\nan issue of fact.\nMS. BRODY: But it's not a matte of\nunreasonableness. It's a matter of, there's one act which\nis time-barred, and there's a second act, and you could\nnot link them, especially in this particular case, where\nthe allegations relating to the so-called demotion are\ntotally directed to the demotion and don't carry over into\nthe termination of an employment.\nQUESTION: But if even one of them was a good\nclaim, it shouldn't have been dismissed. Are you saying\nthat neither the demotion nor the termination is\nsufficiently pleaded?\nMS. BRODY: The demotion claim cannot be\nconsidered because it's time-barred. The petitioner did\nnot file an EEOC charge issue within 300 days of that act,\nso that is something that is an unfortunate event in\nhistory, as has been stated by the Court in Rix, and it\ncannot be used to bolster a claim that occurred, or that\nmight have arisen 2 years later. The fact that an\nemployer, and we don't think he did, may have taken an act\nthat was discriminated, was discriminatory 2 years prior\nto the act that is the subject matter of the complaint,\ndoesn't mean that the second act is also discriminatory,\nand they cannot be combined and put together --\nQUESTION: Well, why not? I mean, it doesn't\nmean, of course, that it is, but it is evidence that it\nis.\nMS. BRODY: Your Honor, in certain situations\nsuch as a harassment case where there is -- are continuing\nacts of discrimination that occur, that might be\nappropriate, but in a case like this, where separate and\ndiscrete acts are being alleged, and the first act was\ncompleted in 1995 -- nothing more happened after that --\nthere is no reasonable basis for linking these two acts\ntogether and basing the termination on the demotion\nallegations. In fact, to do so would really circumvent\nthe statute of limitations, because it would permit a\nplaintiff to base a present claim on a time-barred claim,\nand that --\nQUESTION: Well, does he nowhere allege that his\nfiring was because he was Hungarian, or because he was --\nbecause of his age?\nMS. BRODY: He makes the conclusory allegations\nthat I was terminated because of my national origin and\nage, but that does not -- that alone is not sufficient to\nsustain the claim, a claim, and that is what this Court\nhas stated in Conley, in which it emphasized that the\nplaintiff had to set forth the grounds on which the claim\nrests.\nI believe that this Court also has endorsed that\nview in the other 12(b)(6) cases that it has considered,\nsuch as Rix, such as Sutton, which Justice O'Connor went\nthrough and analyzed the statutory elements of the claims\nto determine whether or not the claims had met them.\nQUESTION: What was lacking in Conley? What was\nlacking?\nMS. BRODY: There was nothing lacking in the\ncomplaint in Conley. In fact, if you look at it, it\nalleges all the elements of the claim, and it does so on a\nrather specific basis. It states in Conley that there\nwere 45 positions that were purportedly abolished that\nwere held by African Americans. The complaint then goes\non to allege that Caucasians were hired to fill those 45\npositions. It then goes on to allege that the union did\nnot represent the plaintiffs in that case and did not try\nto protect their jobs, and then it says there's a\nviolation of the statute.\nWhat the defendant was trying to do in Conley\nwas to get specific and particular information about what\nprovisions of the collective bargaining agreement were\nviolated and other specific information which is not\nrequired, so that if you look at all of the complaints\nthat have been considered by this Court and even by the\ncircuit courts, you see that each of those complaints are\nsufficient on their face and they contain more than enough\nallegations to state the elements of the claims.\nQUESTION: But unfortunately you don't have any\nin which we find a complaint insufficient because it does\nnot contain that detail. I mean, that's what you need. I\nmean, you might well say all these cases in which we've\napproved going forward with the litigation stated a lot\nmore, but what you need is a case where we approved\ngranting the 12(b)(6) motion because there was not enough\ndetail.\nMS. BRODY: I --\nQUESTION: That's hard to find.\nMS. BRODY: I think the case that we have, the\nbest case that we have to refer to is the Sutton case,\nwhere the Court looked at each of the allegations of the\ncomplaint, determined whether or not the plaintiff was\ndisabled, and refused to accept the conclusory allegation\nthat the plaintiff made that she was disabled.\nQUESTION: It wasn't because the allegations\nweren't sufficiently detailed. It was because accepting\nthe truth of all the details set forth in the complaint,\nit didn't state what the Court regarded as a violation of\nthe statutes.\nMS. BRODY: That's correct.\nQUESTION: I mean, that would be like saying in\nthis case, well, even if he were -- his age and national\norigin were motivating factors in the decision, that\ndoesn't violate the statute, you have to do something\nmore, and I suppose maybe you could argue that, that\nmotivation isn't enough, it's got to be the sole cause, or\nsomething like that.\nMS. BRODY: Your Honor --\nQUESTION: There was plenty -- it isn't -- the\nSutton case was not an absence of detail in the complaint.\nMS. BRODY: And Your Honor, this is not a case\nabout the absence of detail or specificity. This is a\ncase about allegations being made giving rise to some sort\nof inference, some sort of suggestion, some hint of\ndiscrimination, and there is nothing here --\nQUESTION: That sounds like evidence again.\nThere is notice that the complaint is that I was fired\nbecause of my age and my national origin. Now, it's --\nthis case comes to us from the Second Circuit, and that's\nwhy I mentioned Dioguardi v. Durning, because even if it\ndoesn't come from this Court, I assumed that what Judge\nClark wrote way back then is still law of the circuits,\nfor the Second Circuit, which is why I find it very\npuzzling this Court reached the result it did.\nMS. BRODY: Your Honor, if you look at the\nDioguardi complaint you will see that all of the elements\nof the claim are alleged in that complaint.\nQUESTION: What do you mean by elements? I\nthought it was, indeed, Hornbook law that you are not\nrequired under the Federal rules to plead the elements\nthat constitute a, quote, cause of action?\nMS. BRODY: That is correct, Your Honor, but\nthere has to be something in the complaint that goes to\nthe heart of the claim and, in a discrimination case, the\nheart of the claim is the discrimination. In a breach of\ncontract case, the heart of the claim is the breach, and\nif you identify the contract, you identify the breach, you\nidentify the injury, you have satisfied the elements, or\nthe essence of that claim, and that is required in a\ndiscrimination case.\nQUESTION: Well, wait --\nQUESTION: And what he did was not equivalent to\ndefendant owes plaintiff X dollars for goods sold and\ndelivered on a certain date.\nMS. BRODY: No, Your Honor. No, Your -- he's\nnot made the showing that Rule 8 requires, and there's a\nreason that the word showing is used in Rule 8. It\ndoesn't say, all you have to do is identify the claim --\nthis is a title VII claim -- and it doesn't say that then\nyou can follow that by conclusion I was discharged because\nof my national origin --\nQUESTION: There's a lot more than that in this\ncomplaint. It does run on for several pages doesn't it?\nMS. BRODY: It goes on for several pages, but\nthe facts do not support the conclusion, that is, the\nfactual allegations, and there are factual allegations in\nthis complaint, and interestingly, petitioner doesn't\nclaim that he doesn't have to allege that he was a member\nof a protected class, he doesn't claim that he doesn't\nhave to allege that he was qualified, and he doesn't claim\nthat he did not have to allege that there was an adverse\nemployment action. All he claims is that he doesn't have\nto set forth any allegations that would give rise to this\ninference of discrimination, and it doesn't necessarily\nhave to be the inference. It just has to be --\nQUESTION: Those elements are not necessary\nfor -- to win, are they? They're necessary to establish a\nprima facie case that would insulate you against a\npreliminary dismissal, but you can win a case without\nestablishing the prima facie elements.\nI mean, suppose I can't show that I'm a member\nof a protected class, but -- and I can't show that other\npeople were fired, but what happened in this case is that\nthis employer just had a thing against white male Anglo\nSaxons, clearly not a protected class, but it was\nbecause -- and I have evidence that will prove that, that\nI was fired because I was a white male Anglo Saxon, and\nthis employer just hated white male Anglo Saxons. That's\na valid complaint, isn't it?\nMS. BRODY: Your Honor, you would have to look\nat the four corners of the complaint and determine whether\nthere were any other allegations in it.\nQUESTION: No, but you're arguing this case as\nthough it is an essential -- it is essential to win a\ntitle VII claim that you establish a prima facie case, and\nI don't think it is.\nMS. BRODY: Your Honor, I believe under\nMcDonnell Douglas if you're going to base your claim on an\ninferential case that you do need to allege and prove the\nelements of the prima facie case.\nQUESTION: Unless you have other manners of\nestablishing liability.\nMS. BRODY: That is correct.\nQUESTION: And those are questions of fact which\nneed not be pleaded. Those are the evidentiary proof.\nMS. BRODY: Your Honor, the word evidence has\nbeen used frequently, and neither the court of appeals,\nthe district court, or the respondent here is suggesting\nthat a petitioner or plaintiff must allege facts or set\nforth evidence. All he has to do is have a good faith\nbasis for making allegations, and if you look at all the\ndiscrimination cases that have come before this case,\ngoing back to McDonnell Douglas, there has always been an\nallegation of some inference of discrimination, and\nthat --\nQUESTION: I've never seen an allegation of an\ninference. I've only seen an allegation of facts, and I\nbring this up again because now you say he doesn't have to\nallege facts, but I thought your whole case was he did\nhave to allege facts.\nMS. BRODY: The case is that he has to make\nfactual allegations.\nQUESTION: Okay. Then you're saying he has to\nallege facts.\nMS. BRODY: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And so -- all right. I don't want to\ngo in circles, but I want to be sure that you agree about\nthat. You're talking about a failure to allege certain\nfacts.\nMS. BRODY: Yes. Allegations are based on\nfacts, and I think that you have to make allegations which\nhave some factual basis in order to go forward with the\ncase.\nQUESTION: Well, in addition to what he said, he\nalso said that everybody else, and he names about 10\npeople, who were dismissed were dismissed for cause and\ngiven severance benefits, but he was dismissed without\ncause and wasn't given severance benefits. Well, that\nseems directly related to the dismissal and, moreover,\nreading it in light of what he said before, he alleges as\na conclusion that this shows I was dismissed without\nseverance because of my nationality or because of my age.\nWhy aren't those facts that give rise to an inference, at\nleast as much as, I was in an accident and therefore he's\nnegligent?\nMS. BRODY: Because those allegations alone are\ninsufficient in that he does not allege the national\norigin of any of those individuals, some of whom could be\nHungarian. He doesn't state. He doesn't allege the age\nof those individuals who were terminated and allegedly\nreceived severance packages. For all we know, they could\nbe over 50. There's nothing that indicates that those\npeople received the treatment that they did because of\ntheir national origin.\nQUESTION: But is that really essential to\npleading a claim for relief here? I mean, supposing he\nhad left out what happened to these six people and simply\nsaid that he was dismissed from his employment because he\nwas Hungarian and because of his age, what more than what\nI've just said ought he to have alleged to have complied\nwith the bare minimum?\nMS. BRODY: What he ought to have alleged is the\nkind of allegation that is alleged in McDonnell Douglas,\nthat is alleged in McDonald v. Santa Fe, that is alleged\nin Rix. All these allegations in all these cases raise --\nQUESTION: But McDonnell Douglas I don't think\nwas ever meant to be a pleading requirement. It was a\nway, as Justice Scalia said, to survive summary judgment\nand get to the jury.\nMS. BRODY: McDonnell Douglas can be used as a\npleading requirement, and it is sensible for it to be so\nused --\nQUESTION: Well --\nMS. BRODY: -- because at the pleading stage --\nQUESTION: I think many of us would agree with\nyou that it would be sensible for it to be so used, but\nthe rules just don't provide for it.\nMS. BRODY: McDonnell Douglas reflects title\nVII. It incorporates the provisions of title VII, and in\norder to eventually prove a title VII case, which is an\ninferential case, you're going to have to plead the\nelements --\nQUESTION: There's a huge difference between\npleading a case and proving a case, and pleading a case\ndoes not require you to put forward your evidence. You\ncould ask pinpointed questions. You say what was wrong\nwith this is they didn't identify the national origin,\nwhatever. You send a set of interrogatories, get the\nanswers to those questions, and if they show that\neverybody else is Hungarian, he's out of court.\nYou could have asked for a more definite\nstatement, I suppose, if you said this is so vague I can't\nanswer it.\nMS. BRODY: Your Honor, the idea that a\ncomplaint need only allege a conclusion in order to\nproceed with discovery and summary judgment and trial --\nQUESTION: This count, Rule 11 -- this person\nwas represented before the district court, right?\nMS. BRODY: Correct.\nQUESTION: In fact, the same counsel, and there\nwas a representation to the court made by the attorney\nunder Rule 11 that says there's a good basis in law and\nfact for this charge. Does that count for nothing?\nMS. BRODY: That does count for something, but\nthe problem which we're addressing here is that there are\nnot sufficient allegations in this complaint which\nindicate that discrimination has anything to do with --\nQUESTION: And the best case you have for that\nis the statute of limitations case, which is an\naffirmative defense that, if the time is up, that's it.\nThere's nothing -- you could have all the beautiful facts\nin the world, so that statute of limitations, you can\nanswer the complaint with that and get summary judgment on\nthis spot, or even, arguably, 12(b)(6), but you have given\nthe statute of limitations as the only pleading case. The\nothers were all cases that plaintiffs won, and you're\nsearching for language that you can pull out of them to\nsay, ah, but in other circumstances they would have lost.\nMS. BRODY: I think that if you look at McDonald\nv. Santa Fe Trail you will see that the Court there\nutilized McDonnell Douglas on a 12(b)(6) motion, and it\nexamined the allegations in the complaint there to\ndetermine whether or not the plaintiff had alleged facts\nwhich could give rise to an inference of discrimination.\nThat was one of the issues in McDonnell Douglas, and that\nis a case where this Court applied McDonnell Douglas and\nrequired an inference of discrimination.\nQUESTION: What case are you referring to now?\nMS. BRODY: That is the case, McDonald v. Santa\nFe Trail Transportation.\nQUESTION: That was a dismissal under 12(b)(6)?\nMS. BRODY: That was a dismissal on a 12(b)(6).\nThe other case that I would refer the Court to\nis Baldwin County Welcome Center v. Brown, which is a case\nwhere this Court held that a right-to-sue letter issued by\nthe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission did not\nconstitute a complaint because it did not comply with Rule\n8 notice and did not set forth the factual basis for a\nclaim.\nA right-to-sue letter has all the information\nthat the plaintiff put in his --\nQUESTION: You have to file a paper that's\ncalled the complaint, and a right-to-sue letter is not\nthat. You can't go into court and say, here's a nice\nletter, court, and I'd like you to proceed. You have to\nhave a complaint. The rules say that. The right-to-sue\nletter isn't a complaint, so I don't think that takes you\nvery far.\nMS. BRODY: Well, I don't believe that you have\nto have a document that's entitled, Complaint, in order to\nfile it as a complaint with the court.\nThis Court did not hold that the right-to-sue\nletter was not appropriate as a complaint because of its\ntitle. This Court held that there were no factual\nallegations contained in that complaint for which a basis\nof the claim could be stated.\nQUESTION: I'm confused. The right-to-sue\nletter would have come from the EEOC.\nMS. BRODY: That's correct, and the plaintiff in\nthat case took the right-to-sue letter, went to court, and\nfiled it.\nQUESTION: But that was not the plaintiff's\npleading. That was a notice from the EEOC.\nMS. BRODY: Well, the plaintiff called that his\npleading, and he proceeded on that as his pleading.\nQUESTION: May I ask you just one question, as\nhaving studied the complaint as carefully as you have? Do\nyou interpret the charge that your client was\ndiscriminating against this person because he was\nHungarian, or because he was not French?\nMS. BRODY: Your Honor, that's an excellent\nquestion, and I think there has been a use of these terms\nvery loosely. I believe that what he petitioner is\narguing is the latter point, that he was discriminated\nagainst because he was not French, and I believe it was\nbecause he was not a French citizen. He alleges that\nthese other individuals in the company were French\nnational.\nIn his EEOC charge he makes clear that he\nregards them as French citizens and, in fact, one of them,\none of these French nationals is actually of Greek\nheritage, so the discrimination that we re talking about\nhere is really not based on national origin at all. It's\nbased on citizenship and, as this Court knows from\nEspinoza, that is not covered by title VII. It isn't a\nproper basis for a discrimination claim.\nQUESTION: The case that you cited, Santa Fe,\nthat was a case that the plaintiff -- where the plaintiff\nprevailed against the 12(b)(6).\nMS. BRODY: Yes, Your Honor, that is correct.\nQUESTION: Well, I thought you gave that to us\nas an example of where McDonnell Douglas had been applied\nat the pleading stage to dismiss the case on 12(b)(6)\ngrounds.\nMS. BRODY: Oh, Your Honor, I may have misspoke\non that, but the Court --\nQUESTION: So all of your cases, then, are cases\nin which the plaintiff surmounted the 12(b)(6) hurdle, and\nthere's language in that -- you -- for this mythical case\nthat hasn't yet occurred.\nMS. BRODY: Your Honor, I think that Rix, I\nthink that Evans, and I think that Sutton area 11 cases\nwhere the claims were dismissed, which assist us in this\ncase and indicate the kind of notice that is required,\nbecause even though --\nQUESTION: If I allege that the defendant gave\nme a dirty look, I'm going to be tossed out on 12(b)(6),\nand I could describe all the grimaces and everything else,\nand it won't do me any good because the law doesn't\nrecognize such a claim.\nMS. BRODY: That is correct. That is correct.\nQUESTION: That's --\nMS. BRODY: However, that's in effect what this\nplaintiff did. He wrote this memorandum in which he\ncomplained about his treatment by the company.\nQUESTION: I thought when you -- there is\nevidence outside the four corners of the complaint, then\nyou can bring it as a Rule 56 summary judgment motion, not\na 12(b)(6) motion, so technically that, if you're supposed\nto look only to the complaint on a 12(b)(6) motion that\nshould not have been considered.\nMS. BRODY: Your Honor, I think that it is\nuniversally recognized that if a document is referred to\nand relied on in the complaint, it is regarded as being\nincorporated into the complaint, and it's proper for the\nCourt to look at it on a 12(b)(6) motion.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Brody.\nMS. BRODY: Thank you.\nQUESTION: Mr. Goodman, you have 1 minute\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF HAROLD I. GOODMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. GOODMAN: Just to follow up on Justice\nGinsburg's comment about McDonald, on the very point\nraised, the complaint was sustained and not denied. At\n427 U.S. 283, footnote 11, the Court held that there was\nno requirement for particularity as defendant had\nrequested, and thus sustained the complaint.\nSecond, and last, in 1953 the Ninth Circuit\nrecommended to the advisory committee that Rule 8, too, be\namended to add this phrase at the end, namely the\nstatement in the complaint shall contain facts\nconstituting a cause of action. In 1955, the court's\nadvisory committee rejected it. It said that it only\nrequires a general statement.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\n"
