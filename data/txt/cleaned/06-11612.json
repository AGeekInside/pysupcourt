NEWTON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. NEWTON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nPetitioner was not present at the bench\nconference and did not have the assistance of an\ninterpreter when the magistrate judge solicited his\nattorney's consent to conduct jury selection. The\nrecord does not reflect the Petitioner personally\nconsented or ever learned of his attorney's consent.\nWhether defense counsel CAN unilaterally waive a\ncriminal defendant's right to an Article III judge at\njury selection, as occurred in this case, is a serious\nconstitutional question. Applying the constitutional\navoidance doctrine, this Court should avoid answering\nthis question by interpreting the \"Additional Duties\"\nClause of the Federal Magistrates Act to require\ndefendant's explicit personal waiver of the right to an\nArticle III judge at felony jury selection.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Newton, you're not\nclaiming in this case that the defendant was any way\ndisadvantaged by the magistrate judge conducting the\nvoir dire, are you?\nMR. NEWTON: I'm contending that the denial\nof his right to an Article III judge at felony jury\nselection violated his rights.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there was no\nobjection to any of the proceedings by the magistrate\njudge. There were no objections to any -- well, she\ndidn't do the questioning. She allowed the lawyer to do\nthe questioning.\nMR. NEWTON: Well, I think it was a\ncombination, Your Honor. No, we're not making any\nallegation of discrete error during the jury selection\nprocess. We're contending that there should have been a\npersonal waiver of the right to an Article III judge.\nThe \"Additional Duties\" Clause --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This may not be a\npertinent question, but where does the right to voir\ndire come from in the first place?\nMR. NEWTON: The Court has discussed the\nright to voir dire in capital cases and in non-capital\ncases as it relates to the right to a fair trial, the\nright to an impartial jury --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it's derivative\nfrom other rights? In other words, it helps implement\nthe right to a fair trial, in the Batson context helps\nguard against an equal protection violation, but it's\nnot on its own a free-standing right.\nMR. NEWTON: Well, Your Honor, I would say\nthat the Court has said that, in a Federal case\nparticularly, you have a right to an Article III,\nSection 2 right to a jury, as well as a Sixth Amendment\nright, and the Court has referred to this as an\nallocation of Federal judicial power in the people as\nwell as in judges. So selecting the jury obviously is a\n-- has constitutional implications with respect to the\nstructure of Article III as well as any personal right a\ndefendant may have to -- to an impartial duty.\nThe \"Additional Duties\" Clause is silent\nabout the type of waiver or consent required and the\nsilence is understandable.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, where a defendant is\nwaiving a jury trial or pleading guilty, that's\nsomething that an ordinary person can probably readily\nunderstand. But how likely is it that an ordinary\ndefendant is going to have any kind of independent\nopinion on the question of whether it's better for the\nvoir dire to be presided over by a district judge as\nopposed to a magistrate judge? Isn't the situation\ngoing to be in the vast, vast majority of cases that\nyour client will simply turn to you and say, which do\nyou think is better, and whatever the lawyer recommends,\nthat's what the client is going to do? Isn't that the\nrealistic situation?\nMR. NEWTON: Your Honor, I don't think\nthat's necessarily true. I've had -- I represent people\nin trial court as well as on appeal, and I've had many\nclients who like district judges better than magistrates\nor magistrates better than district judges, depending on\nhow they've encountered them in prior proceedings. So I\ndon't think that's an assumption I would make.\nAnd, more importantly, other personal\nrights -- the right to a grand jury, a petty jury --\nthose are rights that a lot of defendants don't\nunderstand. I've had to explain to foreign clients what\na jury is because they don't have juries in foreign\ncountries.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there's a big\ndifference between having a judge trial and a jury of\none's peers. The difference between having a magistrate\njudge and an Article III judge to do the voir dire\ndoesn't have -- is not a question of the same dimension.\nMR. NEWTON: Well, Your Honor, it's hard to\nput these rights in terms of relative importance. The\nFramers clearly believed Article III independence was\nessential to our separation of powers and to the rights\nof defendants. John Marshall -- the Court in Hatter\nquoted from former Chief Justice John Marshall saying\nthat the rights -- the right to an independent judge is\nperhaps most important in a -- in a criminal case\nbecause the rights of the most powerful person, the\nprosecutor, versus --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, we're not talking\nabout a trial. We're talking about the voir dire. And\nperhaps you could tell me one piece of information. In\nthe Federal proceedings that I've observed, it's always\nthe judge who does the questioning, and this one seemed\nto me extraordinary. The magistrate said it was her\npractice to let the lawyers do it, right?\nMR. NEWTON: Well, certain judges in Federal\ncourt tend to give the lawyers a lot of leeway. Other\nones -- other judges I've appeared before do it\nthemselves. I think it depends. But ultimately it's\nthe magistrate who is ruling on challenges for cause or\nruling on what questions are appropriate.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Whose thumb is the\nmagistrate under? Is he under the thumb of Article I or\nArticle II or Article III?\nMR. NEWTON: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Who decides whether he\nstays on or she stays on as a magistrate?\nMR. NEWTON: Article III judges are the ones\nwho select magistrate judges --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So we're really not talking\nhere about giving away any Article III power. I mean,\nthe magistrate is only subject to Article III.\nMR. NEWTON: Well, Your Honor, the\nmagistrate judges have been permitted to exercise the\nattributes of Article III power when they are adjuncts.\nThe Court in Gomez unanimously thought that the\nmagistrate's role at felony jury selection was not\nreally that of an adjunct because there was no\nmeaningful Article III review of the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That may well be, but the\nreason -- the reason presumably is that an Article III\njudge, which goes -- who goes through a much more\nsubstantial process of selection and confirmation is\nmuch more qualified. Now, if you want to make that\nargument, that's fine, but that's a quite different\nargument from saying that we're giving away Article III\npowers to magistrates, right? Magistrates are creatures\nof Article III.\nMR. NEWTON: Well, I think it's a twofold\nargument. It's one that we presume that Article III\njudges who have gone through the Senate confirmation and\npresidential appointment process, that they are more\nqualified as a general rule. But it is also an Article\nIII exercise of power because magistrate judges do not\nhave those protections that Article III provides to\nlife-tenured district judges. So it is -- it's both of\nthose things.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Would you go back to I\nthink it was to Justice Ginsburg's question about the\ncomparative significance of the waiver here. The\nparadigm examples of waivers that have to be personal\nare, you know, waivers of counsel, waivers of the right\nto put the State to trial. This question of waiving an\nArticle III judge as opposed to an Article III appointed\nmagistrate just does not seem to rise to the\nsignificance of -- of the -- of the -- of those other\nparadigm waivers and what is -- what is your response to\nthat? You started to say that, you know, that the\nFramers said Article III judges are important because\nthey -- they have independence and so on. But beyond\nthat kind of high theoretical level, is there anything\nin practical terms that you think brings this kind of a\nwaiver to the point of significance of, say, waiving\ncounsel?\nMR. NEWTON: Yes, Your Honor. There are\nbasically three characteristics that I can discern in\nthe Court's jurisprudence about other personal rights\nthat must be personally waived by a defendant on the\nrecord. First of all, it obviously must be a\nfundamental right, and I think that the Court's\ndecisions in Hatter and Gomez and the plurality opinion\nin Northern Pipeline, -- all those decisions I think\nestablish that the right to an Article III judge at a\ncritical stage of a criminal case is a fundamental\nright. But there's more than just that. That's\nnecessary but not sufficient, because we have lots of\nfundamental rights that can be waived during the trial\nby the attorney.\nThe other two characteristics are I think\nwhat distinguish this right and make it more like\nwaiving counsel and waiving a petit jury and a grand\njury and the right to go to trial at all. And besides\nbeing fundamental, the second characteristic is that\nthis right concerns the players in the game as opposed\nto the rules of the game, the framework of the\nproceedings in the sense of the players. The right to a\njury trial, the right to a grand jury, the right to\ncounsel, those are rights that concern the players in\nthe game, as opposed to, say, the confrontational --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I see what you're\ndoing. You're constructing your argument so that we\nhave structural protections. I can understand that\nargument, but Justice Souter's question points out just\nas a practical matter this is not nearly as important as\na failure to object to illegally seized evidence, a post\n-- a post-arrest delay, open courtroom, all of which are\nsubject to waiver.\nMR. NEWTON: Well, Your Honor, if I can\nanswer your question, but also the third characteristic.\nThe third characteristic of this kind of right is\ntiming, how it's waived. The Court in Barker v. Wingo\nsaid these personal rights are to be waived at a\ndiscrete point in time, as opposed to something during\nthe heat of battle of the adversarial process. So --\nand I would respectfully disagree that the right to an\nArticle III judge, at least the right to have it without\na personal waiver, is a fundamental right. This is\nsomething the Framers considered to be of utmost\nimportance, and in Hatter the Court said the\nconsiderations that led the Framers to believe this was\nan extremely important right --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I was interested in\nyour comment on trying cases, but to say that you have\nto sit down and explain to the -- to the defendant the\ndifference between the magistrate and an Article III and\nwhy you like this particular magistrate -- it's the\nattorney that does all the questioning, after all -- it\nseems to me is -- is a burden. It's not justified by\nthe position that you're -- you're submitting to us.\nMR. NEWTON: Well, Your Honor, Congress has\nmade the judgment that this is such a fundamental right\nthat it must be personally waived by a defendant.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In practice, it's\nmore a tactical decision than a theoretical one. I mean\nyou can explain to your client the difference between\nArticle III and a magistrate, but he's going to be more\ninterested in your judgment about, oh, judge so and so\ndoesn't let you get away with anything on voir dire, you\nknow, he runs a tight ship. This magistrate will let me\nraise all sorts of other things. I mean, it's like an\nobjection at trial, in other words. It's going to be a\ntactical decision rather than a theoretical\nconstitutional one.\nMR. NEWTON: Your Honor, the very same thing\ncould be said of waiving a jury or a grand jury.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if you get to\nthat point, which case of ours holds that the right to a\njury trial is a personal right that the defendant must\nwaive rather than waive through counsel?\nMR. NEWTON: Two cases Your Honor: Patton\nv. United States, 1932, and Adams ex rel. U.S. v.\nMcCann, which reaffirmed, and the Court has cited those\ntwo cases repeatedly for the proposition that this is a\nright that must be personally waived. The fact that\nthere is a --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You say it was the holding\nin Patton?\nMR. NEWTON: Patton I suppose would have\nbeen --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I suppose it was dicta.\nMR. NEWTON: But it became enshrined in\nAdams, and it has been cited repeatedly for that\nproposition. The rule reflects it. The rule of\ncriminal procedure reflects it. The fact that there is\na strategic or a tactical aspect --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought what Adams stood\nfor was that the defendant can himself waive the right\nto jury without advice of counsel, that if he wants to\ndo it on his own he can do it without counsel. It\ndoesn't mean that if counsel does it without his\nobjection at the time it's invalid.\nMR. NEWTON: Well, Your Honor, it's -- the\nlanguage in Adams which quotes from Patton says it must\nbe the express, intelligent consent of the defendant,\nwhich has been widely interpreted as personal --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that can be\nexpressed through counsel. I mean, does -- you know,\ndoes your client consent to this? Yes.\nI mean it's quite a different question to\nsay that he has to be the one who stands up in court and\nsays it.\nMR. NEWTON: Well, my alternative position\nis, at the very least, the record needs to reflect that\nwhen counsel speaks, counsel is directly speaking with\nthe approval of the client.\nIn Peretz that was the situation. In Peretz\nthe pretrial conference involved a waiver by the defense\nattorney in the presence of his client and then followed\nup by -- at the jury selection process the magistrate\nsaid: Mr. Attorney, do I have the consent of \"your\nclient\"? And this was, again, in the presence of the\ndefendant.\nThat's in marked contrast to what we have in\nthis case, which is all indications were going to be it\nwas going to be Judge Kazen picking the jury, the\nArticle III judge. And, then, all of a sudden, the\nmagistrate judge appears and directs only the attorneys\nto come to the bench.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You were referring a\nwhile back to the Gomez case. And if I remember that\ncase correctly, it was the defense counsel who made the\nobjection to the magistrate; and there's nothing to\nindicate whether the defense counsel had done that in\nconsultation with the defendant. We don't have any idea\nwhat the defendant's wishes were, but it was the\ndefendant -- it was the lawyer who raised the objection.\nMR. NEWTON: Well, Your Honor, I think\nthat's distinguishable because when one is objecting to\nthe violation of a right, that's different from\nacquiescing in a knowing and voluntary and intelligent\nwaiver of the right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It was the lawyer's\nchoice, and we have no indication that it wasn't -- it\nwas anything other than the strategic choice of the\nlawyer. And your position is that it must come from the\nclient, and there's no indication that it did in the\nGomez case.\nMR. NEWTON: Well, Your Honor, in Gomez it\nwas an objection to a alleged violation of Article III,\nas opposed to a waiver of the right to an Article III\njudge. So it's -- it's the converse of what we have in\nthis case.\nIn this case, there was no showing on the\nrecord implicitly or explicitly that Mr. Gonzalez,\nPetitioner in this case, waived or knowingly acquiesced\nin his attorney's waiver.\nI want to return, if I could, to -- to\nCongress's intent. In 18 U.S.C. Section 3401(b),\nCongress was crystal clear they believed in a\nmisdemeanor case the waiver of a right to an Article III\njudge had to be personal and expressed by the Defendant.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But, of course, that\nwas for the whole trial. This is for a very discrete\naspect prior to trial.\nMR. NEWTON: In Peretz the Court equated an\nentire delegation of a misdemeanor trial to delegation\nof felony jury selection. They were comparable, the\nCourt said. The dissent in that case, at least Justice\nMarshall's dissent, said it's more important. So we\nhave at least eight members --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Peretz, also, if I\nunderstand the case correctly, equated the waiver with a\nfailure to object. It seems to me that Peretz undercuts\nyour argument.\nMR. NEWTON: Well, Your Honor, as I -- as I\nthink I've explained in the brief, Peretz is full of\nmany statements that are ambiguous. But everything in\nPeretz has --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you say they are\nambiguous, but isn't it -- I've reread Peretz after many\nyears getting ready for this argument, and it seems to\nme that it's difficult to read Peretz without reading\nthe \"waiver failure to object\" phraseology as being\nequivalent.\nMR. NEWTON: Well, Your Honor, Peretz has to\nbe read in light of two things:\nOne, it has to be read in light of the facts\nof that case where there was a failure to object after\nthe attorney had personally -- or had stated his client\npersonally considered it. Secondly, Peretz was decided\nbefore the Court in Olano distinguished between waivers\nand forfeitures. \"Consent,\" even in the Fourth\nAmendment context, means at least knowing acquiescence.\n\"Waiver\" clearly means an intentional and knowing\nrelinquishment of a right, and mere silence cannot be\ninterpreted as -- a mere failure to object cannot be --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, yes, but --\neverybody concedes that, but the question is by whom?\nCertainly very many rights, you will acknowledge, can be\nwaived by counsel.\nMR. NEWTON: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you can't simply say it\nrequires an express and knowing waiver, attributing that\nexpress and knowing waiver to the defendant.\nSure, it does, but who has to be \"express,\"\nand who has to be \"knowing\"? That's the issue before us\nhere.\nMR. NEWTON: Yes, Your Honor. I was\nresponding to -- there is really -- the Government makes\ntwo arguments based on Peretz: One, that mere silence\nequals to a waiver or consent, and that's what I was\nresponding to.\nThe second argument -- Peretz did not deal\nwith the issue of who is the one to consent, because in\nPeretz there was, practically speaking, personal\nconsent. The Court reframed the questions presented in\nPeretz to assume consent. There is --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, except for one thing,\nand that is, if -- if it is sound to say that Peretz\nequated \"waiver\" with \"failure to object,\" \"failure to\nobject\" is a -- is a failure, if you will, of counsel,\nnot of the defendant. Defendants don't get up and make\nobjections; counsel do. And, therefore, it seems to me\nthe implication of Peretz is that it would be a -- a\ndecision of the lawyer that would count for\nconstitutional purposes.\nMR. NEWTON: Your Honor, I would think in\ncertain cases, if it's a personal right and a defense\nlawyer stands up and says in the presence of his client,\nmy client consents, and the client doesn't object or\nrespond that, I disagree, then it's fair perhaps to\nassume there's a sufficient showing of -- of personal\nwaiver by the defendant.\nBut, again, what we have in this case is\njust vastly different. We have nothing in the record --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but the point was you\nwere saying that in fact Peretz cannot be read as\nauthority for the Government's position because the\nfacts in Peretz, quite as you correctly note, were that\nthe -- the client had in fact consented, or that was the\nrepresentation to the Court. And my point simply was\nthat does not seem to have been the reasoning of the\nCourt, because the reasoning of the Court in equating\n\"waiver\" with \"failure to object\" was a reasoning that\nin its reference to \"failure to object\" seemed to\npinpoint the actions of the lawyer alone. Clients don't\nobject; lawyers do. A failure to object, therefore,\nrefers to, in effect, a failure by the lawyer, alone;\nand that would be the only significant datum for\nconstitutional purposes. What is your response to that?\nMR. NEWTON: I disagree. I think that you\nhave to read Peretz in light of the very special facts\nin that case, which involve two statements in the\npresence of the defendant: That the defense was not\nobjecting or was consenting; and, then, in particular,\nthe defendant, himself, was giving consent.\nAnd I think you have to also look at the\nCourt's repeated focus on the fact that Peretz himself\ngave consent in that case.\nThere was no occasion to decide which --\nwhich party, the lawyer or the defendant, was the one to\nproperly waive in the Peretz case.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do you think there has to be\na showing on the record that the waiver is knowing?\nMR. NEWTON: Under 18 U.S.C. Section\n3401(b), which I contend is the obvious analog for\nwaiving in the felony context, yes, absolutely. I\nthink, at the very least, to avoid a constitutional\ndoubt, and that's -- also, I should say up front, all of\nthese arguments that we are -- or points we're engaging\nin here simply show this is a serious constitutional\nquestion.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So you think there has to be\na colloquy like a Rule 11 colloquy or a waiver of\ncounsel's, this is the different, this is what a\ndistrict judge is, this is what a magistrate judge is,\ndo you understand the difference between the two?\nMR. NEWTON: It's going to obviously depend\non the defendant because every case involving waiver\ndepends on the particular circumstances. But, at the\nvery least, there needs to be a showing of a knowing,\nvoluntary waiver of a right to an Article III judge.\nThis is done every day in America.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I know it's a different\ncontext, but -- it does not relate to the magistrate\nversus Article III judge, but do you think that a lawyer\ncould stipulate that the judge or a magistrate presiding\ncould do all the questioning and the lawyers would do\nnone, without the -- without the express consent of his\nclient?\nMR. NEWTON: In terms of the jury selection\nprocess?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me that the\nvoir dire is peculiarly the -- an area in which the\nlawyer knows what he is up to and what's at stake, and\nthe client does not.\nMR. NEWTON: Well, I would think the lawyer\ncould in that situation for the simple reason that you\nhave already at that point established, presumably, an\nArticle III judge is presiding or it has been validly\nwaived.\nBut picking the jury, the jury selection or,\nmore properly, the jury exclusion, because it's really\nexcluding jurors rather than picking them, that is a\nqualitatively different thing than deciding whether\nthere is a jury in the first place or whether an Article\nIII judge should preside over the jury selection. So I\nwould say the lawyer could do that, because that's more\nthe heat of the battle, the adversarial process working,\nas opposed to a discrete point in time before it.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think a\njurisdiction could adopt a rule that was especially\ncareful about selecting the jury panel and then decided\nthey would take the first 12 jurors off an arbitrary\nlist, just to pick them at random and have no voir dire\nduring the trial, just to have a preliminary screening\nof qualifications of the -- of the entire panel?\nMR. NEWTON: I think certain jurisdictions\nhave done that before. I think there's been bargaining\nby prosecutors and defense counsel. That again occurs\nduring the adversarial workings of the proceedings as\nopposed to the discrete point in time before.\nThe -- Justice Alito asked about how this\nprocedure would work. This has gone on every day in\nAmerican courtrooms since 1979. Every day around\nAmerica in courtrooms, Federal courtrooms, in magistrate\njudge cases over misdemeanors this kind of colloquy goes\non. This is done every day. It's done in the very same\ncourthouse that Mr. Gonzalez was tried in because they\nregularly refer felony guilty pleas to magistrate\njudges.\nAnd in the brief I've cited a couple of\ncases reported in Westlaw where District Judge Kazen has\naccepted reports and recommendations where the\nmagistrate judge said, I went over the right to Article\nIII judge with the defendant personally, he executed a\nwaiver, and this was done on the record.\nSo, this is not some innovative proceeding.\nThis has been done since 1979 when they amended Section\n3401(b). The legislative history to Section 3401(b)\nclearly shows that Congress believed the right to an\nArticle III judge was a constitutional right that had to\nbe personally waived by the defendant. That is further\nevidence this is a serious constitutional question. The\nCourt should avoid answering that serious constitutional\nquestion because you can easily interpret the Federal\nMagistrate's Act, in particular the \"Additional Duties\"\nClause, to allow for consensual delegation, which Gomez\ntalked about and Peretz talked about, only if it's\npersonal consent. So, this is not a leap of logic to\nthink that Congress would have intended this in a felony\ncase.\nGomez held Congress never intended this,\nthis was not something Congress intended, so the Court\nis going to have to fill in a gap in terms of what kind\nof consent is appropriate. And Congress has clearly\nsignaled they believe a defendant's personal express\nconsent is the type that is required. At the very least\nthere is a serious constitutional question.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Was there a right to\nvoir dire at common law? I have the impression the\njudge would send somebody out and, you know, grab the\nfirst 12 people they could find.\nMR. NEWTON: I don't know, Your Honor. I\ndon't know the answer to that question.\nIf I could --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Could I --\nMR. NEWTON: Sure.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Are we supposed to go\nthrough every one of the rights that a defendant has in\na trial one by one and decide, you know, this one the\nlawyer can make, this one the defendant must make\npersonally?\nMR. NEWTON: No, Your Honor. I think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: One by one? I mean, I\nnever thought that that was the approach we take.\nMR. NEWTON: I think the Court has already\ndecided the vast majority of these. Taylor clearly\nreferred to the confrontation or the Compulsory Process\nClause. There are numerous other cases in which the\nCourt has said, at least implicitly, that it's waived by\nthe lawyer's failure to object. But there are a special\nclass of rights: The right to a jury trial, the right\nto a grand jury, the right to counsel, the right to\nplead not guilty.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That gets back to your\nstructural argument, which makes a certain amount of\nsense just insofar as knowing where the line is.\nOn the other hand, I'm just not sure of the\npractical significance of the client's participation\nwhen it's really the attorney who is making the decision\nwhether or not this magistrate will allow him to strut\nhis stuff in front of the jury for a little longer than\nthe district judge would. I just don't see how the\nclient can really have much informed input into that at\nall.\nMR. NEWTON: Well, Your Honor, the Framers\nclearly believed it was an extremely important right for\ndefendants. Congress clearly believed this was a\nconstitutional right defendants had to personally waive.\nThe fact that the lawyer may be in a better position to\nmake the judgment would be equally true in waiving a\njury or a grand jury.\nAnd if I could reserve my additional time\nfor rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Newton.\nMs. Blatt?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. BLATT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThe decision whether to have a magistrate\njudge conduct voir dire is a strategic call that counsel\nis uniquely qualified to make. Counsel is best equipped\nto determine whether the magistrate judge's particular\nstyle, reputation or practice in addressing prospective\njurors or resolving objections outweigh the independence\nconferred by Article III.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course, it might\nbe said of the right to plead guilty as well. The\nlawyer has a lot more experience with what kind of\nsentence the judge is going to impose, what the odds are\nof the jury returning a verdict of innocence. I mean,\nthe fact that the lawyer is better situated to make the\njudgment doesn't mean it's not a fundamental right.\nMS. BLATT: That's correct. And for the few\nfundamental decisions where the defendant must\npersonally explicitly make, they have a monumental\nimpact on the defendant, and they protect values that\nextend beyond mere -- mere trial strategy.\nIf a defendant is indicted for a criminal\noffense, he readily understands he's going to have to\ndecide, do I want to plead guilty, do I want to stand\ntrial, do I want counsel, do I want a jury. He does not\nreadily appreciate that decisions that occurred during\nvoir dire, such as whether to have an Article III judge\nor a magistrate, whether to exercise peremptory\nchallenges, whether to challenge jurors for cause,\nwhether to object to the prosecutor's actions. These\nare all decisions that are entrusted to counsel's best\nprofessional judgment and his fiduciary obligation to\nrepresent the defendant.\nThe defendant -- I mean, the defense lawyer\nalso speaks for the client in exercising the defendant's\nconfrontation clause rights, introduce or object to\nevidence, to object to the closing of the courtroom.\nThere's just a small handful of fundamental rights. And\nfor the vast majority of criminal defendants, they don't\neven have Article III rights, Mr. Chief Justice; they're\nin State court.\nSo it's an important right. It implicates\nimportant trial issues. But nonetheless, counsel is\nbest equipped to make it. And I do think, unlike the\ndecision whether you're going to be convicted or stand\ntrial or even testify, this is a decision where the\ndefendant is overwhelmingly likely to defer to counsel's\ntactical and strategic judgment.\nIn this case, I just wanted to point out one\nother thing about the magistrate. As Justice Ginsburg\nsaid, she not only let the lawyers pose their own\nquestions to the jurors, she also gave the lawyers each\nan extra peremptory challenge. And that just shows that\nmagistrate judges can have particular styles or\npractice, and counsel would be uniquely situated to\nassess the value of that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Did she rule on strikes for\ncause?\nMS. BLATT: They were all by consensus, so\nyes, she ruled on them in that jurors were excused for\nvarious reasons. But there was -- it was pretty much by\nconsensus by defense counsel and the prosecutor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that -- I mean, that\nis, I suppose, the most significant power that the judge\nwho is conducting the voir dire or presiding at the voir\ndire has, to allow or not allow a strike --\nMS. BLATT: Right, and defense counsel's\ngoing to have to weigh in any given case whether the\nmagistrate judge is going to rule on any objections and\nde novo review is possible, but it's difficult as a\npractical matter, as the court noted in Peretz. The\ndefense counsel is best situated to decide, and I want\nto get the most favorable jury I can for my client,\nwhat's the best way to do that? Is this magistrate\njudge better off -- am I better off with which one?\nAnd defense counsel, if he has any concerns,\ncan object to the magistrate's role and then would be\nentitled under the Federal Magistrate Act to have an\nArticle III judge conduct voir dire.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose -- I know you\ndon't like to contemplate this, but that we accept the\nPetitioner's position that there has to be, that the\nclient has to waive. Would we be better off just\nadopting the rule that there has to be express waiver,\nor would you then recommend that we ask the further\nquestion whether or not there was an implied consent?\nMS. BLATT: An implied consent in --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, he was there, he\nprobably knew and the record shows that he knew what was\ngoing on.\nMS. BLATT: If an explicit personal --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I, frankly, don't think we\nshould go down that route.\nMS. BLATT: If a personal explicit waiver is\nrequired, there wasn't one here. The express waiver was\nby defense counsel, so it would not meet that test of\nhaving -- I don't know what the implied waiver would be.\nThere is an expressed waiver by defense counsel.\nIf counsel just said nothing and there was\nno objection, which is not what is at issue in this\ncase, then there would be a question on how do you read\nthis Court's decision in Peretz.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask how it works in\npractice? Does the magistrate's ruling on objections to\njurors, are those rulings subject to review by the\ndistrict judge or are they final?\nMS. BLATT: Under this Court's decision in\nPeretz, there would be de novo review at the end of the\nprocess. And here an Article III judge actually swore\nin the jury but there was, nothing was ever objected to\nby the magistrate's role. There was no --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But in practice, as I\nunderstand it, very often the judge will, will review\nthe magistrate's decisions on contested objections.\nMS. BLATT: He can. Right. Yes. And if\nthe Court said in Peretz that the Constitution would\nrequire that the review be de novo and they recognize in\na footnote this Court that as a practical matter it\nmight be difficult to reweigh credibility\ndeterminations, and you have the same kind of issues\nwhen a magistrate judge conducts Social Security cases\nor suppression hearings, the magistrate rules on or\nweighs credibility and there is a de novo review by the\nArticle III judge.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: How does that work? You\nhave some jurors, and you have juror's excused for\ncause, and there is an argument about that, then that\njuror has to sit down and wait for two days and then\nthey go back and they review that before the district\njudge. I just don't know mechanically how that can\nwork.\nMS. BLATT: I don't know if it can be done\nthat day. I mean, in this case, the jury selection was\njust a matter of a couple of hours.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Excuse me, if the Article\nIII judge says, oh, this should not have been excused\nfor cause, then you go back and bump the juror.\nMS. BLATT: I think this discussion just\nshows why a defendant -- this would not be a right that\nhe would readily appreciate and understand. This is\nsomething defense counsel would just decide. And is it\n-- in this particular trial, and this was a short drug\ntrial, this voir dire occurred without incident and it\nwas pretty routine. Is this something that if it were\ndifferent type of case defense counsel might think, no,\nI don't want whatever disruption it might be and we want\nan Article III judge. And defense counsel is of course\nable to object.\nI also wanted to point out --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you -- do you\nthink the right to a jury trial is something that has to\nbe personally waived by the defendant or can that be\nwaived through counsel?\nMS. BLATT: We read a discussion of it in\nFlorida v. Nixon and New York v. Hill including that\namong the rights that required a personal explicit\nwaiver. But if we're wrong about that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Were those -- was\nthe right to a jury trial at issue in those cases?\nMS. BLATT: No, it was just a descriptive:\nThere are decisions of such moment that the defendant\nmust personally make and this is usually included in the\nlist. But whatever -- whatever --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When I was\nresearching it, I saw that it was usually included in\nthe list, but I thought it would track back to some case\nthat held that it was, but it never -- never does.\nMS. BLATT: Well, whatever is in the list,\nit's a very small handful and it is something that the\ndefendant --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's our list, after all,\nright?\n(Laughter.)\nMS. BLATT: It's a very short list, and I\njust think it's something that a defendant can readily\nappreciate, even though it may be a strategic call,\nwhether or not he is going to plead guilty or even take\nthe stand. I mean, the right to testify is a decision\nthat personally belongs to the defendant, but you still\ndon't need an on-the-record, explicit personal consent\nby the defendant personally. If the defense lawyer\nsays, we have no witnesses, the client's assent is\nassumed and that's just the way our criminal justice\nsystem works. The lawyer does speak for the defendant\nin all but the very few exceptional cases.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Blatt, if you, if the\nGovernment prevails, what happens to the 11th Circuit's\nruling in the -- what was it, the Maragh --\nMS. BLATT: Maragh --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- case where the 11th th\nCircuit said, we're not going to mess with any\nconstitutional question, but under our supervisory\npower, we're going to tell the district -- the\nmagistrate judges, district judges in this circuit; it's\na simple thing to do, put on the record that the\ndefendant himself consented.\nThat would be -- that would no longer be\nvalid, right?\nMS. BLATT: I don't think so. I mean, I\nthink a -- there is nothing to stop them --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You think it would be valid\nor don't think it wouldn't be valid?\nMS. BLATT: I don't think so. I mean -- and\nthat's why the Court took the case to resolve that\ncircuit. And I read the decision as reading this\nCourt's decision in Peretz to require it. Or at least\nthere was some constitutional doubt about it but I don't\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: They specifically said,\nwe're doing this under our supervisory powers, not under\nthe Constitution. So my question was could a circuit\nstill say, we think it's better for the defendant\nhimself to be told, so in our circuit that's going to be\nthe rule?\nMS. BLATT: I mean, I don't think I have a\nfully developed answer on that, but my guess would be\nour position is no. But I don't -- I don't think\nthere's at least anything to stop the particular\nmagistrate judge in any given case from saying -- from\naddressing the defendant or requiring it. But --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, suppose the\nquestion would come up. I mean, if the circuit does\nthat the question would come up, if the magistrate\ndoesn't do it and it's not objected to, because of\ncourse if it's objected to you deal with it then.\nMS. BLATT: Right. Well, I --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And then we'd have\nto decide, or the Court would have to decide whether\nthat's a basis for reversal.\nMS. BLATT: Right. And on that issue our\nposition is clear: There is a rule that would dictate\nhow it would be resolved and Rule 52(b) of the Federal\nRule of Criminal Procedures has no exception, and plain\nerror would apply. And so if there was some sort of\nerror, the defendant would have to make the necessary\nshowings for plain error review, and on that I would\nlike to address, since we are on the subject, that if\nthe Court disagreed with us on the merits, Rule 52(b)\nwould apply and we think that all the concerns that\nanimate a contemporaneous objection rule are at their\npeak when the defense counsel expressly agrees to the\ncourse of action followed by the court, and Petitioner's\nrule of automatic reversal would open the door to\ngamesmanship and sandbagging because it would allow\ndefense counsel to wait and see if the defendant is\nconvicted before objecting to the magistrate's role.\nAnd before I get to -- I wanted to turn to,\nif you apply plain error, I just wanted to point one\nthing out about the Court's decision in Peretz. This\nwas not something that was just not at issue in the\ncase. The petitioner extensively argued that the waiver\nin that case was ineffective because it did not meet the\nrequirements of Section 3401(b); there was no personal\nexplicit waiver; the defendant did not understand what\nwas happening, he didn't speak English well, and so on;\nand the dissenting justices picked up on that and urged\nthe Court and dissented because there had -- one of the\nreasons there was not an explicit and personal waiver by\nthe defendant. And the Court nonetheless upheld the\nmagistrate's role in jury selection despite the absence\nof that waiver.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If Mr. Gonzalez had stood up\nat some point during the voir dire 0and said, Your\nHonor, I've just learned you're not an Article III\njudge, and I want an Article III judge to preside over\nthe voir dire, what would happen?\nMS. BLATT: Well, our position is the\nmagistrate judge could say sit down. This is if defense\nsays my counsel is putting in some evidence I don't like\nor my counsel is not cross examining the witness or my\ncounsel just asked a juror a question that I'm really\nuncomfortable with. I mean, this show belongs to the\nlawyer, and the magistrate judge could tell him to -- to\nbe quiet.\nThe defendant has not made a -- and his time\nis not up yet -- in effect an assistance of counsel\nclaim, but if he has an objection and he think his right\nrises to the level to testify, that he has some duty --\nthat the lawyer had some duty of personal consultation,\nthen he can make that Sixth Amendment argument. We\ndon't think it would have any merit because this is no\ndifferent than the myriad other types of trial rights\nthat belong to counsel.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you think the\nmagistrate judge would overstep -- assuming you win and\nthat is that rule is that the attorney can make the\nwaiver, would the magistrate judge overstep by saying I\nknow you've consented to this, but I want you to talk to\nyour client about it; I want you to explain what the\nrules are? Would that be overstepping?\nMS. BLATT: No. I think there is some room\nfor that. I mean I -- some room for that for the court,\nbut it's -- it's not like it's the right to testify. It\nwould be hard to, you know, if there was some argument\nover objection or how to question prospective jurors.\nThere's not a hybrid defense team where the -- the judge\nis always supposed to turn to the defendant and say are\nyou sure you're comfortable with what your counsel is\ndoing?\nIf the Court does conclude that there is\nerror, the Petitioner, we don't think has made the\nnecessary showing for plain error review. The first\nproblem and the most fundamental is the error is not\nplain, because this Court has already upheld the role of\nthe magistrate judge in jury selection in Peretz,\ndespite the absence of a personal waiver; and at least\nfour courts have read that decision to allow a\nmagistrate judge to conduct voir dire, either when there\nis an absence of an objection or there is express\nconsent by defense counsel.\nAnd even assuming this Court doesn't reach\nthe question of whether the error had an effect on\nsubstantial rights, the error did not seriously affect\nthe fairness, integrity or public confidence of criminal\nproceedings. The error -- the voir dire in this case\noccurred without incident or objection, as Justice\nGinsburg pointed out, to anything that the magistrate\njudge did; and there is no indication -- and I don't\nthink we have heard any -- there is no indication that\nthe defendant actually disagreed with his counsel's\nprofessional judgment to consent to have the magistrate\njudge, or even had an opinion on the subject. And\nPetitioner's rule would, as I said, open the door to\ngamesmanship because it would relieve counsel of any\nobligation to call an error to the court's attention and\ntherefore give the court the opportunity to correct the\nerror.\nIf there are no questions, we would ask that\nthe Fifth Circuit's decision be affirmed.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMs. Blatt.\nMr. Newton, you have four minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BRENT E. NEWTON,\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. NEWTON: Thank you, Your Honor.\nI'd like to return to Section 3401(b), which\nthe plain language of, and the legislative history\nbehind, clearly show a congressional intent in the --\ncontext for personal waivers on the record by\ndefendants. It would be anomalous not to require the\nsame thing, at least in some similar form, in the felony\ncontext.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Could I just -- a question\nthat has troubled me. Basically, what you say that is\nof such importance here is the composition of a jury. I\nmean, that's what it all boils down to, who's going to\nrule on the composition of the jury, should it be a\nmagistrate or should it be an Article III judge. But\nif -- you know, if that is -- is so fundamental that it\nneeds a special rule that the waiver has to be personal\nby the defendant, then you can say the same thing about\n-- about objections to -- to the Court's failure to\npermit a strike for cause. That affects the composition\nof the jury.\nNow do you need -- do you need the\ndefendant's consent to the judge's ruling on that point,\nor is it enough if the lawyer makes no objection?\nMR. NEWTON: It would be enough if the\nlawyer made no objection, Your Honor, because that is\nthe kind of rule that I described earlier that concerns\nthe heat of the battle of the adversary process, unlike\na discreet point in time before.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I see. I see.\nMR. NEWTON: The other point I'm trying to\nmake is that the -- it's not just the fact that it's a\ncritical stage; it's a critical stage where there is a\nright to an Article III judge over the critical stage.\nThe Court in Gomez clearly recognized that jury\nselection is a critical stage. So it is the Article III\nright that implicates the right to a jury trial, but it\nis fundamentally the right to an Article III judge that\nis at issue.\nThe Government makes much of its claim that\nthere could be meaningful Article III de novo review of\nmagistrate judge rulings. The court unanimously in\nGomez stated that the Court highly doubted it would be\npossible to have such review, and it realistically\nspeaking is not possible because delays between the time\nthat the district judge can get back to conduct a\nreview, and in Gomez the Court found -- pointed out that\nif you bring jurors back and question them again, you\nrun the risk of making them hostile -- they think they\ndid something wrong -- where you don't have that in an\nerratic situation where you're delegating an evidentiary\nhearing. Witnesses get recalled all the time. They\nknow that's part of the process.\nSo, realistically speaking, there is no de\nnovo review, which is why it's not an adjunct situation\nhere. It's not the magistrate judge acting as an\nadjunct; it's the magistrate judge acting as an Article\nIII judge.\nThe Government argues plain error doctrine\nshould apply, Rule 52(b). Justice Scalia's concurring\nopinion in Freytag noted that there are different kinds\nof rights that can be waived or forfeited, and most\nrights can be forfeited short of a waiver, but there are\ncertain kinds of rights -- and we contend this is one of\nthem -- that cannot be forfeited short of a valid\nwaiver.\nThe Court in Barker and in Boykin v. Alabama\nstated that there are certain personal rights where the\nprosecution has the entire responsibility to spread on\nthe record the valid waiver. And if the prosecution\ndoesn't meet that burden in the trial court, it's\nillogical to apply the burden on the defendant on appeal\nwhen it's the prosecution that would need to assure it\nwas the defendant's personal waiver that happened in the\ntrial court.\nThe Court in Wynn and Glitton and other\ncases moreover has said, if it's a fundamental question\nof judicial administration, then it can be raised for\nthe first time on appeal.\nI think the Court also should consider the\nfacts of this case in deciding whether there was\ngamesmanship. There wasn't. Clearly there wasn't.\nMr. Gonzalez was cut out of the equation entirely. The\nmagistrate judge only invited the attorneys to the\nbench, left him sitting there without the assistance of\nan interpreter. You have to consider his personal\ncharacteristics. He had no experience in the Federal\ncriminal justice system. He did not speak English\nfluently. He was in no position to object. He didn't\nhave the meaningful opportunity to object. And under\nRule 51(b), there should be de novo for that reason as\nwell.\nI finally I just -- I want to return to my\nmain point, which is -- I'm not asking the Court to\ndecide as a matter of constitutional law whether a\npersonal waiver is required. I think there's a very\nstrong argument based on the Court's precedent that\nshould happen and --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can finish your\nsentence.\nMR. NEWTON: I'm asking the Court to avoid\nthat question by interpreting the \"Additional Duties\"\nClause, whether it's a supervisory authority matter or\nas a statutory construction matter, to basically model\n3401(b). Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
