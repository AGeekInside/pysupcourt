MILLER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. MILLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe modern guilty plea colloquy, by focusing on\nand clearly articulating the consequences of pleading\nguilty, paralleling the Patterson case, clearly constitute\nthe -- the intelligent and knowing waiver of counsel in\nthis particular context.\ncontext, among other things, the defendant is told the\nelements of the crime, the range of the sentence, the\nfactual bases developed between the judge and the\ndefendant to assure that his guilt, and in addition,\nthe --\nQUESTION: Well, if someone is going to plead\nguilty, I guess the question may boil down to whether he\nhas a right to be told the he could be represented by an\nattorney in making the decision to plead and that it might\nbe useful to him to have an attorney's advice in making\nthat decision.\nMR. MILLER: Yes, Your Honor. You know, we --\nQUESTION: It's a guilty plea. It wasn't a\ngoing to trial and he was told certainly of all the things\nthat could be involved in a trial and how an attorney\nwould be helpful but was not told, I guess, expressly that\nif you plead guilty, you can be represented by counsel and\nthe attorney might give you useful advice.\nMR. MILLER: Separating the -- the two issues,\nfirst, the question of whether he was explicitly told in\nthis proceeding that he had a right to counsel at this\nproceeding. He was not told in that many words. But, you\nknow, there's -- there's a presumption of regularity here\nbased on the Johnson case.\nQUESTION: My goodness, he wasn't told. You're\nconceding that he wasn't told he had a right at the plea\nstage. I thought what they said to him right off the bat\nwas, Mr. Tovar, you're without counsel. I see you waived\napplication for a court-appointed attorney. You want to\nrepresent yourself at today's hearing. So what I thought\nthe State was saying is that that's sufficient.\nMR. MILLER: Yes.\nQUESTION: And I didn't even think that was an\nissue in this case. I didn't see it in the petition. I\ndidn't see it in the response to the petition. Maybe it\nwould be an issue for the lower court. So I'm not sure\nwhat to do with that. I can see it's ambiguous, but if\nyou want to concede it, that's fine with me.\nMR. MILLER: What -- what I'm saying, Your\nHonor, is -- is this, that in -- in the total context, he\nclearly knew that he had a right to counsel and, indeed,\nthat really is the -- the words that submit that --\nQUESTION: I mean, nobody is really -- at least,\nis that an issue in front of us?\nMR. MILLER: You know, I -- I don't -- I don't\nthink -- I don't think it should be, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: I thought it was very much the issue\nbefore the Iowa Supreme Court because that court said what\nwas missing here was information about the utility of a\nlawyer at the plea stage before you enter the plea with\nyou at that hearing. And here, all of the statements made\nrelate to what you're giving up by pleading guilty and not\ngoing to trial.\nNow, I thought, as Justice Breyer did, from that\nopening colloquy there was information to the defendant\nthat he could consult with a lawyer before entering the\nplea. And I wondered particularly about the form that he\nsigned. Tovar signed a form waiving counsel before the\nplea hearing, but that form is nowhere in the record or\nthe lodging. Does it exist?\nMR. MILLER: Your -- Your Honor, I -- I don't\nthink he actually signed a form. What -- what did happen\nis that he was informed at the -- informed at the arrest\nthrough the Miranda warnings that he had a right to\ncounsel. And then he went for a initial appearance, and\nthis is -- this is the part that -- that I think we focus\non.\nAt the initial appearance, the judge marked the\nform saying application for court-appointed counsel, and\nthen wrote waived. In other words, he had given the\nopportunity at this initial appearance for counsel. Going\nforward, there -- there was no reason to -- to interrupt\nthe initial appearance and having to have counsel at -- at\ninitial appearance. It was going forward.\nAnd then the words that Justice Breyer referred\nto, when he went to -- went to the plea hearing, the judge\nsaid, you know, I see that you've -- you've waived\ncounsel, and then he says I assume that you want to\nproceed to represent yourself.\nSo we think that -- that that really satisfies\nthe requirement --\nQUESTION: But do we have the transcript of the\n-- of that initial hearing where he waived counsel?\nMR. MILLER: The initial hearing -- the\nchecklist is in -- is in the documents that -- that were\ngiven -- given to this Court.\nQUESTION: Well, that wasn't the basis. I -- I\ndidn't understand that to be the basis of our decision\nhere. The -- the Supreme Court of Iowa did, indeed, focus\non whether he was advised at -- about how useful counsel\ncould be --\nMR. MILLER: Yes, Your Honor, that --\nQUESTION: -- in -- in connection with the\nguilty plea --\nMR. MILLER: Yes, Your Honor. That's --\nQUESTION: -- not that he wasn't advised that he\nhad a right to counsel. The problem here is he was told\nhe had a right to counsel, but it wasn't said, boy, you\nknow, you'd really be stupid to turn it down. That --\nthat wasn't done. Right?\nMR. MILLER: That -- that's exactly right.\nThat's what the Iowa Supreme Court held. You know, it\nwasn't -- it wasn't raised at the district court level.\nIt wasn't raised in the opposition to the cert petition.\nQUESTION: So what is your -- what everybody I\nthink is trying to do is ask you what is your argument on\nthe point that we thought was why we granted the case, or\nat least I thought why.\nMR. MILLER: Yes.\nQUESTION: What -- what is the reason that the\nIowa court is wrong --\nMR. MILLER: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- on -- on the point just as Justice\nScalia put it?\nMR. MILLER: Yes, Your Honor. I think -- I\nthink the -- the point is this, that in the plea setting\nit is very analogous to the Patterson setting and not\nanalogous to the Faretta setting at -- at going to trial\nwithout counsel. And -- and the reason for that is, Your\nHonor, that going through the plea and hearing the\nelements and going through the factual basis and knowing\nthe punishments, that's something a person can comprehend\nand can make a decision on, just like the Court held in\nPatterson that the decision to answer a question under\ninterrogation or not under interrogation is something\nsomeone could do.\nBut in -- in the trial setting, it is just so\ndifficult for a person to represent himself in terms of\nthe rule of evidence, in terms of strategy, witnesses,\nchoosing the jury. Those are the kinds of things that it\nis just so difficult. What we do is two things. We\ninform the defendant of all those difficulties and by\ninforming him as -- with a -- with an authority figure\nlike a judge, we're -- we're pushing him towards counsel.\nQUESTION: Well, but -- but in -- in the context\nof entering a plea, it certainly would be useful for the\ndefendant to know that if he had an attorney, the attorney\nmight take a look at -- at the sobriety tests. He might\ntalk with the prosecutor about a plea to the lesser\ncharge, reckless driving. He might talk to the judge\nabout a reduced sentence. It didn't happen here because\nhe got the minimum.\nBut just as -- as a general matter, your brief\nseems to suggest that there's -- there's not really much\nrole for the attorney at -- in entering a guilty plea. I\n-- I suggest that there -- there's a very important role\nfor him.\nMR. MILLER: Well, Your Honor, I think -- I\nthink there are a number of useful -- useful functions,\nthe ones you described, also collateral consequences.\nQUESTION: And collateral consequences, yes.\nMR. MILLER: But -- but generally in exercising\nthese rights and describing these rights, you give the\ngeneral -- the general right, not -- not the specific\nservices. The -- the Ruiz case indicates that. And in\nthe Patterson setting, the -- you know, the things that a\nlawyer could do about strategy on the questions or make\nsure that you weren't tripped up on the questions, that\nwas not required by Patterson. It's the -- it's the main\nconsequences. It's the direct consequences that Patterson\nrequires and that this requires.\nAnd, Your Honor, if we go into all the useful\nthings that an attorney can do -- and -- and certainly\nthere are many -- then it's -- it's almost an endless\nlist. It's a fairly long list. And then we're cluttering\nup the -- the colloquy. It's already a -- a rather long\ncolloquy.\nQUESTION: This -- this comes after, I take it,\nGeneral Miller, the discussion between the judge and the\ndefendant as to whether or not the elements of the offense\nare present?\nMR. MILLER: It would -- it would have -- I\nguess it would have to come after that. I mean, I think\n-- I think the factual basis is really the key here.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. MILLER: The -- because that's -- that's the\n-- that's our -- that's our real assurance that guilty --\nQUESTION: Well, and if -- if the defendant\nrepresents to the court that the factual basis for the\nplea is there, that he committed the offense charged, why\nis there any great interest in trying to persuade him not\nto do that?\nMR. MILLER: You know, I -- I don't think there\nis a great interest, Your Honor, and I don't -- I don't\nthink -- I don't think the -- the system is served here\nparticularly what -- what the Iowa Supreme Court required\nthat, you know, a -- and a lawyer can give you an\nindependent assessment of -- of whether it's wise to plead\nguilty. Obviously, that's something that -- that we know\nabout lawyers.\nAnd also really subsumed in that, to some\nextent, is the -- the question of defenses, but it's not a\n-- it's not a particularly helpful litany that they\ndeveloped.\nQUESTION: I --\nQUESTION: Well, the Iowa court made rather a\nlong laundry list of requirements. I suppose you wouldn't\nhave to go along with all of those things, but I am\ninterested to know whether you think there is a baseline\nrequirement that the court advise the defendant in making\na plea that he has a right to counsel and the attorney\ncould be helpful in making that decision.\nMR. MILLER: Well, I -- I think that -- that he\nhas to know that he has -- has the right -- right to\ncounsel. But --\nQUESTION: You don't think he has to know that\ncounsel would be helpful.\nMR. MILLER: The -- he knows that counsel is --\nwould be helpful.\nQUESTION: He doesn't have to be told that\ncounsel would be helpful.\nMR. MILLER: He doesn't have to be told. An\nindividual knows that -- that -- it certainly follows much\nlike in Patterson -- knows that the counsel would advise\nhim whether to ask -- answer the questions or not. But\nthat's something someone --\nQUESTION: But you do agree that he's -- you do\nagree that the advice should include explicit advice that\nhe has a right to counsel at the plea hearing.\nMR. MILLER: He should -- he should know at the\nplea hearing that he had a right to counsel.\nQUESTION: But he doesn't have to be told by the\njudge that he has a right to counsel at the -- he was not\n-- this -- in this case he was not told by the judge he\nhad a right to counsel at that hearing.\nMR. MILLER: The -- the judge said, you know, I\n-- I see you -- you made application, which would have\nbeen for this hearing, for -- you -- you did not make\napplication --\nQUESTION: Well, why -- why is it clear that it\nwould be for this hearing because the judge followed up,\nafter saying that, did you want to represent yourself at\ntoday's hearing, which would seem to me to imply that the\njudge did not know whether or not he had already decided\nnot to have counsel at that hearing?\nMR. MILLER: Well, I think that question was\nreally did you change your mind. I mean --\nQUESTION: Well, of course --\nMR. MILLER: -- you made -- you made a decision\nat the initial hearing going forward towards this hearing\nthat you wouldn't have counsel. Have you changed your\nmind?\nQUESTION: Maybe -- maybe you -- you should say\nthat he should be advised of his right to counsel, but if\nhe isn't, it is a harmless mistake if it is clear from the\nrecord that he knew it.\nMR. MILLER: That -- that certainly would --\nQUESTION: Even -- even if there is a -- a -- an\nabsolute right to have the judge tell you you're entitled\nto counsel, if it's clear on the record at least that you\nwere told, there's -- there's no foul.\nMR. MILLER: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: But it's not clear on this record,\nthough.\nQUESTION: But that you knew.\nMR. MILLER: Yes. You know, I -- I think it is.\nYou know, this -- every -- every presumption is -- is in\nour favor in this kind of collateral setting.\nQUESTION: Well, if you draw -- draw\npresumptions, maybe it is. You presume everything was\nregular. Why sure, then it is. But if you just look at\nwhat was said to him at the hearing itself, it's not clear\nthat he knew that he had -- he had waived application for\na court-appointed attorney. He didn't necessarily say he\nwanted to represent himself.\nMR. MILLER: Well, I -- I think, Your Honor, in\n-- in the context of the discussion at the initial\nappearance and then drawing that towards the -- forward\ninto the -- the plea -- plea hearing, that -- and -- and\ncertainly indulging the -- the presumptions here, that --\nthat that -- that he did know. And indeed, to this date\nhe's not asserted that he didn't know.\nQUESTION: Well, but the -- all I'm saying is\nthe record doesn't establish it, and we've been -- in some\nsituations been rather meticulous about what ought to be\non the record because then you solve all the problems of\ncollateral attack if the record does disclose it rather\nthan relying on presumptions and inferences. That's the\npoint.\nMR. MILLER: Yes. Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Where did this case come out of? A\njustice court? It was a misdemeanor, wasn't it, an OWI,\noperating without a --\nMR. MILLER: It -- it was, Your Honor. It would\nbe associate district court. It would be a situation\nwhere there -- there would be a -- would be a judge and --\nwho, you know, went through a -- you know, a long colloquy\nwith the -- with -- went through a colloquy concerning\nrepresentation.\nQUESTION: But that was basically the rule --\nwhat would be in the Federal system, a rule 11 colloquy,\nand it's all canned. I mean, the -- as the transcript\nshows, he -- he went through the -- almost precisely the\nsame litany on both times. So --\nMR. MILLER: Yes, Your Honor. It -- it\nparallels rule 11. It's -- our rule 8 is -- is very\nsimilar to -- to rule 11. And at the -- at the plea\nhearing, of course, he was asked three times whether he\nwanted to plea or whether he wanted to -- to go forward\nand -- and contest the case and that's -- in that setting.\nQUESTION: He does have a right to counsel at\nthe plea hearing. He does have a right if he asserts it\nto consult with counsel before the hearing takes place,\nbut I -- I think your argument is he doesn't even have to\nbe told that bare information, never mind the -- the\ncontinuing spiel about how much a lawyer would be worth to\nhim, but just the simple statement before you enter this\nplea, you're entitled to consult a lawyer. And if you\nwant a lawyer to be with you at the hearing, you're\nentitled to that too.\nMR. MILLER: What -- what we're saying, Your\nHonor, is that -- that that was covered by the -- the\nwords that Justice Breyer mentioned at -- at the outset,\nthat you know, I -- I see you waived application for\ncounsel at -- at the prior -- it would have been at the\nprior proceedings, which would have been for this\nproceeding, and do you -- you know, do you continue to\nwant to represent yourself.\nQUESTION: But I think there's something\nimportant afterwards. It's or did you want to take some\ntime to hire an attorney to represent you, which --\nQUESTION: That was at the sentencing.\nQUESTION: -- certainly one inference is that to\nrepresent you at this kind of proceeding.\nMR. MILLER: Yes, yes, Your Honor. The --\nthe --\nQUESTION: That -- that was not said at -- at\nhis plea hearing. That was said at his sentencing hearing\nwhen he pled to another crime that he had committed in the\ninterim.\nBut at -- the lines of what went on at the plea\nhearing is I see, Mr. Tovar, you waived application for a\ncourt-appointed attorney. Did you want to represent\nyourself at today's hearing? Period. That was it.\nMR. MILLER: That -- that was at -- at that\nproceeding, and -- and we argue that that -- those are the\n-- those are the key words that really -- really wrap up\nthis issue, that he was told before he had a right to\ncounsel at this hearing. There's a referral back. It was\nreaffirmed that he wanted to represent himself at -- at\nthe hearing.\nAs I say, that -- that -- you know, it was not\nraised by the -- by the defendant at the trial court level\nor in the -- or in the resistance to the cert petition.\nAnd to this day, they -- they've not asserted that he\ndidn't know that he had the right to counsel at the -- at\nthe plea -- at the plea hearing.\nQUESTION: The States seem to take various\npositions on this. Do you know if any of them have taken\nit as a matter of their own constitution rather than the\nFederal Constitution?\nMR. MILLER: The State has -- has not on this --\non this particular issue.\nQUESTION: Iowa hasn't, but have other States?\nMR. MILLER: Not -- not that I know of, Your\nHonor.\nQUESTION: This -- this being? This being the\nissue on which we granted cert or the issue of whether you\nhave to advise him of his right to counsel?\nMR. MILLER: I -- I was assuming on -- on the\nmatter that was before the Court as -- as a matter of the\ncert petition, that -- that I do not know of other\njurisdictions that decided solely on -- on State grounds.\nYour Honor, I'd like to reserve my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, General Miller.\nMr. Stewart, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. STEWART: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe plea colloquy conducted at respondent's 1996\nprosecution adequately informed respondent of the dangers\nand disadvantages of proceeding without counsel.\nRespondent's waiver of counsel and the guilty plea itself\nwere therefore knowing and intelligent. The judgment of\nthe Iowa Supreme Court should be reversed.\nI think it may be helpful to look first at the\nprecise language that the Iowa Supreme Court employed in\nannouncing the warnings that it thought were\nconstitutionally required, and if the Court looks at page\n18 of the appendix to the certiorari petition, that's the\nparagraph of the Iowa Supreme Court's opinion that's\nentitled Summary and Disposition. And it --\nQUESTION: Page 18 of what?\nMR. STEWART: Of the appendix to the certiorari\npetition.\nAnd if you -- if you look in -- in the middle of\nthe page, the Iowa Supreme Court in summarizing its\nholding said, rather, the trial judge need only advise the\ndefendant generally that there are defenses to criminal\ncharges that may not be known by lay persons and that the\ndanger in waiving of the assistance of counsel in deciding\nwhether to plead guilty is the risk that a viable defense\nwill be overlooked. The defendant should be admonished\nthat by waiving his right to an attorney, he will lose the\nopportunity to obtain an -- an opinion on whether under\nthe facts and applicable law it is wise to plead guilty.\nIn addition, the court must ensure the defendant\nunderstands the nature of the charges against him and the\nrange of allowable punishments.\nBut the third paragraph is -- is more -- the\nthird sentence is more or less irrelevant because there's\nno dispute here that the defendant was informed of the\nnature and -- of the charge and the applicable\npunishments, and that would be done in any standard plea\ncolloquy. So it's really just the previous two sentences\nthat are at issue, and I think there are some noteworthy\npoints about these.\nThe first is that the warnings mandated by the\nIowa Supreme Court don't contain any declarative sentence\nto the effect that you have a right to represented by\ncounsel at this plea proceeding. The Iowa Supreme Court I\nthink took it as given that respondent had been made\nadequately aware that he had a right to counsel and that\nwhat was missing was adequate information about the\nservices that counsel could perform in connection with the\nplea decision.\nThe second thing is that there's no reference in\nthese warnings to case-specific issues such as possible\nsuppression of evidence or the potential for plea\nbargaining. The -- the warnings are designed to be\nwarnings that could be given in every single case. And in\nour view, the warnings are either vacuous or misleading,\ndepending on how they're interpreted.\nIf they are accurately interpreted as\ngeneralizations about the criminal justice process, they\nreally say nothing more than that as a class lawyers know\nmore about the law than people who are not lawyers, and\nit's at least possible that consulting with a lawyer would\nimprove your chances in this criminal prosecution. And I\nthink any defendant who is aware that he has the right to\ncounsel would be aware of those facts, would be aware of\nat least the possibility that a lawyer could help him and\nthe certainty that a lawyer would know more about the\ncharges than he would.\nOn the other hand, if the defendant\nmisunderstands these warnings as directed to him\npersonally as availed suggestion that there is actually a\nmeritorious defense in his own case, then the defendant\nmay be given an artificial disincentive to plead guilty\nand in the case of a non-indigent defendant may be led to\nspend his own funds consulting with a lawyer when in fact\nno valid defense exists.\nQUESTION: Would a Miranda warning be sufficient\nto advise the -- the defendant that you have a right to\ncounsel? Period. It's pretty obvious to me that if you\nhave a right to counsel at interrogation, you certainly\nhave a right to one at the plea bargain. Would that be\nsufficient?\nMR. STEWART: I think it would be\nconstitutionally sufficient, but it's certainly better\npractice to make sure that the defendant understands that\nthe right extends beyond the questioning itself. And I\nthink that was done in the initial appearance. The\ndefendant -- there's -- there's a form. The defendant is\nrepresented as having waived his right to application for\nappointed counsel. I suppose that still leaves open the\npossibility that he could have retained counsel if he had\nchosen to. But I think that certainly apprised the\ndefendant of the right -- of -- of the fact that his right\nto counsel extended beyond the initial questioning itself\nand would continue for the duration of the proceedings.\nAnd we'd also point out that because this is a\ncollateral challenge, the defendant bears the burden of\nestablishing that no knowing and intelligent waiver\noccurred. And to the extent that there's a gap in the\nrecord on this point, I think the defendant is properly\nchargeable with that.\nI'd also like to return to the point that\nJustice Kennedy made earlier about the possibility that in\nsome cases an attorney might be able to obtain suppression\nof incriminating evidence or might be able to negotiate\nwith the prosecution about possible plea bargains. I\nthink first it's noteworthy that the standard rule 11\ncolloquy mentions several constitutional rights that an\nindividual gives up by pleading guilty, but it doesn't\nmention the possibility of suppressing evidence and it\ndoesn't mention the possibility of plea bargaining. So it\nwould be odd to think that you could have a\nconstitutionally valid waiver even though the defendant\nwas not informed of those substantive possibilities but\nwould, nevertheless, have to be informed of the assistance\nthat a lawyer might provide in connection with those --\nQUESTION: Mr. Stewart, do you know what the\ngeneral practice is in Federal courts? Are there\ninstructions given to prosecutors to make sure, for\nexample, that the defendant at a guilty plea is told that\nmaybe the -- that he has a right to a lawyer and he might\nbe helpful?\nMR. STEWART: Well, as to the -- it does --\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11 in its current form\nsays that if the defendant appears at the plea hearing\nwithout counsel, he is to be informed that he has a right\nto counsel at trial and at every other stage of the\nproceedings. So there's clearly a requirement that the\ndefendant be made aware that he has a right to counsel at\nthe plea hearing.\nNeither the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure\nnor the bench book for U.S. district judges requires that\nthe defendant be given additional information about the\nservices that an attorney might provide or the likelihood\nthat an attorney could be helpful by --\nQUESTION: Do you know the practice in -- in\nother States generally?\nMR. STEWART: My sense is that there is probably\na great deal of variation not only from State to State,\nbut among different courts within different States I\nthink, and I think that's probably the -- the likelihood\nin the Federal system as well.\nQUESTION: Well, I -- I suppose my comment was\nin response to the argument that, well, it really doesn't\nmake any difference, which is the -- the intimation I -- I\nsaw in -- in the brief. And I suppose it doesn't make any\ndifference because we assume that anybody knows this\nstuff?\nMR. STEWART: I don't think we would assume that\nany -- necessarily any layperson would be aware of the\npotential for suppressing evidence or the possibility of\nnegotiating a plea arrangement. I think any defendant\nknows more generally that lawyers have legal expertise\nthat lay people lack.\nBut I think if -- if we try to -- to think about\nhow warnings about suppression and plea bargaining might\nwork, I think we realize why the Iowa Supreme Court shied\naway from something like that because, on the one hand, if\nthis Court instructed, as a matter of constitutional law,\nthat whenever an uncounseled person pleads guilty, he has\nto be informed that in some cases it may be possible to\nsuppress incriminating evidence and in some cases it may\nbe possible to negotiate with the prosecution for a\nreduced charge, a lot of defendants are going to be given\nfalse hope because the possibility that those modes of\nprocedure might succeed would vary enormously.\nQUESTION: Why -- why wouldn't the same argument\napply to all of the rights that you're going to lose if\nyou plead guilty? Why -- why wouldn't rule 11 be really\nlargely unnecessary under your view?\nMR. STEWART: Well, I -- I think those rules\nreally do focus on things that will actually happen in any\ncriminal trial if the defendant decides not to plead\nguilty. That is, the defendant is informed if you plead\nguilty, you are waiving the right either to testify or not\ntestify on your own behalf. You're giving up the right to\ncounsel. You're giving up the right to cross-examine\nwitnesses. The defendant really is being told about\nthings that are likely to occur in virtually any criminal\ntrial, and I think that's -- that's the idea of a\nstandardized plea colloquy.\nOn -- on the other hand, if you're talking about\nsuppression of evidence or talking about plea bargaining,\nif you give that advice in every case, it's often going to\nbe misleading. A trial judge is going to find himself in\nthe position of saying you might be able to bargain with\nthe prosecution over a reduced charge even though he knows\nthat the policy of the prosecutor is not to engage in plea\nbargaining with respect to a category of cases that\nincludes that one.\nQUESTION: Mr. Stewart, as I understand your\nargument, you're -- you're arguing not only are these\nwarnings not constitutionally mandated, you're also saying\nthey're probably unwise in a number of situations. Are\nyou arguing that they're so unwise that we should tell, as\na matter of Federal law, a State judge could not give\nthese warnings?\nMR. STEWART: No, I don't think there would be\nany Federal law barrier to States requiring warnings such\nas these. And I -- I think the -- the vacuous warnings,\nthe warnings we regard as vacuous, that were mandated by\nthe Iowa Supreme Court are less likely to be harmful than\nmore specific warnings about --\nBut the other point I wanted to make is if the\nCourt decided that it wouldn't be a good idea to warn\nabout suppression of evidence or plea bargaining in every\ncase but maybe it would be advisable to do that in some\ncases, that would really be thrusting trial judges in an\nuntenable position because the point of having a\nstandardized plea colloquy is to give judges a -- a safe\nharbor, to give them some assurance that if they provide\nstandardized advice in every case, that's going to be\nenough. And if a trial judge had to decide is the\nlikelihood of a successful plea negotiation sufficiently\ngreat in this particular case that the defendant should be\nadvised about it or do I see a viable basis for asking for\nsuppression of evidence, it would really make the trial\njudge's life much more difficult. And if the Court were\nto hold, as a matter of constitutional law, that the trial\njudge is required to do that and can be reversed for\nfailure to, it would really cause disruption.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Stewart.\nMs. Wilson, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THERESA R. WILSON\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. WILSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nBefore a court may accept a guilty plea from an\nuncounseled defendant, the Constitution requires that the\ndefendant be advised of the following: of his right to\nhave counsel present prior to and during entry of the\nguilty plea, including appointed counsel if necessary;\nthat by waiving counsel, he will lose an independent\nopinion of his case and on the wisdom of pleading guilty;\nand that by waiving counsel, he risks overlooking\npotential defenses that he as a layperson may not\nrecognize. These are the minimal standards required for a\nwaiver of plea counsel.\nQUESTION: Where is it --\nQUESTION: That -- that isn't what the Supreme\nCourt of Iowa required in this case, is it? I mean, the\n-- their warning, as read by Mr. Stewart, was not nearly\nthat specific.\nMS. WILSON: Correct. The Iowa Supreme Court\napplied the rules of Patterson and Faretta, determining\nthat a uncounseled defendant who chooses to plead guilty\nmust be given a meaningful discussion regarding the\nusefulness of counsel at the plea proceeding and the\ndangers of proceeding pro se. The court determined that\nthe best way to fulfill that obligation is to advise the\ndefendant of the risks of overlooking potential defenses\nand of the loss of an independent opinion regarding his\ncase.\nQUESTION: My -- I guess the difficulty that I\nhave with that is no -- no question about the -- the\nsoundness of those general statements, but they are so\ngeneral that they -- they raise the question whether there\nare really very many defendants that don't know that to\nbegin with and whether there is a real utility in\nrequiring those warnings and hence paying the price in the\nmistaken cases when they're not given. Do -- do\ndefendants really need this?\nMS. WILSON: Yes. We simply cannot infer from\nthe fact that a defendant is told that he has counsel or\nhas a right to counsel that he necessarily understands the\nsort of assistance counsel could provide. The American\nBar Association has discussed this particular problem in\ntheir criminal justice standards, specifically part 5,\n8.1. The American Bar Association recognizes that to many\ndefendants the word counsel may not necessarily have any\nclear meaning.\nQUESTION: Did they say how they knew that?\nMS. WILSON: No, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Did they say -- did they -- I mean,\nI'm -- I am impressed by the fact that rule 11(b), which\nis a product of the rulemaking process and presumably, I'm\nsure, it reflects the experience of trial lawyers, which\nis not my experience, and -- and they try to get in things\nlike the ABA. Yet, they do not require that you tell the\nlawyer how useful -- you tell the -- the individual how\nuseful the lawyer will be. They do require that you tell\nthe defendant how -- that he has a right to a lawyer at\nevery stage of the proceeding. So I took from the fact\nthat the ABA and everybody else lobby nonstop for this\nkind of thing that they felt it was very desirable but not\nso important that you had to actually include it in the\ncolloquy. Otherwise, it would be there in rule 11(b).\nSo now, what -- what does the ABA say? Do they\nsay it's a constitutional requirement? Do they try to\nchange even the rule? No. I don't think they do.\nMS. WILSON: No.\nQUESTION: But you're -- you're saying that the\nConstitution requires the thing that the lawyers\nthemselves through their groups have felt is desirable but\nnot important enough to put in the rules. Wouldn't we go\nto the rules first?\nMS. WILSON: Not necessarily. Under -- under\nPatterson, under Faretta, even as -- back as far as\nJohnson v. Zerbst, this Court has required that any waiver\nof a constitutional right be a voluntary, knowing, and\nintelligent abandonment or relinquishment of a known right\nor privilege.\nQUESTION: But, Ms. Wilson, you know, as to how\nmuch that requires, when we invented the Miranda warning,\nwe -- we simply required that -- that the defendant be\ntold you have a right to counsel. We didn't -- we didn't\nsay that he be told, and by the way, the first thing\ncounsel will tell you is to shut up, which would be very\ngood advice.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: We didn't require that. We just said\nyou have a right to counsel. And -- and you want us to --\nto elaborate upon the Miranda warning as well?\nMS. WILSON: The -- those particular warnings\nwere used both in the Miranda case and in the Patterson\ncase, Sixth Amendment right to counsel at post-indictment\nquestioning. In both of those cases, a defendant still\nhas other alternatives even if he does make statements to\nthe police. He can attempt to recant his statement. He\nmay have other available defenses. If a defendant appears\nbefore a court to enter a guilty plea uncounseled, that\nadmission is going to be conclusive proof of guilt,\nleading to a final conviction that isn't revocable.\nQUESTION: Why -- even on this very record, when\nhe came for the sentencing, the judge did say, as Judge\nKennedy -- Justice Kennedy pointed out, that are you sure\nyou don't want more time to consider having counsel. And\none of the questions I was going to ask you is given that\nthe judge was so solicitous at the sentencing hearing,\ncould the defendant at that point have said, judge, I've\nthought about what I did at the plea hearing and I'd\nreally like to withdraw my plea?\nneed more time to consult a lawyer.\nMS. WILSON: He -- the defendant would have been\nable to file a motion in arrest of judgment. I do not\nrecall off the top of my head if that deadline had passed\nby the time of his sentencing. I believe it needs to be\nfiled within 5 days of sentencing. So he may not have\nbeen able to do that procedurally.\nQUESTION: But the judgment is entered only\nafter the sentence, I would assume. Is that correct in\nIowa?\nMS. WILSON: Correct.\nQUESTION: So it -- it just seemed to me that a\njudge, being so solicitous about this crime that didn't\ncarry any jail time, would -- would certainly say the one\nthat does carry jail -- jail time, yes, you think you want\nto talk to a lawyer? It's okay. We'll hold it in\nabeyance and you talk to your lawyer.\nMS. WILSON: Correct. The -- the discussion\nthat the court had with Mr. Tovar was very abbreviated at\nthe arraignment. At the time the court gave its\ndiscussion, I see you're appearing here today without\ncounsel, do you wish to proceed pro se, the district court\nhad no idea whether Mr. Tovar was going to enter a plea of\nguilty or not guilty. And unfortunately, a defendant in\nthat situation may come into a court believing that he\ndoes not have a right to counsel simply because he's going\nto plead guilty. Nothing that district court would have\ntold him up to that point would have dissuaded him from\nsuch a belief.\nQUESTION: Is -- is there any allegation in this\ncase that the defendant didn't know he had a right to\nappointed counsel for the plea? That allegation has not\nbeen made before, has it?\nMS. WILSON: No, and I do want to address that.\nQUESTION: Are you making it now?\nMS. WILSON: I am indicating that the record\nsimply doesn't show whether the defendant had any\nknowledge of the right to plea counsel, and\nunfortunately --\nQUESTION: No, but that's not an issue in this\ncase, is it?\nMS. WILSON: It is and -- and the -- the State\ndid say that this issue was not addressed in the Iowa\nSupreme Court. And it may be an error on my part I did\nnot raise it as a denial of counsel case. But in fact, in\nthe brief filed before the Iowa Supreme Court and the Iowa\nCourt of Appeals, I did raise the fact that Mr. Tovar was\nnot informed that he had a right to plea counsel, that the\nonly discussion of the right to counsel at that plea\nhearing was in the context of the right to counsel at\ntrial he was waiving.\nQUESTION: But in any case, you -- you didn't\ncross petition and you didn't raise this in the brief in\nopposition I take it.\nMS. WILSON: Correct.\nQUESTION: We're -- all of this -- it goes back\nto a prior conviction not his most recent one I take it,\nand all the facts we're talking about were at -- those\nassociated with the prior conviction, not this more recent\none.\nMS. WILSON: Correct.\nThe -- the reason that the issue of whether he\nwas informed of plea counsel is important is because that\nis the first requirement for a valid waiver of counsel.\nThe first requirement is an intentional relinquishment of\na known right. This means that a defendant must be made\naware that he has a constitutional right. According to\nMiranda v. Arizona, the only way to ensure that is to tell\nthe defendant that he has the right.\nQUESTION: All right. So if we agree with you\nabout that, the thing to do is send it back.\nMS. WILSON: Yes.\nQUESTION: Is that right?\nMS. WILSON: Yes.\nQUESTION:\nMS. WILSON: Correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: I mean, we can't decide it. I mean,\nwe could decide it but I guess it's not really fairly\nraised, is it?\nMS. WILSON: Correct. That -- that is an option\nfor the Court, Your Honor. Correct.\nQUESTION: Send it back.\nQUESTION: Do we usually do that, send -- say,\nyou know, search the record for other possible failures of\nthe lower court --\nMS. WILSON: No, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: -- that haven't been raised and then\nsend the thing back?\nMS. WILSON: No, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Why should we do it here?\nMS. WILSON: Again, it -- it was raised below.\nUnfortunately, the Iowa Supreme Court did not directly\naddress it. And it is part of the waiver analysis.\nQUESTION: Well, but you didn't cross -- as\nJustice Souter --\nMS. WILSON: No.\nQUESTION: -- you didn't cross-petition.\nMS. WILSON: No.\nQUESTION: You didn't put it in your brief in\nopposition.\nMS. WILSON: No.\nQUESTION: Well, I guess if we just -- what we'd\nnormally do here is we say -- suppose we didn't agree with\nyour -- on your basic argument. We say, well, you lose on\nthat one. Now we send it back from appropriate\nproceedings, whatever is appropriate. I don't know. At\nthat point, I guess you'd go back to the Iowa court and\nyou'd say you didn't address this other issue which I had\nin my brief.\nMS. WILSON: Correct.\nQUESTION: Is there a reason we can't do that?\nI don't know.\nMS. WILSON: No, Your Honor. There -- there's\nno -- I don't see any reason why this Court couldn't do\nthat.\nQUESTION: The -- the Court usually remands for\nproceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\nMS. WILSON: Correct.\nQUESTION: And -- and if the Court just\naddresses what's before them, whether the sentences that\nMr. Stewart read to us whether the -- if the Court decides\nit, that's not what the Constitution requires, then it\nvacates or reverses and remands and Iowa could take it\nfrom there.\nMS. WILSON:\npoint at which the Iowa Supreme Court did decide is -- is\nstill a valid point, that regarding whether there needs to\nbe a brief discussion regarding the usefulness of counsel\nand the dangers of proceeding pro se.\nQUESTION: So how do you deal with the question\nthat was posed that it raises a false hope, and if you\ntell a defendant a lawyer might know defenses that you\ndon't know, but wouldn't the defendant then ask the judge,\nJudge, would you please tell me what those defenses might\nbe?\nMS. WILSON: And then the appropriate response\nfrom the court would be, I can't advise you. I'm not your\nattorney. If you believe anything I've said here raises\nsome doubts, speak with an attorney. Otherwise, we could\nproceed with the guilty plea if you wish.\nQUESTION: But the attorney is going to cost me\n$200 an hour. Give me a break. Let me know whether it's\ngoing to be worth it or not. And the judge will say,\nsorry, I can't say anything about that.\nMS. WILSON: That's exactly correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: You ought to know that attorneys are\nuseful. That's -- that -- do you think that's a\nconsiderable help? You ought to know that attorneys are\nuseful?\nMS. WILSON: It at least indicates that the\ndefendant has been given some warning regarding how an\nattorney may assist him. And again, the -- the ABA says\nthat the fact that you just merely tell a defendant that\nhe has a right to counsel, it doesn't necessarily help.\nQUESTION: Was it in this case that the judge\ntold the defendant he was not entitled to free counsel\nbecause he was dependent on his parent where he was going\nto Ames or something like that?\nMS. WILSON: That was at the sentencing hearing.\nMr. Tovar did make an application for court-appointed\ncounsel that was denied because he was dependent upon his\nparents as a college student.\nThis case essentially falls into a -- a gap\nbetween Patterson and Faretta. Both of those cases\nrequire some discussion regarding the usefulness of\ncounsel and the dangers of proceeding pro se. The Iowa\nSupreme Court attempted to fill that gap by requiring\nthese particular admonishments. But these admonishments\nreflect the core responsibility of defense counsel at a\nplea proceeding and also are responsibilities this Court\nhas recognized in previous cases.\nQUESTION: Do you know any other jurisdiction\nthat has required such a -- a litany of warnings before a\nplea could be accepted?\nMS. WILSON: Specific litany? No. I do believe\nPennsylvania rules do provide a -- a six-point litany, I\nbelieve.\nBut I would direct the Court's attention to the\nbrief filed by the National Legal Aid and Defender -- yes\n-- National Legal Aid and Defender Association in this\ncase that outlines the various requirements in both the\ncircuits and the States. The majority -- about half of\nthe jurisdictions in this Nation have not discussed this\nparticular issue, waiver of counsel at a plea proceeding.\nOf those that have, the majority have either required or\npreferred a Faretta type colloquy for waiver of counsel at\na plea proceeding. All the Federal circuits that have\ndiscussed this issue have applied that standard. 18\nStates --\nQUESTION: You say applied that standard. You\nmean imposed it as a constitutional requirement?\nMS. WILSON: Have either required or preferred a\ndiscussion of the dangers of proceeding pro se at a plea\nproceeding.\nQUESTION: When you say preferred, what do you\nmean by that?\nMS. WILSON: It -- the failure to use those\nparticular standards may create a rebuttable presumption,\nbut the other factors in the case may show that a\ndefendant did validly understand or did understand the\nright to counsel.\nQUESTION: And did the -- you're talking about\nnow Federal courts of appeals?\nMS. WILSON: Federal circuits.\nQUESTION: And -- and they held this as a matter\nof Federal constitutional law?\nMS. WILSON: I -- I believe so. I believe the\nNinth Circuit did.\nQUESTION: Any other circuits?\nMS. WILSON: I can't remember off the top of my\nhead. Again, I would -- I would direct the Court's\nattention to that brief.\nOnly 10 States that have considered this issue\ndo not require a Faretta type colloquy. Some of those do\nuse the -- the plea colloquy.\nBut I guess it -- it's -- this issue, though it\nhasn't been directly addressed in the brief, but obviously\nit's a concern of the States whether this may have\nretroactive effect or whether it's prospective effect as\nfar as its effect on recidivist statutes. Mr. Tovar would\nargue that these standards, if adopted, could be applied\nprospectively because they do create a new rule. Although\nthey are certainly inspired by Patterson and by Faretta,\nthese particular admonishments are not required by those\ncases, and again, those cases do not address the\nparticular context of a plea proceeding.\nIt --\nQUESTION: In your brief, Ms. Wilson -- let me\nmake sure I've got the right one. Yes. In your table of\nauthorities, you have a number of cases from this Court\nand then you have a number of State cases which seem to be\nmostly Iowa cases.\nMS. WILSON: Correct.\nQUESTION: And then you don't cite any Federal\n-- Federal cases such as the ones I presume you were\nreferring to. Was there some reason, if -- if they\nsupport you, why you didn't put them in your brief?\nMS. WILSON: It was a cooperative effort between\nmy office and the National Legal Aid and Defender\nAssociation.\nQUESTION: And which one dropped the ball?\n(Laughter.)\nMS. WILSON: I -- I can't honestly answer that,\nYour Honor.\nBut even assuming other jurisdictions do not use\nthese particular standards, the burden upon the State will\nbe alleviated for a number of reasons.\nFirst, if for example, Iowa wanted to use a\nguilty plea from another jurisdiction for enhancement, a\ndefendant would have the burden of proof on a collateral\nattack. If these standards were not used, that may create\na presumption that the waiver was invalid. However, the\nState could certainly attempt to prove the validity of the\nwaiver through other means.\nIn addition, if the other jurisdiction does not\nuse these standards -- some of the claims are simply going\nto be time-barred. For example, in Iowa after direct\nappeal, there is a 3-year window of opportunity for a\ndefendant to apply for post-conviction relief. So Mr.\nTovar, who did not apply for a direct appeal of his guilty\nplea and did not for a post-conviction relief, would be\ntime-barred from challenging it now.\nThe --\nQUESTION: Now, what if under -- under Iowa law\nyou have a case like the present one? When this case --\nthe -- Tovar pleaded -- rather, he -- he pleaded not\nguilty. He went to trial, didn't he? And supposing that\nthe prior conviction is 4 years old, can he not challenge\nthat under Iowa law when he appeals as -- as an enhancing\nfactor?\nMS. WILSON: Do you -- can you rephrase the\nquestion. I'm not quite sure.\nQUESTION: Yes. What -- what I'm concerned\nwith, take the -- the present case. The defendant pleads\nnot guilty, goes to trial, the jury finds him guilty. And\none of the bases for sentencing is that 4 years ago he\npleaded guilty to a similar crime but didn't get these\nwaivers. Under Iowa law, could he challenge that 4-year-\nold conviction as an aggravating -- or whatever you want\nto call it on appeal from his present conviction?\nMS. WILSON: I -- I would assume so, Your Honor.\nThere's also a procedure in -- in Iowa law, Iowa Rule of\nCriminal Procedure 2.19(9) that would actually permit a\ndefendant to challenge the use of that prior conviction\nprior to the sentencing enhancement. Now, the State may\nhave an argument if he did not do that. Then the argument\nwould be waived.\nQUESTION: Is there any limit on how many years\nback you go for enhancing prior convictions?\nMS. WILSON: It depends on the particular\nstatute, Justice Ginsburg. In -- in Iowa for the OWI,\nit's 12 years. For domestic abuse, it's 6 years. For\nharassment, it is 10 years. There's habitual offender\nsentencing enhancement that does not contain any deadline\nfor use of prior convictions.\nQUESTION: What was the sentence imposed in this\ncase for the -- for the third offense?\nMS. WILSON: Third offense. It's -- the -- the\nparticular sentence in this case was 180 days, all but 30\nsuspended, and a $2,500 fine.\nstatute would be 5 years in prison.\nAlso, I do want to address a point that I\nbelieve Justice Kennedy raised earlier regarding how\ncounsel may have been useful here given that he -- given\nthat Mr. Tovar received the mandatory minimum for a\nconviction in his 1996 guilty plea.\nIt is true Mr. Tovar did receive the mandatory\nminimum for his conviction for OWI first. Unfortunately,\nunder the statute in effect at the time, Mr. Tovar also\nwould have been eligible for a deferred judgment. This is\nsomething apparently the prosecutor did not offer to Mr.\nTovar and it's something the district court did not advise\nhim regarding. It is something that had counsel been\npresent, it would have benefitted Mr. Tovar who would have\nbeen a prime candidate for a deferred judgment.\nAlso, I want to address the contention that a --\nthe factual basis discussion inherent in a guilty plea\nhelps to ensure that a defendant is pleading guilty to the\ncorrect crime. Unfortunately, that's not always the case\nand I can provide an analogy.\nDefendant is charged with forgery for writing\nchecks on another person's account. The district court\nholds a factual basis colloquy with the defendant, asks\nthe defendant did you make out these checks, and before\ndoing this, advises the defendant that it cannot accept\nhis guilty plea unless it has a factual basis to support\nthe conviction. The court asks the defendant, did you\nmake out these checks? Defendant says, yes.\nMinutes of testimony don't indicate whether he\nsigned his name or the other person's name. The defendant\nhimself does not say at the guilty plea whether he signs\nhis name or the other person's name. Under Iowa law, in\norder to be guilty of forgery, a person must do an act\npurporting to be the act of another. If defendant signs\nhis own name to that check, it's not forgery.\nQUESTION: Well, that would be the judge's fault\nthen in -- in not assuring that he was aware of all of the\nelements of the crime.\nMS. WILSON: Correct.\nQUESTION: I mean, all you're saying is the\njudge can make a mistake.\nMS. WILSON: Correct.\nQUESTION: But I mean, even if we grant what you\nwant in this case, judges will still be able to make\nmistakes.\nMS. WILSON: Correct, but unfortunately --\nQUESTION: If he doesn't make a mistake, he\nwould know all the elements of the crime. Right?\nMS. WILSON: Um-hum.\nAnd unfortunately, in -- in the situation of an\nuncounseled defendant, as in that case, the defendant\nwouldn't know that he's not legally guilty, that there was\nno factual --\nQUESTION: But in this case -- this case I don't\nthink you can raise any such --\nMS. WILSON: No.\nQUESTION: -- thing because it was a -- a blood\nalcohol test that did him in, and he didn't dispute the\nresults of that test.\nMS. WILSON: Correct. There may have -- in an\nOWI case, your mostly likely defenses are going to be\nsuppression, implied consent. Mr. Tovar didn't make any\nof those challenges in this case. He may have had them.\nQUESTION: Well, I'll ask you the same question\nI -- I asked of General Miller. If in fact the defendant\nhere, Mr. Tovar, says, yes, I was guilty of driving under\nthe influence and I know that the test said that and I\ndon't disagree with it, what public policy is there to try\nto get him to change his mind because you might have\nsuppressed some of that evidence?\nMS. WILSON: We're not attempting to make\ndefendants change their mind. What Mr. Tovar and the Iowa\nSupreme Court is hoping to do is to ensure that a\ndefendant knows exactly what they're getting into when\nthey plead guilty, that they know that they have the\navailability of counsel and the basic services counsel can\nprovide, and therefore they will be pleading guilty\nuncounseled with their eyes open.\nThe -- the plea colloquy suggested -- or the\nwaiver colloquy suggested by the Iowa Supreme Court is not\nunduly burdensome.\nQUESTION: Can I ask? Like the Chief, I'm --\nI'm not sure that as a matter of public policy I -- I even\n-- even like what -- what you're suggesting even if it\nwere made very, very simple. That is to say, we've gone\nthrough the elements of the crime and you acknowledge that\nyou've committed all of them. What you ought to know,\nhowever, is that if you got an attorney, he might find\nsome gimmick that would allow you not to be convicted of\nthis crime even though you have committed it. You should\nknow that because it's your right, you know, to know that\nyou can get off even where you're guilty. Now, is this\nsomething that we really want to encourage?\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: So long as you've told the individual\nthese are the elements, are you sure you did it, why --\nwhy isn't that all that the State should require? We want\nto encourage people to -- to confess. We want to\nencourage people, when they're guilty, to pay what used to\nbe called their just debt to society.\nencourage them to -- to hire a lawyer so that they'll get\noff on a -- on an irrelevancy?\nMS. WILSON: It is doubtful that these -- these\n-- well, I'll rephrase that.\nThe colloquy suggested by the Iowa Supreme Court\nis certainly not going to prevent anyone from pleading\nguilty. The State speaks of the defendant who wants to\nexpeditiously accept responsibility. That person is more\nthan likely going to plead guilty regardless of the length\nof the colloquy given by the court. However, what -- the\nonly person that may possibly be deterred by this sort of\na colloquy is the defendant who's already experiencing\ndoubts as to -- to his decision of whether to plead\nguilty.\nQUESTION: Do you think it would be valuable in\nCalifornia to have somebody there to say, by the way, this\nis the second time you've stolen a chicken and if you\nplead guilty and do it again, you may go to jail the rest\nof your life? Or if you're in, say, Alaska, this seems to\nbe an assault case but it's connected, in fact, with the\ncharge of sexual assault. So if you plead guilty, the\nrest of your life you're going to have to be registered as\na sex offender. Or to say, for example, if you're\nimmigrant, you know, it may not seem to be important to\nyou because it just happened to be hitting your child or\nsomething, you know, a slap or something like that, but\nyou're going to be deported likely if you plead guilty.\nWould it be useful to have a lawyer there to tell them\nthat?\nMS. WILSON: Absolutely, Your Honor, because the\ndistrict court isn't necessarily required to tell the\ndefendant such things and we're seeing in cases like\nLockyear v. Andrade, Ewing v. California where petty\noffenses, because they are tied in with recidivist\nstatutes, are creating life sentences. And it would make\nsense to have an attorney. If we're going to have this\nrobust system of recidivist statutes, then we should also\nhave a robust system of safeguards to ensure that a\ndefendant's due process rights are protected.\nThe -- the plea -- the waiver colloquy suggested\nby the Iowa Supreme Court is not going to inhibit the plea\nprocess. Again, it's adding a few lines to the colloquy\nthat's already required for the acceptance of guilty\npleas.\nFurthermore, such a standard would actually\nassist the State in the long run. These standards places\nthe waiver colloquy on the record for all to see. This\nassists not only the initial court in making the waiver\ndecision as an initial decision, but it also assists any\nfuture court that may have to make a determination of the\nvalidity of the waiver.\nQUESTION: Well, if the Iowa Supreme Court\nthinks so, it could put it in the Iowa rules.\nMS. WILSON: Yes.\nQUESTION: And that -- that's how it would be.\nMS. WILSON: Correct. They could do that.\nQUESTION: In this case, the Iowa Supreme Court\nis projecting what it would be law for the Nation.\nMS. WILSON: Correct. It was making an\ninterpretation of -- of Patterson and Faretta to the plea\ncontext. That's correct.\nBut for all these reasons, we would respectfully\nrequest that this Court affirm the decision of the Iowa\nSupreme Court.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Wilson.\nGeneral Miller, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS J. MILLER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. MILLER: I would just pick up on -- on\nJustice Ginsburg's question or comment there that in terms\nof usefulness of counsel, there's a -- you know, we've\nexplored a lot of difficulties and cross currents here\ntoday. What should happen is the States, as a matter of\n-- of the legislature or as a matter of the -- the court,\nmaking rules that -- that deal with these issues, rather\nthan having a constitutional mandate for the whole\ncountry.\nWith that, I would close except if there are\nother questions from the Court.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, General\nMiller.\n"
