SCOTT BALLENGER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BALLENGER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nSection 3 First (q) of the Railway Labor Act\nsays that the findings in an order of the division shall\nbe conclusive on the parties, except that the order of\nthe division may be set aside for one of three specified\nreasons. As a matter of plain dictionary meaning in\nthis context, \"except\" means that there are three and\nonly three exceptions to the otherwise conclusive nature\nof these awards.\nIn the Sheehan case, this Court explains\nthat the dispositive question is whether the parties'\nobjections falls within one of the three reasons\nspecified within the statute. This Court explained that\nthe statutory language means just what it says and that\na contrary conclusion would ignore the terms,\npurposes --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, the circuit\ncourt did things in an unusual order. Instead of\nreaching the statutory question, it reached the\nconstitutional question, in par, because it viewed the\ntwo as intertwined.\nWhy isn't its judgment that there's a\nstatutory violation what's at issue before us, because\nthat's what they said?\nMR. BALLENGER: Well, Your Honor, it\ncertainly would be this Court's prerogative and\nappropriate for this Court to choose to reach the\nstatutory ground first, but we think that the\nRespondents have no viable claim under the statute, and\nso then --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why not?\nMR. BALLENGER: Their only claim under the\nstatute is under the second statutory ground of review\nfor an award that fails to confine or conform itself to\nthe board's jurisdiction. An arbitrator's\njurisdiction --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No. It's an award that\nis contrary to the act.\nMR. BALLENGER: But, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's the --\nMR. BALLENGER: They -- they have never made\nthat argument, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, I saw it in their\nbrief to the Ninth Circuit. The Ninth Circuit analyzed\nthe requirements of the act and of circular one and said\nthe board's ruling is not based on those.\nMR. BALLENGER: Your Honor, on -- on page 5\nof their brief to the Seventh Circuit, they waived any\nargument based on that first statutory ground of review.\nThere was a first count in their petition for review\nthat was based on that statutory ground, and on page 5\nthey renounced it.\nThe only --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's the same argument --\nit's the same argument, as if you had an APA case, and\nthe words in the APA are \"arbitrary, capricious, abuse\nof discretion,\" so somebody who has an unfair procedure\nsays it violates those words.\nMR. BALLENGER: Well, if --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And I don't really see that\nit's any different, except we normally go to those words\nbefore we would decide a due process question. It's the\nsimilar kind of question. Why wouldn't we do the same\nthing here?\nMR. BALLENGER: Your Honor, I think that\nthere is an important difference. The first ground of\nreview under the act provides review for violations of\nthe plain terms of the RLA itself. The second ground is\nfor an act in excess of jurisdiction, which the lower\ncourts have correctly understood to be a reference to\nthis Court's Steelworker trilogy standard of review for\nlabor arbitration generally. An arbitrator's\njurisdiction is to interpret and to apply the parties'\nagreement and the relevant arbitral rules. An\narbitrator exceeds his jurisdiction if but only if,\nunder this Court's well-settled case law, his decision\nisn't even arguably construing or applying the relevant\nprinciples, and this decision clearly satisfies that\nstandard, Your Honor.\nI would urge the Court to look at the\nboard's decision in this case, and one of the five\nappears at pages 65 -- 65a to 72a of the petition\nappendix. The relevant reasoning starts on 68a to 71a.\nThe award contain five pages of careful reasoning by the\nboard. The board says that, quote: \"We carefully\nstudied the arbitral and judicial precedents cited by\nboth parties in support of their respective positions\";\nand that \"An evidentiary process after the appeal to\nthis board would have been contrary to the procedural\nrequirements contained in circular 1, as well as the\nweight of arbitral precedents supporting the carrier's\nposition.\"\nWell, what are those requirements? Section\n301.2(b) of circular 1 expressly says that, quote: \"No\npetition shall be considered by any division of the\nboard unless the subject matter has been handled in\naccordance with the provisions of the Railway Labor\nAct,\" which includes the statutory requirement that a\nconference must have occurred. The board has reasonably\nunderstood that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask, just to be --\ndo you -- do you contest the question of whether there\nwas conferencing?\nMR. BALLENGER: It's a complex question,\nYour Honor. In the arbitration, Union Pacific went --\nwhen this issue came up, Union Pacific went back to its\nrecords and determined that it had proof in its own\nrecords that two of the five cases had been conferenced.\nAnd so we essentially conceded that point in the\narbitration.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You conceded that there\nwas conferencing?\nMR. BALLENGER: We didn't contest that point\nin the arbitration. Of course, the arbitrators\ncorrectly determined that it was irrelevant.\nAs to the other three, the -- Union Pacific\ndid not have in its files the paperwork that it would\nexpect to see there if conferences occurred. So --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'm not sure that answers\nmy question.\nMR. BALLENGER: Well, we took the position\nin the arbitration that we don't know for sure whether\nconferencing occurred and that it's Respondent's burden\nto prove it, and that the proof that they proffered in\nthe arbitration was not convincing and sufficient to\nsatisfy their burden. We think that constitutes\ncontesting the issue in an ordinary legal sense.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you didn't contest it\nin two. Two cases, you concede that there was in fact a\nconference.\nMR. BALLENGER: In two cases, that appears\nto be correct, Justice Ginsburg. But, of course, the\nboard properly determined within its discretion that\nthat fact is not relevant because the board enforced its\nprocedural rule that the evidence of conferencing --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but the board can\nmake rules of procedure. It can't make rules of\njurisdiction. The dismissal of all these petitions was\nfor want of jurisdiction.\nNow, if the board has no authority to set\nits jurisdiction -- and I think that's plain; Congress\nhas that authority, not the board -- then it is required\nto exercise the jurisdiction that Congress gave it. So\nwhy isn't that the very first question that this Court\nshould deal with?\nThe board threw these cases out for want of\njurisdiction. Whatever the failing was, it was not and\ncould not be jurisdictional because the board has no\nauthority to describe its own jurisdiction.\nMR. BALLENGER: But Your Honor, the\nboard was -- I think the board is entitled to mean\ndifferent things by the word \"jurisdiction\" than perhaps\nan Article 3 court would mean. This Court often means\nmany different things when it uses that word.\nWhat the board held was that the -- under\nthe language of circular 1 and the weight of arbitral\nprecedent the board cannot consider information that is\nnot included in the parties' initial submissions. The\nboard has understood for a very long time, consistent\nwith the language of circular 1, like Section 301.2(a),\nthat it is an appellate body that makes decisions on the\nbasis of a record that is before it, that was organized\non property and presented by the parties in their\ninitial submissions.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So you say this is just a\nmistaken use of words, rather than -- than the board\nsaying, under our rules, we don't have power to handle\nthis?\nMR. BALLENGER: The substance -- I think it\ncan -- you can get tied up in the word \"jurisdiction\" in\na way that makes it more confusing than it needs to be.\nWhat the board held was that the confluence\nof the procedural rules, specific procedural rules, in\ncircular 1 established two propositions: First, that\nthe board cannot consider a matter unless conferencing\nin fact occurred; and second, that the only evidence\nthat the board is ever allowed to look at under its own\nprocedural rules is the evidence that is in the initial\nsubmissions. If you put --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you -- do you dispute\nwhat your opponent tells us, that some panels of the\nboard, even when there has been no conference, let alone\nno proof of a conference, but some panels have stayed\nproceedings to allow the conference to occur, and then\nthe board will pick up?\nMR. BALLENGER: That -- we don't contest\nthat, Justice Ginsburg. But, of course, this isn't\nordinary agency adjudication of the sort conducted under\nthe APA, where the board has to stand behind as an\nentity every decision that is made by any panel.\nThis is a peculiar sort of agency-supervised\narbitration, and it's perfectly appropriate in this\ncontext for two simultaneous panels of the board to\nreach different interpretations of the same language.\nAnd a Court really --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's true generally,\nbut if the board believes that as a matter of law it\ncan't hear this dispute and consider normal grounds for\nexcusing a failure to include something in the record\nbecause, in its own language, we can't do it, the law\ndoesn't permit us to do it, we have no jurisdiction to\nconsider matters outside the record, we don't apply\nnormal rules of waiver or forfeiture or any of the other\nrules that attend themselves to a failure of a party to\nimmediately raise a defense like you could have done and\nwaited two and a half years to do, doesn't that suggest\nthat the board is not reaching -- merely resting its\ndecision on a merely procedural rule, it's resting its\ndecision on its erroneous view that the law deprives it\nof jurisdiction to hear the case?\nMR. BALLENGER: I don't believe so, Your\nHonor. First of all, this Court squarely rejected in\nthe Sheehan case itself the suggestion that there is\nindependent judicial review just because a question of\nlaw is at stake. That was the --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, but that -- this is\nnot merely a question of law. This is a question of\njurisdiction: Is it entitled to hear a dispute by law?\nMR. BALLENGER: There is no question, no one\nhas ever disputed in this case, that the board was\nentitled to hear this matter.\nFor instance, the question of arbitral\njurisdiction, no one has ever disputed that this Court\n-- that this dispute was properly before the board. The\nboard resolved it. The board simply resolved it on\nprocedural grounds. And the explanation that it gave\nwas that considering material outside of the initial\nsubmissions would be contrary to circular 1 and to the\nweight of arbitral precedent directly on the point.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I am looking at the\ndecision and they are all identical in this respect.\nThe board said it has no jurisdiction to consider any of\nthe remaining procedural or substantive issues\nassociated with this claim.\n\"No jurisdiction,\" that sounds like they are\nsaying: We have no authority to consider anything about\nthis case; we must toss it out because there is no proof\nof the conference.\nMR. BALLENGER: Again, Your Honor, I think\nthe important point is that the board is not required to\nuse the word \"jurisdiction\" in precisely this sense.\nThere is no question that the board has jurisdiction\nover this dispute. It is a minor grievance under the\nRailway Labor Act within the --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Don't you think there is\na big difference between the adjudicator saying: I\ncould, but I choose not to because there is no reason\nfor your failure, from: I won't because I can't.\nMR. BALLENGER: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Those are -- those are\ntwo very different concepts.\nMR. BALLENGER: They're -- they certainly\nare in an Article 3 court, Your Honor. But this Court\nhas said many, many times that the word \"jurisdiction\"\nis a word of many meanings, too many meanings.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can you -- could you go\nback for a minute? I mean, this reads as if it's very\ncomplicated, but for me, I read the AFL-CIO brief and\nthat's what I am thinking of and it seems this is not\nsuch a hard case. Basically, there is a statute filled\nwith words of procedure, and it isn't too difficult to\ninterpret that statute as meaning that the board should\nhave fair procedure, not unfair procedure.\nNow, if you are willing to make that giant\nstep, the remaining issue in the case is whether the\nprocedure here was fair or unfair. And the Seventh\nCircuit is filled with pages of opinion that explains\nwhy it was unfair. And the reason basically it was\nunfair is because no one in his right mind previous to\nthis case would have thought that you should fill up\nyour brief with a lot of facts that nobody's going to\ncontest. And after this case, the board said: By the\nway, you have to put in a whole lot of jurisdictional\nfacts even if nobody is going to contest them, and since\nyou didn't do it, you are out, and we won't even give\nyou a chance to do it now.\nOkay? So I read that. I thought, is there\nsomething wrong with that? And then I thought I'd ask\nyou, because you would know.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BALLENGER: I think that there are\nseveral things wrong with it, Your Honor, starting from\nthe premise that the statute guarantees in all instances\nprocedures that are, quote unquote, \"fair\" in an\nuntethered sense.\nThis statute guarantees specific procedural\nrights, which if you put them together do guarantee fair\nprocedures. But it doesn't guarantee fairness in the\nabstract. So what you have to look at are whether the\nspecific procedures that are guaranteed by the statute\nwere complied with, and they were.\nNow, taking a step back, even if we are\ngoing to talk about what is fair and unfair, there is\nabsolutely nothing unfair about what happened here. As\nthe board explained, referencing its own prior\nprecedents and the plain language of the regulations\nthat are governing, the Respondents clearly were on\nnotice that they had to do this.\nSeveral prior decisions of the board had\ndismissed grievances for precisely the reason that there\nwas no evidence of conferencing in the on-property\nrecord. That is if you look at page 40 of the joint\nappendix 18679 from the first --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Are there any -- is there\nany rule describing how one has to get this into the\nrecord? It's just-- how -- what would have been the\nproper way to prove that conferencing occurred?\nMR. BALLENGER: As the board has explained\nin prior cases, the ordinary method of proving that\nconferencing occurred is that the last exchange of\ncorrespondence on the property between the carrier and\nthe union, references the conference that had occurred\nand what happened. And then both parties or -- or\nthe -- the union use that exchange of correspondence\nto -- in their initial submissions to the board pursuant\nto section 301.2(a), which requires, consistent with the\ntext of the statute itself, that every submission of the\nboard will include, quote, \"A full statement of the\nfacts and all supporting data bearing on the dispute.\"\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But that doesn't refer to\nconferencing, does it?\nMR. BALLENGER: A full statement of -- of\nall of the facts and supporting data, which includes\nconferencing. Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Implicitly includes con --\nnot expressly includes conferencing.\nMR. BALLENGER: Well, that's how the board\nhas understood it, and, of course, the board is entitled\nas an arbitral body to interpret its own rules.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I see.\nMR. BALLENGER: Within the enormous\ndiscretion that this Court has established in the\nSteelworkers trilogy standard of review, which is that\nas long as the arbitrator is even arguably construing or\napplying the appropriate principles, his decision has to\nstand. There is no real question, I think, if you look\nat the five pages of careful reasoning and the expressed\ntext of Circular 1 here that this -- this is an\nexemplary arbitral award. The arbitrators were careful,\nthey were construing and applying the relevant\nprinciples. And this Court has said --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And it's going against\nanother panel that says, not only you don't have to have\nthe proof, even if you didn't have the conference we are\nnot going to throw you out.\nNow, there is different panels, but it is\nthe same board. Why shouldn't the grievants here say,\nwe don't understand this? It's conceded there was a\nconference, at least in two of the cases. Our buddies\ndidn't even have a conference and this same board, a\ndifferent panel, allowed them to cure it. And I can't\ncure it now. That is the height of arbitrary behavior\nby the board, it seems to me.\nMR. BALLENGER: Your Honor, exactly the same\nthing happens to litigants in courts all of the time.\nThree identically situated litigants go to three\ndifferent trial courts in the same State with identical\nclaims under the same statute and they present those\nclaims and they get three different answers from the\nState trial courts. That is not a violation of due\nprocess. Sometimes --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm not -- I'm not\ntalking about due process. I'm talking about conformity\nwith the act, the act's requirement. I --\nMR. BALLENGER: Your Honor, it is a feature\nof the Railway Labor Act scheme that different -- each\npanel of the board is its own discreet interpretive\nuniverse and is to be judged by the Federal courts\naccording to the standards set up in the statute. It\nwill happen that boards -- that panels disagree about\nthe proper resolution of an issue. That's happened --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So does the board as a\nwhole apparently, because I am looking at the\ninstruction about joint exhibits and it tells the\nparties, when you are going to make a submission don't\ninclude unnecessary documents, and among things don't\ninclude things that aren't in dispute --\nMR. BALLENGER: Three things about --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- like letters\nrequesting conferences.\nMR. BALLENGER: Three things about that,\nYour Honor. First of all, that instruction sheet\ndoesn't apply here at all. It applies only when the\nparties get together beforehand and agree to file a\njoint -- a joint submission to the board, so that they\nreally have talked about what is in dispute and what\nisn't. It wasn't even promulgated until after the\nsubmissions in this case were made.\nAnd it's not clear how the board is going to\nunderstand that language. It doesn't say that the\nparties can omit evidence of conferencing. It says they\ncan omit, if they don't dispute it, letters requesting a\nconference.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It must be what they think\nof as an interpretation of the rule and the statute that\nthey already had promulgated. The rule and the statutes\nsay, the rule says you have to include all known\nrelevant argumentative facts. So if the circular says\nwe mean it, we mean the facts that people are having an\nargument about.\nAnd then the statute says, a full statement\nof the facts bearing upon the dispute. And the circular\nand then this document say we mean a full statement of\nfacts that somebody might think have something to do\nwith an argument that people are having.\nAnd, so, only after this case did the board\nsay, oh, no, you have to include some disputes that\nnobody is disputing, some facts that nobody has ever\ndisputed or seems to.\nNow, what's -- what's the response to that?\nMR. BALLENGER: Again, Your Honor, there is\nnothing unique or new about what the board did here.\nThe board has done this before.\nNow, as to the circular, it remains --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm right in `stating what\nthey did? Is my statement of what they did, which was\nmeant to be as pejorative as I could possibly make it --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- and you are going to\nsay, that's right, that's the correct statement of what\nhappened?\nMR. BALLENGER: No, I'm -- I'm disagreeing\nwith the -- the characterization that this is the board\nsaying, we're going to make up a new rule that we've\nnever applied before. That's not what happened here.\nThe board said that the weight of arbitral precedence\nsupports the carrier's position.\nNow, as to the -- the instruction sheet, it\nremains to be seen how the board is going to interpret\nthat. And in an appropriate case, a court, if they\ninterpret it in a manner that was wholly arbitrary and\nwithout reason and would violate the Steelworkers\ntrilogy arbitral standard of review, then of --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then the board is telling\npeople, I will go back a sentence: \"Representatives may\nwish to omit documents that are unimportant and/or\nirrelevant to the disposition of the dispute.\"\nI mean that -- that seems to me is trapping\npeople, if the board says, please don't dump on us\nunnecessary paper.\nMR. BALLENGER: Your Honor, no one in this\ncase could have legitimately relied on that instruction\nsheet, whatever it means. And the -- the board has not\nyet construed what it's going to mean. But it doesn't\nby its own terms apply here, because a joint submission\nwas not made.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then if -- then a person\nfollowing this is obliged not to pay heed to this advice\nbecause if you don't put in every document, if you don't\nput in enough evidence of conferencing, you are going to\nbe out and never have your grievance heard.\nMR. BALLENGER: Your Honor, in an\nappropriate case, if a board panel interpreted that\nlanguage in -- in a manner that would be inconsistent\nwith something that that panel then did, then there\nmight be an inherent conflict that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do I understand you to say\nthat that provision was not applicable here anyway?\nMR. BALLENGER: It's not applicable at all,\nYour Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Does the other side contest\nthat?\nMR. BALLENGER: Not that I am aware of.\nIt -- it only applies in the case of joint submissions,\nand it was not promulgated until after the submissions\nhere were filed. So no one could legitimately rely on\nthat instruction sheet.\nAnd in any event --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: They are not relying on\nit as applicable in this case. They are relying on it\nas the board's indication that it's sound to tell the\nparties, don't dump on us unnecessary paper.\nMR. BALLENGER: Well, the board obviously\ndoes not consider evidence of conferencing unnecessary,\nYour Honor. It has held for a very long time, going\nback, I think, 40 years to Award 18679 at least, that\nevidence of conferencing is essential to the board's\nconsideration of any dispute under the terms of the\nstatute.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Some panels of the board.\nOther panels think this is an eminently curable defect.\nMR. BALLENGER: That's right, Your Honor.\nBut an arbitral decision does not violate the\nSteelworkers standard of review simply because other\narbitrators disagree.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's a decision on the\nmerits. Here we are talking about a threshold barrier\nto even get your case heard. And that is being decided\ndifferently by different panels.\nMR. BALLENGER: Your Honor, this Court has\nmade clear that issues of procedural arbitrability,\nthreshold conditions to arbitration, are governed by the\nsame standard as merits issues in arbitration. In the\nMisco case, for instance, there was a question of\nevidence, and the arbitrator refused to consider certain\nkinds of evidence. And this Court said questions of\nprocedure are for the arbitrator.\nIn John Wiley v. Livingston, which is in\nmany ways very similar to this case, it involved a\nprocedural precondition to arbitration that the parties\nhave to meet in conference prior to beginning the\narbitration. And the question in John Wiley & Sons, was\nwhether that precondition of conferencing should be\nwaived on the grounds that on the facts of that case it\nwould be futile. And the party -- one party tried to\nget a court to intervene on that question, because it\ncould have precluded the arbitration entirely. And the\nCourt said that procedural questions arising out of the\narbitration and bearing on its disposition are for the\narbitrator, not for a court.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question.\nI may have an incorrect impression about it. Is the --\nthe thing that's at issue is whether or not conferencing\noccurred. Is it also important to know what happened at\nthe conferencing? You may not know this. Is the -- is\nthere some sort of -- of factual description of the\nnegotiations that took place during conferencing an\nimportant part of the submission?\nMR. BALLENGER: Not ordinarily, Justice\nStevens.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So the only -- the only\nimportance is to just to establish the fact that there\nwas a conference?\nMR. BALLENGER: It was very important to the\ncongressional plan and so it's written into the statute\nthat the parties make one last effort to settle these\ngrievances before it comes to the board. That is a\nprecondition of the board's consideration of any\ngrievance.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And in two cases you\nconcede that that condition was met, that there was a\nconference?\nMR. BALLENGER: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So we are not even\ntalking about a conference requirement. We are talking\nabout a pleading rule, how you plead. Everybody\nconcedes that the conference occurred in two cases.\nMR. BALLENGER: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It's how you plead that.\nMR. BALLENGER: Yes, Your Honor. Every\nadjudicative body has to be able to enforce its\nprocedural rules. And the board has a procedural --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can -- can we -- I'm\nsorry.\nLet's assume that in a published opinion\nthere are two procedural defaults. One, the union does;\nthe other, the railroad does. The board says, you know,\nI am resolving this dispute. I'm not forgiving the\nunion's procedural default, but I will forgive the\nrailroad's procedural default, because they're an\nimportant lifeline business for America and we've got to\nmake sure that they're protected at all costs, and union\nmembers are just not important enough to that scheme.\nMR. BALLENGER: Your Honor, in that --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In your theory, there is\nno due process violation in that case? They have heard\nthe arguments, they have given you a full opportunity to\nmake your point about the procedural default. They are\nannouncing a new rule. It's okay. So what's wrong with\nthat?\nMR. BALLENGER: That case would be\nreviewable, Your Honor, and properly so under the --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Under what theory?\nMR. BALLENGER: -- statutory ground of\nreview for exceeding jurisdiction.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why?\nMR. BALLENGER: Because in that case the\narbitrator is not even arguably construing or applying\nthe rules; he is dispensing his own brand of industrial\njustice, as this Court said in the Enterprise Wheel and\nCar case.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, point me to any\nrule, that --- you know, anybody could point to a rule\nand says it commands a result. They -- there are rules\nhere that say disputes should be submitted to the board\nand resolved. And they are resolving the dispute, the\ndispute, and they are saying, you have defaulted, you\ndidn't.\nMR. BALLENGER: But every -- every\nadjudicative body has to have the ability to set and\nenforce procedural rules governing its procedures.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But they can do that.\nThat's what -- that's what the circuit said.\nMR. BALLENGER: In the --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They could have passed a\nrule that told people, warned them, and said this is a\nprocedural rule we are going to apply.\nMR. BALLENGER: Well, they did, Your Honor.\nThey have Sections 301.2(a) and (b), which if you put\nthem together give at least fair warning of --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: At what point does the\ninterpretation of rules that don't command a result\nbecome improper, outside the board's jurisdiction?\nAccording to you, never.\nMR. BALLENGER: Under the -- under the\nSteelworkers standard of review for arbitral decisions,\nthere will be a point at which the board's\ninterpretation isn't even arguably grounded in -- in the\nrules, and it will be reviewable. As a matter of\nconstitutional due process, which is what we are here\ntalking about today, there probably is no point outside\nof the substantive interpretation of a criminal statute\nwhere that kind of interstitial gap-filling or\ninterpretation could be unfair. It happens to litigants\nall of the time that they come to a court and are\nsurprised by how a court resolves a disputed procedural\nquestion.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Geoghegan.\nMR. GEOGHEGAN: \"GAE-gunn,\" actually.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: \"GAE-gunn.\"\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS H. GEOGHEGAN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. GEOGHEGAN: Good afternoon, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\nThe first and most important thing that the\nRespondent would like to stress is that we are not here\nreviewing an arbitrator's interpretation of the contract\nor here under the review standards set by Steelworkers\ntrilogy. We never received an interpretation of the\ncontract, and by that I mean the contract in any\naspect -- procedural rules of the contract, substantive\nrules of the contract. No contract interpretation for\nthese five engineers. And the reason that the\nRespondent urged both a statutory and due process\nviolation is that without any interpretation of the\ncontract, these five cases were dismissed invoking\nCircular 1, Code of Federal Regulations, as the basis,\nand denying these five engineers any determination of\ntheir contract claims.\nThey never got to what the Railway Labor Act\nwith its mandatory arbitration procedure promised the\nengineers and the carriers: a resolution of their\ncontract claims for the purpose of industrial peace.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But it didn't -- it didn't\npromise them that categorically. There were certain\nthings they had to do, right? One of which was to have\nconferencing, and in three of these cases they didn't.\nSo that promise didn't extend at least to those three\ncases. And in the other two, where there was\nconferencing, the act also provides, as any sensible act\nwould have to, for the adoption of procedural rules.\nAnd the procedural rule here, according to the\narbitrator, required the submission of that evidence\nof -- of consultation with the complaint, which didn't\nhappen.\nMR. GEOGHEGAN: Your Honor, I respectfully\ndisagree. These cases -- the panel never said that the\nthree cases were not conferenced. Union Pacific has not\nsaid that these three cases were not conferenced. The\npanel said that, no matter how convincing the evidence\nthat these other three cases were conferenced, that all\nfive cases were conferenced, it would not consider that\nevidence because it was not attached to the original\nsubmission.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do -- do you say that all\nfive were -- were conferenced? Is that your position?\nMR. GEOGHEGAN: Oh, absolutely. We have\ncorrespondence --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But we have rules\nlike that -- we have rules like that all the time. No\nmatter how clear it is what happened below, if it wasn't\nincluded in the question presented, we say you can't\nraise it. This is just a rule like that.\nThey have a rule saying this is what you\nhave to do, you have got to put the evidence of\nconferencing in -- in the record at a particular time.\nYou didn't do it, so we are not going to -- the fact\nthat on the facts, on the real facts, it occurred is not\nan adequate challenge to the procedural rule.\nMR. GEOGHEGAN: Your Honor, that would be\ntrue if there was a rule that required these documents\nto be attached to the original submission. There is no\nsuch rule. 301 --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You think there is\nnow? In other words, this is -- rulemaking by\nadjudication is not unheard of.\nMR. GEOGHEGAN: Rulemaking by adjudication\nis not unheard of, Your Honor. But this is not\nrulemaking by adjudication because this particular\npanel, which is an arbitration panel, a division, it's\nfive members, it's a division of the adjustment board,\nhas no power to make rules. Congress in section (v) of\nSection 153 of the act delegated the rulemaking power\nunder this act on a one-time basis. In fact, it put in\nthe dates. It had to start in June 1934 and be done in\n19 -- October 1934. That is the only power that this\n34-member adjustment board has to make rules.\nA panel has no power delegated to it by the\nCongress under this act, and the act is very specific,\nbecause Congress --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So is it -- is --\nwhere is the rule that there has to be conferencing?\nMR. GEOGHEGAN: The rule -- there is no rule\nthat there has to be conferencing. There --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think -- you\nthink that was where the board erred, in requiring\nconferencing?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's in the statute, isn't\nit?\nMR. GEOGHEGAN: It is in Section 152, which\nis not a statute, by the way, that the NRAB administers.\nWe are not disputing that we have to prove\nconferencing. We're happy to prove it. We have\nevidence of conferencing.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's -- can\nthe board adopt procedures about how you go about\nproving conferencing? You say there is no rule because\nthere wasn't a rule adopted in 1934. There is a rule\nthat there has to be conferencing. Does that mean that\nat any point in time you can just pop up and say, oh, by\nthe way, there was conferencing? Or can the board say,\nthis is how you go about establishing it?\nMR. GEOGHEGAN: We believe that, given there\nare no rules on this point -- and the Seventh Circuit\nmade that point clear -- that what has been to be done\nis to facilitate the purpose of the act, which is to get\na contract interpretation. We have --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So they can -- the\nboard can never have a rule that says, you have to\nestablish conferencing, you know, before the date of the\nfirst arbitral proceeding, or within 30 days? The fact\nthat all that has to happen under the act is that there\nbe conferencing, you are free to establish it at any way\nyou want, at any time you want?\nMR. GEOGHEGAN: No, you're not. Your Honor,\nyou are not free to establish it any way you want. You\nhave to have relevant evidence that the conferences\noccurred, relevant probative evidence that it is not\nprejudicial. The only rule that has been cited here for\nkeeping this evidence out is 301.5, and that is at page\n50 -- 62a. And it is the rule that the Seventh Circuit\nfocused on, and it describes what should be in the\noriginal submission. And it says, if I may quote part\nof it, at 62a, the Court can read along with me: that\n\"Under the caption 'position of employees,' the\nemployees must clearly and briefly set forth all\nrelevant argumentative facts, including all documentary\nevidence submitted in exhibit form quoting the agreement\nor rules involved, if any; and all data submitted in\nsupport of employees' position, must affirmatively show\nthe same to have been presented to the carrier and made\na part of the particular question in dispute.\"\nThat rule is referring to the investigative\nprocess as to whether -- for example, one of the\nengineers ran a red light, it's alleged. So we are\ngoing to argue about that. They put on testimony. We\nhave witnesses. There is cross-examination. And then\nthe investigative officer makes a decision about whether\nthat's going to be put in the record.\nThe conference is an informal phone call.\nIt's not specified in the collective bargaining\nagreement. There is nothing in the collective\nbargaining agreement about it. But it's an informal\nphone call that takes place after the whole contract\ngrievance procedure has been exhausted, and then,\nbefore, it can be 30 seconds -- you know, Charlie\nRidenour, can call up Mr. Stone and say -- you know, can\nwe settle this? No. We can't. Okay.\nThat's -- that's a conference. That's all\nit is, and what has to happen under the Act and,\nunfortunately -- and it is unfortunate, we did not put\nin the joint appendix, Section 2, Part 6, 152, Part 6,\nof the Railway Labor Act, which describes what happens.\nThe union has to send a letter requesting a conference.\nI hope it is not out of turn, given that we\nhave been describing evidence, but we've got letters\nabout all of these conferences, saying, we want to have\na conference. Once that happens, that triggers a\nprocess. They have to specify -- both sides have to get\ntogether and specify a meeting take place.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where -- where does\nit say the unions have to send in letters requesting a\nconference?\nMR. GEOGHEGAN: Oh, it's in Section 2 of\nPart 6 of the Railway Labor Act. We did not cite that.\nIt's in the statute.\nThe conferencing, by the way, is in Section\n2 of the Railway Labor Act. The board and its power and\nprocedures is in Section 3. Section 3 has no mention of\nconferencing whatsoever in it. There isn't -- the word\ndoesn't appear in the section which describes what the\nboard is supposed to do or the board's procedures.\nAnd it doesn't appear in the CFRs either.\nThe CFR's has this rule, Your Honor, that says -- you\nknow, trial type evidence has to be presented at this\ninvestigative hearing below. Why? Because it's an\nappellate court mand you don't want to get surprised --\nyou know, the union can't come forward in this case and\nsay, well, we have a surprise witness that shows\nMr. Smith didn't run the red light.\nI mean, that's just out of bounds. It\nsurprises. It's blind-siding. You can't do it. The\nSeventh Circuit said: Wait a second. This rule doesn't\nhave anything to do of proof of whether this phone call\noccurred after the whole written record has been created\nbelow. There are no rules about this, and, given that\nthere are no rules -- and given that the union -- and\nthe panel says this in its opinion -- is waving before\nthe panel -- you know, Mr. Neutral, we have letters --\nyou know, back and forth between the parties about the\nfact that conferences occurred, and they don't dispute\nthat two of them occurred.\nJUSTICE ALITO: I -- I still don't\nunderstand your answer to the Chief Justice's question\nabout how the panels -- how these panels -- how the\nboard, in your view, is supposed to go about making some\nsort of sensible procedural rules about establishing the\nthat conferencing took place.\nThey can't do it by rulemaking, and you seem\nto argue that they can't do it by adjudication, so\nwhat -- they can't do it at all? There -- this is just\ngoing to be chaos, that there is no way to establish a\nregular procedure to establish that there was\nconferencing?\nMR. GEOGHEGAN: Your Honor, that's a good\nquestion. I think the answer is that there are no\nprocedures on this because it wasn't -- it's not part of\nthe -- the process was set up to develop the trial type\nevidence -- you know, whether the red light was run or\nnot.\nIt wasn't set up to determine how\nconferencing occurred, and it's artificial to put the\nrulemaking in here. The Seventh Circuit said:\nGiving -- given the how and why of it, it should be done\nin a way that is least prejudicial to the parties.\nThe Union Pacific could have raised this\nissue when we filed the notices. They didn't. They\ndidn't because the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You said, on that point\nin your brief, that, normally, the carrier will raise\nthe absence of conferencing as an impediment at the time\nthe union files its notice of intent to file a\nsubmission.\nWhat is -- what is the basis? You didn't\ngive any citation for that. You say, ordinarily, that's\nwhat the -- the carrier will -- would do, and then you\nare tipped off, and then you put in your evidence about\nconferencing.\nWhat -- what makes you -- what backs up this\nstatement that, normally, carrier raises the absence of\nconferencing as an impediment at the time the union\nfiles its notice of intent?\nMR. GEOGHEGAN: Your Honor, the answer is\npast practice. Although this is not a collective\nbargaining situation, we are not applying the\ncontractor. That was the past practice. That's what we\nalleged. This case was to show --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So could the\nboard -- could the board adopt a rule requiring that?\nMR. GEOGHEGAN: The adjustment board could\nadopt a rule. That is the agency -- and it still\nexists. It has got offices here in Washington, D.C., 34\nmembers. They were given this explicit rulemaking power\nby Congress. They were delegated with the authority.\nIf there is an agency out there that is entitled to\nChevron type deference, that is the agency.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do they do anything else?\nWhat do they do? What does the adjustment board do?\nMR. GEOGHEGAN: Your Honor, I'm not sure.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't want to get you in\ntrouble, but I'm not sure they do anything.\nMR. GEOGHEGAN: I --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just to be clear --\nI will take you off the hook.\n(Laughter. )\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just to be clear,\nyou say it's established practice that the railroads\nnormally file their objection at a -- you know, at a\nparticular point, and you think the board is without\npower to say: Look. This is the established practice.\nYou, railroad, did not follow it, and so we're not going\nto consider your objections.\nMR. GEOGHEGAN: No, no, Your Honor. Our --\nour position is --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. No. You mean\nthat they -- the board can't do that?\nMR. GEOGHEGAN: We don't think that the\nboard can or should do that. What we do think is that,\nif there is -- the rule that I just read from, 301.5,\nsays that you raise relevant argumentative facts.\nUnion Pacific, when the parties exchanged\nthe submissions, did not say that there wasn't any\nconferencing. Now, their -- their comeback to that in\nthe reply brief was, well, we didn't know you had not\nconferenced until we saw that you didn't have any\nevidence of it. I mean, that's just not -- slightly, in\nour view, disingenuous.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Could they -- could they\nadopt a rule that says that, if the -- if the parties go\nthrough -- do everything that is necessary prior to the\ntime of the adjudication, they can't pop up at the very\nlast minute and send in a letter saying: Oh. By the\nway, there was no conferencing; could they adopt a rule\nlike that because it's just a big waste of everybody's\ntime to leave it to -- to the last minute?\nMR. GEOGHEGAN: Your Honor, in our view, the\npanel couldn't, but the adjustment board could, and the\nadjustment board comes out with these little procedures,\nlike the one read here that -- which they say is not\nrelevant, that says -- you know, let's have these joint\nsubmissions, let's keep evidence of conferencing out.\nThey are trying to -- these submissions that\ncome in for these arbitration cases are not to be\nbelieved. I mean, they are like six feet high. So\nthere is a constant effort on the part of everybody in\nthe process to pare down the submissions to what is\nactually in dispute.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought, under the\nSteelworkers trilogy, the arbitrators has broad\ndeference to adopt these sorts of modes of procedure.\nMR. GEOGHEGAN: But, Your Honor --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That we would review\nonly for whatever it is.\nMR. GEOGHEGAN: This is not the Steelworkers\ntrilogy. The Steelworkers trilogy is about private\narbitrators determining private contracts and\ndetermining the procedures under private contracts.\nThey are -- they are applying the procedural rules of\nthe contract. There is nothing like that here.\nWe are here because a government-funded\npanel, under a mandatory procedure, funded by the\ngovernment, was applying the Code of Federal\nRegulations, not rules that the parties agreed to\nthemselves, so the deference that is given to -- by this\nCourt to a private arbitrator applying private\nprocedural rules that the parties agree to, and so on\nand so forth, isn't present here because this is\ngovernmental action. It is a governmental agency.\nNow, we can -- the AFL-CIO gets into an\nargument about whether it's a state action. But the\nbottom line is that these are arbitrators paid for by\nthe government. The arbitrators are selected -- or the\neligible pool is selected by the government.\nThey are applying the Code of Federal\nRegulations to keep us from getting to any procedural\nrule or any substantive rule under a private collective\nbargaining agreement. That looks a lot like\ngovernmental action blocking the people from getting\ntheir -- resolution of their private contractual claims.\nThat's why --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the review -- the\nreview of government arbitrators arbitrating provisions\npursuant to a collective bargaining agreement, the\nstandard of review of that is different than private\narbitrators under the Steelworkers trilogy?\nMR. GEOGHEGAN: It should be, and, in the\nhornbook sense, it is, the reality of it is, and that's\ntrue here. We can say it's de novo review. We can say\nit's a different standard than -- than Steelworkers or\nJohn Wiley, and this is not a John Wiley case.\nBut the reality is you aren't going to get a\ncourt's attention, unless they did something that is\nactionable under the Steelworker trilogy, too. And the\nSteelworker trilogy has the Enterprise Wheel case, which\nsays, if the arbitrator starts making up rules\nwilly-nilly, dispensing \"his own brand of industrial\njustice,\" not drawing their essence from the collective\nbargaining agreement or, in this case, the CFRs.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you don't think\nthat this is that. I mean, if you say: Look. Here's\nthe rule. You have got to file these things by this\ndate, that is not imposing your own rule of industrial\njustice.\nMR. GEOGHEGAN: But there is no such rule,\nYour Honor. I mean, if -- if there was, we would be in\na --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm saying that, if\nthe board adopts a procedure exactly like that, you may\nchallenge it as-- as violating due process because you\ndidn't have notice, any number of things, but you can't\nsay that the board is imposing its own brand of\nindustrial justice.\nThat sort of seems, to me, goes to the\nmerits in the standards of arbitration, rather than\nprocedures like this, unless it's a procedure like was\nhypothesized earlier, that only applies to one side and\nnot the other.\nMR. GEOGHEGAN: Your Honor, all I can say,\nin answer to that, is that there are governmental rules\nthat have very specific procedures that are in place.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought your position\nwas -- at least I thought I heard you say earlier, that\nthese individual panels do not have rulemaking authority\nfor the board. I'm looking at something that says,\n\"National Railway Adjustment Board, Uniform Rules of\nProcedure, Revised June 23rd.\" That's put out by the --\nthe board, the one that you said that is --\nMR. GEOGHEGAN: The adjustment board down\nthe street. 34 members.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And I thought that\nyour -- because there's nothing in this statute, nothing\nin any regulation, that gives an individual panel the\nright to proscribe rules of procedure that all parties\nto these disputes are obliged to follow.\nMR. GEOGHEGAN: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That -- that authority is\nvested only in the board, not in the panels.\nMR. GEOGHEGAN: Arguably, in the board.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know how that could\npossibly be true. I can't imagine being an arbitrator\nand not being able to say: All right, you know, we are\ngoing to have a conference next Tuesday. I want you to\nhave all of the -- all of the papers relevant to this\nparticular point that we are going to discuss in by two\ndays before.\nCan't do that?\nMR. GEOGHEGAN: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I would not know how to run\nan arbitration without -- without establishing some\nrules of procedure.\nMR. GEOGHEGAN: Your Honor, that didn't\nhappen here. If I may explain, there is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well --\nMR. GEOGHEGAN: The whole question that this\nwas -- that these documents were --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, at least back off\nfrom your statement that an arbitrator cannot set rules\nof procedure.\nMR. GEOGHEGAN: I -- well, Your Honor, an\narbitrator can set rules of procedure within the\nparameters of what is allowed by the act.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, all right. That's a\nlittle different.\nMR. GEOGHEGAN: But the act itself, and the\nCFRs, are very clear that there is no requirement that\nthis evidence has to be submitted in the original\nsubmission. And once the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you're making sense.\nIt says that, or it just doesn't address the question of\nwhether they have to be included in the original\nsubmission? I mean, I assume there is no provision that\nsays -- or I missed it, there is no provision that says\nthe conferencing materials do not have to be included in\nthe original submission?\nMR. GEOGHEGAN: There is no CFR that says\nthat the conferencing materials have to be in the\noriginal submission or the case is dismissed. There is\nnothing like --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Presumably, there is\nnone that says they don't have to be. In other words, I\ntake it that this is an issue that is simply not\naddressed by the CFR rules?\nMR. GEOGHEGAN: Well, in any specific way.\nI understand Your Honor's point, but the fact of it is\nthat the record that you attach to the original\nsubmission is only about the relevant argumentative\nfacts that are in dispute. That doesn't mean that\nthat -- that there isn't other evidence in the record\ndown below.\nWhat happened here, and this is different\nfrom all the other cases, is that the union came in and\nsaid: Oh, we've got evidence. And we've got evidence\nthat relates even to correspondence between the parties.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you are just\ndisputing the validity or applicability of the rule.\nYou don't want to comply with the rule. I mean, is it\nany different than saying: Look, okay, we've got this\narbitration that is going to go forward. We are going\nto meet at 10:00 Monday morning. It is the first\nmeeting. One side doesn't show up and then they say,\nwell, there's no rule that says we have to be there at\n10:00 Monday morning; that's just the arbitrator saying\nthat to -- to move the procedure along, so you can't\npenalize us in any way for not showing up at 10:00\nMonday morning.\nMR. GEOGHEGAN: I think that an arbitrator\ncould penalize a party for not showing up. But the --\nthe fact of this is that there is no authority in the\narbitrator to bar evidence of conferencing simply\nbecause it wasn't in the original citation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I take it your point is\nthat there is a rule? It's called 29 CFR 301.7(b). If\nthat rule happened to say, you must show up by 11, that\nwould be a fair inference you don't have to show up by\n10. And that rule says you have to submit the\nargumentative facts, so there is a fair inference you\ndon't have to submit the facts that are not\nargumentative.\nI take it that that -- suppose that you are\nwrong -- suppose that you are wrong on that. I think\nmaybe you are right, but suppose you are wrong. Suppose\nthey have loads of authority to make rules. Again, you\nhave a strong argument they don't, but suppose they did.\nIn your research -- and the same question is\nreally addressed to your fellow counsel. In your\nresearch on this, did you find any instance in which\neither a court or an agency does change a rule, and\nsays: Now you have to say the date right underneath the\ncaption, whereas previously it was stamped by the clerk.\nOkay? They changed the rule. And they have every good\nreason in the world for doing it. And then they apply\nit to the case in front of them, which didn't know about\nit, and then they won't let them change it.\nNow, is there any case at all which said\nthat that was lawful? I can think of lots of cases that\nsay you cannot apply rules retroactively where it is\nunfair to do it, even if you had have all the power in\nthe world to make the rules. I have lots of cases like\nthat. What I wondered is if anybody found a case along\nthe lines that I just said.\nMR. GEOGHEGAN: We did not, Your Honor, and\nthe Wells case in particular, where there was no\nquestion that the rule was valid, was a case where the\nFourth Circuit found a violation of due process because\nthe parties did not have reasonable notice, or the\ncarrier in that case did not have reasonable notice that\nit was the postage date that was the date for the brief,\ninstead of the postmark.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you recall the\nsituation -- do you recall the situation Justice Breyer\ndescribed, and we can debate about it, whether it's\nrulemaking by adjudication, which does take place, you\nwould say that in the situation you described, it\nviolated due process, right?\nMR. GEOGHEGAN: I would say that it is also\nin excess of the arbitrator's power under the act\nbecause this arbitrator does not have rulemaking power.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And because -- I mean, in\nthe normal --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you said he did\nhave rulemaking power, so long as it did not contradict\n--\nMR. GEOGHEGAN: Your Honor, you were asking\nme whether he could require the parties to show up at a\ncertain time. I mean, there are certain rulings that\nare in the case. I don't want to get hung up on -- on\nrules.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Let's not get -- can I ask\nabout argumentative facts? I frankly have never heard\nof a phrase like argumentative facts. You seem to think\nit means only those facts that are in dispute.\nMR. GEOGHEGAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that would be a\npretty incomprehensible statement of the -- of the\nevent, if you write in your brief statement of facts and\nyou only write down the facts that are disputed and none\nof the facts that are agreed to.\nIt couldn't possibly mean that. I would\nthink that argumentative facts simply means facts\nrelevant to the argument, and one of the facts relevant\nto the argument is whether you did the necessary\nconsultation. But I don't know how you could interpret\nargumentative facts to mean only those facts that are in\ndispute. What kind of a statement of facts would that\nbe?\nMR. GEOGHEGAN: Well, Your Honor, you may be\ncorrect in your view of it, but the parties have\ninterpreted this as being the facts that are in dispute.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well --\nMR. GEOGHEGAN: And remember, this is a\nprocedure that is not about conferencing or proving\nconferencing, it is a procedure that -- about what\nhappened at the trial.\nSo when you are looking at that 301.5, you\nare looking at a rule that is designed to make clear to\nthe arbitrator and the panel what it is that is being\ndisputed, after the investigative hearing where the\ncarrier superintendent signs off and says, you know, we\nare going to discharge this guy because he ran the red\nlight.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What does the government\nparty define --\nMR. GEOGHEGAN: In that context, it is not\nabout conferencing at all.\nJUSTICE ALITO: How does the party filing\nthe grievance know exactly which facts are in dispute at\nthe time when they made the submission? Here, there's a\ndispute about whether there was a dispute about\nconferencing.\nMR. GEOGHEGAN: Yes. Well, that's because\nthis particular rule is so focused on what happens at\ntrial.\nYour Honor, if you look at the collective\nbargaining agreement and the trial-type procedures, they\nare elaborate. It is like a state court proceeding.\nThere is not a neutral party. There is a carrier's\nofficer behind it. But you have union representatives\nwho are better than most lawyers, I must say, in terms\nof putting in the exhibits and evidentiary record and\ncross-examination. This is all transcribed elaborately\nin the transcript, so that it's like at the end of a\ntrial. I mean, the parties know, at the end of a\ncontested criminal or civil trial that may go on for,\nbasically, all day, what the facts are that are in\ndispute.\nBut at any rate, this is the regulation that\nwas created in 1934, and it was not about proving\nconference --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask you this\nquestion, if I may: Your opponent says there is sort of\na common-law adjudication method of developing new\nrules. And that there is precedent out there for\ndismissing these arbitrations because the conferencing\nwas not established in the record at the time the\nproceeding started. Is this a reference to the -- to\nprecedent, correct?\nMR. GEOGHEGAN: Your Honor, this isn't a\nsystem of precedent. There is certainly no strict stare\ndecisis here.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, I understand that,\nbut were there presidents that might well have put you\non notice that you better get this in the record?\nMR. GEOGHEGAN: No, Your Honor, not in or\nour view. I mean, the cases they cite are arbitration\nawards where the arbitrator says, looking at the whole\nrecord, not what was attached to the original submission\n-- there isn't a single arbitration award that says, we\nare only looking at the original submission and we won't\nlook at any evidence that might have been in the record\nbelow and you want to add now. There isn't any case\nlike that. So -- but there are only a handful of these\ncases that they cite in the joint appendix.\nYour Honor, there are probably 60,000,\n70,000 of these cases. They are not codified online.\nWhat lawyer -- what lawyer would want to practice law in\na system where the procedural rules are maybe in 4 cases\nout of 80,000 that are not codified --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, that's really not my\n-- but you do concede, do you, that there are half a\ndozen cases out there which were dismissed because there\nwas the failure of the record to show that there was\nconferencing below?\nMR. GEOGHEGAN: We do admit that, but we say\nthat in our particular case, the record would certainly\ninclude or we would be allowed to supplement with the\nevidence from the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So your -- your objection\nis -- is two-fold. One, that you think the requirement\nthat the record show it affirmatively is not supported.\nAnd secondly, there -- you should have had an\nindependent right to -- to make an offer of proof that\nwould have cured the defect.\nMR. GEOGHEGAN: That's correct and we don't\nknow of any case that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You did -- you did make\nan offer of proof as to --\nMR. GEOGHEGAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In fact, the panel\ninvited it and you have made it; and then the panel said\nsorry, it's too late, you have to do it at the time you\nmake your initial filing.\nMR. GEOGHEGAN: Your Honor, I don't -- I\nwish I had made that point earlier. I mean, they --\nthey -- originally we passionately objected to this, and\nthe -- and the neutral members said, oh, fine, you know,\nwe will -- we will reconvene for -- we will reschedule\nthis in three months, come back.\nSo everybody came back with the evidence.\nUnion Pacific came back with what -- I mean, they found\nout that, in fact, they have -- probably two of these\ncases had been conferenced, we came back with our\nletters, we said here it is, and -- and the neutral\nmember said, oh, no, you don't understand, I didn't\nreally want you to do this. So, you know, why -- why --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think you\ncould submit that offer of proof at any time during the\nproceeding and the board would have to accept it?\nMR. GEOGHEGAN: We think of it as relevant,\nprobative evidence as to conferencing when the objection\nhad not been raised at the time that these cases were\nconferenced, at the time that this --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why wouldn't the\nother side say we don't have to raise the objection at a\nparticular time. You can't make a rule telling us we\nhave to do that.\nMR. GEOGHEGAN: Your Honor, I'm afraid there\nis such a rule, and that is 301.5. And it says that the\nparties have to praise relevant argumentative facts in\nthe original submission. That doesn't mean that it only\nhas to be in the original submission, but there was only\none submission here, and they did not raise\nconferencing.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your answer to my\nearlier question is that you can submit that offer of\nproof at any time, and it has to be considered?\nMR. GEOGHEGAN: Well, any time that the\nobjection is raised. If -- if it is not done in a way\nthat prejudices the other party, the answer is yes.\nThere is no rule that prohibits that.\nAnd the purpose of the Act, Your Honor, is\nto get the parties to have contract interpretations.\nAnd the way this was done -- the way these cases were\ndismissed without any hearing and what the Seventh\nCircuit called blind-siding and what the union\ndissidents said was gamesmanship is the kind of thing\nthat should be of concern of this Court, because it\nreally undermines the integrity of the arbitration\nprocess, and it's very important to keep that.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask you some\nquestions about the common law that we are talking about\nhere.\nMR. GEOGHEGAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Are there also cases out\nthere in which the record doesn't tell us whether there\nwas conferencing, but nevertheless, the merits were\ndecided?\nMR. GEOGHEGAN: Oh, sure. I mean, but it --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: There are least six -- six\nor are there more than that?\nMR. GEOGHEGAN: I don't think that there\nare -- there are the cases that we cited where it turned\nout there wasn't conferencing and the arbitrator said go\nback and conference. I mean, you can step outside the\nhall and do it in 30 seconds. You know, it's a -- it's\na statutory procedure that is not really part of this\nproof process that is set up by the collective\nbargaining agreement. Well, my time up.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Geoghegan.\nMr. Ballenger, you have three minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF J. SCOTT BALLENGER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BALLENGER: Four quick points.\nJustice Stevens, the awards that you are\nlooking for are at pages 40 and 45 of the joint\nappendix, and also we would suggest that you look at\nfirst division award 23883, which is easy to locate.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Were any of those\ndecisions that were boardwise or did they apply to one\npanel?\nMR. BALLENGER: All these decisions are\nrendered by one panel. The board never sits as -- as a\nbody.\nThe Respondent suggests that the Steelworker\ntrilogy standard that this Court has articulated for\nlabor arbitration generally doesn't apply under the RLA.\nThere is no authority for that, that many I am aware of.\nThe lower courts have understood it the same way, and\nthere is every reason to think that's correct. Congress\nwas quite clear in the legislative history to the '66\namendment that it anticipated that the standard of\nreview under this statute would be the same as that\napplied in ordinary private labor arbitration. And, of\ncourse, the Sheehan case rejects the idea that there is\nsome kind of special judicial review for question of law\nunder the RLA.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But there is a\ndifference between governmentally ordered arbitrations\nand private contracts. In private contracts the parties\nnegotiate the rules and they set them forth, and the\narbitrators then follow --\nMR. BALLENGER: The difference, Your Honor,\nI believe, is that in the ordinary arbitral context when\nyou have a procedural question, the question is what the\nparties would have wanted. Here the question is what\nCongress would have wanted, but there is no -- about the\ncorrect standards of review. But there is no reason to\nthink that Congress wanted anything other than what the\nparties ordinarily want under this case law, which is\nfor procedural questions to be resolved by the\narbitrator.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is it your position that\nif you go through the first phase and as everybody is\nwalking out the two adversaries in the first\ninvestigative space say this is never going to be\nsettled, this is the most important case in the history\nof this -- the railroad system. Let's go take it to the\nboard.\nMR. BALLENGER: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That they can't waive\nthe grievance procedure, that they just can't go\nstraight to you?\nMR. BALLENGER: That -- that's correct, Your\nHonor. The statute in section 2 Second requires a\nconference. And Respondents argued initially in this\ncase that the statute shouldn't be read that way and\nthere should be an exception read in from section 2\nSixth. That was rejected by the district court and they\nchose not to appeal it to the Seventh Circuit. It's not\nbefore this Court.\nNow, Respondent focuses a lot on section\n301.5 in its language about argumentative facts. I\nthink that our interpretation here today of that\nlanguage isn't ultimately the point. That this is a\nquestion for the arbitrators to resolve unless -- even\nif a court is convinced that the arbitrators committed\nserious error.\nBut the more important maybe threshold point\nis that the arbitrators didn't say that they were\nresting their opinion just on section 301.5. They never\ninvoked 301.5. They said circular one and the weight of\nprecedent under the arbitration. And if this Court\nlooks at section 301.2(a), which requires the parties to\ninclude all facts relevant to the dispute in their\ninitial submissions, I think that resolves the\nquestion.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But we disagree with\nyou. You say if the board was just plain wrong. If we\nlook at the Act and circular one and say we can't find\nwhat they said anywhere in there, does that doom your\nargument? Have they asked -- acted outside, has the\nboard acted outside its jurisdiction?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You may answer the\nquestion, counsel.\nMR. BALLENGER: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice.\nThe relevant standard is if the board is\neven arguably construing or applying the relevant rules\nand its decision stands, even if a court is convinced\nthat the arbitrator committed serious error.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you counsel.\n"
