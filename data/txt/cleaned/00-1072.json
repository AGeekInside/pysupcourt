Lynchburg College.\nMr. Schnapper.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe relation-back rule for verification under\nsection 1601.12(b) is a proper exercise of the authority\ngranted to the EEOC under section 713 of title VII to\npromulgate procedural regulations. The regulation is\nconsistent with the language of section 706. Title VII\nrequires that a charge be verified, and the statute also\nrequires that a charge be filed within 180 or 300 days of\nthe act of discrimination.\nBut as Judge Luttig correctly observed below,\nthese two statutory requirements are independent of each\nother. Specifically, 706(e)(1) establishes deadlines of\n180 or 300 days, but it applies those deadlines only to\nwhen, quote, a charge must be filed. Section 706(e)(1)\ndoes not purport to establish a deadline for verification.\nConversely, section 706(b) requires verification, but it\ncontains no deadline for doing so. That omission is\nparticularly significant because other requirements which\nare contained in 706(b) do have deadlines.\nQUESTION: What -- what about the other elements\nthat -- that are required by the statute to be in the --\nin the charge?\nSurely the commission has to serve notice of the\ncharge, including the date and place and circumstances of\nthe alleged unlawful employment practice. Isn't that\nstatutory provision implicitly a requirement that the\ncharge contain the date, place, and circumstances of the\nalleged unlawful practice?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: I wouldn't go quite that far.\nThe -- the commission's interpretation of that, which is\nembodied in section 1601.12(b), concludes that a charge is\nsufficient if it identifies the parties and contains a\ndescription of the alleged discriminatory practice.\nQUESTION: Well, how -- how can -- how can the\nstatute be complied with? I mean, the statute,\n2000e-5(b), clearly says that the commission on receiving\na charge shall serve a notice of it, paren, including the\ndate, place, and circumstances of the alleged unlawful\nemployment practice on the employer.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Well, it does -- it does so\nprovide. But it also provides that the -- that the charge\nshall contain the information and be in the form required\nby the commission. The commission does not require that\nparticular information. Ordinarily it could be inferred\nin practice --\nQUESTION: So, you think the charge doesn't even\nhave to -- because the commission hasn't chosen to require\nthat, a charge doesn't even have to contain the date,\ncircumstances, and place of the alleged --\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Well, the commission has --\nQUESTION: What does it have to contain?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: The regulation requires --\nQUESTION: I have been discriminated against?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: I understand the regulation to\nrequire more specificity than that. That -- that question\nis not posed, of course, by this case. No one questions\nthe specificity of the information in this letter. It\ndid --\nQUESTION: No. I understand that. But -- but\nwhat you say about -- about the requirement or -- or\nnonrequirement of -- of oath, of it being under oath, I\nthink you -- you're going to have to logically say about\nother requirements or, as you think them, nonrequirements\nof the charge. I don't see how -- how the two don't go\nhand in hand.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: I -- I think that you have to\nread -- well, the commission's view is that there is an\nirreducible minimum that has to be in a charge. You can't\njust file a piece of paper called -- that says charge and\nfill in the blanks later.\nQUESTION: Why? Why does it come to that\nposition? It just made it up?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: The statute expressly provides\nthat the commission can specify what information needs to\nbe in a charge, and that's the -- that's the answer they\ngive.\nQUESTION: I see. Not because there's any\nstatutory compulsion, but just in its -- in its wisdom and\nbeneficence, the commission has decided that there has to\nbe a certain minimal amount of information in the charge,\nnot because the statute implies that there must be.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: I -- I don't -- Federal Register\nrecounts any -- any explanation, but it seems to me it\nwould be logical for the commission to have looked at the\nprovision to which you refer in -- in framing the -- the\nrequirements it has.\nQUESTION: Right, but if it looked at the\nprovision to which I refer, it would say a charge has to\n-- we're not going to bother an employer and require him\nto come back with a response unless you haven't just come\nin and said, I've been discriminated against. We're not\ngoing to ask the employer, has this person been\ndiscriminated against? You tell us the date, the place,\nand the circumstances. Now, that's perfectly reasonable.\nBut it seems to me also perfectly reasonable to\nsay, moreover, we're not going to go and bother the\nemployer and make the employer go through all the process\nof -- of answering the charge unless you're serious enough\nabout it that you've -- you've sworn to it under oath, as\nthe -- as the statute requires.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Well, what happens as a\npractical matter where verification occurs after the\nfiling date is that the employer is usually not required\nto actually take any action.\nQUESTION: But here what -- the employer wasn't\neven -- wasn't notified until the form -- on the EEOC's\nproper form that did everything, including the\nverification. You seem to have treated both the same way,\nthat -- that all that the imperfect charge did was stop\nthe clock, but the EEOC didn't give notice to the employer\nat that point. That wasn't the charge -- the form in\nwhich the charge went to the employer. As I understand\nit, the employer never got the form until it had been\nperfected.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Your Honor, it's our view that\nthe -- that the court -- that the EEOC erred in not\nproviding notice at that time, and it's -- I think it's\nclear, from a reading of the compliance manual, that its\nown manual did require notice at that time.\nBut in any event --\nQUESTION: And would also require notice of --\nof a charge that was imperfect in other respects within 10\ndays of receiving the charge. So, if a -- the requirement\nthat it be in writing, for example, that's a requirement\nthat isn't -- isn't particularly in the -- in the statute\nof limitations provision, but it's a requirement that it\nbe in writing.\nSo, the commission gets a phone complaint from\nsomebody who says, my employer is discriminating against\nme. Now, you're saying that the commission should within\n10 days contact the employer about that.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: The -- it's our view that --\nthat if the commission receives a sufficient charge, it\nmust do so. The regulations do not contemplate that a\nphone call is a sufficient charge, and they specify how it\n-- that would have to be put in writing --\nQUESTION: This is all just a matter of the\nregulations. I mean, the commission can -- can just say,\nyou know, this is sufficient or isn't. This commission\ncould say that a phone call is sufficient.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: The -- the statute requires that\na charge be filed, so I think it would have to be reduced\nto writing. But I --\nQUESTION: The word filed.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: But I would say the commission\nprobably could alter its -- its regulation and deem a\nmemorialized phone call the filing of the charge. That's\n-- those aren't the circumstances here.\nAnd -- and to get back to the specific issue\nbefore the Court, the Fifth Circuit -- excuse me -- the\nFourth Circuit would have reached the same result in this\ncase regardless of whether this letter -- notice of this\nletter or the letter itself had been served on the\nemployer within 10 days of the receipt of the letter on\nNovember 14th. The decision below didn't rest on that.\nEven if there had been service and notice, the court of\nappeals would still have held the regulation was invalid.\nAnd -- and it's the validity of that specific regulation\n-- that's the only question that the court of appeals\naddressed.\nQUESTION: Mr. Schnapper, if you agree that if\n-- you started out with Judge Luttig's position. He\nconcurred and he raised four other. Did the EEOC consider\nthis a charge? We don't know whether it did. Wouldn't\nthe case have to go back so that the full court of appeals\ncould examine those questions on which Judge Luttig rested\nso that he ended up concurring rather than dissenting?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Yes. Yes. It remains --\nQUESTION: So, you agree that those four\nquestions are alive and would have to be --\nMR. SCHNAPPER: It -- it remains open to the --\nto the respondent to raise those issues on remand, and we\nthink that that's the appropriate procedure --\nQUESTION: Thank you.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: -- for addressing it.\nThe -- as I was saying, specifically 706(e)(1)\nand 706(b) establish separate and distinct requirements.\nIn the terms of Chevron, the question is whether those\nprovisions, read together, clearly require in an\nunambiguous manner that verification happened before the\ncharge-filing deadline. We think that -- that such\nclarity certainly isn't present here. To the contrary,\nour view is that the most plausible reading of the statute\nis that verification could happen after the charge-filing\ndeadline. That's a particularly reasonable construction\nof the statute because that is the common law rule.\nThat's the rule --\nQUESTION: Do you think it's good practice for\nthe EEOC to wait until after the 300-day period and a\nverification before it even notifies the employer?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: No. No. It was -- in our view,\nit was improper to have done that here, that the -- the\nstatute doesn't authorize them to await verification. It\nis our understanding that is not their practice. It is\nnot authorized by the compliance manual. The compliance\nmanual does identify some circumstances in which there\nmight be delay in -- notification. Verification is not\none of them.\nQUESTION: Let me -- suppose you have a\nstatutory provision which says that the complaint shall be\nin writing, sworn to under oath, shall set forth the time,\nplace, and circumstances of the alleged grievance, comma,\nand shall be presented to the agency within 100 days after\nthe alleged grievance. Now, would you be taking the same\nposition you take here, that that's a separate\nrequirement --\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- and that --\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Yes. We would --\nQUESTION: Do you have any -- any -- I would\nnever read a statute that way. It would certainly seem to\nme that -- that what they're talking about to be filed\nwithin 100 days is what they have just described. And --\nand --\nMR. SCHNAPPER: I don't --\nQUESTION: Do you have any cases of ours --\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Well --\nQUESTION: -- that -- that go that far?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: The Federal rules require that a\nnotice of appeal shall be in writing and shall be filed\nwithin a certain period of time. And yet, in Becker v.\nMontgomery, the Court concluded that that didn't mean that\nan unsigned -- that -- that where the only document that\nwas filed on time wasn't signed -- that there was no\ntimely notice of appeal.\nThe -- the -- and -- and indeed, the common law\nrule was where a statute said a complaint must be verified\nand the complaint must be filed within a certain number of\n-- of days or years, the -- the uniform Federal and State\ninterpretation of that was that the lack of verification\ncould be corrected after the expiration of the deadline.\nIt seems to us that the commission reasonably\nconcluded that Congress would have not wanted a more\nstringent rule about relation-back of verification to\napply in the administrative process, a process ordinarily\ninitiated by laymen unassisted by counsel, than would\napply in civil litigation which is much more formal and\nwhich -- and, you know, the -- the common law rule about\ncorrecting verification after the fact applied regardless\nof whether, as would normally be the case, the -- the\nparty involved was represented by counsel. So, we -- we\nthink the common law rule is a very important part of the\nbackground of the statute.\nQUESTION: In these other situations that you\nmentioned, does the court take action against a particular\nindividual or require a response from a particular\nindividual before the verification occurs? You see, that\n-- that seems to me the difference here, that you're\nsaying the commission, within 10 days after receiving this\nunverified complaint, has to submit it to the employer and\nask the employer to respond to it.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: No. The -- under the procedure\nestablished by title VII, the employer is not required to\nrespond just by virtue of getting notice. Notice simply\nalerts them to the filing of the charge. It is a separate\nstep in the procedure for the agency to then require the\nemployer to do anything in response. It's not like a\ncomplaint which requires an answer within so many days.\nQUESTION: Okay. I see.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: It's simply a heads-up.\nQUESTION: Now, does the agency require\nverification to occur before it will demand a response\nfrom the employer?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: I think that would be the normal\npractice.\nQUESTION: Isn't that what -- the form --\nQUESTION: That makes me feel --\nQUESTION: -- that EEOC sends out, as you've\ndescribed the procedure? It's called form 5, or whatever\nit is -- that they send to the complainant says sign,\nverify. It has everything to make the complaint perfect.\nAnd that's the form that is then sent to the employer. In\nthis very case, that form was sent to the employer, but\nthe imperfect form wasn't.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: That's -- that's what occurred\nhere. But I'm thinking -- if I didn't make it clear in\nresponse to Justice Scalia's question, it's my\nunderstanding that the normal practice of the agency would\nbe not to require the employer to do anything until a\ndefect in form, such as a lack of verification, had been\n-- had been addressed. The statute simply gives the\nemployer a heads-up, but doesn't -- the notice simply\ngives him -- doesn't require the employer to do anything.\nIt's not like a complaint.\nQUESTION: But -- but meanwhile the -- the -- I\nmean, this -- this could occur a very long time after the\nevent occurred --\nMR. SCHNAPPER: I think --\nQUESTION: -- so long as the commission waits\nthat long to get the verification. Right?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: I think not in practice. My\nunderstanding is that in practice the commission will ask\nfor a verification. In fact, frequently they will ask for\na form 5 regardless of whether what's in the -- the\ncorrespondence that reached them. So, all problems get\nsolved.\nIf you had an employee who refused to verify\nwith reasonable promptness, I think the agency would\nundoubtedly dismiss the -- the charge for lack of\ncooperation, and that would be the end of it.\nWith the Court's leave, I'd like to reserve the\nbalance of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Schnapper.\nMs. Blatt, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMS. BLATT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nUnder the longstanding rule at common law, the\nfailure to verify a complaint, as required by statute, may\nbe cured by an amendment that relates back to a timely\nfiled complaint. The commission incorporated that rule by\nregulation in 1966, 2 years after the passage of title\nVII. The contrary rule embraced by the panel would\ninvalidate even the most detailed and well-pled complaint\nthat was timely filed with the commission but did not --\nwas not verified until later.\nThe common law rule ensures that substantive\nrights are not foreclosed when the essential elements of a\ncomplaint are sufficient to vest the court with\njurisdiction.\nQUESTION: But -- but in this case, the -- the\nagency doesn't treat it as a full charge until it's\nverified for purposes of notifying the employer. The\nagency seems to be quite inconsistent.\nMS. BLATT: Well, that's not --\nQUESTION: I mean, you -- you want us to accept\nthis argument as to what a charge is, but then you don't\nwant us to accept it for when the employer has to know\nabout it so the evidence doesn't go stale.\nMS. BLATT: It's not that the -- it's not that\nthe agency is waiting for verification before it gives\nnotice, and if the only thing missing from a charge is\nverification, the agency's procedures require notice\nwithin 10 days. Thus, the -- if a November -- if a charge\ncomes in like the November 14th letter that's not\nverified, the procedures require notice within 10 days.\nThat wasn't done here, Justice Kennedy. The\nagency did not comply with its obligation to provide the\nemployer with notice. But that in no way affects or\nundermines the validity of the relation-back regulation\nwhich doesn't relate to notice. It relates to whether a\ncharge is timely filed even though it is not verified.\nHad --\nQUESTION: Well, but -- shouldn't the two be --\nbe tied together? I mean, it's reasonable to have it\nrelate back so long as there is no prejudice to the -- to\nthe employer from having it relate back. But when you say\nwe're not going to give the employer notice until it's\nlater verified, there is prejudice to the employer.\nEvidence is getting stale and so forth.\nMS. BLATT: But, Justice Scalia, the -- the\nagency's procedures required this employer to have notice,\nwhether or not the November 14th letter was verified, and\nthe employer then can preserve its documents or -- or\nrespond to the charge or do whatever it wants. The --\nQUESTION: You say that that's a separate\nmistake, and whatever prejudice that comes from that the\nemployer is free to raise on remand. Is that it?\nMS. BLATT: Yes. The issue of notice is what\ndrove one of the -- the key issues that drove Judge\nLuttig's concurrence, which would have upheld the\nregulation and the majority's interpretation. Had the\nagency immediately hand-delivered this document to the\nemployer, we'd still be here because the Fourth Circuit\nwould invalidate the charge because it wasn't verified\nuntil day 313.\nQUESTION: But you agree with Mr. Schnapper that\nthe agency just missed, that they should have given -- for\nthe purpose of giving -- giving notice, sent that\nunverified charge to the employer.\nMS. BLATT: Yes, absolutely. It was filed with\nthe agency on receipt, and the -- an employer should have\nbeen notified within 10 days. And that wasn't done until\nlater. And we think the -- this argument would be open on\nremand, what the consequences of the -- of the untimely\nnotice.\nBut the untimely notice is a separate question\nfrom an untimely filing of an otherwise sufficient and\nvalid charge, and this charge was filed within the 300-\nday period because it was received by the agency on\nNovember 14th. And our point is that if the essential\nelements of the charge are sufficient to -- to vest the\ncommission with jurisdiction, the verification could be\nsupplied later.\nAnd the rule at common law, which was well\nestablished in both State and Federal courts by 1964,\napplied to lawyers in a formal pleading practice and\njudicial proceedings, and the commission certainly acted\nreasonably in adopting the same rule where Congress\nanticipated that the charging parties are often\nunrepresented by counsel.\nWe don't think anything in the text of title VII\nforecloses the commission's regulation. Section 706(b)\nstates that a charge must be verified, but it does not\nstate when verification must occur. And section 706(e)\nstates that a charge must be filed within 300 days, but it\ndoesn't state that the charge must be verified at the time\nit is filed.\nQUESTION: What about the argument that (b)\ncomes before (e), so -- and to define what a charge is,\nthe word charge, and then it's given a certain description\nin (b). Then when you get down to (e), it retains that\nsame description.\nMS. BLATT: Well, title VII didn't define the\nword charge as a verified charge. It just said that it\nshall be verified, and certainly those don't -- it's just\nthe kind of ambiguity that would invoke the common law\nrule that the charge -- a later -- a later verification\nmay relate back to the time of filing. So, we don't think\nanything in this text comes close to trumping what -- what\nwould be the common law presumption.\nAnd as Judge Luttig observed, that there's not a\nsingle provision either by its effect or its terms that\nsuggests that there's a limitations provision for\nverification. There's certainly one for filing and\nthere's certainly a 10-day notice period for the employer,\nbut there's not a specific time period when the\nverification must occur. And in the normal course of\nbusiness, the agency will try to obtain a standard form\nwhose signature line contains an affirmation, and so the\nverification requirement will be supplied. And if it's\nnot, the agency will dismiss that charge and cease its\ninvestigation. And there's important consequences to that\nbecause the employee will not be able to pursue a claim\nfor relief if he's not complied with the statutory\nrequirement of verification.\nQUESTION: Can you tell me what happens -- it's\nnot this case -- if there's a rule in -- in the circuits\n-- I don't think we passed on it. What happens if there's\na verified complaint? The complaint is filed with the\nEEOC in time. Then the EEOC just sits on it and notifies\nthe employer, say, 100 days late. Does the employer --\nmust he show prejudice in -- in -- before he can defend on\nthe ground of late service? Or how does that work?\nMS. BLATT: We know of just a handful of cases\nwhere the charge just got lost in the system, and the\nconsequences of that would turn on two factors. First,\nwhether the employer could show prejudice in its ability\nto defend the suit, and we think there's a second, a\nconstitutional question of whether the employee's rights\ncould be foreclosed because the agency defaulted on its\nown statutory obligations. This Court's decision in Logan\nv. Zimmerman Brush would suggest that it cannot. But I\ndon't -- you wouldn't even need to get to that issue if\nthe employer didn't show prejudice.\nThis Court in Shell Oil also discussed that the\n-- the courts of appeals had been uniform, that absent bad\nfaith by the agency or prejudice to the employer in\ndefending his ability to defend the suit, that the\nemployee's rights would not be prejudiced.\nIf there are no more questions.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Blatt.\nMr. Bell, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ALEXANDER W. BELL\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. BELL: In the Mohasco case, this Court\ntaught that the EEOC may not adopt regulations that are\ninconsistent with the statutory mandate. As we have held\non prior occasions, its interpretations of the statute\ncannot supersede the language chosen by Congress. And\nthat's exactly what's happened here.\nThe statute in 706(b) says that charges shall be\nin writing and under oath. Next, it's separated by an\nand. The statute goes on and says the statute -- the\ncharge shall include such information and be in such form\nas the EEOC requires.\nWhat the EEOC has done here in its regulation is\nto say that a charge is sufficient so long as it's in\nwriting. That's exactly what the regulation says. The\ntext of the -- of the statute is simply inconsistent with\nthat.\nWhat the argument of the respondent is, is that\nthere's no real linkage between 706(b), the use of the\nterm 706(b), where the charge shall be in writing and\nunder oath, and 706(e), which specifies that charges shall\nbe filed within a certain time period. That's simply not\nso.\nIf you look at the text of 706(e), it says\ncharges under this section, not under this subsection. It\nsays charges under this section shall be filed within a\ncertain period of time.\nSo, we're not dealing with two independent\nstatutes here. We're dealing with two subsections of\nexactly the same section of the same statute that are\njoined at the hip.\nQUESTION: Judge -- Judge Luttig said that that\nwas a very plausible argument. However, he said it was\nnot the only plausible reading of these two discrete\npieces of the same statute, and it was permissible for the\nagency to take the view that it did. To prevail here, you\nhave to show that the position that the agency took was\nimpermissible rather than as Judge Luttig said it is --\nmaybe it's not the best choice, but it was a permissible\nreading of this less than crystalline statute.\nMR. BELL: Justice Ginsburg, we don't believe\nthat that is a permissible reading of the statute. The\nlanguage just doesn't work that way. The first time\nCongress mentioned the term charge, which shall be in\nwriting and under oath, it gave definition to the term.\nJustice Luttig -- Luttig simply didn't carry his analysis\nfar enough. I don't think he mentioned, for example, the\nfact that 706(e) begins with charges under this section\nshall be filed within a certain period of time. There's\nsimply no --\nQUESTION: It seems to me that the reading that\nyou are saying is the only proper reading is somewhat\ninconsistent with this Court's position in Becker against\nMontgomery last term.\nMR. BELL: Justice Ginsburg, we -- we don't\nthink so because we think what happened in Becker was a\nharmonization of two rules of the Court, with a focus\nparticularly on rule 11, which -- in the same rule which\nestablished the requirement of -- of the signing,\nestablished the method to cure a failure to sign. That's\na very important difference here. In this statute,\nthere's absolutely no indication of a -- of a intention on\nthe part of Congress to allow curing the one thing, the\noath and the signing, that they set apart from the\ndelegation to the agency of authority to control, which\nwas the form and content. I mean, just looking at the\nstructure of the language, they -- they emphasized oath.\nThey applied it to commission charges, and they separated\nit from the delegation of the authority to specify the\nform and content. In Becker, again the very thing that\nestablished the requirement for signing established the\nmethod of curing it. That's not true here.\nQUESTION: I think we heard the argument from\nMr. Schnapper and Ms. Blatt that as a background common\nlaw principle, the idea of a curative amendment to provide\na signature, to provide verification that then relates\nback is nothing new. So that what Congress wrote has to\nbe read in the light of that background understanding.\nYes, you must have a verification, but it can come later.\nMR. BELL: Your Honor, I -- I believe that the\nbackground principle, if you will, the background legal\nprinciple of our federalism and the background legal\nprinciple of due process to employers in fairness to\nemployers in giving notice was probably more a part of the\napplicable legal background here -- here than an --\nQUESTION: But that was conceded. The -- the\ncommission should have sent the imperfect charge. The\nemployer doesn't have to answer it till he gets the\nperfected charge. So, the function of notice is served if\nthe EEOC had done what it was supposed to do, and now it\nconcedes that it should have sent that charge. And the\nemployer isn't bothered with having to respond until he\ngets a perfected charge.\nMR. BELL: Well, Your Honor, the -- the\nregulation here eliminates the filing deadline. I mean,\nthere's no time specified when verification must occur,\nand there are cases cited in amicus at page 18 of the\nEqual Employment Advisory Council where charges have never\nbeen verified. I mean, there's just no deadline.\nQUESTION: But that's not what anybody is urging\nhere. They concede that there must be a verification.\nThe question -- as there was in this case.\nMR. BELL: Well, Your Honor, the letter itself\nwas never verified. There was a form 5 that was verified.\nQUESTION: No. The proper -- like an amended\ncomplaint. You know that people file complaints in court\nto get in under the deadline, and then they file an\namended pleading which relates back. That's standard.\nMR. BELL: There's no indication that Congress\nhere adopted common law pleading rules. In fact, the\nlegislative history makes it pretty clear that Congress\nmeant to circumscribe the right that they created in title\nVII rather narrowly.\nQUESTION: Do you question, Mr. Bell, your\nopponents' descriptions of the common law pleading\nbackground that a complaint that was -- was required by\nrule to be verified and filed not verified could be\nverified later?\nMR. BELL: There are certainly many cases that\nhold that. There's no question about that.\nBut -- but here we're dealing with -- with\nCongress creating a right that they struck a careful\nbalance in, and as this Court has said, Congress specified\ncertain procedures as a compromise and that the best\nassurance of administrative fairness is to insist on the\nprocedures that Congress put out.\nQUESTION: Mr. Bell, may I ask, going back to\nJustice Scalia's questions earlier? The statute requires\nthat the charges shall be in writing, under oath or\naffirmation, and shall contain such information and be in\nsuch form as the commission requires. And then later they\nprove it, the date, place, and circumstances of the\npractice and so forth.\nSupposing the -- a charge is filed that's kind\nof a skeleton. It has -- maybe it doesn't really describe\nthe place adequately, and the commission says to him, you\nhave not complied with the requirement giving enough\ninformation. We require an amendment. Would the charge\nbe untimely in your view or would it be -- because it did\nnot contain all the information the commission required,\nand literally the statute requires that.\nMR. BELL: Yes, Your Honor. I don't think the\ncommission has the power to change the statute of\nlimitations.\nQUESTION: So that if they -- if they add a\nrequirement, more information after there's a filing, they\nwould also be deciding that the original charge was -- was\nuntimely.\nMR. BELL: Well, and in this case, Your Honor,\nthat's exactly what they did. I mean, they -- there's no\nquestion that in this case the EEOC did not regard what\nhad been filed as a charge.\nQUESTION: And -- and --\nMR. BELL: They kept writing letters to that\neffect. They kept telling the petitioner, you've got to\nfile, you got to do something.\nQUESTION: You'd also have to say, Mr. Bell,\nthat -- that since the complaint or the charge has to be\nunder the statute in such form as the commission shall\nprescribe, you'd also have to say that if -- if the charge\nwas filed on 9 by 12 paper and the -- and the commission\nhad prescribed 8 and a half by 12, that it's ineffective.\nRight?\nMR. BELL: Yes, Your Honor. I think that's what\nthe statute contemplated. I think --\nQUESTION: Any little -- any little foot fault\nwould --\nMR. BELL: Sorry.\nQUESTION: Any little foot fault would render it\nineffective. I mean, any -- any --\nMR. BELL: I think that -- that --\nQUESTION: -- any little technical detail that\n-- that wasn't exactly as the commission's rules required.\nMR. BELL: If it was required by the commission,\nI think that's what the statute says. Of course, we're\nnot dealing with a technical detail here.\nQUESTION: Mr. Bell, wouldn't that be --\nwouldn't that be totally inconsistent with what Congress\nenvisioned? That is, these complaints with the EEOC were\nnot going to be filed by lawyers, lawyers who have leeway\nto amend under the Federal rules. These are going to be\nfiled by lay people who didn't know anything, maybe not\neven know what the word verification means, and yet you\nthink that Congress erected a structure where that initial\ncomplaint had to be more meticulous than what the Federal\nrules require a lawyer's pleading to say filed in court?\nThat would be very odd.\nMR. BELL: The statute -- the statute seems to\nindicate that with respect to the -- at least with respect\nto the oath and writing requirements. I mean, there's no\n-- if -- if the EEOC can eliminate the oath requirement,\nthey'll be here next year perhaps eliminating the writing\nrequirement.\nQUESTION: It's -- if the question -- here the\nquestion is when not whether. They're not -- they haven't\neliminated it. It's a question as it was in Becker. Yes,\nyou have to sign the notice of appeal, but you don't have\nto do it within the time that the -- the statute of\nlimitations is running.\nMR. BELL: But you do have to do it in the\nmethod and in the time set out in rule 11. There is no\nanalogous provision in this statute.\nQUESTION: What was filed in the court of\nappeals within the time that you had to file the notice\nlacked a signature.\nMR. BELL: Yes.\nQUESTION: And that's the same thing that's here\nwithin the 30 -- 300 days. And then after -- here it was\n313 days. The same thing with the notice of appeal. The\n-- the signature was supplied some days later, but after\nthe time line. So, I frankly don't see the difference in\nthe two.\nMR. BELL: Well, we see a fundamental difference\nbetween this Court harmonizing rules over which this Court\nhas control and the Court deciding whether to apply\nrequirements set out in a statute that Congress used to\ncreate a certain right.\nWhen Congress knew -- when Congress wanted to\nauthorize a gap --\nQUESTION: You're not asserting that our reading\nof our own rules is unreasonable, are you?\nMR. BELL: No, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Well, but if our reading of our rules\nisn't unreasonable and this agency has simply read the\nstatute the way we read our rules, then I assume that this\nagency's reading of the statute is not unreasonable. And\nthat's all that Chevron or whatever has replaced Chevron\nrequires.\nMR. BELL: Your Honor, there are two reasons we\ndon't think Chevron is the correct -- Chevron would uphold\nthis regulation. Number one, there's -- there's no\ndelegation of authority to control the writing and -- and\nthe signing requirement here. That's clearly separated in\nthe statute. When the EEOC wanted to create a gap, it\nknew how to do it, and it did it by saying you have the\nright to specify the form and content of the rule. They\ndidn't do that here.\nSecondly, this isn't a reasonable interpretation\nof -- of the statute itself. It's inconsistent with\nordinary rules of statutory construction. We think it\nreally unravels the statutory scheme. It is -- it\neliminates the time filing requirement -- the timely\nfiling requirement. Under the -- under the regulation,\nthere's simply no deadline for filing a verified\ncomplaint.\nIt -- it undercuts again not only the oath\nrequirement, but the writing requirement. There's simply\nno intellectually honest way to separate an EEOC\nregulation that says an oath is technical and can be fixed\nafter the filing deadline, but a writing is not technical.\nThere's no intellectually honest way to do that. The same\nreasoning that supports the petitioner's argument with\nrespect to oath applies to -- to the writing requirement.\nFinally, we think it undercuts the policy of\nconciliation in the statute because, in fact, the -- the\ntechnical regulation -- the -- the Solicitor General in\nhis brief says -- and this is in the brief in the --\nurging the -- the Court to take cert, pages 16 and 17,\nthat the charges sworn to or affirmed before the employer\nis required to take any action -- we don't think we've\nmisunderstood what the agency's practice is. It's\ncertainly been our experience that you don't get a notice\nof any kind until you get a verified notice. That is the\npractice in -- that -- that was what happened in this\ncase. The -- the Solicitor General, at least in its\nearlier briefs, suggested that that was precisely the\npractice that they followed here. So, we think that\nultimately the regulation also undercuts the policy in the\nstatute for prompt notice to the employer, which again\nundercuts the policy of conciliation that's embodied in\nthe statute.\nQUESTION: Well, the Government -- the\nGovernment has asserted that that's not the case, and if\nthat -- if -- I think we have to accept that unless you\nhave solid evidence to the contrary that -- that in fact\nthey think the notice is normally given and should have\nbeen given when -- here when the -- when the charge was\nreceived --\nMR. BELL: They have said that today.\nQUESTION: -- even imperfect --\nMR. BELL: I -- I -- and I of course saw\ntheir --\nQUESTION: Well, unless you know for sure that\nit's not. And I agree with you that if -- if that is not\nthe policy and if -- if they're being inconsistent in\nviewing it as a charge for one purpose but not as a charge\nfor another purpose, then -- then we have a different\nproblem. But I don't know that we can decide the case on\n-- on the basis of simply your -- your guess that the\njudgment -- that the Government may not be accurate in --\nin what the policy is.\nMR. BELL: Well, again, I -- I refer the Court\nto the Government's brief in support of amicus of -- sorry\n-- of granting the writ, pages 16 and 17. I would also\nurge the Court to look at page 22 of the Government's\nbrief --\nQUESTION: Mr. Bell, a lawyer representing the\nGovernment made a representation before the Court this\nmorning that the EEOC should have immediately sent that\ncharge to the employer. I think we must take that to be\nthe Government's position.\nMR. BELL: That does -- I mean, I'm not arguing\nwith that. I'm just pointing out that that seems\ninconsistent with what the Solicitor General's earlier\nbriefing said in this case. That's the way we read it.\nThat's the way amicus read the Government's own brief. We\ndidn't --\nQUESTION: Well, now it's clarified what its\nposition is.\nMR. BELL: I -- I understand.\nThe -- if there is a -- a hardship created by\napplying the rule, the statute of limitations, it's no\ndifferent from the hardship that always occurs when --\nwhen someone falls outside the statute of limitations.\nAnd this Court's opinion in Zipes exists for a reason, and\nthat's to give relief if someone, for good cause, making\nout a good claim for equitable tolling, does have a basis\nfor -- for arguing that the statute shouldn't be applied\nto him. This Court has ruled that the timely filing of\nthe charge is not jurisdictional and, as a consequence, is\nsubject to equitable tolling. And courts who have --\nwhich have applied this rule as it's written -- I mean --\nsorry -- the statute as it's written have resorted to\nequitable tolling when the circumstances suggested that\nthat was appropriate to do.\nQUESTION: Mr. Bell, this was a deferral case.\nThis was a 300-day case because the State agency.\nMR. BELL: Yes, Justice Ginsburg.\nQUESTION: Do we know whether in this case\nanything had been done at the State agency level?\nMR. BELL: Your Honor, the charge was not sent\nto the State until it was put under oath just like it\nwas --\nQUESTION: Well, that same -- the same formal --\nwhatever they called it -- form X, when it was sent to the\nemployer was also sent to the State agency.\nMR. BELL: That's correct. After the statutory\ndeadline. That was the -- that's the only involvement the\nState agency had in this.\nAnd again, when you fall on the wrong side of a\nstatute of limitations, it's always going to seem harsh to\nyou. But if -- if a limitations is to have any meaning\nwhatsoever, you need to enforce it.\nQUESTION: Is the apparent inconsistency between\nwhat the Government says at page 16 of the brief in\nsupport of granting the petition and its representation\nhere explained by the fact that at page 16 the Government\nsays the complaint must be -- the charge must be verified\nbefore it requires a response --\nMR. BELL: I --\nQUESTION: -- but then there is another\nrequirement for simply notifying the employer that the\ncharge has been made? It seems to me --\nMR. BELL: The -- the only requirement in the\nhandbook that we saw -- I mean, the handbook that was\nfiled -- that we received on Friday does not mention oath\nat all. I mean, we -- we have looked at it and there's no\nmention of oath whatsoever. So, it's -- it's very\ndifficult to know, you know, the role of the oath playing.\nThe handbook also says that the only\ncircumstance where you have to give notice of a charge\nprior to the time that -- that the charge is -- is\nperfected -- I think is the term that they use -- I mean,\nthey -- the -- the regulations talk about perfected\ncharges, charges. They talk about potential charges. I\nmean, they're really all over the map. I mean, they -- in\nterms of establishing a bright line rule, this is just the\nopposite. They establish a fuzzy line rule in -- in their\nregulations. But the only time, Your Honor, that the --\nthey mention giving notice of a charge is if it's within\n15 days of the expiration of the filing deadline. That --\nthat's the only reference I was able to find.\nAnd it's also quite interesting that in --\nQUESTION: I don't understand that. I don't\nunderstand what you said.\nMR. BELL: If --\nQUESTION: They only give notice of the charge\nif the charge is received within 15 days of the --\nMR. BELL: As I read this manual that was just\nserved -- served on us on Friday, that's -- that's exactly\nwhat it says. That's the only circumstance I can see.\nThe --\nQUESTION: Where they will give notice of an\nunperfected charge.\nMR. BELL: Yes. if it's considered a minimally\n-- what they call a minimally sufficient charge.\nQUESTION: They won't give notice unless the\ncharge is received --\nMR. BELL: Right.\nQUESTION: -- right up at the end of a deadline.\nMR. BELL: That -- that is the way I read this\nhandbook.\nI think it's also interesting in looking at the\nhandbook, Your Honor --\nQUESTION: Do you have a section of the handbook\nwhere that's --\nMR. BELL: I think it's -- yes, sir. I think\nit's on -- it's in section 2.1. It looks like on page\n915.001, Your Honor, and it's special procedure, title VII\nand ADA. When it is clear --\nQUESTION: That's not a page. You got to give\nme another page. The page is down the bottom. 2-19, 2-.\nMR. BELL: 2-1 --\nQUESTION: 2-1? Let me try that.\nMR. BELL: -- is what -- what I have. And it\nwould be section 2.2(a)(1). It's what -- what happens\nwhen the EEOC receives a charge by mail. And as I\nunderstand, it's only when it's within 15 days of the\ndeadline that they send notice of the charge to the\nemployer.\nYour Honor, I think it's -- or, Your Honors,\nit's also significant looking at 2.5(a)(3) of this\nhandbook on amending charges, that the agency's own manual\nmentions nothing about amending to add verification.\nNothing. They talk about amending to cure the common law\nsort of problem, Justice Ginsburg, not the -- not the\noath --\nQUESTION: What you have just said suggests that\nthis compliance manual is -- is in need of amendment, but\nthe compliance manual, unlike the regulation that we have,\nis not something that gets Chevron deference. This has\nnot gone through any kind of notice and comment --\nMR. BELL: I understand, and this -- of course,\nthis regulation was not passed with notice and comment\nrulemaking either, which under the Mead decision gives it\nless weight than it might have if -- if the regulation --\nQUESTION: I thought the Congress authorized the\nEEOC to make procedural rules, didn't it?\nMR. BELL: They did.\nQUESTION: And that's what these are. This --\nthe relation-back rule.\nMR. BELL: Your Honor, I suppose we -- lawyers\ncould differ on whether it's a procedural or substantive\nrule. Whether it's procedural or substantive, it changed\nthe -- it changes --\nQUESTION: Well, what would you call rule 15(c)\nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure? 15(c) of the\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure.\nMR. BELL: Yes.\nQUESTION: Is that a rule of procedure? The\nrelation-back rule?\nMR. BELL: Yes, Your Honor, it is.\nQUESTION: Well, I'm not sure that Mead -- does\n-- I don't -- does Mead say that -- that even rules\nadopted without notice and comment are entitled to Chevron\ndeference so long as they were authorized? I mean, I\nthought all rules had to authorized whether they do notice\nand comment or not. What difference does it make whether\nthe statute authorizes the -- the issuance of these\nprocedural rules? You make the point that they weren't\nadopted by notice and comment, which is what Mead says is\nthe only really safe harbor. So, they were authorized. I\nmean, all rules have to be authorized. I mean, that's --\nthat's the starting point, isn't it?\nMR. BELL: Well, and -- and one of the problems\nwith this rule is that there's no delegation of authority\nto the agency to define the term charge, which is, in\nessence, what they've done. And they've defined it as\nsomething other than what -- what Congress has said, which\nis something that's in oath -- under oath and in writing.\nThat's the problem. Again -- and I agree it doesn't make\nany difference what procedure is used if they've -- if\nthey've overstepped the bounds and have interpreted the\nstatute in a way that's inconsistent with what the\nstatutory language requires. That's what we think they've\ndone here.\nAgain, the EEOC itself did not view what was\nfiled as a charge under their own regulations, under --\nunder the statute that it exists. I think that -- that is\nsignificant.\nThe EEOC doesn't need to change the statute in\norder to help claimants. They can follow the statute and\ntell claimants, you need to put your complaint in -- in\nwriting and you need to put it under oath. All we're\ntalking about is a declaration. The EEOC's failure to do\nthat, which apparently they do fail to do, should not be\nlaid at the door of the respondent.\nAnd again, equitable tolling is available under\nZipes anytime an unfair result is reached. And that --\nthat's the way these problems should be solved.\nBut just because equitable tolling is\nappropriate in some cases does not mean this Court should\ngrant the EEOC the right to pass basically a prophylactic\nrule that -- that says --\nQUESTION: But how would you distinguish from\nthe point of view of the claimant who is filing the\noriginal charge, sends a letter, as here, and then the\nEEOC, if it were super-efficient, would have gotten out\nthe form in good time?\nMR. BELL: It did in this case, Your Honor.\nThis man had the form within the 300 days. He's the one\nwho sat on it.\nQUESTION: How many days did he have left?\nMR. BELL: He had it for approximately a month,\nat least 3 weeks.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Bell.\nMr. Schnapper, you have 5 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. SCHNAPPER: Thank you, Your Honor.\nThe compliance manual in this case squarely\nsupports the representation that the Government has made\ntoday with regard to its practice. The relevant provision\nis at the bottom of page 2-1. It is section 2.2(b), and\nit states, when the correspondence contains all the\ninformation necessary to begin investigating -- which is\nclearly true here -- constitutes a clear and timely\nrequest for EEOC to act, and does not express concerns\nabout confidentiality or retaliation, acknowledge the\ncorrespondence by using a form letter, and -- and serve a\ncopy of the document on the respondent.\nNow, the absence of any reference to\nverification is critical. It is simply not a prerequisite\nto this command to agency officials. The manual is\ncrystal clear and entirely consistent with what the\nGovernment has said.\nIn addition, there are cases in which the\nGovernment with the EEOC has indeed served --\nQUESTION: -- manual say about verification,\nlater verification?\nMR. SCHNAPPER: I don't believe the manual\naddresses it. It is not relevant to the commands of the\nmanual as to when service is to --\nQUESTION: Well, one -- one might infer that\nthen that post-filing verification is not authorized.\nMR. SCHNAPPER: It's expressly authorized by the\nregulation in this case. I mean, I don't know that the\nmanual reiterates what's in the regulation. The\nregulation is crystal clear. There's not a dispute here\nas to what -- whether the regulation authorized this --\nthis particular practice.\nThere are, indeed, cases in which the EEOC has\nserved nonverified charges. You'll find examples of that\nin the Philburn and Price cases which are mentioned in the\ncert petition.\nWith regard to the applicability of Chevron, we\nare in agreement with Justice Scalia that the presence or\nabsence of notice and comment rulemaking is not relevant.\nIf that were critical, then Chevron deference wouldn't\napply to most procedural regulations which don't require\nnotice and comment rulemaking. That would surely stand\neverything on its head. Justice O'Connor correctly\npointed out in the Commercial Office Products case that\ndeference to procedural interpretations by an agency are\nparticularly appropriate.\nIn addition, it in fact happened that there was\nnotice and comment rulemaking in this case with regard to\nthese regulations in 1977. The cites to that are in the\namicus brief filed by the EEAC.\nThe question here, as Justice Ginsburg noted, is\nnot whether a charge has to be verified but when. The --\nthe statutory language is not clear. It could reasonably\nhave been read by the agency to require verification prior\nto the applicable deadline. If the agency had written\nthat regulation, it would have properly have to have been\nupheld under Chevron. But the -- the statutory language\nwas ambiguous, and this is precisely the circumstance\nunder which, under Chevron, the resolution of that matter\nshould be left to the agency.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nSchnapper.\n"
