CAMPBELL\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. CAMPBELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nFor 12 years, Mr. Clair's Federal habeas\ncorpus petition was litigated in the Federal district\ncourt in front of the same Federal district court judge.\nHis petition raised 39 challenges to his guilt and\npenalty, and the judge oversaw years of discovery,\npresided over a 2-day evidentiary hearing, and received\nextensive briefing.\nWhen the case was under submission,\nMr. Clair sent a letter to the judge expressing\ndissatisfaction with his team of attorneys from the\nFederal Public Defender's office and requested that they\nbe replaced. The judge asked both sides' counsel for\ntheir position on Clair's complaint. The Federal Public\nDefender responded that, after conferring with their\nclient, Mr. Clair was willing to continue with them for\nthat point.\nThe court then stated it would take no\nfurther action. Three months later, just before the\ncourt was to issue its decision in the case, Clair\ncomplained again. The court issued a written order --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Was there some way\nthat Clair knew that the court was just about to issue\nits decision?\nMR. CAMPBELL: I think, Your Honor, the only\nway you could be sure was the fact that at some point,\nas I understand it, the district court judge had\nannounced the day he would be retiring, which would be\nJune 30th of 2005. So, there's probably an inference\nthere it could be expected that the decision was going\nto be coming out by the end of the -- end of June 2005.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There was a deadline set\nfor all submissions, wasn't there?\nMR. CAMPBELL: There was an initial deadline\nset for the filing of the briefing, post-evidentiary\nhearing briefing, and there would be no extensions of\ntime.\nSubsequently, there was, in fact, another\nsubmission by Mr. Clair in May of 2005 with some\nadditional declarations. The court accepted those\ndeclarations but made it clear it would accept no\nadditional submissions in the case unless it ordered\notherwise, that it would proceed with the decision.\nOnce upon -- anyway, in June, June 16th,\n2005, Mr. Clair sent a second complaint about his\ncounsel again, and the district court issued a written\norder denying that request, finding that Clair's counsel\nwas doing a proper job and did not appear to have a\nconflict of interest.\nThe district court had an excellent factual\nbasis for that conclusion because it had just completed\nwork on its extensive order denying the petition in Mr.\nClair's case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But this petition had\nsomething new, the report that his investigator had\nturned up this evidence.\nMR. CAMPBELL: That's correct, Your Honor.\nThe -- what Mr. Clair's complaint indicated, there was\nsome additional physical evidence that had not been\nexamined or investigated before. He indicated that the\nFederal Public Defender actually had met with the Orange\nCounty law enforcement about the evidence, and he was\nupset that there was no further action being taken by\nthe Federal Public Defender regarding testing, seeking\nDNA testing or testing of that evidence.\nJUSTICE ALITO: There has been some\nadditional litigation regarding this physical evidence\nsince this -- the time of the -- the unsuccessful\nsubstitution request; hasn't there been?\nMR. CAMPBELL: That's correct. After --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Could you tell us what has\nhappened with that?\nMR. CAMPBELL: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE ALITO: I'm sorry. Could you tell\nus what has happened with that litigation?\nMR. CAMPBELL: The status of that\nlitigation: Once the petition was denied, Mr. Clair\nfiled a notice -- there was a notice of appeal filed by\nthe Federal Public Defender. Mr. Clair also filed a\nnotice of appeal because of the denial of his\nsubstitution motion. Those are merged together.\nMr. Clair was appointed new counsel.\nThe new counsel then filed Rule -- a Rule --\na request to the district court to entertain a\nRule 60(b) motion, which the district court denied. The\nNinth Circuit ordered that the district court consider\nthe Rule 60(b) motion. The district court heard the\nRule 60(b) motion and then denied it.\nMr. Clair then filed a protective petition,\na petition for writ of habeas corpus for a successor\npetition, with the Ninth Circuit and has also filed a\npetition for writ of habeas corpus for the California\nSupreme Court.\nJUSTICE ALITO: That's what I was referring\nto.\nMR. CAMPBELL: Yes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And what -- what has\nhappened there? Was there -- was there testing of this\nevidence in connection with that?\nMR. CAMPBELL: There -- there had been --\nthere has been some testing of the evidence during --\nduring that time by the Orange County law enforcement in\nregards to its relationship to the crime or its\nrelationship to another crime that occurred at that\ntime, which I think that information is set forth in the\n-- the appendix to the opposition to the petition for\ncertiorari.\nThe --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. Can you\nremind me of what the outcome of that testing was?\nMR. CAMPBELL: The -- the outcome of the\ntesting is that, to the extent that the testing was done\nto see if the -- there was any DNA matching between the\nother murder that had occurred a couple days before and\nthe murder of Ms. Rodgers -- let's see if I can say this\nsuccinctly. The -- there was -- there was no matching\nof Mr. Clair's DNA with anything from the murder scene\nof the Rodgers murder, and there was no matching of any\nDNA that was found for the perpetrator of the other\nmurder at the site of Ms. Rodgers' murder.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, as I read your\nbriefs, I think you're making, perhaps, two different\narguments. And I want to focus you in on which one\nyou're really concentrating on.\nMR. CAMPBELL: Okay.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Which is this\npresentation seems to be that, regardless of what\nstandard we apply to the court of appeals' review of\nwhat the district court did in denying the motion to\nsubstitute counsel, that it was wrong. And I presume\nthat means it was wrong for the standard you're\nproposing and it was wrong for the interests of justice\nstandard. Am I correct?\nMR. CAMPBELL: I -- yes, Your Honor. I\nthink under any standard that would apply, we think that\nthe -- that the Ninth Circuit's disposition is\nincorrect.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. As I read\nthe Ninth Circuit decision, assuming an interests of\njustice standard because that's the one they invoked,\nthey said what happened here is that the district court\ndidn't hold a hearing to determine itself exactly what\nthe dispute was about. And so, it was a process\nfailure, basically is what they're saying.\nNow, you make assumptions based on matters\nthat have come up since that hearing about what the\ndispute was about, and -- but I still don't know what\nthe Federal defender's position was as to whether or not\ncommunications had broken down with the client to a\npoint where they thought, as they did on appeal, that\nthey couldn't continue.\nSo, tell me why, assuming we accept that an\ninterests of justice standard applies, the circuit court\nhas no power or applied it improperly by saying --\nforget about the remedy -- has no power to say, district\ncourt judges, you have to at minimum inquire and set\nforth your reasons based on the facts of that inquiry.\nMR. CAMPBELL: Yes. And the reason is, is\nthat, looking at the record and what was presented to\nthe Federal district court at the time it received the\nrequest by Mr. Clair in June of 2005, what Mr. Clair's\nallegation was, was that he disagreed with the\ninvestigative, tactical, strategic decisions that were\nbeing made by the Federal Public Defender. That's --\nthat was the reason that was in Mr. Clair's -- Mr.\nClair's allegations. Those premises, even --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But what does that have\nto do with \"I think they're doing a good job\"? I mean,\nit could well be that the judge later decides, after he\nhears from the Federal defender, I don't think that --\nwe don't think there's anything to be done; he\ndisagrees. But he really never got an explanation from\nthe Federal defenders.\nMR. CAMPBELL: I'm sorry. I didn't --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: He never got an\nexplanation from the Federal defenders.\nMR. CAMPBELL: Your Honor, it in fact -- it\nwould be -- it's appropriate -- if the record -- if the\nallegations of the -- of the Petitioner and the record\nbefore the court is sufficient for the court to make the\nfinding that there is in fact no basis for substitution,\nit is not necessary for the court to go ahead and\nconduct an inquiry or a hearing or to initiate other\nfurther process in the case. And the allegation here\nwhich went to the physical evidence in the case from the\nstandpoint of the evidence in this case and the way this\ncase was prosecuted and the evidence of Mr. Clair's\nguilt, the fact that there was additional physical\nevidence that might be available simply wouldn't have\nsupported any cognizable claims in the Federal habeas\ncorpus action. There was no need for any further\ninvestigation or inquiry on the part of the court based\non what was presented to it at the time.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What about a -- a possible\nBrady claim? Is there a disagreement about whether this\nphysical evidence could have been tested at the time and\nrevealed anything at the time of the trial?\nMR. CAMPBELL: There I have to -- I think I\nhave to take what the Ninth Circuit says in its opinion\nabout this case, which is what we have here is physical\nevidence that could be subject to forensic testing now\nthat was not available in 1987. So, the fact that there\nmight be later -- there might have been developments in\nforensic techniques since 1987 when Mr. Clair's trial\noccurred doesn't support any claim of trial error back\nin 1987. You can't show any prejudice from any -- from\nany failure back in 1987 because the testing wasn't\navailable to do that they now want to do.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What about an actual\ninnocence claim?\nMR. CAMPBELL: Well, an actual innocence\nclaim, I think to begin with, it wouldn't be clear,\nbased on this Court's jurisprudence at the time, that a\nfactual innocence claim would be cognizable in this\nFederal habeas corpus proceeding. It would be a -- this\nCourt has indicated to the -- has never really actually\nheld that that is a cognizable claim. Even if it -- it\ndid, it wouldn't be an exhausted -- it would certainly\nbe an unexhausted claim. California, in fact, does\nentertain that type of claim, does provide a State\navenue for that type of claim.\nThere's plenty of reasons why you would not\nraise that claim at this point, especially at the end of\nthe process in the first Federal habeas corpus petition.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You are familiar with\n3599(e), aren't you?\nMR. CAMPBELL: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Which requires counsel\nto participate in subsequent proceedings.\nMR. CAMPBELL: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Of a certain type and\nlimited.\nIs it your position that if there is a\ncomplete breakdown of communications with an attorney,\npost-habeas decision, that that is inadequate in the\ninterests of justice or otherwise for a court to say\nthat could implicate proceedings after 3599, so I should\nsubstitute now?\nMR. CAMPBELL: Actually, Your Honor, yes, it\nis. At that point, the defendant has, of course,\nalready gone through the trial, the State appeal, and\nthe State habeas process, and it's particularly at the\nState trial and the State appellate process, of course,\nthe standard for substitution of counsel is the\npotential total breakdown of communications,\nirreconcilable conflict, conflict of interest. By the\ntime you've gone through the entire process by which you\nhave gone through the State trial, you've exhausted your\nclaims in State court --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Oh, but you're presuming\nyou're going to win.\nMR. CAMPBELL: Excuse me?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're presuming you're\ngoing to win. I think 3599 applies to situations in\nwhich the habeas petitioner wins a remand or otherwise\nhas something that's going to follow the habeas\ndecision.\nMR. CAMPBELL: Well, Your Honor, the -- the\npoint is, is that by the time you have reached that\njuncture in which the claims have been raised and\nlitigated multiple times in multiple forums, that the\nneed for the type of communication and contact that\noccurs at the trial and State appellate level is not as\nessential or necessary at that juncture.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, suppose -- suppose\nthe public defender had said to the district court what\nit said to the Ninth Circuit, and that is that the\nattorney-client relationship has broken down to such an\nextent that substitution would be appropriate, what\nwasn't asked, but suppose the public defender had given\nthat answer to the district judge. Would the district\njudge still have rightly denied the motion for\nsubstitution?\nMR. CAMPBELL: Yes, he would have,\nespecially given that the case at that point was\ncompletely under submission and simply awaiting for\ndecision. At that point, we're -- there is, in fact, no\nmore litigation to be occurring, the -- whatever the\nproblem with communication is at that point is not going\nto in any way adversely affect the -- the\nrepresentation. The case is over.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: If I understand your answers\nto some of these questions, you are not at all relying\non the fact that the district court had made this\ndecision 2 months earlier. You think that the answer\nwould be the same had the district court not made an\ninquiry 2 months earlier; is that correct?\nMR. CAMPBELL: That -- that is correct. I\nmean, if -- yes. That -- that is an extra fact in this\ncase, but I don't think that's the pivotal fact as far\nas what the district court could have done as far as\nexercising its direction -- its discretion in June when\nit received the complaint from Mr. -- Mr. Clair.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So, when is a district court\nrequired to engage in some kind of inquiry?\nMR. CAMPBELL: Well, when the -- when the\nallegation is made that -- by the petitioner that he\nhas, in fact, been denied what he is entitled to under\n3599, which is the appointment and representation by\ncounsel qualified under that statute.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I -- I was again\nassuming, as Justice Sotomayor was, that if we're in an\ninterest of justice world, if that's the appropriate\nstandard, when is the district -- when does the district\ncourt have to make an inquiry, and what kind of inquiry\ndoes he have to make?\nMR. CAMPBELL: The inquiry -- the inquiry\nwould occur when an allegation was made that, for\nwhatever reason, the counsel does not meet the\nqualifications that are expected to be met, the counsel\nhas an adverse conflict of interest, or counsel has\nbasically reached a point where he is no longer\nrepresenting or acting as an advocate for --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, you're -- I thought\nthat that test was an alternative to the interest of\njustice standard. I'm positing that the interest of\njustice standard applies, and you're giving me back\nthose same three factors. Do you think that that's all\nthe interest of justice standard is about?\nMR. CAMPBELL: I think in the context of the\nFederal habeas corpus action, that is in fact -- in\nwhich there's a statutory right to counsel -- that is in\nfact the interest -- where the interests of justice\nstandard would be. The interests of --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, this is sort of a\nmade-up standard.\nMR. CAMPBELL: No --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can you point to one\ncase in which this standard has been used by any\ndistrict court or court of appeals?\nMR. CAMPBELL: No, I cannot, but --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can you point to any\ninquiry by Congress in which such a test was discussed,\nconsidered in any way?\nMR. CAMPBELL: No, I cannot. But --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Where did you get it\nfrom?\nMR. CAMPBELL: It's actually analogous to\nthe way this Court over the years has divided up the\njurisprudence regarding the Sixth Amendment right to\ncounsel and the dividing line between claims of\nineffective assistance of counsel and claims of denial\nof counsel.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, so, what you're\nsuggesting is in noncapital cases, which are less\nserious, you're going to have a higher bar for a right\nthat the statute gives a judge without any limitation.\nThe capital limitation is that the judge on its own\nmotion or a motion by defendant can substitute.\nMR. CAMPBELL: No, we're not in the context\nof a noncapital habeas. There's never -- there has\nnever been any construction, certainly by this Court, of\nwhat \"interests of justice\" means in the context of\nsubstitution of counsel, of a statutory counsel, in the\ncontext of either capital or noncapital habeas. And\nwhether it's --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, how about a standard\nthat the courts are used to and one that has a basis in\nCongress's choice, like interests of justice?\nMR. CAMPBELL: Well, actually, Your Honor, I\nthink -- I think that we have in fact, to the extent we\nare analogizing to what this Court has long done as far\nas dividing questions of Sixth Amendment claims between\nineffective assistance of counsel and denial of\ncounsel -- we're in fact submitting a concept that is\nactually very familiar to this Court and very similar to\nwhat this Court deals with in many Sixth Amendment\nclaims.\nWe're simply looking at it in the context\nnow of the fact that you've been given, or entitled, a\nstatutory entitlement to be represented by counsel. You\nare entitled to protect that right to the extent to\nvindicate that particular right, which is to be\nappointed that counsel. If you're denied that right,\nthen you, in fact, have a legitimate reason to ask for\nnew counsel, for new counsel to be appointed. The\ninterests of justice standard doesn't have a fixed\nmeaning, really, in any context.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If it doesn't have a fixed\nmeaning. I mean, wouldn't you think -- I suspect the\nanswer is you do think that -- a district judge has a\nlot of power in many, many areas, and in one of those\nareas, some district judge sometime could make a\nhorrendous mistake that really wrecks a case, and in\nsuch a matter, the court of appeals, if it sees a really\nhorrendous error, will probably have the authority to\nsay you went beyond whatever standard applies, at least\nhere, at least -- okay, we agree on that one.\nSo, they use some words, \"effectiveness,\"\nwhatever the words are, \"interest of justice,\" just to\nreflect that fact. I mean, that's what I think what\nhappened. Then your complaint is he didn't abuse his --\nhe didn't really abuse anything; he made a good\ndecision, the district judge. Isn't that what that\ncomes down to?\nMR. CAMPBELL: That is certainly an aspect\nof the complaint, But the -- to us what's very\nimportant --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What's important?\nMR. CAMPBELL: What is important here is\nthat the premise of the Ninth Circuit's opinion is that\nit would be an acceptable motion for substitution for\nthe -- for Mr. Clair to complain or allege disagreements\nwith his counsel about --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So, what's\nbothering you is the way they applied it.\nMR. CAMPBELL: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And they applied it in\ncircumstances that you think -- the district judge was\nactually -- his decision was fine. You don't have the\npower to set that aside because it was within -- it's\nwithin the scope of any kind of standard you want to\ncall it, including calling it \"interests of justice.\"\nAm I right in thinking that, that that's really your\nconcern?\nMR. CAMPBELL: Yes, our concern, Your Honor,\nis that the premise of the Ninth Circuit's opinion is --\ngoes to what the appropriate standard, what the\nappropriate level of complaint, whatever you want to\ncall it --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So, what you\nreally want us to do is to look at the record of the\ncase, go through it, and say, here, whatever words\nyou're going to use, the district court acted within his\ndiscretion in saying don't change the counsel. Is that\nwhat you -- is that what I'm supposed to do? I'm trying\nto get at what you want me to do.\nMR. CAMPBELL: That -- yes, that is -- yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, you don't want that.\nYou don't want to stay whatever words you use.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, I'm not --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You want us to say the\nwords to be used are the words that we use in deciding\nwhether you have been accorded your constitutional right\nto counsel, right?\nMR. CAMPBELL: That's -- that's correct,\nYour Honor. I think the confusion here --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I didn't mean literally\n\"whatever words you use.\"\nMR. CAMPBELL: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm trying to figure out\nwhat you want me to do. One is to go back and search\nall the cases that use some words for a standard, which,\nas you can tell, I'm reluctant to think that that's\nmeaningful in this case.\nThe other is to look at the record to see if\nhe acted within what you would normally think of as the\ndistrict court's discretionary authority.\nMR. CAMPBELL: I think the confusion here is\ncaused by the fact that the Ninth Circuit opinion\nstarted out by borrowing the phrase \"interests of\njustice\" and inserting it into a section where it is --\nwhere it was not inserted, and it would appear to be a\ndeliberate act of Congress to do that, and then it gave\nit a meaning which we think under any circumstances\nwould be inappropriate in this context.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose you don't\nthink that the standard of review is abuse of\ndiscretion, because if you do, then I suppose you're\nassuming that the district court has discretion whether\nto grant the motion or not instead of being confined by\na particular standard.\nMR. CAMPBELL: Well, abuse of discretion --\nif the Court is wrong as a matter of law, of course, it\nautomatically -- I mean, that is an abuse of discretion.\nAnd our -- our feeling here about the Ninth\nCircuit's opinion is that the way it has defined what\nwould be appropriate in terms of a motion for a\nsubstitution and what would trigger an inquiry by the\njudge -- you know, as a matter of law the Ninth Circuit\nwas wrong in this case.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but abuse of\ndiscretion doesn't mean that the judge operates in a\nvacuum. If we make -- issue an opinion and say, oh,\nwell, that the standard is an abuse of discretion, that\ndoesn't tell people too much. Abuse of discretion based\non what standards, what inquiries? And that's -- and\nI'd like to know what your position is on that, because\nit seems to me that, at the end of the day, it's going\nto be something very close to interests of justice.\nMR. CAMPBELL: Well, Your Honor, that's --\nand I suppose the substance -- if we want to call it an\ninterests of justice standard, the substance of it would\nbe that it would not be -- substitution would not be --\nit would not be appropriate to move for substitution on\nthe basis of disagreements with counsel about tactical\nor investigative decisions, such as what Mr. Clair did\nhere. The appropriate standard is whether or not there\nhas been an actual denial of counsel as provided under\nsection 3599.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, can I give you\nan example? Beginning of the litigation, all right?\nCapital counsel is appointed. Capital counsel wants to\nraise challenges to the conviction and sentence, and\ndefendant says: I don't -- I want to die. Is a\ndistrict court entitled to substitute that counsel under\nyour theory? Because you said to me it has to be\ncounsel that's -- that counsel that has abandoned the\nclient. Counsel doesn't want to abandon the client;\ncounsel wants to prosecute the case. There's no\nconflict of interest. Counsel's not representing\nanybody else. And what was your third criteria?\nMR. CAMPBELL: Qualifications, just the\nbasic standard of qualification.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, this is -- you\nknow, this is Seth Waxman sitting right next to you.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. CAMPBELL: He's undoubtedly qualified,\nYour Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- I suspect that's\nthe case.\nMR. CAMPBELL: Otherwise he wouldn't have\nthe appointment.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, beginning of the\ncase, first decision, and defendant comes in and says\nsubstitute my attorney. What would be your argument\nunder your test?\nMR. CAMPBELL: There are several responses\nto that. At one level, the client would -- always has a\n-- and I think always has basic -- basic decisionmaking\nauthority over basic decisions, whether or not a\npetition should be filed or not filed, this type of\nthing. So, a failure of an attorney to abide by that\nparticular instruction would in fact be a failure to --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, there are some\ndecisions that -- that the client controls?\nMR. CAMPBELL: There have always been some\nbasic decisions a client makes in any -- in any case.\nBut it's not --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's not abandonment.\nThat's an error. That's a problem. But it's not\nabandonment under your definition.\nMR. CAMPBELL: It is in fact the failure of\nthe lawyer to truly act as an agent for the client at\nthat point.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, if I tell my\nattorney follow these leads, that's a failure of an\nagent as well.\nMR. CAMPBELL: It's -- it's -- actually,\nthough, that is in fact normally always considered to be\nan area that's within the domain of the attorney. Those\ntypes of investigative tactical decisions have always\nbeen the decisions that attorneys have normally made for\ntheir clients and not necessarily under the control of\ntheir clients.\nBut let me tell you about the volunteer\nsituation, as a practical matter. The volunteer\nsituation is a whole -- almost a whole separate category\nof litigation from the kind of litigation we're talking\nabout. And what normally happens in those cases is\ncounsel is not substituted; usually, frequently, a\nsecond counsel is brought in to deal with representing\nthe client on those particular issues, and the first\ncounsel remains. So, that's become --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: A volunteer issue? What\nare you talking about? I'm --\nMR. CAMPBELL: A volunteer issue is when\nsomeone says: I do not want to pursue my remedies; I\nwant to simply be executed. In the practice, we call\nthat a volunteer.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You call that a\nvolunteer --\nMR CAMPBELL: We call that a volunteer.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Volunteer. Volunteering to\nbe executed?\nMR. CAMPBELL: That's -- that's the normal\nterm of art.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Given my example, isn't\nit the case that, under the interests of justice\nstandard, there will be situations in which a\nsubstitution like the one I just posited would be right\nthat wouldn't be right under your standard?\nMR. CAMPBELL: Your Honor, I think that\nactually our standard would cover what is appropriate\nfor protecting the defendant's statutory right to\ncounsel and that --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you suggesting that,\nfor noncapital defendants, Congress chose to give them\nmore rather than less?\nMR. CAMPBELL: No, not -- not at all. I\ndon't think -- I don't think noncapital or capital\nhabeas petitioners have any greater -- have any greater\nright to the assistance of counsel.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you're saying\ncapital have lesser rights.\nMR. CAMPBELL: I think -- my guess -- I\ndon't think -- I don't think this Court has ever drawn a\ncategorical difference between them in terms of what\nrights are available to them for purposes of\nrepresentation by counsel.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn't delay one of the\nfactors that courts routinely look at under the\ninterests of justice standard?\nMR. CAMPBELL: Yes. And I -- you know, once\n-- any motion for substitution, no matter what standard\nyou use, should be -- should be made promptly. So\nshould --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, we go back to\nJustice Breyer's point that, even under the interests of\njustice standard, you're claiming there was an error?\nMR. CAMPBELL: Absolutely. Oh, yes. Yes.\nWe would submit even under that standard it would be an\nerror.\nYour Honor, unless there's any more\nquestions --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Waxman.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. WAXMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe court of appeals held that it was an\nabuse of discretion to deny substitution without making\nany inquiry, even of counsel, into the specific\nsituation alleged by Mr. Clair. The court did not hold\nthat Mr. Clair was entitled to substitute counsel. It\ndid not hold that he was entitled to amend his petition.\nIt did not hold that substitute counsel was even\nrequired or advised to seek --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Is inquiry always --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, what if last\nweek we get notice from Mr. Clair that he is\ndissatisfied with his Supreme Court counsel, that\ncommunication has broken down, that you plan to argue\nparticular -- present particular arguments, and he\ndoesn't want you to do that. Do we have an obligation\nto conduct an inquiry into his complaint?\nMR. WAXMAN: I think if you have any\nobligation whatsoever -- and I want to make clear that\nthere -- these kinds of letters and requests for\nlast-minute substitutions happen all the time, and in\nthe mine run, there may not be any duty of independent\ninquiry. If you had one, it would simply be to do what\nthe court did in March, which is to inquire of the two\ncounsel in the case, is there anything to this, and then\nrule.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. He says -- he\nsays: I've turned up new evidence, or I think this is a\ngreat argument, and my counsel has told me he is not\ngoing to raise it, and I want new counsel who will raise\nthis argument.\nWill we have to say -- look at it and say,\nwell, we have to figure out is that a good argument; is\nit better than the ones counsel are going to raise?\nMR. WAXMAN: No --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Has communication\nbroken down.\nMR. WAXMAN: No, of course not. In this\nsituation, the Court had pending before it a first\npetition for habeas corpus that alleged both ineffective\nassistance of counsel at trial and specific Brady\nviolations. And, by the way, in answer to your first\nquestion, the district judge announced that he was\nretiring on June 27th, effective the 30th.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I want to --\nMR. WAXMAN: So, this was beforehand.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I want to ask you\nabout that. You mention that no fewer than six times in\nyour brief. What is your point, that the judge altered\nhis disposition of a legal matter before him for his\npersonal convenience?\nMR. WAXMAN: No.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Then what's the\nsignificance of the fact that he was going to retire?\nMR. WAXMAN: The -- the significance of the\nfact that he -- he hadn't announced that he was going to\nretire. The significance of the fact that he did retire\nis only to my mind an explanation for why he failed to\nconduct the minimal inquiry --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, you are\nsaying --\nMR. WAXMAN: -- that he had previously --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, you are saying\nhe violated his judicial oath for his own personal\nconvenience, that he failed to do something that you say\nhe should have done, because he was retiring?\nMR. WAXMAN: I'm not -- he -- the error\nwould have been the same if he had stayed on the bench\nfor another 10 years.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, why do you say\nsix times in your brief that the judge was retiring the\nnext day or retired the next day?\nMR. WAXMAN: Because -- it goes to their\ncomplaints with the remedy in the case. That is,\nthey're faulting that the remedy is not go back and ask\nthis judge to decide whether substitution was\nappropriate.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There was another\njudge.\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There is another\njudge. She's available. I have to say it strikes me,\nfrankly, as argument by innuendo that I think is very\nunjustified.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, I -- I apologize if it\ngave that impression. I don't mean any innuendo in the\ncase. Our proposition is simply this: Prior to\nadjudicating the claims of ineffective assistance of\ncounsel and Brady, when the court receives a letter that\nsays, Your Honor, I'm sorry for writing a second time.\nAs you know, I have always maintained that I'm innocent.\nMy investigator has just discovered physical evidence in\nthe State's files that he believes may clear me. My\ncounsel --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Waxman, what --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm still trying to\nget to the point -- I'm sorry. I'm still trying to get\nto the point of the relevance of the fact that he was\nretiring.\nMR. WAXMAN: It goes to the remedy, and it\ngoes to the fact he --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How does it go --\nhow does it go to the remedy?\nMR. WAXMAN: It -- they are alleging that\nthere was an abuse of discretion not to send it back to\nthe judge to do what he had declined to do. And our\nproposition is, because substitute counsel had been in\nplace for 5 years and because the judge who had\nsuperintended the case for 12 years was no longer there,\nit was appropriate and within the court of appeals'\ndiscretion under 28 U.S.C. 2106 to remand it to the new\njudge, with new counsel, for -- to allow new counsel\nsimply to ask the new judge, who had not heard all of\nthe witnesses or the evidence, to demonstrate why, if\ncounsel thought it was appropriate, to allow him to\namend the petition under Rule 15(a)(2).\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Waxman --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, that would be pretty\nincredible. Maybe that's what's required. Why isn't\nthis is a fair reading of what Judge Taylor did? As of\nApril 29th, as I recall, there was not a problem with\nthe representation. And the decision was made on\nJune the 30th. Now, on June the 16th, that's the time\nwhen Clair sent his letter.\nBy this point, the petition had been pending\nfor a long time before the judge. The judge presumably\nwas approaching the point where he was going to issue\nhis decision. He saw the letter. He could not see any\nway in which the matters that were discussed in the\nletters could lead to a claim that would go anywhere.\nAs to the physical evidence, if it couldn't have been\ntested at the time of trial, there would not have been a\nBrady obligation, and an actual innocence claim here\nwould be quite far-fetched in light of the very\nincriminating statements that -- that Mr. Clair made in\nthe tape-recorded conversation.\nHad he substituted counsel, he would not\nhave been under an obligation, I think, to allow\nsubstituted counsel to amend the petition, which had\nbeen pending for a long period of time. So, he said:\nCounsel is doing a proper job; there doesn't appear to\nbe a conflict of interest; and I'm going to deny this.\nNow, counsel could have been appointed and,\nin fact, was appointed to represent Mr. Clair going\nforward. Why isn't that a fair reading of what he did?\nAnd if so, what need was there for further inquiry?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, this -- it may very well\nbe what was in his thought processes, but we don't know\nthat. And, in any event --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But we know what was in\nhis thought processes, Mr. Waxman, because 14 days later\nhe issued a 60- or 61-page opinion with -- dealing with\n47 different claims, many of which, many of which,\nrelated to actual innocence, which was the -- the\ngravamen of the letter of the complaint on the 16th.\nSo, you -- you can't consider the letter just in\nisolation from the 61-page opinion that's issued 16 days\nlater.\nMR. WAXMAN: Oh, I -- I think that the --\nthat a district judge faced with a request to substitute\ncounsel at this very late stage is appropriately --\nappropriately takes into account everything that has\nhappened, everything that he has allowed to happen,\neverything that defense counsel has -- has done. And he\nis obviously permitted to approach this request with a\nhigh degree of skepticism and a strong --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And you suggest, Mr. Waxman,\nthat he did not have to make an inquiry in every case;\nis that right? You're not saying that.\nMR. WAXMAN: That's right. I mean --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So, what -- when does a\nperson have to make an inquiry?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, of course --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: What in this case required\nan inquiry on the judge's part?\nMR. WAXMAN: I think, you know, if the\ndistrict judge is presented with factually supported\nallegations that appointed counsel has failed to pursue\nnewly discovered evidence that may be germane to an\nissue to be decided, especially where the potential\nimport of that evidence is specifically explicated and\ncorroborated by a willing percipient witness, in this\ncase the investigator who viewed it, the district judge\nhas an obligation simply to ask counsel for the State\nand counsel for the defense, please respond, as the\njudge did in June -- in March.\nNow, in March, the judge -- the judge asked\nfor a response --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I guess this goes back\nto Justice Alito's question, but suppose the judge says\nto himself, even if the response comes in, yes,\nrelations are terrible because the client wants the\nlawyers to -- to investigate a particular thing and the\nlawyers don't want to investigate that thing. The judge\nknows it doesn't make a difference either way, because\nhe is ready to issue his opinion, and further\ninvestigation of this evidence is not going to change\nhis mind as to any material issue. Why should the judge\nnot reject the motion?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, because the judge could\nnot know that based on the allegations in the Ford\nletter and the Clair letter.\nIt is not the case, going to Justice Alito's\npoint from my question to my friend, that what was\nrepresented in that letter, the new physical evidence\nrelated only to DNA testing. There was a specific\nallegation that there were fingerprints located at the\nscene of the crime that previously had been represented\nto the trial court and to defense counsel either to be\nunusable or on materials that had gone through the U.S.\nmail so that the probative value would be limited. And\nboth of those things were untrue.\nAnd Mr. Ford said to the judge: I'm\nprepared to explain to you exactly what those prints\nare, and they have not been tested against anyone,\nincluding the other people who were suspected of the\nidentical type murder the night before in the same area\nor other potential suspects in this case like Mr.\nHenriksen.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The Ninth Circuit -- I\nsee -- I think I see what they were trying to get at.\nThey want -- they don't see anything practical here to\ndo except to try to get the judge, the district judge,\nto focus on the question of whether the petition should\nbe amended to assert this kind of claim about the new\nphysical evidence; is that right?\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes. They were --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's where they're trying\nto go. Okay. Now, suppose you lose this case. Suppose\nyou -- they were to say -- suppose this Court said,\nwell, to tell you the truth, that district judge was\noperating within his authority in saying that this\ncounsel can continue to represent him. But we know\nsubsequently relations broke down, and now there is a\nnew counsel. All right?\nCan't the new counsel go back to the\ndistrict court and say, Judge, we'd like to amend the\npetition so that you will consider, you know, whether it\nshould be amended to include this physical evidence\nclaim? Couldn't he do that?\nMR. WAXMAN: He can't ask to -- to amend a\npetition in a case in which there's a final judgment.\nHe could file a -- he could file a Rule 60(b) motion,\nwhich he did in this case --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And what did --\nMR. WAXMAN: -- and face the very --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And the judge -- I think\nyou answered this, but I can't remember the answer.\nWhat happened when he filed the 60(b)? Did they amend\nthe petition or did they consider the thing or not?\nMR. WAXMAN: No. While the appeal was\npending, so that he wouldn't be accused of having simply\nsat on his rights while the Ninth Circuit was deciding,\nhe filed a Rule 60 -- he filed for leave to file a Rule\n60(b) motion and said in essence: Look, the\ninvestigator has discovered this new evidence. I\nhaven't been able to test it or examine it. Please give\nme leave to do that, because I believe it may support\nreopening the judgment.\nThe district judge said: I'm not going to\nallow you to make that motion.\nThe Ninth Circuit issued a mandamus\ndirecting the district judge to rule on the motion. She\nthen denied it, essentially finding that the motion\nshould be denied because Mr. Grele, substitute counsel,\nhadn't already proven to her what it is that he was\nseeking to find out; that is, what does this evidence\nshow. And --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, there's no -- in other\nwords, what the Ninth Circuit in my view is trying to do\nis they've worked out some complicated way of trying to\nget the district court to consider the motion about the\nnew physical evidence.\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes, I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And if that -- if that's\nright, then unless you -- there's no way to get there.\nI don't see how you get there under the law. And so,\nthat's my --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But what do you think? I'd\njust like to know what he's --\nMR. WAXMAN: I have an answer to your\nquestion, but, of course, I'll defer to any superseding\nquestions from --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It has to go with the\nscope of the remedy that they did.\nMR. WAXMAN: Uh-huh.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Assuming, as I do and\nyou just said, that what the Ninth Circuit said is\nthere's -- he should have gotten a reason, an\nexplanation, but now there's a new attorney anyway, so,\nwhat do we do, isn't the normal thing to do just to\nremand it, to let the district court decide what steps\nit wants to take, including to decide whether or not it\nwould have granted the motion for substitution if it had\nheard the explanation?\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Meaning, there was a new\njudge, but that doesn't -- a new judge is never stopped\nfrom considering --\nMR. WAXMAN: No, of course --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- what has happened in\na case and to decide whether under the facts as they\nexisted at the time --\nMR. WAXMAN: Of course not. I mean, even\nthe State acknowledges that asking the judge whether or\nnot there should be substitution when there has been\nsubstituted counsel since the appeal was taken is, as\nthey call it, an academic exercise. But, technically,\nthe judge --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But it's not academic.\nIt wasn't academic for the judge below, the new judge --\nMR. WAXMAN: Well --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- to say what happened\nback then; I don't believe the motion was timely; I\ndon't believe that you were foreclosed from doing other\nthings; motion to substitute would have been denied --\nMR. WAXMAN: Right. I guess --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- end of case.\nMR. WAXMAN: I guess -- I'm not sure there's\na huge difference between that and what the Ninth\nCircuit did or what I understand the Ninth Circuit to be\ndoing, which was to issue an order -- basically say the\nsubstitution motion had to be decided within the broad\ndiscretion that the law allows before entry of judgment.\nI'm going -- we're going to do as best we can to put Mr.\nClair back in that position. It seems to us that since\nhe -- since counsel said, represented, as soon as it was\nasked after his letter, there's an irreconcilable\nbreakdown and substitution is advised --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I --\nMR. WAXMAN: -- he has counsel and -- I'm\nsorry.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. I'm trying to\nhelp you. I understood you to say you had an answer to\nJustice Breyer's question.\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes, I do have an answer to\nJustice Breyer's question, if I can just -- thank you.\nIf I can just finish answering -- I apologize for my\nlengthy answers.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why don't you finish\nyour answer to Justice Sotomayor and then go back to\nJustice Breyer?\nMR. WAXMAN: Thank you.\nIn essence what has happened -- what I\nunderstand the court of appeals to have decided is to\nsay, look, because we have had substitute counsel for 5\nyears and the FPD has said it couldn't continue, we're\nallowing this to go back and let substitute counsel\nconvince the judge, if it can, if it chooses to, whether\nor not to exercise its considerable discretion in\nallowing leave to amend the petition before judgment.\nThe judge may very well say no, and the case is then\nback before us. But it might say yes. In other words,\nto do what in essence is the prejudice or materiality\ninquiry that Judge Taylor would have engaged in if he\nfound that there was a breakdown.\nI mean, if there's a breakdown and the judge\nsays the only new evidence is that the moon was in the\nfifth house and that doesn't depend on anything, I'm\ndenying -- or it was a new moon, I'm denying this.\nJustice Breyer, I -- I agree with you that\nthe Ninth Circuit was struggling to figure out a way to\nmost efficiently resolve the multiple appeals that were\npending in front of them. And they understood from the\nRule 60(b) appeal that was also pending and from the\nappeal on the denial of substitution that there was this\nnewly discovered evidence in the State's files, that the\ninvestigator who looked at it thought that it was really\nimportant; and they had no record about what it was or\nwhether it should have been considered.\nNow, they could have said, well, we're going\nto direct the Rule 60(b) judge to grant leave to examine\nthe physical evidence and analyze it. And it was an\nabuse of discretion of the Rule 60(b) judge not to allow\nMr. Clair at least to make some showing.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But suppose the --\nMR. WAXMAN: But the more straightforward\nway would have been to say you didn't inquire of\ncounsel; counsel may have had a very good reason for not\npursuing this; but in the face of a specific allegation\nby a willing, percipient witness that there is highly\nmaterial evidence in the State's files and the public\ndefender is refusing to do anything about it, all we\nthink the Ninth Circuit was holding is --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought -- Mr.\nWaxman --\nMR. WAXMAN: -- it was an abuse of\ndiscretion not to ask.\nI'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought -- I mean, this\nis a case that has been going on for, what, 12 years in\nthe district court?\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And I thought that the\nbasic disagreement between the client and counsel was\ncounsel said our best shot is going to be to keep you\nalive; so, we want to do everything we can to change the\ndeath sentence, and then -- and we don't want to detract\nfrom that by making a claim of actual innocence when\nthere's -- there'd be a very slim basis for that. So,\nthat's the judgment, and it's a strategic judgment that\ncounsel made: Our best shot to keep this man alive is\nto concentrate on the penalty phase.\nMR. WAXMAN: Justice Ginsburg, if that\nhad -- if the judge had inquired of counsel and counsel\nhad given that reason, that would be something that the\ncourt could evaluate in deciding whether the balancing\ntest that is required by the interests of justice\nstandard satisfied his inquiry. But we don't have\nany -- I doubt very much that that is what counsel would\nhave said.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, if -- the\ninterests of justice, does that include the available\nresources of the Federal Public Defender? I mean, those\noffices are notoriously understaffed. And here you have\na situation where one lawyer has been representing an\nindividual for an awful long time, and the defendant\nsays, I want a new lawyer. It's obviously going to take\nthat -- a new lawyer away from their work and put them\nin a position of having to get up to speed in a new\ncase.\nAnd I just wonder if that's part of this --\nI won't call \"interests of justice\" a standard -- it's\nan aspiration. But does that go into the calculus?\nMR. WAXMAN: I would think that that -- not\nonly that goes into the calculus, but all of the, I\nwould say, well-articulated doctrines that Congress and\nthis Court have applied essentially establishing\npresumptions against reopening long-litigated matters,\nwhether --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that gets to\nmy --\nMR. WAXMAN: All of those things go into the\ninterests of justice balancing. There's no doubt about\nit.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is the -- is the\nperson in a different position with the new counsel than\nhe would have been with the old concerning the standards\nabout reopening things? In other words, do we say,\nwell, what would the old counsel have been able to do\nwith respect to reopening, and say, well, that's all the\nnew counsel can do? In other words, new counsel doesn't\nallow you to circumvent the various --\nMR. WAXMAN: Of course.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- restrictions you\njust talked about.\nMR. WAXMAN: Of course not. The only point\nis what -- what Clair was basically saying is: My\ninvestigator has just found evidence that he believes is\nhighly exculpatory, physical evidence in the State's\nfiles that was previously represented not to exist. My\ncounsel is refusing to do anything about it. Please\ngive me somebody, whether it's -- have my counsel do it\nor some new counsel, to present this to the judge, just\nso the judge can decide --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And one of the\nthings --\nMR. WAXMAN: -- in evaluating these -- the\nBrady and the ineffective assistance claim, and if this\nis as represented, it could be highly material to those\nclaims.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And one of the\nthings I think the district court would do in that\nsituation with the same counsel is say, look, this was a\ntactical strategic decision of the lawyer; you don't get\nto reopen something because of that. Now, does that\nsame consideration apply with respect to the substituted\ncounsel, or does the substituted counsel allow the\ndefendant to get a leg up on the process and make new\narguments that the old counsel couldn't make?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, I think that in a -- if\nsubstitute counsel -- if there is a remand in this case\nand substitute counsel makes a Rule 15 motion, the court\nwill evaluate that under the broad interests of justice\nstandard. I mean, whoever the counsel is has to acquit\nhis or her professional obligations.\nIt may very well have been,\nMr. Chief Justice, that if Judge Taylor had said, look,\nI -- please, you know, write to me in 3 days or let's\nhave a status conference and explain to me what's going\non; I understand you went to see this evidence; why\naren't you -- is it true that you're not pursuing it;\nand if so, why not -- that would have completely\nacquitted the judge's responsibility.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Waxman, the State\ncontends that the interest of justice standard is not\nthe right one. Why do you contend that it is? It\ndoesn't appear in -- in 3599, even though it did appear\nin -- in the previous provision that used to cover these\ncases, which is 3006A(c). You want to carry it over\nfrom 3006A(c) to 3599. That seems to me a little\nstrange when they seemingly intentionally omitted it.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, I don't think it's\nstrange, Justice Scalia, and let me explain at least my\nown reaction to this. 3599, the mandatory appointment\nrequirement, was cleaved from what is now 3006, the\ndiscretionary appointment, where Congress said in the\nControlled Substances Act, look, in death cases, at\ntrial and in habeas, we're not -- we don't want to leave\nit to the court's or the magistrate's discretion whether\nor not to appoint. We are appointing.\nAnd when it did so -- I mean, it is in\nessence a -- a progeny -- I mean, it is -- it is a\ncleaving of what was a discretionary obligation.\nCongress -- Congress had no need in 3599 to reiterate\nthe language in 3006A(c), which itself is not limited to\nappointments under 3006A(c).\nI'm reading from page 95 of the petition\nappendix. The statute says -- I'm sorry. It's page 93.\nThat the interests of justice standard says this -- and\nI'm -- it's the last sentence on page 93a. \"The United\nStates magistrate judge or the court may, in the\ninterests of justice, substitute one appointed counsel\nfor another at any stage of the proceedings.\" It\ndoesn't say \"counsel appointed under the discretionary\nauthority of 3006.\"\nIt, like the rest of subsection (c) of which\nit is a part, is a general rule for duration and\nsubstitution of appointments. So, even if it were not\ntrue that the sentence itself applied a force, it's, I\nthink, only consistent with what Congress's manifest\nintention in enacting -- what became 3599(e) to permit\nthat when substitution is requested, that motion be\nadjudicated in light of the interests of justice.\nAnd, indeed, that's what the State told\nJudge Taylor the standard was in this very case. I\nmean, look at it this way, Justice Scalia: Imagine that\na district court -- I realize that the cases will be few\nand far between, very few and very far between, where at\na late stage of the proceedings, the court will\ninterject substitution of counsel over the State's\nopposition and over the court's understandable desire to\nserve the public interest in efficiently and fairly\nadjudicating motions.\nBut in the rare case where the district\njudge says, gee, I think the public interest -- I think\nthat the interests of justice really would support\nputting somebody else in here, but I can't because it\ndoesn't fit within one of the three boxes of the tests\nthat the State ex nihilo has announced in its merits\nbrief in this Court -- it's just impossible to imagine\nthat Congress would have wanted a judge to say, gee,\nthis is one of these one in a million cases where the\ninterests of justice really requires it, but I can't do\nit.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But the interests of justice\nis such an open-ended test. If that is the test,\ndoesn't it follow that it will only be in the rarest of\ncases that a district judge will have been found -- will\nbe found to have abused his or her discretion in denying\na substitution request?\nWhy does that very broad standard help you\nhere?\nMR. WAXMAN: I mean, we don't -- we're not\nreally arguing about the standard one way or the other.\nThe point -- the only real question in this case is\nwhether whatever the standard is -- and we think it has\nto be something like interests of justice -- a judge in\nthis particular situation with respect to this\nparticular set of circumstances, there is -- and my\ninvestigator, a willing percipient witness, has gone to\nthe police station and found evidence that he believes\nmay well clear me --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, how does the\nfingerprint --\nMR. WAXMAN: -- it requires at a minimum\nthat the judge say --\nJUSTICE ALITO: I know you think there\nshould be inquiry.\nMR. WAXMAN: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But before your time runs\nout, how would the -- how would the fact that there were\nfingerprints at the scene that do not match anybody who\nwas known to be in that house have provided evidence\nfor -- provided the basis for any claim that could have\nestablished Mr. Clair's innocence at this late -- at\nthis late date, in the face of the other evidence that\nwas present in this case, the recorded statements?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, first of all, the other\nevidence in this -- the case against Mr. Clair in\nessence was the wired statement that he made. And even\nthe trial judge in this case said only of that equivocal\nstatement that it was, quote, \"capable of being regarded\nas an admission.\" Now, we don't disagree with that.\nWe're not --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Does your argument depend on\na notion that the evidence against the defendant was\nweak? In other words, if there were a great deal of\nevidence against the defendant, would you be making the\nsame argument, that the judge still had a duty to\ninquire? Or are you asking us essentially to make a\ndetermination that this was an iffy case to begin with?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, I think the answer -- I\nknow how frustrating this is, but I think the answer is\nto both -- is yes to both scenarios, particularly\nbecause there was no physical evidence linking him, and\nreally the State's case boiled down to this pretty\nconfusing statement. It was particularly salient to say\nwait a minute. I mean, the -- the district judge had no\nidea that there was any dispute about physical evidence,\nor any physical evidence was in the State's files that\nhadn't been disclosed and hadn't been tested.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, suppose defense\ncounsel had introduced at trial fingerprint evidence\nshowing that 10 people were present at some point in\nthat house and they weren't people who lived there.\nThat's -- it's weak exculpatory evidence for the\ndefendant at best that there were -- there were unknown\npeople in the house. It might have been the cable guy.\nWho knows who they were? So, it doesn't help very much.\nMR. WAXMAN: Justice Alito, I mean, we're,\nof course, all arguing in a vacuum here because we don't\nknow what the fingerprint evidence, if it were tested\nand run against databases, would show.\nBut let me give you one not at all\nfar-fetched example: The State had -- the county\ncoroner had determined that because of the extraordinary\nsimilarity between the murder of a woman in the\nneighborhood -- very close by the night before and this\none, including the very peculiar puncture injuries, the\ncoroner's report in the State's file said this is very\nlikely the same perpetrator.\nThe State has identified the perpetrator of\nthat other crime. And we don't know whether even at\nthis day the State has matched that perpetrator's\nfingerprints with the fingerprints that were discovered\nnext to the victim in this case. And it wouldn't be\nfar-fetched to say that in a case involving either\nBrady -- may I finish? It will just be this sentence.\nBrady or ineffective assistance of counsel, if the\nfingerprint evidence did link up in that way, it\ncertainly would go into the habeas judge's evaluation of\nthe merits of those claims.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Campbell, you have 3 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WARD A. CAMPBELL\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can you tell us whether\nthat testing has been done or not?\nMR. CAMPBELL: No, I don't believe that\ntesting has been done.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. No, you\ndon't think it has been?\nMR. CAMPBELL: No, I don't. I don't. The\ntesting has not been done. The only testing I'm aware\nof is the testing that's discussed in the appendix.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In the appendix.\nMR. CAMPBELL: Yes. Which excluded Mr. Goh,\nwho apparently was the perpetrator of the -- of the\nother murder, from having any DNA at the scene of the\nRodgers murder. And Mr. Goh is dead now. So --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. Then your\nanswer is yes, Mr. Goh's prints don't match the prints\nfound in the file.\nMR. CAMPBELL: Let me -- I am not aware --\nthe answer is I am not -- there has been no test\ncomparison of the fingerprints of Mr. Goh, to my -- to\nmy knowledge, in with the -- what was found at the\nRodgers murder. The only testing that we have is the\ntesting that is in the appendix to the opposition to\ncert regarding the DNA comparisons that were done.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That doesn't worry your\nprosecutor's office?\nMR. CAMPBELL: I think that the problem that\nthe -- from the standpoint of the prosecutor's office,\nthe -- nothing that could be found about this case would\nundercut the fact that Mr. Clair --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If -- if the\nfingerprints that were found at the scene of this crime\nmatched Goh, that wouldn't give you pause?\nMR. CAMPBELL: It would -- it would\ncertainly be a -- it would certainly -- I think it would\ngive them pause.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. What?\nMR. CAMPBELL: I think -- I think it would\ngive them pause, but the fact is the --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, why hasn't the test\nbeen done?\nMR. CAMPBELL: I don't know why the testing\nhas not been done. But whatever the testing would be,\nthe fact is Mr. Clair made numerous admissions and\nnumerous statements implicating himself in the murder of\nLinda -- of Ms. Rodgers during the taped conversation he\nhad with Ms. Flores, which also corroborated\nMs. Flores's testimony about his involvement in that\nmurder. And that is the critical -- the critical\nevidence in this case. Now, the California Supreme\nCourt, which has had this information in front of it,\nhas also, in fact, denied already a petition based on\nthe available evidence about the murders.\nI think also if you look --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you don't think it's\nan iffy case?\nMR. CAMPBELL: No, not based on that taped\nstatement. The taped statements are filled with implied\n-- implied admissions about what he did with the\njewelry, about trying to evade her questions about the\ncase, to do anything to try to avoid having to really\nconfront himself directly with involvement in the case.\nIt's a -- it really is a very damning -- damning tape,\nbut it --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's all -- it's all\nthat, what -- what he told his girlfriend, right?\nThere's nothing else. It's only that?\nMR. CAMPBELL: Well, I think the point of it\nis that the tape -- she testified, and the tape\ncorroborates her testimony. So, in fact, what you have\nis you -- you have mutual reinforcement.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
