Kristja J. Falvo.\nMr. Richardson.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JERRY A. RICHARDSON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. RICHARDSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe issue presented by this case is whether\nCongress, in enacting the Family Educational Rights and\nPrivacy Act, intended to prohibit the common and\nlongstanding practice of peer grading of routine homework\npapers, quizzes, and tests. Congress did not intend FERPA\nto apply to such routine classroom activities, because\nCongress was concerned only with information that might\nhave a long-term negative impact on a student's academic\nor career opportunities.\nQUESTION: Mr. --\nQUESTION: Did you take the position in the\ncourt of appeals that there is no private contract?\nMR. RICHARDSON: We did not raise that issue in\nthe court of appeals, Your Honor. No, we did not.\nQUESTION: The court of appeals discussed it.\nMR. RICHARDSON: The court of appeals raised it\nsua sponte, and it has been raised in amicus briefs\nsubmitted -- in fact, three amici have discussed it.\nQUESTION: Why didn't you raise the issue? Why\nisn't that more important than what you did raise?\nMR. RICHARDSON: Candidly, Your Honor, we didn't\nraise it for a number of reasons. Number 1, because in\nthe district court there was a Fourteenth Amendment claim\nwhich clearly was actionable under section 1983.\nNumber 2, quite honestly we believe the merits\nargument regarding FERPA was stronger than the section\n1983 argument. Remember --\nQUESTION: Well, I just don't know if it's a\ngood practice for you to force us to reach an issue you\nthink is important if there's no cause of action anyway.\nThat just doesn't seem to me an orderly way to proceed.\nMR. RICHARDSON: Well, in hindsight I would\nagree with the Court that we should have approached it a\ndifferent way. Please recall, however, that at the time\nthis case was filed, at the time the court of -- at the\ntime the district court entered its decision, and at the\ntime the briefs were submitted in the Tenth Circuit, the\nChristiansen decision had not come down. We did not have\nthe benefit -- we were under the impression, I should say,\nthat we -- that the family policy compliance officer's\nletter would be accorded Chevron deference, as the\ndistrict court did.\nWe did not know that the Court was going to\ndecide Christiansen and hold that such opinion letters\nwere not entitled to such deference. We made a tactical\ndecision to focus on the merits rather than focus --\nQUESTION: Well --\nMR. RICHARDSON: -- on the 1983 aspect of it.\nQUESTION: -- you also certainly had some\njustification on the private cause of action. Seeing a\nnumber of decisions from this Court which have come out 5\nto 4 one way and then 5 to 4 the other way --\nMR. RICHARDSON: That's very true, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: -- you're not sure that you're going\nto prevail on that.\nMR. RICHARDSON: That's very true, Your Honor.\nBoth the decisions of this Court, with all due respect,\nare sometimes difficult for a practicing attorney to\ndiscern a clear line of --\nQUESTION: They're hard for us, too.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. RICHARDSON: And the other factor I would\nsay is that the two decisions that the Tenth Circuit cited\nfrom other courts of appeals, the only two decisions that\nwe were aware of from the Second Circuit, the Fay v. South\nColonie School District decision, and from the Fifth\nCircuit, Tarka v. Cunningham, both of those courts of\nappeals had held that FERPA was actionable under 1983, so\nagain, we made a strategic decision --\nQUESTION: Well, what if we think there's a real\nproblem with that notion under this scheme, where the\nwhole object was to have it administratively determined\nand it was funding mechanism, and under the act, the\npenalty for not following it is a cut-off of funding.\nNow, what if we're quite concerned about that.\nMR. RICHARDSON: Oh, I --\nQUESTION: Do we send it back and let it be\nbriefed and argued below?\nMR. RICHARDSON: No, I don't believe so, Your\nHonor. The Tenth Circuit did rule on it, and we not only\nhave -- three amici in support of the petitioners\naddressed it. Respondent herself did address it in her\nbrief. The only party that really hasn't briefed the\nissue is petitioners. We would be the only one that would\nsuffer any prejudice. We have endorsed the position\nargued by the amici in the three briefs that have raised\nthe issue.\nI believe it's perfectly appropriate for the\nCourt to decide that, and I believe that the Court -- that\nthe Court's decisions do indicate that FERPA is not\nactionable under 1983. If you focus on the -- go back and\nlook at the language of the statute, of course, which is\nthe ultimate issue, there is no rights creating language\nin FERPA the way there is, for instance, in title 9, that\nthe Court focused on in Canon.\nAlso, this is a Spending Clause case. There is\nno -- the Spending Clause, as the Court has indicated\nrepeatedly, is in the nature of a contract and there is no\nunambiguous indication here that Congress --\nQUESTION: You didn't raise this in your\npetition for certiorari, though, did you?\nMR. RICHARDSON: We didn't raise it -- no, Your\nHonor, we didn't. We didn't raise it in the petition for\ncertiorari because we had not raised it in the court below\nand, frankly, we believed that the odds of persuading the\nCourt to grant certiorari on an issue that we had not\nraised and briefed below were not very good and, again,\nour focus had always been on the merits of the case, and I\nbelieve we should win on the merits, but I also believe\nthat section 1983 is not -- does not provide a cause of\naction under FERPA.\nFERPA says -- it uses the language, no funds\nshall be available to an educational agency or institution\nthat has a policy or practice of allowing the disclosure\nof education records. That is clearly talking about a\nsystematic practice on the part of an educational agency\nor institution.\nIf a section 1983 remedy were allowed, then what\nabout an individual teacher who, in violation of the\ndistrict's own policy or practice -- the district, say,\nhas a policy that we will not release it, yet an\nindividual teacher makes a deliberate choice to release\nthe information. Under 1983 that teacher would have to be\nheld liable, it would seem to me, even though the district\nhad done exactly what Congress commanded. The district\nhad enacted a policy saying, don't do that, so that\nclearly militates against a 1983 cause of action.\nIn addition, FERPA --\nQUESTION: Do you know anything about how this\nact is enforced on the Federal side? Have there been any\nfund terminations, because the only thing in the statute\nitself is fund termination, isn't that right?\nMR. RICHARDSON: That is correct, Your Honor,\nand I'm not aware of any decisions. There is certainly\nnothing in the record to indicate that there's ever been a\nfunding -- well, I may have overspoken. I do not recall\nfrom the record. There might be something in the lodging\nof those extensive letters from the FPCO, but I do not\nrecall, and do not -- cannot represent to the Court that\nthere's anything in the record regarding there ever having\nbeen a funding cut-off.\nQUESTION: Well, I guess we are taking you away\nfrom the question on which we granted certiorari.\nAs I understand the position of the respondent\nhere, and tell me if I'm incorrect, if the respondent is\ncorrect, the teacher would have to keep a record of all of\nthese quizzes as part of the permanent record, is that the\nnecessary result of the respondent's argument?\nMR. RICHARDSON: The respondent seems to take\nthe position, which is contrary to what the Tenth Circuit\nsaid -- the respondent seems to take the position that\nonly records, only grades or scores that are recorded in\nthe teacher's grade book are education records. The Tenth\nCircuit clearly said that's not the case.\nThe Tenth Circuit clearly said, even if the\ngrade is never recorded in a teacher's grade book, the\nmere fact that the teacher receives it and uses it for\nsome purpose, maybe even just to evaluate her own teaching\nperformance, and determine whether the class is ready to\nmove on to the next lesson, that makes it an education\nrecord.\nRespondents have backed away from that. They\nargue in their brief at least, or she argues in her brief\nat least that it has to be recorded in the teacher's grade\nbook, but we believe that even that is a far more broad\ndefinition of education records than what Congress plainly\nsays in the statute. The statute defines education\nrecords with a two-part definition. It's those records,\nfiles, documents, or other materials that contain\npersonally identifiable information and are maintained by\nan educational agency or institution, or by a person\nacting for an educational agency or institution.\nNow, maintained has to have some substantive\nmeaning, because it's half of the definition. Clearly,\nhomework papers are personally identifiable. There's no\ndoubt about that. But if maintained doesn't mean anything\nmore than what the Tenth Circuit said it meant, simply\npossessed by a teacher for some brief period of time, then\nthat's really writing that word out of the definition.\nAny document that comes across a teacher's desk would be\nan education record.\nIn fact, chalkboard work would have to be an\neducation record. If a teacher asks a student to come to\nthe chalkboard, do a math problem, that's personally\nidentifiable information. The entire class can see this\nstudent working a math problem. That math problem is\nmaintained on the chalkboard until the teacher directs a\nstudent either to erase it, or erases it herself, or\nhimself.\nQUESTION: What's your definition of maintain,\nwhat, a week, a month?\nMR. RICHARDSON: I don't think that --\nQUESTION: Make me an offer. What's your --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. RICHARDSON: Your Honor, I think that what\nCongress is getting at with the word maintained, it goes\nback to what I said in the opening statement, which is,\ninformation that could have a long-term effect on the\nstudent's career. I think Congress was talking about --\nand the legislative history bears this out. I know Your\nHonor is not particularly persuaded by that --\nQUESTION: Some of my colleagues like that\nstuff.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. RICHARDSON: -- by that argument, but\nCongress was concerned about things that would have a\nlong-term effect.\nWhat I would suggest the Court focus on, is this\nthe kind of document that's going to be looked at by a\ncollege admissions officer? Is this the kind of document\nthat's going to be looked at by a potential employer, or a\ngovernmental agency at some point down the road?\nQUESTION: Is there a difference between your\nposition and -- the Government said, it means, educational\nrecords means institutional records.\nMR. RICHARDSON: No.\nQUESTION: The kind that would be in the\nprincipal's office and not in the teacher's drawer.\nMR. RICHARDSON: No. No, Your Honor. Our\nposition and the Government's, with that regard I believe\nthe Government's current position, as reflected in the\nbrief of the United States, are consistent. I don't\nthink --\nQUESTION: It's not been the position that the\nGovernment, that this FPCO has taken consistently, because\nwasn't there -- didn't they say that the teacher's grade\nbook --\nMR. RICHARDSON: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- did count as an educational\nrecord?\nMR. RICHARDSON: Yes. The FPCO had previously\ntaken a much broader interpretation of education records,\nand had taken the position which essentially seems now to\nbe adopted by the respondent, that once the teacher\nmain -- once the teacher receives possession of the grade,\nor the score, it becomes an education record. The United\nStates has disavowed that position and said that is\nclearly more broad than what the -- but the key point --\nQUESTION: But if your definition is correct,\nand it's that limited that it's only the stuff the school\nkeeps that will go on into the permanent record of the\nstudent, what would be the reason for that exception that\nthe statute contains for, you know, personal notes that a\nteacher makes? You wouldn't need that exception. That\nstuff never goes down to the central office, much less is\nkept for, you know, for future reference.\nMR. RICHARDSON: Well, not necessarily, Your\nHonor, and that -- you're referring, I believe, to the\nsole possession notes exception --\nQUESTION: Sole --\nMR. RICHARDSON: -- but that's not limited to\ngrade books. In fact, that --\nQUESTION: Where is it? Can we look at that?\nWhat's the section?\nMR. RICHARDSON: Yes, Your Honor. That's\nsection (a)(4)(B)(i).\nQUESTION: Where is it, in the briefs?\nQUESTION: Appendix page 4 of your brief?\nMR. RICHARDSON: Yes. Yes. I'm sorry. B,\ncapital (B), then small (i), the term education records\ndoes not include -- there's nothing in this definition\nabout grade books.\nThe reference to the grade books, and it's\nreally not a reference to grade books, it's a reference to\nrecord books, is from the legislative history, where the\nCourt -- where the Congress said, this exception was meant\nto apply to things used as memory aids. I would argue\nthat a grade book is not something that is intended as a\nmemory aid.\nQUESTION: But my point is, you wouldn't need\nthat exception.\nMR. RICHARDSON: Well --\nQUESTION: If -- that -- I mean, that exception\nsuggests that other things that are only -- only held in\nthe sole possession of the maker --\nMR. RICHARDSON: I disagree that you would not\nneed that.\nQUESTION: -- could be within the statute. Why\nwould you need that exception?\nMR. RICHARDSON: Well, for instance, a\ndocument -- a counseling record, for instance, perhaps the\nstudent had experienced some emotional problems, or\nsomething --\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. RICHARDSON: -- that has come to the\nattention of a counselor. The counselor writes a\nconfidential memorandum to her permanent file. That is an\ninstitutional record. It's not something that's going to\nbe thrown away, but it's also, as long as the counselor\ndoesn't put that document, that memorandum in the\ninstitution records, or doesn't show it to another person,\nthat's a sole possession notes exception, and would not --\nQUESTION: And you think that's the kind of\nthing that would come within your definition of permanent\nrecords, the kind of things that go on to college\nadmissions offices, and so forth? That's what I thought\nyou were saying.\nMR. RICHARDSON: Well, I think that's --\nQUESTION: But now you're saying, even the\nnotes, personal notes kept by a counselor come -- would\ncome within this statute but for that exception, right?\nMR. RICHARDSON: Well, but for that exception.\nI think that's why the exception is there, is to keep\nmaterials like that from coming into the possession --\nQUESTION: Exactly.\nMR. RICHARDSON: -- because materials like that\nare maintained by an educational agency or institution.\nThey are a -- counselors that have a record of a student\nwith emotional problems --\nQUESTION: So are a teacher's grade books. Why\nin that respect is a teacher's grade book different from\nthe counselor's notes?\nMR. RICHARDSON: I believe because a grade book\nis, in my opinion, Your Honor, more of an evaluation\ninstrument rather than a record. A transcript shows what\nthe student earned in a grade, or in a group of grades\nduring the course of his academic career. A grade book is\nmore than simply a dry record of the percentages that a\nstudent achieved during his time in his class. For\ninstance, during a relevant grading period a student might\nstart out doing very average C work. The student then\nmight near the end of the grading period suddenly get it,\nand start doing B and A work.\nThe teacher would, I think any teacher in\nAmerica would look at a grade book containing those\nrecords and would not simply go, okay, the total average\nfor this grading period is a 78.5, he or she gets a C.\nthe teacher would look at the improvement shown in the\nstudent's performance and would in all likelihood round it\nup and give the student a B. The grade book is an\nevaluation instrument. It is not simply a collection of\nrecords.\nQUESTION: And the counselor's notes aren't?\nThe counselor's notes aren't?\nMR. RICHARDSON: Well, that argument might very\nwell apply to counselor's notes as well.\nQUESTION: I mean, that's the problem. Your\nnotion of what are records maintained just does not square\nwith the existence of that exception. I mean, sometimes\nCongress does more harm than good by putting in an\nexception, because the exception suggests that if it had\nnot been there, the stuff would have been covered. Maybe\nCongress didn't want this stuff to be covered, but --\nMR. RICHARDSON: Well, I think that's an\nalternative possibility, Your Honor, is that it's a belt\nand suspenders approach that Congress never intended grade\nbooks to be covered, but just in case somebody happened to\nbe inclined to read them that way, we're going to put this\nexception in as well.\nQUESTION: We usually don't interpret statutes\nthat way.\nMR. RICHARDSON: Well, I can understand --\nQUESTION: You started out by referring to\nmaintain as implying some significant period.\nMR. RICHARDSON: Yes.\nQUESTION: And it would be consistent with that\nargument that you say, well, a teacher's grade book is\nkept for the year, but it doesn't become normally part of\nthe institutional records of the school, so it's not\nmaintained for a substantial enough period of time to\nqualify, whereas -- and I just don't know factually about\nthis -- maybe the guidance counselor's records are simply\nkept forever. I don't know. I mean, is that kind of a\ndurational criterion something you want to stand on here?\nMR. RICHARDSON: Not in a -- no, not a pure\ndurational criteria. I don't think that is the key.\nAgain, many grade books are not -- I don't think Congress\nmeant to draw a line and say, okay, you keep it 6 months,\nit's maintained, if you keep it 5 months and 3 weeks and 6\ndays it's not maintained. I don't think Congress intended\nto do that, and I'm not asking the Court to do that.\nI think Congress again intended to get at\nrecords that are, as a practical matter, maintained over a\nlong period of time that are institutional records.\nQUESTION: But what is the definition of\nmaintain, then, that you're using?\nMR. RICHARDSON: The definition of maintain that\nI would ask the Court to adopt is its common meaning, to\npreserve, to retain.\nQUESTION: Yes, but don't -- doesn't that force\nus into some kind of a durational -- and I'm not saying\nthis is an objection to your argument, particularly, but I\nmean, doesn't this force us into some kind of a durational\ncriterion? The record of the quiz which student A\ncorrects the student B and calls out to the teacher, the\nnumber that student B puts on top of the quiz is a record\nfor a short period of time.\nMR. RICHARDSON: But it's not the kind --\nQUESTION: I mean, something is recorded, and\nyou're saying, well, sure, they can't be getting at that,\nbut if they're not getting at that, then it's either got\nto be for one of two reasons, either the kid who does the\ncorrection isn't a person who maintains, who makes a\nrecord by definition --\nMR. RICHARDSON: Correct.\nQUESTION: -- or a record is something that has\ngot to be maintained longer than the period that it takes\nfor some kid to call a number out to the teacher, which is\na durational criteria.\nMR. RICHARDSON: That's true, and that's the\nsame reason that a chalkboard, work on a chalkboard would\nnot be maintained in the meaning of FERPA, even though it\nmight be up there not only for a minute or two -- I mean,\nin some college --\nQUESTION: May I ask you --\nMR. RICHARDSON: -- courses you may have\nchalkboard work that's up there for a week or more.\nQUESTION: -- do you concede, or do you not,\nthat the announcement by one student of another student's\ngrades within the classroom and not outside the classroom\nis a release of information within (B)(i)?\nMR. RICHARDSON: No, absolutely not.\nQUESTION: Because?\nMR. RICHARDSON: Because it's not an education\nrecord. You can only have --\nQUESTION: Assuming it was an educational\nrecord, would you say that it's a release when it's\nrevealed by one student to another within the classroom?\nMR. RICHARDSON: No, I don't believe -- in the\ncontext of pure grading, it would make no sense to say\nthat one student, that it's not a release if the student\ngrading the paper records the grade. I mean, in that\ncontext, the Tenth Circuit's analysis would be right.\nIf it is an education record, then the fact that\none student sees it is just as damming as the fact that\nthe entire class sees it, it seems to me, but it's not an\neducation record, therefore there's no question of\nrelease.\nThe other point I would make, going back to the\ngrade book --\nQUESTION: I'm slightly worried about that,\nbecause suppose that -- I take it attendance records are\nalso -- they probably are maintained, and they are\nrecords, aren't they?\nMR. RICHARDSON: Attendance -- well, again I\nwould say that attendance records are not the kind of\ninformation --\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Richardson.\nMr. Kneedler, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act\ndoes not prohibit the common classroom practice of one\nstudent grading another student's paper, or other common\nclassroom and teaching practices. FERPA regulates the\nrecords maintained by an institution, not the homework and\nclasswork of students. Congress did not intend for FERPA\nto intrude into the day-to-day activities of hundreds of\nthousands of classrooms across the Nation, or the way in\nwhich teachers conduct the educational process in those\nclassrooms, or the way in which students interact with\neach other.\nQUESTION: Does the act cover a teacher's grade\nbook that she keeps during the term?\nMR. KNEEDLER: It addresses the grade book, in\nour view, by including it -- we think ordinarily it would\ncome within the sole possession exception in the act.\nNow, I think it's important to recognize that\neven a grade book -- there may be no one uniform practice\nabout the way a grade book is handled. It could be that a\nparticular school would regard the grade book as an\nofficial school record from the outset, where the\nprincipal always has access to it, and the teacher is\nreally maintaining a record on behalf of the institution\nin keeping the grade book.\nYou could have other school systems in which the\ngrade book is essentially used by and for the future as a\nmemory jog, and all that she ever discloses to the front\noffice is the semester grade. In that event, we think\nthat the grade book would fall within the sole possession\nexception, so that this is one of the things about FERPA,\nis that it addresses the situation in which actual record-\nkeeping practices may vary, or let me change that, actual\npedagogical practices may vary widely from school district\nto school district, and that's why we think importantly\nthis act did not enter the classroom by addressing the way\nteachers handle papers, give feedback to students, have\nstudents grade each other's --\nQUESTION: What about posting the results of the\nexam, the big exam, mid-term exam, and the student posts\nthe results on the board.\nMR. KNEEDLER: I think under the position we've\nespoused here, that would not be a violation of the act.\nFPCO has taken the position in the past that it would be.\nI think it would depend, though, or may depend on the way\nin which the grades were assembled.\nI think if the teacher or professor, let's say,\nin college, the only grades probably ever, ever assembled\nor marked down for a college course may be the final exam\ngrade. The professor may have a grade sheet, a roster in\nwhich the professor marks down the grade for everyone in\nthat class and sends it to the registrar, and from that\nlist puts a list of final grades for the course. I think\nat that point, the fact that the grades would be derived\nfrom something that would be regarded as an institutional\nrecord, in that instance I think the posting of the grades\nmay well be a violation.\nQUESTION: But if he posts it before he sends it\non to the administration office --\nMR. KNEEDLER: If it's posted -- and this may\nsound technical, but this is where the two categories we\nthink intersect. If a grade is divulged from the paper,\nhe takes the grade book and puts A or B or C on the paper,\nwe don't think that the student work itself is an\ninstitutional record, and it's not --\nQUESTION: But you're also, I think, saying that\nthe disclosure has got to be of the record, not merely of\ninformation that may ultimately end up in a record?\nMR. KNEEDLER: That's exactly true, and there\nare analogous situations in which that's true, for\ninstance the attorney-client privilege, that the attorney\ncan't disclose something that he's learned from the\nclient, but that doesn't mean that the same information in\nthe possession of the client is privileged.\nQUESTION: How is this -- the more I hear, I --\nthere used to be schools in any case that would say, the\nfollowing 10 percent of the class graduates with honors,\nthe next 40 percent, okay, and sort of honors, and the\nlast 60 percent, well, they graduated, didn't they. I\nmean, they didn't put it quite like that, but it was all\npublic, in the newspaper.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes.\nQUESTION: Now, is that all forbidden now?\nMR. KNEEDLER: No. Quite aside from the issue\nin this case, this statute contains an exception for\nwhat's called directory information, which includes common\ninformation about a student, the fact of their attendance,\net cetera, and that includes honors awarded to a student.\nThat information can be released. The school district or\nhigher education institution has to announce a policy.\nQUESTION: What are we dealing with here? You\ndon't have much time, and I am concerned. Are we dealing,\ndo you think, just with the student grading and the\nknowledge obtained thereby, or are we dealing with the\nteacher's grade book, or both?\nMR. KNEEDLER: All that is strictly presented in\nthis case is the practice of one student grading another's\npaper before the teacher has gotten the papers themselves\nor entered them in the grade book.\nQUESTION: And as to that, what is your succinct\nexplanation of why it's not covered by the statute?\nMR. KNEEDLER: There's no educational record\nmaintained by the school.\nQUESTION: Because it isn't maintained, or\nbecause it isn't a record?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, whether it's maintained is\npart of the definition of educational record. An\neducational record is a record or document containing\ninformation directly related to the student that is\nmaintained by the school and, in our view, maintained in\nthat situation means maintained as an institutional\nrecord, and we think that the act generally draws a\ndistinction between the institutional records and the\nclassroom records of the teacher, and I --\nQUESTION: Mr. Kneedler, do you have a position\non the threshold question? Is there a claim for relief, a\nprivate claim for relief?\nMR. KNEEDLER: We do not have a position on\nthat. That was not presented in the petition and\ntherefore we did not address it in our brief, and under\nthis Court's Air Couriers decision, the existence of a\ncause of action is not jurisdictional and may be assumed.\nWe -- I would point out, though, that the\nability of the Department of Education to cut off funds is\nnot the sort of factor that has in other situations been\nthought to be sufficient to preclude a 1983 cause of\naction. In Blessing v. Freestone and other cases, this\nCourt has said that that is a different sort of remedy and\ndoes not preclude a private right of action.\nQUESTION: Mr. Kneedler, you said it doesn't\ninclude the teacher's classroom records. Why, by reason\nof that exception that we were talking about earlier --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well --\nQUESTION: -- the sole possession exception?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Two different questions. One is\nwhether it covers the student's work, and we think that\nthat --\nQUESTION: Yes, I understand that.\nMR. KNEEDLER: That that's not covered.\nBy teacher's records, if you mean the grade\nbook, yes, we think that that would fall under the -- or,\nwhat we commonly call grade book, some way in which the\nteacher keeps track of the student's progress during the\nmarking period or --\nQUESTION: It's covered by the sole possession\nexception?\nMR. KNEEDLER: That's correct.\nQUESTION: Which means it would have been\nembraced by the statute, but for that.\nMR. KNEEDLER: That's probably true, but it's --\none thing to bear in mind here is, this act was passed in\none form early in 1974. Some difficulties were\nidentified, and it was amended and revised and elaborated\nupon later in 1974, and there is a description by Senators\nPell and Buckley describing the original version of the\nact, in which they indicated that personal records were\nnot the sort of thing that was intended to be included,\nbecause the act then used the definition of official\nrecords that were intended to be for school use, and they\nsaid that these informal notes, and I think teacher notes\nwould be include din that, were not intended to be\nincluded in the act to begin with.\nSo I think that there is a way in which that\ngives emphasis to something that may well have been\nexcluded anyway, but they do fall within the coverage of\nthe act, because the act was revised to meet some concerns\nthat had been raised by local school districts.\nI did want to point out two things in response\nto Justice Kennedy's question. This act does not require\na school district to retain any records. It may destroy\nrecords at any time. It only addresses rights of parents\nwhile the records are actually retained.\nThe other point is, we don't think that there is\nanything talismanic about the duration --\nQUESTION: But they don't have to be retained\nfor 45 days or anything?\nMR. KNEEDLER: If a request is made for them\nthey have to be retained until the request is resolved, a\nrequest to inspect them, but if the parent or student,\nadult student has not requested it, nothing in this act\nrequires the school district to keep them.\nWe don't think that duration is dispositive. We\nthink because the act was designed -- we point this out at\npages 20 and 21 of our brief, and page 23 of our brief --\nwas intended to reach records that the school was going to\nbe -- use to make decisions about the student in an\ninstitutional way, institutional decisions about the\nstudent, which we think are different from what goes on in\nthe classroom in the day-to-day learning experience, and\nso we think that that could include records, or some\nmaterials that are kept by a principal that wouldn't\nnecessarily go into the permanent record, but would be\npart of the school's overall supervision of the student\nfor that school year, so we do not think that the duration\nof the period is dispositive.\nHaving said that, what gave rise to this act was\nconcerns about the sorts of things that were in the\npermanent institutional records of the student, the sorts\nof things that would follow the student, or that law\nenforcement officers or probation officers or others would\nhave free access to when parents did not, and there was\nconcern that there might be irrelevant information, or\ninaccurate or anecdotal information in records that would\nmake a real difference in the child's life, and that's\nwhat this act is directed towards.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nKneedler.\nMr. Wright, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF WILFRED K. WRIGHT, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. WRIGHT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act\nwas drafted by Senator Buckley, also known as the Buckley\nAmendment.\nSenator Buckley in 1974 stated that most\nconscientious teachers would have no problem gaining the\nconsent of a parent, provided the teacher has demonstrated\nthe worth of his proposal. In other words, Senator\nBuckley did intend the Family Educational Rights and\nPrivacy Act to reach out into the record keeping process\nthat included the teacher's work or the -- or the records\nthat were being maintained by the teacher.\nWhat the petitioners are requesting of this\nCourt is to have unfettered and unshackled right to\ndisclose exam grades to whomever they choose. If in fact,\nonly the cumulative or the permanent or the transcript\nrecord is the only record that is an education record,\nthen a teacher like Justice Scalia mentioned could post\nthe exam scores in the local newspaper, if she wanted to,\nprior to handing them in to the central custodian. Such a\nresult was not intended --\nQUESTION: Well, but has that ever happened?\nHad any teacher ever posted exam scores in the local\nnewspaper?\nMR. WRIGHT: Under the facts of this particular\ncase --\nQUESTION: No. I say, was there any -- any\nincident of that sort that had ever been called to the\nattention of Congress? I mean, was that really what\nCongress was trying to prevent?\nMR. WRIGHT: Not that particular action, but\nthat would be a consequence of -- of finding that the\neducation records would be just a permanent --\nQUESTION: Well, it would be -- the consequence\nyou describe would allow a teacher to do something that no\nteacher has ever done.\nMR. WRIGHT: Contrary, Your Honor, I believe\nthat the teachers, not only in this particular case, but\nin many cases, especially in the -- the Krebs v. the\nRutgers University case, were disclosing exam scores --\nQUESTION: They were posting them in newspapers?\nMR. WRIGHT: No. They weren't posting them in\nnewspapers.\nQUESTION: Well, that was what I asked you about\nbecause you mentioned it.\nMR. WRIGHT: That's correct, Your Honor. They\nweren't posting them in newspapers.\nQUESTION: If -- even if we -- we take the --\nthe expansive definition that you would use, what is your\nresponse to the point that came out in -- in my exchange\nwith Mr. Kneedler, that the -- that the mere disclosure of\ninformation, which may ultimately end up in a record, but\na disclosure before that information is, in fact, recorded\nwould not be prohibited by the act?\nMR. WRIGHT: Here we have a situation, the facts\nof this case, that happened simultaneously. The teacher\nis gathering --\nQUESTION: Well, do -- I don't want to cut off\nyour answer there. But as -- as a general proposition --\nit may not apply here, but as a general proposition, do\nyou agree with Mr. Kneedler?\nMR. WRIGHT: If it doesn't make it into the\nteacher's maintenance of the record.\nQUESTION: No. I think the assumption is it may\nwell make it into. It simply hasn't made it into the\nrecord yet. At that point, before it makes it into the\nrecord, is the disclosure a violation of -- of the act?\nMR. WRIGHT: I believe that the teacher is\ndisclosing the information that she is intending to\ncollect. It would be no different than a doctor sitting\nfive patients down in front of them, having them exchange\ntheir diagnostic test, and saying, please call out that\ninformation to me.\nQUESTION: Well, yes --\nMR. WRIGHT: That would not be permitted.\nQUESTION: -- we -- we don't know whether\nthere's a statute that covers that, and we've got a\nstatute here.\nYou're saying that the words of the statute\nwould -- would make it an -- a violation to disclose the\ninformation that may ultimately be recorded, even before\nit is in fact recorded and made part of a record, as you\ndefine record.\nMR. WRIGHT: No. As I define record, here we\nhave a gathering of the information, and that's as far as\nI'm going. And that is, the teacher is gathering the\ninformation. She is collecting it. This whole process is\nsimultaneous. They're having the students call out the\ngrades. Ms. Falvo's children were having to call out the\ngrades without her consent.\nQUESTION: Is the calling out a record? What --\nwhat does the record consist of?\nMR. WRIGHT: That's gathering the information.\nThe teacher writing --\nQUESTION: What -- what is the definition of\nrecord? I mean, it -- does it include --\nMR. WRIGHT: Records, files, documents,\nsomething --\nQUESTION: Something written.\nQUESTION: Yes, but when -- yes, and when the --\nMR. WRIGHT: She's making the record.\nQUESTION: -- when the kid speaks, nothing has\nbeen written yet.\nQUESTION: Records, files, documents, and other\nmaterials. I don't see what there is in this case that\nfalls within that category.\nMR. WRIGHT: The grade.\nQUESTION: The grade is not a record, file,\ndocument, or other material.\nMR. WRIGHT: She's making --\nQUESTION: A. You know, I say, A. The child\nshouts out, A. That is a record?\nMR. WRIGHT: And I write it down as you shout it\nout.\nQUESTION: Oh, after you write it down, maybe\nwhen the teacher writes it down -- at most when the\nteacher writes it down in her grade book, you say it -- it\nthen becomes a record. But she doesn't disclose that\ngrade book. The only thing that's been disclosed is the\nchild's, after he grades that paper, shouting out A. What\n-- what is the record that has been disclosed when the\nchild does that?\nMR. WRIGHT: That is the record that has been\ndisclosed because the teacher is making the record.\nQUESTION: So you're saying the information\nbefore it becomes a -- before it becomes a record, because\nit doesn't become a record until the child says it, and\nthen the teacher writes it down. You're saying the\ninformation even before it becomes a record cannot be\ndisclosed.\nMR. WRIGHT: If she's collecting it, yes.\nQUESTION: Suppose a child --\nQUESTION: Where do you get that from the\nstatute?\nMR. WRIGHT: (B)(i). It would be illogical for\na teacher to have a legal obligation to protect the\nconfidentiality of that grade that she just created in her\ngrade book, yet have the student call out the grade. It\nis no longer --\nQUESTION: It may well be illogical, but I don't\nsee anything in the statute that -- that prohibits it,\nanymore -- you could say it's just as illogical to\nprohibit the teacher from disclosing that information, but\nif somebody else happens to know it, for that person to be\nperfectly free to say, you know, Jack Smith's kid got a D\nin that test. Does that violate the statute? No, of\ncourse, it doesn't because the statute only covers certain\nthings, and what it covers is records. I don't see what\nrecord has been disclosed here.\nMR. WRIGHT: If a teacher has a legal obligation\nto protect the information in the grade book, if the grade\nbook is an education record --\nQUESTION: It isn't in the grade book yet. Your\n-- your objection is the child grades the paper and says\nto the class, says to the teacher, A. What -- what is the\nrecord that is being disclosed then?\nMR. WRIGHT: She's making the record. The facts\nof this case --\nQUESTION: Ah, yes.\nMR. WRIGHT: -- where she's making the record.\nQUESTION: The teacher is making the record\nafter the child says, A.\nMR. WRIGHT: That is true.\nQUESTION: What about a child who -- I remember\nin my third grade, my teacher, who thought it was her job\nto teach, had problems sometimes with discipline. And I\nmight talk too much. I used to.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: And -- and so the teacher would say\nthat's reasoned self-discipline. You lack it. And I'd\nget a check. And you'd get three checks, and you get a\nmark on your report card. All right? And say, Stephen,\nthat's the third time. You now have a mark on your report\ncard.\nAll right. Now, she did that in front of the\nclass because she felt that this is the way I keep my\nclass in order and it helps me teach. She did the same\nthing with her grades, many of them. She did the same\nthing with attendance, by the way. We all said, here,\nhere, sometimes present.\nAll right. In your view, are all those things\nnow forbidden by Senator Buckley's statute that the\nteacher cannot run her class that way?\nMR. WRIGHT: Not all of those items are\nforbidden, Your Honor. The Socratic method is not\nforbidden, Your Honor. Going to the chalkboard is not\nforbidden.\nQUESTION: No, no. Let's use my examples. My\nexample was I act up in class. The teacher says you get a\ncheck for reasoned self-discipline. She says to the whole\nclass -- that's how she keeps order in her class. That\nused to be true in the third grade. My teacher, Miss\nRosmond --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: -- whom I recall with fondness,\ndid --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: All right. But now -- now, what\nabout my example? I'd like an answer to that example.\nMR. WRIGHT: If she's making a record, I would\nsay that would be a disclosure.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMy next question is each morning we came in and\nsaid, present or here, and she'd keep a record. Now, is\nthat also forbidden by this statute, unless you go through\nthe elaborate procedures in the directory section, which I\ndon't know any school that would have done for something\nlike that? But is that, in the absence of that, also\nforbidden?\nMR. WRIGHT: No. That's part of the directory\ninformation.\nQUESTION: No, no. If they don't go through the\nprocedures. In other words, they -- the teacher doesn't\nannounce to every parent, now we want to have a hearing\nfor you to see whether we say to your child, here or not\nhere.\nMR. WRIGHT: Under your --\nQUESTION: That would be a violation in your\nview on the same theory.\nMR. WRIGHT: It'd be a violation, but it's not\nunder the statute.\nQUESTION: Well, all right.\nMy question ultimately then, given our examples,\nis do we really think that Senator Buckley intended to so\ninterfere with the way in which a teacher would run his or\nher classroom --\nMR. WRIGHT: Senator --\nQUESTION: -- for teaching and disciplinary\npurposes.\nQUESTION: And -- and if so, do we think that\nthe Congress agreed with Senator Buckley?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. WRIGHT: That's correct, because in answer\nto -- to Justice Breyer, Senator Buckley specifically\nstated, some may argue that my amendment will create too\nmuch additional work and red tape. To that argument, I\nmust reply that I am no -- not so much concerned about the\nworkload or convenience of the educational bureaucracy.\nHe was not concerned about what type of convenience.\nAnother way --\nQUESTION: So no -- no gold stars on the -- on\nthe paper that goes back to the student that any other\nstudent can see, or in these days, a Post-it with a happy\nface?\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: The Federal Government prohibits\nthat.\nMR. WRIGHT: He's intending to give the parent\nthe right to consent to the release of information. We\nbelieve the grade book is information. Handing back a\npaper, it could be handed back to the child upside down if\nit has a grade on it. There are a hundred ways to skin\nthis cat.\nQUESTION: If I -- if I don't agree with you on\nthis -- and I thought my examples that I gave are extreme\ninstances, and it doesn't cover that. Can you give me any\nhelp at all as to how this statute might be interpreted to\nkeep its basic point, which -- which might be a desirable\none, but not to cover my extreme cases?\nMR. WRIGHT: Senator Buckley said another\nstatement. Simple forms could be mailed to parents to\nobtain their permission for certain activities with regard\nto their children.\nI would also further note that many schools\nalready require the prior written consent of parents on a\nnumber of matters, including testing, special projects,\ndrug programs, sex education, not to mention permission\nslips to go on field trips, permission slips to go play on\nthe football team, permission slips to sell candy.\nParents are bombarded with consent forms. What the\nconsent form does is it informs the parent as to what is\nhappening to their child with respect to their education.\nThe teacher does not have the fundamental right\nto educate the child. Ms. --\nQUESTION: But it gives the individual -- it\ngives the individual parent a veto, and that's what you're\nsaying. You have a school district. Education is one of\nthe -- the areas that is most traditionally handled\nlocally. Right? And your -- your scheme is that any one\nparent in any classroom is going to have a veto over how\nthat classroom operates.\nMR. WRIGHT: Not necessarily, Your Honor. One\nparent has a veto with respect to their one child because\nthey have the fundamental parental right to educate their\nchild. The teacher does not; they do. And that's exactly\nwhat Senator Buckley was -- was intending with the Buckley\nAmendment.\nQUESTION: So the rules -- any parent can make\nthe rules for that parent's child, what that parent wants\nthem to be, not the teacher, not the school district.\nMR. WRIGHT: With respect to --\nQUESTION: You think that's what Senator Buckley\nmeant.\nMR. WRIGHT: Yes, with respect to education\nrecords, that is correct, especially scores on exams.\nWe're dealing with a special ed student here that was\nbeing mainstreamed in the classroom and having his grades\ncalled out loud.\nQUESTION: As long as the teacher records them,\nyou say that. But I think you said all this could go on,\nthe teacher could give a spot quiz and say, I'm not\ncounting it today, but everybody wants to know how\neverybody performed, so we're going to have the grades\ncalled out.\nMR. WRIGHT: That's possibly true, but there are\nother means. Even the district court found --\nQUESTION: But what is the answer to that? Is\nit -- is it -- the teacher gives a quiz, has the grades\ncalled out, but doesn't record in her grade book.\nMR. WRIGHT: If she's not recording it in her\ngrade book, that is not a violation.\nQUESTION: And if she says, class, I want to\ngive you an incentive to do better, so I'm going to write\ndown these grades but I'm going to discount -- at the end\nof the term I'm going to discount the lower two-thirds of\nthem.\nMR. WRIGHT: It's an education record. The fact\nthat the teacher only uses three exam scores that she's\nwritten in her grade book as opposed to five exam scores\ndoes not nullify the parent's right to consent to the\nrelease of that exam grade in the classroom.\nQUESTION: Is it perfectly clear that the\ndisclosure of information within the classroom setting is\na release of education records within the meaning of\n(B)(i)?\nMR. WRIGHT: Within the meaning of (B)(i) --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. WRIGHT: -- our interpretation is it has to\nbe.\nQUESTION: Why do you say that if -- if it has\nthe more formal concern about release to the public and\nlaw enforcement and so forth? It seems to me that there's\nan awful lot of information about special students and\nothers that -- that the student's classmates are\ninevitably going to learn about just by being in class\nseeing what goes on in class. It isn't, though, the --\nhis general performance is a secret to the -- to the other\n-- to his classmates.\nMR. WRIGHT: That -- that's correct, Your Honor.\nIn fact, FERPA is not a panacea for all performances. In\nfact, the directory information exception to the education\nrecord specifically says that participation in school\nactivities is fine.\nQUESTION: But this particular school activity,\nit's not fine. I'm reading off the answers in -- in the\npresence of no one else except your classmates who\ngenerally have a pretty good idea of who the good students\nare and who -- who the bad students are. But you still\nsay that's -- that's clearly a release within the meaning\nof the statute in your view.\nMR. WRIGHT: The grade that's going in the grade\nbook is a release, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: You think it's especially --\nespecially mean with respect to this special -- special ed\nstudent who's being mainstreamed. What -- what do you say\nto the petitioners' footnote in their reply brief that the\nrecord establishes that the only special education service\nPhilip received was 45 minutes of speech therapy once a\nweek? And that was discontinued, with respondent's\nconsent, prior to the end of Philip's seventh grade year.\nThat's not as appealing as your description of this -- of\nthis student.\nMR. WRIGHT: The fact that a special ed --\nQUESTION: Is that -- is that what you mean by a\nspecial ed student, a student who is receiving 45 minutes\nof speech therapy once a -- once a week?\nMR. WRIGHT: Yes. I think that's --\nQUESTION: That's what you mean by a special --\nspecial ed student.\nMR. WRIGHT: He was. He was IEP. He was in an\nIEP program under the IDE Act.\nQUESTION: 45 minutes a week. Did he get\nanything else other than that? Of speech therapy. What\ndid he have? A stutter perhaps?\nMR. WRIGHT: No. He was slow in reading, Your\nHonor. He was slow in reading the exams, the pop quizzes,\nYour Honor. I mean --\nQUESTION: Well, how would speech therapy help\nthat?\nMR. WRIGHT: I don't know, Your Honor. Those\nquestions were not raised. None of those material facts\nwere part of the record.\nQUESTION: Well, I suggest you not paint your\nclient as more sympathetic than he is.\nMR. WRIGHT: I am just trying to be sensitive\nnot only to just that one child, but even to her other\nchildren who are also part of this case with respect to\ntheir A's. They were straight A students. So rather --\nwhether one child receives low grades or whether one child\nreceives stellar performance in the classroom, it does not\nmatter. It is still a release of a grade. Those children\nknow the grade. The parents of those children know the\ngrade.\nWhen a parent goes to the parent-teacher\nconference and she shows up and the teacher says, all\nright, these are the -- we're going to keep this private,\nit's not private information. It's already been\ndisclosed. That information is not private. How can the\nteacher keep concealed that which she already revealed?\nAnd even the district court found that hard to believe.\nAnd -- and that's -- that's the logic of the\nTenth Circuit. The Tenth Circuit didn't prohibit the\npractice. The Tenth Circuit merely suggested that the\nstatute on its face, the plain language of the statute,\nsays, give the parent the right to consent. That was the\nintent of Senator Buckley: give the parent the right to\nconsent to the release.\nQUESTION: If it's an educational record as\ndefined under the act and maintained as such -- and that's\nreally the issue, whether it -- it's covered at this stage\nof a fellow student calling out a grade.\nMR. WRIGHT: It's covered because in the facts\nof this case, the teacher is using that protocol to\ncollect the information.\nQUESTION: Well, but that is not the text of the\nstatute. You have to overcome the fact that the literal\nlanguage wouldn't cover it.\nMR. WRIGHT: The literal language interpreted in\nthe context of the parent's right to consent, in other\nwords, keeping that information confidential. If there is\na legal obligation on the part of the teacher to keep that\ngrade confidential once it's in her hands --\nQUESTION: She had -- they have no right to keep\ninformation confidential. They have a right to keep the\nrecord confidential. If the information is obtained from\nsome source other than the record, the statute does not --\ndoes not address its release.\nMR. WRIGHT: I respectfully disagree. The\nstatute specifically says, which has a policy or practice\nof permitting the release of education records or\npersonally identifiable information contained therein --\nQUESTION: Contained in the records.\nMR. WRIGHT: She's making the record. She's\nmaintaining the record. That has to be interpreted in the\ncontext of what we're doing here. And if we look at\nWhalen v. Roe --\nQUESTION: I'm way out-of-date probably, but\nagain, when I used to be in school, grades were thought\nof, to some degree, as an incentive, that they weren't\ntotally private. One of their functions is they should be\nat least told to other people in the class in order to get\nthem to work harder or to strive harder.\nNow, in -- the term of records, when they talk\nabout records, which I don't think defines itself, is\nthere any indication in this history that that idea that\nif a teacher wants to use grades as a kind of incentive\ndevice, that that should not be up to the teacher? She\nisn't able to do it?\nI mean, is there -- see, records doesn't define\nitself, and I'm looking for a line.\nMR. WRIGHT: Congress intended that --\nQUESTION: In -- in the absence of some other\nline, I might tend to think a line should be drawn to give\nthe teacher maximum freedom to run his or her class the\nway the teacher feels is best educationally. That's\ndifferent from having a record in an office somewhere in\nthe clerk's office in the school. See, that's where --\nthat's where I'm sort of looking for, and I'm trying to\nget some help from you with that.\nMR. WRIGHT: The line is the grade that is going\nin the grade book with respect to this particular case.\nIf the grade is going in the grade book, what she is\ncreating, she is maintaining. If -- if that -- if\nmaintain does not mean that she is making the record or\ncreating the record, if we subscribe to their view that\nmaintain means the central custodian, then the central\ncustodian doesn't have any record either until it's\nactually in their hands. And then we can disclose, we can\naccess, we -- everything.\nQUESTION: So what -- so what if you could?\nSuppose you were to say that. Suppose you were to say\nbefore it becomes part of the permanent records of the\nschool, you can disclose it to other people. You can.\nThat's right. The teacher can tell other students. The\nteacher can tell the parents. The teacher can have a\ndiscussion about it. They can do a lot of those things if\nthe teacher feels that's good educationally and the school\napproves. What would be so terrible about that in terms\nof this statute?\nMR. WRIGHT: It would be terrible. It would be\ndisastrous. Students, parents would not have the right,\nthat privacy. That interest in keeping that information\nprivate would not be there. Everybody would have access\nto that information. In fact, that reads out of the\nstatute (B)(i). You wouldn't have confidentiality.\nEducation records, by its plain language in the\nstatute, means information directly related to the student\nand maintained by the institution or somebody acting on\nbehalf of the institution. And clearly, by the plain\nlanguage of the statute, that includes the teacher. So,\nyes, the teacher grade books -- the teacher grade books\nare education records, subject to the Family Educational\nRights and Privacy Act, the privileges and the obligations\nthat come with this particular statute.\nQUESTION: Mr. Wright, this goes all the way\nthrough, I take it, in your view that -- take a college\nstudent. The college student can say, oh, I don't want to\nparticipate. I don't want anybody else to know what my\ngrade is, and I'm not going to exchange papers with\nanother person.\nMR. WRIGHT: Precisely. We don't engage in this\npractice at college because we would have mutiny at all\ncolleges. They have the capacity as adults, I'm not doing\nthis. I'm out of this class. I don't want people knowing\nwhat my --\nQUESTION: I understand it's a --\nQUESTION: You're out of the college. I mean,\nthat --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: It's a technique that teachers do\nuse, to have students prepare and present each other's\npapers, that that's a technique that's quite common in\ncolleges and professional schools.\nMR. WRIGHT: You're referring to the -- the\nteacher assistant helping them grade?\nQUESTION: No, no. The students critique each\nother's papers.\nMR. WRIGHT: Okay. Student peer critiquing?\nThat is not prohibited by FERPA. The teacher is not\ncollecting that information. The students are making the\nevaluation or assessment of each other for their sole\npurpose, not for the purpose of the teacher recording and\nmaking --\nQUESTION: The teacher writes down -- the\nteacher writes down in the book the comments that the\nstudents made and she takes that into account in the final\ngrade in the course.\nMR. WRIGHT: Outside of the facts of this case,\nthat may be a violation if, in fact, she's making a record\nand that was the intent of the teacher to make a record.\nQUESTION: A -- a good alternate name for this\nstatute would have been the Anti -- the Prevention of\nMutiny Among Students Act?\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Suppose -- suppose that a school\ndistrict received $100 a year in Federal funds, and this\nact were applied in the way you said, would that to you\nraise any serious concerns of federalism?\nMR. WRIGHT: I think the funds need to be\navailable under an applicable program, and I think the\nlower cases have -- have deemed that certain programs are\napplicable and certain others are not. Federal funding\nthrough a State agency would be an applicable program.\nThose facts were never raised in this particular case,\nnever defended by petitioners as to whether or not there\nwas any applicable Federal funding involved in this\nparticular case.\nThe solution to the problem with respect to this\nissue that is before the Court, provide the parent the\nright to consent -- in fact, that's what they're doing in\nmany schools or they're just, like the Tenth Circuit said,\ndo it anonymously or don't do it at all. Have the student\ngrade their own paper. Encourage the parent to come and\n-- and be informed as to what is happening --\nQUESTION: To have the student grade their own\npaper might have some problems with it too.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. WRIGHT: I cross examined the principal with\nrespect to that particular issue, and he said, well, we\nexchange papers because the students cheat. I said, well,\nthe neighbor grading the other neighbor's paper -- they\ndon't have an opportunity to cheat? Oh, yes, you're\nright, Mr. Wright. They do cheat. So that doesn't\npreclude the students from cheating, does it? No. Well,\nno, they could cheat even during the exam because they\ncould write the answers on their hand.\nQUESTION: Well, you need two cheaters for that\nto work, whereas if you grade your own paper, it only\ntakes one. Right?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. WRIGHT: We believe that the plain language\ngoverns what is an educational record and it does not mean\nthe permanent transcript. If Congress had intended for\neducation records to mean a permanent transcript, they\ncould have easily placed language in there that said only\nthe permanent or cumulative record of a child is an\neducation record. They didn't say that. They even\nexcepted out sole possession notes, which are notes of the\nteachers. They excepted out directory information. The\nFamily Policy Compliance Office has consistently over the\nlast 25 years held that the grade book is an education\nrecord.\nA parent would like to access it. Here's the --\nhere's another consequence, that a parent doesn't have a\nright to access if it's merely the permanent education\nrecord of the grades. The teacher could -- could say, no,\nyou can't see your child's grades. A parent has to have\nthat information available to her for the purpose of\nmaking some important decisions with respect to her child,\nand that's exactly what Ms. Falvo went to the school\ndistrict and argued. She argued that those are my\nchildren's grades. Those are between me and the teacher.\nI have a right to consent to their release, and I have a\nright to access.\nQUESTION: Well, but a moment ago, from what you\nsaid, I thought the school district was telling her that\nshe couldn't see her children's grades. That never\nhappened, did it?\nMR. WRIGHT: No, that never happened. But that\nhappened in a particular case that has been cited by the\npetitioners in the State of California where a mom with a\nspecial ed child was having a hearing and needed the\ninformation in the grade book, and they said, no, FERPA\ndoesn't apply. The grades in the grade book -- she had no\nevidence available to her to make an informed decision\nwith respect to whether or not her child belonged --\nQUESTION: But that -- that wasn't what happened\nhere, was it?\nMR. WRIGHT: That isn't what happened here, but\nthat has happened, Your Honor.\nAny further questions? Seeing none, Your Honor,\nwe submit.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Wright.\n"
