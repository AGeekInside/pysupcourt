ELLIS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. ELLIS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nIn 1989, this Court, surveying the already\ngrowing evidence from a variety of sources that the people\nof this country oppose the execution of individuals with\nmental retardation, observed that that growing sentiment\nmight some day be manifested in legislation, particularly\nby the States, which this Court identified as the sort of\nevidence upon which it typically can rely in Eighth\nAmendment cases.\nThe evidence is now clear that the American\npeople in every region of the country have reached a\nconsensus on that question. By every measurement and\nthrough a course of legislative enactments that is\nliterally unprecedented in the field of capital\npunishment --\nQUESTION: What is your definition of a\nconsensus, Mr. Ellis?\nMR. ELLIS: Mr. Chief Justice, the -- I would\ndefine consensus -- and this Court had discussed it in\nvarious terms in the cases, but I would distill from the\ncases in which the Court has described it that it is when\nthe American people have reached a settled judgment based\non a --\nQUESTION: Yes, but I -- that's -- that's a\nperfectly sound phrase, but how do we go about figuring\nout when that occurs? I mean, how many States must be on\na particular side? Does the population make any\ndifference? How about those factors?\nMR. ELLIS: Your Honor, there -- there has never\nbeen a suggestion by this Court that it differentiates\namong States with regard to size, and yet obviously\nlogically if -- if a -- an -- if a collection of statutes\nonly was found in the smallest of the States or the States\nof a single particular region, it would cut against the\nevidence that there was a consensus.\nQUESTION: And -- and how many States out of the\n50 do you need, do you think, for -- for a consensus?\nMR. ELLIS: This Court has never suggested that\nthere's a particular number in response to that. And when\nyou look at the cases, both that have found a consensus\nand that have not, they vary.\nQUESTION: Well, but you're saying there is a\nconsensus. So, you must have some figure that you're\nsubmitting to us.\nMR. ELLIS: I'm -- I'm not submitting on the\nbasis of a figure, Your Honor. I'm suggesting that read\nin their entirety, the Court's cases talking about\nconsensus seem closer to us to be a -- a totality of the\nevidence test but with the requirement that that evidence\nacross the board have found expression unambiguously in\nstatutes.\nQUESTION: Should we not look at legislative\nenactments as the surest indicator of what the view of the\n-- the particular State is?\nMR. ELLIS: Yes, Your Honor, I think that you\nshould, and I took that to be the -- the teaching of this\nCourt's opinion in the first Penry case.\nQUESTION: And looking at that, where do we\nstand today? We have -- how many States have no death\npenalty at all? Is it 12?\nMR. ELLIS: It's roughly 12.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. ELLIS: It in part depends on how Vermont is\ncounted, but -- but it --\nQUESTION: And how many States have now enacted\nlegislation providing that a retarded person may not\nsuffer the death penalty?\nMR. ELLIS: There are now 18 States as compared\nto the 2 that -- that were on the books or were about to\ngo on the books, in the case of Maryland, when this Court\ndecided the Penry case.\nQUESTION: Of course, not -- not all of those 18\nfeel so strongly that it is unconstitutional to execute\nsomeone with reduced mental capacity that they are willing\nto apply that to people who've already been sentenced.\nHow many of those 18 States have adopted that law only\nprospectively?\nMR. ELLIS: A number of them. Again, there's a\ncategorization --\nQUESTION: I think there's quite a few.\nMR. ELLIS: We don't have a precise number.\nQUESTION: And that doesn't -- that doesn't\nbespeak such a -- such a intransigent view that this is\nunconstitutional. I mean, you say, well, you know, we\nwon't do it in the future, but this person has already\nbeen tried and convicted, you know, go ahead. Does that\nsuggest to you that -- that I think it's really\nunconstitutional or just that I think it's a good idea in\nthe future not to do it?\nMR. ELLIS: I guess I would characterize,\nJustice Scalia, the statutes not as having concluded that\nthe practice was unconstitutional, but instead that it was\nunacceptable. But that still leaves your point.\nQUESTION: Well, no, it doesn't. It just says\nit's not desirable. That's all the statute suggests, it\nseems to me. And I -- I thought when you were talking\nabout a consensus, you're talking about a consensus that\nsomething is so -- so terrible that it should not be\npermitted. And these States are permitting it. They're\njust not going to do it in the future.\nMR. ELLIS: I -- I would respectfully suggest\nthat they have not reached that judgment. In the bulk of\nthe States that have prospective only language, that is to\nsay, some kind of bar -- and it varies among the statutes\nto looking backward to cases already decided. In the bulk\nof those cases, it was clear that there was no one with\nmental retardation currently under sentence of death in\nthat State. And so, passing a statute that would\nencompass people on death row in that State would have\nbeen unnecessary in the view of legislators and might\nhave --\nQUESTION: How do we know that? How do we know\nthat?\nMR. ELLIS: The -- the discussion in the -- in\nState legislatures, there isn't legislative history in\nquite the way there is in Congress.\nQUESTION: Pity.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. ELLIS: I was going to say this must be a\nsource of substantial disappointment.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. ELLIS: But -- but what -- what evidence we\nhave comes from recordings of the debates and, in\nparticular, journalistic accounts from -- from those\ndebates. It -- it is clear from those that the -- that\nthe concern of treating differently people who have been\nsentenced to death previously and those who would face a\ncapital trial prospectively was not a principal concern.\nAnd I'm trying to come up with a State in which it was\nknown that there was someone who had mental retardation on\ndeath row. The only State in which I might have reached\nthat conclusion, there had already been a judgment by\nanother court that the individual involved -- it was in\nArkansas -- didn't have mental retardation.\nQUESTION: Mr. Ellis, would you -- would you\nagree -- you know, I'm not -- assuming I agree that --\nthat when there is a -- a new consensus that the\nConstitution means something it didn't mean before the\nConstitution means that new thing, assuming I agree with\nthat, you -- you must agree that -- that we have to be\nvery careful about finding new consensuses, don't you?\nBecause we can't go back.\nI mean, if we find a consensus here that it is\nindeed unconstitutional to execute the mentally retarded\nand then it turns out that there are a lot of problems,\nthat indeed in every case, every capital case, there's\ngoing to be a claim of mental retardation and people come\nto believe that in many of these cases you get expert\nwitnesses -- you can easily get them on -- on both sides\n-- people become dissatisfied with that. We won't be able\nto go back, will we? Because the evidence of the\nconsensus is supposed to be legislation, and once we've\ndecided that you cannot legislate the execution of the\nmentally retarded, there can't be any legislation that\nenables us to go back. So, we better be very careful\nabout the national consensus before we come to such a\njudgment, don't you think?\nMR. ELLIS: I would agree with you, Justice\nScalia, that as the Court has said in various ways in\nseveral of the cases that the -- that the proponents of\nthe view that there is a consensus bear an extraordinarily\nheavy burden of demonstration. But the particular\nconcerns that you raise about the possibility that\nsentiment might especially in the -- in the presence of\nexperience enacting a statute swing the other way, while\ntheoretically possible, is not borne out by the experience\nin the 18 States, but in particular in the States that\nenacted some years ago.\nQUESTION: Well, but Justice Scalia's basic\npremise that it's a one-way ratchet is correct. Is it\nnot?\nMR. ELLIS: This Court has not had -- had\noccasion to address that in particular. The closest, I\nsuppose, that it has come is the Court confronting the\nambiguity with regard to the execution of individuals\nbelow the age of 16 and -- and the presumption that the\nCourt reached in the face of that ambiguity.\nQUESTION: Well, Mr. Ellis, logically it has to\nbe a one-way ratchet. Logically it has to be because a\nconsensus cannot be manifested. States cannot\nconstitutionally pass any laws allowing the execution of\nthe mentally retarded once -- once we agree with you that\nit's unconstitutional. That is the end of it. We will\nnever be able to go back because there will never be any\nlegislation that can reflect a changed consensus.\nQUESTION: Of course, isn't it true that every\nnew constitutional holding is a one-way ratchet in exactly\nthe same way?\nMR. ELLIS: Not only in the area of the Eighth\nAmendment but in others as well. We could all imagine\nways in which dissatisfaction with the ruling might\nmanifest itself --\nQUESTION: Mr. Ellis --\nMR. ELLIS: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- I guess there's no uniform\ndetermination of when someone should be regarded as\nmentally retarded. The standards probably vary somewhat\nfrom State to State, do they not?\nMR. ELLIS: Justice O'Connor, they vary\nremarkably little. The definitions are not framed in\nexactly identical forms because often States have adopted\nthe definition that they employ for disability benefits\npurposes or guardianship purposes or commitment.\nQUESTION: I guess my point is even if this\nCourt were to say that it's unconstitutional to execute a\nperson who's mentally retarded, presumably it would still\nbe open to the State to determine whether that individual\nis mentally retarded under the State's definition, or is\nthere some Federal definition you're asking us to employ?\nMR. ELLIS: It seems to me that the States would\nbe free to define mental retardation -- and, as I say,\nmany use the definition they already have, that their\nclinicians are accustomed to -- so long as the definition\nthey chose carried with it the core principles of the\ndefinition of mental retardation that this Court discussed\nin Penry, that is to say, a measured intelligence in the\nbottom 2 percent -- in the bottom 2-and-a-half percent of\nthe population or 2 standard deviations below the mean,\nplus an impact on the real world functioning of the\nindividual and as --\nQUESTION: Well, this -- this actually links up\nto the consensus problem if you take -- I don't think a\npoll is relevant, but assuming you took a poll and since\nyou execute the retarded, I think most people would have\nin -- in mind an image of mental retardation which doesn't\nreflect the sophistication of the DSM which talks about\nmild retardation and defines somebody who's mildly\nretarded as educable with an IQ of maybe as high as -- in\nthat range of -- of 70 with -- with some -- with some room\nfor statistical error. Do the States have some leeway in\ndefining retardation that's any different than what's in\nthe DSM?\nMR. ELLIS: With regard to -- with regard to\ndetails, as I suggested a moment ago, there -- there is\nroom for some difference, but with regard to the core\nprinciples, which I take to be at the center of -- of your\nquestion, are we describing the same group of people --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. ELLIS: -- what we've discovered in the\nStates is that they've all come to essentially the same\nconclusion, which is all the people who fall within the\nAAMR or DSM-IV-TR definition are the people that they\nchose to protect.\nAnd going to your earlier point about what\npeople know about the level of functioning of individuals\nwith mental retardation -- yes, Your Honor -- there --\nother than parents -- parents I'd put aside -- there is, I\nthink, no group in this country more aware of the variety\namong people with mental retardation and the levels of\nfunctioning at each level than State legislators.\nQUESTION: This -- this goes to the -- where is\nthe burden of proof in a case like -- supposing your view\nis adopted, the State charges capital murder. Is the\nburden of proof on the defendant to show that he's\nretarded?\nMR. ELLIS: Yes, Your Honor. Every State that\nhas enacted a statute has placed the burden on the\ndefendant, although they have done it in somewhat\ndifferent ways.\nQUESTION: Mr. Ellis, what about this very case?\nThere was some confusion, but the Virginia Supreme Court\nseemed to doubt that this person would qualify as mentally\nretarded. If -- if you would prevail, wouldn't there have\nto be a remand on that question?\nMR. ELLIS: Obviously, in our -- we would not be\ntotally disappointed if this Court were to resolve that\nquestion, but the -- the likelihood and prospect of a\nremand obviously would be an appropriate response so that\nthe Virginia courts who did not, in this case, have before\nthem mental retardation as a legal question that was going\nto decide anything -- it was simply an observation in the\ncourse of making --\nQUESTION: Well, what precisely did the Virginia\nSupreme Court say about this defendant and --\nMR. ELLIS: I -- I think maybe the -- the\nVirginia Supreme Court's decision on that can be best\ncharacterized as expressing concern as to whether or not\nthe individual -- in this case Mr. Atkins -- had mental\nretardation because of the testimony of Dr. Samenow that\n-- that suggested that there had not been a full\ndemonstration of the impact of his impairment in his life,\nthe second prong of the definition --\nQUESTION: Can you tell me --\nQUESTION: Mr. Ellis, apart from the consensus\nargument and these details, what is the real reason behind\nyour position? What's wrong with executing the mentally\nretarded?\nMR. ELLIS: In our view, Your Honor, the people\nwith mental retardation who have both that intellectual\nfunctioning as the core and it has manifested itself in\ntheir life throughout their life -- those individuals in\nour view lack the culpability or blame worthiness because\ntheir understanding of their actions, their understanding\nof the context in which their actions took place --\nQUESTION: Well, why are they subject to\ncriminal liability at all then?\nMR. ELLIS: They are subject to criminal\nliability because it isn't our contention that they, for\nexample, can't tell -- to use the -- the language in -- in\nVirginia's defense of insanity, that they can't tell right\nfrom wrong. What we're suggesting -- so, we're not\nsuggesting they can't be punished. What -- what we're --\nwhat we are contending is that, though they can be\npunished, the death penalty is different, and it is\nreserved for those whose understanding is sufficiently\nclear that the penalty of death can be appropriate.\nQUESTION: So, nothing wrong with putting a\nretarded person -- we know that there's a problem with\ndefinition, but -- in -- in jail for life, solitary. He\ncan exercise in a cage.\nMR. ELLIS: Nothing in the ruling that we seek\nhere would preclude the State from imposing the most\nserious penalty it has other than the penalty of death.\nMost States do. A number of the States that have passed\nstatutes have explicitly provided in those statutes that\nan individual exempted from the death penalty by the\nstatute will be subjected to -- and then it explicitly\nsays, in some cases, life imprisonment without possibility\nof parole, or whatever the heaviest penalty.\nQUESTION: Should the test be the same as for\nexecuting someone with a mental illness? We -- we have\ndealt with that, and -- and with the level of\ncomprehension that someone must have in order to be\neligible for the death penalty who has mental illness.\nShould the test be the same?\nMR. ELLIS: Your Honor, I believe you're\ndiscussing the Ford issue with regard to competence to be\nexecuted? I read the Ford case as suggesting that whether\nthe individual had mental illness or mental retardation,\nif -- if that individual lacked the understanding as\nexecution became imminent, that they -- that the State\nwould be precluded from executing. This --\nQUESTION: So, is that test not adequate here in\nyour view?\nMR. ELLIS: That test, it seems to me, is not\nadequate for several reasons. One is that the Ford\nholding focuses on a defendant and -- and his mental state\nlate in the process, as -- as execution is impending. The\nmental retardation question, as addressed by the States in\n-- in the years since Penry, focuses on the individual's\nmental functioning at the time of the crime.\nQUESTION: What -- what about our -- what about\nour mental illness cases dealing with the time of the\ncrime? Why aren't they sufficient to indeed excuse\nsomebody who couldn't help themselves? You're saying\nthese people can help themselves. They did know the\ndifference from right to wrong, but what? They're --\nthey're slower than others and therefore shouldn't be\nexecuted.\nMR. ELLIS: Yes. Their -- that their\nunderstanding was, of necessity, limited by their mental\nfunctioning.\nQUESTION: Their understanding -- I mean, they\nhave to have known that what they were doing is wrong.\nMR. ELLIS: In order to be convicted in any of\nthese States, yes.\nQUESTION: So, isn't that the only thing that\nbears upon culpability?\nMR. ELLIS: It seems to me, Your Honor, that it\nis not because -- because under our system of capital\npunishment, as it has been shaped by the decisions by this\nCourt, we don't say that the death penalty is available\nfor everyone who can be punished. The Court, through a\nvariety of mechanisms, including the mitigation system,\nhas said that among those who can be punished, some can be\npunished by death and others not. In a number of those\ncases, this Court has reached categorical rules, which is\nwhat we seek here.\nQUESTION: Yes, but -- but those rules were\nbased upon the fact that some people are not as culpable.\nTheir crime was not as heinous and so forth. You have to\nnarrow the category to those people who are really morally\nreprehensible.\nI do not see the necessary connection between --\nbetween intelligence and moral reprehensibility unless you\ntruly think that -- I guess the -- I guess the result of\nyour argument is that there -- that there is more crime\namong -- among the mentally retarded because they don't\nreally understand the consequences of what they're doing.\nIs that a demonstrable proposition? I don't think it is.\nMR. ELLIS: It is not, and I think it's untrue.\nQUESTION: Yes, I think it's totally untrue.\nSo, I don't --\nMR. ELLIS: So, what we're saying in -- in\nresponse to -- to your question, what we are saying is\nthat a person who commits an act -- who has mental\nretardation, who commits an act which is subject to\npunishment, does so within the scope of the limitations\nimposed by his disability. And that may allow him to form\na criminal intent sufficient to satisfy the criminal law\nfor punishment in general, but in our view and now the\nview of -- of the people of the States manifested in these\nstatutes and of the people manifested in the Congress,\nthose individuals who can be punished, as individuals\nunder the age of 16 can be punished, cannot be punished by\nthe penalty of death because, as this Court frequently\nreminds, death is different, a different calculus, a\ndifferent set of concern. The judgment by the people as\nexpressed in their legislatures has been these are\nindividuals for whom we do not want the death penalty\nused. It's not --\nQUESTION: And what is -- what is the reason? I\nmean, you -- you -- in responding to Justice Scalia's\nquestion, you -- you point out, well, these people pass\nthe -- the test of -- of comprehension, which is a\ncondition of culpability for execution. What test don't\nthey pass? What is the reason for this emerging\nconsensus?\nMR. ELLIS: The principal reason -- and -- and\nit has changed a little bit as -- as the -- as the process\nhas gone on. The original and continuing principal reason\nis that people, as expressed through the legislature, have\nreached a judgment that someone whose intellect is at this\nlevel and who has grown up with that limitation on their\nability to learn -- because age of onset is part of the\ndefinition of mental retardation as well -- are not\nindividuals for whom death is an appropriate punishment.\nQUESTION: No. I realize that that's the\njudgment they're reaching, and you want us to recognize\nthat judgment as now having constitutional significance.\nWhat I want to know is why are they reaching that\njudgment? What is the reason that elevates that judgment\nto one of constitutional significance?\nI guess the -- the converse of my question is\nwe're not here simply to add up numbers and say, oh, when\nit gets to 37, the result is different. You're -- you're\nasking us to make a different kind of -- of -- draw a\ndifferent kind of conclusion. And what I want to know is\nwhat is it behind the judgment of these emerging States as\na reason that should recommend itself to us?\nMR. ELLIS: And -- and as I said, the principal\nfocus is on the understanding of people of what the\nlimitations imposed on people with mental retardation are\nand how it affects their comprehension --\nQUESTION: They know it's wrong but they don't\nappreciate how wrong it is?\nMR. ELLIS: Yes.\nQUESTION: I mean, is that the idea?\nMR. ELLIS: It is -- it is that their\nunderstanding of the wrongness of their action may be\nincomplete and in a sense immature in the same way or in a\nparallel way at least --\nQUESTION: Mr. Ellis, I thought that you had\nsaid something different in your brief, and it was that\npeople in this class have diminished capacity when it\ncomes to the life or death decision. I thought you said\nthat they will be smiling in the -- and the jury will say,\nwell, how inappropriate. They're not expressing any\nremorse. That they will not be able to communicate as\neffectively with their -- their counsel. That it's --\nthat it's the image of this person when the life/death\ndecision is made that they give false clues to the trier,\nto the jury, and that will disable counsel from\nrepresenting such a person on that life/death decision.\nYou haven't said anything like that in your oral argument.\nMR. ELLIS: And -- and that was the point I was\nadverting -- was adverting to a moment ago, that the\nprincipal reason is, as I've suggested, the shared\nunderstanding of the diminished culpability of people with\nmental retardation.\nBut increasingly, especially in the last 3 or 4\nyears, there has been a second and secondary reason for\nenactment of the statutes which is a growing concern that\nindividuals with mental retardation facing capital charges\npresent a particularly and uncomfortably large possibility\nof wrongful conviction and thus wrongful execution. The\n-- the cases in both Virginia and in Illinois over the\nlast few years have made what I acknowledge is a secondary\nargument but one which comes up in legislative discussions\nwith increasing frequency, that -- that in just the way\nyou were describing, that the process of adjudicating in a\ncapital case someone who has mental retardation and who's\nunderstanding that -- is that limited may, through a\nvariety of mechanisms, increase the likelihood of wrongful\nconviction and thus unjust execution.\nQUESTION: Counsel is not able to bring that to\nthe jury's attention --\nMR. ELLIS: Counsel --\nQUESTION: -- and say, ladies and gentlemen of\nthe jury -- in fact, he can bring mental retardation to\nthe attention of the jury as a basis for the -- for the\njury's deciding not to execute the person, can he not?\nMR. ELLIS: He clearly can.\nQUESTION: There's no question that in all\nStates he can do that.\nMR. ELLIS: That's right.\nQUESTION: So, you're saying the jury is not\nconstitutionally even allowed to -- to be given the\noption.\nAnd counsel can say to the jury, during this\ntrial, you -- you may see my client smiling inappropriate\nat some points. You should know that this is -- this is\nbecause he's mentally retarded. He really doesn't fully\ncomprehend what is going on here and I ask you not to take\nhis -- his reactions into account. It seems to me that\nwould just reaffirm the -- the more he'd smile, the more a\n-- the jury would say, boy, this -- this person really\nshouldn't be executed. He's not playing with a full deck,\nor whatever.\nMR. ELLIS: There may well be cases in which\nthat would be effective in guarding against that concern,\nbut that also backs into the problem this Court observed\nin Penry, which is in a case-by-case determination,\nparticularly in cases in which juries are making the\ndecision, the mental retardation may in fact be a two-\nedged sword, that the -- that the juror, in evaluating\nwhether or not to impose the penalty of death, may see\nmental retardation not only as a mitigating or potentially\nmitigating factor, but it may also see it as tied to\nprospective dangerousness. That issue is -- is present\neverywhere it seems to me. It is particularly present\nin --\nQUESTION: Isn't it present in all cases of\nmental illness as well?\nMR. ELLIS: Is -- is the difficulty of case-by-\ncase? Yes. It --\nQUESTION: Your arguments seem to be equally\napplicable to those who are mentally ill. It's a two-\nedged sword in effect.\nMR. ELLIS: It is but unlike mental -- in the\ncase of the mental illness, unlike mental retardation,\nthere has not been a manifestation of a national\nconsensus, either in legislation or elsewhere, that\nsuggests the American people have rejected the notion.\nQUESTION: But the reasons you put forward to us\nseem to me remarkably the same.\nMR. ELLIS: The -- the reasons that I've\noffered --\nQUESTION: Am I right?\nMR. ELLIS: -- would apply to other defendants\nwho don't have mental retardation.\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. ELLIS: But -- but they are not so closely\ntied to the defining characteristics of a class as they\nare here to have produced that consensus.\nQUESTION: All right. So, come back and tell us\nhow we know when there's a consensus.\nMR. ELLIS: Your Honor, it seems to me that I\nread this Court's cases as saying that they will -- that\nthe Court will look to -- that in prospective cases you\nwill look to a variety of forms of evidence, but that any\nproffer of evidence of a consensus which does not have\nsubstantial and in one case a discussion of recent\nformulation of that consensus into enactments by the\nlegislature will be viewed with skepticism or impact --\nQUESTION: How many States still allow the\nexecution of retarded?\nMR. ELLIS: Theoretically there -- there could\nbe 20. There -- there --\nQUESTION: In how many of those States have\nthere been executions of retarded people since Penry the\nlast 20 years? I count two.\nMR. ELLIS: We -- we cannot be sure but it is\nroughly two or three, yes.\nQUESTION: So, you -- you have less -- less than\nhalf of the States that have capital punishment make an\nexception for the mentally retarded, and you say that that\nconstitutes a consensus. Less than half.\nMR. ELLIS: Not by itself.\nQUESTION: I can see the argument that there's a\nconsensus on the other side since the other side seems to\nbe in the majority, but you say less than half represents\na consensus.\nMR. ELLIS: I'm not sure that -- that we could\nconclude, for example, that people in the States that\ndon't have the death penalty approve its imposition or if\nthey adopted a death penalty would include within the\nscope of this --\nQUESTION: But we're looking to legislation, and\n-- and we --\nQUESTION: But you're saying 48 constituted a\nconsensus.\nMR. ELLIS: Well, that -- that is another way of\ncounting. And I don't -- I don't want to slip into what\nan amicus on the other side referred to as the counting of\nnoses. This is a serious business, as this Court has\nrecognized, and the fact that the Court has not treated\nlarge States differently from small suggests that the\nCourt is looking at these enactments not only to count up\nthe jurisdictions that have adopted it, but also to see\nwhether the process by which they have been enacted is\nrevealing of a settled moral judgment, in this case a\nmoral judgment of revulsion --\nQUESTION: Settled. But we also said in Penry\nthat -- you know, the argument was made to us that there\nwas an emerging consensus, and we rejected that. We said\nan emerging consensus is not enough. There has to be a\nconsensus.\nMR. ELLIS: And our position, on the basis of\nwhat has happened in the 13 years since Penry, is that the\nconsensus that was then emerging is now manifest, both in\nthe legislation and in every other indicator we have of\npublic sentiment.\nI'll reserve --\nQUESTION: You're not talking about polls if\nyou're talking about public sentiment, are you?\nMR. ELLIS: It seems to me, Your Honor, that --\nthat the polling information, which was quite scanty then\nand is now quite full, as suggested in the AAMR amicus\nbrief in McCarver, is part of the picture.\nQUESTION: Well, wouldn't you expect if people\nfeel that way, it would -- it would be manifested in\nlegislation?\nMR. ELLIS: And increasingly it is.\nQUESTION: Yes, but are you saying that somehow\npolls are to be considered in addition to legislation?\nMR. ELLIS: Polls, it seems to me, Your Honor\nare a way of -- of viewing the legislation, of seeing\nwhether or not the consensus the legislation appears to\nreveal is in fact --\nQUESTION: And I take it polls should be\nadmitted in -- if we're going to talk about polls as\ncontributing to this discussion, they should be admitted\nin the trial court and subject to examination by the other\nside. Are any -- have any of yours done that?\nMR. ELLIS: I -- I don't believe -- I -- I'm\ntrying to think of a case in which polling has played a\npart in the trial court, and -- and I believe it has --\nnone comes to mind. None comes to mind.\nI'd like to reserve the rest of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well.\nMs. Rumpz. Am I pronouncing your name\ncorrectly?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAMELA A. RUMPZ\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. RUMPZ: Yes.\nThank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nWhat is at stake here is this Court's long-\nestablished jurisprudence of individualized sentencing in\nmatters of the death penalty. Penry would have -- not\nPenry. I'm sorry. Atkins would have this Court removed\nfrom individualized sentencing one whole group of people\nbased upon one mere factor, and that is their alleged\nmental retardation.\nQUESTION: Well, the position of the\nCommonwealth of Virginia is that you can execute the\nretarded. Is that correct?\nMS. RUMPZ: Yes, the retarded individuals who,\nlike Atkins, were found competent at the time of the\ncrime, competent at the time of -- to assist his lawyers,\nwho were found guilty of a premeditated, deliberated, and\ncalculated murder, and who --\nQUESTION: So, any person who has criminal\nresponsibility can be executed no matter how retarded they\nare. That's your position.\nMS. RUMPZ: That is the position of the\nCommonwealth of Virginia, yes. And they -- of course, the\njury has to be instructed, in -- in keeping with Penry I,\nabout the mitigating value of the defendant's mental\nretardation.\nQUESTION: You -- you would not say no matter\nhow retarded. I mean, presumably there's some point at\nwhich the retardation is so severe that the person does\nnot comprehend what he's doing.\nMS. RUMPZ: Exactly, Your Honor, but if --\nQUESTION: But short of that, you're saying --\nMS. RUMPZ: But short of that, exactly. But\nthe --\nQUESTION: Then --\nMS. RUMPZ: -- the DSM-TR -- IV-TR recognizes\nfour different categories of mental retardation. As this\nCourt noted in Penry, the profoundly or severely retarded\nare not likely to face the prospect of punishment, and\nthey're not really who we're arguing about here today.\nWe're arguing --\nQUESTION: Well, why don't we say the same thing\nthen about -- about children, about young people? So long\nas the State can prove the premeditation, the\ndeliberation, the -- the other requirements of -- of\nmental culpability, let them be executed.\nMS. RUMPZ: But this Court has said that about\n16-year-olds in Stanford.\nQUESTION: Well, let's take 5-year-olds. Would\n-- would you argue that 5-year-olds should be executed if\n-- if they have deliberated on -- on the act and -- and\notherwise the State can prove the -- the mental element?\nMS. RUMPZ: I think that that's -- that's\nunlikely to happen. But if -- if a person can deliberate\nand premeditate and if a person can commit a brutal,\ncalculated, premeditated murder, and if a person is found\ncompetent at the time he commits that murder and competent\nto assist his lawyers at the time of the trial, then we're\nnot looking at somebody whose culpability is in any way\nless than yours or mine.\nQUESTION: Do you believe there is -- there is\nany role at all in -- in the -- in Eighth Amendment\njurisprudence, death penalty jurisprudence I guess, for --\nfor general rules to the effect that, yes, there may in\nsome instances, let's say, of retardation be -- be proof\nof -- that would at least be enough to get to a jury on\npremeditation and -- and deliberation and so on, but that\nthe very fact of -- of retardation makes it unlikely in\nmost cases that this can be proven and makes the evidence\nat least highly debatable, even in those cases that get to\na jury? And therefore, the sensible thing to do in order\nto avoid a high risk either of wrong conviction or in the\ncase of -- of the penalty phase a high risk of -- of\nunsound judgments imposing the death penalty, there ought\nto be a cutoff point of some sort. There ought to be a\ncutoff of the high risk cases from the general rules of\nproof. Do you -- do you take the position that there is\nno place in -- in death penalty jurisprudence for that\nkind of a -- we'll say a high risk cutoff rule?\nMS. RUMPZ: A high risk cutoff rule of? I'm\nsorry. I didn't follow exactly what you were saying.\nQUESTION: Well, I'm -- I'm assuming that, sure,\nthere are cases of borderline retardation and so on in\nwhich the -- there would be enough evidence to get to a\njury on the various mental elements for a -- for a capital\nsentencing. I'm also assuming that in cases of\nretardation, including retardation near the borderline,\nthat that evidence is -- is highly debatable in most\ncases, and it is sufficiently uncertain, it is\nsufficiently debatable that there's a high risk that a\njury is going to come to the wrong conclusion. It's going\nto say, oh, yes, this person really is the worst of the\nworst and sentence him in -- in a case in which that\nreally is not so.\nAnd the reason for having a rule saying, we're\ngoing to have a -- a retardation cutoff -- a person who is\nretarded will be ineligible for the death penalty -- is to\navoid those high risk cases and avoid the risk, in effect,\nof wrong imposition of the death penalty. That's why we\nwould have such a rule, quite apart from moral judgments\nor anything else. I'm just talking about this practical\nrisk judgment.\nAnd my question to you is, do you say that our\ndeath penalty jurisprudence should have no place for such\na -- a risk assessment rule?\nMS. RUMPZ: That's what individualized\nsentencing is. That is the risk assessment rule. That's\nwhat juries --\nQUESTION: Well, it's -- its very clear that\nwithin the category of those who ought to be subject to\nthe death penalty, there should be individual assessment.\nI'm asking whether you believe that in risky cases there\nought to be rules to eliminate the risk. And I take it\nyour answer is yes, but I don't want to say that if -- if\nI'm being unfair to -- to your position here.\nMS. RUMPZ: You know, I don't want to play dumb\nhere, Justice Souter, but I'm afraid I'm not understanding\nwhat -- what you're asking me. I think that the risk\nassessments that you're talking about play into the -- the\nconcepts of individualized sentencing under the Eighth\nAmendment. The juries make those assessments. The juries\ndetermine whether someone is sufficiently culpable for the\ndeath penalty and they determine whether his mental\nretardation is a mitigating factor sufficient to outweigh\ngiving the -- the defendant the death penalty.\nQUESTION: Let's assume, because I'd like to get\nthe answer to Justice Souter's question myself -- let's\nassume. You may disagree with it.\nMS. RUMPZ: Okay.\nQUESTION: Let's assume that there's a higher\nrisk of inaccurate determinations by a jury, both for\nguilt and -- and penalty, when the person is retarded.\nLet's assume that. You may disagree with that, but let's\nassume it.\nMS. RUMPZ: Okay, I'll assume that.\nQUESTION: Justice -- Justice Souter asked the\nquestion, if there is that risk, is there a place in our\nEighth Amendment jurisprudence for us to take account of\nthat risk and draw some lines?\nMS. RUMPZ: No. I -- I think -- if I understand\nwhat you're asking is -- is -- does the Eighth Amendment\nprovide exemption from the death penalty to a class of\npersons who may be at a greater risk for an inappropriate\ndeath sentence? I don't think the Eighth Amendment plays\ninto -- that's what the Eighth Amendment sets up\nindividualized consideration and individualized sentencing\nfor.\nQUESTION: Mr. Rumpz, I -- it's a hard question\nto answer because I guess you -- you would need a\ndefinition of what constitutes an inappropriate or\nimproper death penalty, and we haven't -- we haven't\nestablished any guidelines. We have said you must leave\nit to the jury to take into account all mitigating\nfactors. Whatever the jury considers mitigating it may\nallow. In such a scheme, I don't know -- it is\nmeaningless to talk about an inappropriate death -- death\nsentence. There are no criteria. It's up to the jury.\nWhatever the jury considers mitigating it may allow.\nAnd --\nMS. RUMPZ: Exactly.\nQUESTION: I guess you're talking --\nQUESTION: There -- there is not a proper or an\nimproper death -- death sentence.\nQUESTION: I guess you're talking about a class\nof -- you said this class of people -- and I'm not sure\nyou meant that -- is no less culpable than you or me. But\nI thought the class of people we're talking about is a\nclass of people that might simply barely understand what's\ngoing on. Barely. So, they know right from wrong, but\nthey can't understand anything complicated. They have a\nhard time functioning. Their emotions are no more\ndifferent than yours nor mine, than anybody's. So, they\nfeel things strongly. But they won't take in the nature\nof the punishment, in all likelihood, and they're quite\ncapable of following the leader, whoever is the leader\nnearby. And therefore, this class of people is different\nenough than you, than me, that we wouldn't say they are\nsimilarly culpable. And I guess in 48 of the 50 States,\npeople have reached that conclusion.\nAll right. Now -- now, that's I take this case.\nAnd I say 48 because I want you to disagree with me so we\ncan then explore that.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: But I thought that that was -- I\nmean, there's an argument --\nMS. RUMPZ: I'll be --\nQUESTION: But I want you to address, A, I've\ntried to make a point maybe they are not so culpable as\nyou or me. And second, an awful lot of people in the\nUnited States seem to agree with that. In fact, I -- now,\nthose are the two things I want you to address.\nMS. RUMPZ: Well, first of all, I think this\ncase is a perfect illustration of the first point, the\nfirst point being that -- that they are. If you are found\ncompetent to stand trial and competent to assist your\nlawyers, you are like you and me. Daryl Atkins had a\nperfect understanding of the system, knew all about\nmitigation evidence, recommended witnesses to testify in\nmitigation, was competent to assist his lawyers, said he\nwanted his retardation put in front of the jury if it\nhelped him. He had no deficits in understanding the\nsystem.\nMoving on to the second point, 18 of the 38\ndeath penalty States have formed or have enacted some sort\n-- excuse me -- some sort of laws prohibiting execution of\nthe mentally retarded. The Commonwealth's position,\nhowever, is that that 18 is -- is not written in stone\nbecause many of the statutes don't provide for retroactive\napplication. So, you're looking --\nQUESTION: There was a time -- there was a\ntime --\nQUESTION: The -- the question I have on that is\nyou want to say less than 18.\nMS. RUMPZ: I -- I sure do.\nQUESTION: I want to know why not far more than\n18, and my reason for that is that in -- of the remaining\n20 -- there are two States that have executed retarded\npeople, and they account, I gather, for about 7 percent of\nthe population. But in the remaining States that haven't\npassed this law yet, why would someone feel a need to pass\nit?\nI noticed, which I copied here, that the\nGovernor of Texas said, I am -- I am going to veto this\nlaw because we do not execute mentally retarded murderers\ntoday. Now -- now, he might have been wrong about that in\nTexas. I don't know. But regardless, why would a State\nthat never even has executions, but they have it on the\nbooks, feel constrained to pass a law?\nMS. RUMPZ: Well, I -- I think that -- that the\nfact that 18 States have done so in the last 13 years --\nit doesn't mean that that --\nQUESTION: Presumably those States were\nexecuting a lot of retarded people, and that's why the\nlaws were passed.\nMS. RUMPZ: Well, that's an equally good\nassumption.\nQUESTION: Well, I assume -- an even simpler\nassumption is that they were executing people.\nLet me ask you a kind of a -- a specific example\nof Justice Breyer's question. In -- in your calculation,\nhow do you account for the -- for a State like the one\nthat I come from that has not executed somebody in over 60\nyears? Do you say, well, that's a State that apparently\napproves of executing the retarded? Do you say that's a\nState that shouldn't be counted at all? How do you\naccount for that in your calculus?\nMS. RUMPZ: I don't know what State you come\nfrom, first of all.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: I'm from -- I'm from New Hampshire,\nand the last execution was in '38 or '39.\nMS. RUMPZ: I guess my answer to that is that\nthis Court has said that societal consensuses are formed,\nand when you're looking to see whether there is a societal\nconsensus, you look to the statutes that the -- that the\nlegislators have passed.\nQUESTION: But that's what we're asking about,\nand Justice Breyer's question, as well as Justice\nSouter's, is -- I think must recognize the premise that\none of the great facts of life in American Government is\nlegislative inertia. Legislatures don't act unless\nthey're prompted to do so. And a legislature is not going\nto just sit down and say, oh, I think it's a good time for\nus to pass a -- a bill on -- against executing the\nmentally retarded if there's no such person on death row.\nLegislatures just don't operate that way.\nMS. RUMPZ: Or there's no such person -- person\non death row who was not competent to -- to commit his\ncrime, was not competent at the time of his trial, was not\ncompetent to assist his lawyers. There's a difference\nthere.\nQUESTION: What -- what do we know, Ms. Rumpz,\nabout the situation in the States, the 18 States which\nhave prohibited the execution of the retarded? Had they\njust gone through a tremendous number of retarded\nexecutions?\nMS. RUMPZ: I suspect not.\nQUESTION: Do we -- is there any -- anything in\nthe briefs that indicates why these States passed the\nlegislation that they did?\nMS. RUMPZ: No, there's not. And -- and I can\nspeculate that it's a pretty pro -- anti-death penalty\nmachine out there working, but --\nQUESTION: Justice Breyer says only two mentally\nretarded people have been executed in -- in the last I\ndon't know what. So, that couldn't explain these 18\nStates. So, maybe legislatures do enact laws because they\nthink they're good laws to enact, and maybe that's why the\n18 did it.\nQUESTION: No, no. I said two in -- two, but it\nmay be a few more. That's what I'm not -- in two States\nin those States that haven't enacted the laws. Of course,\nthe ones that have enacted the laws don't have the\nexecutions, and some of them did execute mentally retarded\npeople before they passed the law.\nMS. RUMPZ: Well, the Federal Death Penalty\nInformation Center, if you get on their web site, says\nthat since Penry was decided in 1989, 25 mentally\nretarded --\nQUESTION: We've gone through those and -- and\ntried bit by bit, and most of them are in these States and\nthen some of them are -- have IQ's of 70 or over. And I\nwould say in that -- they're -- they're erring on the side\nof counting mentally retarded. But if you draw the line\nat 70, look below it, you get to the numbers I had.\nI'm looking to you for giving me the good\nnumbers and -- and the lawyers. That's why I -- I figured\nit out it was two States, but I'm not certain.\nMS. RUMPZ: I -- I think just because two States\nin -- in -- since 1989 have executed mentally retarded\noffenders doesn't mean that there aren't mentally retarded\noffenders in the pipeline waiting to be -- to become\nexecuted or waiting to go through their appellate process\nor -- or coming up to trial. You know and I know that\nthis is a very slow process. These cases drag on for\nyears and years, decades. And -- and when you look to a\nnumber like that, you necessarily have to figure in all --\nQUESTION: Leave it at this, that since Penry --\nPenry. There's no consensus. Since Penry, 18 States have\nsaid by law, no. And in the remaining States, we're\npretty sure that two of them, accounting for about 7\npercent of the population, have executed mentally retarded\npeople and maybe double that if you want, triple it. Say\nthere are 14 percent, 20 percent. Still, isn't that a\nconsensus? Why not?\nMS. RUMPZ: Well, I -- I guess I'd go back to\nwhat Justice Scalia said in one of his opinions is that\nthat may very well just be that juries and prosecutors and\nsociety believes that the death penalty ought to be\nimposed on the mentally retarded less often.\nQUESTION: Ms. Rumpz, if we stayed just with the\n18 plus the 12 that don't have the death penalty, then we\nget up to what?\nMS. RUMPZ: 30.\nQUESTION: Three-fifths of all the States. We\nget enough to, for example, block a filibuster in the\nSenate. That's a super majority. Why isn't that -- why\ndoesn't that suffice?\nMS. RUMPZ: For two reasons. First of all, I\ndon't think you can count 18 as 18 because in some of\nthose States, you can execute the mentally retarded.\nQUESTION: Now, there was a time in this Court\n-- it wasn't all that long ago -- when this Court was\nmaking prospective declarations of unconstitutionality,\nthis case and all future cases, not past cases. Maybe the\nStates that haven't made it retroactive haven't gotten up\nto speed on that once it's -- once we make a declaration\nof unconstitutionality, it's retrospective.\nMS. RUMPZ: Even given that, New York has in its\nstatute specifically that people who commit murders, while\nin prison, can be executed even if they're mentally\nretarded. So, you have to take New York from the list.\nMentally retarded offenders can be executed in New York.\nSecond of all, I don't think you can add the 12\nnon-death penalty States and -- to -- to a number of death\npenalty States to try to form a societal consensus.\nQUESTION: Why not?\nMS. RUMPZ: Well, because they may have some\nbearing on whether there's a consensus against the death\npenalty altogether.\nQUESTION: Right, and it includes that. I can't\nimagine that you would say you couldn't count those\nStates.\nMS. RUMPZ: Well, Wisconsin tomorrow may decide\nto adopt a death penalty statute, and if they do, they'll\nhave to affirmatively legislate a number of things.\nThey'll have to pick an age where it can be imposed.\nThey'll have to decide whether they're weighing or non-\nweighing. They'll have to decide whether they're going to\nhave a provision to execute the mentally retarded. All of\nthose things have to be considered by the State\nlegislature, and I don't think we can presume --\nQUESTION: Let me try this another way. Do you\n-- do you concede that if there is a consensus, whatever\nthat means, then this Court should make the determination\nthat we're asked to make here?\nMS. RUMPZ: No.\nQUESTION: You don't agree that if there's a\nconsensus, then the Eighth Amendment would bar it.\nMS. RUMPZ: No. And -- and I think that --\nQUESTION: This Court said that might, indeed,\nbe the law in Penry, but you say we were wrong there.\nMS. RUMPZ: No. I -- I refer the Court to\nSpaziano v. Florida where the -- where the Court said you\ndon't just nose count. You -- you have to look at the\nwhole -- the whole picture, and just because sister States\ndecide to do one thing or not do other things doesn't\nnecessarily bind the -- the -- this Court and the other\nStates.\nQUESTION: But you do not even accept the notion\nthat if there is a consensus and we find there is, that\nthat answers the question. I take it you do not accept\nthat.\nMS. RUMPZ: I think that Spaziano says\ndifferent.\nQUESTION: Well, do you accept the view that\nthere is in fact an evolutionary element in Eighth\nAmendment jurisprudence, that in fact it does change as --\nas societal notions of reasonableness in terms of cruelty\nchange?\nMS. RUMPZ: Well, this Court has said that there\n-- that there is.\nQUESTION: That's the answer. You don't have to\nagree with it. The Court said that. That's the position\nI'm in too.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: So, you -- you accept that as the\nframework that we are supposed to be working in. You\nsubmit your case on the basis of that framework.\nMS. RUMPZ: That's what -- that's what this\nCourt said in Penry.\nQUESTION: May I ask another question on a\nlittle different line? I think there's been sort of a\nconsensus in the argument here that the number of\nexecutions of the mentally retarded is rather small.\nMS. RUMPZ: Yes.\nQUESTION: And does not that reflect the fact\nthat juries generally are reluctant to execute the\nmentally retarded, to impose the death penalty on the\nmentally retarded?\nMS. RUMPZ: I -- I don't know that that reflects\nthat. That -- that could reflect a number of things.\nThat could -- that could reflect mitigation versus non-\nmitigation. It could reflect -- the brief of the --\nQUESTION: Well, if -- if it is true, isn't --\nis that not one of the facts on which the Court relied in\nthe rape case, holding that the crime of rape could not be\n-- command the death penalty?\nMS. RUMPZ: Exactly. This Court looks at the\nlaws and the application of the laws.\nQUESTION: And the -- and the number of juries\nthat refuse to impose the death penalty. And so, that's\npart of the consensus is what the juries have done as well\nas what State legislatures have done. Is that not right?\nMS. RUMPZ: That is exactly right. But I don't\nthink that you can infer that because there are X many of\n-- of juries who have given sentences to mentally retarded\nthat that means juries are -- are reluctant to do it.\nQUESTION: There are very few executions of\nwomen in the United States. There have been for many\nyears. Do you think we should make an exception to the\ndeath penalty for women?\nMS. RUMPZ: Absolutely not.\nQUESTION: Because juries so rarely impose it?\nQUESTION: No, but it is -- it is part of our\nlaw. And I read you a sentence out of Coker against\nGeorgia. It is true that in the vast majority of cases,\nat least 9 out of 10, juries have not imposed the death\nsentence. And that was one of the reasons why the Court\nheld that the death sentence was unconstitutional. Is\nthat not correct?\nMS. RUMPZ: Well, I think that the fact that\nwe're here arguing this case today is proof that juries\ndo, in fact, give the death penalty to mentally retarded\npeople. They -- they gave it -- the Commonwealth's brief\nis -- is -- got two or three pages of cases where --\nQUESTION: No. The point isn't that they never\ndo. It's the point that they rarely do.\nMS. RUMPZ: And the fact that they rarely do,\nlike I said earlier, could mean that juries believe, just\nas Atkins' team believes, that it -- that it should be\nrarely imposed.\nQUESTION: Well, it -- it also may represent a\njury's belief that it is a mitigating circumstance of such\nforce that they should be spared the death penalty.\nQUESTION: Of course.\nMS. RUMPZ: And I agree. And in this case, the\njury was specifically told about Atkins' mental\nretardation. Two doctors testified about it at length,\nand two different sentencing juries, after hearing from\nAtkins' expert witness, and after hearing the vile nature\nof his crime and about his 25 prior felonies, 24 jurors\ngave him the death sentence.\nQUESTION: Ms. Rumpz, in making this cruel and\nunusual decision -- this is an issue that's come up\nbefore, but does what the rest of the world think about\nexecuting the mentally retarded -- should that have any\nrelevance at all? I mean, we have, since the time we said\nwe don't look to the rest of the world, been supporters of\ninternational human rights tribunals in -- for the former\nYugoslavia, for the former Rwanda. But is it still, would\nyou say, just irrelevant that most of the rest of the\nworld thinks that mentally retarded people -- because it's\ninhuman to execute them?\nMS. RUMPZ: This Court has said previously that\nthe notions of other countries and the notions of other\nlands cannot play the deciding factor in what --\nQUESTION: Not deciding. I asked you if it was\nrelevant.\nMS. RUMPZ: Well, it is relevant in -- as\nJustice Scalia said in one of his opinions, to determine\nwhether our practice is a historical accident or not. But\nit certainly is not relevant in deciding the Eighth\nAmendment principle.\nQUESTION: Most of the world would not execute\nrocket scientists. Isn't that right? Including the\nEuropean Union?\nMS. RUMPZ: Most of the --\nQUESTION: Would not execute rocket scientists.\nMS. RUMPZ: Yes, the majority of -- of the -- of\nthe planet --\nQUESTION: So, we should abolish the death\npenalty --\nMS. RUMPZ: -- is opposed --\nQUESTION: -- if that's -- if that's to be a --\nQUESTION: I asked if it was relevant.\nMS. RUMPZ: And -- and --\nQUESTION: I didn't ask if it was dispositive.\nMS. RUMPZ: It's not dispositive, and it is\nrelevant once the Eighth Amendment principle has already\nbeen established. It's not relevant in establishing\nwhether something is cruel and unusual.\nQUESTION: Why do you need it after it's been\nestablished?\nQUESTION: You don't.\nMS. RUMPZ: You don't. You -- you look -- you\nlook after the fact to see whether -- I guess my answer I\nguess is it's not relevant.\nQUESTION: That's what I thought.\nMS. RUMPZ: It's not relevant.\nQUESTION: I was going to -- I did not have a\nchance to ask petitioner's counsel because his rebuttal\ntime was running up, but it's important to me. Mentally\nretarded people constitute about 1 percent of the general\npopulation. I've looked through the briefs and just could\nnot find -- are there any statistics that you know that\ntell us what the prison population percentage of mentally\nretarded people are? What is the mentally retarded\npopulation of the criminal system generally? Do you know?\nMS. RUMPZ: I don't know, and it -- there --\nQUESTION: Would it be the same as the general\npopulation or higher?\nMS. RUMPZ: I -- I couldn't speculate. We don't\nknow and it's not in this record what the -- what the\nprison population of mentally retarded people --\nQUESTION: What is the status of the legislation\nin Virginia on this point now?\nMS. RUMPZ: It was -- it didn't pass the House.\nQUESTION: It passed one house but not the\nother?\nMS. RUMPZ: Passed -- bicameral legislature --\nVirginia. Passed the Senate, didn't get out of the House.\nQUESTION: Was it voted on in the House?\nMS. RUMPZ: I don't know.\nQUESTION: I thought it wasn't voted on.\nMS. RUMPZ: I don't believe it was voted on. I\nthink it was -- it was -- it died in a committee I think.\nI'm not positive about that. I was actually here when\nthey did that, and I wasn't -- I know that it -- it didn't\nget past the House side of the -- of the General Assembly.\nTo -- to sum up, the national consensus issue is\nthe key issue here today, and this Court needs to -- as --\nas the earlier argument or the earlier comments were, the\nCourt needs to recognize as, Justice O'Connor, you\nrecognized in Thompson and, Justice Scalia, you mentioned\ntoday, any decision this Court makes regarding this issue\nis irreversible. It is likely irreversible.\nThese States who have enacted these laws, these\n18 States that have enacted these laws, the longest one\nhas been on the books for 13 years. Some of them have\nbeen on the books for less than a year. On average,\nthey've been on the books for an average of 5 years.\nWell, a national consensus has to be broad,\nclear, and enduring. Certainly statutes with an average\nage of 5 years don't establish an enduring national\nconsensus against something. That's a blip in the radar\nscreen of public opinion, or to borrow from Justice\nScalia, it's a pendulum swing in public opinion. Now,\nthese State legislatures may decide in 2 years --\nQUESTION: How can you say it's a pendulum swing\nwhen it's all in the same direction? I thought a pendulum\nwent back and forth.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. RUMPZ: It's a pendulum swing one way.\nQUESTION: It only goes in one direction at a\ntime, doesn't it?\n(Laughter.)\nMS. RUMPZ: But -- but my point is this practice\nhas been allowed since the Bill of Rights was adopted in\n1789, and we have 18 States, some of which can't decide in\nbetween themselves whether the mentally retarded should or\nshouldn't be executed, with an average age of 5 years.\nNow, certainly 5 years is insufficient to determine\nwhether there is an enduring national consensus against\nsomething. These States, as somebody recognized here\nearlier, may determine in 2 or 3 years that this is an\nexperiment that just didn't work.\nQUESTION: Well, do you accept that there's a\nconsensus and want to argue it's just not enduring? Or\nwhat is it you're arguing?\nMS. RUMPZ: No. I -- I think there's not a\nconsensus, first of all, and my backup position is if\nthere is a consensus, it certainly isn't one of an\nenduring nature. I don't think 18, even if you say all 18\nof the States and ignore the retrospective/prospective --\nI don't know 18 out of 38 is a consensus. It's not even a\nmajority, let alone a consensus.\nBut even putting aside that for the matter, you\n-- even if you put that aside, we don't anything that's\nenduring. We don't have anything that shows that the\nlong-term public opinion is against execution of the\nmentally retarded. We have a blip in the radar screen of\npublic opinion which may change in 2 years. It may change\nin 3 years.\nIf Osama bin Laden was brought back to the\nUnited States tomorrow, found to be mentally retarded and\nnot being able to -- to be executed, public opinion would\nchange, and there would be -- the blip in the radar screen\nwould go away and the public opinion would be something\ndifferent. But if this Court were to constitutionalize\nthe prohibition, the public wouldn't have any opportunity\nto change their mind.\nAnd as this Court has said before, the States\nare laboratories. The States are laboratories for novel\nsocial experimentation. Well, this experiment is just\nbeginning. This Court -- this -- there's -- there's --\nthis Court should not call a halt to an experiment that\nhas been on average for 5 years, especially when, as\nJustice O'Connor, you recognized in -- in Thompson, that\nhalt could be irreversible.\nAnd if there are no further questions.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Rumpz.\nMr. Ellis, you have a little less than a minute\nleft.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES W. ELLIS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. ELLIS: I'll endeavor to answer a couple of\nthe questions that this Court has raised.\nFirst, with regard to Justice Kennedy's question\nabout prison population, we don't have a reliable\nstatistic. There is some indication, especially for very\nlow level crimes, that there may be a higher level of\npeople with mental retardation than in the general\npopulation.\nWith regard to the States, Spaziano, it seems to\nme is a very important case here because it says we're not\nsimply counting up States. We're seeing whether the\nStates have reached a moral judgment, have reached a\nconclusion that the -- in this case, the understanding of\npeople with mental retardation, their ability to control\ntheir behavior, their understanding of the context in\nwhich they behave, the maturity and responsibility with\nwhich they reach moral judgments is -- makes the death\npenalty unacceptable.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Ellis.\n"
