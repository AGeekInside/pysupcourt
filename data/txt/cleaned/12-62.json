KINNAIRD\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. KINNAIRD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn sentencing Petitioner Marvin Peugh, the\ndistrict court applied the 2009 guidelines sentencing\nrange of 70 to 87 months, rather than the 1998 range of\n37 to 46 months applicable at the time of his offense.\nRetroactive application of harsher guidelines passed\nafter the offense violates the Ex Post Facto Clause if\nit -- if it creates a significant risk of increased\npunishment.\nNow, the government here objects that a\nguidelines amendment does not change the law, but that\nis incorrect. The guidelines are legislative rules that\ndefine a term of a mandatory statute, namely subsection\n(a)(4) of Section 18 USC --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. A mandatory\nschedule?\nMR. KINNAIRD: Excuse me?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: A mandatory schedule, you\nsay?\nMR. KINNAIRD: No, it's a term of a -- of a\nmandatory statute, subsection --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, okay.\nMR. KINNAIRD: -- (a)(4) of -- of 18 USC\n3553. That provision requires the district court to\nconsider the guidelines sentencing range, and I'll\nquote, \"established for the applicable category of\noffense committed by the applicable category of\noffender.\"\nSo, in 1998, the guide -- that statute, the\nlaw mandated that the district court shall consider, as\napplied to Peugh's offense and offender category, a\nsentencing range of 37 to 46 months.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, let's say you prevail,\nand the case is remanded for resentencing. Is there\nanything that would prevent the district court from\nsaying -- you know, before the promulgation of the new\nguidelines, I thought the range in the old guidelines\nwas about right for this offense.\nBut, now that I've seen the new guidelines,\nI think that those really fit best under the factors\nthat I have to consider under the statute in determining\nthe correct sentence, so I'm going to reimpose exactly\nthe same sentence, not because it's required by the\nguidelines, in fact, I'm going to go outside the\nguidelines. I just think, with the enlightenment that\nthe new guidelines have provided me, that that's the\nbest sentence.\nNow, would that be -- would there be an ex\npost facto problem there?\nMR. KINNAIRD: No, it would not, Your Honor.\nYou would, under the statute, have to follow all the\nsteps in the Rita/Gall framework, but the district court\nis always able to consider any new developments that it\nwants. What we're talking about is the change of law.\nAnd that was the point I was just getting to.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's not a change of the\nlaw if -- if the law does not require the guidelines to\nbe imposed. Your -- your case rests upon the\nproposition you stated at the outset, which is that the\nEx Post Facto Law applies -- prohibition applies -- if\nthere is a substantial possibility of -- of a higher\nsentence -- was that the language you used?\nMR. KINNAIRD: Substantial -- significant\nrisk --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Significant risk.\nSuppose -- suppose the district judge for the Federal\ndistrict in which somebody's crime was committed was a\nbleeding heart judge. He always gave the lowest\nsentence possible, and everybody knew that.\nAnd he is replaced. He retires after the\narrest, after the crime, and he is replaced by Maximum\nJohn, who everybody knows gives the highest sentence,\nevery time. Ex post -- ex post facto violation?\nMR. KINNAIRD: No, because the Ex Post Facto\nClause only applies to laws where here are delegated\nlawmaking. And here's where the change in the law was,\nYour Honor: As I mentioned, in 1998, the law required\nthe district court to consider a sentencing range of 37\nto 46 months.\nWith the guidelines amendment, the law\nchanged. The law now required the district court for\nthat category of offender and offense to consider as\nthe --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is that what your\ndefinition of legal consequence is?\nMR. KINNAIRD: Well, legal consequence\nrefers to punishment. That's something -- that's\nsomething different. So the fact --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, so you're\ntaking -- you're disagreeing with the proposition of our\nolder cases that to -- for there to be an ex post facto\nviolation, you have to have a legal consequence.\nMR. KINNAIRD: No, not at all, Your Honor.\nThe legal consequence is the -- is the ultimate sentence\nimposed. And in Morales and Lynce, the Court said --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, there's a --\nthere's a disconnect for me. Yes, I do accept that the\ndistrict courts have to consider the guidelines. But\nhow do you tie that to the requirement that the\npunishment has to be tied to the guidelines?\nMR. KINNAIRD: Well, the Court said, in\nMorales and in Lynce, that -- and then when it was\nreconciling two different formulations of the\nstandard -- and, in Lynce, the Court said it's the same\ntest whether you increase the penalty or whether you\ndetermine if there's a sufficient risk of increasing the\npenalty because that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The real formula is --\nsignificantly increased the risk of perform -- of\nprolonging the defendant's incarceration. That's the\nstandard you would like us --\nMR. KINNAIRD: That's the standard of Garner\nand Morales, yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And is -- is the heart of\nyour argument that there really isn't much difference at\nall in what district judges are doing, now that the\nguidelines are discretionary, than what they did when\nthey were mandatory; that is, most of them will start\nwith and stop with the guidelines.\nI think that's --\nMR. KINNAIRD: Yes. That -- that is\ncertainly one element of it, but the -- the fact -- it's\nnot exactly the same, but the fact is that, even under\nthe advisory guidelines, the change in law creates a\nsignificant risk.\nAnd when you're evaluating significant risk,\nI think you have to start from the premise that the\nex post facto violation prohibits an increase in\npunishment of any quantum, even of 1 day.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Your -- your brief spent\nsome time on statistics, how often this happens. But I\ntake it you're not saying that our inquiry is a\nstatistical one. You're simply saying that the\nstatistics bear out that, as an objective legal matter,\nthe framework that you are explaining to us is and must\nbe followed?\nMR. KINNAIRD: Yes, Your Honor. The -- and\nthat's -- the inquiry in Garner -- in Garner, the Court\nsaid, you can demonstrate significant risk either by\nshowing that the risk is inherent in the rule or as\napplied to your sentence and marshalling the evidence of\nthe practical operation of the rule.\nSo statistical evidence is -- is evidence of\nthe fact of significant risk by the operation of that\nframework.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What about the statutes\nallowing relatives and friends of the victim to testify?\nLet's assume a crime committed before -- a horrible\ncrime committed before that statute is enacted. Does it\nviolate the ex post facto law to give effect to that\nstatute?\nMR. KINNAIRD: No, Your Honor. I think\nthere's a series of cases saying those kind of changes\nin trial procedure would not be within the Ex Post Facto\nClause. It --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why? Don't -- don't you\nthink it creates a significant risk --\nMR. KINNAIRD: Well, you have to --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that the defendant will\nget a higher sentence? Don't you think that's the whole\nobject of the law, in fact?\nMR. KINNAIRD: Well, but -- what you have to\nshow -- I think you have -- this is a core sentencing\nlaw. It changes the law of punishment, which is\ndifferent from procedure. And, in Miller, the Court\nsaid that, when there's a change in the -- in the actual\nsentencing standard, the number of years, that's\nsubstantive, not procedural.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if you have a\nlaw that sentencing judges must consider these factors,\nand one of the factors is whether the defendant has\nstrong family ties that will be -- you know, jeopardized\nor whatever, if he's incarcerated. You don't want to\ntake him away from his family because that will penalize\nother people. And then Congress thinks that's not a\ngood idea and they take that away.\nIs that an ex post facto violation? It\nincreases the factors of -- or the risk that the\ndefendant will get a higher sentence. Before, he could\ntake advantage of the fact that he had -- you know, a\nparticular family situation; later, he could not.\nThat's a change in what the sentencing court must\nconsider and is to his prejudice.\nMR. KINNAIRD: I think, if it is simply a\nchange in the mix of factors, even the mandatory\nfactors, it wouldn't necessarily create a significant\nrisk. But the guidelines --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, under -- under\nour modification of the guidelines approach, isn't that\njust a list of factors that the Court should consider --\nor must consider?\nMR. KINNAIRD: Well, Your Honor, I think the\nguidelines are distinctive because they are the actual\nbenchmark, and they must -- and the starting point for\nany sentencing. It is critical at what range you\nstart your sentencing analysis, it's going to affect the\nanalysis, whether you're starting at a range of 20 to\n30 months or 120 --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is that -- is that what --\nwho says that they're the benchmark that you start with?\nWhere -- where is that writ?\nMR. KINNAIRD: That's in Gall, so that's\nin -- a construction -- what's implied in the sentencing\nformat.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: A court -- a court must\nbegin with that?\nMR. KINNAIRD: Yes. Yeah, that's the -- and\nthe court not only must begin with it, it must be\ncognizant of it throughout the process. And any --\nany --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So what if the --\nwhat if the law said the court must begin with a\ncomparison of what the average sentence is across the\ncountry, okay? And the data collection, over time,\nbecomes more sophisticated, and they can give you a more\naccurate number for what the average sentence is. And\nit turns out it's higher than what their informal survey\nwas before.\nIs that an ex post facto violation?\nMR. KINNAIRD: I don't think necessarily so,\nbut this is a -- a requirement to actually consider a\nrange. So if --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no. It'd be the\nsame -- it'd be the same thing. One of the things that\nthe Sentencing Commission considers is, of course, what\nthe average sentences were around the country. And\nlet's say that the law says that's something you have to\nconsider, and the technology or the range of -- of\njudges that they can survey becomes more sophisticated,\nthe number goes up.\nMR. KINNAIRD: I think it may be, if you had\nthe exact same Rita and Gall framework --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.\nMR. KINNAIRD: -- and that -- that framework\nis that that range actually is the benchmark and the --\nand the starting point. The district court must justify\nany deviation from that range -- and this is language\nfrom Gall -- with \"sufficiently compelling\njustifications to support the degree of the variance.\"\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And so the answer --\nMR. KINNAIRD: And it is then reviewed on\nappeal --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And so the answer to\nmy question is?\nMR. KINNAIRD: It would be -- I think it\nwould be likely if it were -- if it were within the same\nframework, if it's the mandatory benchmark with\nappellate review for substantive reasonableness and a\npresumption --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just -- I'm sorry.\nGo ahead.\nMR. KINNAIRD: And a presumption of -- of\nreasonableness on appeal would attach to that standard.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So just getting more\naccurate information violates the Ex Post Facto Clause,\nin the framework that you've set forth?\nMR. KINNAIRD: I think if it's -- if you\ncould -- if it's an actual -- well, I don't -- the\ndistinction I was trying to draw is that, if you\nactually -- if the -- if the statute has effectively\ndelegated the specification of a specific range, as\nopposed to just a data factor that might change over\ntime, and that's the key change in law here.\nAs I mentioned, 1998, had to consider 36 to\n47 months. With the guidelines amendment, the law\nchanged. He now must consider, for that offense and\noffender category, a range of 70 to 87 months, and --\nand -- as the mandatory benchmark. That's a change in\nthe law. And then you go to the test of significant\nrisk.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What if the -- what if the\nstatistics showed that nationwide only -- let's say,\n25 percent of defendants were being sentenced within the\nguideline range; would that change your argument?\nMR. KINNAIRD: I think it makes the -- well,\nwe have an argument that's specific to our sentencing.\nBut if the -- if in a particular case, a defendant were\nmaking an empirical analysis, that may diminish the\nchance of significant risk, but with a caveat because\nit's not just sentences within the guidelines range,\nit's the fact that the district court, even if it\nsentences out of the guidelines range, the ultimate\namount that it sentences to is going to be partially\ndetermined by that mandatory benchmark. And that --\nthat's an important point.\nAnd, as I said, the significant risk is a\nrisk of any increase in the quantum of punishment. So\nit's really is there a significant risk that, had he\nbeen -- had the old guidelines been in place as the\nbenchmark, that he would have gotten a sentence of less\nthan 60 -- 70 months. And -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, I think there's a fair\nchance that, as time goes by --\nMR. KINNAIRD: -- I think it's clear --\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- we're going to see fewer\nand fewer sentences within the guidelines. As judges\nwho began their careers during the guidelines, the\nmandatory guidelines era, leave the bench, new judges\ncome in who never had to deal with the mandatory\nguidelines, I think we're going to see fewer and fewer\nguidelines sentences.\nAnd -- and the percentages in some districts\nare -- are really quite striking. I'm told that, in the\nSouthern District -- or the Eastern District of New\nYork, now, only 30 percent of the defendants receive\nwithin-guidelines sentences.\nSo --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're assuming that's\nchanged over time.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, when I was on the\ncourt of appeals we thought it was our responsibility to\nensure that the district courts were complying with the\nSentencing Reform Act. That might not have been true\nacross the river, but --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It wasn't.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE ALITO: Let's say this case comes\nback in 20 years and the statistics show that --\nonly a distinct minority of defendants are being\nsentenced within the guidelines; would the case come out\ndifferently?\nMR. KINNAIRD: Perhaps, but, again, this is\nan as-applied challenge, so we look to current data.\nThere has been a very slight, gradual decline, but\nthere's still 80 percent of the sentences are either\nwithin the guidelines or they're below the guidelines\nrange, pursuant to a guidelines sanction departure\nmotion from the government.\nSo it's an -- even the Sentencing Commission\nattributes that relationship to the fact that it's the\ninitial starting point in the 2012 Booker report. So I\nthink it has a profound effect.\nNow, if the Court wanted to rule more\nnarrowly in this case on significant risk, it could.\nAnd it could adopt a rule that, when the new and the old\nguidelines ranges do not overlap at all, so that any\nsentence that would be in the new guidelines range would\nhave required an upward variance, and, here, a\n50 percent upward variance, those are as rare as hen's\nteeth in the -- in the district courts -- that at least\nshows, at a minimum, a significant risk, absent any\nindication that the judge, as the question was posed,\nwasn't going to apply them at all.\nHere, the judge specifically and expressly\ndeferred to the 2009 guidelines. So it's clear that the\nsignificant risk was increased by this change in the\nlaw.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Your -- your case depends,\nit seems to me, upon the proposition that significant\nrisk is only applicable at the sentencing stage. And\nI'm not sure that that's true. I mean, what -- why --\nwhy would that be so?\nWhat if -- what if you have a new law that\npermits evidence to come in, in a criminal trial, that\npreviously was not allowed to come in? Let's say the\ntestimony of a wife or -- or whatever. I think the law\nis pretty well established that that change in procedure\ndoes not violate the ex post facto law.\nAnd -- and your response to that is, well,\nthat's not sentencing; it's trial. So what? I mean,\nif -- certainly making a conviction more likely is -- is\neven worse than making a higher sentence more likely.\nMR. KINNAIRD: I think my response would be,\nYour Honor, that's not -- that particular change would\nnot be in the third category of Calder, the increase in\npunishment. That would be in the fourth category, in\nthe change of the evidence, where you don't even look to\nsignificant risk.\nBut I think the -- the change in punishment,\nat a minimum, it's the sentencing law of this kind --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And would it be ex post\nfacto in -- in the hypothetical Justice Scalia gave?\nMR. KINNAIRD: No, I don't think\nso because I think -- well, it may, depending on the\ncircumstances, be within the fourth category, but not\nunder the third. I think in the third --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can you just tell me the\nnarrow rule that you would propose --\nMR. KINNAIRD: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- getting back to\nJustice Scalia --\nMR. KINNAIRD: The narrow rule --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- which is\nprocedures-change risks. Having a victim testify at\nsentences -- at a sentence is likely, if you examined it\nstatistically, to increase -- increase the sentence.\nSo assume that's the set of hypotheticals.\nYou change it; now, victims can. Why is that not -- or\nis it an ex post facto change?\nMR. KINNAIRD: I don't think so because the\nCourt has generally excluded procedural changes, even if\nyou could show --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why is this not\nprocedural?\nMR. KINNAIRD: Because the --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Give me the rule where I\ncan draw a line between those changes that are\npermissible and those that are not, not the general\nstatement you're making because both increase the risk\nof a higher sentence.\nMR. KINNAIRD: Right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So it can't be that.\nMR. KINNAIRD: No. What Miller -- what\nMiller said -- in Miller v. Florida, the argument was\nmade that a change in the sentencing range, the\npresumptive range, was a change in procedure, and the\nCourt said, no, that's substantive. This is the\nsubstantive benchmark. That is applied. It's a\nsubstance standard.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that was in the --\nthat Florida case was the mandatory -- almost mandatory\nguideline, and I think our starting point is -- your\nstarting point, too -- is that, when the guidelines were\nmandatory, it was ex post facto because our decision in\nthe Florida case said it was.\nIs this sufficiently different now that the\nguidelines are advisory rather than mandatory?\nMR. KINNAIRD: No, Your Honor. I think it\nwould still be a substantive standard, regardless of\nwhether it's binding or -- or whether it's advisory.\nIt's still a substantive standard. So, if it's a change\nin the substantive sentencing law, you go to significant\nrisk analysis.\nAnd there you either look to the inherent\nrisk -- and I think there is an inherent risk in this\nframework, that there's going to be some increase of\nsome quantum of punishment beyond what they would have\ndone if they'd applied the older guidelines as the\nmandatory benchmark.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But saying that the\nsentencer has to consider testimony from the victim or\nfrom relatives of the deceased, that -- that change in\nsentencing law is okay?\nMR. KINNAIRD: Under the fact that it's\nconsidered a procedural law, not substantive.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It pertains to sentencing.\nIt -- it says what the sentencing authority, the judge\nor the jury, must consider.\nMR. KINNAIRD: Well -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This is evidence brought\nbefore the sentencer.\nMR. KINNAIRD: Well -- yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't see any difference\nbetween that and saying that the -- the guidelines have\nto be considered by the sentencer.\nMR. KINNAIRD: Well, I may have misheard\nyour -- your hypothetical. In that case, it may very\nwell be a sentencing -- a sentencing law, it may pass\nthat threshold, and then you go to significant risk. I\nwould say significant risk is more difficult to\ndetermine than in this particular case, where you have\nthe actual starting point, an actual number, which has a\n--\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're answering me\ndifferently now?\nMR. KINNAIRD: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're answering me\ndifferently? I posed exactly the question that\nJustice Scalia --\nMR. KINNAIRD: I -- I may have misheard,\nYour Honor. If --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I said the sentencing --\nthe assumptions I made were the sentencing law changes,\nvictims must testify, judges must consider what they\nsay, and, after 5 years, it's proven that, when victims\nspeak, the sentences are higher. Is that a substantive\nor a procedural law?\nMR. KINNAIRD: Well, I think Miller did draw\na distinction. There are procedures that are involved\nin sentencing, and I'm not sure if the Court's\nprocedure-substance cases have drawn that distinction.\nIf it --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But I'm asking you to\ndraw it. So tell me, what's the rule? Do you want\nsomething as broad that says even that kind of change\ncan be an ex post facto? And, if you don't, articulate\nhow I draw the line.\nMR. KINNAIRD: I think -- I think the Court\ncould draw the line simply on substantive standards that\nare applied. But, if the Court were to go the other\ndirection, significant risk --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What does that mean to\nyou? The number of years in jail?\nMR. KINNAIRD: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is that as limited as\nyou want it to be?\nMR. KINNAIRD: Well, it could be. I mean --\nor at least -- you know, if it's a mandatory sentencing\nfactor, something like that, as opposed to -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, we know that's\nMiller.\nMR. KINNAIRD: Right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: This is not Miller.\nMR. KINNAIRD: Well, but even the -- there\nare -- there are sentencing factors that are mandatory\nother than the guidelines range.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I would have thought you\nwould have gone back to Calder and Bull. And Calder and\nBull, which this Court refers to all the time, in these\nkinds of cases, has four categories, and the only one\nthat fits this case is a law that changes the\npunishment --\nMR. KINNAIRD: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- and inflicts a greater\npunishment than the law annexed to the crime when\ncommitted. So whatever these other hypotheticals are,\nthey do not involve -- they are not laws that change the\npunishment, but yours is a law that changes the\npunishment.\nMR. KINNAIRD: It is a law that changes --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Does it \"affix a higher\npunishment,\" in the words of Calder v. Bull?\nMR. KINNAIRD: I think it --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think that's a\nquestion at all. The answer to that is quite easy. It\ndoes not affix a higher punishment, does it?\nMR. KINNAIRD: But -- but the Court in\nGarner, in Lynce, have equated that with increased risk\nof significant punishment. And that -- the importance\nof Garner is that it recognizes that the Ex Post Facto\nClause --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. Then rely on Garner,\nbut not on Calder v. Bull.\nMR. KINNAIRD: Yes. I think -- I think --\nbut Garner is applying that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I wouldn't concede that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That doesn't help --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. KINNAIRD: Okay. So what Garner -- what\nGarner does say is that you look to the significant\nrisk. And it's important for ex post facto -- ex post\nfacto jurisprudence because the exercise of discretion\ncan't displace ex post facto protections. You have to\nlook to the effect on the actual punishment.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Could you remind me --\nit's in the briefs -- if a sentence is appealed, what is\nthe review authority of the appellate court? It must\nbegin with the guidelines as the framework?\nMR. KINNAIRD: The review authority is to\nreview for both procedural and substantive\nreasonableness. So procedural, I think, has been\ninterpreted to look at whether there was a correct\ncalculation, whether they -- they did not treat it as\nmandatory, that they considered it as the benchmark and\nthe --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But isn't the important\npoint, Mr. Kinnaird, that there's a presumption of\ncorrectness that attaches to guidelines sentences on\nappeal --\nMR. KINNAIRD: Yes.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: -- that does not attach to\nnon-guidelines sentences?\nMR. KINNAIRD: Yes. I was getting to that,\nYour Honor.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I mean, this has, one would\nthink, great legal consequence.\nMR. KINNAIRD: It is. And the second step\nis substantive reasonableness review, and the Court has\nheld that an appellate presumption of reasonableness may\nattach, so that -- it attaches only to this guideline\nrange. And that makes the risk of reversal higher if\nyou -- if you go outside the guidelines --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do you -- do you know what\nthe statistics are as to the number of below-guidelines\nsentences each year that are reversed by the courts of\nappeals on the ground that they are not reasonable?\nMR. KINNAIRD: Well, I think that they are\nfairly low -- I don't know the precise statistics -- I\nbelieve they're low for defendant appeals. But when --\npartly, you're worried about here is -- is the\ngovernment going to appeal. They don't appeal very\noften, but they have a high rate of --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Yes. I mean, I'm told that\nit's in the single digits.\nMR. KINNAIRD: I believe the -- yes, it may\nbe -- I don't know if that -- it's not a great number,\nbut they prevail when they do. And it -- and it does\nhave some effect, but I think the Court --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry, who\nprevails? The government or the --\nMR. KINNAIRD: The government tends to\nprevail when it brings, it's -- but -- you know, that's\na potential deterrent effect. But, even the fact of\nsubstantive reasonableness review, you have to have\nreasons, you have to be able to -- to justify your\ndeviations --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Have you had -- are you\naware of any circuit court case, in recent time, where a\ncircuit has reversed the lower range than the guideline,\nbasically because the deviation from the guideline was\nunreasonable?\nMR. KINNAIRD: I'm not sure. I haven't\nreviewed all those cases, Your Honor. I'm not sure.\nSo the -- returning to the -- the question\nof this particular sentencing, I think if the Court were\nto rule on a narrower ground, based on non-overlapping\nranges, which is not going to be particularly common,\nhere, is unquestionably a significant risk. You\nhave a defendant who, prior to this course of conduct,\nhad lived an exemplary life.\nHis threshold -- his -- the loss in his case\nbarely crawled into the 2.5 to 5 million. It\nwas about 40,000 over 2.5 million. And the district\ncourt sentenced at the bottom of the guidelines range,\nagreeing with the policy of increasing sentences with\nthe amount of loss. That same policy was present, but\nnot the same level of increase, in the 1998 guidelines.\nSo I think there's clearly, as applied to\nhis sentence, the significant risk he would not have\ngotten 70 months, which would have been an upward\nvariance of 50 -- of -- of 50 percent from the old\nguidelines range.\nAnd -- but I think, if the Court does wish\nto consider the broader ruling, I think it's also true\nthat it is inherent in this system, in the Rita and Gall\nframework, which provide for a mandatory benchmark,\nwhich provide for the substantive reasonableness review,\nthat you're going to have some significant risk of some\nincreased quantum of punishment as a -- as a result of\nthis change in law.\nI'd like to reserve the rest of my time for\nrebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Feigin?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC J. FEIGIN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. FEIGIN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThis Court made clear, in Miller v. Florida,\nthat an Ex Post Facto Law has to change \"the legal\nconsequences of a prior act.\" A guidelines amendment\ndoesn't do that. A district court has the same\nauthority and the same --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why are you fighting\nthis proposition? If the starting point doesn't matter,\nwhy didn't you stick to your old position, that judges\nshould start from the old one and simply consider the\nnew one? Why this whole Supreme Court case?\nMR. FEIGIN: Well -- well, Your Honor, we -\nwe opposed certiorari largely on that ground. We don't\nthink the guidelines impose a constraint on a district\ncourt's exercise of sentencing discretion; that is, if a\njudge decides that a guidelines range that the\nCommission has suggested at some other time suggests a\nmore appropriate sentence or if the judge believes that\nsome sentence that's unrelated to any guidelines range\nis the most appropriate sentence, the judge has\ndiscretion to impose that sentence.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Practically speaking, do\nyou believe it makes no difference?\nMR. FEIGIN: Your Honor, I freely believe\nthat the guidelines are very influential to many\ndistrict judges and district judges often agree with the\nguidelines. They often impose sentences within the\nguidelines range or close to the guidelines range. But\nthere --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: This is a change -- your\nposition is -- is a change, at least in the position\nthat the government took in -- in the Seventh Circuit\ncase that started all this. The government confessed\nerror.\nThe government said the district judge\nshould have used the guidelines that were in effect at\nthe time the offense was committed, and the government\ncame to the Seventh Circuit and confessed error.\nSo there was not even an argument until the\nSeventh Circuit and Judge Posner wrote the opinion that\nincluded all the hypotheticals that -- that were aired\nearlier about the victim impact statement and all of\nthose are in that opinion. So it was only after --\nafter the Seventh Circuit opinion that the government\nchanged its position.\nMR. FEIGIN: Your Honor, the government\nchanged its position in response to this Court's\ndecisions in Gall, Kimbrough, and Irizarry because,\nbefore those decisions came out, there was an argument\nthat the guidelines still imposed some substantive legal\nconstraint on a district court's sentencing discretion.\nAfter Gall, Kimbrough, and Irizarry, after Nelson and\nSpears, that argument no longer exists.\nRita makes clear that district courts cannot\npresume a guidelines range to be reasonable. Irizarry\nmakes clear that a defendant is constitutionally on\nnotice that he can get sentenced anywhere within the\nstatutory range.\nAnd Gall makes clear that courts of appeals\nshould apply the same deferential standard of review to\nevery sentence, regardless whether it falls within the\nguidelines range, just outside the guidelines range, or\nfar outside the guidelines range.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The guidelines range gets\na presumption of reasonableness at the appellate level.\nMR. FEIGIN: That's right, Your Honor, and I\nthink Rita actually supports our position, not\nPetitioner's. The Court made clear in Rita that the\npresumption of reasonableness on appeal that this --\nthat courts of appeals can choose to apply, but need\nnot, has no legal effect.\nRather, it reflects the commonsense\nproposition that when the Commission recommends a\nparticular sentencing range as to a particular class of\ndefendants and the district court, in its discretion,\nactually imposes the sentence within that range, that\nthe sentence is likely to be reasonable.\nThe entire premise behind the presumption of\nreasonableness that was adopted in Rita is that district\ncourts are, in fact, exercising their discretion when\nthey impose sentences, and that's the same premise on\nwhich we'd ask you to decide this case.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What is the reason that\nmiscalculating a guideline is considered a procedural\nerror?\nMR. FEIGIN: Your Honor, it's very\nclear, from 3553(a)(4), that Congress wants district\ncourts to start with the right mix of information, which\nincludes the most up-to-date recommendation of the\nSentencing Commission.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That begs the question.\nObviously, if we hold it's a procedural error to\nmiscalculate the guidelines, using the guidelines has\nsome significant importance in the process.\nMR. FEIGIN: It has importance, Your Honor,\nand as I've said before, they can be very influential to\njudges, but the reason why it's an error if -- to\nmiscalculate the guidelines is not because the\nguidelines impose any substantive constraint on the\ndistrict court's discretion.\nAfter reversal for miscalculating the\nguidelines, the judge is free to impose the same\nsentence anyway, and there's no constraint on the\njudge's discretion that arises from the guidelines\nframe.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But what that suggests is\nthat the guidelines are -- serve as an anchor and are\nsupposed to serve as an anchor and that the reason why\nthe miscalculation is error is because you've picked the\nwrong anchor and that's going to affect or -- or has a\nsignificant likelihood of affecting your ultimate\ndecision.\nAnd isn't that, really, what we've\nsuggested? Is the way the guidelines ought to work and\nthe way you think the guidelines ought to work, that it\nserves as an anchor for sentencing decisions; yes, you\ncan vary, you can deviate, but it's your anchor.\nMR. KINNAIRD: Your Honor, there are two\nthings you could mean when you use the word \"anchor.\"\nOne, you could mean that there's some sort of legal\nanchor, and we think that the Court's decisions that\nI've just described, in particular, the Court's repeated\ninsistence that district courts cannot presume a\nguidelines range to be reasonable, means the district\ncourts cannot treat them as a legal anchor.\nSecond, you might be suggesting that they\nserve as some sort of psychological anchor. That's not\na concern of the Ex Post Facto Clause. The Ex Post\nFacto Clause doesn't guarantee defendants a right to a\njudge who has a particular sentencing philosophy --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I think I'm saying more than\nit's all in your head. I think I'm saying you start in\na particular place, you have to get the particular place\nright. The appellate court looks at the particular\nplace that you've started and, if you -- if you've ended\nup there, has to grant a presumption of reasonableness.\nBut the rules are all geared towards saying,\nyes, you can deviate, but you have to understand that\nthere's -- that deviation requires some kind of thought\nprocess and some kind of reason. Otherwise, this is\nwhere you should be.\nMR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, the Court\nmade clear in Pepper, two terms ago, that the district\ncourt's overarching legal duty is to impose a sentence\nsufficient, but not greater than necessary, to meet the\nstatutory purposes of sentencing in Section 3553(a)(2).\nThe guidelines are one of several factors\nthat inform the district court's exercise of discretion.\nIf a district court treats the guidelines as some sort\nof legal constraint this Court's decisions say it\ncan't be treated as, that would be statutory error --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, it isn't, but that, I\nthink, is an undecided question at best. If you won the\ncase on that ground, I would say that what the\nguidelines and the Sentencing Commission are best at,\ngathering information from across the country, and\nsaying a typical person who commits this crime in a\ntypical way should be sentenced to the typical range\nthat applies -- let's say 18 to 24 months.\nThat would be down the drain. And I think\nthat Rita, in fact, and the other cases have, at the\nvery most, left open and maybe decided against you the\nquestion of when a court of appeals gets the sentence\nfrom a judge who does not apply the guideline because he\ndoesn't like the policy judgment.\nThat's a different matter from when he\napplies it then when he thinks he shouldn't apply it\nbecause the person in front of him doesn't meet the --\nthe policy conditions. Those are different. The\nCommission has the expertise in the first, the judge in\nthe second. And so there is at least a question as to\nwhether the court of appeals should give more leeway to\nthe guidelines in the first and more leeway to the judge\nin the second.\nNow, I think Rita is consistent with that,\nand I think every opinion we have written is consistent\nwith that. And I'd hate to see that suddenly decided\nand changed in a way I think is inappropriate in this\ncase. So have you all thought that through?\nAnd is the position of the government, now,\nthat we think the guidelines, even if it's a policy\nmatter that they have gathered evidence on, are entitled\nto nothing, if they run across a district judge who\nhappens to think, though he was an outlier, that the\noutliers were right as a matter of policy, which, of\ncourse, will always be true. Every judge who is an\noutlier thinks the outliers are right. Otherwise, why\nwould he do it? You see?\nNow, I didn't know that issue was in this\ncase and that changes the case dramatically for me. And\nI thought we could decide this just on the ground that\nthis is a law that changes punishment. It's a law.\nIt's a regulation.\nAnd Justice Scalia, I thought, was\ncompletely right. The question is whether it inflicts\ngreater punishment. And there is a test on that, and\nthe controlling inquiry is whether retroactive\napplication of a change in a law that affects punishment\ncreated a sufficient risk of increasing the measure of\npunishment attached. All right? And that's -- that's\nwhat I thought the -- the framework of law was in this\ncase.\nNow, this is sort of tough for you on oral\nargument because I'm just, perhaps, bringing it all up\nto get it all out there and see what you think.\nMR. FEIGIN: Let me start at the end there,\nJustice Breyer --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I disagree with all that,\nby the way.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor,\nJustice Breyer, beginning with what you said at the end\nthere, I think it's -- it would be inappropriate to\nuntether the significant risk test from the requirement\nthat there be an ex post facto law; that is, there has\nto be a significant legal risk, a risk that is traceable\nto some sort of change in the decision maker's authority\nwith respect to sentencing, and we don't have that here.\nA district court has the same authority and\nthe same obligation to impose an appropriate sentence\nthe day after the guidelines are amended as the judge\nhad the day before the guidelines are amended. And any\njudge who forgets that is going to be committing\nstatutory error, and the sentence could be reversed on\nappeal for violating the Booker remedy.\nAnd that's --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But when -- when it comes\nto the court of appeals, that's different. The court of\nappeals begins with a framework of whether or not it's\nwithin the guidelines. That's how it begins to measure\nthe exercise of discretion.\nMR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, as I -- as\nI've explained, the reason why courts -- the only way in\nwhich courts of appeals can apply a different standard\nof review to a sentence, depending on where it falls in\nthe guidelines range, is the presumption of\nreasonableness the Court recognized in Rita.\nAnd I think Rita makes quite clear that that\nis a practical presumption. That is, it simply\nacknowledges the common-sense proposition that when a\ndistrict court, exercising its discretion, reaches a\njudgment that accords with the Commission's expertise,\nit's likely that sentence is reasonable.\nI don't think --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You know, there is a lot\nof dispute, now, about the child pornography sentences.\nLet's assume -- and this goes back to Justice Breyer's\nquestion -- a judge comes in and says, I know child\npornography is criminal, but I don't think what the\nguidelines are imposing are fair, to any defendant, so\n10 days in jail.\nWhy would that be substantively\nunreasonable?\nMR. FEIGIN: Your Honor, it would depend on\nthe individual circumstances of the particular case --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, I'm giving you\nexactly what the judge says. You don't think that the\nappellate court would say that's substantively\nunreasonable because it's not giving due deference to\nthe Commission's assessment of the seriousness of this\ncrime?\nMR. FEIGIN: I think the court of appeals\nmight say that it's substantively unreasonable because\nit's a very, very low sentence, even in comparison to\nthe --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I assume that the statute\nis one that permits 10 days, right?\nMR. FEIGIN: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's sort of an unusual\nstatute, but, if the hypothetical is in the real world,\nthe statute provides -- you know, 10 days to life, okay?\nAnd the judge thinks 10 days is okay. I think that's\nthe hypothetical.\nMR. FEIGIN: And, Your Honor, in that case,\nit is possible a court of appeals would decide that that\nis substantively unreasonable. It's possible a court of\nappeals might reference the guidelines. But the reason\nwhy the court of appeals would find it substantively\nunreasonable is because, as a whole, it is substantively\nunreasonable and not because it varies too far from the\nguidelines.\nI also want to emphasize --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you disagree with --\ngetting back to what this case is about, the D.C.\nCircuit, in opposition to the Seventh Circuit said, it\nis enough that using the new guideline created a\nsubstantial risk that the defendant's sentence was more\nsevere than it would have been if the guidelines in\neffect at the time of the crime were used.\nAnd is it -- there is no doubt that this\ncase fits that description. There was quite a\nsubstantial risk that the elevated guidelines would\nresult in a more severe sentence.\nMR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, there are two\ncomplaints that Petitioner could be making about his\nparticular sentencing. One could be that he thinks the\njudge treated the guidelines too deferentially as a\nlegal matter. And, if that's what he believes, his\nremedy is a claim of statutory error under Booker. He's\nnever made that claim.\nThe other claim --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: He's saying that -- the\nquestion is which guidelines in this case? And he's\nsaying it's the guidelines in effect at the time he\ncommitted the crime. We are not dealing with other -- I\nmean, it's quite a simple choice.\nIs it -- does the court start with the\nguidelines in effect at the time the crime was\ncommitted? Or does it start with the guidelines in\neffect at the time of sentencing?\nMR. FEIGIN: And whichever set of guidelines\nthe district court started with, it had discretion and,\nin fact, the obligation to impose the appropriate\nsentence under 3553(a). Now --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: We know that this\ndistrict judge, he didn't want to get into any\nphilosophical things about what was better or what was\nworse. He said, I want to follow the guidelines. So\nthe question for him was only which guideline.\nHe got his answer from the Seventh Circuit.\nThey said the guidelines at the time of sentencing. A\njudge in the D.C. District Court will get the other\nanswer, the guidelines in effect at the time the crime\nwas committed.\nMR. FEIGIN: Your Honor, Petitioner argued\nin this case that the former guidelines range suggested\na more appropriate sentence than the 2009 guidelines\nrange. The district court considered that argument, and\nit rejected it. And defendants are always free to raise\nthat argument.\nIf I could go back to Justice Sotomayor's\nchild pornography hypothetical --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's not -- it's not\na question of whether the judge thought that the one\nguideline was better than the other. He specifically\nsaid he wasn't interested in that question. The\nquestion was which guideline does he follow? Which -\nwhat does he start with? And you recognize that you do\nstart with the guidelines.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes, I agree with Justice\nGinsburg's follow-up question. It seems to me you\navoided the question. You said, oh, well, the judge\nlooked at all this and selected the sentence he did.\nBut he did so because he referred to the later\nguidelines, and I think that you have to recognize that.\nUnless -- unless I'm --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think you are saying\nit doesn't matter if they are advisory --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'd like to finish.\nUnless I am wrong under the record.\nMR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, on the\nrecord, I think, if you look at the full sentencing\ntranscript, which is in the Joint Appendix, you will see\nthat one of the questions the judge had to answer was\nwhich set of guidelines were provided -- were the set of\nguidelines that he had to calculate under\n3553(A)(4)(a)(2).\nAnd then there was a separate section in\nwhich he considered the argument that the 2009\nguidelines were too harsh. If you look at the\nsentencing memorandum that Petitioner filed in this\ncase, it argued that the increase of loss amounts in the\nfraud guidelines was too harsh, that judges often\nimposed sentences that are under the guidelines, and the\ndistrict court should do so here.\nThe district court considered that\nargument and rejected that.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the district court\nwas following orders. He was following the Seventh\nCircuit. The Seventh Circuit had said, you start with\nthe higher guidelines.\nMR. FEIGIN: Justice Ginsburg, it's --\nthe Court considers these as two separate questions, one\nis which is the set of guidelines I'm required to\ncalculate under Section 3553(a), and, second, having\ncalculated those guidelines, what sentence should I\nimpose, with the guidelines as one of the factors that\nthe Court considers.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Feigin, you're sounding\nawfully like according deference to the guidelines\ncounts as reversible error.\nMR. FEIGIN: No, Your Honor, that's not what\nI'm trying to say. I'm saying treating the guidelines\nas some sort of legal constraint on the district court's\nsentencing discretion is reversible error. Now, if the\ndistrict court chooses, in its own discretion, to give\nweight to the guidelines, that's within the realm of\nchoice that 3553(a) provides.\nThere are many circumstances --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It is reversible error, is\nit not, simply to blindly apply the guidelines without\nconsidering the factors in 3553? That's reversible,\nisn't it?\nMR. FEIGIN: That's correct, Your Honor.\nAnd, Justice Kagan --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But, surely, you do not want\njudges living in a world where they think that they\ncannot give deference to the guidelines, isn't that\nright? You want them to give appropriate deference to\nthe guidelines, isn't that correct?\nMR. FEIGIN: Your Honor, we want them to\nfind the guidelines persuasive and influential. We\nrecognize that, under this Court's decisions, they\ncannot treat the guidelines as a legal constraint on\ntheir sentencing discretion. If a judge follows the\nguidelines, that's because the judge is exercising its\ndiscretion to decide that a guideline's range sentence\nis appropriate in that particular case.\nNow, there are many instances in which\njudges choose not to do that. So if I -- for example,\nJustice Sotomayor brought up child pornography. In\nfiscal year 2012, a defendant for a non-production child\npornography offense, that is, receipt or possession of\nchild pornography, was substantially more likely to get\na nongovernment-sponsored below-range sentence than to\nget a within-range sentence; 48.4 percent\nnongovernment-sponsored below-range, 32.7 percent within\nrange.\nIf we want to talk about fraud for a minute,\nwhich is what the Petitioner in this case was charged\nwith, if you look at page 67 of the Commission's\npost-Booker report -- and I'd encourage the Court to\nread that report in full -- because it makes very clear\nthe variations in sentencing practices among --\ndepending on the crime, depending on the particular\ncircuit, depending on the particular district, and even\ndepending on the particular judge.\nI believe --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Was Judge Randolph wrong\nwhen he said -- quoting the Sentencing Commission --\nthat within-guidelines range, even after Booker, is the\nstandard? Indeed, the actual impact of Booker on\nsentencing has been minor, and, for that minor, he cites\nthe Sentencing Commission.\nMR. FEIGIN: So, Your Honor, I think the\npost-Booker report refutes that in the respect I just\nsuggested. It says that there are actually very\ndifferent sentencing practices, depending on the\nparticular crime, depending on the particular judge.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But this statement comes\nfrom Final Report on the Impact of the United\nStates v. Booker on Federal Sentencing.\nMR. FEIGIN: Your Honor, the Commission says\nmany things in its report. One of the things it says is\nthat, in the aggregate, guidelines do -- actual\nsentences do tend to track the guidelines.\nBut, if you look beyond that one aggregate\nstatistic and you start to look at the variations in\nsentencing practices in courts across the nation that\nvary, not only by judge, but by guideline, you see that\nthe system is actually operating the way you'd\nexpect to --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I see -- I see, now, where\nyou're going. What I think you're saying is, whatever\nthe sentence is, I am the judge, I read the guidelines.\nNow, I may think that I am more likely to get reversed\nif I -- I substitute a different view than the\nCommission had on a matter of policy. That's all true.\nBut, still, I don't have to do it. No\nmatter what it is, I can not use the guidelines. And,\nif I get reversed on other grounds, or the sentence is\nnot reasonable, da, da, da, da, da. But there's no\nlegal binding nature there. That's your point, I think.\nMR. FEIGIN: That's exactly my point, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. If that's\nexactly your point --\nMR. FEIGIN: I'd like to add two -- two\nobservations to that, first of which is, as an empirical\nmatter, it is extremely unlikely for a sentence to get\nreversed on substantive reasonableness grounds.\nThe Commission's post-Booker report -- and\nI'm talking about the one that they just issued a few\nweeks ago that's cited in the reply brief -- states that\nsubstantive unreasonableness reversals are very rare.\nPetitioner, on page 30 of his brief, cites a database\nthat contains 38 such reversals post-Gall.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. But, now, I can\nnarrow what the question I think is.\nMR. FEIGIN: And the second point I'd like\nto make, Your Honor, with respect to that, is that I\ndon't think this Court should assume that district\ncourts are actually going to change what sentences they\nimpose and not impose the sentence they believe is\nsufficient, but no greater than necessary, to meet the\npurposes of sentencing, just because they --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but that -- that\ngets back to -- to your argument. You're -- I sense\nthat you want me to leave the bench saying the\nguidelines just don't make any difference. Suppose\nthe -- suppose the district judge said, you know, if it\nwere just up to me, I would give this lower sentence,\nbut the guidelines are an important institutional part\nof our system.\nUniformity in sentencing is desirable. For\nus to take into account the experience of other -- of\nother courts and what the Sentencing Commission does is\nvery important. Therefore, my discretion is guided by\nthese guidelines.\nMR. FEIGIN: Your Honor, I absolutely --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You don't want me -- you\ndon't want me to say that.\nMR. FEIGIN: I absolutely do not want you to\nleave the bench with the impression that the guidelines\nare unimportant. I want you to leave the bench with the\nimpression that the guidelines don't impose any legal\nconstraint on a judge's exercise of discretion.\nDifferent judges -- not only does it vary by guideline,\nbut --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Feigin, take -- take\nthis example: Let's suppose that there's a crime and\nthe punishment for crime is 5 years to life, all right?\nNow, Congress passes a statute, and it says,\nno, we think this crime, now, is much more important\nthan we used to; now, it's 25 years to life, right? A\nperson commits the offense prior to that change.\nAbsolutely obvious case, right, that you have to apply\nthe -- the 5 years to life, right?\nObvious, correct?\nMR. FEIGIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Okay. Now, the Sentencing\nCommission does what the Sentencing Commission always\ndoes when there is a legislative change like this. It\nsays, well, we have this guidelines that assumes 5 years\nto life. We have to change our guidelines because, now,\nit's 25 years to life. And it passes a guideline\namendment which completely conforms to the legislative\namendment.\nBut you're saying, no, the 25-year-to-life\nguideline is the appropriate one to implement, even\nthough the 5-year statute is the appropriate one to\nimplement -- is the appropriate one to give effect to.\nIs that -- can that possibly be right?\nMR. FEIGIN: Your Honor, I think I'm saying\nsomething slightly different. I think, under 3553(a),\nthe Court would calculate the current guidelines. Now,\nthe defendant would have a very good argument in that\ncase, that the current guidelines range would simply not\nbe appropriate for him, and I think a district court\nwould do well to listen to that argument in that\nparticular case, if it thought that the sentences that\nthe new guidelines range was suggesting were out of\nwhack with the statute at the time the offense was\ncommitted.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Feigin, I'm under the\nimpression -- more than the impression I know -- that\nthe Sentencing Commission can make a revision of the\nguidelines retroactive.\nCan it only do that for revisions that --\nthat lower the -- the suggested penalty? Or can it do\nthat for revisions that increase it as well?\nMR. FEIGIN: I believe it's only for\nrevisions that lower --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Only for lower, okay.\nMR. FEIGIN: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Because, if it could\nincrease it, then it would be violating, according to\nyour -- your friend, the Ex Post Facto Clause.\nMR. FEIGIN: And, Your Honor, getting back\nto how the -- the advisory guidelines are working in\npractice for a minute -- which, again, is I don't think\nwhat this -- what the focus should be. The focus should\nbe on whether there's actually been a change in the law\nthat either increases or decreases a sentencer's\ndiscretion.\nIf you imagine two States, for example, each\nof which had exactly the same advisory guidelines system\nthat the Federal government has and, in one of them,\njudges are -- you know, tend to find the guidelines very\npersuasive, they sentence within the guidelines 70\npercent of the time. In the other one, judges\nexercising their discretion don't find the guidelines\nvery persuasive, and they sentence within the guidelines\n10 percent of the time.\nI don't think it makes sense that, under the\nexact same legal regime, an amendment to the guidelines\nin one State would be an Ex Post Facto Law and an\namendment to the guidelines in the other State wouldn't\nbe an Ex Post Facto Law.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But your -- your statement\nto me was -- and to us earlier -- was that the -- there\nis no legal constraint on the exercise of discretion. I\nagree, the judge -- everybody knows the judge can go\nlower, but that overlooks the fact that discretion is\ndefined by legal standards. That's how we begin to\nthink about discretion.\nThat's how appellate courts weigh\ndiscretion. And, again, you want to give the guidelines\nno effect in determining how that discretion is shaped,\nguided and exercised.\nMR. FEIGIN: Your Honor, they are a factor.\nThey're a factor under 3553(a). They're a factor that\nthe district court has to consider. But they don't\nthemselves in any way, shape, or form constrain the\ndistrict court's exercise of discretion. A district\ncourt can decide that -- not to impose a guidelines\nsentence.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Would you accept the fact\nthat they define the discretion, even though they don't\nconstrain it?\nMR. FEIGIN: Your Honor, I wouldn't say they\ndefine the discretion either. I think they are a\nrecommendation and information that informs the exercise\nof discretion --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if -- I'm\nsorry.\nAre you finished?\nMR. FEIGIN: I'm happy to be, Your Honor.\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: A good -- good\nadvocate.\nLet's say you had a statute -- not a\nguideline, a statute -- that said a sentence for a\nparticular offense will be 5 years, but the judge can\nlower it to 4 years, if he thinks it would be a manifest\ninjustice to sentence to 5 years. That provision is\nlater repealed.\nNow, it just says that the sentence should\nbe 5 years. Does that violate the Ex Post Facto Clause?\nMR. FEIGIN: I think it might well violate\nthe Ex Post Facto Clause, Your Honor, because, in that\ncase, you have something we don't have here, which is\nthat the decision maker has less discretion than the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No matter how\nnarrow -- no matter how narrow the original grant of\ndiscretion is? In other words, only in the case of\nmanifest injustice or however dramatic you want to limit\nthe available discretion.\nMR. FEIGIN: The reason I -- the reason I\nsaid \"might well\" is I think, at that point, the Court\nwould have to look at the significance of the increase\nor decrease in the sentencer's authority and decide\nwhether that was a significant enough increase or\ndecrease to trigger the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How would -- how\nwould a court --\nMR. FEIGIN: -- the Ex Post Facto Clause.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. How would a\ncourt go about answering that question?\nMR. FEIGIN: I think that's where the\nsignificant risk test comes in. And, under the\nsignificant risk test, you can either see whether it\nfacially has that effect -- we know that's not true of\nthe Federal Sentencing Guidelines because the Court's\nmade clear they don't impose any legal constraints. Or\nyou could see whether it has that effect as applied\nunder Garner.\nBut We know that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it's a\nstatistical evaluation of the kind we were talking\nabout. You look, and you say, well, it's only once in a\nblue moon that a judge invokes the manifest injustice\nprovision, so it's not increasing the risk.\nOn the other hand, well, every four out of\nfive judges do, and, therefore, it is an increase. Is\nthat how you --\nMR. FEIGIN: I think it's fundamental -- the\ndecision in Garner doesn't precisely describe exactly\nhow the significant risk inquiry works. I think it is,\nfundamentally, a legal inquiry because the bottom-line\nquestion the Court's always trying to answer is whether\nthere has been an ex post facto law.\nAnd I think, to the extent it's okay to look\nat empirical data -- and I don't think the Court in\nGarner expressly says that that's the kind of data it\nwas contemplating -- it would be to inform how the legal\nframework actually operates in practice.\nAnd, if the Court found it necessary to look\nat that here, in the -- the post-Booker report makes\nclear that sentencing practices vary over the districts,\nover the circuits, and with respect to particular\nguidelines.\nSo Justice Alito brought up the example of\nthe Eastern District of New York. We don't have to look\nany further than the Northern District of Illinois,\nwhere Petitioner was sentenced here, where the latest\n2012 statistics that came out on Friday show that the\ndefendant actually has a slightly higher probability --\nvery slightly higher probability -- of getting a\nnon-government-sponsored below-range sentence than of\ngetting a sentence within the guidelines range.\nI think all these variances show two things.\nOne, they show that the system is working exactly as\nyou'd expect an advisory system to work; and, two, I\nthink they show that some sort of narrow focus on\nempirical data, which is what you are left with, once\nyou divorce the ex post facto inquiry from a change in\nlaw, is inherently unworkable.\nYou have to --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Feigin, I think\nmore goes into it than empirics. But there's this\nunbelievable chart, really, in one of the green briefs\nabout -- you know, where there's one line, which is what\nhappens to the guidelines, and there's this other line,\nwhich is what happens to the sentence, and they follow\neach other identically, exactly.\nYou can't get a chart that looks better\nfrom this than -- from Mr. Kinnaird's point of view.\nMR. FEIGIN: So let me say two things in\nresponse to that, Your Honor. If you look in the\npost-Booker report, they have charts like that, that are\nbroken down by offense --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can finish your\nsentence.\nMR. FEIGIN: If you look at fraud and you\nlook at child pornography, they deviate when they go --\nwhen the guidelines' suggestion goes up, the sentences\ndon't go up in accordance with that, at the same level\nof the chart you are looking at.\nThank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Kinnaird, you have 3 minutes left.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN B. KINNAIRD\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. KINNAIRD: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nFive quick points. First, the government\nsays this must be an overt legal restraint to be within\nthe Ex Post Facto Clause. This Court has repeatedly, in\nWeaver and other cases, said it's the effect of the\nchange of law, not its form, that matters for ex post\nfacto purposes, the effect on punishment.\nAnd what this revision and amendment of the\nmandatory benchmark did was to alter the legal framework\nin a way that channeled and redefined the exercise of\ndiscretion in the direction of greater punishment.\nSecondly, what range is the -- is the\nmandatory benchmark under the statute matters greatly,\nas Justice Kennedy alluded to, to appellate review for\nsubstantive reasonableness. You have -- it's the key\nfactor in determining whether a sentence is reasonable,\nand it's the standard to which a presumption of\nreasonableness may attach.\nThird, as far as the record, there's --\nthere's no analysis in the record of the 1998\nguidelines, other than to -- to set them aside. And --\nand what you have to have, under the Constitution, is he\nhas to actually apply those as the statute required at\nthe time of the offense, as the mandatory benchmark.\nInstead, he's quite clear, he's applying the\n'98 guidelines. He's deferring to the -- to the policy\njudgments there and to the loss calculations. So it had\na clear substantive effect on his risk of greater\npunishment.\nThe post-Booker report does have those --\nthose charts that show that, for all offenses and for\nfraud offenses, when the guidelines' minimum goes up,\nthe average sentences go up, and that's a very\ncompelling point of evidence.\nAnd, finally, I would point out here that\none of the amendments here was actually a response of\nthe Commission to a congressional directive in the wake\nof the Enron scandal and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, where\nthere was great public and legislative outrage over\nlight fraud sentences, to reconsider the fraud -- fraud\nguidelines.\nAnd that puts this in the core of the Ex\nPost Facto Clause, that it violates fundamental notions\nof retroactivity for a legislature to be able to alter\nthe law of punishment after the offense.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
