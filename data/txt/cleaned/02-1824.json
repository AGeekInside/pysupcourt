TED CRUZ\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. CRUZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the\nCourt:\nThis case concerns the continuing vitality of the\nprocedural default rule, an important bulwark to federalism,\ncomity, and finality of judgments. This Court has\nconsistently maintained that cause and prejudice can address\nproblems with procedural default, and that the actual\ninnocence exception should be applicable only in exceedingly\nrare cases.\nQUESTION: Can -- can you tell me -- I don't want\nto derail the argument -- you've conceded that this sentence\nis unlawful?\nMR. CRUZ: Yes, Justice Kennedy.\nQUESTION: Well, then why are you here? Don't -\nis there some rule that you can't confess error in your\nstate or?\nMR. CRUZ: No, Justice Kennedy, but the state is\nhere, because the state is concerned about the impact on the\nprocedural default rule, in particular the Fifth Circuit's\ndecision.\nQUESTION: Well, so a man does 15 years so you can\nvindicate your legal point in some other case? I -- I just\ndon't understand why you don't dismiss this case and move to\nlower the sentence.\nMR. CRUZ: Implicit in the procedural default -\nQUESTION: And I'd say the same for the Government\nof the United States.\nMR. CRUZ: Implicit in the procedural default rule\nis the premise that petitioner has a valid claim. In -- in\nsome ways this case, as the Fifth Circuit remarked, as the\njudges dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc, in some\nways this case presents an usually pristine form, I mean,\nit's almost a law school hypothetical, because the error is\nso clean. There's a 3-day disparity -\nQUESTION: At -- at the prisoner's expense.\nMR. CRUZ: But that is inherent in any claim with\nprocedural default.\nQUESTION: No, but it's not a -- it's not a -- as\nif there's some new trial and -- and it's in doubt. It's\nvery clear he should not be in jail for, like what, 12, 14,\n15 more years.\nMR. CRUZ: It is very clear that there was an\nerror, and that if Mr. Haley had raised the error at trial,\nthat the trail judge would have and should have sustained -\nQUESTION: But is it -\nQUESTION: Well -\nQUESTION: -- not also very clear that he's going\nto spend over 10 year in jail when he shouldn't spend 10\nyears in jail?\nMR. CRUZ: It is clear that he will spend 10 years\nin jail when he had an objection he could have raised that\nhe did not.\nQUESTION: Well, I understand that, but -- but if\nthe law were followed and everything went perfectly, he\nwould spend less than 2 or -- what is it, 2 or 3 years?\nMR. CRUZ: Two years would be the max.\nQUESTION: And he's going to spend 16 years in\njail, is that right?\nMR. CRUZ: Yes, Justice Stevens.\nQUESTION: Now, is that just, do you think?\nMR. CRUZ: Maintaining the procedural default rule\nis --\nQUESTION: I understand that you want to preserve\nthe procedures, but do you think justice is being done?\nMR. CRUZ: I think justice is being done because he\nhad a full and fair trial and an opportunity to raise his\nerrors, and there's no greater -\nQUESTION: Well, let me ask you this. Why -- why\nisn't there still an inadequate assistance of counsel claim\nout there, and why shouldn't the court address that before\nit gets into the question that it dealt with?\nMR. CRUZ: Justice O'Connor, I think there is a\nvery strong argument that there was inadequate assistance of\ncounsel.\nQUESTION: Well, why don't we vacate and remand and\nlet them deal with that?\nMR. CRUZ: Justice O'Connor, I think that is\nsomething that is open to the Court to do and I think that\nis one of the fundamental problems with what the district\ncourt did.\nQUESTION: You don't think that that claim was\nwaived here? You don't urge us to make that finding, do\nyou?\nMR. CRUZ: There is an argument that it was waived,\nbut I think the Fifth Circuit -\nQUESTION: Well, except the court below didn't\ndecide that question.\nMR. CRUZ: And I think the Fifth Circuit could\ncertainly deem the petitioner's pleading sufficient to\npreserve that claim.\nQUESTION: Yeah, I would think so too. I can't -\nQUESTION: Are you saying you won't -- you won't\nargue a waiver if it's sent back?\nMR. CRUZ: If it's sent back, we would be prepared\nto address the ineffective assistance claim on its merits.\nQUESTION: And not raise any procedural impediment\nto -\nMR. CRUZ: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, that's correct.\nQUESTION: The -- the -- another feature of this\ncase, what makes it so disturbing, is that the initial error\nwas the prosecutors, in -- when the prosecutor indicted him,\nthat indictment was incorrect, and then the rest followed,\nrelying on that original mistake of the prosecutor. So it\nseems a -- really an ideal case for the prosecution to say,\nwe missed it, and then as a result of we -- what we, the\nprosecutor missed, the court missed it, defense counsel\nmissed it, but it was our error and we should correct it.\nMR. CRUZ: And, Justice Ginsburg, this case may\nwell, if the Court finds ineffective assistance, that would\nsuffice to correct this, because ineffective assistance\ncounts as cause, and in many ways this case illustrates why\ncause and prejudice is ample to address error in sentencing\nin non-capital sentencing and why there's not a need to open\nthe door to a new category of exceptions to procedural\ndefault.\nQUESTION: Well, this defendant certainly raised -\nhe raised the point in his pro se petition in the state\ncourt and he raised it in the Federal court, the ineffective\nassistance, but nobody paid any attention to him.\nMR. CRUZ: The -- the claim was denied in state\nhabeas and the Federal habeas court did not address it\nbecause it had already granted relief based upon his claim\nthat he was actually innocent of the sentence.\nQUESTION: Did the prosecutor suggest that maybe\nthe court should have dealt with it, because neither court\ngave any reason for rejecting that claim?\nMR. CRUZ: I -- the -- the district court jumped\nahead in the process. Rather than address cause and\nprejudice, the district court said that it didn't need to\naddress cause and prejudice because it found actual\ninnocence, and that's one of the -- the significant\nproblems, much like statutory interpretation, where a court\nshould -\nQUESTION: Mr. Cruz, let me -- let me make -- get\nclear what -- what -- what your position is. You're --\nyou'd be totally content if we don't resolve this question\nthat's before us about whether whenever there's a procedural\ndefault that has clearly resulted and -- and with no\nineffective assistance of counsel, that has clearly resulted\nin an injustice, you know, we -- we throw away all the\nprocedural rules. You -- you don't want us to address that\nand just send it back and say, well, before you get to that\nquestion, you have to resolve the cause and prejudice and\nthen leave -- leave dangling in the air the question, the\nsignificant question, it seems to me, on which we granted\ncert?\nMR. CRUZ: Justice Scalia, the first preference of\nthe State of Texas is for the Court to address the circuit\nsplit and to clarify that there is no actual innocence\nexception to non-capital sentencing. If the Court is not\ninclined to do so, the State of Texas, our second preferred\noutcome is to vacate the decision of the Fifth Circuit so we\ndon't operate under that precedent.\nQUESTION: Why should we -- why should we not be\ninclined to do so? Is it a constitutional question that we\nshouldn't reach? I mean, do we have to do a sort of\njurisprudential striptease and decide this one case, leaving\nopen this question? I don't understand why we wouldn't\ndecide it.\nMR. CRUZ: And Texas is not urging the Court not to\ndecide it. It is simply saying that is an avenue should the\nCourt decide to decide -- to rule on this case in a more\nnarrow ground, that is an avenue that would provide some\nrelief to Texas because it would vacate the Fifth Circuit\ndecision and it would allow ultimately for some relief for\nMr. Haley as well.\nQUESTION: So you come back and fight another day?\nMR. CRUZ: Well, or perhaps someone else would\nfight in a different circuit.\nQUESTION: But if the court views this as a\npreliminary question, a question that the Fifth Circuit and\nany other Federal court should have reached logically before\nit reached the question on which it decided the case -\nMR. CRUZ: Yes, Justice -\nQUESTION: -- then we should put the court back in\nthe position that it should have been in if it handled the\ncase correctly.\nMR. CRUZ: Justice Ginsburg, we certainly agree\nthat as a matter of thinking through procedural default,\nthat courts should begin with cause and prejudice, that the\nactual innocence exception as a potential trump card should\nnot be jumped to first.\nQUESTION: Well, that just means it made two\nmistakes. Number one, if this theory that you're opposing\ndid exist, it shouldn't have reached it first, okay? It\nshould have reached it second. Mistake one. And number\ntwo, according to you, is this theory doesn't exist anyway.\nMR. CRUZ: And -\nQUESTION: I don't see why it's more intelligent\nfor us to reach the first question than the second if -- if\nthere isn't any such thing as number one and number two. If\nthe only one that exists is number one, it seems to me we\nshould say so.\nMR. CRUZ: And, Justice Scalia, I agree entirely\nwith your characterization of the errors made by the court\nbelow.\nQUESTION: May I ask this question? I always\nthought there was a manifest injustice exception to the\nprocedural default rule, and as I understand it, the\nGovernment concedes there was injustice at the end of their\nbrief. They say it's less significant, it's a less -\nqualitatively less significance than if you put an innocent\nman to death. But is it not manifest that there was\ninjustice in this case?\nMR. CRUZ: Justice Stevens, I -- I do not believe\nit is. It -- it is manifest that there was error -\nQUESTION: Well, can you give me an example of when\nmanifest injustice would exist other than a death case?\nMR. CRUZ: There are a host of instances in which\nthis Court has held that actual constitutional errors should\nnonetheless not be addressed because the defendant has\nprocedurally defaulted that.\nQUESTION: Well, I understand that, but is there\nany -- any content to the manifest injustice exception in\nyour view?\nMR. CRUZ: Absolutely there is. The paradigmatic\ncase -\nQUESTION: Well, give me an example.\nMR. CRUZ: -- is an individual was is innocent of\nthe crime.\nQUESTION: Well, he's innocent of the crime he's in\n-- in prison for.\nMR. CRUZ: He is innocent only in the most\ntechnical of legal sense. In the ordinary sense of the\nword, he committed the theft, he committed the predicate\nfelonies -\nQUESTION: No, but if the law were followed, he\nwould have been released a long time ago, would he not?\nMR. CRUZ: If he had raised his objection.\nQUESTION: What -- what actually -- what was he\ncharged with, Mr. Cruz? What was the substantive offense\nand what were the recidivist offenses?\nMR. CRUZ: He was charged with theft, and that was\nenhanced to a state jail felony because he had committed two\nprior thefts. And then upon sentencing, his sentence was\naggravated because he was a habitual offender and had two\nprior felony convictions. Now, the indictment alleged that\nthey were sequential and it turned out that allegation was\nincorrect.\nQUESTION: Well -\nQUESTION: They -- they were sequential. I mean,\none followed another. Isn't what it comes down to is that\nhe should have been -- he should have been given this longer\nsentence for the second theft instead of for the third\ntheft?\nMR. CRUZ: No, actually, Justice Scalia, the way\nthe statute reads -\nQUESTION: As I understand it, the -- the -- the\ntheft that -- that was used for recidivism occurred 3 days\nafter, right, the --\nMR. CRUZ: It's a 3 -- it's a 3-day disparity. The\nfirst crime was delivery of amphetamines.\nQUESTION: Yeah.\nMR. CRUZ: And he committed that in 1988, but that\nconviction did not become final until October 18th, 1991.\nThree days before October 18th, 1991, he committed attempted\nrobbery, and the way the Texas statute reads, he has to\ncommit the second felony after the first felony conviction\nbecomes final.\nQUESTION: But why did the first felony take so\nlong to become final? It took -- you say it took 3 years?\nMR. CRUZ: It -- it did. I don't know the extent\nto which that was discovery in the trial, but that -- that's\nultimately what the record reveal in terms of when that\nconviction -\nQUESTION: At -- at trial, do you think the\nprosecutor would have, if he had noted this error, have the\nduty to call the attention of the trial judge before the\ntrial judge imposed sentence?\nMR. CRUZ: Absolutely, absolutely. And -- and -\nQUESTION: But the trial obligation -- the trial\nlawyer's obligation to do justice is -- is somehow missing\nin your office?\nMR. CRUZ: The state has an obligation to be candid\nwith the court, so at any point in which the state became\naware of this error, the state would be obliged to inform\nthe court, but that's a very different thing to say that\nwhen there is a procedural default, when the defendant has\nnot preserved his error, that the state should not act to\nvindicate that procedural default. There is an important\nvalue in protecting the procedural rules in the State of\nTexas, and that value is not served. I mean, ultimately,\nthis Court has said that the very narrow exception of actual\ninnocence should apply in very narrow circumstances. So\nthis Court has ultimately engaged in a balancing, a\nbalancing that derives from prior language in the -- in the\nFederal habeas -\nQUESTION: Well, narrow circumstances, when the\nrecord makes it perfectly clear that an error has been\ncommitted and an innocent person is in jail, that's -- what\nmore do you need?\nMR. CRUZ: The difficult -\nQUESTION: There aren't many cases like this.\nMR. CRUZ: It is true that there are not many cases\nwhere the state concedes error, but the difficulty with\npivoting the test on that is the basic operating premise of\nevery habeas petition. Where procedural default is raised\nis that the petitioner has valid claim and this Court has\nnot hesitated to allow far more significant claims not to be\naddressed because of procedural default.\nQUESTION: Yes, but usually the valid claim is some\nprocedural error in the trial, something of that character.\nIt's not that he's totally innocent and everybody agrees\nhe's totally innocent.\nMR. CRUZ: This -- this Court has addressed\nprocedural default in the context of forced confessions, in\nthe context of statements without Miranda rights, in the\ncontext of psychiatry -\nQUESTION: But that -- but -- but -- no, what you\nneed to satisfy Justice Stevens is -- is a case where the\nmistake unquestionably caused the outcome of the -\nunquestionably caused the outcome of the trial to be wrong.\nAll of the ones you just mentioned, it may have caused it to\nbe wrong, may not have, you don't -- the jury might have\nconvicted him without the confession, et cetera, et cetera.\nDo you have any cases where -- where, as here, there is no\ndoubt that the procedural default produced a different\noutcome in the trial?\nMR. CRUZ: We do not have any cases like that, but\nthat aspect simply goes to prejudice, and this Court has\nrepeatedly cautioned that the actual innocence exception\nshould not be used to transform cause and prejudice just to\nprejudice. There's no doubt that this error caused\nprejudice. The only question is if there was cause for not\nraising it, and in terms of asking -- I mean, Justice\nStevens asked me about, is this a manifest injustice. There\nseems nothing on the face of it that is plain to me that\nallowing an individual to be convicted and to remain\nconvicted and serve in jail or even be executed based on a\nforced confession is somehow a lesser injustice than\nallowing Mr. Haley to serve a sentence -\nQUESTION: I think it's a lesser injustice if he's\nreally guilty of the crime.\nMR. CRUZ: But in this case, Mr. Haley is guilty of\nthe theft, he's guilty of the predicate offense -\nQUESTION: He is not guilty of what he's in prison\nfor.\nMR. CRUZ: Only in the sense -\nQUESTION: And I don't think the 3 days is an\nargument that has any merit. You'd make the same argument\nif it was 10 years. You'd make the same argument.\nMR. CRUZ: It is -- it is true that 3 days or 5\ndays or whatever does not matter. What matters, and what we\nare urging, is that Mr. Haley had multiple avenues to\nchallenge this. He could have challenged this at trial. He\ncould have challenged this on direct appeal.\nQUESTION: If he could deliberately refuse to do it\nin order to trap the state into some kind of mistake, is\nthis a case of, you know, in our original case that we talk\nabout gamesmanship and so on, do you think this is\ngamesmanship on his part?\nMR. CRUZ: You know, we don't have reason to\nsuggest that Mr. Haley in this instance was engaged in\ngamesmanship with respect to this error, but the record is\nsusceptible to an interpretation that his counsel was\nengaged in gamesmanship with respect to whether or not Mr.\nHaley pleaded to the enhancements. Because what happened at\ntrial is Mr. Haley's attorney urged the trial court, my\nclient doesn't want to plead, please go ahead, he's not\ngoing to plead. The trial court did what the counsel asked\nand he immediately, on direct appeal that was his principal\nchallenge, and that is one possible interpretation of the\nrecord is the counsel was attempting to sandbag. There was\na line of state court cases saying it was mandatory error\nnot to plead.\nQUESTION: Well, if the counsel sandbagged for the\npurpose of getting a 16-year sentence instead of a 3-year\nsentence, doesn't that demonstrate that he was incompetent?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. CRUZ: It may well, and I certainly wouldn't\nurge that counsel engaged in good strategic decisions, but\nit may have been a strategic decision with respect to urging\nthe court to commit an error under state law that caused the\ncounsel not to notice the disparities in the enhancements.\nQUESTION: In one of the proceedings, Texas did\ntake the position that there -- this was not ineffective\nassistance of counsel. The reply brief I think makes it\nclear that you're not disputing that the -- that the\nineffective assistance of counsel claim is alive and well.\nBut there was a time you took a different view.\nMR. CRUZ: That -- that is correct, and we agree at\nthis point there is a very significant argument of\nineffective assistance of counsel, and I would note that the\ncourt of criminal appeals in Texas has found ineffective\nassistance of counsel in almost precisely the same\ncircumstance where a counsel failed to notice the non\nsequential nature of felonies used to enhance a habitual\noffender in the decision of Ex parte Scott, which is found\nat 581 S.W.2d 181.\nIf there are no further questions, I'd like to\nreserve the balance of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Cruz.\nMr. Roberts, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. ROBERTS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nThe actual innocence exception applies in the\nextraordinary case where a prisoner has been convicted of a\ncrime that he did not commit. The Court shouldn't extend\nthat narrow exception to the very different situation where\nthe prisoner is guilty of the crime of which he was\nconvicted.\nQUESTION: Well, what should we do in this case\nwith someone who -- who is serving an unjust sentence under\nthe law?\nMR. ROBERTS: Well -- well, Your Honor, even if\nthis Court holds that the actual innocence exception doesn't\napply to non-capital sentencing, respondent may well be\nentitled to relief here.\nQUESTION: On the inadequate assistance claim?\nMR. ROBERTS: On the ineffective assistance claim,\nand I -\nQUESTION: Do you urge that that's waived, or can\nthe court below address it?\nMR. ROBERTS: We don't believe that it's waived,\nYour Honor.\nQUESTION: Thank you.\nQUESTION: Why not go to that first and tell them\nto do that, because this is just very difficult, that that\nwould be the reason? The reason it would be difficult is\nbecause actual innocence is simply a way at getting at\nmanifest injustice, I think, and a reason that this fits in\nthe manifest injustice is we feel differently about\nsubstantive laws that govern how long a person is going to\nbe in prison than we do about procedural laws, and\nsentencing is an aspect of that.\nBut if you take that and say, look, this is an\nabsolute obvious case where there was just wrong sentencing,\nit's not actual innocence, it's wrong sentencing, but it's\nso obvious, it's so clear that this is just unjust. Once\nwe're down that path, I mean, how do we draw a line between\nthat and every sentencing error? Now, I'm just -\nMR. ROBERTS: That -- that's -\nQUESTION: -- I'm getting you to -\nMR. ROBERTS: -- but that's right, Your Honor -\nQUESTION: -- I know that's just what you were\ngoing to say -\nMR. ROBERTS: -- and that's our primary -- that's\nour primary concern here.\nQUESTION: All right. But is the answer then not\nto deal with it when it's clear?\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, the -- the Court certainly\ncould do that. There is a danger I think in -- in\naddressing the actual innocence exception in a case where\nthere's cause and prejudice and so you don't need to address\nit, and in a case where the error is -- is clear when what\nthe real concern is when it's not that clear about whether\nsomebody's actually innocent.\nQUESTION: So you're saying it would be wise to\nsend it back, is that right?\nMR. ROBERTS: It -- it -- yes, except that, you\nknow, certainly our -- our primary interest in the question\nhere is in the question that's divided the circuits and in\nmaking clear that there isn't a broad actual innocence\nexception as applied to -- to non-capital sentencing.\nQUESTION: Perhaps when it's clear it will always\nbe the case that there's been ineffective assistance of\ncounsel. How -- how could it be, you know, clear as day and\nineffective assistance of counsel not -- not have\nintervened?\nMR. ROBERTS: That -- that's -- that's right, Your\nHonor. It may well frequently be the case, which is why you\nwouldn't need the actual innocence exception for that -- for\nthat circumstance. But -- but our concern is that a rule\nthat applies to the exception where the prisoner is guilty\nof the crime and is claiming only that he's suffering an\nexcessive prison term, if taken to its logical conclusion,\nthat would open up final judgments where a criminal\ndefendant is belatedly claiming that a sentencing guideline\nwas incorrectly applied to him and that he's therefore\ninnocent of the sentence.\nQUESTION: Well, suppose -- suppose this were the\nFederal system. Would the Department of Justice take the\nposition that it would not ask sua sponte that this sentence\nbe reduced?\nMR. ROBERTS: We -- we well might not have appealed\nfrom the district court judgment in this case. If the\nGovernment takes an appeal, the Solicitor General office has\nto -- has to approve those appeals and we would certainly -\nQUESTION: That's one tremendous advantage the\nGovernment has over individual criminal defendants' lawyers,\nisn't it? They choose the facts they want to bring here.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Well, they do, don't they?\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, we certainly would -- would\ntake into account the entire situation in -- in making a\ndetermination on that, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: You think there might be some doubt that\nthe Department of Justice would insist that -\nMR. ROBERTS: I -- I hate to predict it -\nQUESTION: -- a 10 -- a 10-year -- an unlawful 10\nyear term?\nMR. ROBERTS: -- in any case, but I would expect\nthat if it was clear that there was cause and prejudice that\nwas -- that a case involved a situation where the prisoner\n-\nQUESTION: Forget cause and prejudice. Suppose the\nterm is unlawful and it's conceded to be unlawful. Are you\ntaking the position the Department of Justice says he has to\nbe held anyway?\nMR. ROBERTS: I -- I -\nQUESTION: I'm -- I'm astounded by that.\nMR. ROBERTS: I'm not -- I'm -- I'm not taking the\nposition of that, Your Honor. I just -- I hesitate to -- to\nmake a prediction about some future case where I don't know\nall the facts. I certainly think that if -- if, in a case\nlike this where a prisoner was clearly entitled to -- had -\nhad cause and prejudice and was entitled to relief, that we\nwould call that to the attention of the -- of the district\ncourt or to the attention of the court of appeals.\nQUESTION: Mr. Roberts, you now say ineffective\nassistance of counsel claim, I think you answered that that\nwas preserved. But I noticed that you were very careful in\nyour brief to say twice if -- if Haley preserved the\nineffective assistance of counsel -\nMR. ROBERTS: Right.\nQUESTION: -- argument.\nMR. ROBERTS: We -- I -- I -- we think that it's a\nquestion to be decided by the -- the court of appeals on -\non remand, Your Honor, and the state had made arguments\nabout whether it was preserved or not. Justice O'Connor\nasked me my opinion as to whether the -- whether the claim\nwas preserved, and in -- in our view it was, but that would\nbe a question for the lower court to -- to decide, and\napparently the state is no longer arguing that -- that it\nwasn't preserved.\nAs I said, our -- our -- the -- the issue that\nwe're primarily concerned about here is a broad extension of\nthe actual innocence exception to an erroneous prison term,\nand that would involve substantial societal costs, because\nthe challenges to the findings -\nQUESTION: Would it involve all those costs if we\ncan find the exception to cases in which the state\nacknowledges the error?\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, that would certainly be a far\nless problematic exception.\nQUESTION: Would it be problematic if we limit it\nthat way?\nMR. ROBERTS: No, Your Honor, except to the extent\nthat it -- it extended -- extends actual innocence beyond an\noffense which has a special constitutional status.\nQUESTION: Are we free to write this code of\ncriminal procedure? I mean, I can understand all these\narguments being made to, you know, to Congress or -- or to\nthe state legislatures for writing a code of criminal\nprocedure, but what is -- what is the -\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, well, the -\nQUESTION: -- justification for this -\nMR. ROBERTS: -- these rules are -\nQUESTION: -- something which has never been done\nin -- in a couple of hundred years is -- is -- is part of\ndue process?\nMR. ROBERTS: No, Your Honor. My understanding is\nthat the actual innocence exception and the procedural\ndefault rules are court-made limitations on the jurisdiction\n-- on the exercise of discretion by the Federal habeas\ncourt, and so the court's exercising its -- its supervisory\nauthority over the courts.\nQUESTION: No, but the Federal habeas court has to\nbe relying upon some law to -- to undo the state conviction,\nright?\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes, Your Honor. There has to be an\nunderlying claim.\nQUESTION: Yeah.\nMR. ROBERTS: But we're talking here about the\nactual innocence exception, which is a gateway to\nconsideration of that underlying claim. There -- there\nstill has to be an underlying constitutional claim, and -\nand that -\nQUESTION: Mr. Roberts, why is it -\nMR. ROBERTS: -- that's an issue that's not before\nthe Court whether there is -- is such a claim.\nQUESTION: Why is this qualitatively different from\nthe rule in Jackson against Virginia that if there's no\nevidence to support the conviction, we set it aside, then\nyou presume the guy's innocent?\nMR. ROBERTS: Well -- well -- Jack -- Jackson, Your\nHonor, is based on Winship, which is based on the\nrequirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt of the\nelements of the crime. When you're talking about sentencing\n--\nQUESTION: Well, when the record is perfectly clear\nthat -\nMR. ROBERTS: -- there is no such constitutional\nrequirement.\nQUESTION: When the record is perfectly clear that\none of the elements hasn't been proved, why he had a -- why\nisn't it the same here? The record establishes that one of\nthe elements necessary for this conviction has not been\nproven, the order of the -- the two crimes.\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, I -- I respectfully disagree\nwith that, Your Honor. That -- the elements of the crime\nhave all been proved. They're not -- they're not disputed.\nWhat's disputed is -- is a factor leading to enhancement in\nthe sentence. If this was an element of the crime, we would\nagree with you that the actual innocence exception applies\nhere.\nQUESTION: If Apprendi had come out the other way,\nor if we extended Apprendi to recidivism?\nMR. ROBERTS: If you overruled Almendarez-Torres,\nwe would agree that the actual innocence exception applies\nin this particular case.\nQUESTION: Doesn't scare me.\nMR. ROBERTS: But again, our concern is with broad\napplication of the actual innocence exception to sentencing\nand to the many findings that are involved there, and the\nfact is that the Court hasn't overruled Almendarez-Torres.\nWe're talking about even in this case just an erroneous\nsentence. We're not talking about an innocence of an\noffense with the special constitutional status that that\nentails and the special stigma that's attached to innocent,\nto an offense.\nQUESTION: But Mr. Roberts, aren't we talking about\njustice? You -- at the end of your brief you say, this is\nqualitatively less significant than it -- than killing\nsomebody for the wrong crime, but it is injust, isn't it?\nMR. ROBERTS: It -- there's -- there's certain\nunfairness involved, but the -- the manifest injustice\nexception is not directed at -- at every -\nQUESTION: The manifest injustice -\nMR. ROBERTS: -- at every unfairness, and -\nQUESTION: No, but it's a -- it's a -- it's\ndirected at injustice that is manifest, not the\ndisqualitatively more than severe than it, and here it's\nmanifest.\nMR. ROBERTS: I -- it -- what the Court has done in\n-- in determining the application of exception is to weigh\nthe -- the degree of injustice that would be involved in\ndenying review against the substantial costs involved in -\nin reviewing claims when there's -- the prisoners\ninexcusably failed to raise them in the proper forum and the\nproper time, and -\nQUESTION: And you have difficulty weighing 15\nyears of an unlawful sentence and saying that that's not a\nmanifest injustice? That's a difficult exercise?\nMR. ROBERTS: I -- Your Honor, the -- the -- it --\nit's certainly an unfairness, but there are substantial\ncosts to -- to extending it to these many -- there are many\nfactors that are involved in sentencing, and the fact is the\nprisoner's still guilty of the offense of conviction here,\nYour Honor.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Roberts.\nMr. Albritton.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC M. ALBRITTON\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. ALBRITTON: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please\nthe Court:\nThis Court has repeatedly recognized that the -\nthe systemic concerns that underpin the procedural default\ndoctrine must yield to the imperative of correcting a\nfundamentally unjust incarceration, an incarceration that is\nbeyond the statutory maximum sentence, whether it be a\ncapital sentence or a non-capital sentence, is fundamentally\nunjust. The Court has never limited this exception to a\ncapital sentence context and it should not do so today.\nQUESTION: Well, it has never extended it beyond\nthe capital sentence context either, has it?\nMR. ALBRITTON: That is correct, Your Honor.\nHowever -\nQUESTION: And there is some suggestion in our\ncases that other claims ought to be addressed before\nresorting to that, such as inadequate assistance of counsel.\nMR. ALBRITTON: Your Honor, I agree that this\nCourt's precedents suggest that ineffective assistance of\ncounsel, cause and prejudice, should be addressed first.\nHowever, this Court has never expressly held that. Your\nHonor, in relation to the question that I've been asked\nabout, should this Court just remand for consideration of\nthe ineffective assistance of counsel claim, I would\nrespectfully suggest that that is not appropriate.\nIn this case, Your Honor, the petitioner -\nQUESTION: Why not? You think that counsel's\nperformance was adequate here?\nMR. ALBRITTON: Your Honor, I think it was grossly\ninadequate. However, the question presented by the\npetitioner in this case, Your Honor, is only whether the\nactual innocence exception to the procedural default rule\nconcerning Federal habeas corpus claims should apply to non-\ncapital sentence here.\nQUESTION: Yes, but if it's our view that the court\nbelow addressed that out of order too soon when it had an\nalternative, certainly we could vacate and remand.\nMR. ALBRITTON: You could, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. ALBRITTON: Again, I would respectfully suggest\nthat's inappropriate. The State of Texas could have argued\nand presented the court with that particular question, that\nis, whether or not the court should have reached cause and\nprejudice first. However, the State of Texas did not ask\nthe court to consider that claim.\nQUESTION: But we -- we haven't in -- in at least\ntwo or three cases when we have a question of certiorari,\nwe've said that there's a logically preceding question that\nhas to be decided before we can get to that. So it seems to\nme this might be that kind of a case.\nMR. ALBRITTON: Your Honor, I am familiar with that\nprecedent, and I understand that the Court could -\nQUESTION: Well, I guess you'd like your client out\nof jail?\nMR. ALBRITTON: That's absolutely correct, Your\nHonor, and the state didn't -\nQUESTION: Doesn't sound like it.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Well, you -- you'd rather do it sooner\nrather than later, right? You'd rather have us say let him\nfree rather than send it back down and try it all over\nagain?\nMR. ALBRITTON: Absolutely, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: That seems reasonable.\nMR. ALBRITTON: If it's remanded, he's going to be\nincarcerated while it goes back through the court of appeals\nand through the district court, and if this Court decides\nthat, this issue, that it cannot reach the issue presented,\nthe Court can certainly dismiss this case as improvidently\ngranted and Mr. Haley will no longer have to suffer under\nthe danger of this clearly -\nQUESTION: Mr. Albritton, let me -- let me ask you\nthis. In this case there is a statute that would not have\nallowed the additional sentence to be imposed unless these\nthings were sequential. Suppose that wasn't the situation.\nSuppose what you are -- we're dealing with was a real\nsentencing factor of the sort that a judge can take into\naccount under a law which says the judge may sentence from\n10 to 30 years, all right?\nMR. ALBRITTON: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: It's up to the judge. And in sentencing\nhim to the maximum, the judge makes a mistake of fact. It\nis later found that when the judge said I'm giving him 30\nyears because, you know, he's been a really bad person in\nlight of this background, and it turns out that background\ndidn't exist, all right? Would you be making the same\nargument here?\nMR. ALBRITTON: I absolutely would not, Your Honor.\nAs we've argued in our brief -\nQUESTION: That does make it sound like what this\nis is Almendarez-Torres, that -- that -- the -- the\ndifference between the hypothetical I just posed to you and\nthis case is simply that the law would not allow the\nadditional time to be imposed unless the fact was found,\nwhereas in the discretionary case, the law would have\nallowed it.\nMR. ALBRITTON: Your Honor, we do not believe that\nthe Court need reach Almendarez-Torres. However, the rule\nwe propose is certainly consistent with this Court's Sixth\nAmendment rule in Apprendi. It's also consistent with -\nQUESTION: Well, how -- how do you limit it to that\nkind of a situation then? How -- how do you -- how do you\ngive me the answer that you've just given me, that even\nthough you -- you -- you show that the judge who imposed a\ndiscretionary sentence was absolutely wrong for the basis on\nwhich he imposed that discretionary sense, you wouldn't\nallow that to be reviewed. Why -- what's the basis for\nthat?\nMR. ALBRITTON: Several reasons, Your Honor. First\nof all, this Court's decision in Sawyer v. Whitley\nspecifically adopted an eligibility test, and that\neligibility test draws the line at where that person is\nstatutorily eligible. This Court specifically rejected the\nnotion that it should consider discretionary factors in the\ncapital context mitigating evidence.\nThus, Your Honor, our rule about statutory\neligibility is tethered specifically to the Court's ruling\nin Sawyer. Additionally, Your Honor, that rule that we\npropose is well-rooted in this Court's habeas doctrine\ndating back to Townsend v. Burke, Your Honor. This Court\nhas recognized that a sentence that falls -- the severity of\na sentence that falls within a statutory range is not\namenable to habeas review. Additionally, the recent case,\nYour Honor, of Harris v. the United States, where the issue\nwas whether Apprendi applied to mandatory minimums. This\nCourt held -- actually, part of the opinion is a plurality\nopinion, but the holding is that the -- it does not matter\nif the sentence is more based on some false fact. The issue\nis, is it within range of punishment authorized by the\nlegislature, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: I understand that. I just don't\nunderstand why it makes any sense if you've shown and can\nknow for sure that the only reason the judge imposed the 30\nyears was that he believed a certain fact was true which in\nfact was not true, and that is demonstrated, and he said,\nI'm opposing 30 years because of this, otherwise, you know,\nthis would be a 10-year sentence. And I -- there's just as\nmuch injustice there, it seems to me.\nMR. ALBRITTON: Well, Your Honor, the difference is\nin an error in what constitutes a fundamental miscarriage of\njustice, and we would respectfully suggest that when a\nsentence is imposed outside of any range authorized by the\nlegislature, that is fundamentally unjust.\nQUESTION: But the other could be, couldn't it?\nmean, that's -- what I don't understand about this area, and\nyou've read the cases and so you may able to be clearer than\nI am and can correct me, I've thought that the real key\nconcept is not actual innocence. It's very hard to apply\nthat to a sentence. You're guilty of the crime, you're not\ninnocent of the sentence. That doesn't make sense, but\nrather manifest injustice, and the key word is manifest.\nAnd so one could have manifest injustice in\nmillions of possible situations. You don't need absolute\nclarity as to it applies to in between the guideline but not\nbeyond the guideline, but the key word is manifest, and it\nhas to be unjust and injustice first and foremost has to do\nwith being behind bars when the law says you shouldn't be,\ndirectly and simply, not through some procedural device.\nSo thinking about it in that way, I would like you\nto tell me what cases of this Court stand as obstacles to\nthe way I'm thinking about it?\nMR. ALBRITTON: Your Honor, I believe that Sawyer,\nwe believe that Sawyer v. Whitley stands as an obstacle to\nthat approach, because in Sawyer, Your Honor, the Court\nspecifically rejected the notion that factors that affect\nthe sentence within the discretion of the sentencing body\nare not to be considered in the determination of whether or\nnot somebody -- or a petitioner is actually innocent of that\nsentence.\nQUESTION: You see what I -- what I'm basically\ninterested in is, is the -- the concept actual innocence\nsimply a subdivision of the broader concept manifest\ninjustice? And so that actual innocence of the crime\nitself, where manifest, is a basis for doing whatever\nhappens in habeas law. And if I know whether that's a\nsubdivision, I then would have a better handle on the case.\nMR. ALBRITTON: Your Honor, I -- it is our position\nthat innocence has been adopted as a touchstone for the\ndetermination of whether or not there is a manifest\ninjustice. The Court has determined that that properly\ntakes into consideration, that focus on innocence takes into\nproper consideration the systemic interest in federalism,\ncomity, and finality.\nYour Honor, although the -- the concept of\ninnocence of punishment is awkward and recognized, Mr. Haley\nis actually innocent of the fact alleged that caused for the\nsentence that is more than eight times the statutory -\nQUESTION: Everybody's going to say they're\nactually innocent. All -- I mean, you know, not everybody,\nbut, you know, a very high percentage of prisoners in prison\nsay, I was actually innocent, and the prosecution says, no,\nyou're not actually innocent. So if that's really an\nexcuse, actual innocence, and if in fact that's really an\nexcuse in respect to a sentence, then why wouldn't every\ncase be open to the Federal habeas judge relitigating the\nlawfulness of the conviction in terms of the evidence and\nrelitigating the sentence in terms of what was reasonable?\nMR. ALBRITTON: Those concerns, Your Honor,\nunderpin the reason for the high standard of proof in the\nfirst instance, that is, clear and convincing evidence.\nThose concerns also, Your Honor, inform the reason for the\nrule we proposed, and that is there is only a fundamental\nmiscarriage of justice when a sentence is imposed that under\nthe true facts no sentencing body, judge or jury, could have\never done.\nQUESTION: All right. In your view, under the true\nfacts, a prisoner says the true facts are X, the state says\nthe true facts are not X, and what's supposed to happen?\nMR. ALBRITTON: The court has to decide if the\npetitioner has shown by clear and convincing evidence that\nhe or she, but for a constitutional violation, would not\nhave been eligible for that sentence.\nQUESTION: So -- so in your -- in your view, every\ncrime in a state court and every sentence in a state court,\nat least a big subset, are open to relitigation in the\nFederal court on the standard of whether there is clear and\nconvincing evidence that adds the factual matters, it was\nthat the -- the state court was wrong?\nMR. ALBRITTON: No, Your Honor, not a large subset,\nonly the subset of cases where the petitioner receives a\nsentence for which he or she is statutorily ineligible.\nQUESTION: In -- in your -- in your view, Mr.\nAlbritton, there's no requirement that this evidence be\nnewly discovered, I take it?\nMR. ALBRITTON: That is correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Mr. Albritton, it's a small subset of\nthe state court cases, but it's a -- it's a -- it's a total\n-- it's not a subset at all of the Federal cases, right?\nBecause we have a guideline system where, by statute, you\nare not allowed to impose any more than what the guidelines\npermit, right?\nMR. ALBRITTON: That's not actually entirely\naccurate, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Well, unless you -- sure, you -- you can\nmake a finding that -- where that finding hasn't been made\nthat this is somehow extraordinary, you cannot, by law,\nimpose more than a certain amount of sentence.\nMR. ALBRITTON: In the -- in the Federal context,\nYour Honor, there are two things that are operating. One\nare the guidelines, but the second is the statutory range of\npunishment. The legislature has determined that within the\napplication of the guidelines, that a sentence, up until and\nincluding the statutory maximum under some circumstances is\nappropriate.\nQUESTION: Oh no.\nQUESTION: Yeah, but this guideline says the\nstatute says, Judge, you must apply the guideline range\nunless. Now, there are many situations where it isn't even\narguably unless, okay?\nMR. ALBRITTON: Yes, sir.\nQUESTION: So that means there is a statutory\nrequirement that the judge impose the guideline sentence,\nfour extra units or points if you had a gun, say. The\nprisoner says, I didn't have a gun. The state says, I did\nhave a gun. And now you want to relitigate whether he had a\ngun or didn't have a gun, whether the victim was seriously\nhurt or only gravely hurt, whether there was a threat or a\nbrandishment or an actual use of the gun, all of which add\npoints, and what you're saying is all of those things would\nbe relitigated in a habeas court, as long as the prisoner\ncolorably can say, I have evidence that will show clearly\nand convincingly the judge was wrong.\nMR. ALBRITTON: That is not correct, Your Honor.\nUnder the rule we propose, the Federal court would only have\nto engage in this exercise if the petitioner could establish\nby the requisite proof that he or she received a sentence\nabove the statutory maximum. While it may be error in the\napplication of the guidelines and there can be factual\ninaccuracies -\nQUESTION: No, you were saying that, but judge -- I\nknew you were saying that, but I think Justice Scalia's\nquestion was that he can't find, nor can I find, a logical\nbasis for making that distinction. That's the problem.\nQUESTION: The sentence is unlawful if it goes\nabove the guidelines, which is why it can be set aside by\nthe appellate court. It is unlawful.\nMR. ALBRITTON: Your -- Your Honor, the difference\nbetween unlawful and a fundamentally unjust is an important\ndistinction. As this Court has historically held from the\nearly notions of habeas when, even when habeas review in the\nfirst right, regardless of default, was much more\ncircumspect, the Court could always reach and always issue\nthe writ where a petitioner received a sentence that is\noutside the statutory range. So it's a difference in the -\na situation where there may be an error and there may be\nsome injustice, and a situation where the -- the injustice\nis fundamental, Your Honor. That's the distinction.\nQUESTION: Mr. Albritton, there's -- there's one\nmisfit here. You -- you're trying to transpose to the\nsentencing area the actual innocence of the crime, precedent\nfrom the death penalty area. But this Court has said in\nHerrera that the actual innocence, first it has to be new\nevidence, and second, that it's only a gateway. And you\nsay, well, sure, it's only a gateway here, the gateway is\nJackson, sufficiency of the evidence. But the very same\nthing that proves the actual innocence of the sentence is\nwhat establishes that you win on the constitutional point.\nAnd in the -- in the death cases, there isn't that -- this\nis not overlap, this is total coincidence.\nMR. ALBRITTON: Your Honor, in this Court's opinion\nlast week in Banks v. Dretke, the Court recognized, as it\nhad previously in Stickler v. Greene -- Strickler v. Greene,\nthat it is not unusual for the same facts to be used and an\noverlap between those facts for the inquiry as to whether or\nnot the merits of the claim can be reached and the merits of\nthe claim. As the Court held in Banks last week, Your\nHonor, the -- the same evidence was used to establish both\ncause and prejudice, as well as the underlying merits of the\n-- of the Brady violation.\nIt's not surprising that the same evidence would\nbe involved in this situation, Your Honor, because, after\nall, the inquiry is extremely similar, and that is the\ninnocence of the petitioner and whether or not the state\nproved as a due process matter the allegations that it was\nrequired to.\nYour Honor, this -- this rule is a narrow rule for\nthe reasons we discussed. It does not reach the sentencing\nguideline issues. This holding under Apprendi -- under -\nthis Court's holding in Apprendi, Your Honor, requires all\nelements other than arguably some or some recidivist\nallegations under Almendarez-Torres are required to be\nalleged and proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt so\nthat if a person is charged with a drug offense and the\ndifference in 50 grams and 51 grams affects the statutory\nmaximum, his or her actual innocence of that quantity is\nalready covered subject to -- subject -- is already subject\nto the fundamental miscarriage of justice exception\nirrespective of what the court holds in the application of\nSawyer to non-capital sentences.\nQUESTION: What -- and what -- what's your\nauthority for that? Where -- where have we said that? Is\nthat part of your submission or are you saying that that's\nexisting authority?\nMR. ALBRITTON: Your Honor, that's -- first of all,\nI believe, Your Honor, the Government just conceded that.\nSecondly, Your Honor -\nQUESTION: But do you know on what basis?\nMR. ALBRITTON: Yes, sir. This Court has held in\nSchlup -\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. ALBRITTON: -- that if you're actually innocent\nof the elements of the offense, then -- and you're able to\nestablish that -- then the fundamental miscarriage of\njustice exception applies. If the quantity of cocaine is an\nelement of the offense for Apprendi purposes -\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. ALBRITTON: -- the failure to -- the innocence\nof that fact would make the petitioner subject to the -\nQUESTION: And that goes back to the Almendarez-\nTorres discussion you had with Justice Scalia?\nMR. ALBRITTON: Your Honor, it -- no, sir, it does\nnot, because Almendarez-Torres only concerns certain\nrecidivist allegations. Apprendi applies to every other\nfactors that raises -\nQUESTION: I -- I -\nMR. ALBRITTON: -- the statutory maximum. Your\nHonor, this rule can -- the exception that we're talking\nabout can be administered with relative ease. As the Court\ndiscussed in Sawyer, that's an important consideration in\ndetermining whether or not the exception should be applied.\nThe issue presented to a Federal district judge of actual\ninnocence of a non-capital sentence is easier to determine\nand it's more objective than, for instance, the\ndetermination Federal district judges are called upon to\ndetermine whether or not a petitioner is statutorily\neligible for the death penalty.\nFor instance, in the State of Texas, the state\nmust prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the petitioner\nconstitutes a future danger. In the State of Louisiana, for\ninstance, the state has to -- one of the statutory\naggravating factors are that the crime was committed in a\nheinous manner. Those inquiries are more subjective and\nless objective than the inquiry required under the\napplication the -- of the exception that we propose.\nAdditionally, Your Honors, the equities weigh\nstrongly in favor of applying the rule in non-capital\nsentences. Justice Scalia asked a question as to why this\nrule may be necessary because there would always be\nineffective assistance of counsel, and frankly there's an\nanswer to that. And that answer is, there will not always\nbe a meritorious -- under a meritorious claim and there will\nnot necessarily be ineffective assistance of counsel for one\nreason at least, and that is, under Carrier, this Court held\nthat to rely on the ineffective assistance of counsel as\ncause in Federal court, that claim had to have been raised\nbelow in the state court.\nSo there could be a scenario, this scenario, if\nMr. Haley had not properly raised ineffective assistance of\ncounsel below in state habeas or on state appeal as required\nby state law, he would not be entitled to rely on that\nineffective assistance of counsel for cause in Federal\ncourt, and so the court would be presented again with this\nfundamentally unjust situation.\nQUESTION: Well, and there are also cases under\nFeretta where the defendant decides to represent himself.\nMR. ALBRITTON: That is correct, Your Honor. Your\nHonor, what is unusual about this case additionally, as\npointed out by the Court, the prosecutors -- we're -- we\ndon't suggest purposefully -- but the prosecutors\nnevertheless caused the injustice in this case. The State\nof Texas prop -- improperly alleged that Mr. Haley's second\nconviction or second prior offense was committed before -\nor after the first became final.\nQUESTION: Well, are -- would you say, taking it\nfrom there to the future dangerous, that the -- the\nprosecutor was in error in the sense you refer to if he\nalleged that the petitioner is going to be a future danger?\nAre all these allegations just going to be turned out that\nway?\nMR. ALBRITTON: Not necessarily, Your Honor,\nbecause a prosecutor in good faith could certainly believe\nthat the evidence would be sufficient to prove future\ndangerousness beyond a reasonable doubt.\nQUESTION: Well, are -- are you suggesting the\nprosecutor in this case deliberately, when he alleged the\nthing, knew that it was not -- wouldn't stand up?\nMR. ALBRITTON: I'm not suggesting that, Your\nHonor. However -\nQUESTION: But then -- but then it really isn't a\nbasis for distinguishing the two examples I gave you for\njust you to say, well, in the first case the prosecutor\nacted in good faith.\nMR. ALBRITTON: Even if the prosecutor did not do\nthis intentionally, Your Honor, the error and the injustice\noriginated with the prosecutor. Not only did the prosecutor\n--\nQUESTION: Well, but you could say that about an\nallegation of future dangerous too. You have the -- that's\nalleged in the complaint, isn't it?\nMR. ALBRITTON: If future dangerousness is alleged,\nin reviewing the evidence there's a good faith belief to\nbelieve that there -- that person constitutes a future\ndanger, that would be different than in this situation where\nall the prosecutor had to do was look at its state's exhibit\nnumber 6, Your Honor, and read the dates. The prosecutor\ncould have discerned -\nQUESTION: Well, or the defendant's attorney could\nhave done that too, I suppose.\nMR. ALBRITTON: Absolutely, and he should have,\nYour Honor. Additionally, Your Honor, one of the -- the\nreasons for the narrow fundamental miscarriage of justice\nexception is this notion of gamesmanship, and as pointed out\nin the briefs, it is our position that there would never be\nany rational incentive for a petitioner to engage in\ngamesmanship when there was conclusive evidence that\nestablished he or she was not statutorily eligible for the\nsentence.\nMr. Haley's case is a perfect example. Even\nthough Mr. Haley was diligent and filed his state writ very\nshortly after the court of criminal appeals in Texas denied\ndiscretionary review, he's ended up spending 4 years more in\nprison than he was even authorized for under the statute.\nAdditionally, Your Honor, in discussing the\nstate's interest in this case, it is the Federal habeas\ncourt that in actuality is vindicating the Texas substantive\nlaw. Now that does not mean, of course, that there is no\ninterest of the state in its procedural laws. However, that\nrecognition indicates that, in effect, there's a wash of the\ninterest here, which would not undermine the application of\nthe fundamental miscarriage of justice exception in this\ncontext.\nQUESTION: And it's -- it's a little, I suppose,\npatronizing in -- in some sense for us to say that the\ndistrict courts, Federal courts are vindicating Texas'\ninterest in its own laws, although it's pretty obvious Texas\ndoesn't care about it in this case.\nMR. ALBRITTON: Certainly the -- the state doesn't\nseem to care about that interest with its position here.\nHowever, I don't think it's -- we do not think it's\npatronizing, Your Honor, because the Court is always\nrequired to balance the equities of the situation and\ndetermine whether the exception to the procedural default\nrule should apply. And in this case, we think that it is\nquite relevant that you're discussing -- and it would be so\nin all cases such as this that, under the rule we propose,\nbecause the sentence would always be outside the range\nauthorized by the legislature for this particular conduct.\nYour Honors, in relation, briefly here at the end\nto Almendarez-Torres, we agree with the Solicitor General\nthat if Almendarez-Torres does not control, then this case\nis -- is very easy and there need not be any application of\nSawyer, and that is because, as I said earlier, he would be\nactually innocent of the enhanced offense of theft by\nhabitual offender. As pointed out in our brief, Almendarez-\nTorres is not controlling because in this case there is an\nadditional -- there is something else that must be proven in\naddition to the fact of the prior convictions, and that is\nthe date of the commission of the second prior felony\noffense. For that reason -\nQUESTION: Well, isn't that pretty much the tail\nwagging the -- the tail wagging the dog, I mean, if -- if\nyou say that the date of the offense is -- is a separate\nelement?\nMR. ALBRITTON: Your Honor, the State of Texas in\nits judgment specifically required not only the -- in this\ncircumstance, not only the existence of two prior felony\nconvictions, but that the second was committed after, excuse\nme, the conviction of the first.\nQUESTION: Yes, but you're -- you're telling us\nthat the -- that the existence of the prior offense is not\nan element, right, but -- but that the date of the prior\noffense is -- is -\nMR. ALBRITTON: That -- that is incorrect, Your\nHonor. What we allege is that it is not the focus on the\nsequence of the convictions. When sequence is used, it is\nshorthand to describe the -- when the second offense was\ncommitted, and the date of commission of that offense is\nsomething separate and apart from the fact of those prior -\nof that prior conviction. So, Your Honor, we would\nrespectfully suggest that takes this outside of Almendarez-\nTorres, and therefore the Court can -- can determine that\nMr. Haley is actually innocent of the enhanced offense of\ntheft by habitual offender.\nFinally, Your Honor, in conclusion, I would\nrespectfully request the Court not to remand to the State of\nTexas -- excuse me, to the courts below, unless it reaches\nthe question presented and decides it contrary to the Fifth\nCircuit. If the Court decides that the ineffective\nassistance of counsel claim should have -- or cause and\nprejudice should have been reached first, since it was not\npresented in the question presented, the Court should not\nreach any issue in this case. Mr. Haley should be able to\ngo about his life and not be subject to a day more in prison\nthat the state concedes is unlawful, and as the court\nadvised -- as the state advised the district court, if this\nCourt were to reverse, it intends to put Mr. Haley back in\nprison for an additional 10 years that it specifically\nadmits is unlawful and not authorized by the legislature,\nand a remand presumably would result in the same sort of\ninjustice visited upon Mr. Haley by the state.\nFor those reasons, Your Honor, I respectfully\nsuggest that the Court affirm the judgment of the Fifth\nCircuit and hold that Mr. Haley has sufficiently established\nthat he is actually innocent, reach the merits of the claim,\nand -- and that's the only issue the Court needs to resolve.\nThank you very much.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Albritton.\nMr. Cruz, you have three minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF R. TED CRUZ\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. CRUZ: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I'd like\nto quickly revisit an exchange Justice Scalia had with Mr.\nAlbritton concerning Almendarez-Torres, and make the point\nthat even if this Court were at some future date to decide\nto overrule Almendarez-Torres, which I don't believe is\npresented in this case, that would not necessarily mean that\nthe actual innocence exception would extend to non-capital\nsentencing. The inquiries are altogether different. The\nformer, what was at -- the case at common law at the time of\nthe founding. The latter is, as the exchange illuminated, a\nquestion of what 28 U.S.C. Section 2254 provides.\nAnd I would note 2255, with respect to Federal\nhabeas, explicitly includes in its statutory text as one of\nthe grounds for granting habeas that a sentence is, quote,\nin excess of the maximum authorized by law. That's in 2255.\nIt is not in 2254. The only ground for granting habeas in\n2254 with respect to a state conviction is if someone is\nheld in custody of violation of the laws or Constitution of\nthe United States.\nAnd so it is altogether possible that this Court\ncould decide at some future date to -- to overrule\nAlmendarez-Torres and then yet nonetheless decide that in\nlooking to the ends of justice that now repeal language from\nthe habeas statute, that there is not an obligation to\nexcuse procedural default for every single conceivable\nsentencing error.\nQUESTION: But can I -- I just -- this is a case in\nwhich you yourself concede he shouldn't be in jail under the\nsubstantive law of Texas, and it is a case where you\nyourself agree there is a very big claim that the lawyer was\nincompetent. If we send this back, is Texas going to move\nto revoke his bail?\nMR. CRUZ: The -- the state is willing to allow the\nineffective assistance case to be litigated before\nproceeding to reincarcerate Mr. Haley, so we will wait until\nthat -- that claim is resolved before -- before -\nQUESTION: He's out while it's being litigated?\nMR. CRUZ: He -- he is out right now and the state\nwill leave him out until his claim is resolved with respect\nto that. With respect to the balance, which is -- which is\nultimately how this Court has analyzed the actual innocence\nexception, on the one side I would submit there is very\nlimited need for extending the actual innocence exception to\nnon-capital sentencing. Cause and prejudice can address\nsituations where relief is merited, such as perhaps Mr.\nHaley's.\nOn the other side, there is the risk of expanding\nthat. Non-capital sentencing, unlike actual innocence, I\ndidn't do it, of the crime, unlike actual innocence of\ndeath, non-capital sentencing is virtually ubiquitous.\nInterestingly, Mr. Haley's amici law professors in footnote\n13 of their brief acknowledge the ability of the slippery\nslope to extend beyond just increasing the statutory maximum\nto sentences within a range and to a whole host of factors\nthat the states used for sentencing factors, facts -\nfactors such as the amount of drugs, such as the value of\nstolen goods, such as the status of a victim, whether the\nvictim is elderly, whether the victim is a police officer.\nQUESTION: What has been the -- the experience in\nthe circuits that have adopted this rule applying the actual\ninnocence to sentencing? There are two circuits, aren't\nthere?\nMR. CRUZ: There have been relatively few cases\nthat have come up since those decisions, but I would note\nfirst of all we don't know what unpublished decisions are\nout there, and secondly, there's a significant difference\nbetween a circuit decision allowing an exception and a\ndecision of this Court.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Cruz. The\ncase is submitted.\n(Whereupon, at 11:11 p.m., the case in the above-\nentitled matter was submitted.)\n"
