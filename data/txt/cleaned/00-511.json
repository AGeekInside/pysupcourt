Iowa Utilities Board; Iowa\nUtilities Board v. General Communications.\nMr. Barr.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM P. BARR\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS IN NO. 00-511\nMR. BARR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nI'd like to start with a brief illustration that\nI think will help crystalize the legal issues, both the\nso-called forward-looking issues and the historical cost\nissues. The illustration itself starts with a forward-\nlooking perspective.\nNow, any firm that operates and builds a network\nincurs three costs going forward. Let's say I, the\nhypothetical new entrant capable of coming in today and\ninstantaneously deploying the most efficient network\npossible today, I would have to expend my baseline\nfacility costs. And let's say the FCC is right. Let's\nsay that costs about $180 billion to reproduce the system\ntoday from scratch. Then I would face my operating costs\nthat are dictated by the network that I just built. Let's\nsay those are $75 billion a year. And then I would face\nthe incremental capital investment that I would make each\nyear to upgrade and expand the network. Let's say that's\n$30 billion a year.\nNow, let me show why under TELRIC no firm that\nactually makes expenditures can recover them.\nQUESTION: What -- what was your second cost,\nthe 75?\nMR. BARR: The 75 is operating costs dictated by\nthe network that I've deployed.\nQUESTION: Per year?\nMR. BARR: Per year, which is how much our\noperating costs are per year.\nQUESTION: And the first was -- was the --\nthe --\nMR. BARR: Building the network from scratch.\nQUESTION: Just -- not the -- not the debt --\ndebt service on building it?\nMR. BARR: No.\nQUESTION: But the building it.\nMR. BARR: Yes.\nQUESTION: That's a -- that's a one-time cost.\nMR. BARR: Yes.\nQUESTION: Not an annual.\nMR. BARR: That's the sunk capital cost.\nQUESTION: But you're using the depreciated\nfigure, the 180 --\nMR. BARR: No. I'm starting -- I'm starting --\nyes. That's the -- that's the initial construction. I'm\n-- I'm not talking about me as the incumbent. I'm talking\nabout someone new coming in today.\nQUESTION: You -- you presented three questions.\nIs -- is your illustration and what you're about to\ndiscuss devoted to all three questions or to one in\nparticular?\nMR. BARR: I'm going to show -- it's devoted to\nall three, and I'm going to show how TELRIC does not,\ngoing forward, permit the recovery because it bases\ncompensation, for someone who has already expended money\non the network, on the imaginary cost structure of a\nhypothetical entrant who can be unconstrained and who's\ncapable, at any given time, of instantaneously deploying\nand ubiquitously deploying a brand new network that's the\nmost efficient at that point.\nNow, if you look at my $180 billion that I've\njust spent on building this network, in the world of\nTELRIC, I now face the prospect of people springing up on\na daily basis who are capable of taking advantage of any\nnew technology and any change in demographics and\nconfiguration to beat the efficiency of my network. And\nmy -- and -- and with that hypothesis, I won't be able to\nrecover my costs unless I have a high rate of return and\nfast depreciation.\nQUESTION: But we've said in -- in a number of\ncases, going back 50 years, that if you're talking about\nan unreasonable rate of return or a taking or something\nthat has constitutional implications, you -- you can't\nattack the method because different methods can work out\ndifferently. You have to point to some unjust final\nresult. And there hasn't been any final result here.\nMR. BARR: Well -- well, Your Honor, I think\nthat what the Court has done is made distinctions between\nends and means. Now, there can't be discretion under the\nConstitution as to how much is due. That can't be\ndiscretionary or else there's -- that eviscerates the Just\nCompensation Clause.\nWhat -- our view is that when you have a regime\nof compelled service, where the Government says, you got\nto spend the money to provide a mandated service, the\ntaking occurs at the point of expenditure. And that means\nthe Government has to give me a chance to get that -- a\nfair opportunity to get that money back.\nNow, what the Government has discretion over is\nthe means as to get me that money back.\nQUESTION: They're probably going to be set by\nState commissions, are they not?\nMR. BARR: Excuse me, Your Honor?\nQUESTION: Aren't -- aren't these costs and fees\ngoing to be ultimately set by State commissions applying\nthe FCC rules?\nMR. BARR: The rates themselves will be set by\n-- by the State commissions, implementing a methodology,\nand we are complaining about the methodology because --\nQUESTION: Well, but that's just what the cases\nsay you can't do, it seems to me, going back to the\nStone's opinion 50 years ago, the opinion of the Court in\nDuquesne, that you can't attack the methodology unless you\ncan point to something wrong in the actual fee that you're\nallowed or the rate that you're allowed.\nMR. BARR: Well, Your Honor, I think that the\nCourt has always reviewed methodologies. Now, sometimes\nrates can be evidence of a defect in a methodology, but it\ndoesn't have to be. And in the Duquesne itself, the Court\nsaid if the methodology is not compensating you for a\nmethodological risk to which you are exposed, that's a\nproblem today, and that is our claim, that the methodology\nitself exposes us to a risk of not recovering what we\nspend. And -- and we are entitled to compensation for\nthat risk.\nIf the taking --\nQUESTION: Excuse me. Just a risk? It's -- I\nmean, but there's always a risk, I suppose, until you get\nthe final determination by whoever the ratemaker is. I\nthought our prior cases held that so long as -- so long as\nit's possible under the -- under the rate structure for\nyou to be compensated fully, you have no complaint until\n-- you know, until the final -- the final rate is\ndetermined. At that point, you can come in and complain,\nbut the mere possibility that they may pick the wrong rate\nsurely is not enough to give you a takings claim.\nMR. BARR: Well, if -- if we are correct that we\nare entitled to a fair opportunity to recover our costs\nand the Government decides that they're going to spin a\nroulette wheel, I can't come in and say that's a problem?\nThat exposes me to risk?\nThe reason we have -- why do we have\nmethodologies set in the first place instead of later --\ninstead of later proceedings? We have them to set up\nfront a promise to pay that sets investor expectations and\nensures that the users, not the Government, is going to\nend up footing the bill. That's why we have ratemaking.\nAnd this Court has always reviewed methodologies to\ndetermine whether or not they comport with the\nconstitutional standard and whatever Congress has directed\nin the statute.\nNow, it's very important that we focus on the\ndifference between the ends and the means. What is it --\nwhat do you mean when you say, well, the Government has\ndiscretion over methodology? It can't mean that they have\ndiscretion as to how much is ultimately due. That takes\nthe Court out of the business and just eviscerates the\nJust Compensation Clause.\nWhat it means is that once it's determined that\nI have an -- I should get an opportunity to get my costs\nback, the Government can expose me to risks. The\nGovernment doesn't have to guarantee it and sign me a\ncheck. They can measure my recovery with some other\nformula, as you pointed out in your concurrence opinion in\nDuquesne, Justice Scalia. They can formulate the\nmethodology in -- in another way. But when you formulate\nit in another way, when you untether recovery from\nhistorical costs or my expenditure, that creates a risk.\nNow, sometimes it may create an opportunity in an -- in an\nage of inflation. In an age of deflation, it may cause a\nrisk.\nQUESTION: But numerous cases have said that the\nratemaking agency is not required to follow -- to adopt\nhistorical costs as the method of fixing rates.\nMR. BARR: That's the method, but the objective\nhas to be an opportunity of getting me back my costs.\nWhat -- when -- when I am required to spend\nmoney by the Government -- when I'm required to spend\nmoney by the Government -- let's say it would cost the\nGovernment a billion dollars today to provide a public\ngood and service. And the Government, instead of spending\nthat today, which anyone would have to spend, comes to me\nand conscripts my private capital into building this thing\nfor a billion dollars, and then later says, well, I don't\nhave to worry about getting you back a billion dollars.\nThat's not my business. I have discretion over a\nmethodology.\nThe question -- what is meant by discretion on a\nmethodology is that the Government can expose you to risk\nas long as it compensates you for the risk. And that's\nexactly what Duquesne said.\nQUESTION: Now, you say this case is different\nfrom previous rate cases. In the previous rate cases, the\nexpenditure has been made and the question is fair\ncompensation, just compensation. You say here you're\nbeing asked to expend an additional out-of-pocket sum, and\nyou're entitled to know what the methodology is at the\noutset. Is that --\nMR. BARR: No. I'm saying that all the --\nQUESTION: Is that your point?\nMR. BARR: No. My -- my point is that all\nmethodologies are the Government's promise to pay at the\ntime it takes the property. The Government takes a\nproperty in a forced -- in -- in a regime of compelled\nservice, the taking occurs when I spend the money. If I\nhave $1,000 --\nQUESTION: But that's true in any ratemaking\ncase.\nMR. BARR: Right.\nQUESTION: And -- and the Chief Justice and\nJustice Scalia are saying our cases say we have to wait to\nsee what the rate is. I thought your position was, well,\nthis is different because we have an initial outlay that\nwe're required to make now. I'm not trying to -- maybe I\nmisunderstand your argument.\nMR. BARR: Well, no, that's right. The reason\nwe have methodologies and the reason I'm entitled to know\nthat I have a fair opportunity to recover it is that I\nshouldn't be forced to spend money, to lay out money\nunless have a fair opportunity to get it back.\nQUESTION: No. But your whole argument is\nassuming that by adopting this particular methodology, it\nis some kind of a necessary conclusion that at the end of\nthe day, you're going to be getting less of a return than\nyou would have gotten if an historic cost methodology had\n-- had been employed. And that simply is not true. We\ndon't know whether that is so or not.\nMR. BARR: Well, actually, you know, we do know\nwhether it's so. I was just about to explain on the\nforward-looking basis. But -- but --\nQUESTION: Then -- then why haven't you come in\ntelling us about rates that you were getting that in fact\nare bleeding you dry. You haven't made that argument.\nThat's not your case.\nMR. BARR: Well, because I'm not -- well, there\nare two reasons. One, we're not complaining about a rate.\nA rate is evidence of a defect. It is not an -- we're not\n-- we're not complaining about a specific application.\nWe're complaining about a systemic defect in the\nmethodology.\nQUESTION: And -- and I could understand your\nargument if that systemic defect had a -- by -- by some\nlogical necessity, the conclusion of compensating you for\nwhat, on traditional standards of review, would be a\nconfiscatory rate.\nMR. BARR: Yes.\nQUESTION: But there is no such necessity that I\ncan find in your argument. I just don't see where that\nstep comes in.\nMR. BARR: There are --\nQUESTION: You don't concede that necessity, do\nyou?\nMR. BARR: No, I don't.\nQUESTION: Otherwise, you would think that a --\nthat spinning a -- spinning a wheel of fortune would be an\nadequate methodology.\nMR. BARR: Right. Rates --\nQUESTION: No. You wouldn't. You wouldn't\nconcede that.\nQUESTION: I -- I agree with you that -- that we\nwould not accept a spinning wheel as -- as being adequate,\nalthough spinning a wheel might give you compensation. it\nmight not give you compensation. Who can say?\nMR. BARR: In -- in the Duquesne case, the Court\nsaid even a small shift in methodology warrants an\nincrease in the risk of premium because you are always\nentitled to get pay for -- to whatever risk you're exposed\nto. That's what methodological risk is.\nThere are two things on the face of this\norder --\nQUESTION: And where -- and where does the\nincrease in the premium take place? It takes place in\nState ratemaking, doesn't it?\nMR. BARR: The problem here -- the problem here\nin this order -- there are two --\nQUESTION: But that is correct, isn't it?\nThat's -- that's where the --\nMR. BARR: No. The -- the decision took place\nin the Federal proceeding, and it took place in paragraph\n688 and 702 of the order. And if we could look at those\nparagraphs, we pointed out --\nQUESTION: Where -- where do we find them?\nMR. BARR: Joint appendix 385-386 and joint\nappendix 395.\nWe pointed out that if you're going to make up a\nworld in which our compensation is constrained as if we\nhad intense competition today, then you should use the\nsame methodology in imputing what the rate of return and\nwhat the depreciation would be. You can't imagine I'm in\na world of turbo-charged technological risk and not give\nme that rate of return.\nOn page -- at paragraph 688, the Government\nsaid, well, you know, you might be entitled to -- we\nunderstand your argument about a higher rate of return,\nbut you don't have that competition today. And our point\nis you've created a dichotomy between two different\nworlds, a world that you say is intensely competitive, in\nfact, in which our network is a commodity, and a world in\nwhich you say competition will be gradual and we're still\na bottleneck. They've created a dichotomy.\nThen they say, you get your costs back, your\ndirect costs back, as if you were in a world of intense\ncompetition. But when it comes to making the -- that\nexposes us to a methodological risk. The risk of\ninvesting a dollar in a world where you -- where you have\na historical cost methodology and investing it under\nTELRIC is a different risk. When -- when it comes to\nmaking that adjustment, they say, you can't do that.\nWe're going to flip-flop. We're going to pretend you're\nin a world of gradual competition, and that's on paragraph\n702 where they say, you start with your existing closed\nmarket rate of return and your closed market depreciation,\nand the only time you can make an adjustment is to adjust\nfor actual competition. Well, actual competition is a\ndifferent risk because I'm being exposed to imaginary\ncompetition.\nQUESTION: If all of that is true and you're\nexposed to so much greater risk, I assume that your costs\nof capital will be much higher. It will be much harder to\nborrow money. And so all of those risks will ultimately\nbe reflected in the amounts that the State ratemaking\nagencies will have to allow you for cost of capital.\nMR. BARR: The States -- the issue here is the\ncost of capital in the UNE business, our wholesale\nbusiness. Paragraph 702 prohibits the States from taking\ninto account our historical costs, and it says you have to\nset the rate of return without a view toward recovering\nthose costs. You cannot adjust for the risk. The rule\nitself, rule 505, and paragraph 702 -- the whole point of\na methodology is to say if -- if I'm going to shift to\nsome other basis of compensation other than historical --\nQUESTION: I don't really read 702 as saying\nwhat you say it says, Mr. Barr. Maybe I'm missing\nsomething.\nMR. BARR: Well, Your Honor, it -- it does say\nthat you use -- you start with the current rate of return\nand the current depreciation.\nQUESTION: Correct.\nMR. BARR: It says that we bear the burden in\nthe State proceedings of showing a business risk, and then\nit goes on to say that the business risk relates to actual\ncompetition. And -- and, indeed, in the universal service\nproceeding, paragraph 254 and 5 --\nQUESTION: But it also makes the very point\nJustice Scalia made, that we recognize the incumbent LEC's\nare likely to face increased risks by reason of the\nincreased cost of capital. It does refer to --\nMR. BARR: Yes. They're talking about economic\ncosts of capital. And the key question is, which economy\nin this hypothetical world? Is it the real economy, or is\nit your hypothetical world? Their rule says, increases in\nrate of return are based on actual competition. We are\nbeing exposed today to our pricing as if we lived in a\nworld of intense competition, in which our product is a\ncommodity, where we would need a very high rate of return.\nAnd in their universal service proceeding where\nthe FCC applied this methodology, it applied existing\nclosed market rate of return and existing depreciation\nschedules. In its opening brief on page 8, it said, we\nare authorizing the States to change the rate of return\nbased on actual levels of competition, but the\nmethodological risk is not actual competition. The\nmethodological risk is their cost recovery rule. They're\nmimicking an intensely competitive market.\nWe gave examples in our brief where\nMassachusetts tried to make different rates of return and\nthey castigated them for using a different rate of return\nin the wholesale business than in the retail business.\nIn the retail business, we are exposed to actual\ncompetition. In the wholesale business, we are exposed to\nhypothetical intense competition where our network is\ndeemed to be a commodity, and that's the only price we can\nderive. If we sell a product in the retail market, we get\nan opportunity to get our historical costs. If we sell it\nin the wholesale market, we're deprived of that because\nthe -- the cost is brought down without a corresponding\nincrease.\nThere are two things on the face of the order --\ntwo things on the face of the order that are blatantly\nillegal -- on their face, without looking at a rate.\nThe first is it says, we are creating a\nmethodological risk, and we're not going to allow an\nadjustment of the rate of return to reflect that\nmethodological risk. We will not even let you look at the\ndelta, the risk of a delta between your historical costs\nand whatever this comes out to be.\nThe whole point of a methodology is you have to\nlook at the delta. Even Smyth v. Ames said you just don't\nlook at a reproduction cost. You have to look at in\nrelation to historical cost.\nSo, number one, in the rule itself they say you\ncannot look at historical costs. You can't say, you know,\nwhat's the risk here between one and the other and adjust.\nThe second thing that is facially illegal and\nagain has nothing to do with rates is how do they value\nour input. If we're right that the taking occurs at the\npoint of dedication, at the point of expenditure, then we\nhave a right to have our property valued when we spend it.\nWhen I spend operating costs, I have a right to a fair\nopportunity to get those back.\nQUESTION: But that's true of any utility in\nthose cases that we've -- we've decided over the --\nMR. BARR: And they don't. They don't. What\nthey say is when they value our expenditure, they apply --\ntheir --\nQUESTION: Just -- who is they?\nMR. BARR: The FCC rule.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. BARR: Okay. The FCC rule values our\nexpenditures based on TELRIC, but TELRIC is the efficiency\nthat can be achieved by someone who doesn't have a sunk\nnetwork and therefore has no path dependencies and\ntherefore whose incremental cost is going to be lower than\nours. And -- and what they say is, you spend $75 billion\nfor operating expense? Well, our TELRIC guy -- you know,\nhe could do it for $50 billion. So, you're getting credit\nfor $50 billion.\nAnd then on my incremental expenditures, if I --\nonce I build a network and I have it in the ground, I'm\npath-dependent. If I build a set of telephone poles to\nthis subdivision, and the next year a subdivision opens up\nover here, okay, the most efficient way for me to provide\nit is to maybe do a nice, big, long line over there, and\nthat might cost me $10 million. The FCC says, we don't\ncare because at that point in time, we're going to\nhypothesize that someone can build a blank slate network\nand do it for 5 because they have the luxury of building\nit to meet that capacity on a blank slate.\nQUESTION: Is the Government going to tell us\nthat there are other ways you can recover that cost\nthrough depreciation or --\nMR. BARR: No, because the thing they're -- the\nthing they're depreciating is the TELRIC price. This is\n-- this is the weirdness of the Government's rule. I\nspend $10 billion. It's necessary, prudent. It's the\nmost efficient way for me to produce.\nQUESTION: Are they going to tell us you get it\nback on the cost of capital?\nMR. BARR: No.\nQUESTION: Or is your answer the same because\nit's just the capital based on the TELRIC --\nMR. BARR: Their briefs talk about cost of\ncapital. Here's the -- here's the rub. When they say,\nwell, we're going to value that as if it's 5 because\nsomeone else could be more efficient, a hypothetical\nperson in a perfect market could be more efficient, so\nwe're going to give you 5. But don't worry. Something\nmight happen to the rate of return. The rule itself says\nyou cannot adjust the rate of return to recover the\nhistorical cost. You can't. And the rate of return\nthey're going to give us is on the 5, not on the 10, and\nthe depreciation is of the 5, not on the 10.\nThere are two defects here. We're entitled to\n-- to the value of what we have to spend.\nWhat they do is they take --\nQUESTION: What about costs of capital?\nMR. BARR: Excuse me?\nQUESTION: Can you get it back in costs of\ncapital? What costs of capital do they allow you?\nMR. BARR: They allow the cost of capital that\nexists in a closed market. The pricing that they give us\nis the pricing that they say would exist if our network\nwere a commodity. They don't change for the risk.\nIn other words, if today I spend $10 billion and\nthat's prudent and necessary, and I -- I'm in a closed\nmarket or a market that's just been opened and I get 15\npercent or 12 percent, that's scenario one.\nThen they turn around and say, these same\nfacilities you're now going to have to sell to somebody\nelse, not in the retail market where you get 15 percent on\n$10 billion. Now you have to sell them to your\ncompetitors, and there you're going to get 15 percent on\n$7 billion. And -- and the point is that the risk now\nthat my stuff is going to be valued at 7 instead of 10 is\na risk, and the only way I can get compensated is by a\nhigher rate of return.\nQUESTION: But your point there -- the answer to\nJustice Scalia's question, I take it, was forgetting your\nfirst problem -- that's your first problem. Right? The\none you brought up at the beginning.\nMR. BARR: Correct.\nQUESTION: The fact that they're pretending\nactual competition is what makes the difference, but what\nthe problem arises out of is the fact that they're pricing\non a hypothetically perfectly competitive market.\nMR. BARR: Right.\nQUESTION: That's your first point.\nMR. BARR: Right.\nQUESTION: If that point were wrong, then the\nanswer to Justice Scalia, I take it, would be, there's no\nother problem. I mean, if they did that right and they\nlowered your new investment from $10 million to $5 million\nbecause that was TELRIC, in principle, they could get the\nmoney back for you by giving you a higher rate of return\non your -- on your TELRIC estimated cost of capital.\nMR. BARR: The rule says no. But -- but if you\nchange the rule, you theoretically could do a high enough\nrate of return. But it doesn't solve the problem.\nQUESTION: Where does the rule say no? Give us\nthe -- the exact text where the rule says no.\nMR. BARR: Okay. Paragraph 702 of -- of the\norder.\nQUESTION: 395?\nMR. BARR: And it also asks -- it's not in the\nrecord. It's a separate ruling, but the universal service\nproceeding, paragraph --\nQUESTION: This is -- this is on -- this is at\n395 of the joint appendix?\nMR. BARR: Yes.\nAnd this is how it has been implemented by the\nFCC --\nQUESTION: And -- and can you show us the\nlanguage there?\nQUESTION: Yes. Where? What's the language?\nMR. BARR: That the -- that the existing rate of\nreturn and existing depreciation are reasonable starting\npoints.\nQUESTION: Starting points.\nQUESTION: Yes, starting points.\nQUESTION: Are you talking about rule 707?\nQUESTION: That's right.\nQUESTION: 702.\nMR. BARR: 702.\nQUESTION: Page 395.\nMR. BARR: This is not a calculation starting\npoint. This is what's in effect. Then we have the burden\nof showing actual competition -- actual competition. It\nis not a reasonable starting point even if it was a\ntemporal exercise because we are being exposed today to\nintense competition through the rule.\nQUESTION: Now, but you're saying rule 702\nprevents you from getting back what you otherwise should\nhave through capital costs?\nMR. BARR: Yes. In fact, they've admitted it in\ntheir brief.\nQUESTION: And where -- and where -- what\nlanguage in rule 702 are you relying on?\nMR. BARR: I'm relying on the -- on the whole\nfirst half of that paragraph where they say, you start\nwith existing. We have the burden of showing business\nrisk, and then the remainder of that paragraph talks about\nactual competition.\nIt's not in the record, but it is a separate\norder.\nQUESTION: Okay. But I -- since you're --\nyou're relying on it heavily for a particular proposition,\nI think you ought to be able to come closer than you have\nto point out exactly what language supports your position.\nMR. BARR: We recognize that incumbent LEC's are\nlikely to face increased risks given the overall increases\nin competition in the industry, which might warrant an\nincreased cost of capital. That's the standard, whether\nthere's actual competition.\nThat's what they say in paragraph 688. We said,\nlook, in the TELRIC world, we need a higher rate of\nreturn. They say USTA's argument unrealistically assumes\nthat competitive entry would be instantaneous. The more\nreasonable assumption of entry occurring over time will\nreduce the costs associated with sunk investment.\nOur point is entry is instantaneous under TELRIC\nbecause that's the hypothesis. We're priced as if there's\ninstantaneous entry.\nQUESTION: At the bottom of page 83a, toward the\nend of rule 702, it says, States may adjust the cost of\ncapital if a party demonstrates to a State commission that\neither a higher or lower level of cost of capital is\nwarranted without the commission conducting a rate of\nreturn or other rate-based proceeding. That would seem to\nallow the State commissions to -- to do what you want\ndone.\nMR. BARR: That paragraph -- I think a fair\nreading of that paragraph and the way it is read and\napplied including --\nQUESTION: What about the language I just quoted\nto you? How do you distinguish that if you don't -- if\nyou don't agree with me?\nMR. BARR: I would distinguish it by then\nlooking at the rule, which is rule 505, and that's on\njoint appendix 51 and 52. And it tells you what you\ncannot consider in setting forward-looking costs,\nincluding forward-looking cost of capital. And (d) says\n-- page 52 -- the following factors shall not be\nconsidered in a calculation of the forward-looking\neconomic cost of an element. Embedded costs.\nNow, cost of capital under (b)(2) is the cost of\ncapital to recover the TELRIC price, not your historical\nprice. How can --\nQUESTION: But isn't -- isn't --\nMR. BARR: -- (d)(1) on its face -- excuse me,\nYour Honor.\nQUESTION: No. I just want to go back to\nsomething I don't understand. Isn't (d) -- I'm sorry.\nYes. Isn't (d)(1) simply talking about the TELRIC method\nas opposed to the ultimate ratemaking methodology? In --\nin -- I'm sorry. As opposed to the ultimate determination\nof what would be an appropriate rate using TELRIC\nvaluation.\nMR. BARR: That's right, and that's a directive\nto the State.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. BARR: That's a directive to the State. The\nStates cannot --\nQUESTION: But that is not -- if -- if you\nunderstand by the distinction what I understand by the\ndistinction, it is not a directive to the State which\nbinds them in the ultimate rate that they can set.\nMR. BARR: It binds -- yes, it does bind me.\nThe rate -- the rate cannot --\nQUESTION: Then I don't understand it.\nMR. BARR: They cannot consider in -- in setting\nthe cost of capital historical costs.\nQUESTION: Well, but they don't have to consider\nit if they give you a high enough rate on your TELRIC\ncosts. Let's assume they have --\nMR. BARR: How do they determine what's high\nenough, Your Honor?\nQUESTION: Let's assume that your past costs\nwere, indeed, $10 million, and they're saying, well, it's\njust 5 because somebody else could do it for 5 if they\ncame in right now. So long as they give you a higher\npercentage on that 5, you're going to be in just as good\nshape as if they were giving you your 15 percent on the\n10.\nMR. BARR: And how do they determine what's high\nenough unless you have a standard?\nQUESTION: They can determine on the basis of\nwhat your risk is. And -- and --\nMR. BARR: The risk of what?\nQUESTION: -- it's very -- it's -- your risk of\ncontinuing to put in capital which will -- which will not\n-- which you will not be able to have taken into account\nin setting the rate.\nMR. BARR: Well, I think, you know, your\nconcurrence in -- in Duquesne, Justice Scalia, made a very\nfundamental point, which is you can't talk about return on\nrisk without implying a standard. What's the risk you're\ncompensating me for? What's the risk you're compensating\nme for? It's the risk I'm not going to be able to recover\nmy capital.\nQUESTION: But now --\nMR. BARR: How -- how can you figure that out\nwithout looking at what my capital is in relation to what\nyou're allowing me?\nQUESTION: Right. That may all be true, and I\nhave only one question to ask, and I'm asking it. I don't\nknow the answer, and I -- it may help or not help.\nBut when I read the briefs, I noticed you\nstarted with the valuation of the capital base of around\n$340 billion-$350 billion. And then when we look at the\ndepreciated base, it comes to around $140 billion-$150\nbillion across the country.\nAnd I got the impression from the brief, that if\n-- if that's the valuation -- mirabile dictu my Latin\nprofessor used to say. The rate of return is okay. That\n-- that however miraculously they've come to this -- to\nthis result -- and I've read the criticisms. They give\nyou a quarter of the telephone pole. They -- they deduct\n22 percent for there being competition. They assume that\nthe most efficient firm has the administrative costs of\nall the firms. They do all the things on depreciation\nthat you say. They do the same thing on capital. And\nyet, somehow the result seems to be that you're earning a\nfair rate of return on the depreciated value of the\ncapital, namely $140 billion-$150 billion-$160 billion, in\nthat range.\nNow -- now I'm asking a question to get an\nanswer.\nMR. BARR: That was mixing the apples and\noranges. The -- that -- that's mixing the original cost\nof the hypothetical network with the depreciated value of\nour network. What's relevant is what's our capital charge\nthat's allowed or our depreciation expense.\nBefore TELRIC came along, I was recovering,\nlet's say, $340 billion over 10 years, and I'm halfway\nthrough, generally. So, I have about 170 to go in 5\nyears. They come along and say under your new network,\nyou're going to get 170 because that's how much a new\nnetwork would cost, not one that's half depreciated, and\nyou get to recover that over 10 years. So, now my\ndepreciation expense has been halved.\nQUESTION: So, what you're saying is in response\nto what I said, that I am wrong in saying that the TELRIC-\nset depreciation, capital return, and other numbers -- I\nam wrong in saying that they will earn you a fair rate of\nreturn on $140 billion. To the contrary, they will earn\nyou only half the return you're entitled to on that 140.\nMR. BARR: Correct.\nQUESTION: And I can find that in the -- is\nthere anything on that in the record?\nMR. BARR: There's a -- well --\nQUESTION: No.\nMR. BARR: Well, by using the same depreciation\nschedule and hypothesizing a new network, that reduces my\n-- that reduces my capital charge.\nNow, we have shown --\nQUESTION: The capital charge will fall from\n$140 billion. A TELRIC valuation of those FCC numbers\nwhich are on the two pages that they have all -- a TELRIC\nvaluation of that will not end up with the number 165, 7\n-- 70 billion approximately. It will end up with the\nnumber 70 or 80.\nMR. BARR: No. They will end up -- they will\nsay we're going to imagine you have a new network and can\ndepreciated it over the next 10 years, when in fact I have\na network that I have 5 more years to depreciate 170 on.\nThe effect of that is to half my recovery because in 5\nyears I have to buy a new switch, and I strand what I\nhaven't yet recovered.\nQUESTION: But you're saying the commission sets\nthe depreciation period and binds the State commissions by\nthat?\nMR. BARR: The State -- well, yes. They -- the\n-- the commission tells the States what to do.\nQUESTION: And the commission says, 5-year\ndepreciation -- 10-year depreciation, not 5, or 5 not 10.\nThat's -- the commission forces that on the States?\nMR. BARR: Yes. The commission says --\nQUESTION: Can -- can --\nMR. BARR: -- economic depreciation --\nQUESTION: Okay. Can you point to a -- a\ncommission statement to that effect?\nMR. BARR: Yes. This is -- this is a separate\nproceeding, but it's their application of TELRIC.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. BARR: In the universal service. They say\nthe rate of return must either be --\nQUESTION: What are you reading from?\nMR. BARR: Paragraph 250 of that order. It's a\n-- it's a published opinion, but it's not part of the\nrecord.\nQUESTION: It's not in the record?\nMR. BARR: It's not in the joint appendix, but\nit's a -- it's the parallel proceeding to this where they\nwere setting TELRIC for our universal service prices.\nThe first sentence of paragraph 4: The rate of\nreturn must be either the authorized Federal rate of\nreturn on the interstate or the State-prescribed rate. In\nother words, they're saying it has to be -- the same rate\nof return as you have in the retail business has to be in\nthe wholesale business.\nQUESTION: Or -- or the State -- was this last\npart, or the State-prescribed rate?\nMR. BARR: Retail rate. The retail rate.\nQUESTION: Well, but would you read again the\nsentence?\nMR. BARR: Yes. It has to be either the Federal\ninterstate -- that's a retail rate. Okay? And the only\nrisk there --\nQUESTION: Let's not intersperse. Let's just\nread it.\nMR. BARR: Or the State's prescribed rate of\nreturn for intrastate -- intrastate services. These are\nretail rates based on the --\nQUESTION: These are -- these are rates of\nreturn. Now, tell me how it is that that -- those\nstatements with respect to rates of return determine a\ndepreciation period.\nMR. BARR: Well, the next paragraph, paragraph\n5, says that we agree with those commentators that argue\nthat currently authorized lines should be used because the\nhigh cost areas are unlikely to face a serious competitive\nthreat. Again, they are using existing depreciation based\non a world of gradual competition in our retail business\nand they are applying it to prices that they are\nformulating based on the hypothesis of radical competition\nthat has commoditized our product and reduced our direct\ncost by half.\nNow, the fact is this is a bifurcated\nproceeding. The Feds set the methodology. The States set\nthe rates. The Federal Government has told the States\nwhat to do, and you'll see in our brief that example where\nthe State tries to use a different rate of return, the FCC\nslaps them down. It's very clear.\nNow, they've made an admission in their own\nbrief on page -- on their reply brief, which -- on -- on\npage 12, note 8. And they say that the -- the risk is not\njust the -- this is footnote 8. It says, the risk is not\njust the risk of actual competition, but obviously you\nhave to have a methodological risk adjustment.\nQUESTION: What part of footnote 8 are you\nrelying on?\nMR. BARR: That second consideration is\nnotwithstanding the incumbent's contrary suggestion\nimplicit in any determination of the true economic cost of\ncapital.\nOur problem is that's not what the order said.\nThat's a post hoc brief. And if this Court were to rule\nthat the rate of return has to be adjusted based on the\nhypothesis of actual competition, that takes care of part\nof the problem. But that's not what the rule says. It's\nnot what it was implemented as, and now they are making\nthis concession in their brief. Now, that's only part of\nthe problem.\nThe other problem under forward-looking is\nthey're using it to value our network at the time of\ndedication, and our expenditures -- as I explained, when\nwe spend money, they act as if we're not really spending\nthat amount of money. We're somebody else. And what\nthey're using is the Government coming up and taking\nsomeone's property and saying I'm going to mimic away your\nopportunity to recover it. I'm going to imagine it in a\nworld in which you do not have the opportunity of\nrecovering your property.\nIf that -- if that is the principle, that the\nGovernment can take property and then in the name of\nmimicking competition, say, you're not going to have the\nopportunity recover it, what's the limiting principle of\nthat rule? You can mimic -- when I put in $1,000, I need\nthe opportunity to get it back. That's what I'm\nsurrendering, to deploy it, to redeploy it, to use my wits\nto enhance and preserve its value. When I expend the\nmoney into a regime of compelled service, that's when\nthose opportunities go away. And that's the point of the\ntaking. I'm locked into spending the money. The\nGovernment tells me who to serve, what to charge, what\nquality to provide, and I can't redeploy it elsewhere.\nIn that circumstance, the Government can't say,\nnow I'm going to define your opportunity in this business\nas an opportunity that doesn't give you the opportunity to\nrecover your cost. Because then that's just a roving\nlicense to go around, take property, and say, now I'm\ngoing to imagine you don't have the opportunity to recover\nit.\nThe Just Compensation Clause says, if you take\naway $1,000, you're taking my opportunity as to that\n$1,000. You have to give me back an opportunity as to\n$1,000. And if this is -- if this is how you value\nproperty -- I mean, this Court has been very clear, if\nyou're going to invoke a market, it better be a real\nmarket. You have to have a real observable market. And\nthis Court has held that when the Government comes along\nand takes assets like this, it's the opportunity cost.\nThis case is just like Monongahela. There the\nState gave a company a franchise to build a lock and dam\nand gave it tolls to recoup its costs. So, it had a\nfranchise, a State franchise with tolls. The Federal\nGovernment said, we think this thing is worth X,\nappropriated the money, and took the lock and dam. The\nCourt said, well, wait a minute. You've come and taken\nthis lock and dam. Opportunity costs. You can't just\nmake up a value for it.\nQUESTION: But here -- here no property is taken\nin the condemnation sense of the word. That was a\ncondemnation proceeding. Just compensation. No property\nof yours is actually taken here in that sense, is it?\nMR. BARR: No, that's wrong in two respects.\nFirst, there's actual occupation of our facilities to our\nexclusion. They can occupy and exclude us from use of our\nfacilities.\nQUESTION: Well, have they done so?\nMR. BARR: Yes, 6 percent of our lines have been\ntaken in this respect.\nNow, but in any event, we have an -- I mean,\nthis is a utility case. This is not a regulatory taking.\nAnd the quid pro quo for us having spent all this money is\nan expectancy. That creates an expectation interest.\nQUESTION: Yes, but I don't think it comes under\nthe Just Compensation Clause. The cases involved -- you\nknow, go back to Smyth against Ames -- have not talked in\nterms of just compensation. They've talked in terms of\nfair return and due process. There is a constitutional\nprinciple involved, but I don't think it's the Just\nCompensation Clause.\nMR. BARR: Well, Your Honor, I respectfully\ndisagree because I think the reason -- when you dedicate\nproperty and there's a taking, the reason the Government\nhas to come up with a methodology to pay is precisely\nbecause it has to promise to pay at the point of the\ndedication. The methodology is the promise to pay. It's\nsaying, you put this in, here's how you're going to get\nyour money back. That's why we have ratemaking. It is\nthe Government's promise to pay. It creates an\nexpectation. And here they promise -- and this takes\nus --\nQUESTION: You're saying every -- every breach\nof contract by the Government is a taking. I mean, that\n-- that's a little extreme, isn't it? I mean, every\ntime --\nMR. BARR: This Court has recognized --\nQUESTION: Every time the Government enters a\ncontract, it creates an expectation, and whenever the\nGovernment breaks a contract, it's a -- it's a taking.\nMR. BARR: It's not a contract, Your Honor.\nThis is a dedication by a utility, and there are three\nthings going on here, which this Court has always\nrecognized create a property interest, such as in -- in\nRussell v. Sebastian.\nNumber one, the Government requires us to serve.\nThis is compelled. Okay?\nNumber two --\nQUESTION: Compelled because you agreed to it.\nThat was part of the contract. You put up the money and\nyou'll -- you'll have to serve and we'll provide you with\na reasonable rate of return. That was the deal.\nMR. BARR: A return in order to give us a fair\nopportunity to get our money back.\nAnd in determining what the methodology was for\nour initial investment, the Government said, okay, guys,\nyou put in all this money -- and now I'm shifting to the\nhistorical part of the case. You put in all this money,\nand here's the deal. You will be -- you will not have the\nrisk of devaluation, and therefore, we're not going to pay\nyou a high rate of return. So, we got low rates of return\nfor all these years.\nAnd now they're retroactively saying, we're\nchanging our mind. We're going to -- we're going to start\nrevaluing your property and we're going to apply that\nagainst your historical cost.\nQUESTION: Mr. Barr, may I ask -- one piece of\nthis case is you made this investment for your local\ntelephone business. That -- that continues. That's not\ntouched by anything we're talking about now. You get that\nrate on your -- what is the vast majority of your\nbusiness. That investment -- you get that rate set by the\nlocal public utility commissions as -- as always. Isn't\nthat so? So, your telephone service business isn't\ntouched by any of this.\nMR. BARR: These use the same facilities. So,\nthis is occupying the facilities we use for our retail,\nand then it deprives us of using --\nQUESTION: But you're getting back the lion's\nshare.\nMR. BARR: Well, yes, but that's like going to\nGM and saying give away your Chevys because you're still\nmaking money.\nQUESTION: And then there's another piece of it\nthat I'd like you to tell me how it fits in, and that is\nthe quid pro quo of you can get into for the first time a\nnew business, that you can get into the long distance\nbusiness. Doesn't that have some kind of value?\nMR. BARR: No. I think if there was going to be\nsome quid pro quo in the statute, Congress has to define\nit. Otherwise the Government agency can go up to someone\nand say, you know, we waived some procedure for you in the\nINS, and therefore now we're going to take away your car.\nTheir quid pro quo has to be spelled out by Congress.\nBut in any event, we didn't get a special favor.\nIt said, once you purge yourself of any defect, you can\nact like everybody else.\nOne final point that's very critical here, which\nis the language in the statute in 252, which goes on -- it\ndoesn't say just -- just and reasonable in 251(c). It\nsays just and reasonable. This says something else in\naddition as opposed to Hope where the Court said there was\nno further specification of how rates were to be\ndetermined. It says, here determinations of rate have to\nbe based on the cost of providing.\nThat provision can only make sense and only has\nan office in the statute if it is somehow delimiting how\njust and reasonable rates are to be determined. The\nGovernment's view is, just and reasonable, that gives us\nall the discretion in the world. There's other language\nhere, and that can only be reasonable -- reasonably --\nQUESTION: Well, no. It also argues that the\nword cost is ambiguous.\nMR. BARR: Not in the context -- you have cost\nand you have value methodologies. If the office of that\nstatute -- of that provision is to delimit discretion as\nto what kind of methodology -- the -- cost on its face\nrefers to a cost-based methodology, not a value\nmethodology.\nI reserve the balance of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Barr.\nGeneral Olson, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON\nON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL PETITIONERS\nMR. OLSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nThe colloquy that we have just heard illustrates\nwhy this Court has said over and over again in the context\nof ratemaking, in precisely the context we're talking\nabout here, that the Court evaluates results not\nmethodologies; impacts, not means; and consequences, not\ntechniques.\nQUESTION: Do you think that really means that\nyou could come up here with a -- with a -- with an FCC\nscheme that says we're going to spin a wheel, and if it\nlands in the right place, you're going to get a good rate,\nif it lands in another place, you're going to get a bad\nrate?\nMR. OLSON: Well, there might be --\nQUESTION: We couldn't say that that is\nirrational and -- and -- does -- is not designed to\nprovide a fair rate of return? Don't you have the burden\nof showing that this is at least designed to -- to provide\na fair rate of return?\nMR. OLSON: This Court has said that the\nchallenger of a rate has a heavy burden to make a\nconvincing case that the outcome is confiscatory. Now,\nthat burden can't be achieved -- Justice Ginsburg's\nquestions at the end of this colloquy illustrate that\nthere are a number -- and -- and the questions about\ndepreciation and cost of capital illustrate all of the\nthings that -- the reasons why this Court has avoided\ndeciding whether a methodology is acceptable or not.\nQUESTION: You -- you can't meet that burden\nwith a wheel. You can't meet that burden with a wheel.\nYou're really saying that you can come up with a wheel and\njust say, well, you know, you can't prove that you're not\ngoing to get a fair return. That can't be right.\nMR. OLSON: Well, the -- the person who\nchallenges the way the commission is setting rates has to\n-- has to present to this Court an explanation for why\nthat the system that's developed, whether it's spinning a\nwheel or whatever -- and I -- I won't engage in that\nhypothetical because we've got a several hundred page\nrecord that looked into various different arguments with\nrespect to various different methods of recovery. It\nlistened to various -- the FCC listened to various\ndifferent experts. It listened to the incumbent local\nexchange carriers' various different theories. It has\nexplained why it did. It developed a forward-looking\ntechnology, a method of evaluating the entry fees that\nwould be based upon the statute.\nQUESTION: But it -- it seems to me that\nnecessarily a hypothetically most efficient market will\ninvariably, necessarily result in a rate that is less than\ntheir actual cost.\nMR. OLSON: Well, no, I don't agree.\nQUESTION: I mean, it just -- that just has to\nbe.\nMR. OLSON: No, it does have to be. And this\nCourt should wait to see whether that really happens or\nnot.\nIn the first place, this Court has said over and\nover again that the ratemaker has the responsibility and\nobligation and right under the Constitution to consider\nthe goals of the statute, different theories, mixed --\nmixed methodologies, and all of those things so that the\nCourt -- we can't determine -- there's a lot of\nallegations in the briefs and in this entire case about\nthe draconian impact of this methodology.\nBut as the colloquy that took place here with\nrespect to both depreciation and return of capital\nillustrated, in the precise paragraphs that my opponent\ncited with respect to these things illustrate the point.\nOnce the forward method -- forward-looking technology\nmethod is applied, the State -- the States are determining\nthe rates which these carriers will receive for the\nelements. And they may be only elements of the system.\nThey get to continue to operate the system, to make\nprofit, to reimburse themselves for whatever costs they've\nembedded. They've said that they're not challenging the\nrates. They're not challenging the outcome because once\nthe forward-looking technology that the FCC specified in\ndetail after long, detailed, methodical consideration --\nsaid that then the States will look at questions of\ndepreciation and cost of capital.\nThe paragraph that you read back, Mr. Chief\nJustice, the sentence in paragraph 702, which is on page\n396 of the joint appendix, specifically says, States may\nadjust the cost of capital if a party demonstrates to a\nState commission that either a higher or lower level of\ncost of capital is warranted, et cetera, et cetera.\nQUESTION: Warranted by what standard?\nMR. OLSON: By the circumstances and -- and the\nconstitutional obligation to set a reasonable rate under\nthe statute considering this methodology and limited by\nthe constitutional standard that this Court has\narticulated as the lowest reasonable rate, a rate that is\nnot confiscatory.\nQUESTION: Are actual -- are actual costs\nrelevant in determining --\nMR. OLSON: Well, this Court --\nQUESTION: -- what's ultimately reasonable?\nMR. OLSON: Well, this Court has repeatedly said\nthat it has refused to constitutionalize the embedded cost\nor historical cost formulation. Most recently it said\nthat in the Duquesne case.\nQUESTION: But warranted must have some specific\nstandard. There must be some principle by which we can\nsee if it's warranted. And -- and their contention is\nthat when you automatically guarantee them a lower than --\nthan cost -- than cost recovery, it must necessarily be\nunwarranted.\nMR. OLSON: That argument is made, but it's not\nsubstantiated by anything in the record in -- in this\nlong, elaborate TELRIC articulation of -- of numerous\nstandards, both with respect to cost of capital and\ndepreciation because the very next paragraph --\nQUESTION: Never mind the next paragraph. What\nabout the end of that sentence that -- that you didn't\nread?\nMR. OLSON: Well, but that says --\nQUESTION: -- a higher or lower level of cost of\ncapital is warranted without that commission conducting a\nrate-of-return or other rate-based proceeding. And the\nargument is made -- and it seems to me a reasonable one --\nthat that, in effect, says, without looking at embedded\ncosts because that's what a rate-based proceeding has --\nhas traditionally been. In other words, that -- that\nsentence suggests that you cannot set the -- the higher\nlevel -- higher or lower level cost of capital on the\nbasis of how much embedded cost the utility has.\nMR. OLSON: Well, it must say that because\nthat's precisely what it said in the statute. Section 47\nU.S.C. 252(d)(1), which is replicated on the joint\nappendix at pages 21 to 23. Congress specifically said\nnow that based upon the cost -- and by the way, it is cost\nof providing, not cost. It says cost of providing --\nparentheses, determined without reference to a rate-of-\nreturn or other rate-based proceeding. So, the fact that\nthe FCC put that in its calculation of cost of capital was\nrequired by the statute.\nQUESTION: I don't care if it's required by the\nstatute or not. I care whether it -- it gives these\npeople any shot at getting back the -- the capital that\nthey've invested, with a promise by the Government, that\nthey'd be able to get a fair return on it. I don't care\nif it's required by the statute or required by the FCC.\nMR. OLSON: Well, you may not, Justice Scalia,\nbut the -- but the cases presented on alternative bases --\nthe heavy burden that the local exchange carriers must\ncarry here is proving that the embedded cost, historic\ncost requirement is either in the statute or in the\nConstitution. We demonstrate in our briefs -- and it's\nrelatively clear that it's not required by the statute,\nand we submit it's not required by the Constitution either\nbecause --\nQUESTION: You're saying it doesn't matter if\nthey -- if they end up not getting a fair return on\nbillions of dollars that have been invested with the\nGovernment's assurance that they -- that they get a fair\nreturn. Is that what you're saying? It doesn't matter.\nMR. OLSON: I'm not saying that. I'm saying\nthat ultimately this Court may have to decide whether it\ngets a fair rate of return for what it is losing, the\ndetriment it gives up when it allows competition to\nutilize some small portion of their networks under various\ndifferent, carefully calibrated circumstances. They\ncannot make that case yet.\nAnd by the way, this TELRIC system has been in\neffect for several years already. It has been applied\nwith depreciation rates. And I was going to point out\nthat there is latitude in the State commissions to set a\ndepreciation rate -- this is in paragraph 703 -- that\nreflects the true changes in economic value of an asset\nand a cost of capital that appropriately reflects the\nrisks incurred by an investor, and so forth. Once you've\nseen the application of that, then you can determine\nwhether or not there's been anything lost.\nThis is -- and Justice Ginsburg's point I have\nto return to. This is for use in certain markets by\ncertain competitors of certain elements of the incumbent\nexchange system. If they're interested in recovering\nwhatever the number is of $120 billion or $150 billion\nworth of embedded costs, are they expected -- do they have\na reasonable right to expect that they will recover that\nout of the -- the fees paid for the elements that are used\nin a system that is intended to fulfill the congressional\ngoals -- and if these are unconstitutional, that's a\nseparate question, but the congressional goals that the\ncommission was required to dedicate itself to is to\npromote competition, reduce regulation, lower prices, and\nencourage the rapid deployment of new telecommunications\ntechnologies.\nThis Court has said over and over again that\nwhen the ratemaker --\nQUESTION: And not compensate investors. Since\nit spelled out those four and said nothing about\ncompensating investors, that doesn't have to be taken into\naccount.\nMR. OLSON: It -- it -- that's correct. The\nstatute says nothing about compensating investors. It\nsays a just and reasonable and nondiscriminatory rate\nbased upon the -- the various factors of the cost of\nproviding the service.\nNow, the Eighth Circuit looked at that and said\nsomething to the effect that, well, the -- the cost of\ncarrying the extra load with respect to these elements --\nthat would be an -- something called an incremental cost\nor a marginal cost. It might be considerably lower. It\nmight reimburse them in some way for some portion of their\ncapital costs.\nAnd by the way, Congress does know how to deal\nwith this issue when it -- when it's necessary. In the\nPole Attachments Act, which is 47 U.S.C. 224 I think, that\nthe Court considered last week, the -- the statute\nspecifically refers to an allocation for a cost of capital\nof the telephone pole or the conduit or the right-of-way.\nIt didn't say that in this statute. It said, costs of\nproviding the service.\nAnd then it had that exclusion that you\nmentioned, Justice Scalia, about rate of return,\nsuggesting that the traditional embedded cost rates, to\nthe extent that they are often used in ratemaking, wasn't\nnecessarily what the Congress had in mind.\nWhat this Court said in its decision, when it\nvisited this case 4 years ago, is that this statute is in\nsome respects a model of ambiguity, and the Court went --\nwent on pointedly to say, at the end of that decision,\nCongress well knows what it's doing when it writes\nambiguous provisions. And the word cost, and the word\nvalue, and the word rate of return, and things like that\nin ratemaking cases are ambiguous, and they mean lots of\ndifferent things under lots of different circumstances.\nThose ambiguities will be clarified and implemented and\nfilled out by the regulators to whom authority has been\ngiven.\nWhat happened in this case, I submit, is what\nCongress properly did. What this Court said in -- I think\nit was in the Duquesne case -- that these are hopelessly\ncomplex calculations that have to go into making rates and\ndeciding what is a fair, just, reasonable,\nnondiscriminatory rate of return in the ratemaking\ncontext. Especially something as complicated as this,\nespecially where you're trying to bring in new competition\nin a regulated market, especially when you're giving in\nexchange in part in the statute for allowing competitors\nto come into the local telephone markets, giving the local\ntelephone companies, which up to that point had been\nprecluded from being in the long distance market and they\nwere being precluded from competing from other local\ncarriers, they were given access to those two markets in\nexchange, when all of those complexities are taken into\nconsideration, Congress was not going to be -- able to\nresolve all those things.\nSo, what it did is it turned it over to an\nexpert agency which exists for the very purpose of solving\nthese problems, just like State commissions have the\nauthority. In this case a methodology was developed by\nthe FCC doing exactly what it should have done, listened\nto the experts, listening to the competing concerns, and\nthe developed a methodology which is forward-looking,\nwhich this Court -- Court has never rejected.\nIn fact, in the Duquesne case, in footnote 10 at\nthe very end of the Duquesne case, the Court suggested\nthat that may be an entirely appropriate methodology. In\nfootnote --\nQUESTION: Sure, depending on how it's applied.\nGeneral Olson --\nMR. OLSON: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- assume -- assume -- and I'm sure\nyou -- you don't agree with it, but assume that I -- that\nI think this system has to not just be the spinning of a\nwheel, but it has to contain in it some -- some assurance\nthat they'll get a fair rate of return on money that they\nhave invested, with the Government's assurance that they\nget a fair rate of return. Assuming that that's the case,\nwhat is there in this -- in this methodology that enables\nthem to get a fair rate of return on their sunk capital?\nMR. OLSON: The problem, Justice --\nQUESTION: Just point to me the provision that\nshows --\nMR. OLSON: The problem is --\nQUESTION: -- where that will be taken into\naccount --\nMR. OLSON: -- a fair --\nQUESTION: -- at all. Is it ever anywhere taken\ninto account?\nMR. OLSON: It is not taken into account what\ntheir embedded costs are with respect to portions of their\nnetwork that may or may not have anything to do with the\nprovision of the service or the network element involved\nhere. We're talking about loops. We're talking about\ntelephone numbers. We're talking about information used\nfor billing. Whether or not those facilities or those\nnetwork elements have anything to do with an embedded cost\nfor a plant that was built 30 years ago for X billion\ndollars is something that's not discernible at the time\nthe statute is written.\nQUESTION: Well, you're saying some of the costs\nshouldn't be counted. Let's just take the costs that you\nagree should be counted. Let's just take the embedded\ncosts that do relate -- that do relate to these services.\nMR. OLSON: Well, I can't determine what those\nare. I don't know how the telephone companies have been\nallocating those costs on their books. I suspect that\nthey do not allocate those costs on an element-by-element\nbasis on their books with respect to this thing. At the\nend of the day --\nQUESTION: That's always been the case.\nMR. OLSON: That has always been the case, and\nthat --\nQUESTION: It's always been the case with\nratemaking methodology. So, you -- you can come up now\nand say, it's always been so difficult. We've done it\npretty badly. So, we're going to solve the problem by\njust forgetting about giving --\nMR. OLSON: No, Justice Scalia. You said in\nyour concurring opinion in the Duquesne case, we look at\n-- we look at consequences, not techniques. The balance\nof the Court said in that case, we look at the impact, not\nat the methodology.\nWe don't know what the consequences are yet. We\ndon't know what the -- what the impact on the local\nexchange --\nQUESTION: Now you're back to spinning a wheel.\nYou -- you've departed from my -- from my hypothesis,\nassuming that I don't believe that spinning a wheel is\nokay. What you're telling me is spinning a wheel is okay.\nMR. OLSON: No, I'm not saying that spinning a\nwheel is okay. What I'm saying is that neither the\nConstitution nor the statute put prudent investment --\nprudent investment rule in this ratemaking statute or the\nstatute that authorized ratemaking and --\nQUESTION: We refused to adopt that in Duquesne.\nMR. OLSON: Precisely. In fact, that's why I\nwas going to say -- and put in a footnote, which I think\nis extremely footnote -- footnote 10 said,\nconstitutionalizing the prudent investment rule would\nforeclose a return to some form of the fair value rule,\njust as its practical problems may be diminishing. Now,\nTELRIC is a version of the fair market rule.\nThe emergent -- as the Court went on to say in\nthe Duquesne case, the emergent market for wholesale\nelectric energy could provide a readily available,\nobjective basis for determining the value of utility\nassets. In other words, the Court was foreseeing in a way\nthe same argument that we were having today. That's why\nthe Court rejected constitutionalizing the prudent\ninvestment rule, and that's why the Court signaled that\nthere were other methods that would be available,\nincluding fair market methods that -- that might, in fact,\nbe very practical and functional.\nThis is a situation where I -- I -- and I want\nto emphasize that we're dealing with a statute that didn't\nrequire the prudent investment rule. We're dealing with\ndecisions that go -- by this Court that go back 100 years\nthat have said, don't constitutionalize any particular\nmethodology.\nBut that is precisely what the -- the local\nexchange carriers are arguing for. There are a number of\npremises in their argument to you --\nQUESTION: To say that you don't\nconstitutionalize the prudent investment rule is not to\nsay that any methodology will go, even one that does not\nenable somebody who has made investments under a\ncommitment from the Government to allow a fair return, to\nrecover that fair return. I mean, the -- the two are not\n-- are not mutually exclusive.\nMR. OLSON: Well, that -- that's one of the\nthings that I was -- that Mr. Barr said that I think the\nCourt would take issue with. And I think one of the\nJustices in a question did. I think it may have been you,\nJustice Scalia. They weren't required to spend the money.\nThey were given an opportunity to invest in an industry,\nin exchange for which they received a monopoly for a long\nperiod of time.\nNow, the Congress of the United States has\ndecided that we have to have competition, it would be wise\nto have competition in the local telephone market. They\nwere never promised in any constitutional sense or any\ncontractual sense -- and they don't even allege that, and\nMr. Barr said he didn't allege that there was a contract\n-- that they would recover every nickel of their\ninvestments.\nIn the Duquesne case, for example, the argument\nwas made these were reasonable and these were prudent\ninvestments in nuclear facilities, and yet the State of\nPennsylvania developed a system that did not allow them to\nrecover those prudent investments unless they were\nactually being used in the delivery of energy products.\nAnd the argument was made we have a promise or you have a\nconstitutional obligation or you have some sort of\nrequirement to allow us to recover those costs. The State\nof -- the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania said no.\nQUESTION: Well, what is the baseline standard\nthat the utilities are entitled to rely upon?\nMR. OLSON: They're --\nQUESTION: It's not like telling GM to give away\nChevrolets. We know -- we know that. A utility is\ndifferent. Why is it different and what is the baseline\nconstitutional standard that they are -- or fair\ncompensation standard that they are entitled to rely upon?\nMR. OLSON: The baseline constitutional\nstandard, at the end of the day, once you can look at the\nresults, is this a non-confiscatory result. Is the lowest\n-- this Court has said -- it's the Hope Natural Gas case,\na number of cases before that, a number of cases after\nthat. It's in the Smyth case. In -- in that the ultimate\noutcome is a -- the lowest reasonable rate which is the\nlowest non-confiscatory rate. That is what they are\nentitled to in the Constitution under the decisions of\nthis Court.\nNow, what the Court also --\nQUESTION: Why isn't it confiscatory to say that\nwe're going to make you use your capital plant, which\ncosts $140 billion, and we're going to allow you to\ndepreciate it as though it were only $70 billion? Why\nisn't that confiscatory?\nMR. OLSON: Or the Court -- the Congress might\nhave said, with respect to a transportation company, you\nhad it -- you've had the taxi service all to yourself for\nall these many years and now we're going to allow other --\nsome competition in there, and -- and you've got some\nmonopolistic facility, and we're going to let your\ncompetitors use some piece of it. Now, you're not going\nto be -- and -- and we can determine what the value of\nthat is in a competitive market, and we're going to allow\nyou to recover some portion of the value.\nThis Court has repeatedly said under the Fifth\nAmendment, to the extent that that is applicable -- and I\nbelieve it is fundamentally -- to the ratemaking cases and\nthe utility cases -- that it's a fair market value at the\ntime of the taking. Mr. Barr says the taking occurs is --\nwhen we were required to expend the money. Now, that is\nnot when the taking occurs. The taking occurs, if at all,\nwhen they have to surrender some portion of their system\nto allow someone else to use it.\nQUESTION: I want to be -- I want to be sure I\nhave a chance to ask you a different question. I want to\nknow what, in your opinion, the FCC was driving at when it\nchose this particular methodology. What in your opinion\n-- after all, they had four of five possibilities. What\nbasic economic question were they trying to answer when\nthey chose this one as opposed to a different one?\nMR. OLSON: What they wanted to do with the --\nthey wanted to accomplish a number of goals, which are set\nforth in the preface of the statute, which I alluded to\nbefore, which is to reduce prices, to inspire\ncompetition --\nQUESTION: I don't want -- I -- I would like a\nlittle bit less generality than that, if -- if you can\ngive it to me. What was their object? What did they hope\nthat the rates set this way, rather than set, for example,\nanother way, would achieve?\nMR. OLSON: Well, they -- they explained that\none of the important considerations -- and it's hard to\nnot deal in some generality --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. OLSON: -- this area does. But one of the\nimportant objectives that they hoped to achieve was to\ndevelop a pricing methodology that would encourage new\nentrants to come into the market and pay fees that would\nallow them to enter the market at competitive rates and\nencourage them to develop new technologies --\nQUESTION: All right. If that's basically the\nobjective, to get them to enter when they should enter --\nis that fair? To get them enter when economically they\nshould enter, not when economically it'd be wasteful for\nthem to enter.\nMR. OLSON: Yes, I think that's a fair premise.\nQUESTION: All right. If that's a fair premise,\nwhy wouldn't they choose a system that would give them the\nfollowing answer? Price. Look at the service that the\nnewcomer wants to buy from the incumbent. Try to charge a\nprice so that it reflects the real resources that that\nincumbent will have to spend -- him, not some hypothetical\nperson -- to provide that service. Perfect answer because\nif you can get it, then obviously if that number is higher\nthan it will cost the incumbent in real resources to\nprovide it, he'll build it himself. And if it's lower,\nhe'll buy it. The perfect economic answer. Why would\nthey not try, at least, to answer that question?\nMR. OLSON: Well, it seems to me that they did\ntry to answer that question, Justice Breyer.\nQUESTION: Fine. Okay. Then you're right where\nI think you --\nMR. OLSON: All right. But as you pointed out\nin your -- in your dissent, your partial dissent in the\nother -- the other time this case was before this Court,\nthere are a variety of different methodologies that\nvarious different economists look at and think that they\ncan accomplish those kind of objectives. But this Court\nhas said that we leave that to the regulators to do, and\nif at the end of the day, there's some level of\nconfiscation, then we can adjudicate that.\nQUESTION: I'm not worried about confiscation.\nMR. OLSON: All right. Now --\nQUESTION: I'm worried about the following. If\nthat's what they're trying to do, then how could it\npossibly do that, to write an order that says the\ndepreciation rate and the rate of return that you are\ngoing to charge is going to be based upon not what it will\ncost you, but rather, what it will cost some hypothetical\nfirm that isn't there, let alone saying the same thing in\nrespect to telephone poles, in respect to wires, in\nrespect to efficiency of administration, in respect to a\n22 percent discount for a competition that doesn't exist?\nIn other words, how did it even come close to answering\nthat question to look not at the cost of this firm, but at\nthe cost of some hypothetical firm that by definition\ndoesn't exist?\nMR. OLSON: Well, in the first place, we're not\ntalking about replicating an entire firm. We're talking\nabout replicating particular elements that are available\nto the -- to the firms that wish to interconnect. And the\nFCC made it clear that we're not talking about -- we're\nnot talking about hypotheticals any more than the embedded\ncost system would require allocating hypothetical portions\nof something that happened 30 years ago to a rate for --\nfor a particular small portion of a product that may have\nnothing to do with that.\nWhat the FCC's order does -- and it explains\nthis in relatively elaborate detail that it's talking\nabout a reasonably available, efficient product in the\nmarketplace that's comparable that can perform a service\nthat's equivalent to the -- the element that may have been\nbuilt 5 years ago and may be obsolete today or partially\nobsolete today and may not be efficient. Because if we\ndon't do it that way, we will encourage non-competition or\n-- or prices that are inefficient based upon old services.\nAnd this was actually addressed by Justice\nBrandeis in the -- in the famous concurring opinion. And\nhe says at the very end of his -- his opinion, he says\nthat -- that surely the cost of an equally efficient\nsubstitute must be the maximum of the rate base if prudent\ninvestment is to be rejected as a measure.\nNow, what the FCC did in this case, it made a\ncompromise. It took the wire centers as they existed, and\nthey used the other elements based upon these reasonably\nefficient, effective, available alternatives.\nNow, the FCC has been criticized. Well, you're\n-- you're theoretically inconsistent. You should have\ndone it all this way or all that way. The fact is that\nthis Court has said again and again that the ratemaker may\nmake compromises, may have to balance one benefit to the\nincumbent with one benefit for the competitors.\nIt may -- it doesn't have to be -- the Duquesne\ncase and I think the Hope case involved challenges of\nmethodological inconsistency, and the Court brushed right\npast that properly because the ratemakers, to solve this\nhopelessly complex problem, might have to pick something\nfrom column A and column B.\nNow, at the end of the line, I want to make one\nimportant point, that even after the State commissions get\nfinished with the process, the FCC included in its order a\nprovision -- it's paragraph 739 -- that specifically said\n-- and this is page joint appendix 422. This is after the\napplication of TELRIC and after reasonable depreciation\nrates are set. And they haven't been -- so they have been\nset in some places, and they haven't been set in others.\nAnd there have been takings -- cases brought by the -- the\nincumbent carriers. No court, as far as I know, has\nupheld a taking yet. And costs of capital. There's lots\nof flexibility.\nAt the end of the day, paragraph 739 says,\nincumbent local exchange carriers may seek relief from the\ncommission's pricing methodology if they provide specific\ninformation to show that the pricing methodology, as\napplied to them, will result in confiscatory rates.\nSo, TELRIC and the FCC's regulation provided\nlots of opportunities to get to the end of the day the\nright result in a manner that achieved these various\nconflicting goals of Congress. It did it in a way which\nmight not be the best way, although it looks to me like a\nvery conscientious effort to import competition, bring\ndown prices, and to promote technology.\nBut at the end of the day, after the commissions\ndo their job, the expertise that you were talking about in\nyour dissenting opinion -- at the end of the day the\nincumbent commission -- exchange carriers can come to\ncourt and say it was confiscatory, and they have a remedy.\nOr before that, they may go to the FCC and they have an\nopportunity to present their case to the FCC.\nThis, it strikes me, is the way it should be\ndone. It may not be perfect. But in this ratemaking\narea, this is the way it should be done. The expertise\nwas given to the agency that has the expertise, and they\nwere given an opportunity to fulfill the goals of Congress\nunder the constitutional standards set by this Court.\nThank you.\nQUESTION: Thank you, General Olson.\nMr. Verrilli, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nIN NOS. 00-555, 00-587, AND 00-590\nMR. VERRILLI: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI'd like to begin by trying to answer Justice\nBreyer's question as to why TELRIC was a sensible policy\nchoice by the FCC, and in so doing, I hope also to be able\nto address Justice Kennedy's concern about whether TELRIC\nunderestimates the cost that a company will face going\nforward. And then if I -- if I can, I'd like to turn to\nJustice Scalia's question about whether TELRIC offers a\nfair opportunity to recover embedded costs.\nParagraph 679 of the local competition order is\nwhere the FCC spells out in detail what its rationales\nwere. And what the FCC said in paragraph 679 is that it\nwanted to adopt TELRIC to send -- to send the right\nsignals to new entrants about when to buy and when to\nbuild and to prevent anti-competitive behavior by the\nincumbent with respect to the pricing of network elements.\nAnd that's critical from our perspective.\nAs a retail matter, the incumbents have every\nright, under the State law and Federal antitrust laws, to\nprice their retail offerings in these new competitive\nmarkets at their long-run incremental costs. That's what\nthe State laws say. That's what the antitrust laws say.\nAnd therefore, if they could charge us the historical\ncosts for these key inputs -- the historical costs for key\ninputs, when they can charge retail based on their long-\nrun incremental costs, we could never compete using --\nQUESTION: My question is, by the way, blank\nslate. I wasn't doubting that they could charge forward-\nlooking costs. I was doubting -- I find it difficult to\nreconcile what the State -- and I think this for me is the\nissue. I mean, in 679, they have a correct statement of\nthe goal, and -- and then all these criticisms, which\nyou're well aware of, suggest that by choosing blank\nslate, rather than this company's, this incumbent\ncompany's long-run incremental costs, they've departed so\nfar that -- give them all the expertise you want -- it's\nstill awfully hard to uphold them. I mean, that's\nbasically the argument. And if you're going to --\nMR. VERRILLI: Yes, thank you. And -- and\nthat's just not right. And their own experts, Professor\nKahn, in particular -- and this is at page 155 of the\njoint appendix -- concedes that that's not right, that if\nyou set the depreciation and cost of capital appropriately\nto reflect the risks of -- existing in the TELRIC world,\nthen TELRIC will provide the full compensation. Now,\nProfessor Kahn concedes that. I believe Mr. Barr\nacknowledged that at the beginning of his argument. It\nall comes down to what those depreciation rates and costs\nof capital are.\nAnd what the FCC said very clearly is that the\nStates set depreciation rates. That's in paragraph 29.\nThe regulation itself says that they must be economic\ndepreciation. That means they must account for the full\nloss in value as a result of technological change.\nAnd in paragraph 702 of the order, the FCC said\nwe expect States to set depreciation rates that take this\ninto account, that take this risk into account.\nQUESTION: But my question -- I don't want to\ndistract you because others had a different question --\nhad nothing to do with confiscation. My question was\nbased -- I'm leaving that totally to the side. Phrase,\nwildly incorrect set of economic signals to achieve the\n739 goals, for the reasons that you've heard and are\nlisted in the briefs.\nMR. VERRILLI: But if depreciation and cost of\ncapital are set right, it won't do that, Justice Breyer,\nand I believe that is what Professor Kahn conceded, their\nexpert.\nAnd that is why, Justice Kennedy, the rate going\nforward, the TELRIC rate going forward, will not\nnecessarily be lower than the cost that the incumbents\nincurred going forward, because a rate, after all, is a\nproduct of three things: the cost structure, the\ndepreciation rate -- in other words, how few years you\nrecover it -- and the cost of capital -- in other words,\nwhat the risk adjustment is. So, it could well be that\nthe rates would be the same or higher depending on how\ndepreciation and cost of capital are set.\nQUESTION: You're -- you're not asserting that\nthe States can -- can kick up the cost of capital rate on\nthe basis of -- of the fact that the utility is not -- is\nnot getting depreciation on its sunk costs.\nMR. VERRILLI: It -- the -- the -- separate two\nquestions out. I think there's two -- two points to be\nmade in there, Justice Scalia.\nWith respect to what -- what the cost of capital\nought to be set at, under the regs and under the FCC's\norder, is to reflect the risks of operating in the system.\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. VERRILLI: So, I think it does do what Mr.\nBarr claims it doesn't do. I think it very clearly does\ndo that.\nNow, with respect to their sunk or embedded\ncosts, I think it's a different question because the issue\nhere is whether the TELRIC in operation will produce rates\nand returns, then in operation don't cover the -- the\nundepreciated costs still on their books. And the FCC\nmade a specific finding -- that ultimately, Justice\nScalia, is a much more empirical than a methodological\nquestion. It is possible, as a matter of logic and\nmethodology, for TELRIC to do so, depending on how the\ninputs are set. And therefore, it is an empirical\nquestion whether it will, in fact, do so.\nThe FCC in the notice of proposed rulemaking in\nthis case specifically asked the incumbents for evidence\nas to what that gap would be. The incumbents produced\nnothing. Nothing. The FCC made a finding in paragraph\n707 of the order that there was no evidence in the record\nto support the proposition that the adoption of TELRIC\nwould result in significant stranded costs.\nBut the FCC did more than that. It extended an\ninvitation to the incumbents to come back with proof that\nthere would, indeed, be significant stranded costs. That\ninvitation has been outstanding for 5 years now. The\nincumbents have come back with nothing.\nBut that's not all. The way this statute\noperates is the FCC produced a methodology, which is then\napplied in the States, in the States according to these\nrules, setting depreciation rates, setting costs of\ncapital. Every State in the Union has had a proceeding of\nthat kind. This statute in section 252(b)(6) makes those\nproceedings reviewable in Federal district court.\nTherefore, in every State in the Union, the incumbents\nhave had the opportunity to demonstrate that in\napplication TELRIC will produce rates that don't recover\nsignificant amounts of stranded cost.\nThey have not succeeded anywhere in the country.\nIndeed, in the vast majority of States, they haven't even\ntried. And the reason is because there isn't a big gap.\nQUESTION: If -- if that -- assuming that, his\n-- Mr. Barr's argument, I take it, was that paragraph 702\nput -- read in any disclaimers you want, and they have\nloads of them. But it says the starting point is existing\ndepreciation rates and capital rates, and that couldn't be\nright. And in addition, it strongly suggests if it\ndoesn't state -- and it does state -- that you change\nthose in respect to new competition coming in while the\ncorrect statement would be change it from the beginning\nbecause whether new competition comes in or not is beside\nthe point. You're setting in TELRIC the imaginary rate\nthat would be set by new competition, and therefore,\nobviously you can't have existing depreciation rates. I\nmean, I take it I may not have paraphrased it correctly,\nbut I think that's basically his point.\nMR. VERRILLI: No, I think it's right. That is\nhis argument. But it's not what paragraph 702 says and\nit's not what happened in operation. The States have set\ndepreciation rates that are downward departures.\nCalifornia, for example, cut the switching depreciation\nrates in half. So, it's just not the case that that's\nwhat's happened out there in the real world.\nAnd there are dozens of -- there have been\ndozens of opportunities for this case to be proven on the\nbasis of a real rate in Federal district court. And there\n-- as I said, in the few cases where it has even been\nattempted, it has been rejected, and most of the time it\nhasn't even been tried.\nAnd if -- let me try to get back, if I could, to\nthat 340/180 comparison that's in the briefs and we've had\nsome discussion about. Here's why TELRIC doesn't produce\nthe kinds of results that -- that example suggests. It's\nbecause the 340 is way, way too high. The 340 is\neverything in the entire network and the entire corporate\nsuperstructure that goes with it. And that is not all\ndevoted to the production of local telephone service.\nIt's -- there are -- tens of billions of dollars of that\nare devoted to creating capacity for long distance\nservice. Billions and billions of dollars additionally\nare devoted to capacity for video service, for CENTREX\nservice, for other services that wouldn't be reflected in\nTELRIC rates.\nThere are just -- you'd have this huge\nallocation problem if you take this. And this I think\nshows why TELRIC is the practical answer here as well as\nthe fair one. You would have a massive allocation problem\nif you took that 340 because, first of all, you'd have to\nfigure out how many tens and tens of billions of dollars\ngot taken out for all these services that have nothing to\ndo with providing local telephone service.\nThen of the $45 billion in that 342 that's\ndevoted to corporate overhead, you would need to figure\nout how much of that is appropriately devoted to -- to the\nlocal telephone service.\nQUESTION: And that used to be done all the\ntime, of course, to decide between local and -- and long\ndistance phone rates. Right?\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, no, but there's a --\nQUESTION: I mean, it's not as though --\nMR. VERRILLI: I'm sorry, Justice Scalia.\nQUESTION: It is not as though we didn't --\nhaven't been pretending to do that for years and years.\nMR. VERRILLI: But -- but, Justice Scalia, a\nsignificant amount of that goes to retail which can't be\nallocated here. And then when you get done with all that,\nthen you've got to take out the billions of dollars in\nphantom assets that the FCC's most recent audit of their\nbooks identified. And then when you get done with that,\nthen you've got to decide how much of that was actually\nprudently incurred. And when you get done with that very\nlong process, that number is going to come way, way down.\nNow, on the other side, the 180 is too low. And\nthe FCC specifically said it was too low and warned\nagainst using it for exactly the comparison that Mr. Barr\nused it for because it's designed to calculate universal\nservice subsidies at the very most basic low level. So,\nthat comparison just doesn't hold up. And so, the\nundepreciated part of the comparison, Justice Breyer,\ndoesn't hold up either because the number is not going to\nbe -- the undepreciated number of everything is $140\nbillion-$150 billion. But the undepreciated part of what\nthey entitled to recovery under TELRIC is going to be a\nmuch smaller number than that number because you'd have to\ntake out everything I just described. So, it just doesn't\nwash.\nThere may be some difference with respect to\nsome of the elements. Switching costs have come down. Of\ncourse, loop costs have not come down, and the loop costs\nare 48 percent, according to the FCC in this order, of the\noverall cost of providing service. And those have been\nstable over time.\nSo, the fact is you just don't have a huge\nproblem. You don't have a big gap. And that's why,\nJustice Scalia, when you adopt one methodology, when you\nadopt this methodology here, given the fact that it is an\nempirical matter, there's no reason to think there's a\nhuge gap. There's no reason to think that the outcome\nwill necessarily preclude them the opportunity of earning\na fair return.\nAnd that's why I think this case is an easier\none than Duquesne because at least in Duquesne, you knew\nhow much wasn't going to be recovered as a result of the\nswitch in methodology. Here, you don't know how much\nisn't going to be recovered, but what you do know, based\non the facts that I've just conveyed to the Court, is that\nit's not going to be a very big number, even if you assume\nthat all elements are leased.\nAnd of course, as Justice Ginsburg's question\npointed out, only 3 percent -- it's not 6 percent. The\nFCC's most recent figures are 3 percent -- 3 percent -- of\nthe local network is being leased.\nWhich leads me to a practical point here, that\nif the world were the way the incumbents were describing\nit, it would be a very different place in fact than it is.\nWe would be making all the money. They would be in\ntrouble. The reality is --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. VERRILLI: -- they are making all the money\nand we are in trouble.\nAnd the reason for that -- and -- and, indeed,\nthey would be derelict in their responsibilities to their\nshareholders if they weren't taking advantage of this\ngigantic regulatory arbitrage opportunity to go into each\nother's local markets and take away all the customers.\nBut they're not doing that. The reason they're not doing\nthat is because the opportunity doesn't exist. This --\nthe thing that's a fantasy, the thing that's hypothetical\nin this case is the claims they are making about what this\nsystem is and the way it works.\nThank you.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Verrilli.\nMr. Barr, you have a minute remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM P. BARR\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS IN NO. 00-511\nMR. BARR: The Constitution doesn't dictate a\nmethodology, but what it does say is that whatever\nmethodology is selected, it ultimately has to be judged by\nthis Court as to whether it provides us a fair opportunity\nto recover our costs. And therefore, if it creates a\nmethodological risk, it has to compensate us for a\nmethodological risk.\nWe did show rates. And the Government's\nposition here is because this is a bifurcated proceeding,\nwe have challenged rates. The Government has taken the\nposition -- the Fourth Circuit has held -- we cannot\nchallenge a methodology. We can only challenge whether\nthe rate conforms to the Federal methodology.\nThis is the only place we can get review of the\nunderlying problem, which is the methodology. This is an\nAshwander case, and the Government itself in paragraph 705\nsays that our interpretation of based on the cost of\nproviding is permissible. What we're saying is the\nstatute dictates the methodology here and avoids the\nconstitutional problem.\nBut even if you didn't find that, this rate --\nthis methodology does create a methodological risk, and we\nhave shown that we're not compensated for it. We have\nshown rates in our -- in our -- in the record that halve\nour recovery, halve our revenue. That is the typical\ninstance.\nThey've had 5 years to show one State -- and,\nyou know, it doesn't matter if there's one State. The\nquestion is what's the risk of any State that comes close\nto allowing us to recover our prudent investment. And you\ncan look through the record and you can't find one. We\nhave shown in Virginia and New York -- New York is a\nclassic. Our loop rate -- our cost is $33.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Barr.\n"
