GILLELAN, II,\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. GILLELAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nDana Roberts was injured and shortly\nthereafter became disabled in the course of his work for\nSea-Land in fiscal year 2002, but he was not awarded\ncompensation until fiscal year 2007.\nThe question presented here is whether the\nmaximum weekly rate established by section 6 of the\nLongshore Act that was in effect at the time his\ndisability began or that which was in effect at the time\nhe was awarded compensation governs his case. He is\nentitled to whichever maximum is the applicable one.\nSection 6(c) of the Act provides explicitly\nthat the applicable maximum is that in effect at the\ntime that the claimant is \"newly awarded compensation.\"\nThe term \"award\" or \"awarded\" in the Longshore Act has a\nconsistent meaning throughout, contrary to the views of\nthe court of appeals below; and that meaning is a\ncompensation order filed pursuant to section 19(e) of\nthe Act, which is described in section 19(e) as \"the\norder making the award.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What happens in the\ncase --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that the two parties are\nat extremes and that there is indeed something in the\nmiddle. I mean, you say it has to be the determination\nof entitlement to compensation by the agency. The other\nside says no, it's just entitlement, whether it's been\ndecreed or not. Why -- why wouldn't it be an award,\nhowever, if it was the employer that voluntarily paid\nthe amount due, which is what he's supposed to do\nanyway, right? Why wouldn't that be an award of\ncompensation?\nMR. GILLELAN: Well, because the statute --\nin some sense of the word \"award\" it is.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, a sense that -- that\nthe text would bear, as opposed to the -- to the sense\nthat the other side argues here.\nMR. GILLELAN: I think that the text will\nnot bear that reading, in particular because the\npayments that you are describing that could be\nconsidered an award are described throughout the Act as\npayments \"without an award.\" Now, how the claimant can\nhave been newly awarded benefits at the time the\nemployer makes a payment \"without an award\" I think\ndefies the meaning of that word.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where -- well, I wish you\nwould submit the sections of the Act that use it that\nway, that say \"compensation without an award.\"\nMR. GILLELAN: Section 14(a) through (e)\nrefers to compensation payments without an award.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nMR. GILLELAN: Those are the provisions.\nSection 14(a) and (b) directs those payments without an\naward.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And the -- and the\ncritical time, then -- I think, isn't it true that most\ncompensation payments are the -- are as a result of\nvoluntary action by the employer and not a proceeding?\nMR. GILLELAN: That is true, yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So -- and then in those\ncases, when the employer says, okay, I will voluntarily\nmake this compensation available, then measuring --\nthe -- the pay would be measured by the time the\nemployer makes -- makes the compensation available,\nright?\nMR. GILLELAN: I think not, because the --\nthe statutory provision says it's the award that's\ndeterminative.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it's --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there's no award.\nMR. GILLELAN: But there can be an award. I\nthink that's the critical --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But we have -- what is --\nI mean, there can be. But here's a person who has been\ninjured and gets compensation without having to bring\nany legal proceeding for it. What is the weekly -- the\nmeasure then? It can't be an award, the date of the\naward, because there is no award. So, what is it?\nMR. GILLELAN: The employer that wants to\nlock in this year's maximum rate and not have his\nliability progress above that simply needs to have an\naward entered.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, he doesn't. No, he\ndoesn't. He can just begin payment. This (c), which is\nthe section we're talking about here, doesn't just\nprovide for newly awarded compensation. It also says\n\"survivors currently receiving compensation for\npermanent total disability or death benefits.\"\n\"Currently receiving.\" Now, does that mean\nit has to have been decreed by the agency? I don't\nthink so.\nMR. GILLELAN: That provision, which -- that\nclause --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That clause.\nMR. GILLELAN: -- that separate clause --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. GILLELAN: -- which is not in this case,\nbecause --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I understand. But it --\nbut it applies to the question, it seems to me, that\nJustice Ginsburg asked, doesn't it?\nMR. GILLELAN: No, I think not.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No?\nMR. GILLELAN: The function of that clause\nis that in permanent total and death cases, because\nthere's an annual escalator provision, whatever your\nrate is this year is going to go up -- if it's a\npermanent total or death case -- is going to go up each\nOctober 1st by the increase in the national average\nrate.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But only if you've been\nreceiving compensation.\nMR. GILLELAN: If you -- if --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay? If neither the\nemployment -- if neither the employer gives you the\ncompensation voluntarily nor as you -- as you contend,\nthere has been an award by the agency, you're out; (c)\ndoesn't apply. Right?\nMR. GILLELAN: I wouldn't say (c) doesn't\napply, no. I think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How else would it apply?\nYou are either receiving compensation, which I would\nunderstand to mean receiving it from the employer or by\nreason of an award, or else you've been newly awarded\ncompensation, which I guess means it hasn't yet been\npaid, but -- but you have the award in your pocket.\nMR. GILLELAN: Well, the -- the function of\nthat separate clause is for cases in which an award has\nbeen entered of death benefits or permanent total\ndisability benefits, and everything up to that point is\ngoverned by the maximum that's in effect at the time of\nthat --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't say that,\ncounsel. It says \"survivors currently receiving\ncompensation.\" It doesn't say \"by virtue of an award.\"\nIt says \"receiving compensation.\" So, if the employer\nis paying it voluntarily, you're in there. And then it\ngoes on and it contrasts with receiving compensation\nthose newly awarded compensation. You're not yet\nreceiving it, but you've been awarded it.\nMR. GILLELAN: Well, Mr. Roberts did not\nfall within the currently receiving compensation --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I understand that.\nMR. GILLELAN: Okay.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But I'm just trying to make\nsense out of the provision. And it doesn't seem to me\nto make any sense unless you read it just the way I\nsuggested.\nMR. GILLELAN: Okay. I hope I can provide\nthat sense. The function of that separate clause is\nthat a claimant who has been awarded compensation at a\ngiven rate, at the -- which is the maximum at the time\nof the award, will continue to receive compensation\nin --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't say that. It\nsays nothing about an award. The last part talks about\nan award. It says \"currently receiving compensation for\npermanent total disability or death benefits.\" And if\nyou're receiving it from your employer, I don't know why\nthat isn't covered by that. Why isn't it covered?\nMR. GILLELAN: I can certainly see that\nthose terms would appear to apply --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. GILLELAN: -- to that situation in which\nthe employer is paying compensation for death or for\npermanent total disability. That wouldn't provide us\nfor a maximum -- any applicable maximum.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think it affects\nyour case. It's just a matter of understanding what\nthis provision is talking about.\nMR. GILLELAN: Yes. And the -- what I'm\ntrying to say about the function of this clause is that\na claimant who has been awarded compensation for\npermanent total disability -- let's assume the employer\nhasn't paid anything until the ALJ issues an award, and\nat the time that award is issued the maximum is $1,000 a\nweek, and the employer was making -- the employee was\nmaking more than 1500. So, that maximum is the rate.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But if the employer has\nbeen paying voluntarily, you don't penalize the employee\nfor not having an award, right? I mean he's in the same\nposition; the employer has conceded the liability.\nMR. GILLELAN: He certainly is not in the\nsame position, no.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, would\nJustice Scalia's reading in your judgment -- accept his\nproposition that those currently receiving voluntary\npayments from the employer fall under subsection (c).\nWould his reading require the employer every year to\nrecalculate the benefits to the maximum that's\nestablished that year?\nMR. GILLELAN: Yes, it would. Yes, it\nwould.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And that's why his\nreading --\nMR. GILLELAN: And that is precisely the\nfunction of that clause.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The function of (b) is\nto set a maximum that will control all payments present\nand future.\nMR. GILLELAN: Yes, yes, definitely.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And so, if you read it\nthe way he does, that maximum would change each year.\nMR. GILLELAN: Yes. And for permanent total\ndisability and death cases --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand why\nthat's so only for employment -- for employer payments\nand not the case for awards. If that's so for the\nemployer's payment, why isn't it so for awards that have\nbeen decreed? Why don't they change every year?\nMR. GILLELAN: They do. If the award is for\npermanent total disability or for death, they do.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. So, then my reading\nmakes perfect sense.\nMR. GILLELAN: Yes, your reading does make\nperfect sense. And the function of that second -- that\n-- the clause for those currently receiving compensation\nfor permanent total or death is that even when the\nmaximum continues to go up after the date of an award,\nthat new maximum is the applicable one for the\ncontinuing period of disability or survivorship.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When -- one of the\narguments on the other side that I thought made some\nsense was the idea that you should focus on a particular\npoint in time when you're figuring out what the amount\nof the award is going to be; that it doesn't make --\nthat it's at least odd to say, well, we're going to\ncalculate how much you're entitled to at this point, but\nin terms of the applicable maximum, we're going to wait\nhowever long it takes and calculate that as of this\npoint. Doesn't it make more sense to figure out the\napplicable numbers at the same point in time?\nMR. GILLELAN: Marginally more sense,\nperhaps so. But that is an argument that should be\naddressed to Congress. Congress could easily have made\nsection 6(c) turn on the time of injury. Instead, they\nprovided very explicitly --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, if we think --\nif we think the statute -- in other words, your\nargument, your response, is that the statute is\nunambiguous and it can't be read --\nMR. GILLELAN: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- in a more\nsensical way.\nMR. GILLELAN: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.\nMR. GILLELAN: Yes, and that each use of the\nterm \"award,\" contrary to the Ninth Circuit's view, is\nconsistent with that. That is, whenever Congress refers\nin this statute to an award or compensation being\nawarded, it is talking about the order making the award\nas it's described in section 19(e).\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't really have to\nestablish that, do you? All you have to establish is\nthat it is -- there is no way in which \"newly awarded\ncompensation\" means entitlement to compensation. That's\nall you have to establish.\nMR. GILLELAN: That is exactly correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't have to show that\nit's used consistently throughout, only that it's never\nused to mean entitlement to compensation.\nMR. GILLELAN: That is -- that is exactly\ncorrect, and I --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Are you conceding in answer\nto these questions that your reading doesn't really make\nany sense; that's just what Congress -- that's what\nCongress did?\nMR. GILLELAN: No, I hope I'm not conceding\nthat.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, what sense does it\nmake? What -- why should the ceiling depend on whether\nan employee is getting compensation voluntarily from the\nemployer or as a result of a formal award? If you have\ntwo identical -- identically situated employees and one\nis getting the compensation without an award and one is\ngetting it with an award, as you understand the term\n\"award,\" why -- what sense does it make to treat them\ndifferently?\nMR. GILLELAN: I would say they certainly\nare not identically situated. The claimant who has an\naward --\nJUSTICE ALITO: They're identically situated\nin every respect except one. One has a formal award;\none does not. What sense does it make to treat them\ndifferently then?\nMR. GILLELAN: There are serious\nconsequences of the fact that one has an award and the\nother is being paid only without an award.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Counsel, if I understood\nyour response to my prior line of questioning, you deny\nthat they are treated differently. The one who is\nreceiving compensation is treated the same, under the\nsame provision. There are two parts to it: survivors\ncurrently receiving compensation and survivors newly\nawarded compensation.\nThose two classes are treated exactly the\nsame. The only one that is treated differently is\nsomebody who is neither being paid by the employer nor\nhas yet received an award.\nMR. GILLELAN: No. No.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No?\nMR. GILLELAN: No, no. The clause that\ndepends on whether you're currently receiving only\napplies to permanent total disability and death cases.\nIn all other cases, the clause that says \"newly awarded\"\nis the only applicable provision.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I see. Partial disability,\nin other words.\nMR. GILLELAN: Correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nMR. GILLELAN: And temporary total.\nTemporary total has -- the rates do not go up each year.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Would you then go back -- I\ndid have the same question Justice Alito asked, and I'd\nlike to hear the answer. The answer -- that there --\nI'll add one footnote, perhaps, which -- make it a more\ncomplete answer, and that is that it makes very little\nsense to me when a worker becomes disabled on January 1,\n1990, for example. He is now disabled. And so, we\ncalculate what his wage was. His wage was $200 a week.\nAnd now we say: But that shouldn't exceed twice the\naverage weekly wage, and we're not going to apply it to\nhim.\nYou're going to apply it to him at some\nrandom date. His wage that he's getting paid is figured\nout as of January 1, 1990.\nMR. GILLELAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But the maximum that it\ncould be is figured out as of January 1, 1998, when he\nfinishes a proceeding.\nNow, I just -- for both reasons, why would\nyou distinguish and why would you get that result? For\nthose two reasons, it doesn't seem to make much sense to\nme, your reading of it, while theirs does make sense.\nNow, you explain why that is.\nMR. GILLELAN: Okay. Okay. I think the\npoint is to encourage the employer to get an award\nentered promptly because that way they will lock in that\nearly maximum rate or minimum rate. The minimum rate\nprovision applies exactly the same way under section\n6(c).\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But I thought Congress\nwanted the system to operate so that people just did it\nvoluntarily without an award.\nMR. GILLELAN: Well, they want that to\nhappen as often as possible, but the employer has the\nright in any case to file a notice with the Department\nof Labor saying we do not believe the claimant is\nentitled to compensation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Counsel, it really doesn't\nmake a whole lot of sense. I mean, it seems to me you\nhave to acknowledge it would be a much better statute\nhad it been written differently. And really your\nargument here is it's not up to us to revise the\ninadequacies of a statute. I mean, your argument is you\njust can't read the language that way. And it provides\na stupid result. There are such things as stupid\nstatutes, and this is one of them, right?\nMR. GILLELAN: I don't think it's stupid,\nbut yes, my basic argument is it isn't.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But you think -- you think\nit is not stupid because you think it is a good idea to\ngive a lot of work to the Department of Labor and that\nall the employers who are going to do this voluntarily\nand there will never be a problem with it -- all should\nbe encouraged to go and get a certificate from the\nDepartment of Labor. All right. I'll take that as --\nsomething.\nAnd now, why is it I can't read the statute\nthe way that it seems to make somewhat more sense? I\ndon't see any words here that stop me from reading it.\nMR. GILLELAN: \"Newly awarded compensation\"\nare the critical words.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Where now there exactly?\nIt says -- you mean in (c)?\nMR. GILLELAN: In -- yes, 6(c).\nJUSTICE BREYER: You just told me that just\nhas to do with permanent or total disability, and this\nis far --\nMR. GILLELAN: No. Excuse me. The other\nclause of that provision, the one that says \"currently\nreceiving compensation\" -- that one only applies to\nsurvivors and permanently totally disabled workers.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But why -- why don't they\nboth? I mean, as I read it naturally, it says that --\nwe now have a special thing, you know, which these\npeople are the dead ones and the widows are getting it\nand the permanently disabled people, and the -- this\nindividual, and the Secretary, the Secretary or his\ndelegate is going to calculate this thing all the time.\nAnd they've got a special thing here for -- for\npermanent people, permanently disabled, and they're\nsaying as to those people, we're giving them a break.\nThey can't look for more work. They can't look for --\nthey're dead, for example, and they can't find other\nsources of income. And so, we say that, that if the\naverage wage goes up and their wage was higher to begin\nwith, we will raise it a bit.\nMR. GILLELAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And that applies not only\nto the people who are just getting this for the first\ntime in the relevant period; it also applies to all\nthose who have been getting it. It applies to both\ngroups. Well, that makes sense to me.\nMR. GILLELAN: For permanent total\ndisability --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Right.\nMR. GILLELAN: -- and death.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Right.\nMR. GILLELAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, the whole thing applies\njust to the permanently disabled and the death things.\nWhat says it applies to anybody else?\nMR. GILLELAN: No, the -- the clause --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The whole thing. The\nwhole -- the whole -- all of (c). That's -- in my thing\nhere, that's seven lines. All of (c) applies to\npermanently disabled and those who died.\nMR. GILLELAN: Well, that's certainly -- no\none has put forward that construction, and that would\nmean that there is no maximum applicable to other\ncategories of disability, like Mr. Roberts's disability.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, yes. Oh.\nMR. GILLELAN: The new --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I feel slightly like an\nAbbott and Costello movie, but I'm getting this --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, what happens to\nyour argument if we disagree with you that employers\nhave a way to seek a compensation order? As I read the\nregulations, the only way they can do that is if the\nemployee files a claim, and the employee's filing of the\nclaim then sets the process in motion. I can't imagine\nthat an -- any employee, knowing that a future award\ncould help them, would bother filing a claim to help the\nemployer lock in his rate.\nMR. GILLELAN: I think -- actually, my\nexperience, my universal experience with this statute,\nis that that is not a realistic view of what claimants'\nbehavior is.\nThe critical difference is an -- the entry\nof an award does not merely confirm that the employer is\nmaking payments; it requires it to continue making those\npayments until --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's not my question.\nMost of your argument is premised on the -- I thought,\nthat the employer could lock in his rate --\nMR. GILLELAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- by seeking an award.\nMR. GILLELAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If I disagree with you\nthat the Act doesn't provide for that and neither do the\nregulations, that only employees can seek awards, what\nhappens to your argument?\nMR. GILLELAN: Oh, I think -- well -- I have\ntrouble accepting that hypothetical situation because --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, as I've studied\nit, I think that's the case. So, assume that fact to be\ntrue, that employers have no regulatory or statutory\nright to seek an award. They can either stop paying and\nhave the employee make a claim or not.\nHow -- what does this do to your argument,\nif that's accurate?\nMR. GILLELAN: Nothing. It simply requires\nthe employer to induce the claimant to file a claim if\nit wants that award.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: By stopping payment.\nMR. GILLELAN: Yes. Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, that destroys the\nwhole voluntary payment aspects of this.\nMR. GILLELAN: Well, they wouldn't --\nindeed, they wouldn't have to stop payment. They simply\nneed to tell the claimant: If you don't file a claim,\nwe're going to stop payments. No --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn't it an odd statute?\nJUSTICE BREYER: I see. Is your argument\nthis now -- I'm sorry to be so slow. But that, look,\nthere is a statute here; it that says compensation\ncannot exceed more than 200 percent of the annual weekly\n-- or the weekly wage. Then in (3), it says how to\ncalculate that particular number. And then you go over\nto (c), and (c) says that calculated number applies to\nthose newly awarded compensation.\nAnd you're saying \"newly awarded\ncompensation\" means somebody got it through an award,\nnot somebody got it automatically. And since somebody\ngot it -- had to get it through an award or it wouldn't\napply when you just get it because they pay for it, it\njust doesn't apply. You have to go get the award. And\nthe word you're turning on is \"newly awarded.\"\nMR. GILLELAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's the argument?\nMR. GILLELAN: Yes, it is.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Like Abbott and Costello, I\ndon't know what I'm talking about. But I do -- I do --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: I was -- I was --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Gillelan --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now I fully understand your\nargument.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Counsel, could I --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Could I follow --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Could I ask you about\nanother inconsistency in this section? We've gone over\none, which I think is there. Isn't there a group left\nout of this thing, even under -- even under the\nGovernment's interpretation of it? What happens to\npeople who are receiving compensation for temporary\ntotal disability or for partial disability? They\ndon't -- they don't come under either one of those two\ncategories, even under the Government's interpretation,\nright?\nMR. GILLELAN: No. I think under the\nGovernment's interpretation, as under ours, they fall\nunder those --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, they haven't gotten an\naward yet. They have not gotten an award yet, and they\nare only partially disabled or have temporary permanent\ndisability. They're -- they're not covered by (c), are\nthey?\nMR. GILLELAN: Well, they are covered by it,\nbut before we know which year's maximum applies, an\naward --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, that's right, but\nthey --\nMR. GILLELAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't take effect --\nMR. GILLELAN: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- during that year.\nMR. GILLELAN: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, does that make any\nsense?\nMR. GILLELAN: Yes --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, it doesn't. But you\nsay the statute doesn't make sense.\nMR. GILLELAN: I think it does because it\nencourages the employer to have an award entered so that\nit will have the benefit of the current maximum rate and\nnot next year's or the year's after or the year's after\nthat.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not a\nserious --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Gillelan, if a --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Go ahead. You've\nbeen -- you've been waiting the longest.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I think the way the argument\nhas gone so far is that we've all been saying this can't\nmake sense, and you've been saying, as you have every\nright to say, yes, but this is what the statute says\nbased on the \"newly awarded\" language.\nBut that does assume that \"newly awarded\"\ncan't mean an entitlement. And then you run up against\nsome other statutory provisions where an award does seem\nto mean, not a formal compensation order, but instead an\nentitlement to funds. So, 908(d)(1), it seems as though\nthe word \"award\" means entitlement; 910(h)(1), it seems\nas though the word \"award\" means an entitlement; and\n933(b), which says \"award in a compensation order,\"\nsuggests that awards can be made in a formal order or\nawards can be made differently because of an entitlement\nthat is automatically paid.\nSo, I guess there are three places that it\nseems to me your reading of the word -- your limited\nreading of the phrase \"newly awarded,\" you know, runs\ninto problems in those three ways, and I'm left then\nthinking we should do what makes sense.\nMR. GILLELAN: I may have missed what the\nthird of those was. I have the --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: 933(b), 908(d)(1), and\n910(h)(1).\nMR. GILLELAN: Ah, okay. Yes, 9 -- the\nsection 8(d)(1) that they're referring to refers to an\naward to an -- the unpaid portion of an award to an\nemployee who dies before that award has been paid out.\nTheir reading of \"award\" in that provision is\ncontradicted by the subsequent paragraph of the same\nsubsection, which says \"an award may be made after the\ndeath of the injured employee.\" It's 908(d)(3).\nNow, that is impossible on their reading of\n\"award\" -- on the reading they give \"award\" in section\n8(d)(1). No, what it means in 8(d)(1), as throughout\nthe Act, is an award. And if none has been entered\nwhile the claimant is still alive, it's entered after\nhis death. And the survivors under that provision take\nthe rest of it that had not been paid before the death.\nNow, we have essentially the same analysis\nof those other provisions. Yes, in those other\nprovisions as well, it does mean a compensation order.\nIf you cut it loose from that statutory foundation, we\nget three or four different possible meanings that the\nRespondents try to put on it, and we are cut loose from\nanything.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you're -- you're\nmaking your case harder than it has to be, it seems to\nme, by saying that it always means an award of\ncompensation by the agency.\nI -- I think in -- in 8(d), I don't think it\nmeans that, but it certainly means an amount due and not\nan entitlement. It means an amount, a specific amount\ndue, and that explains its meaning elsewhere, but that's\nquite different from saying that it means entitlement.\nMR. GILLELAN: No doubt it is, yes. And --\nand perhaps there may be some variation in the meaning\nin the other provisions. That's possible. But in\nsection 6(d), we think it has to mean the entry of an\naward. That's the only definite event it could refer\nto.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, I think that's true,\nbut only because of the earlier portion of 6(c) which --\nwhich covers all other payments that are not by virtue\nof an award.\nMR. GILLELAN: Right. Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Receiving compensation.\nMR. GILLELAN: Yes.\nI would reserve what time I have left.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. GILLELAN: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Palmore.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH R. PALMORE\nON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL RESPONDENT\nMR. PALMORE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nPetitioner's interpretation of section 906,\nwhich hinges entirely on the date of an administrative\ncompensation order, renders that provision impossible to\napply in the many cases expressly contemplated by the\nAct in which there is no such order. That\ninterpretation also creates arbitrary distinctions\nbetween beneficiaries' benefit levels based on\nadministrative happenstance.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Your --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, if you're --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm sorry.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, if you're\nwalking down the street, you're on a business\nenterprise, they haven't shoveled the snow, you slip and\nfall and you're hurt, you go home and say: Good news,\nI've been awarded damages.\nMR. PALMORE: The statute provides for the\naward of damages, and I think this is -- this -- the key\nto this, understanding how this scheme works, is\nunderstanding section 914 and section 913. These are at\npage 17a --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But we're not talking --\nMR. PALMORE: -- of the appendix.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- about how the scheme\nworks. Grant you that it makes a lot more sense your\nway, but you -- will you grant that it's not up to us to\nrewrite the statute?\nMR. PALMORE: It's absolutely not up to\nyou --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nMR. PALMORE: -- to rewrite the statute,\nJustice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, what we're talking\nabout is whether \"awarded\" in that provision can bear\nthe meaning that you want to give it. Let's assume that\nCongress passes a -- a new statute providing for tax\ncredits for -- for each child, okay? My wife gives\nbirth to a child just before Christmas, and I say, oh,\ngoody; I've been awarded $2,000. I wouldn't say that.\nThat's not a normal use of the language.\nMR. PALMORE: I think it's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I am entitled to it under\nthis statute. But when the event of having a child\noccurs, I don't say I've been awarded $2,000. You might\nsay it analogously. I mean, you know, oh, hey, I've\nbeen awarded $2,000. But that's analogous. And\nstatutes are not written by analogy; they're written to\nsay what they say.\nAnd I don't know anybody that would use the\nterm \"awarded\" the way you want it used. The Chief\nJustice's example is another one: Oh, good, I've been\nawarded damages.\nYou haven't been awarded damages. You're\nentitled to them.\nMR. PALMORE: I think Justice Kagan\nhighlighted three provisions where the statute does in\nfact use the word \"award\" to indicate a statutory\nentitlement.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Let's go through those.\nMR. PALMORE: I'd be glad to, Justice\nScalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you -- you show me\nhow -- I agree with you that they don't mean the entry\nof an award by the agency, but I don't agree with you\nthat the only -- only reading you can give them is\nentitlement.\nMR. PALMORE: Well, just -- to start with\nsection 933, which is at page 24a of the Government\nappendix. This is one of the sections highlighted by\nJustice Kagan.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: 933 --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- of the gray\nbrief.\nMR. PALMORE: Of the gray brief. 933(b)\nsays: \"Acceptance of compensation under an award in a\ncompensation order filed by the deputy commissioner\"\nwill have certain consequences. That expressly\ncontemplates -- this is page 24a, Justice Scalia.\nSorry.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm sorry. Give me a\nminute. Give me a minute.\nMR. PALMORE: Okay.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The language is important,\nisn't it?\nMR. PALMORE: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. What page?\nMR. PALMORE: Page 24a of the appendix to\nthe gray brief.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. Got it.\nMR. PALMORE: Okay.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And the language is?\nMR. PALMORE: So, the first sentence says:\n\"Acceptance of compensation under an award in a\ncompensation order\" --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. PALMORE: -- \"filed by the deputy\ncommissioner\" shall have certain legal consequences --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. PALMORE: -- that aren't important here.\nThat sentence, even read by itself, suggests there can\nbe an award that's not in a compensation order.\nMoreover --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, yes. Yes.\nMR. PALMORE: -- the last sentence says:\n\"For purposes of this subsection\" -- not the purposes of\nthe entire Act -- \"for purposes of this subsection, the\nterm 'award' with respect to a compensation order means\na formal order issued by the deputy commissioner, an\nadministrative law judge\" --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's -- that's true. And\nwhat that means is that it can be considered an award if\nyou've gotten it from the employer voluntarily. That is\nstill an award of compensation.\nThat's all that that last sentence proves.\nMR. PALMORE: I think it contemplates -- it\ncertainly precludes, I think, Petitioner --\nPetitioner's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, yes. Yes. I agree\nhe's wrong.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. PALMORE: Well, the actual -- the\n\"actual receipt\" interpretation that Your Honor is\nadvancing is not one that's been advanced in this case.\nIt would have extraordinarily -- extraordinary practical\ndifficulties, and application would be really\ninconsistent.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, no, no. I think he's\npersuaded me that in -- in the section we're talking\nabout, subsection (c), the only meaning left for \"award\"\nis an award by the agency, because --\nMR. PALMORE: Well, I'd like to try -- I'd\nlike to try to convince you otherwise.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but you have to show\nme one other provision at least where the only meaning\nyou can give \"award\" is entitlement to money.\nMR. PALMORE: Well, I think section\n910(h)(1), another provision cited by Justice Kagan, is\nanother example.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: (h)(1)?\nMR. PALMORE: (h)(1).\nJUSTICE SCALIA: \"Upward adjustments to\" --\nMR. PALMORE: At 15a.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- \"compensation to\nwhich\" --\nMR. PALMORE: Right. This is a very\ncomplicated provision, but what's important to note here\nis that Congress made -- this was Congress's attempt to\nprovide additional benefits to beneficiaries whose\ndisabilities commenced before 1972.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. PALMORE: They make a critical --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What page are you on?\nMR. PALMORE: I'm sorry. Page 15a of the\nappendix to the gray brief.\nThe specifics aren't as important as the use\nof the phrase, and it's one, two, three, four, five\nlines from the bottom, \"or his survivor was awarded\ncompensation as the result of death.\" So, it makes a\nkey determinant for figuring out how these adjustments\nare going to be made whether someone was awarded\ncompensation prior to October 27th, 1972. There's no\nindication here, and it would make no sense to suggest,\nthat Congress meant to distinguish between people who\nhad a formal compensation order and those who didn't.\nI think -- but if I could go back to\nsection --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: His answer to that was\nthat the provision also permits an entry after someone\n-- of an order after someone dies.\nMR. PALMORE: That's his answer on some of\nthe other provisions --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, it's -- the\nincongruity is taken care of by the Act directly.\nMR. PALMORE: Right. But here that -- here\nthere'd be no reason for someone to go in and get a\ncompensation order, because these were long-past\ndisabilities, and Congress was simply creating a rule\nfor how to true up these past beneficiaries and provide\nthem additional benefits.\nBut I think if you --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what does \"awarded\ncompensation at less than the maximum rate\" mean? I'm\nnot sure what that refers to.\nMR. PALMORE: There was an old maximum.\nPrior to 1972, there was a $70 maximum.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. PALMORE: Okay. So, if someone was --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Aren't you entitled to get\nthe maximum? No?\nMR. PALMORE: Yes. But some people --\ntwo-thirds of their average weekly wage resulted in a\nfigure below the maximum, right? So, for those people,\nwhat section 910(h)(1) did was said if you were awarded\ncompensation at less than the prior maximum, you're\ngoing to get an inflation adjustment.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I got you.\nMR. PALMORE: For everyone else who was\nalready at the maximum, they got a new, statutorily\ncreated time of injury, which is itself significant,\nthat Congress went -- used that route.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. PALMORE: But there's no indication --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're right. It doesn't\nmake sense. It --\nMR. PALMORE: Well, it doesn't make sense\nunder Petitioner's reading. I think it does make sense\nunder our reading.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, yes.\nMR. PALMORE: Okay?\nAnd if you go to page -- page 17a, I think\nthese are the key provisions for understanding how\nsection 906 works in the statutory scheme. Section 914,\nat the bottom of the page, 17a to the Government's\nbrief, provides that employers must pay compensation\nwithout a compensation order promptly, as soon as they\nhave notice of an injury.\n(b), which is on the next page, 18a, says\nthat the first payment has to come in 14 days, within\n14 days of notice of the injury, unless the employer\ncontroverts liability.\nSo, if I'm an employer, I have an employee\nwho's injured, I've got to get out my checkbook on day\n14 and start writing checks. I need to know what number\nto fill in. I need to know --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you're doing\nthat -- you're doing that without an award.\nMR. PALMORE: Correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, how can you say\nwhat the employer pays should be considered an award?\nMR. PALMORE: Because --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's without an\naward.\nMR. PALMORE: Because if you don't consider\nthat, then the -- the statutory maximum provision is\nimpossible to apply because then it's unclear -- and I\nhaven't heard Petitioner answer what the statutory\nmaximum is. If that employee who gets his first check\nafter 14 days has not been newly awarded compensation\nand --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then we're back --\nwe're back to (b) overrides (a). You -- you're saying\nthat (a) would be interpreted in favor of the Petitioner\nbut for (b)?\nMR. PALMORE: No, I'm saying that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Because I agree with the\nChief Justice. Without an award, it seems to me it\ntends to help the Petitioner.\nMR. PALMORE: That use of \"award\" clearly\nmeans compensation order, and I'm not here to suggest\nthat the -- that the statute never uses the word \"award\"\nto mean compensation order. Often it does, and in this\ncase, that provision does. But the larger point is that\nthat employer has to start payments in 14 days, and he\nhas to know what statutory maximum applies. Under\nPetitioner's view of the statute, there is no answer to\nthat question, because that employee has not been newly\nawarded compensation. So, section 906(c) --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And in what percentage of\nthe cases are we in that world?\nMR. PALMORE: It's a -- in a substantial\nmajority of cases no claim is ever filed, Justice Kagan.\nPage 38 of the red brief points to legislative history\nbefore Congress in 1972 which demonstrated that, and\nthat remains the case. This is a workers'\ncompensation scheme that encourages employers to pay\nwithout administrative compulsion. It's supposed to be\nsimple to apply. The employer is supposed to know how\nmuch to write that check for at the time he writes that\nfirst check, after 14 days.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But your reading doesn't\nencourage employers to pay, because they can stop just\nby saying they contest, right?\nMR. PALMORE: Absolutely. They have a\nstatutory right to controvert.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So -- so, your reading I\nthink leads to protraction. And they get that date of\ninjury rule no matter how long they string it out under\nyour reading. If you read -- what is the magic\nphrase -- newly --\nMR. PALMORE: Newly awarded compensation.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You can say, well, that\nmeans in the case of the employer who pays promptly,\npays immediately and continues to pay voluntarily, that\nthe compensation is acquired when the employer starts\npaying voluntarily. But if the employer is not paying,\nthen the compensation is newly awarded when there's an\naward.\nSo, I don't see why -- what kind of problems\nthis statute would have if we say newly awarded could\nmean awarded by the statute, which would be newly\nawarded when you're injured; but it can also mean\ncompensation ordered by an award. So, you have the\nemployer who pays promptly can lock in that early date,\nbut if he doesn't pay promptly, the -- then the ceiling\nis going to go up till the time the award is entered.\nWhat's wrong with that reading?\nMR. PALMORE: That's again a reading that\nhasn't been advanced in this case, but I understand Your\nHonor's question and Your Honor's point. I think that\nreading of it would be very difficult to apply because\nthere may be many cases where an employer will write one\nor two checks and then stop. There made be cases in\nwhich an employer will write a check for the wrong\namount; there will later be a dispute about what the\nproper benefit level would be.\nSo, I think you'd develop a whole body of\ncase law and controversy about what it meant for the\nemployer to have paid, in that sense.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But those aren't\ngoing to be the typical cases, I think. You said there\nmay be cases, and I suppose there may be. I assume what\nhappens -- employers just don't write checks. They say\nthis is how we calculate what we owe you. And it is\nbased on the maximum of this year, not any future ones,\nand if the employee says no, no, no; I have a right to\nget the -- then the employer will say, well, okay, I\neither agree with that or not, but you don't get a\ncheck.\nMR. PALMORE: Well, the -- the employer will\nneed to protect itself by writing that check unless it's\ngoing to controvert liability. Justice Ginsburg pointed\nto one of Petitioner's arguments that this provides an\nincentive for employers not to controvert liability when\nthey don't have a good-faith basis for doing so, but\nsection 928 of the Act provides for attorney's fees in\nthat situation. So, there's already a remedy for that\nkind of situation.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I -- I understand\nthe amounts at issue here. What is a usual amount\nthat's at stake in this sort of case? We're talking\nabout the concerns -- I guess on both -- about\ngamesmanship, but how much difference are we talking\nabout?\nMR. PALMORE: Well, the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't know; maybe\nyou don't have statistics, on an average.\nMR. PALMORE: Well, I can -- we can use this\ncase as an -- as an illustration. So, in this case, the\nPetitioner's disability began in 2002. So, our view is\nthat that's when he was initially awarded compensation.\nAnd so, the 2002 maximum of $966 applies.\nPetitioner's view is that because he\nreceived a formal compensation order in 2007, the 2007\nmaximum applies, this 1,114.\nSo, it can make a considerable difference.\nI think, though, that Petitioner recognizes --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The consequence -- I\nmean, there's the time value of money, too. The\nconsequence of the employee saying I'm going to wait 5\nyears because I think the maximum is going to be a lot\nhigher is that he doesn't get anything in the meantime,\nright?\nMR. PALMORE: Well, that's -- that's right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's reasonable for\nan employer to say, okay, if you want to wait, I'll\nwait.\nMR. PALMORE: That's right. The larger\npoint though is that in many cases in which compensation\nis paid without compulsion of a compensation order, an\nemployee never files a claim. Section 913 expressly\ncontemplates that by saying that an employee has 1 year\nin which to file a claim from an injury unless he has\nbeen receiving payments, in which case the time runs\nfrom the last payment received.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What happens -- just for my\ntechnical knowledge here. The -- the employee suffers\npartial disability on February 1. He then doesn't\nnotify the employer until, let's say, February 10, and\nthen the employer waits for a week or so, and then\nbegins to pay.\nNow, is the employer supposed to calculate\nthe -- the weekly wage that he's paying on in the week\nFebruary 1 to February 10 or -- 3 days, he puts it\naside. But -- in the first week or does he do it on the\nfirst week he got notice? How is that -- how does that\nwork?\nMR. PALMORE: Well, he needs to provide --\nhe needs to make a payment within 14 days --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's right.\nMR. PALMORE: -- of notice.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But I'm saying he has to\nwrite the check now.\nMR. PALMORE: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And the wage could have\nchanged in those few weeks.\nMR. PALMORE: It's from the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The first week he didn't\nget the notice. Then the second week he did get the\nnotice. Which week does he calculate the payment on?\nMR. PALMORE: From when the disability\ncommenced.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So, what you're\nnot --\nMR. PALMORE: And --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then we can't -- we cannot\nread this thing \"award\" to mean award by the employer.\nWe can't mean it to read \"award\" by the -- by the\ngovernment, in your view. We have to mean it to mean\nthe time that he became entitled to some money.\nMR. PALMORE: That is our submission --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. PALMORE: -- Justice Breyer. And --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And the tough thing is\nsaying, well, that that's an award. That's what this\ncase turns on.\nMR. PALMORE: Well, as we -- as I was\ndiscussing earlier, we think that the statute does\nsometimes use \"award\" that way.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And what you pointed to in\nthe statute is you pointed to some situations which say\nwe have situation 3 and 4, and they're not present here;\nbut in situation 3 or 4, award does mean this.\nMR. PALMORE: I think --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. That's --\nMR. PALMORE: Right. I think if I can show\nyou -- if I can show you -- there are some cases --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You don't have another\nexample of a -- of a situation where \"award\" did mean --\nand so, you're saying there are some others where\n\"award\" doesn't mean, okay. But --\nMR. PALMORE: Well, I think there are --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- is there anything --\nwhat's the most analogous thing you can find anywhere\nwhere award has referred to the time a person became\nentitled to a thing, prior to the time anyone was --\nbecame obliged to give him some money?\nMR. PALMORE: Well, I think --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Even if that time first was\nthe period for -- way for calculating the money?\nMR. PALMORE: I think 910(h)(1) is that\nexample --\nJUSTICE BREYER: 910(h)(1).\nMR. PALMORE: And I hesitate to go back into\nthe weeds of that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no, don't do it again.\nMR. PALMORE: -- provision.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. PALMORE: But the first sentence says --\nit talks about those who were entitled to total\npermanent disability or death, which commenced -- so, it\ntalks about commencement of entitlement and then --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It says was awarded\ncompensation.\nMR. PALMORE: -- and then later uses\n\"awarded compensation.\" If I could go back quickly to\nthe claim issue.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, okay.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Your brief -- your brief\nseem to use the \"newly awarded compensation,\" your\nmeaning of it, at the time of injury, the time of\ndisability, the time of entitlement to compensation.\nAnd it seems to use those terms interchangeably. What\nterm are you settling on and why?\nMR. PALMORE: Okay. I think we address this\nin footnote 9 of our brief. It's the commencement of\nentitlement to disability benefits, which is almost\nalways going to be when disability itself commences.\nPetitioner has pointed out that there is an\nidiosyncratic set of cases in which, if a disability\nlasts more than 3 days but fewer than 14, you're not\ncompensated for those first 3 days. So, in that unusual\ncircumstance, it would be day 4, but the employer who\nwrites that check at day 14 is going to know. That's --\nthat's the key.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, you can do it. You\ncan say it's the time that the statute awards him the\ncompensation. That's the English language.\nMR. PALMORE: That's -- that's correct,\nJustice -- Justice Breyer. And I think that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But it's the statute that's\ndoing the awarding.\nMR. PALMORE: To make his -- I think\nPetitioner has developed kind of a procedural\nwork-around to the -- the problem created by his\ninterpretation the statute, which is that he needs a\ncompensation order in every case to make the scheme make\nsense. To get compensation order, he needs a claim in\nevery case. And as the colloquy before reflected, the\nway he can get a claim in every case, because in many\ncases claims are not filed today, is that the employer\nmust threaten the disabled employee to cut off benefits\nif that employee doesn't file a claim, threaten to\ncontrovert liability when that employer has no\ngood-faith basis for doing so. All to get the employee\nto file a claim that the claim -- employee doesn't think\nis necessary, to get a compensation order which serves\nno other purpose than to trigger this maximum rate\nprovision.\nThat's contrary to the way this statute is\nsupposed to work. The statute is supposed to encourage\namicable agreement between employers and employees to\navoid administrative process and the gearing up of the\nadministrative machinery wherever possible.\nAnd Petitioner's proffered solution to the\nproblem of the absence of a compensation order in every\ncase is contrary to that of the entire thrust of the\nLongshore Act as a workers' compensation scheme.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And your answer to the --\nto the problem of an employer protracting -- so he\ndoesn't have to pay sooner; he can wait till later -- is\nthere would be no penalty as long as the employer says\nI'm -- I'm contesting, but you say the attorney's fees,\nthat's -- is that --\nMR. PALMORE: Attorney's fees and interest,\nboth of which are generally applicable remedies that\napply to cases that don't implicate the statutory\nmaximum or the statutory minimum. This -- Petitioner's\nsolution using his reading of the statute to deal with\nemployer delay is over-inclusive and under-inclusive.\nIt's over-inclusive because it's going to\ndeal with cases in which there hasn't been delay by any\nresponsibility by the employer, but there's been\nadministrative delay, there's been a dispute.\nBut it's also under-inclusive in that it\nonly deals with those small number of cases that deal\nwith the statutory maximum or minimum.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Palmore.\nWe'll let Mr. Keisler speak for a bit.\nMr. Keisler.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER D. KEISLER\nON BEHALF OF THE PRIVATE RESPONDENT\nMR. KEISLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI'd like to begin, if I may, by addressing\nJustice Scalia's and the Chief Justice's questions on\nwhether the term \"award\" can bear the meaning that we\nascribe to it and then explain why, since it can bear\nthat meaning, this is the only sensible interpretation\nof the Act.\nFirst, it is not uncommon, Your Honor, to\nuse the term \"award\" to describe a benefit conferred by\na statute. The dictionary definition is a benefit\nconferred. Your Honor, Justice Scalia used a\nformulation -- what if a statute awards a tax credit?\nWell, the Court's decision in New Energy Company v.\nLimbach began: An Ohio statute awards a tax credit to a\ncertain producers of ethanol.\nI think even Your Honor was the author of\nthat decision. It is --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, well, I -- I agree\nwith that. You can speak of the statute as awarding\nsomething. But when you use the phrase \"newly awarded,\"\nyou're not referring to the enactment of the statute;\nyou're referring to the time at which the person\nqualifies under the statute. And I don't know any usage\nof that sort, that a person -- well, you know, when my\nwife has a baby, I've been awarded money.\nYou haven't been awarded money.\nMR. KEISLER: I think the party becomes\nnewly awarded at the time the party becomes disabled,\nand, therefore, there is an amount due under the\nstatute. And --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, that's what you say.\nBut I don't know -- I don't know any common usage that\nemploys the term --\nMR. KEISLER: But it is a usage within the\nLongshore Act elsewhere, as Mr. Palmore --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What about the -- the\nbusiness was newly awarded the tax credit at the time\nthey made the deduction?\nMR. KEISLER: At the time they became\nqualified for what the statute required them to do to\nget the tax credit, yes. And that is how it is used in\n910(h)(1), as Justice Kagan said. It's how it's used in\n908. And section 933 specifically provides Petitioner's\ndefinition of \"award,\" a formal compensation order, but\nsays it is only for purposes of this subsection.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it's not the way\nit's used in 914.\nMR. KEISLER: That's correct. And that's\nwhy this is a case like Robinson v. Shell Oil, in which\nthe word \"employer\" was used throughout Title VII in\ndifferent ways. And what the Court said is you then\nhave to look at the context of the individual provision\nin which the word appears that you're construing to\ndetermine how the word is being used in that particular\nprovision.\nAnd here the most fundamental reason why it\nis an untenable construction of this Act to rely on the\ndate of a compensation order to determine the applicable\nmaximum rate is that then the Act would be silent as to\nthe maximum rate in the vast majority of instances in\nwhich compensation is paid, because, as Mr. Palmore\nsaid, in the vast majority of instances no claim is\nfiled. And, as Justice Sotomayor pointed out, when no\nclaim is filed, no compensation order will ever be\nissued.\nAnd that's not an accident. That is a\nfunction of a very central feature of the Act's design\nthat Petitioner's interpretation is entirely at odds\nwith. The Act is designed to enable compensation to be\ncalculated precisely and as early as possible so that\nthe money can get into the employee's hands very quickly\nand with a minimum of instances in which the\nadministrative machinery has to be invoked. That's why\nthe norm is no compensation order.\nAnd so, Petitioner's interpretation is\ncounter to that in at least two respects: It relies on\nthe existence of a compensation order, which in most\ninstances won't and shouldn't issue, and it would\nmaximize, rather than minimize, the number of instances\nin which someone has to go and get an order to force\ncompensation orders out of the system to make\nPetitioner's interpretation work, even though everything\nis happening exactly as the Act says it should. The\nemployer is voluntarily paying exactly the amount that\nthe employee says is due, and there's no need to get the\nagency involved.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But how much of a\npractical problem is this? I understand the -- the\namounts are here, but it's 5 years, and apparently the\nemployee was happy to wait 5 years to get an award.\nNormally, if you're an employee and you're disabled, and\nthe employer says, well, here's what we're going to give\nyou, and it's based on the maximum of the latest we\nhave, you're not going to say: I'm going to wait; these\nwages are going to go up nationally, and I'm going to\nwait a year; maybe I'll wait 4 years because I think\nthere's a trend on national average wages, and I'm going\nto cash in on that; I'm going to be without money for\nthe next 4 years and I'm disabled, but -- I mean, that\ndoesn't sound to me to be a plausible situation.\nMR. KEISLER: But if Your Honor thinks about\nthe situation in which the employee is voluntarily\nreceiving from the employer everything that the employee\nagrees is due, then the question is, in that\ncircumstance where the employer is doing everything\nright, what can the employer do to force out of the\nsystem a compensation order that will lock in the\nmaximum rate? And Petitioner's solution to that problem\nevidences the problem with his position.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, no, I mean --\nI don't know what the employers do, but usually in a\nsituation like this, the employers have good lawyers and\nthey write at the end of the check, you know: This is\nin full satisfaction of any claims under the -- the\nwhatever.\nMR. KEISLER: But there is no compensation\norder until that employee files a claim. And under\nPetitioner's interpretation, there would therefore be no\nknowable maximum rate. And Petitioner's solution to\nthat problem, on page 16 of his reply brief, is to say\nthat the employer should threaten a bad-faith cutoff of\nfunds. The employer should say I will cut you off\nunless you file a claim.\nThat's bad for everyone. It's bad for the\nemployee who has access to payments delayed. It's bad\nfor the employer who apparently is being told it must\ncontrovert liability in bad faith, because the employer\ndoesn't in fact disagree that the employee is entitled\nto liability, or face a 10 percent penalty for cutting\noff the employee without a basis for controverting\nliability. And it's bad for the agency who suddenly has\nall these claims filed. All in a situation in which\neverything is working exactly as the Act intends.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Give me your example again\nof \"award\" used as \"entitlement.\"\nMR. KEISLER: 910(h)(1).\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, no, no. Not from the\nstatute.\nMR. KEISLER: Okay.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you gave --\nMR. KEISLER: Oh, New Energy Company v.\nLimbach. It was a Commerce Clause case from, I think,\n1989 in which Your Honor began the opinion by saying, to\ndescribe the setup, an Ohio statute awards tax benefits\nto... and then described the category of energy\nproducers who could take advantage of the tax benefit.\nAnd I think those energy producers --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That wasn't -- you gave\nanother example.\nMR. KEISLER: Robinson v. Shell oil?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, not a case.\nMR. KEISLER: Okay.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Just an example you made up\nout of your fertile imagination which --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- which seemed to me\npretty good. But I forgot it. I'll get --\nMR. KEISLER: An example --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'll get it from the\ntranscript.\nMR. KEISLER: I think it's the employee who\nwas receiving voluntary payments, and everything is\nproceeding the way the Act intended. But the employer,\nin order to know what its maximum rate will be, in order\nnot to be surprised 5 years hence by a maximum rate that\nonly then can be known, has to force a compensation\norder out of the system. And the only way Petitioner\nsays the employer can do that is by threatening a\nbad-faith cutoff of funds.\nWhether it happens frequently or\ninfrequently, Mr. Chief Justice, I think an\ninterpretation that relies on a mechanism that is so\nobviously counter to the way the statute is supposed to\nfunction is, by virtue of that, an extremely unlikely\nand unnatural interpretation of the statute.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: About what percentage of\nthe compensation cases involve the statutory maximum?\nBecause if you -- if your pay is less than the statutory\nmaximum, this issue doesn't come up.\nMR. KEISLER: In 1972, Congress was told\nthat it would be about 10 percent. My understanding is\nsince then, it's grown so that I'm told that about 20\npercent of cases today require application of the\nmaximum rate.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does the maximum\nalways go up?\nMR. KEISLER: Ever since 1972, each year's\nmaximum as calculated by the Secretary of Labor has been\nhigher than the preceding year.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Theoretically, it\ncan go down.\nMR. KEISLER: Theoretically, it can. It\nnever has.\nIf the Court has no further questions.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Keisler, if I could just\ngo back to this language. If -- if according to Justice\nScalia's old opinion, the statute awards compensation at\nthe time of disability, essentially what you would be\nsaying is that an employee who becomes disabled in a\ncertain year is awarded compensation at that time. Is\nthat right?\nMR. KEISLER: That's right, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but I -- I didn't say\nin that opinion that the -- the employer in -- in that\n-- or whoever it was that was entitled under the statute\n-- was \"newly awarded\" it. I agree the statute awards\nit, but when you say somebody is \"newly awarded,\" you're\ntalking about an event at that time. And that's --\nMR. KEISLER: I think the function --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's a different usage.\nMR. KEISLER: I think the function of\n\"newly\" in this statute is something different,\nJustice Scalia. And that relates to the questions that\nYour Honor and Justice Breyer were asking about the\nrelationship between the \"currently receiving\" clause\nand the final clause. I think the \"currently receiving\"\nclause, which relates to those with permanent total\ndisability and death, is an adjunct to another provision\nof the Act, section 19(f), which provides for a COLA, a\ncost-of-living increase, every year for that narrow\nsubset of the most disabled of employees. They and they\nalone get that annual bump-up.\nAnd so, that \"currently receiving\" clause is\nwritten for that category to make sure that their\nbump-up isn't capped by a static maximum rate. The\nother part of the clause, \"newly awarded compensation,\"\nis about everybody else.\nNow, I think the use of the word \"newly\"\nthere is just to distinguish it from the \"currently\nreceiving\" clause, which is escalating year by year.\nAnd those newly awarded compensation, meaning at one\npoint, fixed in time -- only when you are \"newly\"\nawarded compensation are you then going to have your\nmaximum rate fixed.\nAnd then -- and both Petitioner and we\nagree -- whatever it's fixed at, whatever year, that\nstays the same for the duration of your collection of\ncompensation.\nIf the Court has no further questions, I\nthank the Court.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Gillelan, if I got that right, you have\n2 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOSHUA T. GILLELAN, II,\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, let's assume an\nemployer pays, continues to pay over a period of time,\nand the employee needs more money and goes in and says\nyou owe me more money; I'm going to make a claim. The\nboard says no, he doesn't owe you more money; he was\npaying the right amount. And so, you're not entitled to\nthe 1200 you're asking for; you're only entitled to the\n1,000 he was paying.\nUnder your view, if that happened 5 or 10\nyears after the payments started, would the employer be\nliable for the higher average 10 years later?\nMR. GILLELAN: Only, of course, if the\nemployee's own wages at the time of the injury qualified\nfor that, but yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Assuming it does, that\nthe answer is \"yes\"?\nMR. GILLELAN: Yes. Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, what stops an\nemployee from simply doing what I said? What stops an\nemployee from kicking up his own maximum by -- whenever\nhe chooses to do it, years and years later?\nMR. GILLELAN: Well, I think in that\nsituation, the claimant hasn't triggered that award. In\nfact, the claimant has triggered the maximum that's in\neffect at the time of that award that only makes -- it's\nan award only of what the employer has been paying.\nIt's not a denial, as it's characterized in the\nGovernment's brief. But it is an award only of what of\nthe employer has been paying.\nIf the claimant did not bring it forward\nwith that and the employer let it go for still further\nyears, then even a subsequent year's maximum would be\nthe actual --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If we find any ambiguity\nin the statute, in the statutory language, would it then\nmake more sense to adopt your meaning or the\nGovernment's, given all of the factors that the\nGovernment argues counsels in its favor?\nMR. GILLELAN: I think each of those\narguments is fallacious. They misdescribe the statute\nin their reasons why this is not a sensible provision.\nBut even if there is an ambiguity --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Assume that --\nMR. GILLELAN: Before we lose, that -- the\nother possible meanings of \"newly awarded\" have got to\ninclude what they say the test is.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
