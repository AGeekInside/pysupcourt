ESTRADA\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. ESTRADA: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nFor two decades, courts of appeals\nconfronting Section 1346 have been unanimous on, at\nmost, three points.\nThe first one is that the unvarnished text\nof the statute is vague, amorphous, open-ended, and\nessentially, not very helpful.\nThe second one is that a meaningful attempt\nto construe the statute can take place, if at all, only\nin light of a body of law that this Court rejected in\nMcNally and Congress likely intended to restore in the\nact.\nAnd the third is that this exercise is\nfraught with due process and federalism problems and\nrisks the creation of common law crimes, especially in\nthe private sector where the pre-McNally precedent was\nnot well-developed.\nThe principal question in this case is\nwhether a prosecution may be sustained under a 1346\ntheory, under a theory that was not successful before\nMcNally and, in fact, had been affirmatively rejected,\neven in the heyday of the intangible rights doctrine.\nBecause the answer to that question is \"no,\" all\nconvictions in this case must be reversed.\nIt would be well to start by acknowledging\nthat the root difficulty in this case is that this Court\nasked Congress to speak clearly, and Congress did not do\nthat.\nAs a result, there is no solution that is\nreally capable of providing an -- an elegant out to the\nmorass that the lower courts have been confronting, but\nthe choices, essentially, fall on three categories.\nAnd the first is to return the matter to\nCongress, either because the statute is vague in all of\nits applications, both public or private, or as to\nprivate conduct, because there are not enough guideposts\nfor judicial decision-making to give meaning to the\nstatute.\nThe second category of choices --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you don't ask for\nthe first, do you?\nMR. ESTRADA: Yes, we do. I mean, we -- we\nhave -- we have written a question that necessarily has\nthat as a predicate, which, under this Court's cases,\nleave that predicate open to the Court. We have an --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Are -- are you saying that\nunless we adopt the limiting instruction that you\npropose, the statute is then vague?\nMR. ESTRADA: We have argued that. It is\nalso -- you know, just to -- just to finish painting the\npicture, Justice Kennedy, we have -- we have the trunk\nof a tree, and that's -- you know, the statute, is it\nvague or isn't?\nThen we have the question of whether there\nis a limiting construction, and Professor Altshuler, for\nexample, has made a case that limiting the statute to\nbribes and kickbacks is a possibility, as that being,\narguably, the only core conduct that Congress could have\ncontemplated.\nAnd -- and the third one is to go beyond\nbribes and -- and kickbacks, and to expand the statute\nto what Congress likes to call self-dealing or\nnon-disclosure, which is really a wholesale takeover of\nState commercial law.\nIn our view, if the Court is disposed to\nreach that far into the third category, it is essential\nthat the restrictions that had been recognized before\nMcNally be enforced against -- against the government,\nbut we have briefed the case in the way we have to\nthis -- basically assuming that this tree is not\nimaginary and actually exists --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your theory -- your\ntheory that return to the pre-McNally cases would help\nyou is based almost entirely on the D.C. Circuit case --\ncase in Lemire -- Lemire.\nMR. ESTRADA: I think that is not a fair\nstatement, Mr. Chief Justice. I think the D.C.\nCircuit's opinion, of course, is indeed very helpful,\nbut it was a -- a distillation of what other courts of\nappeals have told the government again and again, in\nBallard in the Fifth Circuit, in Feldman in the Seventh,\nin --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The -- the\ngovernment tells us it was an outlier.\nMR. ESTRADA: Well, it had a different view,\nas we have pointed out, when they filed the brief in the\nCarpenter case. But the fact is, whether it is or it\nisn't can be judged by what the contemporaneous cases\nwere.\nAnd Von Barta, Dixon, all cases in the\nSecond Circuit, Feldman in the Seventh, Ballard, all had\nindicated that this was a requirement of the theory in\nintangible rights cases.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, since the -- since the\nbody of pre-McNally lower court cases was hardly\ncompletely consistent, do you think this is a workable\napproach?\nMR. ESTRADA: The honest answer is: I do\nbelieve that the statute is vague in all of its -- all\nof its applications, and I am happy to explain, quickly,\nbecause of that, why that is.\nObviously, there are obvious problems of\nnotice with the statute. The more fundamental problem\nwith the statute, as if the notice problems were not\nenough, is in the second prong of the vagueness\ndoctrine, which is the conferral of discretion to select\nthe defendant on the government, and in particular, the\nprosecutors. And this is a situation not unlike that as\nwas outlined by Justice Breyer's concurring opinion in\nthe Morales case.\nAnd what he pointed out, pointing to cases\nlike Coates v. City of Cincinnati, was that a statute\nthat essentially confers discretion on the -- on the\npolice and the prosecutors to select the quarry and come\nup with that appropriate justification to sell to the\nCourt later --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't know what's so\ndiscretionary and harmful about a bribery or kickback\ncase. Let's take just the limiting principle of the\ntrunk.\nWhether it's in the private or the public\nsector, why would, offering, there be any discretion or\nany sense of vagueness about saying: It's illegal to\ngive a bribery?\nMR. ESTRADA: I --\nJUDGE SOTOMAYOR: To get a contract, to pass\nlegislation, it's illegal to take a kickback. There is\nnothing seemingly vague about that or seemingly\ntroublesome about prosecutorial discretion in those --\nat least those two situations. We could then go to the\nself-dealing question.\nMR. ESTRADA: I absolutely agree with the\nstatements that you made, Justice Sotomayor. It is\nundoubtedly true that a -- that a statute that\nproscribes bribery or kickbacks can constitutionally be\nwritten, if that is what the statute says.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's not your -- it's\nnot within your test, as I understand it. Your test is,\nthere has to be economic harm to the person owed the\nduty of loyalty.\nNow, you could have a bribe or a kickback\nthat will line the pockets of the person who takes it,\ndoesn't deceive the person who is giving it, and doesn't\nharm the company to whom a duty of loyalty is owed.\nSo it seems to me that the bribe and\nkickback, which I think is heartland McNally, would not\nbe included in yours. It must be economic harm, actual\nor contemplated, to the person owed the duty of loyalty.\nMR. ESTRADA: I think that is not a fair\nstatement, Justice Ginsburg, because in our economic\nsystem, I think it is fairly inferable, and any jury\ncould so find that if you are a supply agent for a\ncorporation and you are taking a bribe of $10,000 to\nsteer the contract to Company X, Company X would be more\nthan happy, and it would be a matter of indifference to\nCompany X to just give a 10K break to your employer.\nSo it is inherent in the economic system in\nthe private sector that if you're talking about bribes\nand kickbacks, there is an obvious, though perhaps not\nfully quantifiable, risk of loss to the person to whom\nthe duty is owed.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The problem with the bribe\nor kickback explanation, unlike -- or you contend,\nunlike yours, is that there's no basis in the statute\nfor limiting it to that.\nMR. ESTRADA: I think, Justice Scalia --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, we -- we can't find\na statute that says, \"No person shall commit a bad act.\"\nWe can't find that to be non-vague as applied to murder.\nEverybody knows that murder is a bad act. Would that --\nwould that law be constitutional?\nMR. ESTRADA: No, and that was going to be\nthe second part of my answer to Justice Sotomayor, and\nit is a point that Justice Breyer also made in the\nMorales case, taking -- taking the example of Coates v.\nCity of Cincinnati where the law basically said, \"You\nshall not engage in annoying conduct.\"\nNow, as Justice Breyer pointed out, many of\nus would agree 100 out of 100 that certain things are\ndefinitely annoying. And the fact that you could find,\nfor example, that an assault is annoying does not mean\nthat this statute gives notice that -- that, you know,\nyour conduct is -- is within its written terms --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Let's say you have a\nbank that is going to be opening up a lot of branches in\nthe State, and one of the directors knows this and knows\nwhere they are going to open them. And he goes around\nand buys up the real estate where the bank is going to\nput its -- put its branch, so that he gets the benefit\nof the -- of the sale. And assume that the price that\n-- that he's going to charge is a fair market price, no\ndifferent than what anybody else would charge.\nNow, is that sort of self-dealing covered\nunder your view of the statute?\nMR. ESTRADA: Well, I think that sort of\nself-dealing likely would be covered, not under my view\nof the statute, but under Carpenter, because if you were\nstealing confidential information from your employer,\nand the Court in Carpenter did say that confidential\ninformation is a -- is a form of property as a matter of\nFederal law --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But he is not\nstealing -- he is not stealing the confidential\ninformation. As the director, he has the perfect right\nto know the confidential information.\nMR. ESTRADA: But under either view, if you\nare going to steal the corporate opportunity, that, too,\nis a form of property, and in fact, the property counts\nin this very --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I don't know\nthat I would call it a corporate -- I don't know if I\nwould call it a corporate opportunity. They are not\nlooking to sell the land; they need to buy it.\nMR. ESTRADA: Precisely, but -- but this is\nnot unlike cases like O'Hagan, or even Carpenter itself,\nin which, you know, the value of the use of the\ninformation comes from learning the confidential plans\nof your employer. And in those circumstances, Carpenter\nsaid that the information itself could be a form of\nintangible property.\nAnd so that is a different problem than a\nnative duty violation, which is what we are dealing\nhere.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Just while we are on the\nOeschler thing, and then you'll probably want to go on\nto the other thing.\nAssume this trial were held again. The\ngovernment said: All the same evidence -- same\nevidence. Would that evidence suffice for an\ninstruction to the jury? Could the case go to the jury\nunder the Oeschler theory?\nMR. ESTRADA: Under the obstruction, or -- I\nmean, under the -- under the kickback --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Kickback or bribe.\nMR. ESTRADA: No, it couldn't. I mean, part\nof the point I was going to make is that under any of\nthese choices, whether the statute is vague or\nunapplicable to private conduct, choice one, or whether\nit is a kickback or bribe, choice two, there would not\nbe a case to send to the jury for the defendants in this\ncase.\nThe only argument comes up if you really\nwant to climb to the thinnest reed of the thinnest\nbranch and say that it could extend to naked\nnon-disclosure of confidential information or use of\nconfidential information in violation of a duty imposed\nby contract or State law, or maybe even a consent\ndecree, as in Sorich.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Estrada, let -- let me\npursue the notion I -- I floated earlier, that the\nproblem with Professor Altshuler's approach is that\nthere is nothing in the text of the statute that would\nenable you to limit it to kickbacks and -- and bribes.\nIs there anything in the text of the statute that makes\nyour proposal any better?\nI mean, to be sure, it does -- it does make\nthis a kind of fraud, and in the past, fraud did require\ninjury to somebody. But it defined a new kind of fraud,\nnamely, fraud that consists of the deprivation of honest\nservices. That's the fraud. That, in and of itself,\nunder the text of the statute, I take to be the fraud.\nMR. ESTRADA: Your Honor, I don't think that\nI can give an answer that would be fully satisfactory to\na pure textualist, that this can be taken out of the\nwords of the statute.\nAs a practical matter, however, if you\nconsider the legislative record, and the avowing hint to\nrestore some part of what McNally had thrown out, then a\nharder question comes up, and the issue of what that was\nactually becomes highly relevant. But I do not think\nthat, even under the textualist view, it is fair to say\nthat Congress went in the private sector from a view of\nfraud that is -- that was classically property kind to a\nview of fraud that has nothing to do with property.\nAnd the reason for that takes understanding\nwhat -- what the problem really was that Congress was\ntrying to fix, and that the intangible rights cases were\ntrying to fix. And it's really one of symmetry.\nIt has always been the case that mail fraud\nis a specific intent crime. And it has always been the\ncase, and this is clearly stated in cases like Regent\nOffice Supply and Dixon, from Judge Friendly, that a\npart of the specific intent to defraud is an intent to\nharm. Now, in classic fraud, the defendant intends to\nharm the victim by obtaining, in a corrupt manner, his\nproperty. So there is a perfect symmetry between the\nintended harm to the victim and the expected gain of the\ndefendant, because the gain comes from the victim's\npocket.\nThe problem of bribes and kickbacks that the\nintangible rights cases were trying to deal with is not\nthat they were trying to dispense with the harm's\nrequirement to the victim; they were trying to deal with\nthe lack of symmetry where the person given the payoff\nis not deceived and the harm to the victim is\nnon-quantifiable. And to fix that problem, you could\nsay that this statute could then say that the term of\nart, as the government calls it, that Congress used was\nintended to cover that situation.\nNow, the proof in the pudding on that comes\nfrom a very well-known case. Let's take, you know, the\nHolzer case, which was cited extensively by Justice\nStevens in his dissent in McNally. You may recall it\nwas a State court judge who had been taking bribes, and\nhis conviction was affirmed in an opinion by Judge\nPosner, which he cited in this case again, which\nappears, I think, at 816 F.2d, and it was just a\nstraight intangible rights affirmment. He sought cert,\nyou know, Judge Holzer did, and he got a GVR in light of\nMcNally. And Judge Posner got the case back.\nJudge Holzer goes back and there is a second\nopinion, 840 F.2d, and Judge Posner has to conclude that\nJudge Holzer has to be let go on the mail fraud counts.\nAnd the reason he gives is: Look, the judge obviously\ngot lots of money, but he didn't get the money from\nanybody who was deceived, and all of his victims, which\nwere the public and the litigants against whom the cases\nwere fixed, those people didn't lose any money, so that\nunder the McNally paradigm, because the money that Judge\nHolzer got in bribes did not come from the victims, that\n-- that judge had to be let go.\nAnd I think that that's part of what\nCongress clearly had in mind as was trying to fix.\nNow, I agree with your -- with your apparent\nantecedent view and what I call issue one in the case,\nthat the way that Congress did it has been one of not\ncomplying with the request that this Court made. It did\nnot make anything clear in a way that sets forth in the\ntext what it does.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but\npresumably, the one thing it's odd to suggest Congress\ndid was sort of run 1346 through 1341, when what it was\ntrying to fix was the Court's understanding of what 1341\nprovided.\nMR. ESTRADA: There are any -- there are any\nnumber of problems with how Congress chose to do this,\nMr. Chief Justice. That is actually the tip of the\niceberg, because if you look as a textual matter to the\nfirst words of Section 1346, you will see that this new\namended definition of \"scheme to defraud\" applies to all\nof the offenses in Chapter 63 of Title 18. There are 11\nof those.\nAnd in addition to mail and wire fraud, at\nleast three of them -- bank fraud, securities fraud, and\nhealthcare fraud -- used the phrase \"scheme to defraud.\"\nAnd unless you are prepared to try to save the statute\nby -- by trying to identify a core of what Congress was\ntrying to do that is squarely anchored in the\npre-McNally law, which may or may not be a successful\nenterprise, you do not have any textual guidance that\nwill tell you whether this theory that the government\nlikes to state at a very high level of generality would\nnot become a deus ex machina in a number of other\nstatutes that we have yet to -- to hear from. And that\nis --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What if -- what if I think\nthat even -- I mean, much of your case is directed to\nthe point that you -- you have to narrow it this way to\navoid constitutional problems.\nWhat if I think you don't avoid\nconstitutional problems?\nMR. ESTRADA: Then it --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why should -- why should I\nturn somersaults to -- to come out with the -- with the\ninterpretation that you want?\nMR. ESTRADA: You should not. And in that\nevent, we fully support -- actually, we support anyway\n-- the -- the brief that was filed by the Chamber of\nCommerce and the National Association of Criminal\nDefense Lawyers, for the proposition that as an\nessential matter, this statute cannot be saved.\nI am merely pointing out, Justice Scalia,\nthat for somebody who is not a textualist, that question\nmay not be as clear-cut.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where -- where in\nthe record do we find your argument that the statute is\nunconstitutional?\nMR. ESTRADA: We made it -- we made it in\nthe district court in a motion to dismiss the\nindictment, and I don't believe that is part of the\njoint appendix, but it is Docket Entry 261.\nAnd in that same motion, we argued that this\nstatute, if it were to be applied at all, had to be\ninterpreted solely as a matter of Federal law, which\noddly enough, is the position that the government has\nfinally now taken in the Weyhrauch case. And we argued\nbased on the Jerome case and Cleveland case, which are\nthe cases that the government has finally discovered.\nWe argued again in the court of appeals, and\nwe argued expressly that although the Seventh Circuit\nhad -- had previously indicated that it would uphold the\nconstitutionality of the statute against a vagueness\nchallenge, that Judge Easterbrook, writing for the court\nin Thompson, had left open the possibility that they may\nyet find a case in which that would be revisited. And\nwe expressly argued that this was the case for which\nThompson had left the -- the question open.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Now, what about --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Under the test that you\npropose, is the test the same? Does the statute read\nthe same way, and is the test the same for private and\npublic officials?\nMR. ESTRADA: No. No.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then we -- then if\nwe accept your view, we have to have one subset of\ndefinitions for private officials and another for public\nofficials. It's hard to do that under the statute.\nMR. ESTRADA: That is a problem that is\ninherent, as I said earlier, in trying to do anything to\nsave the statute. But let me say --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, under the judge's\nbribery case that we just -- that you discussed earlier,\ncouldn't you take the position that that money the judge\ntook as a bribe really should have been paid to the\ngovernment?\nMR. ESTRADA: Well, oddly enough, that was\nan argument that was made to Judge Posner and remanded,\nthe Holzer case, and Judge Posner said, Well, that is\nreally untenable.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But that would fit your\ntest, though.\nMR. ESTRADA: Well, yes, in a -- in a very\nformal way. But -- but if I could say just one word on\nthe question of the public v. Private distinction,\nJustice Kennedy, because I think it is important, in\ntrying to figure out how one goes about trying to fix\nwhat is basically a mess, you have to keep in mind that\nthe courts had accepted the intangible rights theory\nbefore McNally, and which Congress presumably and -- or\nlikely was trying to bring back, had -- had not taken\nthe view that they were doing something other than\nfraud.\nBut they have taken the view that there was\na basis in the concept of fraud for distinguishing\nbetween the public and the private, even before McNally.\nAnd some of this -- this is found in the briefing in\nMcNally and is set forth in Justice Stevens's dissenting\nopinion, that there was this other statute, Section 371\nof 18 U.S.C., the conspiracy statute, that uses the\nphrase \"conspiracy to defraud the United States.\"\nAnd on the basis of that statute, before\nMcNally, the courts of appeals have -- have ruled that\nan intent to interfere with the property rights of the\ngovernment was not an element of the core meaning of the\nfraud. And the reason for that was that since 1905, in\na case called Hask v. Henfold, and followed later by a\ncase called Hammerschmidt, this Court had said that in\norder to be convicted of defrauding the government under\nthis other statute, no need -- there was no need to show\nthat the government's property interests were -- were\ninterfered with solely --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, you were --\nI think you were about to tell me where you raised it in\nthe Court -- the constitutional argument in this Court?\nMR. ESTRADA: We -- we raised that as a\npredicate for our question presented. And we said this\nis vague, but -- but if -- but if you do not accept this\nproposed restriction that has been accepted by the -- by\nthe courts of appeals, then you would really have to\ntake the -- take the step of actually striking it down.\nIf you are asking whether we tendered it as\na separate question presented, the answer to that is no,\nMr. Chief Justice, but under this Court's cases that is\nnot needed. And the cases that I would direct the --\nthe Court to for that proposition are -- some of them\nare cited in the Chambers brief. And the first one is\nU.S. v. Grubbs, where this Court said that in a case\ninvolving the technical sufficiency of a search warrant\nit was, of course, open to the Court to consider whether\nthe particular type of warrant, an anticipatory search\nwarrant, was categorically improper under the Fourth\nAmendment. And -- because, as the court explained, it\nwas an antecedent question that was a predicate for a\nlogical disposition of the actual question in front of\nthe Court.\nIn doing that -- that, by the way, was a\nunanimous opinion by Justice Scalia.\nIn doing that, you know, the Court cited to\nthe case of Wilkinson v. Austin, which was another\nunanimous opinion, this time by Justice Kennedy. In\nthat case the issue on which cert had been granted was\nthe -- the question of what process was due to a -- to a\nprisoner in State custody.\nAnd the State of Ohio, that case had\naffirmatively conceded that there was a liberty interest\nand that the suggestion of the United States as amicus\n-- the Court concluded that whether or not there was\neven a liberty interest was an antecedent question and\nwas a logical predicate for -- for the intelligent\nconsideration.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Could you just take a moment\nand explain why any error in the honest services\ninstruction wasn't harmless as applied to the\nForum/Paxton transaction?\nMR. ESTRADA: That's -- that's Count Seven?\nJUSTICE ALITO: Yes.\nMR. ESTRADA: Well --\nJUSTICE ALITO: As I understand it, there\nwas no evidence there that the $600,000 was a -- a\nrecharacterized management fee; isn't that correct?\nMR. ESTRADA: No. The argument on that,\nJustice Alito, was entirely different. The -- the\nrecord does show that the executive committee of\nHollinger and the full board unanimously, including\nevery member of the audit committee, had approved the\nexecution of the noncompetes with Paxton and -- and\nForum. And the only other evidence as to why they were\nnot in fact executed as contemplated by the board\nresolutions was Radler's testimony that Kipnis simply\nforgot.\nNow, significantly, after the jury came back\nand found all three of the defendants guilty on that\ncount, Judge Sansieve entered a judgment of acquittal\nfor Kipnis on Count Seven, finding that the evidence was\ninsufficient as to him. And if there are no further\nquestions, I would like to reserve my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nMr. Dreeben.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. DREEBEN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nThe Petitioner today has sought to present a\nquestion to this Court that he chose not to include in\nhis questions presented, whether the statute is\nunconstitutionally vague in all of its applications.\nWhat he did present in his question\npresented to this Court is whether there is an element\nof contemplated economic harm inherent in the concept of\nfraud in Section 1341, so that any honest services\nprosecution must show contemplated or foreseeable\neconomic harm in order to be sustained.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But I don't -- I don't have\nthe heart to inquire into that question if I think that\nthe whole statute is bad. And that's the point he is\nraising, that it's -- it's a predicate to our\nconsidering that question, that if you agree with him,\nyou think the statute will be sustained.\nBut if I think the whole statute is bad,\nwhat -- you know, why should I engage in -- in this\nexercise?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Scalia --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't make any sense\nto make me do that.\nMR. DREEBEN: Maybe you should wait for a\nPetitioner who presents the question, rather than\ngranting relief to a Petitioner who chose not to raise\nthe constitutional issue in this Court --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it's a little --\nit's a little odd that you -- you would say that an\nargument that shows a way the statute can be saved\ncannot be -- cannot be presented.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, he's saying the\nstatute could be saved, if at all, if you adopt this --\nthis construction. And if you do, his -- his conviction\nmust be set aside.\nMR. DREEBEN: I think that the Court should\nreach that issue, the issue whether there is\ncontemplated economic harm as a requirement for the\nstatute, and the government briefed that issue, and I\ndisagree with Petitioner that contemplated economic harm\nis either an element of the statute or necessary to save\nits constitutionality.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, on the other hand,\nif we just can't find a -- a grounding in the statute\nfor it, then that's because the statute's there.\nMR. DREEBEN: What this statute is, Justice\nKennedy, is Congress's effort to reinstate the body of\nlaw that this Court held was not a valid construction of\nthe mail fraud statute.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Before you -- do you --\ndoes the government feel that it hasn't had an adequate\nopportunity to brief the constitutionality of the\nstatute?\nMR. DREEBEN: If the Court wished to address\nthe constitutionality of the statute, the government\nwould brief it more fully, including by making the\npoints that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Might this come up in the\nSkilling case?\nMR. DREEBEN: The Skilling case raises the\nquestion of whether if this Court does not interpret --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So we have to say, in your\nview -- no, I'm just -- I'm cutting into you because I\ndon't -- you answered it once you said that.\nThe -- the -- what I wonder is, does the\ngovernment feel, in order to have a full opportunity to\nbrief constitutionality, that we should issue an order\nsaying: Please brief the constitutionality?\nMR. DREEBEN: If the Court believes that\nthat is a necessary question to resolve, then it should\nbe briefed in a supplemental passage --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So we should say that?\nMR. DREEBEN: But not in this case, because\nI think if a Petitioner comes to this Court and presents\na particular statutory construction question and then\nseeks to smother in --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That would be --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- does Skilling -- I'm\nsorry.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Go ahead.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Directly answer this\nquestion: Does Skilling present the pure question or\nnot?\nMR. DREEBEN: No, because in Skilling,\nJustice Sotomayor, the question is whether an element of\npersonal or private gain needs to be read into the\nstatute in order to render it constitutional.\nNow, in all fairness to Mr. Skilling, he has\nnot filed his opening brief; the government has not\nfiled its response. So that case --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We don't know if that's\ngoing to be --\nMR. DREEBEN: That case may present a -- a\ndifferent issue. But again, I -- I think that if a\nPetitioner wishes to come to this Court and say that a\nstatute is unconstitutionally vague in all of its\napplications, this is not a statute that offends First\nAmendment rights or anything --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, Mr. Dreeben,\nyou agree that it would be very unusual if in June we\nannounced the opinion in your case agreeing with you and\nthen the next case announced that the statute is\nunconstitutional?\nMR. DREEBEN: Agreed.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. DREEBEN: I would vastly prefer,\nMr. Chief Justice, that the Court hold that it is\nconstitutional. And I think that it should, because --\nlet me outline --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, just -- just so we --\nwe know what is -- what is going on here: It is not the\ncase that the Petitioner here has said here that if we\nadopt his interpretation, it will render the statute\nconstitutional. He doesn't say that.\nHe says that if we adopt his interpretation,\nwe can avoid reaching the constitutional question,\nbecause whether it's constitutional or not, it at least\nrequires the -- the kind of financial harm that -- that\nhe asserts. So he is not asserting that if we -- if we\naccept his position, the statute is constitutional. I\ndon't read his brief as saying that, anyway.\nMR. DREEBEN: That's probably a fair\ncharacterization of language in his brief, but it does\nbear note that he never asked this Court to decide that\nquestion.\nNow, the question that is before the Court,\nand I think it will illuminate the vagueness concerns\nthat are on the Justice's minds, is: What does the\nstatute mean? And the way to understand this statute is\nto recognize that when this Court held in McNally that\nthe mail fraud statute did not protect intangible\nrights, Congress came back in response to this Court's\ninvitation and said: Yes, it does; it protects the\nintangible right of honest services which had assumed\nthe status of a term of art in --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How could it have been a\nterm of art when the courts -- the lower courts were\nmassively confused?\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Ginsburg, I think the\ndescription of the lower courts as massively confused is\nnot correct. It's not a fair description of the cases.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, there wasn't even a\nuniform terminology in the lower courts. They didn't\nall use --\nMR. DREEBEN: All of the lower courts used\nessential synonyms for what Congress sought to\nreinstate. They refer to the right of honest services,\nfaithful and honest services, loyal and honest services,\nand they were talking about one thing: Divided\nloyalties of an agent or a fiduciary.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, as I hear that -- I am\nexaggerating, possibly, but I think every agent has a\nduty of loyalty to provide loyal and honest services to\nthe master, master agent. Every worker is an agent of\nhis master, the employer. So every instance in which a\nworker does not provide honest services to the employer,\nhe has met your test.\nI think there are 300 -- perhaps there are\n150 million workers in the United States. I think\npossibly 140 of them would flunk your test.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, that's what\nworrying me. Now, why? Because -- I -- \"Do you like my\nhat?\" Says the boss. \"Oh, I love your hat,\" says the\nworker.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why? So the boss will\nleave the room so that the worker can continue to read\nthe racing form. Deception? Designed to work at\nreading the racing form instead of doing your honest\nwork and, therefore, violation?\nNow, explain to me how your test does not --\nand I think you can probably do it; I just don't\nunderstand it at the moment. Explain it to me, how your\ntest does not make this statute potentially\ncriminalizing 100 million workers in the United States,\nor some tens of millions?\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Breyer, I hope you\ngive me a moment to explain my theory of the statute in\nresponse to your question. The statute covers bribes,\nkickbacks, and undisclosed conflicts of interest by an\nagent or fiduciary who takes action to further that\ninterest.\nThese were well-recognized categories of\nhonest services violations. Virtually every circuit\nthat examined the pre-McNally case law said these are\nthe prototypical cases. Bribes, kickbacks, undisclosed\nconflicts of interest by an agent or fiduciary who takes\naction to further that interest. These are not --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So is that -- does\nthe right to intangible services refer to an obligation\nthat is legal or moral?\nMR. DREEBEN: Legal, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Only -- only legal?\nSo that if in a State their corporate law says conflicts\nof interest with respect to spouse and children must be\ndisclosed, but conflicts of interest with respect to\nnieces and nephews need not, you would say you cannot\nuse this statute to prosecute somebody who, under some\nabstract sense, should have told their employer that,\n\"My niece is going to get $10 million if we go ahead\nwith this contract\"?\nMR. DREEBEN: Let me make two points in\nresponse to that, Mr. Chief Justice.\nThe obligation under 1346 is a Federal\nobligation. Congress, by reinstating this body of law,\nby virtue of 1346, created a Federal obligation that is\nnot dependent on State law. And I think we will address\nthis more in the Weyhrauch case, where that issue is\nspecifically presented, but it should not be understood\nas a State law obligation.\nSecond, the core --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Then what's the\nsource -- and I think that's inherent in the Chief\nJustice's question -- what is it -- where did he draw\nthe line and where do we go to look to where you draw\nthe line on what information needs to be disclosed?\nBecause if it's not a niece, my best friend is going to\nget a 1.4 million on this deal.\nWhere is the line drawn, and what is the\nsource of the law that we look to to figure out where to\ndraw that line?\nMR. DREEBEN: The line is personal\nconflicting financial interests of the individual, which\n--\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you are talking about\nprivate gain? Do I gain something as opposed to --\nbecause that -- I know that is the Skilling case. But\nif --\nMR. DREEBEN: I prefer not to address the\nSkilling case until that has been briefed.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, but that's -- you\nhave to, because you have to tell us what draws -- you\nhave to give us the source or some source of limiting,\nof limitation. And that's what Justice Breyer has been\ntalking about.\nMR. DREEBEN: I'm trying to do that, Justice\nSotomayor. A personal conflicting financial interest is\nnot subtle, it is ascertainable, it is core, it is the\ncharacterizing feature of the vast majority of --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now this -- I'm just\ngetting a label, and as I hear you talk, I think it's\nnot what you necessarily -- I found in the brief, or\ndidn't understand it from the brief -- but I found\nprecisely what you said, it seems to me in what I have\nlabeled Altshuler alternative B, does that ring a bell?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, I don't know what\nProfessor Altshuler's alternative B was.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, yes. You've read the\nbriefs-- you've read the briefs. He has alternative A\nand alternative B. And alternative A he says kickbacks,\nand it could be limited to bribery or kickbacks. In\nalternative B he adds bribery, kickbacks and undisclosed\nself-dealing capable of causing economic harm. That's\nwhat I got out of the brief.\nMR. DREEBEN: I would not have --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now I just heard what you\nsaid and it sounded like the same thing.\nMR. DREEBEN: It's not the same thing and I\nthink this goes back --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It is not causing economic\nharm.\nMR. DREEBEN: Not causing economic harm\nbecause there are instances where important fiduciary\nrelationships are breached personally. For example,\ndoctor-patient, lawyer-client, union-union\nrepresentative, where the harms are intangible; they are\nnoneconomic; they were intended to be picked up by this\nstatute. But to answer your question directly, Justice\nBreyer --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So what about my racing\nform? He is acting for himself and not his employer.\nMR. DREEBEN: That -- that is -- implicates\na -- one of the two important limiting principles on\nthis statute which is materiality and intent to defraud.\nAnd I do not think that any jury would find and the\ngovernment would be very foolish to prosecute that\nmaterial --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Different matter.\nDifferent matter. The foolish to prosecute, jury\ndefined, worries me for the reason that what's in the\nback of my mind -- and you will see what -- I am\ndisclosing to you what is in the back of my mind.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: When the criminal code was\nreenacted and never was, one kind of joke was that it\nthere it would be -- there would one ball, the law would\nbe read as a crime to do wrong, okay? \"It is a crime to\ndo wrong.\" Sometimes adding, \"in the opinion of the\nAttorney General.\" All right.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now you see the problem?\nIt may be you would never prosecute it. It may be a\njury would never convict. But that isn't the basis for\nhaving a statute that picks up 80 or 100 million people.\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Breyer, the point that\nI was making is that this statute does not establish a\nfree-floating federal crime based on a breach of a\ntrivial duty. It requires materiality, as all fraud\nstatutes do; it requires --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But defined how? That's\nwhat I'm -- I'm trying -- material in what way? Because\nif you don't how by an economic loss to the victim or by\nprivate gain to the -- to the perpetrator, then you are\nleft with what substance to the issue of materiality?\nMR. DREEBEN: The --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What becomes important?\nMR. DREEBEN: The issue of materiality --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That the -- for an\nauditor on April 14th his guy -- or April 1st his\nemployee goes off to a ball game? It could be a huge\neconomic loss to that employer by that employee's\ndecision at that particular moment to go to a baseball\ngame as opposed to working.\nMR. DREEBEN: I agree, Justice Sotomayor,\nbut materiality as the Second Circuit said in the\nRybicki opinion is a time-tested way of separating\nout --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But the Second Circuit\nsaid economic loss --\nMR. DREEBEN: No --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- that there has to be\nthe risk of economic loss --\nMR. DREEBEN: With all respect --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- in the private\nsector.\nMR. DREEBEN: -- Justice Sotomayor, the\nSeventh Circuit in its Rybicki opinion in the en banc\nopinion did not say that, nor I think is it fair to say\nthat the Second Circuit had ever said that economic loss\nwas an element of an intangible rights fraud, either\npre-McNally or post-McNally.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What is -- I mean, I'm\nstill waiting to hear what materiality consists. It is\njust -- de minimus doesn't count? Is that all you mean?\nMR. DREEBEN: Materiality, Justice Scalia,\nit takes the classic definition of your opinions for the\nCourt in Kungis and Gaudin as reasonably likely to\naffect the decision of the body to whom the statement is\nmade.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So if the employee would\nbe fired if defalcation had come to light, that's\nmaterial?\nMR. DREEBEN: If the government proves that\nit would be. And I should add --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: All right, that's the ball\ngame.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Then that's the ball game.\nHypo: you go to the ball game, the government --\nMR. DREEBEN: No, it's not the ball game.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The employer finds out\nabout it, he fires -- so it's material because you would\nbe fired for it.\nMR. DREEBEN: Materiality isn't the only\nelement. It's not a divided loyalties issue.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm asking about just\nmateriality. Just materiality would be satisfied. You\nsaid that if the employer would fire, that is material.\nAnd then we had the ball game hypothetical. Then you\nsaid oh, well, and then some other thing. But we are\ntalking just about materiality so you should stick with\nthat question.\nMR. DREEBEN: I'll -- I agree, Justice\nKennedy, and I intend to answer that question, but I\nthink that it is fair to say, for me that by\nacknowledging that something can be material if the\nemployer would take different action does not mean that\neverything that the employee does is a crime. The\nemployee is not exercising the official powers of his\noffice or job, and that is what was critical.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: He drives to the ball game\nin the government -- in the company car.\nMR. DREEBEN: He is still not exercising the\npowers of his company, he is off on a frolic and detour.\nWhat the pre-McNally cases were looking at were agents\nwho --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Excuse me, may I ask you\nto put -- in terms of your brief, you said your\ndefinition of materiality -- you said materiality is\nrelated to but different from what Mr. Estrada is urging\nthe Court to adopt: economic harm to the victim. So\ncan you tell us how materiality is related to economic\nharm to the victim and how it is different from economic\nharm to the victim?\nMR. DREEBEN: It is related to it, Justice\nGinsburg, in that in a business setting materiality will\nbe in most cases coextensive with economic harm at least\nif economic harm is conceived as I conceive it, and as\nthe cases have conceived of it as extending to things\nlike harm to reputation that will interfere with a\nbusiness's ability to go forward.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But it -- it doesn't answer\nthe racing form case. I mean, you are using materiality\nin two senses. All you mean by materiality is that the\nmisrepresentation must have been material, okay? So in\nthe racing form case, let's say the question the boss\nasked is, you know, \"Are you going to work hard this\nafternoon? Or do I have to stand here and look over\nyour shoulder? \" And he says, \"Boss, I'm going to work\nhard this afternoon. \" \"Okay, then I'll leave.\" And the\nboss leaves. That representation is material in that it\ngot the boss to leave, whereupon he reads the racing\nform.\nBut you know, that's immaterial in another\nsense, it's a -- it's not a substantial crime. And\nthat's -- that's what we are looking for here, something\nthat -- that separates reading the racing form from\nreally harming the employer --\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Scalia --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- to a substantial degree.\nAnd you have nothing in your -- in your brief or in your\nargument that eliminates these de minimus kind of --\nwhat should I say --\nMR. DREEBEN: Fraud.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Misrepresentations to the\nemployer.\nMR. DREEBEN: In -- the first line of\nresponse to this, Justice Scalia, is that these are\nall -- what you are describing are all money or property\nfrauds that could be charged if the government so chose\nso long as the mails or the wires were involved. The\nmail fraud statute doesn't by itself carve out de\nminimus frauds.\nThe concept of materiality, though, in my\nconcept of the divided loyalties that lies at the heart\nof honest services fraud, includes in itself the concept\nof an undisclosed interest that is important in some\nway, because the obligation of the employee, the agent,\nthe fiduciary, the company executive, the politician who\nhas been elected to office, is defined by a bedrock\nsubstratum of fiduciary duties that are universally\nrecognized in the common law, that were --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Dreeben, can I ask\nthis? It seems to me that even if there is some\neconomic harm amounting to the cost of a World Series\nticket, that's all -- or the amount of gas used to drive\nto the ballpark, that could still not meet the\nmateriality requirement.\nMR. DREEBEN: I agree with that, justice\nStevens.\nMR. DREEBEN: There is no bright line rule\njust based on economic harm versus everything else.\nMR. DREEBEN: There is no bright line rule\nin the law of mail fraud in these issues but the scope\nof the duty that has been recognized in the pre-McNally\ncases had to do with the conflicts of interest produced\nby bribes, produced by people who took kickbacks,\nproduced by self-dealing where somebody was selling his\nown product to the company but not disclosing that he\nhad an interest in the company.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That -- that is Altshuler\nB, which I -- that seems to work, but then you want to\ngo beyond that.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And I think in going beyond\nthat is the paradigm case of -- of moonlighting?\nMR. DREEBEN: No, it's not.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, because --\nMR. DREEBEN: There was no pre-McNally case\nthat ever --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no, no, no. I'm trying\nto get -- encapsulate your test in my mind. I'm just\ntrying to find a way, so as I listen to you, I think\nwhat you are driving at -- a paradigm case of what you\nare driving at would be moonlighting.\nMR. DREEBEN: If by moonlighting, Justice\nBreyer, you mean somebody who has a business on the side\nand in dealing with his own company.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes -- no -- yes. He takes\na day -- he leaves an hour early because he is selling\nreal estate.\nMR. DREEBEN: No. That's -- no, no.\nSelf-dealing in the kind that I am talking about is\nwhere somebody has -- he is playing the role of loyal\ncorporate employee, loyal corporate officer, but he is\nactually working for himself by buying from his own\ncompany, without disclosing that to the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You have to have all those\nelements? One -- I mean, everybody is working for the\ncompany. Everybody has loyalty to the company owner.\nAnd, now, you are saying everybody has competing things\nthat they sort of like to do, which would deprive the\nowner of the honest services, but you are saying, in\naddition to that, he has to have his own company?\nMR. DREEBEN: No, Justice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: In addition to that, what?\nMR. DREEBEN: What I -- I'm describing for\nyou are the core cases, so that this Court can put a\ndefinition on honest services fraud that would be\nfamiliar to the lower courts which have had this body of\ncase law ongoing for close to 40 years now and have\nnever encountered the problems that --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But is the problem the\nnondisclosure?\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Or is the problem the --\nthe self-dealing itself, the fact that the person is\nreceiving a gain? There's where I'm trying to draw the\nline because I keep going back to -- what is the source\nof information that would put a limitation on how much\nyou disclose or don't disclose?\nIt has to be -- the issue has to be looked\nat differently, which is the evil is the self-dealing,\nthe gain the person's receiving. I know, you don't want\nme to go there because of Skilling, but I'm troubled\nbecause the issue of disclosure creates a Federal common\nlaw of what's important to tell either the public or a\nprivate employer?\nAnd I don't know how to define that issue of\nimportance --\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, the real --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- other than to say\nthat it's a gain that the individual's receiving or\nsomething the individual's doing.\nMR. DREEBEN: I think that the theory that\nthe government proposes to this Court, which involves\npersonal conflicting financial interests, that the agent\nor fiduciary furthers by taking official action provides\na set of cases that subsumes what you're interested in,\nJustice Sotomayor, and provides guidance to the lower\ncourts and to prosecutors on what can be charged.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What if my son gets the\nmoney? I don't get the money. My son does.\nMR. DREEBEN: Your son, Justice Scalia --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's an adult son.\nMR. DREEBEN: The adult son is not you,\npersonally, no. I don't think that this is the -- the\ncore of the pre-McNally cases involve personal\nconflicting financial interest.\nJUDGE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. You're --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that -- that is how a\nlawyer is supposed to advise his client. He says, well,\nwhat this means is the core of pre-McNally cases.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And he -- and he sends him\noff to read the pre-McNally cases. And I have to tell\nyou, they are a mess, I don't understand them at all.\nIt's one of the reasons McNally came out the way it did.\nIs -- you speak as though it is up to us to\nwrite the statute. We can make it mean whatever it --\nyou know, whatever would -- would save it or whatever we\nthink is a good idea, but that's not our job.\nWhat -- what does the statute say? And, if\nall it does is refer us to the pre-McNally cases, I'm\nat -- I'm at sea.\nMR. DREEBEN: I think that Petitioner and I\nagree that Congress wrote this statute with the use of\nthe phrase \"right of honest services\" as a term of art,\nin order to refer to a body of law that it understood\nhad a consistent core, and that core --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe it was wrong. Just\nbecause it understood it had a consistent core, it has a\nconsistent -- consistent core?\nMR. DREEBEN: No, but it, in fact, did have\none, and the reason that it had one, even though this\nCourt held that the mail fraud statute did not protect\nthe deprivation of intangible rights, there was,\nnonetheless, at the heart of the pre-McNally cases, a\nsubstratum of a universal common law rule of fiduciary\nduties and agency that has, as an undisputed and not at\nall vague core, that agents can't engage in undisclosed\nself-dealing.\nThey can't --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Now, kickbacks and -- and\nbribes is clear. Sometimes, the government just talks\nabout conflict of interest. Sometimes, it says, \"taking\naction under conflict of interest.\" Well, action is\nquite broad.\nAnd that's -- what do you include concretely\nwithin this self-dealing category? Taking or taking\naction on the basis of undisclosed information?\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Ginsburg, it's when\nthe same person is on two sides of the transaction, so\nyou have in, for example, this case, Mr. Black is going\nto receive compensation from his company, and on behalf\nof the company, he is authorizing and entering into\nalleged noncompetition agreements that recharacterize\nthe money or, in a case of Count 7, I think Justice\nAlito is absolutely correct, outright steal the money.\nHe --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, could I\nask -- could I ask you just, in terms -- the terms of\nthe statute, does your theory give any independent\nsubstance to the word \"right\"?\nIt seems, to me, your argument is that --\nthat someone who deprives another of honest services. I\ndon't know where the concept of \"right\" comes in, which\nis in the statute.\nMR. DREEBEN: The right refers,\nMr. Chief Justice, to the acknowledgment that there was\na common law fiduciary duty that was assimilated into\nthe law of fraud, really, beyond dispute. I haven't\nunderstood --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the point -- I\nguess maybe this is -- maybe I asked you this before.\nThe -- the right is not limited to specific legal\nobligations, but to a developing Federal common law of\ncriminal liability?\nMR. DREEBEN: No, it certainly is not,\nMr. Chief Justice. Congress intended to basically say\nto this Court, you have determined that intangible\nrights are not protected under the mail fraud statute.\nOnly money or property is.\nCongress desired to correct the statute by\nprotecting frauds that involve intangible rights, and it\ndid that by using a term of art that was replete\nthroughout the legislative debates, for those who read\nthem, as referring to the same core body of cases that\nwe rely on here.\nAnd those cases -- any -- any legal rule\nwill have cases at the margins, in which reasonable\njurists will debate whether --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Dreeben, I should know\nthis, but refresh my memory. The body of pre-McNally\ncourt of appeals cases, to what extent were they just\npublic rights versus private? Was there a substantial\nbody?\nMR. DREEBEN: There was a larger body of\npublic sector cases. There was a very substantial body\nof private sector cases, many of which were cited in\nYour Honor's dissent in the McNally case.\nAnd those cases, I think, as Mr. -- the\nChief Justice indicated earlier, contained, but a single\nopinion, the Lemire opinion from the D.C. circuit, that\ntalked about contemplated economic harm.\nPetitioner seeks to assimilate that,\nsomehow, into the notion of an intent to defraud that he\nsays was inherent in the mail fraud statute everywhere\nand always before McNally.\nBut if he seriously believes in that theory,\nthen he would have to say that a -- an intangible rights\ndefendant would have to contemplate economic harm,\nforesee economic harm in any intangible rights case,\nwhich would knock out, immediately, many of the critical\npre-McNally public official cases, in which a legislator\ntakes a bribe for action that doesn't implicate the\npecuniary interests of the holder or the fiduciary duty\nor in which a union official accepts payment for someone\nwho wants to apply for membership. Membership fees are\nfixed. It's not as if the union is losing money.\nAnd it's really inconceivable that Congress\nwould have passed a statute to say, we don't want this\nlaw to be limited to property rights. And somehow,\nthrough the back door, smuggle in the same test of\ncontemplated economic harm.\nWhat the right way to handle this issue\nis -- is to look at it under the rubric of materiality\nbecause materiality is flexible. It considers what the\nrights are of the particular fiduciary --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I thought materiality just\nhas to do with whether a false statement you make, in\nfact, causes the effect, or is likely to, that is the\nharmful effect.\nMR. DREEBEN: But the point, Justice Breyer,\nis --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's always there.\nMR. DREEBEN: -- that materiality would\nfunction much like the Petitioner's contemplated\neconomic harm requirement in private sector, private\nenterprise cases.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, and the -- and the\nreason I say with -- maybe I have the example that I\nmean now. In the cases you just mention, the bribe\ncase? Right, the legislature is not going to gain. The\nlegislator or the briber might, but somebody will.\nAnd the object of those bribes was that\nthere would be economic gain, and that was what -- when\nI went through all those McNally cases, I thought I\ncould fit them into this alternative Altshuler thing,\nbut now, you -- you worry me that you have a different\ntest that will bring in like any failure to fill out a\ndisclosure form.\nA deliberate failure to answer a box, one\nout of 1,000, for every government employee, would\nimmediately -- 20 years in jail.\nMR. DREEBEN: No, not immediately, because\nthere needs to be an intent to defraud, which\nincludes -- Mr. Chief Justice, if I might finish.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure.\nMR. DREEBEN: -- which includes knowledge of\nthe legal duty that the employee is violating and will\ninclude materiality. And these are the issues that\nscreen conflicts and prosecutions in a variety of public\ncorruption type cases, and across the board economic\nharm requirement, which I understood today Petitioner to\ndisavow would devastate the application statute in its\ncore areas of public corruption cases.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Dreeben.\nMr. Estrada, you have three minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MIGUEL A. ESTRADA\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. ESTRADA: Just a few points,\nMr. Chief Justice. First, it bear emphasis that the\ngovernment has once again said that this is a federal\nobligation.\nThis entire case was tried based on Talmudic\ndebates of the ins and outs of Section 144 of the\nDelaware law of corporations. We had motions to\ndismiss, we had briefing. The jury was given detailed\ninstructions, and this goes to all of the fraud counts,\nJustice Alito. You cannot say that you can uphold\nsomething as harmless when the entire theory on which\nthe case was tried actually has been changed at the\nSupreme Court of the United States.\nRelatedly, I would like to add, because the\ngovernment said that count seven was a theft, that the\ngovernment's theory on count seven was that the\nnoncompetes were frauds from their inception, because\nthe reps from Paxton and Forum, none was wanted. And in\nfact, other counts that charged Forum and Paxton, two\nand three, you know, the jury returned a verdict of\nacquittal. And as did Judge Sansieve on Kipnis on\nseven.\nAnd that makes it highly likely that -- that\nthe jury convicted based on the government 's argument,\nthat even though every single member of the audit\ncommittee approved the noncompetes as a member of the\nboard, that Delaware law required a separate and prior\napplication to the audit committee.\nAnd if that's what the jury was told, you\ncannot really say that count seven is separate.\nSecond --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Where was that in the\ncharge?\nMR. ESTRADA: Excuse me, Your Honor?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The charge -- the judge\ncharged the jury in terms of Delaware law?\nMR. ESTRADA: Yes, yes, Your Honor. The\njury was told -- let me find that, I think it's around\npage 336.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: 336.\nMR. ESTRADA: Yeah, 336 and 337, and the\njury was given detailed instructions as to how all this\nturned on whether the transactions at issue were, quote,\nentirely fair under Delaware law.\nAnd the jury was further told --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But it said honest\nservices include fiduciary duties under corporate.\nMR. ESTRADA: Correct. And then you then\nwent to say that -- that, you know, Delaware was\ncontrolling -- this is the middle of page 336 A -- under\nDelaware law, a corporation's officers have these\nduties, one of them is loyalty. Loyalty requires this\nand such under Delaware law.\nOne of the things that -- that would allow\nthe jury to convict was the notion that the government\nin entirely just has odds for understandable reasons,\nbut this was not entirely fair. And a transaction could\nfail to be entirely fair if every disclosure that should\nhave been made in accordance with Delaware law was not\nmade.\nOn the second point that I wanted to make is\nthe question of whether we are really embarking on the\nfederal common law of materiality.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- I know you are\nrunning out of time, but you are speaking so fast I\ncan't even follow you anymore.\nMR. ESTRADA: I apologize, Your Honor.\nThe second question I wanted to address is a\nquestion that you raised, Justice Sotomayor, it is false\nto say that the materiality is a filter. Criminal law,\njust as a question of doctrine, has always looked at the\nmens rea, as the filter that takes out the culpable from\nthe nonculpable. In this case, you know, the so-called\nfilter is elusory. If you have a money or property\ncase -- Your Honor, may I finish?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Finish your thought.\nMR. ESTRADA: -- you know what the decision\nis that you are supposing to induce, whether you --\nwhether the person would part with the money. Here the\nbut-for world, was the decision that the employer might\nmake, do I dock his pay; do I give him a demotion; do I\nfire him for all purposes, or do I simply say, that I\nwould not have authorized him to be absent at all for\nthe ball game. None of those things is specified, and\nthe entire test of the filter is as vague as the\nstatute.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nThe case submitted.\n(Whereupon, at 11:18 a.m., the case
