        "content": "[11:01 a.m.]\nJUSTICE STEVENS: We'll hear argument in number\n05-184, Hamdan against Rumsfeld.\nMr. Katyal, you may proceed.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL KATYAL\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. KATYAL: Justice Stevens, and may it please\nthe Court:\nWe ask this Court to preserve the status quo to\nrequire that the President respect time-honored\nlimitations on military commissions. These limits, placed\nin articles 21 and 36 of the Uniform Code of Military\nJustice, require no more than that the President try\noffenses that are, indeed, war crimes and to conduct\ntrials according to the minimal procedural requirements of\nthe UCMJ and the laws of war themselves. These limits do\nnot represent any change in the way military commissions\nhave historically operated. Rather, they reflect\nCongress's authority under the Define and Punish Clause to\ncodify limits on commissions, limits that this Court has\nhistorically enforced to avoid presidential blank checks.\nAnd because this commission transgresses those limits, it\nshould be struck down and the district court order\nreinstated.\nIf I could turn to the jurisdictional matter for\na few moments first. We believe that the DTA, while\ncertainly not a model of clarity, does not divest this\nCourt of jurisdiction, for four essential reasons. The\nfirst is that, if I could turn to the surreply at page --\nthe appendix at page 14(a), that contains the initial\nversion of the bill that passed the Senate on November\n10th. And at 14(a) it says, on the effective-date\nprovision, \"The amendment made by paragraph 1,\" which is\nthe jurisdiction-stripping provision, \"shall apply to any\napplication or other action that is pending on or after\nthe date of enactment of this act.\" That language clearly\nattempted to strip courts of jurisdiction over Guantanamo\nclaims. That language, however, was changed in the final\nversion of the DTA, and the final version of the DTA is\nfound at page 10(a) of the surreply. And that has the\nfollowing as its effective date. It has two effective-\ndate provisions.\nThe first one I want to start with is H(2),\nreview of combatant status tribunal, CSRT, and military\ncommission decisions, \"Paragraphs 2 and 3 of subsection\n(e) shall apply with respect to any claim whose review is\ngoverned by one of such paragraphs and that is pending on\nor after the date of enactment of the Act.\" And then,\nthere is a separate provision for the rest of the DTA, for\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where was that change made from\nthe prior version?\nMR. KATYAL: The change was made between\nNovember 10th and November 15th.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but, I mean, what -- it\nwas made in what house? Was it made by the conference\ncommittee?\nMR. KATYAL: It was made in the Senate.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It was made in the Senate. So\nthe House presumably never saw the prior --\nMR. KATYAL: That --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- language.\nMR. KATYAL: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And the President, who signed\nthis bill, never saw the prior language.\nMR. KATYAL: That is correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, why should we attribute to\nboth the House and to the President a knowledge of the\nprior version of the legislation?\nMR. KATYAL: Well, because the language itself\nwas, I think, the subject of an immense amount of debate.\nAnd, indeed, when the language was --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In the Senate.\nMR. KATYAL: In the Senate. And well-known.\nAnd, indeed, you don't have to attribute any knowledge to\nthe President. We have evidence in the record that the\nadministration tried to change the language back to the\noriginal formulation. And, indeed, in the House, the\nchairman of one of the -- the vice chairman of the\nConference Report said that the change in the language was\nin -- was -- the change in the language meant that it\ngrandfathered pending cases such as this one. So, this is\nnot an example of which we have to resort simply to the\nnegative inference of Lindh. However, we do think that is\nthe second reason for you to believe that this case is\ngrandfathered under the existing DTA.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But isn't that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What, in addition to this\ncase -- I mean, this case is pending in the U.S. Supreme\nCourt. There are many cases pending in the district court\nwhen this law comes into effect. What about those cases?\nMR. KATYAL: We believe that, as the cosponsor\nsaid, on November 15th when they introduce the final\nversion of the language, that all of those cases are\ngrandfathered with respect to the H(1) effective-date\nprovision and the E(1) jurisdiction-stripping provision.\nHowever, that still leaves in place the Government's main\nargument in the D.C. Circuit below, which is that the E(2)\nprovision governing CSRT and final decisions, and the H(2)\nprovision governing final decisions of military-- final\ndecisions of CSRTs, truncates all of the review that is\ncurrently in the D.C. Circuit. So, it's certainly plausible\n-- it's certainly possible, though it's not, of course,\npresented in this case, to read the DTA as truncating the vast\nmajority of claims at Guantanamo in current pending cases.\nOf course, that isn't the issue before you here.\nThe issue before you here is simply the Hamdan case, and\nthere was -- and there was a strong -- the strong desire\nby the Congress not to interfere with this Court's\ntraditionally exercised jurisdiction.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Please go over that again. I'm\nnot -- I'm not sure I understood -- I understood your\nresponse.\nMR. KATYAL: Okay.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You say that it could be read\nto preclude cases in the lower courts, but not here.\nMR. KATYAL: That's right, cases in which there\nis a final CSRT decision; that is, that the Government's\nargument in the D.C. Circuit, Justice Scalia, is that\nthere are two different ways in which the DTA truncated\nthe review of Guantanamo cases. One is the claim that the\njurisdiction-stripping provision applies to pending cases.\nThat, we reject. That, we think the Senate rejected on\nNovember 15th when it passed the bill. The other is the\nclaim that the E(2) provision governing final decisions of\nCSRTs, which does, of course, apply to pending cases, as\nthe plain text says, eliminates and truncates a vast --\nmajority of the detainees' claims.\nThat is the provision --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Does that mean, in practical\nterms, that the -- that the -- that the other claims that\nare in the district court get transferred to the circuit,\nthe circuit is bound by the limitations that you've just\ndescribed, and, at the end of the day, the complaining\nparties in those cases can raise the question whether they\n-- whether Congress could properly have truncated them, as\nit did, but it's simply got to wait?\nMR. KATYAL: Absolutely. And --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. KATYAL: -- to be clear, that's not the\nposition we're saying that is the DTA. That's not\npresented here.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I realize --\nMR. KATYAL: That's the issue --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nMR. KATYAL: -- below, in the D.C. Circuit.\nIn addition, we believe that this statute\ndoesn't fall within the Bruner Hallowell presumption that\nthe Government seeks to -- seeks to use here, for a few\nreasons. The first is, this is not a statute that is\nmerely divesting a lower court of jurisdiction. Rather,\nit's a statute that alters substantive rights of Mr.\nHamdan. In particular, as the Government itself says, it\neliminates question 2, upon which certiorari was granted,\nwhich is compliance with the Geneva Conventions. In\naddition, it alters entirely what both courts below found,\nwhich is that Mr. Hamdan has a pretrial right, a right\nanalogous to Abney versus United States, to bring his\nclaim now, because he's challenging the jurisdiction of\nthe tribunal. That pretrial right is something that\nmirrors -- that goes all the way back to the founding, in\nthe early cases that this Court decided, on pretrial\nhabeas.\nIn addition, we believe that --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why does it -- why does it\naffect the scope of the review that he could get\neventually? If there's a final decision, there can be\nreview of whether the use of the standards or procedures\nthat were used by the commission to reach a final decision\nis consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United\nStates? Why doesn't that encompass any claim that he\nmight want to make later on?\nMR. KATYAL: Well, as the Government says, it\ndoes -- certainly does not encompass question 2, because\nit eliminates the word \"treaties.\" It's a change from the\nhabeas corpus statute. More generally, it doesn't do two\nthings. First, if that's the reading that the Government\nwants to give, well, then it essentially means that the --\nthat the President has the ability to block habeas corpus\nor post-DTA review for all time, because, Justice Alito,\nit doesn't turn on -- you can't walk into court right\nafter you're convicted, under the DTA; you can only walk\ninto court after a final decision. And a final decision\nrequires the sign-off of the President of the United\nStates. And so, effectively, this reading would give a\nlitigant the ability to block Federal Court review for all\ntime.\nJUSTICE ALITO: I mean, criminal litigation\nreview after the final decision is the general rule.\nThere generally is not any interlocutory -- any\ninterlocutory appeal. And what you say could happen in\nany criminal case if you assume bad faith on the part of\nthe people who are responsible for making the decisions\nalong the way. They could delay indefinitely and postpone\nthe entry of a final decision.\nMR. KATYAL: Justice Scalia -- Justice Alito, if\nthis were a final -- if this were like a criminal\nproceeding, we wouldn't be here. The whole point of this\nis to say we're challenging the lawfulness of the tribunal\nitself. This isn't a challenge to some decision that a\ncourt makes. This is a challenge to the court itself.\nAnd that's why it's different than the ordinary criminal\ncontext that you're positing. The ordinary criminal\ncontext you're positing -- and I'm thinking of a case like\nSchlesinger versus Councilman, a court-martial case --\nwhat the Court has said is that it's the -- the predicate\nfor abstention is the idea that Congress has fairly\nbalanced the rights of both sides, an independent branch,\nand has -- and has made certain determinations. Here,\nnone of that has happened. It's all been made by the\nexecutive. And the difference is crucial in military\njustice, because, as Justice Kennedy said for the Court in\nLoving, the framers harbored a deep distrust of military\ntribunals. And the thing that makes it different than the\nordinary criminal context, the thing that, as this Court\nsaid, stops military justice from being lawless is the\nCongress of the United States setting clear limits on the\nuse of military justice.\nNow, if those limits had been observed, if this\nCourt -- if the military commission complied with the\nrules of courts-martial, we wouldn't be here. Our whole\npoint is that they don't, and that it falls outside of the\nwell-recognized abstention exception for courts-martial\ncases.\nIn addition, we believe that to further -- to\nfurther on -- Justice Alito, on your point -- this Court\nhas already said in the military commission context that a\ndifferent rule applies. In Quirin, this Court rushed in\nto hear a military-commission challenge before the\ncommission was over, and the reason why it did so was, it\nsaid that the public interest required adjudication of\nthese issues. And the public interest is no less severe\nin that case than it is here. That is, this is a military\ncommission that is literally unbounded by the laws,\nConstitution, and treaties of the United States. And if\nyou adopt the Government's position here, it effectively\nreplicates the blank check that this Court rejected in\nHamdi.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Could I come back to Justice\nAlito's question as to what the normal procedure would be\nin criminal cases? Suppose you're -- you have a challenge\nto the makeup of the tribunal in a criminal case. Is it\n-- is it the normal practice that you would get to raise\nthat challenge? Let's say one of the judges is\ndisqualified for some other reason. Can you normally\nraise that challenge before the criminal case is filed?\nMR. KATYAL: I don't believe so.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, there would be nothing\ndifferent in this situation, if you couldn't raise it\nuntil it was final.\nMR. KATYAL: Justice Scalia, everything is\ndifferent about this. That is, in your posited\nhypothetical, there is some law that you know will govern\nthat ultimate question about disqualification or whatever\nthe --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, I know --\nMR. KATYAL: -- the matter is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- the merits of the\nissue. I'm just talking about the timing of the issue.\nMR. KATYAL: Well, I do think that there's an\nintegral relationship to the -- between the two. That is,\nthat the predicate for abstention has always been that\nCongress, or some other entity, has fairly balanced the\nrights of both sides. Here, you don't have that\nfundamental guarantee. Indeed, if you adopt the\nGovernment's reading here, the -- they have said that they\nwant to try 75 military-commission cases or so in the\nfirst wave. You will then be left with 75 trials that\ntake place without even the most basic question of what\nthe parameters are that these commissions are to operate\nunder.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, when you say Congress\nhasn't fairly balanced it, I mean, I guess that depends\nupon your reading of the statute. If, indeed, you read it\nthe way the Government reads it, they would assert that\nCongress did consider these military commissions and\nthought that it was okay to wait until they had completed\ntheir work before full review was provided.\nMR. KATYAL: But --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, it's sort of a -- you\nknow, a -- you're running in a circle.\nMR. KATYAL: Well, that's precisely, Justice\nScalia, our argument, that I don't think one can consider\nthe abstention claim -- and this is what I believe both\ncourts below had held -- you can't consider the\nabstention claim without deciding the underlying merits.\nAnd if you believe that the -- that Congress has fairly\nbalanced the rights and are compliant with the UCMJ and\nthe like, then I don't think -- then you're reaching the\nmerits, and there's no abstention holding.\nSo, if I could turn to the merits -- the merits\nchallenges. The first thing I'd like to discuss on -- is\nquestion number 1 and whether this military commission\nstates a charge that violates the laws of war. And we\nbelieve it doesn't, for two essential reasons.\nFirst, the only charge in this case is one of\nconspiracy. And conspiracy has been rejected as a\nviolation of the laws of war for -- in every tribunal to\nconsider the issue since World War II. It has been\nrejected in Nuremberg, it's been rejected in the Tokyo\ntribunals, it's been rejected in the international\ntribunals for Rwanda and Yugoslavia, and, most\nimportantly, it's been rejected by the Congress of the\nUnited States, in 1997 --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Katyal, will you help me?\nWhere is the conspiracy charge in the papers?\nMR. KATYAL: The charge itself, Justice Stevens,\nis found at 63(a) of the Petition appendix.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Okay, thank you very much.\nMR. KATYAL: Sure. And --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And suppose you had a tribunal\nthat was properly constituted, as you contend that it\nought to be, and then the charge was conspiracy. Would\nthe -- would the courts then have review before the trial\nproceeded? And let's assume that it's a conspiracy and\nsome other charge. Is there some analog in ordinary\ncriminal proceedings where you challenge, in advance, the\nvalidity of the charge?\nMR. KATYAL: Ordinarily, Justice Kennedy, the\nanswer would be no, you wouldn't challenge the validity of\nthe charge. And, indeed, I think Councilman itself is a\n-- is a case in which there was a charge at issue, and the\nquestion was subject-matter jurisdiction.\nThe reason why this is different, however, is\ntwofold. First, the claim that Mr. Hamdan is making is\nthat conspiracy itself falls entirely out of any\nauthorization of Congress. In Councilman, the question\nwas -- there was an article, article 134 of the UCMJ,\nwhich was a criminal statute, and it had been interpreted\nto punish drug dealing. And in the case the court said\nwhere -- this Court said, \"We will defer as to whether the\nfacts showed the requisite amount of drug dealing to\nviolate the Uniform Code.\"\nHere, by contrast, Mr. Hamdan's claim is that\nthe conspiracy charge falls entirely outside of the laws\nof war as a whole.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Could the tribunal interpret\nthe conspiracy charge to mean joint enterprise, which\nwould be closer, at least, to accepted practice in the\ninternational tribunals?\nMR. KATYAL: The charge itself is one of\nconspiracy. Joint enterprise is, itself, not an\nindependent charge in international tribunals; so you can\ncharge, for example, murder. And your theory, in an\ninternational tribunal, of how you get to murder is joint\ncriminal enterprise. But you'd have to charge the\nunderlying violation, itself. Here --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm still not sure why, if we\nthink that there is merit to your argument that the\ntribunal is not properly established anyway, that you --\nwe have to reach the conspiracy charge.\nMR. KATYAL: If you --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And if we -- and if we think\nthat you're wrong on that, I don't know why that court\ncan't hear the conspiracy argument.\nMR. KATYAL: Well, there's two different\nreasons. The tribunal is not authorized, and that the\ncharge doesn't state a violation. Now, even if we assume\nthat the tribunal is authorized and that all of its\nmicroprocedures are authorized under the act of Congress,\nthis -- allowing this charge, conspiracy, is to open the\nfloodgates to give the President the ability to charge\nwhatever he wants --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that's --\nMR. KATYAL: -- in a military commission.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Katyal, I mean, that's a\ngood argument for -- from a broad policy, but isn't there\na narrower reason? If we assume that the -- that the\ncommission is properly established for some purpose, by\ndefinition that purpose is limited. We are not dealing\nhere, as we would in the normal criminal case, with a\ncourt of general jurisdiction. If we're dealing with a\ncourt of general jurisdiction, we postpone claims like\nyours til the end, because we say the jurisdiction is so\nbroad, they probably had it. Maybe not, but we can wait.\nBut in a -- in a -- in a court of limited jurisdiction,\nor a commission of limited jurisdiction, we can't indulge\nthat presumption. And that's why, I thought, your claim\nthat conspiracy is not cognizable can be raised at the\nbeginning, because it's inseparable from the limited\njurisdiction of the court. Am I off in left field?\nMR. KATYAL: You are --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Or do you like that answer.\nMR. KATYAL: -- absolutely correct, Justice --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. KATYAL: -- Souter. And, indeed, I would\nadd to that that the conspiracy charge here, Justice\nKennedy, is -- the problem with it is compounded by the\nfact that the tribunal itself is charging a violation of\nthe laws of war, when the military commission has never\noperated to try violations of terrorism in stateless,\nterritoryless conflicts. That is, it's not just the\ncharge, but it's where the charge operates that we find so\ncentral, that the -- that there are two different things --\nJUSTICE ALITO: But is it clear that the --\nMR. KATYAL: -- there's two different problems.\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- charges against your client\ncould not be amended?\nMR. KATYAL: They may be amended, yes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Then why should we -- why should\nthere be review, before trial, of a charge that could be\namended?\nMR. KATYAL: Be- --\nJUSTICE ALITO: There could be additional\ncharges added by the time there's a final decision.\nMR. KATYAL: And the -- Justice Alito, the\nGovernment has had, essentially, now 4 years to get their\ncharges together on Mr. Hamdan. At this point, that --\nyou know, what you have before you is the charge. And\nthat -- and they've stuck with this charge, of conspiracy,\nwhich is not a violation of the laws of war. And, indeed,\nthe -- and the -- it's not just conspiracy isn't, but that\nthe commission is operating in totally uncharted waters,\nbecause it's charging a violation in a stateless,\nterritoryless conflict, something as to which the full\nlaws of war have never applied.\nIndeed, Justice Alito, all 10 people facing\nmilitary commissions today, all 10 indictments charge\nconspiracy right now. Seven only charge conspiracy.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Isn't this contrary to the way\nlegal proceedings and appeals are normally handled? You\nhave a -- essentially, a pretrial appeal concerning the\nvalidity of a charge that may not even be the final charge.\nMR. KATYAL: Not in -- not here, because, as, I\nthink, both courts below indicated, this case, and his\nchallenge, falls very much like Abney versus United\nStates. This is a challenge to the lawfulness of the\nunderlying tribunal and the charge that's against him.\nIndeed, this Court, in Quirin, heard, as its first\nquestion, Does the charge state a violation of the laws of\nwar? That was the first thing it said had to be asked.\nSo, I think the -- what we are doing is applying\nnothing more than the settled practice that has always\nbeen the case with respect to military commissions. And\nit -- in -- the public interest here, again, just as in\nQuirin, I think, requires some limits placed on military\ncommissions, Justice Alito, because, otherwise, if the\nGovernment's position is taken as the final word, it'll\ngive the President the ability to essentially create that\nblank check, for years on end, render a final decision at\nsome point, and then that final decision will then be\nsubject to the truncated review procedures in the DTA,\nwhich I don't think is what Congress intended when they\nchanged the language of the bill. Rather, I think what\nthey did was intend that this Court would decide the basic\n-- apply the basic structural limits on military\ncommissions that have always applied.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question about\nthe charge? The charge is not just conspiracy in the\nabstract, it's conspiracy to do specific things, one of\nwhich is attacking civilians and civilian objects. And is\nit clear that the commission would not have -- a military\ncommission would not have jurisdiction to try a conspiracy\nto armed civilians in a war zone, for example?\nMR. KATYAL: It is clear, Justice Stevens. That\nis -- that is precisely what the international tribunals\nreject. Conspiracy is a standalone offense. One can\ncharge, as a war crime, attacking civilians and the like,\nas a pure crime, but what you can't do is charge\nconspiracy. And, indeed, the Congress of the United\nStates, in 1997, when they wrote the War Crimes Act,\nessentially made that conclusion, because they defined\n\"war crimes\" with incorporating a variety of treaties --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose that proof were\nto show that there was very substantial and knowing\ninvolvement rendering him basically an accomplice or a\nprincipal, but it was -- it was still found under\nconspiracy. Would international law violate that?\nMR. KATYAL: If the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Assume that he's been given\nnotice of -- during the -- during the course of the\nproceedings as to what the charges specifically are as the\nproof is adduced.\nMR. KATYAL: Justice Kennedy, on this particular\npoint, on conspiracy, yes, if -- that you couldn't charge\nsome other offense, like aiding and abetting, and\ntransmute some conspiracy charge into that. Rather, the\ninternational law and the laws of the United States\nrecognize you can prosecute him for aiding and abetting as\na violation of whatever the specific underlying crime is,\nlike murder or attacking civilians. What you can't do is\nuse the standalone offense of conspiracy. And here's why.\nBecause the standalone offense of conspiracy is rejected\nby international law, because it's too vague. And this\nCourt has said that the test for a violation of the laws\nof war is when universal agreement and practice make it a\nviolation. The world rejects conspiracy, because if it's\nadopted it allows so many individuals to get swept up\nwithin its net.\nJustice Kennedy, aiding and abetting requires\na much closer relationship between the conduct and the\nindividual offender. Conspiracy does not. And so, for\nexample, under the Government's theory, a little old lady\nin Switzerland who donates money to al Qaeda, and that\nturns out to be a front for terrorist acts and so on,\nmight be swept up within this broad definition of\nconspiracy. And that's why international law has so\nrejected the concept of conspiracy.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, that wouldn't be --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, let me put it this way.\nIf we were to find that the Geneva Convention or other\nsettled principles of international law were controlling\nhere, why couldn't we just remand to the D.C. Circuit and\nlet it figure that out? Or let it -- have the tribunal\nfigure it out, in the first instance, assuming the\ntribunal is properly authorized.\nMR. KATYAL: Well, it is the role of this Court\nto confine the tribunal to its lawful jurisdiction.\nThat's what this Court held in Quirin. And that's what we\nthink you should do here. The tribunal itself can't be\nthe judge of its own jurisdiction.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose we told the D.C.\nCircuit that the Geneva Convention or some other body of\ninternational law controls, and just remand it for it\nto go into all these arguments?\nMR. KATYAL: Again, we think, at this point,\nthat the public interest is best served by this Court\nsaying that conspiracy doesn't violate -- to set some\nlimits. After all, all -- everyone facing a military\ncommission is facing this charge. Seven are only facing\nthis charge. The Government wants to put 75 of these\ncases through. And it has taken 4 and a half years since\nthe President's military order --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask --\nMR. KATYAL: -- for this case --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- this question? Supposing\nthe charge had been slightly amended. Instead of saying,\n\"The criminal purpose, and conspired and agreed with Osama\nbin Laden to commit the following offenses,\" it said, \"It\nand Osama bin Laden attempted to -- aided and abetted in\ncommitting the following offenses.\" Would it then be --\nviolate the laws of war?\nMR. KATYAL: If the charge is the specific\noffenses themselves, not aiding and abetting, Justice\nStevens --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, the specific offenses\nare attacking civilians and attacking civilian objects.\nMR. KATYAL: Yes, with respect to this\nparticular claim about conspiracy, that would solve that\nproblem. If you say the charge is attacking civilians,\nand your theory of proving it is aiding and abetting the\nmurder or the attacking of civilians --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And then --\nMR. KATYAL: -- yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- what if the trial judge who\nlooked at the indictment or ruling on a motion to dismiss\nthe indictment, or its equivalent at this time -- said,\n\"Well, I'm going to construe these words 'conspired or\nagreed' as the substantial equivalent of 'aiding and\nabetting.'\" Would that let the charge stand?\nMR. KATYAL: That would mix apples and oranges,\nbecause \"conspiracy\" and \"aiding and abetting\" are two\nentirely different things. One is a standalone offense.\nAnd one is a theory of how to prove a violation --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But the language is \"conspired\nand agreed with.\" And \"agreed with\" is pretty close to\n\"tried to do it himself.\"\nMR. KATYAL: It's not, Justice Stevens, because\nit requires a different level of participation, and the\nliability is entirely different. Because if conspiracy is\naccepted, you're accepting Pinkerton liability. That's\nwhat the Government's own charge said -- the Government's\nown instruction said, which means that Mr. Hamdan is\nliable for all the acts of 9/11 and everything al Qaeda\nhas done. \"Aiding and abetting,\" as you are saying,\nJustice Stevens, in your hypothetical, is a much more\nclosely tethered theory of liability, requiring a higher\nlevel of individual culpability and a totally different\nlevel of punishment.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: As I recall the Sixth\nAmendment, you're entitled to know the charge against you.\nAnd you're saying that the charge of conspiracy is not\nthe charge of aiding and abetting.\nMR. KATYAL: That is correct.\nIf I could turn to a second argument for why we\nbelieve this military commission is impermissible, and\nthat is that it defies the Uniform Code of Military\nJustice. The Uniform Code of Military Justice, in article\n36, sets minimal ground rules for military justice, writ\nlarge. And it says that the President can't act in ways\nthat are contrary to, or inconsistent with, this chapter.\nAs Judge Robertson found, already we know that has\nhappened here. Mr. Hamdan has been kicked out of his\ncriminal trial right at the get-go. And the Government's\nposition is that they don't have to abide by the UCMJ,\nwhich is a further reason, of course, why we believe that\nabstention isn't appropriate, because it defies the rules\nset out by Congress.\nWe're asking this Court to apply the minimal\nrules of the UCMJ to the military commissions that operate\nat Guantanamo Bay, because article 2 of the UCMJ has been\nextended, and its protections now extend to Guantanamo Bay\nand protect those who are detained there. And one of its\nprotections is the right to be present, and that has been\nfundamentally violated by -- already.\nIf I could --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You acknowledge the existence\nof things called commissions. Or don't you?\nMR. KATYAL: We do.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean --\nMR. KATYAL: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What is the use of them if they\nhave to follow all of the procedures required by the UCMJ?\nI mean, I thought that the whole object was to have a\ndifferent procedure.\nMR. KATYAL: Justice Scalia, that's what the\nGovernment would like you to believe. I don't think\nthat's true. The historical relationship has been that\nmilitary commissions in courts-martial follow the same\nprocedures. That's what General Crowder said when he\ntestified in 1916, and what this Court has quoted from his\ntestimony. It's what every military treatise says.\nNow, to be clear, our position is not that\nmilitary commissions must follow all the rules for courts-\nmartial. Not at all. They must require -- must follow\nthe minimal baseline rules set in the Uniform Code of\nMilitary Justice by Congress. They can depart from the\npanoply of rules, the 867 pages of rules in the Manual for\nCourts-Martial, so long as they don't depart from the UCMJ\nitself. Congress has answered this question, Justice\nScalia, in article 36, by saying the President does have a\nwide ability to depart from the rules, but he can't depart\nfrom the fundamentals of the UCMJ. And, indeed, that's\nwhat --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What fundamentals, other than\npersonal presence, are you concerned with in this case?\nMR. KATYAL: Well --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Or is that it?\nMR. KATYAL: Well, we do believe that the --\nthat the entire panoply of UCMJ protection --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I understand --\nMR. KATYAL: -- is involved.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- the nature -- the\nappointing authority and so forth. But so far as the\nrights of the defendant at the proceeding --\nMR. KATYAL: Well --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- just right to be present?\nIs there a requirement of prompt convening of the\nproceedings?\nMR. KATYAL: Absolutely. There's an article 10\nright for speedy charges. There is also an article 67\nright for independent Court of Appeals for the Armed\nForces review, which is something that is not guaranteed\nby this commission. And so -- and, indeed, was a\npredicate for this Court's abstention holding in\nCouncilman.\nSo, we do believe that there are -- that these\nfundamental rights apply. And, of course, this is just\nall, Justice Kennedy, default rules. If the -- if the\nCongress wants to pass a law to exempt military\ncommissions from article 36, that -- they are free to do\nso, and that will then be -- that'll then be --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But if you have to --\nMR. KATYAL: -- a separate case --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- approximately the same\nprocedures, what's the point of having a military\ncommission? I think that was implicit in Justice Scalia's\nquestion. So, if you go back -- Revolution, Seminoles,\nModoc, Mexican War, World War II -- why have them?\nMR. KATYAL: Well, we had them before, because\n-- we had them before, because we couldn't find military\ncourt-martial jurisdiction. They were situations of\nabsolute necessity. The reason was that the Articles of\nWar, for one reason or another, didn't cover particular\nindividuals. And, therefore, we needed to craft a\nseparate procedure. But, whenever we did so, Justice\nBreyer, we always said that court-martial rules apply.\nIn 1847, which is really the first instance of a\nmilitary commission, because General Washington operated\nunder statutory charges to try spying -- but in 1847, we\napplied court-martial rules by General Order Number 1. In\nthe Civil War, we applied General Order Number 1 again,\nand it said that it would -- that we needed to apply to\ncourt-martial -- court-martial rules, because, otherwise,\nabuses would arise. And, essentially, the worry is one of\nforum shopping, that you give the President the ability to\npick a forum and define the rules. And that -- and that\nfundamentally open-ended authority is what I believe this\nCourt rejected in Hamdi, and it's -- and when it rejected\nthe blank check.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Katyal, you've addressed\nthe Detainee Treatment act in its -- in its capacity as,\narguably, removing jurisdiction. Might not the act also\nfunction as a retroactive approval of what the President\nhas done?\nMR. KATYAL: Certainly, there's nothing in the\ntext of the act itself -- and even -- I know this isn't\nrelevant for you, but for other individuals on the Court\n-- there's nothing in the legislative history, or even the\npost -- even the brief filed by Senators Graham and Kyl,\nwhich suggest, in any way, that this was ratification.\nBut suppose it were, Justice Scalia. Suppose it\ndid ratify some sort of military commission. I don't\nbelieve that it authorized this military commission with\nthis charge, conspiracy, in this conflict, a stateless,\nterritoryless conflict, with these procedures, procedures\nthat violate the UCMJ.\nSo, it may be that they authorized something.\nBut even that, I think, may be a bit hard, because, after\nall, what they did was authorize, as Justice Alito said,\ncertain challenges to military commissions.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you think, as a minimum,\nthat they authorized a military commission?\nMR. KATYAL: They -- I think it's perfectly --\nwell, it's a -- it's a -- it is a possible reading to say\nthe DTA authorized some sort of military commission. The\ntext doesn't say so. It is, of course, addressed to the\njurisdiction of this Court, and not in any way to the --\nto the -- to the -- to the underlying merits.\nI do think that the -- that there is a -- you\nknow, a conceivable argument. However, the reason why I\nthink this Court, if it did decide to reach that ultimate\nquestion, should reach it against the Government, is that\nthat kind of back-door kind of -- you know, approval by\ninference has never been sufficient when it comes to\nauthorizing military jurisdiction, in the most awesome\npowers of the Government, to dispense life imprisonment\nand death. That is, I think, a clearer statement would be\nrequired in this unique setting, because we aren't talking\nabout, after all, minor things. We're talking about the\nmost grave powers of our Government, the power to dispense\nlife imprisonment and death. And I certainly don't think\nCongress, on the basis of a few hours of debate, intended\nto ratify this entire apparatus.\nIf I could turn to question 2 and the Geneva\nConventions, I'd like to start with Common Article 3 and\nits minimal baseline requirements that a regularly\nconstituted court be set up, and one that dispense -- that\naffords the rights indispensable to civilized peoples.\nAs Judge Williams found, below, that article\ndoes apply to Mr. Hamdan, and protects him. It's the most\nminimal rudimentary requirements that the United States\nSenate adhered to when it ratified the convention in 1955.\nAnd those requirements --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It depends on what you mean by\n\"regularly constituted.\" In your brief, I gather you --\nwhat you meant is that a court that was pre-existing. It\ndoesn't necessarily mean that. It just -- it could mean\none that was set up for the occasion, but was set up for\nthe occasion by proper procedures. Wouldn't that be a\n\"regularly constituted court\"?\nMR. KATYAL: Well, I think the way that it has\nbeen interpreted, \"regularly constituted court,\" is not an\nad hoc court with ad hoc rules. So, that is to say,\nJustice Scalia, if they resuscitated --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I mean, not ad hoc in\nthat sense, \"I'm creating one court for this defendant,\nanother court for the other defendant,\" but setting up for\nthe occasion, and for trying numerous defendants, a new\ncourt. I don't think that, just because it's a new court,\nyou can say that it's not a \"regularly constituted court.\"\nMR. KATYAL: So long as it is, (a) independent\nof the executive, which is what it's been interpreted to\nbe, and, (b) affords the rights known to civilized\npeoples. And here, we think this military commission\nstrays from both of those -- both of those. It's not\nindependent of the executive --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You've mentioned -- you've\nmentioned that the defendant has no right to appear before\nthe tribunal. What are the other rights recognized by all\ncivilized people that these tribunals do not guarantee?\nMR. KATYAL: So far, Justice Ginsburg, all that\nwe have before -- you know, I think all that's happened is\nthe right to be present. To look to what other rights are\nguaranteed by Common Article 3, you can look to Additional\nProtocol 1 of the Geneva Conventions, which specifies\nrights like appeal rights and the like. But they're the\nmost minimal baseline rights. We're not talking about,\nyou know, Miranda rights or something like that. We're\ntalking about just a set of core ideas that every country\non the world -- every country in the world is supposed to\ndispense when they create war-crimes trials. And, even\nthat minimal standard, the Government says they don't want\nto apply here.\nAnd why we think this is enforceable is that Mr.\nHamdan is being prosecuted in the name of the laws of war.\nAnd he has the right to invoke the Geneva Conventions\ndefensively as a -- as a way to constrain the tribunal, to\nsay that they can't --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: How do you want us to view his\nstatus? Do we accept the Government's submission that\nthere's probable cause to believe that he was not of -- in\na formal uniform, that he was not a formal combatant, but\nthat he was aiding and abetting, or conspiring, with al\nQaeda? Can we accept that, that there's probable cause\nfor that?\nMR. KATYAL: No, Justice Kennedy, for two\nreasons.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, in -- particularly\nbased on the CSRT hearing?\nMR. KATYAL: The CSRT, to my knowledge, never\nasked any of those --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But you have to --\nMR. KATYAL: -- questions about --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- you have to give us --\nMR. KATYAL: -- uniforms or --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- a beginning point. You\nhave to give us a beginning point.\nMR. KATYAL: We would love a beginning point.\nAnd the beginning point is an article 5 hearing, which is\nrequired by Army Regulation 190-8, in article 5 of the\nGeneva Conventions. The CSRT in no way suffices to do\nthat. It didn't ask those questions about, Are -- you\nknow, uniforms, and the like, to my knowledge. Of course,\nthe CSRT isn't in the record, so we don't really know.\nThe Government said, below, that it had, quote, \"zero\neffect on this case,\" and didn't introduce it.\nBut, be that as it may, suppose that the CSRT\ndid decide that Mr. Hamdan is an enemy combatant. Justice\nKennedy, most enemy combatants are prisoners of war. So,\nif anything, all the CSRT did was affirm Mr. Hamdan's\nseparate claim, apart from Common Article 3, to the full\nprotection of the Geneva Conventions.\nIf I --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And that would require a\ndetermination by a different tribunal that he was not a\nPOW, in default of which he would be treated as a POW and\nbe entitled to a court-martial? Is that the point?\nMR. KATYAL: Yes, Justice --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nMR. KATYAL: -- Souter.\nIf I could reserve the balance of my time.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, you certainly may.\nGeneral Clement.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Justice Stevens, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe executive branch has long exercised the\nauthority to try enemy combatants by military commissions.\nThat authority was part and parcel of George Washington's\nauthority as Commander in Chief of the Revolutionary\nForces, as dramatically illustrated by the case of Major\nAndre. And that authority was incorporated into the\nConstitution.\nCongress has repeatedly recognized and\nsanctioned that authority. Indeed, each time Congress has\nextended the jurisdiction of the court-martials, Congress\nwas at pains to emphasize that that extension did not come\nin derogation of the jurisdiction of military commissions.\nAnd in its most recent action, Congress clearly did not\noperate as somebody who viewed the military commissions as\nultra vires. They offered no immediate review, and no\nreview at all for charges resulting in a conviction of\nless than 10 years.\nOf course, even more clearly, Congress's most\nrecent action made it clear that the courts no longer have\njurisdiction over pre-enforcement challenges. And it's to\nthat I'd like to turn first.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But let me just ask this\nquestion, Mr. Clement. What sources of law have the\ncommissions generally enforced over the years, beginning\nwith George Washington and so forth? Just Army\nregulations or American law or foreign law? What are the\nbasic sources of law that they can enforce?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, what I would say,\nJustice Stevens, is, they basically enforce the laws of\nwar. At times, there are obviously United States sources\nthat are relevant to that. Obviously, if you have a field\nmanual or something that says specifically that certain\noffenses are triable under the law of war, that would be\nvery instructive in the tribunals. In certain situations\nthat I don't think are principally relevant here, you\nmight also have war courts that were set up to deal with\nmunicipal offenses. But that's not what we have. And\nthen, they would look to U.S. law.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And what we have here is\nenforcement of the laws of war.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: That is right. And, of\ncourse, in this context, you have a controlling executive\nact in the form of the regulations themselves that make it\nclear that the executive views things like conspiracy to\nviolate the laws of war to be actionable under the laws of\nwar.\nNow --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If -- just one hypothetical.\nAssume that the laws of war do not prohibit conspiracy.\nJust assume -- I know you disagree with that. Could the\nPresident, by his action, add conspiracy as a triable\noffense by a commission?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think if you did that,\nJustice Stevens, it would present the very difficult\nquestion that this Court has never squarely addressed,\nwhich is, does the President have some authority to try,\nby military commission, beyond that which Congress has\njoined him in? Obviously, article 21 of the UCMJ gives\nCongress's sanction to any military commissions, to the\nextent they try crimes that are triable by the law of war.\nSo, in that sense, I think, as long as this Court\nconstrues consistent with over 100 years of United States\ntradition and history, the conspiracy to commit a law -- a\nviolation of the law of war is a war crime, then you don't\nhave to reach that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, if --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- difficult issue.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It's easy if it is a war\ncrime. I'm trying to wrestle with the question of, if we\nconcluded that it were not, and just -- and I'm asking --\ncan the question add an additional crime that the\ncommission could try?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think he --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You think he could.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think we would take the\nposition that he could, as a matter of pure constitutional\npower. I don't think, though -- he has not acted in this\ncase on the theory that conspiracy is outside of the laws\nof war. He's acted inconsistent with 150 years of\ntradition.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So, the basic position you're\nasserting is that we have -- that the -- this commission\nintends to try a violation of the laws of war. And do the\nlaws of war then have any application to the procedures\nthat they have to follow?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Yes. I mean, in the sense\nthat I think that if there were -- there -- the other side\nis certainly able to argue, before the military\ncommissions, that certain procedural provisions or the\nlike are prohibited by the law of war or give them some\ngreater entitlement. Now, as this Court has recognized in\ncases like Madsen, I don't think that the law of war is --\nyou know, extensively regulates procedure. And, indeed,\nas the Madsen Court recognized, Congress's approach to\nmilitary commissions has been radically different than its\napproach to court-martials. In court-martials, they\nregulate every jot and tittle of the procedure. And if\nthe UCMJ and its provisions for court-martials applies,\nthen the defendants are going to get not just Miranda, but\nMiranda plus, and a whole panoply of rights.\nIf, on the other hand, this Court follows the\nprecedents in Madsen, it will recognize that only those\nnine provisions of the UCMJ that expressly reference\nmilitary commissions will apply, and the rest is left to a\nmuch more common-law, war-court approach, where there's\nmuch greater flexibility.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What do you -- what do you make\nof the argument that Mr. Katyal just alluded to, that if\nyou take the -- as you do -- take the position that the\ncommissions are operating under the laws of war, you've\ngot to accept that one law of war here is the Geneva\nConvention right to a presumption of POW status unless\nthere is a determination by a competent tribunal\notherwise, with the -- among other things, the rights that\nthat carries. I mean, how -- do you -- why not -- why\ndon't you go from the frying pan into the fire, in effect,\nwhen you take the position that the laws of war are what\nthe tribunal is applying?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Souter, I don't\nthink there's any frying pan effect or fire effect,\nprecisely because what you have with respect to the claim\nthat the Geneva Conventions applies -- okay, that claim\ncould be brought to the military commissions, but they\ncould adjudicate it and say that the Geneva Conventions\ndon't apply here, for any number of reasons. And I think\nthat this idea that there needs to be an article 5\nproceeding --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, but you're -- are you\nsaying that the -- that the commission will adjudicate POW\nstatus under the Geneva Convention? In other words, are\nyou stipulating that the Geneva Convention does apply, so\nthat the only argument left between you and Mr. Katyal\nwould be whether the commission itself was a competent\ntribunal to make the determination? Is that your\nposition?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I don't think so,\nJustice Souter. I mean, I think the disagreement is more\nfundamental than that. What I would say is, a claim could\nbe brought in the tribunal that the Geneva Conventions\napply. Now, just because the Geneva Convention does apply\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, do you agree that it\napplies as part of the law of war?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I don't think,\nconsistent with the position of the executive, that the\nGeneva Convention applies in this particular conflict.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But that, I guess, is the\nproblem that I'm having. For purposes of determining the\ndomestic authority to set up a commission, you say, the\nPresident is operating under the laws of war recognized by\nCongress, but for purposes of a claim to status, and,\nhence, the procedural rights that go with that status,\nyou're saying the laws of war don't apply. And I don't\nsee how you can have it both ways.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: We're not trying to have it\nboth ways, Justice Souter. The fact that the Geneva\nConventions are part of the law of war doesn't mean that\nPetitioner is entitled to any protection under those\nconventions. And --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But he is entitled to make a\nclaim under them to determine whether, on the merits, he\nis entitled. Isn't that entailed by your position?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think it is, Your Honor, but\nlet me just say that that's a claim that he could have\nbrought before the CSRTs, and that is a claim he can still\nbring before the military commissions.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I have --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Lawful --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- I have -- I have trouble\nwith the argument that -- insofar as he says there is a\nstructural invalidity to the military commission, that he\nbrings that before the commission. The historic office\nof habeas is to test whether or not you are being tried by\na lawful tribunal. And he says, under the Geneva\nConvention, as you know, that it isn't.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, and we disagree with\nthose claims. We think that most of those claims -- to\nthe extent that he thinks some procedural requirement is\nprovided either by the Geneva Convention, if applicable --\nbut we don't think it would be -- and that argument would\nbe made; but, if by some other, sort of, principle of the\nlaw of war that a procedure is required --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it's not some --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- he could -- he could make\nthat argument.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- procedural -- it's the\nstructural requirement of the composition and the -- and\nthe appointing origins of the court.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, again, I think he could\n-- he could bring that claim. I don't think it would be\nwell taken by the -- by the commission. I don't think\nit's a valid claim. I also don't think, if -- there's any\nreason why that claim has to be brought at this stage in\nthe procedure. We think that abstention --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- principles --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought we -- I thought we\nestablished, earlier -- somebody told me -- that, in the\nnormal criminal suit, even if you claim that the forum is\nnot properly constituted, that claim is not adjudicated\nimmediately, it's adjudicated at the conclusion of the\nproceeding.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, of course that's true.\nAnd --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- also --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We don't -- we don't intervene\non habeas corpus when somebody says that the panel is\nimproperly constituted. We wait until the proceeding's\nterminated, normally.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: That's exactly right, Justice\nScalia. And this Court made clear that it doesn't\nintervene --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, is --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- even when a U.S. --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- is that -- is that true?\nIf a group of people decides they're going to try somebody,\nwe wait until that group of people finishes the trial\nbefore the Court -- before habeas intervenes to determine\nthe authority of the tribunal to hold and to try?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, with respect, Justice\nKennedy, this isn't a \"group of people.\" This is the\nPresident invoking an authority that he's exercised in\nvirtually every war that we've had. It's something that\nwas recognized in the Civil War, something in the World\nWar II that this Court approved.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I had thought that the\nhistoric function of habeas is to -- one of its functions\n-- is to test the jurisdiction and the legitimacy of a\ncourt.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, but -- habeas corpus\ngenerally doesn't give a right to a pre-enforcement\nchallenge. And this Court, for example, in Schlesinger\nagainst Councilman --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: To a forum that is prima facie\nproperly constituted. I mean, it -- this is not a -- you\nknow, a necktie party. Where it parades as a court, and\nit's been constituted as a court, we normally wait until\nthe proceeding's completed.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, that's exactly right,\nJustice Scalia. And Congress has spoken to this precise\nissue in the DTA. Whatever was the question about\napplying --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But, Mr. Clement --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- judge made --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- if you assume that the laws\nof war apply, and perhaps the treaty applies, isn't the\nissue whether this is a \"group of people,\" on the one\nhand, or a \"regularly constituted court,\" on the other?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I mean, I don't really\nthink there's any serious dispute about which it is. I\nmean, this is something that is --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, they argue very\nstrenuously that this is really just a \"group of people\"\n--\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well -- and if this Court --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- because it's not a\n\"regularly constituted court\" within the meaning of the\ntreaty.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Stevens, I think\nthat even if a court might have had jurisdiction to hear\njust that issue and --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- nothing else before the\nDTA, Congress has now spoken, and Congress has made it\nclear that, whatever else is true, these military\ncommission proceedings can proceed, and exclusive review\ncan be done after the fact, after conviction, in the D.C.\nCircuit.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Exclusive review of what? I\ndon't see that the -- that the -- that the DTA preserves a\nright to review of the very issue that they want to raise\nhere.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I think I disagree, at\nleast --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: They can -- they can -- they\ncan review their enemy combatant determination. They can\nreview the consistency of the procedure of the court with\nwhatever law applies. But I don't see that there is a\nclear reservation of right to get to the very basic\nquestion of the -- of the constitution of the court\nitself.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Oh, I disagree, Justice\nSouter. E(3) specifically preserves the claim that the\ncommissions were not, and the procedures were not,\nconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United\nStates --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So, you're reading --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- to the extent --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- procedures --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- they're pledgeable.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- to encompass the very act\nconstituting the court itself? Is that the Government's\n-- I mean, are you going to go on the record --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Sure, if they want to come in\nand argue that there is a violation of article 21 of the\nUCMJ, or article 36 of the UCMJ, after their conviction,\nthey are perfectly free to do that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's hard for me to --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- under E(3), but --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- see that with the language\nof this, because the language that you're talking about\nrefers to \"such standards.\" \"Such standards and\nprocedures\" refer to the preceding paragraph, which is\nstandards and procedures specified in the military order\nreferred to in subparagraph (a). That military order is\nan order of August 31st which talks about procedures.\nIt's not the order that sets up the commission, which is\nan order issued the preceding November. Rather, this\nlanguage seems to mean what it says.\nBut even if it didn't -- even if it didn't,\nwouldn't your reading raise a terrifically difficult\nconstitutional question, if not this case, in cases that\nare pending right now, where prisoners in Guantanamo are\nclaiming that they have not yet had the CSRT hearing,\nthey're claiming, one or two, \"We had it, and we're still\nhere. We won, but we're still here.\" They're claiming,\n\"We don't want to be sent back to Qatar.\" And they're\nclaiming, some, that they were tortured. All right?\nNow, if we could avoid that case with your\ninterpretation here, and avoid that constitutional\nquestion -- we can't avoid it. So, my question is, one,\nHow is what you're arguing consistent with the language I\nquoted? And, two, How could it, if we accepted your\ninterpretation, possibly avoid the most terribly difficult\nand important constitutional question of whether Congress\ncan constitutionally deprive this Court of jurisdiction in\nhabeas cases?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Breyer, let me\nanswer both pieces of that. I certainly think that such\nstandards and procedures to reach the final decision is\nconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United\nStates. There is a reference to the first military order.\nI believe there's also a reference to any other\nsubsequent orders implementing that. All of that,\ntogether, implements the November 13th order. So, I would\nthink that there is -- it is very easy to read this\nlanguage to allow any challenge that is being brought\nhere, with the possible exception of the treaty challenge.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Would you --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: And --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Would you --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- I think the language is\ncapacious enough if the treaty challenge is what you\nthought was very important, the D.C. Circuit, at the end\nof the day, could decide whether or not there is a\nrequirement that the treaty challenge be brought.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: General Clement, if you can\nstraighten me out on the piece that you read about\n\"consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United\nStates,\" I thought that it was the Government's position\nthat these enemy combatants do not have any rights under\nthe Constitution and laws of the United States.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: That is true, Justice\nGinsburg. And Congress, in this act, was very careful to\nbasically write without prejudice to the answer to that\nquestion. So, we would have that argument. The other\nside would have their argument. What this act provides\nthat we don't have any argument on, that was something\nthat wasn't before this Court, say, in the Rasul decision,\nwas the fact that the procedures that the military has\npromulgated are going to be enforceable under this\nexclusive review provision. So, there at least will be\nsome law to apply now under this exclusive review\nprovision.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But what --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: So, that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But how will the question,\nwhether the laws in the United -- and Constitution -- of\nthe United States, whether these petitioners have any\nclaim to state under the laws and Constitution of the\nUnited States? Because as I read -- the review that's\nprovided doesn't open up that question. It's a very\nnarrow review that's given to the D.C. Circuit.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I\ncertainly think that Petitioner will be up there arguing\nthat Eisentrager is no longer good law, not just as a\nstatutory matter, as a constitutional matter, and those\narguments will be made. Without respect to that,\ncertainly the arguments about article 21 and Article 36,\nthat are very much the centerpiece of their argument\nhere today, would also be available to the D.C. Circuit.\nAnd if there's some constitutional requirement that that\nreview be slightly broader or slightly narrower, that\nseems like something that can better be adjudicated in the\ncontext of a concrete case at the point that that review\nis sought.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: But one thing I --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there -- is there any\nreview in this Court, following the D.C. Circuit, either\nthe original classification or the conviction -- is there\n-- does this Court have any part in the scheme?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, there\nwould be 1254 review. Once the provision is in the court\nof appeals, then the case would be under -- under E(3),\nthe review provision -- then the case would be in the\ncourt of appeals for purposes of this Court's 1254\njurisdiction.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I still don't see the answer to\nmy question, which had two parts. As to the language, (a)\nwhich is what's cross-referenced, refers to Military\nCommission Order Number 1, August 31, 2005, or any\nsuccessor military order. The order, as I understand it,\nthat's created the commission by the President, is an\norder which was November 13, 2001, not a successor to\n2005.\nBut leaving the language aside, what I'm mostly\ninterested in, because I think your interpretation\ninevitably creates it, is, what is the answer to the claim\nthat it is not constitutional for Congress, without\nsuspending the writ of habeas corpus, to accomplish the\nsame result by removing jurisdiction from the courts in a\nsignificant number of cases, even one?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Breyer, let me\nanswer that question in two parts, which is to say that I\nthink that this case, and most of the cases, don't raise a\nserious Suspension Clause problem, for the simple reason\nthat I think deferring review or channeling it to the\ncourt of appeals does not amount to a suspension.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I listed four sets of cases\nthat I don't see how you could possibly shoehorn into E(2)\nand E(3), even if you are able to shoehorn this one. And\nmy language was designed to make you see how difficult it\nis.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, but --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I listed four that I don't\nsee how anybody could shoehorn into that.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: But, with respect, Justice\nBreyer, I think that cuts both ways, because I don't think\nthere's any particular interpretation of these provisions\non the table before this Court that's going to eliminate\nthose potential Suspension Clause issues.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But the whole point, it seems\nto me, of the argument, is, should we not consider the\nsignificance of those very questions, because, if we\ndon't, as Justice Breyer said, at the end of the day, as\nyou describe it, we will have to face the serious\nconstitutional question whether Congress can, in fact,\nlimit jurisdiction without suspending habeas corpus? The\nwhole point is to grapple with them now, and to -- and to\ntreat them in a way that allows for this adjudication, so\nthat we avoid this constitutional difficulty tomorrow.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Souter, first of\nall, I would think general principles of constitutional\navoidance would say deferring the constitutional question\nis a good thing, not a bad thing. The one point I would\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: We may not have to reach the\nconstitutional question. That's what -- that's what\nconstitutional avoidance hopes for.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Right. But I don't see any\nargument on the other side that's really a constitutional\navoidance argument. Their principal argument is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, the argument --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- don't apply this --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- the other side -- if you\nwant the argument, the other side is, there are several\nhundred cases already pending. And, therefore, if we\naccept your interpretation, we know we have to reach the\nconstitutional argument. If we reject your\ninterpretation, since all these cases, several hundred of\nthem, are already there, it might be: new ones won't be\nbrought. But, of course, \"new ones won't\" might. And,\ntherefore, what is your answer to --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- the question that this is\nunconstitutional -- if not here, in other places?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: And, Justice Breyer, what I\nwould say is that our interpretation basically provides\nfor pending claims exactly the way that Congress did.\nWith respect to any future claims that might be brought,\nthere may or may not be a constitutional question.\nAnd if I could turn to our interpretation of the\nDTA, it's the only one that really, I think, reads the\nvarious provisions in the statute in harmony. Now, this\nCourt's decision in Bruner, and in a host of other cases,\nsays that when Congress eliminates jurisdiction, pending\ncases fall, unless there's a savings clause. The closest\nthing to a savings clause in this statute, in E(1), is the\nprovision that says \"except pursuant to Section 1005.\"\nAnd I think that's important, because if Congress wanted\nto put in a savings clause of the kind that this Court\nseems to refer to in Bruner, and that would certainly be\nconsistent with Senator Levin's intent, it would have been\nvery easy. Instead of saying \"except for Section 1005,\"\nthey could have said \"except for pending cases.\"\nThe choice is important, because what does\nSection 1005 provide? It provides the exclusive review in\nE(2) and E(3). And then, H(2), in very complementary\nfashion, says that, just in case there's any question\nabout it, those provisions on E(2) and E(3) apply to\npending claims governed by those sections. I think every\nword's important. It doesn't say \"pending cases,\" it says\n\"pending claims.\"\nCongress understood two important things. There\nwere no cases currently pending under E(2) and E(3),\nbecause Congress was creating E(2) and E(3). It also knew\nthat most of the cases before the D.C. Courts had some\nclaims that were pure challenges to the final CSRT\ndetermination and other claims. So, what H(2) says is --\nH(2) says that, to the extent those cases involve claims\ngoverned by E(2) and E(3), they are preserved under E(2)\nand E(3); otherwise, this -- there's no savings clause\nthat covers those claims, and their jurisdiction is\nremoved. The --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- retroactivity aspect -- I'm\nsorry.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I just ask this, just to\nclarify? When they do take away some jurisdiction of some\nhabeas corpus claims, do you defend that, in part, as a\npermissible exercise of the power to suspend the writ, or\ndo you say it is not a suspension of the writ?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think both, ultimately. I\nmean, I don't think --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It can't be both.\n[Laughter.]\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I -- I don't see why I\ncan't have alternative arguments here, as for anywhere\nelse, Justice Stevens. We think that Congress, in this\naction, did not do anything that triggers the suspension\nof the writ. But if you think that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, that --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- it did, I think that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- that's your position, they\ndid not suspend the writ. You're not arguing that it's a\njustifiable suspension of the writ.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I think that the terms of\nthe Suspension Clause would be satisfied here because of\nthe exigencies of 9/11. If the question is, am I taking\nthe position that Congress consciously thought that it was\nsuspending the writ, then I would say no.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Okay.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: And if you think, in order for\nthere be to a -- to be a valid suspension, Congress has to\ndo it consciously, then I think you could see why the\narguments are mutually exclusive. My view would be that\nif Congress, sort of, stumbles upon a suspension of the\nwrit, but the preconditions are satisfied, that would\nstill be constitutionally valid. So, I think that may be\nthe disagreement.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't there a --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I mean --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't there a pretty good\nargument that a suspension of the writ of Congress is just\nabout the most stupendously significant act that the\nCongress of the United States can take? And, therefore,\nwe ought to be at least a little slow to accept your\nargument that it can be done from pure inadvertence?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, a couple of things,\nJustice Souter. I would agree with you if what we were\ntalking about is suspending the right as to citizens\nwithin the Continental United States, but all Congress did\nhere is restore the law to the understanding of the law\nthat had prevailed for 200 years. Now, this Court\nobviously took a different view --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If we have to --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- in Rasul.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- get to the issue, in\naccordance with Justice Breyer's question, whether or not\nthe writ of habeas corpus was suspended, you are leaving\nus with the position of the United States that the\nCongress may validly suspend it inadvertently. Is that\nreally your position?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think at least if you're\ntalking about the extension of the writ to enemy\ncombatants --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The writ is the --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- held outside --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The writ is the --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- the territory of the United\nStates --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Now, wait a minute. The writ\nis the writ.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Okay.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: There are not two writs of\nhabeas corpus for some cases and for other cases. The\nrights that -- the rights that may be asserted, the rights\nthat may be vindicated, will vary with the circumstances,\nbut jurisdiction over habeas corpus is jurisdiction over\nhabeas corpus. And it seems to me that the position you\nhave taken is that if, at the end of the day, we have to\nreach the question that Justice Breyer described, the\nanswer to that question may be, \"Yes, the writ of habeas\ncorpus was suspended by inadvertence. Congress did not\nintend to do it.\" Is that really your position?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: No, Justice Souter. There's\nno -- my point is not inadvertence. It's whether they\nhave to say or incant any magic words that they are now\ninvoking their power --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They could surely --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- to suspend the writ.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- set forth a procedure which\namounts to a suspension of the writ. And if that\nprocedure is done in a state of insurrection or invasion,\nthat would constitute a suspension of the writ, even\nthough they don't say, \"We are suspending the writ of\nhabeas corpus.\"\nGENERAL CLEMENT: That is my point. And there's\nnothing inadvertent here --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is it also your point when\nthere is no insurrection or invasion?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, then any effort to\nsuspend the writ would be invalid. But this is not a case\nwhere there's any question of --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Perhaps that's something that a\ncourt ought to inquire into when it gets into the question\nof congressional intent.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I don't think --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And how specific --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- I disagree with that.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- that intent --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I guess my point would --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- and how specific that intent\nmust be.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I don't think I disagree with\nthat. But there's two separate points here, is that --\none is, does Congress have to say, \"We are now suspending\nthe writ under our Suspension Clause\"? And I don't think\nthere's any call to say that they have to do that.\nObviously, in cases like St. Cyr, this Court has been very\nclear to say, \"Congress obviously can't stumble upon the\nHabeas Clause.\"\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. Let's --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: But that's not --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Let's --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- at issue here.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Let's assume we do not have a\nmagic-words requirement. Given the significance of\nsuspending the writ of habeas corpus, should we not have a\npretty clear statement requirement?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Yes. And there's no question\nthat Congress, here, tried to amend the habeas statute.\nThis is not like St. Cyr, where they didn't go after 2241\nin terms. There's nothing subtle about this statute with\nrespect to the clarity with which it speaks --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: There may be nothing --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- to the habeas statute.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- subtle about the statute,\nbut there is something very silent about the statute as to\nwhether Congress understood that it was -- that it was\nacting under its authority to suspend the writ of habeas\ncorpus. And, at the very least, that unclarity is\nmanifested by the effective-date provision. H(1) doesn't\nhave the language that it had before the amendment.\nTherefore, it seems to me, there would be some difficulty,\nif we have to get to the question, in finding a clear\nintent on the part of Congress to suspend the writ under\nits article I power.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: With respect, Justice Souter,\nI don't think making a retroactivity analysis or holding\nhere is going to spare you the trouble of dealing with the\nSuspension Clause argument. I mean, in St. Cyr, it's\nworth noting that this Court addressed the specificity\nwith which the statute applied separately from the\nretroactivity question. Here, to take the first question\nfirst, there's no question, this wolf comes as a wolf.\nCongress was going after 2241. It clearly did that. All\nof E(1) --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It comes --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- is a new subsection.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It comes as a wolf under H(2),\nbut the wolf is silent under H(1), and the wolf used to\nspeak under H(1), and it had its teeth taken out.\n[Laughter.]\nGENERAL CLEMENT: With respect, Justice Souter,\nH(1) never spoke to the question. An earlier provision,\nD(1), had very different language, in an earlier provision\nof the statute, that spoke with greater clarity. I'll\ngrant --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And that's --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- you that.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- gone.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: That's gone. But just because\nCongress could have made it clearer doesn't mean that the\nGovernment loses here.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The very fact --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Senator --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- that Congress chose to\nremove the clarity of the prior provision is of no\nsignificance?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: It's not of dispositive\nsignificance, Justice Souter.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think Congress chose to\ndo that. One house of Congress chose to do it. We don't\nknow what the other house thought, and we don't know what\nthe President thought.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: That's a very fair point,\nJustice Scalia. But even to get at the very -- what\nhappened here is very analogous to the legislative\nevolution this Court found unilluminating in Martin\nagainst Haddocks. There, the attorneys fees provision you\nhad before it -- before you, used to be in 802 of the\nstatute, which was expressly applicable to pending cases.\nCongress moved it out into its own separate section that\ndidn't expressly apply to pending cases.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: This Court did not --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Whatever may be the standard of\ndue care for courts in reviewing acts of Congress with\nrespect to attorneys fees, it doesn't reach the level\nthat, it seems to me, is incumbent on us when we're\ntalking about suspending the writ of habeas corpus.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I don't disagree with that,\nJustice Souter, but there's no special habeas\nretroactivity law. There is a special rule, under St.\nCyr, for habeas, but we amply satisfy that, because --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Can --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- 22- --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- this whole thing is a\n2241(e) new section. So, this is all about amending\nhabeas.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask you another\nquestion about the clarity with which Congress spoke?\nThis law was proposed and enacted some weeks after this\nCourt granted cert in this very case. It is an\nextraordinary act, I think, to withdraw jurisdiction from\nthis Court in a pending case. Congress didn't say,\nexplicitly, it was doing that. It hasn't done it, as far\nas I know, since McArdle. But there Congress said, \"We\nare withdrawing jurisdiction in this very case.\" They\ndidn't say that here. So, why should we assume that\nCongress withdraw our jurisdiction to hear this case once\nthe case was already lodged here?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think the answer, Justice\nGinsburg, is that, you're right, this isn't like ex parte\nMcArdle. What made ex parte McArdle so unique is,\nCongress went after this Court's appellate jurisdiction,\nand that alone. What Congress has done here, which is not\nthat unusual, and it's certainly happened several times\nsince McArdle, is that the Court has modified the\njurisdiction of all the courts, and that has had the\neffect of eliminating jurisdiction in this Court over a\npending case.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Mr. --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: That's happened any number of\ntimes. The Guagliardo cases that we cite in our brief\nprovide one example. And as Justice Holmes made the point\nthere, it's not a situation where you go after this\nCourt's appellate jurisdiction, as such. There, it's a\nsituation, as Justice Holmes put it, that, when the root\nis cut, the branches fall; when the district court loses\njurisdiction over these cases, then this Court loses\njurisdiction. But it's much less of an affront to this\nCourt than the kind of statute that Congress passed in the\nMcArdle situation.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Mr. Clement, I, for one, have\nlost track of your time. I'm interested in your arguments\non the -- on the legitimacy and the regularity of these\ncommissions.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: And if I could talk to various\naspects of that, I'm happy --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can I put the --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- to do so.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- that issue in -- don't --\nignore my question, which is the same as Justice\nKennedy's, if it doesn't help. I'm trying to focus this.\nAnd, in my mind, I take their argument as saying, \"Look,\nyou want to try a war crime. You want to say this is a\nwar crimes tribunal. One, this is not a war, at least not\nan ordinary war. Two, it's not a war crime, because that\ndoesn't fall under international law. And, three, it's\nnot a war crime tribunal or commission, because no\nemergency, not on the battlefield, civil courts are open,\nthere is no military commander asking for it, it's not in\nany of those in other respects, like past history. And if\nthe President can do this, well, then he can set up\ncommissions to go to Toledo, and, in Toledo, pick up an\nalien, and not have any trial at all, except before that\nspecial commission.\"\nNow, I've tried to summarize a whole bunch of\npoints for you to get at, as you wish.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Let me try to hit a couple --\n[Laughter.]\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Let me try to hit a couple of\nhighlights.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'll be interested in your\nanswer, if you can get it out.\n[Laughter.]\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Let me try to hit a couple of\nhighlights. This is much more of a call for military\ncommissions in a real war than, certainly, the use of\nmilitary commissions against the Medoc Indians or any\nnumber of other instances in which the President has\navailed himself of this authority in the past. I think\nthe events of 9/11 speak to the fact that this is a war\nwhere the laws of war are involved.\nAs to whether or not the law of war encompasses\nthe crime of conspiracy to violate the laws of war, we\nthink that is clearly established. That is something that\nthe United States treated as a valid war crime in the\nCivil War. That is something that the United States\ntreated as a valid war crime in World War II.\nI would invite you, as to the former, to look at\nWinthrop's Treatise, page 839, note 5. He makes it very\nclear that those conspiracies are not just conspiracies of\nmunicipal law, what he called \"of the first class,\" but\nthey included the second class, which are classic war\ncrimes. The most prominent examples are the Lincoln\nconspirators and a conspiracy at Andersonville Prison to\ndeny POWs their lawful rights. Clearly, those are classic\nwar crimes. In World War II, of course, conspiracy was\nalso charged. And this Court saw it in the Kearing case,\nalthough it didn't reach that element of the charge.\nNow, I think it's very important to understand\nthat history, because the most relevant text on this\nquestion is article 21's reference to the law of war. And\nas this Court was crystal clear in the Madsen case, what\nthat reference is, is Congress's effort, when it extended\nthe jurisdiction of the courts-martials to include more\nand more crimes, that it didn't want to crowd out the\nmilitary jurisdiction of the military commissions just\nbecause they had concurrent jurisdiction. And this Court,\nin Madsen, said what Congress authorized was the\njurisdiction of the military commissions as it existed in\n1916, and then presumably again when it passed article 21\nof the UCMJ, the jurisdiction that existed as of 1950.\nWell, in 1960, you could try conspiracies to violate the\nlaw of war. In 1950, you could violate conspiracies to\nthe law of war.\nSo, now let me try to get to the procedures that\nwould be applicable. The argument that's made here is an\nextraordinary one, that article 36, when it says that\nmilitary commissions can deviate from the laws of\nevidence, to the extent the President determines\nnecessary, except that it must apply for the -- comply with\nthe provisions of the UCMJ. Clearly, what that provision\nmeans is the provisions of the UCMJ that specifically\nimpose requirements on the military commissions. And\nthere are nine of them. And they impose some -- certain\nminimum rules.\nBut to say that that provision incorporates all\nof the UCMJ provisions that put much higher requirements\non courts-martials, is to violate this Court's Madsen\ndecision, which clearly recognized that there were\ndifferences between court-martials and military\ncommissions. And, although that was an act -- that was a\ncase that addressed the articles of war, article 38 is\nidentical to article 36(a) of the UCMJ, so that's not a\ndifference that matters.\nAnd, if I could say, the other thing is, that\njust violates any normal principle of statutory\nconstruction, because then the nine express references to\nthe military commissions are rendered utterly superfluous.\nClearly, what Congress had in mind was that,\n\"You must comply with those provisions of the UCMJ that\napply specifically to the military commissions.\"\nIf I could make this point clear, because I\nthink it's helpful in reading the past cases, what made\nYamashita and other of the World War II cases so difficult\nis that the President in that situation constituted\ncommissions that violated even the procedural rules that\nthe articles of war made specifically applicable to the\ncommissions. And so, if you look, for example, at Justice\nRutledge's dissent in the Yamashita case, he was at pains\nto emphasize that very few of the provisions of the\narticles of war applied to military commissions. And the\ndifficulty was that the -- that the military, in that\ncase, was not complying with even those provisions that\nspecifically applied to military commissions by terms.\nThat's not an issue here. These military\ncommissions comply with all of the provisions of the UCMJ\nthat are specifically addressed to military commissions.\nSo, I just don't think there's a procedural problem here.\nThe import of extending article 2 jurisdiction\nto new individuals doesn't mean that anything in\nYamashita, as to this point, is really no -- is still\nrelevant. What that does is, it takes away the argument\n-- to the extent that these individuals are within article\n2, it takes away the argument that the President doesn't\nhave to even comply with those provisions of the UCMJ that\nare expressly directed to the military commissions. But\nthat's not an argument we're making here.\nThe argument on the other side of this is really\nthat when Congress specifies that nine rules apply to\nmilitary commissions, and everything else applies to\ncourts-martials, that somehow all of them have to apply to\nthe military commissions. And as Justice Scalia's\nquestion alluded to earlier, in order to accept that\nargument, you really have to believe that what Congress\nwas doing when it was carefully preserving the military --\nthe jurisdiction of the military commissions was simply to\npreserve the option of calling something that had to\ncomply with every single statutory requirement in the\ncourt-martials. They got to label it something else.\nThey got to label it a \"military commission.\"\nClearly, if you look at the legislative history\nof Article of War 15 and article 21, as they were\ndeveloped in the Madsen decision and discussed in the\nauthoritative testimony of General Crowder, that's exactly\nwhat wasn't going on. They wanted to make sure that this\nargument, that as we get more and more things that come\nwithin the military jurisdiction of the courts-martials,\nthat somehow we're cutting back on the military\ncommissions. That's not what they wanted.\nThe next thing that may be lurking in the\nquestion is the question of, Wwat about the Geneva\nConventions? And I think that, very importantly, we have\narguments that we have surfaced in our briefs that the\nGeneva Conventions do not provide relief in these\ncircumstances, that they do not apply, for various\nreasons. But the first question, at the outset, is\nwhether this Court is going to overrule that portion of\nEisentrager that basically said the Geneva Conventions are\nnot judicially enforceable.\nNow, of course, this Court can say, \"That was\nthe '29 Convention, and this is the 1949 Convention.\"\nBut, as the court of appeals correctly determined --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And there was a footnote\ndicta.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I don't think it was\ndicta, Justice Stevens. If there's one thing I think the\nEisentrager decision has, it's an awful lot of alternative\nholdings. And --\n[Laughter.]\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- Justice Black was concerned\nabout that, and said, \"What are you doing reaching the\nmerits when you have, you know, said there's no\njurisdiction?\" But the Court, as a holding, said that the\nGeneva Conventions of 1929 did not apply. There aren't\nany material differences about 1949 Conventions.\nAnd I ask you to think about why that makes\nsense. Because the 1949 Geneva Conventions were being\nnegotiated contemporaneously with this Court's decision in\nEisentrager. And even if you think the rule is different\ntoday, at that point, Justice Jackson was quite correct\nthat the idea that an enemy combatant would get access to\nthe domestic courts of a detaining power was absolutely\nabsurd. And so, what the -- the framers of the Geneva\nConvention recognized that they were dealing with a group\nof people that were uniquely vulnerable. So, they went to\ngreat pains to make sure there were mechanisms to enforce\ntheir rights. And so, there are various provisions for\nparty-to-party enforcement. There are various provisions\nfor getting the protecting powers, which is now a role\nbasically taken over by the ICRC, to get access to the\ndetainees and to provide other mediating effects.\nSo, what you have is a treaty that's really\nwritten against the backdrop, that of course these people\naren't going to be able to get to the domestic courts of\ntheir detaining -- the detaining power. If you look at\nthe treaty, and read it as a whole, I think it's almost\nimpossible to read it as applying judicially enforceable\nrights in the domestic courts. The constant --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Does it -- does it -- does it\ndefine the contours, along with other relevant\ninternational sources, of the meaning of the statutory\nwords \"laws of war.\" He's being charged with a violation\nof the laws of war in both statutes, like -- what is it?\n-- 2240 -- 2441, in Quirin. To get the meaning of that\nterm, courts looked to other law.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And, in particular, why isn't\nhe part of the Common Article 3 under the Geneva\nConvention, as Judge Williams found? That's part of the\nsame question.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Judge Williams found\nthat, you know, Common Article 3 was applicable here. I\ndon't know why that the Common Article 3, and nothing else\nwould be judicially enforceable. And I don't read his\nopinion as saying otherwise. I think he still took the\nview that the entirety of the Geneva Conventions were not\njudicially enforceable.\nNow, I take it that the thrust of the question,\nthough, is, don't these Geneva Conventions, even if\nthey're not applicable for one reason or another, don't\nthey form the background of some sort of customary\ninternational law that influences what -- how we should\ninterpret the word \"law of war\" in the statute? And I\nwould say, at a minimum, if there is some role for\ncustomary international law here, it has to, consistently\nwith The Paquete Habana case, take into account and give\ndue weight to a controlling executive act.\nHere, the President has determined, for example,\nthat conspiracy is an actionable violation of the law of\nwar that can be tried in front of these commissions. He's\nmade that clear. He's also made clear that these\nprocedures are sufficient and supply the rights. And so,\nI think that has to take -- be taken into account into the\nanalysis.\nI think, also, since article 21 is the most\nlogical place you would -- you would look to any of this\nas the law of war, I think it's important to understand\nthat I would read that as incorporating some question\nabout what kind of crimes can be brought in this\njurisdiction.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is it the President, and not\nCongress, defining the content of the law, the criminal\nlaw, under which a person will be tried? Isn't there a\n\"separation of powers\" problem there?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I sure hope not, Justice\nBreyer, because that's been the tradition for over 200\nyears. And article 21 itself makes this clear, because\nwhat does it say can be tried by military commission? It\nsays anything that's made a violation of statute or law of\nwar.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But I don't --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: So --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- think, Mr. Clement, the 200\nyears have approved of his adding additional crimes under\nthe law of war. I mean, he has never -- I don't think we\nhave ever held that the President can make something a\ncrime which was not already a crime under the law of war.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think that may be true,\nJustice Stevens --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- certainly as to the article\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And one --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- 21 point.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- of the issues is whether\nhe's done that here --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: But --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- I think.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: But there's no innovation in\ntrying conspiracy as a violation of the law of war.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If you're right on that,\nyou're right on the ultimate question, too.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I hope so, because\nthere's really no question that conspiracy has been\ncharged. And, like you said, I would encourage you to\nlook at footnote 5 on page 839 of the Winthrop Treatise;\nand this Quirin case had, also, that charge brought before\nit. Colepaugh against Looney, which is a Tenth Circuit\ncase from World War II, involved the charge of conspiracy.\nNow, they're going to come up here and tell you,\n\"Well, but that wasn't -- you know, in Colepaugh and\nQuirin, that wasn't the one that the Court settled on.\"\nBut that doesn't dispute the fact that that is a crime\nthat has traditionally been charged as a violation of the\nlaw of war.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Your time is -- why isn't Hamdam\na uniquely vulnerable individual that -- you used\nthe phrase \"uniquely vulnerable individuals\" were involved\nin another case, but not here. Why not here?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, he's -- I mean, I -- I'm\nnot saying that he isn't somebody who is protected by the\nlaws of war, the customary laws of war. I think that he\nis protected by those. I don't think he's protected by\nthe Geneva Conventions, but that's largely because he\nchose not to comply with the basic laws of war. He's\nobviously --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought -- I thought -- I\nthought you said all prisoners of war were uniquely\nvulnerable -- I thought that was the point you were making\n--\nGENERAL CLEMENT: That is the point --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- and had -- needed --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- that I'm making --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- needed protection of the --\nof the supervising powers, or whatever they're called.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Right, but not the domestic\ncourts of the detaining power. And if he's any different\nthan a usual prisoner of war, it's because he's\ndisentitled themselves to some protections by what has\nbeen determined by the CSRT protections.\nLet me just address, if I could, the idea that\nhaving provided him with CSRT, we now have to provide him\nwith an article 5 hearing. The CSRT provisions provide\nall of the protections, and then some, that were normally\nprovided in an article 5 hearing. They were focused on\nthe question that is relevant in this dispute, which is\nwhether or not somebody is an innocent civilian or an\nunlawful enemy combatant. Nobody has a claim here that\nthey were part of the uniformed al Qaeda division that\ncomplied with all of the laws of war, such that they are\nentitled to POW status. The POW unlawful enemy combatant\nline is not one that really needs to be policed in this\nconflict. The serious concern -- and it was his claim\nwhen Petitioner walked into Federal Court in Washington --\nhe said, \"I am not an enemy combatant. I did not take up\narms against the United States.\" That's the claim that he\nbrought to the CSRT, the CSRT rejected.\nFor these purposes, at this stage in the\nlitigation, that ought to be enough to allow the\nproceeding to go forward in front of the military\ncommission.\nOne of the defenses in the military commissions\nis lawful combatancy immunity. He can make the argument\nthat he wants to make in front of the commissions. If the\ncommission rejects the argument, then there will be review\nof that decision in the court of appeals on a concrete\nrecord. This Court can then address that under 1254.\nThe use of military commissions to try enemy\ncombatants has been part and parcel of the war power for\n200 years. Congress recognized it in 1916 in the Articles\nof War, then again, after World War II, in the UCMJ. This\nCourt recognized it in a host of cases, not just Quirin,\nbut Yamashita, Eisentrager, and, most clearly, in Madsen.\nSince that is such an important component of the law of\nwar, something that has been part and parcel of that power\nfrom Major Andre's capture to today, there is no reason\nfor this Court to depart from that tradition.\nThank you.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Clement.\nMr. Katyal.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL KATYAL\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. KATYAL: It is a foundational role of this\nCourt, as Justice Kennedy says, to test the lawfulness of\ntribunals, particularly executive detention. And in the\npretrial area, that's the historic role of this Court from\nBereford to Quirin. This claim is -- Mr. Hamdan's claim\nis primarily a jurisdictional one, as both courts below\nfound when they recognized his ability to bring this\npretrial challenge, because he is not an offender under\nthe laws of war until he obtains his article 5 hearing,\nbecause the charge doesn't state a violation of the laws\nof war, which is, itself, jurisdictional, and because it\ndoesn't follow the procedures of the laws of war, which\nthis Court, in Yamashita, in pages 5, and, in the dissent,\nat page 72, recognized as jurisdictional.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I don't want to --\nMR. KATYAL: Now, that was --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I don't want to take up from\nyour time, but have you read the footnote that the -- Mr.\nClement relies on very heavily?\nMR. KATYAL: With respect to conspiracy? Yes, I\nhave. And I do believe the text says that they're\nreferring to domestic offenses. It's certainly the case\nthat conspiracy has been tried as a violation of the laws\nof war at some point in the Civil War. But that has been\nentirely eclipsed by the modern laws of war, which have\nrejected it everywhere.\nAnd if you adopt the Government's reading,\nJustice Stevens, that the laws of war are frozen into time\nin 1916, then I believe there goes the Government's case\nentirely, because the thrust of the Government's case is\nthe laws of war have to adapt to this stateless,\nterritoryless organization known as al Qaeda. If we're\nplaying by 1916 rules, there is no way that this\ncommission would have been accepted in 1916.\nNow, all of those jurisdictional pretrial\nchallenges were accepted by the courts below when the full\npanoply of DTA rights -- when the full panoply of rights\nexisted. Now the DTA certainly circumscribes the scope.\nWe don't know whether question one very clearly is able to\nbe raised after the DTA's enactment. We certainly --\nquestion two, as the Solicitor General has said, is not\nraisable. We don't know when it can be raised, because\nthe President can block final review for all time under\nthe DTA. He has the keys to the Federal courthouse. And\nif you defer to this system and give the President the\nability to launch all of these tribunals for 75\nindividuals with these charges, with these procedures, you\nwill be countenancing a huge expansion of military\njurisdiction. Conspiracy is one of the few offenses,\nJustices, that has now been rejected by the laws of war\ninternationally in tribunal after tribunal. It's\ncertainly never been approved by a Federal Court. And,\nindeed, it has been rejected. In Colepaugh, for example,\nno challenge to conspiracy was raised.\nThe Government's argument, in the end, it seems\nto me, is one that this Court rejected in Loving, because\nit depends, as its predicate, on the idea that the\nPresident has ultimate flexibility with respect to these\nmilitary commissions, except for the nine provisions in\nthe UCMJ which govern translators and deposition\ntestimony. It is inconceivable that the UCMJ, when\nenacted, intended to regulate military commissions with\nonly that bare bones to it. Indeed, General Crowder said,\n\"Military commissions and courts-martial follow the same\nprocedures.\"\nFinally, Justices, we'd just point out that the\npredicate of abstention is not met here. This is not a\nordinary criminal trial applying lawful ordinary\nprocedures. This is an ad hoc trial in which the\nprocedures are all defined with the President. He says\nthe laws of war do not apply when we're talking about\nprotecting this vulnerable individual at Guantanamo. But\nthen he says they do apply and permit him to charge Mr.\nHamdan with the one offense which is rejected entirely at\ninternational law.\nIt was a great American patriot, Thomas Paine,\nwho warned, \"He who -- that would make his own liberty\nsecure must guard even his enemy from oppression, for if\nhe violates that duty, he establishes a precedent that\nwill reach unto himself.\"\nThat's what we're asking you to do here, just\nenforce the lawful uses of military commissions and the\nhistoric role of this Court.\nThank you.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Counsel.\n"
