DREEBEN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis Court has made clear that conspiracy is an\ninchoate offense, the essence of which is the agreement to\ncommit an unlawful act.\nQUESTION: What does the word inchoate mean? I\nrealize you're getting it from our opinions, but --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, I believe that\nit means an uncompleted offense, activities that have not\nyet progressed to the point of having violated a\nsubstantive provision of the criminal law, yet which\nrepresent a sufficient step to warrant legal intervention\nunder the doctrine of either attempt or conspiracy.\nQUESTION: It's the opposite of a choate\noffense, I assume, is it not?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes, Justice Scalia, except that\nword seems not to have appeared in this Court's opinions.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Or in the dictionary.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Well, it is in the dictionary. I'm\ngetting it in a minute. It will take me a minute to\nnoodle while I get it out of the dictionary.\nBut I -- I thought that it meant something\nthat's not yet formed.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, in the case of a conspiracy,\nJustice Kennedy --\nQUESTION: I thought that's what the word meant.\nMR. DREEBEN: It -- it may -- it means that\nwith --\nQUESTION: Incipient I suppose.\nMR. DREEBEN: -- with -- right. With reference\nto the object offense. So a conspiracy is an agreement to\ncommit an offense. The offense has not yet been formed.\nIt has not actually been realized, but the conspirators\nhave agreed to commit the offense.\nAnd the law of conspiracy deems it appropriate\nfor society to intervene at the stage at which the\nconspirators have entered into that agreement so as to\nprotect society against two things.\nQUESTION: And taken some act in furtherance of\nit?\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice O'Connor, under the drug\nstatute, this Court held in United States v. Shabani that\nthere is no requirement of proof of an overt act in order\nto punish a drug conspiracy.\nQUESTION: When does the conspiracy terminate,\nin your view?\nMR. DREEBEN: The conspiracy terminates, Justice\nO'Connor, either when the conspirators achieve the\nobjective that they have agreed to carry out, or when they\nhave abandoned efforts to do so. That fundamentally\nreflects the principle that the essence --\nQUESTION: Or when one of them has abandoned\nefforts. I mean, if -- if one of them leaves the\nconspiracy, I suppose you have a different conspiracy\nthen, or what?\nMR. DREEBEN: No, not automatically, Justice\nScalia.\nQUESTION: Suppose one of them knows that it's\nno longer possible and he leaves the conspiracy.\nMR. DREEBEN: That individual will -- in order\nto accomplish a withdrawal from the conspiracy has to do\nmore than simply leave it. The law of withdrawal of a --\non withdrawal from a conspiracy requires that the\nconspirator do some affirmative act to terminate the\nexistence of the conspiracy either by going to law\nenforcement, or by communicating to his fellow\nconspirators that he's done with the venture and he's out\nof it.\nBut the termination of the participation of one\nco-conspirator through withdrawal or abandonment or\ntelling law enforcement does not terminate the conspiracy.\nThe very nature of conspiracy is a group of individuals\nwho have come together to carry out an unlawful act, and\nin order for the conspiracy to do that, it frequently will\ngrow and enlarge its membership. Other members may drop\nout. But so long as there is a common agreement to commit\na definable crime or unlawful act, the conspiracy\ncontinues.\nQUESTION: What if all but one drop out? Does\na -- does a conspiracy continue as to that one?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, this Court has never\naddressed the question, and I could find no cases in the\ncommon law that had addressed the question. Certainly\nunder the common law, you cannot have a unilateral\nconspiracy, although the Model Penal Code would have\nallowed that.\nThere may, however, be policy reasons to hold\nthat once a conspirator has embarked upon his venture,\neven if all of the other conspirators are arrested and\ngive up the effort, that one lone conspirator who still\nsoldiers on, without knowing that the other conspirators\nhave abandoned it, might properly be held liable for\nseeking to accomplish the aims of the conspiracy.\nQUESTION: It's a conspiracy of one, so to\nspeak, right?\nMR. DREEBEN: If such an animal exists, it would\nbe a conspiracy in which all members but one have\nabandoned the objective.\nIn a case like this, however, where what happens\nis that two members of a multi-member conspiracy are\narrested, one of them becomes a Government agent, the\nother one perhaps does not -- and it's not clear that he\ndid abandon the efforts to accomplish the goals of the\nconspiracy -- but there are many others at large who are\ncontinuing to carry out the conspiracy, the criminal\nagreement persists.\nAnd where the Ninth Circuit got off on the wrong\nfoot was by believing that a conspiracy ends when its\ngoals have been defeated. When the object of the\nconspiracy has been defeated, the Ninth Circuit thought,\nthe conspiracy is over.\nThat, however, is contradictory to the\nfundamental principle of conspiracy law that the essence\nof the crime is the agreement between the parties to carry\nout an unlawful act, and to take the --\nQUESTION: Mr. Dreeben, what about --\nQUESTION: Would you -- would you tell me what\nthe conspiracy was that survived the -- the claimed end of\nthe conspiracy? What -- what -- conspiracy to do what?\nMR. DREEBEN: Conspiracy to distribute and\ndeliver marijuana and cocaine.\nQUESTION: Was it the marijuana and cocaine that\nhad already been seized by the Government, or some other\nmarijuana?\nMR. DREEBEN: As the case comes to this Court,\nthe conspiracy that survived was the conspiracy to\ndistribute that cocaine and marijuana that had been\nseized.\nBut what's crucial is that those conspirators\nwho remained liable were entirely unaware that the\nGovernment had intervened and frustrated the objective of\nthe conspiracy.\nAnd I think that the hypothetical that makes\nclear why the Ninth Circuit went wrong is the instance\nwhere the Government enters the market in a reverse sting\noperation and goes into the market as a seller, offering\nto sell drugs, and a collective of individuals decides to\npool their resources and arrange to purchase the drugs\nthat the Government is offering. It is highly likely that\nthe Government has no intention and never had any\nintention of delivering actual drugs. Therefore, the goal\nof the conspirators is frustrated at the inception. They\ndon't know it, but they could never accomplish the object\nof their conspiracy. Yet, it's settled in the Ninth\nCircuit and elsewhere that the conspirators can still be\nheld liable because their agreement to perform an act\nwhich, under the facts as they understand them, would be\nunlawful.\nQUESTION: And the difference between an attempt\nand the conspiracy, in the attempt you need a dangerous\nprobability of success or something along that line, but\nyou don't need that in a conspiracy case.\nMR. DREEBEN: That's correct. Conspiracy\nintervenes at an earlier stage, Justice Stevens. The\ntraditional Federal rule is that in an attempt, you need\nthe intent to perform the illegal act, plus a substantial\nstep towards its completion. The law of attempt has\nalways required a little bit more activity on the part of\nthe defendant before the Government can intervene and\npenalize it. And that's in part because of the need to\nhave some corroborating evidence that the defendant\nactually did intend to carry out an illegal act and to\navoid penalizing something as a thought crime.\nQUESTION: Mr. Dreeben, the first trial in this\ncase described a narrower conspiracy, did it not, than was\ninvolved in the second trial? And would you explain what\nthe difference was in the conspiracy charge initially\nmade, and the conspiracy charge in the second trial?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, the conspiracy charge,\nJustice Ginsburg, remained the same in both. In the --\nthe indictment was not changed. It was a single\nindictment that alleged the conspirators formed an\nagreement at a date unknown to the grand jury, but by\nNovember 18th, 1997, to distribute and possess with intent\nto distribute cocaine and marijuana.\nIn the original trial, the parties were unaware\nof the Ninth Circuit's decision in United States versus\nCruz, which forms the basis for the legal rule that the\nGovernment challenges here. And it, therefore, proceeded\non the -- what we believe to be the wholly correct theory\nthat respondents could be held liable for joining that\nconspiracy on November 19th when they agreed to become\ncouriers to move the drugs further down the road in Idaho.\nThey did not know that the drugs had actually been seized\nearlier by the Government and that the Government was\nwatching them. So the Ninth Circuit's ruling in Cruz\nmeant that what the Government had argued in the first\ncase no longer was sufficient to support conspiracy\nliability.\nQUESTION: Is -- is there a temporal component\nto your argument? If the initial defendants had been\narrested and detained for a month and then they got around\nto the sting operation, would it still be a conspiracy, or\ndoes it lapse after some reasonable time?\nMR. DREEBEN: It doesn't lapse through a period\nof time, Justice Kennedy. What could cause the conspiracy\nto end is the conspirators' wholly abandoning pursuit of\nthe objectives of the conspiracy. In other words, if all\nof the conspirators on the outside -- those who were in\nArizona on the sending end and those who were on Idaho on\nthe delivery end -- had all concluded that something has\ngone wrong with this shipment, the drugs have disappeared,\nthey could have abandoned the narrowest version of the\nconspiracy --\nQUESTION: But so long as one of the end\ndelivery people didn't know about it and thought that the\ndrugs were still on the way, he could continue to recruit\npeople and so forth even if the principals had been in\njail for a month and the drugs had been seized for a\nmonth?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, the people who were in jail\nwere the couriers, not the principals.\nQUESTION: Well, let's -- let's -- all right.\nBut even those -- some couriers had -- had been in jail.\nMR. DREEBEN: Correct, because so long as those\nindividuals who are involved in the conspiracy are still\ntrying to accomplish its objective, the conspiracy is\nstill alive. And as the -- as in the case of the\nGovernment sting where there's never any drugs in the\noutset, the conspiracy is impossible as a matter of fact\nfor the conspirators to successfully accomplish. But if\nit is accepted that that can be a crime, where there's a\nGovernment sting at the outset, then surely the\nGovernment's intervention in midstream doesn't\nautomatically terminate the conspiracy as a matter of law,\nwhich is what the Ninth Circuit held.\nQUESTION: Mr. --\nQUESTION: But explain again what you mean now?\nIf, instead of cocaine, it had been powdered sugar, can\nthere be a conspiracy conviction?\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice O'Connor, it would depend\non whether the powdered sugar is supplied by the\nGovernment under the representation that it is cocaine, or\nwhether the defendants are actually seeking to move\npowdered sugar knowing that they are seeking to move\npowdered sugar.\nQUESTION: No. They think they're -- they have\na load of cocaine and that was their intent, but\nunbeknownst to them, it's powdered sugar.\nMR. DREEBEN: Liability. Because the -- the\nquestion of conspiracy liability is judged by what the\nactor perceives to be the facts.\nQUESTION: How is that different from an\nagreement to receive stolen goods and then we find out\nthe -- goods are not stolen? That's -- that's not\nactionable I -- I had thought.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, it is the same, Justice\nKennedy, and -- and the uniform position in the Federal\ncourts is that it is. That would be a mistake of fact,\nand when the conspirators or the person who's attempting\nto commit a crime has the intent to commit a crime and\ntakes a substantial step for it, the fact that unbeknownst\nto him some aspect of the universe is such that he can't\ncomplete the crime does not defeat the accomplishment of\nthe objective.\nQUESTION: Well, if -- for a conspiracy\nconviction, I mean, because the whole -- the whole purpose\nis to prevent people banding together for wicked purposes,\nbut if -- if there's no conspiracy involved and he's\nmistaken in the fact, I assume there's no crime.\nMR. DREEBEN: No. The -- the modern rule,\nJustice Scalia, is that there is a crime. In this\ncountry, the earliest case that addressed it and the case\nthat all of us are familiar with from law school is People\nversus Jaffe, a New York Court of Appeals case from 1906.\nAnd that case did, indeed, hold -- as Justice Kennedy has\ndescribed it -- that if the person is receiving what he\nbelieves to be stolen goods and the goods are not stolen,\nhe is not liable.\nBut the modern focus on attempt law is on the\nintent of the actor to commit an illegal act, and the fact\nthat unbeknownst to him there are circumstances that\nprevent him from accomplishing the completed crime does\nnot defeat his liability for an attempt.\nIn other words, attempt law and conspiracy law\nhave, to an extent, converged on the policy that the\nimportance of inchoate crimes is to get at dangerous\nactors.\nQUESTION: What case would you cite to us for\nthis notion under attempt law? Is -- is there anything\nfrom this Court?\nMR. DREEBEN: There -- the only thing that there\nis from this Court, Justice O'Connor, are two opinions\nthat have addressed the obstruction of justice statute,\nOsborn versus United States and United States versus\nAguilar. In both of those cases, the Court was dealing\nwith a statute that didn't use the word attempt. It used\nthe word endeavor. And the Court made quite clear that\nthe impossibility of the defendant accomplishing the\nobjective of his crime doesn't defeat liability.\nIn Osborn, it was an individual who was\nattempting to bribe a juror. Unbeknownst to him, the\nintermediary, who he was using to pay the bribe, was\nworking with the FBI. And of course, the bribe was not\ngoing to be paid. The juror was not going to be\ncorrupted. And yet, the Court held that an endeavor to\ncommit the crime is punishable.\nQUESTION: Does the Model -- Model Penal Code\ntake a position on this?\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes. The Model Penal Code goes\nvery far in the direction of the intent-based focus of\nattempt law and conspiracy law. In the Model Penal Code,\nthere is no defense for impossibility of any kind, fact or\nlaw.\nWhat the Model Penal Code does, however, is\nallow, in certain extreme cases that it wasn't able to\ncraft a principle for, a power to a judge to either reduce\nthe grade of a crime or to dismiss it.\nAnd the Model Penal Code was thinking about\nhypotheticals which have not come up in any cases that --\nthat anyone has actually found, such as where an\nindividual believes that he can kill through incantations\nand voodoo and sets about to do so. Under an orthodox,\ndoctrinaire approach to principles of attempt law, that\nindividual has the intent to kill, and has carried out a\nsubstantial step. Many commentators have said that should\nnot occasion liability because it's inherently impossible\nthat the actor will achieve his goal and in reality that\nperson is probably not a dangerous individual who warrants\npunishment.\nQUESTION: Well, what -- what's the difference\nbetween being inherently impossible and the other kinds of\nimpossibility?\nMR. DREEBEN: Only a matter of degree, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and for that reason, the Model Penal Code\nrejected a legal rule that would carve out inherent\nimpossibility and said that it's really something that\nshould go to whether a judge should reduce the grade of a\ncrime or dismiss it.\nOur position is that that sort of --\nQUESTION: Okay -- or dismiss it. They -- they\njust leave it up to the judge? It's a crime or not\ndepending upon -- is there any other instance where the\nModel Penal Code does this sort of thing?\nMR. DREEBEN: I don't know if there are any\nother instances where the Model Penal Code does it, but\nour position is that the sounder approach is to --\nQUESTION: Extraordinary.\nMR. DREEBEN: -- leave those cases in the hands\nof prosecutorial discretion and the common sense of\njuries. The fact is that there really are no\nhypotheticals in real cases that resemble the killer by\nincantation.\nQUESTION: What did the Ninth Circuit rely on in\nUnited States versus Cruz? If -- if the law is as uniform\nas you say it is, what -- what did they rely on? They\nmust have relied on something.\nMR. DREEBEN: The Ninth Circuit, I believe, made\na -- a linguistic mistake. There are an abundance of\ncases that say that a conspiracy ends when its goal is\neither accomplished or defeated, and those cases, read in\ncontext, mean that if the conspirators actually abandon\ntheir efforts to complete the crime, or all of them are\narrested and they're in custody and they're really not in\na position to go forward anymore, the conspiracy ends at\nthat point.\nAnd frequently that sort of a determination is\nmade for purposes of the admission of co-conspirator\nstatements under 801(d)(2)(E). You want to know whether\nthe conspiracy is alive so you can determine whether to\nadmit post-arrest statements by one conspirator against\nanother conspirator. And in those cases, it makes perfect\nsense to say that the conspiracy ended when all of the\nco-conspirators are arrested and have given up.\nThe Ninth Circuit took that language -- the\nlanguage referring to the defeat of the object of the\nconspiracy -- and took it literally, and the effect was to\ncreate a defense of factual impossibility. And the court\nactually used those words. It was factually impossible\nfor the conspirators to complete their crime. Therefore,\nthe conspiracy was over as a matter of law.\nQUESTION: Is it the case -- four conspirators,\nA, B, C, D. A is arrested, out on bail. A makes a few\nstatements which are overheard. Can you admit that\nhearsay against B, C, D, who are later found?\nMR. DREEBEN: It all depends, Justice Breyer, on\nwhether --\nQUESTION: I thought they couldn't.\nMR. DREEBEN: -- on whether he's still\nattempting to achieve the goal of the conspiracy. There\nare a -- a number --\nQUESTION: You say, would -- in that --\nnormally -- normally a person who's arrested, that ends\nthe conspiracy as to that person, doesn't it, at least\nnormally?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, not -- not necessarily,\nJustice Breyer. In this case, for example, one of the two\narrested couriers, Sotelo, reportedly told Arce, the other\narrested co-conspirator, that they should both tell a lie\nto the authorities and then try to escape. I mean,\nthat --\nQUESTION: No, I'm not thinking of that. I'm\nthinking it is an -- there -- there is no reason to\nthink -- all we know about him is he's arrested and he\nhappens to mention something to a neighbor that has\nnothing to do -- who has nothing to do with the\nconspiracy. This statement is not made in furtherance of\nany conspiracy.\nMR. DREEBEN: Correct.\nQUESTION: It's simply made after A is arrested.\nAs far as we know, A has nothing further to do with it.\nMR. DREEBEN: That's correct. So long as the\nstatement isn't made in furtherance --\nQUESTION: But -- that shows -- in other words,\nthat shows what? That shows that although the conspiracy\nin your view continues -- B, C, D -- but A has withdrawn?\nIs that what it shows?\nMR. DREEBEN: No. What it may show is that the\nstatement wasn't made in furtherance of the conspiracy.\nIf he's simply talking to his neighbor, it may not be\ndoing anything to carry out the aims of the conspiracy.\nIf, on the other hand --\nQUESTION: Inadmissible, in other words, even if\nA has never been arrested?\nMR. DREEBEN: Right. The statement to be\nadmitted as a statement of a co-conspirator must be both\nduring the course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy.\nSo to continue your hypothetical, if you suppose that\nA comes out, and then tries to communicate through\nintermediaries that he knows where the drugs are and that\npeople should take efforts to secrete them before the\nauthorities seize them, then that statement could be\nadmitted as a co-conspirator's declaration.\nQUESTION: Mr. Dreeben, could we just clarify\nthis particular case? Why the -- the date of the 18th\nwhen the two people involved -- the proof as to them goes\nonly from the next day on? And why the -- their\nconspiracy starts the day that the drugs are seized.\nRight?\nMR. DREEBEN: Correct.\nQUESTION: Although the larger conspiracy that\nthey're part of began presumably much before that.\nMR. DREEBEN: Actually, I -- I think the -- the\nway the case comes to this Court, the involvement of the\ntwo couriers begins on November 19th, the day after the\ndrugs are seized, when they're recruited.\nQUESTION: Yes, but they're charged with a\nconspiracy dating from the 18th. Is that right?\nMR. DREEBEN: That's right. That's right.\nQUESTION: Although they don't enter the picture\nuntil the 19th.\nMR. DREEBEN: As the case comes to this Court,\nthat's right. When -- when the case was charged, the\nparties weren't focusing on Cruz and the case was just\ncharged in the way conspiracies normally are; namely, the\ngrand jury alleges that the conspiracy came into existence\nby a particular date when it could be certain that it did\ncome into existence. It may have come into existence\nearlier, and the grand jury's charge says from a date\nuncertain, but at least by November 18, there was a\nconspiracy in place and the following four individuals\nwere -- are to be charged as co-conspirators, plus others\nunknown to the grand jury.\nNow, in light of the way the facts actually\npanned out at -- at the trial, and given the holdings of\nthe Ninth Circuit that the Government failed to prove\npre-seizure involvement on the part of the respondent\ncouriers, the indictment might have more accurately been\nwritten to say that on November 18th, at least, a\nconspiracy was formed, and by November 19th the\nrespondents joined it. The --\nQUESTION: Could the Government have charged a\nseparate, second conspiracy if it had chosen to do so?\nMR. DREEBEN: I don't think so, Justice Kennedy,\nbecause the crucial aspect of a conspiracy and a defining,\nlimiting principle is the scope of the nature of the\nagreement. Courts have worked out a multi-factor test to\ndetermine whether you have one agreement or two\nagreements. And it focuses not on literal identity of\nmembership or complete chronological co-existence of the\nparticipation of each conspirator, but whether there's a\ncommon agreement which each is seeking to advance forward\nin his own way and whether the excess of one is dependent\non the efforts of the others.\nNow, in this case, construed most narrowly, the\nindictment alleges a conspiracy to move drugs, staring in\nPhoenix, Arizona, through Las Vegas, and all the way up to\nIdaho and then perhaps beyond that. That is the\nconspiracy in which respondents were involved as\nsubstitute couriers brought in to move the truck from the\nKarcher Mall in Idaho to its ultimate destination. That's\nthe same conspiracy that existed at the outset. The\noriginal couriers, had they not been arrested, would have\ncompleted the trip. So what you have is one common\nagreement in which all participants are working to achieve\nthe same goal, and there is only a switch of two members,\nthe two couriers, midstream --\nQUESTION: But you were going back to -- I think\nyou hadn't completed your answer to why it's okay that\neven though the proof as to these two defendants starts on\nthe 19th, not on the 18th, it's okay to have the\nindictment say they were participants from the 18th.\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Ginsburg, if you read the\nindictment as alleging that they were involved on the 18th\nand we didn't show that they were involved until the\n19th -- and as the case comes to this Court, that's what\nwe showed -- you have a variance between the allegations\nof the indictment and the proof at trial. And the settled\nlaw on variances is that it is no defense for a defendant\nif the proof varies from the conspiracy charged in the\nindictment so long as the conspiracy that's proved up is\nwithin the scope of the indictment, a lesser included\nconspiracy, so to speak, and the defendants suffer no\nprejudice from the variation.\nNow, in this case, everyone knew from the outset\nthat the centerpiece of the Government's proof against\nrespondents was going to be the observation of them\ndriving up after the call was placed to the Arizona\nsupplier of the drugs and getting into the truck and\ndriving the truck away down the highway in Idaho,\nfollowing which they were stopped and gave completely\nunbelievable stories about what they were doing driving\naround with a truck filled with drugs. There was no\nprejudice to the defendants in defending against a\nconspiracy that was proved up based on the events of\nthe 18th because those events were always going to be at\nthe heart of the Government's proof that they were liable.\nSo absent a showing of prejudice, the variance between the\nallegations of the indictment and the proof at trial does\nnot warrant any relief.\nQUESTION: But your -- your principal argument\nis not in response to variance. It's simply that on\nthe 19th they became -- excuse me -- they became part of a\nconspiracy that had begun at least by the 18th.\nMR. DREEBEN: That's correct.\nQUESTION: That's -- that's the essence of your\nposition.\nMR. DREEBEN: That's -- the essence of our\nargument is that -- and the Ninth Circuit in ruling that\nthe evidence was insufficient did not rely on principles\nof variance or principles of multiple conspiracies or any\nother fact-based, record-based analysis that would show\nthat the Government didn't prove the conspiracy alleged in\nthe indictment.\nWhat the Ninth Circuit relied on was its holding\nin Cruz which is that a conspiracy ends when the\nGovernment intervenes and renders its completion\nimpossible. And the Ninth Circuit, therefore, reasoned\nthat respondents could not have joined the conspiracy\nalleged in the indictment because that conspiracy was, as\na factual matter, over. Accordingly, the only way on the\nNinth Circuit's view that the Government could win this\ncase is if the Government showed that respondents joined\nthe conspiracy before the seizure of the drugs, or if they\nwere involved in a broader conspiracy that involved other\ndrugs. Only under those two assumptions did the Ninth\nCircuit think that the Government could prevail.\nAnd the Ninth Circuit held that the evidence was\nnot sufficient to prove either of those other\nconspiratorial activities. It never questioned that the\nevidence was overwhelming to prove a conspiracy to\nparticipate in the distribution of drugs on November 19th,\nwhen respondents showed up and got in the truck.\nAnd because the Ninth Circuit was wrong in its\nholding that a conspiracy terminates when it becomes\nfactually impossible of accomplishment, the rest of its\nanalysis also crumbles.\nI'd like to save the remainder of my time for\nrebuttal.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Dreeben.\nMr. Shurtliff, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF M. KARL SHURTLIFF\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. SHURTLIFF: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please\nthe Court, counsel:\nMr. Sullivan and I expect that we were not\ninvited here to argue our view that the case below was\ndecided on the sufficiency of the evidence question.\nHowever, having said that, we would not wish to have it\ntaken that we abandon that argument.\nMr. Chief Justice, a number of the questions\nposed seemed to go to the heart of what this case is\nabout. Justice Stevens asked, what was the conspiracy\nthat survived?\nThe Government argues at length in the brief and\nhere today that -- notwithstanding the charge in the\nindictment and the trial of this case below -- that by\nNovember 18th, 1997, Mr. Recio and Mr. Lopez-Mesa could be\ncharged with the crime. The fact of the matter is, is\nthat the indictment framed what this case was about by\nNovember 18th.\nQUESTION: Well, Mr. Shurtliff, the only\nquestion presented in the petition for certiorari is\nwhether a conspiracy ends as a matter of law when the\nGovernment frustrates its objective. Now is -- is -- are\nwhat you're about to say going to deal with that question?\nMR. SHURTLIFF: It is, Mr. Chief Justice,\nbecause that's the argument that the Government makes that\nwe should not sustain the Ninth Circuit decision in this\ncase as framed by Judge Browning who formulated the\ndecision.\nQUESTION: Well, but the Government formulated\nthe question here.\nMR. SHURTLIFF: I -- I understand that,\nMr. Chief Justice, and -- and we do speak to that.\nThe -- the question was posed, What conspiracy\nsurvives, and I'm suggesting that no conspiracy survived,\nand that the answer is, is that the Government framed the\ncase as they would have it and that the issues that the\nGovernment talks about here today and in their brief at\nlength as to when the -- these two late-comers to the\nconspiracy enter -- came into it -- obscures that notion.\nYour Honor -- or Mr. Chief Justice, the -- the\nquestion posited in the -- in the petition for certiorari,\nwith all due respect, I don't think has been really argued\nhere much today by the Government. The -- the question is\ncorrectly whether a conspiracy ends as a matter of law\nwhen the Government frustrates its objective.\nThat is taken from the formulation of former\nChief Judge Browning in this case below that he -- all\nthey said was -- in describing the case here and referring\nback to Cruz -- in Cruz we ruled that a defendant could\nnot be charged with conspiracy to distribute illegal drugs\nwhen the defendant was brought into the drug scheme only\nafter the law enforcement authorities had already\nintervened and defendant's involvement was prompted by\nthat intervention.\nThe Ninth Circuit didn't say that this was an\nimpossibility case, that it was impossible for the\nconspiracy to continue as to other people. What the Ninth\nCircuit said in that case was in these circumstances -- in\nthese limited circumstances, in Cruz and in Recio -- that\ngiven the Government intervention in the objective of the\nconspiracy, given the Government intervention and the\ninvitation after that to join the conspiracy by Recio and\nLopez, that they couldn't join the conspiracy. It was a\nnew --\nQUESTION: Why would impossibility caused by the\nGovernment be any different from impossibility caused by\nsomebody else? You -- you want to reframe -- you -- you\nthink that we could answer this question no, but still\nfind for your clients because this is not just\nimpossibility simpliciter, this is impossibility produced\nby the Government.\nMR. SHURTLIFF: I think, Mr. Justice Scalia,\nthat you could answer the question no and still find for\nour clients because this is not the case. This is not why\nthey were -- the Ninth Circuit reversed their convictions.\nThe --\nQUESTION: There wasn't impossibility at all?\nMR. SHURTLIFF: There wasn't impossibility.\nQUESTION: What was it?\nMR. SHURTLIFF: It was termination. They\nadded -- typically and historically --\nQUESTION: Well, why was it terminated? It was\nterminated -- people didn't write notes to each other\nsaying, you know, Let's call off the conspiracy. It was\nterminated, the Ninth Circuit found, because its object\nwas no longer possible. I thought that's why they found\nit had terminated.\nMR. SHURTLIFF: The object, Mr. Justice Scalia,\nwas -- was frustrated by the Government intervention.\nThe --\nQUESTION: But the Government's position is\nthere's only two ways a conspiracy can end. One we know\nis not this case. They didn't succeed. The other, the\nGovernment says, is that the conspirators have to abandon\nit, not that it becomes -- there's an impediment to its\ncompletion, but abandonment by one person, if she\nwithdraws from the conspiracy and tells the police, for\nexample, or tells the co-conspirators. But an\nimpediment -- another impediment -- doesn't stop the\nconspiracy from persisting.\nAnd the Ninth Circuit I thought pretty clearly\nsaid, Yes, it does, and that -- wasn't there rather sharp\ndisagreement among the Ninth Circuit judges over this?\nThey didn't treat it as a question of sufficiency of the\nevidence.\nMR. SHURTLIFF: Indeed, Justice Ginsburg, there\nwas sharp disagreement. Justice -- Judge O'Scannlain and\neight other members of the court dissented from the -- not\ngranting the rehearing en banc.\nHowever, what -- the point I seek to make, not\nvery well, apparently -- is -- is that what the court\nbelow did not say was that it was impossible to have a\nconspiracy, but that they added to abandonment and\naccomplishment a new ability to frustrate or end the\nconspiracy. That is Government -- and -- and narrowly.\nGovernment intervention that frustrates its objective and\nthat Government intervention invited the new participants\ninto it.\nAnd Justice Ginsburg, you -- you inquired as to\nwhat -- or, Justice O'Connor, as to the -- as to the --\nwhat the Model Penal Code might say about that. And I\nwould suggest that in that regard, Wharton, in describing\nthat, said -- suggests that the Model Penal court -- Code\nsuggests the position that if the conduct is, quote, \"so\ninherently unlikely to result or culminate in the\ncommission of a crime that no public danger is presented\nwarranting defendant's punishment as a conspirator.\"\nAnd I think that's what the Ninth Circuit was\nsaying in this case, that if we look at this historical\npurposes of conspiracy -- and the Government has well\ntraversed that in its briefs and its reply brief -- that\nthe gist, the gravamen of a conspiracy is the\ncombination that -- to agree to do something.\nMr. Justice Kennedy, you inquired whether to do\nsomething that's not illegal is -- can be a conspiracy,\nand I suggest that that -- that's part of what brings us\nhere is the confusion as to when you can and cannot and\nought not have a conspiracy.\nQUESTION: Well --\nQUESTION: But there -- there is a public danger\npresented by people who band together to rob a bank even\nwhen there is no money in the bank. It's utterly\nimpossible. Right? That -- that's quite different from\nthe -- the unquestionable fact that there's no public\ndanger presented by people who band together to curse\nsomebody with -- with a voodoo doll. You can say, well,\nyou know, That's a harmless conspiracy, but a conspiracy\nto rob a bank is not harmless. These are bad people, and\nif they don't do this bank, they may do another bank.\nNow, you acknowledge that that is a conspiracy\neven though there -- a criminal conspiracy even though\nthere's no money in the bank. Right?\nMR. SHURTLIFF: Indeed, Justice Scalia.\nQUESTION: But you say it does -- it is not a\ncriminal conspiracy if the reason there is no money in --\nin the bank is that the Government has removed the money\nfrom the bank knowing that there's going to be a -- a\nbreak-in?\nMR. SHURTLIFF: There would be no conspiracy if\nthe Government had intervened in that conspiracy early on\nand the involvement of the participants charged was only\nas a result of that involvement.\nQUESTION: So if the Government took the money\nout of the bank, that would be different than if there was\njust no money there from the outset.\nMR. SHURTLIFF: I'd think not, Mr. Justice\nScalia. I think the -- the question would be what the --\nwhat the participants who were engaged to participate\nin -- in the robbing of the bank thought.\nQUESTION: They -- well, in both cases they\nthought there was money in the bank. In one case, they\nwere wrong because there was never money in the bank. It\nwas a blood bank. Okay?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SHURTLIFF: And --\nQUESTION: In the second case, there was no\nmoney in the bank because the Government, anticipating\na -- a robbery, had removed it. And you say that there's\nsomething different about the second case.\nMR. SHURTLIFF: I -- I don't think there's\nanything different, Justice Scalia --\nQUESTION: Okay. I don't think so either.\nQUESTION: Then what is your reason? I'm just\ntrying to get -- A, B, C, and D form a conspiracy to\ndeprive a person of civil rights, to rob a bank, to commit\nan act of terrorism, whatever. They do it on January 1.\nOn March -- in March, a Government agent infiltrates. Now\nit'll fail. In April three more people join. All right?\nNow, why should the law not be those three\npeople are just as guilty as anybody else?\nMR. SHURTLIFF: Mr. Justice Breyer, they can be,\nand they ought to be depending on the facts of the case,\nand that's why the --\nQUESTION: The facts of the case are just what I\nsaid. Now what?\nMR. SHURTLIFF: I think -- I think they're\nguilt -- they -- I think they -- they're in on the\nconspiracy.\nQUESTION: You think they're guilty. Okay.\nMR. SHURTLIFF: They're guilty of the\nconspiracy.\nQUESTION: They're guilty and they joined\nafter --\nMR. SHURTLIFF: Whether they're guilty or not is\nanother question.\nQUESTION: No, no. I'm -- all the facts are\njust as I say.\nSo, they're guilty, and now what they did is,\nafter all, join it after the infiltration of the\nGovernment agent made it absolutely certain there would be\nno success.\nAll right. Now, how is that different than the\nfacts before us?\nMR. SHURTLIFF: Because the facts before us are\nthat these two individuals joined at the behest of the\nGovernment, and that they were charged and tried for\nactivity before the date of November 18th, 1997. They\nwere -- the -- the Government's focus on this case was\nnarrow. They weren't charged. And one of the\nquestions --\nQUESTION: Now -- now I take -- you say, number\none, you take my hypothetical and say, but the Government\n-- what did the Government do that was different from the\nhypothetical? The Government --\nMR. SHURTLIFF: Intervened.\nQUESTION: Intervened. Yes, I got that.\nMR. SHURTLIFF: Frustrated.\nQUESTION: They joined it.\nMR. SHURTLIFF: They frustrated the objective of\nthe conspiracy --\nQUESTION: That's true in my hypothetical too.\nNow what?\nMR. SHURTLIFF: And then they encouraged the\nparticipation by their intervention of the --\nQUESTION: Oh, they led. I see. The Government\nled my three extra people to join.\nMR. SHURTLIFF: Indeed.\nQUESTION: So you're saying it's like an\nentrapment.\nMR. SHURTLIFF: It's -- it's similar to, but\ndifferent --\nQUESTION: No, no. It's not quite as strong as\nan entrapment. So what you're argument is, is that where\nthe Government has joined, thereby frustrating the\nobjective, and in addition brings about the circumstances\nthrough which the later membership, A, B -- of my three\nextra people take place, that's close enough to\nentrapment, plus the fact that the conspiracy can't\nexceed -- can't succeed. Put those two things together\nand you have grounds for not convicting.\nMR. SHURTLIFF: And you have --\nQUESTION: Is that the argument?\nMR. SHURTLIFF: And you have this case,\nMr. Justice Breyer.\nQUESTION: And all right, and you have this\ncase. But -- so it's like a -- a mix. It's like an\nimpossibility/entrapment mix. That's the argument.\nMR. SHURTLIFF: Well, I -- I'm not --\nQUESTION: I'm not ridiculing the argument. I'm\ntrying to understand it. It's a -- it's an interesting\nargument.\nQUESTION: Is that what the Ninth Circuit said?\nThat -- this argument you're making -- is that the basis\non which the Ninth Circuit held that this -- this\nconviction couldn't stand?\nI thought it was just simply, you know, whether\nthey were enticed in or not. The mere fact that -- the\nmere fact that it was no longer possible to execute the --\nthe conspiracy was enough.\nMR. SHURTLIFF: Mr. Justice -- or Justice\nScalia, I -- I don't think that they got to the notion of\nentrapment or enticement, and -- and that's -- I think\nthat -- and so I can't say that -- that that's part of the\npredicate for how they got where they got -- went in this\ncase. I think they focused on the Government intervention\nand the Government involvement without calling it the\ntypical terms of entrapment --\nQUESTION: It relied on Cruz, and in Cruz it\nsaid it extends -- the court said it extends conspiracy\nliability beyond reasonable limits to say that it\ncontinues when the product can no longer be delivered and\nall that remains is for a new recruit to be added.\nBut there is no reason given for that in -- in\nCruz. There must be some legal doctrine that it rests\nupon. Impossibility or entrapment are the -- are the two\ncategories that we know.\nMR. SHURTLIFF: I --\nQUESTION: This is something else. I --\nMR. SHURTLIFF: Mr. Justice Kennedy, I think --\nI think the question was similarly asked to -- to the\nGovernment, and I -- I would probably agree with their\nanswer. I think they relied on Castro, a predecessor case\nfrom the Ninth Circuit, and then they relied on another\ncase.\nI think what happened -- I don't know -- was is\nthat -- like many of us, the more you study the area of\nconspiracy, I think the more confused you get. And I\nthink that's what Justice Jackson was talking about, and I\nwould urge that we consider what he said because I think\nthey -- they blended in and it's different -- it's hard to\ndichotomize between impossibility and termination and\nmultiple --\nQUESTION: Well, I don't -- I don't know what's\nconfusing about having people with a criminal intent\nwho -- who join a conspiracy with the intent to violate\nthe law being called conspirators. That's not -- it\ndoesn't sound like rocket science to me.\nMR. SHURTLIFF: But, Mr. Justice Kennedy, the --\nthe -- in Cruz, he was invited to join the conspiracy\nafter -- only after -- the Government was sitting there\nwith the drugs and he was a late recruit to the process.\nHe wasn't an early conspirator. In this case, these\npersons were invited to join only after the Government had\nfully intervened. They could have stopped it then. The\nonly activity was to get new recruits.\nAnd what the Ninth Circuit said in both cases --\nthey didn't say they couldn't be charged with a new\nconspiracy. They could have been charged with it.\nIndeed, they left that open in both Cruz and here. They\ncould have been charged in a new conspiracy for the\nactivities that they engaged in.\nQUESTION: Well, you think that this\ndefendant -- these defendants could have been charged in a\nnew conspiracy? It seems that -- that undercuts your\nargument. I thought the whole purpose of this argument\nwas to have some reasonable confines on how long a\nconspiracy can exist after everybody knows it's not going\nto go forward. And now you say there was a second\nconspiracy that could have been charged?\nMR. SHURTLIFF: I think they could have been\ncharged with a second conspiracy starting on the 19th.\nThey weren't charged. I -- I --\nQUESTION: Mr. Dreeben said that was a variance\nwhether it was the -- they joined on the 18th or the 19th.\nThe question is what did they join, and why should it make\na difference?\nMR. SHURTLIFF: It should --\nQUESTION: If these defendants didn't know there\nhad been any seizure, why should it -- why should their\nguilt turn on that factor? As far as they're concerned,\nthis is a truck that has gotten by the Government's\nsurveillance.\nMR. SHURTLIFF: Justice Ginsburg, the -- the\nquestion of variance is another one of those little things\nthat pop up and confuse some of us.\nBut the issue in this case, there was no\nvariance because the Government said, we indict you for\nactivity by November 18th, 1997. The prosecutor stood\nbefore the jury in his opening and his closing. The\ninstructions all went to the issue, We will show that\nthese persons were engaged in this activity for either a\nsingle load -- the load at issue -- or that they were\nmembers of a larger conspiracy before November 18th, 1997.\nQUESTION: But that's not --\nMR. SHURTLIFF: That's not variance.\nQUESTION: -- that's -- that's not part of the\nquestion before this Court. The question before this\nCourt is whether a conspiracy ends as a matter of law when\nthe Government frustrates its objective. And whether\nthere might be some other grounds that the Ninth Circuit\nmight have decided it on, that is not before us.\nMR. SHURTLIFF: And as to that issue, Mr. Chief\nJustice, as we said it in our briefs and I said it in my\nbrief specifically, I believe, that the policy that's come\ndown through the -- through the -- conspiracy is not that\nold -- that there is no good reason why the answer to that\nquestion ought not be yes, that a -- that a -- it is\nterminated as absolutely as if the conspiracy were\nabandoned or if it were accomplished because there is no\ngood -- there is no chance of it being successful.\nThere's no chance of the unified activity creating the\ndangers that we speak of and -- when we're -- when we're\ntrying to combat conspiracy.\nQUESTION: And that -- and that would follow --\nthat would also be true if the project was impossible from\nthe outset. Right? That -- I mean, that's what I don't\nunderstand. You -- you say if -- if they enter in a --\ninto a conspiracy to rob a bank in which there is no\nmoney, that can be prosecuted. Right?\nMR. SHURTLIFF: It has been, Mr. --\nQUESTION: Well, I know it has been, you say.\nBut it can -- but it can be.\nMR. SHURTLIFF: Surely. Surely.\nQUESTION: Well, why doesn't that violate your\nprinciple? You say there's no harm done there either.\nThere is just as -- just as much no concrete harm that\ncould have been done there except the harm of wicked\npeople banding together, which is what -- what the crime\nof conspiracy is directed against. Why should it make any\ndifferent -- difference whether the impossibility exists\nfrom the outset, or whether -- whether it -- it occurs\nlater in the scheme. What -- why does that make any\ndifference?\nMR. SHURTLIFF: I think it probably should not\nmake much difference --\nQUESTION: No, I don't think so.\nMR. SHURTLIFF: -- in a lot of cases, but I\nthink each case is fact-specific, Mr. Justice Scalia. And\nI think in this case you have to look at what was charged,\nwhat was tried, and what the conspiracy was about. And --\nQUESTION: May I ask? Are the -- are the\ninstructions to the jury in the papers before us?\nMR. SHURTLIFF: I'm not real -- I'm not -- I'm\nnot really sure, Mr. Justice Stevens.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. SHURTLIFF: The -- the -- we didn't do an\nexcerpt for the record. I think it's in the petition for\ncertiorari.\nQUESTION: The instructions are in the petition?\nMR. SHURTLIFF: Some of them are referred to. I\ndon't know that we've listed -- I don't think all of the\ninstructions are in the record here.\nThe -- the instruction as to the conspiracy.\nAnd that's how it was charged that it -- that they had to\nbelong before or after -- before and not after.\nThe --\nQUESTION: It says that the conspiracy began on\nor about that date, but then it says the defendants became\nmember. It doesn't say the date the defendants became\nmember.\nQUESTION: Why don't you proceed with your\nargument?\nMR. SHURTLIFF: Thank -- thank you.\nThe issues here raise difficult questions. The\nwhole area of conspiracy raises difficult questions of\ninterpretation and -- and law. I suggest, and we suggest\nthat the decision below is not as far-reaching as it might\notherwise appear, that Justice Browning formulated a\nresult in this case that's much narrower than what we're\nabout.\nBut on the other hand, having said that, and\nbeing here, the question is whether the Government\nintervention in these circumstances, in these extant\ncircumstances, ought end the opportunity and the ability\nto join a conspiracy. We simply urge that frustration of\nthe purpose of the -- by the Government -- invitation to\njoin by the Government in these circumstances is no less\nor is no more in keeping with the termination of the\nconspiracy than would be had they -- some of the people\nabandoned the conspiracy or had it been accomplished.\nThe Government argues that the answer to this\nquestion, if we answered it in the affirmative, would\nraise havoc with our ability to prosecute these kinds of\ncases. We would suggest that that's not the instance\nhere. Here in -- here and in Cruz, as near as we can\ntell, Cruz has been cited once; this case not at all.\nIt's not a set of circumstances that are likely to reoccur\noften or with great --\nQUESTION: Suppose in this -- suppose in this\ncase the truck had been apprehended in Arizona, and\nneither of the participants at that point cooperated with\nthe police except to tell the police that their\ninstructions were to drive the truck to a certain place.\nThen without any Government intervention in calling Recio\nand his buddy -- Recio and -- and his co-defendant show up\nwithout any Government intervention. So we have the\nGovernment seizure, just as you do in this case, but the\nscenario plays out just as it was arranged without any\nGovernment intervention. In that case, would you say that\nthe -- that the conspiracy continued and these people are\nproperly prosecuted?\nMR. SHURTLIFF: Yes.\nQUESTION: May I ask --\nMR. SHURTLIFF: But that's not what happened\nhere. The -- the -- they were intercepted --\nQUESTION: You're making it turn on the\nGovernment having a part in bringing in the latecomers.\nMR. SHURTLIFF: And -- and I -- I retreat again\nto the -- what they were charged with and what the\nindictment was and what they -- that we will prove that\nthey were involved by November 18th, 1997. We will prove\nthat. That's what this case is about. That's what they\nkept saying and they argued that throughout.\nNow, here they want to suggest that -- that by\ngoing to the 19th, it provokes no prejudice on the part of\nthe defendants. That's not the case they were charged\nwith. That's not the case that was tried below. And so,\nin your hypothetical, Justice Ginsburg, I think yes, but\nthere was no involvement and -- and depending on how they\nwere charged. And I --\nQUESTION: Counsel, it -- it looks like the\ninstruction to the jury said that a defendant may only be\nfound guilty of the conspiracy charged in the indictment\nif he joined the conspiracy at a time when it was possible\nto achieve the objective of that conspiracy. Was that the\ninstruction given them?\nMR. SHURTLIFF: It was, Justice O'Connor.\nQUESTION: So that means the jury must have\nfound that -- that there was evidence sufficient to say\nthey joined before the impossibility occurred.\nMR. SHURTLIFF: Indeed.\nQUESTION: Did the Government object to that\ninstruction, do you know?\nMR. SHURTLIFF: No. The Government supported\nthat, Mr. Justice Stevens.\nQUESTION: What should happen if the trial judge\nfaithfully followed Cruz? And under Cruz, the jury should\nnot have found him liable, but we say that Cruz is wrong.\nDoes it still have to go back for a new trial?\nBecause the -- on page 76a of the appendix, the\ninstructions seem to say that -- one of two things. You\ncan only find him guilty of the conspiracy if he joined it\nprior to 1:18 a.m. on November 18th. On the other hand,\nif you find there's a larger conspiracy, you can find him\nguilty, but that larger conspiracy must be to distribute\nother drugs than those that were seized. So I -- I\nsuppose the proof doesn't support either of those\nconspiracies.\nMR. SHURTLIFF: And -- and that, Mr. Justice\nKennedy, is what the Ninth Circuit said, that it doesn't\nsupport either the single load --\nQUESTION: What happens if we think this\ninstruction was wrong? Under the evidence, the defendants\nshould have been convicted, and that Cruz is wrong. Do we\nstill have to send it back?\nMR. SHURTLIFF: I think, Mr. Justice Kennedy,\nyou send it back to the Ninth Circuit for a determination\nwhether, but for a decision that Cruz is incorrectly\napplied in the facts in this case, would the decision\nbelow remain the same.\nAnd I suggest, with all due respect to the\nGovernment's position in this case, that the -- that it\ncould be concluded that notwithstanding the application of\nCruz in the Ninth Circuit below, that the decision of the\nNinth Circuit could by -- almost by redacting it,\neliminating the references to Cruz -- come to the same\nconclusion. The evidence was just simply insufficient to\nsustain the conviction for either the single load or the\nmulti-load before November 18th.\nQUESTION: Of course --\nQUESTION: Assuming Cruz is right. Assuming\nCruz is right.\nQUESTION: I'm assuming Cruz is wrong, and then\nit would seem to me the evidence is fully sufficient to\nconvict if Cruz is wrong because it doesn't make any\ndifference if they joined it before or after 1:18 a.m. on\nthe 18th.\nQUESTION: Can I ask another question? Is\nthere -- is it conceivable that the jury found that the\nevidence after the impossibility was sufficient to sustain\nthe verdict? Because they weren't asked to find that.\nI mean, I don't -- as I understand Mr. Dreeben's\nargument, there was plenty of evidence later on, that they\njoined the -- they joined an ongoing conspiracy, but the\ncharge didn't ask them to find that, as I -- maybe\nMr. Dreeben will comment on it in his rebuttal. I --\nMR. SHURTLIFF: I -- I think that's entirely\ncorrect, Justice Stevens. The -- the jury wasn't asked to\nfind that, and the -- and the Government was very careful\nin the way they tried this case. We will show you that\nby, and the whole case was by. In the Ninth Circuit, the\nissue was whether by that date the indictment and the --\nand the trial.\nThe -- if -- if Cruz is -- if Cruz is wrong, the\nquestion would still be whether these persons entered into\na conspiracy.\nQUESTION: And had you raised that further\nquestion in the Ninth Circuit? In other words, did you go\nto the Ninth Circuit and say, Apply Cruz, period, or did\nyou go to the Ninth Circuit with other reasons?\nMR. SHURTLIFF: Mr. Justice -- or Justice\nSouter, we -- we went to the Ninth Circuit with -- with\nother reasons because the court --\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. SHURTLIFF: -- in the instructions that\nwe've read did apply Cruz, and everybody was satisfied --\nQUESTION: I just wanted to know whether -- I\njust wanted to know whether you had raised anything beyond\na Cruz point, and the answer is yes, okay.\nMR. SHURTLIFF: The sufficiency of the evidence,\nineffective -- there were several issues raised and -- and\ndecided.\nThe Government suggests that if we allow this\ndecision to stand, that it would cause irreparable injury\nand damage to the ability of the Government to prosecute\ncrime, to catch people who are miscreants, and that it\nwould make inordinately difficult the choices of the\nprosecutor in determining what and how to charge. We\nwould suggest simply that that's the obligation of the\nprosecutors now. Cruz doesn't add any burdens to the\nprosecutorial responsibility.\nThank you.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Shurtliff.\nMr. Dreeben, you have 3 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nTo address the jury instruction issue first, the\njury in this case was instructed in accordance with the\nrequirements of Cruz, and therefore, the jury was asked to\nfind whether there was evidence of respondents'\ninvolvement in the conspiracy before the seizure of the\ndrugs or, alternatively, whether they were involved in a\nbroader conspiracy, not limited to the drugs that were\nseized.\nAt pages 6 through 8 of our reply brief at the\npetition stage, we addressed the consequences of what\nhappens if this Court should conclude that the Cruz legal\nrule is incorrect. And in essence, our position is that\nany rational jury that found guilt under the Cruz\ninstructions also would have found that respondents were\ninvolved in a conspiracy to distribute the very drugs that\nthey drove to the Karcher Mall to pick up. That was the\ncenterpiece of the Government's evidence, that respondents\nwere involved in a conspiracy, and the fact that the jury\nmay have found that respondents were involved in a longer\nconspiracy, or in other conspiracies wouldn't detract from\nthe rationality of its necessarily concluding that the\nrespondents were also involved in this conspiracy.\nEven if this Court didn't agree with that\nrationale or chose not to reach it, it's important to note\nthat the effect of the Ninth Circuit's holding is to find\ninsufficient evidence to prove the crime charged in the\nindictment. That doesn't leave the Government with the\noption of pursuing a new trial on correct instructions\nwith the Cruz findings purged from them. It would mean\nthat respondents have permanent immunity from the crime\nthat's charged in the indictment. If this Court were to\nconclude that Cruz is wrong, and either this Court or the\nNinth Circuit also concluded that the jury instructions\nsomehow prejudiced the defendants, the remedy would be a\nnew trial.\nIt is also important, I believe, to note that\nthe -- the principle that the Ninth Circuit has adopted\nwould go contrary to what this Court has noted about the\nevolution of conspiracies. In a case called Blumenthal\nversus United States, which we did not cite in our briefs,\nbut it appears at 332 U.S. 539, the Court noted that\nconspiracies involving elaborate arrangements generally\nare not born full-grown. Rather, they mature by\nsuccessive stages which are necessary to bring in the\nessential parties.\nAnd in this case, two essential parties were\nbrought in not at the inception of the conspiracy, but\nafter events that the conspirators were aware of required\nthat new couriers were brought in. They were not aware\nthat the Government had seized the drugs, but they knew\nthat they needed new couriers. They brought them in.\nUnder the principles of Blumenthal, that's all one\nconspiracy.\nRespondents' counsel has mentioned the Model\nPenal Code provisions. The Model Penal Code at section\n5.01 addresses the question of impossibility under attempt\nlaw and concludes that the defense should not be\nrecognized and at section 5.03 does the same for\nconspiracy.\nFinally -- thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you,\nMr. Dreeben.\n"
