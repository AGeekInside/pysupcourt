CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument
first this morning in Case 09-1403, Erica P. John Fund
v. Halliburton Company.
Mr. Boies.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID BOIES
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BOIES: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please
the Court:
The district court below found, and it is
not disputed here, that the plaintiff fulfilled all of
the requirements of Rule 23(a) for class certification.
The district court also found, and the court of appeals
affirmed, that the plaintiffs demonstrated all of the
requirements for class certification under 23(b)(3)
except for the Fifth Circuit's loss causation
requirement. The court below recognized that whether or
not there was an efficient market was not disputed. It
was conceded that we have an efficient market here.
There were no challenges -
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Boies, if could
I just stop you there.
MR. BOIES: Certainly.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if that had
been disputed? Is that something that can be disputed
at the certification stage?
MR. BOIES: Yes, Your Honor.
The -
JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Boies, what's the
difference then? Why could that be disputed at the
certification stage, but not the question of price
impact?
MR. BOIES: Because the issue of efficient
market goes to the presumption of reliance, and if the
court holds at the certification stage that there is no
efficient market, then the basis for presuming
class-wide reliance is impacted. And so you can have a
situation in which the common issues do not predominate
over the individualized issues. That cannot happen with
respect to loss causation because, as Respondent
concedes here, loss causation is a common issue.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, how about materiality?
Could you rebut materiality at the certification stage?
MR. BOIES: No, Your Honor, we don't think
you can rebut materiality at the -- at the certification
stage. I would note that under the Fifth Circuit rule,
loss causation is in addition to materiality.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, now I'm a little
confused, because the efficient market and materiality
are all part of the prima facie case triggering the
Basic presumption. So, why couldn't you rebut one part
of that case but not another part of that case?
MR. BOIES: Because the issue of materiality
is something that goes to a class-wide common issue.
The issue of reliance can go to whether or not issues
predominate or not. Rule 23(b)(3) talks about whether
common issues predominate or not. That's the issue at
class certification stage. The merits issue is not
implicated at class certification -
JUSTICE ALITO: But common reliance -
MR. BOIES: -- under Rule 23 -
JUSTICE ALITO: -- can be rebutted at the -
common reliance can be rebutted at the certification
stage?
MR. BOIES: Excuse me, Your Honor?
JUSTICE ALITO: The Basic presumption can be
-- can the Basic presumption be rebutted at the
certification stage?
MR. BOIES: The Basic presumption of
reliance, yes, Your Honor. For example, if you were to
take a situation in which you -- not present here, but
where you disputed whether or not the market was
efficient or not, that is something that could be
decided at the class certification stage.
JUSTICE ALITO: Can it be rebutted by proof
other than proof generally disproving the efficiency of
the market?
MR. BOIES: We believe under the Court's
decision in Basic that that is something that is
reserved for trial, that -- that rebuttal.
JUSTICE ALITO: And what is that based on,
the footnote in Basic?
MR. BOIES: Yes. Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, that's pretty thin,
isn't it? It's a -- it's dictum in a footnote in an
opinion issued at a time when conditional class
certification was permitted. Do you have anything else
to support that?
MR. BOIES: I don't from this Court, Your
Honor.
JUSTICE ALITO: Do you have anything in the
rule to support that?
MR. BOIES: Anything in the rule?
JUSTICE ALITO: Yes.
MR. BOIES: Well, I think the -- I think
what the rule does is it talks about whether issues of
common issue predominate over individualized issue. And
since this is something that would be at the class
certification stage, not creating individualized issues,
we would think that is something that's reserved for
trial.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Boies, how would it
work in your view of the case? That is, you say that
the loss, what's been called loss causation, is not
something to be decided at the certification stage, but
at the trial or summary judgment. Well, how -- how
would the plaintiff class prove loss causation? Given
the reliance hurdle that you have surmounted, now you're
in -- you have your class certified; how does the class
prove loss causation.
MR. BOIES: As -- as this Court indicated in
Dura, in order to prove loss causation, you must
demonstrate that you had either an increase in the
prices, and this -- this assumes that you are concealing
negative information; the reverse would be true if you
were concealing positive information -- an increase at
the time that the concealment took place or a decline
when the actual facts were revealed.
And it would be required at summary judgment
by a summary judgment standard, and at trial by a trial
standard, and at the pleading stage by a pleading
standard, for the plaintiff to make out that case. In
other words, there are three times loss causation is
tested: Pleadings, summary judgment, and trial. The
question is whether a fourth test should be interposed
at the class certification stage.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, doesn't a lack
of response to a disclosure -- couldn't it be in some
situations reflective of an inefficient market?
MR. BOIES: Yes, Your Honor, I think it
could. I think that you -- you could very well have a
situation in which if you demonstrated a lack of
response, that could impact the issue of efficiency; and
I think that would be an issue that-- that in a proper
case where unlike this one it was presented -
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why is it? Why is this
case -- why can't you pigeonhole this case into that
argument, which, it appears what your -- what the
Respondents have done is move away from the loss
causation proof and gone to the issue of whether they
rebutted reliance or not.
MR. BOIES: The -- the problem is, as the
Fifth Circuit noted at page 335 of the F.3d report,
efficiency of this market was conceded below. In other
words, the Respondents conceded that this market was
efficient? So that issue -- that issue was not
presented, and the rebuttal issue was not -- was not
presented in this case.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. -- Mr. Boies, you
talked about loss causation. The Respondents assert
that that's not what the Fifth Circuit was really doing,
that -- that really they're just trying to rebut the
presumption essentially of -- of Basic by -- by showing
that at the -- at the far end, there was -- there was
nothing that could justify the presumption.
Would you be satisfied if we just said that
we agree with you that the requirement to prove loss
causation is -- is no good, and sent it back to the
Fifth Circuit and then let the Fifth Circuit adopt the
theory that Respondents assert they have already
adopted? I mean, it's sort of a Pyrrhic victory, it
seems to me, if you haven't just disapproved loss
causation.
MR. BOIES: Well, it depends on how the
Fifth Circuit then construes reliance.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, they -- they would
construe it the way Respondents say they have already
construed it.
MR. BOIES: Your Honor, I think that if they
simply changed the wording and called loss causation
reliance, obviously it wouldn't make any difference.
But as this Court indicated in Basic, and just last
month in Matrixx, loss causation and reliance are two
distinct elements. And the reason that's important in
this particular context is that reliance can create a
situation where you have individualized issues
predominating over common issues.
Loss causation can't because, as Respondents
concede here, loss causation is a class-wide issue.
Either -- there either is loss causation or is not loss
causation. That, as this Court held in Dura, is an
element of the merits case. It is one that we must
prove at all three stages -- pleadings, summary
judgment, and trial. But it is not something that goes
to the Rule 23 standard.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I think what you've said is
that there's really no difference between loss causation
and what Respondents assert that the Fifth Circuit
found.
MR. BOIES: No, Your Honor. I did not mean
to say that. I think that there is a difference. I
think there's a -- I think there are -- there are two
differences. There's a difference between what
Respondents say and what the Fifth Circuit says. The
Fifth Circuit talks about loss causation, says it's in
addition to efficient market, does not talk about
reliance.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.
MR. BOIES: There's also a difference
between what Respondents say and what this Court has
said in Basic and Matrixx and the other cases, in terms
of what is required to prove for class certification.
What is required to prove for class certification under
Rule 23, unless and until Rule 23 is changed, is that
common issues predominate. Common issues will
predominate even with respect to what the Respondents
here argue because -- because what they argue, just like
loss causation, is a common issue.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay, but -- but you -- you
would want us to say that and not just say that loss
causation -
MR. BOIES: Yes. Yes, Your Honor. Yes,
Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How do you see or what
difference do you see between their loss causation
evidence and an inefficient market? Could they -
assuming there was no stipulation in this case, do you
see any difference in -- in how they could use the fact
that other information affected the market and not this
one? Or is it your theory of the case that there is no
evidence that they could marshal to show that this is an
inefficient market?
MR. BOIES: I don't believe under this
Court's decision in Basic that, given the actual
objective facts that have been admitted -- it's a very
public market, very widespread distribution of
information, a lot of analysts are reporting on it -- I
don't believe that as a objective factual matter they
would be able ever to demonstrate that this was not an
efficient market.
If you had a much smaller market, indeed if
you -- if you had a market as the Court was considering
in Basic, which was a much smaller market, much less
public, much less analyst support, there may be areas in
which they -- they could rebut it. But I think, given
what we all know about the Halliburton stocks -- widely
traded, large number of shares traded, a lot of
analysts, a lot of public information -- I don't believe
under this Court's decision in Basic you could conclude
reasonably that that was not an efficient market.
JUSTICE ALITO: What do you say to -- to the
following argument, that there are some economists who
say that, even in a market that is generally efficient,
there can be instances in which the market does not
incorporate certain statements into the price of a
stock; and therefore even when it is demonstrated that
the market meets the test for efficiency that the lower
courts have settled upon in the wake of Basic, the
defendant in a -- in a class action where there is
reliance on the Basic presumption should be permitted at
the class certification stage to prove that the
allegedly fraudulent statements had no impact on price,
and by doing that destroy the theory that the class
relied on the statements, because they relied on the
price which incorporated the statements?
MR. BOIES: I -- I think, Your Honor, that
if you have a situation in which the proof is
class-wide, it is something that goes only to summary
judgment or trial. It does not go to the class
certification stage. With respect to the issue of
whether somebody is relying on an efficient market, that
is distinct from whether a particular statement was or
was not actionable.
In other words, the summary judgment issue,
the trial issue, is whether the particular statement was
actionable and that includes all of the things that the
court identifies. But those issues are going to be, if
there is an efficient market, class-wide issues. In
other words, it's not going to be the case that in a
particular instance a statement did not get into the
market will affect only one member of the class. It's
going to affect all members of the class. Because it is
something that is common all of the class members, Rule
23 says that is something for trial, not for class
certification.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, whether there's an
efficient market is also common to all members of the
class, so why would you make an exception for that?
MR. BOIES: Because if there's no efficient
market, then individualized issues are going to
predominate. That is, the test under Rule 23 is whether
individual issues or common issues are going to
predominate. If you destroy the efficient market theory
in a particular case, then individual issues of reliance
can predominate. However, that can't happen with
respect to loss causation or price distortion or any of
these other issues that are fundamental to the merits
and are common to the entire class, because if there's
no loss causation, there's no cause of action. As this
Court held in Dura, there must be loss causation. So if
there's no loss causation there aren't any individual
issues to adjudicate.
If there are no more questions, I would save
the remainder of my time for rebuttal.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Ms. Saharsky.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE A. SAHARSKY,
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,
AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
MS. SAHARSKY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The Fifth Circuit erred in requiring proof
of loss causation at class certification for three
reasons: First, it's conducting a merits inquiry that's
not tethered to the Rule 23 requirements; second, it's
taking a presumption and requiring plaintiffs to prove
it; and third, it's confusing the distinct elements of
reliance and loss causation.
Just to start in with some of the Court's
questions: First, Justice Scalia's: Does the court
require proof of loss causation? The Fifth Circuit
could not be more clear. It is not talking about
rebutting the presumption of reliance, giving the
defendants an opportunity to do that at class
certification. It is putting an affirmative burden on
plaintiffs that they have to meet in every single case,
even if the defendants do not come to court with any
evidence. And that is a very heavy burden, as the
district court in this case realized.
And just to make this as concrete as
possible, loss causation is the question at the end of
the day, whether the price decline that caused the
losses was sufficiently related to the earlier alleged
material misstatement and whether there was any other
cause that could have led to the price decline.
So if a plaintiff cannot come in and prove
loss causation, there could be many reasons for that.
It may be because the market is not efficient. It could
also be because there's no material misstatement. But
it could also be, as this Court recognized in Dura, that
there was a material misstatement, it did inflate the
stock price, but then other causes such as a bad economy
or other news about the company came along, and that's
what caused the stock price to drop. Justice -
JUSTICE SCALIA: But you acknowledged that
if the cause was the fact that the market was not
efficient, that could be raised at the certification
stage.
MS. SAHARSKY: Well, that's certainly what
the Court suggested in Basic and what the courts of
appeals have done, is to say that that's a threshold
showing that is sufficiently collateral to the merits
that it needs to be made, so that the presumption can be
invoked in the first instance.
But these ideas about rebutting the
presumption by showing that at the end of the day the
plaintiff can't prove its case, these are things, as Mr.
Boies said, that stand or fall on a class-wide basis.
And the real problem with the Fifth Circuit's decision
is that it did not tie its proof of loss causation to
the requirements of Rule 23. Everyone agrees here that
loss causation stands or falls on a class-wide basis.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: The rule isn't, I take it
-- or correct me if I'm wrong -- that simply because the
issue is on a class-wide basis, it can't be challenged
at the certification stage. We don't have a rule that's
that broad, do we? Or am I missing a point?
MS. SAHARSKY: Well, that's what Rule 23,
23(b)(3), which is the one at issue here -- the question
is do common issues predominate over individual ones.
What you're trying to answer is can this group of people
proceed together, not can this group of people make out
their case.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But suppose there's no
demonstrated basis that that common issue exists?
MS. SAHARSKY: Then I think the plaintiff
should lose at the 12(b)(6) stage, and that is a stage
that has real bite after this Court's decision in Dura
and after the PSLRA. There are heightened pleading
requirements that apply. There are plaintiffs that will
lose at summary judgment on the issue of loss causation,
for example, because, A, either they don't allege a
price drop, B, they don't connect the price drop to the
earlier distortion of the market when there's a material
misstatement.
There can be many reasons that they lose at
that merits stage, but class certification is not a
merits stage, and the Fifth Circuit made it one because
of its own policy judgments about the effects of class
certification. And with all due respect to the Fifth
Circuit, it's just not that Court's judgment to make
that -
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Class certification
is not a merits determination except with respect to
reliance? Except with respect to the fraud on the
market theory? That you can; that is a merits inquiry
and you can decide it at the class certification stage?
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And except, just to add to
the Chief Justice's question, an efficient market
theory?
MS. SAHARSKY: That's right. You're asking
is this theory going to be available to the plaintiffs
at trial, and the way that the plaintiffs show that the
theory is available to them is by establishing an
efficient market and saying that they traded within the
time period while the price was distorted. It's just
like establishing any other threshold inquiry that would
make evidence or a legal theory available at trial.
But the question the Court is supposed to be
asking at the 23, at the Rule 23 stage, the class
certification stage, is not can these people win on the
merits. And that's a question the Fifth Circuit was
asking. The question it's supposed to ask is can this
group of people proceed together.
JUSTICE ALITO: You seem to -- maybe I don't
understand your argument, but you and Mr. Boies seem to
be arguing that whether there is a common question -
that it is a common question whether there is a common
question, and therefore that has to wait until the
merits stage. Is that what you're saying?
MS. SAHARSKY: No, that's not what we're
saying. What we're saying is when common issues
predominate on the issue of reliance, and when the
Petitioners -- or when the plaintiffs invoke fraud on
the market and they show that there is an efficient
market, this Court said in Basic, they can all proceed
together because they are showing that the price -- that
the material misstatement was reflected in the stock
price. This is an impersonal market in which you rely
on the stock price. They all rely on it in the same
way.
JUSTICE ALITO: And if they show that the
statement was not incorporated in the price, in the
price, and they're not claiming that they relied, that
every member of the class actually relied on the
statement, they're all claiming they relied on the price
- if they show that the statement wasn't incorporated in
the price, then why doesn't reliance cease to be a
common issue and become a question of an individual
issue that would have to be proved by each, each member
of the class?
MS. SAHARSKY: Well, in that circumstance
reliance ceases to be and the case cannot be established
on the merits. They stand or fall together on the
merits. Their theory is the same for all of them.
JUSTICE ALITO: Yeah, but the fact that they
would lose on the merits doesn't necessarily mean that
they are entitled to class certification.
MS. SAHARSKY: Right. They're entitled to
class certification if they have a common issue. And
what the Court said in Basic is that if they set out the
prerequisites for the fraud on the market, which the
court of appeals agreed were met in this case, that they
could proceed together. That threshold showing is
required.
Justice Kagan, I take your point that there
is -- that even the question of whether the market is
efficient is a common one, so perhaps one could
logically say: Well, they have a common issue on the
efficiency of the market; why should they even have to
show that at class certification? But this Court said
in Basic, and the courts of appeals have said, it's
reasonable in that case since it's so divorced from the
merits to require a threshold showing to even allow them
to invoke the presumption at the outset.
But that is very, very different from what
the Fifth Circuit said in this case. The Fifth Circuit
in this case said basically: Prove your whole case.
You don't just have to prove that there was a price
decrease; you have to prove that there was an initial
material misstatement, that it distorted the stock
price, that it led to a price decrease and that the
price decrease can't be, can't be shown by any other
superseding cause. It's essentially, as the Seventh
Circuit said -
JUSTICE SCALIA: Can you -- can you do this
in reverse? I mean, suppose the class comes in and,
instead of proving at the outset that the market's an
efficient market and allege a misrepresentation, they
come in at the back end and they say: When that
statement that we assert was a misrepresentation was
corrected, the price of stock went down and we lost
money.
Now, it seems to me you would have to argue,
well, that's a good allegation if it's an efficient
market, which is a common question, right?
MS. SAHARSKY: Right.
JUSTICE SCALIA: So they can certify under
Rule 23 by using the back end. Instead of proving the
efficient market, they can prove that there was a
statement correcting the alleged misrepresentation, the
price of stock went down, right, and they can certify
the class?
MS. SAHARSKY: No. The Court said -
JUSTICE SCALIA: Why not? It would be -- it
would be a common question whether the market's
efficient or not.
MS. SAHARSKY: This Court said in Basic that
in order to establish the presumption that you need to
show the efficiency of the market, the trading during
the relevant time period. I agree with you that -
JUSTICE SCALIA: They're not relying on that
assumption. They -- they come in and show that there
was a correction of what we alleged was a misstatement
and the market went down. That's all that they allege.
And of course, that proves anything only if there's an
efficient market. But that will be a common question to
the whole class, so we'll, we'll -- we'll save that for
later.
MS. SAHARSKY: Well, with respect, just
alleging that the market went down would not be enough
to show that there was an initial price distortion
because of the company's material misstatement. Stock
prices can go down for any number of reasons. There's a
significant linkage that's required between the initial
material misstatement and the eventual loss.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but they assert that.
They assert that the reason it went down was because of
the initial misstatement.
MS. SAHARSKY: Certainly in the courts of
appeals now, that's not the way the plaintiffs proceed.
The way they proceed is on the Basic theory.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand that. I'm
just saying that seems to me it's a crazy way to run a
railroad.
MS. SAHARSKY: I don't think that that's -
JUSTICE SCALIA: If you can allege what's
upfront, you can allege what's -- what's in the back,
and what's upfront becomes a common question, so you
certify the whole class.
MS. SAHARSKY: With respect, Your Honor, I
mean, if you -- if you would like to -- if you would
like to expand even beyond Basic and allow class
certification. But the courts of appeals have used
Basic for 20 years, Congress is well aware of it and has
not seen fit to change it. This is the way that these
cases proceed.
This Court at the time of Basic recognized
that every court of appeals had thought that it made
sense to proceed in that way, using the fraud on the
market theory. This is well established. And just to
be clear, Respondents never suggested in this case that
Basic should be revisited. This is not an issue that
the courts below considered. This is not an issue that
was fully briefed, and it's not something that we think
should be considered.
The problem in this case is that the Fifth
Circuit took it upon itself to tighten the Rule 23
requirements. It was not satisfied with the rules as
they exist, and it took the class certification stage
and turned it into a merits inquiry stage. They
required plaintiffs to prove almost their entire case at
this stage of the litigation, and that just wasn't
right, because the class certification stage -- can I
finish this -- is about whether plaintiffs can proceed
as a group together, as the Court in Amchem said they
often can in securities fraud actions. The judgment
should be reversed.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Sterling.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID STERLING
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. STERLING: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
Basic recognized that, absent the class-wide
presumption of fraud on the market reliance, individual
issues of reliance predominate, as they do in any other
fraud context. Consequently, when a district court,
after the rigorous analysis required by Rule 23, finds
that the presumption is unavailable or rebutted,
reliance ceases to be a class-wide issue.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- I -- when -- what
in the Fifth Circuit's decision puts this inquiry into
the reliance prong and where did you argue it this way
below?
MR. STERLING: We argued it below based upon
the premise in Basic that the presumption is rebutted
when there is proof -
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you -
MR. STERLING: -- that the market price did
not distort -
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you give me a
place in the record where you actually said that, as
opposed to relying on Oscar to argue that the Fifth
Circuit was right in addressing as a merits question
whether the plaintiff had proven loss causation?
MR. STERLING: It was not addressed as a
merits question, Justice Sotomayor. It was addressed,
as Oscar said, as a prerequisite for finding reliance in
order to certify the class.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you're not defending
the rationale of the Fifth Circuit now? You're -
you're sort of backing yourself into the reliance
element?
MR. STERLING: We are not defending all of
the language in Oscar, clearly, but the basic test in
the Fifth Circuit, as our case made clear on pages 116a
and 119a of the petition appendix, is not loss
causation; it's price impact, because Basic says at page
248 any showing that severs the link between the
misrepresentation and the stock price defeats the
presumption. Basic makes clear on that same page that a
showing that the stock price was not distorted by the
misrepresentation defeats the presumption.
JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Sterling, if I
think -- if I disagree with you and I think that Oscar
said that loss causation needs to be shown at the
certification stage, you agree that that is not a
correct statement of the law; is that correct?
MR. STERLING: We do agree with that,
Justice Kagan. But our opinion made clear that it's not
loss causation as this Court knows it in Dura; the test
is simply price impact. And the Fifth Circuit
recognized -- and the Fund recognized this below on page
551a of the Joint Appendix -- their only burden under
the Fifth Circuit caselaw was to show price impact, and
they could show it either of two ways. Their papers
show this, page 116 and 119a of the joint appendix.
They can show price inflation upon a
misrepresentation, which, as this Court made clear in
Dura, is not synonymous with loss causation. Or failing
that -- and they could not show that here because their
own proof showed that none of the alleged
misrepresentations moved the market. So, the
alternative way to show price impact is simply to show a
price decline following a corrective disclosure.
And while that showing is similar to loss
causation, it's an easier, less rigorous showing of loss
causation, because under the price impact test at the
Fifth Circuit, all the plaintiff need show is that it's
reasonable to infer that some portion of the decline was
attributable to the revelation of the truth.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Sterling, I wasn't sure
what argument you were making in your brief. One
possible argument you could be making is that the
plaintiffs have to show a price impact. Another
possible argument you could be making is that you have
to have the opportunity to rebut the plaintiff's use of
the Basic presumption by yourself showing that there was
no price impact. And you seemed often to be saying the
first, even though I would think that the second is the
most you can make as a -- as a plausible argument.
MR. STERLING: If we suggested the first,
Justice Kagan, I apologize because we did not intend to.
Basic puts the initial burden on the defendant to show
the absence of price impact, showing that the presumed
fact does not exist.
Once that threshold showing is made, the
burden remains on the plaintiff under Rule 301 and Rule
23 to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the
market price was in fact, distorted.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but why do you -
JUSTICE GINSBURG: The way the Fifth Circuit
wrote the decision, the Fifth Circuit seems to be
saying: Plaintiffs, you didn't show an initially false
representation; and you, you plaintiff, didn't show a -
a corrective statement that caused a price drop. As I
read the Fifth Circuit's decision, it says: Plaintiff,
you failed to prove one of the two things that you would
have to prove.
And you say: No, they really put the burden
on -- on defendants, Fifth Circuit put the burden on
defendant and found that defendant had met it instead of
the other way around?
MR. STERLING: We agree, Your Honor, that
the Fifth Circuit put the initial burden of production
on the plaintiff and that's contrary to Basic. We -- we
agree with that. However, in terms of the Fifth
Circuit's language that I believe Your Honor's referring
to, that is when the Fifth Circuit was discussing the
alleged corrective disclosures.
Because the plaintiff could not show that
any of the alleged misrepresentations moved the market,
they had to rely upon what they claimed were corrective
disclosures. That was the only way they could show
price impact.
The Fifth Circuit, at various times, looked
at each of the alleged corrective disclosures and said
that's not a corrective disclosure because it doesn't
reveal the truth in any way; it's bad news, but it's
non-culpable bad news. It doesn't in any way suggest
that Halliburton said something during the class period
that was false.
JUSTICE BREYER: Can I -- I'm trying this
question out. Try to give me your best answer. If I
don't have it clear enough, just forgive it and go on to
another. As I'm understanding this case with Basic, the
idea is there is a presumption. Somebody lies and says
there's an oil well I found oil in. A lot of people buy
on the stock market. It turns out there was no oil, and
a lot of people say they lost money. All right.
The point of the stock market presumption is
to say: Smith, you're a typical plaintiff and this
presumption is going to help you by the following.
We're going to say what happened to the typical person
on the stock market during that period happened to you,
and there are a lot of people who bought and sold on the
stork market. And that's why efficient markets is
needed to show at the certification stage, because if
there weren't certification -- if that isn't shown, the
whole thing falls apart.
But what you're just saying on terms of
whether the revelation lowered the price has nothing to
do with the question of what happened to the typical
person, Smith, happened to you, nothing to do with it.
It has to do with whether anybody was hurt. Now, that
has nothing to do with the certification stage. That's
the win or lose stage.
Now, that's how I'm understanding it at the
moment. So what's wrong with the way I understand it?
MR. STERLING: Justice Breyer, the -- the
problem is, we're back to reliance. Basic exists -
Basic creates a presumption as an exception to the long
understood rule that fraud cases were not appropriate
vehicles for class actions because each individual would
have to say, Mr. Smith in your hypothetical, I read
Halliburton's statement and I relied upon it.
Basic said, because that's so impractical
cases would never be certified, we're going to say we're
going to assume the entire market is like Mr. Smith, and
Mr. Smith relies on the integrity of the stock price
when the stock price is distorted by the
misrepresentation. But if the stock price was not in
fact distorted by the misrepresentation, it makes no
sense to say everybody relied on the misrepresentation
through its effect on the stock price.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Which means you would lose.
I -- I mean, which means that the plaintiff would lose.
But it doesn't mean that there is not a common issue,
that the -- that the latter question, whether in fact
the market was affected or not is, is not a common
question. Rule 23 only requires that -- that there be a
common question.
MR. STERLING: But Justice Scalia, Basic
sets forth a special rule. Basic is an exception to the
long-understood rule about the nonsusceptibility in
class actions to class treatment of fraud cases. Basic
says it's not just enough to allege the operative facts,
and we will presume reliance. Basic says you have to
plead and prove them, and all of those operative facts
are subject to common proof. The efficient market: the
efficient market applies to everybody, it's common
proof. Everybody recognizes, everybody agrees, Mr.
Boies said so today, and the government said so today:
if the market -- if the district court does not find
that the market -- that the market for the stock is
efficient at the class certification stage, you can't
certify, because it's not reasonable to infer then that
the misrepresentation was translated into the stock
price.
Materiality is another requirement under
Basic. It's a threshold condition. Again, common
proof. All the courts except for the Seventh Circuit
agree materiality must be proven at the class
certification level. Same thing for whether the
misrepresentation was public. If it was not publicly
made, it's not reasonable to infer that it had an impact
on the stock price.
All of these operative facts are subject to
common proof. But Basic says unless those facts are
proven at the class certification stage, the presumption
of class-wide reliance doesn't apply and individual
issues of reliance predominate.
The same must be true for rebuttal proof.
Basic says eight times that the presumption is
rebuttable, and it makes no sense at all to rely upon
these indirect or surrogate, circumstantial proof of
whether the misrepresentation moved the market. That's
all these are -- materiality, whether it was publicly
made, whether the market was efficient. These are all
just surrogates of whether it is reasonable to believe
or to infer that the stock price was in fact distorted
by the misrepresentation.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, could you explain
to me why in this case it's not reasonable to believe,
meaning assuming the truth, that there was falsity in
the statements made, those alleged -
MR. STERLING: Because -- I'm sorry.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Assuming truth to those
statements, why wouldn't a market react to corrective
measures? Because what I see is a difference between
saying it's an inefficient market or that the statements
had no price impact for some other merits-related
reason. But why does that tie to an inefficient market
at all?
MR. STERLING: Well, again, general market
efficiency is just a proxy or a surrogate for whether
it's reasonable to think the conditions exist for the
stock price to be affected by a misrepresentation.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So tell me why on its
face, with the false statements alleged here, why would
it be unreasonable to conclude that the market wouldn't
respond to them?
MR. STERLING: One reason is because the
market deemed the information to be immaterial, the
market didn't care about it, the market didn't react to
it. Another reason could be that, while a market is
generally efficient, a market was inefficient for this
type of information. I -
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, but you conceded
efficiency below, so you've sort of given up that
argument.
MR. STERLING: We conceded efficiency below
because, candidly, their own proof showed that none of
the misrepresentations moved the market. And what we
have here is not circumstantial proof of general market
efficiency or materiality or whether the statement was
public; here there was direct proof that none of these
misrepresentations moved the market, and that is the
whole premise of the Basic class-wide presumption of
reliance.
Basic itself says if the stock price was not
distorted by the misrepresentation, you can't say the
entire class relied upon the misrepresentation to the
stock price. And that's exactly what we have here. It
is the DNA proof, and it makes no sense for district
courts to be certifying class actions based upon this
indirect or circumstantial proof while ignoring the
direct proof of the absence of price impact.
And in effect what they're asking this Court
to do is to extend Basic. Basic itself is a judicially
created presumption designed to make a judicially
created cause of action easier to be maintained as a
class action.
Now, it was one thing for courts decades ago
to imply a private cause of action under 10(b) and it
was another thing for this Court to create a rebuttable
presumption of reliance in Basic in order to make it
easier to maintain these cases as class actions. But it
would do violence to Stoneridge's admonition that the
10b cause of action ought not be further expanded to
make that rebuttable presumption of reliance
irrebuttable at the class certification stage.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But your -- your argument
seems to say, to -- to get a class certified you have to
virtually prove your case on the merits. You -- you
leave almost nothing over. I mean, if you've won the
class action certification on your basis and you've
shown the material misleading and the price dropped as a
consequence, the efficient market first -- you've shown
all that, what else is left on the merits? You win on
the merits if you win certification.
MR. STERLING: Justice Ginsburg, that -
that is not our position. Our position is in order to
get the class-wide presumption of reliance, it's the
plaintiff's burden to plead and prove upfront as
threshold facts, a public misrepresentation that was
material made in an efficient market. However, the
defendant has the right at the class certification stage
to rebut that presumption by any showing, to quote
Basic, "that severs the length between the
misrepresentation and the stock price." When that
threshold showing is made, the burden is back on the
plaintiff to demonstrate the necessary linkage.
It's not a finding on the merits. A
determination at the class certification stage is simply
one of whether the Rule 23(b) predominance requirement
is met and whether the class can appropriately proceed
as a class, as opposed to in the traditional individual
fashion, and that finding is not binding on the ultimate
finder of fact.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Sterling, maybe this is
just to repeat Justice Ginsburg's question, but what
else is there? I mean, what would not be proper to
introduce in the way that you're talking about at the
certification stage?
MR. STERLING: Falsity, scienter, actual
proof of loss causation, and damages.
JUSTICE KAGAN: The Fifth Circuit suggested
that scienter could come in at the -- at the
certification stage. You're disclaiming that?
MR. STERLING: Footnote 35 of the Fifth
Circuit opinion makes clear that it is not requiring
scienter. The Fifth Circuit says, in response -- in
analyzing what is or is not a corrective disclosure, it
says it has to do something that suggests that a
statement was made that is potentially actionable was
false. Otherwise it's not a revelation of the truth.
And all that is, again, is a second way under the Fifth
Circuit's test of showing whether there is the necessary
price impact to justify certifying a class, or
alternatively to determine that individual issues of
reliance predominate.
And allowing the defendants to rebut the
presumption of reliance at the class certification stage
is consistent with this Court's class action case law
and with Rule 23. This Court has consistently said that
the Rule 23 requirements are not to be presumed, they're
not to be assumed, they have to be found. Actual
conformance is the test.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: The only requirement
we're talking about is (b)(3) because it's -- it's not
argued and the district court found that all of the
23(a) requirements were satisfied. That's not the
particular -
MR. STERLING: Correct Your Honor. But
23(b)(3) requires a court to make a finding that
predominance exists. And the 2003 amendments to the -
to Rule 23 make clear that a court should not certify a
class unless and until it is satisfied that all of the
Rule 23 requirements are met; and it makes no sense to
say that a court is going to conduct this rigorous
analysis and make the Rule 23(b)(3) findings without
considering the defendant's rebuttal proof of whether,
in fact, there was price impact, because Basic itself
says if there is no price impact, the presumption falls
away, individual issues of reliance predominate, and the
class cannot be certified.
JUSTICE KAGAN: On your rebuttal proof
point, you said just now that all you had to do was come
forward with some evidence, but that the burden remains
on the plaintiff. Is that -- what kind of evidence do
you think you have to come forward with in order to flip
the burden back to the plaintiff?
MR. STERLING: Well, under Basic, it's any
showing that severs the link, and here it was proof -
we had our own expert that demonstrated that, again kind
of harping on their expert -- none of the
misrepresentations inflated the stock price -
JUSTICE KAGAN: So you're saying you can put
an expert on the stand and the expert will say there was
no price impact, and then the plaintiffs have to make
the case that there, in fact, was a -- a price impact at
the certification stage, that the plaintiffs have to
prove that by a preponderance?
MR. STERLING: Correct, Your Honor.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Once you put a expert on the
-- on the stand.
MR. STERLING: Under Rule 301, the
presumption does not shift the ultimate burden of proof.
It stays on the party that -- that bears it. That is
consistent with Rule 23 as well, which puts the burden
on the plaintiff, to prove all of the Rule 23 elements
exist.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, that does suggest that
the Basic presumption isn't worth much in your world.
That you put an expert on the stand, and the Basic
presumption falls away, and the plaintiffs have to
actually prove their case at that very early stage that
there was no price impact.
MR. STERLING: We agree, Your Honor, that
they have to show price impact, but that's not a hard
burden to show. If any of their 22 -- they allege that
we made misrepresentations that were false on 22 days
during the class period. All they had to do was show
one day during that class period statistically
significant price movement, and they're in. Or all they
had to show was any of the alleged -- I've forgotten how
many -- corrective disclosures during the class period.
Any one day, if there was a -- a meaningful price
movement that a court could infer was related to the
revelation of truth, that's all they need to show. But
they couldn't show that.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I suppose
if you prevail and a defendant tries to establish at the
certification stage that there's no loss causation and
loses, then that's law of the case and you've missed the
three opportunities that Mr. Boies was willing to give
you at the pleading stage, summary judgment, and the
merits. That issue is out of the case if you lose,
right?
MR. STERLING: No, Your Honor, because the
finding at the class certification stage is not binding
upon the ultimate fact finder. So if the -- if the
Court determines by a preponderance of the evidence that
reliance is not there, if the Court -- if the case goes
to trial and an individual plaintiff brings his or her
own case based upon subjective reliance, that the
Court's determination that the class certification stage
is not binding on the jury.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if there's
no -- no new evidence? One of the objections to your
theory is you don't have discovery at the certification
stage. What if you have no new evidence to put on at
later stages?
MR. STERLING: It's possible that the jury
would agree with the judge who made the determination at
the class certification hearing, it's possible that the
judge -- that the jury might not. But the discovery
issue, Your Honor, is a complete red herring, because
Rule 23 makes clear that the district court has ample
discretion at the class certification stage to allow
discovery into the merits to the extent that they are
relevant to the class certification issue.
And more importantly here, the Fund never
asked for discovery. In fact, when the Fund filed its
motion for class certification on page 139A of the joint
appendix, the Fund said no discovery is needed to
resolve this motion except for expert discovery. The
Fund never asked for discovery at the district court
level, the Fund never asked for discovery at the Fifth
Circuit. The only time they've ever hinted that they
wanted discovery related to the class certification
issue was at this Court.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought that the whole
reason you -- you say that the class certification stage
is so significant is precisely because once the class is
certified, there will be immense discovery on the merits
of the case, which will be so expensive for defendants
that they're inclined to throw in the towel. Now you're
telling us that you -- you want to move discovery up to
the class certification stage?
MR. STERLING: Justice Scalia, that was not
my point, and I apologize if -- if it came out that way.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I -- I'm sure it
wasn't your point, but -
(Laughter.)
MR. STERLING: All -- all -- all I was -
all I suggesting that if a plaintiff were to say, you
know, Your Honor, to the district court, we think we -
we can't -- we should not have the class certification
hearing yet because we need some discovery on point A,
B, C, which did not happen here, the district court can
say fine or can say I don't think you need it. But the
premise of your question is certainly correct. The
grant of class certification is a seminal event in a
10b-5 case. It has huge repercussions for the
defendant.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no, no. You -
on page 13 of your brief you say one of the objections
to it -- to your opponents or your friends' view is that
it would just postpone the defendant's ability to rebut
the presumption, result in countless classes being
certified with the certain knowledge that they would
have to be decertified later. Well, if it's so certain,
then there's no in terrorem effect.
MR. STERLING: Just when -- that's assuming
that the defendant has the wherewithal to stick it out
through it all, but the sheer grant of class
certification which aggregates hundreds, tens,
thousands -- tens of thousands of these claims together
in one big case makes every one of these cases, in
effect, a company case, and it puts huge settlement
pressure on the defendant.
I mean, in -- in this case Halliburton had
440 million shares of stock outstanding during the class
period. The class period lasts 2 1/2 years. It's easy
to do the math and say that had this class been
certified, there would have been huge pressure upon
Halliburton to settle.
JUSTICE BREYER: Does your rule apply in all
fraud cases? That is, a thousand farmers say,
Mr. Jackson was our common buying agent, and the
defendant lied to Mr. Jackson, and he relied on the lie.
It is a common issue whether he relied on the lie or he
didn't rely on the lie. I can understand somebody
saying at the certification stage they have to see
whether he's really a common agent. But let's imagine
that's assumed. The only question left is, did he rely
or not rely?
Is that a question for the merits or is that
a question for the common -- for the -
MR. STERLING: Basic is really an exception
that applies only -
JUSTICE BREYER: So you're saying in the
case that I just gave you reliance is for the merits?
MR. STERLING: Correct, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER: Whether he really relied or
didn't rely, the common agent is for the merits?
MR. STERLING: But you couldn't have -
JUSTICE BREYER: Is that -- is that your
answer is?
MR. STERLING: No, Your Honor. You couldn't
have a case in that situation because reliance is an
individual issue.
JUSTICE BREYER: No. A thousand people say
Mr. Jackson is our common buying agent, and the
defendant lied to this common buying agent, and he
represented us. Relied on that. I'm asking if you that
issue of reliance in an appropriate case is for the
certification stage?
MR. STERLING: Yes, Your Honor, because -
JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.
MR. STERLING: -- you still have everybody
having to say Mr. Jackson is my agent. That's -
JUSTICE BREYER: And they also have to prove
there is a lie?
MR. STERLING: Right. And that's a -- but
the individualized question of reliance is simply, is
Mr. Jackson your agent or not? Because of that there is
no common issue that -- that predominates on reliance.
JUSTICE BREYER: Okay.
MR. STERLING: If there are no further
questions, we would ask that the judgment below be
affirmed. Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Mr. Sterling.
Mr. Boies, you have 5 minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID BOIES
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BOIES: Thank you, Your Honor. Thank
you, Mr. Chief Justice.
Let me respond to Mr. Sterling's statement
that all we had to do was show one statistically
significant price movement. As the Court is aware from
the briefing, on December 7th of 2001, the Halliburton
put out a release that indicated that their prior
statements that their asbestos reserves were -- were
adequate were not -- were not true. The stock dropped
42 percent, more than 42 percent. The actual drop was
42.4.
Expert witnesses calculated that the
company's specific drop was slightly larger than that
because the market was generally going up that day. But
it was a dramatic drop.
Their own expert, as is indicated in the
briefing, agreed that there wasn't anything else
happening that day other than asbestos news, and so -
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you win, so you
win at the certification stage or at the pleading stage,
whatever. So why is it such I big deal to you here?
MR. BOIES: Because under the -- the Fifth
Circuit rule, I understand that counsel disavows the
actual language of the Fifth Circuit rule, but it was
that language that the district court relied on in
failing to certify the class. And with -- with -- with
respect to the Fifth Circuit test, what the Fifth
Circuit says is that because the announcement on
December 7th did not specifically reference the prior
announcements, it cannot be considered a correction of
those prior announcements.
Indeed, the court, the Fifth Circuit goes
even further, and this is at page 338 of the F. Supp.
opinion. It says, quote: The district court must
decide whether the corrective disclosure more probably
than not shows that the original estimates or
predictions were designed to defraud.
So what the Fifth Circuit is doing is it's
bringing, even the defrauding aspect, not just the
falsity aspect, but the defrauding aspect right into the
class certification stage.
And I think Justice Scalia's question was
exactly on point with respect to discovery, because
either they're going to make these merits decisions
without discovery or you're going to have all of the
discovery before you have the class certification. It's
got to be one or the other. And in either case what is
happening is you're converting what Rule 23 says is an
issue as to whether common issues predominate into an
issue as to what is the strength of the merits claim
that the plaintiff has, and while it is true, reliance
is part of the merits claim.
The reason reliance is different is because
reliance, if it -- if there is no reliance, if there's
no efficient market, then reliance can make individual
issues predominate, but when the only issue is not a
step issue like efficient market, but is a direct merits
issue, there isn't any way that you can make individual
issues predominate regardless of how you decide it; and
loss causation and price distortion are both those kind
of common issues; and counsel says he doesn't defend
the -- the actual loss causation statements of the -- of
the -- of the Fifth Circuit, and what I would ask is
whether the Court, if the Court does decide to send it
back, that the Court look at what the right standard is
for the court below to be applying when it deals with
class certification.
And I would urge the Court that when you
have pleadings, summary judgment, and trial tests for
merits questions, then you don't need another merits
test on -- at the class certification stage, even if
Rule 23 permitted it, which we don't think it does.
What Rule 23 is designed to do is simply say are
individual issues or common issues going to predominate?
And all of the class have the same loss causation, have
the same price distortion issues.
If the Court has no more questions, that
completes my argument.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel,
counsel. The case is submitted.
