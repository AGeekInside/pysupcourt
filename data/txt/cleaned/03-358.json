KNEEDLER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn February of 2001, an international\narbitration panel, convened under the North American Free\nTrade Agreement, concluded that the United States'\ncontinuation of a blanket ban or a moratorium on the\noperation of Mexican domiciled commercial carriers beyond\nthe border zone in the United States violated NAFTA.\nSoon thereafter, the President made clear --\nexcuse me -- his intention to comply with the arbitration\ndecision by invoking power specifically vested in him by\nCongress to lift the moratorium in order to comply with an\ninternational trade agreement. And the President in fact\ndid lift the moratorium in November of 2002.\nIn this case, the Ninth Circuit held that the\nFederal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, an agency in\nthe Department of Transportation that is limited to a -- a\nsafety mandate, was required to conduct an elaborate and\ncomplex environmental analysis of the President's foreign\ntrade and foreign policy decision before it could enter or\nissue procedural safety regulations that were necessary to\nimplement the President's decision. The Ninth Circuit set\naside the procedural regulations on that ground and\nthereby prevented the agency from granting certification\nto carriers that under the President's decision were\neligible to receive it.\nThe Ninth Circuit's decision is incorrect and it\nhas frustrated the President's ability to comply with\nNAFTA.\nCongress and the President, the two entities\nwhose joint action brought about the lifting of the\nmoratorium, are not subject to either NEPA or the\nprovisions of the Clean Air Act that respondents rely on\nto require an environmental analysis. Accordingly, the\nagency acted entirely reasonably in choosing to take the\nPresident's action as a given, including any increased\ntraffic or trade that might occur as a result of the\nPresident's decision and to, instead, focus its own\nenvironmental analysis on the effects of its own\nprocedural regulations.\nFMCA's government -- governing statute requires\nit to grant registration to any carrier that is willing\nand able to comply with applicable safety, safety fitness,\nand financial responsibility requirements. The agency has\nno authority to deny operating permission to a carrier,\nforeign or domestic, based on environmental concerns or\nforeign trade concerns. It has no authority to\ncountermand the President's decision or to refuse to issue\nthe regulations that were necessary to implement the\nPresident's decision.\nQUESTION: Mr. Kneedler, just a -- a background\nfact. Perhaps I missed it, but was there any parallel in\nCanada? We're talking about Mexico or Mexican vehicles.\nI understood that originally there was the same limitation\nfor both.\nMR. KNEEDLER: There was. And -- and soon\nthereafter, the -- the moratorium was imposed in 1982\noriginally, but it conferred on the President the power to\nlift the moratorium, and an agreement was arrived at soon\nthereafter with Canada. So since the early '80's,\nCanadian carriers have been -- have been permitted to\nenter.\nThe -- the moratorium was remained in --\nretained in effect by the President through subsequent\nactions into the '90's. In the North American Free Trade\nAgreement, the United States included a reservation to a\ncomplete opening of the border for transporter operations\nby carriers subject to a phase-out, initially a phase-out\nthat would allow carriers from Mexico to operate in any of\nthe border States -- that was 3 years after the agreement\nwas signed -- and then by the year 2000, to allow the\ncarriers to operate anywhere in the United States. The\nPresident decided not to go forward with that because of\nconcerns about whether the safety regulatory regime in\nMexico was sufficient to prepare the Mexican carriers to\ncome into the United States. So that is the reason why it\nwas held up.\nAnd -- and the basis of the NAFTA arbitration\npanel's decision was that a blanket prohibition on that\nground was not -- was -- was not permissible under NAFTA\nand that the United States had to consider applications\nfrom Mexican carriers on a case-by-case basis. It could\nadopt special procedures to ensure that the carriers who\nwould be permitted to come in under the President's\nlifting of the moratorium would satisfy the substantive\nsafety standards. And that is the set of regulations that\nare at issue here.\nBut it's important to recognize that these are\nnot substantive safety standards. The substance -- the\nstandards that -- that Mexican carriers, like -- like\nother foreign and domestic carriers in the United States\nhave to comply with, are -- have already been in place.\nAll that we are talking about here are essentially\nprocedural or administrative regulations.\nQUESTION: Mr. Kneedler, can I ask you a\nquestion? Because I'm really kind of confused about this.\nI'm trying to think through the case. Assume the\nPresident wasn't involved at all and Congress had decided\nto lift the moratorium and enact it and did everything the\nPresident did and said, but before you do it, we want you\nto, as a precondition, adopt these safety regulations.\nWould your position be any different?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Oh, yes, yes. And it -- I think\nit's the same situation. The FMCSA, as a subordinate\nagency in the executive branch, I think would have to take\nas a given that act of Congress just -- just as it was -\nit was --\nQUESTION: It wouldn't be any different. I -\nyou -- you -\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, no. I -\nQUESTION: I thought you were saying it's -\nQUESTION: Your position would be the same.\nMR. KNEEDLER: The same. Yes.\nQUESTION: Oh, well -\nMR. KNEEDLER: That's what I -- I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: You scared me for a minute.\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, no. I -- I misspoke.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. KNEEDLER: I'm sorry. I misspoke. The\nposition would be exactly the same and -- and for very\nsimilar reasons, that that's essentially a political\ndecision, in the one case by Congress in your example, or\n-- or by the President.\nAnd -- and that's why Congress traditionally\nvests an authority such as this in the President because\nhe is responsible for foreign relations and foreign trade.\nQUESTION: But -- but in either event, it would\nnot have been the kind of major Federal action that must\nbe preceded by an EIS.\nMR. KNEEDLER: That's correct.\nQUESTION: That's your basic position.\nMR. KNEEDLER: That's -- that's correct. It's\npart of the context in which the agency is operating, but\nit would be presumptuous of the agency to take upon itself\na -- a determination to evaluate or to second guess\neffectively the President's determination.\nQUESTION: Well, but -- but it wouldn't be a\nquestion of second guessing, would it, if the agency\nregulations in question could reduce somehow the -- the\nimpact that the -- the known action by the President,\nwho's pretty sure this was going to happen, would cause?\nAnd -- and so it's sort of relevant, it seems to me,\nwhether these rules issued by the agency could, if there\nhad been an environmental impact statement, have been\nadjusted in such a way as to reduce the -- the\nenvironmental impact. Is there any relationship between\nthese rules and the environmental impact that the\nrespondents are concerned about?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Two things I'd like to say about\nthat. The first one is that the -- that respondents'\nclaim in this case and the Ninth Circuit's holding in this\ncase are not premised on the sort of tinkering with the\napplication and monitoring rules that -- that you may be\nreferring to. The -- the premise of the Ninth Circuit's\ndecision was that -- that the President's lifting of the\nmoratorium was foreseeable and therefore FMCSA had to\nevaluate the -- the much broader question of whether\nMexican trucks should be permitted to come in at all.\nQUESTION: No, but I mean, my point is it -- it\nseems to me obvious that you don't have to evaluate in an\nenvironmental impact statement something that you have no\npower -\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right.\nQUESTION: -- to -- to remedy.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right. As to your second point,\nthough, that -- that the agency might have been able to\nrefine the regulations in some way, that is not an\nargument that respondents made to the agency. And under\nVermont Yankee -- and this is critical to the operation of\n-- of NEPA and the corresponding Clean Air Act provisions\nis that an agency can only evaluate or -- or identify\nerrors if they're called to its attention.\nQUESTION: When did respondents first make this\npoint? You say they didn't make it in -\nMR. KNEEDLER: The -- the first place that this\npoint -- it was really just in a sentence -- was in a\nreply brief in the court of appeals that they -- that they\n-- that they -- they said that the agency might have been\n-- been able to come up with some modified version of -\nof the regulations.\nBut it's not very realistic to think that what\nthe agency could do -- could permissibly do -- could have\na significant effect on -- on emissions because -\nQUESTION: Well, Mr. Kneedler, on -- on that -\ngoing to that point, I mean, that goes to something\nJustice Scalia raised and I wanted to raise it too. He -\nhe expressed, as a premise to his question -- and I had\nassumed when I started out on this case -- that the agency\ndoes not have to prepare an impact statement which takes\ninto consideration effects that the agency itself does not\nhave the authority to avoid.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right.\nQUESTION: And -- and I'm looking -- by the way,\nI'm on page -- what is it -- 2a of -- of your brief where\nyou set out the statute down at the bottom of the page,\nRoman (i). One of the things the agency has got to\ndisclose is the environmental impact of the proposed\naction. That I understand. They could avoid that in -\ntheoretically in -- in the general rule. They could say,\nwell, we won't take the proposed action if it has a very\nbad effect. And that's consistent with what he assumed\nand what I assumed.\nBut then you get to Roman (ii) and Roman (ii)\nsays they've got to disclose any adverse environmental\neffects which cannot be avoided should the proposal be\nimplemented. And that seems to be broader. That seems to\nsay if your proposal, which in itself may be\nenvironmentally benign, is the trigger for action by other\nagencies or other people, which is not environmentally\nbenign, you've got to disclose the effects that will come\nabout when you take the triggering action even though\nyou're triggering action is clean. Am I -- am I\nmisreading that?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, respondents have not relied\non that provision, but -- but my -- my understanding of\nthat is that that refers -- that refers to effects that -\nthat are within the agency's control.\nThe -- the critical point -- and this -- this is\nreflected in the -- in the regulations on page 4a, the\nthings that an agency is responsible for taking account of\nunder NEPA, are direct -- things that are directly caused\nor indirectly caused. And caused is the -- is the\noperative word. And this Court said in the Metropolitan\nEdison case that it's -- that -- that strict but-for\ncausation is not enough under NEPA.\nQUESTION: But if -- if that's the -- if -- if\nthe -- if -- I'll call it (C)(ii) here -- is -- is being\nread in that way, then I take it what it means -- let's\nforget the presidential action here. Let's just take\nconventional government action. If you had, let's say,\nsix Government agencies, each of which on a coordinated\nbasis was going to do something to bring about a result,\nand the effect of the action of each one of those agencies\nby itself really didn't amount to much, but the action of\nall six together amounted to a very great deal\nenvironmentally, there never would be an environmental\nimpact statement that would take into effect the\ncumulative action.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right.\nQUESTION: Is -- is that fair to say?\nMR. KNEEDLER: And -- and I was just going to\nsay there is a separate requirement under the -- CEQ has\nelaborate regulations that -- that flesh this out. And -\nand CEQ has a regulation that the Ninth Circuit relied\nupon and -- and respondents have -- have abandoned any\nreliance on it, which is that an agency has to evaluate\ncumulative impacts. It has to -- it has to essentially\nevaluate the incremental contribution that its own action\nwill make toward a -\nQUESTION: Then why doesn't that apply here?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Because the -- the -- first of\nall, the agency did that. It evaluated its incremental -\nits incremental impact. What -- what it did -\nQUESTION: But I'm talking about the cumulative\neffect. I -- I thought -- maybe I misunderstood what\nyou've said.\nMR. KNEEDLER: It -- it --\nQUESTION: I thought under the Council of\nEnvironmental Quality reg, at some point they had to take\ninto effect -- they had to disclose the cumulative effect.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, if you mean -- if you mean\nwith the -- the -\nQUESTION: The effect of all the agencies\ntogether in my hypothesis. You've got six agencies. Each\nof them does a little thing. Add the six together. You\nget a big thing. I thought you were saying that under the\nCouncil on Environmental Quality regs, somewhere along the\nline somebody has got to disclose in an -- in an impact\nstatement -\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes, and -- and --\nQUESTION: -- the cumulation.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right, and -- and what -- what\nthe --\nQUESTION: So why wasn't it done here?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, the -- the agency here was\nthe only one taking action, and all the cumulative impact\nrequirement requires it to do is to isolate what its\nincremental contribution will be -\nQUESTION: Well, that's under Roman (i), but\nunder Roman (ii) it's broader, and you said, I thought,\nunder the Council on Environmental Quality regs, at some\npoint you've got to disclose the cumulative effect of all\nof it. So on my hypothesis, it's -- when -- who -- what\nagency and when has to disclose the cumulative effect -\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, if -- if there are -\nQUESTION: -- and why wasn't it done here?\nMR. KNEEDLER: If there are -- if there are two\nagencies working in tandem -- see, the -- again, the\nPresident -\nQUESTION: So you're saying -\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- the President -\nQUESTION: -- it -- it would have been done here\nbut for the fact that the President is not an agency.\nMR. KNEEDLER: If two agencies -- if two\nagencies are taking parallel action, they are supposed -\nor coordinated action, they're supposed to coordinate\nthe -\nQUESTION: Right, and you're saying because the\nPresident is not an agency, that doesn't apply here.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right. Right. And -- and --\nQUESTION: Now, does the -- does the Council on\nEnvironmental Quality regulation say that the -- that the\ndisclosure of cumulative effect depends upon the action of\nmany agencies as opposed to the actions of many persons to\nwhich an agency contributes?\nMR. KNEEDLER: It is -- it is -- it's\naddressed -\nQUESTION: Yes, but what is it?\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- more -- it -- it includes\nmore -\nQUESTION: But is it --\nMR. KNEEDLER: It's not just limited to other\nagencies, but there's an -\nQUESTION: Then why didn't it apply here? We'll\nassume the President is not an agency. Why didn't that\nrequirement apply here?\nMR. KNEEDLER: The agency did comply by saying\nthis is the context in which we were acting. What they\nsaid is we have no control. And this is the --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- literally language. We have\nno control over what the President is going to do. It\nprojected -- it projected increases in traffic or -- or\nincreases in trade that might -- might result or discussed\nthat. So that's really what the cumulative impact\nanalysis requires is to -- for the agency to put its own\naction in context.\nBut where the agency's own action is marginal,\nwhich is the case here, it can be expected -- these are\nbasically administrative undertakings by the agency,\napplication forms, and -- and on-site inspections. That\n-- that where the agency's own action is going to\ncontribute so marginally to environmental impacts, the\nrule -- the general rule of reason under -- under NEPA\ndoes not require an agency to, for -- for example, conduct\na -- a nationwide study of Clean Air Act possible effects\nof Mexican trucks in order to determine that its own\ncontribution is going to be minimal.\nAnd -- and what -- what -- as I mentioned, the\nagency's contribution here arises simply from developing\nan application form, a -- a preapproval analysis, on-site\nanalysis, of -- of the carrier in Mexico in most cases, or\n-- or on paper, and then follow-up monitoring and\ninspections. And the only real contribution to emissions\nthat any of that would have are the -- are the roadside\ninspections where the engine might be -- will be idling a\nlittle bit while the truck is inspected and the agency\nfully evaluated its contribution to increased emissions\nfor that and concluded that they would be negligible,\nlooked at in that way. And neither the Ninth Circuit nor\nrespondents have ever challenged that.\nAnd as I -- as I mentioned, although the -- the\nNinth Circuit treated the President's action as -- as a -\na consequence of what the agency did, the respondents have\nreceded from that position as well.\nAnd they have -- they have relied on this\nappropriations provision, section 350, as it's been\nreferred to in this litigation, which required FMCSA to do\ncertain things before it could spend any money to approve\nindividual applications of carriers that would be eligible\nunder the -- under the President's lifting of the\nmoratorium. But section 350 reinforces our position\nbecause it reinforces the proposition that the agency's\nrole was limited to safety matters.\nQUESTION: Did 350 limit itself in its\ndirections to the agency to safety matters?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. There's not -- there's no\nmention of -- of environment -- environmental issues in -\nin it. And in fact, what it did is it further constrained\nFMCSA's discretion. Whatever discretion -- and it -- and\nit overrode or made more strict the agency's initial\nproposed regulations by requiring safety evaluations in\nMexico and stringent evaluations afterward. It added some\nvery strict requirements because Congress wanted to make\nsure that the agency was going to impose -\nQUESTION: Mr. Kneedler?\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- stringent qualifications.\nQUESTION: Mr. Kneedler, can I ask you another\nkind of preliminary question? I was just reexamining the\nstatute that Justice Souter was calling your attention to.\nAnd the President, of course, is not an agency within the\nmeaning of the introductory paragraph. Does that mean\nthat an action taken by the President is not a major\nFederal action within the meaning of subparagraph (C)?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes, because it -- it -\nQUESTION: Because if I'm an agency -\nMR. KNEEDLER: They kept it -- the duty -- the\nduty is imposed on the agency. That's the way it has been\nunderstood.\nQUESTION: I see.\nMR. KNEEDLER: And the agency shall include in\nit -\nQUESTION: It should read any major Federal\naction undertaken by the agency -\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- is implicitly -\nMR. KNEEDLER: Because it says include in every\n-- the agency in -- in the introductory part shall include\nin every recommendation or report on proposals or major\nFederal action. I think it's referring to its own\nproposal for a major -- a major Federal action.\nQUESTION: And -- and we've held that? It's\ncertainly a permissible reading of it. I'm not sure it's\na necessary reading.\nMR. KNEEDLER: I don't know that this Court has\never specifically addressed it, but I think that's been\nthe common understanding. And I think it follows in this\ncase from the exemption of the President from -- from NEPA\nat all.\nAnd the -- I -- I mentioned before that section\n350 serves to confine the agency's discretion here. And\nthe -- the agency's decision that an environmental\nassessment was all that was necessary and a full-blown\nenvironmental impact statement was not required is\nreinforced in this case by the -- by decisions of a number\nof courts of appeals that have said that where an agency\ndoes not have discretion, it does not have to prepare an\nenvironmental impact statement because the purposes of\nNEPA are really to inform the agency's own decision-making\nprocess and to inform the public so it can participate in\nthe agency's decision-making process.\nWhere the agency essentially has no discretion\nabout whether to -- to go forward, as the agency here did\nnot, then to require a full-blown environmental impact\nstatement of -- of clean air issues, which are exceedingly\ncomplex, before the agency would go -- could go forward\nwould not further the purposes of -- of NEPA and would\nonly serve, in fact, to slow down the process of complying\nwith NAFTA.\nQUESTION: Well, in fact, an agency could\nproduce an EIS that said what we propose to do is\ndisastrous and nevertheless go ahead, could it not?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes, yes. NEPA imposes no\nsubstantive requirement. But -- but in this case there\nwas really a need for expedition, and it's -- and that's\n-- that's made evident here by the fact that the statute\nthat authorized the President to lift the moratorium\nprovided for the President to give notice and allow public\ncomment for that, but allowed him to waive that where\nexpeditious action was required. And when the President\nlooked at the moratorium in November of 2002, he\nspecifically invoked that provision, dispensed with\nfurther opportunity for public comment because he\ndetermined that expeditious action was required.\nIt's very much like this Court's decision in\nCrosby several terms ago in that way because the --\nalthough here it's a subordinate Federal agency rather\nthan a State, but the result is to interfere with the\nability of the President to respond promptly to an\ninternational disagreement that had arisen out of a\nforeign trade agreement.\nI did want to spend just a moment on the Clean\nAir Act conformity analysis point which the -- the\nconclusion on that we think follows directly from the\nconclusion on NEPA.\nUnder -- under EPA regulations that were\npromulgated in 1993, respondent doesn't challenge them\nhere, and the D.C. Circuit has upheld them. Under those\nregulations an -- an agency is required to conduct a\nconformity analysis and to conform its action only where\nits action causes emissions, but beyond that, where --\nwhere the emissions are subject to the agency's\npracticable control and where the agency will maintain\nthat control through continuing program authority -\nQUESTION: That is -- that is set forth in the\nregulations?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. That -- that -- and that\nregulation is set forth in our -- in our brief on page 8a\nof -- of the brief, the definition of the term, indirect\nemissions, which elsewhere is described as the emissions\nfor which the agency is responsible.\nAnd in this case, it's -- it's very clear that\nthe FMCSA does not have any control over or continuing\nresponsibility for the President's decision to lift the\nmoratorium, for the determination of whether carriers that\nget registration will actually bring trucks into the\nUnited States, what routes they will travel while in the\nUnited States, and what emissions they will have once\nthey're in the United States. Those are all things that\nare beyond the agency's control.\nQUESTION: Mr. -- Mr. Kneedler, I -- I read the\nregs the same way you do. The -- the interesting thing to\nme was, although it's probably -- I guess it's academic\nhere is that the statute seems to be broader than the regs\nbecause the -- the statute would -- would require\nattention -- and I'm reading from page 45 of your -- your\nbrief where you set it out in the carryover paragraph.\nThe -- the statute would -- would require\nattention to -- to anything by -- done by the agency which\nwould not only cause but contribute to a new air quality\n-- to an air quality violation. And I -- I would suppose\neven on the kind of the -- the low-level effect that the\nagency has disclosed here, idling motors and so on, that\nthe -- that the statute would cover it, although the regs\nare narrower and the regs wouldn't cover it. Do you read\nthe statute the same way?\nMR. KNEEDLER: The -- the regulations are an\ninterpretation of the statute the -\nQUESTION: Yes, yes.\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- that the agency adopted\nthrough notice and comment rulemaking, and the -- the\npreamble to that regulation contains a very extensive and\npersuasive discussion by EPA about why it's necessary to\ndraw a line between the things that -- for which a Federal\nagency can be reasonably held accountable or responsible\nand those for which the -- after all, the States are\nprimarily responsible in developing -\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- implementation plans.\nAnd one of the -- one of the things that -- that\nEPA specifically concluded, that it's unrealistic to think\nthat Congress meant that just because you need a permit at\nthe very outset -- we -- we quote this in our reply brief.\nJust because you need a permit to do something should not\nrender the agency responsible for every subsequent thing\nthat somebody who gets a permit might do, get a driver's\nlicense, for example, doesn't -- yes, it's a precondition\nto driving, but it doesn't mean that the permitting agency\nshould be responsible for evaluating of all the -- all\nthe -\nQUESTION: But they would have to disclose it.\nI mean, if -- if you read the statute literally, without\nthe narrow -- I -- I don't mean to load the dice when I\nsay narrowing -- without the agency interpretation, the\nstatute would be broad enough at least to -- to require\nthis agency to disclose its contribution.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, I suppose under the\nbroadest reading, but I think even that might -- might be\na extensive reading of the regulation. And let me also\njust say again that respondents have not challenged the\nvalidity of the regulation.\nQUESTION: I know.\nQUESTION: May I -- may I ask this other\nquestion just in displaying my ignorance of the whole\nproblem? But is it not conceivable that consistently with\nthe statute, that the agency could be compelled to prepare\nan environmental impact statement but nevertheless not\nsuspend the -- or nevertheless let the trucks come in?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I -- it -- it could voluntarily\ndo that, but the -- but the -- the case law -\nQUESTION: No. Assume you read the statute to\nrequire it to make a statement. Does it necessarily\nfollow that the -- the -- there must be an injunction\nagainst the trucks coming in while they -- while they do\nthat? I know normally it's -- it's done that -\nMR. KNEEDLER: No. No, it -- no, it would not\nfollow and -- and -\nQUESTION: Which the converse of that is that\neven if you're right, conceivably -- I mean, even if your\nbasic concern is right that the trucks should come in,\nconceivably the duty to prepare the statement might\nremain.\nMR. KNEEDLER: NEPA has -- has not been\ninterpreted that way over the years where an -\nQUESTION: But this -- this case involves the\nPresident, so it's a very unusual case.\nMR. KNEEDLER: But -- but even in the non\npresidential case where an agency does not have\ndiscretion, because the EIS is designed to inform the\nagency's decision-making power, and if it really has no -\nno latitude in its decision-making, it would be\nessentially pointless to prepare it.\nQUESTION: Yes, but assuming it was an agency\nthat had some discretion in the matter, my understanding\nis it -- it can't go ahead without first making the\nenvironmental impact statement.\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, that's true, but -- but we do\nthink that there is some room for remedial discretion\nwhere -- where even if there's a violation, the -- not to\nmention the -- the principle of prejudicial error under\nthe APA that if there's -- if there's a defect, it doesn't\nalways have to result in setting it aside.\nIf I may reserve the balance of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Kneedler.\nMr. Weissglass, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN WEISSGLASS\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. WEISSGLASS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nCongress gave FMCSA important choices to make\nabout safety before any trucks come over the border from\nMexico. Those choices will determine which trucks come in\nand how many.\nThe reason for that is because as the safety\nrules are made more stringent, fewer trucks will be able\nto meet the requirements and those that do will be newer.\nQUESTION: But this wasn't your argument. Your\nargument was, as -- as I understood it, that the reason\nthe EIS had to be prepared was not because there would be\nany substantial environmental impact from the nature of\nthe safety standards, but because no trucks at all can\ncome in until -- until the agency comes out with this -\nwith these standards. Isn't that right?\nMR. WEISSGLASS: The -- the argument is that\nbecause Congress promulgated section 350 -\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. WEISSGLASS: -- no trucks can come in until\nthe agency makes these safety choices.\nQUESTION: Okay. Therefore, that's a\nconsequence of the agency action. Therefore, the agency\nhas to do an EIS.\nMR. WEISSGLASS: That is correct. And in\naddition, the -\nQUESTION: Now, just let me ask. The -- that\nhappens because the President's action is triggered by or\ncannot occur until the agency takes this action.\nSuppose you have a mad millionaire who has\napplied for a -- a license from the Federal Communications\nCommission and there are others who are competing for the\nsame license, and he announces that if he is denied the\nlicense and the license is given to somebody else, he is\ngoing to unleash a flood of trucks around the country,\npouring out emissions and -- and greatly affecting the -\nthe air quality throughout the country. Does the FCC,\nknowing that this is going to be the consequence of their\ngranting the license to this particular individual -- does\nit have to do an environmental impact statement?\nMR. WEISSGLASS: The -- the question -\nQUESTION: Concerning, you know, what the\nenvironmental impact of the -- of the mad millionaire's\nactions are going to be?\nMR. WEISSGLASS: The -- the only question is\nwhether the -- first -- there are two questions. First,\nwhether that the agency has control over -- over the\nchoices that it's making, and second -\nQUESTION: Has no control over the mad\nmillionaire, just as this agency has no control over the\nPresident.\nMR. WEISSGLASS: If -- if the -- if the -- if it\ncomes down to foreseeability, when the agency takes -\nQUESTION: The mad millionaire put it in\nwriting. It -- it's sworn to. It's absolutely certain\nhe's going to do it. He really is crazy.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. WEISSGLASS: The -- the critical point is -\nis whether the agency has a choice about the -- the\noptions that it is going to take. If the agency has\ncontrol over what it's going to do, and in the reasonably\nforeseeable -\nQUESTION: It does. It does. It can deny the\nlicense to this person and give it to somebody else.\nMR. WEISSGLASS: Right. Then -- then the\nquestion just becomes foreseeability, and if it's\nforeseeable, the agency then has to take account the -\nthe effects of the -\nQUESTION: So the FCC would have to do an EIS in\nthis situation.\nMR. WEISSGLASS: In that situation, that is\ncorrect.\nQUESTION: That's absurd.\nMR. WEISSGLASS: But that -\nQUESTION: Fine. Now, suppose -\nQUESTION: That is so absurd.\nQUESTION: -- instead of the mad millionaire,\nwhat the -- we have the mad millionaire. But now what the\nstatute says is every license that's issued for safety -\nsafety purposes -- has to be a stamp that you put in the\ncar, and then there's a rule that says, no stamp shall\nissue until the Post Office Department certifies it will\nbe red or blue. All right? And moreover, there could be\nan environmental impact just from the red and blue. I\nmean, one reflects the --\nNow, the Post Office knows that if it tells you\nwhat color it is, then they'll have it, and if they have\nit, they give out the license. And if they give out the\nlicense, the mad millionaire is going to let loose smoke\nthroughout the Nation. Does that mean that the Post\nOffice Department has to write an environmental impact\nstatement about the mad millionaire? No. The answer is\nclearly no. Isn't it?\nBut the only problem is your theory doesn't tell\nme why.\nMR. WEISSGLASS: The -- the reason is this. In\n-- in this case the agency has significant choices to make\nabout safety. Congress -\nQUESTION: And so does the Post Office. It's\ngoing to be red or blue. Now, the relationship between\nthe red and blue choice and environmental being wrecked\nthrough the smoke of the mad millionaire is zero. And\nnow, you want to say that's not true with this safety\nregulation. So explain why.\nMR. WEISSGLASS: Because it's -- it's what\nCongress -- it's how Congress set up the -- the situation.\nCongress said that no trucks come in until the agency\nmakes these choices and Congress gave the agency\ndiscretion about those choices and those choices will\ndetermine which trucks come in and how many and therefore\nthe environmental effects.\nNow, just because the -- there is -- there is\nanother actor that has to make decisions and has to take\naction before there will be any environmental effects does\nnot remove this from major Federal action.\nThat's the Robertson case that this Court\ndecided where the agency has to decide yes or no to issue\na permit. Upon issuing the permit, nothing will happen\nuntil a private construction company builds a ski resort.\nThat -- that is -- that is what -- what is going\non here. The -- the agency has this significant choice to\nmake about what to do in its -- in its regulations, and\nonce it makes that choice, but only then, will the trucks\nbe over -\nQUESTION: Now, was this the basis for the Ninth\nCircuit decision?\nMR. WEISSGLASS: I -- I believe this was the\nbasis for the Ninth Circuit decision. The President and\nthe agency have separate actions to take, and it's not\nthat -\nQUESTION: But -- but in -- in -\nQUESTION: But the Ninth Circuit seemed to me to\nspeak in terms of but-for causation and that just because\nthe agency knew that many more trucks were going to be\ncoming in, even though as a result of somebody else, the\nfact that the agency -- that they couldn't come in until\nthe agency acted meant that the agency had to do an EIS.\nThat -- that seems a very doubtful proposition to me.\nMR. WEISSGLASS: It really is very similar to\nthe Robertson scenario. The construction company couldn't\ntake any action until they got the permit.\nQUESTION: Yes, but the permit could have\nforbidden the action. The permit related to whether --\nthe -- the agency's decision related to whether this\nconstruction company could build a ski resort or not.\nThis agency's action has no bearing upon -- upon the\nenvironment. It has no bearing upon whether the -- the\nPresident can take his independent action. It's just been\nartificially connected just the way the mad millionaire's\nwas.\nMR. WEISSGLASS: Justice Scalia, the -- the\ndifference -\nQUESTION: They -- they were not part of the -\nof the program to decide whether the ski resort is going\nto be built.\nMR. WEISSGLASS: The -- the difference here is\nthat the agency has significant choices to make about\nsafety. It can determine, in fact, how many older trucks\nare going to be coming in. And it's the older trucks that\nare more polluting. And -- and -\nQUESTION: No, but can't the -- isn't the\nagency's discretion to determine whether older trucks come\nin or not a discretion which is supposed to be exercised\non the basis of safety considerations rather than\nenvironmental considerations?\nMR. WEISSGLASS: But that's the point of NEPA,\nthat -- what NEPA says is just because you have a safety\nagency doesn't mean it can divorce its safety\nconsiderations from the environment. It doesn't have\nto -\nQUESTION: Those safety considerations that are\nwithin its control that would be affected by its safety\nregulations are minimal. I don't think anybody said that\nthis would have been a major Federal action requiring an\nenvironmental impact statement if there were nothing\ninvolved except whether these safety rules are going to\ncause more pollution or not. Your -- what you're using to\nrequire the EIS is the fact that, boom, once they come out\nwith their safety rules, floods of -- of Mexican trucks\ncome into the country.\nMR. WEISSGLASS: That's part of it, but the -\nbut it's also true that what the agency does can -- can\nhave a huge effect in terms of how many trucks are\nactually going to come over. Even if you assume that some\ntrucks are definitely going to come over, what the agency\ndoes is -- is going to have a big effect.\nThe agency specifically says that the rules are\ngoing to target high-risk trucks -- and this is from the\nenvironmental assessment -- to, quote, bring them into\ncompliance with United States safety and environmental\nlaws. The agency knew that there was this correlation\nbetween safety and the environment. And we're talking\nabout tens of thousands of trucks, and a Mexican fleet\nthat is skewed much older than the U.S. fleet.\nQUESTION: Well, don't -- don't the rules have\nto be such that American trucks and Mexican trucks are\ntreated alike?\nMR. WEISSGLASS: I -- there's -- actually the -\nthe arbitral panel in NAFTA specifically said that the\nU.S. could treat Mexican trucks differently than U.S.\ntrucks as long as it has a good reason. But the Court\ndoesn't even -\nQUESTION: But doesn't it -- I mean, would it be\na good reason -- I mean, I take it you're here not being\nagainst Mexicans. You're against environment.\nMR. WEISSGLASS: We're for environment.\nQUESTION: So if in fact -- yes. I mean for\nenvironment.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: You're against bad environment. All\nright. We're all against that.\nNow, if in fact it turns out that there is some\nkind of problem, is -- does the agency have the power to\nsay if there's too much smoke or there's too much bad\neffect, we want American trucks to have to tighten up too?\nWe don't want just Mexican trucks to have to. We want\neverybody to have to.\nMR. WEISSGLASS: Yes.\nQUESTION: Was that your position in front of\nthe agency?\nMR. WEISSGLASS: The agency does have that --\nthat power. The -- the -\nQUESTION: All right. Then do they also have to\nstudy the impact of the American trucks?\nMR. WEISSGLASS: If -- if the agency takes major\naction with respect to emissions of U.S. trucks, yes.\nQUESTION: No, no. But I mean, here you're\nsaying that this 350 requires them to start looking at all\nthe smoke and so forth that comes up from the Mexican\ntrucks because their safety regs could have an impact on\nthat. Well, if in fact the overall framework of this\ninquiry is to make certain that we don't pollute the\nenvironment or that we're safe in a context where Mexicans\nand Americans are to be treated alike, wouldn't they have\nto go into the whole thing?\nMR. WEISSGLASS: No, because the agency\nrulemakings that we challenge deal solely with the -- with\n-- with trucks coming over from Mexico. Now, if they were\nto do a rulemaking about U.S. trucks, then that might be\nan issue. But this is relating solely to Mexico.\nAnd -- and there are numerous -- numerous things\nthat the agency can do that -- that -- about safety of -\nof trucks coming over from -- the border from Mexico that\nwill cause the older trucks that are both less safe and\nmore polluting not to be able to come in.\nQUESTION: Were -- were these points pressed on\nthe agency during the proceedings?\nMR. WEISSGLASS: The -- the agency -\nQUESTION: Can you answer yes or no?\nMR. WEISSGLASS: Yes.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. WEISSGLASS: The -- there were numerous\ncomments to the agency about safety, and the agency, as I\nmentioned before -\nQUESTION: But to say there were numerous\ncomments about safety doesn't certainly answer my\nquestion.\nMR. WEISSGLASS: The -- the agency said that it\nwas going to target high-risk trucks to be in compliance\nwith safety and environmental laws. And because the rules\nonly deal with safety, that's a concession that safety\nchoices affect the environment. Nothing else needed to be\ntold to the agency.\nQUESTION: Well -\nQUESTION: So your -- your answer to my question\nis no I guess, that you did not press on the agency this\npoint. You say the agency already knew it.\nMR. WEISSGLASS: The -- right. The agency knew\nit and the public was not required to cause the agency to\nconnect the dots.\nQUESTION: Knew -- knew what?\nMR. WEISSGLASS: The agency knew that there was\na --\nQUESTION: That -- that high-risk trucks are\nwhat? More polluting?\nMR. WEISSGLASS: The -- the agency knew that -\nthat older trucks are both less safe and more polluting,\nthat there's a correlation -\nQUESTION: Between pollution and age.\nMR. WEISSGLASS: And -- and that -- and it\nspecifically -\nQUESTION: And was that brought to the agency's\nattention as one of the things that they should take into\naccount in -- in their safety rules?\nMR. WEISSGLASS: The -- the agency had it -\nsaid it in its environmental assessment and what I just\nsaid. And the public commented that the older trucks are\nmore polluting. And the agency admits it's a matter of\ncommon sense that the older trucks are less safe.\nQUESTION: The agency did take it into account\nin its environmental assessment and concluded that there\nwas no significant environmental impact just from the\ncontent of its rules, and therefore they didn't have to do\nan EIS.\nAnd I -- I had thought that it was not that call\nthat you're challenging. I had thought that what you're\nchallenging is that may well be true, that -- that just\nfrom the content of the rules, there's no significant\nimpact. However, the rules trigger the presidential\naction which lets in the Mexican trucks and that is the\nsignificant environmental impact. Wasn't that the\naccurate -- an accurate description of your case?\nMR. WEISSGLASS: Yes, both that and the choices\nthat the agency makes which will determine not only\nwhether any trucks come in but how many.\nQUESTION: Not the choices alone. I do -- I do\nnot -- I do not understand you to have claimed that purely\non the basis of what safety choices the agency makes,\nthere is a significant impact upon the environment which\nwould be enough to trigger a requirement for an EIS. Is\n-- is that claim made in your -\nMR. WEISSGLASS: We absolutely did -- did make\nthat claim in -- in -\nQUESTION: All right. Can you point to that?\nBecause that -- to me, that's what your answer to the\nproblem, you know, with the decal color. It -- it really\ndepended on that. And I do believe that they're saying -\nand on that one, it seems to me, look, you have choice A\nat the agency, B, or C, and this is more polluting than\nthat and the other isn't. I don't see why they wouldn't\nhave to write an EIS for that. But I think that's what\nthey're saying you never raised before the agency.\nSo could you tell me or could I get somewhere or\nis it in here the place that's particularly before the\nagency where all this was gone into and raised?\nQUESTION: And too, where it was raised before\nthe Ninth Circuit.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. WEISSGLASS: If I could, I'd like to start\nwith the Ninth Circuit. We raised it in our reply brief,\nas Mr. Kneedler said. And the Ninth Circuit passed on it.\nQUESTION: No, no. But that's not the issue.\nThe issue really is the agency for me.\nMR. WEISSGLASS: Okay.\nQUESTION: I mean, where -- where before the\nagency was it raised?\nMR. WEISSGLASS: The -- the agency, as I said,\nagreed there's this correlation between safety and the\nenvironment. There -- the public did not need to tell the\nagency what to do with that because Vermont Yankee makes\nit an obligation of the agency to consider every\nsignificant aspect of the environmental effects of its\naction. This is not a situation like in Vermont Yankee\nwhere someone raised an issue about unchartered territory\nand refused to clarify. The agency has an affirmative\nobligation to take this into account because it had the\npredicate facts in front of it.\nQUESTION: All right. Are you saying we didn't\nraise it before the agency? The reason we didn't is that\nwe didn't have to. All we had to do was raise it when we\nappealed from the agency. Is that your answer?\nMR. WEISSGLASS: You said it much better than I\ncould. Yes.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nQUESTION: But if that's your answer, then you\ndidn't raise it, and then the question would be does an\nagency have to have figured out here that its different\nalternatives in front of it might have had differential\nenvironmental impacts that they didn't take account of.\nNow, how am I going to answer that question?\nMR. WEISSGLASS: The answer is yes.\nQUESTION: I know you think -\nMR. WEISSGLASS: Because -\nQUESTION: -- it's yes. I want to know what I\nread -\nMR. WEISSGLASS: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- and try to -- try to figure out\nwhether it is yes.\nMR. WEISSGLASS: Because -\nQUESTION: What -- what -- go ahead.\nMR. WEISSGLASS: Because -- thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice.\nBecause in the joint appendix at page 193, the\nagency admits this correlation, and it was also record\nevidence before the agency that the Mexican fleet is much\nolder than the U.S. fleet, that the older trucks are more\npolluting. And so it stands to reason -- and -- and this\nis what the agency has to do when it's considering\nenvironmental effects is look at what its safety choices\nare going to do in terms of the environment.\nQUESTION: Well, why did -- why did you wait\nuntil the petition for rehearing in the Ninth -- Ninth\nCircuit to raise it before that court?\nMR. WEISSGLASS: It wasn't rehearing. It was on\na reply brief. It was in response to the agency's\nadmission in its opposition brief that the stringency of\nthe standards does have this effect.\nQUESTION: What -- here is -- here's what the\nNinth Circuit said. DOT's assessment that its regulations\nwill cause emissions below the amounts specified in 40\nC.F.R. 93, thus excusing it from making a conformitory\ndetermination is based on the predicted emissions in its\nEA. As we have already determined, however, DOT failed to\nconduct a reliable environmental analysis because of its\nillusory distinction between the effects of the\nregulations themselves, which is what we've been talking\nabout, and the effects of the presidential rescission of\nthe moratorium.\nIt seems to me it was essential to the Ninth\nCircuit's decision that you have to take into account,\nbefore -- before you win, the -- the impact of the\nPresident's decision. The Ninth Circuit did not base it\njust on the effects of the regulations themselves.\nMR. WEISSGLASS: The -- and the Ninth Circuit\nalso said that the -- the environmental assessment was\ninadequate for, quote, not considering additional\nalternatives such as, for example, proposing more\nstringent controls on incoming Mexican trucks. The Ninth\nCircuit clearly recognized that there was this correlation\nbetween a stringency of the rules and the environmental\neffects.\nNow, it's very important to understand that the\nway Congress set this up was it's not that the agency is\nsomehow overriding a presidential decision. There are two\nseparate and independent decisions here. The President\nhas authority over trade issues the way Congress gave him\nthat authority. But the Congress at the same time said\nthat the agency has authority over safety issues. These\nare two separate things.\nQUESTION: Yes, it's true that the Ninth Circuit\nsaid just what you said it said, but it was quoting the\ngeneral requirement, I think, which exists in the way you\ndescribe it. And here, I guess the question is, is given\ntheir environmental assessment, had they failed to fulfill\nthat requirement and so it would require somebody to point\nout to them, look at this environmental assessment. This\nenvironmental assessment is not adequate to fulfill that\nrequirement that we all know exists. Now, what about\nthat?\nMR. WEISSGLASS: The -- I'm not quite sure I\nunderstand the question.\nQUESTION: Remember, what we're talking about\nnow is the agency is considering alternative A, B, or C.\nThey all involve safety. They're likely to have\ndifferential impacts on smoke and so forth. And now they\nhave in front of them an environmental assessment, and the\nenvironmental assessment explains to them why they don't\nhave to do more than they've done in respect to just what\nwe're talking about. Everyone agrees that the requirement\nis what you said. The Ninth Circuit says it. Who told\nthe agency that this EA is inadequate when it tells you\nyou don't have to do more in respect to that to assessing\none, two, and three, you know, et cetera.\nMR. WEISSGLASS: The -- the agency -\nQUESTION: I think that's -\nMR. WEISSGLASS: -- issued the -- the\nenvironmental assessment and then asked for comment on it\nafter it had already issued the interim final rules.\nThere were comments to the agency, and as I've said, they\ndidn't specifically say this. But the agency was\nchallenged in the Ninth Circuit and that issue was raised.\nAnd that is enough because the -- the agency had before it\nall the predicate facts to take into account the\nrelationship between the stringency of the safety rules\nand the environment. It knew the effects of its actions.\nIt specifically said that high-risk trucks are both more\n-- more polluting and less safe.\nIt had to do that. That's what NEPA requires.\nNEPA doesn't require a citizen to come in and tell the\nagency what its options are. It requires the agency to\ntake that action.\nQUESTION: Does this agency have the authority\nto exclude a perfectly safe truck because in its view it's\nan older truck and will pollute more? Is that within the\nscope of what the agency can do?\nMR. WEISSGLASS: The agency is to make safety\nchoices.\nQUESTION: Safety choices.\nMR. WEISSGLASS: And in doing that it's -- under\nNEPA must take a hard look at the environmental effect on\nthe safety choices.\nQUESTION: No. It -- it has to describe the\nenvironmental effects perhaps, but if -- if it does not\nhave any -- any power on the basis of environmental\neffects to alter the safety regulations -- I mean, two\ntrucks are equivalently safe. Can this agency say, yes,\nyou're both just as safe, but as a safety regulator, I'm\nnot going to let you in because you pollute more? That\nhas nothing to do with the agency's job as -- as a safety\nregulator.\nMR. WEISSGLASS: The -- the agency is not\nrequired to let any truck in. The agency is -- must\nregister -\nQUESTION: That's true, but it has to exclude it\non the basis of safety considerations.\nMR. WEISSGLASS: That is correct. And in\nlooking at the safety considerations, what it's going -\nwhat it is going to promulgate for the broad class of\ntrucks, not each individual truck -- it is promulgating a\nbroad class of safety regulations. Any truck that meets\nthat standard, yes, the agency must let in. But in\ndeciding what that standard should be, that general\nstandard, the agency not only can, but has an obligation\nto look at the environmental effects -\nQUESTION: Are -- are you saying that because\nthere are varying environmental effects as between old\ntrucks and new trucks, the agency's obligation is to find\na safety hook in order to keep out the old rather than the\nnew?\nMR. WEISSGLASS: The -- no. The agency does not\n-- does not -\nQUESTION: And we'll -- we'll find that the -\nyou know, the signal lights don't work quite so well on\nthe old trucks and we'll use that as a basis to keep them\nout so there -- so we can minimize environmental damage?\nMR. WEISSGLASS: The agency does not have that\nobligation because NEPA does not require substantive\ndecisions. But what NEPA requires is that the agency take\na look at those effects.\nQUESTION: All right. Then -- excuse me. Let\nme -- let me ask you this question.\nLet's assume the agency concluded that on all\nsignificant safety factors, the old trucks are just as\ngood as the new trucks. It also concluded that the old\ntrucks pollute more. There -- there is an environmental\ndifference. The agency cannot keep out the old trucks for\nthat reason alone. My question is, does the agency have\nto prepare an impact statement saying we're letting in the\nold as well as the new, but in letting in the old, we're\nletting in more highly polluting trucks? Do they have to\nprepare that statement even though their action is, and\nlegally can be, the same with respect to the old as to the\nnew?\nMR. WEISSGLASS: Yes, as long as the agency has\n-- has a significant choice to make about what the\nstandards should be.\nQUESTION: Suppose under Justice Souter's\nquestion, the agency has no choice and it must let in the\ntrucks. Does it still have to prepare the EIS?\nMR. WEISSGLASS: If the agency has no choice -\nQUESTION: Or the EA.\nMR. WEISSGLASS: -- then -- then under a number\nof circuit court cases, which the Government cited, the\nagency would not have to do it. And that's an open\nquestion for this Court, but the Court doesn't need to\nreach it.\nQUESTION: No. But you're -- you're saying, I\nthink, suppose the agency is trying to choose between two\nheadlight inspections a year or one. All right. Now, if\nyou have two a year, in fact, there will be fewer trucks.\nIf you go to one a year, there might be more trucks coming\nin and then you will have more pollution.\nNow, if that's a significant difference, then I\nguess the agency does have to go into it. But if they\nhave an EA that tells them, you know, it's not that big a\ndeal because they're going to be about the same number of\ntrucks regardless, then I would think the burden would be\non the environmentalists to show that that's really wrong.\nAnd I think that's the kind of argument you're making.\nAnd you're telling me that it's so obviously wrong that\neven though you didn't raise it in the agency, they should\nhave figured it out. Is -- is that where we are?\nMR. WEISSGLASS: That -- I think that is\naccurate about where we are. And -- and the fact is that\nthere were numerous comments to the agency about the\nsafety things that it should have done and didn't, and\nthere are numerous -- there's numerous -- there's a lot of\nroom between the standards that are being imposed on\ntrucks coming over the border from Mexico and the\nstandards that are in -- on U.S. trucks.\nThe agency could have made choices that would\naffect this, that would affect the safety, and that would\nalso affect the environment. And the agency concedes\nthat. The agency concedes it had the discretion, and it\nconcedes that this could affect the environment.\nWhat the agency does is say that that's all\nabout the President because the President lifted the\nmoratorium. But where that is a mistake is because\nCongress was the -- was the body that said when trucks can\ncome over, and it gave both the President and the agency\nseparate authority over that. So it all goes back to\nCongress in making this -- this foreign commerce decision.\nNow, before I finish my argument, I did want to\ntalk about the Clean Air Act because this is very\nimportant. Justice Souter raised this point. The way the\nagency reads the regulations, it -- it would -- it would\nbe completely out of accord with the language of the\nstatute which --\nQUESTION: Did -- did you challenge the regs?\nMR. WEISSGLASS: We -- we did not challenge the\nregs, but we read the regs -\nQUESTION: Isn't that the end of the issue?\nMR. WEISSGLASS: No, because we read the regs\nvery differently than the agency. The agency -- the -\nthe way the -- the particular regulation reads is that\nit's not just where -\nQUESTION: Where -- where are you? On 46?\nQUESTION: 8a, page 8a, isn't it?\nQUESTION: 46 of your brief or where?\nMR. WEISSGLASS: Actually the -- the critical -\nthe critical regulation that the Government raised was in\nits reply brief. It's on page 17 of the -- of the reply\nbrief.\nAnd -- and there is the definition of continuing\nprogram responsibility because once the -- the -- you get\npast the cause point -- and EPA is very clear that under\nthe Clean Air Act, it's but-for causation. It says that.\nAnd so we clearly have that here.\nThen the question is whether the agency has a\ncontinuing program responsibility. And there are two\nsentences that are separate formulations of when there is\nthat responsibility. The -- the Government relies solely\non the first sentence, which we do not rely on. That's\nwhen an agency requires some activities.\nBut the second sentence is the critical\nsentence, which is when an agency, quote, takes actions\nitself or imposes conditions that result in air pollutant\nemissions. Well, in this case, the agency is -- is taking\naction and imposing conditions that are going to result in\nemissions because under 350, no trucks come in at all\nuntil the agency makes these choices and because in making\nthe choices, it's imposing conditions that are going to be\nabsolutely determinative as to what the -- the pollutants\n-- how much pollution there's going to be. If the agency\nratchets up its -- its controls, there's going to be less\npollution. The agency admits that.\nQUESTION: I thought they were relying on the\nregulation on page 8a of the Government's principal brief.\nThat's certainly what they raised in their -- in their\nargument here, which -- which makes whatever this other\nregulation says quite irrelevant because it's a definition\nof emissions. And it says that to be an indirect emission\nwithin the act, the Federal agency must have -- must be\nable to practicably control and maintain control over the\nemissions due to a continuing program responsibility.\nMR. WEISSGLASS: That's right, and the\nregulation I've just read is the definition of continuing\nprogram responsibility. The agency clearly has a\ncontinuing program responsibility here because as it's\nenforcing the regs that it -- that it writes, it's going\nto determine how much pollution there is. And it clearly\npracticably controls the emissions because, as I said,\nboth without some choices, there's going to be no trucks\nand once the agency makes the choices, those choices are\ngoing to determine how much pollution comes in because\nthat's how many trucks and what type are coming in.\nQUESTION: Well, I -- I guess that any -- any\nFederal licensing agency for -- for automobiles or\nanything else would -- would come within this and would\nhave to -- you know, if I don't issue a license, I can\npracticably control the -- the amount of emissions, even\nthough the agency is not a -- an emissions approving\nagency. It's -- it's giving driver's licenses.\nMR. WEISSGLASS: The -- the -- this is the\ntradeoff that Congress made in requiring States to meet\nclean air requirements. It said, yes, we're going to --\nwe're going to take a stick to the States, as this Court\nhas said, but we're not going to make it more difficult as\na -- as a Federal agency for the States to meet its --\ntheir responsibilities under the Clean Air Act. That\nwould be horribly unfair. And that's why the statute is\nso broad that if the --\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Weissglass.\nMr. Kneedler, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. KNEEDLER: Several things, Mr. Chief\nJustice.\nThe -- the critical point here is that the\nagency had no discretion to deny certification to Mexican\ntrucks that were eligible under -- under the President's\nlifting of the moratorium if they satisfied the -- the\nrequirement that they'd be willing and able to comply with\nthe -- with the statutory standards. So the agency was\nreally acting under two imperatives. One is its\npreexisting organic statute and then secondly, the\nPresident's lifting of a moratorium that required the -\nthe Government to live up to its obligations under NAFTA.\nQUESTION: What -- I'd like to hear your\nresponse to the argument, which I didn't realize they were\nmaking independently, that just based on the agency's\navailable choices, it could have made the safety -- have\ndifferent safety regulations. That was a sufficient\neffect on the environment that they had to do a -\nMR. KNEEDLER: They did not -- they did not --\nwhat -- what they're really arguing is that the agency\nshould have considered some other alternative. The agency\nanalyzed essentially two alternatives, go forward under\nour existing regulations -- again, these are procedural,\nnot substantive regulations, just regulations designed to\nidentify whether carriers satisfy substantive standards -\neither to go forward under -- under preexisting or -- or\nintroduce new ones.\nThe respondents never said to the agency,\nthere's a third alternative. You can make your new\nregulations even more stringent and here's what you could\ndo. And in fact, even now, they don't identify what\nfurther strengths -\nQUESTION: They're -- they're making basically\nthe argument you said they waived.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes.\nQUESTION: You know, I mean, that's been pretty\nmuch our whole discussion. And I think on that, the\nGovernment says, well, they're right in principle.\nThey're saying -- I mean, if in fact an agency has a\nchoice, A, B, or C, and if you choose A, there's a lot of\nsmoke; B, a little smoke; and C, no smoke, well, they\nought to go analyze it under an EIS. I think you agree\nwith that.\nMR. KNEEDLER: But --\nQUESTION: But you're saying, well, they never\nmade that point.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right.\nQUESTION: They said, but it's so obvious we\ndidn't have to make it, and besides, when we got to the\nNinth Circuit, at least in the reply brief, we did make\nit.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. Well, the important thing\nis -\nQUESTION: All right. So what's your response\nto that?\nMR. KNEEDLER: The -- the -- first of all, the\nagency -- the agency did an EA in order to determine it\ndidn't have to produce an environmental impact statement.\nIf they were wrong on that, that should have been called\nto their attention on this precise point, specifically\nthat the agency should have adopted an even more stringent\nalternative. And it's -- and even now, they don't\nidentify one that the agency could do that wouldn't be -\nessentially be a pretext, Justice Souter, as you were\nsuggesting, that would be consistent with their duty to\nlet in trucks and -- and still have -- have more\nflexibility.\nWhat they quote for this is on page 193 of the\njoint appendix in the environmental assessment. It's\nimportant to recognize that that is a portion of the -- of\nthe environmental assessment that repeats that our own\nactions, including the inspections, are not going to have\na substantial impact on the environment. But even so, we\ncan -- we can mitigate that tiny impact, and it's in that\ncontext where the agency says, we can try to screen out\nthe dirtier trucks. And there's a reference to\nenvironment. It's unclear what it means, but I think two\npages later the court identifies that there could be leaks\nfrom a truck that would be identified during an inspection\nthey could turn over to environmental people from the\nState. So it's focused on a very narrow question, whether\n-- whether the inspections would -- would increase the\nemissions.\nAnd respondents have never really challenged the\nnotion, which is what's being addressed here, that -- that\nthe increased inspections under these rules would have an\nimpact on -- on the environment.\nI did want to address the -- the Clean Air Act\nregulations. We did not raise the regulation that's\nquoted on page 17 of our brief. We relied, as Justice\nScalia pointed out, on the -- under the indirect\nemissions. As I mentioned, the -- the agency has no\ncontinuing control. It isn't the control at the outset.\nIt's control over the subsequent activities, which is the\nword in the regulation, and the -- this agency, a safety\ncertifying agency, has no continuing control over where\nthese trucks will travel in the U.S., even whether the -\neven whether the particular trucks come into the U.S. -\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nKneedler.\n"
