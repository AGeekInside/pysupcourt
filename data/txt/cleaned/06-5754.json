COCHRAN\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. COCHRAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nUnder the system described in\nJustice Breyer's opinion for the Court in Booker, judges\nwould no longer be tied to the sentencing range\nindicated in the guidelines. That, of course, was a\npassage from this Court's recent decision in Cunningham\nversus California. Mr. Rita is asking the Court in this\ncase to reiterate in strong enforceable terms that it\nmeant what it said in Booker, that the guidelines are\nmerely advisory provisions. The Government's assertion\nthat the guidelines deserve a presumption of\nreasonableness was nothing more than an unfounded claim\nput forth to justify its efforts to try and thwart the\nBooker decision.\nThe ink wasn't given a chance to dry on the\nBooker decision before the Department of Justice issued\na memo to all of its Federal prosecutors directing that\nthey adhere to the guidelines and that they seek\nsentences within the guidelines in all but extraordinary\ncases.\nThe district court below in this case did\nnot treat the guidelines as advisory when it imposed a\n33-month within guideline sentence. The district court\ndid not consider Mr. Rita's military record, the fact\nthat he had been a combat soldier in two wars.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How can you say that,\ngiven that at the sentencing hearing, that military\nrecord was brought out, his physical ailments were\nbrought out, his activity in law enforcement, all that\nwas brought out? And indeed, the judge was assisting\nthe defense attorney to make the case clearer when it\nwas presented.\nMR. COCHRAN: In the district court,\nMr. Rita did put forward evidence of his military\nrecords, health concerns, he -- the district court\nreceived that information. The district court did not\nconsider that information because there's nothing in the\nrecord where the district judge weighed any of that\ninformation to determine what -- what effect to give any\nof it.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, you know, you don't\nget a summary judgment case all the time. I used to get\nthem, and the district court would hear all the\narguments and write down the word denied. Does that\nmean he didn't consider the arguments? That's a very\ncommon thing. Here we have a district judge, he hears\nall the arguments. The attorneys brought it out. It's\nin the file. He reads the presentence report. It's all\nthere, and the judge says, on balance, I'm going to go\napply the guidelines. So how can you say he didn't\nconsider them?\nMR. COCHRAN: Justice Breyer, the district\njudge didn't say that we're going to weigh all of the\nstuff, and I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, he doesn't in a summary\njudgment case either. I mean, I've had quite a few of\nthem, I used to, I think, where they just wrote denied.\nThat was the opinion.\nMR. COCHRAN: Well, in the instance of a\nsummary judgment matter, we don't have 3553(c), that\nrequires the district court to state in open court in\nfront of the defendant the reasons for the imposition of\nsentence.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, he says the reasons\nare these. I think that the guidelines sentence is a\nreasonable sentence. Would that be sufficient?\nMR. COCHRAN: It would not, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why not? What in the\nstatute or the law or the Constitution says that a\ndistrict judge, although it might be good form in a\ndifficult case to write more, but I've often written\nopinions where I say, and the remaining arguments we\nfeel are not sufficient to change the result. That\nmeans I don't think they're that great an argument, and\nI don't answer every single one.\nMR. COCHRAN: With regard to the first\nquestion Your Honor posed, it's not sufficient for the\ndistrict court to simply state conclusions, which is\nwhat happened in this case, that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Where in the law does it\nsay that?\nMR. COCHRAN: Well, in 3553(c), it requires\nthat the judge give the reasons for the imposition of\nthe particular sentence.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Where -- I'm looking at\nthat. It says shall consider. Am I missing something?\nMR. COCHRAN: The preamble states --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you give me your page\ncite?\nMR. COCHRAN: I'm sorry, Your Honor, on page\n3-A of Petitioner's brief in the appendix. It states,\n\"the court at the time of sentencing shall state in open\ncourt the reasons for its imposition of the particular\nsentence.\" And that's what we contend requires the\ndistrict court to explain the facts that the court is\nrelying on to impose the particular sentence in the\ncase.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So it isn't sufficient, in\nyour view, that the judge just says, the reason I\nimposed this sentence is that's the guideline sentence,\nand I think in this circumstance it's reasonable?\nMR. COCHRAN: That's correct, Your Honor.\nBecause the guidelines don't take into account all the\nmyriad facts, and in this case, did not take into\naccount the military record, the employment record,\nMr. Rita's health concerns. The guidelines specifically\ndid not take those into account.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I think these other factors\nthat have been brought out, while they're serious\nfactors, I don't think they're enough to warrant a\ndifferent sentence. Suppose he adds those words?\nMR. COCHRAN: Your Honor, I think the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What I'm worried about\nbasically is, I don't think in the law there's a special\ncategory that requires a judge to give special reasons\nin a guideline case. I think it's the same as any other\nmatter. Judges do normally give reasons. And I'd worry\na bit about creating a special situation where district\njudges have to do something unusual.\nMR. COCHRAN: I don't think that this is\nunusual, Your Honor. I think the court has to explain\nthe rationale for imposing the sentence, and not only\ndoes it have to do so in court, in front of the\ndefendant, so the defendant understands the sentence\nthat he is receiving --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I get where you're\ngoing. Can I say this in an opinion, would this satisfy\nyou? And of course, like any other matter, judges do\nnormally give reasons. They do normally reject\narguments with reasons, and it's the same here. Would\nthat satisfy you?\nMR. COCHRAN: I think it would have to be\nspecific to the issues raised by the parties. And in\nthis case, at a minimum, the judge would have to address\nthe three issues that Mr. Rita put forward and discuss\nthose: His military record, his employment, his health\nconcerns. It would have to address any issues that the\nGovernment would raise, and any issues that the district\njudge was considering that maybe neither party had\nraised to the court as well.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How do you reconcile the\nlanguage in the prologue of (c) which says, the court\nshall state the reasons, with (c)(2), which says that if\nthe sentence is not of the kind or is outside the range\ndescribed in (a)(4) of the guidelines, the court shall\nstate the specific reason for the imposition of a\nsentence different from the guidelines?\nNow, this seems to set up some dichotomy\nbetween giving reasons and giving the specific reason.\nWhere does that line fall in your estimation?\nMR. COCHRAN: Well, I think foremost, Your\nHonor, is that that provision came about prior to the\nBooker decision when the guidelines were mandatory. And\nwhat that addresses and what it was meant to address was\nif the court were to depart, then it was -- it needed to\nexplain that departure in a greater reason to enable the\nsentencing commission to take that information into\naccount in revising the guidelines.\nThat is still a purpose with the sentencing\ncommission, to revise the guidelines, and they can still\nuse that information. But it -- at the very least, we\nneed information from the sentencing judge about each of\nthe matters that he or she --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You haven't answered my\nquestion. I mean, you explain why it's put in there,\nbut I want to know what is the difference between giving\nthe reasons and giving the specific reason.\nMR. COCHRAN: The specific reason I think,\nYour Honor, is so that the sentencing commission can\ntake that information into account in later revisions of\nthe guidelines. That was the purpose at the point that\nstatute was passed.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But are you saying now that\nthat distinction should be ignored?\nMR. COCHRAN: I don't know, Your Honor, if\nit's so much that it should be ignored inasmuch as the\ndistrict court needs to give as many reasons, or as\nclear a reason for the imposition of the particular\nsentence. That will help --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But it sounds to me as\nthough you want all the reasons to be specific. I mean,\nI understand your argument. But if we accept that\nargument, then the distinction between reason and\nspecific reason basically is going to be a matter of\nhistory, and perhaps it should be.\nMR. COCHRAN: It, it may, Your Honor. And,\nand because that provision predated this Court's Booker\ndecision, it still holds relevance but not nearly the\nrelevance it had when the guidelines were mandatory.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So your position would\nbe, Mr. Cochran, that the obligation to be even-handed\nwould have to -- that the trial judge would also have to\ngo through -- now this defendant maintained his\ninnocence. He didn't express any remorse. He accused a\nGovernment agent of perjury. All that, he would have to\ntake into account, just as specifically?\nMR. COCHRAN: Your Honor, I think that the\nCourt certainly could consider all of that; and -- and\nif pressed by the Government would need to consider\nthat. But certainly at a minimum, the Court needs to\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't that what the\nGovernment pressed at the sentencing hearing?\nMR. COCHRAN: It did, Your Honor, and again\nthe district court never came out with any specifics\nregarding any of those issues other than the conclusion\nthat it felt that the guideline range was not\ninappropriate.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the district court\nsays I give these following -- I've considered these\nfollowing specific factors. But in my view, the\nconsistency and nationwide uniformity that the\nguidelines strive to achieve is of great importance; and\nfor that reason, I'm following the guidelines?\nMR. COCHRAN: I don't --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is that an inappropriate\njudgment for the district court to make?\nMR. COCHRAN: I think it's inappropriate,\nYour Honor, because while there should be uniformity in\nan attempt to move in that direction, uniformity is not\nthe end all and be all. 3553(a) addresses\nindividualized sentencing of the defendant before the\ncourt.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's not the end all.\nSuppose the district judge said I think this is of great\nimportance. You don't think that the Booker opinion --\nor do you think the Booker opinion rejected uniformity\nand consistency as an important factor?\nMR. COCHRAN: I don't believe the Booker\ndecision rejected that, Your Honor. What I believe the\nBooker opinion said was that for there to be advisory\nguidelines, for there to be constitutional sentencing\npractices, then uniformity is going to have to give way\nto some extent. At least at the very beginning.\nOnce the district courts apply the 3553(a)\nfactors, and go through the statute, and consider the\nguidelines, the district courts will then explain their\nrationale; and then that rationale will be -- in our\nopinion, will show where the shortcomings of the\nguidelines are.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Cochran, are you arguing\nthe sentencing in this case violated the Sixth\nAmendment?\nMR. COCHRAN: Not as it was applied. It\ncame close in the sense that the district court was\nlaboring, in our opinion, under the belief that the\nguidelines held some control.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If it didn't violate the\nSixth Amendment, then your argument is based on the\nSentencing Reform Act?\nMR. COCHRAN: Well, it came -- it may have\nviolated the Sixth Amendment. I don't know that I would\nconcede that. But to avoid any constitutional issue, if\nwe analyzed this under the statute, clearly the district\ncourt didn't comply with the statute.\nJUSTICE ALITO: You can't say whether it did\nor did not violate the Sixth Amendment?\nMR. COCHRAN: The district court held the\nguidelines to a greater quantum than simply advisory.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, was your client's\nsentence enhanced by any fact that should have been\nsubmitted to the jury?\nMR. COCHRAN: Well, under -- under a pure\nadvisory system -- and I think Your Honor is addressing\nthe cross-reference in this matter -- in a purely\nadvisory system, the guidelines were calculated\ncorrectly in Mr. Rita's case, because under a purely\nadvisory system, the district court could look at that\ncross-reference, understand that it came about from\nuncharged and unproven conduct, and disregard it.\nBut by not doing so in this case, and that\ncross enhancement doubled his effective guideline range,\nthen this case may very well be unconstitutional because\nof the extra weight that the court gave the guidelines.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Mr. Cochran, you do\ncontend, do you not, that if the guidelines had been\nmandatory, there would have been a violation of the\nSixth Amendment.\nMR. COCHRAN: No question, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Because of the, the\naccessory after the fact point.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That's right, Your Honor,\nabsolutely.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then the question\nultimately is, does it violate the Sixth Amendment to\nsay that we have a presumption there, a sentence is in\nthe guidelines as a reasonable -- if you're an appellate\ncourt judge. And you think it does violate the Sixth\nAmendment?\nMR. COCHRAN: Our position is that the\npresumption does violate the Sixth --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then I guess the argument\nof the other side, which I would like you to address, is\nthat, in which there -- we didn't think it violated the\nof Sixth Amendment if the district judge simple applied\n3553 -- uh, 3553(a). And of course, 3553(a) includes\nall of these things that go into the guidelines; it make\na big point of that in 3553(a).\nSo why -- why couldn't you say, you know,\nall these factors are taken into account by the\ncommission? They start with an effort to a apply them\nin typical cases. This is their judgment in typical\ncases. So it is entitled to some kind of weight; and --\nat least in a typical case.\nMR. COCHRAN: Your Honor, the guidelines\nshould be consulted. No question --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no, not consulting\nthem. What I'm trying to do is to how much weight can a\njudge reading this give them without violating the Sixth\nAmendment? All I'm trying to do here is not whether the\nguidelines are good, bad, or indifferent. Congress\nwanted to apply them. We excised the mandatory to\ncomply with the Sixth Amendment. Now, what else do we\nhave to do to comply with the Sixth Amendment? Because\nI would think unless we have to do something else, we\nshouldn't do it, because Congress wanted it.\nMR. COCHRAN: I would contend, Your Honor,\nthat the Court needs to very clearly explain that the\nguidelines are, are a reference. They are --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The guidelines are what?\nMR. COCHRAN: Are a reference.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you say it is an\ninitial benchmark?\nMR. COCHRAN: I don't -- when we start\nestablishing benchmarks and presumptions, I think that's\nwhere we, we --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So benchmarks are bad.\nPresumption is bad. Great weight, that's bad?\nMR. COCHRAN: That's bad, too. And I think\nit's just another thing to consider.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does it matter what\njudge did in other cases? I mean, if we look on the day\nbefore he said, well, the guidelines say this, but I\nthink this case is different, so I'm going to depart,\nand the day after he says I know what the guidelines\nare, but I'm going to impose a higher sentence?\nI mean, how do we know he's -- when he says\nI looked at the guidelines and I think they're\nappropriate, that he's considering himself bound by\nsomething that he may or may not agree with, as opposed\nto what he said? Which is, well, I cannot find that\nthey're inappropriate?\nMR. COCHRAN: And what that tells me,\nMr. Chief Justice, is that, that the district court felt\nthat the guidelines had a center of gravity, that the\njudge was bound -- in other words, shifted the burden to\nthe defendant to say, well, I -- unless you can show\nthat these are inappropriate, that it is a setting of a\nbenchmark, it's a drawing of a line, and we contend that\nthat is what the Sixth Amendment prohibits.\nIf the guidelines are advisory, if they are\nbut one of many factors to be considered, together with\nall of the other factors in 3553(a), the court can use\nthat information, can use that reference. But once it\nstarts putting any greater weight on the guidelines --\nand the statute doesn't admit to that.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How about the point that\nJustice Breyer made that these other factors have been\ntaken into account by the sentencing commission because\nCongress told them to consider those same factors?\nMR. COCHRAN: Well, Your Honor, the\nsentencing commission by its own admission has not taken\ninto account all of the factors. In the very first\nguideline manual, 1987, the sentencing commission itself\nsaid it could not take into account all of the facts\nthat play into human conduct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: There are two separate\nthings there. The general aims of sentencing, the four\nbasic aims of sentencing, I believe the commission\ncertainly took into account. A separate thing was the\nrule that said you can depart only for a matter that has\nnot been fully considered by the guidelines.\nAnd there the original version, I believe,\nsaid that we've considered nothing thoroughly. Except\nfor certain specific matters that had been mentioned\nlike age, race, and we'll refer to statutorily. Now,\nthat is what you're thinking of? I mean, if that's what\nyou're thinking of, I don't think it's relevant to what\nyour present point is.\nMR. COCHRAN: I'm not, Your Honor. First of\nall, I don't know and would contend that the initial\nsentencing commission did not take into account all of\nthe four purposes of sentencing. They centered on crime\ncontrol --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's because when they\nlooked at all of the literature, they explained it, the\nrehabilitative purpose was not that it wasn't taken into\naccount, it was there was a consensus among experts that\nthere isn't much you can do about it. That's different\nfrom not taking into account.\nMR. COCHRAN: The other point I think with\nregard to that, Your Honor, is in looking at 3553(a)\nthat statute gives the district court the dual commands\nof first considering all of those factors and then\nimposing a sentence sufficient but not greater than\nnecessary. The statute does not give to the sentencing\ncommission that obligation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Cochran, I have this\nconcern: If we accept your submission that the district\ncourt should just consider the guidelines together with\neverything else, give them a presumption of validity,\nanything else, just something to consider, that would\npresumably eliminate any Sixth Amendment problem with\nthe district court's findings of fact.\nBut the district court's sentence is going\nto go on appeal. And the appellate court in reviewing\nit for reasonableness, let's assume in this case the\nappellate -- the appellate court says oh, no, this\nperson had -- we find as a matter of fact, given the\nrecord, military service, you know, which we think\nshould have been taken into account. And, therefore, we\nset it aside.\nNow, the next case that comes up, which\ndoesn't have the element of military service, in all\nother respects the same as your client's case, it comes\nup to the court of appeals, and the court of appeals\nwould say, ah, we don't have that different fact here\nand therefore we affirm the sentence.\nIsn't -- in other words isn't the finding of\na fact necessary for the process of judicial review,\neven if it is not made necessary for the purposes of the\ndistrict court's determination? He would not get that\nsentence but for this fact.\nMR. COCHRAN: That's correct, Your Honor.\nAnd --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you haven't shown us a\nway out of the problem.\nMR. COCHRAN: In a purely advisory system,\nthe district court is bound by the statutory minimum and\nmaximum. And as this Court has said in Cunningham, if\nthe Court is bound simply by that statutory minimum and\nmaximum, then the factual finding as to where within\nthat is up to the district court.\nIt's only when we establish thresholds as\nthe guidelines do we run into the constitutional\nproblem.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, even if you don't --\ndon't establish thresholds by reason of the guideline,\nyou are establishing thresholds upon judicial review,\nguidelines or not.\nIf the -- if the appellate court says, oh,\ngiven there's this fact in this case, the sentence below\nwas reasonable, but in the next case, where that fact\ndoes not exist, the court of appeals says, ah, the\nsentence is unreasonable, in other words, that fact is\nmade a necessary condition for giving the higher\nsentence.\nSo you haven't -- you haven't solved the\nproblem of the, of the apparent conflict between --\nbetween Booker and the advisory guidelines.\nMR. COCHRAN: Well, I think so long as the\ndistrict court can evaluate and consider and potentially\nreject what the guidelines say, just as the Court can\nconsider the effect of -- of the person's military\nrecord, Mr. Rita was a combat veteran in two wars, which\nis separate and apart from someone who may have been an\nArmy recruiter --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're not focusing on my\npoint. I concede that the district court is free as a\nbird -- free as a bird -- but you have appellate review.\nAnd the appellate court in reviewing for reasonableness\nis going to make a particular fact determinative of\nwhether this sentence can stand or not. Isn't that\nright?\nMR. COCHRAN: It is.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that's going to be a\nproblem.\nMR. COCHRAN: I think what the court would\nhave -- the appellate court would have to do is evaluate\nall of that through the prism of 3553(a). Is the\nsentence that was imposed the least sufficient sanction\nthat the court below could have imposed. And if not,\nfor whatever reasons, vacate it and return it back to\nthe district court.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, what if\nthere weren't guidelines at all, and the district court\nsaid maybe, you know, it's new, I want to see what other\njudges have done; he presses a button on the computer,\ngive me what the sentences were looking at these facts,\nand finds out in the last 100 cases, this is what the\nsentence was. And he says this seems to me no different\nthan those and that's the sentence I'm going to impose.\nIs there any problem with that?\nMR. COCHRAN: There is. And again, because\n3553(a) is an individual weighing of the defendant --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, well, he looks\nat all the individual factors and he says they seem not\nterribly different from these 100 other cases and the\nrange in those 100 other cases was, you know, 5 to 7\nyears, and so I'm going to give him 5 years.\nMR. COCHRAN: If the district court\nconsiders all those facts and considers what may have\nbeen done and it is sufficient, if not greater than\nnecessary given those facts, then the court can do that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How is that\ndifferent than the -- how is that different than looking\nat the guidelines, which did that in a much more\ncomprehensive way, and saying, I don't see anything\ndifferent in this case from the normal guidelines case\nand so I'm going to impose that sentence?\nMR. COCHRAN: Well, the guidelines didn't\ntake everything into account, and the sentencing courts\nwere coming from 18 years of mandatory guidelines, of\nbeing required to follow this book that necessarily\ndidn't incorporate all of the human factors in\nsentencing. And they have held to that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it did incorporate\nthem in that district judges were free to depart from\nthe guidelines if indeed they found there was some one\nof these human factors not considered by the guidelines\nwhich existed in the particular case.\nMR. COCHRAN: In theory, yes,\nJustice Scalia. But in practice, no, because what\nhappened in the very cases as United States versus Foy\nout of the Ninth Circuit, the defendant in that case\nargued to the district court that he should have a\ndeparture based upon lack of mutual guidance, and it was\na reasoned decision. It went to the Ninth Circuit. The\nNinth Circuit found it to be a reasoned decision; and\nwithin the next amendment process of the Sentencing\nCommission, it was eliminated as a departure basis with\nno discussion at all.\nSo yes, there may have been departures, but\nthey were systematically removed, and in fact chapters\n5(h) and 5(a) show that very clearly.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, if they were\nsystematically removed then all of these other human\nfactors that you're complaining about were considered by\nthe guideline commission and were simply rejected.\nMR. COCHRAN: They weren't considered, Your\nHonor, and in the history of those amendments that's\nborne out.\nAnd if the Court has no further questions,\nI'd like to reserve some time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Dreeben.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. DREEBEN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThe court of appeals appropriately applied a\npresumption of reasonableness in reviewing the sentence\nimposed pursuant to the advisory guidelines system that\nthis Court announced in United States versus Booker.\nThe guidelines represent the integration of the multiple\npurposes of sentencing reflected in section 3553(a) that\nthe district court is obligated to consider. The\ncommission also represents an expert body that has\nconsidered the various parameters of sentencing and the\nfact patterns that arise in the Federal system and has\nmade an effort over time to arrive at an appropriate --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't it true, just to get\none thought out on the table, that there are factors\nthat the guidelines don't -- did not consider, such as\nmilitary service?\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Stevens, the\ncommission considered that factor and then determined\nthat it was not generally appropriate to a sentence\noutside the guidelines.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But isn't it true that\nunder the guideline no weight is given to military\nservice?\nMR. DREEBEN: The guidelines specifically do\nnot give weight to it. They permit a judge --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What should a judge do if\nhe thought some weight should be given to military\nservice?\nMR. DREEBEN: Under Booker the judge should\ndo that. That is the difference between an advisory\nguidelines system and a mandatory guidelines system.\nThe judge can give weight to factors That the commission\ndecided should not have weight in the sentencing\nprocess. That is the essence of what it means for the\nguidelines --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And presumably cannot give\nweight to factors that the commission decided should\nhave weight.\nMR. DREEBEN: He can do that, too,\nJustice Scalia.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Are we back to the original\nversion, which I'll read what it says. It says: \"With\na few specific exceptions -- race, sex, national origin,\ncreed, religion, socioeconomic State -- with those\nexceptions, the commission does not intend to limit the\nkinds of factors, whether or not mentioned anywhere else\nin the guidelines, that could constitute grounds for\ndeparture in an unusual case.\" That's what it said. A\npart of the guidelines in the heartland. If it's not\nthe heartland, depart.\nNow, what I wonder is are we not back under\nyour theory of it just to where we were when it started\nout, before the commission started ruling all these\nthings out and began to make all its -- the judge could\ndo that.\nMR. DREEBEN: I think we're back,\nJustice Breyer, to a further point even than the first\nset of guidelines, because even under the first set of\nguidelines application of the guidelines was mandatory\nunless the court found an aggravating or mitigating\ncircumstance that wasn't taken into account.\nJUSTICE BREYER: We said we took nothing\ninto account and therefore any circumstance that makes\nthe case unusual would be in principle a ground for an\nexception.\nMR. DREEBEN: I understand that,\nJustice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You're saying more than\nthat is necessary.\nMR. DREEBEN: I think that the\nreconciliation of this Court's merits opinion in Booker\nand its remedial opinion in Booker does dictate that the\njudge has additional freedom to impose a sentence that's\ndifferent from what's described in the guidelines.\nJUSTICE BREYER: He could do this: He could\nset aside the guideline on the theory that the guideline\nitself is unreasonable, that is it doesn't properly take\naccount of sentencing. But suppose he doesn't do that.\nThen, if you take your view that there's a presumption\nin its favor and if it is the normal case, not an\nunusual case in any respect, how can he not apply the\nguideline?\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Breyer, I think we\nhave to distinguish between what the job of the district\ncourt is and what the job of the appellate court is; and\nin this case, the Government is arguing for a\npresumption of reasonableness on appeal. Once the\ndistrict judge has determined that the guidelines\nsentence aligns with his own application of the section\n3553(a) factors, our submission here is that a court of\nappeals can generally presume that that is a reasonable\nsentence. The defendant of course has the opportunity,\nor the Government if the Government has appealed, to\nshow that that presumption is overcome.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But unless there is a way\nto calibrate the strength of the presumption, there's no\nclear way to distinguish the presumption from the\nmandate. The mandate is gone. You say yes, they\nconsider other things. But unless we can calibrate the\npresumption in some way that says, you know, a mandate\nwas force 60 and a presumption is a force 40, something\nlike that, there's no way to tell the two apart in\npractice.\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Souter, I'm not sure\nthat that would be true even if what we were talking\nabout was a direction to the district judge to presume\nthat he would impose a guidelines sentence. But that's\nnot what we're talking about. The district judge does\nnot operate and does not have to operate under the\nposition that we're arguing for with a presumption that\nthe judge will impose a guidelines sentence unless\npersuaded otherwise. The judge's obligation is to --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He doesn't have to do it\nunless he wants to be sure of being affirmed.\nMR. DREEBEN: I would think that what the\njudge wants to do is be sure that he's complied with his\nstatutory obligations.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, perhaps I\nmisunderstood Justice Souter's question, but I have this\nconcern, and I thought it was his concern as well. At\nthe appellate level, is the presumption something that\ncan only be overcome by a clear and convincing showing\nor is it just an initial benchmark? We're playing with\nstandards and words here.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, we are.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And when we talk about\npresumptions at the appellate level, that's actually a\nlittle strange in any event. You usually talk about\npresumptions as assisting us in finding a fact.\nMR. DREEBEN: That's true, Justice Kennedy.\nBut I think what it reflects at the appellate level is\nthat the court of appeals enters the case with an\nattitude that, our job is to decide whether what the\ndistrict judge did was reasonable. We can operate --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So we write that this is\nan additive thing?\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes, I think that it's not so\ndifferent from the court of appeals saying we can enter\nthis case feeling pretty confident that we can affirm a\nguidelines sentence unless the person who challenges\nthat shows us a good reason otherwise.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, is your view -- on\nyour view, is the appellate court engaging in some kind\nof de novo review or is the appellate court supposed to\nengage in a review that it will disturb the sentence\nonly if it is shown to be unreasonable?\nMR. DREEBEN: The latter, Justice Souter.\nAnd I think that in that regard there is a range of\nreasonable sentences that could be imposed based on a\ngiven set of facts.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if you -- if\nyou have that, two criminals, criminal defendants, with\nthe same identical background and everything else, one\njudge says, I think military service should be taken\ninto account, so I'm going to depart from the guidelines\nby 3 years. The judge next door says, I don't think it\nshould be taken into account so I'm going to impose the\nguideline sentence. Both cases are appealed. They're\nconsolidated for argument. What is the court of appeals\nsupposed to do? Uphold both of them?\nMR. DREEBEN: The court of appeals can\nuphold both of them if it concludes that the actual\nsentence that's imposed is reasonable. And in the\nsecond case that the Court is going to hear today the\nGovernment argues for a proportionality principle that\nshould govern the review of sentencing.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What is reasonable is -- is\nnot merely a sort of number within a spectrum. It seems\nto me that what is reasonable is a function in part of\nthe reasons that are given. And in the Chief Justice's\nview, two diametrically opposed reasons are given for\ntwo different sentences. Does the, does the appellate\ncourt in his example say, well, I think reasonable\npeople could go either way on that, so however it comes\nout it's fine on appellate review? Isn't that what the\ncourt would have to do in order to affirm both\nsentences, other things being equal?\nMR. DWYER: You're right, Justice Souter,\nand I can't say that that would be the first choice of\nthe Congress that enacted the Sentencing Reform Act.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't it clear that it\nwould have been the last choice of the Congress?\nMR. DREEBEN: It is, and it's not the first\nchoice of the Government, either. But it strikes me\nthat it is something of an inevitability once this Court\nhas declared that mandatory guidelines are impermissible\nunder the Constitution if judicial factfinding --\nJUSTICE ALITO: What does the Sixth\nAmendment have to do with the selection of the\nsentencing philosophy that is to be imposed? How can\nthere be a Sixth Amendment violation if either the\nguidelines or our case law says military service is or\nis not a relevant factor? I don't see how that has\nanything to do with anything that you can get out of the\nSixth Amendment.\nMR. DREEBEN: It probably does not,\nJustice Alito. But what happened in the first part of\nBooker is that the Court declared that the guidelines\nare advisory and advice. It's advice that can be\naccepted or rejected.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I know, but Booker says\nwhat we're trying to do is to come close to what\nCongress wanted but not violate the Sixth Amendment.\nNow, what I think we're talking about now --\nI think -- i mean, you sort of shed some -- you\nclarified something very well for me, which is that in\nthis case we're talking about the situation where the\ndistrict judge applies the guidelines sentence, and then\nwhat's the attitude of the court on appeal, and the\nattitude is going to be, well, the Sentencing Commission\nthinks it's okay, the judge thinks it's okay, okay, you\nhave to -- you better show me a good reason to think to\nthe contrary. Fine.\nBut the interesting problem is the problem\nof the next case which you're now talking about, is,\nwell, what happens if the district judge and when should\nbe the district judge and how free should the district\njudge feel he is to depart from the guidelines sentence\neven if it's not an unusual case.\nMR. DREEBEN: Let me try to address that and\ntry to address Justice Alito's point about the question\nof how much sentencing philosophy can be decreed by the\nsentencing commission or Congress before a Sixth\nAmendment problem arises.\nAs I understand this Court's sequence of\nopinions from Apprendi leading up to the most recent\ndecision in Cunningham, if the law establishes a level\nof punishment that may be imposed based on the facts\nfound by the jury and says to the judge, judge, you may\nnot go above it unless you find a particular fact, that\nfact is subject to the Sixth Amendment rule that the\nCourt has announced and must be found by a jury.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Or some fact, not\nnecessarily a particular fact.\nMR. DREEBEN: Any fact at all, as a matter\nof fact is what the Court has said, although I\nunderstand that to mean facts pertaining to the offense\nand the offender, not facts about the world such as the\nprevalence of crime.\nNow, what that leads me to conclude is that\nin order to escape the bright line rule that's been\nannounced in this sequence of cases, including Booker\nitself and most recently Cunningham, a judge must be\nable to look at the set of facts that the jury found,\ndetermine what level of punishment would be advised by,\nsay, a guidelines system, and not be bound to impose\nthat level of punishment if the judge feels that a\ndifferent level of punishment is appropriate.\nIf that is a correct understanding of what\nthis Court has held, it necessarily implies that a judge\ndoes have a certain amount of freedom in an advisory\nguidelines system to disagree with what the Sentencing\nCommission has found, give the judge's reasons, and then\nis subject to appellate review for the reasonableness of\nthat explanation and, the Government submits, subject to\na proportionality principle, so that the sentence that's\nimposed outside the guidelines is a reasonable one and\nnot an arbitrary one.\nNow, if I'm wrong about that and it is not\nnecessary for the court to have the legal freedom to be\nable to disagree with what the Sentencing Commission\nsaid, that would be very good from the Government's\nperspective. But as I understand the complementary\nrules that are established by Booker, what an advisory\nguidelines system requires is that the guidelines be\ntreated as advice rather than mandate. So while the\nguidelines have determined that military service is not\nordinarily relevant to the level of punishment, a judge\nmay determine in a particular case that he disagrees.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you, this is the\nhypothetical: Supposing a judge thinks military service\nis relevant, and he decides to impose a sentence a\nlittle below the guidelines. But then he says, I\nrecognize that in this circuit there is a strong\ninterest in uniformity and the court of appeals has\nadopted a rule where they will presume a within\nguidelines sentence is reasonable and will affirm in\nthose cases. And I think with respect to the court of\nappeals, I think I would be wise to impose the\nguidelines sentence, so I will do so even though my own\njudgment is that it should be slightly lower. What\nshould the court of appeals do with such a sentence?\nMR. DREEBEN: I think the court of appeals\nshould correct the judge on a mistaken apprehension of\nlaw, which is that the judge --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Should reverse the judge\nthen, within a -- a within guidelines sentence?\nMR. DREEBEN: In the circumstance,\nJustice Stevens, I think that you put your finger on two\ndifferent types of review. In the circumstance in which\na district judge operates with what I'll call legal\nblinders on that prevent him from complying with --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No. He operates with\ntotal candor. He's saying exactly what he feels like\nsaying.\nMR. DREEBEN: I'm hoping that it's a\nmisunderstanding of what the court of appeals has said,\nbecause the court of appeals should not have told the\njudge you're obligated to impose a guideline sentence.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, they didn't say\nyou're obligated, but you can be pretty sure you'll be\naffirmed if you do impose within guidelines sentences.\nMR. DREEBEN: Judges are still obligated to\ncomply with 3553(a), which requires them to exercise\ndiscretion. Now if a judge decides I might as a\npersonal matter if I were writing the guidelines write\nthem differently, and I might give great weight to\nmilitary service, but one of the things that I'm\nrequired to do under section 3553(a) is to consider the\nneed to avoid unwarranted disparity between defendants\nwho have been convicted of similar criminal conduct and\nhave similar records. And therefore, I am going to\nmoderate my own personal preference and not impose a\nsignificant outside the range sentence, in order to\nensure that I fully have taken into account the fact\nthat we are in a Federal system with 674 Federal\ndistrict judges, and we cannot have all our own personal\nguidelines systems.\nNow if a judge does that, I don't think\nthere's anything wrong with that. I think that judge\nhas actually complied with --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if the court of\nappeals does that? What if the court of appeals says\nwe've got 10 district judges in this circuit, nine of\nthem do not take military service into account, one\ndoes, and we think that's inequitable, doesn't serve the\ninterest in uniformity. And so even though that one\njudge says in the exercise of my discretion I'm going to\ndepart, we're going to reverse that as unreasonable?\nMR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, I think\nthere's a difference between a sentence that varies from\nwhat other judges would do and a sentence that is\nunreasonable.\nIf the sentence that is different from what\nother judges would do is not supported by a cogent and\ncoherent explanation, and it is unduly productive of\ndisparity because, say, it takes a guidelines range like\nthis one, of 33 months to 41 months, and the judge says\nin my view military service means that this defendant\ngets probation.\nOr to take an example that's on the other\nside, suppose that the judge says this defendant\nactually didn't get any extra credit in his criminal\nhistory for his prior crime, but he has been convicted\nbefore of lying to the Government about his gun charges.\nI'm now going to take him up to the statutory maximum or\nnear it and give him eight years. I think in those\ncircumstances a court of appeals can and should say,\nhold on, this is a view that the district judge is\nentitled to take on the merits. He's entitled to give\ngreater weight to that factor, whether it's aggravating\nor mitigating, than what the guidelines did, but not to\nthis extent, or we're going to be left with a system in\nwhich disuniformity is the main principle.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's not that complicated.\nAll that happens is the court of appeals says, look, in\nthe case of bank robberies we've discovered about 33\npercent of the defendants in the typical case have been\nin the Army. And therefore, we think that just ordinary\narmed services is not a reason, ordinary armed --\nservices in the military is not a reason for a\ndiminished sentence. That's all, period. Or they can\nsay it the other way, the absence of a military service\nis a reason for having the higher sentence, put it any\nway you want. And by the way, district judge, if you\ndisagree with that, we're going to reverse you because\nwe think it's unreasonable. Okay. What about that?\nMR. DREEBEN: That to me sounds identical to\nthe system that pre-existed Booker's holding.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It did. But is there\nanything in the Sixth Amendment that forbids that?\nMR. DREEBEN: This Court hasn't specifically\naddressed --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, what do you think?\nBecause I would think that if you're going to answer\nthat question yes, you are saying that not even the\ncourt of appeals can try to assure a degree of fairness\namong different defendants in respect to sentencing.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Breyer, I would\nlike to be able to answer the question yes and say that\ncourts of appeals can establish their own sub-legal\nrules as --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's not sub-legal rules.\nWhat it's called is precedent. What you do is you\ndecide a case and you decide this is unfair, and then\nthe thing that as a similar case comes along, is you\ndecide it the same way. And if a district judge doesn't\nfollow that, you reverse it.\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Breyer, if do you\nthat, what you have is each court of appeals functioning\nas a sentencing commission.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Exactly. You've simply\nsubstituted stare decisis and the necessity of the\ndistrict court following circuit law for the guidelines.\nAnd --\nMR. DREEBEN: Exactly.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If the guidelines are\nunconstitutional because they make facts automatically\ndeterminative, I assume that would be unconstitutional\nbecause it makes facts automatically determinative.\nMR. DREEBEN: I assume too under the\nrationale --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well then, in other words,\nthe Constitution of the United States prevents the\ncourts themselves from trying to assure that sentences\nwho are -- that individuals who are in similar\npositions, commit similar crimes, will be treated in\nsimilar ways. That to me is possible, but of course\nI've been in dissent in these cases. But it seems to\nme --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So long as the jury\ndetermines the facts that make them similar.\nJUSTICE BREYER: We're back --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The problem here is what\nmakes them similar.\nMR. DREEBEN: I understand this dialogue.\nAnd what we have --\n(Laughter.)\nI too have been with the dissenters in these\ncases, and what I'm trying to argue for here is a set of\nprinciples that appellate courts can apply and that\ndistrict courts can look to when sentencing, that will\ncome as close as is reasonably possible to achieving\nCongress's aims in the Sentencing Reform Act without\ncrossing over the bright line rule that this Court has\nannounced --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't know how\nterribly different it is than the normal review for\nabuse of discretion. I mean, you don't even need two\njudges in my earlier question. Let's say you have the\nsame judge, and for three weeks every criminal defendant\nwho comes before him he says, I think if you have\nmilitary service, you should get a reduction. And then\nall of a sudden he says, I see you have military\nservice, but I'm not going to give you a reduction. I\nmean, is he bound by some abuse of discretion standard\nto be a little bit consistent? And if that's the only\ntype of appellate review we're talking about, to ensure\nsome degree of consistency in how similar individuals\nare treated in similar cases, I don't see that it raises\nany concern.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I'm\nnot arguing for any proposition that I think would raise\nconcern. I do think that a general tenet of abuse of\ndiscretion review is that the court of appeals can\naffirm a result that it would not necessarily have\nreached itself.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Dreeben, may I ask\nyou, please, to address a point that Mr. Cochran raised?\nI think you were very helpful in saying this presumption\nfor the guidelines is how the court of appeals evaluates\na district court sentence, that there is no presumption\nthat binds the district judge.\nBut one of the main points that Mr. Cochran\nmade in his presentation was the district judge has to\ngive reasons. He -- this was just a summary paragraph\nat the end of the sentence hearing. He has to respond\nto what defendant presented. He has to respond to what\nthe Government presented. There is an obligation\nstemming from subpart (c) to give reasons, and that's\nwhat he saw as the principal flaw in this sentence, that\nthe court of appeals has used. Reasons weren't given\nfor it.\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Ginsburg, I don't\nthink there was anything problematic with what this\ndistrict judge did. As Your Honor noted, this was a\nsentence that was imposed after a lengthy sentencing\nhearing in which the court engaged in a dialogue with\ndefense counsel about the three bases and the exclusive\nbases on which defense counsel asked for a downward\ndeparture. The judge at least four times in this\ntranscript brought up Section 3553, recognizing that the\njudge was well aware of his obligation to imply the\npurposes of sentencing and the factors that were\npresented to him. Now he did that and he made comments\nalong the way that indicate why he did not find physical\ncondition, military service, or asserted vulnerability\nin prison to be reasons that would justify giving this\ndefendant a lower sentence.\nAnd in his ultimate explanation, though it\nis brief, he pointed to two of the Section 3553 factors\nexplicitly. He pointed to the seriousness of the\noffense and he pointed to the need for public\nprotection.\nNow if you look at the legal obligations\nthat the judge had under Section 3553(c) to explain\nhimself, the statute actually sets up a hierarchy of\nthree different levels of explanation. First, in any\ncase the judge is to state the reasons for the sentence.\nSecond, if the sentencing range is greater than 24\nmonths, the judge is supposed to explain the particular\nreason for giving a sentence at one end or another end\nof the range. And finally, if the sentence is outside\nthe range, the judge is to give the specific reason for\na sentence outside the range. That statutory framework\nmakes it entirely plausible to say that if a judge\nimposes a guideline sentence and explains, I see no\nreason not to impose a guideline sentence, he has met\nhis burden of explanation without having to respond\nliterally and in sequence to each argument that the\ndefendant has made.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question?\nThe district judge is reviewed under an abuse of\ndiscretion standard, which I take it means there's a\npresumption he got it right. Is that correct? There's\na presumption the district judge sentence is correct?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Stevens, our\nposition is more complicated than that, because within a\nguidelines range if a sentence is imposed, the\nGovernment --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Why shouldn't there be\nalso the same presumption when it is outside the\nguidelines range?\nMR. DREEBEN: Because sentences that are\noutside the guidelines range are more likely to be the\ncause of or a source of unwarranted disparity than a\nsentence within the range. And that is why that if the\ncourt of appeals is interested in fulfilling what Booker\nsaid the role of the court of appeals is, which is to\niron out sentencing differences, there is more\nreason for the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, do you think the\ninterest in uniformity, in same sentences across the\nboard is stronger than the interest in getting the\ncorrect sentence for the particular defendant who's in\ncourt at the time?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, there isn't any one\ncorrect sentence usually.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, there isn't. But if\nyou say the district judge has broad discretion, which\nhe does, and the review is under abuse of discretion,\nwhy should there not always be a presumption that the\ndistrict judge got it right?\nMR. DREEBEN: Because there are more legal\nelements that go into sentencing and sentencing review\nthan just those that you've named, Justice Stevens.\nSection 3553(a) itself, which is the guidepost for\nreview, mandates that the district court consider the\nguidelines, consider the policy --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but it's sort of like\nfindings of fact. They must take into consideration all\nsorts of aspects of the case, and you have a strong\npresumption that the findings of fact are accurate. Why\ndon't you have a strong presumption that the ultimate\njudgment on the sentence is also accurate?\nMR. DREEBEN: What happens when a sentence\nis imposed outside the range is that there is a greater\nrisk of infringing the main purpose of the Sentencing\nReform Act, which was to avoid unwarranted disparities;\nand in contrast to a sentence within the range which\ndoes not merely run that risk to the same degree, a\nsentence outside the range may well. It's different\nfrom what the sentencing commission with its expertise\nand its experience has recommended as the appropriate\nsentence, given those facts.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you're -- I mean,\nthis is a self fulfilling prophecy. You're saying if\nyou don't comply with the guidelines, you're not going\nto have uniformity. Well, I -- my goodness. Is that\nconsistent with the notion that the guidelines are\nadvisory?\nMR. DREEBEN: I wouldn't put it as strongly\nas that, Justice Scalia. What I would say is that the\nfurther that a sentence diverges from the guidelines\nrange, the greater the possibility of unwarranted\ndisparity; and as a result of that, a court of appeals\nshould look more critically at the reasons that the\ndistrict court gave and ensure that the constellation of\nreasons and facts that's presented is not so likely to\nbe a disproportionate sentence than --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that's just\ninconsistent with the notion which I think is correct,\nthat the district judge can simply disagree with the\nbasic -- basic reasons of the commission, can simply\ndisagree with the fact that the commission considers\nwhite collar crime, for example, something that should\njustify incarceration.\nMR. DREEBEN: But Justice Scalia,\nreasonableness review connotes that the court of appeals\nwill review the reasons that the district court gave for\nthat disagreement.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So doesn't your presumption\nargument come down to an argument for a sufficiently\ncomprehensive statement of reasons, with a more\nextensive statement required the further the court gets\nfrom the guidelines? Isn't that what it boils down to?\nMR. DREEBEN: It does for an out of range\nsentence, Justice Souter. I think that for a sentence\nwithin the range, the judge's statement that I have\nconsidered the guidelines range and I think it's\nappropriate does explain why that judge has given the\nsentence that he's given. It's consistent with the\nstatute and it's consistent with the Constitution. Now\nwhen --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is there -- may I interrupt\nyou? Because your time is getting short.\nIs there a difference between a presumption\nof reasonableness to the guidelines on the one hand and\na rule that says the further you get from them, you can\nget as far as you want to, but the further you get from\nthem, the more extensive your explanation has to be?\nIs there a distinction between those two,\ntwo rules?\nMR. DREEBEN: There is a distinction between\nthem but I think they are complementary rules and in the\nnext case the Government will argue for a presumption\nthat is precisely what you have articulated,\nJustice Souter. A greater and more extensive and more\npersuasive explanation is needed the further that you go\nfrom the guidelines range.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Or presumably the\nfurther the facts suggest that you ought to depart from\nthe guidelines range? If you've got a submission here\n18 compelling reasons, you shouldn't follow the\nguidelines, and you get one sentence from the district\ncourt saying -- you know -- I followed the guidelines,\npresumably that would be the same as a significant\ndeparture without further justification?\nMR. DREEBEN: It wouldn't be identical but I\nagree with you, Mr. Chief Justice, that a sentence\nwithin the guidelines can be unreasonable if there is a\ncompelling case for a sentence outside the range because\nthe guidelines simply don't fit in that circumstance.\nThe sentencing commission itself recognized\nthat the guidelines were generalizations; they carved\nout a heartland in the language of the sentencing\ncommission's first set of guidelines, and that there\nwill be circumstances that would justify different\nsentences.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is the system that you're\ndescribing any different for mandatory guidelines that\nare subject to departure when the district judge finds a\nsignificant reason, which was what mandatory guidelines\nhad?\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes, Justice Scalia. It is\nquite --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wherein is it different?\nMR. DREEBEN: It is different precisely on\nthe area that, that you yourself articulated. The judge\ncan disagree with the sentencing guidelines and\ndetermine that on the basis of the facts that the jury\nfound, the judge would impose a different sentence, and\nthat conclusion is then subject for reasonableness\nreview and we submit based on a proportionality\nprinciple.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Dreeben.\nMr. Cochran, you have three minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS N. COCHRAN\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. COCHRAN: That you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nI would like to return first to the across\nthe board reasonableness review that this Court\nestablished in Booker. That in and of itself shows why\nthere cannot be a presumption of reasonableness on\nappeal. Because you are holding the presumption to a\ndifferent standard at that point. It is not a\nreasonableness across the board. You are putting the\nburden on one the parties, most likely the defendant, to\ncome forward and explain why the presumption should be\nrebutted.\nThat flies in the face with the across the\nboard reasonableness this Court set forth in Booker.\nThe guidelines are fraught with disparity.\nThat why is they are advisory. That's why they can only\nbe advisory. And the district courts must be allowed to\nlook at them, to see them, to consider them, but\nultimately to impose a sentence outside them for valid\nreasons.\nIn Mr. Rita's case, the court didn't. The\ncourt felt the guidelines held some undue weight. It is\nindicated in the record in two places, first and\nforemost on page 49 of the joint appendix, where the\ncourt at the beginning of the sentencing hearing states:\nOther than the motion for downward departure that you\nsubmitted, do you have any other objections; and what\nI'm trying to do now is determine where your client fits\nwithin the sentencing guidelines.\nClearly the judge was rooted in the\nguidelines and that's why he gave a sentence of 33\nmonths at the low end.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The, the judge also\npointed out that the jury made certain findings and he\nthought he was bound by them; that is, the defendant\nprotested his independence, and the jury had found him\nguilty of false statements.\nMR. COCHRAN: That's correct. That's --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The judge was bound by\nthose.\nMR. COCHRAN: That's correct, Your Honor,\nbut interestingly the court found very dubious the\nadditional information regarding the cross-reference.\nAnd on page 87 of the joint appendix, the court states\nit was not able to evaluate the seriousness of that\nother investigation; and yet that was the\ncross-reference that doubled his guidelines sentence.\nWe would ask the Court to rule in this case\nthat the presumption of reasonableness cannot be\naccorded to the guidelines.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Cochran, you've\nstarted out by saying there were two places in the\nrecord that you thought showed the judge was bound by\nthe guidelines. 49, what was the other one?\nMR. COCHRAN: Your Honor, the other one was\npage 87.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of the one -- oh,\nthat point? Okay.\nMR. COCHRAN: And that would be in the\nsecond paragraph, Mr. Chief Justice, where the court\nfound it was unable to stray or found the guidelines\nwere inappropriate; and I suggest that that is a, a\ngiving of greater weight and too much so in this case.\nYour Honor, Mr. Rita asks the Court to find\nthat a presumption cannot be accorded to the guidelines,\nthat his sentence was unreasonable in this case, and\nthat his case be returned for resentencing. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n"
