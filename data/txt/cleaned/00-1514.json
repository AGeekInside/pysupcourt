BOLTER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BOLTER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nSection 1367 is a constitutional and sensible\nresponse by Congress to the serious procedural problems\nthat were facing the Federal courts prior to 1990. Those\nprocedural problems arose due to State claims that were\npending in the Federal courts at that time under this\nCourt's, what was then called, pendent jurisdiction and is\nnow called supplemental jurisdiction. The problem\nspecifically was what happens to those State claims that\nare pending in Federal court when the expiration of the\nstatute of limitations on those claims occurs.\nThe courts were faced with a dilemma at that\npoint, do they dismiss these claims and risk having them\nnot be refiled in the State court or do they retain those\n-- the supplemental jurisdiction over those claims and\ndecide issues that might be better suited for the State\ncourts when they don't -- when the Federal court no longer\nwants to exercise that jurisdiction.\nQUESTION: What -- what's wrong with, as some\ncourts did, conditioning dismissal upon -- upon the\nplaintiff's -- upon the defendant's agreement to -- to\nwaive the statute?\nMR. BOLTER: The problem with that solution,\nJustice Scalia, is that there is no guarantee that there\nwould be an agreement to waiver. The defendant is -- it's\nup to the defendant to agree to that waiver and to say\nthat they will -- they will not bring up that statute of\nlimitations defense in State court.\nQUESTION: Right, and if he doesn't waive, then\n-- then you proceed in Federal court because it's just not\n-- not a proper -- proper basis for dismissing it. What's\n-- what's the matter with that solution?\nMR. BOLTER: In that -- in that situation, it\nmight work. There might be supplemental jurisdiction and\nthe plaintiffs will not lose their claims.\nHowever, that is just one court's potential\nsolution. There were a number of solutions that were\nbeing attempted at the time with varying effectiveness.\nIt didn't guarantee, across the board, that plaintiffs\nwould be able to bring those State claims in Federal court\nand be assured that they would be -- that they wouldn't be\nforfeited if the statute of limitations ran out.\nOne -- one possible solution to the problem\ndoesn't make 1367 unconstitutional. 1367 was a -- was a\ngeneral response to a general problem that was occurring\nbelow.\nQUESTION: How about the Solicitor General's\nsuggestion that we construe the statute so as not to apply\nto nonconsenting -- actions against nonconsenting States?\nMR. BOLTER: To do that, the Court needs to\naddress the threshold question of whether the statute\nabrogates in -- in the first place, whether tolling is an\nabrogation of the State's immunity, and we contend that it\nis not.\nQUESTION: Well, but the Solicitor General says,\nas I understand his brief, that we would avoid that\nconstitutional question if we construed the statute in the\nmanner that he asked us to construe it.\nMR. BOLTER: If the -- if that scenario was\ntaken and -- and the construction is -- is construed not\nto apply to the States, there will be serious\nconstitutional problems that will be created by that\nconstruction, particularly depriving the -- the Federal\nlitigants of their access to the Federal forum.\nQUESTION: Well, what constitutional provision\ndo you say would be violated if we followed that\nsuggestion?\nMR. BOLTER: The right -- the due process rights\nof a plaintiff to have their cause of action heard in a --\nin a certain forum, to make sure that they would have\nthose claims heard.\nQUESTION: What case supports your position\nthere? What case from this Court?\nMR. BOLTER: I don't know if there's a case\nthat's -- oh, I'm sorry. I take that -- that's the Logan\ncase that -- that shows that a -- that a plaintiff has a\nright to have their -- their cause of action heard.\nQUESTION: But not to have a cause of action\nheard in Federal court against a State.\nMR. BOLTER: That -- that's correct, not to have\n-- not to have it heard in -- in the Federal court against\nthe State, but to have it heard in some forum. The way --\nQUESTION: But suppose the State decided it\nwasn't going to waive its immunity. As I understand it,\nin Minnesota, you could bring this claim within 45 days.\nThe State has waived its immunity for suit in its own\ncourt.\nMR. BOLTER: That's -- that's right.\nQUESTION: So -- but it -- you're not suggesting\nthat it had to do that, otherwise there would be a due\nprocess violation. If that were so, then the State\ndoesn't have any immunity because due process would compel\nit to -- to answer.\nMR. BOLTER: What we are saying is that the due\nprocess violation would be if you construe the statute not\nto apply to the States, you don't have the protection of\ntolling a State claim against a State in Federal court.\nAnd if a State asserts its constitutional defense of\nsovereign immunity, that claim could be barred, but be --\nin --\nQUESTION: But it wouldn't have been if you had\nfiled a protective action. Suppose you had -- with this\nuncertain question of Eleventh Amendment immunity from\nsuit in Federal court, you could have, on the same day you\nfiled in Federal court and took a chance on that, filed a\nprotective action in Minnesota State court.\nMR. BOLTER: We -- we could have filed a\nprotective action, but the -- that has -- I think there\nare two parts to that -- that answer.\nFirst, we could have filed a protective action,\nbut there's no guarantees that the State would have stayed\nthat action. It might have -- it might have forced\nlitigation on that matter, creating res judicata and\nclaims preclusion issues in the Federal court. It might\nhave sought to dismiss it because of claims splitting.\nAnd the next part of the question is that the --\nthe Supreme Court of Minnesota said that this was a\nfacially unconstitutional -- section 1367 --\nQUESTION: But wouldn't it -- it wouldn't have\noccasion to say that -- as I understand it, when\nduplicative actions are brought, the second court, the one\nwhere you file second, generally although it's not\ncompelled to do this, will say, okay, prior action\npending. We'll stay this case till the other one is\nfinished.\nMR. BOLTER: They -- they could do that, but the\npoint is that it wasn't -- there was no guarantee that\nthey will. They might also choose not to stay it and not\nto clog up their dockets and have -- have cases affecting\ntheir statistics.\nQUESTION: You have -- you're using a lot of\nmights. Do you have any -- do we know how Minnesota State\ncourts treat the prior action pending plea? Do they\ndismiss or do they keep it?\nMR. BOLTER: They -- if the claim is filed in\nMinnesota on -- they will not dismiss if it was clear that\nthe Federal court would not have exercised jurisdiction\nover that Federal -- over that State claim.\nAnd in Minnesota, it was not clear at that time,\nand it's still not clear because the -- the university and\nthe States have this constitutional defense which they can\nassert or not assert. It's at their discretion. In fact,\nsome of the cases that we've cited show that Minnesota,\nthe university, has litigated cases, on the merits in\nFederal court, State and Federal claims.\nSo, the point there is that we didn't know that\nthe court would not exercise jurisdiction over the State\nclaims, and if we were to file with that knowledge in --\nin State court, they could have dismissed on claims\nsplitting or claim preclusion ground -- or claims\nsplitting grounds because the Federal court might have\nexercised jurisdiction. It was not clear.\nQUESTION: It seems to me the principle you're\narguing for -- I'm just not sure what its -- what its\nboundaries are. The principle, as I take it, is when --\nwhen the Federal Government creates a Federal cause of\naction, any State law that impedes -- and -- and allows\nthat Federal action to be brought in Federal court, any\nState law that impedes the bringing of that action in\nFederal court can be repealed by the Federal Government.\nHow does that apply, for example, to simple\nstatutes of limitations? Let's -- let's assume you -- you\nhave a Federal statute of -- of a year for certain -- for\na certain transaction or occurrence. The State statute\nfor the same transaction or occurrence and the State's\ncause of action is just 6 months. Now, would you argue\nthat because of the difficulty of claims splitting and so\nforth, the Federal Government can prescribe by statute\nthat the State cause of action shall be extended to 12\nmonths?\nMR. BOLTER: No, that's not what we are saying.\nQUESTION: Well, why not? If you say no, then\nyou acknowledge the principle that, you know, there are\nsome problems that have no solution, and -- and the mere\nfact that you're making the Federal cause of action more\ndifficult has nothing to do with whether there's Federal\npower to -- to solve that particular problem.\nMR. BOLTER: The -- the scenario that you just\nposed about the 6-month and the 1-year time limits -- you\ncould still file that State claim in Federal court within\n6 months. You have to comply with the -- the State cause\n-- the State statute of limitations. It's just in a forum\nthat maybe the State will ultimately object to.\nQUESTION: Yes, but the Federal Government wants\nto give you 12 months in its courts. That's -- that's the\npolicy that it's decided. We want to give you 12 months,\nand here's a State which has a State cause of action. It\nis -- it is putting you to the choice. You either forego\nthe -- the State cause of action or -- or you -- you file\nwithin 6 months. Doesn't that impede, to some extent,\nwhat the Federal Congress wanted to happen?\nMR. BOLTER: I think in your -- in that\nhypothetical, it probably would impede, but that's not the\nsituation that we have in front of us.\nQUESTION: Oh, I understand it isn't, but -- but\nI -- but the principle you're arguing for, it seems to me,\nleads to that conclusion, that the Federal Government can\n-- can reconfigure State causes of action willy-nilly so\nthat they don't impede the bringing of Federal causes of\naction in Federal court as Congress wishes.\nMR. BOLTER: What the -- what the statute does\nhere, if it's applied to a State, is it tolls the time\nlimit. It doesn't -- it doesn't change the time limit for\nthe -- the statute of limitations. If we were to file\nthis claim on the 50th day, 1367(d) wouldn't apply.\nQUESTION: Well, I -- I wonder about that. My\nunderstanding is -- correct me if I'm wrong, please --\nthat the Federal statute gives you an extra 30 days.\nMR. BOLTER: It gives you the -- the tolling --\nthe tolling provision runs for 30 days after the time\nafter the dismissal.\nQUESTION: Well, and so if you -- if -- if as in\nthis case, I think you file on the last day or the next-\nto-the-last day in the Federal court, then you're given an\nextra 30 days. So, you do reconfigure the State statute,\ncontrary to your suggestion. And -- and I have a\nsignificant problem with that. It might be that the\ntolling provision is necessary in order to make the\nFederal courts operate and exercise their jurisdiction in\nan efficient manner, but this statute goes beyond that and\ngives a longer statute of limitations.\nMR. BOLTER: Well, it gives a longer tolling --\nQUESTION: It does reconfigure the statute of\nlimitations.\nMR. BOLTER: I would respectfully disagree that\nit reconfigures the -- the statute of limitations because\nit's -- the statute -- the State statute has to be\ncomplied with in order for 1367 to -- to be triggered. It\nhas to be filed within the appropriate time period. And\n-- and that meets the statute of limitations objectives\nthat the State was seeking when it -- when it created that\n45-day period. The fact that it's being tolled after it's\nbeen timely filed is not -- that's -- that's not a core\ninterest that's protected by the State sovereign immunity.\nTolling a statute that has been complied with, in this\ncase filing within that 45 days --\nQUESTION: Well, it hasn't been complied with\nunder State law. If -- if the State law acknowledged the\nfiling in Federal court as -- as satisfying the statute of\nlimitations, you wouldn't be here. The problem is the\nState law says you have to file the action in State court\nwithin the statute of limitations period, and we're not\ngoing to give you any grace period for a false start that\nyou made in Federal court.\nMR. BOLTER: Well, the -- the State statute is\nsilent on tolling. It's not a condition of -- of the\nState's waiver of that 45-day period and --\nQUESTION: But the State court here found that\nthe State district court did not abuse its discretion in\nsaying there wouldn't be any tolling, did it not?\nMR. BOLTER: That's what -- they found that\nthere was no abuse of discretion, but that was -- that --\nthe State court's initial decision there was based on a --\nan erroneous interpretation of Pennhurst II when --\nQUESTION: Well, but that presumably is up to\nthe Minnesota courts to decide when the -- when the State\nstatute is tolled.\nMR. BOLTER: They have the discretion to decide\nthat, but it's our position that the tolling provision of\n1367(d) can also toll that time period because it's not\nabrogating the State's sovereign immunity. It's not --\nQUESTION: Well, but you know, you say it isn't\ntolling because it's -- it doesn't really go to the length\nof the statute of limitations, one. But it does, you\nknow. If you say the -- if you want to say a statute of\nlimitations is tolled for a year, obviously that extends\nthe time that the State law would have allowed.\nMR. BOLTER: But it doesn't defeat the purpose\nof -- of the statute of limitations and -- and the need to\nfile in a timely fashion with that State statute to begin\nwith. And I think that's what the -- the State -- the --\nif the State has a core interest in the statute of\nlimitations, that's what it would be, is that claims are\nfiled within that time period. Now, whether it's filed in\na -- in a jurisdiction to which the State ultimately\nobjects is -- is another point.\nQUESTION: That isn't self-evident. I mean, if\nwhat you're saying is true, every State would\nautomatically allow tolling when suit is filed in a\nFederal court within the State statute period. If it were\nself-evidently true that the State policy is not at all\noffended by that, you wouldn't have a problem and you\nwouldn't be here because every State would say, well, it\nwas filed in Federal court. That's good enough for us.\nBut it isn't good enough for a lot of States.\nAnd -- and, you know, it's their policy we're talking\nabout, and their policy is you must file in State court\nwithin the limitations period.\nQUESTION: May I ask you a sort of preliminary\nquestion I'm kind of puzzled about? What is the source of\nthe Federal Government's power to enact the statute at\nall?\nMR. BOLTER: Article III to control the lower\nFederal courts gives the -- the Government the power to\ncreate these -- these Federal practices and procedures, in\nthis case, the -- the way to address combined Federal and\nState claims, as well as its -- its -- the powers to\nprotect individuals from losing their due process rights\nto have their claims heard and -- and burdening the access\nto the Federal courts.\nQUESTION: So, it's Article III you rely on.\nMR. BOLTER: Yes, Article III and -- and partly\non the equal -- equal protection for -- to allow\nplaintiffs to have access to Federal courts and bring\ntheir Federal claims and their State claims if they -- if\nthey need to do that as well.\nQUESTION: It would just -- when Congress passed\nthis, Congress I -- I assume was just thinking it was\nregulating the procedure in Federal courts, that it was\nexercising that power to implement Article III.\nAnd what you said about due process, I didn't\nsee any sign of that in the history of 1367. But you're\nnot suggesting that before 1367, people were denied due\nprocess because there wasn't a tolling provision.\nMR. BOLTER: In some circumstances, they were\nbecause of the claims -- the combination of the claims\nsplitting and claims preclusion laws in the State courts\nand States and the statute of limitations on those pendent\nclaims if they were brought in Federal court could result\nin a denial of a forum for that State claim if -- if a\nFederal claim was also asserted.\nQUESTION: Is there -- is there any indication\nthat Congress, when it amended 1367, relied on anything\nother than Article III? Are you suggesting it relied on\nsection 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment?\nMR. BOLTER: I don't think it's -- that it's\nexplicit in the congressional --\nQUESTION: Well, is it implicit?\nMR. BOLTER: I think it's implicit in there that\nthey're --\nQUESTION: Where do you find that?\nMR. BOLTER: Well, the protections that it --\nthat it provides --\nQUESTION: I mean, I'm -- I'm talking about what\nCongress thought, not what you think.\nMR. BOLTER: I -- I'm not sure I understand your\nquestion, Mr. Chief Justice.\nQUESTION: Well, my question was, is there any\nreason to think that Congress, when it made this\namendment, was relying on section 5 of the Fourteenth\nAmendment, in addition to Article III?\nMR. BOLTER: Aside from nothing explicit, I\ndon't -- I don't know what Congress was thinking other\nthan what I could speculate.\nQUESTION: Well -- well, don't we know that this\ncame out of the Federal Courts Study Committee?\nMR. BOLTER: Yes, it did come out of the Federal\nCourts Study Committee?\nQUESTION: And so -- and Congress took the\nsuggestion of that Federal Courts Study Committee, and as\nfar as I recall, in that report, they were talking about\nthe authority of Congress to regulate the procedure in\nFederal courts.\nMR. BOLTER: That's right. I think that goes to\nthe Article III, I guess I -- if I'm not -- if I'm\nmisunderstanding Mr. Chief Justice.\nQUESTION: Suppose we were to conclude that this\nstatute must rest upon Article III. We -- we reject your\ndue process and equal protection suggestions. What's the\nclosest case that you have where we have sustained a power\nlike this pursuant to Congress' authority to establish\ntribunals under Article III?\nMR. BOLTER: I have to think about that for just\na second.\nQUESTION: Is it Terrell/Taro v. Burt\nConstruction Company where the State cannot condition the\nfiling of articles of incorporation on a waiver of the\nright to go to Federal court? It can't burden the right\nto go to Federal court?\nMR. BOLTER: That -- I think that is an example.\nI think probably Nash is also an example.\nQUESTION: Although I think Terrell/Taro was\nprobably a Commerce Clause case.\nMR. BOLTER: I'm not sure, Justice Kennedy, if\nit was or not.\nI think Nash, though, was also -- I think Nash\ngets to your question as well.\nQUESTION: Which -- which case?\nMR. BOLTER: The Nash -- the Nash --\nQUESTION: Florida Industrial Commission.\nMR. BOLTER: Nash v. Florida Industrial\nCommission.\nQUESTION: Nash.\nMR. BOLTER: I -- I couldn't hear Mr. Chief\nJustice. But I think that case also talks about burdening\nthe Federal rights in an NLRB case.\nQUESTION: Going back to the statute of\nlimitations point, I -- I should know this, but if I file\na complaint in the Nevada State courts and the Nevada\ncourt said, this doesn't belong here, there's no\njurisdiction, the cause of action arose exclusively in\nCalifornia, and it dismisses, and you then file in\nCalifornia, is there tolling as a general matter?\nMR. BOLTER: In that situation with -- with two\nStates, I would say that unless it was within the time\nperiod of California, it would probably not be tolled in\nthat situation.\nQUESTION: All right. Well, that -- that seems\nto me very similar to what we have here.\nMR. BOLTER: Well, we have a filing in Federal\ncourt here with -- with a statute that -- that directly\naddresses the tolling --\nQUESTION: Well, but you're -- you're -- well,\nit does or it doesn't. But you -- you indicated earlier\nthat the statute of limitations was not in any way\nextended because it was tolled by the filing. But it is\nextended by this additional 30 days. You basically have\n-- what was it? 45 -- the 45 plus 30. You have 75 days\nnow, almost double.\nMR. BOLTER: Well, I think that the tolling\nprovision is different. I mean, it does give additional\ntime, but it doesn't extend the time period that the State\nwas open and exposed to liability. It doesn't extend that\n45-day period. They were already notified of it. They --\nthey were put on notice. They had the -- they knew that\nthey were going to be sued and it was brought in -- within\nthat 45-day period.\nThe fact that it was suspended during a time\nperiod where the State was in Federal court at its own --\nits own discretion, it would be -- it would be harmful to\nthe plaintiffs to have the State be able to use the delay\nin time that it's pending in Federal court to bar the\nclaim from being brought after that in State court.\nQUESTION: Mr. Bolter, what you said might be so\nif the only purpose of the statute of limitations were\nrepose, being notified on time that you're subject to\nsuit.\nBut there are certain statutes that have been\ncalled so-called built-in statute of limitations where the\nlimitation is considered part and parcel of the right\nitself usually when it's in the very same statute, and\nthat seems to be the kind of limitation that we have here.\nWe have a State that is giving up its sovereign immunity,\nbut only on these terms. So, why isn't this a built-in\nstatute of limitations? So, by necessity there would be\nharm when the State says it's the right -- we condition\nthe right on you bringing suit within 45 days.\nMR. BOLTER: They didn't make, as a part of that\ncondition, anything about tolling. That's -- that's I\nthink the -- the first point, and -- and that's what this\nstatute is doing, is tolling. It's not changing that --\nthat right, that built-in right that you talk about, to\nthe 45-day period. That -- that still has to be complied\nwith. But this is talking about tolling, which is a\ndifferent -- it's a different animal here, but it doesn't\nextend that time limit, that -- that built-in time limit\nsimply by tolling. It suspends it from running out but it\ndoesn't extend it. I couldn't have filed that claim 75\ndays after it was sued. I had to file it within 45 days\nor else it would have been barred, and 1367 would not have\nattached.\nQUESTION: But I take it you're saying that\nwhether you regard it as built in or whether you regard\nthe policy as simply a policy of repose, Article III power\nor section 5 power is what it is, and -- and it can\naccomplish what this statute wants to accomplish.\nMR. BOLTER: Yes.\nQUESTION: I don't know why you rely just on\nArticle III or on section 5, which I think is pretty\nremote in this situation. Why -- why don't you rely on\nthe underlying Federal statute? There will always be some\nFederal power that justified the Federal cause of action\nwhich is the subject of this extension provision.\nLet's assume it's a Commerce Clause cause of\naction. Under the Commerce Clause, the Federal Government\ncould have, if it wanted, eliminated the State cause of\naction entirely, couldn't -- couldn't it? It could have\nsaid, we -- we preempt any State action in this field, and\nthe whole State cause of action would be washed away. If\nit can do that, why can't it do the lesser act of not\nwashing away the State cause of action, but just saying,\nyou know, if you bring suit in Federal court on this\nCommerce Clause cause of action, you get another 30 days\nor whatever, 45 days, whatever it is?\nMR. BOLTER: Well, it doesn't -- it doesn't --\nQUESTION: Wouldn't that work? That -- that\nmakes me feel a lot more comfortable than just relying on\nArticle III.\nMR. BOLTER: Well, I don't think that it\nwashes --\nQUESTION: I'm trying to help you.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BOLTER: I don't know that I understand.\nAre you saying that they had power under the Commerce --\nif they had power under the Commerce Clause, could they do\nthis?\nQUESTION: This statute itself piggy-backs on\nwhatever substantive Federal statute exists out there, you\nknow, whether it's under the Commerce Clause or under any\nother Federal power. And -- and that Federal power would\nallow the total elimination of the cause of -- of the\nState cause of action. Why -- why is it unreasonable to\nallow a mere extension of the -- of the State limitations\non that State cause of action?\nMR. BOLTER: Well, I guess I don't disagree that\nit's not unreasonable to toll this -- these statutes of\nlimitations.\nQUESTION: Do you know of any case in which this\nCourt has held that Congress, when passing a statute of\nits own, could totally forbid a State to enact a similar\nstatute?\nMR. BOLTER: I'm not aware of a case like that,\nYour Honor.\nQUESTION: Neither am I.\nQUESTION: Mr. Bolter, in any event, that\nwouldn't take you very far because so often these pendent\nState claims are garden variety State tort law, contract\nclaims, are they not? I mean, there's the big Federal\nclaim, and then you latch onto that the State common law\nclaims. So, the State common law claims could arise out\nof the same transaction and occurrence, depend on the same\nnucleus of facts, and yet not be just a State counterpart\nof the Federal statute.\nDon't you -- don't you have that in -- in civil\nrights cases? Let's say, bring a 1983 claim against a\npolice officer and then you latch onto it State common law\nclaims for assault and battery?\nMR. BOLTER: Yes, and -- and that's what we have\ndone in this case, or that's what we -- that's what this\n-- and that's what this statute protects against, losing\nthose claims.\nI -- I'm not sure if I understood your question,\nJustice Ginsburg, about can you do that in Federal court,\nI mean, latch onto those Federal claims? Yes. I mean,\nthat -- that is what supplemental jurisdiction is about in\nthis situation. So, I don't think that that's -- that's\nappropriate to do that. And -- and it goes back to giving\nthe State a choice of whether it wants to be there or not\nby exercising its constitutional defense of sovereign\nimmunity.\nI mean, I think the key -- one of the key things\nhere is that this -- that the tolling does not abrogate\nthe State's sovereign immunity because it's in a\njurisdiction that it wants to be in at all times. The\nchoice is its own. And the sovereign immunity core\nprinciples described by this Court in its jurisprudence\nhave been whether and where a State can be sued, and it\ndoesn't infringe on those core interests. Tolling has\nnever been identified as a core interest of -- of\nsovereign --\nQUESTION: Just whether and where and not when.\nRight? So, the Federal Government could -- could override\nState statute of limitations on sovereign immunity cases\nno matter what because it's not really part of sovereign\nimmunity.\nMR. BOLTER: I don't --\nQUESTION: The State says, I'm willing to be\nsued for 1 year, and you say the Federal Government\ndoesn't have to observe that 1 year. It can say, well,\nyou know, it's 2 years instead.\nMR. BOLTER: No. I think that the -- that 1\nyear has to be respected, but this is about tolling. It's\nnot about changing a statute of limitations. This is\nabout tolling the time period for it to run out.\nIf there are no further questions at this time,\nI'd like to reserve the remainder for rebuttal.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Bolter.\nMr. Rotenberg, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK B. ROTENBERG\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. ROTENBERG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nYour Honors, it's critical to focus on the\nfundamental issue of federalism presented in this case;\nnamely, is it Congress or the State that has the power to\ndecide when that State can be sued by its own citizens in\nits own courts?\nQUESTION: So, in your view, the Soldiers and\nSailors Relief Act -- all of the soldiers in Afghanistan,\nwhen they come back and they find that their statute of\nlimitations has run out, Congress does not have the power\nto extend the statute. Is that right --\nMR. ROTENBERG: Your Honor --\nQUESTION: -- in your opinion?\nMR. ROTENBERG: Under --\nQUESTION: I mean, there's presently a statute\nthat says when they come back, people who are in the armed\nforces, they will discover that the statute of limitations\nin the States has been extended for 6 months. In your --\nor however long necessary. In your opinion, that's\nunconstitutional.\nMR. ROTENBERG: Your Honor, the -- the logic --\nit may be unconstitutional is the direct answer to your\nquestion. The logic --\nQUESTION: All right. Now, what about -- what\nabout tort reform? Suppose in the tort reform statutes\nthat pass, there is a provision that somehow in there is\nfavorable to a plaintiff. That could happen. And if that\ndoes happen, then the State doesn't want to follow it,\nunconstitutional to apply it.\nMR. ROTENBERG: Justice Breyer, the -- the\nthrust of Alden against Maine is that Congress does not\nhave the power under Article I to force a State to submit\nto a private suit for damages in its own courts.\nQUESTION: All right. Is it constitutional for\nCongress to pass a copyright law or a -- any of these tort\nstatutes that are federalized and say that the States\ncannot pass a statute that gives a cause of action in tort\nthat is different?\nMR. ROTENBERG: Your Honor, the answer to that\nquestion would depend on Federal preemption principles.\nQUESTION: Correct.\nMR. ROTENBERG: Under the Commerce Clause --\nQUESTION: Now, they -- they can preempt. Fine.\nThen if they can do that, why can't they shape\nthe cause of action in the State so that it corresponds\nwith Federal law by, for example, extending a little bit\nor not extending too much the statute of limitations?\nMR. ROTENBERG: The reason they cannot do -- the\nCongress cannot do that, Justice Breyer, is because this\nstatute, 1367(d), represents a blanket attempt by Congress\nto extend statutes of limitations without regard to the\nexistence of an independent power in Article I, such as\nthe war power which may suffice to protect --\nQUESTION: That -- that power will always exist\nin the Federal cause of action that has been brought in\nFederal court.\nMR. ROTENBERG: It will exist, Your -- Your\nHonor, in -- in the --\nQUESTION: In every case to which this -- this\nstatute applies, there will be involved a Federal power\nunder Article I.\nMR. ROTENBERG: Well, not in this case, Your\nHonor, and this case is a perfect example of the -- of the\nsituation. This -- this Court held that, in fact, there\nwas no power under Article I to hail the State into\nFederal court in an age case. So -- and -- and\npetitioners here --\nQUESTION: No, but that's -- essentially you're\ngoing back to the Eleventh Amendment. I mean, your -- I\nunderstand your Eleventh Amendment argument, but you're\ntrying to overlay an Article I argument on that, and I\nthink that's where we're having -- having our difficulty.\nBut as I understand it, your ultimate answer to the\ndifficulty is the Eleventh Amendment.\nMR. ROTENBERG: We -- Justice Souter, we have\ntwo arguments, yes. The -- the essential point of -- of\nAlden relates to causes of action against the State\nsovereign, and this Court in Alden has established a\ncategorical rule that a State's power to condition its\nwaiver of immunity is -- is not subject to the Article I\npower of Congress to amend. In Alden, this Court held\nthat, to the extent Maine chose to consent to certain\ntypes of suits, while maintaining immunity in other types\nof suits, it has done no more than exercise its privilege\nof sovereignty concomitant to its constitutional immunity\nfrom suit. So, that is the first and most important point\nhere.\nWith regard to the -- the plenary authority of\nCongress to adopt a sweeping statute of limitations\nalteration in -- in the States that applies to an\nunlimited type of claim, you have to look at whether there\nwas an express intent to abrogate and --\nQUESTION: May I interrupt you?\nMR. ROTENBERG: -- and that would take you into\na -- a section 5, Fourteenth Amendment type analysis.\nAnd --\nQUESTION: May I ask you this question as a\npreliminary matter? Putting the Eleventh Amendment to --\nto one side just for a moment, because I do understand\nyour position there, assume this was a suit against a\npublic utility and the -- and they -- Minnesota provided\nan especially short statute of limitations for that public\nutility. Would -- would you think the -- the Federal\nstatute would be unconstitutional as applied in such a\ncase, or would it be valid?\nMR. ROTENBERG: The -- the statute is\nunconstitutional if the Court needs to address the\nquestion of legislative power, Justice Stevens, because\nthere is no case upholding a congressional power to enact\na sweeping expansion of statute of limitations --\nQUESTION: There's no case upholding it, no case\nstriking it down. But -- but in any event, you think the\nstatute would be unconstitutional even if you didn't have\na State defendant.\nMR. ROTENBERG: That's right, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Well, that -- that goes quite far.\nWhat -- what is your reasoning there?\nMR. ROTENBERG: The reasoning there, Mr. Chief\nJustice, is simply that since the Founding Convention,\nit's been clear that the powers of Congress are defined\nand limited, and the residual legislative power does not\nrest with Congress. It rests with the States under the\nTenth Amendment under this Court's decisions in Marbury\nand the -- as recently as United States against Morrison.\nThe -- the point of the matter is, Your Honors,\nthat my able petitioners' counsel here has -- has failed\nto suggest any case law that supports the enactment of a\n-- of a change in the State statutes of limitations that's\nunhinged from a particular exercise of power --\nQUESTION: But -- but Article III is certainly a\nparticular power.\nMR. ROTENBERG: Yes, Your Honor. But the\ntribunal --\nQUESTION: Mr. Rotenberg, did -- did the\nMinnesota Supreme Court go that far? I thought that their\ndecision as to the unconstitutionality of 1367 related\nonly to cases in which the State was the defendant.\nMR. ROTENBERG: Justice --\nQUESTION: And to the extent that you're asking\nus to consider this broader theory, you're asking us to\ntake that up -- to go beyond where the Minnesota Supreme\nCourt left off.\nMR. ROTENBERG: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, that's\ncorrect. The Minnesota Supreme Court did not hold that\nthe statute was unconstitutional as applied in all --\nQUESTION: And your position -- your position\nwould, as Justice Breyer suggested, mean that the Soldiers\nand Sailors Civil Relief Act is invalid, insofar as it\ntolls State statute of limitations as well.\nQUESTION: In actions against the State.\nQUESTION: This would -- this -- this would be a\nbig surprise, I think --\nMR. ROTENBERG: Justice O'Connor --\nQUESTION: -- to members of the armed forces.\nMR. ROTENBERG: Justice O'Connor, the -- the --\nQUESTION: Why -- why do you want to go that\nfar? Why don't you stick with what the lower courts did\nand talk about the Eleventh Amendment? What -- what\npossible advantage is it to you to make this sweeping\nargument you're making?\nMR. ROTENBERG: Justice O'Connor, it is\ncertainly sufficient for this Court to address only the\nAlden principle, as Justice Kennedy just mentioned, and\nrestrict the holding to a State sovereign --\nQUESTION: And in that regard, what's the matter\nwith the Solicitor General's approach that says the\nstatute was never intended to cover nonconsenting States?\nDon't interpret as applying. What's the matter with that?\nMR. ROTENBERG: Justice O'Connor, we agree with\nthe Solicitor General that the statute can and, indeed,\nshould be so construed.\nQUESTION: I guess then the next case -- then\nthe next case we'll have is where the soldiers and sailors\ncome back and they would like to sue the State. Maybe\nit's a pension. Maybe it's a tort. Maybe it's a\ncontract. There can be many, many things in States that\n-- where the residents have a cause of action, and I guess\neven your minimal position would make it unconstitutional\nfor them to do so.\nMR. ROTENBERG: Justice Breyer, this Court has\nnot addressed the intersection between its holding in\nAlden against Maine, which establishes a categorical rule\nthat Congress is disempowered from forcing a State to\ndefend itself against its own citizens in its own State\ncourts, and the -- the war power. That case has not been\npresented, and I would suggest to Your Honors --\nQUESTION: Well, the war power is -- is an\nArticle I power. I mean, a minute ago I thought you were\nmaking a -- a flat Article I argument.\nMR. ROTENBERG: Yes, Justice Souter. The -- my\n-- my understanding of this Court's jurisprudence in this\narea -- and Alden isn't the only case that stands for this\nproposition, of course -- is that Congress, acting within\nits Article I power, is -- has no authority to abrogate\nsovereign immunity.\nNow, it hasn't -- Your Honors have not\nspecifically faced what I would submit is a very\nchallenging issue, as suggested by Justice O'Connor's\nquestion. Do we really mean each and every exercise of\nArticle I power, even and including the war power to\nprotect sailors abroad?\nQUESTION: Well, what would -- what would\npossibly be the ground for distinguishing. The State has\nsovereign immunity or it doesn't.\nMR. ROTENBERG: Justice Kennedy, I agree, and I\nthink that the practical answer in our federalism is to\nallow the States to exercise good judgment with respect to\ntheir tolling provisions. It -- it strains the\nimagination --\nQUESTION: Precisely. They can waive if they\nwant to.\nMR. ROTENBERG: Exactly.\nQUESTION: Well, that's what bothered me. This\nmay just be a misprint or something, but quite clearly the\nState of Minnesota has the power to say that our consent\nextends to this tolling provision, doesn't it? It could.\nIt could come out the other way if it wants to. And,\nindeed, they say that the equitable tolling applies to\ntheir statute, don't they?\nAll right. Now, I read their opinion. I've\nread this six times. Not six, but only two. Let me not\nexaggerate.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: But -- but when they get to the --\nQUESTION: It seemed like six. Right?\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: When -- when they get to the point,\nthis very point, it says, however, we read Alden to\nrequire the university's waiver of immunity be limited to\nthe -- be limited to the parameters set forth in the\nstatute; i.e., 45 days.\nWell, Alden has nothing to do with that. But\nthey seem to think -- and after all, they did say that\nthis statute says 45 days, but it doesn't mean 45 days in\nrespect to equitable tolling. But they seem to think that\nour case Alden required them to limit it to the 45 days,\nwhich of course it doesn't.\nSo, they seem to be under a misapprehension in\nthat respect, and I would like you to address that, what\nwe should do about that.\nMR. ROTENBERG: Justice Breyer, I agree with you\nthat Alden does not compel a particular interpretation of\nState law. That's certainly true.\nIt is also true that the Minnesota Supreme Court\nunanimously determined that the 45-day limitation on its\nwaiver of sovereign immunity is -- is part and parcel of\nthe statute, as Justice Ginsburg previously mentioned, and\nis an aspect of its -- of its sovereign immunity and in --\nin addition said that the equitable tolling principle\ncould be applied. But it's important to recall that the\nMinnesota courts apply the equitable tolling principles in\nan extremely conservative fashion.\nQUESTION: Yes, but my question, of course, is,\nwhat do we do about that sentence in the opinion which\nsays, we read Alden to require that the waiver of immunity\nbe limited to 45 days?\nMR. ROTENBERG: Well --\nQUESTION: That's -- that's -- if they had said\nexactly what you just said, I wouldn't have my question.\nMR. ROTENBERG: Justice Breyer, this Court need\nnot affirm every sentence of the Minnesota Supreme Court's\ndecision. It only need affirm the judgment, and the\njudgment can be affirmed simply by reference to the fact,\nthe constitutional fact, that Alden proscribes\ncongressional alterations of -- of State waivers of\nsovereign immunity.\nQUESTION: Mr. Rotenberg, because sovereign\nimmunity is kind of a peculiar objection -- that is, the\nState -- it's up to the State to waive it or not. It's\nnot like a case where the Federal court wouldn't have\nsubject matter jurisdiction. Shouldn't, at least for the\nperiod that the State stood silent, which I understand was\nabout 9 months, in Federal court -- at least for that\nperiod, shouldn't the State be treated as having been\nlegitimately before the Federal court not complaining\nabout it? So, for those 9 months, at least, the\nlimitation ought to be tolled.\nMR. ROTENBERG: No, Your Honor. It -- it isn't\ntrue that Minnesota stood silent for 9 months. The\nuniversity asserted its sovereign immunity defense at the\nearliest opportunity, namely in its answer, and -- and\nnever in any way suggested a waiver of such a -- of such a\ndefense. This Court has held repeatedly that waivers of\nsovereign immunity by the States is not to be inferred and\nnot to be implied.\nQUESTION: What was going on? I understand, at\nleast from the dates, that this was raised 9 months after\nthe litigation commenced. What was going on? Usually an\nanswer is in -- how many days?\nMR. ROTENBERG: 20 days, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. ROTENBERG: And we filed our answer\nasserting sovereign immunity within that time frame.\nThere's nothing the university could have done to save\ntheir claim. The -- they filed in Federal court merely 48\nhours before the statute of limitations would -- the 45-\nday rule would have expired even under their\nunderstanding, meaning that a filing in the wrong court\nsuffices to be a filing in the correct court. So, there's\nnothing the university did to delay whatsoever.\nMoreover, we filed a dispositive motion at -- in\na timely way, consistent with the normal course of\nlitigation in this case. Most Federal trial courts prefer\nthat dispositive motions not be filed seriatim. And we --\nwe noticed the motion, and there was a scheduling order,\nwhich plaintiff knew about, in the spring of 1997, and we\nfiled the dispositive motion asserting our sovereign\nimmunity in June of '97.\nAnd even if you would say that -- that somehow\nthe petitioners here were not fully aware, as they should\nhave been, that the university was asserting its sovereign\nimmunity from the get-go, by June 3, they had a motion, a\ndispositive motion, and the filing in the State forum\nstill exceeded the 45 days.\nQUESTION: Well, I -- I suppose under the rule\nyou're suggesting that we adopt the State could -- let's\nassume that the claim is filed in the Federal court on the\nfifth day, and there's 40 days more left. I suppose the\nState could just sit back and wait for 60 days before it\nmoves to dismiss to allow the claim to go stale, under\nyour submission.\nMR. ROTENBERG: Justice Kennedy, that's possible\nbut that was not what happened here, number one, and\nnumber --\nQUESTION: Well, it not only is possible. It's\nthe necessary concomitant -- necessary sequence from the\nrule you -- you propose.\nMR. ROTENBERG: Your Honor --\nQUESTION: It's not possible, it's necessary.\nThat's your rule.\nMR. ROTENBERG: -- it isn't -- it isn't my rule\nalone, Your Honor. Pennhurst explicitly --\nQUESTION: It's the result you want us to adopt.\nMR. ROTENBERG: Yes, it is, Your Honor. But\nPennhurst specifically suggests -- yes. Excuse me.\nPennhurst explicitly says that the expedient of filing the\nclaim in the State court will avoid any danger of this\nkind occurring. And -- and Pennhurst stands clearly for\nthe proposition that a filing of the State claim, a\nprotective claim, which petitioners' counsel here\nacknowledged would solve the problem, and filing the\nFederal claim in the Federal forum is a constitutionally\nappropriate expedient.\nAny contrary indication brings into question the\n-- the opinion of this Court in -- in Pennhurst by\nsuggesting that filing concomitantly in the State and\nFederal forums is somehow a due process problem.\nLet me conclude with an -- a closing observation\nabout the due process issue. Petitioners have not cited a\nsingle case, not a single case, holding that the State's\nhandling of pendent claims, in the absence of section\n1367, somehow violated due process. And equally\nimportant, Your Honors, petitioners do not seriously claim\nthat 1367(d) is a valid exercise of Congress' power under\nsection 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to address any\nsupposed due process problems. The record is simply bare.\nMoreover, due process cannot be the basis of any\nsupposed abrogation here because the first element of\nabrogating the State's sovereign immunity, using section 5\nof the Fourteenth Amendment, is an explicit statement of\nCongress. There is no such explicit statement of Congress\nhere. In fact, the record is silent as to any due process\nclaim either in the halls of Congress or in the -- in the\ncase law, at least as cited or referred to by -- by\npetitioners.\nAnd most importantly, Your Honors, and in\nconclusion, whether there might conceivably be an\nunfairness in some hypothetical State situation, this\nquestion of unfairness does not trump the Alden principle,\nthat Congress cannot, by an observation of unfairness\nfalling short of a due process issue, force a State to\nsubmit to suit against itself in its own courts.\nQUESTION: I suppose unfairness is what\nsovereign immunity is all about, isn't it?\nMR. ROTENBERG: It may be seen that way by some\nplaintiffs, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Rotenberg.\nMR. ROTENBERG: Thank you.\nQUESTION: Mr. Clement, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT\nMR. CLEMENT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nWhen this Court confronts a general grant of\njurisdiction, like 1367(a), it routinely infers that the\nstatute does not apply to nonconsenting States. Such a\nconstruction avoids difficult -- upsetting the balance\nbetween Federal and State powers.\nFor similar reasons, this Court should construe\nsection 1367(d)'s tolling provision not to apply to\nnonconsenting States. That reading avoids the difficult\nsovereign immunity questions posed by the application of a\nFederal statute to extend the State statute of limitations\nagainst a nonconsenting State in State court.\nQUESTION: You -- basically you're saying clear\nstatement. Is that -- is that nub of your point?\nMR. CLEMENT: The nub of the point --\nQUESTION: The clear statement rule.\nMR. CLEMENT: -- is this Court should apply a\nclear statement rule to this statute, the supplemental\njurisdiction statute, and since there's no indication in\nthe text or legislative history that Congress had any\ncontemplation that this would apply to nonconsenting\nStates, this Court should construe the provision as not\napplying to nonconsenting States.\nQUESTION: Do you -- do you agree that in the\nabsence of a clear statement rule, there is no ambiguity\nhere that -- that would open the door to our giving this\nkind of a construction?\nMR. CLEMENT: There is -- there is enough\nambiguity in the statute, if the Court wanted to, to reach\nthe second argument that we offer in our brief, but I\nwould suggest that the first argument we offer in the\nbrief, which you could call the clear statement argument,\nis a more narrowly tailored and focused answer to the\nconstitutional issues that are raised by applying the\nstatute to nonconsenting States.\nQUESTION: Well, you've only got 10 minutes, and\nI'll leave it to you to whether you want to get into it.\nI -- I have trouble with the ambiguity argument. I\nunderstand your clear statement argument. I have trouble\nwith the ambiguity.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, if I could, I would focus on\nthe clear statement argument because I think it does very\nnarrowly avoid the constitutional issue that's raised.\nQUESTION: Now, to -- to apply the clear\nstatement argument, do we not have to at least decide that\nit does constitute an elimination of State sovereign\nimmunity to require the tolling of -- of the action\nagainst the State?\nMR. CLEMENT: I don't think so. I think this\nCourt only needs to decide that it would raise grave\nconstitutional doubts before it would need to apply the --\nthe clear statement rule because, although in some\ncontexts, in the abrogation context, for example, a clear\nstatement rule assumes that -- that the Congress can't\nconstitutionally do something, in other contexts as\nGregory v. Ashcroft, Will against the Michigan Department\nof -- of State -- in those cases, this Court has applied\nclear statement principles even though they don't assume\nthe answer to the constitutional question. And that, of\ncourse, is consistent with the way this Court approaches\nmatter as a general matter and its preference to avoid\nconstitutional questions.\nThe -- the Court, for example, just last term in\n-- in Vermont against United States ex rel. Stevens,\napplied similar principles of statutory construction to\navoid directly addressing the Eleventh Amendment --\nQUESTION: It's fine when you're dealing with an\nambiguous statute. Sure, just the mere presence of a\nconstitutional doubt will cause you to resolve the\nambiguity in such a fashion that it doesn't raise a\nconstitutional principle so you have sort of a clear\nstatement rule, unless it's a clear statement where\nthere's a -- but those are ambiguity cases.\nYou're -- you're purporting to forego reliance\nupon ambiguity and to say even assuming that the statute\nis clear, you should not interpret it to apply to the\nStates.\nAnd now, do you have any case not involving\nambiguity, where we have applied the clear statement rule\nwithout first finding that it is clearly an abrogation of\nState sovereign immunity?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I think, for example, in the\nStevens case, this Court interpreted the term person not\nto include the State. What effectively we're asking the\nCourt to do here is interpret the term, any claim, in\nsection 1367(d) to say any claim except one against a\nnonconsenting State.\nQUESTION: Well, I think in Atascadero we\ninterpreted the word person so that it did not include the\nState, even though you could say person means a lot.\nMR. CLEMENT: No. That's exactly right.\nAnd in Will against Michigan where the Court had\nalready held that 1983 did not implicate Eleventh\nAmendment issues, this Court nonetheless held that in\nState courts, the term person in 1983 does not apply to --\nto States or to State officers acting in their official\ncapacities.\nAnd I think all of those cases and the -- the\nCourt's decision in Gregory against Ashcroft and in Will\nall stand for the proposition that this Court can apply a\nclear statement type principle to avoid a\nconstitutional --\nQUESTION: How -- how do you respond to the\nSoldiers and Sailors Civil Relief Act as applied to States\nin tolling causes of action against the State?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I -- I think that -- that in\norder to maintain consistency with our position in this\ncase, we would have to ask this Court to apply a clear\nstatement rule in that case, and the current version of\nthe statute would probably not apply to States under that\n-- under that theory.\nQUESTION: So, has that been happening? I mean,\nis it the case that the armed forces members have been\nsuing States or not under the act?\nMR. CLEMENT: We haven't seen that the -- that\nthe issue of sovereign immunity arising in those contexts,\nand it very well -- well --\nQUESTION: And it could be just that --\nMR. CLEMENT: It very well may be, as counsel\nfor the University of Minnesota suggested, that States\nwill have the good sense in those instances to waive their\nsovereign immunity defense. I mean, the same principles\nthat are going to motivate the Federal Government to pass\nthe Soldiers and Sailors Civil Relief Act are going to\nmotivate State governments to waive their sovereign\nimmunity defenses in those claims.\nNow, it seems to me that -- two points I'd like\nto make. First of all, it's worth focusing on the fact\nthat even before 1367(d), the informal Federal court\npractices for dealing with potentially untimely State\nclaims did not apply to nonconsenting States. Justice\nScalia, you raised the -- the problem of conditioning a\ndismissal on a withdraw -- of statute of limitations\ndefenses. But, of course, under Pennhurst II, a State has\nan absolute right to insist that the pendent claims\nagainst it be dismissed. So, in that context, the Federal\ncourt would not be able to condition the dismissal on a\nwaiver of a statute of limitations defense, nor would it\nbe able to retain jurisdiction over the claim. So, it\nstands to reason that 1367(d) should no more apply to\ncases against nonconsenting States than the Federal court\npractices it replaced.\nLastly, I would emphasize that this\ninterpretation of section 1367(d) does not place\nplaintiffs in an untenable position or in an\nunconstitutional bind. Plaintiffs, in cases where the\nState objects to Federal court jurisdiction as a blanket\nmatter, have the same rights that they would have under\nPennhurst II. They can file both claims in State court,\nthe Federal and the State, which seems a complete answer\nto any due process objections, or they can file parallel\nproceedings.\nEven if the State makes a decision whether to\nconsent on a case by cases, as Minnesota appears to do,\nthe State -- the plaintiff can still attempt to get\nconsent in the first instance, and if it's not, it can\nmake a protective filing along the lines that Justice\nGinsburg suggested.\nIn the end, it seems that plaintiffs lack any\ncase law to support their due process arguments. I think\nthat respondent, in fairness, lacks any case law to\nsupport its -- its Article I legislative power argument.\nThere's really no need for this Court to make any\nsignificant case law in order to decide this case if it\nsimply applies the clear statement test we suggest in our\nbrief.\nIf there's no other questions, I'll submit.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Clement.\nMr. Bolter, you have 2 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD L. BOLTER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BOLTER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nI'd like to address something that was brought\nup on -- again in questioning the university about being a\nnonconsenting State. It is -- their arguments -- the --\nthe university and the Solicitor General's arguments rely\non the fact that they were a nonconsenting State\nthroughout this whole procedure. And that's not an\naccurate characterization of what went on here. When they\nwere sued in Federal court, they were not a nonconsenting\nState until 9 months later when they brought that motion\nto dismiss.\nQUESTION: But they said they put it in their\nanswer within 20 days.\nMR. BOLTER: They did do that.\nQUESTION: And I think Mr. Rotenberg was quite\nright that the whole impulse of the Federal rules is you\nbring all of your motions at once and not seriatim.\nMR. BOLTER: They --\nQUESTION: But they -- if they raised that --\nthat Eleventh Amendment in their answer within the time\nallotted, I don't think that you can say that it was a\n9-month thing that they --\nMR. BOLTER: Raising the defense in the answer\nwas just like raising any other defense in that answer.\nThey had to assert it or else they would risk a waiver\nargument later on. All that did was preserve their right\nto bring the -- the motion 9 months later.\nQUESTION: Yes, but in preserving that right, it\n-- it certainly does not put them in the position of being\na consenting State.\nMR. BOLTER: Well, they were not a nonconsenting\nState.\nQUESTION: Look, what it boils down to is they\nhadn't filed the motion to dismiss yet. That's what we're\narguing about, isn't it?\nMR. BOLTER: Yes, they had not filed the motion\nand until that motion was filed, the court can't rule on\nit. The court can't -- is not going to dismiss the claim,\nand there will be supplemental jurisdiction over all the\nclaims that are --\nQUESTION: Yes, but by the same token, you know\nby the answer that they are not consenting to\njurisdiction.\nMR. BOLTER: All we knew by the answer is that\nthey were asserting an affirmative defense, just like they\nasserted a statute of limitations defense or laches or\nwaiver. And none of those can be ruled upon by the court\nuntil they are affirmatively brought before them to rule\non. They might have just decided not to do anything with\nit until the matter was tried on its merits, and they have\ndone that in another case, the Eldeeb case, which they\nreceived summary judgment on the merits of both State and\nFederal claims.\nQUESTION: Didn't you know also that you were at\nrisk of an interpretation of 1367? Justice Souter\nsuggested that there is no ambiguity, but at least there's\na respectable authority for saying there is and that the\ntolling of 1367(d) is limited to cases covered by 1367(c)\nand would not take in sovereign immunity.\nMR. BOLTER: We did not anticipate that that\ncould be a construction of -- of 1367 -- of 1367(d),\notherwise we might have reevaluated whether or not to\nbring it. But that wasn't -- there was nothing to suggest\nthat that was the status of the case law --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Bolter.\n"
