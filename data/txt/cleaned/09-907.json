        "content": "(10:06 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst this term in Case 09-907, Ransom v. FIA Card\nServices.\nMr. Burke.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER P. BURKE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BURKE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nIn 2005, Congress passed the Bankruptcy Act.\nIt made a policy decision to limit judicial discretion\non a case-by-case basis in the area of reasonable and\nnecessary expenses. It did so by creating a formula\nthat entailed an aggregate set amount of expenses for an\nindividual.\nNow, Congress could have created this from\nscratch. It could have used an arbitrary figure. But\ninstead, there were figures that the IRS already had,\nbased on Census Bureau statistics, that said nationwide,\nin a certain area, an individual would spend this much a\nmonth on average.\nIn the case of Mr. Ransom, that's\napproximately 2500 a month. Forgetting about how it's\ndivided up, if I had 100 people come in and answer the\nfollowing five questions the same way Mr. Ransom did,\nand that's age, location, household size, gross income,\nand if you have a vehicle, how many, they would all get\na $2500 standard aggregate deduction, which works out to\n$150,000 over a 5-year period.\nNow, the crux of this is whether or not\ncourts are allowed to dig in and cut out pieces of the\nstandard aggregate amount.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why is that the crux of it?\nCongress made reference to the local standards, right?\nMR. BURKE: Yes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And were the -- was the\ncommentary in the Collection Financial Standards in\nexistence at the time when Congress enacted this\nprovision?\nMR. BURKE: There was a Collection Financial\nAnalysis that was in place, and it was noted in 1998 as\na prior version of the bill that ultimately wasn't\npassed.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And that explains what the\nIRS understands the local standards to mean; isn't that\nright?\nMR. BURKE: I would disagree with that. I\nwould say -- well, it would -- it would explain what the\nIRS means, but that's where I would end it, because the\nIRS standards are used to collect taxes. They are\ndiscretionary. They -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, I understand that, but\nCongress decided to make reference to the local\nstandards in this bankruptcy provision, didn't it?\nMR. BURKE: Standards.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Yes.\nMR. BURKE: It didn't go beyond that.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And this -- and at the time\nwhen it did that, there was official IRS commentary\nregarding the meaning of those standards, correct?\nMR. BURKE: For the IRS to use in collecting\ntaxes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And your argument is that\nCongress intended to adopt the standards promulgated by\nthe IRS, but not the IRS's interpretation of the\nstandards.\nMR. BURKE: Correct, not their methodology\nor interpretation.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Doesn't the chart say\n\"ownership costs\"?\nMR. BURKE: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And you would read that\nto mean non-costs as well? I mean, if the -- if the\ntable is called ownership costs, then why not use the\nIRS's definition of what costs are, and that definition\nsays, what, loan payments and lease payments?\nMR. BURKE: Because you -- we have to look\nat it as a standard aggregate. And what I mean by that\nis -- okay, the Bankruptcy Code doesn't define ownership\ncosts. And ownership costs could be the replacement\nvalue. It could be buying a new vehicle. It could be\nthe costs associated with making payments on a vehicle.\nWhat that -- that average number is, in this\ncase, $471, is a nationwide figure that somebody would\nspend on average in a month. It doesn't mean that any\none individual spends that amount.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Burke, isn't it -\nisn't it the case that, even on the other side's\ninterpretation of it, it doesn't come down to actual\ncosts anyway? Isn't it the case, or do I misunderstand\nit, that so long as there is one payment, you get the\nentire deduction?\nMR. BURKE: That's their position, or even\n$1.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Even one payment of $1, you\nget the entire deduction. So to argue this case as\nthough it's a question of whether you actually expend\nthe money that you're getting the credit for is\nsimply -- is simply false. You don't do that under\neither side's interpretation, right?\nMR. BURKE: Again, I would perhaps -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm trying to help you,\nMr. Burke.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Burke, before you\nrespond to that question, isn't it so that in the event\nthat Justice Scalia just proposed, the trustee could\npropose an amendment to the plan to reflect that that\ncost is no longer being incurred?\nMR. BURKE: The cost has never been\nincurred. That's the point. And -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: My question is: In the\nsituation that Justice Scalia proposed, it's not\nautomatic that the $471 gets deducted because there\ncould be proposed an amendment of the plan to reflect\nthat that -- there's no longer any expense for\nownership.\nMR. BURKE: In the situation where there is\na dollar, of course, an amendment can be made. But see\nthe -- the dollar doesn't show up in the means test.\nThe means test is the aggregate -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it isn't -- it isn't\nautomatic that because there's one payment, then\nforever, the rest of the 5 years, he gets to deduct the\n$471.\nMR. BURKE: That's what the lower court\nsaid.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. What -- what\nhappens under the tax law? Do they make an adjustment\nunder the tax law as well?\nMR. BURKE: Of course -- under the tax law,\nyou get a standard deduction.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: A standard -\nMR. BURKE: No different than here. Nobody\ngoes behind the scenes and says, hey, what is that\nstandard deduction?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right. So that they -\nwhat is suggested is that you look at it and apply the\nIRS's approach as to whether you get into the chart, but\nthen you don't use the IRS's approach when the trustee\ntakes you out of the chart. Is that what you think is\nthe law?\nMR. BURKE: No, that's not what I think is\nthe law. What I'm saying is Congress has given, in this\ncase, an individual like Jason Ransom $150,000 over 5\nyears to spend. They are not saying whether he actually\nspends it in any one category.\nFor instance, the car ownership might be -\nequate to $28,000 over 5 years. Rent might be 1,000.\nThat's 60,000 over 5 years. Congress did not say go\nback and make sure Mr. Ransom is spending every dollar.\nThese are averages across the nation. And when it comes\nto a car ownership expense, we're not saying spend $471.\nOh, you have no payment? You didn't spend anything for\n5 years?\nNo. What it's saying is, over 5 years, I\nhave a cost associated with owning that vehicle, whether\nit's a loan or lease payment, whether it's replacing the\nvehicle, whether it's major repairs, on average, across\nthe country.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You do. You do, but the\ndifficulty that I -- I don't get the answer to\nJustice Ginsburg's first question.\nOf course you have all kinds of costs\ndealing with ownership, but what the IRS says, what it\nsays in the statute, is you are supposed to take the\napplicable costs from IRS. And what it has on page 5a\nis it has something called \"ownership costs.\"\nMR. BURKE: Correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And it defines those as\n$471.\nMR. BURKE: Correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And then on 3a, where it\nsays what ownership costs are, it says the\ntransportation standards consist of nationwide figures\nfor monthly loan or lease payments, referred to as\nownership costs. So when I read that, I said ownership\ncosts means monthly loan or lease payments, nothing\nelse.\nNow, you have all kinds of other things.\nIt's just these words \"ownership costs\" don't refer to\nthose other things, because of that definition given\nright there. That's what I thought Justice Ginsburg was\ninitially asking.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, I was.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And I -- and how -- how do\nyou get out of that what I think of as very, very clear\nlanguage which says what these standards refer to?\nMR. BURKE: Because the standards refer to\nthe numbers. It's a chart.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but it doesn't -- for\nexample, suppose you buy a dozen apples every month, and\nthey cost you $48 extra. You're not going to say the\nownership costs refer to the apples, even if you\ndecorate the car with them.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BURKE: What -- what -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, ownership costs\nrefers to lease and loan payments. Nothing else.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What's the language we're\ndealing with, Mr. Burke? Do you want to quote the\nlanguage to us?\nNobody's quoted the language. What does it\nsay is applicable?\nMR. BURKE: What the statute says is the\napplicable -- you shall get, mandatory, the applicable\namounts specified based on where a debtor resides -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wait. The -- the\napplicable amounts specified where?\nMR. BURKE: In the national local standards.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Read the text of the\nstatute, would you, please, for me? I couldn't even get\nit from your brief. You had to refer me back to the\npetition. Why isn't in an appendix to your brief or\nprinted in the beginning of your brief, instead of\nkicking me back to dig out your petition?\nMR. BURKE: \"The debtor's monthly expenses\nshall be the debtor's applicable monthly expense amounts\nspecified under the national local standards.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: \"Amount specified under\"\nthe standard.\nMR. BURKE: Specific amount, \"applicable\"\nmodifies \"amounts specified.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: \"Applicable amounts\nspecified,\" not the amounts specified if applicable.\nMR. BURKE: Correct, based on where a debtor\nresides.\nNow, the only way a court can say that an\nindividual has to have a debt on a car to get this\ndeduction -- there's two ways: One -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Look at the local standard,\nwhich is on page 8 of the appendix to your brief, right?\nAnd all it says is \"Ownership Costs,\" \"First Car,\"\n\"$471.\" That's the relevant text, isn't it?\nMR. BURKE: Yes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What if a person leases a\ncar? Do you think they get ownership costs?\nMR. BURKE: Yes, because they get the cost\nwhether they owe on it or not.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But they don't own the car,\nso how can they get ownership costs?\nMR. BURKE: There's a different definition.\n\"Ownership\" doesn't mean -- it can mean possession.\nBut -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Where do you get that, from\nthe -\nMR. BURKE: Black's Law Dictionary.\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- from the Collection\nFinancial Standards?\nMR. BURKE: No. The Collection Financial\nStandards say you get the lease -- you get the deduction\nif you have a loan or a lease payment.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Where do you get the\ndefinition that somebody who leases something owns it?\nMR. BURKE: I don't. I'm not sure they do\nown it.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Then how do they get\nownership costs?\nMR. BURKE: Because you have possession of\nit. It's based on having the item. It's costs\nassociated with having the item, whether it's paid off\nor not.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If somebody rents an\napartment, do they own the apartment?\nMR. BURKE: Probably under ownership, their\npossession is some type of an ownership. It may be just\npossessory.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is there something wrong\nwith the IRS saying what they mean? It says ownership\ncosts means monthly loan or lease payments. Now, is\nthere something -\nMR. BURKE: The problem -\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's what it says it\nmeans. Now, is there something illegal about it\ndefining ownership costs in that way?\nMR. BURKE: No, for the collection of taxes,\nthere is not. But if you're going to use -- start\ndigging into the manual, you might as well bring it all\ninto 707(b), and, as we discussed earlier, there was\nlanguage that said the collection financial analysis\nshould be brought in, but that was deleted in the final\nversion.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why not just -- it says\nyou are supposed to look at the form; it says ownership\ncosts. So the only thing you'd look at the IRS for\nis -- the manual -- is to define ownership costs. And\nthey say ownership costs means those two things.\nMR. BURKE: Well, I don't -- there's no\nreason to limit it. If you're going to -- the text\ndoesn't say -- it says national local standards. It\ndoesn't discriminate or give disparate treatment to that\none item. If you're going to give it to one item, then\nit can be pulled in, and it should be -- the same\ntreatment should be given to all items, and we should\nhave to prove some type of a -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't follow that. If\nthe simple thing is to just -- what does the word\n\"costs\" mean? And then you look to the IRS manual, and\nit tells you that \"costs\" means loan or lease payments.\nMR. BURKE: To collect taxes, that's how\nthey defined it. But in the statute it says you get\n\"local standard amounts specified.\" It does not stretch\nit and say \"under the IRS's interpretation.\" That\nlanguage was taken out. And if we were to use the IRS's\ninterpretation, here's the whole problem: It's\ndiscretionary. It goes up and down. It's based on an\nIRS revenue agent. It -- let me give you a separate\nexample. Nobody -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Burke, if we could stay\nwith this. The $471 is derived by looking at the\naverage loan or lease payments nationwide. Then, in\naddition to that, we know that the IRS has a separate\ncategory for operating costs that is meant to reflect\ncosts of having a car that are not your loan and lease\npayments. So, between those two things, why wouldn't we\nsay that ownership costs means your loan and lease\npayments, but operating costs means your other costs of\nhaving a car, and that you get the operating costs if\nyou have a car but don't make loan and lease payments,\nand you get the ownership costs if you do make loan and\nlease payments?\nMR. BURKE: Because to reach that, you have\nto go into the Internal Revenue Manual. It's not in the\nstatute that says you have to owe on it to get it. And\nif you go into the Internal Revenue Manual -- let's look\nat operating expenses. What it says, in collecting\ntaxes -- and it's in the Joint Appendix at pages 83\nthrough 88. But what it says, when it comes to local\nnational other expenses, an internal revenue agent has\ndiscretion. You only get these expenses -- this is the\noverall idea -- if they produce income or if it's for\nhealth and welfare.\nAnd so, when we look at the Joint Appendix\npage 88, section B, under the local standard\ntransportation expenses, when it talks about operating\ncosts, which is something you just mentioned, it says\nyou only get transportation expenses that are used to\nproduce income or the health and welfare of an\nindividual and their family.\nPlus, the fact that you own a car, the IRS\nunder its discretion can take away the operating costs\nif it's on four cinder blocks in your backyard. You're\nnot incurring fuel costs, mileage costs; you are not\nprobably paying registration or any of those other\noperating costs. The IRS agent, under their manual, can\ntake away that expense.\nSo, why stop and say, well, we're just going\nto look at the ownership costs? And all they're saying\nhere is if you owe on it, you get it; if you don't owe,\nyou don't get it. Let's not look at anything else in\nthe Internal Revenue Manual, which is a 39-part,\n500-page document that in some ways is almost\nincomprehensible, and direct the -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Burke, the -- it's\nunusual to allow a deduction for the purpose of\ncalculating disposable income although you don't have\nany expense. I understand how you get to that\nconclusion with respect to car ownership. Is there any\nother provision that in -- in calculating disposable\nincome, you are allowed a deduction for an expense that\nyou don't incur?\nMR. BURKE: If the Court understands my view\nthat Congress gave -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: No. The question -- is\nthere anything else that works like this? You don't\nhave the expense, nonetheless you have the deduction?\nAny -- I mean, there are a whole list of deductions,\nexpenses. Is there any other one that works this way?\nIt doesn't matter whether you have the expense, in fact.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: For example, Mr. Burke, what\nwould happen if you didn't actually have any\nout-of-pocket medical costs? Could you still claim a\ndeduction for out-of-pocket medical costs?\nMR. BURKE: I'm saying you get all the\ndeductions, whether you owe on it or not. Is there a\nspecific one besides the car ownership that says you\nhave to owe on it? No. But my point is -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is that the general view\nof the courts? Is the answer that you just gave\nsupported uniformly by the courts that have looked at\nthis?\nMR. BURKE: There's about 60 published\ncases. They are split almost 50-50, actually more -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Even -- in other words,\neven on this point, they are split?\nMR. BURKE: This is one line that they have\nlooked at in the cases. Basically -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand what\nyou're saying. He asked, are they split 50-50 on the\npoint that is before us here? Yes or no?\nMR. BURKE: Yes, they're about 50-50.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do they apply -- do the\ncourts apply the housing and utilities listed amount\nwhether or not you pay for a house or not, whether or\nnot you rent?\nMR. BURKE: There's two published cases I'm\naware of, and both allowed it. One, somebody had\nmilitary housing; one, the house was paid off. Both\ncourts said you get it under the local standards. But\nthe IRS manual would not give that to you, because under\nthe local standards the IRS manual says you get the\nspecific amount or your actual payment, whatever is\nless.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, once again, Mr.\nBurke, this is -- I don't know why you don't point this\nout. This is not the difference between your position\nand the position of the other side. You get the\ndeduction for the other side as well, whether or not you\nare making the payment. Now, maybe it can be adjusted\nby the trustee, but as far as the statute is concerned,\nso long as you make one payment of $1, under their\ntheory you're entitled to claim the deduction; isn't\nthat right?\nMR. BURKE: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: My question, incidentally,\nabout courts was not with reference to the car expense.\nIt was with reference to the hypothetical or to the\nissue proposed by one of my colleagues, that said, what\nif you don't -- Justice Kagan -- suppose you don't have\nthe medical expense. And the answer -- and your -- and\nI wanted to know if your answer is supported uniformly\nby the courts that have looked at this, or if there is\nalso a split on that point?\nMR. BURKE: I apologize for not\nunderstanding it. No, every other expense deduction\nthat I have seen besides the car ownership, somebody\ngets it.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And they get it\nwhether or not they incur that expense or not?\nMR. BURKE: Correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In other words,\nfood -- you don't have to say, well, he did spend this\nmuch money on food, so he gets the standard deduction.\nMR. BURKE: Correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If he doesn't eat as\nmuch as somebody else, he gets the same deduction,\nright?\nMR. BURKE: Correct. Or if he lives at home\nand mom cooks for him.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Burke, even you\nwould say -- is this correct -- that if you don't own a\ncar at all, you can't claim the car costs?\nMR. BURKE: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is that -- is that by\nreason of the Internal Revenue Service -\nMR. BURKE: No.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- manual, or is it by\nreason of the Bankruptcy Code itself?\nMR. BURKE: It's by reason of the Bankruptcy\nCode that refers to the standards, and the standards\nspecifically say you have one car, no cars, and you get\na public transportation, or two cars; pick the one.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So it's in the chart -\nMR. BURKE: It's in the chart.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that you claim -- okay.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What if you own a car, but\nit's completely inoperable and it has no value? You buy\nit for a dollar. It's a junk car, and you're planning\npossibly to restore it at some point. Do you get the\ndeduction then?\nMR. BURKE: Based on a strict reading of the\ncode, you get it.\nNow, would the IRS allow it? Again, that's\na discretionary standard, but any time you have an\nobjective test, there's going to be line-drawing and\nperceived unfairness on the outskirts.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And would your answer be\nthe same if the allowance was set, the decree was made,\nand -- and the debtor then went out and bought the\njunker to put in his driveway just in order to get the\n400-plus dollars a month, or would that be deemed an\nevasion of the law that could be addressed by the\nBankruptcy Court?\nMR. BURKE: It can addressed by the\nBankruptcy Court, and that's the beauty of the statute.\nWe don't need to go into the Internal Revenue Manual.\nWe just need their tables, because there's a provision,\n1325(a)(3), that deals with good faith. So if it\nappears somebody is not acting in good faith, then -\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is -- we've got about\nhalf the courts in the country agreeing with you. And\nso you've read all those arguments, and what in your\nopinion is the best one on the point, again, where I am\nstuck, which is Justice Ginsburg's original point? I\nmean, I can think of millions of examples. You have a\nform that says -- the employer says entertainment\nexpenses. Then it defines entertainment expenses as\nfood and transport, and they leave out movies, you know.\nOr you could have vacation expenses, and vacation\nexpenses are defined as transport and hotel, and they\nleave out meals. And here we have a definition of\nownership expenses, and they say leasing and loaning,\nand they leave out other forms of ownership.\nMR. BURKE: Because -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, the argument is, well,\nthat's what they mean by it, so that's what applicable.\nNow, what's the best argument against that in those\n50 cases? Why is it trying -- why to try to get an\nexpense which isn't loan or lease? Have you any more\nright to it than if you tried to get an expense to my\ntotally irrelevant apples? I mean, it doesn't fit\nwithin the applicable definition. What's the answer?\nMR. BURKE: The means test is a form, and if\nyou look at the form -- the means test is a form.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I've looked at the form.\nMR. BURKE: If you look at the form -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. BURKE: It just says -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Ownership.\nMR. BURKE: That's it. There's no\ndefinition in the form.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But they -- two pages\nearlier they say what they mean by the word \"ownership.\"\nMR. BURKE: Not the -- the IRM does.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. BURKE: Not the statute and not the B22\nform that's filled out by debtors.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You say half the courts\nsay, oh, you just sort of imagine what ownership\nexpenses are, and anything that they can fall within\nthat general English language word is what they can\ndeduct; is that their approach? Because we -- you say\ncut off the definition, cut off the definition from the\nword \"ownership\"; don't use it. So what do we use to\ndefine what ownership is?\nMR. BURKE: We don't have to. Congress gave\nstandard amounts for -\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, I know, but it's for\nownership; it's not for, for example, whistling. It's\nfor ownership. So -- so how do we define what that $471\nattaches to? Do we use a State common law definition or\nsomething? How have they done it?\nMR. BURKE: Because you can take it as a\nbunch of variables. It's not in the Bankruptcy Code.\nIf -- so it could be replacement costs; it could be\nmajor repairs; it could be -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is this a problem\ndistinctive to your case? Doesn't the other side have\nthe same problem with ownership? Don't they acknowledge\nthat even if you are leasing the car you get the\ndeduction?\nMR. BURKE: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't see why this is\ndistinctive to your case. It's a problem both sides\nface. And we don't avoid it by coming out against you,\ndo we?\nMR. BURKE: No, we don't.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why?\nJUSTICE ALITO: What if -- what if the\ndefinition of -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why don't we?\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- ownership costs was moved\ninto the local standards themselves? Would the outcome\nbe different then?\nMR. BURKE: Are you saying in 707(b)?\nJUSTICE ALITO: No. It's moved from the CFS\nto the local standards, which are referred to in the -\nin the code provision.\nMR. BURKE: My answer would still be the\nsame because that's not a congressional formula. That's\na form that comes off the Department of Justice Website\nwhich administers the U.S. Trustee's program and that's\ntheir litigation position.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Burke, if the table\nsaid loan and lease costs, you wouldn't have a case? If\nit said -- instead of ownership costs, if it said loan\nand lease costs, then you would sit down and you would\nsay I'm not entitled to that deduction?\nMR. BURKE: No. I would say an individual\nwho owns a car, whether they owe or not, gets the\ndeduction because it's part of this aggregate standard.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Even if it's called loan and\nlease costs?\nMR. BURKE: Correct. It's not a breakdown\non what any one individual has. It's an aggregate.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You may want to save the\nrest of your time for rebuttal.\nMR. BURKE: Thank you. I will.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMs. Maynard.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DEANNE E. MAYNARD\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. MAYNARD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Bankruptcy Code precludes an above\nmedian-income debtor like Petitioner from shielding from\nhis creditors $471 a month for a car payment that he\ndoes not have. A debtor with -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- food costs, housing\ncosts, utility costs, by getting his parents to pay for\nthose things and still take this deduction?\nMS. MAYNARD: The statute allows a debtor to\ntake an applicable monthly expense amount. So if the\ndebtor truly has no food costs, then the food standard\nwould be not applicable to the debtor, so -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Your adversary said that\nonly two courts have addressed this issue and have\npermitted those deductions. So under what reasoning\nwould we apply a different standard to the car costs as\nopposed to those other costs?\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, I think, with respect -\nI think the cases he was talking about were housing.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Housing.\nMS. MAYNARD: Right. So housing and car\ncosts are part of the local standards. Food, clothing,\nhouse cleaning supplies, those are part of the national\nstandards. The -- in our view, the text that goes along\nwith -- accompanies the tables, which is not the\nInternal Revenue Manual -- it's just the pages reprinted\nat 1a to 3a of our brief. The Collection Financial\nStandards, the prefatory explanation for what the tables\nmean. In our view, that is -- goes along with -\nincorporated into the national local standards.\nThe national standards, Justice Sotomayor,\nare allowed, as long as you have under the calculations\n-- as explained in the standards, under the national\nstandards, a debtor would receive the allowance in the\ntable as long as they have any such expense, so\nregardless of amount. However, if they have no such\nexpense, then they are taken out by the statutory\nlanguage in the means test, which says that the standard\nmust be applicable to the debtor. And -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if they have\npre-purchased their food expenses, so long as they have\n$1 of food expense they get the entire expense even\nthough they're not incurring it?\nMS. MAYNARD: If they are -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And there are things\nlike, you can pay up, you know, have the grocery deliver\nyour food every month and you can pay in advance, and if\nyou're paid up, you still get the full food expense that\nis allowed?\nMS. MAYNARD: No, Your Honor. I think if,\nover the 60-month period looking forward, you know, that\nyou're going to -- you've already paid up for your food\nfor the next 60 months and you're not going to incur any\nadditional food expenses, no, then in that situation the\nstandard would be inapplicable to you. You would be\nhaving no -- in that hypothetical -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But if you paid $1\nfor food, you'd get the full amount for 60 months?\nMS. MAYNARD: Under the standard. That's\nthe way the standards operate, Your Honor.\nI haven't seen any cases litigated over food\nexpense -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your argument\nleads to a result that's just as absurd as your\ncolleague's result on the other side.\nMS. MAYNARD: I don't believe so, Your\nHonor -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, that was a\nbig part of your argument. You said his position leads\nto an absurd result, and yours is just as absurd.\nMS. MAYNARD: I don't think so, Your Honor,\nfor this reason, which is that the national standards\nare food, clothing, house cleaning supplies, things that\nyou expect every debtor to have. You don't see much\nlitigation about those expenses. The local standards,\nhowever, operate differently. In our view -- and our\nview's different from the government's, Justice Scalia.\nIn our view, under the local standards and the way that\nthey apply as explained in the Collection Financial\nStandards, is that the debtor is allowed their actual\nexpense for the local standard or the amount in the\ntable, whichever is less. So in the hypothetical -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Where does it say that?\nMS. MAYNARD: In our -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The debtor's monthly\nexpenses shall be the debtor's applicable monthly\nexpense amounts specified under the national and local\nstandards. So the national and local standards have\namounts listed. Where does it say you take only the\nactual, not the national or local standard?\nMS. MAYNARD: I read that text, Your\nHonor -- again, the Court doesn't need to decide this\nmaximum cap issue to decide this case, because the\nPetitioner has no expense whatsoever, and so it's not\napplicable to him.\nBut in our view, Justice Sotomayor -- in our\nview, you get it from the language of the statute that\nsays the debtor's applicable monthly expense amounts\nspecified under the national standards and local\nstandards. And the way that we understand the national\nand local standards to work is, if you look at page -\nit's explained on page 1a of the petition to our brief,\nthe red brief. Maximum allowance -- it's the third\nparagraph down: \"Maximum allowances for housing and\nutilities and transportation, known as the Local\nStandards, vary by location. Unlike the National\nStandards, the taxpayer is allowed the amount actually\nspent or the standard, whichever is less.\"\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that's -- but that's\nnot what the provision at issue here says. It says you\nuse the amount specified under the national standards,\nand you use actual for everything else. That's what the\nstatute said. So now you're trying to move the actual\ninto the first half of the text?\nMS. MAYNARD: No, Your Honor, that's not how\nI understand the text. The text provides -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why would you even\nbother? Why don't you -- if -- if what you're arguing\nis that only actual expenses are -- are what you can\nclaim, you wouldn't need the first half.\nMS. MAYNARD: Yes, you would, Your Honor,\nbecause what the -- what the statute's purpose here is\n-- I mean, I think it's helpful to step back.\nChapter 13 sends one to chapter 7's means\ntest for the purpose of calculating the amounts\nreasonably necessary for the maintenance and support of\nthe debtor. And Congress chose to import the -- the\nmethodology of the national standards and local\nstandards as a way both to set the categories of\nexpenses that debtors could receive payments for, and,\nwith the case of the national and local standards, to\nset the amounts. They were worried about capping upper\ndiscretion because Congress -- it's quite clear from the\ntext and the legislative history -- was concerned about\nabove-median-income debtors taking luxurious expense\namounts.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what you would have\nthe statute read is: The debtor's monthly expenses\nshall be the debtor's applicable monthly expense amounts\nspecified, as a -- as a maximum. You would have to add\n\"maximum\" somewhere there.\nMS. MAYNARD: No, Your Honor, because the\namount under the national standards, as the national\nstandards operate, is the -- is an allowance, not an\nactual, and the amount under the local standards, as\nthey operate, is the amount actually spent or the amount\nin the table, whichever is less. And, again -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your -- your\nposition penalizes debtors who pay their expenses in\nadvance, who don't incur additional debt to pay for\nthings like their car. I would have thought the\nBankruptcy Code would think that's a good thing, that\nthey're not incurring debt that they can't afford to pay\noff, but instead, to the extent they can, they're paying\nexpenses in advance. Why should somebody who does that\nbe in a worse position than somebody -- than somebody\nwho takes out a loan they can't afford to pay back?\nMS. MAYNARD: Money is fungible, Your Honor,\nso to the extent the debtor has incurred expenses before\ngoing into bankruptcy instead of, as here, paying off\nthis more than $85,000 in credit card debt, shouldn't be\nable to -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, he hasn't\nincurred -- he hasn't incurred expenses. It's the whole\npoint, I guess, that he's paid for something.\nMS. MAYNARD: He used his money, perhaps, to\npurchase his car outright, instead of to pay down his\ncredit card debt, and so he has a salary of $50,000, and\nhe has a credit card debt of $85,000, and he owns a\n2-year car -- 2-year-old car outright. He should not be\nable to deduct, as a measure of his reasonably necessary\nexpenses for his maintenance and support over the next\n50 months, $28,000 that he doesn't need for a car\npayment that he doesn't make.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You're -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even though he can\ndo it -- even though he can do it for everything else -\nhe can do it for food, he can do it for housekeeping\nexpenses, he can do it for personal care expenses, he\ncan even do it -- the other, the final category is\nmiscellaneous, so he can do it for anything.\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, the miscellaneous, all\nthose numbers are capped, and the legislative history\nmakes clear Congress thought all those numbers would\nactually effectively act as caps. In other words, to\nthe extent there was debate in the Congress, Congress\nwas concerned that these numbers were actually too low,\nnot that they were going to give anybody a windfall.\nBut to the extent -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what you're proposing\nis that every debtor has to go to the Bankruptcy Court\nand show what their monthly food bills have been over\nwhat period of time, how much their personal supplies\nhave been over what period of time? How can you\ncalculate forward what they are going to spend on a\nmonthly basis for each of those items? Isn't that the\nreason the tables are used, so that you don't have to do\nthat?\nMS. MAYNARD: Yes, Your Honor, and in the\nnational standards, which all the items you just list\nare national standards, under the national standards you\ndon't do the actuals. On page 1a, it explains:\n\"Allowances for food, clothing and other items, known as\nthe National Standards, apply nationwide except for\nAlaska and Hawaii.... Taxpayers are allowed the total\nNational Standards amount for their family size and\nincome level, without questioning amounts actually\nspent.\"\nFor -- yes, for those hard-to-calculate\nitems, you do -- our position is you do get the amounts\nin the chart. For local standards -- the local\nstandards, however, which include home, mortgage, lease\nexpenses, utilities, and transportation, which include\nboth ownership costs and operating costs, you get the\nactual or whichever is less.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I must say your position is\nmore logical than the position that you read in some of\nthe instructions applicable to the -- to the chart\nthat's referred to in the Bankruptcy Code, but not\nothers. I mean, it seems to me, if you're going to read\nin the requirement that have to have made a lease\npayment, you should also read in the requirement that\nyou're referring to now, which would mean your deduction\nis limited by the -- by the amount of your lease\npayment.\nI don't see why -- is there any reason why\none would read in the other one and not read in yours?\nMS. MAYNARD: Not in our view, Your Honor,\nbecause in our view the chart is -- is ambiguous about\nwhat the number stands for. And so in the national\nstandards, the text, the prefatory text, explains that\nthe amount is an allowance if you have the expense. In\nthe local standards, the prefatory text explains that\nthe amount operates as a cap.\nBut the important point for this case, Your\nHonor, is that you don't have to decide anything about\nthe national standards because Petitioner is left at the\nstatutory door. He has no applicable monthly expense\namount for operating -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Maynard, what would\nhappen if the debtor had a car that was 200,000 miles\nold -- 200,000 miles, and it was going to break down,\nyou know, within the next 5 years? Would the debtor\nthen be able to take the deduction?\nMS. MAYNARD: If the debtor owns the car\noutright at the time they file for bankruptcy, they\nwould not get the deduction.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Even though if you look\nahead, if you project forward, it's pretty clear that\nthe debtor is going to have to incur those expenses?\nMS. MAYNARD: They would not get the\ndeduction under this calculation. However, under this\nCourt's decision in Lanning, when one goes to project\nthe disposable income, it's conceivable that the debtor\ncould prove that it's known or virtually certain that\nthey will need a new car and that that could be\naccounted for.\nBut -- but also the Bankruptcy Code in 1329\nallows for modification of a plan, and so when the time\narises that their car conks out and they need a new car,\nthey can move to modify their plan. I think it's -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, the modification works\nfor chapter 13, but it doesn't work for chapter 7; is\nthat right?\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, they make that statement\nin their reply brief, Your Honor, but I'm not sure\nexactly what they mean by that, because in chapter 7\nthis test is being used for a very different purpose.\nIt's the gateway; it's a presumptive test for abuse.\nAnd so, again, our reading makes perfect sense in that\ncontext because what you want to know is, does this\ndebtor actually have moneys it can prepay its creditors,\nshould it be -\nJUSTICE BREYER: The -- sorry. Are you\nfinished?\nMS. MAYNARD: I was -- I actually haven't\nanswered her question.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Go ahead.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why don't you finish\nanswering the question?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Finish, yes.\nMS. MAYNARD: So, in chapter 7, once you -\nif you decide it's presumptively --- not presumptively\nabusive, and you stay in chapter 7, then chapter 7 is a\nliquidation. There's no ongoing plan. So I -- all of\nyour nonexempt assets are liquidated, your creditors are\npaid off, and then you are discharged. If 3 years from\nnow your car conks out, you're just like you and me; you\nare not in bankruptcy, you just -- you try to make do.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I think it is -- well, I'm\ntrying to work out what was his point. And I don't\nblame him for this. But trying to figure it out, he\nsays look: This whole thing was written for a different\npurpose than the IRS, and if we start reading all those\nthings from the beginning into the tables, we're really\ngoing to get into a mess. For example, we are going to\ngive people deductions when they have lease payments,\neven though they're not owners when they have lease\npayments. The company owns -- not even an ownership\nexpense, but it does say use the lease payment. And\nthen it has all these other things.\nSo forget it; do a simple thing. It says\nownership expense. You go to the registry of motor\nvehicles and you say, is Smith the owner? And they'll\ntell you, yes or no. And if the answer is yes, he\ndeducts $471. Sometimes that's too little; sometimes\nthat's too much. But once we depart from that, we're\nreally in a nightmare of trying to figure out what all\nthese things mean that were written for other purposes.\nSo, what do you say to that?\nMS. MAYNARD: I say, Justice Breyer, that\nthere's nothing in the statute or the legislative\nhistory that suggests this was meant to be an overall\nbudget for above-median-income debtors. This was about\ncapping upper discretion and limiting the expenses\navailable as reasonably necessary expenses for\nabove-median-income debtors.\nAnd I think that point is made perfectly\nclear by the fact that if you can compare it to what\nhappens now to a below-median-income debtor, a\nbelow-median-income debtor in the same situation as\nPetitioner, who owns his car outright, would be allowed\nno amount as an expense for his vehicle, because he\ndoesn't have an actual expense that's reasonably\nnecessary.\nAnd I think that the 2005 Congress would\nthink it was a senseless result, as they argue here,\nthat Petitioner gets $471, above-median-income debtor,\nthe very class of debtors with whom Congress was\nconcerned in the 2005 amendments, to shield from his\ncreditors over the life of the plan when he has no\ncomparable expense.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think that -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What we are talking about\nis a paradigm of someone -- we're comparing someone who\nhas a $470-a-month car payment and he gets -- and he\ngets the deduction. Why is that, in light of the second\nsentence -- let's see, the third sentence of the\nstatute, which says, \"Notwithstanding any other\nprovision of this clause, the monthly expenses of the\ndebtor shall not include any payments for debts.\" I\nmean, that would be the car company.\nAnd has -- has that point been litigated?\nMS. MAYNARD: That -- that sentence is\nsomewhat of a conundrum, Your Honor, and I think that\nthe Court doesn't need to decide the meaning here,\nbecause whatever it does, it doesn't get Petitioner\nwithin the Romanette ii calculation -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No -- no, but it would -\nMS. MAYNARD: -- because he has no payment.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It would eliminate the\nanomaly that -- one of the principal anomalies. There\nare many anomalies in each position. It would eliminate\none of the principal asymmetries that seems to concern\nthe counsel and the Court.\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, my understanding of that\nprovision is that it serves two purposes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That it?\nMS. MAYNARD: Serves two purposes. The\nfirst is that it makes clear -- in the back of our\nbrief, we have the other necessary expenses from the\nIRM. And on -- near the back, page 25a, two of the\ncategories of other necessary expenses are secured or\nlegally perfected debts and unsecured debts.\nSo I think the -- the otherwise -- the\n\"notwithstanding\" sentence makes clear that Romanette ii\nshould not capture those other unsecured debts and\nsecured debts, that it's the very purpose of this whole\ncalculation to figure out how much money you have to pay\nthose things.\nThe second purpose the sentence serves is to\nmake sure that there is no double-counting, because\nRomanette iii, the very next provision in the means\ntest, allows the debtor to claim monthly payments for\nsecured debts. Now, many car loans are probably secured\ndebts, and in our view if you actually have a car loan\n-- now, remember again, he neither has a car loan, nor a\ncar lease payment, nor any kind of ownership payment.\nBut if -- if one actually did have a car\nloan that was secured by the car, which I think is the\nvast majority of car loans, in our view the debtor\nexpenses nothing for that under Romanette ii, and only\nthe actual amount of that debt under Romanette iii.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the -- the\ngeneral position was you get either the actual payment\nor the 471, of whichever is higher.\nMS. MAYNARD: Whichever is less.\nI think that -- that's my understanding of\nhow the local standards work, Your Honor. I think,\nthen, as a practical matter, that really will end up\nonly applying to car leases with respect to\ntransportation ownership costs, because I think that the\n\"notwithstanding\" sentence removes secured car loans\nfrom Romanette ii and has them calculated under\nRomanette iii, where there is no comparable cap.\nAnd the -- but -- but the point at issue in\nthis case doesn't involve the interaction between\nRomanette ii and Romanette iii, because no matter how\nthose two things interact, when the debtor has no\npayment whatsoever, he ought not to be able to claim any\ncar ownership costs, because what we're trying to figure\nout is what amounts does he reasonably need for his\nmaintenance and support? And this question is a very\nimportant question. This scenario happens a lot.\nIn the 2007 study that U.S. Trustees did is\n-- at Congress's request to which Petitioner cites in\nhis reply brief, the average overpayment of a debtor in\nclaiming this transportation ownership expense was $335,\nwhich is a lot when you're talking about the standard in\nthe chart being 471. There are many debtors who are\ngetting this expense either above their amount or when\nthey have no such expense at all, and so even if the\nCourt doesn't resolve these other issues that are\nimplicated by this case, the decision here is a simple\none, which is: This debtor has no applicable monthly\nexpense amount for transportation ownership costs, and\nhe shouldn't be allowed to expense any amount for that.\nIf there are no further questions, the\nRespondent requests the Court would affirm the judgment\nbelow.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMs. Saharsky.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE A. SAHARSKY,\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING RESPONDENT\nMS. SAHARSKY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe only question this Court needs to\nresolve in this case is whether the vehicle ownership\nexpense is applicable to Petitioner. The answer is no.\nThe ownership cost is for loan and lease\npayments, the cost to acquiring the vehicle, and he just\ndoesn't have any payments of that type. To allow him to\npretend that he does would create absurd results. He'd\nbe able to shield approximately $28,000 from his\nunsecured creditors, and he'd be better off than lower\nincome chapter 13 debtors. And we just don't think that\nthat's a result that Congress intended. We don't think\nit -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And if he paid -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- excuse me,\nChief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If he paid a dollar,\nhe would be able to shield $27,999, and you're\ncomfortable with that result?\nMS. SAHARSKY: Well, that goes to the\nquestion of whether the amount in the table is the\namount to be used or a cap on actual expenses. In our\nview, it is -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And I understood\nyour brief to say it was the amount -- you get the whole\namount, not simply as a cap.\nMS. SAHARSKY: That's right. Now, of\ncourse, we haven't seen -- the executive office for\nU.S. Trustees has not seen any $1 payments. It doesn't\nknow of any such commercially available payments. It\nsuspects the payments would be -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If the point of the\n$1, counsel, is to lead to the extreme hypothetical that\nwould flesh out your position, what if it were $10,000\nand the amount would give him $30,000? The trustees\nhave probably seen loans like that.\nMS. SAHARSKY: What I'm saying, Your Honor,\nis that there are many circumstances in which an expense\namount is a standard amount, but you still need to make\na threshold showing that it's applicable to you.\nAnd if I could give the Court one example:\nWhen an individual does his Federal income tax forms,\nyou can take a deduction for your dependents, but you\ncan't just take a deduction for any child you have. You\nhave to take a deduction -- you can take a deduction if\nthe person lives at home with you for more than 1 year\nand have you a certain amount of expenses to support\nthem, and that is a standard deduction that you get on\nyour tax forms. The IRS doesn't ask everyone to figure\nout their actual costs.\nIt is the case in real life that there are\nallowance amounts that are average amounts that are\ngiven to people once they meet the criteria. And that's\nwhat we are saying happens here.\nNow, that is, again, only a disagreement as\nto what you do with people who actually have vehicle\nownership expenses.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why aren't -- why isn't one\nof the criteria the -- the provision that says maximum\nallowances for housing and utilities and transportation,\nknown as the local standards, vary by location, and\nunlike the national standards, the taxpayer is allowed\nthe amount actually spent or the standard, whichever is\nless? Why doesn't that apply?\nMS. SAHARSKY: Well, because, Your Honor, in\nthat case it's the IRS commentary we are referring to\nthat's on page 1a of the red brief appendix.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMS. SAHARSKY: And that -- what that's\nreferring to is -- it says the amount actually spent or\nthe standard. And that's distinguishing between the\namount that's actually spent or the standard, which is\nthe standard -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMS. SAHARSKY: -- amount in the table.\nRight.\nAnd of course, we look to what -- the text\nthat Congress enacted in the Bankruptcy Code, and that\nsays that the debtor's monthly expenses shall be the\ndebtor's applicable monthly expense amounts specified\nunder the national standards and local standards.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's not applicable. It's\nnot applicable if, in fact, you haven't spent that much.\nJust as you claim it's not applicable if you have no\npayment at all.\nMS. SAHARSKY: I think that it is -- it\nwould further Congress's purposes to say that you\nhave to -- that you look to the actual costs that the\ndebtor has. But we just don't think the text goes that\nfar, because it says that if the expense amounts -- the\ncategory is applicable to the debtor, that then you use\nthe expense amounts specified under the table. But -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, but the -- but the\ngravamen of Justice Scalia's question is: Why are you\nrunning away from 1a, which is what Respondent's counsel\nrelied on? And if that were clearly relevant to this\nstatute, it would seem to me to answer the question.\nAre you saying we -- we don't look at this\nbecause it's just simply an interpretation; it's not a\nregulation? What is -- what is -- in your view, what\neffect do we give to this language that Justice Scalia\nquoted? Nothing at all?\nMS. SAHARSKY: It would not be relevant in\nthe bankruptcy context, in our view, and the reason is\nbecause the -- the statutory text refers to the\nstandards. And in our view, you can look to the IRS\ncommentary to see what the standards mean, what their\nscope is, as Justice Breyer was discussing with his\napples hypothetical.\nBut this additional language is guidance to\nIRS agents in tax delinquency cases about how to collect\ntaxes. As Petitioners -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose we -- suppose we\nthink the word \"applicable\" is ambiguous and difficult\nto construe. Do we then look at this language at 1a, or\ndo you say it's irrelevant in all instance -- in all\nrespects?\nMS. SAHARSKY: You -- Your Honor, you could\nlook at this language, but we think that it reflects not\nthe standards, but what -- how the IRS uses the\nstandards in individual cases of tax delinquency.\nTo the extent that the IRS is defining what\nthe standards are, what the scope of the standards are\n-- for example, that ownership costs are loan and lease\npayments -- of course, we would think that you would\nlook to that, but this additional guidance to IRS agents\nwe don't think is what Congress meant when it said\n\"expense amounts specified under the standards.\"\nBut we do think that the text could be read\nthe way you suggest.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So then you would be\ncomfortable with a person who owns a house outright, who\nonly pays $100 in utilities, taking the full amount of\nthe housing and utilities allowable living expenses\nbecause that's the amount specified?\nMS. SAHARSKY: Well, the housing and\nutilities expenses have been broken out into a mortgage\nand rent component and a utilities component. So in\nthat circumstance, we would say the individual only is\nallowed the utilities component, but it would be the\nallowance amount that is specified. It would not be his\nactual amount.\nBut, again, this is a question that was not\nconsidered by the courts below. In fact, the bankruptcy\nappellate panel said it is -- in footnote 20 of its\nbrief, said this question is not in this case; it's not\nbefore us whether you use the amounts in the table or\nwhether you use the actual amounts. And we don't think\n-\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Saharsky, I\nshould -- I should probably know this, but if you do\nhave amounts that are excluded from the disposable\nincome because of car ownership, in other words, you\nactually have, from -- in your point of view, expenses,\ndo they have to go to the -- pay off the car loan or are\nthey available for everybody? All the creditors?\nMS. SAHARSKY: They're not available for the\ncreditors. The idea behind this calculation is that\nthere, of course, are secured debts that have priority,\nand then this calculation is used to figure out how much\nmoney is left to pay unsecured creditors. And the idea\nis that the debtor has certain expenses, that he needs\nto keep money for himself so he can continue with the\neveryday business of life. For example, the car\nownership payment is designed to ensure that a vehicle\ncan still use and have access to a car, and if someone\nhas a loan or lease payment, they need to be able to\ncontinue making that payment in bankruptcy, but if they\ndon't have any such payment, then they don't have this\nneed for this additional fund because -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But can he decide -\nlet's say he has more food expense than is allowed. Can\nhe decide of the amount that would otherwise go for the\ncar payment that he's going to pay some of that for the\nfood expenses?\nMS. SAHARSKY: Well, certainly the\nBankruptcy Court doesn't scrutinize, you know, what\nhappens to that regard. What it's just trying to do is\nfigure out the disposable income that is available to\npay unsecured creditors, that the debtor doesn't need.\nAnd I should just note with respect to this\nquestion of whether there is an overall budget that the\ndebtor is allowed, you know, that's certainly not the\ncase in any of the other provisions that follow this\napplicable monthly standards and local standards. You\nhave the actual other necessary expenses, actual\ncontinuation of taking care of chronically ill family\nmembers. And Petitioner himself acknowledges that he\nhas to show that he has a car. So it's not the case\nthat every debtor is just getting some set amount of\nmoney to do what they will with. Congress has\nreferenced the standards. The standards break this out\ninto certain expenses. It says just take the applicable\nones. And we just don't think it makes sense to\ninterpret \"applicable\" in that circumstance to -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Saharsky, could you\nexplain to me the government's position on when a debtor\nwith loan and lease payments gets to deduct them under\nRomanette ii? In other words, this goes back to Justice\nKennedy's question, the notwithstanding clause and\nwhether the notwithstanding clause effectively excludes\nall loan and lease payments from Romanette ii?\nMS. SAHARSKY: It does not have that effect,\nYour Honor. What it does is to take out the actual debt\npayments that are part of the other necessary\nexpenses -- these are on page 25a of the red brief -\nthat counsel on our side mentioned. These are other\nnecessary expenses that are actual debt payments, and\nthe local and national standards are expense amounts.\nWe don't think that Congress defined those to be debt\npayments.\nSo the function of the payments for debts\nlanguage, we agree with Respondent's counsel, would be\ntwofold. First, it would excise the other necessary\nexpenses that actually are debt payments, which makes\ncomplete sense. You know, one of them is an unsecured\ndebt payment, and you wouldn't want to consider that one\nof your expenses because the whole point of the\ncalculation is to figure out how much money you have\nleft to pay unsecured debts. And then the other\nfunction that it serves is in Romanette iii because you\nwere getting secured debt payments there to not\ndouble-count them in Romanette ii.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But, in other words, the\nloan and lease payments don't count as debt for purposes\nof the notwithstanding clause; they count as expense\namounts?\nMS. SAHARSKY: We say that those are expense\namounts that are specified. They're not payments for\ndebts. I should note, because Justice Kennedy asked\nthis question, that this was not something that was\nrelied upon by the courts below. I don't believe that\nthere's any definitive court of appeals opinion that\ngoes through in detail what that provision is designed\nto do. So I would urge this Court that it need not\nresolve it in this case and instead do what the court of\nappeals did, which is to say that, just looking at the\nplain text, the word \"applicable\" means not everybody\ncan get these amounts in the national and local\nstandards, and it needs to be someone who actually has\nthose payment amounts. The whole point of this part of\nthis statute is to figure out what money is available to\npay unsecured creditors, and it's payments that need to\nbe made for expenses that matter. It's not whether the\nindividual debtor has a car.\nI also note, just because it came up earlier\nand is a very important point, that to the extent that\nthe Court only wants to look at the tables to figure out\nwhat are ownership costs, are they loan and lease\npayments, just looking at the title of the table,\nOwnership Costs, you need to have costs. Looking at the\nfact that there are two different ones -- there's\nownership costs as opposed to operating costs -- makes\nclear that some of the things that Petitioner suggests\nmight be ownership costs are, in fact, operating costs.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Burke, have you 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER P. BURKE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BURKE: Thank you.\nThe means test knows when to say \"actual\"\nwhen it wants to say \"actual.\" It didn't say \"actual\"\nin this case; it said \"applicable.\"\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Burke, would you\nexplain one facet of this case to me? Given the\ndeduction, the $471 deduction, disposable -- projected\ndisposable income comes down to $210?\nMR. BURKE: Correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: As opposed to -- it would\nbe 600 some dollars if you didn't count the $471?\nMR. BURKE: Correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Even though the\ndisposable income figure was $210, the debtor was\nwilling -- the debtor proposed paying $500. Why did the\ndebtor come up with a $500 figure when projected\ndisposable income without the car ownership would be -\nif he gets the car ownership, would only be $210?\nMR. BURKE: This is exactly why our view of\nthe law works. The means test is a minimum amount.\nIt's a bottom-line quick figure based on standard\ndeductions. It was $200 based on our calculation if\nhe's given his deductions based on age, location, et\ncetera.\nWe then go back to I and J, and J, which is\non page 44 of the Joint Appendix, is his current\nexpenses. And if we look at line 13A, there is no\nvehicle payment. He's not taking $471. He took his\nincome and expense. The bottom line was 500. He knew\nhe had to pay at least 200. He's willing to pay the\n500. He's not getting a $471 deduction because there is\nno car payment on his Schedule J.\nAnd if we look at the formula that way, the\nmeans test is a general form to give standard\ndeductions, to give us a quick bottom line, and the\ndebtor is either going to pay that amount or more based\non his income and expense, and he would pay more if he\nreally didn't have that expense. So if he didn't have a\nrent expense of $1,000 a month, it would show up on\nSchedule J that he didn't have 1,000, so his payment\nwould go to $1,500 a month. That's the good faith\nthat's involved in this case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It would have to go to\n1,500 a month, or he, out of the goodness of his heart,\nwould decide to pay that amount?\nMR. BURKE: He's going to have to pay an\namount of at least $200.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. BURKE: It would be hard to confirm a\ncase if he doesn't pay somewhere in that range.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Fine. So why -- why would\nwe assume that he -- I don't know -- your client is an\nextraordinarily generous fellow. I don't think most\npeople, when they go through bankruptcy, are going to\ncough up any more than they have to.\nMR. BURKE: It's the only way for the form\nand the law to work. The means test is a bottom-line\nnumber. If you don't have one of those expenses, it\nshows up on Schedule J, and it gives you a number. If\nit's higher, we think you should probably pay it or in\nthat range. If it's lower, Congress isn't saying you\nget away with it; it says you get out of chapter 13 if\nyou're not going to pay this amount. So the formula is\njust to come up with a bottom line. Nobody is shielding\nanything. It's all black and white on his current\nexpenses. If he doesn't have it -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do you think that the -- do\nyou -\nMR. BURKE: -- he's not getting it.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do you think that the\nBankruptcy Code provision freezes the -- the national\nand local standards to some degree or completely as they\nexisted at the time when the statute was enacted?\nMR. BURKE: At the time the debtor files,\nthose numbers are frozen.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But the IRS can change -\notherwise, they can -- going forward, they can\ncompletely change the national and local standards?\nMR. BURKE: The numbers, but not the\nstructure. They can do anything they want when they're\ncollecting taxes, but the numbers -- and I think the\nnumbers change on an annual basis.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
