The United States.\nMr. Goodhart.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES F. GOODHART\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. GOODHART: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe issue is whether temporary flooding can\never constitute a taking under the Fifth Amendment. The\nFederal Circuit said, no, never, ruling that the\npermanent consequences of the Government's actions were\nnot relevant solely because its actions were not\npermanent.\nRespectfully, Your Honors, that cannot be\nthe rule. There are at least two reasons why.\nFirst, the United States must provide just\ncompensation when its direct physical invasion\nsubstantially intrudes upon a landowner's protected\nproperty interest, regardless of the particular mode or\nduration of that invasion.\nAnd, second, the Federal Circuit's decision\nconflicts with fundamental guarantees that the Takings\nClause is intended to preserve, and, therefore, is\nmanifestly unjust.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about this Court's\nprecedent in, what is it, the Sanguinetti case, where\nthe Court said that for there to be Government\nresponsibility it is at least necessary that the\noverflow constitute a permanent invasion of the land\namounting to an appropriation, not merely an injury, to\nproperty?\nWe would have to withdraw or modify that\nstatement, would we not, if you -- if your -- your\nargument prevails?\nMR. GOODHART: Justice Ginsburg, we would\nsay that you would not have to overrule Sanguinetti\nbecause the language there, \"permanent flooding\ninvasion,\" was -- was not how the case turned on the\nresult. The court there did make an inaccurate summary\nof the early flood-taking cases -- Pumpelly, Lynah, and\nKress. None of those cases said that flooding had to be\npermanent. The facts in those cases did have a\npermanent condition of flooding, but that was not made a\nrequirement. And none of those cases said that you\ncould not have temporary flood invasions.\nBut, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Was Sanguinetti -- had we\nhad any temporary takings cases before Sanguinetti?\nMR. GOODHART: Justice Scalia --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In other words, was\nSanguinetti expressing a special rule for flooding, or\nwas it -- was it simply saying there can't be a\ntemporary taking? If the latter, that dictum if it's\ndictum or a holding if it was a holding has already been\noverruled by our later temporary takings cases.\nMR. GOODHART: Justice Scalia, there --\nyou're correct. There was no temporary takings prior to\nSanguinetti. The Court there didn't have occasion to\naddress temporary flooding, whether that could\nconstitute a taking. And all of the cases after\nSanguinetti that have actually addressed whether a\ndirect temporary invasion will -- that substantially\nintrudes upon property interests have held that, yes,\nyou can have a temporary --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Which ones? Because I\ncounted eleven cases which either say, state, some seem\nto hold or support the proposition that when it's\ntemporary with a flood it's a trespass, and where it's\npermanent it's a taking. Okay?\nI mean, I have eleven. And so I've got from\nmy law clerk. And then I tried to see, well, what are\nthe ones that say the opposite? And so far we've come\nup with zero. All right?\nYou could argue that there were three cases\nduring the war which might be read that way, though they\ndon't quite mention it. All right?\nSo which of the cases that you -- rather\nthan list my eleven, I'm more interested in what you\nthink, and so I'd like to know which are the ones you\nthink support -- with something like a flood, which it's\nnot -- you're not physically taking hold of the whole\nthing. You're sending something in that comes back.\nWhich of the ones support you that temporary is not a\ntrespass, temporary is a taking?\nMR. GOODHART: Justice Breyer, in the\nDickinson case in 1947 where the Court found a taking\nfrom flooding, Mr. Dickinson reclaimed his property,\neffectively reclaimed most of the property that had\nflooded, effectively ending the flood invasion. And the\nCourt there said the taking was a taking when that\noccurred, regardless of whether the landowner does\nreclamation.\nOf course, this Court in the war seizure\ncases, in General Motors, Petty Motor, Pewee Coal,\nKimball Laundry, in all of those cases the Court has\nfound --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Dickinson -- I got written\ndown Dickinson.\nMR. GOODHART: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Kimball Laundry. Kimball\nLaundry was the -- laundry facilities.\nMR. GOODHART: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: They took the laundry\nfacilities for 3 years, but there what they did is they\nwent in and they took this building, you know, took the\nwhole thing.\nMR. GOODHART: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The problem with a flood is\nyou don't take all the land. You send some stuff in.\nAnd the stuff is there for a while, and then it comes\nback, and -- it's called water. And so I don't know\nwhat to make of the cases like Kimball Laundry where you\nactually appropriate the property. I suspect that they\nare not quite the same.\nAnything else? I got Dickinson. I've got\nKimball Laundry.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We have cases about flying\noverland -- -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, Causby.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- cases about shooting --\nshooting overland. Right?\nMR. GOODHART: Yes, Your Honor. The Causby\ncase --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's not water, but it\nain't taking, either, in the -- in the narrow sense that\nJustice Breyer has talked about.\nMR. GOODHART: Yes, Your Honor. The -- the\nUnited States flooded the air over the Causby's\nresidence and commercial chicken farm.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but in Causby, what\nthey did -- there was a question about whether just\nflying some airplanes over is a taking or a trespass.\nBut it went on for 25 years, so it was a long time.\nAnd, therefore, the permanency of it I don't think is at\nissue there.\nMR. GOODHART: Yes. Your Honor, in this\ncase, the court -- the Court of Federal Claims found\nthat these deviations resulted, in over 8 years, 6\nconsecutive years of recurring flood invasions during --\nduring the summertime, during unnatural time periods;\nand that the facts were more compelling than even in\nCausby with the -- the overflights or in Portsmouth\nHarbor with cannon shots flooding the air over\nPortsmouth Landing Harbor Hotel.\nThis -- these flood invasions happened each\nyear for specific sustained time periods. The United\nStates controlled the timing, the frequency, and the\nextent of the duration of these floods.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What if it hadn't harmed\nthe timber? I mean, you know, the damages claimed are a\nlot -- a lot of the timber that -- that would have been\nvaluable was -- was impaired by these floodings.\nSuppose there'd been no harm at all? Suppose it had\njust been for a certain period of time you were not able\nto use that land for anything? You couldn't plant\nanything on it. You couldn't picnic on it. You\ncouldn't do anything. Would that have been --\nnonetheless, despite the fact that there -- there was no\nharm done except -- except the flooding -- would that\nhave been a taking?\nMR. GOODHART: Your Honor, no. If -- there\nwould not have been a taking unless the landowner could\nshow substantial intrusion upon his protected property\nrights.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, he has. It's\nflooded. He can't --\nMR. GOODHART: If -- Your Honor, if he can\nshow that the -- he has the right to exclude\nsuperinduced invasions of water, that -- so it doesn't\ninterfere with his use and enjoyment. Here --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It does. He can't plow on\nit. He can't picnic on it. How does that not interfere\nwith his --\nMR. GOODHART: Well, and it very may well,\nYour Honor. And here, that -- there was that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So it would be a taking.\nAre you saying yes or no? What is it?\nMR. GOODHART: I'm saying, yes, if he can\nshow that it intruded on his use and enjoyment, and as\nyou said, indicated, that type of interference, yes. It\nwould be a -- it would be a substantial intrusion on his\nrights to use his property --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So that would cover a\none-time flood.\nMR. GOODHART: Not necessarily, Justice\nGinsburg. A one-time flood that is extensive, it could\nkill all the trees on this management area in one flood.\nHowever, one flood may not result in substantial\nintrusion on protected property rights. So it's going\nto depend on the facts, Your Honor, in the case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't understand that.\nYou said if -- if it's one flood, even though it\ndestroys the trees, and certainly would not make --\nwould make it impossible to have picnics, what -- so if\nthat's your position, then you're turning on it happened\nsix times, not once. Is that --\nMR. GOODHART: And, Your Honor, what I'm\nsaying, it's a proof of facts. The physical takings\nanalysis is the same. The legal analysis is the same.\nBut one flood could effectively destroy timber if it is\na lake; if it sits there. We didn't have that in our\ncase.\nWe had intrusion during 1993 to 2000, 8\nyears, 6 of which were substantially throughout the\nsummer where this management area sat in water during\nJune, July, into August, basically, stagnated water that\nchoked the oxygen from the roots of these trees. And in\n1999 it was termed a brownout. It was massive.\nOnce the timber inventory was done, it\nrevealed that there was over 100,000 trees in a\n6,990-acre area that were either destroyed or were --\nwere in the process of dying. And that didn't include\nthe other 11,000 acres that we subsequently inventoried.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, all of our\ncases in this temporary versus permanent, as I read the\ncases and I read what the multiple facts that each are\nrelying on, it seems to me that our cases have been\nattempting, in the term \"temporary,\" to encompass a lot\nof different concepts. Both intentionality, because an\naccidental issue is not a taking; causation: Did this\n-- and that's part of Sanguinetti's holding -- did what\nthe Government do actually and directly cause the injury\nat issue? And foreseeability: Is what you intended\nsomething whose consequences you could have seen?\nAnd they are using that in a multifaceted\ntest, one that the Solicitor General is not trying to\nendorse here, but one that I think is more consistent\nwith our general jurisprudence in this area.\nSo there is never a simple answer on the\nquestion of permanent damage, because you can have\npermanent damage that's not a taking, if all of the\nother factors I've just mentioned are not in your favor.\nIs that correct?\nMR. GOODHART: Yes, Your Honor, you're\ncorrect. The -- the invasion has to be direct by the\nUnited States.\nThe Court of Federal Claims found that --\nthat it was direct, natural, and probable -- the results\nwere -- from the Government's action.\nOne thing in water cases is you don't have\ndye in the water. Mr. Causby could look up and see the\ninsignia on the airplanes. And we knew that the cannon\nfire from the -- from the artillery was coming over the\nPortsmouth Harbor's land was from the Government. The\nwater, you can't always tell. And so you have to prove\nthat that was directly from the United States. And the\ncommission in this case did.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I guess the problem with\nthis case, and it's part of what's interwoven in your\nadversary's arguments, is that with flooding it's going\nto occur naturally anyway. The Government generally\nbuilds dams to control that flooding to the benefit of\nall of the interests along its affected route. And at\nsome point, either the Government is going to -- is\ngoing to make a decision that's going to help someone\nand potentially hurt someone. And the question is,\nisn't all of those situations going to be subject to\nlitigation.\nThe Government's rule -- I call it the\nGovernment's rule, but it's -- is basically simple. It\ncan't. Because, if the deviation is temporary -- and\nthat's what the circuit below said -- it's just\nexercise. It's either a nuisance or temporary trespass,\nand we're not going to hold the Government responsible\nfor that loss. Assuming it's going to occur in part\nbecause flooding is always going to occur, the question\nis perhaps when. But in any place you have a dam, it's\nthere because flooding was happening.\nIsn't that the basic argument? And I don't\nknow that you've actually announced the rule that\naddresses the essence of the policy considerations that\nare driving the Government decision. So tell me how\nyour rule makes this a manageable situation.\nMR. GOODHART: Your Honor, the -- the two\nelements of the rule, that there must be direct physical\ninvasion by the United States and not from some other\ncause, and there must be substantial intrusion upon\nthese protected property rights, the right to exclude,\nthe right to use and enjoy, and the right to dispose,\nthat --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that's every flood.\nMR. GOODHART: That runs throughout\nthis Court's --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that's every flood.\nMR. GOODHART: Yes, Your Honor, it is. But\nthe United States, when it does its flood control --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no, no, I don't\n-- why is that every flood? You go through your three\nfactors, you could have lots of flood that aren't a\nsubstantial intrusion. You know, you get an extra inch\nof water, and then it recedes. And it's -- you know --\nMR. GOODHART: That's --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- you get a note\nfrom the Corps of Engineers saying, we're sorry, it\nwon't happen again. That's not -- every flood is not --\nMR. GOODHART: Not -- you're correct,\nMr. Chief Justice. Every flood is certainly not rising\nto the level of a taking.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I guess what we're asking\nyou is, how do you define the baseline of protected\nexpectations for the property?\nMR. GOODHART: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You've indicated, I think,\nin your brief that one year won't do it. This was six\nor seven years.\nIf that's a baseline of expectations, the\nGovernment cannot change that, even if it thinks that\nthere is a higher and -- and more urgent priority in\nprotecting some other land?\nMR. GOODHART: Your Honor, the -- certainly,\nthe Government is not the insurer of -- of flood\ncontrol, how they just carry it out.\nThere is the case that's cited in the\nGovernment's brief, United States v. Sponenbarger, which\nsays that very thing. The United States is not the\ninsurer of it. But when it takes water and it controls\nwater and releases it in a manner that's not from\nstorms, not from natural, but does it in a manner that\nthey control how it's released and the duration,\nfrequency, and they use property to store that water for\neight -- you know, over eight years, that in this case\nwas -- was compelling. And the court found that those\nfacts --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But my question is how do\nyou define the baseline that gives a legitimate\nexpectation, if the Corps of Engineers -- did not happen\nin this case, but in the hypothetical case -- makes the\nfinding that there is a more urgent and -- and a higher\npriority for other lands, and it changes its policy? It\ncannot do that?\nMR. GOODHART: Your Honor, it can go through\nits law, the National Environmental Policy Act, the\nClean Water Act. It can make changes, and then it can\npay for what it's going to take from private landowners.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what you're saying\nis that it can't make that change without paying, right?\nMR. GOODHART: It -- it cannot make that\nchange where it's going to burden the landowner and\ninterfere with that -- those property rights that the\nFifth Amendment is guaranteeing.\nNow, in practice --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Now suppose, at the very\noutset of the dam, the -- the Government says, we've got\nto put this water someplace, we're going to put it on\nthe left bank, not the right bank. That's not a taking\nas of that time --\nMR. GOODHART: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- if the land was always\nflooded anyway on the right?\nMR. GOODHART: That may not be a taking.\nAnd, for example, in the Bedford case in 1904, where a\nrevetment was in the Mississippi River, it was trying to\ncontrol natural erosion from a cutoff that had been\ncreated, the landowner could not show --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But what I want is the\ndefinition of the operable baseline that we can use in\norder to define whether or not there has been a taking.\nMR. GOODHART: And, Your Honor, I guess I\nmust say it may not be a bright line. It is -- the\nanalysis here that this Court has used throughout its\nphysical takings cases will separate the torts from the\ntakings.\nAnd, here again, the United States -- this\nhas worked well in other cases for the United States,\nwhere in Sanguinetti there was no --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Should the baseline be what\nwould have happened if the dam was never built?\nMR. GOODHART: Perhaps, Your Honor. And in\nthis case, for example, the court had evidence that this\nland flourished before the dam. There was evidence that\nthis bottomland hardwood forest existed for generations.\nAnd when the control plan was put in effect in 1953, it\nworked fine because they mimicked natural flow where\nlate -- late winter and early spring, you have your\nreleases, they dissipate, the water recedes, but you\ndon't have extensive summertime flooding from a river.\nFrankly, anywhere in the country, but\ncertainly not in the southern part of the United States,\nthese rivers do not overflow during June, July, August.\nThis never happens.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But what do you suggest --\nwhat do you suggest -- I looked at the consent.\nMR. GOODHART: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: To tell you the truth, I\nthink it's permanent. I think they're thinking it's\nintermittent, but permanently intermittent.\nMR. GOODHART: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The flood comes like three\nmonths a year every year. And the erosion, they say\nthat part that's eroded belongs to the Government now.\nAnd if he comes back with his dirt and puts it in,\nthat's fine, but he's trespassing on Government land.\nSo if I'm right in reading that, if I'm\nright -- and a big if -- it seems that eleven cases\nsomewhat stand for this, I agree, somewhat arbitrary\nrule.\nNow -- so I'm tempted, if I'm right, to say,\nokay, it's not perfect, but let's go with it. There are\npeople all over the country who have probably relied on\nthis stuff. And that would be so absent a better rule.\nSo what do you suggest would be a better,\nclearer rule for compensating for flooding where our\nproblem is what's a trespass and what's a taking?\nMR. GOODHART: And, Your Honor, I know it\ncannot be the Federal circuit's rule that you can never\nhave temporary flooding as a taking. And I guess\nI would --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You know, but I want to\nknow what your idea -- I understand the difficulties are\nthere --\nMR. GOODHART: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- and I'm willing to\naccept a lot you mentioned.\nMR. GOODHART: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But what I'm\nasking -- which I just did ask -- is what's your idea of\na substitute that would be better?\nMR. GOODHART: Your Honor, the substitute\nwould be to remain consistent with how this Court\nanalyzes the physical takings, not use anything from\nregulatory analysis here, but looking at these elements.\nAnd the -- the Corps of Engineers will\nneed -- when they know that it's predictable, that it is\nforeseeable, as the court below found, that -- that\ntheir actions will place water for storage on land that\nthey know they can purchase flood easements for --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So a Department of the\nInterior employee trespasses on Jones's land, trampling\npaths, and even limbs fall off trees. That's a taking\nand not a trespass?\nMR. GOODHART: No, Your Honor, it's not.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because?\nMR. GOODHART: And because the Court said in\nthe Cress case, it's the character of the Government's\naction, not the amount of damages resulting from it, so\nlong as that is substantial.\nAnd in the cases, the Court has looked at\nwhat is substantial intrusion. In Loretto, the Court\nsaid a permanent physical occupation on a rooftop in Ms.\nLoretto's building, small area, that is substantial,\neven though geographically it was very small, because it\ncut through these valuable property rights to occupy\nsomeone's property.\nAnd so -- substantial may not have to be\nvery high.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So our department employee\ntrying to find a shortcut drives his bulldozer through\nJones's land knocking down his favorite redwood, it's a\ntaking?\nMR. GOODHART: Your Honor, I think we would,\nagain, use the analysis, separate out the torts, where\nthe action is direct, it's been predictable what would\nthat would result in, the United States should know\nthat, and then the intrusion or interference with those\nproperty rights is substantial, there will be a taking.\nUsually that's not going to be the case in a\none-time situation, as your hypothetical. And, again,\nhere the court heard six consecutive years of this\ninvasion of water. The commission couldn't turn it\naway.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So our cases -- our cases\ntreat physical occupations differently from other --\nfrom other cases, don't they?\nThe park ranger walking through can hardly\nbe called a physical occupation. He's harmed the land,\nbut it's not a physical occupation.\nWhat you're -- what you're arguing here is\nthat -- is that flooding the land is a physical\noccupation for the period that it's flooded.\nMR. GOODHART: It is, Your Honor. Where\nit's an occupation, it's certainly clearer and more\nintrusive. There can be invasions that don't amount to\nan occupation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but what you say --\nhere's what troubles me. You say it has to be\nsubstantial. But you -- can we -- can we fold into that\nword substantial a requirement that it have caused\nsubstantial financial loss?\nSee, if that were the case, then -- then I\ncould distinguish your case where a lot of valuable\ntrees got destroyed.\nMR. GOODHART: Certainly, Your Honor.\nSubstantial --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And I wouldn't say every --\nyou know, every flood that goes across a land, even two\nyears or three years in a row, would not necessarily be\na taking.\nMR. GOODHART: You could look at the\neconomic part -- yes, definitely, Your Honor. What is\nsubstantial is going to be made as a legal determination\nby the Corps, as a matter of degree.\nAnd you can look at the extent of the\ndamages -- if there is destruction of property.\nDestruction has been -- as in the Kansas City Life case\nin 1950, the taking is to the extent of the destruction.\nBeyond that, though, it's looking at interference with\nuse and enjoyment --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What was the Kansas City\ncase that you are referring to? I don't --\nMR. GOODHART: The Kansas City Life\nInsurance case in 1950, Your Honor, was underflow\ninvasion of water percolating up on property in Missouri\nfrom the Mississippi River. And that was found to be a\nsubstantial invasion where the property, the 1700 acres,\nwas taken by the United States. And the Court there\nsaid, when you destroy the use of that property for what\nit was being used by the landowner, you owe to the\nextent of the destruction that you have caused.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Goodhart, maybe it\nwould help to know what you think if we accept your\nposition would be left over for the Federal Circuit to\nconsider on remand. You -- you haven't asked to -- for\noutright reversal and have the decision of the Court of\nFederal Claims be the end of the matter. So if we\naccept your position, then what issues would be open for\nthe Federal Circuit to resolve on remand?\nMR. GOODHART: Your Honor, if I may, after\nanswering your question I would like to reserve the\nremainder of my time.\nYour Honor, I wish we could have asked for\naffirmance. We -- there are several other issues that\nthe Federal Circuit did not disturb or address. They\ndid not go into the facts of, on appeal, that the United\nStates --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, the question is what\ndo we say to the circuit? What do you want us to tell\nthe circuit to do on remand?\nMR. GOODHART: We want the remand to say:\nApply the rule of law here for physical taking and look\nat it as the Court of Federal Claims did: Was there a\ndirect physical injury? Did it result in substantial\nintrusion on the commission's property? If so, the Just\nCompensation Clause is self-actuating and there should\nbe just compensation.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But what were the other\nissues that you just mentioned? You said we couldn't\nask for an automatic affirmance.\nMR. GOODHART: The United States raised\nseveral issues and the commission cross-appealed in\nasking for regeneration damages, Your Honor, and those\nwould need to be addressed on the remand.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Kneedler.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nAs has been pointed out, this Court has\nconsistently held in its flooding cases and reaffirmed\nin Loretto that a -- that a taking occurs in the context\nof flooding only if the flooding is the direct result of\nthe structure itself and if it results in a permanent\neffect on the property such that it's an actual\nappropriation. So --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it's -- there is\na little confusion about the Government's position,\nthere was in the court of appeals.\nIs it -- I'm quoting from your friend's\nbrief, and he says: \"The Federal Circuit adopted a\ncategorical rule that temporary Government action can\nnever be a taking if the Government does not intend to\ncreate a permanent flooding condition.\" Is that an\naccurate statement of your understanding?\nMR. KNEEDLER: The -- I think the intent\npoint, I guess I would modify that. There are some\nthings that -- I think it would have to be an objective\nstandard. In Dickinson, for example, the -- the\nmodification was intrinsically permanent. The landowner\nhad corrected for it. But it was intrinsically\npermanent until the landowner had done something about\nit. So actually Dickinson is consistent with our --\nwith our position.\nBut I do want -- there is a critical piece\nabout this case that Justice Kennedy's questions have\ntouched upon that I think it's very important for this\nCourt to focus upon.\nThis case is not about flooding by the\nproject itself. The reservoir behind the dam, the\neasements, the flowing easements there, the spillway,\nthe project is the Government and I think it's fair to\nsay the Government is occupying the land when the\nGovernment builds the project.\nWhat we have here are incidental\nconsequences downstream from the dam as a result of the\nflowage. And there are -- Loretto, when it is summing\nup this Court's flooding cases, makes two points. One,\nit says it has to be permanent, not temporary invasion;\nbut it also distinguishes the category of cases in which\nthere is conduct outside the landowner's property that\nhas consequential damages within the property.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't -- I don't\nunderstand what you're saying. Are you saying that if\nthis landowner owned land behind the dam that was\ntemporarily flooded as often as has happened here, that\nthat would be a taking?\nMR. KNEEDLER: No. I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, I didn't think you were\nsaying that.\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, but what I'm saying is\nthis would be a particularly bad or problematic context\nfor the Court to depart from that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, there are\npretty clear findings in the Court of Claims on the\nquestion of causation, right?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I don't think it's a question\nof causation, and if I could just point out two cases,\none of which was cited in Loretto in its summing up of\nthis Court's flooding cases is Bedford. Bedford was a\nsituation in which a revetment, as counsel pointed out,\na revetment was constructed in the -- in the Mississippi\nRiver to protect erosion and access to the City of\nVicksburg. It was -- it was clearly shown in that case\nthat over time, over a period of 6 years, as in this\ncase, downstream by 6 miles it resulted in permanent\nflooding of land as a consequence of that.\nBut what the Court said is that is\nconsequential injury downstream; it is not occupation by\nthe Government.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, so if the\nGovernment comes in and tells a landowner downstream\nthat every March and April we are going to flood your\nproperty so that you can't use it, from now on, that's\nthe way -- that's part of our plan, that's a taking for\nthose 2 months, correct?\nMR. KNEEDLER: No. I don't think --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No? The Government\nsays you will not be able to use your land because of\nwhat we are doing for 2 months -- you have been able to\nup to now, but from now on, for March and April, you\ncan't. That's not a taking?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I don't, and -- and let me\nexplain why. What we're talking about here is the Corps\nof Engineers operating a dam from which it has to take\ninto account multiple considerations. In this case,\nthere was marina operators, there were farmers along the\nriver, there were drainage districts.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'll grant you that\nit can decide whose land it wants to take. I just want\nto know why that's not a taking.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Because this is a classic\nexample of the Government adjusting benefits and\nburdens. This is why the Federal Government was invited\nin to construct these projects because along -- along\nthe river there was very serious flooding. So the\nGovernment puts in a dam to control the flooding, it has\nto release the flood waters, and the timing of the\nrelease of the flood waters is something that you have\nto take into account --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if the Government\nsays we've got to release the flood waters and what\nwe're going to do is we're going to have water trucks\npull up behind the dam, we're going to load them up and\nwe're going to drive them down river to this person's\nproperty and we're going to dump the water there?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I think that's a different\nsituation because the Government itself is actually\nputting the water -- I think that's very close to being\nthe reservoir behind the dam. But -- but typically,\nwhen the Government -- I think uniformly, when the\nGovernment is operating --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But your answer is\nthat would be a taking?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I think because it would\nbe -- it would be specifically deposited on that\nlandowner's land.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I thought --\nMR. KNEEDLER: It would be the same as if\nthey put a pipe from the dam --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- to that person's land.\nBut that's not what's happening when the Government's\noperating a dam, and it's operating it with consequences\nfor the basin. It's not aimed at any particular\nlandowner.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Again, I think the\nCourt of Claims' findings are to the contrary.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They said the\nGovernment knew that this water was going to go right\nhere, right?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, it was not -- there is\nno suggestion that it was targeted at this land, which\nis -- which is I think something quite different. This\nwas -- this was an incidental consequence of what was\nhappening downstream. Again, in the Bedford case you\nhad permanent --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: A foreseeable and certain\nincidental consequence.\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, I don't believe\nforeseeable is enough. It was -- it could have been --\nit could have been foreseeable in Bedford.\nLet me take a more -- a more dramatic\nexample that I think illustrates this point. This\nCourt's decision in Sponenbarger which we cite in our\nbrief, that a -- that case discusses a prior holding by\nthis Court in a case called Jackson, which was a\nsituation where a levee, Government built a levee on one\nside of the river which had the effect of flooding\nproperty on the opposite side of the river because it --\nit kept it from going to this side and channelled it\ninto the river and it caused it to overflow the -- the\nland on the other side, and the Court said that is not a\ntaking.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if the\nGovernment decides for purposes of flood control -- I\ndon't know -- I don't know the ecological way -- but the\nwater has to percolate or whatever down in this area.\nSo it goes onto this person's land and it cuts down $5\nmillion worth of his trees. The same purpose, to assist\nin flood control. No doubt that that's a taking, right?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I think that would be --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Unless there was some\nemergency justification.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure, sure. And so\nthe Government then comes down and says, we're going to\nflood your land and we know -- again, looking at the\nfactual findings -- we know that will result in your\ntrees dying, but because we're doing it for flood\ncontrol, that's just too bad. Different case when they\ngo in with a chain saw than when they go in with the\nwater?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. When they go in with\nthe chain saw the Government is actually going on the\nproperty and the Government is, to use counsel's term,\ndirectly cutting down the trees. I think it's very hard\nto explain consequences 110 miles downstream as being\ndirect. It's -- and there is no case that -- that\nPetitioner has pointed to with that sort of incidental\nconsequence --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is the legal rubric?\nI mean what you're -- what I haven't thought of until\nyou've been putting it this way is that the Government\nbuilds a dam. When it does it, water backs up behind\nthe dam, and that water might flood somebody's land.\nThat's a taking, if it's at least permanent, and so\nforth.\nOkay. Now, the Government builds a dam, all\nthat happens. Because the Government builds a dam, a\nlot of other things happen. They release water\nsometimes. They make electricity sometimes. Different\nanimals come in.\nAll kinds of things can happen to different\npeople 200 yards down. Some will be 200 miles down,\n200 -- you know. Some will be helpful, some will be\nhurtful. Can they never bring a lawsuit? Can they\nsometimes recover? How do we look at that?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I -- I think, under this\nCourt's takings decisions, and specifically those\ndealing with effects caused by something outside the\nproperty, I think it is basically a per se rule.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, then, suppose what\nthe Government said is, Mr. Smith, you live 150 miles\nfrom here, and we have a rule, and our rule is you can't\ncut down any of your trees, and you can't farm the land,\nand you can't even walk on it without a boat. All\nright, that would be at least a regulatory taking.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, it would be -- it would\nbe analyzed as a regulatory taking --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So why -- now, they're\ndoing exactly the same thing here, but, instead of a\nregulation, they send some water in to do it. So should\nwe analyze it as a regulatory taking?\nMR. KNEEDLER: It -- it has certain\nparallels in that respect in the sense that the\nGovernment has to make a choice. It constructed the\ndam, and its releases are going to help someone and hurt\nsomeone. It can't be put in a position where it's going\nto have to pay compensation every time it chooses one --\none thing or another.\nThere's another point I'd like to make --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, but that's the issue.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm totally confused\nnow. Is Dickinson decided wrong under your theory?\nMR. KNEEDLER: No.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They built a dam. It\nraised the water level and flooded the petitioner's\nland, and the court gave recompense.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. And --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you just said two\nminutes ago -- or I thought I heard you say -- that when\nthe Government builds a dam, even if it floods some\npeople and not others, that there's no taking.\nMR. KNEEDLER: I'm talking about downstream,\nnot the -- not the reservoir. And after it goes --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: After it's --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- after it goes through --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So the baseline -- tell\nme what the baseline is. And perhaps you can answer\nJustice Kennedy's question more directly. Anything in\nthe reservoir is a taking. Anything downstream is never\na taking.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, assuming it's permanent\nin the reservoir, which it's likely to be when the\nGovernment is constructing it --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, no, not necessarily.\nSuppose there -- because of a spring melt-off or other\nfactors, it's clear that the reservoir for several\nmonths of the year will be more extensive than it will\nthe rest of the year.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you could say, just --\njust as here, that there's only been a temporary taking\nof some of the land behind the reservoir.\nNow, doesn't the -- doesn't the Government\ncondemn all the land --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. But that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- even that which would be\nonly temporarily flooded?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, but that -- that\nis covered by this Court's decision in Cress, in which\nthe Court said that if you have a situation where\nproperty is permanently liable to inevitably recurring\nflooding, that that's the same thing as a permanent --\neven though sometimes it's not -- it's not covered, it\nis permanently liable.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And the only difference in\nthat formulation and this case is that it was for seven\nyears and not permanent? Is that your --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, insofar as we're\nlooking at the temporary aspect of it. It wasn't seven\nyears, it was -- it was -- it was a series of individual\ndeterminations made by the Corps; but -- but for reasons\nthat tie into the downstream effects, it was releasing\nwater from the dam and was making a series of\nadministrative decisions about how to operate the dam.\nIt has a water control manual. Downstream\nlandowners are protected, not by retroactive award of\ndamages under the Just Compensation Clause, but by\npublic participation requirements --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I must be -- I must be\nslow today because I'm -- I'm having significant problem\nwith your articulation of your test.\nBasically, you're saying once a dam is\nbuilt -- once a dam is built, no downstream owner has a\nclaim? Or, you're building an exception from when the\nclaim can be applied to a downstream owner?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I -- I -- I think, under this\nCourt's current precedence, there would be no claim\ndownstream.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It doesn't matter\nwhether it's permanent, reoccurring --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Foreseeable.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- foreseeable or\nanything else?\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, because Jackson,\nSpokenbarger -- Sponenbarger, the revetment case,\nBedford were all cases where --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- where it was -- where it\nwas permanent.\nIf I could mention one other point --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, just before\nyou get off, because I think part of the confusion, at\nleast for me, is the difference between what the Federal\ncircuit decided and what you're arguing.\nYou seem to be arguing that it doesn't make\nany difference, it's not -- whether it's temporary or\npermanent, right? The Federal circuit thought it was\ndispositive that this they viewed as temporary and not\npermanent. So it seems to me that you're fighting, and\nyou're fighting a lot of the court of claims' very\nexhaustive findings, to present a different argument.\nMR. KNEEDLER: No.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It seems to me that\nif we disagree, and we think it makes a difference that\nit doesn't have to be 50 years, but it might be\nsomething less, then maybe you've preserved all these\nother arguments or maybe not, but --\nMR. KNEEDLER: But I think it's -- we have\nargued, both below and here, that -- that this is\nconsequential, and that -- that it's downstream and had\nthose effects.\nWe agree with the -- with the Federal\ncircuit, we are not disagreeing with that conclusion,\nbecause this is -- these were temporary -- a series of\nindividual temporary decisions made for their own\nreasons.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I know, but you\nagree -- you agree with the Federal circuit, but then\nyou're presenting all these other arguments in which it\ndoesn't depend.\nSo, if we disagree with the Federal circuit,\nit seems to me that we ought to say that, and maybe you\ncan make these other arguments about it's too far\ndownstream or --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, but -- but I think, in\ndeciding what's temporary, you shouldn't divorce it from\ncontext. And -- and here, the context is the\nconsequences downstream.\nThis is -- this is not -- if you were to\ndepart from the Court's rule up until this point about\npermanence -- and there has to be -- something less than\npermanent will do, I don't think you should ignore the\nfact that the consequences are not the sort of direct\ngovernmental occupation of the land like at the\nreservoir, but the sort of consequences downstream that\naffect -- that can affect a whole range of people.\nAnd I would like to make one very important\npoint about context, and that is, in 1928, after the\nGreat Mississippi Flood of 1927, Congress first got into\nthe flood control business in a massive way, but it --\nit -- it was unwilling to do that if it was going to be\nheld liable for consequential damages from flood waters\ndownstream.\nIt therefore included Section 702(c) in the\nFlood Control Act of 1928, which says that the\nGovernment shall not be liable for any damage to any\nproperty at any place resulting from floods or flood\nwaters.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, that can't\noverrule the Takings Clause, can it?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I think what it --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, that's nice that\nCongress doesn't want to be liable.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, but Congress -- no,\nit's -- the point is more fundamental than that.\nCongress recognized -- and the legislative history shows\nthis -- Congress recognized that under this Court's\nprecedence, there would not be takings liability. The\nBedford decision is, in fact, cited in that.\nThis Court pointed out in its James\ndecision, which recounts the history of that, that there\nwas a proposal to -- to make the Government responsible\nunder the flood -- flood control projects for any taking\nor any damage to property. And this Court said that\nwent way beyond anything the Fifth Amendment would\nrequire, and it was cut back. And Congress said it's\nnot going to be liable for any damage.\nAnd I think that shows a very important\nreliance interest on the part of Congress with respect\nto the line that this Court has drawn. Congress was not\ngoing to --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about --\nMr. Kneedler, what was wrong with Judge Newman's\nposition on this temporary versus permanent? It said --\nshe said that temporary versus permanent, the target\nshould not be the Government's action, but the effect of\nthat action; that is, if trees are killed and they\nweren't revived, the damage is permanent. That's where\nwe should vote, not whether the Government is going to\ndo this year after year.\nMR. KNEEDLER: I don't believe that that's\ncorrect. I mean, that -- that would turn on the\nhappenstance of what a particular landowner had -- had\non his property downstream.\nAnd -- and I think the Government, in\noperating the general project, cannot be held to do an\ninvestigation of every property owner. Again, it's\nreleasing water generally. And if we -- maybe if I\ncould use the levee example here.\nThis -- the release changes that were made\nhere were made to protect farmers so that they could --\nso that they could plant more crops and not -- and be\nprotected during their harvesting.\nIf you shift back to what the Corps -- to\nthe Corps' regular operating scheme, it affects the\nfarmers. There might be a flood --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, the issue is who is\ngoing to pay for that wonderful benefit to these\nfarmers. Should it be everybody, so that the Government\npays, and all of us pay through taxes, or should it be\nthis -- this particular sorry landowner who happens to\nlose all his trees?\nMR. KNEEDLER: It is in the nature --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That doesn't seem to me\nparticularly fair.\nMR. KNEEDLER: It is in the nature of living\nalong a river. Riparian ownership carries with it\ncertain risks and uncertainties, from weather, from\nintervening causes. The Government is -- there are a\nthousand square miles, more square miles of drainage\narea --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think -- one of\nthose risks has to be the Government's going to make you\npay for protecting somebody else.\nIs that one of the risks?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, when -- picking up on\nwhat I said about Congress, Congress would not have\ngotten into the flood control business without this\nprotection of liability. People --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I doubt that.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, this Court in James\nsaid it was an important condition for Congress getting\ninto it, that it was not -- Congress was not going to be\nheld liable for the -- for the damages downstream.\nThat came to be the basis, the baseline, of\nexpectations for people downstream from --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Or upstream, under\nyour theory.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, if it's -- but the\nconstruction of the project itself and the flooding of\nthe reservoir, the Government condemns that land,\npurchases that land. It recognizes --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, the hypothetical is,\nsuppose it doesn't. Suppose that there's some land\nthat's up -- that's fairly far upstream from the main\nreservoir, but it's flooded once every other year.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, the question would be\nwhether it falls within the Cress test of whether it is\npermanently liable.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Your -- but your position\nseems to be that if it's downstream, somehow it's not\nthe Government. There's a series of administrative\nactions and it's not really the Government's water.\nIt's like -- it's like the old moral refuge that the\nrocket designers take: You know, I make the rockets go\nup; where -- where they come down is not my concern.\nMR. KNEEDLER: It -- it was basically -- I\nmean, it was the rationale of this Court's cases in --\nin Bedford, in Sponenbarger, and reaffirmed by this\nCourt in Loretto, a modern takings case dealing with the\nquestion of physical occupation. And the Court said\nthat -- and it made two points. Again, it said -- it\nmade the temporary versus permanent point, but it also\nmade the point about conduct outside the land that has\nan effect inside the land.\nThis case has both of those features. You\nhave a series of temporary decisions --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But building a Government\nproject, let's say an electricity plant or high tension\nwires, you could require the taking of some land to\nbuild it. Now, you've got that and you begin to run it.\nYou could run it in such a way that it takes some of the\nproperty. I mean, the electricity could, for example,\nbecause of some odd thing run around over somebody's\nland and kill all the chickens. That wasn't expected\nbut it happened, and it happened because of the way the\nGovernment runs the plant.\nNow, I guess there would be a taking in such\ncircumstance if in fact, because of the way it's run, it\nmakes that land which no one thought would happen, as a\nconsequence of the project uninhabitable; wouldn't there\nbe?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, again, it depends. If\nthe Government -- if the Government is occupying the\nland when it happens, yes. But there's -- as you've I\nthink pointed out, there's a critical difference between\na tort and a taking. And there -- there can be\ncollateral consequences of what the Government does\nthat -- that cause injury.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The collateral consequence\nis to make some piece of land 4 miles away quite\nunexpectedly, but totally uninhabitable. Now, what's\nsupposed to happen there? That's not just a trespass\nbecause it's permanent. And even if it's once every\n2 years, it's permanently once every 2 years.\nMR. KNEEDLER: I think it would depend on\nwhether -- and there was a -- a case -- I believe it's\nthe Baltimore & Ohio Railroad --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What does it say?\nMR. KNEEDLER: It says if the -- it had to\ndo with releasing smoke from -- from a train. And the\nCourt said just -- just releasing it into the air --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but they made this --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- but -- but if you focus it\non someone --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. KNEEDLER: If -- if you pipe it -- if\nyou pipe it to the person's property, that's a -- that\nmay be a different matter.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So -- well,\nthat's the part -- that's the point. The reason they\ndon't compensate there is it apparently had something to\ndo with everybody suffering the cinders. But where the\ncinders went out of the train and they ended up on just\none person's property because there were some pipes or\nsomething, then it was a taking.\nMR. KNEEDLER: It was focused, and that's\nnot -- not true in the operation of the dam.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, here they're focusing\nit on his land.\nMR. KNEEDLER: They're not focusing it on\nhis land. His land -- first of all, the commission's\nland has always been subject to flooding and, as we\npointed out in our brief, even under -- even under\nPetitioner's analysis, it results in an incremental\nflooding of 5, 4 or -- 3 or 4 days.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not flooding that time of\nyear. That's the problem. I mean -- yes, flooding at a\ntime when it wouldn't harm the trees.\nMR. KNEEDLER: But it is land -- it is land\nin a floodplain that would be suitable for any sort of\nconstruction or development. It is land in a\nfloodplain. And they have -- they have not argued, and\nin fact, their appraiser in this case acknowledged, that\nthere is no permanent decrease in the valuation of the\nland. They are -- they are arguing only about trees.\nAnd that is -- that seems classic\nconsequential tort-type damages, that -- that flood\nwaters, it -- we'll assume in somewhat greater\nincrements, went on the land and damaged trees. They\ndidn't damage the land. In fact, the commission --\nthere was still hunting on the land during this period\nof time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It strikes me that\nthat's a valuation question. But I understood you to\nsay that if there was a pipe coming out of the dam and\nit went to somebody's -- right to the property line of\nsomebody's land and that's where you dump the water,\nthat would be a taking.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. Because --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. I thought the\nfactual findings in the trial court said that was this\ncase, that you knew when you opened up the dam that this\nis where the water was going to go.\nMR. KNEEDLER: First of all, the Court --\nthe Court did not say that the Government knew. In\nfact, it said the Government was unaware -- this\ndiscussion's between 95a and 99a in the Court of Federal\nClaims decision -- that the Government was unaware in --\nin 1993.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about 6 years\nlater, when it was doing the same thing and the water\nwent to the same place?\nMR. KNEEDLER: The taking goes -- the taking\nclaim here goes from 1993 to 1998. The Court of Federal\nClaims said even as of 19 -- at least until 1996, it was\ngenerally assumed that the operations of the dam did not\nhave a significant impact below the Missouri-Arkansas\nline. Again, this is 110 miles downstream. This was in\nno way focused on the -- on the commission's land,\nbut --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Are you saying there's a\ndifference between the situation where the Government\nparticularly wants the water to go to a -- to a place,\nand the situation where the Government knows that's\nwhere it's going to go, but doesn't particularly care\nwhere it's going to go?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I think there's a -- I don't\nknow about the \"intend.\" I mean, in the hypothetical\nwith the Chief Justice the Government was actually\ntransmitting the water. It was essentially using the\nland as -- as a reservoir. And that -- that's, I think,\nwhat Petitioner's counsel was trying to conjure up by\nsaying the Government was using this land for storage.\nThe Government was not using this land for storage. The\n-- this wasn't the Government's water. There weren't\nany outtakes from the commission's land to use this\nwater.\nThese were flood waters, which again the\nFlood Control Act says the Government is not liable for\nthe release of flood waters from a project, that ended\nup on the land that is an incidental consequence of the\noperation of a flood control project.\nPeople who live in a basin where there is a\nflood control project get enormous benefits in the\ncontrol of that. The water has to be released. And it\nhas long been the case that the way that problem is --\nthat issue is handled about how it will be released is\nby ordinary administrative law principles, basically,\nwith the Corps, in operating the dam, they have\nrequirements of public participation. In this case, the\ncommission participated on ad hoc planning groups.\nThis manual had not been updated in 50\nyears. Corps regulations say that manuals should be\nupdated to keep apace of changing circumstances,\npopulation changes, different uses, environmental\nconcerns, so that when that happens, the commission\nacted responsibly here and, had --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you would say that\neven -- even if this land was permanently flooded, okay,\npermanently flooded so he couldn't use it at all, since\nit was downstream, no harm done, right?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I think that's the\nconsequence of this -- but there's no -- the Court\ndoesn't have to decide that here.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that's your position.\nMR. KNEEDLER: That -- that's I think the\nnecessary consequence of this Court's holdings in\nBedford, in Bedford and related cases. And -- it may\nhave harshness in some circumstances. But again, when\nyou live on a river and you know the consequences of\nhaving a flood control project on the river, that --\nthat's what happens, but this is not arbitrary. There\nis this planning process. There is notice and comment.\nThere's NEPA --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If there's notice\nand comment -- so the choice is, there are 10 landowners\ndownstream. The question is which one you're going to\nflood. And you flood number 2, and there is a public\nprocess in which number 1 and 3 through 10 get to say,\nyes, this sounds fine to me.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, that's not -- that's not\nwhat happens. What the Corps was working for here, it's\ncommendable. The Corps was trying to develop a\nconsensus of downstream water users, which is why it\nconvened this ad hoc working group: The commission\ndrainage districts, representatives of farmers, the\nmarina, the Corps of Engineers, getting everybody\ntogether to try to come up with a -- with a way to\nhandle the problem. And --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But what difference does\nthat make? It's nice that you try to reach consensus.\nIf number 2 is not going to be part of the\nconsensus because he's the one always affected --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- you're saying\npermanency -- permanency, repetition, nothing counts,\nhe's just -- loses.\nMR. KNEEDLER: No. He doesn't lose because\nhe has an action under the Administrative Procedure Act.\nHe's not -- the -- the Corps is required to take into\naccount various factors including, specifically, the\nimpact on other people in the basin when it's making a\ndecision. If the Corps --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but he loses because\nthe Corps comes in and says, yes, indeed, we did flood\n2, but, in order to save, you know, 1 and 3 through 10.\nRight? And -- and he'd lose.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, the Corps cannot be\narbitrary in doing that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. It's not arbitrary.\nMR. KNEEDLER: But the -- but the Corps\nrequires a broad ambit of discretion in managing a river\nover time, and it has to be able to change to update\ncircumstances without exposing the United States to\nmassive liability.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kneedler, does your\nessential argument turn on this being indirect, as you\nsay? This is consequential; therefore, it isn't -- it\ndoesn't belong in the takings category, anything that's\nconsequential rather than direct?\nMR. KNEEDLER: We have two submissions. I\nmean, it's the confluence of both factors mentioned in\nLoretto. And the Court doesn't have to decide anything\nbroader than that. It's the temporary nature of the\ndecisions.\nThese were individual decisions made often\nwith a recommendation or concurrence of the ad hoc\ncommittee. So it's temporary in nature -- self\nlimiting, as everyone knew as part of this ongoing\nplanning process -- but, also, particularly in this\ncase, where it has only consequential effects\ndownstream, which is, again, the way the Court --\nincluding in Lionel, one of the leading cases -- the\nCourt says that this is consequential.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why should it make a\ndifference whether the court had -- the Corps has a plan\nwhich says, we're going to release this water every\nsummer, and a situation where, year after year after\nyear, somebody makes an ad hoc decision in the summer\nthat we're going to release the water?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I don't think analytically,\nfor the reasons I said about -- about the downstream;\nbut, to the extent the Court is focusing on temporary,\nthese were self-limiting, and there was no guarantee\nthey were going to be renewed.\nAnd, in fact, at the end of this process,\nthe court -- or the Corps decided not to adopt a\npermanent change after going through the NEPA process.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Kneedler.\nMr. Goodhart, you have four minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES F. GOODHART\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. GOODHART: Thank you.\nAs -- as my friend has said about these\ndamages being consequential and just affecting trees and\nnot -- not the land, the -- the court did not find that\nthis was just consequential downstream damage; that this\nwas direct, natural, and probable from these releases\nthat the commission had protested and complained about\nfor years.\nThat -- that that's in the record, that they\nknew that they were using this land to store this water.\nAnd the commission could not get their attention to stop\nit until our director -- it was on Valentine's Day in\n2001 -- brought the appraisal to the Corps of Engineers'\noffice, a whole roomful of people from both sides, and\nplaced that report from -- from 2000, that said, over $4\nmillion worth of valuable timber is gone, please stop.\nWe -- we were -- we were pleading. So they knew.\nAnd I think the Court of Federal Claims\nfound that they -- they had the understanding that they\nwere using this to accommodate the farmers who were\nusing marginally low property, that the U.S. Fish and\nWildlife Service says in the record probably should have\nbeen cleared anyway, but they were wanting to provide\nand adjust the benefits for those landowners and use the\ncommission's property to store the water.\nAnd, Your Honor, I don't know, Justice\nKennedy, where the line should be drawn, but the cases\nof Sponenbarger and Bedford and Sanguinetti say that\nwhen it's not the United States' structure or it's not\nthe policy -- and the landowner cannot show that, that\nit's from storms or from something in nature -- that's\nnot going to incur liability. Even negligence may not\nincur liability unless it's direct that what -- how it\ncaused, and then substantial intrusion.\nAnd, Your Honor, I think --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is the baseline -- go\nback to Justice Kennedy's question -- is it before the\ndam or after the dam, and why is it one or the other?\nIf flooding was going to occur more\nunpredictably before the dam, and possibly summer\nflooding of this kind could have happened, do you lose?\nMR. GOODHART: Your Honor, under that --\nunder those facts, if it could have happened and the\nlandowner knew that, and that that is -- that is a\ncause, not the United States, if -- if the United States\ntakes away its flood protection and this land goes back\nto what it would be naturally, then the landowner can't\nprove that it's direct from the United States. The\nlandowner would not recover in that instance.\nIn this situation, the evidence --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Even though after the\ndam and the dam's plan was to ensure that it didn't\nhappen, you would still lose? If natural conditions --\nMR. GOODHART: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- would have possibly\ncaused this, you would lose?\nMR. GOODHART: If -- if it's not\nsuper-induced invasions directly from the United States,\nthe landowner is going to have that as a natural\ncondition. Here, that was certainly not the case.\nSummertime flooding of this type never happened in\nthe recorded history.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Pre-dam. In the\nrecorded history.\nMR. GOODHART: In the pre-dam or during the\nwhole first 40 years of how this was operated.\nIt was when it was adjusted that the United\nStates used this land and then took the valuable timber.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not sure that's not\nopen to dispute. There is some argument here that\nrainfall that was naturally occurring contributed to\nwhat was happening to the trees.\nMR. GOODHART: And I --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I think that there is --\nat least that's what I understood some of the factual\nargument to be.\nMR. GOODHART: No, Your Honor. I think the\nrecord is clear that this was directed naturally,\nprobably without the -- without the interference or\naddition of nature.\nThank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nCounsel, the case is submitted.\n(Whereupon, at 11:55 a.m., the case in the\nabove-entitled matter was submitted.)\n23:24 24:15 appropriation 18:19 40:8 20:5,10,24\n56:23 agree 18:23 38:3 April 27:25 28:8 55:9 34:1 43:25\nain't 8:3 area 10:15 11:8 Baltimore 45:5 brief 15:7,17\nALITO 17:19 argue 6:2 34:17,18 42:17 bring 32:25\n51:10 ambit 51:21 46:15 basic 13:22 broader 52:8\n40:7 argument 1:12 36:13 43:14 build 44:3\n48:22 amounting 4:8 24:23 37:17 51:11 43:25\nanalysis 11:2,2 52:1 53:12 basis 42:17 builds 13:5\n21:5 analytically 37:23 38:10,14 30:20 37:2 built 17:20 31:1\n40:18,19 52:25 Arkansas 1:3,15 40:1 43:16 34:5 36:14,14\nanalyze 33:17 3:4 50:1,1 54:16 bulldozer 20:25\n43:10 analyzes 19:23 36:12 2:4,7,10 3:8 burdens 28:21\n13:23 asking 15:2 40:23 45:4\nanswering 23:21 assist 31:13 benefit 13:5 call 13:12\n17:2 54:11 assumed 47:24 benefits 28:20 21:18 30:25\n43:9 49:6 APPEARAN...
