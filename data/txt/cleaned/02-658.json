FRANKLIN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. FRANKLIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe question in this case is whether the Federal\nEnvironmental Protection Agency has the legal authority to\noverride by fiat a discretionary determination that\nCongress expressly directed be made instead by the State\nof Alaska, which Congress trusted to exercise its own\nindependent judgment according to local priorities and\nlocal conditions. We submit that the answer to that\nquestion is no.\nWhen Congress wanted to give EPA the authority\nto -- under the Clean Air Act to review and approve the\nsubstance of individual State determinations of the best\navailable control technology, or BACT, Congress said so\nexpressly. It gave EPA no such role in the circumstances\nof this case.\nQUESTION: Well, do you think that the statute\nallows EPA to at least say, Alaska, you didn't go through\nthe proper analysis here, you didn't consider, as\ncontemplated by the statute, some of the costs and\nconcerns that would enable a State to say, fine, you go\nahead with less than the ultimate equipment? Now, can\nEPA, under the statute, say, Alaska, you just didn't\nfollow the required procedures?\nMR. FRANKLIN: EPA can say, yes, Alaska, you did\nnot consider the statutory factors, but that is not the\ncontention that's being made in this case, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Well, isn't that an element here in\nfact? Wasn't that part of EPA's concern? Is it true that\nthe owner of the mine wouldn't even furnish certain\nfinancial information to enable the State to make that\nanalysis?\nMR. FRANKLIN: Two points, Your Honor. The\ncontention that's being made here is not that Alaska\nfailed to consider the factors that Congress set forth.\nThe contention is that they didn't do it in the way that\n-- that EPA might have done it if EPA were the permitting\nauthority with regard --\nQUESTION: Well, that's a -- that's a pretty\nfine line. I mean, I'm -- I'm really surprised by -- by\nyour concession. I -- I would have thought a much more\nrational interpretation of the statute is that, yes, the\nState has certain obligations under the statute to\nconsider the factors, but if they were not considered, the\nperson who would bring them to account for not considering\nthem is initially the State courts and then, on\ncertiorari, to this Court. I thought your position was\nthat this is none of EPA's business --\nMR. FRANKLIN: It is our --\nQUESTION: -- that this -- that this\ndiscretionary determination is given to the States, and\nwhen the States are reviewed, they should be reviewed in\ncourt.\nMR. FRANKLIN: That is our -- our position, Your\nHonor.\nQUESTION:\nfor the hypothetical that Justice O'Connor gives as well\nas for everything else?\nMR. FRANKLIN: I think that the -- the line is\nwhether the requirements of the statute were followed or\nnot. In this case, Alaska has done precisely that which\nit --\nQUESTION: Well, assuming they weren't followed,\nis your position that when they are not followed, EPA can\ncall them to account?\nMR. FRANKLIN: EPA has the authority to enforce\nthe requirements and prohibitions of the act, but we\nbelieve that authority should be narrowly circumscribed to\nthe bounds that Congress set for the EPA.\nQUESTION: Well, let -- let me intervene and --\nand suggest this. Could you have answered Justice\nO'Connor's question this way? Oh, yes, the EPA can -- can\ncomplain and make its case that the State did not exercise\nits discretion the right way, but it can't do so by just\nissuing an order. It has to go through the judicial\nreview process. Would -- would that -- would that answer\nyour case or --\nMR. FRANKLIN: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- or am I misstating the theory\nhere?\nMR. FRANKLIN: No, you're not, Your Honor. The\n-- the question in this case is not whether the claims\nthat EPA raises here will be subject to review. The\nquestion is how, when, and in what manner, and --\nQUESTION: Okay. Now, could -- could the EPA\nhave gone to Federal court and say, oh, well, this\ndiscretion was exercised in good faith and so forth, but\nit was -- it was wrong? It didn't comply with the\nstatute. Could it go to Federal court?\nMR. FRANKLIN: if it's contention is it didn't\ncomply with the express terms of the statute --\nQUESTION: In -- in this case -- in this case --\nMR. FRANKLIN: In this case, no.\nQUESTION: -- as Justice O'Connor said, it\ndidn't give -- oh, it cannot go to Federal court?\nMR. FRANKLIN: Not in this case, Your Honor. It\ncould under the State review procedure, and I think\nthere's an open question as to whether --\nQUESTION: Well, why couldn't it? Why couldn't\nit? They simply proceed under 28 U.S.C. 1345.\nMR. FRANKLIN: Exactly.\nQUESTION: Now, what they do is they say, we're\nnow in Federal court. There's a State law here. The\nState law happens to say that you cannot be arbitrary.\nMR. FRANKLIN: Correct.\nQUESTION:\nsame claim identically. They were arbitrary, capricious,\nabuse of discretion. But it's under State law. And now,\nmy goodness, what is this case about?\nMR. FRANKLIN: Exactly.\nQUESTION: You say that they should have gone\ninto the Ninth Circuit under 1345 arguing it was\narbitrary, capricious under State law, and they say that\nthey should be in the Ninth Circuit arguing that it's\narbitrary and capricious under Federal law, where I've\nnever heard that there's any difference between arbitrary\nand capricious under State law or under Federal law. It's\njust whether it's arbitrary and capricious.\nMR. FRANKLIN: There are two important\ndifferences, Your Honor, and -- and I think they would\nhave -- 1345 is the statute I was just about to cite, and\nI think they would have the authority to go into Federal\ncourt under State law. Two important distinctions.\nFirst, Your Honor, the -- the -- going through\nthe State process would require that they go through, in\naddition to the State judicial review process, the State\nadministrative review process. In Alaska, that would have\nallowed Alaska's Department of Environmental Conservation\na de novo administrative hearing at which they could have\npresented a full administrative record, additional\nwitnesses, and they would have had the opportunity to\nfurther clarify and defend their decision.\nThe second point, Your Honor, is that under the\nfiat that they have exercised here by order, it does not\naccord Alaska's determination the kind of deference that\nit would have received under the State process.\nThe point that we're making, Your Honor, is that\nthe State review process is adequate to address all the\nconcerns --\nQUESTION: They do go into Federal court, and I\ndo see your point.\nWhat I am curious about is I think there are\nlike maybe a handful of administrative law experts who\nmight have thought there was really some kind of\ndifference between whether you're in Federal court under\nthe State words or in Federal court under the Federal\nwords when the words are identical. And there may be\nsomebody who thinks there's a difference between what you\ntold Justice O'Connor and what you've told Justice Scalia,\nbut I'm not one of them. I don't understand how you\nreconcile those things.\nSo if we assume Congress is not an expert, why\nwouldn't they have just meant by this, well, EPA, you stay\nout of it unless you think what they're doing is\nunreasonable? If what you think they're doing is\nunreasonable, you have the authority to come in and go to\nFederal court if you want. That would be simple.\nEverybody would understand it.\nMR. FRANKLIN: If Congress had made that clear\nin the statute, Your Honor, we would not be here. The\nreason that Congress did not is that when Congress wanted\nto give EPA the authority to review and approve the\nsubstance of individual State BACT determinations, it said\nso expressly in section 7475 --\nQUESTION: Mr. Franklin --\nMR. FRANKLIN: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- perhaps I misunderstood your\nbrief, but I thought that you were making the distinction\nin your brief between the substance of a decision and the\nprocedural motions. I thought you conceded that if the\nAlaska agency simply said, well, the company wants Low\nNOx, so they're going to get it, and we're not going to go\nthrough any feasibility analysis. I thought your brief\nconceded that if that were the case, there would be access\nto the Federal court on the part of EPA.\nMR. FRANKLIN: Yes, Your Honor, but that is not\nwhat we are here about today. What we are here about\ntoday is EPA --\nQUESTION: Well, why isn't it, going back to\nJustice O'Connor's question, when the EPA is saying, in\nessence, you didn't really go through the feasibility\nanalysis because you didn't even ask for the relevant\ninformation?\nMR. FRANKLIN: To get back to that, Your Honor,\nthe -- what EPA is saying is that we did go through the\nfactors, but we didn't weigh them the way EPA would.\nAnd with respect to the economic considerations,\nYour Honor, Alaska has followed EPA's own guidance on this\nwhich says quite clearly that the individual circumstances\nand finances of a permit -- an applicant are not to be\nconsidered in the analysis. So it was not relevant\nwhether the technology would have bankrupted this company\nor not. What Alaska found to be relevant and what it was\nits statutory prerogative to find relevant and as a matter\nof its own local priorities was a comparison of the costs\nbetween this applicant and other similarly situated\napplicants in recent decisions.\nQUESTION: So you want --\nQUESTION: Mr. Franklin, it's not just a\nquestion of coming into Federal court.\nMR. FRANKLIN: No.\nQUESTION: It's not just a question of the\nagency coming into Federal court the way a private citizen\nwould and challenging the State action. It's a matter of\nthe agency issuing an order --\nMR. FRANKLIN: Exactly.\nQUESTION: -- which order is presumptively valid\nand which would have to be deferred to by the Federal\ncourt presumably unless the order was arbitrary or\ncapricious.\nMR. FRANKLIN: And that is what I was --\nQUESTION: So you'd be deciding in Federal court\nwhether it was arbitrary or capricious for EPA to find the\nState to have been arbitrary or capricious, a very -- a\nvery refined determination, to put it mildly.\nMR. FRANKLIN: Yes, Your Honor, and that is --\nQUESTION: But isn't that the problem? It isn't\njust a matter of getting into Federal court. It's a\nmatter of how you get into Federal court.\nMR. FRANKLIN: Exactly. As I was saying before,\nit's not a question of -- of whether these things will be\nreviewed but how, and more specifically, whether these\nissues which are --\nQUESTION: But it is. There's a difference\nbecause you're -- you said that the review -- the\nreviewing authority would be the State court. So you\naren't talking about whether there would be Federal court\nreview, and I think in response to Justice Scalia, now you\nare saying that the route is the State court. You're\nagreeing with him when he said the route is the State\ncourt and this Court on cert.\nDo you see any role for the Federal courts?\nMR. FRANKLIN: Well, as Justice Breyer pointed\nout, it's an open question. We believe that the Federal\ncourts -- if EPA were instituting this, the State review\nprocedure, under section -- 28 U.S.C., section 1345, there\nmay be Federal jurisdiction because that confers original\nFederal jurisdiction on any action brought by a Federal\nagency. But that's a narrow, limited scope.\nQUESTION: Well, but the action has to properly\nlie in order for it to be successful, and when you have --\non what basis would the agency be suing?\nMR. FRANKLIN: They would be suing under the\nState review procedure, Your Honor. It would be their\noption we think, and it's an open question. It's not one\nthat I think this Court --\nQUESTION: I don't think they could do it.\nSuppose that the -- a State agency decides the\nbest available control technology is a ceiling fan that\nthey brought up to New Orleans -- from New Orleans. They\nbought it and brought it up to Alaska. Now, EPA looks at\nthat and says, no, no, this is going too far. Now, what\nin your opinion is supposed to happen?\nMR. FRANKLIN: Well, in -- in our opinion in\nthat situation, Your Honor, it would be subject to the\nAPA-type review and it would be struck down. Again, the\nquestion is not whether that kind of review of --\nQUESTION: What's the role of the Federal court?\nMR. FRANKLIN: Well, if EPA is the one bringing\nthe action, I -- I would accept Your Honor's premise that\nonce it has proceeded through the comment process, once it\nhas proceeded through the administrative review process --\nand frankly, we think that that particular matter would\nend there. No State would do that because the States take\ntheir responsibilities seriously to implement these\nstatutes.\nIf, however, there were any question that\nremained at the end of that process, which EPA\ncircumvented in this case by fiat, then and only in that\nevent would EPA be able to seek judicial review, but it\nwould be an APA case. It would not be --\nQUESTION: Well, I don't -- I don't understand\nanyway because the statute that we're looking at, section\n113(a)(5) says that if EPA finds a State is not acting in\ncompliance with any requirement or prohibition of the PSD\nprogram --\nMR. FRANKLIN: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- EPA can stop construction and\nissue orders. It can also bring a civil suit for\ninjunctive or monetary relief.\nSuppose it just puts out an order and says,\nlook, Alaska, you did not determine what costs would mean\nto the mine in terms of profitability, employment, or\nglobal competitiveness, and therefore you didn't meet the\nrequirements of the PSD statute, and you stop any\nconstruction now on the mine expansion. That would put\nthe onus on the mine owner or the State to go to court\nsomewhere, wouldn't it?\nMR. FRANKLIN: It would and -- and that's\nprecisely the reversal of the kind of presumption of\nregularity that the States are entitled to in these kinds\nof cases.\nQUESTION: Mr. Franklin --\nQUESTION: So under 17 -- or what is it --\n7413(a)(5)(C), which is 14a of your brief toward the\nbottom, you say that in this case the agency cannot invoke\nthat section to issue an order or to go to court.\nMR. FRANKLIN: That is correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: All right. You have to say that to\nbe consistent.\nMR. FRANKLIN: Yes.\nQUESTION: Now, if you want us to write the\nopinion your way, you would say under 17 -- 7413(a)(5),\nthe State -- the EPA cannot issue an order barring\nconstruction unless. Now you fill in the blank.\nMR. FRANKLIN: Unless a State has -- if there\nwas a demonstrated violation of an express statutory\nrequirement. For example, a State has not --\nQUESTION: Well --\nMR. FRANKLIN: -- issued a permit to begin with\nor a State has not put a BACT limitation into a permit.\nThose are the kind --\nQUESTION: Unless there's a violation of an\nexpress statutory requirement, but the Government is going\nto come up and say, there was a -- there was a violation\nof the statute defining BACT.\nMR. FRANKLIN: But in this case, Your Honor,\nthat is not with respect to -- to the EPA, that's not what\nthey're saying. They're saying that we did go through the\nvarious factors that the BACT statute requires us to go\nthrough. In their opinion we didn't weigh them the proper\nway and under the proper policies. We, in fact, disagree\nstrongly with that, but that is a contention that is\nraised every day of the week under administrative\nprocedure law. It's not a contention that the express\nrequirements of the statute --\nQUESTION: What your formulation is, is that\nthey did not follow a requirement of the statute. And I\njust don't see how that gets you there.\nQUESTION: You're making a distinction between\nthe express requirements of the statute and the obviously\nimplicit requirements of the statute? Certainly it -- it\nis implicit in the statute that the State's decision must\nbe made rationally and not arbitrarily. Don't you think\nthat that's a requirement of law?\nMR. FRANKLIN: It is certainly a requirement of\nlaw, Your Honor, but it is a background principle that\nderives ultimately, we think, from the Due Process Clause\nnot a unstated requirement of the Clean Air Act.\nAnd the important thing is what did Congress\nintend for EPA to be able to --\nQUESTION: I mean, that isn't going to get --\nthe reason I think we're -- I'm having the same trouble\nJustice Scalia is because the kind of -- in my mind\nanyway, I tend to think of a classical definition of\narbitrary and capricious as sometimes involving they\ndidn't follow what the statute told them to do. Sometimes\nthey did what the statute told them not to do. Sometimes\nthey didn't get the weight right. And I put all those\nthings -- and I think a lot of people do -- in the same\nbox called arbitrary and unreasonable, capricious, and you\ntry to draw some kind of line between those things. I\ndon't know how to do it, and I don't think many judges\nwould.\nMR. FRANKLIN: Well, I think that judges would,\nYour Honor.\nreviewing such a procedure, could -- could find the -- the\norder invalid under either basis, either it didn't comply\nwith the statute or it didn't comply with the APA.\nHere, though, Congress specifically\ncircumscribed the EPA's authority and it did so for a good\nreason.\nQUESTION: Where is --\nQUESTION: But the language of 113(a)(5) doesn't\nreally seem to be limiting -- I'm over here.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FRANKLIN: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: It doesn't seem to be limiting the\nauthority of EPA. And I'm just wondering just -- I'm not\nsure I totally follow the argument, but I'm just looking\nat the -- that statutory provision. And are you saying\nthat statutory provision does not apply even if the State\nacted arbitrarily and capriciously?\nMR. FRANKLIN: The statute governs how the\nagency's -- gives the agency the discretion. How the --\nthe agency exercises that discretion is a separate\nquestion and one that is traditionally reviewed on a full\nadministrative record by a court, not by EPA acting on its\nown fiat.\nQUESTION: Well, but this -- that provision\ngives the -- the EPA the authority to issue certain\norders.\nMR. FRANKLIN: Yes.\nQUESTION: And is it your position that they did\nnot have the authority to issue the order here or that the\norder was wrong?\nMR. FRANKLIN: Our -- that they did not have the\nauthority because there was not a -- a violation of the\nrequirements of the act, which is the only basis --\nQUESTION: Even if there were a violation of the\nrequirements of the act, would you say they -- if -- if\nthere were a violation of the act, would they have the\nauthority to issue it -- issue that order?\nMR. FRANKLIN: If there -- if there were a\nviolation of the express requirements of the act, then --\nthen that's what the statute says. But it has to be read\nin context. It has to be read in context. Particularly\nwhen Congress wanted to give EPA the authority to review\nand approve the substance of these determinations, it said\nso expressly in one narrow instance that is not applicable\nhere. When a State has --\nQUESTION: That's in advance of the permit. The\nfact that -- that Congress specified that for certain\npollutions, you must, before you give any permit, go to\nthe EPA doesn't exclude that you could have the review\nafter.\nBut I would like to ask you. You seem to be\nsaying, well, this is just a determination. They applied\nthe statutory factors. EPA didn't like the way they did\nit. There seems to be lurking in this a -- a difference\non what the statute means to this extent.\nEPA seems to be taking a single source approach.\nThat is, you want a new generator? That generator has to\nhave BACT for that generator. Never mind if you tell us\nvoluntarily you're going to put Low NOx on all of them and\nthe result would be lowering the emissions. In other\nwords, EPA seems to be taking a no-bubble approach to\nthis. You go at it machine by machine --\nMR. FRANKLIN: Right.\nQUESTION: -- generator by generator, where\nyou're taking the position or Alaska is taking the\nposition that if you can reduce overall emissions by\nputting the Low NOx on all six generators and in the end\nhave cleaner air, well, then do that and forget about the\nSCR on one machine. That seems to be a substantive\ndifference about whether BACT applies to the whole setup\nor machine -- generator by generator.\nMR. FRANKLIN: Yes, it is, and we believe that\nEPA is -- is wrong on that. But they're wrong as a matter\nof policy, Your Honor. The BACT statute gives the States\nthe discretion to weigh, among other factors,\nenvironmental factors. We think that is clearly broad\nenough for the State to take into consideration the\noverall environmental effect that this --\nQUESTION: But that's -- it's either that you go\nat it machine -- source by source, new source by new\nsource, modification by modification, or you can have the\nbubble concept. In Chevron, EPA was -- was espousing the\nbubble concept and the Court -- this Court said, EPA,\nthat's a reasonable construction of the statute.\nNow EPA seems to be saying as to this program\nthere is no bubble. You have to look at that machine,\nthat generator in isolation.\nMR. FRANKLIN: Right.\nQUESTION: And that seems to be a basic\ndifference on what the statute means, not on -- mix it all\nup and is it arbitrary and capricious.\nMR. FRANKLIN: We think that it's -- in fact,\nthere is a difference on -- on how it's to be implemented.\nCongress was very clear here. They understood that States\nwould have different policies, that one State could choose\nthe approach that EPA might choose, which says we are not\ngoing to consider the environmental -- overall\nenvironmental impact here. Another State might view it\ndifferently, but that's what Congress wanted to have\nhappen. When EPA issued its orders in this case --\nQUESTION: But on the facts here I thought --\nnow, tell me if I'm right about this. When I started\nreading it, I was quite sympathetic to your view that it\nmakes no sense to have more emissions coming out as a\nresult of trying to control this one generator. Their job\nis to get fewer emissions not more. But then when I read\ninto the record a little bit, it seemed to me that the\nfacts are that by the time this generator 17 came up, it\nwas perfectly apparent that the company had to put the --\nwhatever, some low technology, NOx technology or something\non four of the other generators anyway.\nSo that the bottom line is that this bubble has\nnothing to do with this case because we're talking about\none generator coming in in circumstances where the other\ngenerators have to be controlled regardless. Am I right?\nMR. FRANKLIN: You're almost right, Your Honor,\nbut the -- the difference is that there -- there were four\nother generators that were subject to the cap, but there\nwere six other generators total.\nQUESTION: I know, but then we -- I had my law\nclerk go through and do the extra emissions from those\nother two, and it didn't really make any difference.\nMR. FRANKLIN: It did -- it does make a\ndifference, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: It does?\nMR. FRANKLIN: Because of the assumption that\nAlaska made, and that is that if you used SCR on MG-17 --\nand this has never been challenged -- that -- that MG-17\nwould be the backup generator. It would not be used.\nTherefore, any emissions savings that you can get off\nthose other two engines, 2 and 6, no matter how small they\nmight be -- and I think that they probably come in the\nneighborhood of 100 tons or so. Any emissions savings\nthat you can get off 2 and 6 add to the bottom line\nbecause the assumption that the State has made, which is a\n-- a reasonable and in my view correct assumption, is that\nMG-17 is not going to be used if it's SCR because SCR has\nenormous operating costs associated with it.\nAgain, these were the -- the policy\ndeterminations --\nQUESTION: If I go --\nQUESTION: I still don't -- I don't -- I don't\nsee where Justice Breyer's question fits with -- with the\nissue, does the statute dictate BACT on an individual\ngenerator? Never mind the rest. In other words, does the\nact say, no bubble, and that's how EPA seems to be reading\nthe act, that it's not a matter of discretion, that this\ncalls for a new source, modified source, and you just look\nat that new source and you don't look at the old\ngenerators at all.\nMR. FRANKLIN: You look at the new source, Your\nHonor, but you're allowed to consider environmental impact\nin looking at it. And there EPA is wrong, if that's their\ncontention. Their -- for example, they -- they do not\nrequire States, nor could they, to use their top-down\nmethodology. EPA understands -- and that is the nub of\nthis case -- that the BACT determination is not supposed\nto be a uniform Federal standard.\nQUESTION: What -- what other method is there\nbesides the top-down? I know both briefs have said it's\n-- it's the way it was done here. That's what EPA\nrecommends, but it isn't inevitable. What else would they\nuse other than top-down?\nMR. FRANKLIN: It could -- it could be bottom-\nup, Your Honor. They could look at each technology and\neliminate the ones going up. There's a number of\ndifferent ways that a State could do it.\nThe point that's being made here, when EPA\nissued --\nQUESTION: Is that in fact the situation, that\nthere are other ways, or is it just in theory, but they\nall use top-down?\nMR. FRANKLIN: Your Honor, I don't know what\nevery State uses, but I do know that Congress made clear\n-- and the legislative history at page 31 of the Senate\nreport is crystal clear on this point -- that each State\nwas to have the discretion to weigh the factors in its own\njudgment. And -- and Congress made clear that a State --\nit would be permissible for a State to consider such\nthings as anticipated and desired economic development, as\nwell as the amount of the available increment that the\nState wished a particular source to consume. When --\nQUESTION: Mr. -- Mr. Franklin, the -- the\ndifficulty that I'm having with -- with your argument\nabout the meaning of the statute goes back to your answer\nI think to Justice Kennedy's question awhile ago. He\nasked you, in effect, what's the role of the statute on\nyour theory, and -- and you said, well, if they -- if they\nsimply ignore one of the stated statutory factors, they\nsay we're not going to consider this, or if there's a\ntechnical defect in the order, if the order is incomplete,\nthat would be a -- a circumstance in which EPA could\nexercise this authority.\nBut you also said -- and I -- I assume you said\ncorrectly -- that later on that these kinds of obvious\nviolations are going to be rare.\nMR. FRANKLIN: Yes.\nQUESTION: And that leads me back to -- as I\nsaid, I guess, to Justice Kennedy's question, and that is\nthis.\nstatutory sections, there really isn't very much role for\nthem to play, and I can't imagine why Congress would have\nenacted separate order sections if all they were meant to\ndo is what you say.\nSo my question is, why -- why doesn't your\nexplanation trivialize these two statutes to a point that\nis implausible?\nMR. FRANKLIN: They don't trivialize it, Your\nHonor. There are numerous Federal requirements that if a\nState does not meet those express statutory requirements,\nthen EPA can step in. There are ambient air quality\nstandards --\nQUESTION: And -- and EPA could do the same\nthing by following the State review process, couldn't it?\nMR. FRANKLIN: It --\nQUESTION: It could go in and say, look, they\nforgot X. They refused to apply Y.\nMR. FRANKLIN: But if its contention is one that\nthe statute gives the discretion but it was simply not\nexercised in the proper way that we would have exercised\nit, that is not a contention that Congress wanted EPA to\nbe able to resolve by fiat.\nQUESTION: Well, but I mean, that's -- that's\nthe question. I mean, the -- the difficulty I'm having is\nthat if -- if it is unlikely that Congress would have\nprovided this entire separate track simply to deal with\nthe problems that you say the track is meant to deal with,\nthen it is not so implausible at all that Congress would\nhave intended the statute to be applied as it has been\napplied here.\nMR. FRANKLIN: I think it is implausible because\nCongress made clear that EPA's authority was circumscribed\nto enforcing the -- the statutory requirements, and those\nrequirements were met in this case.\nIf I might reserve the balance of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Franklin.\nMr. Hungar, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. HUNGAR\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. HUNGAR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nPetitioner's fundamental contention is that once\na State issues a determination of best available control\ntechnology so labeled, no matter how arbitrary, factually\nunsupported, or unreasoned it may be, the Federal\nGovernment has no enforcement authority under the act to\ntake actions to stop the invalid permit from taking\neffect. Nothing in the text, structure, or history of the\nact supports the implausible contention that Congress\nintended to immunize arbitrary, unreasoned State decision\nmaking from Federal enforcement review.\nQUESTION: Well, I don't think he is -- I mean,\nmy impression of their argument was, yes, you can review\nthat. What you have go is through the State procedure and\nthen after you go through the State procedures, in fact,\nyou can go into a Federal court and have them apply the\nState review procedure if you want.\nMR. HUNGAR: Yes, but --\nQUESTION: I think that's what their argument\nwas, or at least one of their arguments.\nMR. HUNGAR: But, Your Honor, Congress enacted a\nFederal regulatory scheme and a Federal enforcement\nscheme.\nQUESTION: That's a different thing. Maybe\nyours is better, but you can't say they're leaving it\nwithout review. So I just wanted to --\nMR. HUNGAR: Review only under State law, Your\nHonor, and -- and our point is that Congress has enacted a\ncomprehensive Federal regulatory scheme and authorized EPA\nto serve as a backstop to ensure compliance with all of\nthe requirements of the act, or this -- this portion of\nthe act.\nQUESTION: That's begging -- I mean, that --\nthat is exactly the point at issue, it seems to me. Why\nis -- why is it irrational to envision a scheme such as --\nsuch as the petitioners here propose, which is, look it,\nCongress set certain, absolute requirements? Ambient air\nquality, you know, shall be this. But as long as those\nrequirements are met, below that we also want each State\n-- each emission source in a State to be examined to see\nwhether it is using the best available technology.\nBut what constitutes the best available\ntechnology under the circumstances is a very difficult\nquestion. It involves issues of -- of the State economy,\nas well as scientific issues. We are content so long as\neach State meets the absolute standards that the statute\nsets forth. Below that standard, we're going to let each\nState decide whether the best available technology under\nall the circumstances is being used. That seems to me a\nperfectly sensible and rational system.\nMR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, the definition of best\navailable control technology does not simply leave it to\nthe discretion of the decision maker, the unbridled\ndiscretion, to -- to select whatever it wants --\nQUESTION: Well, let's see what it says.\nMR. HUNGAR: It imposes meaningful constraints,\nYour Honor. Maximum emissions reduction that is\nachievable taking into account specified factors. A\nfailure, for example --\nQUESTION:\nthe first part of it. It doesn't say which is the best\navailable. It says the best of means and emission\nlimitation, best on the maximum degree of production of\neach pollutant subject to regulation under this chapter,\nblah, blah, blah, blah, which the permitting authority on\na case-by-case basis, taking into account these various\nmethods, determines to be the BACT. I mean, there it is.\nWhich the permitting authority determines.\nMR. HUNGAR: Yes, Your Honor. Two responses.\nNumber one, the -- the United States Code is\nfilled with examples of instances in which Congress\ndefines that it's the initial decision maker for a\nparticular question, but that is not generally taken to\nmean that delegation of absolute, unreviewable discretion.\nNumber two -- particularly when, as here, the statute\nimposes --\nQUESTION: But they're -- they're not saying --\nMR. HUNGAR: -- these constraints on the\ndecision maker.\nQUESTION: They're not saying that the\ndiscretion is unreviewable. They're just saying it's\nreviewable in a different manner than you think it is.\nMR. HUNGAR: They're saying that it's not\nreviewable as a matter of Federal law, Your Honor, and\nthat is what we're talking about here.\nQUESTION: Well, Federal -- are you aware of any\nState in the United States that does not have in its law\nthe requirement that its own agencies have to act\nrationally, that they can't act arbitrarily, abuse of\ndiscretion?\nMR. HUNGAR: I don't know, Your Honor, but --\nQUESTION: Well, I don't know of any either.\nMR. HUNGAR: But I know there are --\nQUESTION: And so that seems to be the same\nstandard that you argue that applies, and since there is\nno State that doesn't have that standard and no Federal\nGovernment that doesn't have it, we all have the same\nstandard. And that's why I think the argument does boil\ndown to which courts will apply it: the Federal court as\na matter of Federal law, or the Federal court as a matter\nof State law.\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, number one, I believe various\nStates have standing requirements that may be more\nrestrictive than those applicable under -- under Federal\nlaw.\nNumber two, the question is not merely which\ncourt will apply it but whether the -- the comprehensive\nadministrative authority confirmed on EPA to issue orders\nand not just the administrative orders at issue here, but\nalso the possibility of the -- of the administrative\nsanctions proceeding, which is separately provided by\nCongress in subsection (d) of 7413. Under petitioner's\ninterpretation, none of that would apply as long as\nthere's some element of discretion in the State's\ndecision. And it's simply not correct to say that BACT is\nthe only area in which the States enjoy some range of\njudgment or -- or in which there may be factual\ndisputes --\nQUESTION: It's some range of judgment. This is\nthe only provision that reads this categorically. I -- I\n-- which the permitting authority on a case-by-case basis\ndetermines.\nMR. HUNGAR: With respect, Your Honor, that's\nnot correct. Under -- under 7475(a)(3), which is the\n--the subparagraph prior to (a)(4) which imposes the BACT\nrequirement -- 7475(a)(3) is on -- I believe it's on 13a\nof the appendix to the gray brief. (a)(3) is -- is where\nthe -- is where the requirement that permittees meet other\nprovisions of the act such as the national ambient air\nquality standards and the increments.\nQUESTION: Tell me again where -- where --\nMR. HUNGAR: 7475(a)(3) on -- on 13a of the gray\nbrief appendix.\nQUESTION: On 13a.\nMR. HUNGAR: Yes.\nQUESTION: (4). Right?\nMR. HUNGAR: (4) is the BACT requirement. (3)\nis the national ambient air quality standards, other\nstandards of performance, the increments, and so forth.\nAll of the other requirements that -- that petitioner\nconcedes EPA should be able to enforce.\nBut if you turn -- and that (a)(3), in turn,\nreferences 7410 --\nQUESTION: (j).\nMR. HUNGAR: (j). 7410(j), which is on page 5a\nof the appendix, says that the permittee must -- the\npermit applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of\nthe permitting agency that all of these requirements have\nbeen met.\nSo under petitioner's interpretation, EPA's\nauthority to enforce all of -- all of the requirements of\nthe prevention of significant deterioration program would\nbe eviscerated to the extent there is discretion in those\ndeterminations and there is necessarily discretion. All\nof those other determinations require modeling, and to do\nmodeling, you have to determine what the inputs to the\nmodel are and you have to determine what the boundaries of\nthe ambient air area are, and if EPA cannot review any of\nthose discretionary decisions, it has essentially no\nauthority to do anything under this act except to require\nthat permitting authorities mouth the words of the\nstatutory definition. And that's it. And if that's\nall --\nQUESTION: Well, could -- could we get specific\nin this case? Looking at the Clean Air Act provision,\n169(3), which the permitting authority on a case-by-case\nbasis determines is achievable, after considering economic\nimpacts and other costs. Now, EPA says what's wrong.\nAlaska did make a determination, did it not?\nMR. HUNGAR: Alaska made a determination, but it\ndid not determine best available control technology within\nthe constraints of the statute, and the -- and the\neasiest --\nQUESTION: Well, how so? Let -- looking at the\nstatute, what provision did they fail to comply with?\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, they -- they didn't determine\nthe maximum degree that is achievable, taking into account\nthese factors, because the only basis for their rejection\nof the best technology selective control -- I mean,\nselective catalytic reduction was their reliance on\neconomic impacts, and specifically what they said was the\nforemost consideration -- the foremost consideration --\nfor their rejection of SCR, according to the State -- this\nis at page 208 of the joint appendix -- was impact of the\ncost of SCR on the competitiveness of the mine. And\nyet --\nQUESTION: What's wrong -- what's wrong with\nthat?\nQUESTION: And --\nMR. HUNGAR: What's wrong with that, Your Honor,\nis that on the previous page, on page 207 of the joint\nappendix, the State admits that because Cominco refused to\nprovide the financial information, they had no basis for\nmaking a judgment. That's a -- they quote judgment.\nQUESTION: Well, let me just ask you --\nMR. HUNGAR: They couldn't make a judgment about\nthat very issue.\nQUESTION: -- a technical point. Suppose at the\nend of the day -- and I'm not sure this is what we would\ndo or that I would favor, but suppose at the end of the\nday we agree EPA had authority to issue a stop order and\nthat it was proper. Could Alaska then go back and say,\nwell, okay, we're going to run through this drill once\nmore and do consideration of costs, and they're now going\nto allow Low NOx's instead based on that? Now, can they\ndo that? Is that all right?\nMR. HUNGAR: On -- on an appropriate record,\nabsolutely they could do that. And -- and EPA made it\nclear --\nQUESTION: So this wouldn't be the end of the\nday.\nMR. HUNGAR: That's correct. The State has the\n-- has discretion, but that discretion is not unlimited,\nand that is the point that --\nQUESTION: Can you tell me, Mr. Hungar --\nQUESTION: Speaking of it's appropriate --\nQUESTION: Can you tell me, Mr. Hungar, whether\nor not as -- as a matter of past practice, the EPA has\nintervened in any State administrative review proceedings\nin State courts?\nMR. HUNGAR: In State court, no, I don't believe\nso, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: All right. Has -- has it gone to\nFederal court under -- was it -- 1345, the United States\nDistrict?\nMR. HUNGAR: I don't believe so. It's an\nunsettled question I think whether 1345 would authorize\nEPA to --\nQUESTION: So the EPA has been consistent in\nsaying that it -- it is not in any case like this or with\nparallels to this gone through an administrative review\nprocess. It's simply issued a stop order?\nMR. HUNGAR: That's correct. The EPA has\nconsistently maintained and -- and has -- has announced\nthis interpretation in a variety of administrative\ndocuments, including through notice -- in the course of\nnotice and comment rulemakings and in the very orders in\nthis case. EPA has consistently taken the position for 20\nyears, at least, that it has authority under these\nstatutes, 7477 and 7413(a)(5) to do exactly what it did in\nthis case --\nQUESTION: That doesn't surprise me. You -- you\nmention on an appropriate record. That is one of the\nthings that makes me uneasy about the -- the resolution\nthat you propose.\nWhen this thing comes to a Federal court of\nappeals, which is not a fact-finding court, it comes on\nthe basis of nothing except EPA's order. We -- we do not\nknow the record before the administrative agency on the\nbasis of which the EPA acted. Now, if you had gone\nthrough the State administrative procedure, that record\nwould have been examined. That would -- the action in\nquestion would have been the action of the State agency\nand -- and you would examine the record before the State\nagency.\nBut -- but the administrative action we're\nreviewing here is not the State administrative action.\nIt's your administrative action, and the only relevant\nrecord is the record before the EPA. And -- and as I said\nbefore, the court of appeals ends up determining whether\nit was arbitrary and capricious for the EPA to determine\nthat the State agency was arbitrary or capricious.\nYou combine those two weird factors and -- and\nI'm just dubious that this is the kind of review that\nCongress intended.\nMR. HUNGAR: Taking the last part of your\nquestion first, Your Honor, there's nothing particularly\nstrange about an appellate court reviewing a prior\ndetermination of whether an agency decision was arbitrary\nand capricious. Courts do that all the time --\nQUESTION: Square.\nMR. HUNGAR: -- under the APA when a district\ncourt -- no. If a -- a district court determines whether\na -- whether the -- an agency decision was arbitrary and\ncapricious, the court of appeals, to the extent there are\ndiscretionary issues, they would review deferentially, but\nreally as a general matter, it's going to boil down to a\nquestion of law, which is I think the case here, which is\nwas it -- was it or was it not arbitrary and capricious\nfor the State of Alaska to do what it did here.\nFundamentally that is a question of law upon review of the\nEPA's determination.\nQUESTION: All right. It's a question of\njudgment and whose judgment gets some weight.\nIn respect to that, what I'd really suddenly\nstirred up again here -- suppose we reach the second\nquestion. Suppose we reach the question of whether Alaska\ndid, in fact, do something that was pretty unreasonable,\nand suppose I accept your argument that this was totally\nunreasonable to say that they didn't have to put in this\nspecial technology because of cost when Alaska didn't even\nknow what the cost was. That's about like the fan.\nThat's close to the ceiling fan. That's what you're\narguing.\nBut then they've made another argument, and the\nother argument is bothering me a lot more. And that is\nthat the EPA has taken the position that you have to put\nthis extra special converter or whatever on number 17,\neven if the consequence of that, because of the\ninteraction of the regs and their desires with number 2\nand number 6, is more pollution. Now, that does bother me\nbecause it seems to me a State agency that's trying to get\na result that is less polluting is not acting arbitrarily\nand capriciously except in rather unusual circumstances.\nNow, what do I do with that argument? Does that\nmean if I accept everything you say -- but that worries me\n-- I should send it back for another determination of\nwhether this really is arbitrary and capricious? What\nshould I do with that argument?\nMR. HUNGAR:\nnot justify its final permit decision on that rationale.\nThe State is now arguing in its brief in this Court --\nQUESTION: That's a -- that's one point. I've\ngot that point. That's a kind of technical point in my\nmind. In other words, Alaska might really be polluting\nmore, but because of this sort of which paper they wrote\nwhich in, we should just accept it. Now, I got that\nargument. But is there any other?\nMR. HUNGAR: But it's more than that, Your\nHonor. The State agency expressly rejected that analysis,\nrefused to conduct that analysis, refused to base its\npermit decision on that approach because it agreed it was\ncontrary to the requirements of the act. That's at page\n199 of the joint appendix. The State agency said we are\n-- we agree that's not an appropriate way in which to\nanalyze the BACT question. That's consistent with EPA's\nregulations, in answer to Justice Ginsburg --\nQUESTION: Yes. I asked that question before.\nMR. HUNGAR: Yes.\nQUESTION: And -- and it is a question of\ninterpretation of the text of this statute. I thought\nthat EPA was taking an anti-bubble approach, that it said,\nyou want to have generator 17. We look at generator 17\nand that's what the statute means by new source. I\nthought you were taking that view, but maybe you're not.\nMR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, and -- and Chevron\nitself actually discusses this, as you -- as you\nsuggested, but Chevron recognizes that EPA has -- has\nconstrued the -- has applied the bubble concept or not\ndifferently. It -- the bubble concept applies at the\ninitial stage in determining whether a modification has to\ngo through prevention of significant deterioration\nanalysis.\nBut once -- once that -- once it is determined\nthat the total emissions are going to increase so that the\n-- the modification does have to go through that analysis,\nit is then -- the bubble concept no longer applies and the\nanalysis is done on an individual basis. That's set forth\nin EPA regulations promulgated through a notice and\ncomment rulemaking --\nQUESTION: That's what I thought. So it isn't a\nquestion of just loose, arbitrary, and capricious. EPA is\ntaking the position that you look at generator 17 because\nyou've already made the determination that adding a\ngenerator, modifying another one, is going to add to the\npollution.\nMR. HUNGAR: As a matter of law, what EPA has\ndetermined in -- in exercising in -- its rulemaking\nauthority is that the statute requires that once it's\ndetermined that the BACT analysis must be made, it must be\nmade on an individual unit basis, which is exactly what\nthe State ultimately did here. The State conceded that is\ncorrect as EPA's regulations state. Only in its recent --\nin this Court is the State now trying to back away from\nthat.\nQUESTION: Mr. Hungar, can I ask you, going back\nto Justice Scalia's question earlier, is there a\nsignificant difference in the record before us in this\nproceeding than what the record would contain if they had\nfollowed the route of applying a review of the Alaska\norder through the State system?\nMR. HUNGAR: We don't believe so, Your Honor.\nThe EPA gave the State ample authority and Cominco ample\n-- I mean, ample opportunity to place in the record\nwhatever materials they wanted --\nQUESTION: That was my impression, the record\nreally was the same no matter which way you went.\nMR. HUNGAR: The Ninth Circuit, when this case\nwas in -- in the court of appeals, issued an order\ndirecting the preparation of a record and asking the\nparties what -- to -- to address whether the record was\ncomplete or not. Cominco and the State said the record\nwas sufficiently complete. The only things that -- that\nthe State identified --\nQUESTION:\nwhole State record --\nMR. HUNGAR: I don't know that the whole --\nQUESTION: -- before the State agency?\nMR. HUNGAR: The -- the administrative fills a\nbox. It contains internal ADEC communications, memoranda,\nanalysis, the Cominco application. It's quite detailed.\nQUESTION: But in any -- I take your answer is\nthey can put in the entire State record to go before the\ncourt of appeals. Is that the answer?\nMR. HUNGAR: Absolutely. And -- and again,\nunder Overton Park and under this case's precedents, if\nthe EPA record is incomplete for some reason, the Court\ncan remand it to the agency for -- for further -- to\ncomplete the record. But that doesn't -- that doesn't\nsuggest that EPA doesn't have the authority to act. It\nmerely suggests that EPA needs to exercise that authority\nin a procedurally correct manner.\nQUESTION: It goes back to a question that has\nnow dropped out of the case entirely it seems. In the\nNinth Circuit, I think EPA was arguing this is not a final\norder. You have to wait until we go into court and the\ncourt that we would go into is a district court where a\nfull record could be developed.\nI take it you have now abandoned that argument\nand seen the error of your ways, and now you accept that\nthis is final. What led you to change?\nMR. HUNGAR: Upon further consideration of this\nCourt's more recent precedents in the -- in the area of\nfinality, the -- the Whitman case and Bennett against\nSpear and given the particular circumstances of this case\nwhere the agency -- where EPA was not simply issuing an\norder to someone saying you're violating preexisting\nrequirements of the act, but was in fact changing the\nstatus quo and stating that a -- a permit that had been\nissued by the State that allowed construction could not\ntake effect, in those circumstances we -- we concluded\nthat this Court's precedents regarding final orders are\nsatisfied and that this is indeed a final order because it\nimposes legal obligations, new legal obligations, on\nCominco.\nQUESTION: Mr. Hungar, you -- you've just told\nus that the reviewing court can have the full State record\nbefore it when it makes its determination. What about EPA\nwhen it makes its determination, when it issues its order?\nWhat -- what does it have in front of it? It doesn't have\nto have anything, does it?\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, it has to have evidence\nsufficient to make a finding that the State is not\ncomplying with the requirements of the act, Your Honor.\nQUESTION:\nhave to do that on the basis of the record presented to\nthe agency, does it?\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, it's difficult --\nQUESTION: Did it in this case? Is that -- is\nthat what it did? Did it review the agency record here?\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, in this case it's -- although\nthey had extensive record materials before them, the --\nthe flaw in the State's decision making is apparent on the\nface of the State's own decision. As I said before, pages\n207 and 208 of the joint appendix revealed that the State\nadmits it doesn't have factual support for what it views\nas the foremost consideration justifying its decision.\nBut -- but if EPA issued -- issued an order\nunder this act without -- without the record materials in\nfront of it, and -- and had -- therefore, had no basis for\nissuing an order, a court of appeals could set it aside.\nQUESTION: Can you tell me? I want to be very\nclear on what I didn't hear in answer to my question.\nWhat I was concerned about -- and I understand your legal\narguments, but I was concerned about their claim. If you\nwin this case, what it means is more expensive technology\ngoes onto number 17. They run number 17 less. They run 2\nand 6 more, and the net result in Alaska is more\npollution. Now, you haven't said -- I haven't heard you\nsay, no, that's wrong.\nreach it. There -- there -- they didn't make the claim in\nthe right place with the right words. And I want to give\nyou a chance to say, no, that's wrong, if it is wrong.\nMR. HUNGAR: I think it is wrong, Your Honor.\nIt is -- it is theoretically possible that if they\ninstalled this expensive generator and spent millions of\ndollars on it and never once turned it on and they ran all\nof their other -- other generators 100 percent of the time\nwithout ever stopping them, it is theoretically possible\nthat there could be slightly more pollution. However,\nthat is highly implausible, number one, and number two,\nthere is no finding by the State that that is in fact what\nwould happen. This is merely argument in their appellate\nbriefs.\nAnd what is clear on the record is that under --\nif the State had adopted SCR as BACT, the total cap on\nemissions allowable by this facility would be hundreds of\ntons lower than the cap that was imposed by the State.\nThat's undisputed and perfectly clear that SCR would\nresult in a total emissions cap far lower than the one\nthat the State wanted to impose. And so the State's\nargument, unsupported by any findings, is that -- is the\nsheer speculation that Cominco would spend millions of\ndollars to install a generator that it would never use.\nWe submit that's highly improbable.\nQUESTION: So, do I -- I understand you to say\nthat they would be forced -- I take it you're --\nimplicitly you're saying they'd be forced to use this\ngenerator because the use of this generator would be the\nonly way that they, in fact, could comply with the cap?\nMR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor. If -- if they\ninstalled this generator and if -- if selective catalytic\nreduction were deemed to be required, the total -- there's\na total emissions cap of 3,878 tons in the State's permit.\nQUESTION: For --\nMR. HUNGAR: For all seven generators.\nQUESTION: -- for this -- all seven. Okay.\nMR. HUNGAR: And if -- and that includes MG-17\nunder -- using the Low NOx. Under Low NOx, MG-17 -- its\noutput is 531 tons if it's used throughout the year, 531\ntons. Under SCR it would output -- put out only a tenth\nof that at full capacity. So the total cap under BACT\nwould be hundreds of tons lower, slightly less than 3,500\ntons.\nQUESTION: The cap -- the cap wouldn't be lower.\nThe total emissions would be lower. The cap would --\nMR. HUNGAR: The -- the total emissions cap\nwould be lower. The -- the company is free to -- to\nchoose how to -- how to meet the cap, how to -- which\nmachines to operate at what times, as long as it doesn't\nexceed that cap. But the cap is determined by adding to\nthe preexisting cap total for the other six generators the\nadditional amount that is deemed permissible to --\nQUESTION: So -- so the answer is it would\nprobably -- most probably use the new generator.\nMR. HUNGAR: Absolutely.\nQUESTION: Theoretically it wouldn't have to.\nMR. HUNGAR: Correct.\nYour Honor, we -- Your Honors, we submit that\nCongress clearly intended EPA to exercise meaningful\nenforcement authority in the prevention of significant\ndeterioration program. Indeed, it specifically authorized\nin that very context EPA to issue the types of orders at\nissue here. We, therefore, ask that the judgment of the\ncourt of appeals be affirmed.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Hungar.\nMr. Franklin, you have 3 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN S. FRANKLIN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. FRANKLIN: Thank you, Your Honor.\nResponding to Justice O'Connor's colloquy with\ncounsel as to whether EPA could simply remand the case and\nthen there might be a back and forth that could take --\nQUESTION: I didn't ask if it was -- could\nremand it.\nto go through the drill that EPA said it didn't do before\nand that the State said it didn't have the information to\nenable it to do.\nMR. FRANKLIN: And -- and that is precisely the\nproblem in our view because EPA, if the Court upholds its\nauthority in this case, can act by fiat at any time it\nwants on the basis of any information that it deems\nrelevant, even after a permit has gone through the entire\nState process, even after it has become final under State\nlaw, and even after the source may have invested millions\nof dollars in the technology. Then EPA could step in.\nWhat we are saying here -- and, Justice Breyer,\nwe don't care which court --\nQUESTION: Well, there are courts -- there are\ncourts with doctrines that would not allow such\ninequitable conduct. I mean, you brought up it could be\nyears and years later; anytime, 17 years later, EPA could\nwake up. The answer to that was that no court would give\nan ear to EPA having just slept on --\nMR. FRANKLIN: With respect --\nQUESTION: -- on the situation.\nMR. FRANKLIN: With respect, Your Honor, EPA's\nenforcement authority in this case is mandatory. Under\nsection 167, they shall take appropriate measures to stop\nconstruction.\nauthority in this case, they have to exercise it at any\npoint.\nAnd, Justice Breyer, we don't care which court\nconducts the review. We care that a court does and not\nEPA acting at any time by fiat according to any\ninformation that it may have at -- at -- on the basis of\nwhat it thinks may or may not be reasonable or\nunreasonable.\nThe point of the matter is, is that the State\nprocedures are fully adequate to address any concerns that\nEPA has raised here, and its injecting itself into the\nprocess, disrupting the orderly process -- and, Justice\nStevens, the record would be different and it would be\ndifferent because Alaska law allows, when a party has\nproperly objected, for a de novo administrative hearing,\nat which the agency is allowed to present additional\nevidence, witnesses, and further refine and clarify its\ndecision.\nIf there was any legitimate concern as to\nwhether the State's decision wasn't clear, as it should\nhave been, that is the manner in which it should have been\nresolved, through the administrative process. And we are\nconfident that it would have been resolved there, Justice\nO'Connor. That's where the back and forth would have\noccurred, not in the manner of here where we're now 4\nyears later and we still don't have a decision as to what\ntechnology this company can use.\nAnd finally, Your Honors, the -- the point of\nthe matter is there's no legitimate dispute here that the\nresult of Alaska's decision is cleaner air and that cannot\nbe unreasonable.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nFranklin.\n"
