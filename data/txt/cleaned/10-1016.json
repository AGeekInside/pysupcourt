The Court\nof Appeals of Maryland.\nMr. Foreman.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL L. FOREMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. FOREMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThe propriety of any section 5 legislation\nis judged by in reference to the historical perspective\nthat it reflects, and that historical perspective is\nvery clear in -- and it's set very clearly by Congress\nand by this Court. It -- it is an unfortunate, long\nhistory of State-sponsored gender discrimination. And\nthose -- that discrimination embodies gender-based\nstereotypes that took a very firm hold in the employment\narea, where women had difficulty obtaining employment\nand holding employment. And this Court in a litany of\ncases recognized these gender-based stereotypes as -- as\nan improper assumption about women's abilities.\nIn Frontiero v. Richardson, it rejected this\nissue that women's mission were to be women -- to be\nwives and mothers; Stanton v. Stanton, that women were\nto be the homemaker and men the breadwinner, and --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Foreman, I guess\nthe question in this case is what this particular\nstatutory provision has to do with gender discrimination\nand the history of gender discrimination, whether\nCongress was aiming to eradicate gender discrimination\nthrough this provision or whether it was trying to do\nsomething else entirely.\nMR. FOREMAN: And it was directly attempting\nto address these gender-based stereotypes in a couple\ndifferent ways as a practical matter. At that time,\nwhen an employer saw a woman, they didn't necessarily\njust see a worker. They saw a person that could become\npregnant, and worked on these gender-based stereotypes,\nthat that woman would either become pregnant, would be\ndisabled because of pregnancy-related disabilities but,\nin any event, was a least -- least attractive employee.\nAnd the Family and Medical Leave Act\naddresses that specifically in its purposes section. It\nspecifically says that is intended to promote the equal\nopportunity for women and men pursuant to the Equal\nProtection Clause.\nBut more specific to the self-care\nprovision, Congress made it very clear what they were\nattempting to do. If you move to the \"findings\"\nsection, first, in finding number 6, they address --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where -- where are\nyou reading from, counsel?\nMR. FOREMAN: I am reading from Appendix A\nto the brief, and it is -- that employment standards\nthat apply to one gender only have a serious potential\nfor encouraging employers to discriminate against\nemployees and applicants of employment who are of that\ngender.\nThat's the negative inference argument that\nwe make in our brief. But even more to the point, if\nyou move to the purpose sections at appendix 2,\npage appendix 2, it specifically is intended to minimize\nthe potential for employment discrimination on the basis\nof sex by ensuring generally that leave is available for\neligible medical reasons, including maternity-related\ndisabilities and for compelling family reasons, and to\nensure equal protection under the law.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, following up on\nJustice Kagan's question, I have -- I have difficulty\nseeing how providing 12 weeks of leave for self-care for\nboth men and women affects the incentive of an employer\nwho we will assume has an inclination to discriminate\nagainst women based on the possibility that a woman\napplicant for employment may become pregnant. I just\ndon't see how that would affect the incentives of -- of\nan employer in that situation.\nMR. FOREMAN: The rationale of Congress at\nthat point was that they could have addressed this issue\nseveral different ways. They -- and they passed (A),\n(B), and (C) -- the birth of the child, the adoption of\nthe child, and the Family and Medical Leave Act --\nagainst -- again, addressing gender-based stereotypes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, (A) is not at issue,\nright?\nOkay. So, we're just dealing with (D),\nwhich concerns a serious health condition. So, you have\nan employer who is willing to discriminate on the basis\nof gender. The employer has two applicants for\nemployment, a man and a woman, and the employer says,\nwell, if I hire the man, he might take 12 weeks of leave\nfor a serious medical condition, and if I hire the\nwoman, she might take 12 weeks of leave for a serious\nmedical condition which might be something that either\nmen or women could get, or it also could be a sickness\nrelated to pregnancy.\nSo, there still is -- there still would be\nan incentive for this hypothetical employer to\ndiscriminate against the woman.\nMR. FOREMAN: But one of the things Congress\ntried to do is to take that incentive away.\nJUSTICE ALITO: How does it do that? That's\nwhat I'm -- I understand that, and it's a worthy\nobjective. I just don't understand how giving both men\nand women 12 weeks of leave for self-care affects the\nincentive.\nMR. FOREMAN: It affects the incentive by\nproviding -- it becomes the equal opportunity employer.\nIt evens the -- the ground. And the way it would do it\nis an employer, if you just have (A) through (C), can\nlook at an employee and, based upon gender stereotypes,\nwould make the assumption that the women, because of\nhistorically the role they were required to play, would\nbe taking all the leave under (A) and (B) and (C). And\nso, why would I even hire that woman in the first place?\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But women don't get sick\nless often than men, do they?\nMR. FOREMAN: No, absolutely.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So, you're just adding\nsomething to both sides of the balance, and it doesn't\naffect the employer's incentive. The employer still --\nthe -- the hypothetical discriminatory employer would\nstill say, well, women are going to be caregivers more\noften; so, I'm -- I'm going to not hire that person.\nMR. FOREMAN: But under (A), (B), and (C)\nafter the Family and Medical Leave, an employer would\nlook and say both men can take these now. And I think\nwe need to step back --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And that's why (A), (B), and\n(C) go to the problem, but what does (D) have to do with\nit? If you assume that both men and women get sick at\nan approximately equal rate -- maybe you don't assume\nthat -- but if you do, it doesn't seem to factor into\nthe employer's incentives in any way.\nMR. FOREMAN: There is nothing in the record\nthat demonstrates that there's a differential rate\nbetween the self-care rates for men and women. But the\nperception was that women, because of pregnancy, because\nof pregnancy-related disabilities, would in fact take\nmore leave. And so that I would look at a woman as an\nemployer and say she will become pregnant, she will take\nleave, she will be disabled. However, with (D) now, but\nthe man can take a -- a disability leave on the same\nbasis.\nAnd the hope of Congress was not that it\nwould happen immediately, but by the -- what would\nhappen is, with the application of family and medical\nleave, at some point men would be taking (A), (B), and\n(C), and, in fact, women and men would be taking family\nand medical self-care leave. I just --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Foreman, I think\neveryone has been trying to get you to focus on the\nhealth care sickness leave alone, and in the -- in the\nportions of the Act that this Court upheld, the Congress\nsaid there is this close association of women with\nchildren; we think it's going to be good for everybody\nif fathers recognize their responsibility for elderly\nparents, sick children, sick spouse. So, we -- we can\nsee the rationale, trying to change the stereotype,\ntrying to open up caregiving for both sexes.\nBut you have answered the question that\nwomen and men get sick; there's no -- there's no\ndisproportion. So, how do you tie that, just -- just\nthat part of the Act, where there -- there isn't the\nobvious association of women with childbearing? So, we\nextend the benefit to men so they'll be associated with\nchild care. There isn't that same link here, is there?\nMR. FOREMAN: I think it is the same linkage\ntrying to address -- it's addressing a difference there,\nbut it's addressing the linkage that women will in fact\ntake pregnancy-based leave or pregnancy-based\ndisabilities and, therefore, are less attractive, less\n-- employees, and that's what self-care was intended to\ndo.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So, you're saying -- let me\njust make sure I understand. You're saying that the --\nthat Congress is thinking that an employer actually does\nthink that women take more sick leave because women get\npregnant. And just as Congress was thinking about the\nemployer who thought women are going to take more family\nleave, you think Congress was thinking about the\nemployer who thinks women are also going to take more\nsick leave because of pregnancy?\nMR. FOREMAN: Absolutely, Your Honor. And\nin response to Justice Alito's question -- and I'm sorry\nif I gave a confusing response. There are two separate\nways of addressing that.\nYou can look at self-care as a stand-alone\nprovision, without (A), (B), and (C). Congress passed\njust self-care. In that case it would be responding to\nexactly that type of gender stereotype, and 12 weeks\nwould be a congruent and proportional response.\nThe other way to look at it is that's not\nthe way Congress passed the bill. They passed it as a\ncomprehensive response with (A), (B), and (C), and hence\n(D) then becomes a bit of an equalizer to take away this\nnegative incentive that only women would take (A), (B),\nand (C).\nSo, there's two separate ways that this\nCourt can get to the same conclusion, and that\nconclusion is that this is a congruent and proportional\nresponse to gender-based discrimination.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Do you have any evidence\nthat Congress in fact was thinking about either of these\ntwo things? Is there anything in the record that\nsuggests either of those two theories?\nMR. FOREMAN: Yes, there -- there is, Your\nHonor, and let me -- let me take the negative inference\nfirst, because I think looking at the statute as a\ncomprehensive makes sense -- is it was introduced -- and\nI'm reading from page 43. It's referenced on page 43 of\nour brief, that starting in 1987, National Women's\nPolitical Caucus testified, quote: \"My primary purpose\nis to stress that parental and medical leave are\ninseparable. In the words of the old song, 'You can't\nhave one without the other.'\"\nAnd the point she then later on to explain\nwas parental leave without medical leave would encourage\ndiscrimination against women of child-bearing age, who\nconstitute approximately 73 percent of all women in the\nworkforce. Employers would tend to hire men, who are\nmuch less likely to make this claim.\nFast forward to 1993 at the time of the\npassage of -- and this would be on page 42 of our merits\nbrief: \"A law providing special protection to women or\nany defined group, in addition to being inequitable,\nruns the risk of causing discrimination.\" The FML\naddresses this by addressing the needs of all workers,\navoids this risk. The FMLA is based on the guarantees\nof equal protection. So, it addresses that aspect of --\nit addresses that aspect.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counselor, I -- I take\nyour argument, but if you look at the legislative\nrecord, the reports, the findings, et cetera, and the\nstatements repeatedly by many congresspeople, there\nappears to be -- have been a dual motive for this\nprovision. They were, in fact, engaged in the question\nof discrimination against pregnant women. That was\nrecognized in Hibbs, and that's clear.\nBut with respect to this particular\nprovision, they were also concerned about economic\neffect that -- that happened to everyone, men and women,\nwho became disabled. And so, they appear to have had\ndual motivation. Part of the bill was gender-related;\npart of the bill seemed to be disability-related.\nWhat do -- how do we judge that kind of\nbill, where Congress may have been expanding the\nbenefits it's giving to people, not solely because of\ngender discrimination, but because of this desire to\naddress disability discrimination?\nMR. FOREMAN: Justice Sotomayor, I -- I\nthink the way you judge it is rely on what Congress's\nexpressed findings and provisions are. And to the\nextent this Court makes a determination that the FMLA is\nresponsive to gender-based discrimination, then how\nCongress chose to address that is congruent and\nproportional.\nThe fact that Congress may also have had\nother motives, that there was a concern with -- with\nfamilies and that families are -- benefit should not be\nused to undermine the fact that Congress indeed was\nacting pursuant to one of its broadest powers, section 5\nof the Fourteenth Amendment, and, therefore, that their\n-- their considered judgment is a congruent and\nproportional response.\nPart of -- part of the findings is clearly\nreflective of a fact that this covered both governmental\nemployers and private industry. So, there was reference\nto Commerce Clause type of -- of analysis, which my\ncolleagues raised repeatedly in their brief. But the\ncourt -- the Congress needed to do that because they\nwere regulating private employment but, at the same\ntime, recognized to the extent that we are -- are going\nto regulate State-based conduct.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, with respect to the\nCommerce Clause, could I ask you this: If we were to\ndisagree with you on the Fourteenth Amendment and hold\nthat it -- that Congress didn't validly abrogate State\nsovereign immunity with respect to subsection (D), would\nyour client still be able to seek reinstatement or other\ninjunctive relief?\nMR. FOREMAN: Justice Alito, I think what\nyou're -- and you'll clearly correct me if I am wrong,\nbut I think what you are responding to, is there an Ex\nparte Young action here that would be made -- able to be\nmade consistent with the Commerce Clause, under the\nCommerce Clause?\nAnd the answer is -- and I know that both\nJustice Kennedy and Justice Rehnquist, I think, in one\nof his dissents, pointed out in the Family and Medical\nLeave Act that the employee may not be left out in the\ndark because there is an Ex parte Young claim.\nA couple points on that --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Here the district court\ncompletely dismissed your FMLA claim, not just insofar\nas you sought damages. I -- I think you also sought\nreinstatement and other equitable relief, but the\ndistrict court dismissed it completely.\nMR. FOREMAN: That's right.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But you're not contesting\nthat, are you?\nMR. FOREMAN: We're not contesting it\nconsistent with any Ex parte Young claim. What the\ndistrict court did was say the claim is totally\ndismissed based upon Eleventh Amendment immunity.\nBut if I could try to respond to your\nquestion more specifically, this Court has never as a\nCourt held that Ex parte Young type of action is\navailable in this type of claim. Assuming that it --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Because this is for money\ndamages.\nMR. FOREMAN: Pardon?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Because this is for money\ndamages. Ex parte Young was just injunctive relief.\nThe Eleventh Amendment primarily protects the treasuries\nof the State against money damages.\nMR. FOREMAN: Correct.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's not Ex parte Young.\nMR. FOREMAN: Correct. But as -- as you\npointed out in your dissent in Hibbs, that Ex parte\nYoung may be available, but one of the concerns we have\nis, again, that the Court -- as a majority, the Court\nhas never held that. I believe that is in fact the\ncorrect interpretation of the law, that it would be\navailable for injunctive relief. However, the Court has\nnever defined the parameters of what an Ex parte Young\naction really gives a plaintiff, and that becomes very\nimportant in this case.\nJUSTICE ALITO: You said \"in this case.\"\nThat's basically what I'm asking. If we were to\ndisagree with you on the Fourteenth Amendment, are you\nasking us simply -- would we then simply affirm the\nFourth Circuit? Or would we have to -- would we have to\nmake some accommodation for the possibility that the\ndismissal of your claim, insofar as you sought\ninjunctive relief, may have been improper?\nMR. FOREMAN: I think you would have to make\nthat accommodation, but, with respect, Your Honor, I\nthink that would be an incorrect approach. And here's\n-- here's the reason why in Ex parte Young, a perfect\nexample --\nJUSTICE ALITO: I am really trying to be a\nlittle bit helpful to you. And I --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FOREMAN: And apparently I missed that,\nand I apologize.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Okay.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What relief did you ask\nfor? Damages, we know, and the -- you have to overcome\nthe Eleventh Amendment. Injunctive relief, you don't,\nbut did you ask for it?\nMR. FOREMAN: In the complaint itself, it\ndoes not ask for injunctive relief pursuant to the\nFamily and Medical Leave Act.\nJUSTICE ALITO: I thought you --\nMR. FOREMAN: There were combined claims --\nJUSTICE ALITO: I thought you did, but maybe\nI'm reading your complaint more generously than you read\nit yourself.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, you --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I'd go with Justice Alito\nhere.\nMR. FOREMAN: If that's your reading of it,\nwe will certainly accept your reading.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You must have asked for\nsuch other and further relief.\nMR. FOREMAN: But, again, back to the Ex\nparte Young, in the case Nelson v. The University of\nTennessee -- Texas, a -- the case that dealt with --\nexactly with this issue of abrogation of Eleventh\nAmendment immunity, and they found that there was valid\nabrogation of Eleventh Amendment immunity, the State of\nTexas -- then the court was required to address the Ex\nparte Young issue. And the State of Texas argued that\nreinstatement is not an appropriate remedy under Ex\nparte Young and that -- while the Fifth Circuit\nultimately rejected that, that is an argument that\nemployees would have to face: What are the parameters\nof Ex parte Young? And, more importantly, that is not\nthe remedy that Congress in their considered judgment\nbelieved was the appropriate remedy to address\ngender-based discrimination.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, Congress must have\nthought that giving the woman back her job was an\nimportant part. I mean, I thought the whole idea is she\nwasn't supposed to be fired. So, I think that the --\nthe relief, the non-monetary relief, is certainly\nimportant.\nMR. FOREMAN: It is extremely important, but\nCongress did not stop there. Congress decided it needed\nto take one step further and there needed to be monetary\nrelief. And I think Mr. Coleman's case illustrates\nexactly why.\nHere Mr. Coleman exercised his rights that\nwere supposedly guaranteed him under the Family and\nMedical Leave Act, and indeed under a State law, and the\nState of Maryland fired him, and he is out of work. And\nwhat is the disincentive for the State to not do the\nsame thing the next time if the only thing that you can\nget is possibly injunctive relief prohibiting them from\ndoing that in the future and maybe reinstatement 2 or 3\nyears down the line? Employees at that point cannot put\ntheir lives on hold. They have a duty to go out and try\nto mitigate, try to find another job.\nWhat's an employer to do? And Congress said\nthere needs to be more. We passed Title VII to try to\naddress gender-based discrimination, the Pregnancy\nDiscrimination Act, but there were still voids. And the\nFamily and Medical Leave Act attempts to fill those\nvoids, and one of those voids is try to provide a\nmonetary incentive so that the State of Maryland and\nprivate employers will in fact comply with the law.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: When you -- when you --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I go -- I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: When you say you're\nconcerned about a disincentive to hire women, but the\nPregnancy Discrimination Act makes that unlawful. So,\nif an employer decides I don't want to hire women of\nchild-bearing age, that is an out-and-out violation of\nthe Pregnancy Discrimination Act, isn't it?\nMR. FOREMAN: That is, Your Honor, but the\nPregnancy Discrimination Act did not fill the other gap\nwhich the Family and Medical --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you're relying on the\nincentive -- the disincentive to hire women of\nchild-bearing age. The law protects the woman of child-\nbearing age by saying, Employer, you can't refuse to\nhire her, promote her, and all the rest because of\npregnancy.\nMR. FOREMAN: It -- well, what the Pregnancy\nDiscrimination Act provided was that you needed to treat\npregnancy-related disabilities as you would other\nshort-term disabilities. So, if an employer decided not\nto provide --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm just asking you\nabout -- your -- your argument rests on an employer\nacting unlawfully, you see. He won't hire -- we have to\ngive them medical leave, to everyone, because otherwise\nthe employer won't hire women. And that's -- the\nquestion I'm asking is, you are assuming that the\nemployer will break the law by refusing to hire women\nthat -- of child-bearing age?\nMR. FOREMAN: I don't want to make that\nassumption in my incentive argument. I was using Mr.\nColeman as an example of why Congress could have made a\ndetermination that monetary relief would be appropriate\nin the Family and Medical Leave Act.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But I -- your argument to\na large extent depends -- or you say Congress did this\nbecause they wanted to eliminate or at least reduce one\nkind of discrimination against women in the job market.\nMR. FOREMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And that -- that\ndiscrimination was refusing to hire women of child-\nbearing age. Well, they couldn't do it out and out\nbecause that would be a violation of the law. So, is\nCongress having in mind discrimination that is under --\nunder the radar screen, that it's going to go on even\nthough it's unlawful?\nMR. FOREMAN: I -- I don't think that was\nCongress's intent, and that that's not what was\nreflected. I think, again, they were trying to address\nit on two separate levels: one, the gender-based\ndiscrimination, the gender stereotype that women simply\nbecome less attractive; and in the broader statute, to\nprevent the negative inference so that all -- that\nultimately where we would get in society is the ability\nto take pregnancy-related leave, other leave, would not\nbe viewed as a negative inference running against women,\nand, therefore, women ultimately would become a\nnonissue.\nAnd I see the light's on. So, if I could\nreserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Howard.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN B. HOWARD, JR.,\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. HOWARD: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nIn order to affirm in this case, the Court\nneed go no further than to distinguish Hibbs, and we\nthink Hibbs is readily distinguishable. And I'd like to\nhighlight four principal --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Need go no further? I'm\nsorry. I -- I didn't --\nMR. HOWARD: I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg.\nNeed go no further than simply to distinguish Hibbs.\nAnd we think there are at least four distinctions that\nwe'd like -- I'd like to highlight today. The first is\none that's -- Justice Kagan, your question goes to,\nwhich is subsections (A), (B), and (C) are all related\nin some fashion to women's roles with respect to work\nand family. Subsection (D) really does not speak to\nthat purpose.\nAnd I think my second sort of distinction I\nwould point to --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: If I could just --\nMR. HOWARD: Yes.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: -- stop you there, Mr.\nHoward, for a second, as I took from Mr. Foreman\nsomething that I hadn't understood from his briefs --\nmaybe I just missed it -- which is that he's making a\nkind of analogous argument, that, just as in the -- in\nthe prior provisions of the Act, employers thought of\nwomen as caregivers and the response of Congress was to\nprovide a gender-neutral leave benefit that had both --\nthat both women and men were eligible for.\nSo here, employers think of women as needing\nmore medical leave because of pregnancy, and the\nresponse of Congress is to provide gender-neutral sick\nleave. So, what is your response to that argument?\nMR. HOWARD: Congress, Justice Kagan, did\nnot I think take that stereotype or perception that Mr.\nForeman referred to into account. And I'd specifically\npoint the Court to page 21 of our brief, where we cite\nsome Bureau of Labor Statistics studies indicating that\nmen and women at the time took roughly the same amount\nof sick leave. In fact, Mr. Foreman has conceded as\nmuch. And that same study projects that men and women\nwill take roughly the same amount of time after the\nenactment of the FMLA --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But there certainly\nwas -- there was certainly much conversation and\ntestimony that, whether they in fact took the same\namount of leave time or not, that women who were\npregnant or were perceived as capable of getting\npregnant were hired less frequently because,\nsubjectively, the employers thought that they were more\nlikely to take the time.\nSo, frankly, for years there was questions\nabout whether law firms were hiring young -- not hiring\nyoung women because they feared they would leave in the\nmiddle of a big case or something else. We all know\nthose stories. So, it is sort of common knowledge in\nmany ways, but there was plenty of testimony related to\nthat.\nSo, assume that that was Congress's\nperception, because it was supported by the record or as\nmuch of the record as Hibbs recognized as adequate.\nWhere does that leave your argument?\nMR. HOWARD: Well, I would make a couple of\npoints in response to that, Justice Sotomayor. First,\nthe Pregnancy Discrimination Act was already in place.\nAnd so, to the extent there were perceptions that\nemployers might discriminate based on pregnancy\ndisabilities, that would be unlawful under Title VII as\namended by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act.\nAnd the fact that -- and you are quite right\nthat there is a fair amount of discussion in the\nlegislative record, although I think it's less of a\npredominant theme than the concern for job security for\nworking families, but there certainly is discussion\nabout pregnancy discrimination and pregnancy disability\nas a type of illness.\nBut we again would note that this is valid\nCommerce Clause legislation. And so, to the extent that\nkind of discrimination was occurring and leave was being\ndenied or women were suffering adverse consequences in\nthe workplace as a result of pregnancy discrimination,\nthey could enforce the 12 weeks through a Title VII\naction.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: They couldn't -- the\nPregnancy Discrimination Act says that you have to treat\npregnancy like any other disability. So, if they're not\ngiving anybody any leave for anything, they don't have\nto give any leave; not 12 weeks, not 1 day. And that's\nwhat -- that's the gap that this legislation fills. It\nsays, yes, you do have to provide leave for women who\nhave disabling conditions, including pregnancy, but then\nyou have to give that to men as well. You can't reserve\nthat for the one sex. So, it was the gap in the\nPregnancy Discrimination Act that this -- this was\nreferring to.\nMR. HOWARD: Yes, I agree, Justice Ginsburg,\nbut the gap that existed was the absence of a guaranteed\nperiod of leave. In other words, it was the absence of\na substantive entitlement, and so -- to a certain amount\nof leave. And, in effect, the gap that was being filled\nserved as prophylaxis for Title VII but not for\nconstitutional violations. Now --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Assume for the sake of\nargument that for the -- the applicants for particular\nprovisions -- particular positions, I should say --\nwhere the applicants are typically of a certain age, men\ntend to take less sick leave than women, because women\nalso take sick leave for pregnancy-related illnesses.\nSo, giving everybody 12 weeks eliminates the -- the\npossibility that women -- women who will be -- want to\ntake additional -- will want to take more sick leave\nwill be fired because they exceed the amount of sick\nleave allowed by the employer for everybody. Now, isn't\nthat connected to eliminating discrimination in\nemployment?\nMR. HOWARD: Justice Alito, I think that one\ncould argue that that is connected with eliminating\npregnancy disability discrimination. It's also\nconnected to the purposes of (A), (B), and (C). I think\nthat the principal reason why employers do view\npotential hires as -- when they're women, as likely to\ntake a lot of time off I think goes more to the family\ncaretaking provisions, and I think that's largely\nreflected in the record.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, I don't think -- I\nhave difficulty with the incentives argument either --\nhonestly, either as to (D) or as to (C). But I'm just\ntalking about the -- an argument based on consequences.\nIf an employer says you get 2 weeks of sick leave,\nperiod; after that, if you can't come back, you're\nfired -- that may -- at least for applicants within a\ncertain age range, that may have a much more severe or a\nmore severe impact on women than on men.\nMR. HOWARD: Yes, Justice Alito, and I\nthink what --\nJUSTICE ALITO: What would the answer to\nthat be, that that's not intentional discrimination?\nMR. HOWARD: That would certainly be part of\nthe answer, and what I was going to say was that what\nyou are describing is a disproportionate impact on women\nas a result of assumptions concerning pregnancy\ndisability. And, of course, if States were engaging in\nthis kind of conduct or if there were a disproportionate\nimpact, that would not state an equal protection\nviolation under Washington v. --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why are you separating four\nthings? I mean, I've heard, it seems to me, three\nseparate rationales. One, the easiest, is in (D)\nitself. Sometimes a woman could have a miscarriage, and\nof course she has to stay home. And that isn't covered\nby (A), (B), or (C). So, we cover it in (D), you know.\nAnd then we put the men in too because we don't want to\nmake this incentive just to not hire women. That's one.\nThe second one was the one Justice Ginsburg\nbrought up, that there is a gap in the pregnancy law\nwhich won't work unless you have to give people some\nmedical leave. So, here it is, (D).\nAnd the third one, which I think was related\nto what Justice Alito just said, is when -- you have to\nread it together to understand the third one. You get\n12 weeks all together. All right? Now, that means,\nonce you put in (D), this Act will have less of a bad\neffect. The bad effect of the Act is if you protect the\nwomen, then the -- the employers say, well, we're not\ngoing to hire women, perfect; we have to give them 12\nleaves; we'd have to give the men -- terrible, it's a\nterrible disincentive.\nBut then they worked out how to lessen the\ndisincentive. And the way you do that, you say 12 weeks\noverall. And now look what happens. A woman wants to\ntake, say, 12 weeks to look after her family, and she\ngets separately sick, 4 more weeks. But how many does\nshe get? Answer: Twelve, right? Twelve. You could\nanswer that part.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now let's think of the man.\nLet's think of the man. The man would like to look\nafter the family, say, for 6 weeks. And he gets sick 4\nweeks. How many weeks have we got?\nMR. HOWARD: Ten.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Ten. Thank you.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right.\nMR. HOWARD: I like these questions.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So -- perfect.\nSo, now the employer is sitting -- and it\nwill work with other numbers. I don't rely on those\nalone.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. HOWARD: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But now look what happens.\nWithout this Act, he's got a woman who is going to be\nout of there -- I mean, with the Act -- see, unless we\nput in four -- unless we put in the fourth part of it,\nwe have a woman who's gone for 12 weeks and a man who's\ngone maybe for 6 but maybe for zero, okay? Maybe for 6.\nWith the Act, the woman's gone for 12, the man's gone\nfor 10. You see?\nAnd so, the comparison there -- and it will\nwork with whatever numbers you want. The comparison\nthere is very different. And the comparison doesn't --\ndoesn't totally erase the problem with the woman, but it\nmay reduce it to a size where the Act itself will no\nlonger act as such a disincentive to hiring a woman.\nWe have three different rationales. All of\nthem are related to a serious problem, which is the\nproblem of discrimination against women because the\nemployers think they'll be home more. And so, you see\nthe conclusion I'm drawing? Yes, okay. So -- so, where\nare we?\nMR. HOWARD: Well, let me speak first to the\nsecond one, the concern about the gap. The gap that is\nfilled by the 12 weeks is -- is a -- is to provide a\nsubstantive entitlement. And when it permits a claim, a\ndamages claim enforceable against a State treasury, it\nprovides an entirely -- it requires a different\njustification than simply to fill a gap with a\nsubstantive entitlement. It becomes --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The idea is it's part of\none package. I think that's what Justice Breyer was\ngetting at. But just suppose that Congress wanted to\nimprove conditions for the -- in the job market for\nwomen, which I think it's fair to say was the motivating\nforce behind this Act, and they also wanted to protect\nfamilies so that sick children, sick spouses are\nattended to.\nNow, what leave policy would say, okay, to\ndo that, we will have leave when a spouse is sick, a\nchild is sick, a parent is sick, but not when the worker\nherself is sick? Without -- it's all part of one\npackage which is designed to increase job security for\nwomen and increase protection for their families. So, I\ndon't think you can slice off (D) from the other three.\nMR. HOWARD: Justice Ginsburg, I think you\ncan separate (D) on the same analysis that this Court\napplied in Tennessee v. Lane, in contrast to the Garrett\ncase. In Lane, of course, different sections of the\nsame Antidiscrimination Act required different\nanalysis -- analyses and reference to different parts of\nthe record. There was a single over-arching purpose, to\nprevent discrimination against persons with\ndisabilities, but the operation and effect of the\nparticular claim requires a different analysis. As\nJustice Stevens said, the Court is not required to\nevaluate statutes as an undifferentiated whole.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, it doesn't have to, of\ncourse. But the whole point of the question that I was\nasking was, sure, what helps you by doing it separately\nis it helps your case. But if we look at what Congress\nwas trying to do, they were trying to do it as a whole.\nThat's my point that I want you to answer. And they're\ntrying to do it as a whole because, no matter what\nnumbers I use, if I look at it without (D) -- is it (D)?\nYes, (D). If I look at it without (D), the ratio will\ndisfavor the woman. And if I look at it with (D),\nsuddenly the ratio from the point of view of the\nemployer of the disadvantage of hiring a woman over --\nover hiring a man -- it goes way down. And that helps\nwomen.\nAnd that is why, I think -- reading this and\nlistening, a major reason why they put in (D) as part of\nthe other, because working with that 12-week limitation\nand the whole rest of the statute, we now have a statute\nthat doesn't defeat itself. We now have a statute that\nactually can achieve the end of leading employers to not\ndiscriminate against women. Not perfectly, but there's\na big improvement.\nAnd that's the -- that's the argument I'm\nmaking. You have to read it as a whole to see that.\nAnd that's what I -- I wonder if there's an answer to\nthat. Of course, I'm at the moment thinking there isn't\nan answer to it, but I asked the question because I want\nto hear what you say.\nMR. HOWARD: Well, with respect to the\nratio, I think the premise of that point is that women\nwill take more leave for serious health conditions than\nmen. And I don't think that's borne out. And, you\nknow, Mr. Foreman has recognized as much. So, I don't\nthink the ratio really changes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, what if Congress had\nadded three additional subsections here and said that an\nemployer has to provide 12 weeks of unpaid leave so that\nan employee can go to a health spa, 12 weeks of unpaid\nleave for -- so that the employee can travel, 12 weeks\nof unpaid leave so that the employee can take an\neducational course?\nNow, that -- those could be taken advantage\nof by either men and women. It makes both men and women\nincreasingly unattractive as employees and, therefore,\nreduces the any special disincentive that might have\nbeen created by (A), (B), and (C).\nNow, on that same logic, would those be --\nwould those be provisions that further the elimination\nof discrimination based on gender?\nMR. HOWARD: I -- I think even if one\naccepted the premise, and we don't, that women take more\nleave for health conditions, that would further dilute\nthe ratio, to have available all those types of leave.\nNow, I thought, for example, one could imagine --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I thought Justice Alito\nwas trying to help you.\nJUSTICE BREYER: He was.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: He was.\nJUSTICE BREYER: He was -- he's absolutely\nright, and that's why this isn't a health spa thing,\n(D). This is -- in fact, has two independent reasons,\nthat all -- the miscarriage reason and the Pregnancy Act\nreason. And so, it isn't just saying go to a health\nspa.\nBut I mean, I don't want to put arguments in\nyour mouth, which I just have, which you wouldn't like\nthere anyway, because -- but I would appreciate your\ngoing on with this discussion in respect to what\nJustice Alito and I have been talking about, and I'd be\ninterested in what you think.\nMR. HOWARD: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And I'm working from a\ndifferent proposition than you are in response to this\nquestion. I don't think that the actual amount of time\nthat men and women take is relevant. The question is:\nWhat is the employer's perception, and did Congress have\na valid basis, as Justice Kagan pointed out earlier, to\nbelieve that employers thought women took more time?\nMR. HOWARD: I -- I think that if -- even if\nthat were correct, and -- and I don't think it is\nbecause I think the overwhelming themes in the\nlegislative record as a whole really were a concern for\nworking families, whether single-income, double-income,\nand the concern that if a breadwinner falls ill, the\nfamily's going to have severe financial insecurity. And\nthen there was also concern against discrimination\nagainst persons with illness.\nBut I think that one thing I'd like to\nemphasize is that your -- your suggestion, Justice\nSotomayor, and -- and really almost all of the\ndiscussion here today, I think, explains why this is\ngood social policy. We support it. But I don't think\nthat we've really gotten anywhere near the necessary\npredicate of unconstitutional State conduct when the\nconstitutional right is defined with some precision.\nAnd I -- and I think one has to define this\nright as -- as disability. And I think also the\nprotections that the Pregnancy Discrimination Act\nalready had in place, when added with the substantive --\nto the substantive entitlement, as a matter of Commerce\nClause legislation, to this leave --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, if the State of\nMaryland thinks this is good social policy, why is it\nasserting its sovereign immunity?\nMR. HOWARD: Well, that's a good question,\nand I think we're here mainly on -- we need to defend\nthis on principle.\nAs, Justice Kennedy, you've pointed out in a\nnumber of your opinions, the exercise of the section 5\npower alters the Federal-State --\nJUSTICE ALITO: But you can waive. Can't\nyou waive your -- your Eleventh Amendment immunity?\nMR. HOWARD: We could, I believe.\nThat's this Court's --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you can\nprovide this, the kind of relief that's sought here,\nwithout waiving immunity, right? It's a matter of\nlegislation.\nMR. HOWARD: Yes, I think that's right, and\nthere --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could I just get\nback to the discussion before about how (D) relates to\nthe others?\nMR. HOWARD: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Who do you think\nbenefits most from subsection (E), men or women? That's\nthe one about armed services obligations at the time the\nlaw was passed.\nMR. HOWARD: I assume -- and I haven't\nstudied the history of that, but I assume that, just\nbased on the demographics of the military, it's like --\nlikely that there are more men in -- in service deployed\nand that more women and wives benefit from that\nprovision.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Was that -- that wasn't\npart of the original Act, was it?\nMR. HOWARD: No, it was not.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And so, it was -- that\nwas -- the concern was a discrete concern for veterans.\nMR. HOWARD: Yes, and --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In that part.\nMR. HOWARD: And we have not --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It wasn't part of the\npackage that was the Family/Medical Leave Act.\nMR. HOWARD: No. And we are not suggesting\nthat. We haven't raised that as a point in our briefs\nor here today.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And, Mr. Howard, I -- I do\nthink that the point about the package is that if you\nlook at (D) alone, when you abstract it from everything\nelse, you have a good point, that it seems to be related\nto economic security, which is not a section 5 issue;\nthat it seems to be related to discrimination against\nsick people, which would also put us in a different\nlegal universe.\nBut when you look at (D) as passed at the\nsame moment on the basis of the same record as (A), (B),\nand (C), with the overwhelming purpose of Congress being\nto protect women from discrimination in the workplace\nbecause of unfair stereotypical -- views about what\nwomen do as workers, then (D) assumes a different kind\nof aura.\nAnd you can talk about a number of theories\nfor that, but I guess I would just ask for your -- your\nreaction to that, that (D) is just part of a package\nwhich was about telling employers: Get rid of your old\nstereotypes. Don't act on your old stereotypes. Employ\nwomen.\nMR. HOWARD: Well, I -- I would respond in\npart -- and I'm going to accept your proposition that I\nshould discuss these provisions as part of a single\npackage. But from the standpoint of States, subsection\n(D) provides a separate claim, a separate basis to sue\nStates, and we think that claim is incongruent and\ndisproportionate to any conceivable unconstitutional\nconduct that it might prohibit.\nAnd I think this is borne out in the case\nlaw. We've surveyed the 40 Federal cases that we could\nfind under subsection (D). Only two involve\npregnancy-related disabilities. Only one of them\nalludes in passing to headaches arising from pregnancy\nalong with other stress-related conditions. But -- but\nall of the others really have to do with men and women\nbenefiting from this leave for -- to care for a serious\nhealth condition.\nSo, I -- I would really emphasize, in\nresponse to your question, that one could look at it as\na package, but from the standpoint of States, it's a\nseparate and independent claim, and it's an\nextraordinarily broad one. And it is not necessary, not\nsimply because Pregnancy Discrimination Act claims are\navailable, but, Justice Alito, there are Ex parte Young\nclaims available.\nIn -- in response to your question, in this\ncase at the Joint Appendix pages 3 to 12, the amended\ncomplaint reveals that injunctive relief was sought,\nalbeit -- and on page 12 is the prayer for relief.\nIt's -- it's not clear whether that relief is sought\nunder Title VII or FMLA or both. But the reason why I\ndon't think -- the claim fails separate and apart from\nany sovereign immunity argument. Of course, Ex parte\nYoung is not -- does not protect on that ground.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there's some focus in\nthe legislative history particularly on the -- the\nfamily that has a single parent -- much more often a\nwoman, not a man -- and the devastating impact on that\nfamily of the woman getting sick, the sole breadwinner\ngetting sick. So, that was certainly an -- a problem\nfor families with -- with only one breadwinner. And\nCongress was focusing on those women and wanting to have\njob security for them. That wasn't the only group of\nwomen, but certainly that -- that affected the -- this\nAct as it came out, didn't it?\nMR. HOWARD: Yes. There is discussion in\nthe record of the disproportionate impact that you say.\nBut what -- what is left out -- well, it -- it is found\nin other parts of the record that -- the relevant --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're talking about the\nlegislative record here?\nMR. HOWARD: Yes. The -- I'm sorry, yes.\nThe record of -- before Congress.\nThe relevant comparison, we think, is not --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is that a closed record?\nIs that a closed record, the way a record of a case is?\nMR. HOWARD: I -- I am not sure I understand\nthe question.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I just find it a strange\nexpression to talk about \"in the record\" --\nMR. HOWARD: Oh, I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- when what you're talking\nabout is legislative history.\nMR. HOWARD: I misspoke. I do mean the\nlegislative history.\nThe -- the relevant comparison we think is\nnot between single-parent families who were\npredominantly women, but between working families where\nit could be two parents with a single income, man or\nwoman; it could be a family with two incomes, but\nneither one can be lost. So -- and in any event, I\nthink we're talking now about a disproportionate impact,\nwhich -- which would not state a -- an Equal Protection\nviolation.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There's a question of how\nCongress would do it. If they -- if they provided only\nfor the woman who's the single head of the family, then\nthat would be vulnerable under equal protection because\nthey didn't provide it for men.\nMR. HOWARD: I think one would need to find,\nas this Court's cases have emphasized, a widespread\npattern of unconstitutional conduct in the part of\nStates. And I think the circumstances, Justice\nGinsburg, that you've described, do not flow from\nunconstitutional State action. They have their roots in\nother socioeconomic causes. So --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So, the leave is a remedy\nfor the problem. I think there's really not much\ndisagreement about the problem, that there is gender\ndiscrimination in the job market.\nMR. HOWARD: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And then the question is\nhow do we remedy that?\nMR. HOWARD: Well, I -- I don't think by\nproviding the -- the very sweeping remedy of (D), which\n-- I see that my light's on. May I --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can finish your\nsentence.\nMR. HOWARD: We think that the remedy in (D)\nmay cover the types of concerns you referred to, but\nI -- I would emphasize this is a disproportionate,\nincongruent remedy. It subjects States to far more\nsuits for unrelated health conditions than the Eleventh\nAmendment should permit.\nThank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Foreman, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL L. FOREMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. FOREMAN: This is not responsive to\ndisability-based discrimination. The findings and the\npurpose of the Family/Medical Leave Act make it clear\nthat it is responsive to gender-based discrimination.\nHibbs, in fact, found that the FMLA was in\nresponse to gender-based discrimination. In making that\nfinding, they did not differentiate between the\ndifferent leave provisions. And, indeed, if you move to\nTennessee v. Lane, where Justice Rehnquist dissented,\ndrawing distinctions between disability-based\ndiscrimination and sex-based discrimination, stated that\nthe task of identifying the constitutional right at\nissue in the Family and Medical Leave Act was an \"easy\"\none. And that was his word, \"easy.\" It's responsive to\ngender-based discrimination.\nChief Justice Roberts, I think your question\nabout the military leave portion of the FMLA illustrates\nthat -- what Congress was doing here when they added\nthat almost 10 years later, they did not simply try to\npigeonhole it into -- this is section 5 legislation. In\nthe circuits at that time, there was considerable debate\nas to whether that could be justified as proper\nabrogation of immunity --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think it\nwould be --\nMR. FOREMAN: I'm sorry.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think it\nwould be -- how would this case come out if we were\ndealing with -- with subsection (E)? Do you think that\nshould be treated separately than the prior ones?\nMR. FOREMAN: Yes, it should, because --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How?\nMR. FOREMAN: -- it was passed pursuant to a\ndifferent constitutional power, and they provided in\nfact a different remedy, recognizing that the -- the\nCommerce Clause could not -- that Commerce Clause was\nthe appropriate way to deal with this, and they provided\na right of action by the United States in order to\nprovide damages.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If -- if we think\nthat you should look at these provisions separately,\nwhere with respect to (D) -- and I'm looking at one of\nour prior precedents -- has Congress unequivocally\ndeclared its intent to abrogate sovereign immunity?\nMR. FOREMAN: As to --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Unequivocally. Not\non the basis of implications from -- from how the other\nprovisions work. But if you do look at (D), is there\nany place where Congress unequivocally declared its\nintent to abrogate State sovereign immunity?\nMR. FOREMAN: Well, I -- I think it -- yes,\nYour Honor. It's in -- they provide that the State is\nan employer for purposes of coverage of the Family and\nMedical Leave Act. And if you go to 29 U.S.C. 2005,\nwhere it says a public entity is covered by the Family\nand Medical Leave Act, then -- that damages are\navailable. It -- it specifically includes \"State.\"\nIn terms of my colleague's attempt to\ndistance this case from Hibbs, in all due respect, we\nthink that Hibbs did the heavy lifting here. It is the\nsame legislative purpose. It is the same constitutional\nright. It is the same statutory scheme. As this\nCourt --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but your --\nthe answer you gave to my request depends entirely on a\nconclusion that (D) is linked to (A), (B), and (C)\nbecause, otherwise, you don't have the argument that\nit's precisely relief with respect to a discrimination\nunder the Fourteenth Amendment.\nMR. FOREMAN: But you do, Your Honor, and\nthat's the -- that's the discussions we had earlier,\nthat it's response to gender-based discrimination, the\nstereotypes that pregnant women will take leave. And\nso, we think (D) would stand alone. But as the\ndiscussion today indicated, we think the appropriate way\nis to treat this as a comprehensive whole responsive to\ngender-based discrimination and do as you did in Hibbs,\nfind that it is a congruent, proportional response to\ngender-based discrimination.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
