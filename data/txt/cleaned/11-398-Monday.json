        "content": "(10:12 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear\nargument this morning in Case Number 11-398, Department\nof Health and Human Services v. Florida.\nMr. Long.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. LONG\nAS THE COURT-APPOINTED AMICUS CURIAE\nMR. LONG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Anti-Injunction Act imposes a \"pay\nfirst, litigate later\" rule that is central to Federal\ntax assessment and collection. The Act applies to\nessentially every tax penalty in the Internal Revenue\nCode. There is no reason to think that Congress made a\nspecial exception for the penalty imposed by section\n5000A. On the contrary, there are three reasons to\nconclude that the Anti-Injunction Act applies here.\nFirst, Congress directed that the section\n5000A penalty shall be assessed and collected in the\nsame manner as taxes. Second, Congress provided that\npenalties are included in taxes for assessment purposes.\nAnd, third, the section 5000A penalty bears the key\nindicia of a tax.\nCongress directed that the section 5000A\npenalty shall be assessed and collected in the same\nmanner as taxes. That directive triggers the\nAnti-Injunction Act, which provides that \"no suit for\nthe purpose of restraining the assessment or collection\nof any tax may be maintained in any court by any\nperson.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that depends, as --\nas the Government points out, on whether that directive\nis a directive to the Secretary of the Treasury as to\nhow he goes about getting this penalty, or rather a\ndirective to him and to the courts. All of the other\ndirectives there seem to me to be addressed to the\nSecretary. Why should this one be directed to the\ncourts? When you say \"in the same manner,\" he goes\nabout doing it in the same manner, but the courts simply\naccept that -- that manner of proceeding but nonetheless\nadjudicate the cases.\nMR. LONG: Well, I think I have a three-part\nanswer to that, Justice Scalia. First, the text does\nnot say that the Secretary shall assess and collect\ntaxes in the same manner; it just says that it shall be\nassessed in the same manner as a tax, without addressing\nany party particularly.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, he's assessing and\ncollecting it in the same manner as a tax.\nMR. LONG: Well, the assessment -- the other\ntwo parts of the answer are, as a practical matter, I\ndon't think there's any dispute in this case that if the\nAnti-Injunction Act does not apply, this penalty, the\nsection 5000A penalty, will as a practical matter be\nassessed and collected in a very different manner from\nother taxes and other tax penalties.\nThere are three main differences. First,\nwhen the Anti-Injunction Act applies, you have to pay\nthe tax or the penalty first and then litigate later to\nget it back with interest. Second, you have to exhaust\nadministrative remedies. Even after you pay the tax,\nyou can't immediately go to court. You have to go to\nthe Secretary and give the Secretary at least 6 months\nto see if the matter can be resolved administratively.\nAnd, third, even in the very carefully defined\nsituations in which Congress has permitted a challenge\nto a tax or a penalty before it's paid, the Secretary\nhas to make the first move. The taxpayer is never\nallowed to rush into court before the tax -- before the\nSecretary sends a notice of deficiency to start the\nprocess.\nNow, if -- if the Anti-Injunction Act does\nnot apply here, none of those rules apply. And that's\nnot just for this case; it will be for every challenge\nto a section 5000A penalty going forward. The taxpayer\nwill be able to go to court at any time without\nexhausting administrative remedies; there will be none\nof the limitations that apply in terms of you have to\nwait for the Secretary to make the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Why will the\nadministrative remedies rule not be applicable,\nexhaustion rule not be applicable?\nMR. LONG: Well, because if the\nAnti-Injunction Act doesn't apply, there's no\nprohibition on courts restraining the assessment or\ncollection of this penalty, and you can simply --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but courts apply the\nexhaustion rule. I mean, I know you've studied this.\nI'm just not following it. Why couldn't the court say,\nwell, you haven't exhausted your remedies; no\ninjunction?\nMR. LONG: Well, in -- you could do that, I\nthink, as a matter of -- of common law or a judicially\nimposed doctrine, but in the code itself, which is\nall -- I mean, the Anti-Injunction Act is an absolutely\ncentral statute to litigation --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. Yes.\nMR. LONG: -- about taxes. And the code\nsays -- first it says you must pay the tax first and\nthen litigate. So, that's the baseline. And then, in\naddition, it says you must -- I mean, it's not common\nlaw; it's in the code -- you must apply for a refund,\nyou must wait at least 6 months. I mean, that's -- many\nof these provisions are extremely specific, with very\nspecific time limits.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But they would apply\neven if the rule is not jurisdictional. The only\ndifference would be that the court could enforce it or\nnot enforce it in particular cases, which brings me to\nthe Davis case, which I think is your biggest hurdle.\nIt's a case quite similar to this in which the\nconstitutionality of the Social Security Act was at\nissue, and the government waived its right to insist\nupon the application of this Act.\nOf course, if it's jurisdictional, you can't\nwaive it. So, are you asking us to overrule the Davis\ncase?\nMR. LONG: Well, Helvering v. Davis was\ndecided during a period when this Court interpreted the\nAnti-Injunction Act as simply codifying the\npre-statutory equitable principles that usually, but not\nalways, prohibited a court from enjoining the assessment\nor collection of taxes. So, that understanding, which\nis what was the basis for the Helvering v. Davis\ndecision, was rejected by the Court in Williams Packing\nand a series of subsequent cases -- Bob Jones. And so,\nI would say, effectively, the Davis case has been\noverruled by subsequent decisions of this Court.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Long, why don't we\nsimply follow the statutory language? I know that\nyou've argued that the Davis case has been overtaken by\nlater cases, but the language of the Anti-Injunction Act\nis \"no suit shall be maintained.\" It's remarkably\nsimilar to the language in -- that was at issue in Reed\nElsevier: \"No civil action for infringement ... shall\nbe instituted.\" And that formulation, \"no suit may be\nmaintained,\" contrasts with the Tax Injunction Act. It\nsays the district court shall not enjoin. That Tax\nInjunction Act is the same pattern as 2283, which says\n\"courts of the United States may not stay a proceeding\nin State court.\" So, both of those formulas, the TIA\nand the no injunction against proceedings at State\ncourt, are directed to \"court.\" The Anti-Injunction\nAct, like the statute at issue in Reed Elsevier, says\n\"no suit shall be maintained.\" And it has been argued\nthat that is suitor-directed in contrast to\ncourt-directed.\nMR. LONG: Right. Well, I mean, this Court\nhas said several times that the Tax Injunction Act was\nbased on the Anti-Injunction Act. You're quite right,\nthe language is different; but we submit that the\nAnti-Injunction Act itself, by saying that \"no suit\nshall be maintained,\" is addressed to courts as well as\nlitigants. I mean, after all, a case cannot go from\nbeginning to end without the active cooperation of the\ncourt.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But how is that different\nfrom \"no civil action for infringement shall be\ninstituted\" -- \"maintained\" and \"instituted\"? Anything\nturn on that?\nMR. LONG: Well, it's -- I mean -- perhaps a\nparty could initiate an action without the active\ncooperation of the court, but to maintain it from\nbeginning to end, again, requires the court's\ncooperation.\nAnd even if -- I mean, if the Court were\ninclined to say as an initial matter, if this statute\nwere coming before us for the first time today, given\nall of your recent decisions on jurisdiction, that you\nmight be inclined to say this is not a jurisdictional\nstatute, a lot of water has gone over the dam here. The\nCourt has said multiple times that this is a\njurisdictional statute. Congress has not disturbed\nthose decisions. To the contrary --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, the Court said that\nmany times, but is there any case in which the result\nwould have been different if the Anti-Injunction Act\nwere not viewed as jurisdictional but instead were\nviewed as a mandatory claims-processing --\nMR. LONG: There's --\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- rule?\nMR. LONG: There's certainly a number of\ncases where the Court dismissed saying it is\njurisdictional.\nAs I read the cases, I don't think any of\nthem would necessarily have come out differently,\nbecause I don't think we had a case where the argument\nwas, well, you know, the government has waived this, so,\nyou know, even -- if it's not jurisdictional, it --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, the clearest -- the\nclearest way of distinguishing between the\njurisdictional provision and a mandatory\nclaims-processing rule is whether it can be waived and\nwhether the court feels that it has an obligation to\nraise the issue sua sponte.\nNow, if there are a lot of cases that call\nit jurisdictional, but none of them would have come out\ndifferently if the Anti-Injunction Act were simply a\nmandatory claims-processing rule -- you have that on one\nside.\nAnd on the other side, you have Davis, where\nthe Court accepted a waiver by the Solicitor General;\nthe Sunshine Anthracite coal case, where there also was\na waiver; and there's the Williams Packing case, which\nis somewhat hard to understand as viewing the\nAnti-Injunction Act as a jurisdictional provision.\nThe Court said that there could be a suit if\nthere's no way the government could win and the\nplaintiff would suffer irreparable harm. Now, doesn't\nthat sound like an equitable exception to the\nAnti-Injunction Act?\nMR. LONG: No, I think the -- I think the\nbest interpretation of the Court's cases is that it was\ninterpreting a jurisdictional statute. And, indeed, in\nWilliams Packing, the Court said it was a jurisdictional\nstatute.\nBut, again, even if you had doubt about\nsimply the cases, there's more than that because\nCongress has not only not disturbed this Court's\ndecisions stating that the statute is jurisdictional;\nthey've passed numerous amendments to this\nAnti-Injunction Act.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it seems --\nyou can't separate those two points. The idea that\nCongress has acquiesced in what we have said only helps\nyou if what we have said is fairly consistent. And you,\nyourself, point out in the brief that we've kind of gone\nback and forth on whether this is a jurisdictional\nprovision or not. So, even if Congress acquiesced in\nit, I'm not sure what they acquiesced in.\nMR. LONG: Well, what you have said,\nMr. Chief Justice, has been absolutely consistent for\n50 years, since the Williams Packing case. The period\nof inconsistency was after -- the first 50 years, since\nthe statute was enacted in 1867, and there was a period,\nas I said, when the Court was allowing extraordinary\ncircumstances exceptions and equitable exceptions, but\nthen, very quickly, it cut back on that. And since --\nand since Williams Packing, you've been utterly\nconsistent --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, even since\nWilliams Packing, there was South Carolina v. Regan.\nAnd that case can also be understood as a kind of\nequitable exception to the rule, which would be\ninconsistent with thinking that the rule is\njurisdictional.\nMR. LONG: Well, again, I mean, I think the\nbest understanding of South Carolina v. Regan is not\nthat it's an equitable exception, but it's the Court\ninterpreting a jurisdictional statute as it would\ninterpret any statute in light of its purpose, and\ndeciding in that very special case, it's a very narrow\nexception --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Long, in Bowles, the\nCourt looked to the long history of appellate issues as\nbeing jurisdictional in its traditional sense, not as a\nclaim-processing rule, but as a pure jurisdiction rule,\nthe power of the court to hear a case.\nFrom all the questions here, I count at\nleast four cases in the Court's history where the Court\nhas accepted a waiver by the Solicitor General and\nreached a tax issue. I have at least three cases, one\nof them just mentioned by Justice Kagan, where\nexceptions to that rule were read in.\nGiven that history, regardless of how we\ndefine jurisdictional statutes versus claim-processing\nstatutes in recent times, isn't the fairer statement\nthat Congress has accepted that in the extraordinary\ncase, we will hear the case?\nMR. LONG: No. No, Justice Sotomayor,\nbecause in many of these amendments which have come in\nthe '70s and the '90s and the 2000s, the Congress has\nactually framed the limited exceptions to the\nAnti-Injunction Act in jurisdictional terms. And it has\nwritten many of the express exceptions by saying\nnotwithstanding section 7421 --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But doesn't that just\nprove that it knows that the court will impose a\nclaim-processing rule in many circumstances, and so, in\nthose in which it specifically doesn't want the court\nto, it has to be clearer?\nMR. LONG: Well, but Congress says,\nnotwithstanding 7421, the court \"shall have\njurisdiction\" to restrain the assessment and collection\nof taxes in very limited --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you go back to the\nquestion that Justice Alito asked? Assuming we find\nthat this is not jurisdictional, what's the parade of\nhorribles that you see occurring if we call this a\nmandatory claim-processing rule? What kinds of cases do\nyou imagine that courts will reach?\nMR. LONG: Right. Well, first of all, I\nthink you'd be saying that for the refund statute as\nwell as for the Anti-Injunction Act, which has very\nsimilar wording. So, if the Anti-Injunction Act is not\njurisdictional, I think that's also going to apply to\nthe refund statute, the statute that says you have to\nfirst ask for a refund and file, you know, within\ncertain time. So, it would be -- it would be both of\nthose statutes. And, you know, we are dealing with\ntaxes here. If people can litigate --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That wasn't my question.\nMR. LONG: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: My question was, if we\ndeem this a mandatory claim-processing rule --\nMR. LONG: Right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- what cases do you\nimagine courts will reach on what grounds? Assuming the\ngovernment does its job and comes in and raises the AIA\nas an immediate defense --\nMR. LONG: Well, that --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- what -- where can a\ncourt then reach the question, despite --\nMR. LONG: That would certainly be the first\nclass of cases that occurs to me, where, if the\ngovernment does not raise it in a timely way, it could\nbe waived. I would think plaintiffs would see if there\nwas some clever way they could get a suit going that\nwouldn't immediately be apparent that it --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Assumes the lack of\ncompetency of the government, which I don't, but what\nother types of cases?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Long, I don't think\nyou're going to come up with any, but I think your\nresponse is you could say that about any jurisdictional\nrule. If it's not jurisdictional, what's going to\nhappen is you're going to have an intelligent Federal\ncourt deciding whether you're going to make an\nexception, and there will be no parade of horribles\nbecause all Federal courts are intelligent.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, it seems to me it's a\nquestion you can't answer. It's a question which asks\nwhy should there be any jurisdictional rules? And you\nthink there should be.\nMR. LONG: And, Justice Scalia, I mean,\nhonestly, I can't predict what would happen, but I would\nsay that not all people who litigate about Federal taxes\nare necessarily rational. And I think there would be a\ngreat --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Long --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I just don't want to lose\nthe second half of your argument. And we've spent all\nthe time so far on jurisdiction. And I accept pretty\nmuch -- I'm probably leaning in your favor on\njurisdiction, but where I see the problem is in the\nsecond part, because the second part says \"restraining\nthe assessment or collection of any tax.\"\nNow, here, Congress has nowhere used the\nword \"tax.\" What it says is \"penalty.\" Moreover, this\nis not in the Internal Revenue Code but for purposes of\ncollection.\nAnd so, why is this a tax? And I know you\npoint to certain sentences that talk about taxes within\nthe code --\nMR. LONG: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- and this is not attached\nto a tax. It is attached to a health care requirement.\nMR. LONG: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, why does it fall within\nthat word?\nMR. LONG: Well, I mean, the first point\nis our -- our initial submission is you don't have to\ndetermine that this is a tax in order to find that the\nAnti-Injunction Act applies, because Congress very\nspecifically said that it shall be assessed and\ncollected in the same manner as a tax, even if it's a\ntax penalty and not a tax. So, that's one argument --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But that doesn't mean the\nAIA applies. I mean -- and then they provide some\nexceptions, but it doesn't mean the AIA applies.\nIt says \"in the same manner as.\" It is then\nattached to chapter 68, when that -- it references that\nas being \"the manner of.\" Well, that it's being applied\nor if it's being collected in the same manner as a tax\ndoesn't automatically make it a tax, particularly since\nthe reasons for the AIA are to prevent interference with\nrevenue sources. And here, an advance attack on this\ndoes not interfere with the collection of revenues.\nI mean, that's -- you've read the arguments,\nas have I. But I'd like to know what you say succinctly\nin response to those arguments.\nMR. LONG: So, specifically on the argument\nthat it is actually a tax, even setting aside the point\nthat it should be assessed and collected in the same\nmanner as a tax, the Anti-Injunction Act uses the term\n\"tax\"; it doesn't define it. Somewhat to my surprise,\n\"tax\" is not defined anywhere in the Internal Revenue\nCode. In about the time that Congress passed the\nAnti-Injunction Act, \"tax\" had a very broad definition.\nIt's broad enough to include this exaction, which is\ncodified in the Internal Revenue Code. It's part of the\ntaxpayer's annual income tax return. The amount of the\nliability and whether you owe the liability is based in\npart on your income. It's assessed and collected by the\nIRS.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There's at least some doubt\nabout it, Mr. Long, for the reasons that Justice Breyer\nsaid, and I thought that we had a -- a principle that\nousters of jurisdiction are narrowly construed; that,\nunless it's clear, courts are not deprived of\njurisdiction. And I find it hard to think that this is\nclear. Whatever else it is, it's easy to think that\nit's not clear.\nMR. LONG: Well, I mean, the Anti-Injunction\nAct applies not only to every tax in the code but, as\nfar as I can tell, to every tax penalty in the code.\nAnd --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Long, you said\nbefore -- and I think you were quite right -- that the\nTax Injunction Act is modeled on the Anti-Injunction\nAct. And, under the Tax Injunction Act, what -- what\ncan't be enjoined is an assessment for the purpose of\nraising revenue. The Tax Injunction Act does not apply\nto penalties that are designed to induce compliance with\nthe law, rather than to raise revenue. And this is not\na revenue-raising measure because, if it's successful,\nthey -- nobody will pay the penalty, and there will be\nno revenue to raise.\nMR. LONG: Well, in Bob Jones, the Court\nsaid that they had gotten out of the business of trying\nto determine whether an exaction is primarily\nrevenue-raising or primarily regulatory. And this one\ncertainly raises -- is expected to raise very\nsubstantial amounts of revenues, at least $4 billion a\nyear by the --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But Bob Jones involved a\nstatute where it denominated the exaction as a tax.\nMR. LONG: That's -- yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Here we have one where\nthe Congress is not denominating it a -- as a tax; it's\ndenominating it as a penalty.\nMR. LONG: That's -- that's absolutely\nright, and that's obviously why -- if it were called a\ntax, there would be absolutely no question that the\nAnti-Injunction Act applies.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Absolutely. But even\nthe section of the code that you referred to previously,\nthe one following 7421, the AIA, it does very clearly\nmake a difference -- 7422 -- make a difference between\ntax and penalties. It's very explicit.\nMR. LONG: Yes, that's -- it does; that is\ncorrect. And there are many other places in the code\nwhere tax --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The best collection I've\nfound in your favor, I think, is in Mortimer Caplin's\nbrief on page 16, 17. He has a whole list. All right?\nSo -- I let my law clerk to look all those up. And it\nseems to me that they all fall into the categories of\neither, one, these are penalties that were penalties\nassessed for not paying taxes; or, two, they involve\nmatters that were called by the court taxes; or, three,\nin some instances, they were deemed by the code to be\ntaxes.\nNow, what we have here is something that's\nin a different statute that doesn't use the word \"tax\"\nonce, except for a collection device and, in fact, in\naddition, the underlying AIA reason, which is to say to\nthe Solicitor General: We don't care what you think;\nwe, in Congress, don't want you in court where the\nrevenue of a State -- Tax Injunction Act -- or the\nrevenue of the Federal Government is at stake, and,\ntherefore, you can't waive it.\nNow, I got that. Here it's not at stake,\nand here there are all the differences I just mentioned.\nSo, I ask that because I want to hear your response.\nMR. LONG: Well, I mean, there are penalties\nin the Internal Revenue Code that you really couldn't\nsay are related in any -- in any close way to some other\ntax provision. There's a penalty -- it's discussed in\nthe briefs -- for selling diesel fuel that doesn't\ncomply with EPA's regulations, you know. So, there are\nall kinds of penalties in the code, and I think it's --\nthat it's reliable.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Long, aren't there\nplaces in this Act -- fees and penalties -- that were\nspecifically put under the Anti-Injunction Act? There's\none on health care plans, there's one on pharmaceutical\nmanufacturers, where Congress specifically said the\nAnti-Injunction Act is triggered for those. It does not\nsay that here. Wouldn't that suggest that Congress\nmeant for a different result to obtain?\nMR. LONG: Well, I mean, Congress didn't use\nthe language the Anti-Injunction Act \"shall apply\" --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: No, but it -- in section\n9008 and in section 9010, it specifically referred --\nMR. LONG: Right.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: -- to the part of the code\nwhere the Anti-Injunction Act is.\nMR. LONG: All of subtitle F, which picks up\nlots of administration and procedure provisions, but\nthose are fees, and they're not -- Congress did not\nprovide, you know, in the sections themselves that they\nshould be paid as part of a tax return. So, they were\nfree-standing fees. And by using that subtitle F\nlanguage, Congress plugged in a whole set of rules for\nhow to collect and administer the fees, and it went not\njust to assessment and collection -- and the IRS has\nrecognized this -- but to examination, privacy, a whole\nseries of additional things.\nSo, I think it would be a mistake to look at\nthat language and say, oh, here's Congress saying they\nwant the Anti-Injunction Act to apply. They're actually\ndoing more than that.\nAnd, yes, I grant you, you could look at\nsection 5000A, the individual coverage requirement, and\nsay, well, they could have been clearer about saying the\nAnti-Injunction Act applied. And that's certainly true,\nbut, again, they were trying to accomplish a lot. And\nit's --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's easier to talk about\nthis case if we just forget the words \"for the purpose\nof restraining assessment or collection.\" In a sense,\nthat brings the jurisdictional question and\nJustice Breyer's question together.\nIt seems to me -- maybe you could just\ncomment on that language. Is that sort of language\nusually contained in a jurisdictional provision? I\nmean, you often don't know the purpose of a suit until\nafter the thing is under way. I can see it with\nmalicious prosecution and some civil rights cases. Does\nit strike you as somewhat unusual to have this provision\nin a jurisdictional sense?\nMR. LONG: It does strike me, honestly --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. Excuse me.\nMR. LONG: -- as a bit unusual, but this is\nan old statute. I mean, this -- the core language is\nessentially unchanged since 1867, and it -- you know, I\nthink that's part of the explanation for it. And,\nagain, it's, you know, become the center of a series of\nprovisions that very carefully control the circumstances\nin which litigation about Federal taxes can take place.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Long, there's another\nargument that has been made that I would like you to\naddress, and that is all this talk about tax penalty --\nit's all beside the point because this suit is not\nchallenging the penalty. This is a suit that is\nchallenging the must-buy provision, and the argument is\nmade that, if, indeed, \"must-buy\" is constitutional,\nthen these complainants will not resist the penalty.\nSo, what they're seeking is a determination\nthat the \"must-buy\" requirement, stated separately from\nthe penalty, that the \"must-buy\" is unconstitutional.\nAnd, if that's so, that's the end of the case; if it's\nnot so, they're not resisting the penalty.\nMR. LONG: Well, I think that argument\ndoesn't work for two reasons. I mean, first, if you\nlook at the plaintiffs' own complaint, they clearly\nchallenge both the minimum coverage requirement and the\npenalty. At page 122 of the Joint Appendix, they\nchallenge the requirement that the individuals obtain\nhealth care coverage or pay a penalty.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, why is that?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If that's -- if that's\nthe problem, it's easy to amend a complaint. They can\njust take that out of the complaint. So, it can't turn\non that.\nMR. LONG: Well -- and -- yes, I mean, it's\n-- or another complaint would be filed, but, still, I\nthink that's a serious problem. But even if they had\nfiled a different complaint, I don't think you -- in\nthis case, I don't think you can separate the minimum\ncoverage requirement from the penalty, because the\npenalty is the sole means of enforcing the minimum\ncoverage requirement.\nSo, first, I mean, I think these plaintiffs\nwould not be satisfied if the Court were to render a\njudgment saying the minimum coverage requirement is\ninvalidated; the penalty, however, remains standing.\nAnybody who doesn't have insurance has to pay the\npenalty. Then they'd have to pay a penalty equal to the\ncost of insurance and they wouldn't even have insurance.\nSo, I don't think that would be --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, they say they want to\nobey the law --\nMR. LONG: Right.\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- and they say that your\nargument puts them in the position of having to disobey\nthe law in order to obtain review of their claim. And\nwhat is your answer to that?\nMR. LONG: Well, I mean, first of all, I\ncan't find that in the record, in their declarations. I\ndon't see a statement that they will, you know, never\nincur a penalty under any circumstances. But -- but\neven if that were so, what this Court has said in\nAmericans United is the Anti-Injunction Act bars any\nsuit, not just to enjoin the collection of your own\ntaxes, but to enjoin the collection of anyone's taxes.\nAnd so, even if it were really true that\nthese plaintiffs were not interested in the penalty and\nwould never pay the penalty, if they were to succeed in\nthis case in striking down the minimum coverage\nrequirement, the inevitable result would be that the\npenalty would fall as well, because the government\ncouldn't collect a penalty for failing to follow an\nunconstitutional requirement. And so, it would still be\nbarred because it would be a suit that would prevent the\ncollection of some of the --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, let me take us back to\nJustice Kennedy's question about the \"for the purpose\nof\" language. I take it you interpret the statute to\nmean the following: \"For the purpose of\" means having\nthe effect of. Is that correct?\nMR. LONG: Well, I mean, this Court in the\nBob Jones case, where a similar kind of argument was\nbeing made by the plaintiff in that case, said, you\nknow, look, you know, where the -- where it's inevitable\nthat this is what the suit is about, they're sort of two\nsides of the same coin, that clearly is a primary\npurpose of the suit. And it's -- and you can't by\nclever pleading get away from that. That's just the\nnature of the situation.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Long, aren't you\ntrying to rewrite the statute, in a way? The statute\nhas two sections. One is the \"you have to have\ninsurance\" section and the other is the sanction. The\nstatute has two different sets of exceptions\ncorresponding to those two different sections. You're\ntrying to suggest that the statute says, well, it's your\nchoice, either buy insurance or pay a -- or pay a fee.\nBut that's not the way the statute reads.\nAnd Congress, it must be supposed, you know, made a\ndecision that that shouldn't be the way the statute\nreads, that it should instead be a regulatory command\nand a penalty attached to that command.\nMR. LONG: Well, I would not argue that this\nstatute is a perfect model of clarity, but I do think\nthe most reasonable way to read the entire statute is\nthat it does impose a single obligation to pay a penalty\nif you are an applicable individual and you're not\nsubject to an exemption.\nAnd the reason I say that, if you look at\nthe exemptions from the penalty, I mean, the very first\none is you're exempt from the penalty because you can't\nafford to purchase insurance. And it just doesn't seem\nreasonable to me to interpret the statute as Congress\nhaving said, well, you know, this person is exempt from\npaying a penalty because we find they can't afford to\nbuy insurance; however, they still have a legal\nobligation to buy insurance. That just doesn't seem\nreasonable.\nSo, I do think, although it's -- I certainly\nwouldn't argue it's clear, that that's the best way to\nunderstand the statute as a whole.\nBut, again, I would say, you know, that's\nnot essential to the question we're discussing now, of\nwhether the Anti-Injunction Act applies. Again, you\nknow, I think --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you tell me why\nyou think the Solicitor General's reading creates a\nproblem? He --\nMR. LONG: Well, in going back to -- so if,\nso if the result were to say simply, this is not -- oh,\nI'm sorry. The Solicitor General's reading. So, now\nit's not --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That it is a\njurisdictional bar, but there's an exemption for those\nitems that Congress has designated solely as penalties\nthat are not like taxes.\nMR. LONG: Right. Well, I mean, I think the\nSolicitor General's reading would probably create the\nfewest problems, as I understand it. I mean, my -- my\nmain objection to the Solicitor General's reading is I\ndon't think it makes a whole lot of sense. I mean,\nbasically, the Solicitor General says every penalty in\nthe Internal Revenue Code, every other penalty in the\nAffordable Care Act is --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Oh that's not -- that's\ncarrying it too far, because he says if a penalty is\ndesignated as a tax by Congress, then it's subject to\nthe AIA, and that's most of the code, the tax code. And\nhe says for those portions of the Affordable Care Act\nthat designate things as taxes, the AIA applies. So,\nit's only -- and I haven't found another statute. I'm\ngoing to ask him if there's another one. It's only for\nthose statutes in which Congress has designated\nsomething solely as a penalty.\nMR. LONG: Right. Right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And not indicated that\nit is a tax.\nMR. LONG: Right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They don't fall within\nthe AIA.\nMR. LONG: I think my -- my take on it is if\nyou adopted the Solicitor General's approach, there are\nprobably three penalties for alcohol- and\ntobacco-related offenses at 5114(c), 5684, and 5761 that\nI think would be very difficult to distinguish from this\none, and possibly the 527(j) penalty for failure to\ndisclose political contributions.\nIf there are no further questions, I'd like\nto reserve.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Long.\nGeneral Verrilli.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.,\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court\nThis case presents issues of great moment,\nand the Anti-Injunction Act does not bar the Court's\nconsideration of those issues. That is so even though\nthe Anti-Injunction Act is a jurisdictional limit that\nserves what this Court described in Clintwood Elkhorn as\nan exceedingly strong interest in protecting the\nfinancial stability of the Federal Government, and even\nthough the minimum coverage provision of the Affordable\nCare Act is an exercise of Congress's taxing power as\nwell as its commerce power.\nCongress has authority under the taxing\npower to enact a measure not labeled as a tax, and it\ndid so when it put section 5000A into the Internal\nRevenue Code. But for purposes of the Anti-Injunction\nAct, the precise language Congress used is\ndeterminative. And there is no language in the\nAnti-Injunction Act -- excuse me -- no language in\nsection 5000A of the Affordable Care Act or in the\nInternal Revenue Code generally that provides a textual\ninstruction that --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, General Verrilli,\ntoday you're arguing that the penalty is not a tax.\nTomorrow you're going to be back and you'll be arguing\nthat the penalty is a tax.\nHas the Court ever held that something that\nis a tax for purposes of the taxing power under the\nConstitution is not a tax under the Anti-Injunction Act?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: No, Justice Alito, but\nthe Court has held in the license tax cases that\nsomething can be a constitutional exercise of the taxing\npower whether or not it is called a tax. And that's\nbecause the nature of the inquiry that we will conduct\ntomorrow is different from the nature of the inquiry\nthat we will conduct today.\nTomorrow, the question is whether Congress\nhas the authority under the taxing power to enact it,\nand the form of words doesn't have a dispositive effect\non that analysis. Today, we're construing statutory\ntext where the precise choice of words does have a\ndispositive effect on the analysis.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, General, you also\nhave the Bailey child labor tax cases, 'cause there the\nCourt said that the tax, which was a prohibitory tax\nalone, was a tax subject to the AIA, and then it said it\nwas beyond the Court's taxing power in a separate case,\ncorrect?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Yes. I do think, Justice\nSotomayor, that with respect to one of the arguments\nthat my friend from the NFIB has made in the brief, that\nBailey v. George is a significant problem because I\nthink their argument on the constitutionality under the\ntaxing power is essentially that the Affordable Care Act\nprovision is the same thing as the provision that was\nheld unconstitutional in Bailey v. Drexel Furniture.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's a different\nissue. The question Justice --\nGENERAL VERRILLI: But on the same day --\nright, but on the same day as Bailey v. Drexel\nFurniture, the Court issued Bailey v. George, which held\nthat the Anti-Injunction Act did bar a challenge to that\nprovision, even though the Court had concluded that it\nwas invalid under the tax power.\nSo -- and I think the reason for that has\nbeen -- is clear now after Williams Packing and Bob\nJones, in that, in order to find that the\nAnti-Injunction Act doesn't apply to something that\notherwise would be a tax that triggers it, you have to\nconclude essentially that there's no substantial\nargument that can be made in defense of it as a tax. We\ndon't have that here. So, I don't think you can get\naround the Anti-Injunction Act if the Court were to read\nit, as the amicus suggest it should be read, on that\ntheory, but --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Verrilli, a basic\nquestion about your argument: If you're right about the\nsecond part, that is, for purposes of the statute, the\nAnti-Injunction statute, this penalty does not\nconstitute a tax, then does the Court need to decide\nwhether the Anti-Injunction Act in other cases, where it\ndoes involve a tax, is jurisdictional?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: No. I apologize if I'm\ncreating any confusion about that, Justice Ginsburg. We\nthink by far the better route here is to understand the\nstatute as we have proposed that it be construed as not\napplying here. From the perspective of the United\nStates -- and if I could, I'd like to take a minute on\nthis -- the idea that the Anti-Injunction Act would be\nconstrued as not being a jurisdictional provision is\nvery troubling, and we don't think it's correct.\nAnd I would, if I could, follow up on a\nquestion, Justice Ginsburg, that you asked Mr. Long in\nterms of the language of the Anti-Injunction Act,\n7421(a), which can be found at page 16a of the appendix\nto our brief.\nI'd ask the Court to compare that to the\nlanguage of the very next provision in the code, which\nis on the next page of our statutory appendix, 17a,\nwhich is the refund statute, which we've talked about a\nlittle bit so far this morning, 7422(a).\nThe refund statute this Court held in Dolan\nwas jurisdictional, and the Court in both Dolan and\nBrockamp held that the statute of limitations that\napplies to the refund statute cases is jurisdictional.\nThe language in 7422(a) is virtually\nidentical to the language in 7421(a) --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That is correct, although\nin the refund context, you have the sovereign immunity\nproblem, in which we presume that that has not been\nwaived.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Right. But I --\n7421(a) --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But you're correct on --\nGENERAL VERRILLI: -- and 7422(a) were the\nsame --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The language is quite\nparallel.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: And, originally, they\nwere the same statutory provision.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: They were only separated\nout later. So, I do think that's the strongest textual\nindication, Justice Ginsburg, that -- that 7421(a) is\njurisdictional.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: General --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the question that I\nasked you is, if you're right that this penalty is not\ncovered by section 7421, if you're right about that, why\nshould we deal with the jurisdictional question at all?\nBecause this statute, correct, the way you're reading --\nread it doesn't involve a tax that's subject to the\nAnti-Injunction Act.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Yes, that is exactly our\nposition. And the reason we don't --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So -- so, you agree that\nwe would not -- if we agree with you about the correct\ninterpretation of the statute, we need not decide the\njurisdiction.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: There would be no reason\nto decide the jurisdictional issue.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Don't you want to know the\nanswer?\n(Laughter.)\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Justice Kennedy, I think\nwe all want to know the answer to a lot of things in\nthis case. But -- but I do -- but I do think that the\nprudent course here is to construe the statute in the\nmanner that we read it.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But you indicated -- there\nwas a discussion earlier about why does the government\nreally care, they have competent attorneys, et cetera.\nBut -- and you began your argument by saying it would be\nvery troubling to say that it's not jurisdictional.\nI'd like you to comment on that. It's not\nfor us to tell a party what's in its best interests. It\nwould seem to me that there might be some instances in\nwhich the government would want to litigate the validity\nof a tax right away and would want to waive. But you\nsay it's -- that's not true; that it's very troubling.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: I think there are two\nproblems. One is the problem that Justice Scalia\nidentified, that if it's not jurisdictional, then courts\nhave authority to craft equitable exceptions. And it\nmay seem from where we stand now that that authority is\nor could be very, very tightly cabined. But if -- if\nthis Court were to conclude that it isn't\njurisdictional, that does empower courts to find other\ncircumstances in which they might find it equitable to\nallow cases to go forward in the absence of -- despite\nthe existence of the Anti-Injunction Act.\nAnd, second, although I certainly am not\ngoing to stand up here and disparage the attorneys for\nthe United States in the slightest, the reality is that\nif this isn't jurisdictional, then it's -- the argument\n-- it's open to the argument that it's subject to\nforfeiture by a simple omission in failing to raise it\nin an answer. And that -- and that's a troubling\nprospect.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: General, can I ask --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How likely is it --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice Ginsburg.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How likely is it -- I\nmean, the government is going to be defending these\nsuits. How likely is it that the government will\noverlook the Anti-Injunction Act? So, it seems to me\nthat this is arming the government by saying it's\nwaivable at the government's option.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: That's -- that is not our\nassessment of the institutional interests of the United\nStates, Justice Ginsburg. And we do think that the --\nthe right way to go in this case is to read the statute\nas not applying to the minimum coverage provision of --\nof the Affordable Care Act.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It was -- it was the\ncalculation of the interests of the United States that\nyour predecessor made in the Davis case.\nThere, the Solicitor General exercised\nauthority that we sanctioned to waive the\nAnti-Injunction Act. And, of course, that couldn't be\ndone if it were jurisdictional.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: That's true,\nMr. Chief Justice. Several points about that, though.\nWe do agree with Mr. Long's analysis that\nDavis occurred in -- during a time in -- in which under\nthe Standard Nut case, the Court had interpreted the\nAnti-Injunction Act as doing no more than codifying the\ntraditional equitable principles which allowed courts\ndiscretion to conclude that in certain circumstances, a\ncase could go forward.\nWilliams Packing repudiated that analysis,\nand Bob Jones v. Simon again repudiated that analysis\nand said, no, we're no longer abiding by that. It is\ntrue that the Davis case has not formally been\noverruled, but we do think it's fundamentally\ninconsistent with the Court's understanding now of --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I thought Davis was the\ncase that -- where a shareholder sues the corporation.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And the remedy is that the\ncorporation shouldn't pay the money to the tax\nauthority. Now, it's a little technical, but that isn't\nactually an injunction against the tax authority\ncollecting. He's not -- they're not restraining the\ncollection of the tax. They're saying to the taxpayer,\ndon't pay it.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Yes. And --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't know how far that\ngets you.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Well, in fairness,\nJustice Breyer, the United States did intervene in the\n-- in the Davis case and was a party, and so -- not as\nfar as I'd like, I guess, is the answer.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Don't do it again, because\nI think that goes too far. I don't think that's\nrestraining the collection of the tax. It's restraining\nthe payment of the tax.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't want to let that\nbone go, right?\n(Laughter.)\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Our view here is that it\nis jurisdictional. Because it's jurisdictional as this\nCourt understands jurisdiction now, it's not waivable.\nAnd, therefore, we don't think that -- that that part of\nthe Davis decision is good law.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: General, can I ask you about\nReed Elsevier? Justice Ginsburg suggested that the\nlanguage was very similar in Reed Elsevier as it is\nhere, but there are even further similarities. Reed\nElsevier pointed out that the provision in question\nwasn't in Title 28. Here, too, it's not in Title 28.\nIn Reed Elsevier, it was pointed out that the provision\nthere had numerous exceptions to it. Here, too, there\nare numerous exceptions that we find that have been\ncreated by the courts over the years.\nIn Reed Elsevier, the question was\nessentially one about timing. Come to court after you\nfile your registration. Here, too, the question is one\nabout timing. Come to court after you make -- after you\npay your taxes.\nSo, Reed Elsevier seems in multiple respects\non all fours with this case.\nWhy is that wrong?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: I don't think so, Justice\nKagan. First, we think -- I guess I'm repeating myself\nand I apologize. But we think the closest analogue is\nthe very next provision in the United States Code,\n7422(a), which this Court has held is jurisdictional,\nand is phrased in exactly the same way as 7421(a). In\nfact, as I said, they were the same provision back in\nthe earlier days. That's the closest analogue.\nThis isn't -- and it's actually 7422 that's\na statute that says do something first. But this\nstatute is just a flat-out command that no suit shall be\nmaintained to restrain --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I take the point --\nGENERAL VERRILLI: -- the assessment or\ncollection.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: -- but if you would comment\non the similarities of Reed Elsevier to this case. How\ndo you think it's different, at all?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Well, because the -- I\nthink the best answer to that is that there are no magic\nwords, and that history and context matter, as the Court\nsaid in Henderson. And the history and context here is\nthat 7422 and 7421 function together to protect an\nexceedingly strong interest that the Court has held with\nrespect to 7422, sufficiently strong that it explains\nthe jurisdictional nature of that. The same interest\napplies here.\nThis isn't just a matter of do X and then\nyou can -- and then you can come to court. It's just a\nfundamentally different set of interests at stake.\nSo, we do think that that makes a big\ndifference. And --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why isn't Reed\nElsevier -- if you're dividing jurisdiction from claims\nprocessing -- it says you have to register before you\ncan sue. There are a lot of things you have to do\nbefore you can sue. So, why isn't Reed Elsevier like\nyou have to pay a filing fee before you can file a\ncomplaint?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: It is -- we do think it's\nvery much in that nature and different from this case,\nYour Honor.\nAnd one way I think it's helpful to get at\nthis is to look at the history. We've cited a string of\ncourt of appeals cases in a footnote in our opening\nbrief, and over time, it's been very consistent that the\ncourts of appeals have treated the Anti-Injunction Act\nas a jurisdictional provision.\nAgain, if the Court agrees with our\nstatutory construction, we don't need to reach this\nissue. But they have -- in fact, one of those cases,\nthe Hansen case, the district court in that case had\ndismissed the complaint under Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 12(b)(6). The court of appeals vacated and\nsent it back with instructions to dismiss under\n12(b)(1), which is the subject-matter jurisdiction\nprovision.\nSo, I do think that, to the extent this\nissue is before the Court, it is jurisdictional, but it\ndoesn't need to be before the Court because of the\nstatutory construction argument that we had offered.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: On your statutory\nconstruction argument, is there any other exaction\nimposed under the Internal Revenue Code that would not\nqualify as a tax for Anti-Injunction Act purposes, or is\n5000A just out there all by itself?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: It's -- it's not quite\nout there all by itself. There are other provisions\nthat fall outside of subchapter B of chapter 68 and,\ntherefore, wouldn't be governed by the instruction in\nsection 6671(a), which answers the question about the\napplicability of the Act for most penalties.\nThe ones that we've identified -- I may be\noverlapping a little bit with Mr. Long here -- one is 26\nU.S.C. 857, which imposes certain penalties in\nconnection with the administration of real estate\ninvestment trusts.\nThere are provisions that Mr. Long\nidentified in his brief, sections 6038(a) through (c) of\nthe code, which impose certain penalties with respect to\nreporting requirements for foreign corporations.\nWe have, in addition, in footnote 22 at page\n36 of our brief, identified three provisions that Mr.\nLong also identified about -- about alcohol and tobacco.\nNow --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could we -- could we\naddress, General, the question of whether there are any\ncollateral consequences for the failure to buy -- to not\nbuy health insurance? Is the only consequence the\npayment of the penalty?\nThe Private Respondents argue that there are\nother collateral consequences such as for people on\nprobation who are disobeying the law. If they don't buy\nhealth insurance, they'd be disobeying the law and could\nbe subject to having their supervised release revoked.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Yes. That is not a\ncorrect reading of the statute, Justice Sotomayor. The\nonly consequence that ensues is the tax penalty. And\nthe -- we have made a representation, and it was a\ncarefully made representation, in our brief that it is\nthe interpretation of the agencies charged with\ninterpreting this statute, the Treasury Department and\nthe Department of Health and Human Services, that there\nis no other consequence apart from the tax penalty.\nAnd I do think, if I could talk for a couple\nof minutes about the argument that was discussed as to\nwhether this can be conceived of as a suit just\nchallenging the requirement, which is entirely\nstand-alone based on inferences drawn from the\nexemptions, I really don't think that's right. And if I\ncould spend a minute on it, I think it's important.\nThe exemptions in section 5000A -- it is\ntrue that there are two categories of exemptions. There\nare exemptions to the penalty and exemptions to the\nsubsection (a) requirement. But the -- but I think, not\nonly as a practical matter, but I think there's a\ntextual indication and even as a legal matter,\nthey are -- they both function as exceptions to the\nrequirement.\nFirst, as a practical matter, one of those\nexemptions is a hardship exemption. And if the Court\nwill just bear with me for one minute here, it's at page\n11a of the appendix to our brief. It provides that a\nperson can go to the Secretary of HHS and obtain a\nhardship exemption for -- which would, as a formal\nmatter here, excuse compliance with the penalty.\nIt seems to me to make very little sense to\nsay that someone who has gone to an official of the\nUnited States and obtained an exemption would,\nnonetheless, be in the position of being a law breaker.\nWe think another way in which you can get to\nthe same conclusion slightly differently is by\nconsidering the provision on the prior page, 10a, which\nis 5000A -- 5000A(e)(3), members of Indian tribes.\nMembers of Indian tribes are exempt only from the\npenalty as a formal matter under the structure of the\nstatute here, but the reason for that is because members\nof Indian tribes obtain their health care through the\nIndian Health Service, which is a clinic-based system\nthat doesn't involve insurance at all, and it's an\nentirely different system.\nThey were taken out of this statute because\nthey get their health care through a different system.\nAnd it doesn't make any sense to think that persons\ngetting their health care through the Indian Health\nService are violating the law because -- because exempt\nonly from the penalty but still under a legal obligation\nto have insurance, when the whole point of this is that\nthey're supposed to be in a clinic-based system.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is your whole point that\nthis was inartful drafting by Congress, that, to the\nextent that there is an exemption under the penalty,\nit's an exemption from the legal obligation?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: I guess what I would say\nabout it, Your Honor, is that the way in which this\nstatute is drafted doesn't permit the inference that my\nfriends from the NFIB are trying to draw from it.\nAnd there is an additional textual\nindication of that, which one can find at page 13 of our\nreply brief. This is a provision that is 42 U.S.C.A.\nsection 18022(e). This is a provision that provides for\na certification that certain individuals can get. And\nthis is the paragraph starting with the words \"Other\nprovisions\" contains the quote.\nAnd it says, \"an individual with a\n'certification' ... that the individual is exempt from\nthe requirement under Section 5000A ... by reason of\nsection 5000A(e)(1) of such Code,\" is entitled to a\ncertificate that allows for enrollment in a particular\nprogram for this category of people.\nBut you can see here, Congress is saying an\nexemption under 5000A(e)(1), which is the exemption from\nthe penalty, and not the underlying requirement, is, as\nCongress says, an exemption from the requirement of\nsection 5000A.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: General --\nJUSTICE ALITO: 5000A says, directly, \"an\napplicable individual shall ensure that the individual\nhas the minimum essential coverage.\" And you're saying\nit doesn't really mean that, that if you're not subject\nto the penalty, you're not under an obligation to\nmaintain the minimum essential coverage.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: That's correct. And we\nthink that's what Congress is saying, both in the\nprovision I just pointed to, Your Honor, and by virtue\nof the fact -- by virtue of the way the exemptions work.\nI just think that's the -- reading this in context, that\nis the stronger reading of the statute.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Suppose somebody --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It makes it easy for\nthe government to drop the other shoe in the future,\nright? You've been under the law subject to this\nmandate all along. You've been exempt from the penalty.\nSo, all they have to do is take away the penalty.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: I don't -- I don't think\nso, Mr. Chief Justice. I don't think it makes it easy\nfor the government in the future. We think this is the\nfairest reading of the statute, that the -- that the --\nyou cannot infer from the fact that someone is exempt\nfrom the penalty, that they're still under an obligation\nto have insurance. That's just not the fairest reading\nof the statute.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Could I --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Suppose -- go ahead.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Sorry.\nJUSTICE ALITO: No, go ahead.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: The nature of the\nrepresentation you made, that the only consequence is\nthe penalty, suppose a person does not purchase\ninsurance, a person who is obligated to do so under the\nstatute, doesn't do it, pays the penalty instead, and\nthat person finds herself in a position where she is\nasked the question, have you ever violated any Federal\nlaw, would that person have violated a federal law?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: No. Our position is that\nperson should give the answer \"no.\"\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And that's because --\nGENERAL VERRILLI: That if they don't pay\nthe tax, they've violated a Federal law.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But as long as they've paid\nthe penalty --\nGENERAL VERRILLI: If they've paid the tax,\nthen they're in compliance with the law.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why do you keep saying it's\na tax?\n(Laughter.)\nGENERAL VERRILLI: If they pay the tax\npenalty --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Thank you.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: -- they're in compliance\nwith the law. Thank you, Justice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The penalty.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Right. That's right.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Suppose a person who has\nbeen receiving medical care in an emergency room -- has\nno health insurance but, over the years, goes to the\nemergency room when the person wants medical care --\ngoes to the emergency room, and the hospital says, well,\nfine, you're eligible for Medicaid, enroll in Medicaid.\nAnd the person says, no, I don't want that. I want to\ncontinue to get -- just get care here from the emergency\nroom. Will the hospital be able to point to the mandate\nand say, well, you're obligated to enroll?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: No, I don't think so,\nJustice Alito, for the same reason I just gave. I think\nthat the -- that the answer in that situation is that\nthat person, assuming that person -- well, if that\nperson is eligible for Medicaid, they may well not be in\na situation where they're going to face any tax penalty\nand therefore --\nJUSTICE ALITO: No, they're not facing the\ntax penalty.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Right. Right.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So, the hospital will have\nto continue to give them care and pay for it themselves,\nand not --\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Right.\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- require them to be\nenrolled in Medicaid.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Right.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Will they be able to take\nthis out and say, well, you really should -- you have a\nmoral obligation to do it; the Congress of the United\nStates has said you have to enroll?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: I do think it's --\nJUSTICE ALITO: No, they can't say that?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: I think it's certainly\nfair to say that the Congress wants people in that\nposition to sign up for Medicaid. I think that's\nabsolutely right. And I think the statute is structured\nto accomplish that objective, but the reality still is\nthat the only consequence of noncompliance is the\npenalty.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: General, but I thought\nthat people who were eligible for Medicaid weren't\nsubject to the penalty. Am I wrong? I could be just\nfactually wrong.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Well, it all -- the\npenalty is keyed to income.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Yes.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: And the -- it's keyed to\na number of things. One is, are you making so little\nmoney that you aren't obligated to file a tax return?\nAnd if you're in that situation, you're not subject to\nthe penalty. It's also if the cost of insurance would\nbe more than 8 percent of your income, you're not\nsubject to the penalty.\nSo, there isn't necessarily a precise\nmapping between somebody's income level and their\nMedicaid eligibility at the present moment. That will\ndepend on where things are and what the eligibility\nrequirements are in the State.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But for those people\nbelow --\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Right. As a general\nmatter, for people below the poverty line, it's almost\ninconceivable that they're ever going to be subject to\nthe penalty, and they would, after the Act's Medicaid\nreforms go into place, be eligible for Medicaid at that\npoint.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, is your point that the\ntax and authority -- what we want to do is get money\nfrom these people. Most of them will bet -- that the\nmoney by buying the insurance, and that will help pay.\nBut if they don't, they're going to pay this penalty,\nand that will help, too. And the fact that we put the\nlatter in brings it within the taxing power. But as far\nas this Act is concerned, about the injunction, they\ncalled it a penalty and not a tax for a reason. They\nwanted it to fall outside that.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's in a different\nchapter, et cetera.\nIs that what the heart of what you're\nsaying?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: That's the essence of it.\nThey called it a penalty. They didn't give any other\ntextual instruction in the Affordable Care Act or in the\nInternal Revenue Code that that penalty should be\ntreated as a tax --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, except you --\nGENERAL VERRILLI: -- for Anti-Injunction\nAct purposes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You agree with\nMr. Long, isn't -- I mean, I thought you just agreed\nwith Justice Breyer that one of the purposes of the\nprovision is to raise revenue.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: It will -- well, it\nwill raise revenue. It has been predicted by the CBO\nthat it will raise revenue, Your Honor. But even though\nthat's the case -- and I think that would be true of\nany -- of any penalty, that it will raise some revenue,\nbut even though that's the case, there still needs to be\ntextual instruction in the statute that this penalty\nshould be treated as a tax for Anti-Injunction Act\npurposes, and that's what's lacking here.\nJUSTICE ALITO: After this takes effect,\nthere may be a lot of people who are assessed the\npenalty and disagree either with whether they should be\nassessed the penalty at all or with the calculation of\nthe amount of their penalty. So, under your\ninterpretation of the Act, all of them can now go to\ncourt? None of them are barred by the Anti-Injunction\nAct?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Those are two different\nthings, Justice Alito. I think for reasons that\nJustice Kennedy, I think, suggested in one of his\nquestions to Mr. Long, all of the other doctrines, that\nexhaustion of remedies and related doctrines, would\nstill be there, and the United States would rely on them\nin those circumstances. And -- and so, I don't think\nthe answer is that they can all go to court, no.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, why isn't --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Two former -- two former\ncommissioners of the IRS have filed a brief saying that\nyour interpretation is going to lead to a flooded\nlitigation. Now, they're wrong on that?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Yes. We don't -- we've\ntaken this position after very careful consideration,\nand we've assessed the institutional interests of the\nUnited States, and we think we're in the right place.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But tell me something,\nwhy isn't this case subject to the same bars that --\nthat you list in your brief? The Tax Court, at least so\nfar, considers constitutional challenges to statutes.\nSo, why aren't we -- why isn't this case subject to a\ndismissal for failure to exhaust?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: We don't -- because the\nexhaustion would go to the individual amount owed, we\nthink, and that's a different situation from this case.\nIf the Court has no further questions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Katsas.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. KATSAS\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. KATSAS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nLet me begin with the question whether the\nAnti-Injunction Act is jurisdictional.\nJustice Ginsburg, for reasons you suggested,\nwe think the text of the Anti-Injunction Act is\nindistinguishable from the text of the statute that was\nunanimously held to be non-jurisdictional in Reed\nElsevier. That statute said no suit shall be\ninstituted. This statute says no suit shall be\nmaintained. No --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: They are different\nthings.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Big difference, though.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: This says\n\"Immediately\" -- the Reed Elsevier statute says\nimmediately after instituted unless a copyright is\nregistered.\nMR. KATSAS: Unless the copyright is\nregistered. And this goes -- this goes to the character\nof the lawsuit. The statute in Reed Elsevier says\nregister your copyright and then come back to court.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So, why isn't that like\nthe filing fee? Before you can maintain a suit for\ncopyright infringement, you have to register your\ncopyright?\nMR. KATSAS: It -- it's a precondition to\nfiling suit. The -- the analogous precondition here is\npay your taxes and then come back to court. The point\nis --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, that -- that's not\ntrue. The suit here has nothing to do with hearing the\naction. It has to do with the form of relief that\nCongress is barring. It's not permitting -- it is not a\ntax case; you can come in afterwards. It's not\npermitting the court to exercise what otherwise would be\none of its powers.\nMR. KATSAS: It has to be the same\nchallenge, Justice Sotomayor, or else South\nCarolina v. Regan would say the Anti-Injunction Act\ndoesn't apply. You are right that once you file -- once\nyou pay your taxes and then file the refund action, the\nact of filing the taxes converts the suit from one\nseeking prospective relief into one seeking money\ndamages. And in that sense, you could think of the\nstatute as a remedial limitation on the courts.\nBut whether you think of it as an exhaustion\nrequirement or a remedial limitation, neither of those\ncharacterizations is jurisdictional. In\nDavis v. Passman, you said that a remedial limitation\ndoesn't go --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It does seem strange to\nthink of a -- a law that says no court can entertain a\ncertain action and give a certain remedy as merely a\nclaim-processing rule. What the -- the court is being\nousted from -- from what would otherwise be its power to\nhear something.\nMR. KATSAS: The suit is being delayed, I\nthink, is the right way of looking at it. The\njurisdictional apparatus in the district court is\npresent. Prospective relief under 1331, money damages\naction under 1346. If the Anti-Injunction Act were\njurisdiction-ousting, one might have expected it to be\nin Title 28 and to qualify those statutes and to use\njurisdictional limits.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, how do you deal with\nthis case and our Gonzalez -- our recent Gonzalez case,\nwhere we talked about --\nMR. KATSAS: Right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- the language of the\nCOA statute, that no appeal will be heard absent the\nissuance of?\nMR. KATSAS: Gonzalez -- Gonzalez v. Thaler\nrests on a special rule that applies with respect to\nappeals from one Article III court to another.\nThat's -- that explains Gonzalez, and it explains Bowles\nbefore it.\nYou have five unanimous opinions in the last\ndecade in which you have strongly gone the other\ndirection on what counts as jurisdictional.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There is an argument\nthat we should just simply say that Bowles applies only\nto appeals, but we haven't said that.\nMR. KATSAS: Though, you came very close.\nIn Henderson, Justice Sotomayor, you said that Bowles,\nwhich is akin to Thaler, is explained by the special\nrules and understandings governing appeals from one\nArticle III court to another. And you specifically said\nthat it does not apply to situations involving a party\nseeking initial judicial review of agency action, which\nis what we have here.\nSo, while you're right, the texts in Bowles\nand Thaler are not terribly different, those cases are\nexplained by that principle. Under Henderson, it\ndoesn't apply to this case.\nThe text in this case speaks to the suit,\nthe cause of action of the litigant. It doesn't speak\nto the jurisdiction or power of the court. The\nAnti-Injunction Act is placed in a section of the tax\ncode governing procedure. It's not placed in --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, all of those --\nall of that in particular --\nMR. KATSAS: You did rely on that in Reed\nElsevier as one consideration.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And we haven't relied on\nit in other cases.\nMR. KATSAS: Another -- another\nconsideration in Reed Elsevier that cuts in our favor is\nthe presence of exceptions. You said three in Reed\nElsevier cut against jurisdictional characterization.\nHere, there are 11. And --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Many of which themselves\nspeak in very clear jurisdictional language.\nMR. KATSAS: Well, some of them have no\njurisdictional language at all, and not a single one of\nthem uses the word \"jurisdiction\" to describe the\nability of the court to restrain the assessment and\ncollection of taxes, which is what one would have\nexpected --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It basically, basically the\ndifference -- of language is relevant. There are a lot\nof relevant things. But one thing that's relevant in my\nmind is that taxes are, for better or for worse, the\nlife's blood of government.\nMR. KATSAS: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And so, what Congress is\ntrying to do is to say there is a procedure here that\nyou go through. You can get your money back, or you go\nthrough the Tax Court, but don't do this in advance for\nthe reason that we don't want 500 Federal judge --\njudges substituting their idea of what is a proper\nequitable defense, of when there shouldn't be an\nexception made about da, da, da, for the basic rule.\nNo. Okay?\nAnd so, there is strong reason that is\nthere. You tried to apply that reason to the copyright\nlaw. You can't find it. Registration with the\ncopyright register is not the life's blood of anything.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: Copyright exists\nregardless. So, the reasoning isn't there.\nMR. KATSAS: Except --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The language -- you're -- I\nsee the similarity of language. I've got that. But\nit's the reasoning, the sort of underlying reason for\nnot wanting a waiver here that is -- has a significant\nrole in my mind of finding that it is jurisdictional.\nPlus the fact that we've said it nonstop since that\nNorthrop or whatever that other case is.\nMR. KATSAS: Justice Breyer, as to\nreasoning, you -- you give an argument -- you give an\nargument why, as a policy matter, it might make sense to\nhave a non-jurisdictional statute. But of course, this\nCourt's recent cases time and again say Congress has to\nclearly rank the statute as non-jurisdictional in its\ntext and structure. It seems to me a general appeal to\nstatutory policies doesn't speak with sufficient\nclarity --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's fine. I just asked\nin case you wanted to answer the policy.\nMR. KATSAS: Okay. As to policy -- as to\npolicy, I think Helvering v. Davis is the refutation of\nthis view. It is true that in most cases, the\ngovernment doesn't want and Congress doesn't want people\ncoming into court. But Davis shows that there may be\nsome cases including, for instance, constitutional\nchallenges to landmark Federal statutes where the\ngovernment sensibly decides that its revenue-raising\npurposes are better served by allowing a party to come\ninto court and waiving its defense. That's what the\nSolicitor General did in Davis, and this Court accepted\nthat waiver.\nAs for prior cases, we have the holding in\nDavis and the holding in all of the equitable exception\ncases like Williams Packing. The government --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, why don't we say --\nso, why don't we say it's jurisdictional except when the\nSolicitor General waives?\nMR. KATSAS: You have used --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why would that not\npromote Congress's policy of ensuring -- or Congress\nexplicitly says --\nMR. KATSAS: It's jurisdictional except when\nthe Solicitor General waives it?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Yes. It's a\ncontradiction in terms. I don't disagree. I don't\ndisagree.\nMR. KATSAS: It is a contradiction in terms.\nAll of your cases analyze the situation as if a statute\nis jurisdictional, then it's not subject to waiver. If\nyou were to construe this as such a one-off unique\nstatute, it seems to me we would still win because the\nSolicitor General with full knowledge of the\nAnti-Injunction Act argument available to him\naffirmatively gave it up. This is not just a forfeiture\nwhere a government lawyer is -- through inadvertence\nfails to raise an argument. This is a case where the\ngovernment --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They raised it and then\ngave it up.\nMR. KATSAS: They made it below. They know\nwhat it is. And not only are they not pursuing it here;\nthey're affirmatively pursuing an argument on the other\nside.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Katsas, is your basic\nposition that when we're talking about the jurisdiction\nof the district courts, a statute has to say it's\njurisdictional to be jurisdictional?\nMR. KATSAS: I wouldn't go quite that far.\nI think at a minimum, it has -- it has to either say\nthat or at least be directed to the courts, which is a\nformulation you've used in your cases and which is the\nformulation that Congress used in the Tax Injunction Act\nbut did not use in this statute.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, how is -- I mean, I\nsuppose one could try to make a distinction between this\ncase and Reed Elsevier by focusing on the difference\nbetween instituting something and maintaining something.\nI'm suggesting that instituting is more what a litigant\ndoes, and maintaining, as opposed to dismissing, is more\nwhat a judge does.\nMR. KATSAS: I don't think so, Justice\nKagan, because we have an adversarial system, not an\ninquisitorial one. The parties maintain their lawsuits,\nI think, is the more natural way of thinking of it.\nIf I could turn -- if I could turn to the\nmerits question on the AIA before my time runs out.\nThe purpose of this lawsuit is to challenge\na requirement -- a Federal requirement to buy health\ninsurance. That requirement itself is not a tax. And\nfor that reason alone, we think the Anti-Injunction Act\ndoesn't apply.\nWhat the amicus effectively seeks to do is\nextend the Anti-Injunction Act, not just to taxes which\nis how the statute is written, but to free-standing,\nnontax legal duties. And it's just --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The whole point --\nthe whole point of the suit is to prevent the collection\nof penalties.\nMR. KATSAS: Of taxes, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, prevent the\ncollection of taxes. But the idea that the mandate is\nsomething separate from whether you want to call it a\npenalty or tax just doesn't seem to make much sense.\nMR. KATSAS: It's entirely separate, and let\nme explain to you why.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's a command. A\nmandate is a command.\nMR. KATSAS: Right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now, if there's\nnothing behind the command -- it's sort of, well, what\nhappens if you don't follow the mandate, and the answer\nis nothing -- it seems very artificial to separate the\npunishment from the crime.\nMR. KATSAS: I'm not sure the answer is\nnothing, but even assuming it were nothing, it seems to\nme there is a difference between what the law requires\nand what enforcement consequences happen to you. This\nstatute was very deliberately written to separate\nmandate from penalty in several different ways.\nThey are put in separate sections. The\nmandate is described as a \"legal requirement\" no fewer\nthan 20 times, 3 times in the operative text and 17\ntimes in the findings. It's imposed through use of a\nmandatory verb \"shall.\" The requirement is very well\ndefined in the statute, so it can't be sloughed off as a\ngeneral exhortation, and it's backed up by a penalty.\nCongress then separated out mandate\nexceptions from penalty exceptions. It defined one\ncategory of people not subject to the mandate. One\nwould think those are the category of people as to whom\nCongress is saying you need not follow this law. It\nthen defined a separate category of people not subject\nto the penalty, but subject to the mandate. I don't\nknow what that could mean other than --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why would you\nhave a requirement that is completely toothless? Pay --\nyou know, buy insurance or else. Or else what? Or else\nnothing.\nMR. KATSAS: Because Congress reasonably\ncould think that at least some people will follow the\nlaw precisely because it is the law. And let me give\nyou an example of one category of person that might be:\nThe very poor, who are exempt from the penalty but\nsubject to the mandate.\nMr. Long says this must be a mandate\nexemption because it would be wholly harsh and\nunreasonable for Congress to expect people who are very\npoor to comply with a requirement to obtain health\ninsurance when they have no means of doing so.\nThat gets things exactly backwards. The\nvery poor are the people Congress would be most\nconcerned about with respect to the mandate to the\nextent one of the justifications for the mandate is to\nprevent emergency room cost shifting when people receive\nuncompensated care. So, they would have had very good\nreason to make the very poor subject to the mandate, and\nthen they didn't do it in a draconian way; they gave the\nvery poor a means of complying with the insurance\nmandate, and that is through the Medicaid system.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Katsas, do you think a\nperson who is subject to the mandate but not subject to\nthe penalty would have standing?\nMR. KATSAS: Yes, I think that person would,\nbecause that person is injured by compliance with the\nmandate.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And what would that look\nlike? What would the argument be as to what the injury\nwas?\nMR. KATSAS: The injury -- when that person\nis subject to the mandate, that person is required to\npurchase health insurance. That's a forced acquisition\nof an unwanted good. It's a classic pocketbook injury.\nBut even if I'm wrong about that question,\nJustice Kagan, the question of who has standing to bring\nthe challenge that we seek to bring seems to me very\ndifferent -- your hypothetical plaintiff is very\ndifferent from the actual plaintiffs. We have\nindividuals who are planning for compliance in order to\navoid a penalty, which is what their affidavits say.\nAnd we have the States, who will be subject no doubt to\nall sorts of adverse ramifications if they refuse to\nenroll in Medicaid the people who are forced into\nMedicaid by virtue of the mandate.\nSo, we don't have the problem of no adverse\nconsequences in the case.\nAnd then, we have the separate distinction\nbetween the question of who has Article III standing in\norder to maintain a suit and the question of who is\nsubject to a legal obligation. And you've said in your\ncases that even if there may be no one who has standing\nto challenge a legal obligation like the incompatibility\nclause or something, that doesn't somehow convert the\nlegal obligation into a legal nullity.\nFinally, with respect to the States, even if\nwe are wrong about everything I've said so far, the\nStates clearly fall within the exception recognized in\nSouth Carolina v. Regan. They are injured by the\nmandate because the mandate forces 6 million new people\nonto their Medicaid rolls. But they are not directly\nsubject to the mandate, nor could they violate the\nmandate and incur a penalty.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Could I just understand, Mr.\nKatsas, when the States say that they're injured, are\nthey talking about the people who are eligible now but\nwho are not enrolled? Or are they also talking about\npeople who will become newly eligible?\nMR. KATSAS: It's people who will enroll --\npeople who wouldn't have enrolled had they been given a\nvoluntary choice.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But who are eligible now.\nMR. KATSAS: That's the largest category. I\nthink there could be future eligibles who would enroll\nbecause they're subject to a legal obligation but\nwouldn't have enrolled if given a voluntary choice.\nBut I'm happy to -- I'm happy to focus on\ncurrently eligible people who haven't enrolled in\nMedicaid. That particular class is the one that gives\nrise to, simply in Florida alone, a pocketbook injury on\nthe order of 500 to $600 million per year.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But that does seem odd, to\nsuggest that the State is being injured because people\nwho could show up tomorrow with or without this law\nwill show up in greater numbers. I mean, presumably the\nState wants to cover people whom it is declared eligible\nfor this benefit.\nMR. KATSAS: They could, but they don't.\nWhat the State wants to do is make Medicaid available to\nall who are eligible and choose to obtain it.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why would --\nMR. KATSAS: And in any event --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why would somebody not\nchoose to obtain it? Why -- that's one puzzle to me.\nThere's this category of people who are Medicaid\neligible; Medicaid doesn't cost them anything. Why\nwould they resist enrolling?\nMR. KATSAS: I -- I don't know, Justice\nGinsburg. All I know is that the difference between\ncurrent enrollees and people who could enroll but have\nnot is, as I said, on the -- is a $600 million delta.\nAnd --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it may be just that\nthey haven't been given sufficient information to\nunderstand that this is a benefit for them.\nMR. KATSAS: It's possible, but all we're\ntalking about right now is the standing of the States.\nAnd the only arguments made against the standing of the\nStates -- I mean, there is a classic pocketbook injury\nhere. The only arguments made about -- against the\nstanding of the States are, number one, this results\nfrom third-party actions. That doesn't work, because\nthe third-party actions are not unfettered in the sense\nof Lujan; they are coerced in the sense of\nBennett v. Spear. Those people are enrolling because\nthey're under a legal obligation to do so.\nThe second argument made against the States'\nstanding is that the States somehow forfeit their\nability to challenge the constitutionality of a\nprovision of Federal law because they voluntarily choose\nto participate --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm -- I'm a little bit\nconfused, and this is what I'm confused about: There --\nthere's a challenge to the individual mandate.\nMR. KATSAS: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right? What does\nthe fact that the State is challenging Medicaid -- how\ndoes it give the State standing to challenge an\nobligation that is not imposed on the State in any way?\nMR. KATSAS: The principal theory for State\nstanding is that States are challenging the mandate\nbecause the mandate injures them when people are forced\nto enroll in Medicaid.\nNow, it is true they are not directly\nsubject to the mandate, but --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Yes. That's what I'm --\nMR. KATSAS: Okay. Let me -- let me try\nto --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- a little confused by.\nMR. KATSAS: Let me try it this way -- may I\nfinish the thought?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.\nMR. KATSAS: In South Carolina v. Regan, the\nState was not subject to the tax at issue. The State\nwas harmed as the issuer of the bonds, and the bond\nholders were the ones subject to the tax. So, the State\nis injured not because it is the direct object of the\nFederal tax, but because of its relationship to the\nregulated party as issuer/bond holder.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Katsas.\nMR. KATSAS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Long, you have 5\nminutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. LONG\nAS THE COURT-APPOINTED AMICUS CURIAE\nMR. LONG: Everyone agrees that the section\n5000A penalty shall be assessed and collected in the\nsame manner as taxes. And the parties' principal\nargument why that does not make the Anti-Injunction Act\napplicable is that, well, that simply goes to the\nSecretary's activities.\nAnd I would simply ask, if you look at\nchapters 63 and 64 of the Internal Revenue Code, which\nare the chapters on assessment and collection, they are\nnot just addressed to the Secretary. There are many\nprovisions in there that are addressed to courts and\nindeed talk about this interaction, the very limited\nsituations in which courts are permitted to restrain the\nassessment and collection of taxes.\nThere was a statement made that there\naren't -- and many of the exceptions to the\nAnti-Injunction Act are in the assessment and collection\nprovisions -- there was a statement made that none of\nthese directly confer jurisdiction to restrain the\nassessment and collection of taxes. That's not true.\nIn footnote 11 of our opening brief, we cite several.\nI'll simply mention section 6213 as an\nexample. That says -- I quote: \"Notwithstanding the\nprovisions of section 7421(a), the making of such\nassessment or the beginning of such proceeding or levy\nduring the time such prohibition is in force may be\nenjoined by a proceeding in the proper court, including\nthe Tax Court. The Tax Court shall have no jurisdiction\nto enjoin any action or proceeding or order any refund\nunder this subsection unless a timely petition for\nredetermination of the deficiency has been filed and\nthen only in respect of the deficiency that is the\nsubject of such petition.\"\nJUSTICE BREYER: All that's going to really\nwhat I'd think Congress's intent was meant to be in\nsticking the collection thing into chapter 68, and --\nand it's certainly an argument in your favor.\nThe over-arching thing in my mind is it's up\nto Congress, within leeway. And they did not use that\nword \"tax,\" and they did have a couple of exceptions.\nAnd it is true that all this language that you quote --\nyou know, the first two sentences and so forth, it talks\nabout the use of \"tax\" in the IRC. It talks about the\npenalties and liabilities provided by this subchapter.\nAnd we look over here, and it's a penalty and liability\nprovided by a different law, which says collect it\nthrough the subchapter. And it has nothing to do with\nthe IRC. See?\nSo, we've got it in a separate place. We\ncan see pretty clearly what they're trying to do. They\ncouldn't really care very much about interfering with\ncollecting this one. That's all the statutory argument.\nAre you following me?\nMR. LONG: Well, I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You see? I'm trying to get\nyou to focus on that kind of argument that I'm just\nmaking.\nMR. LONG: I mean, I think I'm following\nyou, but the fact that it's not in the particular\nsubchapter for assessable penalties in my view makes no\ndifference, because they said it's still clearly -- it's\nassessed and collected in the same manner --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, it is.\nMR. LONG: -- as a penalty in that\nsubchapter, and those penalties are collected in the\nsame manner as taxes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, yes.\nMR. LONG: And so, that's -- I think it's\nrather detailed, but I think it's a rather clear\nindication that the Anti-Injunction Act applies.\nThe -- the refund statute that does\nspecifically refer to penalties -- that has nothing to\ndo with this argument that it's assessed and collected\nin the same manner as a tax. That would simply go to\nthe point that, well, you can't just call it a tax,\nbecause they've referred to it as a penalty.\nAnd, finally, on jurisdiction, you know, I\nthink the key point is we have a long line of this\nCourt's decisions that's really been ratified by\nCongress, with all these exceptions in jurisdictional\nterms.\nAs I read Bowles and John R. Sand & Gravel,\nthe gist of those decisions was not any sort of special\nrule about appeals, It's that when we have that\nsituation, which I would submit applies as much to the\ncollection of Federal taxes as it does to appeals from\nFederal district courts when we have this degree of --\nof precedent, including precedent from Congress in the\nform of amendments to this Anti-Injunction Act, that\nshould be -- the presumption should be that this is\njurisdictional.\nIf there are no further questions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Long, you were\ninvited by this Court to defend the proposition that the\nAnti-Injunction Act barred this litigation. You have\nably carried out that responsibility, for which the\nCourt is grateful.\nMR. LONG: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will continue\nargument in this case tomorrow.\n(Whereupon, at 11:41 a.m., the case in the\nabove-entitled matter was submitted.)\n64:7 65:1,19 agree
