ESKOW\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMS. ESKOW: Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nWhen parties knowingly and voluntarily proceed\nto trial before a magistrate judge, they consent within\nthe meaning of 28 U.S.C. section 636(c)(1). The plain\nlanguage of the statute confers case-dispositive authority\non full-time magistrate judges upon the consent of the\nparties. Congress did not specify in section 636 what\nform that consent should take. It did not include\nadjectives such as express or written, and the omission of\nsuch qualifiers is significant.\nQUESTION: How about Rule 73(b)?\nMS. ESKOW: Yes, Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice,\nRule 73 does require that the parties execute a consent\nform filed with the court, and it did not occur in this\ncase.\nHowever, a violation of that rule did not divest\nthe magistrate judge of authority to preside over the\ncase, and that is because the authority emanates from the\nstatute, specifically the requirement that the consent be\nvoluntary in 636(c)(1), and although it was error not to\nfollow the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure or the local\nrules for the Southern District of Texas, which may have\nhad writing requirements, these rules were related to\nprocedural safeguards to protect the voluntariness of the\nparties. They are not the consent requirement themselves,\nand it is the voluntariness of the agreement that gives a\nmagistrate judge authority to preside, not compliance with\ntechnicalities of statutory referral procedures.\nQUESTION: Do you agree that the consent has to\nprecede the action of the magistrate?\nMS. ESKOW:\nQUESTION: So that there had to have been\nconsent before he took any -- the magistrate took any\naction in the case?\nMS. ESKOW: Any case-dispositive actions under\nsection 636(c) --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMS. ESKOW: -- yes, that would have to be with\nthe consent of the parties.\nQUESTION: So that an hour into the trial,\nsomebody hands counsel a note that says, Your Honor, we've\nmade a mistake, our office said we can't consent to this,\nthe trial, the magistrate should say, too late, you've\nappeared, you've been deemed to have given consent?\nMS. ESKOW: Yes. Yes, Justice Kennedy.\nQUESTION: So it's like double jeopardy when\nthis first witness is sworn, or something like that?\nMS. ESKOW: Well, certainly, consent in our view\nis predicated on two things, and first it's notice that\nthe magistrate judge is proceeding in this case\ndispositive authority, and notice that the party has an\nopportunity to decline to consent to that procedure.\nQUESTION: So the first dispositive motion that\nhe rules on?\nMS. ESKOW: Certainly, that would be a signal,\nand yes, if a party did not object at that point, after\nbeing on notice that the magistrate judge was exercising\ncase-dispositive authority.\nQUESTION: Well, then, we need a whole\njurisprudence parallel to the simple rules that you all\ndidn't follow.\nMS. ESKOW: I'm sorry, Your Honor? The --\nQUESTION: We need a whole jurisprudence that's\nparallel to the simple rule. The -- the object of the\nrule was structural, in a sense. It was to bring home to\nthe parties that they had a choice, to make them consider\nthe choice, to make sure that the choice was not in any\nway forced on them or suggested to them, and it seems to\nme that your rule defeats all of that.\nMS. ESKOW: We would respectfully disagree,\nJustice Kennedy. Absolutely, the rule is designed to\nprotect the voluntariness of the parties' consent and to\nensure that they aren't coerced into agreeing to a\nprocedure and into relinquishing their right to an\nArticle III judge when it's not something that they\nvoluntarily choose to do, but those are merely the\nprocedures to protect the consent.\nThe consent itself is the predicate for the\nexercise of the authority, and although there was a\ndeparture from the local rules, and in this instance, it\nwas not merely on the part of two defendants who neglected\nto file a form but on the part of plaintiff Withrow, who\nneglected to obtain all parties' consent, as was his\nresponsibility under the local rules --\nQUESTION: Was he represented at the trial,\nWithrow?\nMS. ESKOW: No, Justice Ginsburg. He -- he was\npro -- he was pro se at that time.\nQUESTION: So -- so your rule is that a pro se\ndefendant has to tell the State of Texas how to comply\nwith the Federal rules?\nMS. ESKOW: No, Justice Kennedy. Certainly,\nthat was just an indication of the various mishaps that\ncan happen because of the nature of the varying local\nrequirements that exist in different districts. You also\nhad in this instance a district judge who referred the\ncase to the magistrate before the defendants had even been\nserved, much less had an opportunity to consent, and the\nmagistrate judge did not comply with local practice of\nconfirming on the record all parties' consent --\nQUESTION: But she was -- she --\nQUESTION: Well, can -- can local rules in one\ndistrict produce a different result than another district\nwhich didn't have that local review with respect to this\nsort of consent?\nMS. ESKOW:\nIn -- in this circumstance, certainly that authority\nemanates from the statute itself, and a local rule can't\ndetermine the authority of the magistrate judge. That\nwould apply nationally, and in every court, but --\nQUESTION: This local rule did require\nexpress -- it required consent in writing before the --\nthe proceeding, didn't it?\nMS. ESKOW: Yes, before even the case could be\nreferred the local requirement existed, but that was\ndeparted from both by the clerk, who provided a form to\nthe district judge before it had been signed by the\nparties, and by the district judge himself, who referred\nthe case without waiting for all parties' consent, or even\nall parties' service.\nQUESTION: Do -- do we know how this came about,\nbecause the magistrate, she was certainly aware of it.\nMS. ESKOW: Absolutely.\nQUESTION: And she asked the State, do you\nconsent, and whoever was representing the State said,\nwell, I have no authority to do that today.\nMS. ESKOW: That was at a preliminary\nproceeding, Justice Ginsburg, a Spears hearing, that was to\ndetermine whether or not plaintiff Withrow's claim should\neven be permitted to proceed, or whether he should be\npermitted to proceed in forma pauperis and whether service\nwould be affected. No defendant had been served at that\npoint. It was an evaluation under section 1915(a) of\nwhether this prisoner suit should be allowed to proceed,\nand at that time there was a representative of the\nAttorney General's Office present at the hearing, merely\nin an informational capacity, but none of the defendants\nhad been served, and they were not yet represented, so she\nindicated at that hearing that she could not consent on\ntheir behalf.\nLater on, after that hearing, when it was\ndetermined that some claims could proceed, there was\nservice on the defendants, and that was effected on a\ndifferent Attorney General, who in turn assigned it to the\nAttorney General -- the Assistant Attorney General who did\nrepresent the defendants at trial and filed answers on\ntheir behalf, and -- and that attorney did neglect to file\nthe required forms.\nHowever, at the time of service, the case had\nalready been referred, and he did not go back to confirm\nwhether previously the forms were on file, but everyone in\nthis proceeding was assuming that all the parties\nconsented because the case was already before the\nmagistrate judge, and everyone was acting in accordance\nwith a section 636(c)(1) referral. Indeed, in the\nreferral order that the district judge signed that sent\nthe case to the magistrate judge, it specified that if the\ndefendants did not consent, they merely needed to indicate\nthat to the court and it would go back to the district\njudge, so certainly there was an awareness that the case\nwas proceeding pursuant to the dispositive, case\ndispositive provisions in subsection (c).\nQUESTION: And one of the defendants did put in\na form.\nMS. ESKOW: Yes, who was represented by separate\ncounsel, and that counsel did follow the instructions from\nthe court and -- and did comply, and that was not complied\nwith by the attorney who was representing the two\ndefendants at trial in this case, but everything that that\nattorney did was consistent with and demonstrated the\nparties' consent in this instance, including filing a\ndispositive motion with the -- the court that the\nmagistrate judge could grant only if she had authority\nunder subsection (c), and only if she had the parties'\nconsent, and when she denied that motion and made that\nadverse ruling, that she could only do with the parties'\nconsent, these defendants never once objected, they did\nnot dispute that they consented, instead, they asked her\nto reconsider the merits of their summary judgment motion.\nQUESTION: Ms. Eskow, the statute, 636(c)(2),\ndeals with the clerk of the court shall notify the parties\nof the availability of a magistrate, and then it goes on\nto say, the decision of the parties shall be communicated\nto the clerk of the court. Does the use of communicated\nto the clerk suggest that it be express? What is that\nrequirement? How does that enter in?\nMS. ESKOW: Certainly, communicated to -- to the\nclerk suggests that -- that the clerk will be informed of\nthe decision. When the parties filed a dispositive motion\nthat invoked, affirmatively invoked the case-dispositive\nauthority, that was before the clerk and would have\nnotified the clerk that they were --\nQUESTION: And satisfied that requirement?\nMS. ESKOW: It would, and moreover, it's\nsubsection (1) that discusses the authority of the\nmagistrate judge --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMS. ESKOW: -- and speaks only of consent that\nis the provision of the statute in which Congress gave\nthis grant of authority.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMS. ESKOW: Subsection (2) is a procedural\nmechanism for ensuring the voluntariness, that's the\nrequirement under subsection (1).\nQUESTION: And was it complied with here fully,\ndo you think --\nMS. ESKOW: With subsection --\nQUESTION: -- subsection (2)?\nMS. ESKOW: Subsection (2), in this instance,\nno. Because of the local procedures that are requested\nthe district courts develop under subsection (2), they\nwere not complied with by any of the parties or any of the\njudges in this case, so there was a departure, but because\nthere was full compliance of subsection (1), in that the\nparties all voluntarily agreed, absolutely there was\nauthority to proceed.\nQUESTION: May I just ask you a technical\nquestion about the local rule? I -- as I recall, wherever\nit was referred to, it was referred to not as rule, but as\norder. Does everybody in the case agree that whatever\nthis order was, it had the status of a local rule for\npurposes of this case?\nMS. ESKOW: Yes, Justice Souter. That is not\ndisputed by any of the parties. That is just the\nmechanism by which the Southern District of Texas\nimplemented it as a general order. It is printed in\nwriting, it is signed by the judges of the court, the\nchief judge of the court, and it's something that is\nrespected by all parties as being the local rule in that\ncase.\nCongress' intent not to require any specified\nform of consent is evidenced by the language in (c)(1)\nitself, where the first provision is -- for full-time\nmagistrate judges does not require any form of written\nconsent, it merely speaks to consent. In the very next\nsentence of the statute, which is on page 3a of the\nappendix in the petitioners' brief on the merits, the\nstatute specifies that for part-time magistrate judges,\nthere has to be a specific written request by the parties\nin order for the magistrate judge to exercise case\ndispositive authority, and the fact that Congress in the\nvery next sentence chose to insert and to require a\nwritten consent indicates that Congress did not intend to\nmake the same sort of requirement with respect to\nfull-time magistrate judges, because that adjective is --\nis lacking, and the Court should not engraft terms onto\nthe statute that Congress chose not to include.\nQUESTION: I take it from your argument this\nmorning you would say that these defendants -- suppose\nthey lost. Suppose the plaintiff won. They could not\nthen say, magistrate, you never had any authority because\nwe did not give you in advance written permission to\nproceed. They could not -- they would be bound. Is that\nyour view?\nMS. ESKOW: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, if the court\nwere to adopt an inferred consent rule and -- and\ndetermine consent based on the parties' voluntary conduct\nbeforehand, and there was notice, and there was a clear\nindication of conforming to 636(c) --\nQUESTION: But I'm not asking the question\nhypothetically. I'm asking, in this case.\nMS. ESKOW: In this case? Yes, my understanding\nis that no party had -- had even thought, it had not\ncrossed any party's mind that consent was lacking and that\nall parties were intending to be bound by the judgment.\nQUESTION: But if the defendants, having lost\ninstead of having prevailed, then said, aha, now we can\nget out of it because we never formalized our consent,\nyou -- you are saying that they could not have -- that on\nthese, on the facts of this case they could not have bowed\nout if they lost?\nMS. ESKOW: Yes, Your Honor. We believe that\nthat is the -- the correct approach. Certainly, in the\nSeventh and Eleventh Circuits, where those courts require\nexpress post judgment consent separate and apart from\nlooking at the underlying conduct, in those situations\nthere is not an effective judgment if the parties refuse\nto put express consent on the record after the fact.\nThat is certainly one approach to the statute.\nIt's one approach that we believe is valid, because\nrequiring that express consent at some point in the\nproceedings to confirm the earlier conduct is something\nthat -- that would protect the voluntariness concerns\nCongress had, but we don't believe that it's required\nin -- in terms of the authority, that the authority comes\nfrom the voluntary agreement that's evidenced from how the\nparties proceeded, and certainly, if the Court wished to\navoid the gaming concerns that the Fifth Circuit expressed\nunder the type of post judgment consent rule that the\nSeventh and Eleventh Circuits adopted, then adopting an\ninferred consent rule would eliminate that by requiring\nparties to be bound by the bargain they struck.\nQUESTION: Ms. Eskow, I take it all of the\ncourts of appeals that have addressed this question have\nfound express consent required?\nMS. ESKOW: Yes, Justice O'Connor, that's\nabsolutely true, but there's nothing in the statute that\nmakes that requirement. Indeed, another provision of the\nFederal Magistrates Act, the provision governing\nmisdemeanor trial authority, that's in 18 U.S.C. section\n3401(b), requires not -- it used to require written\nconsent. In 1996, Congress amended the act to require\nonly oral consent, but it specified that it could be oral\nor written, but that it needed to be express. The words,\nexpressly consents, are in that provision, and certainly\nneither the word express, nor the word oral or written,\nexist in 636(c)(1).\nQUESTION: You suggested earlier that the second\nsentence of -- of (c) -- of (c)(1) contains the written --\nthe writing request, whereas the first second -- sentence\ndoesn't.\nMS. ESKOW: Yes.\nQUESTION: But the writing request in the second\nsentence is a request for the -- the magistrate to\nparticipate, rather than the consent itself. It says,\nupon the consent of the parties pursuant to this specific\nwritten request. There's no requirement of writing with\nrespect to the request in the first sentence, but that\ndoesn't necessarily disavow the need for writing in the --\nto evidence the consent itself.\nMS. ESKOW: We would read the statute\ndifferently, Justice Stevens, that the fact that it says,\nupon the consent of the parties pursuant to their specific\nrequest, would indicate that the consent of the parties\nhas to be pursuant to their written request.\nQUESTION: That's right, but there doesn't have\nto be a written request with respect to the first\nsentence. There just has to be -- if one reads it the\nother -- the way your opponent does it, there just has to\nbe a writing evidencing the consent itself.\nMS. ESKOW:\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMS. ESKOW: That the writing requirement only\nexists with respect to the part-time magistrate judge, and\nthat that goes to the consent as well.\nQUESTION: That's not expressed. I'm saying,\nthat's not expressed, but I'm just saying that it's not --\nit's not -- the two -- the writing requirement that is\nreferred to in the second sentence is not an exact\nparallel of what they contend the -- the writing\nrequirement is in the first sentence.\nMS. ESKOW: Well, certainly respondent has a\nvariety of writing requirements, and one that they deem to\nbe dictated by the local rules as well, which is something\nthat's not spoken to in subsection (c)(1). Certainly,\nthe -- the statute in (c)(1) imposes no sort of express or\nwritten requirement with respect to consent or with\nrespect to requesting a magistrate judge --\nQUESTION: Well, of course, that's the issue.\nMS. ESKOW: -- in any form.\nQUESTION: Yes, that's the issue.\nMS. ESKOW: And the absence of that we believe\nis significant because -- in these other provisions\nbecause in the misdemeanor trial authority, it requires\nconsent, and is probably the closest analogy to the trial\nauthority in subsection (c)(1).\nconsent required, and it specifies that it can be oral or\nwritten.\nQUESTION: The obvious reading of a statute like\nthis I would think, and you tell me why I'm not right, but\nit just means consent in such form as the judicial\nconference or local rules provide. I mean, Congress is\nperfectly aware in these procedural statutes that judges\nhave rulemaking authority and that they elaborate the\nstatute through rule.\nMS. ESKOW: Certainly, Congress is aware of\ncommon sense meaning of consent, and in substance --\nQUESTION: Well, it's also aware that they're\nwriting a statute for the judiciary that's implemented\nthrough rule, and where you have a term like this, that is\nimplemented through rule, that everybody would think it\nwould be implemented through rule, the word consent in the\nstatute means consent in the form that the rules provide.\nDoes Congress have to add that every time in -- I mean,\nisn't it obvious? Or perhaps it isn't, but why isn't it?\nMS. ESKOW: We don't believe it's obvious,\nJustice Breyer, because if it was the form of the local\nrules, or the form of consent prescribed by local rules\nthat determined the authority, you would have magistrate\njudges with different authority in a variety of\njurisdictions across the country.\nQUESTION: So what's wrong with that? I mean,\nif the local rule is okay, what's wrong with that, I mean,\nif that's what the rule authorities want to do?\nMS. ESKOW: Certainly it may be a good idea as a\nmatter of policy --\nQUESTION: No, no, it's a matter of law.\nMS. ESKOW: -- to require.\nQUESTION: It's a matter of law. Very often,\nCongress legislates, and they use words like consent, and\nso forth, and those are implemented. I don't want to just\nrepeat the point. I want to be -- I want to see what you\ncan --\nMS. ESKOW: Certainly, our view is that because\nCongress specified the requirements for local rules in a\nseparate subsection than the consent requirement itself,\nit was anticipating that there would be some need to\nprotect the voluntariness, but that it is the\nvoluntariness that's the cornerstone, and that it would be\na matter of administrative discretion on the local level.\nQUESTION: Assume you lose on that, just for the\nsake of argument.\nMS. ESKOW: Yes.\nQUESTION: Then I guess the other question is\nwhether you can cure the violation by not objecting on\nappeal.\nMS. ESKOW: That certainly is the question.\nQUESTION: And what is your answer to that?\nMS. ESKOW: The -- yes, absolutely.\nQUESTION: Because?\nMS. ESKOW: Because the underlying voluntary\nconsent is there through the parties' conduct, and to the\nextent the court construes the statute --\nQUESTION: No, no, I'm saying, suppose that\nthere is not consent. Suppose I were to believe that the\nword consent in the statute picks up the method of the\nrule, at least it rules out implied consent, so suppose I\nheld against you on that point, then still you'd say, we\nwin anyway, because we can waive this requirement by just\nnot objecting on appeal.\nWhen -- when the other side appeals it we say,\nwe don't care, or when you appeal it the other side says,\nwe don't care. We consent now. We consent now to what\nhappens then?\nMS. ESKOW: Well, certainly --\nQUESTION: Now what, about that?\nMS. ESKOW: Assuming there is a violation of --\nof the rule, and that their consent is not lacking, the\nquestion is, what is the consequence for noncompliance\nwith the rule, and certainly the failure to comply with\nthese procedures, for that to be an automatic grounds for\nreversal would be a deviation from accepted practice,\nwhich is a party has to object to a proceeding, has to\npreserve error, and here, no party objected, and it is\ntheir personal right to the Article III judge. It is\ntheir personal consent --\nQUESTION: But the argument is --\nMS. ESKOW: -- that is at stake.\nQUESTION: -- of course, that you can't cure a\nbasic jurisdictional problem. You -- both parties could\nnot go out on the street, pick the third person whom you\nsee and say, you decide our case, and then you appeal his\ndecision, and when somebody says, who's that person, you\nsay, we waive all the claims that he isn't a judge.\nMS. ESKOW: Well, certainly, if Congress had not\nprovided for a scheme that existed, and the parties\nrandomly invoked the authority of a person on the street,\nthat would be a problem, but here, you have a magistrate\njudge who has been specifically assigned by Congress to\nperform this function and has been designated by the\ndistrict judge of the court, and the only question is,\nhave the parties agreed, and if -- and if no party objects\nto that and the magistrate judge enters the final\njudgment, even if there's been noncompliance with the\nrules, the question is, what is the harm, and even --\nQUESTION:\njurisdictional in the strict sense of the word?\nMS. ESKOW: No. No, Your Honor, absolutely not.\nIt's not a question of subject matter jurisdiction. The\nterm, jurisdiction, solely is a question of authority of\nthe powers of the magistrate judge to act.\nQUESTION: Do you think it's like personal\njurisdiction, or more -- it's more like personal\njurisdiction or subject matter --\nMS. ESKOW: It's more --\nQUESTION: Because if you say personal, then you\nhave on your side the rule that a general appearance,\ngeneral -- as a --\nMS. ESKOW: Absolutely.\nQUESTION: -- as a rule waives deficiencies.\nMS. ESKOW: And that it can be waived\ninadvertently, even by failing to timely assert the\nperson --\nQUESTION: My question is why, because the\nargument that it is like a person on the street is that a\nmagistrate who is not an Article III judge is going to\npreside over a jury trial, and the result of that trial\nwill have all the trappings and -- and dignity and\nenforcement power of a judgment of a court of the United\nStates, and the only way this could possibly occur is if\nthe parties consent, particularly since it's a jury trial,\nand where they don't consent, he really is like a person\noff the street, because of the importance of what the\nparties are giving up in order to obtain his judgment\nrather than that of an Article III judge.\nAll right, now that's the other side's argument.\nNow, I want to know how you respond.\nMS. ESKOW: Well, certainly in Peretz versus\nUnited States this Court considered a circumstance where,\nin a felony trial, a magistrate judge was supervising the\nvoir dire, and the defendant's counsel did not make any\nobjection to that when it went on, and this Court\ndetermined, both from a personal litigant Article III\nperspective, as well as from a structural perspective,\nthat there was no infirmity in that procedure, and that a\ndefendant who does not assert his right to an Article III\njudge has no cognizable right that he can enforce, and\nthat would be the same circumstance here, for the same\nreasons why the felony voir dire was permissible without\nobjection of the defendant in Peretz versus United States.\nHere, without objection from the parties, with\ntheir fully informed knowledge of the nature of the\nproceedings, and their proceeding through judgment\naffirmatively invoking the authority of the judge, it is\ndirectly parallel to the situation in Peretz versus United\nStates, and certainly the litigants waived their personal\nArticle III right to a district judge, and the same\nstructural protections that this Court deemed sufficient\nin Peretz also would exist here, because the magistrate\njudge is appointed, or direct -- referred the case only by\nthe district judge, the district judge can at any point in\ntime, sua sponte, for good cause, take the referral back\nfrom the magistrate judge, and -- and supervises the\nprocess. That insulates it from separations of powers\nconcerns that --\nQUESTION: One of -- one of the insulating\nfeatures in the suggested form and the rules of civil\nprocedure makes it express that the consent form is not to\nbe communicated to the judge or the magistrate in order to\nprotect the attorneys who don't consent so that the\nmagistrate or the judge doesn't know which party doesn't\nconsent, and your rule completely destroys that.\nMS. ESKOW: No, Your Honor. We -- in this\ninstance, certainly if the parties are voluntarily\nproceeding with knowledge, a magistrate judge would be\naware that they were going forward and that there are\nrules that inferred consent is what satisfies the statute,\nthen yes, a magistrate judge would know when a party, upon\nnotice both of their right to object and of the nature of\nproceeding, invoked the affirmative authority, yes, the\nmagistrate judge at that time would know that the parties\nhave made the dissent.\nQUESTION: Well, no, but you -- you presume a\nregime in which the magistrate said, I'm ready to proceed,\nand you -- somebody stands up and says, well, I don't\nconsent. I mean, that's -- that's the regime you want us\nto adopt, so that -- that destroys the confidentiality.\nMS. ESKOW: Well, certainly in many\ncircumstances the -- the local rules do provide for the\ncommunication to the clerk, and that is what Rule 73\nprovides.\nAs a matter of practice, however, in 1990,\nCongress relaxed the consent provisions to permit\ndiscussions between the district judge and the magistrate\njudge about consent, that they could remind the parties\nthat they could consent to a magistrate judge, and that\nthat was a topic that could be discussed in -- in the\ncourtroom provided that there was no coercion to consent.\nIf --\nQUESTION: Where did -- where did the Congress\ndo that? You say the Congress did that?\nMS. ESKOW: In 1990, Congress amended subsection\n(c)(2) to loosen the consent requirements, and certainly\nit still anticipated that the decision is going to go to\nthe clerk of court, but magistrate judges and district\njudges are not prohibited from discussing the matter of a\nreferral with the parties, and if a party failed to sign\nthe requisite form, certainly there'd be no -- no\nprejudice by proceeding to inform the judge at the time\nthat the issue came up that they did consent, and\ncertainly, to -- to wait until the eve of trial, when\nevery indication was that they had consented, and to\nwithdraw it at that point, an inferred consent rule would\nbe more consistent with holding the parties to the benefit\nof their bargain.\nQUESTION: May I just make one -- ask you one\nclarifying question for me? Is it your position that\nit -- it is not necessary either to consent in advance, or\nto have the consent in writing?\nMS. ESKOW: No, Justice Stevens. We believe\nthat you do have to consent. You have to voluntarily\nagree before the magistrate judge can act.\nQUESTION: But -- but wasn't there a finding\nthat that did not occur in this case?\nMS. ESKOW: No, Your Honor, the -- only a\nfinding that they did not expressly consent. The\nmagistrate judge expressed -- actually did find that they\nclearly had implied their consent by their conduct, but\ndeemed implied consent insufficient. The only piece that\nwas missing was an express memorialization of the\nvoluntary agreement that did exist.\nQUESTION: The statutory provision that you --\nthat you cited, which provides for subsequent discussions,\nis predicated on the fact that consent has first been\ncommunicated to the clerk of the court.\nMS. ESKOW: Well --\nQUESTION: So Congress basically talked about\nthis discussion process against the backdrop of a consent\nform that had already been communicated to the clerk.\nMS. ESKOW: We would disagree, Justice Kennedy.\nThe legislative history actually indicates that the -- the\nprovision was intended to enable the district judge and\nthe magistrate judges to inform --\nQUESTION: But that's not what the statute says.\nMS. ESKOW: -- to inform the parties of the\navailability, irrespective of whether they had actually\nalready consented, because too many magistrate judges and\ndistrict judges believed that they -- they could not go on\nrecord.\nQUESTION: Do you want to reserve the remainder\nof your time, Ms. Eskow?\nMS. ESKOW: Thank you.\nQUESTION: Ms. Frost, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF AMANDA FROST\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. FROST:\nCourt:\nAll parties must expressly consent before a\nmagistrate may exercise jurisdiction under section 636(c).\nFirst and foremost, this is because the text of the\nMagistrates Act and Rule 73(b) require express consent.\nIn addition --\nQUESTION: Oh, the text does not require express\nconsent. I beg to differ.\nMS. FROST: I'd like to --\nQUESTION: It does not. I think that's how you\nwant us to interpret it, but I don't think the word is\nthere, is it?\nMS. FROST: The word, express, is not there,\nYour Honor. It is in Rule 73(b), and in addition, I'd\nlike to point Your Honor -- Your Honor to some of the\nprovisions of 636(c) which strongly indicate that the\nconsent must be expressed.\nQUESTION: What part of 73(b) uses the word\nexpress?\nMS. FROST: 73(b) refers -- it does not use the\nword express, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: So then neither the statute nor the\nrule use the term express, as you suggested earlier.\nMS. FROST: Neither use the term, express. Rule\n73(b) refers to the -- that the parties shall execute and\nfile a consent form. That is a written form of consent\nthat obviously must be express. It couldn't -- wouldn't\nbe possible to file in writing a consent without that\nbeing express. It is our position here that written\nconsent is required, and I used the word express only\nbecause this Court need not go that far in this case,\nbecause these -- the petitioners here not only failed to\nfile their consent in writing, as 73 requires, but they\nalso failed to articulate consent at all, and -- and so\nthere is no need to reach the -- the question of whether a\nconsent must be in writing.\nQUESTION: Well, it could be implied. That's\nthe question of whether the consent, if it is required, as\nit appears to be, could be implied, and if there ever were\na case for implying consent, this is that case.\nMS. FROST: I -- I respectfully disagree, Your\nHonor. For example, I think that everything that these\npetitioners did was as consistent with an intent to\nwithhold consent as to give consent, and I'd like to show\nyou as an example the motion for summary judgment that was\nfiled in this case that petitioners have pointed to as\nbeing evidence of clear consent. It's captioned, To the\nHonorable Judge of the District Court, and it was\nsubmitted to the clerk. In addition, a magistrate may\nreview a motion for summary judgment under 636(b) without\nthe parties' consent, so nothing that the petitioners did\nby submitting this motion indicated their -- their intent\nto consent to these proceedings.\nQUESTION: But wasn't there a trial?\nMS. FROST: Yes, there certainly was, Your\nHonor.\nQUESTION: They -- they did participate in the\ntrial.\nMS. FROST: Yes.\nQUESTION: So even if filing that motion did not\ngive implied consent, perhaps it could be argued that\nsimply participating in the trial gave it.\nMS. FROST: Yes, Your Honor, that is\npetitioners' argument, and the reason I think that\nargument cannot be -- is not in accord with the language\nof the Magistrates Act is, first of all, consent is used\nconsistently throughout the act to be -- to mean an\nexpress statement. For example, in 636(h), a retired\nmagistrate may come out of retirement and serve again upon\nthe consent of the -- of the chief judge of the district\ncourt, and I don't think even petitioners would argue that\nthat consent could be implied in the sense that the chief\njudge never said or wrote that the retired judge --\nQUESTION: But it's used in a little bit\ndifferent sense there.\npermission of the chief judge, which you know, I think\nyou're quite right in saying that that would not be\nsatisfied by simply doing nothing, but in -- in a case\nwhere you're talking about an agreement, I -- I think\nit's -- the law is different in some -- in some respects.\nMS. FROST: Well, I respectfully disagree, Your\nHonor, because both provisions, 636(h) and 636(c)(1) use\nthe term, upon consent, and I think that where Congress\nused the same term throughout the statute, it should be\ninterpreted to have the same meaning, but that's not the\nonly provision I rely on.\nThere's the fact that the Congress thought\nconsent would be communicated to the parties. There's the\nfact that Congress said, upon consent, meaning consent\nmust come first. It makes no sense to say, consent must\ncome first, if what Congress meant was, simply by showing\nup once the magistrate starts exercising that authority,\nwe are going to consider you to have consented.\nQUESTION: Why not? If -- Justice Kennedy\nbrought up the analogy to personal jurisdiction. If one\nmakes a general appearance just by showing up in court,\nthen any question of whether the court would otherwise\nhave jurisdiction is gone, because there is jurisdiction,\npersonal jurisdiction by consent, just by making a general\nappearance, so why isn't showing up in that magistrate's\ncourtroom, going to trial without objecting, why isn't\nthat equivalent to a general appearance?\nMS. FROST: Justice Ginsburg, the answer to your\nquestion is that there is in the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure Rule 12, which says that showing up will be\nwaiving your right, and here we have a statute that\nrequires consent, and it's important to look at why\nCongress wanted that. Congress was clearly very concerned\nthat consent be voluntary, willing, and knowing.\nPetitioners agree, and the question is, what is the best\nway to protect that? Express consent protects the consent\nand ensures that it is voluntary.\nQUESTION: I could understand that in the\nabstract. In the concrete, as applied to this case, if\nthe plaintiff, the pro se plaintiff didn't consent and\nthen lost, I could see an argument there, but this is the\nState Attorney General, and when they show up and they go\nto trial, it seems to me it's reasonable to imply that\nthey have consented.\nMS. FROST: I think not, Your Honor, for a few\nreasons. First of all, there is nothing that would have\nstopped these parties from -- from arguing after the fact\nthat they hadn't intended to consent, and there's no\nevidence as a result of the fact that the counsel\nfailed to specifically consent --\nQUESTION: Well, how -- how could they have made\nthat argument in this case, say, well, we just forgot\nabout the rule, we didn't know, or --\nMS. FROST: The argument they would make is --\nQUESTION: I -- I just can't imagine what the\nState Attorney General would say, after having\nparticipated in a trial and say, well you know, I really\ndidn't consent.\nMS. FROST: I think that what the State Attorney\nGeneral would say was, I had not realized that my -- I had\nnot realized that I had not checked with my clients, that\nI had not -- because the State Attorney General took this\ncase over, he -- he could say, I had not realized that my\nclients had not already agreed to do this, they have a\nright to an Article III judge.\nQUESTION: Well, but it -- I mean, who -- who is\nthe Attorney General's client except State officials?\nMS. FROST: Well, I think, Your Honor -- that's\ntrue, Your Honor, but these questions go to the question\nof whether Congress intended different consent standards\nfor different parties, and also to the question of whether\nCongress would want this kind of satellite litigation on\nthe question of consent.\nI think it is telling that these -- that the\npetitioners in this case, when asked whether they\nconsented, said they could not, never consented, the\ndocuments they submitted to the district court were\ncaptioned to the district court, they did not indicate\nthat they intended to go before a magistrate. Would\nCongress have wanted courts to have to deal with the\nsatellite litigation of parties arguing whether they did\nor didn't consent?\nQUESTION: But Ms. Frost --\nQUESTION: Well, once this --\nQUESTION: -- you're asking them to engage in\nmuch more than satellite litigation over consent. The\nresult of your position is that there will be a whole new\ntrial, so it's going to engage the court much more than\nmaking a determination whether, in fact, the State\nofficials consented by appearing before the magistrate,\nso --\nMS. FROST: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, that is true\nin this case, but if the rule is explicit consent rather\nthan inferred consent, and if that is established as the\nrule, then there will be far fewer occasions on which\nmistakes are made.\nQUESTION: But it was the -- but it was the\nlocal rule.\nMS. FROST: Yes.\nQUESTION:\nwith only the consequences, and I could see if this were a\nbig question of subject matter jurisdiction, you'd say\nthat the parties can't waive that, but this kind of rule\nis at a much lower level.\nMS. FROST: Well, I respectfully disagree, Your\nHonor. I think that, both throughout the Magistrates Act\nand the legislative history, Congress referred to section\n636(c) as an expansion of the magistrate's jurisdiction to\nact, and that jurisdiction can only be invoked upon the\nconsent of the parties.\nQUESTION: No, but if you're saying that that\njurisdiction is on the level, as I think you are, on the\nlevel with subject matter jurisdiction --\nMS. FROST: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- then it seems to me you've proved\ntoo much, because if it were -- if Congress were assuming\nit was on that level, Congress wouldn't have done this in\nthe first place. You can't consent to subject matter\njurisdiction, and you can't consent to it by filing\nwritten forms before trial, so we've got to make the\nassumption, just as Justice Ginsburg did in her question,\nthat we're dealing with an interest which Congress viewed\nat a very lower level.\nMS. FROST: I respectfully disagree, Justice\nSouter, and here's why.\nto subject matter jurisdiction, it's a question of what\ndid Congress say are the limits of the magistrate's --\nQUESTION: No, but I mean, we -- I'll -- I'll\ngrant you that -- I mean, I read the statute, this -- and\nthe rule the same way you do. Of course, what Congress\nhad in mind was consent beforehand, and I think you're\nright, consent in -- in written form.\nThe question is, if -- if that consent is not\ngiven, and a whole trial is held, did Congress regard the\nsubject of the consent as being on the same level as\nsubject matter jurisdiction so that it could not possibly\neither be satisfied by -- by an -- an inferred consent or\ncorrected afterwards, and if it were on the level of\nsubject matter jurisdiction, then there couldn't have been\nconsent in the first place, so we've got to assume that\nCongress regarded the interest here as something less\nsignificant than, say, subject matter jurisdiction.\nMS. FROST: I would not put it quite in those\nterms, in terms of less significant. I think what\nCongress did was establish thresholds to the magistrate's\nexercise of jurisdiction, and this is separate and apart\nfrom saying this is a Federal question case. Of course,\nwe agree with that. This case was properly in Federal\ncourt.\nThe question is, were the two prerequisites to\nthe magistrate's exercise of authority met? One is the\ndesignation by the district court, and the other is\nconsent.\nQUESTION: 630 -- 636(c), as you point out,\ntalks about the consent of the parties. Now, supposing an\nattorney for a party comes in, signs a consent form, and\nthen the -- he loses the case. Can the client later come\nin and say, I never authorized the attorney to sign that\nconsent form?\nMS. FROST: First notice -- that's, I think, a\nquestion that's -- it's arguable, but I would think that\nthe argument would be that no, the client at that point is\nbound by the attorney's representation, just as clients\nare bound by their attorney's representations in many\nother situations.\nQUESTION: But they aren't bound by their\nattorney's representations in some criminal cases. I\nmean, the -- the client must make the decision. You don't\nthink this is one of them?\nMS. FROST: I -- I think the -- it's arguable,\nbut the answer I think is no, because there are many very\nimportant decisions that counsel -- they're supposed to\nconsult with their client and, indeed, it would be a\nviolation of the Rules of Professional Responsibility if\nthey didn't in this instance on this question of consent,\nbut if for some reason the counsel made an error,\nfrequently litigants are at the mercy of their counsel.\nQUESTION: I -- I thought they were going to\nask -- I agree, Peretz is not in point, because it's an\nissue where they did consent, but the -- the -- there is a\ndoctrine called the de facto officer doctrine, and that\nmeans that if it's a fairly unimportant error, it can be\nwaived. For example, if a judge sat in the wrong\ndistrict, or the judge was designated to sit while the\nother judge was sick, and then the other judge died, so he\nwasn't just sick. I mean, and these were all errors, and\nthe court said, well, they do not go to jurisdiction,\nthey're waivable.\nNow, why isn't this case like that, at least if\nwe assume there was real consent given, it was just\nimplied. It violates the statute all right, but no real\nharm is done, if they want to waive it, they can?\nMS. FROST: Yes, well, Justice Breyer, the first\nresponse to the de facto officer doctrine is that that is\nsupposed to apply to minor errors, and --\nQUESTION: That's right. They'll say, this is\nsort of minor.\nMS. FROST: And --\nQUESTION: Because after all it's not that\nimportant, given the fact they gave the consent anyway.\nAt least, they showed up for trial.\nMS. FROST: I was going to say, it's not that\nimportant considering the fact that they expressly\nconsented after the fact of the trial, but that, of\ncourse, cannot be what this Court relies on, or --\nQUESTION: No, but I'm asking you really to\nanswer, why isn't it trivial? Why is it important? Why\nisn't it small enough that it could be waived? Why is it\ngrand enough that it implicates what we call\njurisdictional error, the parties can't cure it, they\ncan't waive it?\nMS. FROST: Justice Breyer, the answer to your\nquestion is first that Congress created it as a\njurisdictional threshold, second, that Congress was very\naware of the constitutional issues that arise when you\ndelegate Article III powers to non-Article III actors, and\nfor that reason, Congress repeatedly stated it wanted\nconsent to be voluntary, knowing, and willing. It was\nconcerned that less-advantaged litigants might be coerced,\nor might not realize that they have a right to an\nArticle III judge. For this reason, Congress --\nQUESTION: But then, if it's jurisdictional as\nyou say --\nMS. FROST: Uh-huh.\nQUESTION:\nTitle 28, 1653 reads, defective allegations of\njurisdiction may be amended upon terms in the trial\nappellate court. A provision like that would take care of\nthe pro se person, because the court could say, on terms\nit's not fair to hold this person, this pro se litigant to\nconsent that that person didn't give, but that it's\nperfectly appropriate to hold the State Attorney General,\nso even if we grant that it was jurisdiction, why doesn't\n60 -- 1653 take care of it, saying defective allegations\nof jurisdiction may be amended even in the appellate\ncourt?\nMS. FROST: I think that would not be\nsufficient, Your Honor, because it would change the\nlanguage of the statute, and in addition it would -- the\nquestion would have to arise, what would happen if the\nAttorney General came in at the end of this process and\nsaid, I didn't consent, and I think that there would be a\nstrong basis on this record for the Attorney General to\nproceed on that argument successfully.\nThe rule in the Fifth Circuit that the Attorney\nGeneral was supposed to be familiar with was that all the\nparties must submit written consent before trial, so the\nfact that they didn't would be strong evidence they had\nnot intended to consent.\nThen you have the fact that all their pleadings\nare captioned to the district court, you have the fact\nthat there was some switching off of counsel so it's not\nclear whether the individuals, individual defendants here\nhad ever been consulted, or ever had an opportunity to\nobject.\nQUESTION: Is the customary way in the Southern\nDistrict of Texas to caption a pleading, Before the\nMagistrate Judge, if the magistrate judge is presiding?\nMS. FROST: I do not know the customary way that\npleadings are captioned. I do know that, from looking\nthrough the record in this case, that later pleadings,\nonce the issue had come up that the magistrate -- that\nthere was never explicit consent before the trial, and\nlater pleadings did not have that caption, so it had been\ntaken out, and I guess my point in --\nQUESTION: What did the later pleadings have?\nMS. FROST: Nothing. There was -- there was not\nin -- in the summary judgment motion that I appealed there\nis in all caps, a line that says, to the Honorable Judge\nof the District Court, and in the later pleadings that\nline was simply removed. There was nothing there.\nBut my point, Your Honor, is not -- yes, that\nmay have been a form caption. I don't dispute that. My\npoint is that there is nothing, from their submitting of a\nmotion for summary judgment, that indicates their consent.\nQUESTION: What happens with our -- suppose you\nhave a defective diversity suit, and you get up to the\ncourt of appeals and suddenly discover that one of the\ndefendants is from the same State, that there are many\ndefendants, and so the party says, oh, don't worry, we'll\ndrop him out, so they drop him out at the appellate stage.\nDoes that rescue the whole case, or do you have to do it\nall over again? What happens? I don't know.\nMS. FROST: This Court's decision in the\nCaterpillar case held that as long as there is the -- as\nlong as diversity is met at the time of the entry of\njudgment, then that is acceptable, but that isn t your\nhypothetical.\nQUESTION: Entry of which judgment, of the lower\ncourt's --\nMS. FROST: The district court, the lower\ncourt's judgment.\nQUESTION: The district court, so you'd say if\nwe're doing it by analogy, you win?\nMS. FROST: Yes. Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Who do you suppose was intended to be\nprotected by these congressional requirements? The point\nof my question is, wasn't the point to protect people who\ndidn't want to be tried by a magistrate judge, and if that\nis the answer, why is someone in your position, or your\nclient's position, in a position to object at all here?\nYour client gave consent.\nMS. FROST: No. There are two answers to that,\nJustice Souter. The first is that there are both\nstructural protections and personal protections in the\nconsent requirement. As this Court said in CFTC v. Schor,\nwhen Congress requires consent, or when consent is\nrequired, that serves as a break on the delegation of\nArticle III authority, and that preserves the separation\nof powers required by the Constitution.\nQUESTION: Okay, but if -- if we say, this does\nnot rise to the level of structural problems, which is\nwhat we were getting at --\nMS. FROST: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- earlier when we were saying, well,\nit doesn't rise to the level of personal jurisdiction, so\nif we say, that's not really involved here, then it's\nmerely a personal protection, and I suppose it's a\npersonal protection for the purpose who -- for the person\nwho can give or refuse consent, and as long as your client\nsaid, fine with me to be tried by a magistrate judge, why\nisn't the end of it, that the end of it for you?\nMS. FROST: Because my client never consented to\nwhat happened here, which is that the Attorney General, by\nfailing to consent --\nQUESTION: Well, you're saying my client never\nconsented that they could get by without giving a written\nconsent, but that -- I mean, that, it seems to me, is\nturning the whole premise on its head.\nMS. FROST: I have a slightly different point\nI'm trying to make, Justice Souter, which is --\nQUESTION: Okay. I should let you give your\nanswer, okay.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. FROST: Which is that at the end of this\nproceeding, if the Attorney General's Office had said, oh,\nwe made a -- we didn't mean to consent, we're not filing a\nwritten consent form, and we can't consent here, then\nthere would have been a new trial, and of course they were\nonly going to do that if they lost at trial, so when I\nsaid my client didn't consent, my point was, my client\ndidn't consent to go through a proceeding where his\nadversary had the opportunity to decide at the end of the\ncase whether they --\nQUESTION: But if you're wrong about, that --\nthat the State Attorney General could have done that, and\nif, as the petitioners' counsel said, they would have been\nstuck. They went to trial. It's just like making a\ngeneral appearance. If you're wrong about that, then I\ngather that you would lose, because then you would have,\nif the defendants couldn't get out at the end of it by\nsaying, sorry, we never consented, if they couldn't get\nout, then I think you must lose.\nMS. FROST: I disagree, Your Honor, and here's\nwhy, because the Magistrates Act establishes consent as\none of the vital thresholds to the parties, to the\nmagistrate's exercise of authority, and I do not believe\nthat the provision that you're reading from would apply in\na situation where Congress said, before a magistrate can\ntake over that Article III authority there must be both\ndesignation and consent. I think if -- if the district\ncourt here had not designated this magistrate, that is\nalso an error that could not be overlooked.\nQUESTION: No, but I think you're answering a\ndifferent objection. I said, why isn't your consent\nsufficient so that once you give it, you have no further\nobjection, and you said, the answer is, I didn't consent\nto a trial in which they can sit back and wait and see\nwhat happens and then say, oh, we didn't consent,\nrendering the entire thing a waste of time.\nJustice Ginsburg says, yeah, but if we say, they\ndon't have the right to pull their consent if they sat\nthere and implicitly consented, then you don't have that\nproblem at all, and that would be the end of the argument,\nand I don't think you've answered that.\nMS. FROST: Yes, I agree, and let me answer --\nyou're very right, Justice Souter, and let me answer the\nquestion that I think you both are posing, which is, could\na harmless error standard be applied here? In other\nwords, if it is true that the only right is my client's,\nand --\nQUESTION: Well, that's another question, too,\nbut --\nMS. FROST: Oh, I saw them as related, because\nI -- if I understood your question correctly, what I\nthought you were asking was --\nQUESTION: Your answer was, I consented, so far\nas I was concerned, to be tried. I didn't consent to give\nthem an option to go through an entire trial and then pull\nthe rug out if they didn't like the result. Justice\nGinsburg's suggestion and my suggestion is, if we -- this.\nIf we find that an implicit consent on their part is\nsufficient, they can't pull the rug out, and that would be\nthe end of the issue so far as self protection is\nconcerned, and I don't --\nMS. FROST: I agree.\nQUESTION: I don't see a way around that.\nMS. FROST: Yes, I -- I was -- I agree with Your\nHonor, and that was why I was turning to the question --\nQUESTION:\nanother subject. No, I --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: I'd do it, too. Okay.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. FROST: Well, respectfully, Your Honor, I\nthink this is related, because what I was trying to say is\nthat while I agree with you that once you say, if these\npeople go forward at trial, they're stuck, then there is\nno question about, did my client get a raw deal here,\nbecause everyone's bound, and they would have been bound\nif they had lost, so that is why I am going on to the next\nargument, which is harmless error, and whether or not that\nwould legitimately be something that a court could apply\nin this situation, and this Court has said, in both it's\nmagistrate judge jurisprudence and also in its Article III\njurisprudence --\nQUESTION: May I just interrupt with this\nquestion? If you took Justice Ginsburg's suggestion that\njust participation in the trial is enough to establish the\nconsent, that would mean that the consent need not be\ngiven in advance of the beginning of the proceeding.\nMS. FROST: Yes, and I think that --\nQUESTION: And the statute's rather clear that\nit has to come first, isn't it?\nMS. FROST:\nQUESTION: Well, is -- don't they give the\nconsent, though, when the magistrate judge sits down and\nsays, let's go, and -- and the -- I realize consent is not\nfailure to object. There's a distinction there, but if\nthe party sits there and the trial begins --\nQUESTION: But may I ask, does he even have the\nauthority to say, let's go, before consent has been given?\n(Laughter.)\nMS. FROST: That is my argument, Justice\nStevens, which is that because the statute says upon\nconsent, the consent must come first, and therefore simply\nby --\nQUESTION: No, but the magistrate can say the\nwords, let's go -- I mean, he's got that First Amendment\nright, and if he --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: If the magistrate does say that, and\neverybody sits there, as it were, with a smile on their\nface, I would suppose that that was a consent at that\npoint. I mean, isn't -- couldn't you infer the consent at\nthat point?\nMS. FROST: I agree that consent could be\ninferred at that point, but I would disagree strongly that\nCongress intended inaction to equal consent.\nQUESTION:\nconsent has to be communicated to the clerk.\nMS. FROST: Yes, exactly. I agreed that consent\ncould be inferred from the parties' conduct, but that does\nnot meet the requirement of the statute.\nQUESTION: There's one dysjunction, and you have\nstressed, and I think rightly, that why was Congress doing\nthis? It didn't want parties to be coerced into getting a\nmagistrate instead of an Article III judge, it wanted to\nassure voluntariness, and those two concerns are not\npresent in this case. I mean, nobody is suggesting the\nState Attorney General is being coerced, or didn't do this\nvoluntarily, so the reasons for the provision don't exist,\ndon't match this case.\nMS. FROST: I agree with you, Your Honor, but\nthen the question is, well, did Congress intend for some\ndifferent standard for consent to be applied in different\ncases? The Congress --\nQUESTION: Well, I think we could take notice,\ncouldn't we, that State Attorney Generals might not want\nto antagonize magistrates. They're going to be -- they're\ninstitutional litigants, will appear there all of the\ntime, and they might -- and they might be reluctant to\nwithhold consent, unless they could do it under the\nanonymous basis provided for in the rules.\nMS. FROST:\nKennedy, and that would be another reason to say yes,\nCongress' concerns actually do apply to the State Attorney\nGenerals, but in any case I think that what's relevant\nhere as well is the fact that Congress clearly -- and it\ncouldn't be more clear, both from the use of the word\njurisdiction in the statute, and from the fact that in the\nlegislative history Congress expressed these concerns\nabout voluntariness, that consent must be expressed.\nThe counsel for the petitioners, when she was\narguing, repeatedly referred to the fact that the local\nrules and Rule 73(b) protect the voluntariness concerns.\nThey serve that purpose, and that is our point. That is\nwhat Congress said consent is for, and that is why\nCongress said consent cannot be something that simply is\nimplied as you go along.\nConsent must be something you communicate to the\nclerk. It must be something clear, and that is why eight\ncourts of appeals, we respectfully submit, have already\nreached the conclusion there must be express consent.\nThey've reached the conclusion that without it, the court\nhas no jurisdiction, and both -- and all of these\ndecisions came before amendments to the Magistrates Act in\n1990, in '96.\nIf Congress had an issue with both the consent\nrequirement being read as express consent and with courts\nconcluding they had no jurisdiction without it, then\nCongress could have take action, taken action, and because\nit didn't, I believe that that is a sign that Congress\nmeant what it said in the Magistrates Act.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Frost.\nMs. Eskow, you have 3 minutes left.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LISA R. ESKOW\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMS. ESKOW: Because the statute was designed to\nprotect the voluntariness of the parties, and the local\nrules and the Federal rules also serve that purpose, and\nhere you have no party suggesting that they were coerced\nor involuntarily dragged before a magistrate judge rather\nthan an Article III judge, to reverse in these\ncircumstances, as the Fifth Circuit did, to sua sponte\ninvestigate consent when there is no question, where no\none is claiming to have been involuntarily dragged before\nthe magistrate judge, would be to import some sort of\nautomatic, per se, plain error, subject matter\njurisdictional principle into a context that is not based\non subject matter jurisdiction but, rather, the\nparticularities of a particular officer presiding and, as\nJustice Breyer noted, the de facto officer doctrine exists\nto insulate judgments from attack that have a technical\ndeficiency, for example, not signing a consent form.\nAnd because all parties voluntarily proceeded in\nthis fashion, their consent should not have been\nquestioned after the judgment was entered, and there is no\nbasis to find any sort of harm to any of the parties when\ntheir Article III rights were not violated in any respect,\nand for these reasons we would ask that you reverse the\njudgment of the Fifth Circuit.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Ms. Eskow.\n"
