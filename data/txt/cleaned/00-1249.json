WILSON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. WILSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court,in the unanimous opinion in Freedman\nversus Maryland this court stated that when the government\nimposes a permit requirement on the exercise of free\nspeech, that permit scheme must include certain procedural\nsafeguards which are there, quite obviously, to prevent\nthe unwarranted and perhaps unlawful delay or suppression\nof speech that might occur without them.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, Freedman was a\nquite different case from the present one. You agree with\nthat, don t you? I mean, there you re talking about some\nform of censorship. Here you re talking about a permit to\nuse a park that a lot of other people want to use.\nMR. WILSON: While agree that there s a\ndifference between the two cases,this case begs for more\nprotection than the speech involved in Freedman. Because\nafter all, the Freedman case was specifically -\nspecifically arose from a censorship scheme which was\naimed at sexually explicit speech. This is a case\ninvolving core political speech. And although the -\nQUESTION: Well is this content neutral in your\nview, the regulation?\nMR. WILSON: I believe that the regulation in\nthis case is content neutral. It is rife with the\nopportunity to make viewpoint based decision, but not on\nits face.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: I have to say that\nthinking about the case, I suppose analytically this is a\nprior restraint. And we have said that there s a heavy\npresumption within validity. But on the other hand, it s a\ncontent based time, place and manner regulation, and we\nhave sustained these in case after case, and you want to\nmake this a Freedman case.\nFreedman was a case where you had to submit your\nspeech to prior examination, prior submission of speech,\nand it was in that context, and the Court was very clear,\nas I recall, in Freedman to say when -- there must be\nprior submission of speech, then you have to have the\nprocedures Freedman set forth, so I think you're really\nstretching our precedents, particularly Freedman, to put\nFreedman in your case.\nIt's true you may have some other arguments, if\nthere were some content-based suppression going on, but\nthis isn't a Freedman case. Our authorities just don't\nallow us to make that leap.\nMR. WILSON: Justice Kennedy, with respect, I\ncould not disagree with you more, and I think we can look\nat a few cases to show that this is surely a prior\nrestraint case, and the one that comes to mind most\nreadily is where that exact same question was presented to\nthis Court when, in FW/PBS v. The City of Dallas, the\nFifth Circuit had held that the Dallas licensing scheme,\nwhich was content-neutral, period, in all regards, which a\ncontent-neutral licensing scheme licensing sexually\noriented business in Dallas, was a time, place, and manner\nrestriction, and this Court rejected that approach and\nsaid, first we find that it is an unlawful prior\nrestraint, and therefore it is --\nQUESTION: Well, I think your premise may be one\nthat we're going to have trouble adopting. This is use of\na public park. It is limited in terms of size and space,\nand presumably there may well be competing interests\ntrying to use the park at the very same time, when it\ncan't accommodate every possible use at all times. Now,\nis there no way that the park can attempt to find rules of\nthe game so that everybody gets accommodated?\nMR. WILSON: Justice O'Connor, there's no\nindication in this record or in any situation that I'm\naware of --\nQUESTION: But just answer whether that is\npossible, under First Amendment time, place, and manner\ndoctrine. Yes, it's public space, and yes, it is\npolitical speech, but is it a possible time, place, and\nmanner regulation to say a group of 300 wants to use it\nTuesday, and a second group of 600 wants to use it\nTuesday, we have to sort out who gets it and when? Is\nthat not possible?\nMR. WILSON: Certainly, Justice O'Connor, that's\npossible. What we complain about is when the Government\ncan say, we will decide who gets to use the park,\nparticularly when the scheme is such, when it lacks the\nkind of standards required that the Government can make\nthat choice improperly.\nQUESTION: But aren't you --\nQUESTION: Under the standards there was a list\nof 13, and they seem to be reasonable, fairly clear\nstandards, and you are coming to us with a facial\nchallenge, and are we to project that those standards will\nnot work properly? You're not coming to us with any\nconcrete case.\nMR. WILSON: Justice Ginsburg, the record in\nthis instance is a solid, concrete case. Mr. McDonald was\ndenied his right to core political speech using those\nstandards.\nQUESTION: And then he was granted it, as I\nunderstand it.\nMR. WILSON: Mr. McDonald never received a\npermit. From the time he filed this application for\npermit --\nQUESTION: He did conduct his expression.\nMR. WILSON: He was allowed to conduct a\nspontaneous rally on a very limited basis. No sound\nsystem was allowed. No vendors were allowed, no stage, no\nstructures.\nQUESTION: What about, in the list that we have\nare functions that were being held at the park. One of\nthe permitted events was -- it may not have been\nMr. McDonald. He may not have been with us any more, but\nit was for the same organization, was it not?\nMR. WILSON: One of the events in the lodging\nmaterial?\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. WILSON: Yes, that is true. Those have not\nbeen obtained without great difficulty, however. Indeed,\nthe brief of the Chicago Park District indicates that the\npermit for the event for this fall was granted. The park\ndistrict filed that brief before the organization was\nnotified that somehow the park district had lost that\napplication and the permit therefore was not valid, and\nthey'd have to go some place else.\nQUESTION: In any --\nQUESTION: Well, still the point remains that I\njust think you overstate the case when you tell us this is\na Freedman case. Justice O'Connor gave you the simplest\ntime, place, and manner regulation that's content-neutral,\nif there are two groups that want a use a space that hold\n100 and they're each 100, do you have to sort out the two.\nThat is not a Freedman case. Sure, I suppose if you push\nus to the wall it's a prior restraint. Of course there\nare cases that say that prior restraints have a heavy\nburden.\nBut we have sustained in countless cases\ncontent-neutral time, place, and manner regulations for\nthe use of parks and those are not Freedman cases, period,\nas I read the cases. Now --\nMR. WILSON: Justice Kennedy, I think clearly\nit's a prior restraint. I mean, there are two --\nQUESTION: Well, I happen to disagree with\nJustice Kennedy's suggestion. I think you just have to\nstrain all over the case to find that this is a prior\nrestraint. It's public property, and you're just standing\nin line with a bunch of other people to get the use of it.\nMR. WILSON: Mr. Chief Justice, from Neer v.\nMinnesota forward, the Court has said that when speech is\nprohibited in advance, that is a prior restraint.\nQUESTION: Okay, but Neer was the shutting down\nof a, padlocking of a newspaper --\nMR. WILSON: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: -- of a private -- the shoe is on the\nother foot here. Nobody is telling your client he can't\nrun a printing press in a private place. What -- your\nclient is coming and saying, we want to use this public\npark that a lot of other people want to use, and to say\nthat you're going to have to get in line and obey some\nrules, it doesn't come close to being a prior restraint.\nMR. WILSON: My problem with that, Mr. Chief\nJustice, is not that you have to get in line with other\npeople and share the use of the park, which was Justice\nO'Connor's concern when she posed the time, place, and\nmanner question.\nMy complaint is that the way this scheme is set\nup, it allows the park district to choose which people in\nthat line can come forward and get their pass to speak,\nand which people in that line --\nQUESTION: Do you think the language of, may\ngrant, is something that allows too much discretion? Is\nthat your complaint?\nMR. WILSON: It is one of our complaints, and\neven that --\nQUESTION: Or do we read may as shall grant, if\nthese conditions are met?\nMR. WILSON: Well, it says --\nQUESTION: I don't know what it means.\nMR. WILSON: It says may deny, is what it says.\nQUESTION: It says may deny, but maybe it\nmean -- means that the permit must be granted if the\ncategories are met.\nMR. WILSON: But that's not what it says,\nJustice O'Connor. Indeed, the Seventh Circuit recognized\nthat the use of the word, may in this scheme creates the\npotential --\nQUESTION: You agree it must be granted if\nconditions are met. You just say, it need not be denied\nif the conditions are not met. That's your complaint,\nisn't it?\nMR. WILSON: Correct.\nQUESTION: You agree that if the conditions are\nmet, your client meets all the conditions, he gets in.\nMR. WILSON: I agree with that, Justice Scalia.\nWhat I --\nQUESTION: Okay. You're saying if your client\ndoesn't meet some of the conditions, he may not be allowed\nin, whereas somebody that the park district likes more\nwill be allowed in.\nMR. WILSON: Yes, Justice.\nQUESTION: That same thing was true, wasn't it,\nin Poulos? I mean, the language in Poulos was even more\nprotean than the language in the may phrase.\nMR. WILSON: I think Poulos would have been\ndecided differently by this Court had the --\nQUESTION: So we've got to overrule it to hold\nyour way.\nMR. WILSON: Yes. Had the -- had your court,\nthe supreme court of New Hampshire, not construed that\nstatute in such a limiting way to say that if you apply\nfor a permit under Poulos and under Cox you get the\npermit, there was no discretion to deny, and in the\nopinion that this Court wrote in Poulos, it pointed that\nout, that that cured the problem in that case, and I think\nrealistically this Court has recognized the --\nQUESTION: But wasn't the discretion left the\nsame discretion, in effect, to evaluate facts, and to act\nbased upon that evaluation which the Chicago scheme\nallowed Chicago?\nMR. WILSON: My understanding of that case is\nthat after the construction the New Hampshire court placed\non it, that became part and parcel of the statute, and\neven though the statute retained the discretion, it had\nauthoritatively been limited by the New Hampshire supreme\ncourt, so the discretion was gone by judicial act and not\nby legislative change.\nQUESTION: The discretion was gone to deny\nsomebody who met the conditions?\nMR. WILSON: Yes, sir.\nQUESTION: But there -- was there no discretion\nto grant someone who did not meet the conditions? Did the\nNew Hampshire supreme court speak to that?\nMR. WILSON: Well, the interesting --\nQUESTION: It's the latter that you're\ncomplaining about, not the former.\nMR. WILSON: It is the latter. By the way,\nJustice Scalia, there's another aspect of your inquiry,\nand we both agree, obviously, that if you meet the\nqualifications, you're entitled to the permit. It goes no\nfurther. In this case, however, it is very difficult, if\nnot impossible, to show that you meet the qualifications\nbecause of the behind-closed-doors way that this permit\nscheme is imposed and implemented, and this case presents\nthe perfect example.\nAs the Court knows from the record in this case,\nMr. McDonald vehemently and categorically denied that he\nhad done those things which under the code would deny him\na permit, but that made no difference. Not only did the\npark district say that as far as we are concerned you did\nit, and you are not entitled to speak, that prevents you,\nin our opinion, from ever speaking in a park for the rest\nof your life, and anyone associated with you.\nQUESTION: But that didn't happen, and you\nsay -- you give us this one instance. You don't have a\nrecord of uneven applications, and beyond that, I would\nreally like to know what is your idea of a scheme that\nwould be compatible with the First Amendment.\nIn answer to Justice O'Connor you said yes, they\ncan have rules of the road, so there aren't too many\npeople at any time, that there aren't colliding events.\nWhat scheme do you say is necessary to meet the First\nAmendment?\nMR. WILSON: First, in direct answer to Justice\nO'Connor's inquiry, a scheme that says you may not obtain\na permit for an event at a day and time for which another\npermit has already been issued, no question. There's no\ncomplaint that anyone could have.\nQUESTION: Well, of course, that assumes that\nyou have a permit scheme, so it doesn't work.\nMR. WILSON: I'm sorry, Justice Kennedy.\nQUESTION: That assumes that you can have a\npermit scheme.\nMR. WILSON: Surely you can have a permit\nscheme. I think this Court has made it very clear you can\nhave a --\nQUESTION: Well, that's what we're asking, what\nthe requisites are for the permit scheme.\nMR. WILSON: The question may well be, when can\nyou lawfully deny a permit for free speech under this --\nunder a permit scheme in what is the traditional public\nforum, a public park, and what is the most precious of\nspeech, core political speech.\nQUESTION: Well, you're saying the most precious\nspeech. Are you suggesting that if, say, somebody wanted\nto have a softball game in the park and they applied, and\nyour client wanted to have a speech in the park, and he\napplied, that your client should be given some sort of a\npreference over the softball game because it's free\nspeech, or --\nMR. WILSON: No.\nQUESTION: -- core speech?\nMR. WILSON: No, Mr. Chief Justice. I am saying\nthat if that softball game had a permit, the free speech\nevent would have to take place at another day, at another\ntime, or at another location.\nQUESTION: But they're both before the board. I\nmean, you say, first come, first serve, is that it, there\nhas to be that rule, too, if --\nMR. WILSON: It would seem --\nQUESTION: You're positing a situation in which\nsomebody has already been granted a permit for the time.\nWhat if -- what about the situation where you have several\npeople who want to get in for a time that has not yet been\ncommitted to anybody.\nMR. WILSON: A first come, first serve rule\nwould certainly help the situation and, of course, these\npermit applications are dated, time-dated and time-stamped\nwhen they are submitted, but there is no requirement that\nit be first come, first served.\nQUESTION: Okay. What if they collide on their\nway in to file the permit.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: What's your rule then? Does\npolitical speech always win? Is that the tie-breaker?\nMR. WILSON: Well, obviously it's a very\ndifficult question on facts which might never, ever occur,\nand I'm not claiming that when the park district is making\na decision on whether to issue a permit, or space A on day\nA, it has to look at these permits and say, oops,\npolitical speech, first in line, and that's --\nQUESTION: If it doesn't say that, doesn't it\nretain exactly the discretion that you're complaining\nabout?\nMR. WILSON: No, sir. If it said first come,\nfirst serve according to the time date and time stamp,\nthat would solve the problem. Your hypothetical\nassumes --\nQUESTION: Okay, we've got the collision at the\ndoor. If the tie-breaker rule is political speech always\nwins, your problem doesn't arise. If there isn't that\ntie-breaker rule, it seems to me, there is enough\ndiscretion left to be a violation on your view.\nMR. WILSON: Well, I would certainly think that\nthis case need not turn on that somewhat unlikely\noccurrence.\nQUESTION: Well, maybe, but I'd like to know\nwhat the principle is that you want us to apply, and I\nthink the principle that you want us to apply means that\nwhen they bump each other's foreheads at the door,\npolitical speech has got to win, or there's an\nunconstitutional discretion left, amounting to the\npossibility of a prior restraint.\nIf that's wrong, tell me why it's wrong.\nMR. WILSON: I believe that's wrong because --\nwell, first of all, again, we're not going to find that\nsituation, but let's assume we did, and they bump their\nheads on the way in. First come, first served is a\nreasonable approach, if that is a concrete and\nconsistently --\nQUESTION: Yes, but you just keep changing the\nhypothetical. What's the principle in the case that the\ntime rule, first come, first served, doesn't work? What's\nthe principle?\nMR. WILSON: When first come, first served does\nnot work?\nQUESTION: Yes, the hypo.\nMR. WILSON: It would seem that as long as the\nevent is suitable for that particular park, first come,\nfirst serve should always work.\nQUESTION: But by hypothesis, Justice Souter's\nquestion is you can't apply it here because they both came\nat the same time.\nMR. WILSON: Well --\nQUESTION: You don't have an answer for that,\nright? You don't have an answer for that situation.\nMR. WILSON: I don't.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. WILSON: I really don't, and --\nQUESTION: But you think first come, first serve\nis a thoroughly reasonable rule.\nMR. WILSON: I do.\nQUESTION: But you're going to tell us that --\nQUESTION: When --\nQUESTION: Your brief tell us that --\nQUESTION: Excuse me, please let me finish.\nWhen Pope Paul visited -- John Paul visited\nChicago there was a rally, or a gathering in the Chicago\nparks. If your client had filed for that day 2 years\nearlier, right, the park would have to say, gee, I'm\nsorry. The park couldn't have a 30-day before rule, we're\nnot going to grant any applications until 30 days before\nthe event, and we're going to look over all of the\nfeasible applications at that point. That would not be\nreasonable?\nMR. WILSON: Justice Scalia --\nQUESTION: So that it finds, gee, you know, the\nPope is only going to be here one day, and you know, maybe\nwe can have this --\nQUESTION: Hemp concert --\nQUESTION: -- Hemp concert later, yes.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. WILSON: One would assume that the --\nQUESTION: Can't do that?\nMR. WILSON: -- holder of the permit would be\nreasonable in accommodating such as an extraordinary event\nas this, and if --\nQUESTION: No, no, this is an unreasonable --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. WILSON: I've met them.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: The park district always has the\navailability of going to court to seek a court order in\nthat unusual situation to demonstrate to a court that this\nis such an extraordinary event that they should be able to\nwithdraw that permit and make reasonable accommodation to\nthe other events, and it's -- like Justice Souter's\nhypothetical, it conceivably could happen. It's not going\nto happen very often. It may never happen.\nQUESTION: It's not Pope John Paul, it's the\nBeatles, and the Beatles are only going to be there for\none day. I mean, you're going to have courts decide\nwhether the Beatles are more important than your Hemp\nconcert?\nMR. WILSON: No, sir, and that's why I believe\nthat a first come, first serve rule is going to be\nreasonable in almost all situations.\nQUESTION: All right, but just --\nQUESTION: It seems to me the problem with\nthat --\nQUESTION: Just testing your brief, you say that\neven under the first come, first serve rule the Government\nhas the obligation to go to court to validate the permit,\nunder Freedman, and I just don't get that out of our --\nsure, that's what Freedman said, but Freedman was a very\nspecial case, and a time, place, and manner regulation for\na park is not.\nMR. WILSON: Well, of course, Freedman has -- I\nmean, the analysis from Freedman has been used in\nnoncensorship cases, but in that case the Government needs\nto bear that burden. It's a very slight burden. It's\na --\nQUESTION: Mr. Wilson, where -- where? You say,\nthe Government goes to court. The park district goes to\ncourt and shows that there's no conflict with the First\nAmendment. The court you're assuming, I gather, if you're\nfollowing the Freedman mode, is a State court, and yet\nfrom this very litigation it seems that you prefer the\nFederal court, so how would a Freedman scheme do you any\ngood at all, considering that your preferred forum is the\nFederal court, and I don't think, if the Government\nbrought that case, if the park district brought that case\nin the State court, wouldn't you be stuck there?\nMR. WILSON: No question, of course, the\nSupremacy Clause makes Freedman applicable to that State\ncourt, but the likelihood that an individual is going to\ninsist on going forward with judicial review when his\npermit was denied because another permit had already been\nissued is slight.\nQUESTION: No, but I'm asking you -- I asked you\nbefore, what is the scheme that you said would be\nconstitutional, and one part of it surprised me. You said\nFreedman. You go to the State court. But it seems to me\nyou don't want to be in State court. You were brought\nhere a 1983 action. You could have gone to State court\nwith a 1983 action, but you didn't.\nMR. WILSON: The problem with that, we have\nbrought a facial challenge in this case because of the\ndifficulty, every single time one is refused a permit, in\ngoing to State court or Federal court and litigating\nwhether that particular denial was appropriate, and the\nmedicine here is to get rid of the bad ordinance which\nallows inappropriate and content-based, or viewpoint-\nbased decisions behind closed doors, even if they are not\nauthorized on the face of the scheme.\nIt's a burden that the Government ought to bear\nin core political speech cases, and it is not a great\nburden. It would be a form complaint, spit out of the\nword processor, to say the permit was denied, here is a\ncopy of the previously issued permit, we rest.\nQUESTION: Do you know any park district that\ndoes it that way?\nMR. WILSON: Well, some have to now. For\ninstance, in California, it's not a park district, but in\nresponse to the decision of the Ninth Circuit in Baby Tam,\nthe California legislature enacted Chapter 49 of the\nCalifornia statutes, which mandates that when a permit is\ndenied for a First Amendment business, which the Baby Tam\ncase involved, it is the Government who must bear the\nburden, and the time limits are very stringent. The --\nQUESTION: We're talking about a business, a\npermit to operate a business, not to hold an event in a\npublic park.\nMR. WILSON: Well, I would suggest, Justice\nGinsburg, that a permit to hold a core political speech\nrally in a public park deserves at least as much\nprotection as the permit to operate an adult bookstore.\nQUESTION: Well, you're arguing for content-\nneutral --\nQUESTION: You're simply wrong under our cases\nthere.\nMR. WILSON: I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice.\nQUESTION: I say, I think you're wrong under our\ncases there. The Government has a right to make\nsubstantial choice in determining who's going to use its\npremises, whereas the owner of private premises is\nentitled to use them as he pleases, subject only to the\npermit process.\nMR. WILSON: But this Court has said that in\ncases of public parks, the power of the Government to\nrestrict free speech activity is at its most\ncircumscribed.\nQUESTION: And where did we say that?\nMR. WILSON: We said that in Hague v. -- you\nsaid that in Hague v. CIO.\nQUESTION: Well, that was 60 years ago.\nMR. WILSON: But no one has ever suggested, Mr.\nChief Justice, that that is not the law today, and indeed,\nthat one quotation from Hague appears in core political\nspeeches through this day, and it is one of the most oft-\nrepeated statements from the cases.\nQUESTION: Yes. That doesn't make it valid\ntoday.\nQUESTION: But isn't your argument for applying\nit this. Your argument seems to boil down to saying, a\ncontent-neutral set of criteria can be abused, and isn't\nthe answer to that an applied challenge as opposed to a\nfacial challenge?\nMR. WILSON: No, it is not, Justice Souter. My\nanswer to that is, make the Government come into court and\ndemonstrate to a reviewing court that it was not abused,\nthat it was an appropriate denial of speech, and that's\nwhere the burden belongs.\nQUESTION: That's why the -- there's no need to\nretreat from Hague, I wouldn't think. It is important,\nbut the question is what set of rules are appropriate to\nsafeguard the interests of the many people who might want\nto use the park for different purposes, so why don't you\ngo back to Justice Souter's question and say, well, why\nisn't it -- answer, why isn't it perfectly appropriate to\nhave a set of neutral criteria, that is a fair set of\ncriteria, and if they are a disguised way of censoring\nsomeone, simply leave that up to the as-applied\ncircumstance where the person who is being censored will\ngo into court and say, judge, this is a trick, they're\nafter me, and the judge will decide?\nMR. WILSON: Justice Breyer, in order to do that\nit would seem that this Court would have to retreat from\nwhat it said in Forsyth, in which it stated that when a\nprior restraint in the form of a permit to conduct a\npolitical event in a public forum is involved, a facial\nchallenge is appropriate, and the court --\nQUESTION: Nobody says -- nobody denies you can\nmake the challenge. I just want to know why you don't\nlose on the ground that it's a fair set of criteria, and\nif, in fact, they're not applying that set of criteria\nfairly, sufficient unto the day.\nIt's the same question, but I think that that's\ninitially what I got from Justice Souter, and I just want\nto know directly your answer.\nMR. WILSON: My answer is that this a particular\nsituation where facial challenges are appropriate. This\nis not a case where the individual need to go to court and\ndemonstrate that in this particular instance his permit\nwas wrongly denied. It is the very existence of this\nscheme, as the Court said in Lakewood, that creates a\ndanger that it was wrongly denied, and because that danger\nis there, the permit scheme cannot be allowed to stand --\nQUESTION: May I just ask one question about\nyour rule about priorities, and it's the basic rule. I\nassume they might have a cut-off, say we won't consider\napplications more than 90 days ahead of time, or something\nlike that, but do you say it is totally impermissible for\nthe park district to use content of what is going to be\ndone in the use of the park as one of the criteria for\ndeciding who gets the -- on competing demands?\nMR. WILSON: Content of the speech.\nQUESTION: One is a baseball game, another is a\nconcert, another is a lecture on dinosaurs, and another is\npolitical speech. Is it totally impermissible to decide\nthat one of those uses is more appropriate on a particular\ntime and place within the park?\nMR. WILSON: If there are competing applications\nand one of them is a free speech event and one of them is\na softball game, and the decision is made based on what\nthe free speech is urging, what the message is, that is\nentirely inappropriate.\nQUESTION: If it's hostility to the message, I\nagree completely.\nMR. WILSON: Yes, sir.\nQUESTION: But just supposing all you know about\nit is, they want to make -- it's a political rally of some\nkind on the one hand, baseball, music, all those -- can\nthe content, without any hostility to the particular\nmessage, be one of the criteria that can break ties?\nMR. WILSON: If your question assumes that each\nof those events would be appropriate for that specific\nlocation --\nQUESTION: It does.\nMR. WILSON: -- then no. The first applied\nshould get the space.\nI'd like to reserve the remainder of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Wilson. Mr. Strauss,\nwe'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. STRAUSS\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. STRAUSS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nFirst, if I may, I would like to clarify\nsomething about the park district's regulations. The park\ndistrict does use a first come, first serve rule. It\noccurs in at least two places in the regulations in joint\nappendix 143 and joint appendix 146.\nJoint appendix 143 prescribes the order in which\napplications shall be processed. They shall be processed\nin the order of receipt. 146 criterion number 6 for\ndenial, one ground for denial -- this is -- I'm reading\nfrom joint appendix page 146. One ground for denial is\nthat a fully executed prior application for permit for the\nsame time and place has been received, and a permit has\nbeen --\nQUESTION: But neither of those requires the\nearly application to be accepted, at least not as I read\nit.\nMR. STRAUSS: Well, first come, first serve if\nthe application is valid, yes.\nQUESTION: It is required to be accepted? Which\none of those says that.\nMR. STRAUSS: Well, the -- a valid, a fully\nexecuted prior application for a permit has been received,\nand a permit has been granted --\nQUESTION: That's a reason for denial.\nMR. STRAUSS: That's a reason for denial, right.\nQUESTION: But it doesn't say the converse, that\nit must be accepted if it's earlier.\nMR. STRAUSS: Well, the -- a -- the only ground\nfor denial -- there are other grounds, possible grounds\nfor denial, but one ground for denial is someone was there\nfirst.\nQUESTION: Well, it works out that way because\nof the provision that says applications shall be processed\nin --\nMR. STRAUSS: In the order of receipt.\nQUESTION: That doesn't require a decision on\nthe processing. I don't see -- I really don't see it, and\nI'm not sure it's commanded, either, but --\nMR. STRAUSS: I guess --\nQUESTION: Let me ask you this. Do you think\nthat that's constitutionally required there be a first\ncome, first serve rule?\nMR. STRAUSS: Well, it is our system, Justice\nStevens. I -- so really this would be a question that\nwouldn't be implicated in our defense of our system.\nI guess I think no, it is not constitutionally\nrequired to proceed on a first come, first serve basis.\nThere could be other legitimate criteria that might be\nused, but I do want to emphasize that is what we do.\nQUESTION: Can you ask for the park 3 years in\nadvance?\nMR. STRAUSS: My understanding, Justice Scalia,\nis that we have a practice, although I don't know if it's\nwritten down anywhere, of not accepting applications for\nmore than some period of time in advance, I think 6\nmonths.\nQUESTION: I would think there would have to be\nsomething --\nMR. STRAUSS: There's some provision --\nQUESTION: Now, the whole scheme is written on\nthe basis that the permit may be denied, and there are a\nset of criteria, but it doesn't appear to be any\naffirmative requirement that anything be granted if it\nmeets all the requirements.\nMR. STRAUSS: Oh, Justice O'Connor, we do have\nto grant it if it meets those requirements. That language\nthat the park district --\nQUESTION: May deny.\nMR. STRAUSS: -- may deny is an authorization to\nthe park district to deny in these circumstances.\nQUESTION: And not otherwise.\nMR. STRAUSS: And not otherwise. And not\notherwise.\nQUESTION: And it doesn't do anything to govern\nhow you grant competing applications, other than the fact\nthat you say there's some kind of built-in first come,\nfirst serve basis.\nMR. STRAUSS: The way the competing applications\nare handled is on a first come, first serve basis.\nQUESTION: One of the objections made by the\npetitioner was that either in this case or, reading the\nregulations, you don't have to give written reasons. He\nsaid that there was no record and so forth. It seemed to\nme that was -- I'd like you to respond to that.\nMR. STRAUSS: Justice Kennedy, we do provide\nreasons.\nQUESTION: That was my -- and you did in this\ncase?\nMR. STRAUSS: Yes, we did, in this case. That\nis in the record. The exchange of letters between\npetitioner's predecessor, Mr. McDonald, and the park\ndistrict is in the joint appendix, and --\nQUESTION: This is based on previous damage and\nmaterial misrepresentations in the earlier --\nMR. STRAUSS: That's right. It was based on\nprevious violations and, in fact, in this case we gave\nMr. McDonald notice that he had engaged in conduct in\nviolation of his permit when he did it, before he\nsubmitted the subsequent application.\nQUESTION: And do the regulations require that\nyou give the reasons?\nMR. STRAUSS: Yes, they do. I'm reading now on\njoint appendix page 145. The section is misnumbered. It's\ncorrectly numbered in the appendix to our brief, but the\nsubstance is the same. Notice of denial and application\nfor a permit shall clearly set forth the grounds upon\nwhich the permit was denied.\nQUESTION: Thank you.\nMR. STRAUSS: It then goes on to say that where\nfeasible, if there is a competing use the park district\nwill propose a way to accommodate the use. That's a\nrequirement on us, to try to provide an alternative site\nor alternative date to --\nQUESTION: Could you explain the degree of\ndiscretion to grant, in the event that the conditions are\nnot satisfied?\nMR. STRAUSS: Yes, Justice Souter. Our view,\nwhich we think is really the only reasonable reading of\nthe ordinance, is that we can exercise discretion, as it\nwere, within the criteria, so that if there is a way to\ngrant the application that -- an application that is in\nviolation that does not defeat the purpose of the\nconditions, we will try to do that.\nLet me be more concrete about it. The place\nwhere this comes up most frequently is with a late\napplication, and --\nQUESTION: Late?\nMR. STRAUSS: A late -- late application,\napplication that's not submitted. We have a schedule of\ndeadlines which are very specific. Often, they're not\nmet. In fact, they're habitually not met by, in Justice\nBlack's terms from Oregon v. City of Struthers, the poorly\nfinanced causes of little people. Those are the people\nwho often get their applications in late, and the park\ndistrict's view is, if it's -- if we can make the\nnecessary accommodations, and do the necessary setup and\nnecessary coordination and free the space for you, even\nthough your application is late, we will do it, and that's\nthe kind of discretion we exercise.\nQUESTION: Would there have been discretion in\nthis case? Let's assume the only prior violation had been\nthe fact that if that earlier gathering people were still\nhanging around at 11:00, after -- or after 11:00 when the\npark closed. Would there have been discretion to forgive\nthat?\nMR. STRAUSS: Yes, there would have been, if we\nhad concluded that -- if the applicant said to us\nsomething that gave us reason to believe it wouldn't\nhappen again, or if the nature of the event were such that\nit was scheduled earlier in the day, or something like\nthat, that it wouldn't happen again, or if it happened\nagain it wouldn't be so much of a problem, but we don't\nassert, and I don't think you can assert, consistent with\nthe ordinance, a kind of free-floating discretion to\noverlook violations for people we like and not for people\nwe don't like. I think that would be a violation of the\nordinance.\nQUESTION: Does the record tell us how many\npermits are granted and how many denied each year by the\npark?\nMR. STRAUSS: Justice O'Connor, on the grants,\nthe record, the most precise number we have in the record\nis there are thousands of applications and thousands of\ngrants a year. We submitted to the Court the permits in\nour lodging, the permits granted from January through\nAugust of this year, and there were over 1,000 of those in\none region of the park.\nQUESTION: How about denials?\nMR. STRAUSS: Denials, Justice O'Connor, is a\nhard number to come up with, and this bears on the\nFreedman v. Maryland point, because what often happens is\nthat the denial takes the form of saying, we can't\naccommodate you at this space at this time, but if you're\nwilling to move your event a week later, or willing to\nmove it to this alternative site, then we can accommodate\nyou.\nNow, I suppose that's a denial, because we're\nnot granting the permit applied for, and I suppose if\npetitioner prevails we would have to go to court and\ndefend that denial, which seems a really unworkable\nscheme, but because of that the park district really\ncan't -- couldn't tell me how many denials there are,\nbecause so many of them are worked out and the event goes\nforward in a different time or place than that which was\napplied for.\nI think there are really three ways in which\nthis case differs from Freedman v. Maryland. One which\nwas suggested by some questions from the Court, perhaps\nthe most important one, of course, is in Freedman the\nBoard of Censors, self-described Board of Censors was\nexplicitly concerned with the content of speech.\nWe are not only not concerned with the content\nof speech, we are not concerned with whether the event\ninvolves speech or expressive activity at all, and if you\nlook at the application form, unless the applicant somehow\ndiscloses it, there is really no way for us to know from\nthe application form what kind, whether this is a speech-\nrelated event or not. The box that Mr. McDonald checked\nwas named corporate/festival, which could include a\nvariety of events not involving speech.\nQUESTION: I guess a permit was denied to\nMr. McDonald based on some prior event where people stayed\nafter 11:00.\nMR. STRAUSS: Justice O'Connor, it was denied\nfor multiple reasons. It was denied partly because it\nwasn't filled out properly. The form omitted information,\npartly because one of the applicants was not an\norganization that had the capacity to sue or be sued, and\nalso because of a series of violations of which that was\nonly one. There was also --\nQUESTION: Are there administrative mechanisms\nin place for someone who wants to challenge the basis for\nthe denial to raise it administratively?\nMR. STRAUSS: Yes, there is, Justice O'Connor.\nThere's a provision for an appeal to the general\nsuperintendent of the park district from the decision made\nby the permitting officers in the park district, and you\ncan submit any material you like to the general\nsuperintendent, who must rule on it promptly. If he\ndoesn't rule on it promptly, then the appeal is deemed\nallowed.\nQUESTION: I take it that's the second\ndistinction from Freedman.\nMR. STRAUSS: Well, the second distinction from\nFreedman -- that is a distinction, Justice Souter, but the\nsecond distinction really is that a key premise of\nFreedman is that the decision in question was one that the\ncourts had superior competence to make, and that the\nagency was to be distrusted in making. The Court said the\ndecision was whether the speech was constitutionally\nprotected or is obscene, and a theme of Freedman is, as\nthe Court said in Freedman, a censor's business is to\ncensor, and this is really something that requires, in the\nCourt's words, judicial participation.\nWhat we're dealing with here is the management\nof parks, where I think the story is reversed, and when\nyou're dealing with whether a particular use is\nappropriate for this area of the park with this\ninfrastructure, this is the kind of park district has\nsuperior competence with, and there's really no reason to\ninsist, as the Court did on judicial --\nQUESTION: Does the same problem get injected by\nthe exception clause in the ordinance, that in fact they\ncan waive conditions if there would be a First Amendment\nviolation?\nMR. STRAUSS: Justice Souter, that clause, two\nthings about that clause are salient, I think. First,\nthat clause only comes into play, the clause that provides\nthat we shall waive certain fees when someone is engaged\nin First Amendment activity and otherwise couldn't hold\nthe event if we didn't waive the fees, that only comes\ninto play if someone applies for a waiver, so we're in a\nsituation where someone has come to us in order to seek\nthis dispensation, has told us we're engaging in\nexpressive activity, and the second thing --\nQUESTION: Which happened here.\nMR. STRAUSS: Which happened here. In one\ninstance he got his dispensation.\nThe other thing is, we feel we have to have that\nin there because of suggestions in this Court's opinions\nin Murdock and Forsyth County that there might be a\nconstitutional issue if we charge more than a nominal fee.\nQUESTION: And the third distinction that you\nwant to rely on?\nMR. STRAUSS: The third distinction, Justice\nSouter, is that in the Freedman context the Court had\nindicated a strong preference for after-the-fact\nregulation, that if the -- if a community is concerned\nabout obscenity, the way to regulate that is by after-\nthe-fact criminal prohibitions.\nPrior restraints are strongly disfavored and be\nallowed only in narrowly hedged circumstances, but the\nCourt has never suggested that when it comes to managing\nparks, the preferred way to do it is somehow by allowing\npeople to do what they will and then punish people after\nthe fact who have done the wrong thing, who have conducted\nan event in a way that conflicted with another event.\nQUESTION: Mr. Strauss, you've ably\ndistinguished Freedman, but do you think that none of the\nprocedural safeguards that were involved in Freedman are\napplicable here, starting with the basics, the\nadministrator has to have some time limits to act on these\npetitions to hold events?\nMR. STRAUSS: Justice Ginsburg, I would put that\npart of Freedman in a different category. I think that\nthe requirement that the administrator act within a\nspecified period is a corollary of the rule that the\nadministrator cannot have unlimited discretion over\nwhether to grant or deny. Just as unlimited discretion\nover whether to grant is a problem, unlimited discretion\nover when to grant is a problem.\nQUESTION: I think there's considerable merit,\nwhat you have just said, although at the end of the brief\nyou make the final argument that this is really not a\nspeech statute anyway. Am I to infer from that that you\nthink we could write an opinion to say that neutral\nstandards are not necessary?\nMR. STRAUSS: Yes. That was going to be the\nsecond part of my answer to Justice Ginsburg, Justice\nKennedy. That is our position. Our claim does not hinge\non that. The Court could disagree with us on that and\nstill rule in our favor in this case, but it is our\nposition that because this statute applies, this ordinance\napplies so broadly to such a wide range of conduct, much\nof which, most of which is not expressive, that it really\nshould be viewed as more like a business license, or a\nbuilding permit, which, of course --\nQUESTION: Or a zoning ordinance.\nMR. STRAUSS: Or a zoning permit, variance of\nsome kind, which, of course, apply to expressive\nactivities, but to a lot of other activities, too.\nQUESTION: The easy way to answer that argument\nis to say we've never done this with reference to parks.\nMR. STRAUSS: Well, that's right, Justice\nKennedy, but as some of the questions from the Court\nsuggested during my colleague's argument, because these\nare parks, perhaps the Government has more leeway than it\nwould have in telling people what they can do on their own\nproperty.\nI understand that on the other hand they are\npublic forums, and I am not sure how that -- whether those\narguments cancel out, but it seems to me the crucial fact\nhere is that the park district is not only not engaged in\nthe business of censoring speech, it is at the far extreme\nfrom that, and it is regulating conduct because it affects\nthe infrastructure of the parks, and uses of the parks,\nand much of this conduct is in no obvious way expressive,\nand in our view that seems to make it more like a business\nlicense.\nQUESTION: But you did say that you feel some\ncompulsion from the First Amendment to have to make a\ndecision within a set time to guard against abuse of\ndiscretion. You said that. How about, need there be any\navenue for judicial review after we get through with your\npark administrator?\nMR. STRAUSS: Justice Ginsburg, I think -- well,\nfor anyone claiming a violation of a constitutional right,\nthere should be an avenue for prompt judicial review, and\nfurther, I think that part of Freedman is intended to deal\nwith that situation like that present in some of this\nCourt's cases, in FW/PBS and in Shuttlesworth in\nparticular, a situation where the applicant can't be quite\nsure when the permit's been denied, so the applicant\ndoesn't quite know when it's okay to go to court.\nThat was what happened in Shuttlesworth, and I\nthink that troubled the Court, and I think that's the idea\nthat when the Court said in FW/PBS there must be an avenue\nfor prompt judicial review, that's what the Court had in\nmind, that the permitting scheme cannot be set up in such\na way that whenever -- when the applicant goes to Court\nthe permitting authority can then step back and say, oh,\nwe haven't denied the permit yet.\nHere, it's clear when we deny it. We have to\nact within a certain number of days. We have to issue a\nstatement. The statement has to give reasons, and there\nis -- and at that point the decision can be challenged in\nState court in a variety of ways. It can also be\nchallenged --\nQUESTION: I suppose the very fact that you have\nthose provisions in means it's a little different from the\nordinary zoning ordinance or business license, because\nthose are all motivated by First Amendment concerns, I\nassume.\nMay I ask you, how would you -- I understand\nyour basic position, but are you saying that this is not a\nprior restraint, or that it's a permissible prior\nrestraint?\nMR. STRAUSS: Well, Justice --\nQUESTION: Or are you just ducking the issue?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. STRAUSS: No, Justice Stevens, I don't -- I\nwouldn't want to duck the issue. I'd want to say it was a\nterminological issue, which I guess is different from\nducking it.\nI think it's misleading to characterize it as a\nprior restraint. As Justice Kennedy said, there were some\ntechnical definitional way in which yes, it is a prior\nrestraint, but it really has none of the characteristics\nthat have caused the Court to subject prior restraints to\nthe presumption of unconstitutionality.\nIn particular, as I said to Justice Souter, this\nisn't an area in which the Court has said the preferred\nway of regulating is by after-the-fact criminal\npunishments. The Court has always recognized that what\ncommon sense tells us, that this an area where you really\ndo need before-the-fact guidance, or at least before-the-\nfact guidance is acceptable.\nThat, combined with the fact that it's not a\ncontent-based -- not only not a content-based scheme, not\na content-based scheme that even refers to expression at\nall, I think gives it none of the characteristics that\nhave troubled the Court about prior restraints, so in\nlight of that, whether it is technically called not a\nprior restraint, or a valid prior restraint, I think\nreally is a terminological point.\nQUESTION: So if something like this is to be\nconsidered valid, what are the limits to make it\nreasonable as a regulation? We've already mentioned\nprompt action should be required, perhaps, by the park.\nDo you agree with that?\nMR. STRAUSS: If the Court does not accept our\nargument that this is more like a business license, then\nyes, prompt action or a specified time for action by the\nadministrator.\nQUESTION: And prompt judicial review\nopportunity.\nMR. STRAUSS: And an opportunity for prompt\njudicial review, that's right. Otherwise, just --\nQUESTION: How about the adequacy of judicial\nreview? I take it one objection was that you don't get\nany actual hearing in court. Everything is on the paper\nrecord.\nMR. STRAUSS: Justice Ginsburg, my reading of\nthe Illinois cases is that that's not true even in State\ncourt and, of course, the applicant has the option of\ngoing to the Federal court.\nMy reading of the Illinois cases is that you can\njoin a claim for equitable relief with the common law\ncertiorari, which is the Illinois way of reviewing\nadministrative proceedings, and you can certainly -- it's\nclear you could join a 198 -- a State court in a 1983\naction, and that would allow you to conduct full\ndiscovery.\nBut I guess my more fundamental answer to your\nquestion, Justice Ginsburg, is, it seems odd in this case\nto speculate about the adequacy of Illinois procedures\nwhen petitioner has not invoked them, and has not\ncomplained about the adequacy of the Federal proceedings\nthat he has invoked, that the place to decide whether\nIllinois provides adequate proceedings would be in a case\nwhere someone invokes them, and the Court then sees what\nthe Illinois courts are prepared to do in cases of this\nkind.\nIf the Court has no further questions --\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Strauss.\nMr. Feldman, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT\nMR. FELDMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIt's our position that the park district's\nordinance satisfies the First Amendment standards and the\njudgment of the court of appeals should be affirmed.\nQUESTION: Do you think we should view it as Mr.\nStrauss urges, as a zoning ordinance, or a business\nlicense, or as some kind of content-neutral time, place,\nand manner restriction?\nMR. FELDMAN: I think more the latter. This is\na public forum. There was a finding -- there may be other\nGovernment property that wouldn't fall within that\ncategory, but it is a public forum, and restrictions on\nspeech in a public forum are subject to the First\nAmendment, but the restriction in this ordinance, the\nrelevant restrictions are that the discretion that has to\nbe -- that may be exercised by the administrative body\ncan't be unfettered, but on the other hand, total\nprecision is not required, and I think, as Mr. Strauss\nexplained, there are 13 specified grounds under which a\npermit may be denied here, and those are the only grounds\nunder which it may be denied, and I think that's adequate\nguidance for whatever discretion or flexibility would be\nin the system. And indeed, some flexibility is necessary\nin a system where you re trying to accommodate competing\nusers and where the alternative, as the Court of Appeals\nsaid, if you allowed no flexibility at all, would be even\na minor or technical violation of one of those criteria,\nwould have to lead to a denial of a permit, which would\nmean a lot fewer people using the park, both for speech\nand for nonspeech purposes.\nQUESTION: It would make it a lot fairer,\nwouldn't it? I mean, you either meet the criteria, or you\ndon't. If you don't meet them, you don't get a permit.\nWhat's the matter with that?\nMR. FELDMAN: The problem would be exactly the\nkind of thing that Mr. Strauss described, is that if there\nis a minor -- if you put in your permit application\nslightly too late, or there was a stray mark on your\napplication, requiring total strictness on any of these\ncriteria would just mean that people who really should be\nentitled to have the opportunity to speak --\nQUESTION: Well, they didn't follow the rules.\nI mean, you're giving enormous discretion to the city.\nThey don't have discretion to deny, but among those that\nare deniable, they can allow some in and not allow others\nin.\nMR. FELDMAN: But I think --\nQUESTION: Why don't you just say, these are the\nrules, if you come in late, you haven't complied with the\nrules, period. That's very fair.\nMR. FELDMAN: I think as Mr. Strauss -- I think\nit was Mr. Strauss said, the -- whatever the flexibility\nor discretion that remains in a system like this would\nbe -- has to be exercised in accordance with those grounds\nfor denial. Those are the only grounds that are listed,\nand I think those are the only things the park district is\nsupposed to be taking into account in deciding whether to\ngrant or deny a permit, and -- but you can --\nQUESTION: How do you say it doesn't frustrate\nthe purpose of the provision which says, you know, the\nthing has to be in, you know, 2 weeks beforehand, if you\nget it in 1 week beforehand? How can you possibly say\nthat doesn't frustrate the purpose of the provision? The\npurpose is to give you 2 weeks to consider it.\nMR. FELDMAN: Right, but I think -- well, it\ncould well be that the purpose is to make sure that the\npark district can guarantee it can consider it, but if\nthey -- if it comes in on a day, 1 day late but there's\nnothing else on top of it that they're waiting to\nconsider, if it's in the wintertime when they have very\nfew permit applications, they can get to it anyhow, and\nthere's no reason for them not to permit that use of the\npark. In any event, that's --\nQUESTION: Even apart from that, I assume\nthere's no way to write a regulation that is not going to\nrequire some judgment, some discretion. I mean, what's\nmaterial in the falsehood, what is the conflict in the\nuses? I don't suppose you can eliminate that degree, the\ndegree of flexibility that is implied in applying concepts\nlike that.\nMR. FELDMAN: I think that's right, and I think\na crucial feature of this requirement is that, of the\nordinance here is that the parks are used for multiple\nuses by multiple people. There's a concern with\npreserving the park's own facilities so that people who\nwill use the same place in the future will have that\navailable to them, and there has to be some availability\nto accommodate all of that in the normal, in an ordinary\nadministrative scheme, and I think this scheme is well-\ndrawn, and if there are further difficulties with it, they\ncan be challenged on an as-applied basis.\nOne thing the park district can't do is make its\ndecisions based on favoring or disfavoring particular\nkinds of speech.\nQUESTION: Would it be --\nMR. FELDMAN: That should be addressed on an as-\napplied basis, and I think it could be in the State court\nproceedings, or in a 1983 proceeding.\nQUESTION: Along the lines of Justice Scalia's\nquestion, would it be proper for a city council or\nmunicipality to draft an ordinance just like this one and\nthen at the end saying, the commissioner of parks, in his\nsole discretion, may waive any or all of the foregoing\nrequirements?\nMR. FELDMAN: I think the -- the only\ndifficulty -- it would depend on what that meant. If it\nsaid, in his sole discretion meant he may consider\nanything he -- anything, I think that would be -- that\nwould probably be a problem, but if it meant, considering\nthe factors that are the legitimate factors on whether\nsomeone should use the park, which are the ones that are\nset out in the criteria, in the ordinance, I think it\nwould be actually similar to what the ordinance is.\nQUESTION: Well, we've said in a case like\nForsyth that discretion has to have some definition and\nsome control to it, and if you have at the end an absolute\nwaiver provision, it seems to me that would contradict\nthat.\nMR. FELDMAN: Oh, I think -- well, I think\nthat's right. If the meaning of that provision is that\nnotwithstanding what we've just said, the commissioner has\nabsolute discretion, I think that that would be correct,\nand that would pose a problem under Forsyth and the other\ncases that have said that you can't have that kind of\nunfettered discretion.\nThis is a guided -- this is a statute that has\nquite limited and guided --\nQUESTION: Well, how do we know that? Where\ndoes it say that the may, the may grant anyway is limited\nto those applications that generally meet the purposes of\nthe -- where does it say that? Do we just take your word\nfor it?\nMR. FELDMAN: Well --\nQUESTION: Or the park district's word for it?\nMR. FELDMAN: I think that that would at least\nbe the most reasonable construction of an ordinance like\nthis, where there's attempt to detail these 13 specific\ncriteria quite specifically, and there's no suggestion\nthat there's any other basis on which the park district\ncan act, and I think that that's just the most reasonable\ninterpretation of this kind of ordinance.\nAnd again on a facial as-applied -- one\ndifficulty with a facial challenge to an ordinance like\nthis is, you don't want to construe it in such a way as to\nintentionally render it unconstitutional and therefore\nlimit the ability of the park district to make its\nfacilities open, to have a permit scheme that really makes\nits facilities open to all.\nQUESTION: Mr. Feldman, do the Federal\nregulations for the use of Federal parks, the use of the\nMall, do they differ with respect to the may deny?\nMR. FELDMAN: No. They're -- well, they're very\nsimilar. The specific criteria are different, and are\ndifferently --\nQUESTION: But there is the may deny, implying\nthere are cases where, although you could, you don't have\nto deny?\nMR. FELDMAN: That's correct.\nQUESTION: And no criteria for the waiver in the\nFederal scheme either?\nMR. FELDMAN: No, and the way those have\nconsistently been applied is, those are the grounds that\nare to be considered in determining whether you can grant\na permit, and there aren't other grounds on which a permit\nwould be denied.\nNow, there -- the only other -- but actually, in\nthe Federal scheme at least, and probably here, too, some\ntypes of other -- some types of considerations can be\nconsidered. For example, if someone has a particular\nfacility that would be particularly good for one use, if\nsomeone wants to hold a rally on a baseball field, someone\nelse wants to have a baseball game there, I think they can\nsay, well, you have the baseball game on the baseball\nfield, and you have your rally at another location, and\nthere is some of that that goes on in proposing different\nparticular locales so as to accommodate all of the\ndifferent users who want to use the park.\nQUESTION: And is there a first come, first\nserve rule?\nMR. FELDMAN: Basically, yes. If you satisfy\nthe other requirements of the rule, it's basically similar\nto this. It's subject to -- the actual first come, first\nserved rule under the National Park Service parks here in\nWashington like this has to do with the date of the\napplication, not the date on which it's processed.\nIf there are no other, further questions, that\nconcludes --\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Feldman.\nMr. Wilson, you have 2 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD L. WILSON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. WILSON: Justice O'Connor, I'd like to\naddress quickly two points that you raised. First,\nthere's no meaningful administrative procedure. There is\nno mechanism. They send you a letter telling you that\nyour permit was denied, and they read off the violations.\nYou send a letter back and say, I did not do any of that,\nand they say, oh, yes, you did, denied. That's the end of\nit. There is no hearing. You don't even get to know who\nmade the allegations.\nSecondly, in your inquiry as to judicial review,\nthis Court unanimously provided us with a crystal clear\ndefinition of prompt judicial review. There should be no\nmystery in the Federal circuits. Another unanimous\nopinion, Blunt v. Rizzi, written by the same Justice who\nwrote Freedman, and on a Court that contains six of the\njustices who participated in Freedman, Blunt defined\nprompt judicial review as follows:\nA final judicial determination on the merits\nwithin a specified brief period. That was in 1971, so\nthere should have been no mystery from the plurality of\nopinion in FW/PBS, because that plurality opinion did not\nsay, there must be the availability of judicial review.\nThat opinion said, there must be availability of prompt\njudicial review --\nQUESTION: Mr. Wilson, what does that mean if\nyou pick the Federal court, that Illinois is going to\nwrite a statute that says, and if you choose to come to\nthe Federal court rather than the State court, the Federal\ncourt is going to have X number of days to decide it?\nMR. WILSON: Justice Ginsburg, that would be the\nchoice of the park district of the City of Chicago,\nbecause the park district is the party that has to go to\ncourt to seek --\nQUESTION: Oh, if you're -- but that's not what\nJustice O'Connor said in her case. She didn't take that\nlast part of Freedman.\nMR. WILSON: But there's certainly a distinction\nbetween those businesses that Justice O'Connor was writing\nabout in FW/PBS and a core political speech.\nQUESTION: Well, suppose we reject your notion\nthat the scheme is invalid unless the park goes to court,\nand the court has a tight time line? Suppose we reject\nthat?\nMR. WILSON: I would then say, Justice Ginsburg,\nthat this Court has elevated the kind of sexually explicit\nspeech in that case above the core political speech in\nthis case, based on the context of the speech, which would\nfly in the face of --\nQUESTION: Well, I don't follow that at all.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Wilson.\n"
