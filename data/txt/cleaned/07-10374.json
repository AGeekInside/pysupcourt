MURTAGH\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. MURTAGH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn a 4-3 decision, the New York Court of\nAppeals affirmed Correction Law Section 24, which\nprohibits Petitioner from bringing a Section 1983 claim\nfor money damages in any court of the State of New York.\nInstead, that statute relegates Mr. Haywood\nand anyone else seeking money damages under section 1983\nto either bring their case in Federal court or to accept\nwhat the New York legislature has deemed a State law\nalternative. That State law alternative does not allow\nMr. Haywood to sue the prison guards who violated his\ncivil rights; instead he can only sue the State. It\nprovides for no punitive damages, it provides for no\nattorneys' fees; a shortened 90-day notice of claim\nprovision, 30 days shorter than what this Court found\nviolative in Felder; and provides for no right to jury\ntrial.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It does provide for a\nwaiver of sovereign immunity and says that the State\nwill respond in damages. It might be -- I'm not sure --\nthat many prisoners would prefer this. They have got a\nsolvent -- I hope they're solvent -- defendant.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. MURTAGH: Your Honor, it is true that\nthe State has waived sovereign immunity for claims\nbrought in the Court of Claims under that State law.\nBut, Your Honor, they haven't waived sovereign immunity\nfor punitive damages or for attorneys' fees, both of\nwhich are remedies that are specifically available to\nPetitioners, to plaintiffs, in section 1983 actions.\nThis State law alternative, even if it\ndidn't independently violate the supremacy clause by\nsubstituting New York's judgment for that of Congress,\nwould not actually be a real alternative for Mr. Haywood\nor for anyone else who wanted to bring a suit against\nprison officials.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, we can just mark\nthat place in the record. It -- it does seem to me that\nthere is some real benefits to the prisoners under --\nunder the New York scheme. It's -- many counsel may\nthink it's preferable than to sue under 1983.\nMR. MURTAGH: Your Honor -- Your Honor,\nthere may be -- reasonable minds I think could differ, I\nthink, about whether it's preferable to have the State\nas a solvent entity or the -- or the prison employee as\na defendant. But I think there's two important points\non that.\nNumber one, in their briefing, the\nRespondents have argued that they will indemnify State\nemployees regardless of where the case is brought. If\nthe State has already agreed to provide indemnification,\nthen you don't need the State as a defendant simply to\nbe solvent. The State has already --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, except in --\nthey said except in cases where the guards are acting\noutside the scope of their employment.\nMR. MURTAGH: Yes, Your Honor. Under\nCorrection Law Section 24, if the guard is acting\noutside the scope of the employment, then the case can\nbe brought in New York's courts of general jurisdiction.\nThe important point here, Your Honors, is\nthere are two separate related reasons that this law is\nunconstitutional. The first is because New York's\nlegislature has redefined the remedies available under\nsection 1983, they have, in effect, substituted their\njudgment about what constitutes good policy for\nCongress's judgment.\nIn this particular case, Mr. Haywood or any\nother plaintiff in New York State, could bring a section\n1983 claim in State court, but only if he agrees to give\nup his right to seek money damages.\nCongress determined, in setting forth the\npurpose and the effect of section 1983, that plaintiffs\nought to be entitled to both money damages and equitable\ndamages.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He can still get that in\nFederal court, can't he?\nMR. MURTAGH: Your Honor, it's --\nJustice Scalia it's absolutely true that Mr. Haywood\ncould bring his case in Federal court and would be\nentitled to all the remedies available under section\n1983 had he brought it in Federal court. But that issue\nis not dispositive in this case. And the reason it's\nnot dispositive is that in the whole line of cases that\nthis Court has considered where it has required States\nto hear actions as long as they hear similar or\nanalogous actions, a Federal forum was available in each\nof those cases as well.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess there's a\ndifference. I mean, obviously Felder is significant\nhelp to you. But I suppose it's a difference to say\nthey've redefined the cause of action under Federal law\nand said they are just not going to hear it at all. It\nmay seem paradoxical, but the latter may be from a\nconstitutional point of view the sounder\ncharacterization, because it's obviously not the\nresponsibility or the authority of States to say, well,\nthis is how the Federal law is going to be applied.\nBut it might be their -- their -- within\ntheir authority to say, look, this is what our State\ncourt system provides and if you don't like it for a\nFederal claim, you have always got the Federal courts.\nMR. MURTAGH: Your Honor, under this Court's\ndecisions not only in Felder but going back to Martinez,\nthis Court has said that -- that it hasn't decided\nwhether a State is required to create a court to hear\nFederal claims. And I don't think the Court needs to\nreach that issue in this case, because New York has\nalready established courts of general jurisdiction, its\nsupreme court, the trial level court, that are competent\nto hear these cases.\nThese courts regularly hear common law tort\ncases, they regularly hear section 1983 --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah, but `they are\nnot really or at least you can view it as they are not\ndiscriminating against the Federal cause of action,\nbecause they don't allow the State cause of action of\nthe sort you want to pursue either.\nMR. MURTAGH: Your Honor, that seems to be\nthe crux of the Respondents' argument. And I think the\nfundamental problem with that argument is that, although\nNew York specifically exempts prison -- cases against\nprison officials, that's not enough. And the reason\nit's not enough is that if you can merely invoke the\nword \"jurisdiction,\" as this Court pointed out in\nHowlett, the mere -- the force of the Supremacy Clause\nis not so weak that it can be evaded by the mere mention\nof the word \"jurisdiction.\"\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's --\nthat's true. And Howlett does say that. But as we've\npointed out on many occasions, \"jurisdiction\" is a term\nthat covers a lot of different things. And at some\npoint something starts to look jurisdictional, which is,\nlook, we're not going to hear your case at all. In\nother areas, even if they call it jurisdictional, it\nreally doesn't seem that way, such as, well, you've got\nto give this much notice or you've got to -- you know,\nmaybe those things aren't really jurisdictional. But\nsaying you can't bring the case at all strikes me as\nreally jurisdictional.\nMR. MURTAGH: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I\nthink there are a couple of points on that. The first\nis that in the cases where this Court has found that\nthere was a neutral jurisdictional rule, Herb v.\nPitcairn, Douglas, Mayfield, and then later in\nJohnson v. Frankell, in every single one of those cases\nthe underlying rule of jurisdiction did not speak to the\nidentity of the parties and did not address the\nunderlying substance of the claim. Those were rules\nthat simply talked about how a case could move through\nthe courts.\nFor example, in Douglas neither party was a\nresident of the State of New York and the New York court\nsaid: If you're not residents, you can't come in and\nuse our courts.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's not how it moves\nthrough the courts. That is, you don't have a forum.\nThat sounds to me like a jurisdictional ruling. Those\ncases that say, our courts don't sit to hear cases where\nthe parties are nonresidents, both sides; our courts\ndon't sit to hear cases about accidents that happened in\nTimbuktu, those sound like, we don't offer a forum for\nthat type of case, as distinguished from here, where New\nYork does have a forum, it just won't kind of give one\nkind of relief.\nMR. MURTAGH: Justice Ginsburg, I think -- I\nthink that that is exactly right. The point here is\nthat in -- in -- in Douglas, where the court did not --\nwhere the New York courts did not allow any party --\nwhere both parties were nonresidents of New York they\nwouldn't hear the case, that applied regardless of the\nidentity of the employee. It didn't matter whether the\ndefendant was an employee of the State of New York or\nnot.\nAnd it also applied regardless of what the\nunderlying substantive claim was. It didn't matter\nwhether it was a tort action or a contract action or\nanything else. If you weren't in New York, if you\nweren't a resident of New York, you couldn't take\nadvantage of its -- of its courts.\nAnd in -- in Herb v. Pitcairn, where you had\nthe situation where there was a -- there was a railroad\naccident brought in one county court in Illinois, it\nshould have been brought in a different county court,\nthe Court went -- went out of its way to say the State\nof Illinois has provided other forums, other State\ncourts where you could have brought this case.\nAnd if the State, for example, in the\npresent case had said, Mr. Haywood, you filed this case\nin Wyoming County Supreme Court and it really should\nhave been brought down in Syracuse, that would be a\nneutral rule of jurisdiction. It just dictates where\nthe case ought to be brought.\nBy contrast, what New York has done here is\nthat they have absolutely forbidden anyone to seek money\ndamages against a prison official. And the reason that\nthey did that, as conceded in the Respondents' briefing,\nis because they don't want prison officials to be\ndistracted from their duties. They don't want prison\nofficials to have to face the fear of vexatious\nlawsuits.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the -- the New\nYork legislature said, you have a choice, you can bring\na 1983 suit or you can bring this sort of suit against\nthe State, and the State will respond to damages, but\nyou can't do both. Can they do that?\nMR. MURTAGH: No, Your Honor, I don't think\nthey could. Once the State -- this Court's\njurisprudence teaches us that once a court -- once a\nState opens its courts to hear analogous State law\nclaims, it cannot then close its doors selectively to\nFederal claims.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What Justice Kennedy has\nasked you: Say, you could have this Federal claim, but\nwe are going to offer you a substitute under New York\nlaw, which the Federal authority could not force us to\ndo, because it's a State waiving its sovereign immunity.\nMR. MURTAGH: I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg;\ncertainly the State of New York could offer a State law\nalternative in addition to section 1983.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no, I said in the\nalternative.\nMR. MURTAGH: Okay. I don't believe,\nJustice Kennedy, that -- that New York could force a\nplaintiff to give up the right to sue section -- sue\nunder section 1983 if the courts are otherwise open to\ntort actions in similar circumstances.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. Now, suppose\nthey do it -- they say -- we are just talking about the\nState courts: you can't bring both types in State\ncourts. You can still have your Federal cause of action\nin the Federal court, and we will also give our cause of\naction where the State's law is violated, but not both\nin the New York courts.\nMR. MURTAGH: No, Justice Kennedy. Once --\nonce New York establishes courts of general jurisdiction\nthat are competent to hear these kinds of cases, it\ncan't close its doors to section 1983 claims for money\ndamages.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But it's okay for the State\nto say, we don't want any tort actions in our courts?\nThat would be all right?\nMR. MURTAGH: Yes, Justice Scalia. It\nseems --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's strange. Why -- but\nit can't do the lesser thing of saying, we don't want\nthis particular type of tort action. One is\njurisdictional -- you would say it's jurisdictional,\nright? And this one is not jurisdictional, just because\nit's narrower? It's still directed to the type of\naction.\nMR. MURTAGH: Justice Scalia, I think the\ndistinction is -- relates to the relative power of\nCongress and the States. Once Congress has spoken and\nhas provided a Federal cause of action, that becomes New\nYork law. And New York, as long as it has a court, is\nrequired to enforce that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but not if New York\nsaid, we don't want any tort actions. What about if New\nYork says, we don't want any -- uh -- personal injury\ntort actions? Would that be enough, or is that too\nnarrow? And I'm going to narrow it down after that\nuntil I get down to your case.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. MURTAGH: Justice Scalia, I -- I am not\nsure exactly where the line is in terms of the analogy.\nI think this case is very far on the other side. In\nother words, because New York State here -- even here, a\nsection 1983 claim, this isn't a situation where they\nsay, we have a court that's not competent to hear\nsection 1983 claims. They simply say: We're not going\nto allow them to hear section 1983 claims for money\ndamages where there is a prison official who's -- who is\nthe defendant.\nIf the defendant here, Justice Scalia, were\na police officer who had engaged in the same conduct,\nNew York State courts would have to hear that case. So\nthis is not the sort of thing --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I understand that. I just\ndon't understand -- you acknowledge it's okay if it's\njurisdictional; and you acknowledge that it is\njurisdictional if you don't allow any tort actions. I\njust don't know what makes this to be\nnon-jurisdictional. I don't know.\nMR. MURTAGH: I think it -- intellectually,\nJustice Scalia, it seems to me that the distinction is\nthat -- that there has to be a point at which you do\nrespect the relative authority of the State and the\nFederal Governments. By saying that a State may -- we\nare not going to require that a State establish a court\nto hear a whole kind of action that they otherwise\nwouldn't hear, that's providing some deference to the\nauthority of the State, as the Respondents point out,\npart of the core sovereignty of the State, to establish\ntheir courts and to run their courts.\nBy contrast, once they have done that, once\nthey provided that court system, then the power balance\nshifts.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if this were at\nthe beginning of whenever New York was establishing a\ncourt system, and they said from the outset, look, we\nare not going to hear these types of cases, then this\nwould be okay?\nMR. MURTAGH: Your Honor, I think under this\nCourt's jurisprudence that would -- if the State of New\nYork said we are not going to hear any kind of tort\naction, regardless of whether it's Federal or State, and\nit doesn't --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no, that's\nmixing the two points. Your point I understand it --\nMR. MURTAGH: Okay.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- is that once the\ncourt has opened it up to a particular type of claim,\nthey can't say, say no more. So if they are setting\nup -- obviously we are not going to go back to whenever\nthe New York State courts was established. But if they\nsuddenly said, we are going to revise our court system\nor - or modernize it, and from now on we are not going\nto do this?\nMR. MURTAGH: As long as -- as long as the\nwithdrawal of jurisdiction was across all analogous\nState law claims as well as the Federal claim, then,\nyes. I mean, we could discuss whether that would be a\ngood idea or not, but I think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, we would discuss what\nis analogous.\nMR. MURTAGH: Yes, and that's -- that's a\nvery good point, Justice Scalia; and this Court has told\nus as litigants what it thinks are analogous claims. In\nFelder, this Court said an analogous claim for purposes\nof section 1983 is a common law tort. That's the thing\nthat's most like a section 1983 claim. So the real\nquestion here is does New York State provide courts that\ncan hear common law tort claims? There is no dispute in\nthis case that they do.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Now, why can't New York\ntake the position, we want to be realistic about these\nsuits? New York has provided that it is going to --\nit's going to pick up the tab. If you sue a\ncorrectional officer, New York is going to pick up the\ntab.\nSo -- so we are going to channel this suit\nto the court, the one court in the State that deals with\nthe State, the sovereign, paying money, the court of\nclaims. So all they are doing is recognizing the\nreality that this is a suit against New York, not the\ncorrectional officer because it won't cost the\ncorrectional officer a dime; New York is going to\nprovide counsel and is going to pay any judgment.\nSo really where this case belongs is in the\ncourt that hears claims against the State of New York.\nMR. MURTAGH: Justice Ginsburg, the problem\nwith that analysis, I think, is that in the court of\nclaims there are all sorts of other limitations.\nThis -- this notion that this is simply a\nsubstitute claim and that it's just as good enough, I\nthink really is a red herring in this case; because what\nhas happened here is not that New York has created a\nseparate court with specialized expertise that knows how\nto try these cases, which it probably could do under\nthis Court's jurisprudence. Rather, what it has done is\nit's required you to sue the State instead of the\nindividual, and then put a whole host of limitations on\nthe sort of relief that you can seek, and on the way\nthat you can bring your case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it's done exactly\nwhat the Federal system has done. So that if you have a\nmoney claim against -- that is going to be against the\nFederal Government, here's what you do: You go to the\nCourt of Claims, you have to go to the Court of Claims;\nand in that court all sorts of special rules apply about\nnotice and other things.\nMR. MURTAGH: And that is absolutely true,\nJustice Roberts, if the claim initially were a claim\nagainst the State. But of course section 1983 doesn't\nprovide for a claim against the State. In Will v.\nMichigan this Court held that the State is not a person\nfor purposes of section 1983, and so the only way you\ncan have a section 1983 claim --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but in the\nFederal system if you sue a Federal official or a\npostman and in fact in reality it's going to be a claim\nagainst the United States, that has to go to the Court\nof Claims, too.\nMR. MURTAGH: And Your Honor, that is\nabsolutely something that Congress can decide to do with\nrespect to Federal law, and New York can decide with\nrespect to State law to do whatever it wants in terms of\nsetting up where those claims can go.\nWhat New York cannot do is to impose that\npolicy judgment on the Federal claim, because Congress\nhas already determined --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess my point is\nthat there's nothing fishy about what New York has done\nhere. Which leads me to think, well, maybe it's not\nreally discrimination against the Federal claim, it's a\nrational way to handle claims against the State\ntreasury, just as the Federal system is a rational way\nto handle claims against the Federal treasury.\nMR. MURTAGH: Regardless of how rational an\nidea this is or how good an idea this is, for this Court\nto adopt a rule that says that once a State disagrees\nwith Congress about how people ought to be liable under\na Federal remedy would require this Court in essence to\nsay that the rationale of several of your previous cases\ncould be undone. And I think this Court pointed out in\nHowlett that if all you had to do was say, our courts\nwon't have jurisdiction over a certain category of\nclaims that -- the Wisconsin legislature in Felder could\nhave said: Our courts shall have no jurisdiction unless\nthere is 120-day notice of claim provided.\nThe courts in Martinez in California -- the\nCalifornia legislature could have said, our State courts\nwill have no jurisdiction --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that just goes\nback to our previous colloquy about what jurisdiction is\nand what it means. I mean, are you saying that if we\nlook at this and we decide yes, this does really look\nlike jurisdiction in the real sense, rather than just a\njurisdictional label -- if we do that, then you lose?\nMR. MURTAGH: I think that if this Court\nfound that this were a jurisdiction -- a neutral rule of\njurisdiction that constituted a valid excuse, that, yes,\nthat would probably -- that would probably undermine my\nargument significantly.\nI think to get there, Chief Justice, you\nwould have to -- you would have to sort of engage in\nsome interesting thinking which I haven't gotten my mind\naround, to be quite honest. The -- what this Court said\nin Howlett is, when we talk about jurisdiction, when we\ntalk about what constitutes jurisdiction, we are talking\nabout whether there is power over the subject matter and\npower over the parties involved. And I don't think the\nRespondents in this case even argue that the New York\nsupreme courts don't have the power over the parties\nhere or don't have competence over this kind of subject\nmatter.\nThis case doesn't have any of the\nattributes, this rule, this correctional law section 24,\ndoesn't have any of the attributes of a neutral\nprocedural rule --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Isn't jurisdiction whatever\nthe legislature says it is? Do you think there is some\nsort of -- you know, a Platonic ideal of jurisdiction\nversus non-jurisdiction, and that's what we apply here?\nMR. MURTAGH: Justice Alito, I think that\njurisdiction -- that to determine whether a rule is\njurisdictional requires that this Court look at the\npurpose and the effect of the underlying statute. And\nif all a State has to do is say it's jurisdictional and\nif jurisdiction is whatever the State says it is, then\nthat means that, going back to Felder and Martinez and\nsome of those cases, a State could -- could evade this\nCourt's rulings merely by reframing the statutes in the\nwords of jurisdiction.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So what is the -- what is\nthe standard for determining whether it's jurisdictional\nor not?\nMR. MURTAGH: Well, Justice Alito, the --\nthe important points, I think, come out of Felder: That\nit is a neutral rule that is applicable to all cases and\nthat is not concerned with the underlying substance of\nthe claim. So, for example, when we go back to the old\ncases, Douglas, Mayfield, Herb v. Pitcairn, this Court\nwas looking at situations where there were rules that\napplied everywhere.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you have acknowledged\nthat it would be okay and would be a jurisdictional rule\nif the court -- if the State courts did not entertain\ntort actions. That's a rule that goes to the substance\nof the claim, isn't it?\nMR. MURTAGH: Well, Your Honor, it goes to\nthe substance of the claim, but it applies generally\nacross all claims. It's not -- it's not picking and\nchoosing. It's not targeted towards a specific --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, it's picking and\nchoosing tort claims.\nMR. MURTAGH: Well, it's picking and\nchoosing tort claims as opposed, I suppose, to contract\nclaims.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. MURTAGH: But it's not, Your Honor,\nsaying: We're going to accept this kind of tort claim\nbut not that kind of tort claim. We're going to allow\nto you sue a police officer who beats you up, but you\ncan't sue a corrections officer who beats you up.\nThat's the real difference, I think.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is there something you add\n-- you add to your statement of your rule? A neutral\nrule not related to substance, but related to the\nadministration of the courts?\nMR. MURTAGH: Yes, Justice Breyer. I think\nthat --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Don't just be agreeable to\nbe agreeable. Do cases actually say that?\nMR. MURTAGH: I think, Your Honor -- I'd\nhave to get the exact language from Felder, but I think\nthat it is a neutral rule regarding the administration\nof the courts that is unrelated to the underlying\nsubstance of the matter or the nature of the parties.\nYour Honors, the most recent -- going on a\nlittle bit about this jurisdictional issue -- the most\nrecent case that held that there was a neutral rule of\njudicial administration, a neutral procedural rule, was\nJohnson v. Fankell. And this Court will recall that, in\nthat case, Idaho had a rule that required that there be\na final judgment before an intermediate -- before an\nappeal could be taken from that.\nThis Court allowed Idaho to impose that rule\non a section 1983 claim because the defendants there had\nargued that they were entitled to qualified immunity.\nThey lost at the trial level. They then sought an\ninterlocutory appeal. And this Court said certainly\nIdaho can set forth the ways in which you take appeal\nfrom any kind of a case, and, more importantly, this is\nnot a rule that is targeted at civil rights claims and\nin fact may lead to over-enforcement of civil rights\nclaims because it prevents a defendant from getting out\nof the case very early.\nThat's the kind of case where there's a\nneutral rule. That's not what we have here.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You are being generous\nwhen you said that we would recall -- at least that I\nwould recall the case. Is it Idaho, did you say, or\nJohnson?\nMR. MURTAGH: In Johnson v. Fankell, I\nbelieve --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It was Johnson. I thought\nyou said Idaho.\nMR. MURTAGH: Yes. I'm sorry, Your Honor.\nI just said that the Idaho courts were involved in that\none.\nYour Honor, the approach that's urged by the\nRespondents in this -- in this case really would dictate\ndifferent results, as I mentioned. You'd wind up -- in\nFelder and in Martinez, the courts could just use the\nword \"jurisdiction.\" And actually, even if you go back\nto three of this Court's earlier cases, Mondou in 1912,\nMcKnett in 1934, Testa v. Katt in 1947 -- in Testa v.\nKatt, this Court required Connecticut to hear an\nEmergency Price Control Act even though Connecticut\nregularly refused to hear cases that they thought were\npenal in nature. And what this Court said was: You\nhear analogous claims; you have to hear the Emergency\nPrice Control Act.\nNow, if this Court were to adopt a rule that\nthe State could simply say, we have no jurisdiction over\ncertain categories of claims, then in Testa, Connecticut\ncould simply have said: We are not going to have\njurisdiction over any case seeking penal or punitive\ntypes of damages. That would require that we really\nundo a lot of this Court's jurisprudence.\nIf there are no further questions at this\npoint, I would reserve my time, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nMurtagh.\nMs. Underwood.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA D. UNDERWOOD\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Thank you,\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:\nThe Federal Constitution permits State\ncourts to hear Federal claims, but it does not require a\nState to hear them so long as the State does not\ndiscriminate against Federal claims in comparison with\nsimilar State claims.\nNew York's statute fully satisfies that\nrequirement. New York courts cannot hear damage actions\nagainst prison officials for conduct in the scope of\ntheir employment. And it doesn't matter whether State\nor Federal law is the basis for the claim.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Ms. Underwood, if that's\ngoing to be the criterion, that they exclude a State\ncause of action as readily as they exclude a Federal\ncause of action, then isn't the State always going to\nwin every case in which there is an issue like this one?\nBecause unless the State is so blatantly discriminatory\nor so blatantly inadvertent as to leave a cause of\naction of its own making on the books, when it says, \"We\nwon't hear the Federal one,\" what you posit is always\ngoing to be the case. And if that's -- if the rule is\nthat as long as there is no State action comparable to\nthe Federal action that is disallowed, the State wins,\nin practical terms the State always wins.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Well, that's not so. This\nCourt has in fact invalidated statutes and found\ndiscrimination. There were -- three of the early FELA\n-- two FELA cases and the Testa case itself. In Testa,\ncontrary to what was just suggested, the Court -- this\nCourt found discrimination. When Rhode Island said that\nit wasn't going to hear the emergency price control\npenal statute --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, suppose a State\nextends --\nMS. UNDERWOOD: -- the Court --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Suppose a State extends\nsovereign immunity to a broad class of State employees\nwith reference to State law claims. Would that mean\nthat the State could close its courts to all 1983\nactions --\nMS. UNDERWOOD: No. Immunity --\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- against those same\ndefendants?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: No. Immunity and\njurisdiction are really quite different. They both have\nthe result that the defendant loses.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, what if they phrase it\nin terms of jurisdiction? There is no jurisdiction in\ncourts of New York to hear any intentional tort action\nagainst a correctional official for action taken during\nthe performance of the correctional officer's duties.\nDo they then close the New York courts completely to\n1983 actions against correctional officials?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: If they not only used the\nword \"jurisdiction\" but gave the rule jurisdictional\neffect -- that is to say, a jurisdictional bar is one\nthat can't be waived by the defendants, whereas immunity\ncan be waived. So it protects courts, not defendants.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Underwood, there is a\nfeature of this case, even assuming that you were right\nabout -- New York has not withdrawn jurisdiction from\nits courts over a 1983 claim; it has simply limited,\ntaken away, one mode of relief. That is, you can sue a\ncorrectional official for declaratory relief, you could\nsue for injunctive relief. All New York has taken away\nis one mode of relief. That's not jurisdictional unless\nyou say that every element of damages is jurisdictional.\nNew York allows this type of claim in their\ncourts. We are talking about jurisdiction over the\nperson? Yes, they have jurisdiction over the\ncorrectional official's person. Subject matter --\nsubject matter is a 1983 case? Yes. All they are\ncutting off is one form of relief.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Well, it's not just any form\nof relief. It's not just, for instance, the type of\ndamages. The difference between law and equity has a\nlong tradition in this country. They are really two\ndifferent actions, an action for injunctive relief or an\naction for damages. The courts now hear them together.\nBut what New York has said is it has no jurisdiction --\nits courts have no jurisdiction against -- over damage\nactions against corrections officials.\nAnd as I was saying earlier, jurisdiction is\ndifferent from immunity, both because it can't be waived\n-- so it's about courts, not the defendants -- because\nit -- because a dismissal won't bar litigating the\nmatter in Federal court. A dismissal -- an immunity\nwould result in a judgment --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Practically --\npractically, hasn't what New York has done is to confer\non its correctional officers absolute immunity, not\nmerely qualified immunity? So if you want to be\nrealistic about what is the effect of New York's law, it\nsays you are going to be subject to equitable relief,\ndeclaratory relief, but as far as money is concerned,\nyou are absolutely immune.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: I don't think it's immunity.\nI think it's a refusal to hear the case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What's the difference\nof -- practically?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Practically --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't the -- isn't the\npractical effect -- if you tried to explain to\ncorrectional officers what is your exposure, you would\nsay: You have absolute immunity from anything that's\ngoing to try to reach into your pocket.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Not at all. This is like a\nforced removal, is what it really is.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They're -- they are liable\nin Federal court.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Yes, that's exactly correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They're certainly not\nimmune in Federal court.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: They are fully liable in\nFederal court. That's where these cases are being\nbrought right now. Congress has never expressed any\npolicy for mandating that they be brought in State\ncourt, because even if these cases could have been\nbrought in the first place in State courts, the Federal\n-- the State defendant could remove it to Federal court.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the theory was\nthat in our Federal system, Federal law is State law,\ntoo? That is the highest law for a State. Federal law\nby virtue of the Supremacy Clause is State law; and\nsometimes Congress creates an exclusive Federal\njurisdiction over certain types of claims. But if\nCongress doesn't do that, the assumption is there is\nconcurrent jurisdiction.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: That's correct. But that's\nif the Court is open to the case. The Fender case, the\nline of cases that Petitioner has been pointing to, is\nsimply not applicable here where the State opens its\ncourts to the cases. If the State were hearing damage\nactions against corrections officers, it couldn't give\nthem immunity.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But what is the neutral\nreason related to the administration of courts that\nleads the State to close its door to a damage suit under\n1983 against correctional officers?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- taking as the assumption\nexactly what Justice Ginsburg said. I mean, I can't\nfind any reason that's neutral and administrative other\nthan what Justice Ginsburg said, which is neither:\nnamely New York does not like 1983 actions for damages\nagainst correctional officers. What other reason is\nthere?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: First of all, these -- this\n-- I would like to correct an observation. This -- this\nis not aimed only or even principally at 1983 actions.\nThis law does predate the -- not the enactment of 1983,\nbut the proliferation, the use -- the widespread use of\n1983; and in fact it affects a great many State cases.\nIt's not only --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But Testa v Katt was a case\nin which the Court found that the State allows some\nState action that are analogous to the Federal action\nand you can't discriminate against a Federal action.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: That's true.\nJUSTICE BREYER: This is not that case.\nThis is a case where the State doesn't allow -- doesn't\nallow -- damage actions like the Federal action --\nMS. UNDERWOOD: If --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- and this Court has not\ndecided to my knowledge how we apply the basic rule in\nsuch a situation. So I would think that the way we\nwould apply it is take the standard and ask the State,\nwhat is the neutral administrative-related reason?\nBecause what they are saying is, if you look at this,\nfrom an administrative point of view, it's that\nred-haired, one-eyed man with a limp.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Prisons are large\ninstitutions in rural counties that generate a vast\namount of litigation. This particular prisoner was in a\nprison in a rural county like Wyoming County that had I\nthink 3,000 or so prisoners in it, and the litigation\ngenerated by the prisons isn't just actions by\nprisoners. This statute doesn't apply only to actions\nagainst -- by prisoners. It also applies to actions by\nprison employees against other prison employees --\nactions by anybody against a -- corrections officials.\nSo it's all the vast forms of litigation, principally\nbut not exclusively prisoner complaints, that arise out\nof prisons.\nThat is a very large and burdensome amount\nof litigation, unlike litigation against State police,\nwhich some have said is comparable, which is dispersed\nall over the State. This is concentrated where the\nlarge prisons are; and it is a reasonable decision -- a\nneutral reason, if you will -- for the State to decide\nto take those actions out of the courts of general\njurisdiction, to take actions -- damage actions arising\nout of the prisons out of the courts of general\njurisdiction, where it would be concentrated in a few\ncounties where the large prisons are.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: General Underwood, your\nfriend on the other side acknowledges that if New York\nstates closed its courts to tort actions, that would be\nokay. But I don't see how closing your courts to tort\nactions has any administrative -- particular\nadministrative rationale behind it, do you?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: No, and I don't believe that\nthis Court's cases about jurisdiction, as distinguished\nfrom its cases about case handling rules, require that\nkind of neutral administrative feature.\nI only was suggesting that there exists such\nan explanation for this rule; but in fact, this Court\nhas treated quite differently cases about case handling,\nand that makes sense. Because if you hear a claim -- if\nthe State hear a claim and then impose even a\nnondiscriminatory -- but it's certainly a discriminatory\nrule that tends to defeat the claim, the State might\ninduce plaintiffs to bring their claims in State court\nand then lose them under disadvantageous procedures.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose that the State of\nNew York said that in suits against corrections --\nagainst the corrections department, against the State,\nthere should be no damages awarded to a prisoner in\nexcess of $3,000; and then the --\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Well, I think --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- and then 1980 -- and\nthen the prisoner tries to bring a 1983 suit in State\ncourt.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Well, I think --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Would the case -- would\nthe analysis be just the same?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: No, I don't think the\nanalysis would be the same. I think once the State\nopens its doors to a damage action against corrections\nofficials, the question would be -- the answer might or\nmight not come out the same way, but I think it probably\nwould come out differently.\nThe -- the question would be, does that\nprocedural rule -- there are two questions: Is it\ndiscriminatory? You're saying -- your hypothetical is\nthat it's not discriminatory as between State and\nFederal, and the second question would be does it\nundermine the Federal cause -- does it undermine the\nFederal claim?\nAnd so in Martinez, when this Court said\nState immunities can't apply to Federal 1983 actions,\nonly Federal immunities can apply, the Court was careful\nto observe that California had opened its courts to this\ncase and had an immunity, whereas --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In my hypothetical, do you\nthink it undermines the Federal claims?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: No. I think it could be\nargued, I think it would be argued that limiting damages\nundermines a Federal action that is meant to bar courts\nfrom interpretation --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But why can't it be argued\nhere that Congress has an important mechanism in holding\nprison officials -- prison correctional officers --\npersonally liable, so that they are themselves aware\nthat they have a constitutional obligation that is\nenforceable against them, and New York has taken this\naway?\nNow you may -- we may argue that if the\nState responds in damages, the prisoner is better off;\nbut Congress has not made that judgment. Congress has\nmade the judgment that the correctional officer himself\nor herself should be responsible.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Well, I don't believe\nCongress has made that judgment. So that I -- and\nthat's my answer to why I don't think this undermines\nthe Federal cause --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, it has made that\njudgment. That's the whole purpose of 1983.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: No, the purpose of 1983 is\nto -- actually was two things. It's to provide a\nFederal forum and it was to provide compensation for\nthese torts, and I believe that these --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He's still responsible,\nright? I mean --\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He's still responsible.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: I think there is no Federal\npolicy --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, the correctional\nofficer, under the scheme we are talking about, is not\nresponsible in damages.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: He is responsible to exactly\nthe same degree as he would be, were he sued personally,\nbecause New York indemnifies him and there is no\nrequirement -- Congress has never shown any objection to\nindemnification.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- does your case turn\non whether or not there is an indemnification agreement?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: I don't know that our case\nturns on whether --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I shouldn't think so.\nThat hasn't been your argument so far.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Well, what I'm saying is to\nthe extent -- I don't believe we need to -- if you think\nthat we need to -- that there may be a conflict with a\nFederal policy, I think the statute stands because it's\nnondiscriminatory and jurisdictional. But if there is a\nquestion, it's not a question of whether -- yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Just you ask an offshoot\nof Justice Kennedy's question. Supposing you had a\nstatute that said in railroad cases there should be no\ndamage -- railroad tort cases, brought by employees of\nrailroads, there was no damage judgment in excess of\n$10,000, in State court? Would that be okay?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: No, I don't think so, for\nthe same reason I don't think -- that is, if you have a\ntort remedy that the State is hearing than a limit on\nrecovering that goes -- that is inconsistent with\ncongressional policy is not permitted. But if the State\nwere to say we won't hear any tort cases or we won't\nhear any tort cases involving railroads or we won't hear\nany tort cases --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think --\nconsistently with our FELA cases it could have a rule\nthat no tort -- no tort cases may be brought by railroad\nemployees against the railroad in a State court.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: State or Federal. There is\nnothing in your FELA cases that says that as long as the\nState is closing its doors equally. And there are, of\ncourse, political reasons --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, they shouldn't have\nclosed the Federal doors under the FELA. They surely\ncould bring the suit under Federal.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: No, but -- but --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But you are saying they\ncould -- as opposed to State courts, the suits against\nrailroads where the damage gets -- over $10,000?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: No, I don't think they could\nput the damage requirement on, because then they would\nbe --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But they could totally\nclose it?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: They could totally close the\ndoors, and I think that's different. That is not\nhearing the case, and in closing -- closing the doors of\nthe court evenhandedly to State and Federal cases. That\nis -- that is --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If you leave the door open\nto suits against every other possible defendant except\nrailroads? I mean, it seems to me your hardest case is\nreally the FELA cases here.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: I think the FELA cases, some\nof which were -- some exclusions were upheld and some of\nwhich were struck down, support our position, because\nthey only strike down exclusions of jurisdiction where\nthere is a discrimination, where the Court finds a\ndiscrimination between the Federal and State claim.\nIn Mondou, Connecticut was hearing suits\nagainst railroads under State law. It was even hearing\nsuits against railroads under other States' law that\nimposed -- liability, but it was refusing to hear only\nsuits under Federal law. And that's why the Court\nstruck it down.\nSimilarly, in McKnett and in Testa, in each\ncase this Court struck down in limitation on the\nground -- not that the State had an absolute obligation\nto hear the Federal claim, but that it had an\nobligation, if it was going to exclude jurisdiction, to\nexclude it evenhandedly.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that in Testa\nthe State said we are evenhanded, we don't bring -- we\ndon't allow penal actions to be -- to be brought on the\ncivil side of our court?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: But what -- but what this\nCourt pointed to in Testa was that while they said that,\nthey did, in fact, hear pun -- double damage actions,\nwhich is what this was. It was penal in a sense not of\nbeing a criminal, but as being a double damage -- a\nmultiple damage action.\nAnd what the Court said was because Rhode\nIsland does hear double damage actions arising under its\nown law and under the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act,\nessentially the rational they gave for excluding the\nEmergency Press Control Act had been proven false and\nmust -- unless as the only explanation unwillingness to\nenforce the emergency press control.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So what you have now is you\nhave one reason, I think, would be clearly wrong; I\nthink, I assume that. But if the State closed their\ndoors to this kind of suit because they say we think our\ncorrectional officers should be immune from damages, now\nwe know they can get money under the Federal law, but we\nwant nothing to do with this. That, I think, would be\ndiscrimination against the suit if that were their\nreason.\nNow, there is a neutral reason, and it's\ndemonstrated, and it is, well, you see, there are just\ntoo many -- there are just too many lawsuits by\nprisoners against prison officials. And we don't want\nall that business in that court, and here's how we deal\nwith it.\nOne, we take away their cause of action,\nthat's what we do under State law, and then we -- the\nfeds -- we throw them back to Fed court? Without --\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Or -- or we offer them a\ncourt of claims.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You don't offer them a\ncourt of claims, because what you offer in the court of\nclaims is an action against the State. And you can say\nthat isn't a big deal because after all, most of these\nreally are actions against the State anyway, because\nthey get compensated.\nOkay, so if I treat that as neutral, I have\none bad reason and one good reason. And how do I know\nwhich is which? That is, is it really true that there\nare a lot of suits brought in State courts in places\nwith prisons under 1983 for damages rather than Federal\ncourts? I don't know what the numbers are? Have you\nlooked them up at all?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Well, they aren't -- this is\nwhat I can tell you. I think 1983, they are -- I mean,\nsuits against --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- 1983 actions, but maybe\nthey bring them mostly in Federal court.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: They do bring them in\nFederal court.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So one way to test\nthis out would be the following: If we had numbers and\nknew, you know, about how many State -- how many damage\nactions against prisoners were being brought in State\ncourts in districts that have prisons there, and then we\nsaw how much New York was really hurting and then we\nasked another question, maybe there is some Federal\nsecurity actions, you see, where there is no State\ncomparable action and we found out, well, the State lets\nthem bring these actions in State court. So, there are\nways of dealing with this empirically. Have you any\nsense of it?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Well, what I can tell you is\nthat there are a great many State law -- I can't tell\nyou numbers -- a great many State law actions against\ncorrections officers. They are either in the court of\nclaims or they are in Federal court because this statute\nsays that the courts have no jurisdiction over the\ndamage actions, and it doesn't matter whether they are\n1983 or state law. But there are a great many -- I\nmean, it says to -- read them.\nThe State law actions -- there are many\nstate law actions that can't be constitutionally\ncharacterized. There is all kinds of, you know,\ndamaging loss to property, medical malpractice,\nnegligence, failure to protect from harm, things that --\nmany things that the prisoners bring suits against that\nare not constitutional. They aren't in the Supreme\nCourt. They would be if you struck this statute down.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It's not really that they\nare not the Supreme Court, but the -- the damages are\nlimited, aren't they, because in the court of claims, as\nI understand it or under the statute, there can't be any\npunitive damages? Whereas if it were a straight 1983\naction in the State supreme court, punitive damages\nwould -- would be a possibility.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Well, there are two things\nto say about punitive damages. One is that, yes --\nthere are three things -- there are no punitive damages\nin the court of claims. Punitive damages, of course,\nare available in Federal court, which is fully available\nto these plaintiffs and is where they normally are if\nthey think they have a punitive damage claim.\nIt is also case that actions outside the\nscope of employment are not covered by this statute.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: They could be brought into\nthe state supreme court --\nMS. UNDERWOOD: They could be brought into\nthe state court.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- which is a -- which is\none of your jurisdictional problems because the --\nthe -- in effect, New York is saying the most -- the\nmost egregious class of cases, the cases in which the\ncorrectional officers are not only doing some actionable\nbut something outside the scope of their duty, well, we\nwill hear them, they are fine. And we will provide\npunitive damages for them.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Well --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Which -- which makes it a\nlittle tough to say that in the less egregious cases\nthere is a -- that the -- that the exclusion of the less\negregious cases is a jurisdictional exclusion as\ndistinct from an exclusion based upon policy about how\nless egregious cases ought to be handled.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Well, it is a\njurisdiction -- it is framed as jurisdictional, it is\ntreated as jurisdictional. The New York courts say --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but aren't you simply\nsaying, look, we go around calling it jurisdictional.\nAnd -- and my point was, that isn't it difficult, isn't\nit, in fact, inappropriate to call it jurisdictional\nwhen you have a class of the most egregious cases under\n1983 which the State supreme courts hear, and there is,\nnonetheless, a second class of cases, also 1983 -- they\nsimply happen to be less egregious -- that they don't\nhear? Isn't it difficult, using jurisdictional in the\nnormal sense of the term, to say that is a\njurisdictional distinction?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: No, because what the\njurisdictional bar is for damage actions against\ncorrectional officers where actions is the scope of\ntheir employment -- and the New York courts don't just\nsay it's jurisdictional. They give it the effect of a\njurisdictional bar.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What if the New York\nlegislature passed a statute saying the -- the State\ncourt supreme court will not have jurisdiction over 1983\nactions for -- for harm committed on Wednesday, would\nyou say that that was a jurisdictional rule?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: I think --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I will answer the question\nfor you, if you want.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: I think it would be hard\nto --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You wouldn't have.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: -- to find a rationale for\nit.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Even if it were, it would\nbe discriminatory and invalid, right?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: I was going to say, I don't\nthink that its flaw is that it's not juris -- it's\njurisdictional. The flaw is it's irrational.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Or discriminatory. It's\npicking on --\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Or as between -- as between\nplaces, yes. But --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Would you say it was\njurisdictional so long as the Supreme Court said -- or\nso long as the State legislature said, no State or\nFederal actions for -- for -- for Wednesday damages?\nWould you call that jurisdictional?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: I would call it very\nstrange.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You might call it crazy\noutside of court, but the one thing you wouldn't do is\nwalk in a court and say it's jurisdictional.\nAnd the -- my -- the point I am getting at\nis, the finer the comb that -- that -- that keeps the\ncertain class of case out, the less plausible it is to\nsay that this is a jurisdictional kind of criterion\nsense of it?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Well, what I can tell you is\nthat there are a great many State-law -- I can't tell\nyou the numbers. There are a great many State-law\nactions against corrections officers.\nThey are either in the Court of Claims, or\nthey are in Federal courts because this statute says\nthat the courts have no jurisdiction over the damage\nactions. And it doesn't matter whether they are 1983 or\nState law. But there are a great many -- I mean it\nsays, to read them, that State-law actions -- there are\nmany State-law actions that can't be constitutionally\ncharacterized.\nThere is all kinds of, you know, damage and\nloss to property, medical malpractice, negligence,\nfailure to protect from harm, things that -- many things\nthat the prisoners bring suits against that are not\nconstitutional. They aren't in the Supreme Court. They\nwould be if you struck the statute down.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It's not really that they\nare in the Supreme Court, but the -- the damages are\nlimited, aren't they? Because in the Court of Claims,\nas I understand it, or under the statute, there can't be\nany punitive damages; whereas, if it were a straight\n1983 action in the State supreme court, punitive damages\nwould -- would be a possibility.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Well, there are two things\nto say about punitive damages: One is that, yes, that\n-- there are three things. There are no punitive\ndamages in the Court of Claims. Punitive damages are,\nof course, available in Federal court, which is fully\navailable to these plaintiffs and is where they normally\nare, especially if they think they have a punitive-\ndamage claim.\nIt is also the case that actions outside the\nscope of employment are not covered by this statute.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, they could be brought\ninto the State supreme court.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: They could be brought into\nthe State supreme court.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Which is one of your\njurisdictional problems because the -- the -- in effect,\nNew York is saying the -- the most -- the most egregious\nclass of cases, the cases in which the correctional\nofficers are not only doing something actionable but\nsomething that is either outside the scope of their\nduty, but we will hear them. They are fine, and we will\nprovide punitive damages for them.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Well, I think the rationale\nfor that --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Which makes it a little\ntough to say that in the less egregious cases there is a\n-- that the -- that the exclusion of the lesser cases is\na jurisdictional exclusion as -- as distinct from a --\nan exclusion based upon policy about how less egregious\ncases ought to be handled.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Well, it is a jurisdictional\n-- it is framed as jurisdictional, and it is treated as\njurisdictional. The New York courts say --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but aren't you simply\nsaying: Look, we go around calling it jurisdictional.\nAnd -- and my point was that isn't it difficult -- isn't\nit, in fact, inappropriate to call it jurisdictional\nwhen you have a class of the most egregious cases under\n1983 which the State supreme courts hear. And there is,\nnonetheless, a second class of cases, also 1983, that\nsimply happen to be less egregious that they won't hear.\nIsn't it difficult, using \"jurisdictional\" in the normal\nsense of the term, to say that is a jurisdictional\ndistinction?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: No, because what the\njurisdictional bar is for damage actions against\ncorrections officers who are acting in the scope of\ntheir employment. And the New York courts don't just\nsay it's jurisdictional. They give it the effect of the\njurisdictional bar.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: When has the New York\nlegislature passed a statute saying that the -- the new\n-- the State supreme court will not have jurisdiction\nover 1983 actions for -- for harm committed on\nWednesday? Would you say that that was a jurisdictional\nrule?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: I think -- I think --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I will answer the question\nfor you, if you want. You -- you wouldn't have --\nMS. UNDERWOOD: I am just trying to find a\nrationale for it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Even if it were, it would\nbe discriminatory and invalid, right?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: I was going to say I don't\nthink that its flaw is that it's not -- it's\njurisdictional. The flaw is that it's irrational.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Or discriminatory.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Or discriminatory, yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Would you say it was\njurisdictional so long as the -- the Supreme Court said\n-- so long as the State Legislature said no -- no state\nor Federal actions for -- for Wednesday damages? Would\nyou call that \"jurisdictional\"?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: I would call it very strange\njurisdictional --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You might call it crazy\noutside of court, but the one thing you wouldn't do is\nwalk into a court and say it's jurisdictional. And my\n-- the -- the point that I am getting at is: The finer\nthe comb that -- that keeps the certain class of case\nout, the less plausible it is to say that this is a\njurisdictional kind of criterion at work here.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Well, in --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And that's what I -- that's\nwhy I keep getting at the point that when -- when you\nlay in some 1983 actions, the worst ones, the ones with\nthe highest potential damages, but you say, well, the --\nthe less awful ones, the ones that may be within scope\nof employment, they can't come in, it seems to me that\nthe -- that the teeth on the comb are getting rather\nfine. And in terms of our normal usage in -- in\napplying this criterion, it -- it is not plausibly\njurisdictional.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Well, unlike the Wednesday\ncase, our -- our statute is rational, because it takes\nout of the courts of general jurisdiction the cases that\nare most numerous and that are most appropriately\nindemnified by the State. But it leaves in the courts\nof general jurisdiction the ones that are less numerous\nand that are not appropriately indemnified or turned\ninto actions against the State. So it's rational unlike\nthe Wednesday cases.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: One of the concerns I have\nin this case is the scope of employment is often\nlitigated, and it would seem to me that the State of New\nYork might routinely say, oh, this is not within the\nscope of employment.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Well, there is a body of\ncases that are quite generous --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Which -- which means that\nthis is a very difficult distinction and is a further\nburden on the 1983 ride.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: The law of the State of New\nYork is relatively clear on this. The kinds of cases\nthat are outside the scope of employment are prisoner\nrapes and things that are done by corrections officers\nthat do not in any way further the -- the objective.\nThey are simply --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I think that's a rather\nroutine defense. But why are they -- why are they left\nin the supreme court?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Because they are not\nappropriately -- because the State doesn't want to take\nresponsibility -- when the State statute takes them from\nthe supreme court, then actions on such matters can be\nbrought against the State in the court of claims. And\nthe state is not taking responsibility for those cases\nand will not indemnify them.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: When was this statute\nfirst enacted?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Well, the statute was first\nenacted in -- in about 1947, or so.\nJUSTICE: And then you say they were not --\nthat 1982 is on the books, but, gee, it wasn't -- it\nwasn't --\nMS. UNDERWOOD: It was not -- it was nothing\n--\nJUSTICE: It pretty clearly was not aimed at\ndefeating Federal actions.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Correct. It was not aimed\nat defeating Federal actions. It was aimed at just --\nat -- at managing the --\nJUSTICE: It had not even been held then\nthat State Farm was available for 1983 actions.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: That's correct.\nJUSTICE: Yes.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: That's correct.\nJUSTICE: Can I -\nMS. UNDERWOOD: The rise of Federal 1983\nactions came subsequently and -- and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That -- that's an important\nfactor, I would think. Let me ask another question. It\n-- it's a standard rule of international law that no\nState will enforce the penal laws of another State. I\nassume the Federal Government could not -- maybe I am\nwrong to assert this, but could the Federal Government\nrequire New York to prosecute federal crimes?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: I don't know the answer to\nthat.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't, either, but I\nthink it can't. I think it can't, probably. Then my\nnext question is going to be: Why aren't punitive\ndamages penal laws as well? And if that's the same\nprinciple, maybe there's no big deal about New York\nexcluding penal damages --\nMS. UNDERWOOD: There may be, but there is\nno --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: 1983 does not -- correct\nme if I am wrong -- does not allow punitive damages\nagainst a State, does it?\nMS. UNDERWOOD: 1983 does not allow any\nliability. 1983 has been construed not -- the State\nisn't a person; it can't be a defendant.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Not -- if I got that\nright, not in Monell.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: The State in Monell --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Even in Monell -- even in\nMonell there is no punitive damages against the State,\nwhich is another reason you -- you were discriminating\nagainst the employee here -- against the prisoner.\nBecause the prisoner could get punitive damages against\nthe correctional officer but not against the State in\neither court.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Where he can -- where he can\nbring his 1983 action, he can get punitive damages. The\nState has closed its door to damage actions, 1983 or\notherwise.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In neither court can you\nget -- and correct me if I am wrong -- punitive damages\nagainst the State, which never --\nMS. UNDERWOOD: He can get damages -- under\n1983 he can get damages against --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: He can under Monell.\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Not against -- no, not --\nnot against the State.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: In county --\nMS. UNDERWOOD: Yes. In fact, what I was\ngoing to say is that one of the things that shows there\nis no congressional policy focused only on individuals\nis that municipalities and other government entities are\nproper defendants. The State is not. Likely, the\ngovernment -- the Federal policy was -- found by this\nCourt in construing 1983 for not making the State a\ndefendant was not that that would undermine deterrent\nand that it was preferable to sue individuals, but that\nthere was some reluctance -- concern about power or\nwisdom of -- of imposing liability on the States.\nAnd, in fact, that is what this Court said\nin Monell and Will about why the State is not a person.\nSo I don't think 1983 is fairly read as embracing a\ncongressional judgment that it's better to have\nliability against individuals, better from the\nplaintiffs' point of view, than against the State.\nBut the way this works is it is, in effect,\na mandatory removal. And since Congress has no\nobjection and has not prohibited removal the way it did\nin FELA cases, it's hard to see how the congressional\npolicy is frustrated by this mandatory removal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.\nMr. Murtagh, you have four minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JASON E. MURTAGH\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. MURTAGH: Mr. Chief Justice, just very\nbriefly, General Underwood just mentioned that -- that\nthis could be analyzed as a mandatory removal statute.\nBut the distinction, Your Honors, is that what New York\nState does when it removes these cases to Federal court\nis it uses an avenue that is provided by Congress. And,\ncertainly, if Congress wants to provide for removal to\nFederal court, Congress can do that.\nWhat the State cannot do is come in and\ninterpose its policy judgment over and above what\nCongress has decided with respect to Federal claims.\nVery quickly, I would like to address the\nsecond point. General Underwood pointed out that there\nare a lot of large prisons in rural counties in New York\nState; and, therefore, there are a lot of cases that\nmight be brought in those courts. There is no dispute\nin this case, Your Honors, that if New York wanted to\nhave a statute that said those cases will be transferred\nto the less busy courts of our State, that would be\nokay. That would be a neutral rule of judicial\nadministration related to the operation of the courts\nthat is unrelated to the substance or the identity of\nthe parties.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In that same act they\nmight rescind the -- the laws allowing the State to\nrespond in damages, in which case you won't obtain very\nmuch.\nMR. MURTAGH: Well -- well, Your Honor, my\nclient can't bring his Section 1983 claim in any State\ncourt because he can't bring it against the employees,\nbecause Correctional Law Section 24 keeps him out of the\nsupreme court. And he can't sue the you State in the\ncourt of claims because in Will v. Michigan this Court\nsaid the State is not a person. So he simply cannot\nbring his Federal action in any State court if he wants\nmoney damages.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I find it hard to regard\nthis as a non-neutral law when it was put on the books\nbefore there were any of these 1983 actions.\nMR. MURTAGH: Well, Justice Scalia, the --\nthe very first iteration of this law was in 1947. The\nlaw was actually amended -- and it is discussed in -- in\nthe joint appendix and there is some in the beginning of\nour brief -- in the early 1970's after there were a\nsignificant number of -- of Section 1983 claims that had\nbegun to be filed.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Was there any substantive\nchange from what the original enactment to the amendment\n-- the one that's currently enforced?\nMR. MURTAGH: Justice Ginsburg, I don't\nrecall whether there were any. We actually researched\nthe legislative history and had a bit of difficulty\ngoing back that far. I don't recall whether there were\na lot of substantive changes or not, quite honestly.\nThis is a statute, though, that the -- that\nthe New York Legislature has -- has dealt with over the\nyears.\nOne of the important things is that in the\n1970's -- and I apologize for not having the exact date\n-- the New York Legislature said that the purpose of\nthis was to provide immunity to corrections officials.\nAnd as we pointed out in our briefing, there is a bill\ncurrently pending before the New York Legislature that\nsays we want to extend the same immunity that we provide\nto prison officials to employees of the Office of --\nJUSTICE BREYER: They are saying -- they are\nalso saying there is a neutral reason. The neutral\nreason is the State sees there are just too many cases\nin which prisoners are suing correctional officials.\nSo then they say: Here's what we are going\nto do about it. First, under State law, we will wipe\nout all the suits and give them instead an action\nagainst the State. But we know there are still some\nFederal cases about the same thing. So what we are\ngoing to do is we are going to say bring them in Federal\ncourt. Why bring them in State court? So now we've\ndealt with our administrative problem.\nSo that's their neutral administrative\nreason. Now, people would like to bring 1983 actions\nstill in State or Federal court. It may be more\nconvenient. They get attorneys' fees, and the\nattorneys' fees you don't get under the State law. So\nwhy isn't -- or why is -- I guess that's the question\nfor me: Is this an adequate, neutral, administrative\nreason or not?\nMR. MURTAGH: No, Justice Breyer. The --\nthe reason that is given in this particular case, if you\n-- if you go through the Respondent's briefing, the\nreason that is given is that there -- is that this\nstatute exists because there are lots of frivolous,\nvexatious lawsuits.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, forget all of the\ncharacterizations. If we could look into the motive,\nmaybe we would have a different view. But all we have\nis the statute on the books. And, as in many cases, the\npeople who are charged with defending those statutes\nthink of very good reasons which are very plausible that\ncould have motivated the people involved, and they have\ncome up with the one that you have heard. Now, what's\n-- what's wrong with that one?\nMR. MURTAGH: And I'm sorry, Justice Breyer.\nThe reason?\nJUSTICE BREYER: The reason is, you see,\nthere are so many cases in which the person is suing --\nthe prisoner is suing the prison official that our\ncourts are clogged. So what we are going to do is:\nOne, give the prisoners a good remedy under State law in\na different court; and, two, close our doors to the\ncomparable Federal case.\nMR. MURTAGH: Justice Breyer, the answer is\nthat the State can certainly do that with respect to the\nState-law claims.\nWhat it can't do is try to shuttle Federal\nclaims off to the Federal courts and close its doors for\na hearing on similar State claims.\nYour Honors, thank you for your time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
