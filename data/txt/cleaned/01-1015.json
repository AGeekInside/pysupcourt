Secret\nCatalogue, Inc.\nMr. Higgins.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES R. HIGGINS, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. HIGGINS: Mr. Chief Justice and may it\nplease the Court, counsel:\nWe are here today to obtain a construction of\nthe Federal Trademark Dilution Act, FTDA, that will keep\nFederal trademark law in its proper bounds. We submit\nthat can be accomplished by choosing objective proof over\nsupposition and inference to guide future FTDA cases.\nThis case from the Sixth Circuit involves a non-identical,\nnon-confusing trademark operating in the remote reaches of\nthe economy that was nevertheless enjoined under the FTDA,\nand demonstrates the dangers of an unchecked FTDA.\nQUESTION: You mean Tennessee is remote, or this\nparticular business is?\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Kentucky.\nMR. HIGGINS: Your Honor, this case actually\ncame from Kentucky, and --\nQUESTION: Oh, well, Kentucky --\nMR. HIGGINS: -- I suppose that's even more\nremote than Tennessee in some cases.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Was there a Victoria's Secret in this\ntown?\nMR. HIGGINS: There was not at the beginning of\nthis case. The closest one was 60 miles away.\nWe say that the result --\nQUESTION: In Tennessee?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. HIGGINS: We say that the result below is\ncontrary to the actual words that Congress used in the\nFTDA, namely the plain words, causes dilution. If this\nresult stands, the FTDA threatens to usher in an\nanti-competitive expansion of trademark law into patent-\nlike realm.\nPerhaps the best example of that is the Second\nCircuit's Nabisco decision, urged in part here by\nrespondents, which involved a goldfish-shaped cracker, and\nit -- the court there applied the FTDA to grant\nexclusionary rights in an unpatented, uncopyrighted design\nof a product to enjoin a product that they said diluted.\nThat is contrary to this Court's two most recent decisions\ninvolving Federal trademark law, the Wal-Mart decision and\nthe TrafFix Devices decision.\nQUESTION: Before you -- just would you spend\none minute -- it would help me a lot if you explained to\nme what dilution is, and I'll be specific. It seems to me\nwhat you have here is a case of what's called tarnishment,\nand what tarnishment -- what I think of is this, is it\nlike this, that -- that -- imagine some small shop wants\nto start a bug spray business. It's a funny example, but\nit comes from an actual case, and they decide to call\nthemselves Bugwiser Bug Spray, and their slogan is, Where\nthere's life, there's bugs, all right.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Now, Budweiser is not going to enter\nthe bug spray business.\nis the source of the bug spray, but Budweiser has an\ninterest because the people who see this ad are going to\nthink Budweiser, yuck, and they don't want people to think\nthat. Now, is dilution encompassed? Does dilution\nencompass that, and my reason for thinking maybe it\ndoesn't is, the words of the statute refer to\ndistinctiveness of mark. They don't refer to tarnishment.\nBut -- is it -- so I want some explanation of what\ndilution here refers to.\nMR. HIGGINS: There's a lot of people who want\nexplanation of what dilution is, and their tarnishment\naspect of dilution is part of the legislative history. It\nis not expressed in the words that Congress used to define\ndilution. Congress defined dilution as the lessening of\nthe capacity of a famous mark to identify and distinguish\nthe goods or services to which the famous mark --\nQUESTION: But you believe --\nQUESTION: Which wouldn't include tarnishment.\nWhich wouldn't include tarnishment. I mean, it can still\nidentify Budweiser beer very, very well.\nMR. HIGGINS: Well, it could identify Budweiser\nbeer, but the -- the -- our point about this case is that\nthere needs to be objective evidence that consumers, in\nfact, identify the accused mark with the famous mark. In\nother words, we say that section 43(c)(1) of the FTDA in\nits words causes dilution, imposes a causal connection\nbetween the accused mark and the beneficiary.\nQUESTION: All right, excuse me, before you go\nback to cause, which is your main point which I want to\nhear, I do -- I'm assuming now that for purposes of this\ncase anyway, you concede that tarnishment is part. If you\ndon't concede that, or even if you do, will you please\nexplain as well what this -- what it is, what the injury\nis where you're talking about a lessening of capacity to\nidentify and distinguish, what injury is that, if it is\nnot tarnishment?\nMR. HIGGINS: Okay. The injury in a dilution\ncase is focused, the courts agree, on the selling power of\nthe famous mark and the way that the cases go is that\neveryone agrees that that selling power is the hook that\nthe famous mark --\nQUESTION: Okay, then please explain, putting\ntarnishment to the side -- there is no tarnishment,\nassume -- how does the fact that you have a tiny, totally\nseparate product with the same name ever, ever hurt the\nselling power of the big famous name?\nMR. HIGGINS: The question becomes, again, one\nof consumer perception. All of that is tied up into the\ngist of the FTDA. What is being protected is the selling\npower of the famous mark -- which the Fourth Circuit in\nRingling Brothers referred to as the economic value of a\ntrademark -- and I would agree with you, Justice Breyer,\nthat if there is no injury there should be --\nQUESTION: No, I don't understand conceptually\nhow there ever could be an injury. I've got to understand\nthat first, and the reason is, I can imagine an injury\nthrough tarnishment. I can imagine an injury where the\nbig product, Kodak, intends to enter the small area, the\nKodak -- whatever, monkey wrench -- and it is intending to\nenter and draw on the selling power of, everyone thinks\nKodak is good, so I can think of those two things, but\nwhere they don't intend to enter, where there's no\ntarnishment, what, in principle, is the harm that you say\nwe have to show really exists? Unless I know what that is\nin principle, I can't tell if you're right.\nMR. HIGGINS: It -- it would show whether or not\nconsumers would now identify a single mark with two\ndifferent sources, and -- and that is the essence of what\ntrademark dilution by the circuit court --\nQUESTION: All right, and that is harmed\nbecause?\nMR. HIGGINS: The theory is -- with which we\ndon't totally agree -- the theory is that consumers are\nused to seeing only one Kodak, and now they see two, and\nthe theory is that that is the -- among a number of\nmetaphors, that is the first of a thousand cuts that will\nlead to harm.\nNow, our difficulty with that is that not every,\neven identical use of the same trademark ultimately leads\nto the dilution --\nQUESTION: Well, do you say that actual\nconfusion is relevant to the dilution analysis?\nMR. HIGGINS: Actual confusion is primarily a --\na Lanham Act infringement concept.\nQUESTION: So it's not, in your view, relevant\nto the dilution?\nMR. HIGGINS: If there were actual confusion, it\nmight be relevant, but this case --\nQUESTION: In this case, the other -- the Lanham\nAct was thrown out, in effect.\nMR. HIGGINS: That's the main point of this\ncase, is that the Court has ruled as a matter of law that\nthese accused marks by our clients are not going to lead\nto confusion. It is --\nQUESTION: And you say that actual confusion\ndoesn't matter, then, for purposes of this statute, the\ndilution statute, or it could?\nMR. HIGGINS: I say that it could in some\ncircumstances. It's not involved in this case at all.\nQUESTION: All right, now --\nQUESTION: You -- you -- go ahead.\nQUESTION: Then what about actual economic harm?\nIs that a requirement, in your view, under this statute --\nMR. HIGGINS: We think that --\nQUESTION: -- for the plaintiff?\nMR. HIGGINS: We think that the plaintiff in a\ndilution case needs to show objective proof of dilution,\nand that necessarily has an economic component with it.\nQUESTION: Well, but the statute does not, in\ndefining dilution, speak in terms of economic harm, does\nit?\nMR. HIGGINS: The statute does not mention\neconomic harm per se, but it does say, the lessening of\nthe capacity of the famous mark to identify and\ndistinguish and, focusing on the selling power of the\nmark, we say the best evidence that would be adduced in a\ncase of dilution is surveys of consumer perceptions of the\nimpact of --\nQUESTION: That's the best evidence. That's the\nbest evidence, but let's go back to what is -- causes\ndilution? One can distinguish what the Patent and\nTrademark Office does. That is, it considers marks before\nthey're in use, so one might say, oh, the distinction\nbetween causes dilution and likely to cause is, likely,\nyou're looking at the thing before it's ever used. Once\nit's used, you're into the causes territory. That would\nbe a nice clean line to say that all that it means, all\nthat the difference in phraseology, causes dilution as\nopposed to likely to cause, is, did it have -- a causation\ncase, you have to have a junior mark that's in use, so why\nisn't that a satisfactory line between what's -- what\ncauses dilution as opposed to what is likely to cause\ndilution?\nMR. HIGGINS: We think that is not a completely\nsatisfactory distinction because of the language of the\nstatute that authorizes the Patent and Trademark Office to\nlook at a mark before it begins.\nQUESTION: Yes, well, that's likely to. They\ncan't judge it, because it's not -- it's not in use.\nMR. HIGGINS: And the statute actually says\nthat. Section --\nQUESTION: But I'm asking you, getting out of\nthat territory, it can look at things before they're in\nuse, and now that -- now the junior mark is in use, why\nisn't that enough to satisfy the dilution act?\nMR. HIGGINS: Well, we would agree that the\nmark, the junior mark has to be in use, but we would not\nagree that just by merely using a mark that is\nsemantically similar to the famous mark, that dilution\nwill inevitably result, which is the position of the\nrespondents here.\nQUESTION: But the one thing I think you're\nasking for beyond Justice Ginsburg's example is, to take\nthe Kodak wrench and the Kodak camera, you're asking for\nsome proof that somebody heard the word Kodak and said,\nwas it the camera or the wrench? -- and if that proof\nexists you've got your objective proof, and why do you\nhave to go to the point of saying that -- proving that\nKodak lost a sale as a result?\nMR. HIGGINS: We don't suggest that we have to\nprove that Kodak lost sales.\nQUESTION: But you're -- you're asking for proof\nof some kind of --\nQUESTION: That's the point of this, for\nheaven's sake.\nQUESTION: -- of economic consequence, and --\nMR. HIGGINS: We think --\nQUESTION: -- I -- that's the point that I don't\nsee. If I understand it, the dilution occurs when -- or\nthat dilution is the process of lessening the capacity of\nKodak to identify the camera rather than to identify the\nwrench. If -- if it is shown that that process has\nbegun -- that it is occurring -- why do you -- what is the\npoint of your argument that it has got to be carried\nforward to the point of an economic loss of some sort?\nMR. HIGGINS: Well, first of all we believe that\nconsumer surveys do have evidence of economic impact, and\nwe don't say that economic damage is required. That takes\nour position too far. The actual question that is\ncertified is whether the plaintiff must show objective\nevidence of harm to the economic value of the famous mark,\nnot that it must show economic harm per se.\nI realize that's subtle distinction --\nQUESTION: Well, isn't there -- under the terms\nof the statute, isn't that shown simply by the fact that\nthe consumer stops for a second and says, is it the\ncamera, or is it the wrench when the consumer hears the\nword, Kodak?\nMR. HIGGINS: I don't --\nQUESTION: What further proof of loss of -- what\nfurther economic proof is required to come within the\nstatute?\nMR. HIGGINS: That is not a complete economic\nproof. What we say is that not every, even identical use\nleads to dilution in the minds of consumers. Think of --\nas we put in our brief -- Delta Airlines, Delta Faucets.\nThink of Apple Records, Apple Computers.\nQUESTION: Maybe because those are names that\nare generic, like apple.\nMR. HIGGINS:\nCompany and Ford Modeling Agency? You know, that's the\nsame result.\nQUESTION: How about Kodak Pianos?\nMR. HIGGINS: Kodak Pianos is in the legislative\nhistory as --\nQUESTION: Or Dupont Shoes, or Buick Aspirin?\nMR. HIGGINS: All of those are identical marks,\nand we say that this case presents a non-identical mark.\nThere are semantic differences and there are gender\ndifferences.\nQUESTION: Well, there is evidence -- or, at\nleast, how did this all get started? Someone sees\nVictor's Secret and writes to Victoria's Secret and says,\nyou want to stop these people, so we know that one\nconsumer, although he wasn't confused, said, they're\ndiluting your mark. Now, suppose you had 12 of those who\nsaid, yeah, I passed this shop, Victor's Secret, and I\nthought immediately of Victoria's Secret. Would that\nproof be sufficient and if not, why not?\nMR. HIGGINS: We say it is not sufficient,\nbecause the -- but that is essentially the analysis that\nthe Sixth Circuit put in there. The Sixth Circuit said at\npage 27a of the petition, the appendix to the petition,\nthat they are focusing on what a consumer is, quote,\n\"likely automatically to think,\" unquote, and then link\nthat to the famous mark.\nQUESTION: And what's your answer? What's\nyour --\nMR. HIGGINS: What our position is, that that\nrequires a court to guess whether the association that the\nconsumer thinks of is\nQUESTION: What do you want? What do you want\nin place of that?\nMR. HIGGINS: What we would like --\nQUESTION: What do you want the plaintiff to\nshow?\nMR. HIGGINS: We want the plaintiff to show that\nthere is objective proof of consumer perceptions that it\ncauses dilution, exactly what the statute says.\nQUESTION: I don't know -- what does that mean,\nof consumer perceptions that causes dilution? Objective\nproof that a particular consumer, when he saw Victoria's\nLittle Secret -- or Victor's Little Secret -- had in mind,\ngee, you know, that's like Victoria's Secret. Is that\nenough?\nMR. HIGGINS: No, that's not enough. That's --\nQUESTION: What is enough? What is enough?\nWhat does dilution consist of?\nMR. HIGGINS: Dilution consists of a\nconsumer's -- the -- general consumers, not a single\nconsumer, but general consumer perception that there used\nto be one Victoria's Secret and now, in their minds, there\nare at least two.\nQUESTION: Well, how many consumers do you need?\nYou say one isn't enough , and you say general consumer\nperception. I mean, if you had 20 people would that be\nenough?\nMR. HIGGINS: Well, the -- the record and the\nbriefs reveal some articles by trademark scholars who\ndiscussed --\nQUESTION: Yes, but I was asking you a\nparticular question. Would 20 be enough?\nMR. HIGGINS: I don't think so, Your Honor. You\nknow, this -- we live in an age when consumer surveys,\nvoter surveys, public opinion surveys are done over a\nweekend, and in this situation that is the kind of survey\nthat we would suggest.\nQUESTION: And what do you ask these consumers?\nHow many Kodaks are there? Is that what you want to ask\nthem?\nMR. HIGGINS: No, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: What?\nMR. HIGGINS: You ask them the scientifically\ndesigned question.\nQUESTION: Which is?\nMR. HIGGINS: Which is, you know, do you think\nof another famous mark, and do you believe -- as the law\nreview article suggests -- do you believe such things as\nwhether or not the new entrant had to get permission from\nthe famous mark in order to market this product.\nQUESTION: Well, that -- most consumers wouldn't\neven understand that question.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. HIGGINS: And that's -- that's part of our\npoint, Your Honor. If --\nQUESTION: This sounds like a lawyer's dream.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: But it seems to me that the owner of\nthe senior mark is entitled to more protection than that.\nI -- I just want to make clear, you do not contest that\ntarnishment is a -- a basis for the respondent to prevail\nin this case?\nMR. HIGGINS: We do not.\nQUESTION: All right.\nMR. HIGGINS: As -- per se. What we say is that\nthere is --\nQUESTION: I -- I don't know why you need\nsophisticated, so-called sophisticated polls to determine\nwhether there's tarnishment.\nMR. HIGGINS:\nstatute that is wholly different than the common law. It\nhas no common law antecedent. It is granting property\nrights through Congress' action under the alleged use of\nthe Commerce Clause, and we say those property rights that\nare being granted by this statute create rights that go\nwell beyond any trade area --\nQUESTION: It's not just beyond, I would have\nthought that -- you don't make a point of it, so I might\nbe wrong -- there's a pretty significant speech\ninterest on -- on your side of the case. That is, if this\nstatute gets out of hand, advertising is part of --\nwhether we like it or not -- our children's, anyway, daily\ncommunications, and all of a sudden, if there's no real\nharm you're going to cut off what people can say in\ncommercial contexts.\nNow, you don't make much a point of that, so\ndon't let me put words in your mouth. Explain it to me.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. HIGGINS: We did mention that in our briefs,\nbut the primary people who are positing that position here\nare the amici, who represent the public interest, and the\nmain point about this FTDA is that, other than bumping up\nagainst the First Amendment, there really isn't a public\ninterest that is being expressed or applied here.\nQUESTION:\ninterest in not having some organization like yours simply\ncopy another person's name?\nMR. HIGGINS: Well, we -- if there is that\nsituation, then that would be a case of trademark\ninfringement or copyright infringement. This case does\nnot involve -- this case does not involve --\nQUESTION: No, Congress has gone further here\nand said you can't simply copy someone else's name. Now,\nyou say there's no -- maybe Congress shouldn't have done\nit, maybe it hasn't done it, but to say there's no public\ninterest at all on that side doesn't make much sense to\nme. I mean, you -- you don't come -- your client doesn't\ncome off well in this case.\nMR. HIGGINS: Well, there is a public interest,\nbut that is addressed primarily on the free speech aspect\nof things. We would agree with that. The problem with\nthis case is that it requires courts to speculate whether\nthe beginning of a semantically similar mark is going to\ninevitably lead to dilution, and that's contrary to the\nwords that Congress used.\nQUESTION: You started off saying dilution,\nyou -- to show dilution, you had to show economic harm.\nThat I can understand. You produce evidence that -- of\nsome economic harm. That is now not your position. I\ndon't understand what your position is.\nshowing of economic harm, you know, the -- the mark is\nworth so much less than it was, what precisely do you want\nto show? I truly don't understand.\nMR. HIGGINS: We do say there is an economic\ncomponent, through the proof that we suggest be required\nunder the causal relationship that is necessary, and\nthe -- we don't abandon the economic --\nQUESTION: Okay, fine, what else do you demand?\nWhat is it that you do demand. This --\nMR. HIGGINS: We --\nQUESTION: I don't understand what it is that\nyou do demand. What?\nMR. HIGGINS: We do demand that the plaintiffs\nshow that our mark is harming theirs in a dilution way,\nthat it does lessen the capacity of that mark to identify\nand distinguish its goods or services, and that's best\ndone by consumer surveys.\nYour Honor, if I may reserve the balance of my\ntime.\nQUESTION: Very well. Very well, Mr. Higgins.\nMr. Wallace, we'll hear from you.\nMr. Wallace, our records reflect that this is\nyour 157th argument before the Court in the 34 years you\nhave been an attorney in the Office of the Solicitor\nGeneral.\nrecord of 140 arguments. I understand that you will soon\nretire from Government service, so on behalf of the Court\nI extend to you our appreciation for your many years of\nquality advocacy and dedicated service in the Solicitor's\nOffice -- Solicitor General's Office -- on behalf of the\nUnited States. That doesn't mean we're going to rule in\nyour favor.\n(Laughter.)\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. WALLACE: Thank you very much, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\nWhat constitutes dilution, other than the\nabstraction of the statutory definition perhaps is\nreflected a bit in the examples we've given of consumer\nsurveys that might be used to produce evidence in a case\nof this nature. If consumers were asked what products do\nyou associate with the name Victoria's Secret, and those\nwho were aware of Victor's Little Secret answered it\nsubstantially differently and included items found only in\nthat store and not in Victoria's Secret stores, or what\nattributes do you associate with Victoria's Secret, and\nthose aware of Victor's Secret were more apt to say\ntasteless rather than tasteful, which would -- might be\nthe response from those familiar with Victoria's Secret.\nQUESTION: What if the answer was simply, I'm\nnot sure any more? Would that show that dilution had\noccurred?\nMR. WALLACE: It -- it might. All of these -- I\nmean, we don't take the position that a consumer survey is\nnecessary in order to prove a case in the first place, but\nI think the way a survey would be designed and what the\nanswers would show is illustrative of what constitutes\ndilution.\nQUESTION: But you -- you would get that answer\nfrom a consumer if you asked them about the word, Delta,\nwhat products do you associate with the word, Delta, and\nthe consumer would say, airplanes, or air -- you know, air\ntravel and faucets, and there wouldn't be any dilution\nthere, would there?\nMR. WALLACE: Not unless their -- a conclusion\ncould be drawn based on other factors that --\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. WALLACE: -- a mark had established a\ncertain distinctiveness that is associated only with the\nparticular mark, and now that is being blurred.\nQUESTION: Well, I believe -- are you saying\nthat the Delta example is only good now, and that when the\nperson who made Delta Faucets first came out with a faucet\nthat he called Delta, or Delta Airline -- I don't know who\ncame first -- the chicken or the egg, the airline or the\nfaucet. Whoever had the name first, are you saying that\nwhen somebody used the name Delta that the senior user of\nDelta could have excluded the faucet-maker from -- from\nDelta?\nMR. WALLACE: Only under the Federal dilution\nstatute of '95 if the mark is a famous mark, and in the\nToro case that we cite, the --\nQUESTION: So I can't even have Delta Peanuts?\nOnce Delta is famous, just for air travel, I can't use\nDelta for anything else? That would automatically violate\nthe Federal statute?\nMR. WALLACE: Well, not automatically, but if --\nQUESTION: All you have to do is find a consumer\nwho knows of Delta Peanuts and says, you know, what do you\nassociate the name Delta with, and he says, airlines and\npeanuts?\nMR. WALLACE: Well, that would involve an exact\nreplication of the mark, which are the only examples given\nin the House report or in the legislative history, such as\nKodak Pianos. Most of the cases, however, are about\nsimilar marks rather than exact replications, and those\nare much more problematical to ascertain whether there is\nthe kind of effect we're -- the act is concerned with.\nQUESTION: Mr. Wallace, at least in some of the\ncircuits, I'm not sure in the cases of this Court, correct\nme if I'm wrong, I thought that in trademark infringement\ncases, that the circuit court said that they have certain\nde novo authority. Historical facts are clearly\nerroneous, but the conclusions that you draw from the\nhistorical facts give them certain powers of de novo\nreview. That's the prevailing rule in many of the\ncircuits, is it not --\nMR. WALLACE: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- in infringement cases, and\nshouldn't that same rule be applied here? I mean, judges\nhave the capacity in the trademark area, I should think,\nto know what dilution is or is not if we have certain\nhistorical facts. I don't know why you need to survey.\nThe Bugwiser-Budweiser example. I mean, you don't have to\nbe too tricky a judge to figure out that this is very\nharmful.\nMR. WALLACE: It is very difficult. We don't\nsay that a survey is needed. There are other factors that\nare looked to, including --\nQUESTION: Mr. Wallace, may I ask you something\nto clarify the Government's position on this? As I've\nbeen listening to the argument, Mr. Higgins says you look\nto see, he said, if before you thought there was one\nVictoria's Secret, now you thought there were two. He's\nsuggesting that the association -- it's not what you think\nof when you see Victor's Secret. When you see Victor's\nSecret, of course you're going to think of Victoria's, but\nwhat counts is, when you think of Victoria's Secret, do\nyou think of Victor's. That's -- that's what dilution is,\nand if it's the latter, then it's -- those are two very\ndifferent things, aren't they?\nMR. WALLACE: Yes. Dilution is about dilution\nof the famous mark and its capacity to distinguish the\nparticular goods or services, but we think the court of\nappeals was wrong in saying that mere mental association\nof the two marks by consumers automatically results in\ndilution.\nQUESTION: But the court of appeals was going\non, when you think of Victor's you think of Victoria's.\nI'm asking you, is the right question -- is the necessary\nquestion of the customers -- when you think of Victoria's,\ndo you think of Victor?\nMR. WALLACE: I think the -- the question is not\ndo you think of Victor's, but when you think of\nVictoria's, do you think of more than what Victoria's\nSecret --\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. WALLACE:\nand image. Is their name now associated with a different\ntype of product that may change their renown or cachet\nwith customers.\nQUESTION: Is there -- what is the extra -- I'm\nnot -- if you're finished with that question, I'd like\nto -- which I think there's a lot to. Is -- what is\nparticularly the harm? Is it just that the customer\nthinks -- either customer -- thinks of the other even if\nthere's no specific tarnishment, and there's no general\ntarnishment? That is, people associate Buick with a good\ncar, and we can measure whether that's identical before\nand identical after, and it is, so there's no general\ntarnishment, there's no bug example tarnishment, there's\nnothing but the fact that on Justice Ginsburg's question,\nboth sides say yes.\nNow, is that harm under this statute? Is that\ndilution, or isn't it?\nMR. WALLACE: We don't believe that in itself\nconstitutes dilution if there is none of the damage to the\nability of the mark. The --\nQUESTION: All right, so -- so the ability of\nthe mark consists either of my bug example, or some\ngeneral weakening of the goodness that inheres in the\nname. Anything else?\nMR. WALLACE:\nQUESTION: No, okay --\nMR. WALLACE: I think the Fourth --\nQUESTION: The answer's no.\nMR. WALLACE: The Fourth Circuit case of\nRingling Brothers was very illustrative. People might\nassociate Utah's use of Greatest Snow on Earth with\nRingling Brothers' use of Greatest Show on Earth, but if\nthey keep the two distinct in their minds, even though\nthey recognize that it's a play on the same words, but\nthey think the two trademarks refer to different products\nand services, then there -- no harm is done to Ringling\nBrothers as the Fourth Circuit held, and the Fourth\nCircuit even suggested that perhaps they even benefit from\nhaving people think additionally of their mark. That's a\nquestion on which the Patent and Trademark Office has not\ntaken a view, but the harm has to be that consumers are --\nare diminished in their capacity to recognize the mark\nthat is the famous mark that's being protected.\nQUESTION: That's -- but that's confusion. I\nmean, if -- if there's confusion, you don't need this new\nlaw. I thought that it was the case that if you come out\nwith a Kodak Piano, even if nobody in the world thinks\nthat Kodak, the photography company has anything to do\nwith Kodak Piano, the mark has nonetheless been\ndiminished. Isn't that right?\nMR. WALLACE: That's true, at least when it's an\nidentical mark, or one that's so confusingly similar --\nQUESTION: But that goes to the very point\nyou've just been talking about, and contradicts what\nyou've said. It doesn't matter whether there's any\nconfusion or not, you can't use Kodak.\nMR. WALLACE: There -- there has to be confusion\nas to the mark, rather than as to the source of the\nproduct.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Wallace.\nWe'll hear argument from you now, Mr. Dellinger.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER E. DELLINGER, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. DELLINGER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe question on which the Court granted\ncertiorari was whether the plaintiff must demonstrate that\nit has already suffered economic injury as a precondition\nto any and all relief under the 1996 act. The text of the\nact answers that question, and answers it no. There's\nsimply no such requirement included in the statute.\nQUESTION: Well, it -- I mean, that's to some\nextent a play on words. It depends on what you mean, has\nactually suffered economic injury. What your opposing\ncounsel says now is that all he means by, has actually\nsuffered economic injury, is, has suffered dilution, has\nactually suffered dilution of the mark, which, of course,\nentails economic injury. If the mark is diluted, the mark\nwas worth a lot, and it's now diluted, there's economic\ninjury. Now --\nMR. DELLINGER: Justice Scalia, we agree that\nthe act requires a showing of actual, present dilution,\nand that such a showing was, in fact, made below. What is\ndilution? A number of you have asked that question. It's\nbest understood in light of the fact that this is a very\nnarrow statute that only protects a few very famous marks.\nI do not think, for example, Justice Scalia, that Delta\nwould qualify as a famous mark because it has been used so\noften in other third party uses. The --\nQUESTION: But what about the first time it was\nused either for -- what is it, the airline, and what's --\nfaucets? Whichever came first. What about the first time\nit was used for the second product?\nMR. DELLINGER: Then it would not suffer the\ndisqualification that would come as to what is present --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. DELLINGER: -- about proliferating uses.\nWhether it would otherwise satisfy that would remain to be\nseen. I think that the Court can, and the courts can\nnarrow the application of this statute by taking very\nseriously the requirement that it has to be a truly famous\nmark that has.\nTake the example that was given to the House --\nQUESTION: Well, let's -- and keep it so I can\nunderstand it. Let's assume the first use was Delta\nAirlines. Everybody recognizes Delta Airlines. Somebody\nstarts advertising Delta Faucets. Was Delta Airlines\nfamous enough --\nMR. DELLINGER: I don't know --\nQUESTION: -- on your criterion?\nMR. DELLINGER: -- on those facts. I'd have to\nknow whether, if -- as it is today, yes, I would think if\nit --\nQUESTION: All right. Let's assume it's famous\nenough. The ads start going out in the magazines for\nDelta Faucets. There is no proof that Delta Airlines has\nsuffered any tangible damage at this point, but there is\nproof, let's assume from a survey of magazine readers,\nthat when they see the word, Delta, standing by itself,\nthey're not sure who the source of the product is. Is\nthat dilution?\nMR. DELLINGER: If they're not sure who's the\nsource of the product, it may be infringement, and the\nreason I resist the use of Delta is that a lot goes into a\ndetermination of whether -- as it did in this case -- as\nto whether a mark has those special qualities that mean\nthat the second or junior user and the third, fourth, and\nfifth are lessening its capacity to communicate these very\ndistinctive ideas.\nThe example used in the House report was\nTiffany's, for example. We all know that if another\njewelry store starts as Tiffany's you've got an\ninfringement claim, because consumers would be confused,\nbut as the House was told, what about a Tiffany's\nRestaurant, and that means that Tiffany's used to stand\nfor one thing, it now stands for two, but here's the\nabsolute heart of the matter, where the FDA comes into\nplay.\nQUESTION: That was bad? I mean, you see, I am\nso far behind understanding you that I don't know whether\nyou have just asserted that that's obviously bad. I think\nyou have. Tiffany's Restaurant is bad.\nMR. DELLINGER: Yes.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. DELLINGER: I have, and --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: And the difference between Tiffany's\nRestaurants and Delta Faucets is what?\nMR. DELLINGER: There may be no difference. I'm\nassuming that both -- if you assume that both Delta and\nTiffany's are famous marks.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. DELLINGER: But here's why Delta Faucets and\nTiffany's -- if the original marks are famous -- both\nconstitute the harm of dilution. Dilution --\nQUESTION: You mean, just using the name?\nMR. DELLINGER: Just using the name --\nQUESTION: Is likelihood of dilution enough?\nMR. DELLINGER: No, not under the act, and --\nand nor is just using the name enough, nor is just\nsemantic similarity. You have to make out the statutory\nproof that it actually --\nQUESTION: That it causes dilution for\neverybody --\nMR. DELLINGER: It causes dilution, and\ndilution --\nQUESTION: Is expressed --\nMR. DELLINGER: It's creating a mental\nassociation. Similarity is not enough. But take an\nexample that shows how critically important stopping the\nfirst use is. If you can have a Tiffany's Restaurant,\nthen you can also have a Tiffany Shoe Store, a Tiffany Pet\nStore. Very soon Tiffany's no longer --\nQUESTION: Where will it all end?\nMR. DELLINGER:\n(Laughter.)\nMR. DELLINGER: That is exactly --\nQUESTION: Well, so what? So what? I mean, I\ndon't say so what facetiously. I say so what to get you\nto identify the harm specifically that that's likely to\nbring about to the first owner.\nMR. DELLINGER: Exactly. The -- what Congress\nsaw as the harm, Justice Breyer, for truly famous marks,\nto quote from the House report itself, is that dilution\napplies when the unauthorized use of the famous mark\nreduces the public's perception that the mark signifies\nsomething unique, singular, or particular, so that\nRolls-Royce, which once stood for one thing, once it's on\n100 products or 1,000 products no longer identifies and\ndistinguishes --\nQUESTION: No longer identifies one thing. It\nnow identifies a thousand things, and that, of course, is\ntrue by definition, and what I'm trying to get at is, why\nis that bad?\nMR. DELLINGER: Congress determined that that\nwas bad because --\nQUESTION: Just automatically? Oh, no, go\nahead. Why?\nMR. DELLINGER: Congress determined that that\nwas bad to the extent that the mark no longer stood for\nsomething singular or particular, no longer conveyed --\nQUESTION: Then again, that's just another way\nof repeating the same thing, and the reason that I think\nit's important is, perhaps we can survive with only having\none Tiffany's, but let's think of some slogans out of my\nyouth, you know. It floats. 99 and 44/100th percent\npure. The beforehand lotion, whatever that meant. I'm\njust repeating slogans from old radio programs, and the\nreason that I'm doing it is because I want you to see\nimmediately, as soon as you depart from a word like\nTiffany's, which is totally arbitrary or fanciful, and you\nget into actual advertising slogans, you will tie up free\nspeech in lawsuits like mad, and that's what's worrying\nme.\nMR. DELLINGER: No, I do not -- it is not at all\nthe case. Congress made it clear that safe harbors were\nto extend a wide --\nQUESTION: Yes, the safe harbor is fair use.\nMR. DELLINGER: And it --\nQUESTION: Fair use, and that's what's again\nworrying me, because those two words, fair use to me spell\nlawyers, lawsuits, uncertainty and confusion.\nMR. DELLINGER: If you lose distinctiveness,\nwhat you lose is the selling power of the mark.\nRolls-Royce stands for something important. It conveys\nsomething that consumers -- it signals to consumers.\nRolls-Royce is very careful about what products it\nallows to --\nQUESTION: Chevrolet doesn't matter. You can\nuse Chevrolet, because that's --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Is that right? Or Edsel, even\neasier -- yes.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. DELLINGER: Justice Scalia, it is -- when\nyou look at whether a mark is famous -- and in this case,\nit's simply not contested. This is a mark that comes in\nbehind Levi's and ahead of Rolex on the -- on the list,\nbut when you contest that, you do look at a number of\nfactors, so you can't stand here and pick out any one, and\nthat's a -- that's an important gatekeeping function to\nnarrow this statute.\nNow --\nQUESTION: When you say it signifies something\ndistinctive, you don't mean that Buick signifies cars, you\ndon't mean that Tiffany's signifies jewelry, you don't\nmean that Rolls-Royce signifies sedans, right?\nMR. DELLINGER: Not just that, but a certain\nmark and quality and kind of product is exemplified, and\nthat's what makes a mark famous.\nNow, if -- we know that these marks have value.\nWhen -- when companies are acquired, often as much as\nfour-fifths of the value may go to use that name. That is\nsomething quite valuable, Justice Breyer, and its value is\ngoing to be lost --\nQUESTION: Fine. Why not --\nMR. DELLINGER: -- if there are a thousand\ndifferent ones.\nQUESTION: Why not require some proof of that?\nThat is, some proof that this mark -- which not only\nidentifies a wonderful car, but now has come to stand for\nwonderfulness in general -- some proof that because\nsomebody's using it on a tricycle, that people think it's\na little less wonderful.\nNow, that's not -- that's hard to prove one way\nor the other, but not -- I mean, requires some reason for\nthinking that.\nQUESTION: So Pepsodent would lose, or, you\nknow, just some -- some product --\nMR. DELLINGER: Yes. Yes.\nQUESTION: That's just a -- you know, it's an\nordinary product. How can you have an absolutely\nwonderful toothpaste?\nQUESTION: Oh, no, you can. You can.\nQUESTION:\nright?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. DELLINGER: There is no --\nQUESTION: So we're only talking about\nTiffany's, Rolls-Royce, a couple of other really, really\nquality names. Is that what the statute was directed at?\nMR. DELLINGER: I believe that is the case,\nJustice Scalia, that --\nQUESTION: But you don't differentiate between\nCadillac and Chevrolet, do you? Chevrolet would have just\nmuch cachet --\nMR. DELLINGER: No, I think they would be on\nsimilar footing, and Chevrolet has its own kind of appeal.\nIt appeals to -- for those of us who live in NASCAR\ncountry, there is sometimes a more appealing image to\nChevrolet than to Cadillac. I don't mean to make value\njudgments.\nQUESTION: Well, Mr. Dellinger, why isn't it\nuseful to think in terms of whether there's proof of some\ndiminution of value of the mark?\nMR. DELLINGER: That is a very good question,\nand that is Justice Breyer's question for --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. DELLINGER: We believe that obviously the\nmark does suffer in value if you make out the finding of\ndilution. The Fourth Circuit would require you show\nactual --\nQUESTION: Well, you -- you wouldn't think we\nshould just presume a diminution in value, would you,\nbecause the mark is similar?\nMR. DELLINGER: No, but what you -- what you\npresume is that the economic injury that you're talking of\nmay not be identifiable -- often would not be\nidentifiable -- until it's too late to rectify the harm\nthat has been done. If you think of -- we usually use as\nexamples where there is one other competing user.\nWhat faces the sort of in-house intellectual\nproperty counsel for a company with a famous mark is that\nthere are users popping up all over the country all of the\ntime, so that if the first user, say Victor's Little\nSecret, exists in Elizabethtown, Kentucky, and if you\ncan't show that that alone produces the kind of harm\nyou're looking -- or that your question would imply one\nmight be looking for -- how can you stop the second, the\nthird, the 500th use?\nAt what point -- there's no privilege for the\nfirst user, so that by the -- here's what would happen.\nBy the time you could show economic damage to the harm,\nfirst of all as a matter of law you might have lost the\nstatus as a famous mark because there are all those users\nout there.\nSecondly, the -- it is not clear why you would\nprohibit the 500th user of the mark, the 500th different\nkind of store when you allowed the first 499 to go on, so\nthat -- you ask the question of whether, at present, this\nuse lessens the capacity of that mark to identify and\ndistinguish.\nQUESTION: Focusing on the present, suppose I'm\na trial judge, and this case comes to me in the pretrial\nconference stage, and I say, you know, it does seem to me\nthat this second -- this junior user is going to tarnish\nthe image of -- of the senior user. Is that all I need to\nsay, and then I -- what do I put down when I write an\nopinion so that the circuit court can review my thinking?\nI mean, what -- what do I put down?\nMR. DELLINGER: Well, I think this case is a\nvery good example, because you have a court which goes\nthrough a list of factors to reach a conclusion. The\nopinion is rather short, but that's because the conclusion\nin this case is so close to being a core example of the\nstatute. They -- they mention the fact that it's a very\ndistinctive mark, the degree of similarity, the proximity\nof the product lines helping to create that association,\nthe shared customers -- 39,000 catalogues distributed in\nElizabethtown.\nQUESTION: 39,000 in Elizabethtown?\nMR. DELLINGER: Yes. There are 39,000\nVictoria's Secret catalogues distributed in Elizabethtown,\nKentucky in 1998.\nQUESTION: What's the population of\nElizabethtown?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. DELLINGER: That is a good question, but\nI -- four, he says, but I think that's his guess. We\ndon't know. I --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. DELLINGER: I -- I -- think it is\nsubstantial. Now, once you have these other uses out\nthere, particularly if it's a --\nQUESTION: So what do I -- would this be\nappropriate for a summary -- would you urge me to take\nthis on summary judgment? I --\nMR. DELLINGER: Absolutely, just as I think you\ncould, Justice Kennedy --\nQUESTION: All I need to know is the number of\ncatalogues, how well-known the mark is, and that's it?\nMR. DELLINGER: What you have to --\nQUESTION: And then my own judgment as to what\ntarnishment is?\nMR. DELLINGER:\nhere you have an actual association. What you have in\nthis case, for example, that the judge relies upon, is not\na survey. It's proved by actual consumers.\nQUESTION: Well, but suppose right here, to take\nthis case, that the people who go to Victor's who have\never heard of it honestly do not believe the less in any\nrespect whatsoever of Victoria's Little Secret, and the\npeople who use Victoria's Little -- I mean, why should\nthey? -- and the people who use -- go to Victoria's Little\nSecret have never heard of Victor's, so you -- why -- why\nsuppose they come in and show that?\nQUESTION: You're confusing the marks.\nQUESTION: Now, why -- I understand you're\nconfusing the marks. No, you're not confusing the marks.\nNo. I'm -- he's saying I'm confusing the marks.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: But I -- did I have it backwards?\nQUESTION: Yes, you did.\nQUESTION: Not Little -- all right. The people\nwho go -- no, the customers of Victor's do associate\nVictor's with Victoria, but they think nonetheless of\nVictoria. They might even think more of Victoria. I\ndon't know what they think, but it's not negative in any\nrespect, and the people who go to Victoria's, to use\nJustice Ginsburg's example, don't care, or don't know, or\nthey've never heard of Victor's, so although there is --\nin a subset of people -- an association of the name, there\nis no harm of any sort whatsoever, and they will prove\nthat. Should they not have the opportunity to prove it?\nMR. DELLINGER: Justice Breyer, Congress simply\ndid not agree that no harm has been done when the famous\nmark loses its singularity, and remember, if there can be\none store under Victoria's -- under Victor's Little Secret\nin Elizabethtown, Kentucky, there can be a thousand\nopening the Monday after Superbowl Sunday.\nQUESTION: So then in your view, anyone who\nstarts going around for a commercial reason and using the\ntwo words, it floats -- it floats -- where they want\npeople to think of Ivory Soap, they are open to a lawsuit,\nand they have to rely on a fair use defense, or are there\nother defenses?\nMR. DELLINGER: The --\nQUESTION: Is my example wrong?\nMR. DELLINGER: Well, it's -- your example is\nthat there is a -- you're suggesting a mere mental\nassociation. I'm not sure your --\nQUESTION: Well, in a commercial context -- in a\ncommercial context where people are polled --\nMR. DELLINGER: Secondly, I am not -- by no\nmeans -- it would take a lot to persuade me that it floats\nis a truly famous mark deserving of this protection, but\nCongress believed that the harm is that if you have a\nmark, and Congress identified marks like Buick Aspirin,\nbut if you -- the very harm Congress sought to prevent is,\nwhen a mark stands for one thing -- this narrow set of\ntruly famous marks -- and you have replicating uses, it is\nno longer going to stand for anything in your mind, and\nCongress believed, and the market reflects, that that is a\ntrue loss.\nNow, if you wait to try to -- to where you could\nshow, as the Fourth Circuit would require, an actual\nrevenue loss, you can't unring the bell, particularly with\ntarnishment. If someone opened up --\nQUESTION: Mr. Dellinger, can I just clarify,\nthen, it doesn't make any difference that this particular\nshop happens to sell sex toys. It could just as well --\nVictor's Secret could sell men's underwear and your\nargument would still be the same, am I right? So we get\nout the tawdriness or the disparagement or the\ntarnishment. It's just -- it's a store, it sells\nunderwear, men's underwear, and it's got the label,\nVictor's Secret.\nMR. DELLINGER: Justice Ginsburg, I don't\nentirely agree with that. We do believe that the dilution\nof the Victoria's Secret name through blurring would be\nsufficient, but in this case, you don't have to rely upon\nthat, because the court below did find that there was\ntarnishment when a name not only ceases to stand for one\nthing, but is associated --\nQUESTION: But how does tarnishment fit the\nlanguage of the statute? That's what --\nQUESTION: Yes, I'd like to know that, too. I\ndon't see how tarnishment -- you know --\nQUESTION: Does that lessen the capacity of the\nmark to identify --\nMR. DELLINGER: Yes, it does, and the --\nQUESTION: I thought it just changed the\nreaction to the mark, rather than lessening -- I mean, you\nknow, you have an unfavorable reaction, rather than not\nknowing what you're talking about.\nMR. DELLINGER: Let me just quote you from the\ntreatise, one sentence from the McCarthy treatise. One of\nthe classic functions of a trademark is to signify that\nall goods and services sold under the mark are of equal\nquality, or of a special quality. That is part of\nidentifying and distinguishing a mark. It -- the capacity\nis lessened. It lessens the capacity to identify and\ndistinguish a particular mark when that mark is tarnished\nby what the trial court found some customers would find to\nbe an unsavory association.\nQUESTION: I don't understand -- you can say it,\nbut I don't understand it. I can still identify and\ndistinguish Victoria's Secret, but I just think less of\nit.\nMR. DELLINGER: Well, --\nQUESTION: It -- it doesn't -- any -- it isn't\nany less identifiable.\nMR. DELLINGER: Justice Scalia, I think you're\nmisstating the statute.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. DELLINGER: It's not whether you can\nidentify and distinguish. It's whether the mark's --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. DELLINGER: -- capacity to identify and\ndistinguish is lessened, and if it no longer stands in\none's mind --\nQUESTION: I'll take that.\nMR. DELLINGER: If it no longer stands in one's\nmind, or in the mind and the public perception for the\nsame connotation of quality as it did before the\nassociation with the unsavory image, its capacity to\nidentify and distinguish that quality has lessened, but\nmoreover --\nQUESTION: But you have to add the word quality\nto the statute.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nQUESTION: The statute doesn't contain that\nword.\nMR. DELLINGER: The statute uses dilution,\nJustice Stevens, as a term of art, and nothing could be\nclearer than that Congress thought that term of art,\ndilution, encompassed both blurring and tarnishment, as I\nthink --\nQUESTION: Well --\nMR. DELLINGER: I may not persuade Justice\nScalia --\nQUESTION: Nothing could be clearer than that\nCongress adopted a definition of what -- of what dilution\nconsists of and, to my mind, that definition does not at\nall cover disparaging the other product.\nMR. DELLINGER: Well, it -- Congress thought\notherwise. The House report says that the definition --\nQUESTION: The House committee thought\notherwise.\nMR. DELLINGER: Yes.\nQUESTION: What Congress thought was the\ndefinition that Congress adopted.\nMR. DELLINGER: And the definition of lessening\nthe capacity encompasses that, but in any event, since\nblurring is still present, this is thought to be an easy\ncase by the courts below, for -- for good reason. If you\nimagine hundreds of different users of the Victor's Little\nSecret mark, the uniqueness, the quality, the public's\nperception is going to be lessened.\nCongress further -- to go back to a question\nasked by Justice Breyer -- made it absolutely clear that\nit wanted the safe harbors read as broadly as possible to\nensure that there was no restriction on First Amendment\nrights, so the courts are warmly invited to create as\nlarge a safe harbor for parody. This is a case in which\nwe have blurring, we have tarnishment, which is a near\nsubset of blurring, but the courts below looked at the\ndirect customer testimony.\nColonel Baker, the Judge Advocate -- Staff Judge\nAdvocate at Fort Knox -- looks at a Victor's Little Secret\nad in the base newspaper and writes off to Victoria's\nSecret and says, they're using your name in an unfavorable\nway. His -- his deposition testimony remarks --\nQUESTION: Well, he was concerned about the\ntarnishment aspect, and I still have to -- I would like\nyou to comment on the -- on Justice Ginsburg's example,\ntoo, would it diminish the capacity of the Victoria's\nSecret mark to identify its line of goods if some --\nsomebody thought they also sold men's pajamas?\nMR. DELLINGER: Yes.\nwell -- you begin to have the elements of the proof of\ndilution when you show that someone is using the same --\nor a name which reaches mental association because of a\nnumber of factors. You have the elements of dilution.\nYou might not yet have, as you have proof in this case, of\na really lessened capacity to identify and distinguish.\nNow, another -- the -- nobody sought to\nintroduce a survey in this case. I would trust Federal\njudges more than sociology graduate students to make this\nkind of determination, and nobody sought to bring before\nthis Court a fact-bound determination of whether all of\nthe judges below were correct when they found that there\nwas a strong association, and beyond that, that the use of\nthe Victor's Little Secret mark to sell the kinds of goods\nit sells, which some customers find unsavory, and which\nMr. Moseley himself testified some members of the public\nfind -- at least -- extremely offensive, that that has the\neffect of lessening the capacity of a Victoria's Secret\nmark to identify and distinguish those famous goods and --\nand products, and that's --\nQUESTION: But the blurring, then, that you're\ndescribing now has no quality component to it? That only\ncomes when you get to the subset?\nMR. DELLINGER: That is correct.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. DELLINGER: It -- it only affects the fact\nthat it doesn't -- no longer singularly stands for\nanything, that if Rolls-Royce were on 100 different\nproducts, it would no longer -- it would no longer mean\nanything, and would no longer -- they might as well call\ntheir car a Yugo if it's used on products hither and yon.\nTarnishment is a particular good example of why\nthe lessening itself needs to be remedied, because once\nyou've tarnished a product, it's hard to unring that bell\nin the public's mind, if someone had a national program.\nQUESTION: Of course, if you're dealing with\nRolls-Royce, I suppose virtually any blurring is also\ngoing to be tarnishment, which you don't necessarily have\neven in other famous marks.\nMR. DELLINGER: Tarnishment has generally been\nrestricted so far in the case law to more unsavory\nassociations, sex, drugs, and matters of that kind. This\nis an act which is more limited than its critics suggest.\nThey -- of course, whether it was a bad policy was a\nmatter that should have been addressed to Congress, but it\ncan be limited to a few very famous marks.\nA safe harbor is read broadly. People can use\nthe term, Victoria's Secret, for any purpose they want in\nparody and commentary, on the steps of the courthouse.\nThey just can't make this one use of it, that is a\ncommercial use in commerce that lessens the capacity of\nthat mark to carry out its function that Congress so\nclearly had in mind when it passed the Federal Trademark\nDilution Act.\nThat's why I think the courts below saw this,\nlike Buick Aspirin and Kodak Shoes, as a core paradigm\nexample of precisely what the statute was designed to\nprohibit, and why none of the --\nQUESTION: So, Mr. Dellinger --\nMR. DELLINGER: None of the most interesting\nquestions arise.\nQUESTION: -- is proof, then, submission? If\nyou've got a very famous, distinctive mark, and you've got\na -- a very similar use. You have those two things, and\nthen you get a few colonels to say yes, when they think of\nthe junior mark they think of the senior, is that enough\nproof?\nMR. DELLINGER: It is in this case, Justice\nGinsburg, where the sufficiency of that I think was really\nnot challenged.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Dellinger.\nMr. Higgins, you have 2 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES R. HIGGINS, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. HIGGINS:\nCourt:\nThere's no evidence in this case that Colonel\nBaker was ever in petitioner's store, and his particular\naffidavit was challenged and disregarded by the trial\ncourt. What we have here is a choice between two\nstandards to interpret the FTDA. Our choice is grounded\nin the actual use, words that Congress used, and the\nrespondent's position is grounded in the academic theory\nof dilution which we say is way ahead of the law.\nOur standard is objective and predictable.\nTheirs is subjective, unpredictable, invites the courts to\nsubstitute its own judgment for consumer perceptions.\nIt's consistent with almost nothing. Our standard focuses\non measurable consumer perception. Theirs focuses at the\nbeginning on semantic similarity, and a presumption that\ndilution follows from that. Our standard merely puts the\nfamous mark owner to their proof to show that Congress'\nwords, the lessening of the capacity, has been established\nas a matter of proof. They should not get a national\ninjunction without that.\nOur standard keeps trademark law in its proper\nbounds. Their standard merely rewards the achievement of\nfame. Our standard, if applied in this case, should\nresult in this Court reversing the injunction and\ndirecting that the petitioners be allowed to use Victor's\ngiven name in their business.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you,\nMr. Higgins.\n"
