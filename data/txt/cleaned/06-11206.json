HOCHMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. HOCHMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nFailure to report is not a violent felony\nunder the Armed Career Criminal Act because it presents\nneither a serious potential risk of injury to others nor\ninvolves violent and aggressive conduct.\nThe Government argues that failure to report\nsatisfies both the risk of injury and violent,\n-aggressive conduct standards for the same reason: The\nprospect that a offender will violently resist an arrest\n-- resist arrest upon completion of the offense or upon\n-- for having done the offense. That potential and that\npotential risk alone is neither as a matter of fact nor\nlaw sufficient to satisfy either the risk of injury or\nthe violent, aggressive conduct standard.\nBeginning with the risk of injury: The\nstatute refers to a serious potential risk of injury,\nand by using the word \"serious\" Congress indicated not\njust any felony, not just any felony which carries\nnecessarily some risk of injury would be included. The\nrisk that must be generated must be one that's somehow\ngreater than, something that warrants singly out this\nsort of offender as the sort of person who's deserving\nof greater punishment for his recidivism.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I take it you\nconcede that a breakout as opposed to a failure to\nreport would be covered by the statute?\nMR. HOCHMAN: Yes, Your Honor, I think it\nwould. I think that in fact one of the critical errors\nthat the courts of appeals have made and that the\nGovernment made here is equating breakout, prison\nescape, with failure to report. They are entirely\ndifferent. They are importantly different, both again\nas a matter of analytically the categorical rule and\nwhat would you look at to determine whether this sort of\nperson satisfied the violent and aggressive standard.\nAnd we now know, in light of the Sentencing Commission's\nreport that was filed just last -- that was filed with\nthe Court just last week, that the risk of injury\nassociated with a prison breakout escape and failure to\nreport is dramatically different. And that mistake --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But suppose it were shown\n-- this is hypothetical. Suppose it were shown that 90\npercent of all escapes under the escape statute were\nbreakouts involving weapons; 10 percent were failure to\nreport. Would that affect how we decide the case?\nMR. HOCHMAN: This case?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.\nMR. HOCHMAN: Well, since -- I think since\nthis is not a prison breakout case, I don't know whether\ndata about breakouts --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do we look to the crime to\nsee generally whether or not it involves violence and\nserious risk of harm?\nMR. HOCHMAN: I think you -- I think the\ncategorical rule does require you to look at --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So that, in my\nhypothetical, it would be a more difficult case than the\ncase we have here or would it be the same?\nMR. HOCHMAN: I think in your hypothetical,\nwhere a prison breakout-- where a prison breakout is\ninvolved --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No. My hypothetical is,\nunder the statute, if you look at the whole universe of\nprosecutions under the escape statute, 90 percent of\nthem are for breakouts involving weapons.\nMR. HOCHMAN: I don't think that you look to\nthe universe under the escape statute. You can under\nShepard --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's what we looked\nto in Begay.\nMR. HOCHMAN: But the issue under Shepard\nand the approach under the categorical rule requires you\n-- allows you to look at a narrower subsection of the\nstatute if the charging document and other reliable\nindicia indicate that. And in this case, it's\nundisputed that Mr. Chambers was convicted only of\nfailing to report. He was not convicted of the more\nserious offense of prison breakout. And in fact in\nIllinois they are punished at different levels, and the\nevidence is absolutely clear --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Maybe -- I don't\nwant to put words in his mouth, but I thought what\nJustice Kennedy was asking is what if you have a statute\nthat is just escape or whatever and doesn't break it\ndown like that? At that point would we look to see what\nthe crime of escape was typically like, most of them\nwere breakout or most of them were the other thing? You\nhave, I gather, two separate provisions, but what if you\ndon't?\nMR. HOCHMAN: Yes. And that -- that is a\ndifficult question under the categorical rule. I think\nthat the first step would be to determine whether there\nis anything in the record. Under Shepard, you can look\nto other indications of whether the conduct at issue\nthat was found by the jury or that was pled to, either\nfrom an indictment or from plea colloquy, whether there\nis some more specific indication. If not, I think then\nwhat you would look at -- and I think here you would\nlook at, to the extent you're looking at the risk -- on\nthe risk of injury side, you would look at the best\navailable information. If that -- if that gives you a\nrun of cases where you say typically --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. If\nthat's the case, I'm looking at 720 Illinois Statutes\n5/31-6. It's reproduced a page 2a of the Government's\nbrief. And they don't -- it doesn't seem to be a\nseparate provision, whether it's a breakout or a failure\nto report.\nMR. HOCHMAN: But here the charging document\nwas clear, and under Shepard the charging document is\nsomething you're also allowed to take into\nconsideration. And there is no doubt, under the\ncharging document, that he was convicted of merely\nfailing to report.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What was the sentence for\nthat?\nMR. HOCHMAN: It -- the sentence appears\nthat they extended his probation. He had to serve the\nfour weekends that he had failed -- for which he had\nfailed to report, and his probation was extended.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But he didn't get any\nextra jail time?\nMR. HOCHMAN: He did not get any additional\njail time as far as I can tell from the record, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There is really a problem\nabout -- about what you suggest. It may destroy the\nwhole benefit of the categorical approach. I mean, you\ncan always shave something down to become a narrower\ncrime. An escape statute, for example, I suppose you\ncould look to see whether the particular escape in\nquestion from the charging document was an escape that\nused firearms or was an escape that, you know, that\ninjured or killed guards. And, you know, that gets us\ninto the case-by-case examination that it is the whole\npurpose of the categorical approach to avoid. Now, how\ndo we -- how do we avoid getting to the bottom of that\nslippery slope?\nMR. HOCHMAN: I think this -- I think this\nCourt took that step in Shepard, and it did it in a very\nnarrow and circumscribed way. It did it by saying the\nonly things you're allowed to consider are things that\nare as reliable as the charge itself and the elements\nessential to --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. I mean, the charge\nmentions -- mentions a firearm. Anything that's in the\ncharge can be used to narrow the crime that we are\nlooking at.\nMR. HOCHMAN: If the jury instructions were\nclear, if it's clear that the jury had to find that the\npresence of a firearm -- and I think it complicates --\nthat is, I think some courts refer to it as the modified\ncategorical rule.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It has to be an element of\nthe crime. If using a firearm is not an element of\nescape, then I don't have to worry about it.\nMR. HOCHMAN: If -- if -- correct. If it's\nnot an element in the sense that he either pled to it or\nthe jury necessarily found it as a necessary matter.\nAnd that's really what Shepard says. It has to be\nsomething that we necessarily know occurred from the\nfact of conviction, and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay, but it doesn't have\nto be an element. So, if all the evidence in the case\nwas that, you know, he wrestled a gun from the guard and\nmade his way out of the prison that way, if the jury\nfound him guilty, that was the only basis on which it\ncould have found him guilty, that would be enough.\nMR. HOCHMAN: I don't think that Shepard\npermits you to look into trial transcripts of evidence\nthat was presented. It just says: What did the jury\nnecessarily find? And what I mean by \"jury\ninstructions,\" how was the jury instructed? What did it\nhave to find? What did the jury have to find in order\nto convict?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that sounds like an\nelement. That sounds like an element.\nMR. HOCHMAN: I think it is elements, but if\nyou look --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well --\nMR. HOCHMAN: Please, continue.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If you look at the cases\nthat we've had to decide under this statute in the last\ncouple of years, do you think they illustrate that the\ncategorical approach just doesn't work in this\nsituation? Because it puts us in a position for every\nsingle crime that comes up here of making -- of trying\nto ascertain what is the serious risk when we don't have\nany empirical -- we don't have a number quantifying what\na serious risk is, nor can we generally find what the\nrisk is that's associated with a particular class of\ncases.\nMaybe when Congress enacted this they never\nanticipated that it would be done on a categorical\nbasis. Why not just have a determination as to whether\nthere was a serious potential risk in this particular\ncase? So, if you have a -- a nonviolent person who\nwalks away, that's one thing. If you have somebody who\nhas a long list of convictions for violent -- violent\ncrimes and escapes, that's another situation.\nMR. HOCHMAN: I think there are two problems\nwith that approach, Your Honor: First, as the Court\nsaid in Shepard, the categorical rule, which was adopted\nway back when the Court first confronted the statute and\nhas been consistently applied ever since, more or less\nanticipated the Sixth Amendment Apprendi concerns that\nmight come from digging in and trying to attribute\nconduct which has not been found by a jury, which\ndoesn't have that level of reliability, whether it's an\nelement or was on a special verdict form or some -- or\nsome other -- or was admitted to in a plea colloquy.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Isn't that a separate\nquestion? If it had -- if it has to be found by a jury,\nit can be submitted to the jury?\nMR. HOCHMAN: Well, if it was submitted to\nthe jury, then I think under Shepard it's something that\ncould be considered, and that would be part of what's\nreferred to as the modified categorical approach. I\nthink the problems with the categorical approach that\nyou're identifying, courts have tried and Shepard itself\nin effect amended enough to provide some kind of\nflexibility.\nThe other reason to hold back on such a sea\nchange is this is, after all, a statutory case and the\ncategorical rule has been this Court's approach from the\nbeginning. Congress could easily revise the statute.\nIf after 20 years it hasn't --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, it could, and if it\nhad read these cases and it was paying attention to this\nproblem, you would think it would go through a list of\ncrimes and say, these fall within it and these don't\nfall within it. But obviously it hasn't done that.\nMR. HOCHMAN: I think that would make\neverybody's job, the bar and this Court, much easier.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it might not, if it\njust said \"escape,\" and then you'd have this same\nproblem.\nMR. HOCHMAN: That might be the case,\nalthough if it just said \"escape,\" I think I'd actually\nhave a substantially harder case than what we have here,\nbecause what we have here doesn't resemble the kind of\nviolent, aggressive conduct that this Court in Begay\nsaid is going to be the standard and exemplar of the\nsort of conduct that Congress was thinking about. It\nadded -- this Court in Begay said that the serious\npotential risk of injury is just one part of the\ninquiry, that Congress was also singling out crimes\ncommit ted in a certain way, and if that, if that\nrequirement is going to have any bite, if it's going to\ndo the job of singling out and separating out cases, it\nhas to be something beyond the mere routine,\never-present prospect that an offender might resist\narrest for having committed the offense after police\ndiscover that he has done so.\nAnd in fact if you step back for a moment\nand just visualize --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Surely it depends upon how,\nhow, what should I say, how often that prospect is\nrealized.\nMR. HOCHMAN: There is no doubt. There is\nno doubt that the prospect --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, the statute itself\nlists robbery and robbery very often doesn't involve any\nthreat of injury, but all and all we think it does.\nObviously, Congress thought it did, right?\nMR. HOCHMAN: Well in the -- I actually\nthink robbery would satisfy under the first clause\nbecause it has as an element the use, attempted use, or\nthreatened use of physical force against another. But I\nthink the concern that escape is much more easily\ndetected than other crimes is obviously true. And so\nthe prospect that the offender will be arrested is\nobviously greater than in other, in other crimes.\nBut the point is the standards, the standard\nimposed by Begay and the notion that the conduct must be\nviolent and aggressive, if you step back and visualize\nwhat it is about burglary, arson, extortion or the use\nof explosives that can properly be characterized as\nviolent and aggressive, surely it is not the prospect\nthat an offender will have been found out for having\ncommitted those offenses, police will be dispatched to\narrest them, and then the offender upon that\nconfrontation will violently resist arrest. It's\njust -- it's not, it's not what those enumerated\noffenses are doing in the statute.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't mean to say\nrobbery. I meant to say burglary. Why is burglary\nviolent or aggressive?\nMR. HOCHMAN: I think the reason is because\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, burglary by its\nnature is-- you do it at night. You don't want to be\ndetected. It's not violent or aggressive at all. It's\nsneaky, is what it is.\nMR. HOCHMAN: I assume that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Robbery is violent or\naggressive. You're quite right about that.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: When you say burglary, if\nyou're at home, if you're at home it's going to get\nviolent and aggressive.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but -- that may be,\nbut it does not in its nature indicate violence or\naggressiveness.\nMR. HOCHMAN: I think, Justice Souter, has\nit exactly right. I think the reason why the Court in\nBegay and Taylor, by the way, singled out burglary as\nhaving some kind of inherent danger and potential for\nviolent and aggressive conduct associated with it is\nbecause it involves an act of invading the space of\nanother, and cultural expectations and even common law\nexpectations about how others might respond suggest that\nthat scenario that you have willingly created, knowing\nfull well that another might respond violently to what\nyou've done in the event you've been detected --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It gets you right back into\nthe soup. What you're saying is all it requires is that\nthere be a potential for violence, for aggressiveness,\nright? And that's what the Government says here: There\nis a potential for violence and aggressiveness.\nMR. HOCHMAN: What it -- what it requires is\nthe conscious creation of circumstances that you have\ngood reason to believe is going to ignite in violence.\nAnd if we learned anything from the data that's been\nsubmitted to the Court both by the Sentencing Commission\nand by the Government, it's that there is very little\nreason to believe that even the distant arrest scenario\nfor those who fail to report doesn't carry with it very\nmuch of a risk of injury at all. In fact, in all the\nmaterials that have been submitted to this Court, there\nis not a single cited instance or case of an innocent\nbystander or a police officer who has been injured in\nconnection with a confrontation from arrest for failure\nto report. There are none.\nNow to be sure, there are some instances of\nviolent confrontation and I'm not here saying it's\nimpossible that there would be injury associated with an\narrest scenario. The point is it's nothing different.\nThere is nothing in the record that would give us any\nreason to believe this is the kind of special violent\nconduct that Congress was singling out for special\ntreatment. I should also add that excluding failure to\nreport from the statute isn't going to create any kind\nof crack through which the sort of people the Government\nappears to be concerned about might fall through. And\nthe reason it this. The several anecdotal cases they\ncite in their brief and a couple of the cases that\nMassachusetts reported back to them which had involved\nsome kind of violent resisting arrest, those individuals\nwere charged, separately charged for assault and battery\nand similar crimes on a police officer. It's\nunsurprising that when that happens, those individuals\nwill be separately charged and convicted for their\nviolent conduct.\nSo the only work that is done by sweeping\naway the categorical rule, doing serious damage to the\ncategorical rule, undermining Begay, the only work\nthat's done is to encompass people who we have reason to\nbelieve didn't engage in violent conduct. That seems to\nme a strange way to interpret the statute, certainly not\nthe sort of things this Court would want to close its\neyes to.\nThe last thing, Your Honors. It's important\nto preserve the distinction in Begay between the violent\nand aggressive standard on the one hand and the risk of\ninjury on the other hand, and Government's approach\ncollapses it. The Government says, why is this violent\nand aggressive? Because in their view we can --\nfalsely, as we've discussed, but because in their view\nthere is a sufficient risk of injury on arrest. If\nthat's going to be the case, if you're going to be able\nto show conduct is violent and aggressive simply because\nthere is a sufficient risk of injury associated with it,\nthe violent and aggressive conduct standard does\nnothing.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That doesn't square with\nthe answer you gave me with regard to burglary. If what\nyou just said is true, burglary wouldn't be among the\nlisted crimes.\nMR. HOCHMAN: No. The distinction I'm\ndrawing here is the act that you take of invading\nsomebody else's space and the prospect -- what you're\ndoing is you're consciously taking an act fully aware\nthat violence might ensue, which suggests that you are\nthe sort of person who is comfortable in a violent\nsituation or at least dangerously comfortable in such a\nviolent situation, regardless of how frequently that --\nthat circumstance actually is realized. You're the sort\nof person who has taken an action that expresses comfort\nwith that sort of situation.\nFailing to report --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So invading\nsomeone's space, so trespass would be covered by this\nstatute? You're invading someone's space.\nMR. HOCHMAN: If it's -- if it's felonious,\ntrespass might be. You're invading someone's space in\nthe circumstance where the response is -- I think there\nis a decent argument for trespass if for no other reason\nthan the act itself, on the violence and aggressive\nstandard side, the act itself is more or less the same\nas burglary. It's not as if you can immediately tell\nfrom observing the burglar enter the structure that he\nhas the intent, the requisite intent to commit another\ncrime.\nBut the other reason why I doubt that\ntrespass might be -- might satisfy the standard is\nbecause there may not -- there doesn't appear to be a\nserious potential risk of injury. The second -- the\nother requirement may not be satisfied. I just don't\nhave any information about that.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Your argument is that the\nfailing to report is not violent and aggressive and\ntherefore, no matter what degree of risk the statistics\nmight show, it would not qualify?\nMR. HOCHMAN: I'm making both arguments,\nYour Honor. But yes, that is one, that is one of them.\nIf there are no further questions, I'll\nreserve the remainder of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Roberts.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. ROBERTS: Mr. Chief Justice and may it\nplease the Court:\nFailure-to-report escape qualifies as a\nviolent felony under the ACCA's residual clause because\nit creates a serious potential risk of physical injury\nthat's comparable in both kind and degree to the risk\nthat's created by the enumerated offense of burglary.\nFailure-to-report escape is similar in kind to burglary\nbecause it's purposeful, violent, and aggressive in the\nsame way as burglary.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Roberts, wouldn't\nthat be so of any crime? This is failure to report.\nAny crime, any -- an arrest for any crime has a certain\nrisk that the arrestee is going to resist. Is there\nanything different, is anything greater, about this\narrest for this kind of crime?\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes, Your Honor. Two points\non that. First, escape and failure-to-report escape,\nother types of escape and recapture, are linked ed in a\nway that arrest and the typical crime aren't, because\nescape inherently avoids -- inherently involves the\navoidance of custody and custody is the very obligation\nthat recapture is trying to impose. But avoiding arrest\nisn't an element of the typical crime, so the connection\nbetween arrest and the ordinary crime isn't close enough\nto justify considering the violence in arrest -- in the\narrest in whether the crime is violent. Also the risk\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Say that again. I didn't\nunderstand it.\nMR. ROBERTS: Okay. What I'm saying is it's\nan element of escape that you're avoiding custody, and\nescape is a continuing offense and so it doesn't end\nuntil the avoidance of custody is over.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What's that got to do with\nincreasing the risk of violence? I mean, I see -- I see\nyour kind of elements argument, but it seems to be\nbeside the point that --\nMR. ROBERTS: It shows the close connection\nbetween the two. And so when you're -- when the\noffender is committing the crime, it's appropriate to\nhold him accountable for what he can see is so highly,\nclosely connected to the crime and which, in fact, has\nto happen in order to end the crime; whereas --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but the crime is still\n-- the crime that we are concerned with here is still\nessentially a passive crime. He just doesn't show up.\nMR. ROBERTS: Well --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And given, you know, the\nclose logical connections, I don't see that the close\nlogical connections convert the passive crime into a\nhigher degree of resisting arrest from any other. In\nfact, it suggests just the opposite.\nMR. ROBERTS: To address the -- the passive\npoint, deliberately failing to comply with your legal\nduty to report to prison is not -- it is not doing\nnothing, as Petitioner says. It's not purely passive.\nIt is a criminal act.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you know, you may\nprecisely be doing nothing. If I say, you know, it's\nMonday morning at 9 o'clock, I'm supposed to -- to\nreport to prison, and I'm going to stay home, my purpose\nis to stay put in my armchair. That's purposeful\nconduct and it's about as passive as you can get.\nMR. ROBERTS: It's purposefully inviting the\nviolent confrontation when the law enforcement officers\ncome to terminate --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You can say the same thing\nabout failure to respond to a traffic ticket.\nMR. ROBERTS: No. Because in -- in failure\nto respond to the traffic ticket the -- first of all,\nit's not clear that somebody is going to come after you\nand try to physically bring you in.\nSecond of all, the offender isn't expecting\nthem and on edge and prone to react violently.\nThird, he hasn't demonstrated already that\nhe is unwilling to submit to custody. And the fact that\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The offender is\nprone to react violently if he doesn't respond to a\ntraffic ticket?\nMR. ROBERTS: No. I'm saying just the\nopposite of that. I'm saying that it's different\nbecause here you've got somebody who is expecting the\npolice to come. He is looking over his shoulder all the\ntime. He knows they know he didn't come to prison. He\nknows they know who he is. They probably know where he\nis. If he is sitting at home, they know where he is.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is your\nunderstanding of the Illinois statute? It is, I take\nit, only triggered by failure to report for confinement?\nMR. ROBERTS: This --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about like, you\nknow, you've got to see your probation officer every --\nMR. ROBERTS: This offense that he was\nconvicted of is failure to report to a penal\ninstitution, failure to report to prison.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you concede the\nprobation or parole situation?\nMR. ROBERTS: I think a probation violation\nis different -- different circumstances. It doesn't\ninvolve the same refusal to submit to custody that this\noffense involves, which --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So we need not so\nmany -- not so much statistics about how many times\nviolence results, but statistics about how serious the\npolice are about picking somebody up?\nMR. ROBERTS: I don't think you really need\nthe statistics, Your Honor. I think it's a common --\nit's common sense that the police are going to make\nvigorous efforts to recapture people who fail to show up\nto prison the way they are supposed to.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But it's not common sense\nthat the person who has been guilty of a crime so\ngentlemanly that they only made him report to prison on\nthe weekends would confront the policeman with violence\nwhen he comes. This is not normally what you think of\nas a violent type who has -- who has been told to report\nweekends to the prison.\nMR. ROBERTS: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But did he get additional\ntime, by the way, when -- when they finally brought him\nback?\nMR. ROBERTS: When he was sentenced -- when\nhe was convicted of escape, he was sentenced to six\nmonths in prison -- in jail, that was stayed; probation\nfor 30 months, and he violated his probation and he\nended up in jail for 5 years.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So he just -- he just had\nto make up the weekends that he had lost?\nMR. ROBERTS: No. He didn't just have to\nmake up the weekends that he had lost.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's what Mr. Hochman\ntold us --\nMR. ROBERTS: I know that, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- when I asked that\nquestion.\nMR. ROBERTS: But I don't think that's\naccurate for the sentence for escape. On page 113 to\n114 of this JA, Your Honor, which is the -- the PSR\ndescribing what happened for this offense, it says that\nhe has 30 months probation. It's in the second volume,\nthe volume under seal.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, this guy doesn't\nsound to me like Jack the Ripper. He really doesn't.\nMR. ROBERTS: You know, we are not supposed\nto be looking at the individual offender here. It's the\ncategorical approach. But he had been convicted of\nrobbery and aggravated battery, Your Honor. So he -- he\nis not somebody who has not done any violent crimes,\neither. And what's -- what's different is that he has\nnow deliberately failed to comply with his legal duty to\nreport. He has now deliberately resisted custody, so --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But would the statute\napply if -- say he is supposed to go in on the weekends.\nInstead, he goes out on a binge, and then he voluntarily\ncomes in on a Monday morning saying, yes, I failed to\nreport, and so here I am.\nMR. ROBERTS: First of all, while he is out\non the binge, people could be coming and looking for him\nand the violent confrontation could occur.\nSecond of all, even if in the unusual case of somebody\nwho comes in voluntarily hours late, a few days late,\nthere wasn't a -- a risk of -- of violence, which we\nthink there can be, but even if there was none, it\nwouldn't matter because you're applying the categorical\napproach here. And what you don't look at -- you don't\nlook at the unusual case. You look at the elements of\nthe offense in the ordinary case.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you -- can you tell\nme: The U.S. attorney has this case. The man failed to\nreport for custody some -- a few years earlier, and you\nhave this offense. Does the district attorney or --\npardon me -- the United States attorney have some\ndiscretion here that he may not prosecute at all? What\n-- what goes into the --\nMR. ROBERTS: I think generally the policy\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What goes through the mind\nof -- of a prosecutor? He says, because this fellow\nfailed to report earlier for this offense, I'm going to\ngive him 15 extra years in jail.\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, Your Honor, he is -- he\nis looking at his whole --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what does a -- are\nthere many instances where you think in a case like this\na U.S. attorney would just elect not to file that\ncharge?\nMR. ROBERTS: I --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Or do you think they\nautomatically file it every time; and if not, how do\nthey define it?\nMR. ROBERTS: I think generally that -- that\nthey look at the conduct that's been committed and they\n-- that the policy is to charge the -- the maximum\ncharges that are supported by what the -- what the\ndefendant has done. But here you don't have --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do they ever look at the\n-- do they ever look at the attorney? This attorney has\nbeen giving us a hard time, and we ought to show him\nthat we really mean business? Do they look at the\nnature of the -- the identity of the counsel of the\ndefendant? Do they ever look at that?\nMR. ROBERTS: I'm -- I'm not aware of that.\nI can't -- can't speak to the -- the fact that they\nwould do that, Your Honor. But here you've got in the\nACCA, you're got not one previous violation for escape;\nyou've got three violent felonies that you have to have.\nAnd this was his third one with -- in addition to\nrobbery and aggravated battery and in addition to\ndistributing cocaine within a thousand feet of public\nhousing. And so we are not talking about --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understood your\nfriend -- excuse me. I understood your friend to say\nthat you don't have a single example of failure to\nreport leading to a violent confrontation.\nMR. ROBERTS: That's -- that's also\nincorrect, Your Honor. Two of the four cases that we\ncited in our -- in our brief, in our anecdotes, involved\ninjury to innocent bystanders. It's true we didn't\nhighlight that in the parentheticals to those cases, but\nit's on page 19, the -- we cite various cases, and we\nalso then go on to cite some articles just as an\nexample.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you have -- so\nyou have two examples.\nMR. ROBERTS: We have those two examples. I\nmean, I haven't gone out and looked for other cases.\nThose are just two out of the four that we cited.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You haven't gone out\nand looked for other -- I'm sorry. You haven't gone out\nand looked for other cases? I thought you --\nMR. ROBERTS: In -- in addition to those,\nno. I -- I went to get some sample cases. I haven't\ngone to see if I could find more cases of those. In\naddition, in the Massachusetts data there are -- there\nare two of the 18. Admittedly, the sample is small in\nMassachusetts --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Roberts --\nMR. ROBERTS: But it's 11 percent of the\npeople violently resisted, and they were charged with\nassault and battery on a police officer. I think that\nthat's indicative of possible injury. And in any case\nthe question is --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Roberts, have you had\noccasion to look at the -- the recent figures compiled\nby the Sentencing Commission?\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes, Your Honor. And I think\nthat the Sentencing Commission data also supports --\nalthough, again, the -- the sample size is small. But\nthe question here is: Is there a potential risk? And\nwhat the sentencing data shows for the failure-to-report\nescapees is that 7.1 --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is the magnitude of the\nrisk relevant? Suppose it happens one out of 10,000\ntimes or 99 out of 100 times. Are they different cases?\nMR. ROBERTS: We don't think that you should\nbe looking at the statistics at -- at all, Your Honor.\nBut -- and so -- I mean, you know, that's our -- our\nfundamental point is that -- that the ACCA requires a\npotential risk. The James case illustrates that you\ndecide these cases without statistics.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But the potential risk is\nbased on an empirical assessment. What's -- how can we\nmake an empirical assessment without statistics?\nMR. ROBERTS: What James says is that you\ntry to assess whether the degree of risk is comparable\nto the degree of risk presented by one of the enumerated\noffenses. And, as you did in James --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But isn't that's based on\nour experience because we have these cases; we've been\nlawyers; we know what they usually involve. We have\nsome sort of a --\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- an instinct or a basis\nfor making a judgment.\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If statistics can inform\nthat, why ignore the statistics?\nMR. ROBERTS: I'm not saying that you should\nignore the statistics, but the statistics are neither\nnecessary nor dispositive. And I don't think the\nstatistics cast any doubt on the commonsense conclusion\nbased on some of the factors I was talking about before,\nabout why there's a potential for violence during --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But your argument goes\nsimply to whether there is potential and the statute\nsays \"serious potential.\" Which gets us, it seems to\nme, to the point that Justice Kennedy is making, and\nthat is, we've got to have something more than an\ninstinctive belief that something bad might happen.\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, I think James addresses\nthat, Your Honor. And James says that in deciding\nwhether you have a serious potential, you look to the\nenumerated offenses and you determine if they can be\ncomparable.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: They were taking as\nexamples cases in which there was serious potential.\nBut in any event, you can't lose sight of the modifier.\nIt has got to be more than a so-called \"potential risk.\"\nMR. ROBERTS: It has -- it has to be more\nthan a potential. It has to be serious in the sense\nthat it's similar in degree, comparable in degree, to\none of the enumerated offenses.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What one are we to do\nwith -- Justice Stevens -- I think you should address\nthe statistics in the sentencing report.\nMR. ROBERTS: Okay.\nJUSTICE BREYER: As I read them, they put\ntogether -- if you put together failing to report and\nfailing to return, you get 160 cases in their sample.\nAnd the number of those cases, whether you looked at the\ntime when he had left or whether you looked at the time\nhe was apprehended, in which force was involved is zero.\nThe number of cases in which injury was involved is\nzero. The number of cases where he had a dangerous\nweapon is five.\nMR. ROBERTS: That's right. And --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So now there we\nare.\nMR. ROBERTS: It's a 3.1 percent -- 3.1\npercent rate of having this dangerous weapon when he is\nbeing -- being taken into custody for -- for this\noffense. And, you know, looking at the -- at the\nfailure-to-report people, which is what this person is\ncharged of, of those 42 people, that was 7.1 percent of\nthose people that had a weapon. And if one of those\npeople had used that weapon, that would have been a 2.4\npercent chance of injury.\nNow, I'm saying the sample size is small,\nand this shows why it's dangerous to put too much weight\non it. But that would have been a 2.4 percent rate of\ninjury. And in Tennessee v. Garner, this Court cited a\nstatistic in the 1970s about the risk of violence during\nburglary. And this was household burglary, which you\nthink might be likely --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You had every opportunity,\nwhen we have 160 cases out of the universe -- I guess I\ndon't know what the universe is, but sampling proceeds\nthrough a small amount of cases. And you could, of\ncourse, criticize the Sentencing Commission effort if\nyou have the statistician or someone who will tell us\nthat that sampling was not an appropriate method to\nproceed. Is there any such person?\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, no, Your Honor. And I'm\nnot criticizing it. I'm saying that you have to take\ninto account the sample size and you have to take into\naccount that there are --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. Why -- that was my\nquestion. Why take into account the sample size in the\nabsence of a statistician who would tell us that the\nsample size is too small to reach the conclusion that\nthe commission reaches?\nMR. ROBERTS: Because my point is that --\ntake the 42 failure-to-report people, which is the\noffense here, okay. Three of them -- three of those 42,\nhad guns. If one of those three had used the gun, that\nwould have been a use of force, an instance of actual\nviolence.\nThat percentage -- I'm not -- I'm not\nquestioning the statistical validity of anything. I'm\ntaking it on its terms. That's a 2.4 percent statistic\nthere.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But they didn't use a gun.\nMR. ROBERTS: 3.8 percent in -- in household\nburglary. So I just think that -- that the statistics\nare -- are very low, the risk of actual violence in\nburglary as well.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry, counsel.\nOne of my colleagues was trying to ask a question.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The problem is you say if\nhe had used a gun. And he didn't use a gun. I mean, to\ncome up with your statistics on the basis of something\nthat didn't happen is not using statistics; it's using\nimagination.\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, Your Honor, the statute\nagain talks about the potential risk. It doesn't talk\nabout the actual use of force or the actual injury. The\nactual use of force is covered by clause one --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think those\nstatistics show a greater danger than the dangers from\ndrunk driving that were involved in Begay?\nMR. ROBERTS: No. But I think the drunk\ndriving -- that what concerned the Court about drunk\ndriving was that the crime is a strict liability crime.\nIt didn't involve deliberate conduct. This conduct is\npurposeful. Petitioner doesn't -- doesn't contest that.\nAnd the situation here is a different kind of risk.\nIt's like the risk in burglary. It's the deliberate\ncommission of the crime despite the clear risk of an\nensuing violent confrontation.\nAnd so, the parallel, there really isn't a\nparallel to the strict liability crime there, where the\ninjury -- the Court said in Begay there is a serious\nrisk of injury. The problem is that the crime is just\nnot purposeful, so it doesn't show this willingness to\nharm others.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, of course, that's\nthe point. Begay talked about purposeful violent\nconduct, not just purposeful conduct.\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes, Your Honor. But you have\nto -- you have to talk about the violent conduct in\ncontext. And what it said is that all these enumerated\ncrimes are violent crimes. But burglary is violent not\nbecause the violence is some element of the offense.\nThere is nothing about the elements of the offense\nthat's violent. What makes burglary violent is the fact\nthat the offender deliberately commits it, even though\nhe knows it could trigger this violent confrontation.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The distinction between\nthis crime and crimes in general is that this person has\nshown that he or she doesn't want to go back into\ncustody, is that --\nMR. ROBERTS: I think it's -- it's numerous\nthings, but the avoidance of custody is sort of a\ncategorical difference between this and all the other\ncrimes, Your Honor. It's an element of this crime that\nhe is doing that.\nThat also factors into the fact that the\nrisk of violence during recapture is going to be greater\nthan the risk of violence in apprehending an ordinary\ncriminal for several different related reasons. One --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There is -- there was,\nthis case comes to us from the Seventh Circuit, right?\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And am I correct in\nunderstanding that since this case was decided, the\nSeventh Circuit has changed its position and has gone\nthe other way?\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes. The Seventh Circuit\nthought that applying the purposeful, violent and\naggressive requirement of Begay required a different\nresult because it -- it thought that it meant that the\ncrime had to involve violent conduct itself; and it\ndidn't appreciate the point I was making before, that\nburglary doesn't involve that violent conduct itself,\nand that burglary is violent because of the prospect of\nthe violent confrontation.\nAnd so, that's the -- that's what led the\nSeventh Circuit astray the second time around. But it\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The first time around,\ndidn't one of the judges suggest that there ought to be\na study comparing the frequency of violence in escapes\nfrom custody to the frequency of violence in failure to\nreport, and isn't that what we now have from the\nSentencing Commission?\nMR. ROBERTS: Yes. They did ask for -- for\nstatistics. But I would stress again why we think\nthat -- that looking to statistics as some kind of a\nrequirement is, you know, both perilous and not required\nby the statute: One, because the statute requires just\npotential risk, not actual injury.\nTwo, because these data are just generally\nnot going to be available. And you don't have even the\nbaseline for the other crimes, the enumerated crimes,\nreally to compare it to. And so the result, if you\nstart looking around for statistics and saying we need\nthese statistics to do it, is that virtually no crimes\nare going to qualify under the residual clause.\nAnd obviously, that isn't what Congress\nintended when it adopted this broad residual clause.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: May I -- may I -- may I ask\nyou just to get some sense about what will qualify? I\nmean, I think we -- we all agree that the risk of\nviolence in arrest is probably going to vary depending\non -- categorically depending on the crimes.\nI think I would probably agree that\nwhite-collar crimes are not likely to -- to carry a very\nhigh risk of violence on arrest. So I -- there's one\ncategory. Can you think of others, other categories\noutside of white-collar crime, that are going to have a\nlower risk of arrest than, say, the failure-to-report\ncategory?\nMR. ROBERTS: What -- we wouldn't sweep in\nany crimes based on arrest if the crimes don't\nthemselves involve as part of the crime the avoidance of\ncustody, because that shows the close link between the\ncrime that I was explaining before. That's sort of the\ncategorical difference, although I would agree with you,\ncertainly, that in white-collar crimes in many cases the\noffender is going to submit voluntarily to custody; they\nare not even going to come after him. And he hasn't\ndone anything to show his likelihood to resist in any\nway, and so there is going to be a significantly less\nconnection there.\nViolent crimes where you might think that\nthere is going to be a higher incidence are going to be\ncovered based on the violence of the crime, anyway.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: They are going to be in\ncategory one.\nMR. ROBERTS: Right. They are going to be\ncovered already.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nMR. ROBERTS: So you know, one, we think\nthere is a categorical difference between this kind of\ncrime which has as an element avoidance custody, and all\nof the ordinary crimes that you're talking about. But\neven if you go and set that aside and don't draw that\ncategorical line, and you look at, well, what's the risk\nof violence, here what you've got is you've got you know\nthat they are going to come after him; he knows they are\ncoming; he is already deliberately, he has already\nindicated his unwillingness to submit to custody; they\nknow that; so they come prepared for resistance. And in\nIllinois he is by definition a recidivist felon if he\nhas committed this crime, and those are characteristics\nthat are particularly indicative of dangerousness. So\nwe think this sets it quite apart from other crimes in\nterms of the risk of violence that -- that we are\ntalking about.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do you happen to know how\nmany additional crimes are likely to raise issues like\nthis under the residual clause?\nMR. ROBERTS: Not -- you know, how many\ncould be covered altogether? Or --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well after we decide this\ncase, how many more cases like this do you anticipate\nthat we're -- we may get under ACCA?\nMR. ROBERTS: Well I'm hopeful that the\nCourt won't have to decide too many other cases with the\nguidance that will be given by Begay and James and\nnow -- and now this case.\nSo, you know, it has been -- this case, the\nCourt took; it had been holding the case for Begay and\nit took it rather than vacating and remanding. So it's\nnot as if this is a case where some conflict has\ndeveloped after the Court was taken to resolve. We\nthink --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Roberts, I'm sorry; do\nyou think a soldier who is AWOL commits a violent crime?\nMR. ROBERTS: I think a soldier that goes\nAWOL -- I mean, the soldier that goes AWOL does probably\ninvite somebody to come after them. It's a little bit\nharder case here because he is not somebody who is a\nrecidivist felon.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, he has to be a\nrecidivist. This is one of three offenses for an\naggravated sentence. You never have the isolated\nquestion.\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, when he did it first --\nhe could have done it in his first crime. So you don't\nknow when did this that he had the other two counting\nunder the ACCA.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It would only be a crime\nif it's his third crime and not if it's his first.\nMR. ROBERTS: Well, you don't look to the\nindividual person; we're looking to the ordinary case\nand we know from the elements here that you have a\nrecidivist -- you have a recidivist felon. I do think\nthat there is a risk of -- you know, there is a risk of\nviolent confrontation when a soldier goes AWOL, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Sure.\nMR. ROBERTS: I just don't think it's quite\nas -- as clear a risk as it is -- as it is here, but you\nknow, I would have to say that there is some risk. Yes.\nThe -- if I could just address something\nthat Justice Kennedy had raised before about statutes\nunlike Illinois's statute that has a -- that generally\nprohibit escape. One -- one possible problem that could\narise from a holding that offenses like failure to\nreport are not violent felonies is that a statute that\nbroadly covered escape, the result would be that jail\nbreak escapes would not be violent felonies under that\nstatute, because the statistics that are out there\nsuggest that 89 percent of all escapes are either\nwalkaways or failure to report.\nAnd so unless the charging document\nspecifically charged it as a jail break escape, then the\ngeneral -- something that was charged under the general\nescape statute would not qualify for coverage under the\nACCA.\nAnd aside from that, if the Court has no\nfurther questions, we could ask that the judgment of the\nCourt of Appeals be affirmed.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Hochman, you have 11 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT N. HOCHMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. HOCHMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nJust to begin with where Mr. Roberts left\noff, most states in fact do distinguish in their\nstatutes between failure to report and prison break\nescapes. These are cited by both parties in the briefs\nand you can review them, but there are clear\ndistinctions in the law. So the risk that prison break\nescape is somehow going to escape -- escape, if you\nwill, from the scope of the statute as a result of a\nreversal is -- is unfounded.\nJust to make a couple of things clear.\nFirst of all with respect to the sentence, Justice\nGinsburg, the -- he was sentenced to six additional\nmonths but it was stayed as -- as was mentioned; and so\nwhen I was answering that question he did not serve\nadditional time as a result of that, and that's what I\nwas referring to.\nIf you look at the sentencing transcript,\nthat's where the indication is that he did in fact serve\nout four additional weekends. It's not noted in the --\nit's not noted as an additional sentence, punishment for\nit.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What was he serving those\nweekends for? What was the crime?\nMR. HOCHMAN: That was the armed robbery --\nthe robbery crime, not armed robbery, the robbery crime.\nThat's the first predicate offense here.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He just gets weekends for\nthat? How many weekends?\nMR. HOCHMAN: 11.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Pretty good deal.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. HOCHMAN: Second, with respect to the\nanecdotal cases, you know, we looked at them; you could\nlook at them. If there are two instances where there\nare injury -- there are two instances where there are\ninjury, I didn't catch that, and I apologize if I\nmisspoke.\nBut it doesn't change the core of the\nproblem, which is that the anecdotal evidence\nproduced -- and that dates back all the way to 1977,\nthey looked back at cases -- they are covering on\nextraordinary broad period of time in looking for this\nstuff, and there is just not -- there is not a lot\nthere, if there is anything there at all, with respect\nto injury associated with failure to report.\nOn the core substance of their argument,\nMr. Roberts emphasized that failing to report has as an\nelement avoiding arrest, avoiding confinement. I don't\nactually think that's right. There is nothing about\nconcealment. There is nothing about hiding. There is\nnothing about seeking to escape from a police officer\nwho comes to bring you back. He just didn't go; and in\nfact we don't -- the record doesn't explain why; but you\nknow, it was the November to December period. It's the\nholiday period of time for people when they, obviously,\nfor a variety of reasons might prefer to spend time with\ntheir families. Whatever the reason was --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Statistics show that\nthe number of robberies increases during the holiday\nseason. He just needed to get --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought he did this\nfour times. I thought there were four.\nMR. HOCHMAN: There were four periods from\nthe end of November, four consecutive weekends from the\nend of November into December. There is no indication,\nMr. Chief Justice, that any further robberies were\ncommitted during that period. But the point is --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, there is no\nindication he meant to spend time with his family over\nthe holidays.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. HOCHMAN: Not in the record. It's\nabsolutely not in the record, Your Honor. No doubt.\nBut the point is that while Mr. Roberts stood up and\nsaid it's about avoiding arrest; it's about concealing\nyourself; it's the sort of person that's prone to react\nviolently; the fact is, that's speculation; and\neverything we know from the sentencing commission and\nfrom their own efforts suggests the contrary. And\nindeed even the dangerous weapon findings of the\nsentencing commission, I think, should be excluded,\nbecause under the guidelines, the mere possession of a\nweapon is not a violent felony.\nA felon in possession is not -- cannot be a\npredicate offense under the guidelines. And so the mere\npossession of a weapon, which is all you have on those\nfive instances -- by the way, the fact that they did not\ndouble-count them as also including four suggests they\nweren't used in any way, they weren't brandished in any\nway. It's just not there. There is really nothing\nthere to support the Government's speculation. If there\nis no further questions, thank you, Your Honors.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
