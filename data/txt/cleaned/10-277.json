BOUTROUS, JR.,\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BOUTROUS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe mandatory nationwide class in this case\nwas improperly certified for two fundamental reasons.\nFirst, plaintiffs failed to satisfy Rule 23(a)'s\ncohesion requirements as reflected in the commonality,\ntypicality, and adequacy requirements of the rule.\nSecond, plaintiffs' highly individualized claims for\nmonetary relief failed to satisfy Rule 23(b)(2)'s\nrequirements for certification of a mandatory\nnon-opt-out class.\nRegarding Rule 23(a), because the\nplaintiffs' claims in this case hinge on the delegation\nof discretion to individual managers throughout the\ncountry, they cannot meet the cohesion requirements that\nare reflected in -- in Rule 23(a). The delegation of\ndiscretion in some ways is the opposite of cohesive\nclaims that are common to everyone in the class. The\ncommon policies that the plaintiffs point to are either\nneutral and not argued to be discriminatory or they are\naffirmatively nondiscriminatory. The company has a very\nstrong policy against discrimination and in favor of\ndiversity.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose if\ncorporate headquarters had learned that the subjective\ndecisionmaking or the delegation of decisionmaking to\nthe field was resulting in several discriminatory\npractices or a pattern of discrimination -- in other\nwords, the decentralized process was leading to\ndiscrimination -- then I suppose the company -- that\nthat could be attributed to the policy adopted by -- at\nheadquarters?\nMR. BOUTROUS: No, Your Honor. I think that\nin this situation, if there was a pattern, for example,\nat a particular store where the decisionmaking unit -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I'm talking\nabout -- so, they've got thousands of stores, and, you\nknow, every week they get a report from another store\nsaying that, you know, there's an allegation of gender\ndiscrimination. At some point, can't they conclude that\nit is their policy of decentralizing decisionmaking that\nis causing or permitting that discrimination to take\nplace?\nMR. BOUTROUS: That -- I think that would be\nan inquiry, Your Honor. I don't think it would rise to\na pattern or practice or a common policy that affects\neveryone in the same way. Certainly, companies do look\nat the -- the situation throughout the company and seek\nto root out discrimination, but it would take more than\nsome reports, especially in -- in a company that has so\nmany stores and so many units.\nAnd here, the plaintiffs' claims simply\naren't typical. If the three named plaintiffs stand\nbefore the court, they are supposed to represent 500,000\nor a million or more people and stand in judgment -\nthat's the words the Court used in Hansberry v. Lee -\nto represent all those other people. And the claim is\nthat the individual decisionmakers in those other cases\nexercised their discretion in a way that was biased, and\nthere's no proof of that.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Did -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The Chief Justice's\nquestion reminds me somewhat of our rule in Monell under\n1983: A city is not liable for a -- a constitutional\nviolation unless it has a policy. Would you think that\nwe could use that as an analogue to determine whether or\nnot there is a common question here?\nMR. BOUTROUS: Yes, Your Honor. I think the\nanalogue is that if a company had a policy, a general\npolicy, of discrimination as opposed to here, where it's\na general policy against discrimination, and it was -\nin the words of the Court in Feeney, saw patterns\nthroughout the company and because of sex, because of\ngender, continued to allow the patterns to exist, that\nwould raise a different question.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose, following the\nMonell analogue, there's -- it's a -- there's a showing\nof deliberate indifference to the violation. Would that\nbe a policy?\nMR. BOUTROUS: Your Honor, I think\ndeliberate indifference raises a different question.\nUnder a disparate treatment claim, again, in Feeney, the\ntest would be, was the company allowing the\ndiscrimination to occur because of gender, because it\nwanted there to be discrimination? There's no evidence\nof that here.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there any\nresponsibility if you -- the numbers are what has been\nleft out so far. The company gets reports month after\nmonth showing that women are disproportionately passed\nover for promotion, and there is a pay gap between men\nand women doing the same job. It happens not once, but\ntwice. Isn't there some responsibility on the company\nto say, is gender discrimination at work, and if it is,\nisn't there an obligation to stop it?\nMR. BOUTROUS: Your Honor, yes, there is an\nobligation to ensure -- for a company to do its best to\nensure there are not wage gaps and discrimination. But\nhere, for example, if one looks at the aggregated\nstatistics that the plaintiffs have pointed to, it\npoints to a completely different issue. It does not\nshow that there were gender gaps at the stores among\ncomparable people. That's really the fundamental flaw\nin their case.\nTheir argument is that individual\ndecisionmakers throughout the country were making\nstereotyped decisions and that that had a common effect,\nbut they just added everything together. They haven't\nshown a pattern across the map. They've added all the\ndata together and pointed to disparities, some of which\nmirror some of the -- the statistics that -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I thought their\nexpert didn't aggregate them together. He did it\nregionally, not store by store, as your expert did,\nnumber one; and, number two, that he performed, as\naccepted by the district court, and affirmed by the\ncircuit court, any number of controlled variable\ncomparisons, including job history, job ratings, and\nother things, and found that the disparity could not be\nexplained on any of the normal variables that one would\nexpect and that the disparity was significantly much\nhigher than the 10 competitors of Wal-Mart and what they\nwere paying their labor force.\nSo, what is speculative about that, number\none? And, two, why is that kind of statistical analysis\ninadequate to show that a policy of some sort exists?\nMR. BOUTROUS: Justice Sotomayor, first,\nplaintiffs' expert did a national regression and then\nsimply estimated the regional results. He did not do a\nregional regression. But even if he had, these\nstatistics go more to the merits. We think we have\nstrong arguments on the merits responding to those\nstatistical arguments -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that begs the\nlegal question, which is -- you're right. Ultimately,\nyou may win and prove to a factfinder that this analysis\nis fatally flawed, but what the district court concluded\nwas that on the basis of your expert, whom he discounted\nbecause your expert was -- was basing analysis on -- on\npremises that the court found not acceptable, that there\nwas enough here after a rigorous analysis.\nWhat's the standard that the court should\nuse in upsetting that factual conclusion?\nMR. BOUTROUS: Your Honor, the district\njudge did not discount Wal-Mart's expert. The district\ncourt found that it wasn't the stage at which to make a\ndetermination between the two. The standard that we\nthink would govern would be the standard that the Second\nCircuit adopted in the IPO case, which says there needs\nto be a choice.\nWhen you're talking about discretionary\ndecision around the country by different decisionmakers,\nthere has to be some demonstration that there's a common\neffect throughout the system. Our expert's report and\ntestimony showed that at 90 percent of the stores, there\nwas no pay disparity. And that's the kind of -- and\neven putting that aside, the plaintiffs needed to come\nforward with something that showed that there was this\nmiraculous recurrence at every decision across every\nstore of stereotyping, and the evidence simply doesn't\nshow that.\nThe -- the other problem on the -- on the\ncohesion analysis is that -- again, the typicality\ninquiry. Each of the plaintiffs have very different\nstories. One of them was promoted into a managerial\nposition. One was terminated for disciplinary\nviolations. One was promoted and then had a\ndisciplinary problem and then was demoted. In each of\nthese cases, if this were an individual case, they would\nhave to show that they were treated differently than\npeople who were situated just like them, with the same\nsupervisor, the same department, the same situation.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What do you think is the\ndifference between the standard that the district court\nwas required to apply at the certification stage on the\nquestion whether there was a company-wide policy and the\n-- the standard that would be applied on the merits?\nMR. BOUTROUS: At the certification stage,\nJustice Alito, the plaintiffs did not have to prove that\nthere was an actual policy of discrimination and that\nthat was the company's policy, but they at least needed\nto point to a policy that was common and that linked all\nof these disparate individuals and disparate locations\nand different people together. And -- and one -- their\nargument is that the common policy is giving tens of\nthousands of individuals discretion to do whatever they\nwant. That is not commonality. It's the opposite.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I don't think that's quite\nfair, Mr. Boutrous. I think their argument was that the\ncommon policy was one of complete subjectivity, was one\nof using factors that allowed gender discrimination to\ncome into all employment decisions. And in Watson, we\nsuggested that that was a policy, a policy of using\nsubjective factors only, when making employment\ndecisions. That's exactly the policy that was alleged\nhere.\nMR. BOUTROUS: Justice Kagan, they do not\nargue that it was an entirely subjective process. As\nthe Court suggested in Falcon, entirely subjective\nwould -- would be a different issue. They argue that it\nwas excessive subjectivity and that there were general\noverarching company standards that exerted control.\nOn page -- I think it's on page 13 of their\nbrief, they say the discretion was unguided. Three\npages later they say it was guided by these\nnondiscriminatory policies. So, it's really an\nincoherent theory that does not have -- pose the kind of\nsituation you're suggesting.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I -- I guess I'm just a\nlittle -- a little bit confused as to why excessive\nsubjectivity is not a policy that can be alleged in a\nTitle VII pattern and practice suit or in a Title VII\ndisparate impact suit.\nMR. BOUTROUS: Your Honor, in Watson, the\nCourt did suggest -- did state and -- and hold that\nsubjective decisionmaking could be challenged in a\ndisparate impact case, but Justice O'Connor's opinion\nwent on to say there needs to be the identification of a\nspecific practice within that policy.\nAs the Court said in Falcon, Title VII does\nnot govern policies; it governs practices. And\nsubjectivity is not a practice if it were a policy. And\nthere was a -- like most companies, Wal-Mart has a\ncombination of objective and subjective standards.\nWithin that, the plaintiffs -- if they had pointed to\nsome particular criteria, people with a great\npersonality, they're going to -- they're -- they're the\nones we're going -- we're going to push up, and they -\nthey were trying to tie that to a disparate impact or\ndisparate treatment, that would be -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Boutrous, there was a\ncase, it was in the '70s, and it was a class action\nagainst AT&T for, I think, promotion into middle\nmanagement. What was at issue there was a part -- a\ntest, part objective, but then in the end, the final\nstep was a so-called total person test, and women\ndisproportionately flunked at that total person.\nAnd the idea wasn't at all complicated. It\nwas that most people prefer themselves; and so, a\ndecisionmaker, all other things being equal, would\nprefer someone that looked like him. And that was\nfound, that total -- the application of that total\nperson concept was found to be a violation of Title VII.\nThis sounds quite similar. I mean, it's not\njust -- it's not subjective. You have an expert -- I\nknow you have some questions about that expert -- but\nthe expert saying that gender bias can creep into a\nsystem like that simply because of the natural\nphenomenon that people tend to feel comfortable with\npeople like themselves.\nMR. BOUTROUS: Your Honor, this -- this is\nnot like the total person test, but I think that is a\nvery good example of something that could be a -- a\npractice inside the -- the overarching policies, and if\nyou had a case where a particular decisionmaking unit\napplied the total practice test, and you had disparate\nresults in that particular unit, that group of people\ncould -- could -- would have a much stronger case for a\nclass action.\nBut as Your Honor points out, the -- the\nsociologist here, who is the glue that's supposed to\nhold this class together, said he couldn't tell if\nstereotyping was occurring one-half of 1 percent or 95\npercent or at all.\nAnd this is a class action. The question\nhere is whether that we can assume that every\ndecisionmaker acted in the same manner in a way that had\nin this Court's words the same injury, caused -- the\nplaintiffs had the same interest and the same injury,\nthat's the way the Court put it in Amchem, by their own\nexpert accepting all of their proof, the answer is no.\nThat assumption is not supported by the record. That's\nwhy there's not the kind of cohesion that's necessary to\nprotect the rights of the absent class members and the\ndefendant.\nThe -- the -- the other -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Boutrous, I think that\nthat suggests that the plaintiffs would have to\ndemonstrate discrimination in every individual case, and\nthat's never been the law. All that the plaintiffs have\nto demonstrate and, especially at this stage in the\nproceedings, is that there is a practice, a policy of\nsubjectivity that on the whole results in discrimination\nagainst women, not that each one of these women in the\nclass were themselves discriminated against.\nMR. BOUTROUS: That's correct, Your Honor.\nAt the phase one, we're not arguing that a plaintiff\nwould have to come forward and show that every class\nmember was discriminated at that point. Under the\nTeamsters' analysis, there must be proof of a standard\noperating procedure of discrimination.\nHere, it's undisputed that Wal-Mart's\npolicy -- and it wasn't just a written policy; it was\nimplemented and enforced rigorously -- that was\nantidiscrimination. But, Your Honor, you're correct,\nthat each person doesn't have to come forward in phase\none.\nThe big -- the other big problem here is\nthat the district judge said in phase two, under\nTeamsters, Wal-Mart would not be entitled to put on its\nindividual defenses. Women who thought they had a claim\nwould not be able to come forward if a -- in this\nprocess, the paper records suggested they didn't have a\nclaim, and come into court and have their day in court\nand argue that they should be compensated.\nThe plaintiffs are trying to cut off half of\nthe Teamsters' framework, which is fundamental both to\ndue process and to Title VII because Title VII's section\n706(g) states very clearly that only victims of\ndiscrimination may recover.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- what happens\nto the damages claim of an individual woman who is part\nof this class if that class prevails?\nMR. BOUTROUS: If the class prevails, then\nthe -- the claim would be resolved in this manner\nunder -- it's very unclear what the District Court had\nin mind.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would -- would she\nbe eligible for only back pay or compensatory damages as\nwell?\nMR. BOUTROUS: Yes, Your Honor, she would\nonly be eligible for back pay. The plaintiffs retained\ntheir compensatory-\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. Go\nahead.\nMR. BOUTROUS: -- their compensatory damage\nclaims for themselves but waived those for the class\nmembers in order to get a class certified, which I think\nis a fundamental, crucial violation.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All right. But\nwould -- would the -- would the women with a claim for\ncompensatory damages be able to sue that after the class\nprevails in this case?\nMR. BOUTROUS: Our view is that she would\nnot be because that would have been part of the core\nnucleus of facts in the case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even -- even though\nshe could have not received notice and not had an\nopportunity to opt out?\nMR. BOUTROUS: That's the -- that's the\nproblem -- that goes to the problem with this (b)(2)\ncertification, that this case, if it -- if it were going\nto be certified at all, needed to be looked at under\nRule 23(b)(3). Rule 23(b)(3) was -- was created for\nprecisely this sort of circumstance, the growing edge of\nthe law where individualized monetary claims are at\nstake. The -- the language of Rule 23(b)(2) speaks of\ninjunctive and declaratory relief.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, would -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I thought your position was\nthat this could not be certified under Rule 23(b)(3),\neither; is that correct?\nMR. BOUTROUS: Our view is the plaintiffs\nwill -- will not be able to satisfy those -- those\nprovisions, but that's why they brought it under Rule\n23(b)(2), to circumvent the procedural protections of\nsuperiority, predominance, and the like.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Would that bar the\n(b)(2) class? Meaning if their claim is, as they state\nit, that they're seeking injunctive and declaratory\nrelief against a discriminatory impact or -- case or a\npattern and practice case, wouldn't that have value and\nwouldn't that value be, standing alone without the\ndamages component, be that the plaintiffs who come in\nlater have a presumption that discrimination affected\nthem and the burden shifts to Wal-Mart to prove that\nthere was a nondiscriminatory reason?\nMR. BOUTROUS: There certainly could be a\nbenefit from an injunction if -- if the plaintiffs met\nall the standards. The problem here is that the -- the\nindividualized damage claims, the back pay claims,\nengulfed and overwhelm the injunctive relief -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Even if they did, why\ncouldn't you separate out the (b)(2) issue from the\n(b)(3) question of whether monetary damages have enough\ncommon facts and law to warrant a certification under\n(b)(3)?\nMR. BOUTROUS: Your Honor, some courts have\ndone that, looked at the injunctive relief claims under\n-- under the (b)(2) standard and the monetary reliefs\nunder a (b)(3) standard. That can raise other\ncomplications, especially here the plaintiffs are\nseeking punitive damages as well, but that's at least a\npossibility. It would certainly be better than this,\nshoe-horning these monetary relief claims that are so\nindividualized.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, would you address\nthe -- address them separately for me, and tell me why a\n(b)(2) class couldn't exist only on injunctive relief?\nAnd if it can, if you're conceding it can, then is your\nattack merely that the monetary component of this, the\nback pay -- which, you know, I know the dispute on\nwhether that's equitable relief or compensatory relief\nor not -- why that just can't be separated out and put\ninto the (b)(3) claim?\nMR. BOUTROUS: Your Honor, our view is that\nthe injunctive relief claim still has significant\nproblems concerning cohesion, adequacy, typicality,\ncommonality. On the adequacy point, this case includes\nat least 544 store managers who are alleged to be\ndiscriminators and victims. If that's not a conflict\nunder Amchem and the adequacy test in Hansberry v. Lee,\nI don't know what is. The -- the women who are\ncompelled to be in the class -- they can't opt out,\nthey're current employees, they're former employees,\nthey cut across every position in the country, and\nthere's no demonstration that they're being affected in\na common way. So, I think there would still be those\ncommonality, typicality, cohesion problems because of\nthe nature of the plaintiffs' case here, the notion of\nthe common policy being giving -- giving discretion and\n-- and independent judgment.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that -- correct\nme if I'm wrong, but I thought that this district judge\nsaid that -- that the absent class members would get\nnotice and have an opportunity to -- to opt out. So, a\n-- a plaintiff, a member of the class who wants to go\nfor compensation instead of just back pay could opt out.\nMR. BOUTROUS: The district court, Justice\nGinsburg, limited that ruling to the punitive damage\nclaim, and the Ninth Circuit made clear it was viewing\nit that way. It said under its ruling, which sent\npunitive damages back, that would simplify things\nbecause then there wouldn't have to be notice and an\nopportunity to opt out under back pay. And back pay is\nmonetary relief for individuals. To bind people based\non a balancing test under (b)(2) to a judgment to which\nthey were not a party -- in Taylor v. Sturgell, this\nCourt talked about the fundamental rule that an\nindividual is not bound by a judgment to which they're\nnot a party and said we need crisp rules with sharp\ncorners in this area where such a fundamental right is\nat stake. And that's why we think it needs to be Rule\n23(b)(3) when individual monetary relief is at stake.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That begs my question.\nAre you talking about any monetary relief? You're -\nyou're claiming, I'm assuming, that monetary relief\nincludes equitable relief.\nMR. BOUTROUS: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The Fifth Circuit has\ndescribed a test where it doesn't use the predominant\nquestion; it uses the incidental test. What's wrong\nwith that test?\nMR. BOUTROUS: That test is much better than\nthe test that was applied below. The plaintiffs have\nwalked away from the two tests that were applied in the\nlower court. They have never contended they could meet\nthe incidental damages test. And under the Fifth\nCircuit's case, the Allison case, only automatic back\npay that goes to the group as a whole would qualify for\nthat. Here, this is individualized relief.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- that's where I'm\ngoing to. Would you accept that incidental test as\nappropriate to the question of when monetary damages\npredominate or don't?\nMR. BOUTROUS: Your Honor, the text of Rule\n23(b)(2) is very clear. It talks about injunctive and\ndeclaratory relief. The only ambiguity that's created\nis from the advisory committee note, and as this Court\nsaid three weeks ago in the Milner case, we don't look\nto legislative history to try to create ambiguities.\nThe -- the other parts of the advisory committee notes\nmake very clear that the drafters were concerned about\nthe historical antecedents where it was an\ninjunctive-only case to -- of -- to desegregate and the\nlike. I think the drafters of Rule 23(b)(2) would have\nbeen shocked if they had learned that this case that\ninvolves millions of claims for individualized monetary\nrelief were -- were being sought to be included in a\n(b)(2) class.\nThat said, Your Honor, the incidental damage\ntest is -- is I think far superior because it's at least\nclearer and would be closer to a sharp, bright-line\nrule, which is required in this context.\nI'd like to go back briefly to the point I\nmade earlier about individual relief and taking away the\nrights of both Wal-Mart and the absent class members.\nThe procedures that would be used here -- the Ninth\nCircuit proposed a statistical sampling method. The\nplaintiffs do not defend that. They do not mention\nthe Hilao case, which was the cornerstone of the -- the\nNinth Circuit's ruling, which would allow sort of a\nprediction about who might have been hurt, how many\npeople might have been hurt, and then a divvying up of\n-- of moneys based on that.\nThe district court precluded the fundamental\nTeamsters hearings, which would allow, once a\npresumption, if one was to arise, of discrimination\noccurred in a pattern of practice -- would allow the\ndefendant to then show that it didn't discriminate on -\non an individual basis, and it would allow the\nindividuals to come in and have their day in court.\nThat violates Title VII. It violates the Rules Enabling\nAct, and -- and we think it really shows some of the\ncore flaws in this case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if the class\ndoes -- does not prevail; it loses? Does that bar an\nindividual woman at a particular Wal-Mart from bringing\nthese same claims?\nMR. BOUTROUS: Yes, Your Honor. There's a\npresumption in -- in the world of class actions -\nthere's two that I think the plaintiffs are -- are\nrelying on. One is that class actions are always good,\nand the bigger the class action, the better, and that\nthe class will win. None of those presumptions can be\ncounted on. If the plaintiffs lose, and they -- and\nhere their compensatory damages claims, I think, would\nbe gone because the named plaintiffs are asserting them.\nIf they tried to bring a case as pattern or practice or\npay or promotion, there would be significant questions\nof res judicata and collateral estoppel. And it's not\nfair to anyone to put this all into one big class.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But you're not suggesting\nthat they would be precluded on individual\ndiscrimination claims, are you?\nMR. BOUTROUS: No, Your Honor, if they had\nindividual claims that were separate from the nucleus of\noperative facts here, that might pose a different\nquestion.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But what if it were\nthe same theory, that the reason this person was able to\ndiscriminate was because he had total subjective\ndiscretion in his hiring?\nMR. BOUTROUS: Then I -- then there would be\na real problem of collateral estoppel or res judicata,\nYour Honor.\nMr. Chief Justice, I'd like to reserve my\nremaining time for rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. BOUTROUS: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Sellers.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH M. SELLERS\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. SELLERS: Mr. Chief Justice, may it\nplease the Court:\nThis case follows from the -- the Teamsters\nand Watson models of theories of discrimination, and as\na consequence, there is no requirement to have a formal\npolicy of discrimination here. It can be -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What would the\ninjunction look like in this case?\nMR. SELLERS: The injunction would look like\na series of remedial measures that would direct Wal-Mart\nto provide for detailed criteria by which to make pay\nand promotion decisions that are job-related in a way\nthat hasn't been true up until now. It would provide\nfor it to hold managers accountable for the decisions\nthey make; it would ensure effective oversight of the -\nof these pay and promotion decisions in a way that the\ncompany had -- while the company did have, by the way,\ninformation regularly submitted to it about pay\ndecisions, it took no action, and it did not effectively\nmonitor -- allowed these problems to fester.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All right. Is it\nyour position that on this scale subjective\ndecisionmaking processes are necessarily illegal?\nMR. SELLERS: No, not at all, Mr. Chief\nJustice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, if this were -\nhow many stores are we talking about, a thousand stores?\nMR. SELLERS: Several thousand stores.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Several thousand\nstores. How many examples of abuse of the subjective\ndiscrimination delegation need to be shown before you\ncan say that flows from the policy rather than from bad\nactors? I assume with three -- however many thousands\nof stores, you're going to have some bad apples.\nMR. SELLERS: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, we\nhave some examples in the record. As Teamsters -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I know there are\nexamples. How many do you need to have?\nMR. SELLERS: I -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Surely it won't be\n-- if somebody sends one letter in saying the guy at\nthis plant -- is -- plant -- this store is\ndiscriminating, that can't be enough to support your\ntheory.\nMR. SELLERS: That's correct. We don't\nsubmit that. There is no minimum number that this Court\nhas ever set. Teamsters, as an example in Teamsters,\nthe Court had before it about 40 examples, but\nsignificantly they weren't required. In order to\nestablish a pattern and practice of liability -- and we\nhave more than that, of course -- but in order to\nestablish a pattern and practice of liability or at\nleast a prima facie case, Teamsters holds that what you\nneed to do is show that there were disparities\nsufficiently substantial to create an inference of\ndiscrimination with respect to a discrete practice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is it -- is it true\nthat Wal-Mart's pay disparity across the company was\nless than the national average?\nMR. SELLERS: Mr. Chief Justice, the\nposition -- I don't know that that's a fair comparison.\nThe position that Wal-Mart has advanced makes no -- the\ncomparison it makes is with the general population, not\nwith people in retail.\nWal-Mart's obligation under Title VII is to\nensure that its managers do not make pay decisions\nbecause of sex, and the comparison that's relevant is\nbetween men and women at Wal-Mart, not the general\npopulation that includes people in retail, but includes\nrailroad workers and all kinds of other people. That's\nnot the appropriate comparison.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's not clear to me:\nWhat is the unlawful policy that Wal-Mart has adopted,\nunder your theory of the case?\nMR. SELLERS: Justice Kennedy, our theory is\nthat Wal-Mart provided to its managers unchecked\ndiscretion in the way that this Court's Watson decision\naddressed that was used to pay women less than men who\nwere doing the same work in the same -- the same\nfacilities at the same time, even though -- though those\nwomen had more seniority and higher performance, and\nprovided fewer opportunities for promotion than women\nbecause of sex.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's -- it's hard for me\nto see that the -- your complaint faces in two\ndirections. Number one, you said this is a culture\nwhere Arkansas knows, the headquarters knows, everything\nthat's going on. Then in the next breath, you say,\nwell, now these supervisors have too much discretion.\nIt seems to me there's an inconsistency there, and I'm\njust not sure what the unlawful policy is.\nMR. SELLERS: Well, Justice Kennedy, there\nis no inconsistency any more than it's inconsistent\nwithin Wal-Mart's own personnel procedures. The company\nprovides to its managers this discretion, which, by the\nway, is very discrete. It is not the broad kind of -\nwe're not attacking every facet of the pay and promotion\ndecisions. The District Court found specific features\nof the pay and promotion process that are totally\ndiscretionary. There's no guidance whatsoever about how\nto make those decisions.\nBut with respect to the discretion, every\nstore, the District Court found, is provided -- managers\nare provided with the same level of discretion. But the\ncompany also has a very strong corporate culture that\nensures that managers, not just with respect to the\npractices we're challenging, but in all respects, what\nthey call the Wal-Mart way, and the purpose of that is\nto ensure that in these various stores that, contrary to\nwhat Wal-Mart argues, that these are wholly independent\nfacilities, that the decisions of the managers will be\ninformed by the values the company provides to these\nmanagers in training -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, is that disparate\ntreatment?\nMR. SELLERS: It is disparate treatment. It\nis a form of disparate treatment because they are making\nthese decisions because of sex, and they -- and they are\ndoing so with -- we have evidence that we think, through\nthe stereotyping evidence we have here, as well as the\nstatistical results -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't -- I'm getting\nwhipsawed here. On the one hand, you say the problem is\nthat they were utterly subjective, and on the other hand\nyou say there is a -- a strong corporate culture that\nguides all of this. Well, which is it? It's either the\nindividual supervisors are left on their own, or else\nthere is a strong corporate culture that tells them what\nto do.\nMR. SELLERS: Well, Justice Scalia, there is\nthis broad discretion given the managers.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. SELLERS: But they do not make these\ndecisions in a vacuum. They make the decisions within a\ncompany where they are heavily -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, there's no discretion;\nis that what you're saying?\nMR. SELLERS: No, I'm not. I'm suggesting\nthey are given this discretion, but they are informed by\nthe company about how to exercise that discretion. So,\nit's effectively saying -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If somebody tells you how\nto exercise discretion, you don't have discretion.\nMR. SELLERS: Well, all right. That's\nanother -- it's certainly -- the bottom line is, they\ndidn't, and the results show it. There was consistent\ndisparities in every one of the regions, 41 regions.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What do you know about -\nabout the unchallenged fact that the central company had\na policy, an announced policy, against sex\ndiscrimination, so that it wasn't totally subjective at\nthe managerial level? It was, you make these hiring\ndecisions, but you do not make them on the basis of sex.\nWasn't that the central policy of the company?\nMR. SELLERS: That was a written policy.\nThat was not the policy that was effectively\ncommunicated to the managers.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Now, how was -- how was\nthat established?\nMR. SELLERS: Well, what we have, as I said\nbefore, is evidence of -- for instance, at the -- at the\nSam Walton Institute, where every manager has to be\ntrained before they become a manager, they provide as a\nquestion -- a response to a standard question: Why are\nwomen so underrepresented, or so few women in\nmanagement? And the response given was, because men\nseek advancement, are more aggressive in seeking\nadvancement.\nNow, that's a typical, stereotypical\nstatement provided to every person going through the\nmanagement training program, that they then go off and\ninform -- that informs their decisions when they make -\nwhen they have this discretion to make promotions.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that causes them\nintentionally to discriminate on the basis of sex?\nMR. SELLERS: That's -- that is -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That causes -- how could\nthat possibly cause them to intentionally discriminate\non the basis of sex?\nMR. SELLERS: Well, they -- they have -\nthey have an intent to take sex into account in making\ntheir decisions; that is -- that is, they apply a\nstereotype about that women are less aggressive when it\ncomes to assessing their suitability for promotions.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That -- that's just an\nassessment of why the percentage is different. They\ndiffer not only at Wal-Mart, but at -- throughout the\nindustry. To say that that's the explanation is not to\ntell your people: Don't promote women.\nMR. SELLERS: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If you have an aggressive\nwoman, promote her.\nMR. SELLERS: I understand that, and there\nwere -- there have been women promoted. But Justice\nScalia, first of all, we think that that is -- the\nquestions you are raising are ones that Wal-Mart can\nraise at trial. The question at this juncture is\nwhether there are -- there are questions common to the\nclass.\nWe've identified what has been recognized as\na -- a common policy, that there's no dispute this\npolicy applies throughout the company. And the fact\nthat we, at this juncture, are -- I mean, and we have\nshown, as we think we have to in order to satisfy\ncommonality, that there are disparities adverse to\nwomen. And we have the means to show, through the\ntestimony of Dr. Bielby and other evidence, that we can\nprovide this -- connect these two through -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Have you sufficiently\nshown -- despite the fact of an explicit written central\npolicy of no discrimination against women, do you think\nyou've adequately shown that that policy is a fraud, and\nthat what's really going on is that there is a\ncentral -- a central policy that promotes discrimination\nagainst women? Do you really think -\nMR. SELLERS: We -- we have testimony in the\nrecord from the vice president of the company that that\npolicy was lip service at the company. We have\ntestimony from -- from the expert in this case -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't this something that\nwould be -- I mean, this -- we're not just talking about\ngetting your foot in the door. We're talking about\ncertifying the class, and you may well lose on every one\nof these points, but -- but the 23(a) standards, they're\nnot supposed to be very difficult to overcome. It's\njust a common question of fact -\nMR. SELLERS: That is -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that dominates at\nthat -\nMR. SELLERS: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But what seems to me is a\nvery serious problem in this case is: How do you work\nout the back pay? You say -- we get through the 23(a)\nthreshold. We got class certified under 23(b)(2). And\nthe judge says, there's no way I could possibly try each\nof these individuals. So, we're going to do it how?\nHow are they going to calculate the back pay?\nMR. SELLERS: Well, the -- the approach that\nthe District Court endorsed, an approach we recommended,\nand which has been endorsed by seven circuits over a\nperiod of 40 years, is in circumstances here -- like\nhere, which are, admittedly, the exception to the rule,\nwhere the company had no standards by which to make\npromotion and pay decisions, they had kept no records of\nwho -- the reasons for people being promoted and the\nreasons why they pay people certain amounts, that as a\nconsequence of that, the Albemarle decision and the\nTeamsters decision make clear that the obligation of the\nDistrict Court upon finding of liability is to attempt\nto reconstruct the decisions that would have been made\nin the absence of discrimination.\nAnd the District Court found here -- and we\nsubmit it's not clearly erroneous -- that the more\nreliable method for doing so is to use a formula relying\non Wal-Mart's robust database in which it captures\nperformance, seniority, and a host of other job-related\nvariables, factors that bear on pay and promotion\ndecisions, and permits a comparison, a very precise\ncomparison, in a way that having individual hearings\nrelying on hazy memories, post hoc rationalizations,\ndoesn't.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if you had a\nsituation where you had a company with a very clear\npolicy in favor of equal treatment of men and women?\nYou know, the answer to your -- the answer to your\nquestion was women don't have as many positions because\nmanagers discriminate against them in -- in hiring and\nin promotion, yet you still have the same subjective\ndelegation system.\nCould you have a class of women who were\nharmed by this subjective policy, even though it was\nclear that the policy of the corporation favored equal\nemployment opportunity?\nMR. SELLERS: Well, I think if the -- if\nthere were -- as clear as your hypothetical suggest,\nthat the company had a policy of that sort, it would be\nappropriate for it to seek summary judgment.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no, no, they\nstill -- well, then you're saying it is not enough that\nit be a subjective decision. This company has a\nthousand stores, and sure enough in a thousand stores\nyou're going to be able to find a goodly number who\naren't following the company's policy, who are\nexercising their subjective judgment in a way that\nviolates the right to equal treatment.\nCouldn't you bring a class of people\nsubjective to discrimination as a result of that\nsubjective policy?\nMR. SELLERS: You could bring a class case\non behalf -- if I understand your hypothetical -- on\nbehalf of women -- I'm sorry -- who were subject to\ndiscrimination as a consequence of that unchecked\ndiscretion.\nI -- I want to be clear that we shouldn't\nlose sight of the fact that we have evidence here of\nresults from this that are, that are really\nextraordinary.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is the -- is the common\nquestion of law or fact whether, given the training\nwhich central management knew -\nMR. SELLERS: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- given the facts about\nwhat people say and how they behave, many of which\ncentral management knew, and given the results which\ncentral management knew or should have known, should\ncentral management under the law have withdrawn some of\nthe subjective discretion in order to stop these\nresults?\nMR. SELLERS: That -- that is a fair way to\nput it.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If that is a fair way to\nput it, is that a question that every one of the women\nin this class shares in common?\nMR. SELLERS: I -- I believe so, Justice\nBreyer, because they've all been the subject in every\none of these stores to this very broad discretion.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The district judge didn't\nthink so. Didn't the district judge say that in\nawarding back pay some would get a windfall and others\nwould be uncompensated?\nMR. SELLERS: Actually, Justice Ginsburg,\nI -- I think the district judge did not find that. What\nhe found was that the formula, and I can assure you the\nformula we intend -- would tend -- tend to use is a\nregression analysis that would permit a comparison\nbetween each woman and the amount she was paid and\nsimilarly situated men, taking into account, as I said,\nperformance and seniority and the like, and you will\nfind there are women that were not underpaid and the\nformula will show that they should get no back pay.\nI think that the district court -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought -- I thought\nhis point was not simply that some women were not\nunderpaid, but women, if you had an individual case, the\nemployer might show this person could have been fired,\ndisciplined, and wasn't owed any back pay, not that she\ncompares favorably to a -- a male peer, but that she\nwouldn't have gotten any pay at all.\nMR. SELLERS: Well, Justice Ginsburg, the\nkind of factors that are entered into this -- this\neconomic model, performance in particular, should\ncapture whether somebody should have been fired.\nThat -- that is a very important part of the model here\nthat permits people to -- and we found -- the evidence\nshows that women were, in fact -- had higher performance\nthan men and were nonetheless still underpaid.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can I just say something\nhere? Doesn't your class include both those women who\nwere underpaid and both -- and those women who weren't\nunderpaid?\nMR. SELLERS: That's -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Doesn't your class include\nboth?\nMR. SELLERS: As every -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is that commonality?\nMR. SELLERS: As every class does, Justice\nScalia. Every class has some portion of its members who\nare not harmed by the discrimination. As the Teamsters\ncase recognized, what is common about them is they were\nall subject to the same highly discretionary\ndecisionmaking, even if some of them weren't harmed by\nit. That still presents a question common to the class.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, correct me if I'm\nwrong, I thought the Teamsters case was an action by the\ngovernment that wasn't a class action case.\nMR. SELLERS: That -- that is correct, but\nit -- it -- it is the paradigm we use for determining\nwhat you need to establish a pattern or practice of\ndiscrimination.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Pattern or practice,\nthat's correct.\nHelp me, if you can, with this. Let's -\nlet's suppose that experts' testimony, sociologists and\nso forth, establish that in industry generally and in\nretail industry generally, women still are discriminated\nagainst by a mathematical factor of X. You have a\ncompany that has a very specific policy against\ndiscrimination, and you look at their -- the way their\nemployees are treatment -- are treated, and you find a\ndisparity by that same mathematical factor X, does that\ngive you a cause of action?\nMR. SELLERS: If the -- I'm sorry -- if\nthe -- it, the disparity -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The -- the -- the\ndisparity with -- that women are subjected to are the\nsame in the company as they are -\nMR. SELLERS: Outside the company.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- society wide, but the\ncompany does have a policy against discrimination.\nMR. SELLERS: Right. I -- I would say that\nthe company's responsibility under Title VII is to\nensure its managers do not make pay and promotion\ndecisions because of sex. If the comparison between the\npay women receive, for instance, who are similarly\nsituated to men within the company is such that they are\nunderpaid compared to similarly situated men in the\ncompany, then -- then the company would have legal\nresponsibility under Title VII, regardless of what\nhappens in the rest of the industry, what happens in the\nrest of the world.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Would that be true even if\nyou could not show deliberate indifference?\nMR. SELLERS: Well, I don't know that the -\nthe respect that the standard is deliberate\nindifference. I think that under this Court's decision\nin Heller -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Where there's no\ndeliberate indifference and a specific policy\nprohibiting the discrimination, can you still proceed?\nMR. SELLERS: I -- well, I would submit you\nstill can proceed. If -- if the policy -- announcing a\npolicy saying don't discriminate were to be effective\nin -- in immunizing companies against liability in class\nactions, imagine every company in the country would\npublish that policy and have free license to go\ndiscriminate as much as it wanted to.\nJUSTICE ALITO: I understand your answer to\nJustice Kennedy's question to be that this typical\ncompany would be in violation of Title VII; is that\ncorrect?\nMR. SELLERS: That's correct.\nJUSTICE ALITO: That's what the -- and\nthat's what the academic literature on which your theory\nis based includes; isn't that right?\nMR. SELLERS: With -- Justice Alito, I think\nit's not just academic literature, I think it's the\nprecedents from this Court. I think that's the -\nthat's the premise behind Teamsters, that the -- you\nlook to in Hazelwood, which makes very clear that you\ndon't look to populations outside the company in making\ncomparisons.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So, you have the company\nthat is absolutely typical of the entire American\nworkforce, and let's say every single -- there weren't\nany variations. Every single company had exactly the\nsame profile. Then you would say every single company\nis in violation of Title VII?\nMR. SELLERS: It -- that could very well be\nthe case. If -- if the -- I think that Title VII holds\ncompanies responsible for the actions they take with\nrespect to their employees. There certainly are\nindustries, and there were 30 years -- many more 30 or\n40 years ago when Teamsters was decided, where the\nentire industry might have had evidence of\ndiscrimination. That would not -- there is not a\nnegligence standard under this statute that immunizes\ncompanies because they follow the same standards as\nothers.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what -- what -\nwhat's -- what's your answer assumes is if there is a\ndisparity between the advancement of women and the\nadvancement of men, it can only be attributed to sex\ndiscrimination -\nMR. SELLERS: No.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, otherwise, how could\nyou say that all -- all of the companies are -- are -\nare presumptively engaging in sex discrimination?\nMR. SELLERS: Well, Justice Scalia, I --\nI -- I want to deal with the -- in this instance, we\nhave -- it's not just any old analysis that we're -\nthat we're using. We have statistical regression\nanalysis that isolates and takes into account the\nfactors such as performance and -- and seniority.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: See, I wasn't talking about\nthis case. I was talking about your answer to Justice\nAlito -\nMR. SELLERS: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- which said that, you\nknow, it may well be that every industry in the United\nStates is guilty of sex discrimination -\nMR. SELLERS: Well, I -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- unless there -- you\nknow, there -- there's equality of promotion for men and\nwomen.\nMR. SELLERS: No, I -- I don't -- I don't\ntake that position, Justice Scalia. What I was trying\nto make clear is that the fact that there are other\ncompanies in the same industry where the same problems\nmay arise, which, by the way, wasn't true here, where\nWal-Mart was behind the other large retailers, doesn't\nmean that a company is any less liable for the\ndiscrimination practiced in its own workplace.\nI can't speak for the rest of society, I\ndon't have any reason to think the entire society is\nengaging in employment discrimination.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Sellers, could I take\nyou back to the remedial question here -\nMR. SELLER: Yes.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: -- and when you think it is\nthat individualized hearings are required? You've\ndescribed a kind of formula that you would use. When -\nwhen -- when is the formula approach right and when is\nthe individual hearings approach right?\nMR. SELLERS: Well, I think it's a -- it's a\ncall that, of course, we leave -- we should leave to the\ndistrict court in the first instance, but factors that\ncould weigh in the balance would include whether or not\nyou have available the kind of information that we do\nhere from database with which to be able to more\nreliably construct the -- the kinds of decisions that\nwould have been made in the absence of discrimination.\nLikewise, there may be companies where they\nhave kept better records or kept any records or have\nmore substantial standards that would permit the\nreconstruction of those decisions through individual\nhearings. I don't think this is something that -- I'm\nnot contending that under -- that you could always use a\nformula-like approach in connection with these cases.\nThis is an extraordinary case with evidence that is -\nthat they have kept really no standards and no records.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought, didn't the\ndistrict judge say because of the numbers we couldn't -\ncouldn't possibly have the hearing in each case on\nwhether the particular woman was owed back pay? They\ndid say something about this.\nMR. SELLERS: The district -- I'm sorry, the\ndistrict court did make the comment that the sheer\nnumber of class members would make the administration of\nindividual hearings difficult, but the district court\nwent on, very importantly -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought he said\n\"impossible.\"\nMR. SELLERS: Sorry?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought he said more\nthan difficult.\nMR. SELLERS: Well, he may have said\nimpossible, but the important point is that he went -\nthe district court went ahead and made specific findings\nabout the extent to which the -- the particular record\nhere shows that the use of a formula would be more\nreliable than individualized hearings.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I'm -- I'm a\nlittle confused, all right?\nMR. SELLERS: Okay.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because you're saying an\nindividualized hearing is impossible, but that's exactly\nwhat you're saying you're going to do, only through\nstatistics.\nMR. SELLERS: That's -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're going to say\nthrough my statistical model, I will be able to identify\nthose women in the class who are deserving of pay\nraises. What that doesn't answer is when in this\nprocess is the defendant going to be given an\nopportunity to defend against that finding?\nMR. SELLERS: Right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because you're -- are\nyou suggesting that the district court would\nappropriately bar a defendant where there's no proof of\nintentionality with respect to not keeping records, that\nit was intended to stop these women from collecting\nmoney, et cetera? When are they going to get a chance?\nMR. SELLERS: Well -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And if they're going to\nget a chance, isn't that an individualized hearing?\nMR. SELLERS: Yes. Effectively Wal-Mart\nwill have ample opportunity through the arguments over\nwhich variables which to use. There was a very robust\ndebate below already about which variables to use, that\nwill have a significant impact on whether women are\nshown to be underpaid or underpromoted compared to men.\nSo, Wal-Mart will have that opportunity, and frankly -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, no, no. That sounds\nlike you're saying their only opportunity will be on the\nmodel.\nMR. SELLERS: I'm -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They will be precluded\nfrom attempting to show any particular evidence that a\nparticular decision was not made?\nMR. SELLERS: If Wal-Mart -- if Wal-Mart,\nJustice Sotomayor, if a Wal-Mart comes forward below and\nit hasn't done so, so far, and is able to persuade the\ndistrict court that it can, consistent with some kind\nof -- in a way that's consistent with a reliable\ndetermination of who should have been paid what and\npromoted in the absence of discrimination -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're not answering me.\nMR. SELLERS: I'm trying to.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're -- what you're\nsaying is we're going to preclude them from doing\nanything but offering a mathematical model -\nMR. SELLERS: I'm -- I'm -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- because otherwise\nit's going to be too hard to have individual hearings.\nMR. SELLERS: I -- I'm -- let me answer you\ndirectly. I'm not saying that. Wal-Mart has an\nopportunity to make the case that with whatever showing\nit wishes to make it can reconstruct these decisions\nmore reliably, and in an entirely subjective\nenvironment, and if it does, it can offer evidence in\ncertain circumstances; but it hasn't done so; and I\ndon't submit it's going to be able to do so here.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This -- this takes\nevidence, to establish that -- that it's more reliable\nto have a hearing with evidence on the particular\npromotion or dismissal of the individual, that that is\nmore reliable than using -- I don't care how admirable a\nstatistical guess you make; I mean is that really a\nquestion?\nMR. SELLERS: I think it is, Justice Scalia,\nbecause the -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We must have a pretty bad\njudicial system then.\nMR. SELLERS: Well, I think it's not the\njudicial system, it's the recordkeeping of the company,\nand the standardlessness of its -- of the pay and\npromotion processes that basically mean 10 years later,\nthese managers are going to be coming forward to\nspeculate about what they did 10 years earlier, with no\nrecords to cross-examine them on. That is not the -\nthe model for a reliable adjudication.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We should use that in jury\ntrials, too, for really old cases. We should just put a\nstatistical model before the jury and say, you know,\nthis stuff is too old; so, we'll -\nMR. SELLERS: Well -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- we'll do it on the basis\nof -- is this really due process?\nMR. SELLERS: I -- Justice Scalia, I submit\nit is; and the circuits that have been considering this\nfor 40 years have so held. In the narrow set of\ncircumstances that we have here, where there are\nstandardless, recordless decisions at issue.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if it's standardless\nand -- and recordless, then why is there commonality?\nIt seems to me that what you -- your answer that you\njust gave really is a -- shows a flaw in your case on\ncommonality.\nMR. SELLERS: No, Justice Kennedy, the -\nthe standardless and recordless aspect is with respect\nto trying to reconstruct these decisions years later.\nAs I said before, we have a common policy here; it\npresents a common question. We've shown evidence that\nwould probably create a prima facie case of pattern or\npractice under Teamsters, and we think we've satisfied\nthe three components of commonality that we think need\nto be addressed.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: One thing you haven't\ntouched on is to -- to have, first of all the question\nof whether (b)(2) is limited to injunction and\ndeclaratory relief.\nMR. SELLERS: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But if -- if you follow\nthe advisory committee's note, then if dollars -- if\ndamages predominates -- if damages predominate, then you\ncan't use (b)(2). You have to make your case under\n(b)(3); and the one factor here is that about half the\nclass is gone, so -- they're not interested in\ninjunctive relief, but everybody's interested in money.\nSo, why isn't the money -- why do you say that the -\nthat the injunction -- injunctive relief is the thing\nand the damages are lesser, rather than the other way\naround?\nMR. SELLERS: Well -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In fact it's more than half\nthe class that's gone, isn't it?\nMR. SELLERS: Well, I don't -- nobody knows\nthat, because they continue to have more employees\nadding -- added at the company. So, I wouldn't\npresume -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But nobody's leaving yet.\nMR. SELLERS: Well, there are people\nleaving, but the point -- but more importantly, the\nadvisory committee note with respect to Rule 23(b)(2)\nmakes clear that there is a -- that the -- whether or\nnot an action or inaction is taken with respect to the\nclass which is the predicate to (b)(2) certification, it\ndepends on -- it doesn't depend on the number of people\nwho are adversely affected by that action.\nAnd so, as a consequence where the former\nemployees are -- that they -- if they would be included\nin the class under (b)(2) because that -- the question\nis not on a day-to-day basis who should have been in a\nposition to seek injunctive relief and who's employed\nand who's not.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. SELLERS: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Boutrous, you\nhave 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE J. BOUTROUS, JR.,\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. BOUTROUS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nLet me begin with this question of back pay\nbecause Mr. Sellers has made clear under their vision\nWal-Mart would never have an opportunity to prove that\nit didn't discriminate against a woman who was seeking\nback pay; and the district court did not suggest that it\nmight be difficult, as Mr. Sellers suggested. The\ndistrict court, as Justice Ginsburg suggested, said that\nhe found it would be impossible; not just because of the\nnumber of people, but because of the nature of the\nclaims, that discretionary decisions were being\nimplemented in a way that affected different people\ndifferently.\nThe -- the problem here Mr. Sellers says is\nthat the records are not available. Then he says we're\ngoing to have a -- a proceeding where the district judge\nrelies only on the records, that he says are inadequate,\nto allow a reconstruction of the decision. That is not\na process known to our jurisprudence. It doesn't\ncomport with due process. It takes away Wal-Mart's\nrights under Title VII; it injures the rights of the\nindividual women, who the record -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You don't -- you don't\nseriously contend that if a plaintiff, if a policy were\nfound or practice of discrimination that a woman\ncouldn't come in and say they put X in, I had a longer\nhistory at Wal-Mart, I had far superior job ratings, I\nhad no criticisms of my work, and I wasn't promoted.\nWouldn't that be enough for her to show that that policy\ninfluenced her lack of selection?\nMR. BOUTROUS: I agree with you, Justice\nSotomayor. Except -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And your personal\ndatabase has all that information. So, why is it\nimpossible to try these cases other than because of\ntheir large numbers? That's a different issue.\nMR. BOUTROUS: Yes, Your Honor, what you've\njust outlined, we agree that a woman should be able to\ncome in and say that, and she may say well, the records\ndon't show what really happened. I -- I had more\nexperience; I was a much better employee than the guy\nworking next to me. Under the plaintiff's theory in\norder to get a class here, they have thrown that out the\nwindow; that woman would not be able to come and\ntestify. Wal-Mart wouldn't be able to say this person\nwas a terrible employee, this person was a great\nemployee. On the record, it's not impossible to\nrecreate these decisions. The record is filled with\ndeclarations from managers who remember very well that\nMs. Dukes violated company policy, that Ms. Arana was\nfired for infractions regarding how she kept her hours.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If you just spend one\nsecond, remember my question. We've got a common issue.\nWhy isn't that enough at least to support a (b)(2)\ninjunctive action?\nMR. BOUTROUS: Your Honor, the -- the\nscenario you outline -- there's no dispute about the\npolicies that existed at the time, that there were -\nJUSTICE BREYER: That sounds like the merits\nyou're getting to. His point, remember, is this is just\ncertification. So, my question is: Assuming they can\nsupport it with evidence, why can't they have their\n(b)(2) class, at least on an injunctive relief?\nMR. BOUTROUS: Because, Your Honor, the -\nthe common policy is one that affects everyone\ndifferently by definition. Therefore, these plaintiffs\nare not typical, and they are not arguing that everyone\nwas affected the same way by the common policy. Many\nwomen thrived. Maybe some men stereotyped or some women\nstereotyped the other direction. Five hundred and\nforty-four of the plaintiffs are female store managers.\nSo, it's impossible to make these sweeping\ngeneralizations, which, of course, is what stereotyping\nis supposed to prevent. And so, it's -- there's\nabsolutely no way there can be a fair process here.\nOn the policy question, the policy -- the\nplaintiffs point to the general policies and the central\ncontrol, but the one policy they do not want to confront\nis the policy against discrimination. It was not just a\nwritten policy on paper.\nIn fact, the -- there's a declaration at\npage 1576 of the Joint Appendix that lays out the very\naggressive efforts the company -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What about the vice\npresident that said it was just window dressing or\nsomething like that?\nMR. BOUTROUS: I'm glad you asked about\nthat, Justice Scalia. Here's what he said. He\ntestified about the diversity goals of the company at\nthe time, the effort to get more women into management,\nand he said in his view, until the company linked\ndiversity goals to compensation of managers, it would be\nlip service.\nHe wasn't saying the whole program was lip\nservice. He was one of the advocates for diversity in\nthe company. He wanted to be more aggressive. He said\nhis -- his goals were 20 percent and other people's were\n10. So -- so, it's completely misleading to suggest he\nwas -- he was denigrating the entire policy.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I think he's just making\nyour -- their point, which is if they started paying\nwomen the same as men, they might get more diversity.\nMR. BOUTROUS: They do pay the same as men,\nYour Honor. The record reflects that.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that's the whole\nissue that's in dispute.\nMR. BOUTROUS: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
