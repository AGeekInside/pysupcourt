SACKS\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. SACKS: Justice Stevens, and may it please the\nCourt:\nWith the Court's permission, the State of New York,\nas amicus, will address issues related to the Treaty of Buffalo\nCreek and I will address the other reasons why aboriginal title\nand other Indian possessory rights to the properties at issue\nwere extinguished long before the Oneida Indian Nation purchased\nthe properties in 1997 and 1998.\nThe asserted basis for tax immunity in this case\nappears at page 1 of respondent's brief which is that the\nOneidas have at all times held a tribal possessory right in the\nproperties. But even if there was a tribal possessory right,\naboriginal title or under the Treaty of Canandaigua, in 1805 and\n1807 when these properties passed out of tribal hands, the\npassage of 190 years has extinguished that right. For 190\nyears, these properties have been in private non-Indian hands,\nhave been freely alienable, have been transferred to innumerable\ninnocent purchasers and have been subject to the full panoply of\nstate and local laws including taxation.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, is it your position that\nwhenever an Indian transfers land in violation of the\nNonintercourse Act, that that's a valid transfer? And if not,\nwhy is this different?\nMR. SACKS: No. It is not our position that that\nwould be a valid transfer if there was a violation of the\nNonintercourse Act. The principal issue here is whether, after\nof the passage of 190 years, there remains a possessory right.\nIf there was a violation of a Nonintercourse Act in 1805 and\n1807, Justice Kennedy, we believe the Oneida Indian Nation has a\n-- under this Court's decision in Oneida II -- a federal common\nlaw damage suit against New York State or against the United\nStates of America for failing to exercise its fiduciary duty.\nBut after 190 years, in 1997, they did not have a possessory\nright to these properties.\nThe possessory right we're talking about, aboriginal\ntitle or some other tribal possessory right, isn't just a\nconcept. As this Court has defined aboriginal title of those\npossessory rights, it's a right to current possession. And\nunder this Court's decisions in cases such as Felix versus\nPatrick and Yankton Sioux, and Williams and Mitchell and Santa\nFe, all of which were cited in the dissent written by Justice\nStevens, for the, for members of dissent in Oneida II, tribal\npossessory rights are barred by that passage of time, the change\nin the character of the land and the innumerable innocent\npurchasers.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why does not having a possessory\nright mean that the city could tax them, or the State?\nMR. SACKS: The basis for the tax immunity here is\nthat this land does not have Indian country status. For this\nland to have Indian country status, it has to be, in our view,\nunder this Court's Venetie decision, Federal set-asides and\nFederal superintendence.\nIf you look at how the Oneida Indian nation got this\nland in 1997, it wasn't because of any set-aside by the Federal\nGovernment in 1794, even if there was, and I will get to that\nlater.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, I'm just thinking, that suppose\nyou have a reservation but the tribe doesn't have a possessory\nright because in the middle of the reservation, there is some\nkind of long-term lease or a sale to a house that's owned by\nsomebody else who is not a member of the tribe. I would think\n-- am I right that the city or the county in which that\nreservation sits can't tax it anyway?\nMR. SACKS: Right. I absolutely agree with you.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. So if you were to say\nthe tribe does not have a possessory right, they can't go in and\neject all the people who are living there and built houses over\nthe last 192 years. That doesn't mean still that you could tax\nthem.\nMR. SACKS: But your hypothetical, Your Honor,\npresupposed the existence of the reservation and presupposed a\npossessory right subject to lease. The possessory right here\ndid not exist because the Oneida Indian nation had no rights\nwith respect to the land at all in 1997. Those rights could not\nbe enforced. And for the right not to be --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, they couldn't be enforced\nagainst certain innocent purchasers but when the land is\nreacquired, then it seems to me we have to ask whether there was\nan extinction of aboriginal title and whether the reservation\nwas at some point subsequently disestablished by federal act.\nAnd if we hold against you on the ground that there was no\nextinction of aboriginal title and there was no disestablishment\nof the reservation, then it seems to me that when they\nreacquire, we get to exactly the point that Justice Breyer\nraises and that is, once they reacquire the land, why does it\nbecome taxable? Why does its nontaxable status not simply\nreassert itself?\nMR. SACKS: I think that you have to look at the\ndefinition of Indian country. If you look at the definition of\nIndian country, it requires, with respect to the properties\nwe're talking about, federal set-aside and federal\nsuperintendence.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So you're saying if the original\nestablishment of the reservation was simply a continuation, was\nliterally a reservation from a transfer of land to the State of\nNew York and that the Indian title was a purely aboriginal\ntitle, not a title conferred by a federal act creating a\nreservation, that it cannot be Indian country, is that correct?\nMR. SACKS: If I understand the question that you\nasked, Your Honor, if the title came from the State of New York,\nfor example, in the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Let's assume the title is\naboriginal. Nothing in an act of the United States says we're\ngiving this land to the Indians, e.g., in the Kansas situation.\nIt's simply aboriginal title and it was never extinguished.\nAre you saying that if that is the source of the\ntitle as opposed to a federal act saying we give this to you,\nthat it cannot be Indian country?\nMR. SACKS: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Okay.\nMR. SACKS: No. In a situation where there was\ncontinuing aboriginal title, similar to the Senecas in the State\nof New York where New York State did not terminate the\naboriginal rights of the Senecas, there need not be\ncongressional act, there need not be congressional or treaty\naction to establish the reservation.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So this part of your argument\ndepends on our accepting your position on the Treaty of Fort\nSchuyler as being a conveyance of all property and a later\nretrocession, is that correct?\nMR. SACKS: No, Your Honor\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Because otherwise, I don't see\nwhat extinguished the aboriginal title.\nMR. SACKS: What extinguished the aboriginal title\nwith respect to this aspect of the argument, and then I will\nmove on to the Treaty of Fort Schuyler and the Treaty of\nCanandaigua. What extinguished the aboriginal title is the\npassage of time and the fact that this land has been under state\nand local jurisdiction for 190 years and this Court observed, in\nHagen and Rosebud Sioux, and I acknowledge it was in a different\ncontext, but this is important, that stable rules of\njurisdiction and sovereignty are important in situations like\nthis where what we're dealing with is very few -- 1 percent of\nthe land in the City of Sherrill is owned by the tribe.\nThe land is predominantly non-Indian. And as this\nCourt observed in Hagen and Rosebud Sioux, a finding that the\nland now comes back into tribal jurisdiction, to paraphrase,\nseriously disrupts the justifiable expectations of the community\nand that's not just a hypothetical in this case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I know that, but I mean, then it\nseems to me if one thing that Oneida establishes is that the whole\ntitle doesn't just disappear if nothing else happens, simply\nbecause of the passage of time.\nMR. SACKS: I think what disappears, Your Honor\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is what?\nMR. SACKS: -- is the right to possess.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now we agree with that or I'll\nhypothetically agree with that. They can't come in and eject\npeople. But then I'm back to my first question, because I take\nit that the refusal in Oneida to the suggestion that they can't\ngo, say, to Buffalo, New York, or wherever, or some town and\nthrow everybody out of the house, that that, of course, does\nreflect the passage of time. But for a city or State to tax the\nland, that doesn't involve the same kind of interference with\npeople's expectation of living in the houses that they bought,\nthat throwing someone out of his house would involve.\nMR. SACKS: Here's what impacts the expectations.\nWhat impacts the expectations is the following. I'll give you\nan example that appears from the joint appendix on the Court of\nAppeals from pages 1263 to 1277.\nIn the year 2000, the City of Oneida cited two\nOneida Indian Nation businesses, a convenience store and a gas\nstation, for 16 fire code violations. The tribe citing this\nCourt's decision in Brendale said, we're not governed by the\nlocal fire code. We're governed by tribal jurisdiction. It's\nmore than just the interference, the issue of taxation, the\nissue of sovereignty is whether a gas station is going to blow\nup or burn down --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: It is a matter, is it not, of\nwhether the tribe now has sovereignty over this parcel of land?\nIs that's what's at the bottom of the question?\nMR. SACKS: I think in terms of the problems for the\ncitizens of the City of Sherrill, taxation is part of it, and\nsovereignty is part of it, and they go hand in hand.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: If the tribe has sovereign --\nsovereignty status with regard to this property, then presumably\nthe city can't tax it. So we have to decide that, do we?\nMR. SACKS: Yes, you do, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: All right. Now what do we do\nwith the Oneida II case decided in 1985?\nMR. SACKS: This, the position we're taking here is\nfully consistent with Oneida II. In Oneida II, this Court held\nthat there was a violation of federal common law principally\nbecause of a violation of the Nonintercourse -- Indian Trade and\nIntercourse Act in 1795. This Court wasn't asked to deal with,\nat that time, with the Treaty of Fort Schuyler. It wasn't asked\nto deal with the Treaty of Buffalo Creek. It wasn't presented\nwith evidence of the numerous authorized New York State treaties\nin 1840 through 1846 that diminished this reservation, that the\nState of New York will deal with -- with as amicus --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why not? Why not? Why not? I\nmean, is every decision we make up for review when the\ninterested parties fail to cite the, what they now assert are\nthe dispositive acts?\nMR. SACKS: No, Your Honor. I think that principles\nof stare decisis still govern and I think what, and this is\nconsistent with the position that we have taken with respect to\nthe passage of time extinguishing the possessory right, is what\nthis Court for stare decisis purposes found in Oneida II was\nthat there was a violation of federal common law with respect to\na transfer that was very different than this transfer, without\nany examination of the Treaty of Buffalo Creek and without any\nexamination of the Treaty of Fort Schuyler.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But there wouldn't have been a\nviolation of federal law if this were not Indian country, if\nthis were not an Oneida reservation when the transfer occurred.\nMR. SACKS: Your Honor, that might or might not be\ncorrect, depending on how one views the scope of the\nNonintercourse Act. But if one views the scope of the\nNonintercourse Act to apply to Indian reservations, even state\nreservations, as the Second Circuit in Mohican Tribe has held,\nthen the Treaty of Fort Schuyler could have terminated all\naboriginal title; The Treaty of Fort Schuyler could have\nestablished a state reservation for the Oneidas; and the\nNonintercourse Act of 1790, two years later, could have\nprohibited the sale of those lands even though it was a state\nreservation and under state jurisdiction.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is that the application of the\nNonintercourse Act? I assume it applied only to federal act\nreservations.\nMR. SACKS: Well, this Court has not dealt with that\nissue and from our purposes --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How does it read? What does it\nsay?\nMR. SACKS: The Nonintercourse Act\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I didn't mean to interrupt\nyou.\nMR. SACKS: The Nonintercourse Act in effect at the\ntime prohibited the purchase made -- prohibited the purchase of\nlands from Indians or Indian tribes, to paraphrase. And that\nwould have, and what hasn't --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Unless made by treaty or\nconvention entered into pursuant to the Constitution.\nMR. SACKS: Yes. Yes , unless -- unless -- unless\nsubject to federal approval.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: An idea of precisely what's at\nstake within the Oneida litigation, as I understand it, the\ncounties and the municipalities, the City of Sherrill\nwould not be left in the end having to pay; New York would.\nMR. SACKS: The City of Sherrill is not a party in\nthe land claim litigation. The land claim litigation --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, from the county's point of\nview, I'm asking who pays at the end of the line. And it seems,\nin the Oneida cases, it's the State. Is it different here? And\nwhat taxes are we talking about precisely?\nMR. SACKS: What we are talking about -- to answer\nthe first portion of your question, Justice Ginsburg, I think\nultimately the citizens of the State of New York pay but it is,\nthe judgment would be against either the State of New York or\nthe against the counties in the land claim. In this case --.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What goes with the taxes? You've\nsaid that the other effect will be that whenever the Oneidas buy\na piece of property that is within this former reservation, and\nof which only 1 percent is now owned by Indians, whenever they\nbuy a piece of property, that property is taken off the tax\nrolls.\nMR. SACKS: Correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Which, of course, makes it a lot\neasier for them to buy it because it's much less expensive for\nthem to hold that land. What else happens? The --\nMR. SACKS: What else happens is that\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The town can't regulate.\nMR. SACKS: The town can't regulate it and if they\nare running a business on it, and we believe this is contrary to\nstate law, but if they are running a business on it they're not\ncollecting sales taxes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And I assume it also means that\nthat land cannot be repurchased by non-Indians?\nMR. SACKS: The tribe has changed its position on\nthat, I believe, in the course of the last 30 years but that is\ntheir current position. That it becomes subject to the\nNonintercourse Act consistent with their position.\nWith the Court's permission, I want to, I do want\nturn to the 1788 Treaty of Fort Schuyler and, time permitting,\nthe 1794 Treaty of Canandiagua. Our position on the treaty of\nFort Schuyler I think is very plain in our papers and I just\nwant to highlight what's in the rest of the treaty after\nArticle 1, which is a cessionable land. What's in the rest of\nthe treaty is that New York reserved numerous rights even with\nrespect to the reservation's land. New York had, among other\nthings, the right to make and apply laws to the reservation, to\nenforce the treaty -- and I'm quoting from Article 4 -- in such\nmanner as the State shall deem proper.\nNew York had the right to enforce its criminal laws\nwith respect to intruders on the reservation that New York\ngranted to the Oneidas obtaining the assistance of the Oneidas\nto do so. New York, in the treaty, prohibited the Oneidas from\nselling the lands. New York, in the treaty, prohibited the Oneidas\nfrom certain length of leases and New York had the right to\nenact laws with respect to the leases that were permitted to\nenforce the leases.\nThe other thing that one needs to look at in the\ncontext of the times, when looking at how would the Oneidas have\nunderstood this, the tribes of the Iroquois Confederacy, knew\nhow to preserve their aboriginal title when they wanted to do so\nand the Oneidas didn't do that. In the 1797 Big Tree agreement\nwith the Senecas which is published at 7 Statutes at Large, 601,\nthe Senecas sold much of their lands through Robert Morris under\nthe approval of the United States.\nIn the agreement, the agreement provided that the\nreserved lands were, and I quote, \"clearly and fully understood\nto remain the property of the Senecas in as full and ample\nmatter as if these presents had not been executed.\" That is the\nway an Indian tribe understood preserving aboriginal title.\nThat didn't happen in the Treaty of Fort Schuyler.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're a good lawyer that they\nhired, and the Oneidas may not have had as good a lawyer. I\ndon't think this was done around the campfire, do you?\nMR. SACKS: I'm sure it was not, Your Honor.\nThe other thing that one has to look at at the time\nis what New York State was doing. New York State entered into\nthree similar treaties at the time. One with the Oneidas, one\nwith the Cayuga and one with the Onondaga. Those three treaties\nall terminated aboriginal title in the first provision. The\nother three tribes of the Iroquois were not of concern.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: When you say terminated the title,\nyou mean by the conveyance of all lands?\nMR. SACKS: Yes, they had the exact same language in\nArticle 1. The structure of the treaties were identical.\nThe other three tribes of the Iroquois were not of\nconcern to New York State in 1788 because the Mohawks had mostly\nremoved to Canada, the Tuscaroras had no land of their own and\nthe Senecas were in the portion of New York State where\nMassachusetts had the preemption right. So if you look at what\nis happening back in 1788 and early 1789, New York State is\nsetting up a State treaty with the Oneidas and keeping\njurisdiction over those lands.\nNow, to go back to what you asked earlier, Justice\nScalia, no question that if in that context, the Federal\nGovernment then passed a statute that says, as it may, the\nOneidas can't sell this land without federal approval. That's a\nviolation of the Nonintercourse Act, but it doesn't change the\nfundamental nature of the land as being under state\njurisdiction, and has been under state jurisdiction since 1788.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Was there ever any federal\nsuperintendence of the land?\nMR. SACKS: If you count an agent going on the land,\nthere was an agent on the land, but what has happened with this\nland in terms of federal superintendence is that this land has\nbeen superintended, and supervised whether in tribal hands or\notherwise, by the State of New York and local governments since\n1788.\nThere is a reference in our papers to a report, it\nwas issued in connection with the New York State setting up\ntheir troopers to cover the reservations, and that report\nacknowledged that the United States Government appreciated the\nfact that the State of New York had been keeping peace on the\nreservations with their police and saw no reason to interfere\nwith over 100 years -- and this was in the early 20th century --\nof over 100 years of state police supervision.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It isn't the FBI that keeps peace\non other reservations, is it? Isn't it quite standard for state\nlaw enforcement to function?\nMR. SACKS: Sorry I see my light is on.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can he answer that?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, go ahead and answer the\nquestion.\nMR. SACKS: The level of -- yes, Your Honor. It\nis, the FBI doesn't do it, States often do it. They do it\nsometimes with the permission but this happened for 200 years.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Sacks.\nMs. Halligan.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CAITLIN J. HALLIGAN\nFOR NEW YORK, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING PETITIONER\nMS. HALLIGAN: Justice Stevens, and may it please\nthe Court:\nThe State of New York was granted time to address\nthe third question presented regarding the 1838 treaty which we\nbelieve requires reversal of the decision below because it\ndisestablishes the Oneida reservation. Respondents claim that\nthey can now exercise sovereignty over any plot of land they buy\nwithin a vast 300,000 acre tract in Central New York that has\nlong been inhabited almost entirely --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Is sovereignty something that the\ntribe can lose by inaction over a period of time?\nMS. HALLIGAN: I believe that it is, Your Honor, for\nthe reasons that are laid out in petitioner's brief, but\nregardless of what the Court decides about that question, the\nTreaty of 1838 clearly disestablishes the reservation, which\nterminates all sovereignty prospectively. The language in the\nhistorical context --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: The Buffal Creek --\nMS. HALLIGAN: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Treaty.\nMS. HALLIGAN: Yes, the Treaty of Buffalo Creek.\nIt makes clear both the language of the treaty itself as well\nas its historical context that it was intended to terminate\nOneida sovereignty in New York State.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: What you seem to be asking is to\ninfer from that treaty that the prior unlawful land sales of the\nOneida's New York reservation were somehow ratified.\nMS. HALLIGAN: No, Your Honor, ratification is not\npresented squarely in this case. The only question that's at\nissue in this case is whether or not, regardless of whether the\ntransactions that took place between 1795 and 1838 were legal or\nillegal, and we've argued that they're legal in other cases --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But if you're right about Buffalo\nCreek, it would mean that the effect of the Government's\ndecision to repossess something in Kansas was to leave the\nOneidas without any land.\nMS. HALLIGAN: Well, at that point the Oneidas --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: It certainly wasn't that clear\nfrom it. It appeared to be the assumption that the Oneidas did\nnot have to go to Kansas, if they chose not to do it. It was\ndependent on making suitable arrangements.\nMS. HALLIGAN: With regard to the 5,000 acres that\nthey occupied as of 1838, one could read Ransom Gillett's\nassurances to the Oneidas as allowing them to continue to retain\noccupancy over that narrow slice of land, but what that cannot\ndo is change the language of the treaty which makes clear that\nthe reservation is otherwise entirely disestablished. And if I\ncan refer to some of the language of the treaty itself, first of\nall, the treaty explicitly states that its purpose was to carry\nout the Government's policy in removing the Indians from the\neast to the west of the Mississippi. That simply cannot be\nsquared with ongoing sovereignty over the remaining 295,000\nacres which they now claim --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Sure it can. I mean, one way to\npursue that policy is to offer them lands in the west if they\nwant to go there. That would certainly pursue the Government's\npolicy of removing them.\nMS. HALLIGAN: This Court held that in New York\nIndians that Article 13 of the treaty which provides that the\nOneidas agree to remove was sufficient to effect a present grant\nof the Kansas lands and to avoid any forfeiture. So it was much\nmore than an agreement to agree or an offer, if you will. But\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you're saying there is no\nconsideration. If, they simply agree to remove if they -- if they\nwant to remove.\nMS. HALLIGAN: No, they did receive, they did\nreceive consideration and the Court made sure that that was --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, they gave none, I'm talking\nabout.\nMS. HALLIGAN: Who gave none, Your Honor?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The Indians. You're saying they\ngave no promise in exchange, if they simply promised to remove\nif they felt like it.\nMS. HALLIGAN: No, Your Honor; I'm saying that --.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm trying to help you here.\n[Laughter.]\nMS. HALLIGAN: Well, then in that case, I suppose I\nshould agree. My apologies. But what they did was to agree to\nremove, and in fact, that's what happened. If you look at what\ntranspired immediately following the treaty, by 1846, all but\n350 acres, down from 5,000, have been sold by the Oneidas and\nvery few remain.\nBy 1920, there are only 32 acres. And the U.S.'s\nactivities in the area also confirm that that was the\nunderstanding of the treaty, that it terminated sovereignty.\nThere are some very sparse references in the records to some\nexercise of jurisdiction by the U.S. starting around the turn of\nthe century, around the early 1900s, but those only relate to\nthe 32 acres that remained occupied by the Oneidas. There is no\nindication of any exercise of U.S. jurisdiction over the\nremaining 295,000 acres.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I thought that perhaps the Treaty\nof Buffalo Creek is thinking of 50,000 acres where these\nparticular Indian tribe members had their homes, or at least\narguably. Just no one was thinking about the remaining 300,000\nbecause they had long left those. It had nothing to do with\nthem.\nMS. HALLIGAN: I believe the text and the historical\nbackground suggests otherwise, Your Honor. Article 4 of the\ntreaty says that the Kansas lands will be the new homes of the\nOneidas and it also explains where the Oneidas can exercise\nsovereignty. It says that it will secure to the Oneidas in the\nKansas lands, in said country, which refers to the Kansas lands,\nthe right to establish their own form of government, to appoint\ntheir own officers and to administer their own laws. That means\nthat sovereignty is to be in Kansas, not to be in New York.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, It means that that's what was\nintended but what do you make of all of the testimony about the\nrepresentations made by -- I forget the man's name\nMS. HALLIGAN: Gillett.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- the government's\nrepresentative, to the effect you don't have to leave New York.\nMS. HALLIGAN: That related only to the 5,000 acres\nthat they occupied at that time. The record isn't very clear\nabout why he made that assurance.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but my, I guess, let me just\nget to the point and you can answer that.\nMS. HALLIGAN: Yes Your Honor, sorry.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Doesn't that negate your argument\nthat the treaty as such disestablished the reservation?\nMS. HALLIGAN: No, Your Honor, it doesn't. The\ntreaty on its terms appears to disestablish the reservation\nentirely. Gillett's statement could perhaps be read as a\nsubsequent gloss on that treaty to assure the Indians that they\nwon't be forced off their land, the 5,000 acres that they\ncontinue to occupy, perhaps because since New York was not a\nparty to the treaty, there couldn't be any explicit session\nlanguage in the treaty.\nNew York was the only entity that had a right to buy\nthat remaining 5,000 acres because it held the right of\npreemption. So it may have been that the Oneidas wanted to\nensure that they could reach reasonable terms. And they did.\nThey sold almost all of that land within the following six years\nafter proclamation of the treaty. So the contemporaneous history\nsquares with that.\nIt's very similar to what happened in Santa Fe, in\nwhich this Court said there was a reservation that was created\nfor the Santa Fes, there was some indication of acceptance of\nthat reservation, and that acceptance was sufficient to\nterminate the tribe's sovereignty over any lands outside of the\nreservation that was provided to them, even though many of them\ndid not in fact remove to that land.\nHere the Oneidas received much more. Not only did\nmany of them sell the lands and leave immediately but they\nreceived the benefit of their bargain by recovering compensation\nfor the Kansas lands from this Court in New York Indians.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is the precise language that\nyou think relinquished, changed the sovereignty that -- changed\nthe sovereignty?\nMS. HALLIGAN: I think there are several provisions,\nYour Honor.\nFirst of all, in the recitals, it states that the\npurpose of the treaty is to carry out the Government's policy in\nremoving the Indians from the east to the west of the\nMississippi.\nArticle 2 also notes that the Kansas lands will be a\npermanent home for all Indians now residing in the State of New\nYork as well as elsewhere, and Article 4 states that there will\nbe an exercise of sovereignty. It says specifically that will\nthey will be able to establish their own form of government,\nappoint their officers and administer their laws in the Kansas\nland specifically. So I think those are the strongest\nprovisions.\nI would also like to touch for a moment if I can on\na question that several members of the Court have raised which\nis what is the impact of this decision here. From the\nperspective of the State of New York and the localities, it's\nvery serious because it does concern whether or not the tribe\ncan unilaterally regain sovereignty over a very large tract of\nland in central New York. This is an area that has been --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, there are implications from\nOneida II case that the Indians can reacquire land and assert\nsome kind of possessory right.\nMS. HALLIGAN: With regard to a narrower swath of\nland than what's at issue here. And in any event, the Court\nexpressly did not pronounce on the effect of the Buffalo Creek\ntreaty here.\nIf that's the case, what could well result is a\npatchwork quilt of jurisdiction which this Court has said poses\ntremendous governance problems. It's governance by tract book.\nThis is not just hypothetical. There are already difficulties\nthat have started to arise as a result of the Second Circuit's\ndecision.\nFor example, another tribe relying on the decision\nhere purchased land within its original land claim area that's\njust 300 yards from a local high school and have begun operation\nof a gaming hall there. The locality attempted to enjoin\noperation of the gaming hall, but was unable to do so in light\nof the Second Circuit's decision below.\nWe anticipate there are will be many other problems\nof that sort that will arise. The residents of the area here\nhave long settled and justifiable expectations. The settlement\npatterns are clear here. The absence of any exercise of U.S.\njurisdiction outside a very small plot of land is not\ncontroverted. These are factors that this Court has repeatedly\nheld in cases like Hagen and Yankton Sioux are relevant to the\nquestion of both what the contemporaneous understanding of the\ntreaty was and what the result should be today, and we submit\nthat they should lead to the same result here as well.\nIf there are no further questions --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Ms. Halligan.\nMr. Smith, we'll hear from you, please.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. SMITH\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS\nMR. SMITH: Justice Stevens, and may it please the\nCourt:\nThere was a suggestion in answer to an earlier\nquestion that the Oneidas have changed their position about\nwhether the land is alienable when in their hands. That's not\ncorrect. There is nothing in the record to suggest that.\nWhat the record does suggest at page 213 of the\njoint appendix is that Sherrill has changed its position. It\nwanted an easement on Oneida land in 1997 and at that page of\nthe appendix, you will see that Sherrill went to the Department\nof the Interior for Federal approval of the easement under\nFederal law, understanding at the time the Oneida's position and\nthe Federal law principle that the land wasn't subject even to\nan easement absent the Secretary's approval.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you're saying your position was\nand is that it's not inalienable without the approval of the\nfeds?\nMR. SMITH: Yes. And the land, when the Oneida's\npossession of the land, actual possession is unified with their\nunderlying Federal property and treaty rights, the land is\ninalienable and cannot be sold today out of the Oneida's\npossession any more than it could 200 years ago.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But it, the portion within the\nreservation you claim is alienable so long as it's not owned by\nan Oneida. The current owners can sell it to somebody else,\nright?\nMR. SMITH: Your Honor, the point of Oneida II --\nthe answer is yes. The answer is yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes or -- Does that strike you as\nstrange?\nMR. SMITH: No, Your Honor. It's, there is an\nunusual twist to it, and it arises from the fact that there were\nillegal transfers 200 years ago. There was a suggestion in the\nOneida II decision and it has been followed by the lower Federal\ncourts that there may be equitable principles that constrain\nremedies in a course of order to be entered in a land claim\naction brought by a tribe that is out of possession, but the\nequitable principles that are at stake here are very different\nand they don't involve the same --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, if you prevail in this\ncase, then could suits be brought by the tribe to evict current\nowners of land on the historical Oneida 300,000-acre\nreservation?\nMR. SMITH: No, Justice O'Connor. The Courts have\nruled that we may not do that and it is the position and I will\nsay it clearly here today that the Oneidas do not assert a right\nto evict landowners in the land claim area. Judge McKern who\nhandled --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But if it's owned by the State of\nNew York, if it's been acquired somehow by the State, then what?\nMR. SMITH: We are not asserting a right to evict.\nWe are not waiving any of the underlying rights that involve\nright to possession under Federal law and aboriginal rights and\nthe point I'm making should not be construed that way.\nWhat I'm saying is that we are not asking a Court\nand do not expect a Court to evict anyone from action -- from\nland that is not in our actual possession.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What happens about -- suppose -- I\njust want to follow this. You don't evict the people who are\nthere but it's 22 square miles in the center of New York State.\nThat's a lot of land. And maybe that's worth a trillion\ndollars, I don't know. So does that mean that the Indian tribe\nwould have -- would it mean that it had the right to, let's say,\nhundreds of billions of dollars, the value of that property,\nthat it could sue someone for it, the State of New York or the\nFederal Government? I guess the State of New York?\nMR. SMITH: Let me give you a concrete answer. The\nkey to the land claim is approximately one quarter the size of\nthe Oneida land claim and it has gone to judgment and is on\nappeal in the Second Circuit. The judgment in that case after\nadjustments for interest and so on was $250 million and it was\nrendered against the State of New York only as the initial and\ncontinuing --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What was the acreage there?\nMR. SMITH: Approximately one fourth -- the answer\nis 64,000 acres.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, that may not be worth as\nmuch. Maybe this includes several cities and towns? What do\nyou think it is? I mean in other words, the answer to my\nquestion is in principle, yes. In principle, if the Indian\ntribe owns 22 square miles, even if they can't get possession,\nthey're entitled to the value of it, in your opinion?\nMR. SMITH: Correct. The point of Oneida II is that\na damages remedy is appropriate as to a tribe out of possession,\nbut there is no suggestion that that is a judicial sale of the\nunderlying federally protected treaty rights --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no, of course the people who\nare there have it, but maybe it's not Buffalo. I don't know,\nmaybe it's all of Buffalo, New York, or maybe it's a town. I'm\nnot saying that that's the law but I just wanted your view of\nthat. And then I wanted to know this, that on the legal part, I\nwould like your response to the -- I take it your answer is yes,\nthey're entitled to the value of it. I'm right about that, that\nis your answer?\nMR. SMITH: Yes, Your Honor. Well, they're entitled\nto two items of value. They're entitled to retrospective\ndamages for trespass, and in that the Court has not --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: On the whole 300,000?\nMR. SMITH: Well, there is one parcel part of it\nthat we have not sued upon because there was a 1798 Federal\ntreaty that validated the transfer. The State, which feels that\nit was not bound by the Nonintercourse Act, twice went to the\nFederal Government for formal Federal treaty approval of these\ntransactions.\nOne of them went through. That was 1798. The other\none was 1802. The President did not proclaim it and the State\nnever went back to the Federal Government.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Do the, would the Oneidas have a\nclaim to tax the current property owners?\nMR. SMITH: No, sir.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why not?\nMR. SMITH: The decisions of the Court in cases like\nAtkinson and Montana address the lack of power of a tribe with\nrespect to non-Indian fee lands within a reservation.\nI recognize that there is an added wrinkle here in\nthat the Oneida's rights persist in that land, even though it is\nout of their possession and that wouldn't have the same -- that\nwouldn't have been true in Atkinson and Montana, but in that\nthe Courts have held that the possession of the non-Indians is\nlawful in the sense that it will not be interrupted and the land\ntitle can be passed in subsequent transfers, we accept the\nproposition that Montana and Atkinson would prevent the Oneidas\nfrom regulating in any respect, let alone taxing, any of the\nland in the possession of non-Indians.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Smith, isn't there any\nprinciple of laches that comes into effect here? I mean, really\nwhat you're asking the Court to do is to sanction a very odd\ncheckerboard system of jurisdiction in the middle of New York\nState. Some parcels, the ones the Indians choose to buy and are\nable to buy, become Indian territory and everything else is\ngoverned by New York State. This is just a terrible situation\nas far as governance is concerned and part of the blame for the\nsituation we're in is that the Oneidas did not complain about\nthis for 170 years.\nMR. SMITH: The issues of laches in time is not\nwithin the questions presented in this case, notwithstanding\nthat it has been identified in earlier decisions and was\nactually raised by the counties in this Court the last\ngo-around. Laches does not bar this claim.\nThese were illegal transactions declared by Federal\nstatute to be of no validity in law or equity. The Oneida II\ndecision which holds that background principles of Federal law\nwhich would ordinarily incorporate state statutes of limitation\ndon't apply because their intention with the underlying rule\nthat only Congress can impair or extinguish this right. Those\nsame --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The case also held that because of\nthe passage of time and the reliance interests that have\ndeveloped, we are not going to give you possession.\nNow, why doesn't the same principle apply to giving\nyou jurisdiction? Because of the passage of time, you can get\ndamages for trespass. Maybe even you can get the value of the\nland. But it would just create a chaotic situation if we say\nthat you have jurisdiction in the middle of New York State over\nany pieces of land that you can buy.\nMR. SMITH: The equitable principles that would\ninform remedy in an action brought by a tribe out of possession\ndon't apply when the tribe is in possession or else there has\nbeen a judicial extinguishment of an underlying right that's\nonly within the power of Congress to extinguish. The Court has\nbeen clear that the treaty right here -- we have a Federal\ntreaty and it says you have the free use and enjoyment of the\nland. In the New York Indians I, the Court said that means\nsimilar, the same promise made to the Senecas means that the\nland cannot be taxed.\nThe argument has been made that the Oneida's only\nrights are to be paid off now, to be in effect have the\nun-extinguished Federal aboriginal right and the un-extinguished\ntreaty right purchased. Those rights through literally 200\nyears of decisions are within the sole control of Congress.\nOneida II made pains to say that this was an unusual situation\nfraught with some tension and problems, but those problems were\nfor Congress. There are a dozen cases from this Court that deal\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Excuse me, Mr. Smith, first,\nwould you clarify how much land is now claimed as Indian --\nwithin the tribe's aboriginal right? It's not -- well, for one\nthing clarify while you are not claiming the entire 6 million.\nDidn't they have 6 million acres to start with?\nMR. SMITH: They did. The matter was litigated in\nthe Second Circuit and resolved adversely to the Oneidas, but I\nwould take the position that the Treaty of Canandaigua actually\nconfirms the transfer of land outside of the retained\nreservation, so that the land that we are talking about today as\nretaining the Oneida's rights is I think approximately 270,000\nacres.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But some of that you said was\ntaken out by an approved transfer in 1798?\nMR. SMITH: Yes, and that's why I'm not saying\n300,000 acres. I can't do the arithmetic and I don't have the\nfinal survey --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But something around 275?\nMR. SMITH: Around 270.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And the figure, the 250 million\nis for the rental -- what is that -- what is that for?\nMR. SMITH: In the Cayuga case, there were two\nelements of damages. One was retrospective, and that was rental\ndamages for past trespass. The other was a current value,\nbecause Judge McKern said that he would not evict anyone, and\nthat he thought a suitable alternative to eviction was the award\nof value, because it would put the tribe in a position through a\nfree-market and voluntary relationship with purchasers to,\nquote, \"restore its homeland.\"\nJudge McKern got really to the heart of this process\nby recognizing that there are inequities all around, if you\nwill, and that the Court is without the power to extinguish the\nunderlying rights. It's Congress's role, but that there needs\nto be a sensible way of recognizing those rights today. And\nwhat Judge McKern decided is that damages would put the tribe in\na position to do what the Oneidas have done with respect to the\nland that's at issue here before the Court, and that's to make,\nyou know, a fair-and-square deal and pay full value.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Which New York State paid, and\nthat's the end of it.\nMR. SMITH: Yes, Your Honor. If I understand your\nquestion, the answer is yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's not the end of it. From\nwhat you're saying, I gather that you believe, in that case,\nonce they purchase the land, it becomes tribal.\nMR. SMITH: Correct. I mean that's the end of that\nlitigation. There is a judgment, it's gone to the Court of\nAppeals, and it's there now.\nThe issue of damages remedies when the tribe is out\nof possession is simply conceptually and fundamentally different\nthan the question of what happens when the tribe has joined\npossession --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What do you say on the merits,\nthen, to the claim that there were 300,000 of these acres in\n1838 or with the Treaty of Buffalo Creek -- there were 300,000\nacres that nobody was paying any attention to because there were\nno tribe members that lived there, so that when you have\nlanguage in the treaty, under those circumstances, that says\ntheir home is now -- where was it? Illinois or --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Kansas.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Kansas. Their home is now in\nKansas. That's the nation. That's the place. And that --\nyou've heard the language cited. And even though a person says,\n\"You can live here as long as you want,\" that just means they\ncan live there as long as they want; that doesn't mean it's the\nreservation. The reservation's sovereignty may have gone to\nKansas, though, of course, nobody had to move, unless he struck\na fair bargain that he agreed to with the State of New York. I\ntake it that's their argument. I just want to hear your\nresponse.\nMR. SMITH: There are a lot of parts to that. Let\nme respond to what I think is the most fundamental.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. SMITH: That argument rests on the idea that\nthere was an assumption, at the time of the Treaty of Buffalo\nCreek, that the prior transfers were valid. It's an argument of\nratification by assumption. Oneida II says, in a much more\nforceful circumstance, that even a later Federal treaty that\nexplicitly refers to the prior session does not ratify it,\nbecause the ratifying language has to be clear and express, and\nyou have to believe that both the Indians and the Congress, the\nUnited States, meant to do that.\nHere, the -- if you think about it, in what I just\nheard concerning Buffalo Creek, there's an interesting\nasymmetry. We're supposed to assume that the treaty covered all\nthe land, but we're not supposed to conclude that Ransom\nGillet's promises covered it all. We're supposed to believe\nthat one, by assumption, extends to the entire reservation and\nthat the other, forceful promises of a Federal treaty\ncommissioner that you need not go anywhere, are actually very\nlimited and carried with them a thought that they were\nextinguishing rights in other land. That interaction with\nRansom Gillet is crucial. The treaty --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Would it not be odd to have a --\nto give assurance that you could buy back what you've lost?\nDoes it -- would that -- that's a very strange construction of\nthe representations attendant upon Buffalo Creek. I understand\nwhat you're talking about with the 5,000 acres.\nMR. SMITH: The representations from the Federal\ntreaty commissioner were not that they could buy it back. The\nFederal treaty commissioner went to the Oneidas because they\nwould not agree to the treaty. They didn't want to give up\ntheir rights. He gave them a piece of paper that was meant to\nassure them they were not giving up their rights. There was no\nsuggestion in this important interaction that they were\nbargaining over the loss of other rights. Mille Lacs is\ndirectly in point here. Mille Lacs, I think -- well, from Mille\nLacs, you can derive the proposition that where the record shows\nno bargaining over a right, and where the treaty does not refer\nto the right, the Indians will not be held to have silently\nyielded their important rights.\nIn the nature of this interaction, you have the\nsuggestion that -- you have a far more important right, in much\nlarger part of the reservation, that persisted as a matter of\nFederal law. There is nothing about what happened at Buffalo\nCreek that would suggest that anyone would think they were\naffecting the Oneida's rights in lands that were not involved in\nthe treaty. Now, the treaty --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Stewart, your time is beginning\nto come up, and there is one thing we haven't talked about that\nI would really like to get your view on, and that is the 1788\nTreaty -- what was that, Fort Schuyler -- Treaty of Fort\nSchuyler?\nMR. SMITH: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- between New York State and the\nOneidas. Now, that contained language which said the Oneidas\ncede and grant all their lands to the people of the State of New\nYork. That was the operative provision. Later on, it --\nArticle 2 says, \"Of the ceded lands\" -- the ceded lands, lands\nthat have been ceded -- \"a tract described by metes and bounds\nis reserved to the Oneidas to hold to themselves and their\nposterity forever.\" Now, I would normally interpret that to\nmean that the Oneidas gave up all of their sovereignty over the\nlands and were given back, by the State of New York, the right\nover this tract designated by metes and bounds.\nNow, I'm saying I would normally interpret that,\nexcept in a treaty with the Indians. In a treaty with the\nIndians, you say, \"Well\" -- and we have cases which have\nlanguage somewhat like this, and they say, \"Well, they really\ndidn't cede the part that they reserved.\" That may be the case\nin -- ordinarily. But it seems to me, a basic principle of\ncontract law -- of treaty law, of any law -- that where there is\nan ambiguous phrase or provision, you interpret it the way the\nparties themselves have interpreted it. And it seems to me that\nthe subsequent history, after 1788, indicates that the Oneidas\nbelieved that New York State had jurisdiction over that land.\nMR. SMITH: Actually --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The New York State police were in\nthere. New York State managed the lands.\nMR. SMITH: Justice Scalia, actually, it's\ninteresting. In the Joint Appendix in the Court of Appeals, at\npage 413, is the actual document that governed the transfer of\nthis land, the state statute; and in that statute, the State\ngranted its right of preemption to an individual to acquire the\nland, because it understood that it had not yet exercised its\nright of preemption. That's, in the conduct of the parties, a\ndirect refutation of the idea that the right of preemption was\nexercised in the Treaty of Buffalo -- in the Treaty of Fort\nSchuyler, the 1788 treaty.\nThe most fundamental point, though, about the 1788\ntreaty is that next came the 1794 Treaty of Canandaigua, which\nembodied a Federal promise to protect the free use and enjoyment\nof this land, and the Oneidas' possession of it. And that exact\npromise -- not sort of, like, but exact -- was held in New York\nIndians I to prevent taxation of the Senecas' lands.\nNow, I guess I'd like to make two quick points\nbefore I'm out of time.\nOne is that, with respect to the idea that it's just\ntoo late, apart from the fact that the question is not\npresented, I want to emphasize that, in section 2415 of Title\n28, Congress explicitly focused on the question of these old\nclaims. And if you read the legislative history, all they\ntalked about was how to deal with the Oneida claim and these old\nclaims. And they not only provided that title claims are not\nbarred by statute of limitations, and established a limitations\nperiod that would not have run against the Oneidas because they\nwere on a Federal list, but they did the following, which I\nthink is notable. The statute provides that these claims\naccrued, in 1966, on the day of the statute, there is no room\nfor background equitable principles in Federal law. Where\nCongress has specifically focused on a problem, addressed it,\nthe idea is, I suppose, that there is no room to fill gaps here\nby the Court where Congress has decided just what the gaps are\nand how to fill them.\nThe other point that I would make concerns the\nTreaty of Buffalo Creek. The treaty's language leaves it to\nboth sides to decide whether or not Indians are going to Kansas.\nThe legislate -- the history of the treaty shows that the\nUnited States backed away from any language which would oblige\nit to remove Indians, and the language with respect to the\nIndians left them a choice.\nBut, ultimately, all of that is controlled by what\nhappened. The Federal Government made a decision that no\nIndians would go to Kansas. The idea that Buffalo Creek\nextinguished reservations in New York would seem bizarre to\nanyone in New York today, because the Onondagas have\nreservations, the Senecas have reservations, the St. Regis have\nreservations, the Tonawandas have reservations, the Tuscaroras\nhave reservations, and the Oneidas have reservations. It didn't\nextinguish just the -- there's an idea that you can look at\nthis in a vacuum -- it didn't just extinguish the Oneida\nreservations. Under the Santa Fe rationale, the point is not\nthat Congress ultimately intended two reservations, although it\nhas done that often -- the Choctaw, the Mississippi Choctaw, the\nSeminoles. It frequently happened with removal, that there were\nmore than one reservations. But here, you would have to believe\nthat Congress intended no reservation. You would have to\nbelieve that Congress quickly came to the decision that none of\nthese Indian tribes in New York actually had a reservation\nanywhere, and that's not acceptable.\nThank you.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Smith.\nMr. Stewart?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART\nFOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING RESPONDENTS\nMR. STEWART: Justice Stevens, and may it please the\nCourt:\nI would like to address, first, the City's argument\nthat the long passage of time renders it improper to give the\ntribe a tax exemption on lands that have recently been\npurchased. That argument is wrong for three reasons.\nFirst, if we are correct that the tribe had\nfederally protected title as of the 1790s and that that Federal\nprotection was never validly extinguished, then the fact that\nthe tribe was out of possession of the relevant lands for nearly\ntwo centuries is, itself, a distinct and substantial legal\nwrong, and it would be adding insult to injury to say that\nprecisely because the tribe had suffered that initial injury, it\nshould be disentitled to take advantage of a tax exemption that\nwould otherwise flow from its possession of --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't -- I don't understand that\nargument at all. I mean, it's just a general rule that, where\nyou've been wronged, you have to come forward, in a timely\nfashion, to get the wrong righted. And what difference does it\nmake what the nature of the wrong is, whether it's dispossession\nor not?\nMR. STEWART: Well, I think it -- I think it's\nimportant to distinguish between two different types of delay.\nWhat was at issue in Oneida I and Oneida II was delay in\nbringing the underlying lawsuit. And, even in that context, the\nCourt said that the suit was not barred entirely, but equitable\nfactors might be taken into account in formulating an\nappropriate remedy.\nHere, we don't have delay in filing a lawsuit. That\nis, nobody doubts that the tribes asserted their right to a tax\nexemption promptly after repurchasing the relevant lands. The\nargument on the other side is that their delay in purchasing the\nland should be analogized to --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, do you say that a tribe can\nnever lose its sovereign rights to land? Can it acquiesce in\nthe loss of those rights?\nMR. STEWART: This Court has held that the tribe --\nthat a tribe may abandon aboriginal title to land.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes.\nMR. STEWART: It's not --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes, and we have held that a\nState can abandon sovereignty, as in Massachusetts versus New\nYork.\nMR. STEWART: But the Court has also held that once\nCongress creates a reservation, once it confers explicit federal\nprotection on particular lands, the reservation can be\ndiminished or disestablished only by act of Congress; it can't\nbe terminated through adverse possession. And with respect to\nthe question of whether delay in buying the land should be\nanalogized to delay in bringing a --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, that might give them a\nright to some kind of damages for a violation, but what does\nthat do to the sovereign claims of the tribe?\nMR. STEWART: I think the -- the reservation would\nremain a reservation. As Mr. Smith pointed out, with respect to\nparcels within the reservation that are not owned by Indians,\nthe tribe's regulatory authority is extremely limited and,\ntherefore, the tribe would not be able to exercise anything like\nplenary regulatory jurisdiction over the whole 270,000 acres.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What is it? You said \"extremely\nlimited.\" This is the first that I heard that the tribe might\nhave some authority over part of that, what, the 275- -- the\n275,000 acres, even though it hadn't repurchased the parcels.\nMR. STEWART: The Court, in Atkinson Trading and in\nMontana versus United States, before that, had said that the\ntribe may be able to regulate conduct on non-Indian lands to the\nextent that the conduct involves voluntary transactions with the\ntribe or its members or to the extent that the regulation is\nnecessary in order to protect the tribe's sovereign over the\nland that it possesses is --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But now we're talking about land\nthat -- where there are no tribe members, as I understand it, in\nthis area is predominantly non-tribal members.\nMR. STEWART: I agree. In -- and Atkinson Trading\nmakes clear that, even when the great bulk of the land is owned\nby the tribe or its members, the tribe's ability to regulate\nconduct on the non-Indian parcels is sharply limited. That\nwould be doubly true in a tract of this nature.\nBut to return to the point about the State's\nreliance interest, I think it's -- or the city's reliance\ninterest -- I think it's important to stress that this case is\nonly about taxation, and a municipality can't claim to have the\nsame sort of reliance interest in being able to tax that a\npotential defendant in a --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, that may be true, but that's\nwhy I wondered about the damage part of it. That is, I'm still\nthinking that a trespass action for trespasses that occurred in\n1850 or 1700 is worth millions today, even if it's tiny, because\nof the interest, passage of time, et cetera. When you add that\nto the value of the land, I'm thinking of numbers that are\nastronomical. And yet that hasn't happened.\nAnd so, what actually, as a -- and that's why I'm\nthinking, isn't a damage action far more serious than simply\ntaking property off the tax rolls?\nMR. STEWART: That's true, but --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And that's why I want to know how,\nin practice, this works out. Does Congress have the power, for\nexample, to deal with it? Is what we're considering in this\ncase simply a negotiating position and strengthening people's\nhands, vis a vis legislation? What's going on?\nMR. STEWART: Congress does have the power to deal\nwith it. And at the end of the Court's opinion in Oneida II,\nthe Court expressed confidence that, up to this point, has not\nbeen borne out, that Congress would fix the problem.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes, Congress has done nothing\nabout this, has it? Can -- has the tribe asked,\nadministratively, for the Bureau of Indians Affairs to recognize\nit now as a tribe?\nMR. STEWART: Well, the Bureau of Indian Affairs has\nrecognized the tribe all along. That is, under the Treaty of\nCanandaigua, the Federal Government was required to pay\nannuities and treaty cloth to the Six Nations, and the Federal\nGovernment has done that continuously since the beginning. So\nwe've always recognized this to be a tribe.\nAnd I think you're -- you've put your finger on an\nimportant point, Justice Breyer, in that the Court, in Oneida\nII, said that it hoped that Congress would fix the problem, and\nthought that it would, but said even if Congress doesn't\nlegislate a solution, the suit can go forward. The Court\ncontemplated that equitable considerations could be taken into\naccount in formulating a remedy, but it certainly didn't\ncontemplate that the tribe, at the end of the day, would be left\nwithout any remedy at all. And, as you point out, if the tribe\ncan sue for damages, it seems farfetched to think that it\nwouldn't be able to reassert the tax immunity that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What tax -- what taxes are we\ntalking about? In addition to property tax, are we also talking\nabout sales tax?\nMR. STEWART: No, the Court has said -- the Court\nhas said, as a general matter, as a matter of Federal law, a\ntribal merchant on tribal land can be required to collect sales\ntaxes from non-Indians, at least for the purchase of goods that\nwere manufactured off the reservation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it isn't just taxes we're\ntalking about. It's jurisdiction over these parcels of land.\nIt -- I mean, taxes -- that's just one aspect of saying that\nthis land no longer belongs to New York State.\nMR. STEWART: I mean, taxes are at issue -- are the\nonly thing that's at issue in this case. But I agree that\nholding this parcel to be a reservation would have implications\nfor regulatory jurisdiction, as well. Now, there isn't a\ncategorical rule of Federal law that says that States and\nlocalities absolutely cannot regulate conduct on tribal lands\nwithin the reservation. Rather, there is a preemption test --\nthere's certainly a thumb on the scale in favor of an exemption\nfrom state and local regulation where tribal reservation lands\nare involved.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Mr. Stuart, I have one question\nabout Buffalo Creek. If we hold that Buffalo Creek didn't\ndisestablish the reservation, then doesn't the New York Indian\ncase rest on a false premise because that case gave $2 million\nfor failure to give the Kansas lands?\nMR. STEWART: Well, the Court, in the New York\nIndians II, recognized, to start with, that the treaty effected\nan immediate session of the Oneida's Wisconsin lands to the\nFederal Government, and the Court specifically noted that that\ncession, in and of itself, would be sufficient consideration to\nsupport a contract between private parties. So it simply isn't\ncorrect to say that the New York Oneidas gave up nothing other\nthan a promise to remove. The second --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Was there any positive indication\n-- I just don't remember this -- in the New York case, that they\nwould -- that they, in fact, had ceded anything of New -- of\ntheir interests in New York? As distinct from the Wisconsin\nlands?\nMR. STEWART: I mean, there were references to the\nprimary inducement to the Federal Government's entering into the\ntreaty being the desire to --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's entering into the treaty.\nBut when it came to compensation, was there an indication that\nthey were being compensated for anything other than Kansas land,\nwhich they had obtained as a result of ceding their Wisconsin\nland?\nMR. STEWART: No. No.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. STEWART: The compensation was strictly for the\nKansas lands that were denied to them. And it's important to\nnote that the Senecas --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But there was no indication that\nthey got Kansas for anything other than Wisconsin, is that\ncorrect?\nMR. STEWART: They got -- I mean, they didn't --\nthey weren't held to have promised -- made a commitment to\nremove from New York. Now, clearly, in analyzing the reasons --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But there was no indication that\nthey had ceded anything with respect to title in New York, was\nthere?\nMR. STEWART: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay,\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, did it rest upon the cession\nin Wisconsin?\nMR. STEWART: It rested, in part, upon the cession\nin Wisconsin. It rested, in part, on a fairly technical\nargument, to the effect that the grant of Kansas lands was one\nen presente. That is, it was a present grant of Kansas lands,\nand, therefore, the New York Indians could be disentitled to\nthose lands only if they had -- a forfeiture had been\nestablished. And the Court looked to Article 3 of the treaty to\ndetermine the conditions for forfeiture. It said that the\nFederal Government would have been required to allege a\nforfeiture by legislative or judicial act, et cetera.\nThe other thing I really wanted to -- the point I\nwanted to make about the reliance interest of the taxing\njurisdiction are that no matter how long a particular tract has\nbeen taxable, it is -- may I finish this? -- it is always within\nthe realm of a city's contemplation that it may be bought up\ntomorrow by the Federal Government, a church, any other\ntax-exempt entity, and, consequently, the municipality can have\nno sense of repose that it will remain taxable.\nThank you.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Stewart. The case\nis submitted.\n[Whereupon, at 11:06 a.m., the case in the\nabove-entitled matter was submitted.]\n"
