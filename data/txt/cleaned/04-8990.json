KISSINGER: Mr. Chief Justice, may it\nplease the Court:\nThe jurors which --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Why don't you raise the\nlevel of the podium a little so we can hear you?\nMR. KISSINGER: Is that better, Your Honor?\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Not much.\nMR. KISSINGER: One more sound check. Does\nthat --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you.\nMR. KISSINGER: Thank you.\nThe jurors who convicted Mr. House of first\ndegree murder heard that semen stains on the victim's\nclothing matched Mr. House. They didn't hear the DNA\nevidence which showed that not to be the case.\nThe jurors heard --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Was that because there was\nno such analysis at the time?\nMR. KISSINGER: That's correct, Justice\nO'Connor.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: How many years ago was\nthis trial?\nMR. KISSINGER: The trial, Your Honor, was\napproximately 20 years ago.\nThe jurors who convicted Mr. House heard that\nbloodstains on Mr. House's blue jeans matched the blood\nbelonging to the victim. They didn't hear the\nassistant chief medical examiner for the State of\nTennessee testify that the source of those bloodstains\nwas a sample taken during Ms. Muncey's autopsy, nor did\nthey hear --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The district court heard\nthat, though, didn't it?\nMR. KISSINGER: That's correct, Justice\nScalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And didn't believe it.\nRight? And did not believe it. Found as a matter of\nfact that the blood was -- was not a result of the\nspill.\nMR. KISSINGER: Justice Scalia, the court\nmade a conclusion that the blood which had spilt from\nthe tube had spilt after -- after the blood had been\ntested. It did not, however, make a factual finding.\nIt made a conclusion of law regarding that, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That -- is that a conclusion\nof law?\nMR. KISSINGER: It is, Your Honor. If the\nCourt were to look at the district court order, the\ndistrict court order was divided into two distinct\nparts. The first part --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't care what part it\nput it in. The district court did not believe that the\nblood on the trousers was a consequence of the spill\nand that -- and that, therefore, blood was identified\non the inside of his trousers that was the blood of the\nvictim. That's what the district court believed,\nhaving heard the testimony.\nMR. KISSINGER: Your Honor, what the district\n-- what the district court concluded as a matter of law\nwas that it -- that notwithstanding Dr. Blake's\ntestimony regarding the source of the blood found on\nMr. House's jeans, that that did not eliminate the --\neliminate the testimony of Agent Scott who said that he\nsaw blood on the jeans when he first -- excuse me. Let\nme rephrase that because it's actually a critical\nmatter. He saw what he thought appeared to be\nbloodstains on the jeans when he first picked them up.\nWhat the district court did in that instance\nwas exactly the error that Mr. House has brought to the\nattention of this Court, which is in the face of\nevidence of innocence, the district court, simply\nbecause it found some contrary evidence in the record,\nfound that Mr. House had failed to make his showing.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: On that point -- on that one\npoint, do you contend that the district court was\nclearly erroneous?\nMR. KISSINGER: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: On that one point of the\nblood, of whether, indeed, his blood was on -- or the\nvictim's blood was on the inside of his trousers? On\nthat one point, do you claim that the district court\nwas clearly erroneous?\nMR. KISSINGER: Justice Scalia, we actually\nmake two claims regarding that. First, that that was a\nconclusion of law entitled to -- entitled to de novo\nreview. Second, that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What's your -- what's your\nsecond point? Because I --\nMR. KISSINGER: Second, Justice Scalia, if\nindeed it was a finding of fact, yes, that finding of\nfact was clearly erroneous.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: On the basis solely of the\ntestimony of -- of this expert.\nMR. KISSINGER: Your Honor, on the basis of\nthe entirety of the record, which is what this Court\ninstructed the district court to examine when it\nconducts a Schlup inquiry.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Including the contrary\ntestimony that said if it had been the result of a\nspill, it would not have been splattered all over, as\nit was here. Some of it wouldn't have been on the\ninside of the trousers. Some of it wouldn't have been\nmixed with mud. Despite all of that, you -- you can\nsay that the district court's finding, which I consider\na finding of fact, was clearly erroneous.\nMR. KISSINGER: Your Honor, including not\nonly that testimony, but the testimony of the same\nexpert who made the statements which the Court just\ncited, who said that she was unable -- that she was\nexcluding merely the direct spillage, the pouring of\nblood onto the jeans, and conceded in her testimony\nthat the transfer stains which she observed, the type\nof stains which she observed could, in fact, have been\n-- that she had no opinion as to the cause of those,\nonly that it was the result of one object wiping\nagainst another object.\nAlso, in light of the testimony in regarding --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. I -- I agree\nthat all of this stuff would -- would have made a\nbetter case for the defendant here. But once the case\nhas been tried and both sides have put on all the\nevidence they have, we have a -- a much different test,\nand -- and that is whether any reasonable juror could\nhave found him guilty. That's a very heavy burden:\nwhether any reasonable jury could have found guilt. I\nagree it would have been a much closer case, but -- but\nthe burden you -- you have before us here is to\nestablish that no reasonable jury could possibly have\nfound him guilty.\nMR. KISSINGER: Justice Scalia --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And on -- just on the blood\nthing alone, I -- I find that a hard burden to bear.\nMR. KISSINGER: Justice Scalia, there --\nthere are two things which come into the -- into the\nCourt's analysis.\nFirst is the Court is correct. The burden is\nquite high, and it's -- it's high for a reason. It's\njustifiably high. We don't shrink from that burden,\nYour Honor.\nWhat we say is that along with that burden,\nthe Court also requires that the entirety of the\nevidence be reviewed. If the entirety of the evidence\nis reviewed and the effect of the entirety of the\nevidence on a properly instructed, reasonable juror --\nthat's the nature of the -- the determination -- what\neffect will that have? When we look at the facts in\nthis case, when we look at the blood evidence in this\ncase, yes, we don't deny that there is evidence which\ncould support conviction. However, that is not the\ntest in Schlup. Schlup specifically rejected that\ninquiry.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What did it rest on? What\n-- what is the district court's conclusion? The court\nconcludes that the spillage occurred after the FBI\ncrime lab received and tested the evidence. What does\nthat rest on?\nMR. KISSINGER: Your Honor, quite frankly, we\ncan't determine that -- that statement rests on\nanything. The undisputed evidence in the record\nconsists of a photograph of the blood samples at the\ntime they were received by the defense expert. The box\nwas opened. A photograph was taken. The photograph\nshows clearly that one entire tube of blood is missing\nand the second tube of blood has leaked within the\npackaging.\nBut the record also contains the testimony of\nthe TBI agent who transported the blood from the FBI to\nthe defense expert who said he observed no blood that\nleaked other than the -- other than what was inside the\ncontainer.\nIt also contains the testimony of the FBI\nagent who tested the blood at the FBI who said two\nthings. One, I used no -- no more than one quarter of\na tube of blood and that no blood spilt while the tube\nwas in the possession of the FBI.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And it also contained the\ntestimony of an expert who said that if the tube\nspilled in that way, it would not have created the kind\nof spatterings that -- that were incriminating in this\ncase. Even if there was some spill, it would not have\nproduced the kind of spattering. So, you know, I call\nthat a draw.\nMR. KISSINGER: Your Honor, two -- two things\nto -- two things to point out there. First is that\nthat eliminates only one possible hypothesis and that\nis the hypothesis that blood was directly spilt onto --\nonto the -- onto the jeans. I think the example that\nthe expert gave was these are not stains, for example,\nthe pouring of a -- like coffee -- pouring coffee onto\nthe lap of your jeans or something like that. These\nare simply transfers: one bloody object wiped against\nanother.\nSo while she gave a hypothesis of guilt --\nand again, Your Honor, it comes to the could and would\ndistinction. Yes, it -- that could be considered\nevidence of guilt, what would a -- but, however, that's\nnot the inquiry. The inquiry is what would a\nreasonable juror who heard that on one side, that it\ndidn't spill directly, but on the other side, heard the\nevidence that we began -- that I began to discuss with\nJustice Breyer, which is the evidence of the TBI agent,\nthe photographic evidence, the evidence of the FBI\nagent, the evidence that the Styrofoam box was opened\nduring transit to the FBI and that objects were removed\nfrom it during transit.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I have two questions on the\nblood, and there's a lot you want to cover here, so I\nwon't take too much of your time.\nOne, is it significant for your case that\nthis was a very small sample?\nTwo, was the evidence about the enzymatic\ndegradation -- was that available? Was the science\nabout that fully available to the defense at the time\nof trial?\nI had those two questions.\nMR. KISSINGER: Justice Kennedy, in terms of\nthe -- the size of -- of the bloodstains, it was\nsignificant to the extent that it bears upon the\nprobative value of the testimony of Charles Scott when\nhe says -- when he said he saw what he thought might be\nstains. As a simple matter of fact, this -- the jeans\nwere stained with a number of substances, not just\nblood, and a number of witnesses, including the trial\nprosecutor himself, described the bloodstains as\nactually so small that they were difficult to detect by\nthe human eye.\nThe second part of your question, Justice\nKennedy, yes. That evidence was available. And our\nposition is that it -- that goes actually to the\nsubstance of our constitutional ineffective assistance\nof counsel claim. Trial counsel had in his possession\n-- or his expert certainly had in his possession the\nphotograph that showed an entire tube of blood missing.\nTherefore, he had evidence that there was something\nwrong with the blood. Trial counsel was actually\nconcerned about this blood. He filed a pretrial motion\nto suppress this blood evidence. Here's trial counsel\nwith evidence that blood is missing. He knows it's a\ncritical issue in the case and he failed to go out and\nhire someone like the assistant chief medical examiner\nfor the State of Tennessee who came into Federal court\nand testified as to the -- that the source of this\nblood was, in fact, that empty tube.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That -- that would be an\nimportant point if, in fact, it conclusively\nestablished that the blood was not the blood of the\nvictim, but I don't think it does conclusively\nestablish that, and if it doesn't, the -- the less than\nperfect performance of counsel is -- is no basis for\nsetting aside the conviction.\nMR. KISSINGER: Your Honor, two matters on\nthat. Again, the proof of innocence does not have to\nbe absolute. This Court stated in Schlup that the fact\nthat there is still some evidence of guilt or that\nthere still exists even substantial evidence of guilt\ndoes not prevent a defendant from passing through the\nSchlup gateway.\nThe second matter and one which I think is\nimportant is that as a matter of Tennessee law, a\ncircumstantial evidence case requires not only that the\nprosecution prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt,\nbut that it eliminate all reasonable hypotheses of\ninnocence. So even if a jury could conclude that the\nblood came during -- that the blood got on the jeans\nduring the course of the crime, it would also have to\nbe able -- it would also have to be probable that the\nsame jury would also conclude that it was an\nimpossibility for Mr. Blake -- Dr. Blake's testimony to\nbe correct. So, in fact, it's Dr. Blake's testimony\nwhich has to be impossible to -- to accept in order for\na jury to find --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: At one point--\nMR. KISSINGER: -- a reasonable juror to find\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Justice Scalia said blood\nof the victim. You don't contest that this was the\nblood of the victim. The question is at what point did\nit get transferred to the jeans.\nMR. KISSINGER: That's correct, Justice\nGinsburg.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There's no question about\nit being someone else's blood.\nMR. KISSINGER: That's correct, Justice\nGinsburg. The question has been, from the beginning of\nthis case, when the blood came to get on Mr. House's\njeans.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right. And -- and the point\nof controversy is whether a spill of -- of the -- of\nthe blood in -- in the course of transport could have\nproduced this -- this kind of -- of spattering,\nincluding a spattering on the inside of -- of the\ntrousers near the button. It -- it seems to me\nunlikely, and -- and I am unable to say that no\nreasonable jury -- juror could not think it unlikely.\nMR. KISSINGER: Justice Scalia, I -- I would\ndisagree with -- with the Court's analysis there. I --\nI think what -- what the issue here is more whether,\ngiven the testimony of Dr. Blake, given the\ncorroborating evidence that supports Dr. Blake's\ntestimony, would a reasonable juror have doubts or\nwould any reasonable juror have a -- retain a\nreasonable -- excuse me --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's much more than that.\nMR. KISSINGER: Let me rephrase that, Justice\nScalia. The question is, given the Tennessee jury\ninstruction --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Any reasonable juror would\nhave had to have a reasonable doubt.\nMR. KISSINGER: Yes, thank you, Justice\nBreyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. And you're\nsaying yes, any reasonable juror would have had to have\na reasonable doubt irrespective of what the trial judge\nfound.\nMR. KISSINGER: That's correct, Justice\nBreyer.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the -- so the --\nwe would have to be finding in this case, if we ruled\nin your favor, that we think the trial judge is\nunreasonable.\nMR. KISSINGER: Your Honor, that's actually\nnot correct either. Schlup specifically says that the\nfunction of the district judge in a Schlup hearing is\nnot to make an independent judgment on the evidence in\nfront of him, but to make a probabilistic determination\nof the effect of the evidence on a reasonable juror.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, but surely he's supposed\nto make factual determinations. We -- I -- I don't\nwant to make factual determinations on all these\nquestions. That's -- that's not our system of law.\nThose factual determinations are made by the trial\njudge. And here, I agree with you that we don't have\nto accept his judgment as to what a reasonable juror\nwould have done, but I do think that we have to accept\nhis factual findings as accurate unless they're clearly\nerroneous. And here, he made the factual finding that\nthat blood was there before the transport. And I -- I\nthink I'm bound by that unless you can show that it is\nclearly erroneous, which I don't think you can.\nMR. KISSINGER: Your Honor, first, we -- we\nbelieve we have -- have shown that it's clearly\nerroneous.\nSecond, even viewing the blood evidence\nseparately, even saying, well, Mr. House has put up\nsome evidence of -- some evidence of innocence\nregarding this blood evidence, but not enough to really\nsway me regarding that, that evidence itself has to be\nviewed in light of the entire record. And in light of\nthe entire record, that blood evidence, standing alone\nin its even somewhat compromised state, no reasonable\njuror would be able to come to the conclusion that Mr.\nHouse was guilty because the remaining evidence of his\ninnocence is also very substantial.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Are you going to mention\nany of the other, or are we going to just deal with the\nblood today?\nMR. KISSINGER: Justice O'Connor, we -- we\nwould like to move on to -- to some of the other\nevidence because it -- it is substantial. And we've\nset -- we've set out a lot of that evidence beginning\nat page 6 of our reply brief.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Will you also cover,\nbecause your time is short, if you get through the\ngateway on your actual innocence contention, what are\nyour constitutional claims that lie behind it? Because\nI don't think much was said about that in the briefing.\nWhat is it that you would -- you would say if you got\nthrough the gate?\nMR. KISSINGER: Justice Ginsburg, as -- as I\nmentioned earlier, we believe that we have numerous\ninstances of ineffective assistance of counsel. First,\ncounsel's failure to -- upon knowing of the importance\nof the blood evidence, which he clearly did because he\nraised -- raised the issue himself, upon knowing of the\nphotograph showing the missing blood, he failed to go\nforward and basically do what we did in Federal court,\nwhich was hire an expert to look at the results of the\nFBI testing and to determine whether there was a viable\ndefense -- a viable defense strategy available there,\nwhich he did not.\nAlso, if we look at the record in this case,\nwe have a situation where trial counsel also pointed\ntoward Hubert Muncey, Jr. as the actual perpetrator of\nthis crime. He actually called the sister of the\nvictim to say that his sister was afraid of Mr. Muncey\nand that she had plans to leave him. When we look at\nwhat was available to trial counsel there, we see five\nwitnesses, many of whom were friends of Mr. Muncey, who\npresented evidence that showed that on the night of Ms.\nMuncey's murder, Mr. Muncey and Ms. Muncey had a fight\nat the C&C Recreation Center, that Ms. Muncey went\nhome, that Mr. Muncey followed her there, that he\nconfessed that when he returned home, he was angry and\ndrunk, that they began to argue again, that he struck\nher in the head, that she fell, that he checked her\nlifeless body and found she was dead, and that he hid\nher body in the bushes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but the -- the\ninjuries on the body are simply not consonant with --\nwith that manner of her -- of her death. A police\nofficer testified not only to a head injury, but to\nblood coming out of the nose and ears, scratches and\nbruises on her throat and legs, scratches on her face.\nThat simply is not consonant with one whack on the\nhead.\nMR. KISSINGER: Justice Scalia, there --\nthere are two issues there. In fact, the -- the\npathologist's testimony and -- and the law enforcement\nofficer's testimony is consistent to the extent that\nthe injuries which Mr. Muncey described inflicting\nwere, in fact, inflicted upon the victim. There were\nthose injuries. The point -- the fact that there were\nadditional injuries to the victims -- to the victim\nassumes that somehow Mr. Muncey's independent, short\nconfession, because, remember, when he started to\nconfess -- after he makes this confession, he's rushed\nout of the home and told that they don't want to hear\nanything. This isn't a situation like a law\nenforcement -- a confession made to law enforcement\nwhere once obtaining evidence of guilt, law enforcement\npursues and tries to get as many of the details out of\nit. I don't believe that it would be -- it's\nsignificant or it would be significant to any\nreasonable juror that Mr. Muncey did not describe every\nsingle injury that he inflicted on Ms. Muncey that\nnight.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You've mentioned -- in\nresponse to Justice Ginsburg, you didn't mention -- and\nperhaps it was inadvertent. If not, I want to know why\nnot. I thought if you get through the gate, what\nyou're going to say is the State should have given us\nevidence that they had that showed that Mr. Muncey had\nsexual relations with his wife the morning of the\nkilling, and therefore, the semen that they found\ndidn't necessarily belong to your client, but rather\nbelonged to him. As it turned out, it didn't.\nMR. KISSINGER: That's correct, Justice\nBreyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So you're going to make that\nBrady claim.\nMR. KISSINGER: We -- we are going to also\nmake the Brady claim. In addition, Your Honor, if\nindeed that evidence was available to trial counsel,\nwho did talk to Mr. Muncey, who was able to interview\nMr. Muncey, and failed to ask Mr. Muncey whether he had\nhad sexual relationships with his wife, even though\ntrial counsel attempted ineffectively at trial to -- to\nshow that -- that that semen belonged to Mr. Muncey.\nSo it's one of those situations, Justice Breyer, where\nthere is either Brady for the State's failure to turn\nit over, or if it was available, it's another instance\nof ineffective assistance of counsel.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, could I step\n-- step back a little bit to get -- to get back to the\nstandard of review? Because I think it's an unusual\none. You started out by talking about what the first\njury knew and didn't know, but we are in no sense\nreviewing that jury determination. Correct?\nMR. KISSINGER: That is correct, Justice\nRoberts.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We are supposed to\nlook at all of the evidence, the new evidence and the\nold evidence, and determine simply whether or not it\nwould be unreasonable for any juror to vote to convict\non the basis of all of that evidence. Is that right?\nMR. KISSINGER: Your Honor, what Schlup says\nis that we are to step back and see whether it is more\nlikely than not that no -- that any reasonable juror\nwould vote to convict.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Any reasonable juror would\nhave to have a reasonable doubt.\nMR. KISSINGER: Would have -- would have --\nthat's correct, Justice Breyer.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, in other words,\nno reasonable juror -- no -- no juror could reasonably\nvote to convict. In other words, if we look at this\nevidence and think that -- and again, we're not\nreviewing the prior jury's evidence. If we look at\nthis and say, maybe a jury would come out 10 to 2 in\nfavor of acquittal, if we think that would be\nreasonable, then you lose. Right?\nMR. KISSINGER: Chief Justice Roberts, I --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Under my hypothetical\nthere are two reasonable jurors who vote to convict.\nMR. KISSINGER: Chief Justice Roberts, the\ndanger in that hypothetical is that we are approaching\nan area where the definition of the reasonable juror\nbecomes something subjective. The definition of a\nreasonable juror is not a subjective inquiry. In fact,\nit's a -- it's an objective inquiry. So to that\nextent, I would have to disagree with -- with your\nanalysis or your -- or your hypothetical, which is that\nmaybe there might be two jurors out there who would\nlisten to this evidence and vote to convict Mr. House.\nI don't think that's a correct statement --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, Schlup shouldn't --\nshouldn't have expressed it that way then. Schlup must\nhave -- must have made a big mistake when it said no\nreasonable juror could. It should have expressed it\ndifferently and said a reasonable juror would not --\nwould not have found, but they didn't say that. It\nsaid no reasonable juror.\nMR. KISSINGER: Your Honor, I believe the\nCourt in -- I believe the Court in Schlup took the word\nreasonable to encompass the point which I have just\nmade.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, didn't -- you -- you\nhave accepted Justice Scalia's formulation, but my\nunderstanding is that Schlup did not say no reasonable\njuror could. Schlup said no reasonable juror would\nhave. Isn't that correct?\nMR. KISSINGER: And that's correct, Justice\nSouter.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But I mean, it's would, not\ncould.\nMR. KISSINGER: It -- it is would.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Could would imply a\nsufficiency of evidence possibility of analyzing it,\nbut the would language excludes a sufficiency of\nevidence. The -- the would formulation says, in\neffect, what would the reasonable juror actually have\ndone. Is that your understanding? I mean, is that\nyour point?\nMR. KISSINGER: That is, Justice Souter.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Or more precisely, what\nwould all reasonable jurors have done.\nMR. KISSINGER: What would any reasonable\njuror, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: All reasonable jurors.\nMR. KISSINGER: I believe the language is\nany.\nWell, if there are no more questions, I'd\nlike to reserve the remainder of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nKissinger.\nMs. Smith, we'll hear now from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JENNIFER SMITH\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. SMITH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe evidence presented in the district court\nfails to raise sufficient doubt about Mr. House's guilt\nto justify review of his procedurally defaulted claims\nbecause reasonable jurors would not ignore the fact\nthat Mr. House's jeans were stained with the blood of\nCarolyn Muncey. That is a fact that has not been\nundermined by any of the evidence presented in the\nFederal habeas proceeding.\nThe enzymatic degradation theory of Dr. Blake\nwas so thoroughly discredited in the Federal\nevidentiary hearing that it is highly unlikely that any\nreasonable juror, viewing all the evidence, would be\nconvinced by it, let alone that everyone would vote to\nacquit in light of it. In fact, the petitioner's\nevidence of innocence was disputed in nearly every\nrespect and sorely --\nJUSTICE BREYER: How was -- how was that? I\nthought you'd go on to say how that -- how was it? I\n-- I read that Dr. Blake said this. He said, look, I\n-- there -- there are tiny little specks of blood on\nthe jeans and we test them. They were tested. And\nthey show that a certain enzyme deteriorated to degree\nX, and that's true of the test tube blood as well.\nBoth deteriorated to degree X. But if you take fresh\nblood and splatter it, there will be no deterioration.\nSo conclusion: the blood on the jeans came from the\ntest tube. Now, you say that was discredited, but I\ndidn't read anywhere anything that discredited it.\nWhat was the discrediting of that?\nMS. SMITH: That was specifically discredited\nby the -- by the testimony of Agent Bigbee.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Who said?\nMS. SMITH: Dr. Blake's specific opinion was\nthat his interpretation of the enzyme marker study,\nspecifically the GLO1 enzyme on the jeans and on the\nvial --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Right.\nMS. SMITH: -- showed inc -- inc --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMS. SMITH: -- which he took to mean\nincomplete penetrance.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMS. SMITH: Agent Bigbee specifically\ndisputed not only the literal interpretation of that,\nin that it doesn't mean incomplete penetrance. In\nfact, Agent Bigbee did not know what that even meant in\nthe area of serology, but he -- he disagreed with the\nmeaning that Dr. Blake ascribed to that -- to that\ndefinition -- to that notation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Which meant what?\nMS. SMITH: Which Dr. Blake concluded that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Was incomplete, and what did\nthe FBI man say it was?\nMS. SMITH: Agent Bigbee testified -- or Dr.\nBlake testified that the inc meant that the enzyme was\nnot present, that it had dropped out.\nJUSTICE BREYER: He -- he says it meant\nincomplete. And what do you -- what did -- what did\nDr. Bigbee say it --\nMS. SMITH: Dr. Blake said it was not\npresent. It had dropped out. Agent --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now -- I -- Dr. Blake, you\njust said, said that the word inc meant incomplete.\nMS. SMITH: That's correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And you say Dr. Bigbee\ndiscredited that by saying, no, it didn't mean that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's Agent Bigbee. I'm\ngetting confused.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It meant something else.\nWhat is the something else?\nMS. SMITH: Agent Bigbee testified that inc\nmeans --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Means.\nMS. SMITH: -- inconclusive --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Fine. Now, all right --\nMS. SMITH: -- which means that the enzyme is\npresent --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Fine, okay.\nMS. SMITH: -- but that he could not subtype\nit.\nJUSTICE BREYER: They don't know how much.\nNow, I have on page 119, which they cite, of\nthe transcript Mr. Pruden is talking to Mr. -- Dr.\nBlake. Would your opinion change, doctor, if the,\nquote, inc notation meant inconclusive rather than\nincomplete penetration? Answer: same difference.\nQuestion: so your opinion would not change? Answer:\nthat is correct.\nMS. SMITH: But the -- the dispute goes\nbeyond the literal interpretation of the inc. It goes\nto the meaning ascribed to it. And Agent Bigbee\ndisagreed that Dr. Blake -- with Dr. Blake's conclusion\nthat the inc indicated that the enzyme had dropped out\nof the sample. He said it was present. It could not\nbe typed.\nAgent Bigbee also disagreed with Dr. Blake's\noverarching theory that there was equal deterioration\nin the vials -- in the blood in the vials and the\nblood on the pants. In fact, Agent Bigbee went through\nstep by step --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But it would have been the\neasiest thing in the world for you if, in fact, you\nthink that this is not true that enzyme GL706BX,\ncontrary to what Dr. Blake said, had not deteriorated\nin the blood spot, do a test. Find out if it's\ndeteriorated or not. Can't -- can't that be done?\nI mean, Dr. Blake in this part is reading his\nown report. His own report says the enzyme\ndeteriorated in the spots on the jeans, and I see\nnothing here that says to the contrary. But if that\nweren't true, the blood is right there, and if it\nweren't true that it had deteriorated, I would have\nexpected testimony, at the least, saying no, Dr. Blake,\nyou are wrong.\nMS. SMITH: Your Honor, that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The blood did not\ndeteriorate. The enzyme did not deteriorate. But\nthere is no such testimony. Instead, you seem to be\nrelying on the difference between the word incomplete\nand inconclusive, a difference that Dr. Blake says is\ninconclusive or incomplete.\nMS. SMITH: Dr. Blake was not reading his own\nreport. Dr. Blake performed no independent analysis.\nDr. Blake was reading Agent Bigbee's report. Agent\nBigbee was explaining to the district court the meaning\nof the notations that he included in his report.\nBut the -- but the dispute goes beyond just\nexperts.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So Bigbee -- Bigbee\nwas explaining what he meant when he wrote inc.\nMS. SMITH: That's correct, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And it was different\nthan what Dr. Blake said it meant.\nMS. SMITH: That's correct, Your Honor. The\nreport at issue was a report prepared pretrial by Agent\nBigbee when he did the -- the initial enzyme analysis.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The district court heard all\nof this, didn't it, all this evidence, and -- and\ndidn't the district court make a factual finding?\nMS. SMITH: That's correct, Your Honor. Not\nonly did the district court note --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, we -- we can call in\nthese witnesses ourselves, I suppose, and hear them all\nagain, but we usually accept the factual findings of\nthe trier of fact.\nMS. SMITH: That's correct, Your Honor. And\nthe district court specifically found as a fact that\nthe blood spill --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But does that finding rest\non the conclusion that Dr. Blake was not credible and\nAgent Bigbee was credible?\nMS. SMITH: I think that that conclusion\nimplicitly includes a finding that Agent Bigbee was --\nwas credible and Dr. Blake was not credible.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And that Dr. Blake was not\ncredible.\nMS. SMITH: There were additional --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And who -- what was Dr.\nBlake's background?\nMS. SMITH: Dr. Blake's background is -- is\nthat he was a forensic pathologist.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Employed often by the\nState?\nMS. SMITH: He was often employed by the\nState. He had a history of -- of being employed by the\nState. At this time, he was not a State agent, Your\nHonor. He was not -- had not worked in any way, shape,\nor form on this case. He did not perform the autopsy.\nHe did not view the body. He did not perform the\nenzyme marker study in this case. He simply came in\nand reviewed results and photographs that had been\nconducted and taken by -- by individuals previously.\nHe had no direct responsibility in this case aside from\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So you're -- you're\nbasically arguing he was not a credible witness.\nMS. SMITH: He was not a credible witness,\nYour Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What -- what is the answer\nto my question? Because I do think it turns on this.\nA lot does. The trial judge sat there and said this is\nvery important. Dr. Blake is quoting from something\ncalled part 5, which I thought was his report. And\nthen the trial judge says, where did you get that idea?\nWhere did you get that idea, that the -- that the\nenzyme wasn't there in -- in the jeans' blood? Where\ndid you get it? And he says I got it from the FBI\nreport, I think. He's not certain because he's\nremembering his own conclusion. He isn't quite sure\nwhere he got it from.\nAnd now it turns out that the inc when they\n-- it said inc, which he thought meant there isn't much\nenzyme there. And then they say, well, maybe it meant\ninconclusive. And he says, that wouldn't matter because\nI guess I took it to mean that too would show there\nwasn't much enzyme there. Both would come to the same\nthing.\nAnd now, if I'm sitting there and thinking,\nI'm thinking, well, either there is or there isn't this\nenzyme in the -- in the blood that's right there.\nEasiest thing in the world to prove. And if somebody\nis going to dispute it, the State will come back and\nsay, no, no, the enzyme is there. But they didn't.\nSo I read the testimony and I read the fact\nthat you didn't dispute it with any evidence that's\nsaying, yes, the enzyme is not there.\nMS. SMITH: Your Honor, Agent Bigbee\nspecifically testified that the enzyme was there.\nJUSTICE BREYER: He did? Where is that?\nMS. SMITH: He specifically testified on page\n282 of the joint appendix. He specifically said, that\ndoesn't mean it wasn't present. He also pointed out\nGLO should have been present --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Let's --\nMS. SMITH: -- and said it wasn't.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It doesn't mean it isn't\npresent isn't quite the same thing, is it?\nMS. SMITH: Agent Bigbee specifically\ntestified that the enzyme was present. It could not be\ntyped to any degree of certainty. So he simply called\nit inconclusive but that it was present. If it had not\nbeen present, he would have marked it N/A, meaning no\nactivity, which was also included in the report in a\nseparate location.\nBut I think it goes beyond --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Smith, would -- could\nyou focusing on this, what's called a finding, although\nthe district judge himself puts it under conclusions of\nlaw, just -- the court concludes that the spillage\noccurred after the FBI crime laboratory received and\ntested the evidence. What is the basis, the specific\nbasis, for that conclusion, that it occurred after the\nFBI tested the evidence?\nMS. SMITH: The specific basis identified\nexplicitly in the opinion was that Special Agent Scott,\nwhen he removed the -- the blue jeans from the hamper\nin Donna Turner's trailer, saw what appeared to be\nbloodstains on the jeans. That blood ultimately ended\nup testing as -- as positive for blood and, in fact,\nCarolyn Muncey's blood so that -- so that the stains\nwere observed when they were removed from the hamper.\nHe also noted that Agent Bigbee testified when he\nreceived the blood at the -- the FBI laboratory, there\nwas no evidence of contamination.\nAgent Bigbee testified to the FBI protocols\nand said that if there had been any evidence of\ncontamination or spillage, the evidence would have been\nreturned without testing. So he looked specifically at\nthat.\nHe also looked and specifically pointed out a\nsignificant -- the testimony of Paulette Sutton, who\nindicated -- who was the blood spatter expert. She\nindicated that some of the bloodstains were mixed with\nmud, and to her that indicated that there had not been\nsome accidental spillage in -- in an evidence\ncontainer, that the mud and the blood would have --\nwere -- were combined to the extent that they would\nhave had to get on the jeans at or near the same time.\nSo those -- those things --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but then there was\nalso the evidence that was not disputed, that it was a\ndry day and that there was no mud at all at the scene\nof the crime.\nMS. SMITH: Your Honor, I'm not sure that the\nevidence is undisputed that it was a dry day. If you\nlook at the autopsy report that's in -- that's in\nevidence in -- in the trial record, it specifically\nsays that it was drizzling that day, that the\ntemperature was between 80 and 90 degrees and it was\ndrizzling. Mr. House showed up with blood all over his\njeans. He got the blood somewhere. I don't -- nothing\nis -- I don't think it's entirely clear that -- that\nthe conditions were dry. His -- his jeans were clearly\nmuddy --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that was --\nMS. SMITH: -- and it showed up.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that it was agreed that\nthere -- that the site where the body was found, that\nthat was dry, that that was dry ground. I thought\nthere was no dispute about that.\nMS. SMITH: I'm not sure that -- that it's\nclear where Mr. House got the mud on his jeans. He was\n-- he traveled some distance from the site of the body\nand -- and to his home. He could have gotten muddy en\nroute. I -- I can't explain how he got the blood on\nhis jeans. I know he showed up with muddy jeans. He\ngot mud on his jeans at some point, and those -- and\nthe mud and the blood were -- were intermingled. I'm\nnot sure that they got on there at the same time.\nI'm also not sure that the mud that Paulette\nSutton saw was -- was created by a combination of mud\nand water. It could have been perspiration. It could\nhave been any other type of -- of fluid. It could have\nbeen blood creating the mud.\nSo it's -- that is -- that's very ambiguous,\nand -- and I think that the fact -- the significance of\nthe testimony is that it -- it did not indicate an\naccidental spillage after the fact of the blood onto\nthe jeans. And I think that was -- that was the point\nthat the district court took from that. He wasn't\ntrying to -- to recreate the exact sequence of events\nin the crime. He was simply trying to pinpoint at what\npoint the blood spilled because there's no question the\nblood spilled. The -- the photograph shows it spilled.\nThe photograph shows that the -- that the tops had\ncome off. But the -- the photograph also shows --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but isn't there also\nevidence that the spillage in the Styrofoam container\nseemed to be inadequate to account for all of the blood\nthat was missing from the vial?\nMS. SMITH: I think there was testimony that\n-- that the appearance of it seemed to be inadequate.\nThere was no specific quantification of the blood, and\n-- and no one -- no one attempted to do that. It's not\nclear whether some of the blood leaked out of the\ncontainer and maybe wasn't contained within it. There\nwere -- there were pieces of gauze that had blood\nsoaked in it. There was also a dispute about the size\nof the vials.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but that's important\nfor this whole question. Quantity relates to chain of\ncustody.\nMS. SMITH: Your Honor, I think what's\nimportant is the point of the spillage. If -- if the\nblood spilled after it left the FBI lab -- and that was\na specific finding made by the district court, and that\nfinding is clearly supported by the record. What\nhappened to the blood, where it spilled after the fact\n-- and we know that it did spill -- really is -- is\nbeside the point because --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Another blood question\nbecause I -- the -- you make a point of the -- the\nsheriff having said, well, I -- I saw blood on the\njeans. So I looked at the pictures and the pictures\nseem to have little tiny bits of blood, while a lot of\nmud. So I came to the conclusion that no reasonable\nperson could think that that testimony really shows\nthat the -- that there was -- there was blood from the\n-- from the victim on his jeans.\nNow, am I right about that? You're going to\nthink I'm wrong, and I want to hear why.\nMS. SMITH: Well, I do think you're wrong,\nYour Honor, because I -- I think that if you look in\nthe record, there are at least four witnesses who\nindicated that they saw the blood. One was Special\nAgent Scott.\nJUSTICE BREYER: How could you have? It's so\ntiny.\nMS. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, the -- the\nphotographs that you have are photographs that are\ntaken after portions of the jeans have been cut out and\nsent for testing. You're not seeing everything that --\nthat the agent saw. Special Agent Scott saw what he\nbelieved to be blood. He couldn't -- he didn't know it\nwas blood, but -- but he suspected it was blood. He\nidentified in -- in the habeas proceeding the areas\nthat he believed it to be blood, and it turned out to\nbe blood.\nJerry Morissey, who was the defense\nserologist and -- and, incidentally, just to -- that\nreminds me of -- of a comment made by my colleague in\nhis argument about defense counsel's deficiency in not\n-- in not hiring a serological expert. He had a\nserological expert. Jerry Morissey testified, was a\nserologist, and testified that he received the jeans\nafter the FBI tested it. He was unable to duplicate\nthe result, but as part of his testimony, he said that\nhe observed some bloodstains, what he thought to be\nbloodstains, around the FBI cuttings, and he attempted\nto do additional testing on those bloodstains. So he\nsaw the stains.\nAgent Bigbee testified that he observed the\nstains. He didn't say that some were big or some were\nsmall. He said that he observed them.\nAs well, Paulette Sutton in the Federal\nhabeas proceeding said that she saw the stains. She\nsaid she couldn't tell upon observation that it was\nblood, but it was dark and she suspected it was blood.\nIt was suspicious.\nSo we have at least four witnesses who say\nthey saw this blood. This wasn't microscopic. This\nwas something that -- that witnesses -- and\nincidentally, Paulette Sutton's observation was borne\nout because she did presumptive testing. So the things\nthat -- the spots that she suspected were blood in fact\nturned out to be blood.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Smith, could -- could\nyou go on to some of the other elements that are\ncontested here? In particular, I'm interested in -- in\nMr. Muncey's confession. What -- what do you -- what\ndo you say about that?\nMS. SMITH: Your Honor, I -- I think of all\nthe evidence presented below, I think that the\nconfession evidence is -- is perhaps the least reliable\nin terms of -- of the Schlup analysis.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: What did the jury hear\nabout Muncey's confession?\nMS. SMITH: The jury was never informed of\nMuncey's confession because the --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: I thought not.\nMS. SMITH: -- the fact of Muncey's\nconfession didn't come up until 13-14 years after the\ntrial had already been concluded. And -- and that's\none of the things that the district court, in -- in\nexamining their testimony, found what was significant\nin his --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But wasn't the district\ncourt incorrect in that? Because as I understand it,\nthere was evidence from one of the two witnesses who\nput in the confession evidence that she had gone to the\nsheriff's department to -- to tell them about the\nconfession and had simply gotten a runaround and\nfinally left. So as I understand it, the -- the record\nwould not support the finding that -- that the -- the\nsources of evidence simply kept silent for over a\ndecade.\nMS. SMITH: Well, that's what the witness\ntestified to, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, is there any reason\nnot -- did the -- did the district court explain that\nit was rejecting that element of the witnesses'\ntestimonies?\nMS. SMITH: The district court did not\nspecifically address that element of the witnesses'\ntestimony. The court found that it -- specifically\nthat it was not impressed with the testimony of a\nwitness who waits. And -- and this Court has said on\nmany occasions that --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I know, but without getting\nto that point, it sounds as though the district court\nsimply made a mistake, just forgot I suppose, the\nevidence that the witness didn't wait at all.\nMS. SMITH: Your Honor, regardless of whether\nthe witness waited or not, the Court examined the\ncredibility of the testimony and found that it wasn't\ncredible.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, but one of the reasons\nfor the finding of -- of incredibility was the decade\nor more of silence.\nMS. SMITH: That was one of the reasons, but\nthe primary reason that the -- that the confession\nitself was inconsistent with the other evidence, and\nthat was what the court specifically pointed to in his\nopinion.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, the -- tell -- help me\nout here. As -- as has been explored earlier, the\nconfession referred to -- to some of the injuries on\nthe body, but not to all of them. Were there -- were\nthere other disparities between the confession and --\nand the -- and other evidence?\nMS. SMITH: There were several disparities,\nYour Honor. The confession indicates that there was\napparently an extensive argument at home. The\ntestimony of the daughter both at trial and in the\nhabeas corpus proceeding was that there was no such\nargument. She heard no argument. And the court,\nincidentally, found her testimony to be very credible.\nHe observed her demeanor and -- and found her\ntestimony to be credible. So that's inconsistent.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, as far as that's\nconcerned, she did testify that there was a car out\nthere.\nMS. SMITH: That's correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And the rest of the story\ndoesn't -- doesn't put the defendant House at the time\nof the crime in a car. He's walking.\nMS. SMITH: Your Honor, the -- the testimony\nat trial was ambiguous about the -- about the car. The\nwitness identified two separate incidents. She heard a\ncar and she heard someone inquire as to Mr. Muncey's\nwhereabouts, and then she also heard an individual come\nand tell her -- her mother that her father had been in\na wreck down by the creek and heard her mother leave\nsobbing. Those are two distinct incidences. And Lora\nMuncey testified that she did not know whether she had\ngone back to sleep. She never could identify or -- or\ndefine the specific length of time between the two.\nBut logically those are two separate\nincidences. It doesn't make sense for someone to come\nand ask where Mr. Muncey is and then to say, well, he's\ndown by the creek. He just had a wreck. So it -- it\nseems that just logically those are two separate\nincidences, and there's nothing in the -- in the\ntestimony to indicate that -- that they're same.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But they happened at the\nsame time, didn't they? The --\nMS. SMITH: No, Your Honor. The --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the child testified to\nwhat she heard, and I thought she heard a car and\nsomeone in a low voice, and then her mother left with\nthat someone.\nMS. SMITH: No, Your Honor. She heard a car\nand someone inquire as to the whereabouts of her\nfather, and she heard her mother answer. And then\nthere was a period of time where she said she wasn't\nsure whether she went back to sleep or not, and then\nshe heard a person with a low voice come in and inform\nher mother that she -- that -- that her father, Hubert\nMuncey, Jr., had been in a wreck down by the creek.\nShe heard her mother sob and leave with the individual\nwho had relayed that information. Those are two\ndistinct incidences.\nBut beyond that -- the -- the court,\nincidentally, found her testimony to be very credible,\nfound that her testimony did not support this -- this\ntheory of some sort of confrontation in the house.\nIn addition, the court also heard the live\ntestimony of Hubert Muncey, Jr. himself, explaining his\nwhereabouts, explaining -- and actually denying ever\nhaving made the statement. And -- and the court\nbalanced that.\nAs well, Dennis Wallace, who testified at the\nevidentiary hearing -- he investigated a missing\nperson's report. He was in the home. He saw no\nevidence of any sort of struggle in the home.\nSo all of these things balanced against this\n-- this confession, which has absolutely no\ncorroborative support in the record, the court found\nthat the testimony simply wasn't credible.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it did have\ncorroboration. Wasn't there a -- a wound on the victim\nthat was consistent with -- with the confession?\nMS. SMITH: There was a -- a wound to the\nvictim's left forehead.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Was that not consistent\nwith the confession?\nMS. SMITH: The confession was that Mr.\nMuncey hit her and she fell and hit her head.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You tell me yes or no. Was\nit -- was it consistent with the confession?\nMS. SMITH: It -- it could be consistent with\nthe confession. It was -- it was very sketchy. There\n-- there was a dispute between the two pathologists in\nthe habeas as to whether or not that -- that wound\ncould have been sustained by -- by falling and hitting\nher head on a table and actually could have created\nthe -- the damage in -- in the brain.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So overall, if -- looking at\nthis -- and that's why I think the question about the\nweight to give to the fact finding is important. You\nthink -- you have a theory under which he could have\ndone it, and it's certainly possible in my opinion.\nBut also you think, my goodness, if he did\nit, going and this luring of the woman to the creek --\nyou know, there's nothing else in the record that\nsuggests he would plot in that way to do this.\nNothing. The husband is away at the time from the\ndance. He could have done it. They are fighting.\nThey could have done it. And if the luring theory\ncorrect, the motive was sexual, but the sexual physical\nevidence is from the husband, not from him.\nSo the jury is brought into this on a theory\nthat there is a sexual attack and the one -- by the\ndefendant, and the one thing that seems disproved\npretty much is that. And now we have two experts, Dr.\nBlake and Dr. Bigbee. And reading a page, which I\nhadn't read thoroughly until you pointed it out, I'd\nsay they might disagree. They might disagree. And\nit's just not conclusive.\nSo if you're sitting there, do you have to\nhave a reasonable doubt when there's such strong\nevidence for both people? And -- and the part that's\nbothering me -- I -- I see what that district judge\nsaid on that one point, which he may have thought was\nperipheral but it turns out to be quite important about\nwhen the blood spilled. But if you look to the\nunderlying thing and I think, well, maybe you're right,\nbut maybe you're not right.\nAnd so how do -- how do I -- how do I do\nthis? What's the -- what's the weighing? I sit there\nand think, my goodness, I don't know who committed this\ncrime if I'd been on that jury. And could -- could a\nperson sitting there reasonably come to a conclusion,\nmy goodness, I know?\nMS. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, I think to\nanswer your question is if you are at that mental state\nwhere you are saying maybe this evidence is right, maybe\nthat -- that evidence is right, maybe I can go one way\nor another, then I think the respondent prevails in this\ncase --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, but that -- that simply\nsays if the -- it seems to me you're simply saying there\nwould be sufficient evidence to go the one way rather\nthan the other. And -- and you may well be right about\nthat, but that certainly is not the reasonable doubt\nstandard.\nMS. SMITH: I think it goes beyond just\nhaving sufficient evidence to convict, Your Honor. I\nthink you also look at these credibility determinations\nand you look at the probabilistic result of a\nreasonable juror.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Justice Breyer has not heard\nthese witnesses and hasn't had the opportunity to know\nwhether -- whether, for example, these -- this\ntestimony about the confession was credible or not.\nMS. SMITH: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And the hearer of -- at the\ntrial did have that opportunity.\nMS. SMITH: The district court heard both of\nthe -- both of the sisters regarding the confession.\nThe district court heard Hubert Muncey, Jr. regarding\nthe alleged confession.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But -- but may I interrupt\nyou? What -- what about -- I want to just follow up on\nsomething that Justice Breyer alluded to and that is\nthe significance of the DNA evidence. And I have\ntended to -- to think that a reasonable juror would\nlook at it this way, but if I'm wrong, I -- I want you\nto comment on it.\nOne of the -- I -- I assume, to begin with,\nthat any reasonable juror would have found this\nevidence, the evidence of the semen stains, extremely\nsignificant because not only did the State argue rape\nas a -- as a motive, possible motive, but there was a\nspecific finding of an aggravated circumstance that the\nmurder occurred in the course of kidnapping and rape.\nI don't know of any evidence that would suggest an --\nan independent kidnapping crime without the rape\nelement under, you know, the circumstances of -- of\nthis crime. So I'm -- I -- I assume that the\nreasonable juror, having come to the conclusion that\nthat aggravating circumstance is true, found that a\nrape was being committed.\nIf that juror had heard the DNA evidence,\nthat juror would have said the only positive evidence\nthat a rape was committed here would be evidence that\npointed to the husband, not in fact to -- to the\ndefendant House. And if -- if a juror had heard that\nevidence, it seems to me it is highly unlikely that any\nreasonable juror would have concluded that that\naggravating circumstance was found, and I suppose that\nwould play a -- a significant role in -- in the\nultimate conclusion.\nNow, you have argued that the fact that the\nDNA evidence shows that it was the husband's fluids,\nnot House's, doesn't conclusively prove that House\ndidn't rape her, and of course, you're right. But my\nunderstanding is that there is no evidence from which\none would reasonably infer that House did this.\nNow, what is -- what is your comment on that\n--\nMS. SMITH: My comment -- sorry.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- analysis?\nMS. SMITH: My comment on the DNA evidence is\nthat the DNA evidence did nothing more than confirm\nwhat the jury was -- already knew was very likely,\nwhich was that the donor of the semen was the husband.\nThe jury at trial was informed that the husband -- and\nit went through several pages. In the joint appendix,\nit goes all the way from page 56 to 66 where we're\nexploring that the semen could have been deposited by\nthe husband or by Mr. House.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But there was a finding\nthat it was in the course of the rape.\nMS. SMITH: There was --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That was part of that.\nThat was -- that was one of the -- was it one of three\naggravating circumstances?\nMS. SMITH: One of three, and -- and that was\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It was found at the guilt\nphase or the trial phase, the aggravating circumstance?\nMS. SMITH: It was at -- it was an\naggravating circumstance of sentencing, that -- that\nthe murder was perpetrated in the -- in the attempt --\nin -- in the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate\nkidnapping or rape or attempted rape.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then at -- at a\nminimum, it seems to me that the sentencing phase is --\nis in question by that.\nBut also, it seems to me if I were a juror\nand was faced with these conflicting things, I would\nlook for motive.\nMS. SMITH: Your Honor, the motive is -- is\nwell supported by the circumstances. And in fact, if\nyou look at the prosecutor's argument --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There is evidence of rape\nbesides -- besides the semen. The semen wasn't the\nonly evidence of rape, was it?\nMS. SMITH: No, sir, it wasn't.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There were scratches on the\nthighs.\nMS. SMITH: There was --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but the semen was\nused to -- to connect it to the -- to the defendant,\nand we now know that that's wrong.\nMS. SMITH: The prosecutor argued at trial on\nthe motive question, why else would someone lure a\nwoman out of her home with a lie in the middle of the\nnight in her night clothes and take her out into the\nwoods, if not to have some sort of --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Who put in the evidence --\nwho put in the semen evidence?\nMS. SMITH: The State put in the semen\nevidence, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: They did that to prove\nshe had sex with her husband? Is that the reason?\n(Laughter.)\nMS. SMITH: The State put in the semen\nevidence because it was -- it was not inconsistent with\nMr. House and that there was other evidence in the\nrecord that was not -- all of the -- all this -- this\nphysical evidence was consistent with Mr. House, just\nas the semen was.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't it --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I get back to\nthis -- the standard of review question? Because it\ngoes directly to this point. Even if you think that\nthe argument based on the semen is not harmless error,\nin other words, that the prior jury may well have\nconvicted based on that, we're not reviewing that\njury's determination. Correct?\nMS. SMITH: That's correct, Your Honor.\nYou're looking at how -- how a reasonable juror would\nview the case if it knew --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So we should be\nlooking at the case with the semen evidence showing\nwhat we know it to show, regardless of whether we think\nthe prior jury was misled by the admission of that\nevidence.\nMS. SMITH: That's absolutely correct, Your\nHonor. If -- if the -- if a reasonable jury knew that\nthe semen belonged to Mr. -- belonged to Mr. Muncey and\nnot Mr. House, the result would be exactly the same\nbecause Carolyn Muncey's blood was all over Mr. House's\npants. That is an indisputable fact. And all of this\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about at the\nsentencing stage? Justice Kennedy brought it up. The\n-- the prosecutor didn't emphasize unduly the semen at\nthe -- at the guilt stage but, boy, made a big deal out\nof it at the sentencing stage.\nMS. SMITH: Your Honor, I disagree that --\nthat they made a big deal. They made a big deal of\nthe kidnapping at the sentencing phase. That was --\nthat was of significance. The -- what the prosecutor\ndid --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Where was it in the -- in\nthe joint appendix? I thought it was more than\nkidnapping.\nMS. SMITH: Your Honor, the -- the sentencing\nphase argument is not contained in -- in the joint\nappendix. The closing argument from the guilt phase is\ncontained in -- in the joint appendix, but it's\ncertainly in the -- in the transcripts before the\nCourt.\nWhat -- what the prosecutor focused on at\nsentencing was -- was the kidnapping and also was the\nmalice and -- and I'm sorry -- the -- specifically the\nkidnapping --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Said nothing about the\nsemen --\nMS. SMITH: The --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- at the -- at the\nsentencing stage?\nMS. SMITH: At the sentencing phase, the\nprosecutor said that the evidence would have been\nconsistent with sexual molestation, I think was the\nword that he used.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms. Smith.\nMS. SMITH: Thank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Kissinger, you\nhave 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN M. KISSINGER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. KISSINGER: Very quickly. Dr. Blake's\ntestimony was not, in fact, discredited. Counsel for\nrespondent says that -- places great significance on --\non Dr. Blake's interpretation of the initials inc as\nstanding for incomplete penetration, and that --\ncorrectly that should have been construed as\ninconclusive. Counsel fails to acknowledge the record\n-- record 4 of the district court, volume 6, page 906.\nAgent Bigbee himself uses the term inc to mean -- or\nincomplete, just as Dr. Blake did. So in addition to\nDr. Blake saying, yes, I meant the same thing as\nJustice Breyer observed, Justice Bigbee himself uses\nthe term inc to mean incomplete.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Page 282 of the joint\nappendix, he says inconclusive is what the inc stands\nfor. Dr. Blake testified it is incomplete penetration,\nwhich I haven't the foggiest idea what that means.\nMR. KISSINGER: And that's correct, Your\nHonor. In trial, he used -- he said that inc stands\nfor incomplete, and then Agent Bigbee at trial\nproceeded to use incomplete and inconclusive\ninterchangeably just as Dr. Blake did.\nIn addition, when -- concerning Dr. Blake's\ntestimony, we have to remember that we still have the\nmissing tube of blood, and the blood on the jeans is\nmore consistent with blood coming from the degraded\nblood sample than it is from blood which came -- got on\nthe jeans during the time of the offense.\nThe other thing, which I think is an\nimportant matter to -- to keep in -- keep in mind\nregarding Dr. Blake's testimony and Dr. Bigbee's, is\nthat Dr. Blake and Agent Bigbee both agree on the basic\nscience that blood enzymes deteriorate according the\nvarious environmental factors and that as they\ndeteriorate, they become less detectable.\nIn terms of the -- the implicit credibility\nfindings, which respondent relies upon, the district\ncourt during its opinion demonstrated that it know --\nit knew how to make credibility findings. In fact, it\nmade two specific credibility findings in this case\nwhen it found Mr. House's testimony to be incredible\nand the testimony of Lora Muncey to be credible.\nAs far as the -- the suggestion that, yes,\nthere was -- the crime scene was wet, that that -- that\nthere was water at -- or there's a possibility of mud\nat the crime scene, not only is this contradicted by\nthe absence of the mud -- of mud on the victim's\nclothing, but also the drizzling which counsel\ndescribed occurred on the day following the murder, not\nbefore it happened, not at the time the murder was\noccurring, but on the day following the murder. So, in\nfact, there was -- the murder scene was dry, just as\npetitioner has informed the Court.\nAs far as the daughter not hearing any sign\nof a struggle, the daughter's testimony was that she\ndid not hear any sign of a struggle when she got up\nimmediately after her mother left the home. The\ntestimony at the evidentiary hearing, unrebutted and\nunimpeached, was that at that point in time when she\nwas hearing nothing, her mother was, in fact, at the\nC&C Recreation Center involved in a fight with Hubert\nMuncey, Jr. In fact, that testimony goes to Mr.\nHouse's innocence because at the time she hears\nnothing, she hears no sign of a struggle, is the very\ntime that the State of Tennessee contended that Mr.\nHouse was out murdering Carolyn Muncey, and yet the\ndaughter who was outside of the home within 50 yards of\nwhere this murder occurred heard absolutely nothing.\nJustice Scalia asked was there, in fact,\nother evidence of -- of rape. Wasn't there, in fact,\nbruises found on her thighs? On cross examination, the\npathologist testified, admitted on cross examination,\nthat the scratches on Ms. Muncey's thighs were more\nlikely attributable to her being dragged through the\nbrush and her body being hidden which, incidentally, is\nan act which Mr. Muncey confessed to doing.\nIn addition, as I stated before, the evidence\nhas to be viewed in light of the entirety of the\nevidence of the record. It isn't just the blood\nevidence. It isn't just the semen evidence. It isn't\neven just the confession. It's also the fact that the\nsame witness who puts Mr. Muncey -- or who puts Mr.\nHouse even leaving the Donna Turner home on the night\nof the murder puts Mr. House leaving the home at a --\nthank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
