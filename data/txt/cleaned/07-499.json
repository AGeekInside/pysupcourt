PINCUS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. PINCUS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nA father forced at gunpoint to engage in\nincest with his daughter because of his religion, race,\nor political views, and told that he and his daughter\nwill be killed if he refuses, is far outside the class\nof persons brought to mind by the ordinary meaning of\nthe phrase at issue in this case, which is reprinted on\npage 1 of our brief, quoting from section (a)(42): \"Any\nperson who ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise\nparticipated in the persecution of any person\" on\naccount of a prohibited factor.\nThe same is true if -- of someone who, as\npart of the religious persecution directed against him,\nis forced on threat of death to disrupt a prayer meeting\nand injure his co-religionists. The father and the\nco-religionists are victims of persecution. They would\nnot be described in ordinary parlance as \"persecutors.\"\nAnd we think that that really under the Government's\nview, the persecutor bar turns solely on what they term\n\"objective effect of an individual's acts.\" But that\nmeans that the act need not be accompanied by any of the\nindicia of moral offensiveness that the law typically\nrequires, even if the individual acted under duress,\nunder threat of death, even if the individual did not\nknow that his conduct related to persecution, and even\nif the individual.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do we begin with the\nassumption that this is a Chevron deference case? And I\nthink Aguirre, INS v. Aguirre, would tell us that it is.\nIt was a different statute. Do we begin with that\nassumption?\nMR. PINCUS: Well, I think under Chevron\nthat, one, the first question is is there a gap to be\nfilled here? The language --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, do I begin with\nChevron?\nMR. PINCUS: Well, yes. We think Chevron\nsupplies the framework. The first question is, is there\nambiguity. We would -- we argue that here and our\nprincipal submission is that there is no ambiguity here\nand that there is therefore no occasion for deference.\nIf the Court were to disagree with that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I take it your\nposition is that there's no ambiguity in the way the\nterm is used in the statute, as opposed to no ambiguity\nin some abstract sense?\nMR. PINCUS: Yes, our submission,\nMr. Chief Justice, is that the phrase here, using the\nprinciple that the Court applied in Watson and looking\nat the phrase and looking at the picture that it brings\nto mind, would never bring to mind the examples that I\ncited as conduct that would be captured by this\nprovision.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Pincus, could I ask\nabout your description of the Government's position as\nsaying that it's purely objective and that there's no\nmental factor whatever. Is it clear that the Government\nnot only would not take into account coercion, the fact\nthat it was done under coercion, but also would not take\ninto account the fact that the individual even knew?\nMR. PINCUS: There are cases --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that he was persecuting\nsomebody?\nMR. PINCUS: Yes, Your Honor, there are\ncases, some of which that determination has been\nreversed by a court of appeals. But the BIA has taken\nthe position that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Has the Government taken\nthat position here in in this case?\nMR. PINCUS: The -- well, we pointed out\nthat that is the position that the BIA has taken and the\nGovernment has not disavowed it. So I don't know\nwhether they're --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I guess I should ask the\nGovernment?\nMR. PINCUS: Yes, Your Honor. But there\ncertainly have been a number of decisions along that\nline, including one, for example, where an individual\nwas told, you know, \"Stand here. \"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I could think that that's\nwrong without thinking that you also have to take into\naccount whether there was coercion.\nMR. PINCUS: You could, Your Honor, although\nthe underlying -- the Government's underlying theory for\nall three of its positions, both that coercion doesn't\nmatter, that knowledge doesn't matter, and that\nsubjective intent doesn't matter, is its view that these\nwords require only objective acts. Once you've\ndetermined that the words require something more --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but it's very -- -\nit's very common in -- in criminal statutes to require\nknowledge of the act. Indeed, if the person doesn't\nknow what he's doing, you know, he may be insane, but\nhe's not a criminal. Whereas, it is not automatically\nclear that the fact that the -- you killed somebody\nbecause otherwise they'd break your arm would -- would\nbe a justification. I mean, it seems to me the two are\nquite separable.\nMR. PINCUS: Well, two responses, Your\nHonor. Certainly in the criminal context, duress is a\nwell-recognized defense and this Court has said that in\nDixon and other cases. But I just want to be clear that\nthe knowledge that we are talking about here that the\nGovernment has disavowed is not knowledge that you\nengaged in an act. They don't -- they don't take the\nposition that sleepwalking is -- can be a persecutive\nact. But their view is even if you don't know that your\nact is contributing to persecution -- you're kept in the\ndark by the actual persecutors; they just ask you to do\nsomething that in fact is contributing to persecution --\n- they say that doesn't matter, and that it all rests on\nwhat we think is their wrong-headed construction of the\nstatute.\nI just want to return to --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Your position is that any\nthreat of serious injury is sufficient?\nMR. PINCUS: Excuse me?\nJUSTICE ALITO: Your position is that any\nthreat of serious injury is sufficient?\nMR. PINCUS: No, Your Honor. I mean,\nobviously --\nJUSTICE ALITO: But that's what your brief\nsays: \"Being forced upon threat of death or serious\ninjury to participate in the persecutory acts of his\noppressors.\"\nMR. PINCUS: Yes, and our position is that\nthat's a logical starting point. There is of course a\nbody of law that's been developed in the criminal\ncontext about the parameters about the defense of duress\nand that would be a pretty logical starting point, we\nthink. The Attorney General would have discretion, once\nthe Court corrected the view that the statute doesn't --\nthat coercion is irrelevant, just to, within the limits\nof Chevron, define what the coercion test is.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If someone said, if you\ndon't -- there are 500 men, women and children in a\nshed; if you don't administer lethal gas to them, we are\ngoing to administer 20 lashes, that would be sufficient\nin your view?\nMR. PINCUS: Well, under some -- under some\nconceptions of this defense, there is a balancing test\nbetween the threat that is directed against the\nindividual and the threat -- and what the injury that he\nis asked to carry out. That could be part of the test.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, that's not very\nhelpful. How would the balancing be struck? How would\nyou strike it there?\nMR. PINCUS: Well, what the courts have said\nin the criminal context is that there are three\ncriteria: An immediate threat of death or serious\nbodily injury; a well-grounded fear that it will be\ncarried out; and no reasonable opportunity to escape.\nThat's the general standard. So in the criminal context\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you wouldn't balance.\nSo, you know, gas these 20,000 people or we will kill\nyou?\nMR. PINCUS: It might be appropriate --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You gas the 20,000 people,\nright, and that's okay?\nMR. PINCUS: Well, some courts have said\nthat murder is a different kettle of fish and that there\nis a question unanswered in the Federal system about\nwhether or not there is a direct defense for murder.\nThe States are divided. The Model Penal Code has said\nyes, there should be. That is one of the issues that\nwould be open for the Attorney General to the extent he\nwishes to exercise his discretion to decide.\nWhat's clear, though, is, we think, the\nrule -- the current construction of the statute is not\nright. There is a body of law out there that is well\ndeveloped in the criminal context that could be a very\nlogical starting point.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why shouldn't the\nstarting point be what this Court decided in the\nFedorenko case? The wording of this provision is very\nclose to the wording of that statute, much closer than\nthe UN covenant that you have referred to.\nMR. PINCUS: Well, Your Honor, two responses\nto that. First of all, the language in Fedorenko, the\ntext was very context-specific and it shows that. The\nlanguage that applied there specifically referred to the\nenemy and specifically referred to persecution of\ncivilians, making it quite clear that that was a statute\nthat was targeted in the specific World War II context,\nwhich was all that it applied to.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It was also the distinction\nabout the use of the word \"voluntary,\" in which the\noperative language which barred those people didn't have\n\"voluntary\" in it, and I forget what it was, the next\ntextual section it was there, so it was reason to infer\nthat voluntary activity was not a criteria for the bar.\nIsn't that right?\nMR. PINCUS: Exactly, Your Honor, and the\nCourt said the deliberate omission -- it specifically\nlooked at the fact that these sections were adopted at\nthe same time, followed on each other immediately, and\none had \"voluntary,\" and then it said this was a\ndeliberate omission and we conclude that that deliberate\nomission provides the basis for interpreting the\nlanguage --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you take the position\nthat the Government is wrong in saying that it's bound\nby Fedorenko and that's the reason perhaps for us to\nsend it back?\nMR. PINCUS: Exactly, Your Honor. I was\ngoing to get to the second part of your Chevron question\nand respond just that. If the Court were to conclude,\ncontrary to our submission, that the language here is\nambiguous and there's a gap to fill, our position is --\nand we think it's quite well borne out by the decisions\n-- that the BIA's decisions here rested on the mistaken\nassumption that Fedorenko bound it in this case.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And do we begin with the\ndecision in Rodriguez-Majano, the BIA decision --\nMR. PINCUS: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- which cited Fedorenko?\nMR. PINCUS: Rodriguez-Majano was the first\none. The issue was not even raised in that case. It\nwas dicta in the paragraph before citing Fedorenko> In\nfact, the BIA says: \"The service agreed at oral\nargument that the actions don't constitute participation\nand persecution.\" So there really wasn't an issue\nthere. But all that's there is a sentence and a\nreliance on Fedorenko, seems pretty clear that that\ndecision just mistakenly believed Fedorenko controlled\nthe case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, to give the devil his\ndue, it's not just the BIA that took that view, it's\nevery court of appeals that -- that has looked at this\nprovision has said that Fedorenko is a guide to what it\nmeans, right?\nMR. PINCUS: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you are faulting the BIA\nfor -- you are saying it's beyond reasonable\ninterpretation for the BIA to adopt the -- the\nresolution of the ambiguity, assuming there is an\nambiguity, which comports with every court of appeals to\naddress the matter has said?\nMR. PINCUS: I think there are -- there are\ntwo different questions here, Justice Scalia. If the\nBIA purported to -- if the -- if the BIA said there is a\ngap to fill here, we are going to exercise our expertise\nand discretion and decide that, that would be one\nsituation. We think it's quite clear here that the BIA\nbelieved erroneously that Fedorenko compelled the\nresult, that it thought this was a Chevron step one\ncase, and it was merely reciting what it believed to be\nthe rule and saying that Fedorenko controls. So we\nthink --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why do you think that's\nclear? What's -- what's the text you rely on?\nMR. PINCUS: The text that we are relying on\nis -- is the actual decision, which just makes a flat\nstatement, again in dicta: \"The participation or\" -- I\nam reading from Rodriguez-Majano.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do I have it in front of\nme?\nMR. PINCUS: You don't. It's a decision of\nthe BIA.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, gee. I mean, if this\nis central to your case, don't you think I ought to have\nthe language in front of me somewhere?\nMR. PINCUS: Well, actually the language is\non page 27 of our yellow brief.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wonderful.\nMR. PINCUS: At the very top of the page.\nSo all that there is there is a recitation of the rule\nand a citation to Fedorenko. And our submission is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's a \"see\" citation,\nright?\nMR. PINCUS: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I mean, you know,\nit's just not a flat citation which would say that\ngoverns. It means this is a relevant case that you\nshould look to. And you don't deny that it's relevant.\nYou try to distinguish it, but it's certainly something\nyou should consider, no?\nMR. PINCUS: Well, Your Honor, it is\ncertainly --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that's all you have to\nsay that they -- they based it on Fedorenko?\nMR. PINCUS: Yes. Well, first of all, as I\nsay --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's not very much.\nMR. PINCUS: -- the statement in this\ndecision is dicta. Here I'm not sure whether they\nconsulted the Bluebook before they picked the \"see\"\ncite, but -- but it -- it seems to me that -- that all\nwe have here is a legal rule and a legal rule that\ngenerally has been perceived to be the rule that -- that\nwas announced by Fedorenko, not tied in any way to the\ndifferent statutory language at issue in this case or\nanything else.\nLet me -- let me also turn to the second\ndecision that is relied on, which is the decision in\nthis case. And there -- and I am looking at -- at page\n6a of the petition. And the BIA says, citing to -- to\nits prior decision in Matter of Fedorenko, it -- it\nrecites this rule. Now --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's a \"see\" cite again,\nisn't it?\nMR. PINCUS: It's another \"see\" cite.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: All right, that's good.\nMR. PINCUS: Which they indicate because\nthey are actually directly -- well, anyway.\nThe Matter of Fedorenko, that's a case --\nand I apologize. In our brief we said that was the case\nthat relied on the DPA. That's actually a case that\ninvolved the Holtzman Amendment, again not the statute\nat issue in this case, and therefore just sort of\nreflexively taking a rule in a different case and\napplying it to this very different statute without any\nanalysis. And not to get into too much of a train of\nBIA logic, but I think it is important.\nThe second case cited here, Matter of\nLaipenieks, which is the actually the -- the precedent\nthat Matter of Fedorenko relies on, again specifically\ncalled out the language of Fedorenko and says, as in\nFedorenko -- and I am quoting from page 464 of that\ndecision -- as in Fedorenko, the plain language mandates\nthe result.\nSo here in -- in all of the BIA analysis,\nthere is no analysis in terms of exercising expertise\nand discretion.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. Where --\nthe plain language dictates the result, where do I see\nthat?\nMR. PINCUS: I apologize. It's in a\ndifferent BIA decision. It's In the Matter of\nLaipenieks decision at page 464.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You say \"Citing Matter of\nLaipenieks\"?\nMR. PINCUS: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Citing it. It says \"citing\nMatter of Laipenieks.\" Do you know if they cited it\njust flatly or was it a \"see\" cite?\nMR. PINCUS: That I don't know, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you want to bet?\nMR. PINCUS: I'm betting on \"see.\"\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If -- if they say\nthat the plain language of the statute dictates a\nparticular result, I say -- I suspect that that's a\nconcession we are in Chevron step one, rather than two.\nMR. PINCUS: Exactly, Your Honor. And\nthat's why in -- my response to Justice Kennedy's\nquestion is that if the Court were to disagree with us\nand conclude, contrary to our submission that the\nlanguage is ambiguous, then we don't have an exercise of\nagency discretion under step one or step two, because\nall the agency decisions rest on the belief that the\nstatutory language forecloses that -- the -- the.\nExercise of that discretion.\nSo in that event we submit the appropriate\nresult would be to remand the case, but --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Pincus, can you tell\nme: What is the consequence of this? I mean if,\nindeed, your client is -- is denied asylum because --\nbecause he participated in -- in, under coercion or not,\ndiscriminatory action against others, what is the\nconsequence? He is not sent back to the -- to the\ncountry that -- that is persecuting him, is he?\nWell, his -- his deportation has been\ndeferred under the Convention Against Torture. So he\nhas some -- some protection, not the protection, not the\nfull protections that he would be entitled to if he were\nfound to be a refugee.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what happens to\nhim? Does he -- does he stay here or --\nMR. PINCUS: He gets to stay here --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Until some other country\nother than the one that will persecute him will receive\nhim, is that -- is that it?\nMR. PINCUS: Yes. Or if -- if he were to --\nhe gets to stay here as long as sending him back would\nnot involve torture. So the protection is narrower than\nthe protection that generally would be available in two\nsenses:\nFirst of all, it only applies to torture.\nIf you were sent back and you were going to be\nimprisoned for life for your -- for the acts that are\nprotected --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, really?\nMR. PINCUS: -- the CAT would not protect\nyou. And CAT also does not protect you against\nnon-state actions. So especially in the world today,\nwhere a lot of the bad things that happen in other\ncountries are by rebels and non-state actors, the\nConvention Against Torture would not provide protection\nin that situation. So it's broader protection for a\nbroader -- for a somewhat broader group of people.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Let me ask you -- let me ask\nyou about another practical consequence of your\nprovision. I -- I have seen a lot of these asylum\ncases, and usually the evidence consists almost entirely\nof the uncorroborated statement made by the person who\nis claiming asylum.\nSo in your view the immigration judges are\ngoing to have to decide the degree of the threat that\nthe asylum claimant underwent and the consequences of\nfailing to comply with whatever he was directed to do.\nAnd they are going to have to do that based solely on\nthe credibility determination made about an\nuncorroborated witness who's typically testifying\nthrough an interpreter and who has all of the mannerisms\nand aspects of speech of someone who comes from an\nentirely different culture. That's the consequences of\nthe position that you are advocating?\nMR. PINCUS: Yes, Your Honor, just -- just\nas in the initial question about whether someone has\nbeen subject to persecution in the first place, that's\n-- that is the process that we have. And immigration\njudges are quite skilled in getting to the bottom of\nwhat's going on.\nThey also have, in addition -- and as relied\non in this case --\nJUSTICE ALITO: You really think that's\ntrue? They are quite skilled at getting to the bottom\nof making --\nMR. PINCUS: Well, I think -- I think it is\ntheir job. I think they also have the country reports\nthat the State Department prepares, and they were relied\non in this case. If -- if, for example, someone were to\ncome in and say, I am a victim of coercion, and the\ncountry report does not provide any indication that that\nis happening in the country, that's obviously a reason\nto look quite skeptically --\nJUDGE SCALIA: Well, if I claim I would be\nsubject to persecution in Denmark if I were sent there,\nthat might be an easy question. But they typically come\nfrom a country where there is persecution, and they\ncould easily have been subjected to it, or they could\nalso just as easily have read about it or heard about it\nin -- along their way here.\nYou think that's an easy determination?\nMR. PINCUS: If -- but -- well, but it's\ntrue of the initial claim of persecution. But if -- if\nthe refugee, an asylum applicant, comes and says, I have\nbeen subject to persecution, and there is no issue of\ncoercion in the case, that is -- the concern that you\nhave identified arises there. If a case-specific, the\ncase-specific decision has to be made, this is an\nadditional question that will have to be answered.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Your unprovable question\nupon unprovable question. I mean, to say that one\nquestion is really, really hard to figure out is no\njustification for laying on another one.\nMR. PINCUS: And -- and we also think it's\nsignificant in this respect, that the Secretary of\nHomeland Security has in connection with a different\ndisability, the material support disability, said that,\npromulgated an exclusion for -- in some circumstances\nfor people who are coerced to provide material support.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I am quite curious why -- I\nam curious, why did you answer Justice Alito's question\n\"yes\"? I -- I would have thought that if you win this\ncase, the Attorney General would still have tremendous\nleeway in deciding where, when, under what\ncircumstances, the duress defense applied. Why isn't\nthat so?\nMR. PINCUS: That's absolutely right,\nJustice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If that's right, then why\ndo you not -- why was your answer yes?\nMR. PINCUS: My answer was in the absence of\naction by the Attorney General. But I think you are\nabsolutely right that the important thing to point out\nhere is, as with the standard itself, the Attorney\nGeneral could in the asylum context decide that in\ncertain kinds of situations that this coercion is not\nrelevant.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Pincus, refresh my\nrecollection about something about the Fedorenko case,\nwhich I should have reread, but I honestly didn't in\ndetail. Am I not correct that the point that\nJustice Alito makes was really part of the background of\nthe case there was that nobody really believed his\ntestimony? It was assumed, for purposes of decision,\nthat he was telling the truth, but it was pretty clear\nhe was not. Whereas here everybody does assume, for\npurposes of decision, that this man is telling the\ntruth?\nMR. PINCUS: Yes, I think that's -- that's\ncorrect, Justice Stevens. And part of what was going on\nthere was the sheer -- two things: The sheer\nadministrative burden of millions of refugees and the\nneed to process them in some kind of expeditious\nfashion; and the fact that it was known that there was\nsort of an organized effort by people who had been\nparticipating, especially in the concentration camps, to\ncome up with this defense.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Pincus, I didn't -- I\ndidn't get the bottom line of your exchange with\nJustice Breyer. Is it your position that there -- there\nhas to be some -- some coercion defense, but it's up to\nthe Attorney General to say what it is? I mean, he\ncould say only if he were threatened with death?\nMR. PINCUS: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And only if you were\nthreatened with torture, not if it was threatened that\nyour family would be exterminated? Where do you get\nthat discretion in the -- in the statute?\nMR. PINCUS: Well, the Attorney General has\nrulemaking authority in the asylum area, certainly. And\nwe think even in -- even with respect --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Any old coercion defense he\ncan do -- make. So long as there is some coercion\ndefense, that's all you want. Some coercion defense?\nMR. PINCUS: Well, we think the question now\nbefore the Court is, is there no coercion defense?\nThat's the -- that's the Government's position --\nflatly, totally irrelevant.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But why does the Attorney\nGeneral have expertise in -- in that area? I can\nunderstand why he has expertise when he knows that, from\nexperience, that certain defenses are harder to prove\nthan others, that certain evidence is harder to obtain\nthan other evidence. But does the Attorney General\nreally have expertise in determining degrees of duress,\ndegrees of culpability? Is that within the Chevron\nframework?\nMR. PINCUS: Well, it -- it -- it seems to\nme it could well -- I mean, obviously, that would be a\nquestion that would come up, but -- but given that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't know why you -- I\ndon't know why you concede that.\nMR. PINCUS: Well, I think once there is a\ncoercion defense, it would be fleshed out in the\nadministrative process.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You said -- you never get\npast step one of Chevron. You say that this statute is\nclear. You say it's not ambiguous.\nMR. PINCUS: Absolutely. Well, we --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think it's pretty\nambiguous if, you know, there is some old coercion\ndefense, but we don't really know what it is.\nMR. PINCUS: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me if you are\ngoing to say step one is clear, there has to be some\ncoercion defense that -- you know, of -- of a\nsubstantial nature that the Attorney General cannot\nfritter away.\nMR. PINCUS: We agree with that, Your Honor,\nand I apologize if I suggested to the contrary.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What would be -- what\nwould be the minimum. You say the statute is clear. It\nrequires some culpability, how would you verbalize what\nis the lowest standard that the Attorney General could\nimpose to read statute to infuse in it some element of\nculpability?\nMR. PINCUS: Because the statutory context\nhere was to implement our treaty obligations, and the\ntreaty obligations refers -- refer to criminal\nconduct -- we think the logical starting point that --\nthat you are asking about, Justice Ginsburg, would be\nthe criminal law standards, which, as I say, are well\ndeveloped in the Federal system.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Serious bodily harm?\nMR. PINCUS: Yes, it's a -- it's a\nthree-part test: Threat of serious bodily harm; no\nreasonable well-grounded fear that it will be carried\nout; and no reasonable way to avoid it.\nUnless the Court has any further questions,\nI'll reserve the time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nPincus.\nMr. Katsas.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. KATSAS\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. KATSAS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn categorical terms, the Immigration and\nNationality Act provides that persons who assist or\notherwise participate in persecution may not obtain\ncertain immigration benefits.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where you stopped --\nyou stopped in the part that interests me, \"participated\nin persecution on account of race, religion, nationality\nor membership in a particular group. When these people\nare forced to engage in persecution, it's not because of\nthe victim's race or religion; it's because someone's\ngot a gun at their head.\nSo, you ask them, \"Well, why did you do\nthat? Why did you, you know, whip that person? They\nwill say: Because they were going to kill me. They are\nnot going to say, I -- you know, because I was biased\nagainst his race or religion.\nMR. KATSAS: No, but the -- the \"on account\nof\" phrase, Mr. Chief Justice, modifies the\n\"persecution.\" The persecution in this case was\ndirected --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, how do you\nknow that? Why can't it just as easily modify\n\"incited,\" \"participated in\"? You have persecution.\nDid they participate in the persecution on account of\nrace; or did they participate, again, in the persecution\non account of what the -- what the force exerted against\nthem was?\nMR. KATSAS: I think grammatically, the\nimmediately preceding noun is \"persecution.\" If the \"on\naccount of\" phrase modified -- modified the assistance,\nMr. Chief Justice, it seems to me that would prove far\ntoo much, in that a prison guard who served voluntarily,\nvoluntarily in order to get a paycheck, wouldn't be\nwithin the bar because he would -- he wouldn't be\nassisting on account of --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that just\nbring you back to what \"assistance\" means. If you --\nnormal statutory canon, you have got \"ordered,\"\n\"incited,\" \"assisted.\"\nMR. KATSAS: Right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: \"Assistance\" can be\nread in the same sense as ordered or incited with terms\nof an active -- I don't know what it is --\npredisposition or desire. Or it can be read in the\nmanner you suggested, somebody who's just doing it\nfor -- for the paycheck.\nSo, if we read it in eiusdem generis terms,\nthen I think your response falls short.\nMR. KATSAS: I don't -- I don't think so,\nMr. Chief Justice, in that the question here -- the\nquestion here is the availability of a duress defense.\nOne can -- one can order persecution under duress just\nas one could assist in persecution under duress.\nImagine, for instance, the camp commandant\nat Treblinka ordering the slaughter of thousands of\ninnocent people. He could say: Well, I'm doing that\nunder duress because if I don't, if I don't order\npersecution, someone up my chain of command will kill\nme, which is precisely what's wrong with Petitioner's\ntheory here, its -- its unbounded nature.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that\nargument is at one extreme, where if this does apply as\nthe way Petitioner suggests we assume the Attorney\nGeneral can exercise his discretion and not afford\nrelief. But on the other hand, it could go to some of\nthe horrific examples that Mr. Pincus suggested; and in\nthose circumstances the Attorney General could exercise\nhis discretion to afford relief.\nMR. KATSAS: The Attorney General does not\nhave discretion with respect to withholding. And\nremember, the persecutor bar in the asylum statute is\nidentical to the persecutor bar in the withholding\nstatute.\nBut in any event, this Court said in cases\nlike Phinpathya the fact that the text goes to an\neligibility requirement is not a ground for the Court\nreading in limitations that aren't there on the theory\nthat the Attorney General can address something case by\ncase. That's because immigration is subject to the\nplenary control of Congress, and when Congress writes a\nrule and this Court converts it into a standard, it's\nshifting control over the immigration laws from Congress\nto the Executive and ultimately to the courts.\nIt seems to us that reasoning governs here.\nWith respect to your question about hard hypotheticals,\nI don't dispute that there are hard, sympathetic --\nsympathetic persecutors on Mr. Pincus' side of the case,\nbut keep in mind what is at stake here.\nPersecution is not typically a grassroots\nphenomenon. It's a -- it's a phenomenon typically\nordered by governments or rebel groups aspiring to be\ngovernments. It's typically carried out through\ncoercion. So if Petitioners are correct, not only the\nprison guard in this case who held a gun to keep people\nout in the sun until they died, not only would he have a\ncolorable defense, but so too would every single guard\nat Treblinka.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And so too would, I\ngather, the person who is threatened with harm if he\ndoesn't build the prison walls, right? He knows they\nare going to be used to persecute people and hold them\nin. I mean, if -- you know, if you push the extreme\ninterpretations they go either way.\nMR. KATSAS: But the point --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does he -- does he\npersecute people on account of race?\nMR. KATSAS: Well --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We have a prison\nhere; we are going to hold members of a particular\nracial group here, and we are going to force you to\nbuild the walls.\nMR. KATSAS: Mr. Chief Justice, you are\nabsolutely correct that there will, of course, be hard\ncases about how broadly to draw the circle. But in\nFedorenko, this Court instructed that the way to deal\nwith that problem is not by reading in a -- a\nvoluntariness exception into a statute that simply\ndoesn't contain it, but rather by --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but your position is\nthat it is unbounded. If the legislature passes a\nstatute requiring specific intent, scienter, concepts of\npersonal responsibility, we don't say this is unbounded.\nMR. KATSAS: Of course, Justice Kennedy,\nCongress could pass a statute with whatever --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm saying in the general\ncriminal law. We don't say, oh, this is unbounded.\nThis is what courts are for. This is what adjudication\nis for, is to establish and define what duress means,\nwhat scienter means, what degree of intent is culpable,\nwhat isn't. It's not unbounded.\nMR. KATSAS: That's true in the context of\ncriminal law. But think about why it's true,\nJustice Kennedy. It's true because Congress when it\npasses criminal statutes legislates against a background\nof hundreds of years of common law precedent in the\ncriminal area; and this Court has said presumptively\nCongress legislates against that common law background,\nand that is the theory for on some occasions reading\nmens rea requirements and common law defenses like\nduress into criminal statutes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why not any statute? I'm\nmean, starting where Justice Kennedy left off, you said\na hundred years. It's thousands of years. You could go\nback into the history of the human race --\nMR. KATSAS: Exactly.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- and you will discover,\nof course, that your word \"involuntary\" is never\nsomething where the action is involuntary that we praise\nor blame people. Rather, every action where we praise\nor blame people must be a voluntary action. The classic\nexample is: \"The wind blew my arm.\" Now, you are\nsaying that if this person's arm was blown by the wind,\nthat this statute prevents him having asylum in the\nUnited States or having -- you know, withholding. How\ncould one assume that involuntary actions are covered by\nthis statute -- are not covered?\nMR. KATSAS: Justice Breyer, the case --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Are covered.\nMR. KATSAS: Two points. With respect --\nwith respect to involuntary actions, this case -- this\ncase doesn't present that question.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Then once you\nsay that, then let's talk about intentional actions.\nMR. KATSAS: Okay.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And are you going to have\nintentional actions?\nMR. KATSAS: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because praise or blame\ntypically involves a voluntary action, an intentional\naction, and an action where there is a degree of\nfreedom, which is to say that the choice is not too\nskewed. And we see that in the criminal law by a\nreading into statutes that say nothing of the word\n\"intentional,\" and by the use of the duress defense.\nNow what reason do we have for thinking that\nCongress didn't mean these words here in exactly that\nway, which traces back at least to Aristotle?\nMR. KATSAS: Because the thousand-year\ntradition that you correctly identify is a criminal law\ntradition.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, but Aristotle doesn't\nsay criminal law. He says praise or blame.\nMR. KATSAS: Justice Breyer, this is a\nstatute -- this is a statute that allocates immigration\nbenefits. Immigration law is a creature of statute.\nThere is no background in common law --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's absolutely right.\nBut do you think Congress intended that this absolute\nbar should apply where the person is in no sense\nblameworthy?\nMR. KATSAS: The question -- with respect to\nintentional conduct, the conduct at issue here,\nJustice Breyer, is knowing and intentional. So there is\nno question about --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, the reasoning here, Mr.\nKatsas, it seems to me implicates exactly what\nJustice Breyer brings up. We had a colloquy earlier on\n-- on the extent of the reliance by the BIA for its\ngeneral policy on Fedorenko, and what the does a see\ncite mean and so on. But in -- in this particular case,\ngoing to page 6a or 7a from which Mr. Pincus was -- was\nearlier quoting, if you look on page 7a, the reason that\nFedorenko is thought to be appropriate here is, he --\nthat is to say, the Petitioner here -- has not\ndemonstrated his conduct is distinguishable from that of\nthe alien in that case. The conduct of the alien in\nthat case was identified as relevant by the\nvoluntary/involuntary distinction. It was so identified\nbecause of the text of the statute, voluntary was used\nin one place; it wasn't used in the place where the bar\nwas set up.\nSo that it seems to me that by the express\nreasoning in this case, this case is governed by a rule\nthat in effect says the distinction between voluntary\nand involuntary action is not a relevant distinction.\nSo I don't thin k you can get by in this\ncase without confronting just what Justice Breyer says.\nAnd I don't see how you can answer his point in this\ncase without admitting that Fedorenko in fact was -- was\nimprovidently relied upon, because it's not good\nauthority here.\nMR. KATSAS: I -- I don't know why it --\nwith respect to the BIA's reasoning, this decision is a\nstraightforward application of 20 years of BIA precedent\nconcluding -- consistent with Fedorenko that\nvoluntariness is not relevant matter.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: This is not really\nconsistency with Fedorenko. This -- in this case the\nBIA is saying that he cannot say that his conduct in\neffect is different from the conduct in Fedorenko. And\nwhat was relevant about the Fedorenko conduct was it did\nnot have to be voluntary conduct.\nSo it is bringing -- it seems to me, the\nreasoning in this case is relying upon a rule that says\nthat the voluntary/involuntary distinction is not\nsignificant.\nMR. KATSAS: Right. That was the\nconstruction -- with the construction --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Which answers\nJustice Breyer's question.\nMR. KATSAS: But the -- I may be missing\nsome of the subtlety of your point. But let me try --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I doubt it, but go ahead.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. KATSAS: Let me try it this way. The --\nthe statutory formulation that we are discussing is the\nconcept of assistance in persecution. Fedorenko in the\ncontext of the displaced person's act construes that\nprovision to make involuntariness irrelevant as a matter\nof law.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Right.\nMR. KATSAS: Many courts of appeals and the\nBIA repeatedly over the last 20 years have held that the\nreasoning that Fedorenko governs not only the displaced\nperson's act, where it is of course directly\ncontrolling, but subsequent statutes, of which there are\nno fewer than seven, using essentially the identical\nformulation of assistance in persecution: Congress\ncarries forward that formulation in a canonical way\nstatute after statute.\nIf you look to legislative history, you will\nsee that Congress repeatedly expresses an affirmative\nintent that all of these persecutor bar provisions be\nconstrued in pari materia and against that backdrop we\nhave administrative precedent.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But one thing that Congress\nhas not done and it didn't do it in this Act, is to make\nthe express voluntary/involuntary distinction textually\nthat the DPA made in Fedorenko. And it seems to me that\nthe reasoning set out in this case says this is exactly\nlike the Fedorenko situation; that implies that the same\nrule in Fedorenko should apply. If the same rule\napplies, presumably it should be on the basis of a\nstatute which is identical on the -- on the textual\nvoluntariness point to the statute in Fedorenko. This\none -- this one is not.\nMR. KATSAS: Identical or not textually\ndistinguishable, to the extent that --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you don't have the\nvoluntary/involuntary distinction here in -- or -- in\ntextual treatment that you had in -- in the DPA statute\nin Fedorenko, do you?\nMR. KATSAS: You -- well, you have the same\noperative language of assisting persecution.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You don't -- you don't\nfollow that with the section that uses the word\n\"voluntary,\" whereas the bar does not use the word\n\"voluntary,\" right?\nMR. KATSAS: Except you do. Throughout the\n-- throughout the INA are provisions that are expressly\nkeyed to voluntariness. So you have the same -- the\nsame contrast can be made with respect to the INA bars\nas Fedorenko made with respect to the DPA bar.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Can you --\nMR. KATSAS: And they --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Can you give me a couple of\nexamples of the voluntariness that creates in effect the\nsame distinction here as under the DPA?\nMR. KATSAS: Sure. Let me give you one:\nThe asylum -- the asylum statute -- the substantive\nasylum statute itself in 8 U.S.C. 1158 provides --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Was that passed as part of\nthe same legislation that created the bar section we are\ndealing with?\nMR. KATSAS: Yes and no. Let me explain.\nSection 1158, the substantive asylum law, did not have a\npersecutor bar as originally enacted by the Refugee Act\nof 1980. The persecutor bar in the substantive asylum\nstatute was added in 1996 by the IIRIRA statute, which\nin the same statute, in the same section, has a\nprovision that asylum can be terminated if the alien\nvoluntarily decides to return to his home.\nSo you have a contrast in the same section\nof the same statute. Conduct-based --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But it's -- I don't want to\nsplit hairs here, but I mean the voluntary return\nbehavior is a behavior of the alien in this country with\nrespect to, in effect, an election under existing\nfederal law; whereas, the voluntary/involuntary\ndistinction in the DPA was a distinction that referred\nto the alien's conduct overseas at the relevant time.\nMR. KATSAS: That's a fair point,\nJustice Souter, but to the extent part of the reasoning\nin Fedorenko rests on the -- and the inference from the\ncontrast, those same contrasts are present here where --\nthe point of the example --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You have convinced me there\nare contrasts, but I am not sure that they are contrasts\nthat raise the implication in a clear way as it was\nraised in the DPA. And I think that's my only\ndisagreement with you at this point.\nMR. KATSAS: Well, you have --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Katsas, can I bring you\nback to Aristotle?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. KATSAS: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Thank you. This is not a\ncriminal statute.\nMR. KATSAS: Exactly.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The government is not\nimposing punishment upon this person --\nMR. KATSAS: Exactly.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- for some malfeasance.\nRather, it's -- it's giving a grant of a great benefit\n--\nMR. KATSAS: Exactly.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- to a class of people.\nAnd your position is that it has narrowed that class,\nperhaps now more than was necessary, but that the\ngovernment thought that, rather than letting in and\ngiving asylum to the commandant of Trebenko, it would be\nbetter to have a provision that simply excludes those\nwho, under coercion or not, persecuted others. Isn't\nthat --\nMR. KATSAS: That's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Did Aristotle say anything\nabout that? Limiting --\nMR. KATSAS: I'm not sure.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Limiting the nation's\ngenerosity on the basis of a provision that may or may\nnot have anything to do with blame?\nMR. KATSAS: I don't know what Aristotle had\nto say about it, but --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But you do know that\nAristotle was not construing this Federal statute, don't\nyou?\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, speaking of --\nto get back to the language, what's wrong with saying,\nyou have a clause that says \"otherwise participated,\"\nright?\nMR. KATSAS: Right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that must mean, I\ngather, or could mean that \"assisted\" does not have as\nbroad a meeting as you suggest, because otherwise the\n\"otherwise participated\" language would be unnecessary\nand redundant.\nMR. KATSAS: I don't think so,\nMr. Chief Justice, because the statutory sequence is the\nword \"assist\" goes all the way back to the Displaced\nPersons Act in the 1977 -- when Congress changes\n\"assist\" to \"assists or otherwise participates in\" --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.\nMR. KATSAS: -- the only consequence of\nthat, if any, could be a broadening, not a narrowing.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I'm not sure\nthat's right, because if \"otherwise participated\" covers\n-- \"assisted\" does not include \"otherwise participated,\"\nand I understood your broad reading of \"assisted\" to\ncover the prison walls, and if it does, then I would say\n\"assisted\" needs to be interpreted with \"ordered\" and\n\"incited,\" and if it is, then \"otherwise participated\"\nshould be interpreted along the same lines.\nMR. KATSAS: Mr. Chief Justice, the word\n\"assist\" was construed in Fedorenko not to -- not to\ncontain an implicit voluntariness exception. Congress\nadds to that the word \"participate,\" which this Court in\nYeskey construed not to have an implicit involuntariness\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think there\nwas just a -- it was a belt-and-suspenders redundancy?\nMR. KATSAS: Either belt-and-suspenders or\nbroadening the circle in ways that are difficult to\ndescribe in the abstract. But \"participate\" -- this\nCourt has said in Reves, \"participate\" is a term of\nbreadth. So I don't -- I don't see the argument that by\nadding an additional term of breadth to the scheme\nCongress somehow narrowed what would otherwise apply.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What I may have\nmissed, what was your answer to the prison walls? The\nguy who builds the prison walls?\nMR. KATSAS: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is he or is he not\nparticipating in the persecution?\nMR. KATSAS: My answer is that the analysis\nof that question does not turn on whether or not he is\ncompelled to build the prison walls; it turns on\nfootnote 34 of Fedorenko, which says that courts will\nhave to draw difficult lines in distinguishing between\nthe kind of aid that constitutes assistance within the\nmeaning of the statute and the kind of aid that does\nnot.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's very helpful.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. KATSAS: But --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You -- can I get from you\nan answer to the question that I put to Mr. Pincus? Do\nyou -- does the Government deny even the necessity of\nknowledge that what you are doing is assisting in the\npersecution of somebody? You don't even have to know\nthat you are assisting in the persecution?\nMR. KATSAS: In this case, Justice Scalia,\nour position is that knowledge is a sufficient mens rea\nand is clearly satisfied here where Petitioner, by his\nown testimony, knew about the mistreatment.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What is your answer to the\nquestion?\nMR. KATSAS: We have taken the position,\nJustice Stevens, in other cases, that knowledge is not\nrequired.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: All right.\nMR. KATSAS: It's been rejected by a few\ncourts of appeals.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Good for them. I mean,\nthat is really an extreme position.\nMR. KATSAS: It is a broader position, but\nhappily for me, it is not the position before the Court\ntoday, particularly --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. KATSAS: -- particularly in light of\nFedorenko, Justice Scalia, which puts a gloss on\nvoluntariness, but does not address --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Voluntariness is the\npurpose the statute. What is the difference between\nintent and knowledge, in terms of the purpose of the\nstatute? Why is intent different -- lack of intent any\ndifferent from lack of knowledge? If you read this\nstatute literally?\nMR. KATSAS: The question -- I'm not sure\nthe distinction.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You say that, do you not,\nthat with a case involving lack of knowledge.\nMR. KATSAS: Or intent.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Pardon?\nMR. KATSAS: Or intent, Justice Stevens.\nThe conduct here intentional. The question is whether\nthere is duress exception to it.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: There was an intent to\npersecute or an intent to perform certain acts that\nconstitute persecution?\nMR. KATSAS: Intent to perform the acts that\nconstitute --\nJUSTICE BREYER: People use that word\n\"intent\" in the course of the human race to encompass\nthe notion of duress. I mean, that's -- that's\nsometimes done, sometimes not. They are part and parcel\nof the same thing, which is whether you can blame the\nperson for what he did.\nMR. KATSAS: They were not the same thing,\neven in the criminal --\nJUSTICE BREYER: In criminal law they were\nnot, I agree --\nMR. KATSAS: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- because that's --\nbecause we've seen the need for specificity. But the\nquestion, I think, Justice Stevens had, and certainly I\nhave, is why do you read some aspects of what it takes\nto hold a person responsible into the statute, but you\ndon't read other aspects of what it takes to hold a\nperson responsible morally into the statute?\nMR. KATSAS: We don't read -- our position\nis it's not fair to -- it's not fair to incorporate the\nfull common law background criminal concepts, including\nthat of duress. The question by Justice Breyer whether\nassistance in persecution contains an implicit duress\nlimitation seems to me very different from the question\nwhether it contains an implied knowledge limitation.\nAnd the latter question is not present here with respect\nto a prison guard who, by his own admission, knew\nexactly what was going on and deliberately implemented\ntorture by keeping people in the sun, exposed in the sun\nto the point of death.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your concession --\nstatement earlier on, that there are going to be\nsituations for judicial line-drawing --\nMR. KATSAS: Right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And it suggests to\nme that BIA's discretion isn't applicable here under\nChevron step two. Because what you are saying is this\nis not a situation where the statute never applies.\nIn a situation where you can logically\ndetermine and your answer on the knowledge question is\npertinent, you can logically draw a line between what a\nperson's doing and persecution; and yet you said the c\ncourts are going to have to draw lines. So BIA -- the\nboard might get discretion with respect to where that\nline is drawn and when, but they do not get discretion\non the question of does it ever apply. And what your\nposition is, that this never applies, whenever there is\na but-for logical intention between the action and\npersecution.\nMR. KATSAS: Mr. Chief Justice, they\ncertainly get discretion in conducting the analysis of\nwhat constitutes assistance. But Fedorenko said that\nthat -- that inquiry is independent of any question of\nduress on -- it said that the inquiry should happen\ncase-by-case, that's fine; but it gave -- the footnote\nin Fedorenko gave us two clear data points to help frame\nthe analysis.\nOne is the conduct of a woman who does\nnothing more than cut the hair of people bound for\nexecution. Court said, as a matter of law, that cannot\nconstitute assistance. The other data point is the case\nof an armed prison guard who, perimeter guard who keeps\npeople in a camp; and the Court said, of course, that\nconstitutes assistance.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you would say\nthe woman who cuts the hair does participate in the\npersecution if there is a guideline that says look, we\nare not going to execute anybody unless -- before their\nhair is cut, right?\nMR. KATSAS: I would not say that. I think\nFedorenko --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You would view that\nas a case that's not covered by the statute, even if the\nperson is not going to be executed unless the woman does\nher job?\nMR. KATSAS: I think Fedorenko -- Fedorenko\nsays that the -- the level and degree and character of\nassistance of the woman simply cutting the hair does not\nconstitute assistance. At the other continuum of\nconduct, Fedorenko says that the conduct of an armed\nprison guard does constitute assistance, even if, as in\nFedorenko, the guard served under duress.\nAnd Justice Stevens, if I could come back to\nthe facts of Fedorenko, the district court in that case\nfound that if Fedorenko did not serve at the prison\nguard -- at the prison camp, he would have been\nexecuted. That finding was not reversed either by the\nFifth Circuit or by this Court, which held that duress\nwas not relevant to the inquiry of assistance.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Katsas --\nMR. KATSAS: Petitioner --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What -- what about the\nposition that the displaced person's act was special to\nthe Holocaust? I mean, we are dealing with people who\nsaid we were just following orders, and we did not want\nto grant those people asylum.\nNow in this post-World War II effort, we are\nengaged in an enterprise where other countries in the\nworld -- and should we look to see how they are\ninterpreting this notion of duress, coercion? Are they\nconsidering it irrelevant; would just look to see if the\nperson in fact was provided some material assistance to\npersecution?\nMR. KATSAS: Justice Ginsburg, it's true\nthat the Displaced Persons Act was limited to the Nazi\nregime, and later statutes, the Refugee Act generalizes\nin the sense of eliminating the time and place\nrestrictions on the definition of refugee.\nOn the specific question of the persecutor\nbar, Congress carries forward the same language with an\naffirmative indication of intent to preserve the\nconcept.\nWith respect to your point about the Nazis\nbeing singularly horrific in human history, think of how\nthat feature plays out under Petitioner's theory. Under\nPetitioner's theory, the uniquely horrific nature of the\nNazi regime gives rise to a dramatically expanded class\nof people who can credibly raise a duress defense on\nanyone under -- anyone under Adolf Hitler in the\norganization chart of the Nazi government could credibly\nsay, if I didn't kill Jews, I would be killed myself.\nThe Executive permissibly rejected that construction of\nthings in -- in construing the persecutor bar at issue\nhere.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nKatsas.\nMr. Pincus, you have four minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. PINCUS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. PINCUS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Pincus, who has the\nburden of proof? Assume there is an exception for\ncoercion.\nMR. PINCUS: The applicant would have the\nburden of proof.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The applicant would. And\n-- and what -- how do you decide? There's not going to\nbe any evidence on the other side, I assume. The\napplicant's going to say I was coerced. And -- and the\nonly basis for rejecting is -- a sufficient basis is\njust, I -- \"I don't believe you\"?\nMR. PINCUS: Yes. Credibility\ndeterminations are made all the time. And there is some\n-- I mean here, the applicant --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What do you mean they\nwere made all the time?\nJUSTICE: But how are they made? How are\nthey made? I looked into the person's eyes and they\nlooked shifty? No, they have to -- they search around\nfor some little contradiction in the testimony. If the\n- if the IJ has a suspicion that this person's who\ntestifying through an interpreter -- what language did\nthe Petitioner here speak?\nMR. PINCUS: I'm not -- not English.\nJUSTICE ALITO: You don't know.\nMR. PINCUS: I don't know, but not English.\nThere was an interpreter at the hearing.\nJUSTICE ALITO: How many interpreters are\nthere of that language in the United States and what are\nthe quality of the interpreters?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And do they have shifty\neyes?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. PINCUS: But these are -- I mean --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do they typically\nhave views on the underlying persecution issue that is\nat issue?\nMR. PINCUS: Do the interpreters?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. I mean, it is\nnot at all unreasonable, if you have a clash between two\nethnic groups in a particular country, that the\ninterpreters are going to have views one way or the\nother. They are going to come from one of the groups of\none or the other.\nMR. PINCUS: They may, Your Honor. But that\n-- that's a problem -- we already have a system where we\nwere deciding whether someone is persecuted and all\nthese issues arise. We are already looking very\nspecifically at all the facts. The same facts -- the\nsame factual development would be relevant to the\ncoercion issue. As I said, the applicant will bear the\nburden of proof.\nAnd here, the -- as in other cases, the\ncountry reports are often relied on and are revealing as\nto whether what the situation is, what the specific\ncontext is, makes sense.\nIf I could turn to the criminal law question\nthat Justice Scalia asked. I think the criminal law\nbackground is very relevant here as well, because the\ntreaty that this statute was enacted to implement our\nobligations with respect to, right -- referred\nspecifically to crimes. The exclusion that was -- that\nis authorized by the treaty says, and I am quoting from\nan excerpt on page 11 of our reply brief: \"has\ncommitted a crime against people\" -- \"a war crime or a\ncrime against humanity.\" That therefore makes very\nrelevant this body of law that has been developed in the\ncriminal --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why is that an apt analogy?\nIf we looked at all the duress cases that have been\ndecided since the beginning, are we going to find cases\nwhere someone said -- someone claims that I was told I\nhad to kill 25 people, 100 people; I had to put people\nout in the sun until they died, because if I didn't do\nthat, I was going to be shot?\nAren't the situations entirely different?\nMR. PINCUS: I think you are combining two\nquestions, Your Honor. One -- one is should this\nlanguage be interpreted to have a coercive -- to require\nuncoerced conduct in order to label someone a\npersecutor. We think this is very relevant in deciding\nthat question, because the underlying treaty that was\nimplemented specifically referred to crimes, and crimes\ngenerally have that -- that -- crimes don't -- a\ncriminal liability doesn't apply to someone who acts if\nthey are coerced.\nWhether the precise standards that have been\ndeveloped in the federal criminal context control in all\nsituations here, I think that is something that may not\nbe clear. As I suggested, the Attorney General may have\ndiscretion to flesh out, and the board may, what is\ncoercion in this context; and there is a debate as I\nsaid before, about whether intentional murder,\nespecially the intentional murder of a group of people,\nis -- is an act for which coercion is -- a coercion\ndefense is ever available.\nBut those are issues that -- that don't take\naway from the fact that here the Government's position\nis there is coercion is totally irrelevant.\nIf I could just -- one other issue, the\nvoluntariness provisions in the statute that my\ncolleague raised in response to Justice Souter's\nquestion, those provisions were enacted subsequently.\nThe 1980 Refugee Act adopted the language\nthat's at issue here. May I finish my answer?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not actually an\nanswer but go ahead.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. PINCUS: Well, I'm sorry. May I finish\nmy --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You finish your\nsentence.\nMR. PINCUS: -- my thought. The language at\nissue here, those came later in the re-enactment of that\nlanguage in another context.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\n"
