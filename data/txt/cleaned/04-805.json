        "content": "(10:16 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst in Texaco Inc. v. Dagher and Shell Oil v. Dagher.\nMr. Nager.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GLEN D. NAGER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. NAGER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nIn this case, the Court of Appeals of the\nNinth Circuit held that a decision to unify the prices\ncharged for the two branded gasoline products sold by a\njoint venture created by Shell and Texaco could be\ndeemed a per se violation of section 1 of the Sherman\nAct.\nThe Ninth Circuit's decision is plainly\nwrong. A joint venture has to be able to and is\nentitled to create and set the prices for the products\nthat it sells.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Nager, on -- on that\npoint, I have a factual question and I figured I'd get\nit -- excuse me -- get it out on the table at the\nbeginning so you'd know what at least is bothering me.\nThe nub -- the nub of your factual argument\nis, as you just -- just stated it, there's a joint\nventure here and joint ventures price their products.\nThe factual question that I have is this. This is --\nor the preface for it is this. This is a joint venture\nthat has continued to market, in effect, the same\nproduct that the -- that the two companies marketed\nbeforehand, and it has done so, ostensibly, under the\nold brand names. Therefore, the fact that there is a\njoint venture doesn't necessarily disclose that there\nis a new product as -- as might be the case normally\nwhich you would expect the joint venture to set its own\nprice for.\nTherefore, it seems to me that if the joint\nventure is clearly going to cover pricing, the joint\nventure agreements, the documents that indicated the\njoint venture at the beginning, should have mentioned\npricing. And yet, my understanding is that they did\nnot do so, and in fact, the claim on the other side, as\nI recall the briefs, is that when the Government looked\nat the joint venture, prior to its going into effect,\nnothing was said about fixing prices -- setting prices.\nSo my question is, did the joint venture, as\nindicated by documentation, say in any -- so many words\nthat the joint venture is going to set prices for these\ntwo -- or for the -- the -- whatever it -- whatever it\nsells? And -- and number two, if -- if the answer to\nthat is no, should we regard the joint venture as\ncovering pricing?\nMR. NAGER: I believe the -- the short answer\nto your question is -- is yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: There were two questions.\nWhich?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. NAGER: The first question.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. NAGER: I think it is undeniable -- and\nMr. Minear can speak on behalf of the FTC to this. I\nthink it is undisputed that the Government understood\nthat this joint venture was a consolidation of both the\nrefining assets of the two companies, as well as the\nmarketing functions of the two companies, and that it\nwould own the gasoline and it would decide how to sell\nit and what price to sell it at. I don't --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is there a document that we\ncould look at that -- that says that?\nMR. NAGER: I don't know off the top of my\nhead, Justice Souter, whether there's a specific\ndocument that says marketing includes pricing. But I\ndon't think that anyone had any doubt that this\nincluded pricing. And indeed, the respondents, of\ncourse, in bringing their challenge, haven't framed\nthis as a challenge to the ability and right of the\njoint venture to set its prices. What they've\nchallenged is the subsequent decision that was made to\nsell the Texaco-branded Equilon gasoline and the Shell-\nbranded Equilon gasoline at the same price.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, taking that point\njust a bit further, your reply brief -- the reply brief\nfor -- for Shell says that the respondent has conceded\nthat the pricing decision to sell at the same price was\nnot made till 8 months afterwards. I'm not sure that\nthat's quite a fair statement. That isn't inconsistent\nwith its suggestion that there might have been an\nagreement even before the joint venture to have single\npricing. They just waited until 8 months to do it. So\nI'm not sure that your yellow brief correctly\ncharacterized their position. Tell me if I'm wrong.\nMR. NAGER: Well, I -- I think that that's a\n-- a fair interpretation of one possible understanding\nof their brief, Justice Kennedy. I don't think that it\nmatters for this Court in deciding this case whether\nthere was discussions by the owners of the joint\nventure earlier than the time of September of 1998\nwhether they were going to unify the prices or not.\nThe -- the important point for this Court is\nthat this was an efficiency-enhancing joint venture.\nThe Ninth Circuit didn't question that. And that in an\nefficiency-enhancing joint venture, it is entitled to\nset the prices of its product, whether it decides to do\nit 8 months after the venture is in operation or 2\nmonths before, as long as what they're doing is setting\nthe prices of the products of the venture itself.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, it would depend.\nThat's why -- really it's a question for Mr. Alioto,\nbut I want to know chapter and verse citations.\nPan Am and Grace meet before they set up\nPanagra. Of course, they talk about price. But what\ndo they say? Suppose what they say is you, Panagra,\nhave the power to set price. Normal. You, Panagra,\nhave the power to set price but never below $14 a\nticket. That wouldn't be normal. What are they trying\nto do there? They're trying to protect Grace.\nSo I think a lot would depend on what they\nsaid in the preliminary meeting, and of course, what I\nwant to know is this is a summary judgment motion\nwhere, as the other side pointed to particular\nconversations that they made which would say it's more\nlike the second than the first.\nMR. NAGER: Well, what I can say to that,\nJustice Breyer, is our opponents have repeatedly\npointed out in their briefs deposition testimony that\nthe parties refused to discuss price with each other\nbefore they had an actual memorandum of understanding\nout of concerns about the antitrust laws.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It may be, but still at some\npoint they discussed it and I would like to know what\nthey said.\nMR. NAGER: Well, I'll have to leave that for\nthe respondents to address for you.\nBut what -- what the court below pointed to\nwas conversations that took place in the spring of 1998\nabout a strategic marketing initiative. And this is\nafter the formation of Equilon, after Equilon was\noperational. And at that point, all you conceivably\nhave at that point with the owners of Equilon having\nleft the market is Equilon subject to the direction of\nits owners setting the prices for its products, and it\ncould sell them as Shell gasoline, it could sell them\nas Texaco gasoline, it could choose to sell them as\nsomething else.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then what did it mean -- I\nthink you said it in your brief -- that there -- both\nbrands were sold exclusively by Equilon after the joint\nventure created -- was created. Each venturer maintains\nits own marketing strategy. What was the marketing\nstrategy that each venturer, Shell and Texaco,\nseparately maintained?\nMR. NAGER: I'm not sure what the reference\nis, Justice Ginsburg. Once the joint venture existed,\nEquilon had its own marketing strategy, and Motiva, the\nother joint venturer, had its own marketing strategy.\nThe -- the role of the owners at that point was on a\nmembers committee, which -- as a typical board of\ndirectors where the -- each CEO of each joint venture\nhad to present a business plan and obtain approval by\nthe owners of the -- of the joint ventures for the\nupcoming year.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Were the parties\nindifferent as to how much of each brand was sold?\nTexaco didn't care if Shell got 90 percent of the\nsales? It just didn't care?\nMR. NAGER: Well, I don't think we could say\nthey didn't care because there were, as part of the\njoint venture agreement, brand management protocols to\npreserve the equality of the brands. But that was the\nonly limitation, and that's a limitation that could be\nchallenged. Don't misunderstand our position in this\ncase. That was part of the agreement to create the\njoint venture. That is subject to section 1 of the\nSherman Act, but it's challengeable on a rule of reason\ninquiry because this is an efficiency-enhancing joint\nventure.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but if they cared,\ndoesn't that show that there was still an element of\ncompetition, but the competition is suppressed if the\nprice is the same?\nMR. NAGER: Not in -- not for -- with regard\nto Equilon because why they care, Justice Kennedy, is\nthat -- that they licensed these brand names to the\njoint ventures and they maintained control of the asset\nthat they licensed, their name, because they operated\nin other markets where they weren't in competition with\nEquilon and Motiva. They did do business in other\ncountries around the world, selling branded gasoline,\nunbranded gasoline, and other petroleum products. But\nas with any licensor, they care that the -- that the\ngoodwill that they're licensing is not impaired. So\nlike any licensor, they put restrictions on the ability\nof -- of the joint ventures to disparage those names or\nto undermine those names.\nBut the decisions as to how to market and\nwhat to sell and at what price to sell was the single\nentity Equilon in the western United States, and that's\nwhy it's not covered by section 1, much less subject to\nper se analysis.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: One more question and then\n-- how was it decided how much raw gas would be\ndelivered to the venture by the two parties?\nMR. NAGER: That was a decision made by\nEquilon. Equilon would purchase petroleum on the open\nmarket. It could purchase it from Shell. It could\npurchase it from Texaco. It could purchase it from\nBritish Petroleum. And it -- the -- the petroleum\nproducts are bought on the open market in arm's length\ntransactions, sent to the refineries, and then the\nmanagers of Equilon or Motiva would make the decision\nas to which petroleum products to make out of that\ncrude.\nWhat's important to remember here is that\nSherman Act doesn't apply to any agreement. Under this\nCourt's decision in Copperweld, it applies to decisions\nbetween independent actors, that section 1 applies to\nconcerted activity, not to unilateral activity, so that\nin Copperweld, a parent could not enter into a\nconspiracy with its wholly owned subsidiary. In\nCopperweld, the Court -- the Court points out that the\nofficers of a company may enter into agreements with\neach other, but they don't enter into agreements\ncovered by section 1. They're agreements within a\nsingle entity.\nAnd what we have here is the same thing that\nthe Court was talking about in Copperweld in getting to\nits decision in Copperweld, is you have a agreement of\nShell and Texaco, which is plainly subject to section\n1, to create this joint venture and can be challenged\non a rule of reason analysis. But once they have that\nagreement, you now have the directors of a single\nentity determining what the prices of its products will\nbe, and that is not subject to further section 1\nscrutiny.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, do you acknowledge\nthat the rule of reason analysis of the -- of the\ninitial formation can include a rule of reason analysis\nof whether it -- it would violate the -- the Sherman\nAct to -- to have the new entity price both products\nthe same?\nMR. NAGER: Yes, Justice Scalia, but I don't\nthink that anyone would ever do that in a rule of\nreason section 1 analysis. What they'd look at in a\nrule of reason section 1 analysis is whether the\ncombined entity would have the sufficient market power\nto engage in supracompetitive pricing. This Court has\nrepeatedly said in section 1 cases it doesn't ask\nwhether the specific price set is a reasonable price --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, that's a surprising\nconcession to me. We -- we found a -- a joint\nmarketing company. All right? And the whole point of\nthis is to set single prices. And you're saying when\nthey -- and the venture, let's say, is approved by the\nFTC, the joint selling agency. The purpose of it is to\nset a single price to sell in France or something.\nMR. NAGER: Correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And you're saying now we're\ngoing to go look at their prices that they set and\ndecide if they're reasonable?\nMR. NAGER: Well, what I -- what I tried to\nsay, Justice Breyer -- maybe I should change my answer\nto no. What I tried to say is -- is that the facts at\nthe -- at -- that are involved in the creation of the\njoint venture -- all of them can be considered as part\nof a rule of reason analysis.\nBut what I tried to go on to say to Justice\nScalia was no one doing that rule of reason analysis\nwould care about what the specific price is. That\nisn't what they would look at. What --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You could say you -- you\njust never get beyond step one. You don't go any\nfurther if there's no market power.\nMR. NAGER: That's correct. And in this --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Maybe there is.\nMR. NAGER: In this particular case, the\nrespondents made a conscious litigation choice in the\ndistrict court to waive a rule of reason claim. And\nthis case proceeded in the court of appeals with the\nrule of reason challenge to the creation of the joint\nventure as waived. The court below didn't question\nthat at all. It accepted it. It accepted that there\nhad been a waiver of a rule of reason challenge, that\nthis efficiency-enhancing joint venture had substantial\neconomic justifications, and what it -- and the only --\nthe only rule of reason challenge that could have been\nbrought then was waived by these parties. Another\ncase. That's not this case. Another case, a rule of\nreason inquiry could be brought.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Nager, what if you had a\n-- a crazy kind of joint venture -- or maybe it\nwouldn't be so crazy -- in which it was just like this\none? The two companies said we're going to form a\njoint venture to market these products. You know,\nwe'll use one fleet of trucks and -- and we'll have one\ncomputer to determine who needs gas and so on. But\neach company -- each of the -- the principals forming\nthe venture retained the -- the power to determine the\nprice of the gasoline that is sold under their brand.\nAnd then 6 months later, the two companies get together\nand they decide to fix the price. That decision would\nbe subject either to quick look or per se analysis,\nwouldn't it?\nMR. NAGER: I think the answer to your\nquestion depends upon facts that you haven't stated.\nIf the original joint venture is a sham for a\nhorizontal arrangement --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I'm assuming there --\nthere are, indeed, efficiencies to be attained by it so\nthat it's not a sham. They just retained -- they said,\nlook, we're -- we're still using our old brands,\nostensibly, in the market and we're retaining the power\nto set the price individually with respect to the gas\nthat is sold under those brands. So no sham.\nMR. NAGER: Well, I'm not sure at that point\nthat they've entered into an agreement to share the\nrisks and loss -- of profit and loss from the assets\nthat they're putting together. I mean, this Court's\ndecision in Maricopa County says that that's the\ncritical test.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, are you -- are you\nsaying in practical terms that my hypothesis is -- is\njust a practical impossibility?\nMR. NAGER: Well, I -- I can't say that\nbecause you get to ask the questions.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, no, but -- no.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Beyond -- be candid. I\nwon't get mad.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is -- is that -- is that\nreally your -- your point that I've come up with a\nhypothetical which is just a non-real-world\nhypothetical?\nMR. NAGER: It's a big country, and there are\na lot of things that happen out there and so I can't\nassume that I want you going back to chambers thinking\nthat it can't happen. I want to answer it even if it\ncan happen --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. Assuming it can\nhappen, in -- in that case, would the subsequent\nagreement as to price be subject to per se or a quick\nlook analysis?\nMR. NAGER: I don't think so. It's like a\nlaw firm. It's like my law firm. When I join\ntogether with my partners, we may agree in our\npartnership agreement that each partner is going to\nhave some control over what their billing rate is. As\nlong as we have thrown our lot in together and as long\nas we're sharing the risks and loss of that activity --\nthat may be a stupid thing --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but there's -- there's\none part of the lot that you haven't thrown in\ntogether, and that's the pricing lot. In -- in my\nexample, your -- your law firm agreement would be each\npartner can decide exactly what he wants to charge. If\n-- if one wants to charge $10,000 an hour and another\nwants to charge $15 an hour, his choice.\nMR. NAGER: Well, again, I don't think --\nit's hard for me to see very many business persons\ngetting together and entering into such an arrangement.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I -- I agree.\nMR. NAGER: But as long as --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You said we're going to do\nit on the hypothesis that it's a big country and\nsomewhere out there somebody might do this. If -- if\ntwo oil companies did it, quick -- quick look or per se\nanalysis?\nMR. NAGER: I -- I think the answer is -- is\nthat if the -- if the -- the joint venture itself was\nan efficiency-creating joint venture that can survive\nrule of reason scrutiny, that business has the right to\nconduct itself subject to the restrictions that were\nput in the original agreement. That agreement to\nreserve the power to the parents would be subject to\nchallenge as part of a rule of reason analysis whether\nthey entered into an agreement later or not, but the\nchallenge goes to the terms upon which the venture is\ncreated, not to the operational activities of the\nventure.\nMr. Chief Justice, if I could reserve the\nremainder of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Nager.\nMr. Minear, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY P. MINEAR\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMR. MINEAR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe court of appeals erred in this case in --\nin its ruling that a alleged agreement between two\nnoncompeting owners of a joint venture respecting price\nis a per se violation of the Sherman Act.\nAnd this is not a per se violation for two\nparticular reasons. First, the venture in this case is\nnot a sham, but rather a lawful efficiency-enhancing\nintegration of economic activity. And second, the\nparties in this case do not compete with one another or\nthe joint venture in the selling of the product.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Respondents don't\nconcede that the joint venture is lawful, though.\nMR. MINEAR: As this case comes to this\nCourt, that's a necessary conclusion of the court of\nappeals determination. In the district court, the\nparties -- the respondents had argued that this was a\npatently anticompetitive joint venture, and the\ndistrict court rejected that, and it said at page 68 of\nthe Texaco petition appendix that no reasonable jury\ncould find that this joint venture is patently\nanticompetitive. And it further found that respondents\ndid not make a rule of reason challenge to the\nlegitimacy of the joint venture.\nSo as the case came to the court of appeals,\nit came to it with that ruling, and the court of\nappeals itself at pages 4a and 5a of the petition\nappendix --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, in the Citizens\nPublishing case, it wasn't a necessary predicate of the\nCourt's ruling there to find that the joint venture was\nunlawful, was it?\nMR. MINEAR: No, it wasn't, but we don't\nthink that Citizens Publishing has a direct bearing on\nthe case here. This Court's reasoning with regard to\nper se analysis and joint ventures have evolved beyond\nthe simple statement that was made in Citizens\nPublishing. Instead, the Court looks to the question\nof whether or not the agreement at issue is plainly\nanticompetitive.\nAnd as this Court's decisions in cases such\nas BMI and NCAA have recognized, the -- simply\nattaching the moniker of price fixing or price\nunification is not sufficient to answer the question,\nthe fundamental question here, which is, is there\nactually a fixing of prices between two parties that\nare in competition? That's not the case here.\nThe price unification agreement that's\nalleged in this case is -- arises out of a joint\nventure in which, by the very nature of the joint\nventure itself, the two participants no longer compete,\nand in the absence of such competition, this is much\nlike a merger. And in the same way that if the two\nparties had merged their downstream operations, they\nwould be able to choose whatever prices that they\nchose.\nLikewise, the same applies with regard to the\njoint venture, and it's particularly true that this\ncannot be subject to a per se analysis.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the two parties\nobviously don't compete within the terms of the joint\nventure, but they compete more generally.\nMR. MINEAR: That's correct. And with regard\nto --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you couldn't have\ntwo companies say we're not going to -- we're going to\nhave a joint venture on this corner, but in -- you\nknow, down the block, we're going to compete, and then\nit's all right to set prices on this corner but not\ndown the block.\nMR. MINEAR: That's correct. And so an\nagreement outside the joint venture to take -- to enter\ninto anticompetitive activity outside the joint venture\nis subject to further analysis.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But didn't we have\ncompetition even within the joint venture for a few\nmonths? Because -- correct me if I'm wrong on the\nfacts. I thought for a few months the -- the price\ndifferential was maintained. I think there was a 2\ncent price differential or something like that. And so\nlong as that was maintained, weren't they competing?\nMR. MINEAR: No, Your Honor. The -- the\ndecision, once the joint venture took effect, as to how\nthe products would be priced, was simply an allocation\nof the profits of the joint venture. There's no actual\ncompetition between Texaco and Shell. That was simply\nthe formula for determining --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Wasn't there competition in\n-- in the -- in the retail market? I mean, if I had\ntwo stations in front of me and one was selling gas 2\ncents cheaper, I'd -- I'd go to the one that was 2\ncents lower. Isn't that competition?\nMR. MINEAR: Yes, Your Honor. But in -- in\nthat regard, there's competition at the pump, but\nthere's no competition -- as between those two gas\nstations, but there's no competition between the owners\nof the joint venture here, Texaco and Shell.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Because that differential\nwas not reflected in what their agreement provided that\neach could respectively take out of the joint venture.\nMR. MINEAR: That's exactly right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's exactly right. I\nwould have thought there's no competition because there\nare not two independent decision-makers.\nMR. MINEAR: That's correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It has nothing to do with\nthe prices that end up.\nMR. MINEAR: And in fact --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Maybe you could explain to\nme how this did work. The -- the -- my understanding,\nwhich might be not correct, is we have some facilities\nthat refine gasoline and there are some people who take\nthe gasoline that is refined and they sell it to gas\nstations. Now, those facilities and those people now\nwork for one hierarchy of officials called Equilon. Is\nthat right?\nMR. MINEAR: That is all correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So somebody has\nto say what price it's being sold at. Equilon's gas.\nWho decides it?\nMR. MINEAR: Well, that's the factual dispute\nthat the court of appeals recognized in this case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. What is it?\nMR. MINEAR: Texaco and Shell take the\nposition that simply this is a decision that's made by\nthe owners of Equilon or Equilon itself --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. I imagine there are\nsome human beings in Equilon called marketers, and\nthose human beings in Equilon who work for Equilon\nwould say Equilon will sell the refined gasoline to gas\nstations at such-and-such prices. That's normally how\na company works. Is there something different about\nthis?\nMR. MINEAR: No, there isn't. And in fact,\nthat is why this cannot be analyzed under the per se\nrule. This is simply a situation in which a single\ncompany is selecting the prices of its -- of its --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is their view of it?\nMR. MINEAR: Respondents' view is that there\nwas an agreement that was entered into, an alleged\nagreement, at the time of formation of this entity, in\nwhich Texaco and Shell agreed to set the Texaco product\nand the Shell product at the same price. And the\nUnited States' response to that is that cannot be a per\nse violation of the antitrust laws. That is simply --\nthere -- because the parties are not competing with one\nanother, it doesn't make any difference whether or not\nthey've agreed to set it as the same price or different\nprices. It simply is irrelevant to the anticompetitive\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: The Texaco product being a\nproduct that comes out of refineries that previously\nbelonged to Texaco or the Texaco product being gasoline\nthat comes out of either refinery but is sold to\nstations labeled Texaco, or both? Which?\nMR. MINEAR: It is more the latter, Your\nHonor, that what happens in these cases the refineries\nrefine unbranded gasoline. They send it to\ndistribution centers, the terminals, and at that point\nadditives are added and the gasoline then is sold as\neither Texaco or Shell gasoline.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. I could see how\nthat could be a violation because it's possible that\nEquilon, if left on its own, would decide that its best\nmarketing strategy was sometimes to set a differential.\nBut now they can't do that because the two parents\nhave agreed that they can't.\nMR. MINEAR: But that is simply the choice\nthat the owners --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is that what happened?\nMR. MINEAR: That is -- would be the same as\nif the owners or the shareholders made a decision about\nhow two different products --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That would be rather like\nPan American and Grace saying that, Panagra, charge\nwhatever price you want, but above all, don't go below\n$50 because remember, we, Grace, have some ships out\nthere and we want people to take the ships.\nMR. MINEAR: Well, Your Honor, in that\nsituation there could be an antitrust violation, but it\nwould not be a per se violation. It would be a rule of\nreason violation.\nAnd as this case comes to this Court, the\nquestion is whether is there -- there was a per se\nviolation of the antitrust laws, and we cannot say that\nthis agreement, if it exists, was so plainly\nanticompetitive that it can be condemned without a\nfurther inquiry into the nature of the relationship\nhere.\nI'd like to point out also the court of\nappeals erred further by trying to limit the effects of\nits per se ruling by invoking the ancillary restraints\ndoctrine. The ancillary restraints doctrine does not\napply here. It applies to a situation that Justice\nSouter referred to earlier where if the two parties\nentered into a joint venture and then the owners of the\njoint venture agreed to some agreement outside of the\njoint venture -- for instance, to -- to set the price\nof their products outside the joint venture -- in that\nsituation, under the ancillary restraints doctrine, the\nquestion would be, is that particular agreement\nreasonably necessary for -- to fulfill the purposes of\nthe joint venture?\nBut that's not what we have here. The\nagreement here goes to the conduct of the venture\nitself, and even under a rule of reason analysis, the\ninquiry would be, first, what is the nature of the\nagreement? Does it have anticompetitive effects? And\nare those anticompetitive effects outweighed by other\nprocompetitive benefits? That is the type of analysis\nthat would be made in this case if a rule of reason\nanalysis was invoked by respondents. They have not\ndone that in this case, and the same rule -- the same\nreasoning applies with respect to the quick look\ndoctrine.\nIn both of those cases, there simply is not a\nbasis for finding a antitrust violation, and this Court\nshould reverse the finding of the -- the judgment of\nthe court of appeals and reinstate the judgment of the\ndistrict court granting summary judgment to\npetitioners.\nThis case --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Mr. Minear, you've indicated\nthat in the first 8 months, when there was differential\npricing, you said that was the way to allocate profits.\nI thought they shared the profits on some other basis.\nMR. MINEAR: If I said that, I misspoke. The\nprofits were shared based on a ratio of the\ncontributions of -- of assets that were devoted to the\njoint venture. What I meant to say, rather, was it\ncould have been more like a performance-based pricing\nmechanism, but it does -- it had no bearing on the --\nthe relative profits that either firm would make. It\nwas simply a pricing decision.\nEquilon had to price its products at some\nprice, and so initially it set it at some -- whatever\nprices they may have been. But ultimately the pricing\ndecision is -- simply does not have anticompetitive\nsignificance here.\nI would like to emphasize this case -- thank\nyou, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nMinear.\nMr. Alioto.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH M. ALIOTO\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. ALIOTO: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nJustice Souter, in answer to your question\nwhether or not they advised that they were going to fix\nthe prices when they formed the venture, the answer is\nno.\nIn answer to your question whether or not\nthey had any document advising the Government that they\nintended to fix the prices, the answer is no.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't -- I don't really --\nwho -- who would set the price if it was not -- if it\nwas not the joint venture?\nMR. ALIOTO: Shell and Texaco fixed the\nprice, if it please -- if it please Your Honor. Under\nthe brand management --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The joint venture owns the\ngasoline. Okay? And it owns the gas stations, those\nthat aren't independent stations. And somebody else is\ngoing to set the price for the gas that the joint\nventure owns? Wouldn't you need some separate\nagreement that clearly sets that forth?\nMR. ALIOTO: Yes, Your Honor, and at page 5\nof our brief, we pointed that out. There were two\nparts to it. Under the agreement -- and if you'll look\nat page 5 of our brief, we have both of the agreements.\nAnd under those agreements -- under those agreements,\nit was necessary that the -- I'm sorry. At page 7.\nUnder those agreements, if the Court will look at it,\nfirst of all, it says, the company's business shall be\nconducted by the CEO and other officers of the company,\nsubject to the direction by, and in accordance with the\npolicies, business plans, and budgets approved by Shell\nand Texaco -- they said the members -- acting by and\nthrough the members committee. That's Shell and\nTexaco. But more importantly --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's the board of directors.\nIsn't it? Isn't the members committee the board of\ndirectors of -- of the joint venture?\nMR. ALIOTO: If the board of directors are\nShell and Texaco and if they are the ones who are --\nthe next statement, Your Honor -- the -- they -- they\nmust -- the company must follow the policies,\nstrategies, and standards established by the members\ncommittee. The members committee is Shell and Texaco\nand Saudi.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's because it's a joint\nventure.\nMR. ALIOTO: A joint --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's the nature of a joint\nventure. The board of directors is composed of people\nrepresenting the various elements of the joint venture.\nMR. ALIOTO: The pricing didn't --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There's nothing subversive\nabout that.\nMR. ALIOTO: The pricing didn't have anything\nto do with -- if it please the Court, the pricing\ndidn't anything to do with the joint venture. On page\n12 --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but isn't -- isn't it\nexpectable? I mean -- and this is -- I think this is\nJustice Scalia's -- isn't it -- isn't it expectable\nthat if you don't have an agreement that clearly says\nthe two -- the two joint venturers, respectively,\nretain the right to -- to price products sold to the\nconsumer under their brand name, that in fact it is the\njoint venture that will price the products?\nMR. ALIOTO: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And therefore, it is a\ndecision of the joint venture, not of the -- the two\noriginal principals.\nMR. ALIOTO: No, Your Honor, for a couple of\nreasons.\nFirst of all, in Citizens Publishing, that\ndid not exist. This Court did not abolish the joint\nventure there. What it did was it cut out the price-\nfixing part of it only. Just as the lower court said,\nthe joint venture there does not depend upon --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Citizens -- Citizens\nPublishing did not have a joint venture that had\nadvance approval from the FTC. It had --\nMR. ALIOTO: Correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And I think that makes a\nbig difference. I mean, the FTC blessed this and said\nit was okay. They asked for certain adjustments.\nThose were made. One of them was not, that you had to\nmaintain a differential in the price between Texaco and\nShell.\nMR. ALIOTO: If it please Your Honor, there\nare many times in which this Court has said that the\nFTC does not have the authority or power to grant\nimmunity from antitrust violations. In --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the FTC, which is the\nexpert agency, said we don't think this joint venture\nis an antitrust violation. Don't we owe some respect\nto that determination, which was absent in Citizens\nPublishing?\nMR. ALIOTO: Yes, Your Honor, but I believe\nalso that you should have -- give some respect, too,\nto this Court's prior orders and this Court's prior\ndecisions.\nIn Citizens Publishing, the Court left alone the joint\nventure, and it separated out the pricing and took it\nout and cut it out.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but that's because the\njoint venture did not include -- did not include a\nmerging of the product as it did here. Here, the\ngasoline from both of them was merged into one\ngasoline, which was sold and the profit of which was\ndivided between them. In -- in Citizens Publishing,\neach of the newspapers continued to sell its own\nnewspaper and to -- and to reap whatever profit it\ncould make from its own newspaper. That's\nfundamentally different from here. There -- there\nstill is competition between the two newspapers.\nMR. ALIOTO: In all due respect, Justice\nScalia, they did not join the gasoline. The gasoline\nwas separate and apart. They -- that was very\nimportant. They maintained them separate and apart.\nThey competed separately for at least 8 months.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but Mr. Minear --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if they had\ncombined and if they had agreed in the joint venture to\nsell a new brand of gasoline, Equilon gasoline, of\ncourse, they would -- the joint venture would be free\nto set the price of that.\nMR. ALIOTO: I believe that that's probably\ncorrect, Mr. Chief Justice. However, it is not the\nkind of thing that this Court talked about in BMI and\nthe other cases.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if that's correct\n-- if -- if that's correct, what is the difference if\nthe joint venture decides that it's going -- they're\ngoing to make more money having two separate brands and\neven though it's Equilon gas, the people are going to\nthink it's different because some people have always\nbought from Texaco and others from Shell? It's not\ngoing to affect how the profits are distributed. It's\nstill going to be the same whether it's Equilon gas or\nTexaco and Shell. Why does the joint venture lose the\nauthority to set the price of its product?\nMR. ALIOTO: The reason it loses the\nauthority, Your Honor, is that there has to be some\nkind of reasonably necessary means so they -- it has to\nbe reasonably necessary that they need to price the\nproducts in order to make the joint venture work. On\npage 12, we gave you the testimony where the chief\nexecutive officer of Texaco and others specifically\nsaid that the -- that the pricing had nothing to do\nwith the cost savings or the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, that's right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that's true, but Mr.\nMinear had a response to that, it seems to me, a kind\nof blanket response, and he said that's only relevant\nunless you are dealing with pricing decisions between\ncompetitors. And the one thing, if I understood him\ncorrectly, that is clear is that under the undisputed\nportions of the joint venture agreement, the price at\nwhich the products were sold, high, low, differential,\nno differential, did not affect the distribution of\nprofits as between the two joint venturers. Therefore,\nthey were not competing with respect to the pricing,\nand therefore, the -- your -- in effect, your whole\nargument collapses because you don't have, on any\nanalysis, an agreement between two competitors.\nMR. ALIOTO: But, Justice Souter, Citizens\nPublishing -- they did exactly the same thing. They\npooled their profits under a -- under a formula that\nwas very similar to the formula here.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But they were competitors.\nThey were -- each one of them sold its own newspaper.\nAll they merged was -- was their publishing facilities.\nAnd when they agreed separately not to -- to charge\nthe same price for the newspaper, that was not part of\nthe joint venture. That was, indeed, an agreement\nbetween competitors. There were two separate\nnewspapers selling on the basis of their own\ndistribution system and so forth.\nMR. ALIOTO: And the same existed here,\nJustice Scalia. Shell and Texaco were -- operated\nbasically independently for at least 8 months, and\ncertainly before they were major competitors.\nBut look what happened here. All of the\ncosts that were -- all of the cost savings in this\nsituation -- there are -- to show how -- to show the\nanticompetitive effects of what happened, in this case,\nthe crude oil was down to its lowest since the\nDepression. The costs were being reduced under the so-\ncalled joint venture substantially. Plus, there was\nexcess supply.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Let me go back for a second.\nI'm just trying to get it clear.\nMy -- my belief -- I've always thought that\nCitizens Publishing was a case where the district court\nsaid that the formation of the joint operating venture\n-- the basic formation, which involved a stock\nacquisition -- violated section 7. And then they\ncreated a decree. And the question was -- for the\nSupreme Court was whether the district court was right\nin holding there was a section 7 violation. Now --\nnow, maybe I'm wrong on that. I'll go back and look at\nit.\nMR. ALIOTO: Yes, Justice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If so, if I'm right on it,\nthen what we're lacking from your point of view here is\na claim that this whole joint venture is unlawful. And\nI agree with you. If you make that claim, I don't\nthink the FTC can insulate it, I guess, unless there's\nsomething I don't know about, but you're not making the\nclaim anyway.\nSo here, unlike Citizens Publishing, we're --\nwe have to deal with this on the assumption that the\njoint venture is lawful.\nMR. ALIOTO: Even --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't see how to get out\nof that, but maybe you can tell me I can. But wait.\nNow, what I'm trying to get at is what\nprecisely is your claim, given the lawfulness of the\njoint venture?\nOne part I see. One part I see is that the\npeople who are setting the prices are the board of\ndirectors of a venture company who represent Shell and\nTexaco. Now, that might run up against Justice\nScalia's objection.\nBut I want to sure -- sure I have all of\nthem. That is, I want to know if there's some other\nclaim you're making here in respect to an agreement\nbetween Shell and Texaco as to Equilon's prices. And\nif so, what is it and where is the reference in the\nrecord?\nMR. ALIOTO: Taking each of the questions\nthat you asked, Justice Breyer, first, Citizens\nPublishing was section 1 and 2 and subsequently --\nJUSTICE BREYER: 7.\nMR. ALIOTO: -- section 7. Okay.\nSecond, in Citizens Publishing, the\nlawfulness of the joint venture, like here, even if you\nposit that the joint venture is lawful, it -- the\npricing must be -- must be necessary in order to\nachieve those -- those savings in order to be\njustified.\nWhen there's no connection, it's just a\nstraight, naked restraint, and even if it were -- even\nif the joint venture were lawful here, even if that\nwere so and they had all these cost savings, in the\nface of all of those lowered costs and the lowest crude\noil and the excess supply, they not only took the price\nleader and the price cutter, they brought them to the\nsame level, and then they increased the price another\n67 percent in major markets --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I concede that it\nwould have been perfectly legal for them to do that if\nthey called all of their gasoline Equilon gasoline\nbecause they owned all the gas and the profits are\ngoing to be distributed to the owner the same way\nwhether they call them Texaco or Shell. Why is it\nsuddenly different because they put different labels on\nthe -- keep different labels on the gasoline?\nMR. ALIOTO: They want to maintain, first of\nall, their independent identity just like Citizens\nPublishing. They want to maintain that. They had a\nstandstill agreement you can't merge these. They\ndidn't want to join them. They didn't want to make a\nnew product. They didn't want to do that. All they\nwanted to do was fix the price of gasoline in the\nUnited States.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That -- that might be. But\nI don't want you to forget the last part of my\nquestion, which for me was the most important, because\nI can read Citizens Publishing, but it's going to be\ntough for me to find in the record any claims that you\nmake that the two companies have agreed as to price,\nlike the Panagra example. That's why I gave it, to put\nit in your mind. So if there's anything like this that\nyou're claiming, I'd like to know, or is your total\nclaim that the activity of Shell and Texaco in setting\nthe price of Equilon is to have their representatives\non the Equilon board of directors tell Equilon what\nprice to sell? Or is there something else? I just\nneed to know. Is it just that, or is there something\nelse in this case?\nMR. ALIOTO: There is more. What the --\nOkay. What they did is when -- is when the members\ndecided that they wanted a new plan -- this is after 6\nmonths that they had been operating their joint venture\nwithout fixing the price. They then had a program that\nthey submitted that they required Equilon and Motiva to\nfollow. And this was their so-called strategic price\nplan.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Was it the board of\ndirectors that did that, or was it something else?\nMR. ALIOTO: If -- if you want to say that\nthe members committee are the board of directors,\nJustice Breyer, okay. But in fact and in truth, it is\nthe -- it is Shell and Texaco, independently without\nany conversation with the representatives of Equilon,\nwho are doing this. What differences this from -- from\nNorthern Securities and -- and any of the other cases\nin which the board of directors, so-called, were the\nformer major competitors -- what difference what form\nthey take -- and they --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I can understand your\nargument if we were doing a rule of reason analysis.\nIs that something that can properly be analyzed on\nquick look or per se?\nMR. ALIOTO: Absolutely, Your Honor, because\nfirst of all -- first of all, with regard to Citizens\nPublishing, it is per se.\nSecondly, with regard to quick look, look\nwhat you have. First you analyze the -- as we've said\n-- as you've said before in your decisions, first you\nanalyze the restraint. What is it? It's a restraint\ndirectly on price. It's not covered up any way. It's\nnot something doing something like less supply to fix\nthe price. It's directly at the price.\nThe second thing is, in doing that, is this\nrestraint necessary, not less -- not much -- essential\n-- is it necessary to -- to get the -- what you're\nsaving on the joint venture? Is it necessary to\npromote the objectives of the joint venture?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask a very naive\nquestion? Is -- this is basically the same commodity,\ngasoline. They have different attitude -- additives,\nbut basically costs the same. Facilities to produce it\nare the same. Why should they -- should there be from\n-- now that they're marketing this under one joint\nventure, why should they make a difference in the price\nof what is basically the same commodity?\nMR. ALIOTO: There are two answers to that,\nJustice Ginsburg. First of all, they are not the same\ncommodity because they said -- they were asked and they\nsaid it was different. They maintain the difference.\nThey seem to think that it's different.\nSecondly --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what difference\nphysically is there other than they have different\nadditive -- additives?\nMR. ALIOTO: That's what they say, Your\nHonor.\nSecondly, if Equilon were given the right to\ndo its own pricing, if they had given all of that right\nto them, and that they weren't the real puppeteers, as\nit were, that would -- might be a different situation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, but that -- that\nsounds like the complaint that you're making. We have\na problem, say, with -- with the newspapers or whatever\nit is. It's awfully dicey as to whether they should\nform this joint venture. It's going to eliminate a lot\nof competition.\nBut now what you're saying is, look, at the\nvery least, they should structure it in a way that the\nindependent pricing decision is made by Equilon. Don't\nstructure the pricing decision so that bit by bit, day\nby day it's made out by six people, half of whom\nrepresent Shell, half of whom represent Texaco. I can\nsee that as an argument. This is more restrictive than\nnecessary.\nMR. ALIOTO: Of course.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, you get me that far,\nand now I -- I -- but I say why isn't that a rule of\nreason because you're really fighting the structure of\nthe venture they come up with.\nMR. ALIOTO: They come -- then, if it please\nYour Honor, that after I pointed out that the restraint\nis directly on price, which should be a red flag to\nanyone, and also that I pointed out that there is no\nreasonable relationship between the pricing and the\ncost, the savings, for the joint venture, the last\nissue on that is whether there's any justification.\nAnd what justification is there? There's none.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I don't -- I don't\nunderstand, Mr. Alioto, if the profits are -- are not\ntraceable to how much of -- of the two products are\nsold, if the profits aren't divided that way, why\nshould the two lines be continued to be marketed\nindependently? There's no other analog I can think of\nin -- in the business world for that. There -- there's\nno motive to make one any cheaper than the other once\nthe profits are shared evenly, and that's the structure\nof the venture.\nMR. ALIOTO: Justice Souter -- I believe a\nnumber of answers to that, Justice Kennedy.\nFirst of all, this is so temporary. They've\ndone this for -- they have the right to get out of this\nin 5 years. They're already out of it. It doesn't\nexist anymore. They could do it mutually in 5 years.\nThey could do it by themselves after 5. They haven't\ndone it anywhere else in the world. All they're doing\nis getting together and being able to fix the price.\nSo it's so temporary. What difference does -- really\ndoes that make?\nBut, in addition, it's the profit pooling\nthat was also illegal, declared to be illegal by this\nCourt in its 7 to 1 decision in Citizens.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course --\nMR. ALIOTO: The Court didn't like that\neither.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- they're not able to fix\nthe price unless they have market dominance. I mean,\ndo you think they're just competing with each other?\nAren't there other companies selling gasoline?\nMR. ALIOTO: In all due -- in all --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And I don't think that this\n-- this joint venture would have been allowed if -- if\nthese two companies together dominated the market. Of\ncourse, it wouldn't have been allowed.\nMR. ALIOTO: In all due respect, Justice\nScalia, the -- you do not have to have market power to\nfix prices. That's not a criteria. That is certainly\nnot a predicate. Anybody can fix prices. You fix\nprices. It's illegal per se. That's the point. And\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You mean fix prices\nsuccessfully.\nMR. ALIOTO: They did it.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Fix -- fix prices and not be\nan idiot at the same time.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. ALIOTO: It wasn't silly for them to,\nfirst of all, change the differential that lasted for\nyears, and it wasn't silly for them to increase the\nprice by 70 percent as soon as they made the agreement.\nThere was nothing silly about that. Many people\nsuffered because of it.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: One of the briefs said\nthat the reason for that price hike was that there was\nan explosion in a refinery in California and outages in\nothers and that there was a market-wide price increase.\nThat was in --\nMR. ALIOTO: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. If -- if\n-- in the face of the facts that we have in the record\n-- and that's not a -- I don't know that that's a fact.\nLet them present it to a jury if they say that that's\nthe reason.\nWhen they have a situation where the crude\noil is as low as it's ever been since the Depression,\nwhen they say they've saved $850 million on their joint\nventure, and when they say there's excess capacity,\neven -- you don't need to be Adam Smith to know that\nthe prices are supposed to go down. And what happened\ninstead? They went up and they went up dramatically.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't -- you don't want\nthem to present it to a jury, as I understand it.\nMR. ALIOTO: Pardon me? Pardon me, Justice?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't want them to\npresent it to a jury. The whole reason that you're\nhere is that you want us to declare a per se violation.\nYou -- you want to put it to a jury?\nMR. ALIOTO: Per se -- per se violations are\nput to juries all the time, Justice Scalia. The\nquestion is you have to prove that that's what they\ndid.\nI agree with the Court in this way. I agree.\nI don't think it -- I don't think it should go to\ntrial. I think this Court should do as it did in\nCitizens Publishing and make it very plain to everybody\nthat you're not going to allow them to use a joint\nventure as a cover, even though it is legal --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But, Mr. Alioto --\nMR. ALIOTO: -- to go do something unlawful.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- Mr. Alioto --\nMR. ALIOTO: Yes, Justice Stevens.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- is it not correct that\nin the Citizens Publishing case the agreement itself\nwas invalid?\nMR. ALIOTO: The -- the joint venture was not\ndeclared invalid, Justice. The joint venture was\npreserved. They were allowed to continue to keep the\npresses together, to keep the trucks together, to -- to\nuse the joint venture. As the court said below and as\nthis Court said, the -- the pricing didn't depend --\ndepend -- I mean, the joint venture didn't dependent\nupon the pricing.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Why did they get into the\ndiscussion of the failing company doctrine in the case?\nMR. ALIOTO: They've used the failing company\ndoctrine, Your Honor, both in Northern Securities and\nin Citizens Publishing, and that was the -- that was\nthe reason what -- which they gave initially to join,\nand that was an issue. And Justice Harlan said, okay,\nthat was an issue. He thought that that should be\ntried.\nBut that was not pertinent to the question of\nwhether or not the pricing, if it is so divorced -- I\n-- I must bring -- bring the Court back to this\nstatement by the chief executive officer. He said that\nthe cost savings and all the synergies, the pricing had\nnothing to do with it. Nothing he said. So if it had\nnothing to do with it, then what are they doing fixing\nthe price?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, but if the Government\nand everybody agrees that the joint venture is\nperfectly lawful, I'm still not quite sure your answer\nto the Chief Justice's question. If they can fix the\nprice of a single brand, why can't they fix the price\nof -- of two brands at the same time?\nMR. ALIOTO: Let me say it in this way, Your\nHonor. I don't think that Shell and Texaco, if they\ngot together and they say, look it, we'll get rid of\nboth of our gasolines, let's just have one gasoline,\nand they fixed the price, I think that that would be\nillegal.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, of course, that's one\n--\nMR. ALIOTO: I thought what the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- that's one of the ironic\nthings about this aspect of the law. If they just made\nthe agreement by themselves without forming the joint\nventure, it would be illegal per se, but if they\nrestrain competition even more by forming a joint\nventure, then it's perfectly okay. But that's\napparently what the law provides.\nMR. ALIOTO: But -- but if the Court --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. ALIOTO: If it -- if it please the Court,\nif Equilon -- if Equilon were supposed to come up with\na new -- with a new product itself -- I mean, the --\nthe -- your cases are so clear. BMI was allowed to fix\nthe price because they came up with a product that\nnobody could do on their own, and that was one of the\nbasic reasons. And even so, the people who made the\nagreement continued to compete against the -- the so-\ncalled product of the -- of the joint venture.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't understand\nthat. I mean, now you're backing away from your\nconcession. If you have a lawful joint venture that's\nmarketing a product, the joint venture has to be able\nto set the price of the product.\nMR. ALIOTO: Only if it is necessary to\nachieve the objectives of the joint venture.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. No, if it's --\nif it's a lawful joint venture and it's selling\ngasoline -- there's no retaining of prior brands -- the\njoint venture sets the price. And if the -- and all\nthose people you said suffered when Equilon did this,\nthose same number of people would have suffered if\nthey're selling Equilon gasoline at a price determined\nby the joint venture. It seems to me a very artificial\nhook that you're trying to hang your case on, which is\nthey retained for presumably legitimate brand\ncompetition reasons their separate brands, but that was\nthe decision of the joint venture. And again, the\njoint venture has to be able to price its product\nwhether it's sold as Equilon or whether it's sold as\nTexaco or Shell under -- under the same -- same joint\nventure.\nMR. ALIOTO: Mr. Chief Justice, I believe\nthis Court has been consistently clear on this topic.\nYou cannot even think about or touch price unless you\nhave some specific, necessary connection to the joint\nventure.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Really? Suppose we walk\ninto a department store. In the department store, we\nsee three perfume counters, and there are three\nsalesmen, one behind each. Do they compete in price?\nThe answer is obvious. Of course, not. Of course --\nMR. ALIOTO: Three sales persons?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Three counters. They\nsell perfume.\nMR. ALIOTO: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Of course, they don't\ncompete. But do we know the department store has to be\nrun that way? I mean, maybe some places it isn't. We\ncan't prove it has to be run that way.\nMR. ALIOTO: Well, this would be --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Think of a -- think of a\nmall. Think of a bunch of shops. Maybe it doesn't.\nMaybe they could compete.\nThe reason that -- the law says they don't\nhave to compete is because the law thinks in general\nit's a reasonable way to run a department store without\nforcing your sales people to compete. And similarly, a\njoint venture. You can't prove they have to have the\nprice set at a central place, but the reason they set\nit at a central place, because it's a joint venture.\nAnd that's seems to me what the cases are consistent\nwith. You tell me which one is it.\nMR. ALIOTO: The danger -- the danger,\nJustice Breyer, is this. Is the Court going to say\nthat two major competitors in a major industry, that if\nthey get together from -- for some joint venture,\nwhatever it is, that they're then allowed to fix the\nprice?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, the answer is no.\nYou're right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But, Mr. Alioto, your\nargument, I think, is assuming that the facts in this\ncase are like the facts in what I think I called my --\nmy crazy joint venture hypothetical in which the two\nprincipals agreed to a joint venture, but they accept\nin a clear and unequivocal way the pricing decisions.\nAnd -- and it seems to me that the -- two\nthings have come out of this argument.\nNumber one, you don't make that assumption,\nand that assumption is -- is not supported by the facts\nof this case.\nAnd number two, Mr. Minear comes back and\nsays as long as the division of profits under the joint\nventure agreement does not depend on these pricing\ndecisions, they are not competitors, and therefore it's\nirrelevant anyway.\nDoesn't your argument run against -- crash\nagainst one or the other or both of those answers?\nMR. ALIOTO: I don't think so. The second\none made by counsel for the Government runs directly\nagainst Citizens Publishing. That was in the case,\nYour Honor. And no one has suggested that Citizens\nPublishing be reversed.\nAnd the second part is in fact they did that.\nThey did act independently for at least 8 months.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, they did not change\nthe price for at least 8 months.\nMR. ALIOTO: No. In between, they didn't --\nthey didn't change the price. They didn't get involved\nin the price. Then they came up with their program and\nthen they instructed the joint venture to make the\nprices the same.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Alioto --\nMR. ALIOTO: Not the joint venture doing\nthat.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Who -- who is it that you\nwould have had the price set by?\nMR. ALIOTO: That would be --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, it's their gas.\nOkay? They're marketing it through their stations.\nWho -- who would have set the price if -- if we said\nit's -- it's bad for Equilon to do it?\nMR. ALIOTO: If they gave them independence\nand if there were some relationship with the joint\nventure --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Gave whom independence?\nGave whom --\nMR. ALIOTO: Gave Equilon and to Motiva. If\nthey gave them independence to make their own judgment\n-- maybe Equilon would like to make Texaco a lower\nprice. Maybe it like to make it a -- a discounter.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They did give them\nindependence.\nMR. ALIOTO: No.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That is --\nMR. ALIOTO: Precisely did not.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They gave their board of\ndirectors independence. Now, the board of directors\nwas composed, as -- as boards of directors of joint\nventures are, by the parties to the joint ventures.\nMR. ALIOTO: I'm not -- I'm not sure how it\nis in other situations. All I'm saying is when you\nhave these two oil companies who are directing this and\npretending that the decisions are being independent,\nthat is not the fact in this case. And there's nothing\nwrong, Justice Souter, for two of these to read the way\nthey did because they did it in our case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Who -- have you answered my\nquestion? Who would you have wanted to set the price\nin this case?\nMR. ALIOTO: Shell and Texaco should have\ndone this. They should have said, okay, we're making\nEquilon for these -- for these cost savings. You,\nEquilon, can make the price decisions if you want to.\nOr they could say, you make the gasoline, give it to\nus, like GM and Toyota, and we will separately price it\non our own.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But I think they did say the\nformer. You -- you make the price decisions. Equilon.\nMR. ALIOTO: They did not. Justice --\nJustice Scalia, they did not.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Your -- your complaint is\nthat Equilon is in reality a joint venture of -- of the\ntwo -- the two gasoline companies.\nMR. ALIOTO: My complaint is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's your complaint.\nMR. ALIOTO: My complaint is that two\ngasoline companies controlled the price that they were\nnever able to fix before.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If that were a real rule of\nreason argument, did you waive the rule of reason here?\nMR. ALIOTO: I -- I waived the rule of reason\nargument with regard to showing market power and -- and\nimpact on the market. I chose NCAA under the footnote\n-- and under footnote 39 of NCAA. And I chose price-\nfixing per se on the basis of Citizens Publishing.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So is the answer -- in --\nin case the Court does not agree with you, can you then\nsay, I would like to resurrect rule of reason or do you\nagree with your adversary that -- that that's out of\nthe case because you forfeited it?\nMR. ALIOTO: If you do it, as was noted in\nCalifornia Medical, where you have this whole line from\nper se to the end on rule of reason, and in between on\nMisty Flats, no one is sure what they are, but we now\nknow I am getting rid of the final one, the far one.\nBut I am not -- I am not getting rid of -- and I -- and\nI do not waive the rule of reason based on the so-\ncalled quick look doctrine, as announced by this Court\non a number of occasions. And we have satisfied all of\nthose requirements. The restraint is on price\ndirectly.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The ordinary, routine rule\nof reason you have waived. Is that so?\nMR. ALIOTO: Yes, on impact of market.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nAlioto.\nMR. ALIOTO: If it please the Court, thank\nyou, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Nager, you have 2\nminutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GLEN D. NAGER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. NAGER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I\nhave three quick points.\nOne, just to bring us back to the stipulated\nfacts of this case, I'd ask the Court to check the\njoint appendix, page 78 to 79, stipulated fact number\n62. The second sentence of that stipulation says,\nafter the formation of Equilon and Motiva, the pricing\nwas consolidated so that one person at Equilon set\nprices for both the Shell and Texaco brands in any\ngiven Equilon pricing area, and one person at Motiva\nset prices for both brands in any given Motiva pricing\narea.\nThere's never been any allegation in this\ncase that Shell and Texaco set the actual prices at\nwhich this gasoline was sold at. The only claim then\nthat the owners of the joint venture said that the\nprices had to be the same between the two branded names\nin any given area.\nSecondly, with respect to the 8-month period\nthat the respondents keep pointing to, the record\nreflects testimony that, as with any consolidation of\ntwo businesses that have been separate and are coming\ntogether, it took them a few months to figure out how\nto consolidate and unify and save the $800 million a\nyear that was the purpose of this joint venture in\nconsolidating. No -- no two companies, when they\ncreate a joint venture or merge, instantaneously are\nable to operate as if they didn't previously exist. It\ntakes a while.\nAnd the third point -- and this is the point\nthat Justice Breyer has made. When this joint venture\nwas created, it eliminated competition in the United\nStates for branded gasoline between Shell and Texaco.\nThat's a stipulated fact in this case. And when it\neliminated competition between Shell and Texaco, there\nwas no further competition to effect. There was no\nfurther anticompetitive consequence that could happen\nfrom the pricing of the gasoline of that joint venture.\nIt's your three counters in the department store.\nAnd if there is no further anticompetitive\neffect that can happen, there's no quick look reason\npossible, Justice Souter, for the issue that's been\nchallenged in this case. Your hypothetical goes to the\nformation which they waived.\nThank you very much.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, just as long as you\nhave a minute --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- I take it that their\npoint was, what you sort of said there, that -- that\nthey had agreed -- sorry. Forget it.\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
