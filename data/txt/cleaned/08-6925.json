United States.\nMs. Call.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA CALL\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. CALL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nMr. Johnson's conviction for battery in the\nState of Florida can be sustained by the slightest\ncontact. Such a conviction does not qualify as a\nviolent felony under the Armed Career Criminal Act. A\nviolent felony means one that has as an element the use,\nattempted use, or threatened use of physical force\nagainst the person of another. Physical contact is not\nthe same as physical force.\nPhysical force in this context means\nsomething more than a mere quantum of physical contact,\nand it requires violent aggression that is likely to\ncause physical injury. This conclusion is guided by the\nrules of statutory construction in this Court's\nprecedents. The better-reasoned circuits have applied\nthese principles to find that physical force means\nsomething more than de minimis contact.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And that's -- you say\nthat's Federal law. Would it make a difference if,\ncontra what Florida held in the Hearns case, a State had\ntyped a battery statute as a crime of violence?\nMS. CALL: Yes, Your Honor. If the State\nstatute required that the offender admit the use of\nforce as part of the elements of his prior offense --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: No, no, no. It's exactly\nthe -- it's exactly the statute Florida has. And\nsomebody has a plea, and we don't know from the record\nwhat the conduct was. But the State, unlike Florida,\nsays, our battery statute for our State law purposes is\na crime of violence; therefore, for our State law\nenhancements the person who pleads guilty to a battery\noffense will be deemed one who has committed a crime of\nviolence, if that's the State law.\nMS. CALL: Then -- no, Your Honor, I'm\nsorry. Then the mere fact that the State found that it\nqualified under its own recidivist statute would not\nbind the Federal court. Why we say that Hearns is\nbinding is the proposition that it found the elements of\na battery offense and the -- the ACC looks to those\nelements to determine whether it is a violent felony.\nCongress didn't say that it -- the offender had to have\nconduct that involved the use of physical force, but a\nprior that had as an element the use.\nSo the fact that the State statute may\nqualify under its State recidivism wouldn't be the same\ndetermination that it didn't have as an element the use\nof force. Here --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But what -- what -- before\nwe can even get into this, I think we have to decide if\nthose words \"striking or touching\" describe one crime or\ntwo. And what we said in Chambers is that the nature of\nthe behavior that likely underlies a statutory phrase\nmatters in this respect. If you think of the seven\ndifferent things covered by one statute in James or\nChambers, two of them, failing to return from a furlough\nand failing to return from work in day release, seem to\nme quite possibly to describe one thing, not two.\nNow, how do we know that striking or\ntouching describes two things? I couldn't find any\ninstance, and we had the library looking. I couldn't\nfind any instance in Florida where those two things have\never been charged separately. And they looked at\nhundreds.\nSo -- so why do we think it's two crimes,\nrather than just one called \"striking or touching\"?\nMS. CALL: Your Honor, two reasons. First,\nthe face of the statute itself has \"or,\" so it doesn't\nrequire --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It does, too, in Chambers.\nIt's \"not returning from furlough or not returning from\nwork release.\" You know, and I'd -- I would say the\nbehavior is the same. It's not like burglary of a\ndwelling versus burglary of a boat. Those are two\nseparate things.\nMS. CALL: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Here, why do you think they\nare two separate things?\nMS. CALL: Your Honor, because Hearns, the\nFlorida State Supreme Court decision, described them as\nthree separate offenses and spelled out that this\nstatute could be violated and it said by: First,\ntouching someone intentionally and against their will;\nsecond, by striking; or third, by causing bodily harm.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. If they are separate\nthings, what is the evidence? There is a legal\nquestion. You say the touching. Spitting, is that\nenough to rise under the -- to fall within the Federal\nstatute? Suppose I agree with you on that; the answer's\nno.\nHow do I know whether touching as applied in\nFlorida as a separate matter in the mine run of cases,\ninvolves spitting or involves something that causes far\nmore serious harm? How do I know?\nMS. CALL: Your Honor, you would apply first\nthe plain language of the statute, and \"to touch\" means\nthe slightest contact, as the courts have held. At\npages 41 to 42 we spelled out the offenses of spitting,\nmaking slight contact, that justified a battery\nconviction. \"Strike\" obviously has to mean something\nelse or the legislature wouldn't have included both\ntypes of conduct within the battery provision.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This -- this statute is a\nmisdemeanor statute, isn't it?\nMS. CALL: For a first offense, yes, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah. And the only reason\nwhat happened here was elevated to a felony was that he\nhad a prior offense.\nMS. CALL: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So it's understandable that\nthe slightest touch could -- could constitute a\nmisdemeanor.\nMS. CALL: Your Honor, the problem with\nsaying that just because it's a felony, therefore it\ncan't be considered is that the statute first describes\nthe prohibited conduct and says that the conduct is in\nthe first subparagraph, the penalty is in the second.\nSo the very same conduct is necessary for either a\nfelony or a misdemeanor, and essentially no force times\ntwo is still zero.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, ACCA uses the words\n\"physical force,\" and any touching involves some\nphysical force. Now, how do we determine how much more\nthan the minimum physical force is necessary in order to\nfall within the Federal statute?\nMS. CALL: Your Honor, it is a qualitative\nline that sentencing judges would have to make, like all\nof the other difficult decisions that they're called on\nto make in the sentencing guidelines in these 3553\nfactors. We've asserted as a proposed test that it be\nconduct just like the Begay test, that it would be\nphysical force of a kind that is violent and aggressive\nand likely to cause injury.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, there -- most -- this\nstatute actually, we looked into it and it seems to be\nused, particularly the touching part, also to cover\nunwelcome physical, sexual advances. And it's not hard\nto consider such matters to have involved force of\nexactly the kind that the Federal statute is aimed at.\nAnd there was no striking, but there was in fact use of\nharmful force, touching. That was serious.\nNow, how do we know which is more normally\nthe case when this statute is used in its touching\nrespect?\nMS. CALL: Your Honor, the government has\ncited a footnote of 6,000 convictions, and there is no\nway to know of those convictions whether they were\ncharged as to touch, to strike, or to cause bodily harm.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But we don't have to know\nwhat's more normal anyway, do we?\nMS. CALL: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If -- if any conviction is\npossible under the element of the crime to touch, when\nthere is simply slight physical force, your argument\nstill stands, right?\nMS. CALL: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I would say that's\ncertainly wrong under our cases. I mean, I would have\nthought that the reason that burglary, for example, is a\nviolent crime is not because in every instance there is\na risk of physical harm, because in the mine run of\ninstances there is a risk of physical harm, and I\nthought we said that in at least three cases.\nMS. CALL: Yes, Your Honor, as to looking to\nboth the enumerated offenses and those that fall in the\notherwise. The first prong of the ACC, though, does not\ntalk about conduct and it does not refer to an ordinary\ncase. It says an offense that has as an element. And\ntherefore it is directed to looking at a particular\nFlorida State statute rather than a generic battery or\nhow battery might ordinarily --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I know, but an element --\nyou mean we should interpret \"element\" in the first part\nof this in a radically different way than we have\ninterrupted equivalent words in the second part, and we\nshould say that burglary -- in other words, assault\nor -- or -- in other words, unless in every case of\nprosecution there is going to be force actually applied\nor something like that, that it doesn't fall within one?\nI'm surprised at it. I mean, I guess it's possible.\nWhat would be the argument for doing that, which would\nbe totally different than we have handled the other one?\nMS. CALL: Your Honor, the reason why is\nthat Congress was directing in the first prong those\ncrimes that were directed against persons and would be\ndefined by their elements. In the second prong Congress\ndid list out four enumerated offenses that they thought\nwere committed, A, by career criminals, and, B, that\ncreated that substantial risk. In the first part it\ndoes not talk about risk to others. It's that\noffender's conduct and an elements-based test.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If there were a State\nstatute that made it a battery to engage in offensive\nand unwelcome sexual touching, your argument would be\nthat that would not fall within the first prong of ACCA,\nbecause there is not a -- it's not likely to cause a\nphysical injury?\nMS. CALL: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Is that right?\nMS. CALL: Yes, Your Honor. Because --\nJUSTICE ALITO: If there was a statute that\nsaid -- in the old days I'm told people used to throw\nthe contents of chamber pots out the window. If there\nwere a -- a State statute that said it is a crime to\ndump the contents of a chamber pot on somebody's head,\nyou would say that's -- that doesn't fall within the\nfirst prong of ACCA?\nMS. CALL: Yes, Your Honor, I would say that\nthat does not qualify under the first prong.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Even -- those are classic\nbatteries --\nMS. CALL: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- and the language of the\nfirst prong of ACCA really tracks the language of the\ncommon law crime of battery?\nMS. CALL: Your Honor, it does because it\ntalks about in Florida the element is the slightest\ncontact. And we were not arguing that that offender who\nspits or touches or does these other disrespectful acts\ndoesn't deserve to be charged and can't be charged with\nbattery under Florida's State law.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So -- so what about an\nassault? I guess, using a law school hypothetical, I\nmean, a statute for assault -- I guess you could assault\nsomebody by threatening to throw a marshmallow at them.\nMS. CALL: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Now, assault is out\nof the statute.\nMS. CALL: Your Honor, again, it depends on\neach particular statute and its elements.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. But I mean, on\nyour definition, as you and Justice Scalia were\nsuggesting, because it is conceivable that you could\nassault somebody by threatening to throw a marshmallow,\nthat means assault is no longer a crime of violence, and\nthat can't be right.\nMS. CALL: Well, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, of course it's right.\nYou don't have to touch somebody for an assault.\nMS. CALL: Correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You can just threaten\nsomebody.\nMS. CALL: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's not a crime of\nviolence.\nMs. Call: And that would be --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course it's right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Assault is not a crime of\nviolence; it's not a use of force.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Certainly not.\nMS. CALL: Two responses to that, Your\nHonor. The first is, looking at the underlying facts\nwould violate the categorical approach of saying we're\nnot looking at what each offender might have done in any\nparticular case, but what are the elements that he\nnecessarily admitted. And under the Florida statute it\nwould qualify as a violent felony because the Florida\nstatute defines it as an offer to do violence coupled\nwith the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What about attempted\nmurder?\nMS. CALL: Your Honor, yes, if it has as an\nelement the use of force. And that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But it didn't --\nMS. CALL: Yes, but under the ACCA, which is\none of the phrases that the government elides out of its\nanalysis, it's not simply the actual use of force, but\nan attempted or threatened use of force.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I ask you something?\nIn your definition, you appear to hinge it on the fact\nthat the force used has to cause injury of some type,\nthat. That appears to be the only definition you can\ngive. But the use of physical force means just the use\nof force, strong force, violent force, aggressive force,\nbut it doesn't mean that it necessarily has to cause\ninjury.\nWould my rearing back and slapping you? In\nthose instances slapping doesn't cause physical injury\nas that term is defined in the common law, which is an\ninjury of lasting effect. You may have some redness for\na second, but that's all. Would that qualify as a crime\nof violence?\nMS. CALL: Your Honor, some of these\nquestions will be difficult lines for the court -- a\nsentencing court to draw. We have offered the\ndefinition that violent felony, the word \"violence\"\nencompasses sort of a rough use of force that could lead\nto injury or is likely to lead to injury, not --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, but violence has a\nbroader meaning. It generally means a strong force or a\nstrong -- physical force generally has some relative\ndegree of -- of impact. I agree with you, the common\ndefinition talks that way. Why should we read something\nmore into it, like physical injury?\nMS. CALL: Your Honor, the Court wouldn't\nhave to, and part of where we drew this from is the\nCourt's language in Begay that indicated that crimes\nwithin clause (1) of ACCA are those crimes which are\nalso likely to present a serious risk of potential\ninjury to others.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Many will, but don't --\nserious use of force doesn't necessarily always.\nMS. CALL: Yes, Your Honor, and that's why\nthe qualitative line falls somewhere higher than mere\ncontact, which would simply be the standard for Florida\nbattery conviction.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose we knew -- knew\nwhat happened. It's the same statute, and it would be\npossible to have a conviction for a rude touching under\nit. But this man, instead of pleading guilty, in fact\nwent to trial, and we know that he beat somebody badly.\nIf -- if that were the case, if we knew what the facts\nwere, then would the ACCA enhancement be in order?\nThe statute covers the waterfront from a\nrude touching to beating somebody to a bloody pulp. But\nwe know, because there's been a trial, exactly what this\nperson does, and what he does would fall under the\naggressive violence, capable of doing physical injury to\nanother.\nMS. CALL: No, Your Honor. Knowing the\nadded fact of the actual conduct would not answer the\nquestion because it is based on the elements. However,\nif the prosecutor charged it as to strike, or there was\na division -- for example, at page 19 of our reply brief\nwe showed the Fifth Circuit case in Robledo. It tracked\nthe exact same Florida statute that is at issue here and\nsaid the offender did touch or strike the victim, comma,\nby striking him with a vehicle. And the Fifth Circuit\nsaid under the modified categorical approach to look at\nthe charging document and the offender's necessary\nadmission shows that was, in fact, a crime of violence.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't there a separate -- a\nseparate battery crime, aggravated battery, in -- in\nFlorida, which --\nMS. CALL: Yes, Your Honor. There are two\nother felony battery statutes, apart from this one that\ndo --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, this isn't -- this\nisn't a felony battery statute. This is a misdemeanor\nbattery statute, which has been elevated to a felony in\nthis case only because the fellow had a prior.\nMS. CALL: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But, besides the\nmisdemeanor battery statute, there are two felony\nbattery statutes in Florida, right?\nMS. CALL: There are. Two other separate --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And how -- how are they\ndefined?\nMS. CALL: Your Honor, they add the mens rea\nof whether or not the battery was intended to cause\ngreat bodily harm, permanent disfigurement, or permanent\ndisability; and the other says simply that you committed\na battery and did cause -- the higher standards. But --\nand, in addition, the misdemeanor battery includes the\nelement of causing bodily harm, and offenders can be\ncharged simply with that provision.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Misdemeanor does?\nMS. CALL: Yes. Yes, Your Honor. The\nfelony version is to cause great -- great bodily harm.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMS. CALL: And the misdemeanor is to cause\nbodily harm, which Florida law defines as low as causing\na bruise or mark like that.\nSo, if someone were charged with, in State\ncourt, a predicate that involved that kind of injury, a\nprosecutor using his or her discretion could charge\nunder causing bodily harm and -- which showed facts that\ncould support the finding of a violent felony.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- what about\nthe government's argument that your interpretation would\ndramatically limit the reach of this provision of ACCA\nbecause of the number of States that define battery in\nthe same way Florida does?\nMS. CALL: Your Honor, I think that the\ngovernment exaggerates the concerns of that because\nthere are statute that both require an admission of the\nuse of force or have that as an alternative that could\nbe prosecuted in the appropriate case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, but --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah, but it's --\nit's usually easier just to charge the lowest common\ndenominator, the battery that doesn't necessarily\nrequire violent force, and the point -- this was the\nargument that was accepted in -- in Hayes, that the\ninterpretation, say, advanced by the dissent in that\ncase, would mean that there be a vast number of States\nthat weren't covered.\nI mean, presumably, Congress meant to cover\nall the States.\nMS. CALL: Yes, Your Honor. However,\nbecause the -- in Hayes, the Court was looking at the\n\"committed by\" and whether that was the -- the necessary\npart of the prior conviction.\nHere, given the fact that the statute can be\ncharged both in Florida and many other statutes to be\nincluded, shows that those cases would -- it would only\nbe a small number of cases that are likely to be\naffected where --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you would have to\nhave other States which only have a battery statute that\nis defined as broadly as this misdemeanor battery\nstatute in Florida.\nIf they have a higher degree of battery,\njust as Florida does, which is a felony, then, if the --\nif the prosecutor wants this fellow to be convicted of a\nviolent crime, he -- he could charge him with that --\nwith that higher degree.\nMS. CALL: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Are there any States that\nhave only this simple battery statute, which is -- which\nis met by a simple touching?\nMS. CALL: According to LaFave, only Florida\nand I believe one other State has such a broad\ndefinition --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No. No. You mistook my\nquestion.\nMS. CALL: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Are there any States in\nwhich the only prosecution for battery that can be\nbrought is under a statute as broad as this one, which\nis -- is covered by even a touching?\nMS. CALL: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Don't all of the other\nStates that have a touching statute also have higher\ndegree of battery statutes?\nMS. CALL: Yes, Your Honor, according to\nLaFave, all States have aggravated battery statutes that\ninclude either the use of a deadly weapon or --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I thought the\nevidence was pretty clear that Congress was adopting the\ncommon law definition of battery here, which doesn't\nrequire that higher degree of force or violence.\nMS. CALL: Your Honor, in the legislative\nhistory, the only time that they talked about battery --\nin one House report it references battery and assault,\nsimply by those descriptions.\nEvery other time, they talked about assault\nand battery with a deadly weapon and something more than\na simple touching.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do they use battery in the\nstatute here? I am looking for it. I don't -- I don't\nsee the word \"battery\" at all.\nMS. CALL: No, Your Honor. There is no\nenumerated offenses in the first prong.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, what worries me more\nthan -- than your application to battery is the\nmethodology, because, if it's true that in Section 1,\nunlike Section 2, a single instance of where you could\ncommit the crime without using force is sufficient to\ntake it out of the statute, then, just looking through\nthis, generally, you would take out assault, probably\nhave to take out kidnapping. You would probably have to\ntake out domestic violence. You would have to take out\nextortion, certainly, explosives laws.\nI mean, the very -- laws that I would think\nCongress certainly intended to include in that first\ndefinition.\nMS. CALL: Your Honor, when they --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So that's very worrying,\nand why I don't think it's the right methodology.\nMS. CALL: Well, Your Honor, they did use\nthe word \"element,\" and an element is a constituent --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but an element could\nbe an element that is a -- the word is \"element,\" the\nuse or threatened use of physical force. Now, an\nelement, say like abduction, could be an element that\nuses physical force if in the mine run of cases it uses\nphysical force, even though one can sometimes think of\nan exception. That's how we have interpreted 2.\nSo if we interpret 1 a different way, we are going to\ntake outside the statute the very things that Congress\nwanted inside; and, if we interpret it the same way, I\nthink we would get to the right result.\nMS. CALL: Your Honor, I would have two\nresponses to that. The first is, in the second prong,\nCongress used the word \"conduct.\" And if they had meant\nconduct to be included in 1 rather than the elemental\ndefinition, that would have been a very easy definition.\nSecond, when they talked about the crimes\nintended for category 1, they gave the examples of\nsomeone with murder convictions, rape convictions, a\ngangland enforcer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Rape can be convicted\nwithout -- rape can be conducted without force.\nMS. CALL: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So now rape is\nout.\nMS. CALL: Your Honor, it depends on the\nelement of the offense.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, the element of rape\nis not force; it's lack of consent.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. Under 1 it\ndepends upon the elements, but what about 2 and\nespecially the residual provision of 2, \"any other\nconduct that presents a serious potential risk of\nphysical injury to another\"? I would think rape\nqualifies under that.\nMS. CALL: And, certainly, if the government\nbelieves --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And many of the other\ncrimes that Justice Breyer has been talking about.\nMS. CALL: Yes, Your Honor. I certainly\nagree that -- -\nJUSTICE BREYER: You do? You agree that,\nthen -- in other words, Section 2 is not about property\ncrimes that involve force, which is what Congress\nhappened to say nonstop in the legislative history,\nwhich I know isn't read by everyone. But it seemed to\nme reading that history, the first part is dealing with\nthose things that aren't property crimes. The second\npart, like arson, extortion, which they had in mind of a\ncertain kind, and whatever, the explosives-related\nthings, were things that they thought didn't -- could be\nproperty crimes that also involved harm to people.\nMS. CALL: Yes, Your Honor, and --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, you can't say yes to\nboth of us.\nMS. CALL: Well -- I agree with Your Honor\nthat the legislative history certainly indicates that 1\nand 2 had different purposes, but this Court didn't find\nBegay and Chambers on the easy test, to say simply that\nDUI is not a property crime, therefore it doesn't\nqualify. So I hesitate to offer that as a solution to\nthe Court, but keeping in mind that the government --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I dare say that the next\ntime somebody comes to argue before this Court that a\ncrime is not included within Section 2 because it's not\na property crime, I don't think that person is going to\nget one vote.\nJUSTICE BREYER: They wouldn't have to say\nthat. They would have to say that it is not a crime\nlike the three that are mentioned, which I can't\nremember -- it's arson, extortion -- and what's the\nthird? Using explosives.\nMS. CALL: It is burglary, arson, extortion,\nand --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yeah, burglary, arson,\nextortion -- all right. You would say it's not like\nthat. It's DUI; it was not like that.\nMS. CALL: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And I get --\nMS. CALL: But if the government failed to\nprove that a predicate qualified under the first prong,\nit could offer argument in evidence to the sentencing\njudge to show that it met the Begay test and was, in\nfact a serious risk of injury, that -- purposeful\nviolence, et cetera. It's simply not that battery by\ntouching qualifies.\nAnd, Your Honor, if I may reserve the\nremainder.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Would you just clarify an\nanswer that you gave. You described Florida as unique,\nbut I thought there were many States that had a\ncodification of common law battery that would include\nboth touching and more aggressive behavior. I thought\nFlorida was not alone in having that kind of statute.\nMS. CALL: There are other States, Your\nHonor, that have the common law definition, but they\nalso have alternative versions. Many of the States also\nhave alternative versions that require either the use of\nforce or the aggravated if the underlying conduct or the\nunderlying charge was that serious matter of involving\nphysical force to qualify under a violent felony.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you said they all\nhad such -- such aggravated statutes in your answer to\nme. Now you just said many of them do. Which is it?\nMS. CALL: Well, many have alternative\nversions that require admission of use of force, not\nsimply, say, touching or striking like Florida. But all\ndo have felony versions of aggravated felony.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMs. Kruger.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONDRA R. KRUGER\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. KRUGER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe primary definition of violent felony in\nthe Armed Career Criminal Act, as, Justice Alito, you\nhave noted and, Mr. Chief Justice, as you have noted,\nalmost precisely tracks the general definition of the\ncrime of battery; that is, the unlawful application of\nphysical force to the person of another.\nPetitioner's primary submission --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then why\ndidn't they say -- why didn't they just say battery, if\nthat's what they meant? It's a lot simpler and also\nclearer than to say physical force against the person.\nMS. KRUGER: I think it's certainly true,\nMr. Chief Justice, that Congress could have defined the\ncategory of predicates for the ACCA in that way by\nlisting certain offenses, which would then require the\ncourts to determine what the generic elements of those\noffenses were, as this Court did with respect to\nburglary in Taylor.\nBut Congress instead decided to list in its\nprimary definition of violent felony the common element\nthat it thought as a categorical matter indicated a\nsufficient potential for harm that the crime ought to be\nsingled out as a predicate for ACCA enhancement. And\nthat single element was the use of physical force\nagainst the person of another.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you -- you would\nhave us believe that by \"violent felony\" in this -- in\nthis statute, Congress meant the threat -- the threat?\nIt doesn't even have to be the act. You know, if you\ndon't shut up, I am going to come over and thwonk you on\nyour shoulder with my index finger. I'm going to\n(snap). This is a violent felony under this statute\nwhich gets him how many more years?\nMS. KRUGER: It creates a mandatory minimum\nof 15 years.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Fifteen years for (snap).\n(Laughter.)\nMS. KRUGER: Justice Scalia, I think that\nthere are a few responses to that question. The first\nis that a threatened use of force is normally considered\nand normally punished under the criminal law as a crime\nof assault. And for the reasons that Justice Breyer has\nnoted already in the arguments, it seems awfully\nunlikely, particularly in light of legislative history\nof this provision for those Justices who consider such\nconsiderations relevant, that Congress meant to exclude\nthe crime of assault.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that's all he's\nnecessarily been convicted of. When a verdict is\nbrought in in Florida under this misdemeanor statute,\nall you know for sure is that he threatened to go\n(snap). That's all you know for sure that he has been\nconvicted of, and you are going to give him 15 years.\nMS. KRUGER: And again, two responses: The\nfirst is as a practical matter that is not a crime.\nNormally the law of assault, in order to constitute a\ncriminal threat, there has to be more than simply the\nuse of words. There has to -- the defendant has to\nmanifest by conduct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there have been rude\ntouchings where there is no danger of physical injuries\nto the person. There have been prosecutions in Florida,\nI understand, for what would be considered a rude\ntouching as opposed to an aggressive use of force that\nwould risk physical injury.\nMS. KRUGER: That's correct. There have\nbeen a handful of cases, that are cited in Petitioner's\nbrief, in the -- in which the Florida statute has been\nused to criminalize rude touchings. We think that those\nrude touchings, as a matter of general usage in the\ncommon law and in the general definition of battery, do\nin fact have as an element the use of physical force.\nThat is a usage that has been in force in the majority\nof States for quite some time. And we think that it\ndoes no particular violence, if you will pardon the\nexpression, to the statute to interpret it to encompass\nthe full range of common law batteries, batteries as\nthey are prosecuted --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: How about pick pocketing,\nwould pick pocketing be a violent crime if it involves a\ntouching necessarily?\nMS. KRUGER: Pick pocketing actually doesn't\ninvolve a touching necessarily. Normally if you --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I guess a very good pick\npocket could get -- could get just the wallet and not\ntouch the person, I'm not sure.\nMS. KRUGER: Well, pick pocketing, normally\nas it is criminalized in most states, does not, in fact,\nrequire as an element that the prosecution prove that\nthe -- the defendant touched the victim.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, but you don't prosecute\nthem for pick pocketing. You have a clumsy pick pocket\nand you prosecute him for battery, right? And he gets\n15 years.\nMS. KRUGER: Well, the clumsy pick pocket\nwould, in fact, be in most jurisdictions a robber. And\nrobbery is precisely the kind of offense that we know\nthat Congress was intending to cover in subsection 1 of\nthe ACCA. It was one of the first ACCA predicates, and\nit remains, I think, a paradigmatic example of a crime\nthat has as an element the use of force and is,\ntherefore, covered under the plain statutory language.\nBut I think that --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel -- I'm sorry.\nPlease finish and then I will --\nMS. KRUGER: But I think that the essential\nthrust of the argument so far has been that if it's\npossible to commit battery under the common law under\nthe laws of 27 states, including Florida, under Federal\nlaw in the way that individual instances doesn't seem to\npresent a serious risk of injury, then it can't possibly\nbe a violent felony. And I think that we know from the\nway the Court has interpreted the statute to date that\nthat is simply not the case.\nThis Court addressed a very similar argument\nin Taylor --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, you see that\nyou don't have the inquiry. The issue is not whether it\ncauses serious injury or not, the issue is whether the\nnature of the force used is physical force. And, so, if\nyou look at the common definition of \"physical force\" in\nthe dictionary, which your adversaries did very well in\ntheir brief, physical force has in its ordinary meaning\nthe use of some strength, of some power, and generally\nkissing doesn't require that strength or power, touching\nsomeone on the shoulder, doesn't. All of these\nactivities are prohibited by this statute if they are\nunwanted.\nSo the question is not whether or not they\npresent the risk of physical injury, the issue is\nwhether in all applications or in a substantial number\nthey don't require the use of strength to -- in its\napplication. That's a different question.\nMS. KRUGER: Justice Sotomayor, I think that\nyou are exactly right, that the inquiry that is set out\nin subsection 1 is simply, does this crime have as an\nelement the use of physical force?\nOur submission is that every battery under\nFlorida law, under common law and under the laws of 27\nstates and the Federal Government does have an -- as an\nelement the use of physical force.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mainly because -- now we\nare getting to Judge Easterbrook's argument about the\ndime -- you know if I touch myself, I have now used\nforce.\nMS. KRUGER: Right. There is some\nsuggestion in Judge Easterbrook's opinion that that\nusage is somehow peculiar to Newtonian physics. The\nfact of the matter is, it is actually a very common\nusage in the criminal law. There are a number of\njudicial opinions, for example, that we instead of using\nthe formulation that we see in Florida's battery\nstatute, instead use the formulation use of force of the\nslightest degree.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Suppose we\ninterpret the statute, the act of the statute as\nrequiring more force than that, as requiring something\nmore than spitting. Now, suppose that sometimes, as\nthey have made a strong case, that touching is a\nseparate thing under this statute because that's what\nthe Florida Supreme Court said, and moreover, there are\nprosecutions that seem not to fit within striking. How\ndo we know whether by and large this were a touching as\nused in Florida, covers things with mostly minimal\ntouching, minimal force or enough force to get within\nthe statute?\nMS. KRUGER: Well, Justice Breyer, I think\nthat's precisely the problem with the Petitioner's\nsubmission. It creates a kind of required element under\nthe ACCA that has no clear parallels in the substantive\ncriminal law. And it would require Federal sentencing\ncourts to ask precisely the kinds of questions the law\nof battery has historically thought to avoid, just how\nmuch physical force is enough.\nThe reason why a statute like Florida has\nreached the least touching of another in anger is as\nBlackstone told us, that too is a form of violence. It\nhas so been considered for centuries.\nAnd, Justice Ginsburg, to return to your\nquestion earlier, Florida itself actually does classify\nthe crime of battery as defined under its statute as a\ncrime of violence for certain purposes. The ordinary\nunderstanding of the crime of battery --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Not for recidivism. Not\nfor recidivism purposes.\nMS. KRUGER: It --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But are you saying that\nsuppose to Florida split this statute, and some states\ndo, so one crime is a rude touching crime, and the other\nis the use of physical -- aggressive physical force that\nendangers the physical safety of another. If you have\nboth of those statutes, I take it that you would say\neither one of them would fit under ACCA as a crime that\nhas the use of physical force, because you are saying\nthe rude touching is physical force? Even if you split\noff the touching from the striking, you would say that\nthe touching falls under ACCA?\nMS. KRUGER: That's correct, Justice\nGinsburg. We think that both variants of that offense\nin your hypothetical would have as an element the use of\nphysical force.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But only as a felony.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And what Congress was\ntrying to get at the worse of the worst in ACCA, the\nArmed Career, whatever -- that they meant to get after\npeople who go around poking other people in a rude\nmanner?\nMS. KRUGER: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I\nthink, first of all, it would be a mistake to think that\nCongress defines the range of ACCA predicate with\nparticular consideration to the ways that hypothetical\ndefendants might -- might commit even quintessentially\nviolent crimes in particular cases.\nThis Court, for example, considered in\nTaylor v. United States a very similar argument, which\nwas that the statutory reference to burglary ought to be\ninterpreted in a way that would limit it to aggravated\nburglaries of a certain sort, armed burglaries or\nburglaries of occupied buildings, in order to make sure\nthat that reference to burglary better fit with\nCongress's purposes in selecting the worst of the worst.\nThis Court declined that invitation because\nit decided that Congress's unmodified views of the word\n\"burglary\" indicated that Congress meant for that word\nto take on its ordinary meaning as it was used in the\nlaws of the many states. It said that Congress would\nhave recognized that ordinary burglaries can be\ncommitted in individual instances in ways that don't\nseem particularly harmful, by unarmed defenders of\nunoccupied buildings in remote locations, but that\nCongress nevertheless made a categorical judgment that\nburglaries as a whole present sufficient potential for\nharm that they ought to be covered as ACCA predicates.\nAnd I think a similar analysis applies here.\nCongress probably wasn't focused on the least amount of\nforce that it takes to commit the crime of battery, but\nit was entitled to make a judgment that any battery, any\nunlawful use of force against another person,\ncategorically presents sufficient potential for harm\nthat --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It might have, but battery\nby touching does seem a separate category. And at that\npoint, you have to decide, is there an element there of\nforce? And I think it requires more force than just the\nsimplest touching.\nNow, on Justice Scalia's approach, the fact\nthat there is one conviction for spitting is sufficient\nto take it outside the statute. That's not my approach.\nI would say, in the mind run of cases, does there have\nto be more force than just spitting? And now I don't\nknow how it's prosecuted. So why don't I say in this\ncase, from my perspective, very well, I don't know. No\none knows. No one has told me. No one has looked into\nit. It's very hard to look into, but not impossible.\nIt's the Government's job, faced with a\n15-year statute, to do the looking. They have the\nresources. More than a defense attorney. Therefore,\nuncertain as I am, I must decide this in favor of the\ndefendant. What's the response to that?\nMS. KRUGER: Well, I think the response is,\nfirst, we think that the proper approach is one that\npays respect to the words that Congress used to define\nthe crime. In ordinary criminal law, despite what some\nintuitions seem to be, the least touching of another in\nanger is a form of violence. It is a use of physical\nforce.\nI think to the extent that, Your Honor, you\nare inclined to look to the purposes of this statute,\nwhat Congress would have thought the mind run of cases\nthat would fall under Subsection 1's use of force\nprovision would cover, I think there you look at the\nreported cases in Florida, we see that the kinds of\ncrimes that are prosecuted under the touching or\nstriking prong of that statute are, in fact, quite\nharmful. It's not at all difficult to see why Congress\nwould have been concerned about these types of crimes,\nboth because in many instances they involve conduct that\nis probably better described as touching or striking but\nit is -- nevertheless risks substantial harm to the\nvictim, like choking, like beating the victim's head\nagainst the car window, to use an example from one of\nthose cases cited in our brief.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You know, I guess it comes\ndown to whether we think that in -- in B1, Congress was\nusing technical language or Congress was using simply\nordinary language, because you are quite right that the\ndefinition of -- of battery covers even the slightest\ntouching. The use of physical force, which would\ninclude the slightest touching.\nBut in using that definition to define the\nterm \"violent felony,\" I find it hard to believe that\nCongress was using the term in a technical sense, and\nwas not using the term \"physical force,\" \"the use of\nphysical force\" to mean something more than a mere\ntouching.\nBut that's -- that's basically what we are\narguing, isn't it? Whether that -- whether that phrase\nthere, \"threatened use of physical\" -- \"use or\nthreatened use of physical force,\" is technical language\nwhich is the definition of battery, or rather more\ncommon usage.\nYou -- you would acknowledge that, that in\nmore common usage, no one -- no one would think that if\nyou go over to somebody and point your finger at him on\nhis lapel and say, \"Now, you listen to me,\" that that\nwould be considered the use or threatened use of\nphysical force?\nMS. KRUGER: I think it probably is not the\nway that we ordinarily talk in day-to-day conversation,\nbut it certainly is the way that the law has talked\nabout it for centuries, and I think there is a reason\nthat Congress had in mind the technical definition of\nbattery rather than ordinary parlance, if for no other\nreason because it tracked so closely the general\ndefinition, that technical definition of \"battery,\" when\nit defines \"violent felony\" in Subsection 1. And also\nbecause now that the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask -- may I ask\nthis, following up on Justice Scalia's point? Are there\nany other crimes other than battery that -- that create\nthe same situation where in the first time it is\ncommitted it's a misdemeanor, but then it becomes a\nfelony because it's committed twice? So what we have\nhere is conduct that first time is misdemeanor, second\ntime is a felony. Are there any other examples of\ncrimes that fit that category that come within\nSubparagraph 1?\nMS. KRUGER: I am not sure of the answer to\nthat, Justice Stevens. I do think that one reason why\nthe misdemeanor versus felony distinction is somewhat\nunimportant to the interpretation of the \"use of\nphysical force\" language in this case is that if the\nsame language was deployed first in the \"crime of\nviolence\" definition of 18 U.S.C. 16, which by its\nterms, applies to both misdemeanors and felonies, and\nCongress has of course subsequently used that very same\nlanguage to define a class of misdemeanor crimes of\ndomestic violence in Section 922(g)(9), we think to the\nextent that this Court is inclined to interpret the\nextent of the similar language in the similar statutes\nin a similar manner, the use of physical force language\nshould remain consistent across them.\nOne of the principal vices of Petitioner's\narguments is also that it would leave the Federal\ndomestic violence provisions like Section 922(g)(9) with\nrelatively patchwork and haphazard application, which is\nprecisely one of the considerations that motivated this\nCourt's decision just last term in the United States v.\nHayes. Whether the Court --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there are no\nprovisions that would include domestic violence and the\ngun possession provision.\nMS. KRUGER: There are -- the range of\npredicate offenses that can be used for the Section\n922(g)(9) domestic gun violence prohibition, ordinarily,\nas this Court recognized in Hayes, encompasses the\ngeneral assault and battery statutes of the United\nStates. Twenty-seven of these states define battery in\nmore or less the way that Florida does, to include a\nrange of uses of physical force from the least degree of\nphysical force to very severe beatings, so under\nPetitioner's reading, it would be impossible to say for\nsure in more than half of the country that a domestic\nviolence conviction, even a battery conviction that is\nspecifically denominated as a domestic violence battery\nconviction in many a state, would qualify under Section\n922(g)(9).\nIt seems unlikely that Congress, in enacting\nthat statute, which was designed to create a nationwide\nsolution to the nationwide problem of the combination of\nguns and domestic strife, would have intended for that\nstatute to have such a haphazard impact. And yet that\nis precisely what the effect of Petitioner's reading\nwould be.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where is the provision?\n922(g)(9), is that in your brief somewhere?\nMS. KRUGER: It is. It's in the statutory\nappendix to the gray brief.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I am looking for it. I\ndon't see it. 922(g)(9).\nMS. KRUGER: The --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I hate people talking about\nstatutes that I don't have in front of me.\nMS. KRUGER: It's on page 3(a) of the\nstatutory appendix.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: 3(a).\nMS. KRUGER: It contains Section\n921(a)(33)(a), which provides the definition of\n\"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you said 922.\nThat's what I thought you said.\nMS. KRUGER: That's correct. The\nsubstantive prohibition is in Section 922(g)(9), and the\ndefinitional provision is reprinted on page 3(a).\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's really a question for\nPetitioner's counsel, and I didn't have time to ask as\nyour white light goes on. I take it your position is\nthat if you do not prevail on your argument, that this\nis under Roman -- small Roman 1, that if -- you have to\nremand for small Roman 2?\nMS. KRUGER: That's correct.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is there an argument that\nyou anticipate objecting to that remand? Or is this\nabsolutely clear-cut that we must remand?\nMS. KRUGER: I think it's within the Court's\ndiscretion to decide how to dispose properly of the\ncase. I think that the Section -- the Subsection 2\nissue was preserved in the courts below. The district\ncourt rested its decision on both Subsections 1 and 2,\nand the court of appeals addressed only Subsection 1.\nWe think that if the Court decides that the\ncourt of appeals is wrong in its interpretation of\nSubsection 1, then the appropriate thing in order to\ndetermine what Petitioner's correct sentencing should be\nwould be to remand to allow the court of appeals to\naddress the alternative argument about Subsection 2.\nBut the reason why the Subsection 1 inquiry is so --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How -- I'm sorry.\nBefore you go on, your adversary claims you waived by\nnot raising this as an -- as an alternative in the sorts\nstage. Could you fold that into your continuation of\nthis answer?\nMS. KRUGER: Certainly. I think that rule\n15.2 of the rules of this Court requires us in a brief\nin opposition to raise any material matters that relate\nto the question presented.\nThe question presented in this case concerns\njust the basis for the court of appeals decision in this\ncase which was subsection (1) of the statute. We think\nit's not at all unusual for this Court to decide that a\ncourt of appeals judgment is in error and then remand to\nallow the court of appeals to address --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Hear what they said, what\nthe Eleventh Circuit said, it said that if battery under\nFlorida law fits within the description of (1), then it\nis a violent crime for ACCA purposes. And then it says\nif not, then not. And as long as the issue was in front\nof them I would think that those last four words are a\nholding.\nMS. KRUGER: I think it's difficult to read\nthose four words in that manner, Justice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why?\nMS. KRUGER: If for no reason because the\ncourt of appeals didn't so much as acknowledge the\nexistence --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Was it argued?\nMS. KRUGER: It was argued. It was -- it\nwas briefed in the court of appeals, and the court of\nappeals --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It is pretty hard to see it\ngiven Begay, how this is like arson or, you know, the\nother three there, burglary, arson --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Explosives.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- explosives.\nMS. KRUGER: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, I mean, I don't know.\nMaybe the court of appeals felt -- what they said was,\n\"if not, then not.\" And it was raised in argument.\nMS. KRUGER: Well, I think it's -- again,\nit's difficult to read that piece of loose language in\nthe Court's opinion as a direct holding, particularly\nconsidering that the court of appeals didn't so much as\ncite the language or even the code provision that\nrelates to the argument. But I think to the extent that\nthe Court questions whether it would qualify under\nsubsection (2), I think the answer is yes. Battery\nis -- qualifies under this Court's interpretations of\nthat subsection in Chambers and Begay and James. It is\na crime that is typically purposeful, violent and\naggressive.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yeah, but I -- I thought --\nyou know, it's -- it's like the other four listed out.\nMS. KRUGER: Well, it is like them in that\nit poses risks that are similar in --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But then we are rereading\nthese three other examples out because then \"other\"\ncovers any crime that poses a risk of violence, or\nwhatever the words are there -- I forget the words.\nPoses a risk.\nMS. KRUGER: No, I think it would still be\nconsistent with this Court's analysis of subsection (2)\nin Begay in that battery by touching, if you consider it\nto be a separate crime, which again I think is a highly\ncontested --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And you think drunk driving\ndoesn't present a serious potential risk of physical\ninjury?\nMS. KRUGER: No, but what this Court said in\nBegay was that it doesn't present risks that are similar\nin degree and kind to the risks that are presented by\nthe enumerated offenses. And battery, including battery\nby touching or striking under Florida law, presents\nrisks that are quite similar in degree and kind to the\nenumerated offenses, particularly burglary. It is --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Wait, I don't follow\nthat at all. I mean, I understand your argument that\nphysical force means the slightest touching, but I don't\nunderstand the argument that the slightest touching\npresents a serious risk of potential physical injury.\nMS. KRUGER: Well, I think -- first of all,\nto clear up a misconception, simply because the\nstatutory text covers the slightest touching doesn't\nmean that it covers only the slightest touching. It\ncovers a wide range of degrees of physical force\nbeginning with the slightest touching and including --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah, but your\nargument is to try -- is asserting that the slightest\nphysical touching is covered by the statute.\nMS. KRUGER: Right. And the question before\nthe Court in this case concerns only that question. It\nconcerns the proper interpretation of subsection (1).\nWhether the crime is one that has as an element the use\nof physical force.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The district court thought\nthat the two were related. The district court, if it\nthought a slightest touching was qualified under (1) it\nwas not unreasonable to say that it would also qualify\nunder (2). But if that argue ment is rejected under\n(1), it seems to me it would follow necessarily that it\nwould also be rejected under (2).\nMS. KRUGER: I'm not entirely sure why that\nwould be true. But I do think that it's right as a\ndescriptive matter that most of the crimes that are\nencompassed by subsection (1) would also qualify under\nsubsection (2).\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But (2) -- (2) looks to the\nconduct, it doesn't look to the element of the crime.\nSo you could actually look to the conduct of which the\nperson was convicted, no?\nMS. KRUGER: Well, you have to look at the\ncontact that the person was convicted of with respect to\nthe elements of the crime, that is the nature of the\ncategory --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, no, no. You look to\nthe crime -- under (1), you look to the crime he was\nconvicted of, and if -- if -- if none of its elements\nrequire serious physical force, you can say it doesn't\nqualify under (1), but under (2) if in fact you see the\nmisdemeanor he was convicted of was really whacking\nsomebody really hard, then -- then it could possibly\ncome within -- come under (2).\nMS. KRUGER: With respect, Justice Scalia, I\nthink that is incorrect. This Court has made clear that\nsubsection (2) like subsection (1) proceeds by looking\nat the elements of the offense --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Just at the elements.\nMS. KRUGER: Just at the elements of the\noffense of which the defendant was convicted.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can I ask you about --\nabout 922? You point to the -- the definition there,\nthe definition in 921. But that is a definition of the\nterm, misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. And in\nthe context of defining that term, I'm perfectly willing\nto believe that the use or attempted use of physical\nforce means even the slightest touching, as -- as\nbattery does. You are talking about a misdemeanor crime\nof domestic violence.\nBut what we have before us here is a term --\na different term that is being defined and that term is\nviolent felony. And I find it a lot harder to swallow\nthat -- that that definition embraces merely the\nslightest touching.\nMS. KRUGER: Well, Justice Scalia, I would\ncertainly be inclined to agree with you but it's\nparticularly clear given the text and context of the\npurposes of section 922(g)(9) that battery ought to be\ncovered by that definition, misdemeanor crime of\ndomestic violence. But we think that the reason why it\nis also clear under subsection (1) of the ACCA is that\nthe use of force element of the definitional provision\nis separate from the degree of seriousness with which\nthe State chooses to treat the crime, yet the crime is\npunished as a felony, and if has as an element the use\nof physical force, then it qualifies as a violent felony\nunder the ACCA, just as if it is punished as a\nmisdemeanor, it qualifies as a misdemeanor crime of\ndomestic violence under section 922(g)(9).\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I dare say that Congress in\nmy view probably didn't even contemplate that something\nwhich is a misdemeanor could become a violent felony if\nyou did it the second time.\nMS. KRUGER: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Have we ever approved that,\nby the way, kicking it up to the felony category simply\nbecause of recidivism?\nMS. KRUGER: Well, the Court in United\nStates v. Rodriguez in analyzing the coordinate\nprovision of the ACCA that covers serious drug offenses\nsaid that the felony aspect of that definition is\nsatisfied by a recidivist enhancement. And we think\nthat the conclusion in that case, and it is not disputed\namong the parties, applies with equal force in this case\nto the proper interpretation of violent felony.\nBut it was certainly true by the time that\nCongress enacted the ACCA, which the legislative history\nindicates Congress understood would cover assault\ncrimes, for example, that there were certain kinds of\nbatteries and assaults that, although otherwise may be\npunished as simple batteries and assaults, as\nmisdemeanors, could be elevated to a felony if for\nexample they were committed against a law enforcement\nofficer.\nIt simply was not unheard of for simple\nbattery to be elevated to a felony under certain\ncircumstances in 1986 Congress enacted the present\nversion of ACCA. At the end of the day, we think that\nCongress -- every indication that we have in both the\ntext, the context, the purpose of the statute and its\nbackground suggests that Congress was in fact\ndeliberately tracking the definition of battery when it\nenacted the primary definition of violent felony in\nsubsection (1).\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, every\nindication except for the fact that they didn't use the\nword battery.\nMS. KRUGER: Aside from the fact that they\ndidn't use the word battery. Instead they chose to\nincorporate the general definition of the crime of\nbattery; that is correct, Mr. Chief Justice.\nWe think that to the extent that the Court\nis inclined to restrict the terms of -- that Congress\nchose to use itself to physical force as only exceeding\na certain threshold, to include some batteries and not\nother batteries, the Court would be setting up a very\ndifficult test for Federal sentencing courts to apply in\nthe real world. Essentially --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: States do it all the time\nwhen they have different degrees of battery.\nMisdemeanor -- felony battery -- they do it all the\ntime.\nMS. KRUGER: Well, as the Chief Justice has\nnoted, States don't have quite the same compulsion to\nsort different factual offenses into different boxes.\nProsecutors, as the prosecutor did in this case, can use\neither of the two alternative prongs of Florida's\nbattery definition to punish what is essentially the\nsame offense, which is the crime of battery, that\ndeserves the same punishment regardless of which prong\nthe prosecutor proceeds under, whether the bodily injury\nprong or the touching or striking prong.\nAnd Petitioner's concession that at least\nFederal sentencing courts could draw distinctions\nbetween touches and strikes, may have some resonance in\nthe State of Florida, but has resonance for the rest of\nthe country. Most State assault and battery statutes\ndon't contain explicit references to striking, but\nsubsume striking within the range of conduct prescribed\nby their offensive touching prong.\nSo it simply wouldn't be possible, in most\ncases, for a court to look at the cold record of the\nunderlying State conviction and try to discern exactly\nhow much force was involved in the offense and whether\nthat force satisfied the Petitioner's proposed\nthreshold, whatever it means.\nAt the end of the day, the principal\nquestion before the court is one that is, primarily,\nrelevant to the Section 922(g)(9) provision and other\nfederal misdemeanor domestic violence provisions and one\nthat we think, in considering the purposes of those\nstatutes and the very serious dangers that they address,\nthe Court ought to interpret the plain text of the\nstatutes in light of their plain meaning.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nMs. Call, you have four minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LISA CALL\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. CALL: Thank you, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I don't want to waste\ntoo much of your time on the remand, but I can't really\nfault the government for waiving a right to raise a\nclaim under Clause 2, which is your second reason for\nnot -- not remanding, and it -- it does seem, to, me\nthat the Eleventh Circuit -- one permissible reading was\nthat they were just looking at 1, so that we would have\nto remand.\nMS. CALL: Justice Kennedy, I would have to\ndisagree with that because it was fully briefed, fully\nargued --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I understand that.\nMS. CALL: And I take the -- the provision\nthat when they indicated that the test was exclusively\nunder the first prong.\nSecond, Your Honor, I believe it would\nsimply be a waste of judicial resources if the Court\nfinds that this battery by touching doesn't have, as an\nelement, the use of force, the test would be to remand\nit to decide whether it meets the Begay standard, which\nis purposeful, violent, aggressive, and all of those\ntests.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. Except in this area,\nI am a little reluctant when it hasn't been argued\nbefore as to make a definitive holding, but I will look\nat the Eleventh Circuit opinion again.\nMS. CALL: Yes, Your Honor, and the other\nnote I would make is, factually, at page 40 of the joint\nappendix, they indicated there were no other Shepard\ndocuments to offer to the Court, so the entire record is\navailable for reconsideration and is available to this\nCourt.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Thank you.\nMS. CALL: And, Your Honor, I wanted to note\nthis is not just an academic exercise on noticing what\nphysical force means. Absent this one finding of\nMr. Johnson's prior conviction was a violent felony, it\nraised his guideline range, from 27 to 33 months, to a\nmandatory minimum sentence of 15 years.\nSo the danger of including this crime, when\nthe art or criminal act was not designed to include all\ncrimes or all offenders, means that it took all\ndiscretion away from the sentencing judge.\nIn ACCA, Congress set a superior high\nstandard requiring three priors on three -- that\noccurred on three separate occasions, and so looking at\nthis decision, when Mr. Johnson was put inside the box,\nthat tied the judge's hands.\nIf this were not considered a violent\nfelony, the sentencing judge could consider that under\nthe guidelines in the 3553 factors. But to read\nphysical force so broadly is to, in essence, collapse\nthe distinction between those violent offenses that are\nmeant to be included in the Armed Career Criminal Act\nand those that are not.\nYour Honors, I would also note one matter,\nthat physical contact is used in the assault statutes\nunder the Federal Code, so there is a different\nprovision -- a different meaning to physical contact\nthan to physical force, and the physical force, in this\ndefinition, is looking at what level and what sort of\nforce Congress intended to require to impose this very\nhigh sentencing standard.\nAnd this Court had rejected, in Shepard, the\ngovernment's same happenstance argument that\nprosecutions would depend on recordkeeping and charging\ndecisions, and so, for all the reasons argued,\nMr. Johnson would ask that this Court vacate the lower\ndecision and remand for resentencing.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\n"
