CLEMENT\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nFEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice and may it\nplease the Court:\nCongress has directed the FCC to use auctions to\nallocate scarce wireless spectrum in a manner that\nfurthers the public interest. Those auctions allocate\nspectrum to the party who will -- who values the spectrum\nmost highly and, by assumption, will use it most\neffectively to serve the public. In addition, Congress\nhas directed the FCC to consider a number of specific\nfactors in assessing the public interest, including\npromoting opportunities for small business and ensuring\nthe rapid deployment of wireless services. Nothing in\nthat public interest regulatory regime runs afoul of\nsection 525 of the Bankruptcy Code.\nTo be sure, in administering its auctions the\nFCC does place consequences on the regulatory signals\nprovided by the failure to meet regulatory payment\ndeadlines. In particular, the FCC views the failure to\nmake a timely regulatory payment as a proxy for a\ndetermination that continued possession of the license is\nnot in the public interest.\nQUESTION: But your point is, is that the\nregulatory discretion and authority of the agency has been\nreplaced under the statutory scheme in large part by the\ndynamics of the free market. The highest bidder shows us\nwhich is the most qualified person.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: That's right. It's been\nreplaced in large part but not exclusively, and I think\nboth aspects that are important --\nQUESTION: Well, as to the first part, isn't the\nBankruptcy Code and the policy of new start and creditors\nand so forth, isn't that really part of the free market\nstructure?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I think there's a\ndifference, though, when a regulator regulates solely for\ntimely payment for its own sake, and in that case it\nimplicates only the policies that are addressed by the\nBankruptcy Code, and I think it's a different situation\nwhen the regulator looks at the failure to make timely\npayment as a proxy for something else.\nQUESTION: Well, but Mr. Clement, in your\npetition for certiorari, the question presented speaks of\nan obtained option automatically canceled. That suggests\nthat it is indeed automatic.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, it's automatic in the\nsense --\nQUESTION: I mean, automatic means without any\ndiscretion.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: With respect, Justice, Chief\nJustice Rehnquist, when it says automatic, what it means\nis that it cancels without any, the need for any further\naction from the commission, but in any given case, the\ncancellation of a license is a result both of the\nautomatic cancellation rule and the fact that a payment\ndeadline has come forward, and where the commission has\ndiscretion is in relaxing the payment deadline, and you\ncan see that in this very case. NextWave's license is\ncanceled, according to the FCC, because NextWave failed to\nmake the very first installment payment due under those\nlicenses.\nNow, according to the licenses in the first instance,\nthat payment was due on April 30, 1997, but the licenses\ndidn't cancel on April 30, 1997 because the commission in\nits discretion, as part of a multifactor public interest\ndetermination, extended the payment deadline a full 18\nmonths.\nQUESTION: Well, Mr. Clement, it appears to me\nthat the FCC went along with the bankruptcy filing, filed\na claim for the amount that wasn't paid, and apparently\nwent along with the proposals for a while to work this out\nand then, very shortly before the decision to reauction\nthe things, the FCC decided not to go along with it. That\ndoesn't sound like some automatic cancellation. I mean,\nthe FCC appeared to treat it very much like the bankruptcy\nclaim for quite some time, didn't it?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, to be sure, the FCC\nparticipated in the bankruptcy proceedings and protected\nits interests as a creditor, but at the same time it has\nindependent interests as a regulator, and the FCC, as we\npoint out on page 19 of the reply brief, made clear at\nvarious points well before NextWave went into bankruptcy\nthat it did not view bankruptcy as an exception from the\nregulatory provisions of the Communications Act, and I\nthink if you look at the specific event that NextWave\npoints to as the automatic cancellation, it's the failure\nto make a payment that was due on October 29, 1998, and it\nwas due on the 29th of October, 1998, rather than April\n30, 1997, precisely because of a public interest\ndetermination by the commission.\nQUESTION: You say a public interest\ndetermination, but the only correlation that seems clear\nto me is a purely economic correlation. When the value of\nthe leases dropped, the FCC apparently went into the\nBankruptcy Court and said, we want our full $4 billion,\nand when the value of the leases went up, the FCC took the\nposition, we want to reauction them and get the increase\nin value. It seems at each point at which the FCC made a\ndecision, it was making an economic decision, not a\nregulatory decision.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: With respect, Justice Souter,\nI don't think that's correct. When -- I mean, it is true\nthat the FCC tried to go in and protect its interests as a\ncreditor, but at the point that NextWave was trying to\nkeep its regulatory licenses that it promised to pay $4.7\nbillion for, and trying to keep those licenses for just\nover a billion, the result of that process would have been\nthat the rest of that amount, the $3 billion plus, would\nhave been an unsecured claim of the FCC, that would have\nbeen really worth virtually nothing, so I think the better\nway to understand this case is that the FCC does have\ninterests as a creditor, and it has tried to protect those\ninterests in the bankruptcy proceedings and has\nparticipated in those proceedings, but at the same time,\nit has interests with the -- as a regulator, and in its\ncapacity as a regulator it hasn't acted in a way that\nwould result in a sole-cause cancellation.\nQUESTION: Mr. Clement, suppose -- and I\nconsider this a classic case for what this provision of\nthe Bankruptcy Code was directed to. Suppose you have a\nState law that says anyone who is in default of traffic\ntickets that amount to more than $500 shall have his\nlicense revoked, okay, and the person in question goes\ninto bankruptcy, doesn't pay the $500, gets the $500\ndischarged in bankruptcy, the State you think can revoke\nhis license?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: No, I don't, but let me give\nyou --\nQUESTION: Why not? Isn't there a regulatory\npurpose there?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: No. The only regulatory\npurpose there, at least as I understand your hypothetical,\nis in providing for timely payment, but suppose a State --\nQUESTION: No, the regulatory purpose is having\nfinancially responsible drivers so people don't run around\nthe road hurting people and leaving them to bleed on their\nown account.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well --\nQUESTION: There's just as much a regulatory\npurpose in that hypo as there is here.\nQUESTION: You can always find a regulatory\npurpose. I mean, it's the easiest thing in the world to\ndo.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: But again, but if a State had\na regulatory purpose in ensuring that its drivers were\nfinancially responsible, and presumptively said that a\nlicense would fail to cancel for the failure to pay $500\nin traffic tickets, but provided a mechanism for the\ndriver to go in before the regulatory commission and say,\nlook, I know I haven't paid $500 worth of traffic tickets,\nbut I'm actually financially responsible. I have a ton of\nmoney in the bank, and so you ought to give me a\nrelaxation of the rules or a waiver --\nQUESTION: There's always such a mechanism\nwhenever you have a debtor and a creditor. The creditor\ncan always extend the payment.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Right, but --\nQUESTION: You need some special power from the\nState to do that?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, but again, if you look,\nand what the regulator is doing is extending the --\nextending the payment not as a creditor, but as a\nregulator, I think you're in a very different situation.\nQUESTION: So you're just making up a regulatory\npurpose, as a regulator. I mean, as a regulator, as a\ncreditor you can always say it's being done as a\nregulator, always.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I really don't think that's\ntrue, with respect. I think the kind of waiver proceeding\nor opportunity to relax the rules would be out of place in\na regulatory regime that was only concerned with timely\npayment. It's precisely because the FCC uses the timely\npayment, or the failure to make timely payment, as a proxy\nfor a public interest determination that it has this\nwaiver proceeding, and it gives the regulating entity --\nQUESTION: That's something that I don't fully\ngrasp in your argument. First you say, this is fully\nautomatic, this cancellation of the license. You don't\npay up, license gone. But then you say, but we can extend\nthe time if we want to. We can use our discretion. Well,\nthe automatic argument seems at war with the discretion\nargument.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I mean, there is some\ntension there, and the FCC has been at pains to try to\nmake sure that it doesn't bend over one way too far or the\nother. In its restructuring order that I think is\ncritical in this case. It froze the payments -- it\nsuspended the payments ultimately for 18 months, and then\nit also provided some restructuring options that required\nfurther modifications of its rules.\nQUESTION: Well --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: When it did that --\nQUESTION: Go ahead.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: When it did that, not only did\nsome people complain that they didn't give enough\nregulatory relief, but other disappointed bidders ran to\nthe D.C. Circuit and said, look, you've acted arbitrarily\nand capriciously because you haven't stuck with your\npre-auction rules.\nQUESTION: But this doesn't sound at all like\nthe question presented, which says at auction,\nautomatically cancel upon the winning bidder's failure to\nmake timely payments to fulfill its winning bid. It --\nwhen you were drafting that question, it sounds like your\nperception of the thing was quite different than it is\nnow.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, again I think the key\nis, the payments do cancel automatically after all the\nefforts to get the payments extended have failed, and\nthat's just not like a hypothetical consideration in this\ncase, because in this very case --\nQUESTION: I agree, you've said two different\nthings there. If it's automatic, it happened without\nwhatever happened next. But you're saying it\nautomatically canceled after attempts to collect failed.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: No, no, not after attempts\nto --\nQUESTION: So when was the automatic trigger?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: The automatic trigger is when\nsomebody fails to make a payment --\nQUESTION: All right. Is that enough?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: And -- no, it's really not\nenough, if you look at the broader perspective of the\nregulation, because there's an alternative way to get out\nof the automatic cancellation. It's not -- if you're a\nregulated entity and you don't want your license to\ncancel, you don't go to the commission and say, don't\napply the automatic cancellation. What you do is, you go\nto the commission and you say, I've a regulatory payment.\nIt's going to be due April 30. I'm not in a good position\nto make that payment, so what I'd like you to do is relax\nthe payment deadline, and --\nQUESTION: And you say you have the authority to\nrelax the payment date?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Not only does the commission\nhave the authority to do that --\nQUESTION: If that's true --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- it did it in this very\ncase.\nQUESTION: If that's true, why don't you settle\nthe case today? They say they can pay in full today.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, the reason we don't\nsettle the case today, although obviously there were\nefforts to try to settle this, which would require\ncongressional legislation, which we were unable to get in\na timely fashion, but the reason that they are not in a\nposition to cure their defaults, if you will, is because\nour view is that they have -- the opportunity to cure has\npassed. The licenses have actually already --\nQUESTION: But is the option to cure -- if you\nwanted to settle, would you be disabled from settling, or\ncould you settle, decide, well, we think it would be wise\nregulation now to accept the payment?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think it would be within the\nagency's discretion to settle the litigation at this\npoint. Now, of course, if we did that, I'm sure, as in\nthe last time the commission tried to relax its rules, I'm\nsure we'd draw a D.C. Circuit challenge to that exercise\nof discretion to relax the rules. But the very fact that\nthere is that reservoir of discretion to relax the rules\ndemonstrates that the ultimate cancellation is not a\nsole-cause cancellation.\nQUESTION: I think -- so it is really a legal\nissue, whether you have that discretion or not? I mean,\nthere are people who say you don't have that discretion.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Absolutely.\nQUESTION: Well, do we have to decide that in\nthis case? I didn't realize that was one of the issues\npresented. That may be a more important issue than the,\nyou know, few billion dollars involved here.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well --\nQUESTION: Right?\n(Laughter.)\nGENERAL CLEMENT: But I don't think -- whether\nor not the FCC has the authority to exercise that\ndiscretion in a particular case might be an issue, but\nit's undisputed that they have that right as a general\nmatter and, in fact, NextWave wouldn't be here today if\nthe FCC didn't have the authority to offer discretionary\nrelaxation of its rules. When NextWave's --\nQUESTION: Well, you might not be here, but I\nmean, we're just assuming that it had that. The case is\nhere. That is not one of the questions presented. I\nfrankly don't want to decide that question, because that\nis not one of the things I've given a lot of attention to.\nIt sounds to me very, you know, at least quite arguable\nwhether they ought to have that authority.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Scalia, I don't\nreally think it's in dispute, because in this very case\nthe payment deadline --\nQUESTION: I agree it's not in dispute, which\nmeans we don't have to decide it. It's not presented in\nthe case.\nQUESTION: -- the question.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I --\nQUESTION: Mr. Clement, the respondent also\nmakes a right-to-cure argument under the bankruptcy law,\nand you haven't addressed that, I take it, in your briefs,\nanyway.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: No. We think the\nright-to-cure argument is best addressed on remand. I do\nthink there are two reasons why the right to cure is not\nany longer available to NextWave. One is that the\nlicenses automatically canceled on their own terms. The\nsecond reason is that the license restriction, the\nlicenses themselves had a restriction on transfer or\nalienation, and there's law under 11 U.S.C. 365 that deals\nwith executory obligations that says that the debtor in\npossession cannot take possession of a license, assume the\nobligations of a license if there are restrictions on its\nalienation or transfer.\nQUESTION: In FCC practice, have you ever\nrevoked a license and then decided that you're going to\nreissue it to the initial holder?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, there have been\nsituations like that, not necessarily in the C-Block\nlicense situation, but there was a situation with respect\nto a different program where a license canceled by its own\nterms by a failure to renew, and the commission renewed\nthat license largely on the basis of the fact that that\nlicensee was already providing service, and so the result\nof revoking the license would be to deny people service\nthat was currently being provided.\nNow, in the reconsideration order that's the\nsubject --\nQUESTION: Well, a reconsideration order is\ndifferent, but a new issuance it seems to me is quite\nquestionable so far as the discretion of the agency, and I\nthink I agree with some of my colleagues, I'm not sure\nthat's before us.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I think that particular\ninstance is particularly relevant, because NextWave relied\non that in its reconsideration proceedings before the\ncommission. And the commission, in rejecting that, I\nthink demonstrated why this isn't a case of sole-cause\ncancellation. If you look at the commission's reasoning\non page 82a of the petition appendix, the commission says,\nquote, \"NextWave is providing no service. The spectrum\nlicensed to NextWave has gone unused since early 1997, and\nrepresents licenses in 90 markets across the United\nStates.\"\nQUESTION: But that same order repeatedly refers\nto the automatic cancellation rule.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Absolutely, it does, and what\nthe commission decided in this order, which is under\nreview in this case, is that it was not going to relax or\nprovide an exception to the automatic cancellation rule,\nbut the reason it decided that is because NextWave wasn't\nproviding service, and that others stood ready to provide\nservice under that spectrum, and what I would respectfully\nsuggest is that under those circumstances the cancellation\nis not a sole-cause cancellation.\nIt also reflects the fact that NextWave wasn't\nproviding service, that others stood ready to do it, and\nthat's enough to take it out of 525, which is, after all,\na very narrowly written provision. It only protects\nagainst sole cancellation. It allows the failure to pay a\ndischargeable debt to be a contributing factor in a\nregulatory decision, indeed, the primary factor in the\nregulatory decision, just not the sole cause.\nQUESTION: May I ask just one question about\nyour interpretation of the automatic cancellation? Is it\nthe commission's view that they could -- there would be a\ncancellation, they could reauction the licenses, and that\nthe original licensee would still remain liable for the\nentire debt?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think the position is they\nmight have an opportunity to go after that as an unsecured\ndebt in bankruptcy.\nQUESTION: Yes, but they would remain liable for\nthe entire debt, in your view?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: That's true.\nI'd like to reserve the remainder of my time for\nrebuttal.\nQUESTION: Well, may I just follow up on that?\nI mean, I assumed that was not an issue here because they\nhad auctioned them off again and they had mitigated their\ndamages. Is that the way the commission treated it?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: That's an open question before\nthe commission that they haven't addressed.\nThank you.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Clement.\nMr. Franklin, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN S. FRANKLIN\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS ARCTIC SLOPE\nREGIONAL CORPORATION, ET AL.\nMR. FRANKLIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe question in this case is whether section 525\nof the Bankruptcy Code permits a bankrupt company and a\nbankruptcy judge to override the FCC's regulatory\ndetermination of the public interest and thereby allow the\ncompany to retain an exclusive entitlement to use the\nNation's airwaves that the FCC and Congress have\ndetermined is not in the public interest for it to hold.\nQUESTION: You refer to it as a regulatory\ndetermination which, of course, assumes the whole point at\nissue.\nMR. FRANKLIN: Well, I don't think it -- I think\nthat that, in fact, is undisputed as this case comes\nbefore the Court, that the FCC had valid regulatory\nreasons for taking the action it did.\nQUESTION: Then why is it phrased in terms of an\nautomatic cancellation rule?\nMR. FRANKLIN: Because the automatic\ncancellation happened in November of 1998, but one cannot\nlook at that as a mere snapshot. You have to look at the\nreasons why the FCC had that rule and the reasons why the\nFCC had their auction --\nQUESTION: Why do you have to look at the\nreasons? I mean, that's what troubles me. The language\nof the statute simply says that a governmental unit may\nnot revoke a charter, franchise, or other similar grant,\nokay -- it goes on, solely because --\nMR. FRANKLIN: Right.\nQUESTION: -- such person is or has been a\ndebtor, blah, blah, or hasn't made a payment. Solely\nbecause.\nMR. FRANKLIN: Right.\nQUESTION: Now, let's assume that there is a\nFederal statute that makes discrimination because of, or\nfailure to hire someone, or let's say, let's say killing\nsomeone solely because of his race --\nMR. FRANKLIN: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- a crime, a separate crime. And\nsomeone, let's assume he kills someone who is Jewish, and\nhe said, well, I didn't kill him solely because he was\nJewish; I killed him because I disagree with the policies\nof Israel. Does that get him out of the statute?\nMR. FRANKLIN: Well, I'm not aware of a statute\nlike that, that says, solely because --\nQUESTION: Oh, I made it up.\nMR. FRANKLIN: I know that, but --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FRANKLIN: But it's important. The section\n525 is drafted -- is an antidiscrimination statute, but\nit's drafted differently than other -- title VII, for\nexample, does not use the word --\nQUESTION: I'm getting to the question of\nwhether the fact that you have some other motive --\nMR. FRANKLIN: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- eliminates the sole causality.\nThe only reason this person was killed was because he was\nJewish, and so also here, the only reason this license was\nterminated is because the person hadn't paid.\nNow, there may be some regulatory motive in the\nbackground, just as in the hypothetical that I invented\nthere was some international political motive in the\nbackground, but that doesn't alter the fact that the\nperson was killed solely because he was Jewish, and it\nseems to me that the license here was revoked solely\nbecause the payment hadn't been made.\nMR. FRANKLIN: With respect, Your Honor, the\nterm because, when it is used in antidiscrimination\nstatutes, and we have cited cases on page 3 of our reply\nbrief, is used to mean motive. Because means, for the\nreason that. That's what the definition of the word,\nbecause -- when Congress drafted section 525, it drafted\nthe statute narrowly. It intended to prohibit\narbitrary --\nQUESTION: Then the statute doesn't cover\nanything, because every regulatory body that cancels a\nlicense, whenever there's a license involved, you can say\nthat there is some regulatory motive, as in the\nhypothetical that I gave to Mr. Clement.\nMR. FRANKLIN: Well --\nQUESTION: The motor vehicle cancellation.\nMR. FRANKLIN: I think that -- under section\n525, the mere fact that an agency has said it has a\nregulatory motive is not sufficient. It has to be a valid\none that is not simply an arbitrary attempt to collect a\ndebt, and, Your Honors --\nQUESTION: Okay, can -- on that point, do you\nagree that the statute is a response to -- the Perez case,\nthe automobile cancellation?\nMR. FRANKLIN: Yes.\nQUESTION: There was a regulatory motive there.\nThe regulatory motive is financially responsible drivers.\nThe benefits of that are obvious.\nMR. FRANKLIN: Well --\nQUESTION: So if that situation is supposed to\nbe covered by the statute, then by a parity of reasoning,\nso would this one be.\nMR. FRANKLIN: But in Perez the Court examined\nthat motive and determined that looking at the statute and\nlooking at the way it operated, in fact, as the Court put\nit, the sole emphasis of the statute was not the\nregulatory purpose. It was -- as the Court said, the sole\nemphasis was the collection of debts.\nQUESTION: Okay, then sole emphasis and sole\npurpose really boils down not to exclusiveness but a kind\nof proximate or principal causation theory, and if that's\nthe case, certainly here the FCC treated the debtor\nrelationship as the principal determinant of the various\nsteps that it took. First, it insisted on its 4 billion,\nthen when the market changed it said, forget it, we want\nto reauction, and if it's a principal or proximate kind of\ncausation theory, I don't see how you can prevail.\nMR. FRANKLIN: I don't think that section 525\nembodies a causation theory in the way that Your Honor is\npostulating. I think that section 525 most specifically\nspeaks about which are the valid considerations that an\nagency can look at, and in this case one needs to look at\nthe auction system that Congress established.\nCongress intended to replace the cumbersome\ncomparative hearings and unjust lotteries of the past with\na new, more streamlined mechanism under which an\nentitlement to use our airwaves, everybody's airwaves, is\nallocated to the person that, or the company that values\nit the most, and the way we know that is that they must\nmake good on the promises embodied in their auction bid.\nQUESTION: Then why doesn't automatic mean\nautomatic? Your brother has just explained that automatic\nmeans sometimes.\nMR. FRANKLIN: Automatic --\nQUESTION: It means automatic without teeth.\nMR. FRANKLIN: Automatic means automatic,\nalthough there are opportunities, as --\nQUESTION: Automatic except where it isn't.\nMR. FRANKLIN: Well --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FRANKLIN: Our position in this case is\nthat the cancellation was automatic, but that it was\nsupported by valid regulatory concerns, and those\nconcerns -- I mean, the auction system mandated by\nCongress would be completely vitiated if a bidder -- and I\nrepresent people that, companies that are repeat players\nin this game. Bidders cannot come in and obtain an\nentitlement to use our airwaves by promising that they\nwill make a payment, and that's the reason why they're\nselected --\nQUESTION: Then Mr. Franklin, why didn't\nCongress provide an exception, as it did in, for\nperishable commodities for the Department of Agriculture?\nMR. FRANKLIN: Well --\nQUESTION: If there is this nonbankruptcy\noverriding concern, then we have one example where\nCongress responded to it by saying the bankruptcy\nprovision isn't going to prevail.\nMR. FRANKLIN: Well, I -- no exception was\nneeded here. The agriculture programs allow the Secretary\nof Agriculture to do what the FCC may not do here, and\nthat is to cancel a license solely because of a failure, a\nbankruptcy status.\nNow, if you look at the statutes that are cited\nin our reply brief, the agriculture statutes, they allow\nthe Secretary of Agriculture to terminate an agricultural\nlicense where somebody has been discharged from\nbankruptcy, ever in the past, or even if a partner or a\nshareholder of a company has been discharged from\nbankruptcy.\nNow, the legislative history of that specific\nexemption makes clear that Congress -- there was a debate\nin Congress as to whether the solely because language\nwould cover that, whether there was a regulatory purpose\nor not, and Congress felt like they didn't want to have to\ndeal with that.\nIn this case, however, it is undisputed there\nwas a valid regulatory purpose, and with respect, Justice\nScalia, I do not --\nQUESTION: Of course, nothing in the Federal\nCommunications Act requires the Federal Communications\nCommission to stand as the guarantor, you know, to hold\nthe bag for the person that they're giving away this\nmultibillion-dollar license to. They could require cash\non the barrelhead, couldn't they? And let the person who\nwants the license get a loan from some bank, let them be\nstuck holding the bag.\nMR. FRANKLIN: But even in that --\nQUESTION: So there's no regulatory necessity\nfor this whole tragedy, is there?\nMR. FRANKLIN: No, with respect, if one looks at\na cash-on-the-barrelhead system, the way the FCC auctions\nwork, and our clients are deeply involved in them, one\ndoes not get the license right after becoming the high\nbidder. There is a period of time in which the FCC has to\nlook at various factors and people have the right to file\npetitions to deny. Under NextWave's interpretation of\nsection 525, which prohibits an agency from denying a\nlicense to anyone for failing to pay a dischargeable debt,\nunder their interpretation the FCC would be required to\ngrant a license to somebody who has been declared the high\nbidder and then declares bankruptcy the next day.\nWhat NextWave is doing here is truly gaming the\nsystem. They are saying, it's a heads I win, tails you\nlose scenario. We can go into bankruptcy, we get the\nlicense because we promised that we would pay more than\nanybody else would --\nQUESTION: May I stop you in your hypothetical,\nbecause I thought you don't get the license till after you\nhave make the down payment.\nMR. FRANKLIN: You make a down payment, and\nNextWave made their down payment.\nQUESTION: Yes, but they didn't have any license\nuntil they did that.\nMR. FRANKLIN: But what I'm saying is, even on a\ncash-on-the-barrelhead system the FCC does not require\nfull payment, it can't require full payment until they\nactually grant the license, and that is a several-month\nlag between the time when you're declared the high\nbidder -- in one case, in my client's case it was more\nthan a year after they were declared the high bidder for\nlicenses, and they actually received them, because of\nproceedings that were filed.\nQUESTION: The rationale offered by the\ncommission here was that the policies of the FCC outweigh\nthe policies of the Bankruptcy Act. Is there authority\nfor us to defer to the commission in making that kind of a\ndetermination? I mean, why don't we defer to the\nBankruptcy Court, which says the policies of the\nBankruptcy Act are more important than the policies of the\n--\nMR. FRANKLIN: I don't think that the FCC has\ndeference in interpreting the Bankruptcy Code, but I don't\nthink it's a question of whether one policy outweighs the\nother. I think --\nQUESTION: Well, that's the explicit rationale\nof the commission.\nMR. FRANKLIN: Well, our rationale --\nQUESTION: That's what it said.\nMR. FRANKLIN: Our rationale is that they can be\nharmonized, and should be harmonized. For example, the\nexception, the regulatory exception to the automatic --\nQUESTION: So that you don't defend the\nrationale offered by the commission?\nMR. FRANKLIN: I'm not sure that that is the\nexact rationale, but we think that the policies can be\nharmonized and should be harmonized.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Franklin.\nMr. Verrilli.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. VERRILLI: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe record is clear that the FCC revoked\nNextWave's licenses solely because NextWave deferred a\npayment to the FCC while reorganizing in bankruptcy. Two\nand a half years ago the FCC blocked NextWave's bankruptcy\nreorganization, and it did so by announcing that\nNextWave's licenses had automatically canceled because\nNextWave had deferred a loan payment to the FCC in 1998.\nQUESTION: What do you mean, had deferred it?\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, because NextWave --\nQUESTION: You mean, failed to make it?\nMR. VERRILLI: It did not make it, yes. It did\nnot make it.\nQUESTION: Why don't we say that?\nMR. VERRILLI: It did not make it --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. VERRILLI: -- in 1998.\nQUESTION: There might have been some legal\nmumbo-jumbo that had caused the payment not to be due.\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, we were reorganizing in\nbankruptcy --\nQUESTION: You didn't pay it. You didn't pay\nit.\nMR. VERRILLI: -- and we did not pay because we\nwere reorganizing, that's right.\nNow, throughout the proceedings in this case the\nFCC has never identified a ground, other than that single\nnonpayment, that would support revocation of the licenses,\nand that's because there isn't one. What the FCC has done\ninstead, and what it's done here this morning, is to\ninstead suggest that section 525 of the Bankruptcy Code\nought not apply because the FCC had a regulatory or public\ninterest purpose for making a nonpayment an automatic sole\ntrigger for revocation of a license, but in passing the\nBankruptcy Code, Congress already weighed the public\ninterests, and section 525 of the code is a clear\nexpression of Congress's judgment about where the public\ninterest lies.\nQUESTION: But they say it's not automatic.\nWhat do you say to that?\nMR. VERRILLI: I think the record utterly and\ncompletely refutes that proposition, and it does so in the\nfollowing ways. The regulation that they cite, which is\n1.2110 of their rules, and it's at page 495 of the\nappendix to the petition, says that the licenses cancel\nautomatically upon nonpayment. The face of the license\nsays that the licenses cancel automatically upon\nnonpayment and for no other reason.\nThe announcement of the license cancellation in\nthis case in January 2000 said that the licenses canceled\nautomatically for nonpayment and no other reason.\nQUESTION: But we know how the commission has\ninterpreted it. I mean, they did say, we're going to give\nyou a moratorium. We're going to give you a chance, and\nwe'll make a deal for you. You give back some of those\nlicenses, and we'll work out a settlement, and for one\nyear the FCC said, it's okay if you don't pay while we're\nconsidering some kind of settlement, so --\nMR. VERRILLI: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, in the\nrestructuring orders they did do that, but that doesn't\nmake the revocation any less automatic. All it did was\nmove the date back in a legislative, quasi-legislative\nrulemaking, move the date from when it would initially\nhave occurred to a later time. When --\nQUESTION: But if there had been such a\nsettlement, then there could have been some, at least,\nlicenses retained even though there had been the\nnonpayment, which is supposed to be an automatic trigger.\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, yes, Justice Ginsburg, but\nthe date was suspended by the FCC well in advance. The\npayment date was suspended well in advance of its\noccurrence, so a payment date never came and went without\nNextWave or any other licensee failing to make a payment.\nAll that happened here was that in advance of the payment\ndate, the FCC moved the payment date, but when it did so,\nit reaffirmed --\nQUESTION: There had not been a failure to make\nan earlier payment?\nMR. VERRILLI: That's exactly right, Justice\nScalia. This was suspended in advance of the due date for\nthe first payment.\nQUESTION: Okay, so --\nQUESTION: Mr. Verrilli, let me ask you about\nsomething else. The bankruptcy court, as I understand it,\nordered a $3.7 billion reduction in the purchase price on\nconstructive broad grounds, is that right?\nMR. VERRILLI: That is right, Justice O'Connor.\nQUESTION: And if we were to affirm here, does\nthe FCC have any power to prevent a bankruptcy court from\nreducing the price in that fashion?\nMR. VERRILLI: Yes.\nQUESTION: That's very strange.\nMR. VERRILLI: Yes, it does, and it's already\nbeen taken care of, in fact. The question under the\navoidance provisions of the Bankruptcy Code is when the\ndebtor's obligation becomes due, and the issue here was\nwhether the obligation became due on the date of the\nauction or, instead, later, at the time the licenses were\nawarded. Now, that is a matter entirely within the\ncontrol of the FCC. All they have to do is make clear in\ntheir regulations when the obligation attaches.\nThe reason that there was a problem here was\nthat the regulations suggested that the obligation\nattached later and, therefore, if the value of the asset\ndeclined from the time of the initial auction to the time\nof the license award, section 544 would apply. But the\nFCC has changed its regulations, and at this point it is\nunambiguous that the obligation attaches at the time of\nthe auction -- and therefore 544 can't operate.\nQUESTION: Well, didn't the second circuit set\naside the bankruptcy order in that case?\nMR. VERRILLI: -- and it did. It's just a\nnonissue. It's just -- that issue is just a nonissue, and\nin any event it isn't -- the question really here is\nwhether the FCC, when it effectively acts as a lender, is\ngoing to be treated any differently than a private company\nwhen it acts as a lender.\nQUESTION: That is the question. That's my\nquestion. As I read the statute, it seems to me, for at\nleast your argument's sake, it is solely because, and\nmoreover, of course this statute governs the FCC, but in\nreading the statute, I don't see how this statute was at\nall intended to govern the instance in which the\nGovernment is acting as creditor in respect to receiving\npayment for a good that it has sold.\nNow, I base that on first reading the purposes\nof this in the history, and reading the whole legislative\nhistory, which will not convince some of my colleagues,\nbut nonetheless is a factor in what I think, and I think\nthat this is clearly about a future loan, a future\nsituation in which the future situation, the Government is\nforbidden to discriminate against a human being because he\nwas once in bankruptcy.\nThis seems to be to balance, to bring back into\nbalance the Government vis-a-vis the private creditor. If\nyou're right in your interpretation, and I am wrong, I see\nno way whatsoever in which the Government would have the\nright to take a secured interest or in any other way\ncollect a debt which a human being owes it for buying a\nlicense.\nNow, that's my question. I want to get your\nresponse.\nMR. VERRILLI: My response is the following,\nJustice Breyer. First, the text of 525 is unambiguous.\nIt applies to someone who is or was a debtor, and it\napplies to debts that are dischargeable, as well as those\nthat have been discharged and, therefore, it is clear on\nthe face of the statute that it applies and protects\ncompanies while they are reorganizing and before the debts\nare discharged, so I think on the face of the statute\nthat's -- it's not correct. It's not the right reading of\nthe statute.\nAnd in terms of what it does in operation, it's\nthis. Now, if -- if this had been a situation where the\nFCC had demanded cash on the barrelhead up front, and\nNextWave had gone and bid and gone out and borrowed that\nmoney from a bank, and had to pay the bank over time, and\nthen filed for bankruptcy, there would be no question that\nthat, that the debt to the bank could be reorganized and\ndisposed of in the normal manner in bankruptcy.\nQUESTION: Well, I'm not sure about that. I\nthink if you accept the FCC's argument here, they would\nsay we have a regulatory purpose, because we want it -- we\nwant these licenses to be given to people who have the\nfinancial responsibility to operate the radio stations and\nso forth. The arguments they made would continue to apply\nto that situation.\nMR. VERRILLI: Well --\nQUESTION: So I wouldn't say there's no\nquestion.\nMR. VERRILLI: That's a --\nQUESTION: I think if we accept their argument\nhere, we would probably have to accept it in the other\nsituation.\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, I think if we -- well, I\nthink that that point is exactly right, Justice Scalia,\nthat the Government's regulatory purpose argument, if\naccepted, would give them the authority to revoke licenses\nnot only when the payment was not made to the Government,\nbut not made to private parties.\nQUESTION: So far, I'm trying to get the answer\nto my question, and so far, in terms of my interpretation,\nthe second point you made is in terms of to the\napplicability, if my interpretation is right. I want to\nknow if it's right, and I only come up with one thing that\nyou've said so far, which is text, which is important --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: -- but I learned the second year of\nlaw school, I learned the second year of law school -- and\nobviously many of my colleagues don't agree with me, but I\nlearned the second year of law school that when you have a\ntext which says \"all,\" that there are often implied, not-\nwritten exceptions. All animals in the park. No animals\nin the park doesn't necessarily apply to a pet oyster,\nokay, and so --\nQUESTION: Well, it's not an animal.\nQUESTION: Thank you. An oyster in my course in\nbiology is an animal, all right.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Maybe in yours it was a rock, or a\nvegetable or a mineral. But regardless, you see my point,\nand my question, of course, is that since that's how I\nread statutes -- not everybody -- is that I find\nexceptions implicit in statutes where to fail to read that\nexception is to destroy the purpose of the statute, and is\nnot backed by anything in respect to what the people who\nwrote it want.\nMR. VERRILLI: Well --\nQUESTION: Now, I believe it destroys the\npurpose of the statute because I see no way in which the\nGovernment as creditor could collect the money it's owed\nthrough a secured interest in what they've sold, if my\ninterpretation is wrong.\nMR. VERRILLI: No, it --\nQUESTION: Now, I'm putting that as strong as I\ncan. I want to get a complete answer.\nMR. VERRILLI: Two points. First, the\nGovernment can collect its interest as a secured creditor\nin exactly the same way a private lender could through the\nbankruptcy system. It has enormous protections through\nthe bankruptcy system as a secured creditor. It gets,\nit's 100 percent entitled under the Bankruptcy Code to the\nfull value of the licenses, and it has numerous other\nprotections under the code. It can make an election\nunder --\nQUESTION: Can I stop you right there? How does\nit do that? Because when it goes to enforce its secured\ninterest, I take it it's revoking the license because of\nthe money that was due it. And so how do you -- when you\ngo in to enforce your secured interest in the bankruptcy\ncourt, and the bankruptcy judge on the other side reads\n525(c), 525 on your interpretation, how does he do it?\nBecause it's just like this case. They're revoking it.\nMR. VERRILLI: You can't -- the FCC, like a\nprivate lender, can't foreclose on the lien. It has to --\nits debt has to be processed through the bankruptcy\nsystem.\nQUESTION: Of course it should. That's logical.\nMy point is, how does the bankruptcy judge at that point\nget around the language of 525, on your interpretation of\nit, since on your interpretation of it, you would be\ntaking back the license because of failure to pay a debt.\nMR. VERRILLI: Right. They can't -- under the\nBankruptcy Code they can't take back the license. They\ncan get their secured claim paid to the same extent that a\nprivate lender could, but they can't --\nQUESTION: So they cannot take a secured\ninterest in the license?\nMR. VERRILLI: Yes, they can, and -- but just\nas --\nQUESTION: They don't take the license back if\nthey cause the debtor to have to sell the license and to\ntake the money from the sale of the license and give it to\nthe FCC. Isn't that what's going on? That's different\nfrom a cancellation of the license. The license subsists,\nand the debtor can sell it to somebody else, or the\nbankruptcy court on behalf of the debtor can sell it to\nsomebody else, is that right? Does that need approval\nfrom the FCC?\nMR. VERRILLI: The transfer would, to somebody\nelse would need approval from the FCC, but the key point\nhere is that section 525 --\nQUESTION: But that's different from a\ncancellation, isn't it?\nMR. VERRILLI: Yes, it is different from a\ncancellation, and the key point here I think, Justice\nBreyer, in answer to your question ultimately, is that 525\nis in the Bankruptcy Code to protect the right to\nreorganize. What it says is that those who hold\nGovernment licenses cannot be denied the ability to invoke\nthe bankruptcy process and reorganize solely because they\ndo what the Bankruptcy Code allows them to do.\nWithout this protection, licensing agencies would\nhave the ability to force insolvent debtors to liquidate,\nbecause it would have the power to revoke their permission\nto do business solely because they hadn't paid a debt, or\nsolely because even they were in bankruptcy, and that\nwould --\nQUESTION: Can the FCC -- can an FCC licensee\nencumber the license? Can it pledge the license to\nsome -- to a bank that's giving it a loan?\nMR. VERRILLI: Yes, it can. It can give it as\na -- it can -- the answer to that is yes. There are some\nrestrictions on it, but the answer to that is yes, it can.\nIf I could, I'd like to get back to the question\nof whether this was, in fact, an automatic revocation, and\nthe reconsideration order, which is the order under review\nhere, is the order in which the FCC says principally that\nit departed from the automatic character of the\nrevocation, but that reconsideration order says no fewer\nthan 14 times by my count that the revocation was\nautomatic, and there's one statement in that in particular\nwhich I think should put to rest as a factual matter the\nquestion of whether this was anything other than an\nautomatic cancellation, and that's at page 74a of the\nappendix to the petition, and it's right at the bottom of\nthe page, before the footnote.\nAnd the FCC says in the reconsideration order,\nthus, the only way that NextWave could have avoided the\nloss of its licenses, even under the rule interpretation\nit urges, was to avoid a default by making full and timely\npayment on or before the payment due date. If the only\nway that NextWave could have avoided default was by making\nthe payment, then there is nothing else that could have\nbeen shown, and nothing else that could have happened in\nthe reconsideration process or any waiver process, that\nwould have provided an additional ground for revocation.\nAnd if I could also point the court to a\nstatement on the prior page, page 73a: For all these\nreasons we reject NextWave's interpretation of our default\nand cancellation rules and reaffirm that the failure to\nmake full payment in a timely manner, following exhaustion\nof all applicable grace periods, constitutes a default and\nresults in the automatic cancellation of the license\nwithout further commission action.\nTheir theory is that this happens by operation\nof law on the day after nonpayment. It is as automatic as\nanything can be, and nothing about the reconsideration\nprocess, and nothing about their waiver authority changes\nthat one iota.\nQUESTION: Well, at least according to this\npresentation the FCC said that it does have discretion to\ngrant relief from the automatic cancellation.\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, but they said in the\nreconsideration order that they were not going to do that,\never, because it was an automatic cancellation.\nThey also said in the restructuring orders,\nJustice Ginsburg, that you referred to earlier, in each of\nthe restructuring orders they said they would not grant a\nwaiver of the payment deadline under any circumstances,\nand then when individual licensees sought waivers, the FCC\nrejected the waiver requests, and it cited back to those\nprovisions in the restructuring order saying, we told you\nthis was an automatic rule, and we reject your request,\nand it did so even in instances, in two cases where the\nlicensees were providing service. And so there's just no\nquestion that this was an automatic cancellation rule and\ntherefore precisely at the core of what section 525\nforbids the FCC or any other licensing agencies from\ndoing.\nIf I may, I want to turn to the question of\nwhether there is any conflict between the FCC's exercise\nof its authority under section 309(j) and the Bankruptcy\nCode. The answer is, as a statutory matter there is no\nconflict, because the FCC was not required to have an\ninstallment payment plan, and even if it were required to\nhave one there wouldn't be a conflict because Congress\ndidn't say that the FCC had to make license revocation\nautomatic upon nonpayment. So the FCC's argument really\nis an implied repeal argument here, that 309(j) implicitly\nrepeals 525 in some applications, but --\nQUESTION: Assuming we think there's a conflict,\nis there any authority for the agency's assertion that it\nhas the authority to determine which statute outweighs the\nother?\nMR. VERRILLI: Yes, and the authority is exactly\ncontrary to the position that the FCC deserves deference.\nThe FCC deserves deference only with respect to\ninterpretation of its own statute, not with respect to the\nBankruptcy Code. So the answer is clearly that they don't\nget any deference, and -- but there isn't any conflict.\nAll there is is the FCC -- there isn't any statutory\nconflict. All there is, the only conflict arises from the\nFCC's desire to make this an automatic cancellation rule,\nand the conflict is between an FCC policy choice and a\ndirective from Congress. When the conflict is at that\nlevel, there's no doubt about what the answer is, which is\nthat the directive from Congress prevails.\nQUESTION: If they just simply changed their\nrules to say the FCC \"may\" cancel the license in the event\nof the nonpayment of any installment, that would be\nenough?\nMR. VERRILLI: No.\nQUESTION: No?\nMR. VERRILLI: No, because what 525 forbids are\nthe grounds on which the license is revoked, so if the\nlicense is revoked solely because of nonpayment of\ndischargeable debt, then whether there's a rule or not --\nQUESTION: Oh, it isn't solely because of that.\nThat is a necessary but not a sufficient condition. The\nFCC would be saying, we will consider the regulatory\nsituation. If you fail to make a payment, you are\nrevocable, but we won't revoke necessarily. It depends\nupon the regulatory situation.\nMR. VERRILLI: I think that would violate 525,\nbut for a different reason.\nQUESTION: Ah, okay.\nMR. VERRILLI: And it's this. 525 doesn't\nmerely forbid revocation for nonpayment. It forbids\ndiscrimination, and it forbids imposing conditions solely\nbecause of nonpayment, solely because of being in\nbankruptcy, so --\nQUESTION: What does the word \"solely\" do? I\ncan follow what you just said if it simply said because\nof, but Congress wrote solely, and that has to have some\nfunction.\nMR. VERRILLI: I think it does have several\nfunctions. For example, Your Honor, the FCC has a build-\nout rule for these licenses, says you have to build them\nout within 5 years, and to serve, a requirement that we\nwere in compliance with, by the way. But if we hadn't\nbeen in compliance with them and the FCC had moved to\nrevoke the licenses because we weren't in compliance with\nthe build-out rule, and we had said, well, the reason we\nare not in compliance with the build-out rule is that\nwe're in bankruptcy and we can't pay the vendors to build\nit out, that would be a situation in which the FCC could\nenforce its rule, even though at some level it is because\nwe were in bankruptcy. It's just not \"solely\" because.\nIt's because we violated a neutral rule that was not\nfocused solely on nonpayment. And I think there would be\nother circumstances in which the fact of nonpayment could\nbe a consideration in a broader or a different -- in a\nbroader or different set of circumstances.\nBut when you have what you have here, is where\nit is the only consideration, the only factor, the\ndeterminative consideration, that is the paradigm case of\nviolation of 525. What the FCC has done, it's --\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Verrilli.\nMr. Tribe, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE H. TRIBE\nON BEHALF OF CREDITORS NEXTWAVE\nCOMMUNICATIONS, INC., as amicus curiae\nMR. TRIBE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nClearly, we're dealing in 525 with something\nthat is an exercise of regulatory power, and as several\nmembers of the Court have noted, it's always possible to\nsay, even though we are revoking or canceling this license\nautomatically because you didn't make the payment, we have\nother motives in mind, responsible, financially\nresponsible drivers on the road. We are not simply out to\nget you because of the dollars.\nThat's, of course, not what this statute is\nabout. The whole point of the Perez decision was to get\nrid of Kesler and Reitz, which required peering into the\nmind of the bureaucrats, not always a wonderful vision to\nbehold, and not clear. This is a causation provision, and\nlet me turn to Justice Ginsburg's question from the\nperspective of creditors who need to be able to rely on a\nbright line test of whether something was done solely\nbecause of nonpayment of a dischargeable debt, or solely\nbecause of insolvency, or solely because of an invocation\nof Chapter 11.\nThe word solely, I think, does serve a function\nthere, and that is, in its absence I suppose it would be\npossible for a licensee in regulatory default, a licensee\nwho hadn't built out, to hide behind the existence of a\nfiscal default and say, you see, it's because of the fact\nthat I didn't make a payment, not because I didn't build\nout. Then one has a complicated mess, and from the point\nof view of creditors who need to know whether an agency is\ngoing to pull out the lifeline without which this entire\nedifice collapses and is just a bunch of hardware, not\nworth anything more than the separate parts, from the\npoint of view of creditors who need to know, it seems to\nme a very clear test is needed, and that is, was this the\nsole trigger? Have they come up with some other\nsubstantive, independent basis which either was the\nnecessary cause or a sufficient cause? That's what the\nD.C. Circuit said, and it makes sense.\nQUESTION: Mr. Tribe, what do you say in\nresponse to Justice Breyer's point that the statute really\ndeals with a situation in which the Government agency is\nnot the creditor? That's what it basically was --\nMR. TRIBE: Well, I -- in a way, I think that\nthat makes our point all the stronger, that is, even when\nthe agency has no conflict of interest, it might not be in\nit for the money, and one wonders here why, for example,\nwhy they don't yank the license when the debt is owed to\nprivate creditors? Doesn't that show in just the same way\nthat they're not reliable? That is, in this very case --\nQUESTION: No, no -- well, they want their money\nis all.\nMR. TRIBE: Well, money --\nQUESTION: They want their money, but there are\ntaxicab licenses, there are nuclear power licenses --\nlicensing is the most common thing in the world. You\noften pay for it, and what I really am worried about is,\nimagine they took a secured interest in the license, and\non your interpretation, how do they get the taxicab\nlicense back --\nMR. TRIBE: Well --\nQUESTION: -- which the guy never paid the\n$100,000 for?\nMR. TRIBE: -- the license on my\ninterpretation --\nQUESTION: Yes. Yes.\nMR. TRIBE: -- does not cancel and at\nconfirmation the license is one of the assets of the\nestate, and at that point --\nQUESTION: Well, they could get it back -- in\nother words, they could take it back because they didn't\nrevoke it.\nMR. TRIBE: No, they don't take it back. That\nis, when -- there are a number of things in the estate at\nconfirmation.\nQUESTION: I'm a creditor, I'm a private\ncreditor, I say I have a secured interest in this, it's\nmine, okay. I sell it at auction. Now, the FCC --\nMR. TRIBE: I'm sorry, Justice Breyer. The\nbankruptcy court is filled with elaborate rules about when\nyou can and cannot foreclose. That is, an asset is part\nof the estate at confirmation, and whether you're going to\nbe able to get your money back is a function of whether\nyou are under or oversecured. There are provisions in\n1111(b) for dealing with both situations. Your situation\nis no worse when you are a regulator than the Bank of\nAmerica, or one of the clients in our case, Citicorp, and\nno better.\nQUESTION: That's the part that's precisely\nbothering me, my situation is no worse.\nWhen I read the statute, it seems to me my\nsituation is worse, because if the statute applies here,\nit applies there, and you and your colleague both tell me\nno, that isn't so, and if you can show me it isn't so, my\nproblem disappears.\nMR. TRIBE: What I'm saying, Justice Breyer, is\nthat after bankruptcy, if NextWave, for example, were to\nemerge from bankruptcy they would still have the license,\nbut only on conditions in which you as the FCC, like other\ncreditors, in light of your secured interest, had taken an\nappropriate piece of the pie. You don't get it all,\nthat's the point. Nor does a private creditor get to\ngrab the license and all the value from all the other\ncreditors and, in fact, when you are an agency that is\nwearing really two sets of shoes, the ordinary regulator's\nrunning shoes but also the wing tips of the creditor\nagency, it makes the situation worse, not better.\nThat is, this law is designed to assure that\neven the agency, which does not have a monetary interest,\ncan't simply yank all the value for itself because it has\nthe power over this license.\nIf the agency, on top of all that, is a creditor\nand has that additional set of incentives, then it's all\nthe worse. You wonder, for example, why it is that in the\nMMDS licenses, in which there are licenses that are held\nby a number of bankrupt licensees who did not make the\npayments they promised to make, why it is that the FCC\ndoes not regard them as not having been what they looked\nlike at the time of the bid. The reason is that it's been\npaid in full. So it really is a situation in which the\nFCC's position as a creditor should not redound to its\ncredit. If anything, that makes this statute all the more\nvital.\nThe capital formation that is necessary to make\n309(j) work, to make it possible, Justice Scalia,\nsometimes not to demand all the money up front, but to\nhave something more creative, maybe demand letters of\ncredit, guarantees, none of that can work if creditors who\nput in over half a billion dollars, not in a gamble but on\na very careful business plan that was completely carried\nout, they're not providing service, but Catch-22, it's\nbecause their attempt to emerge and fully cure any default\nwas frustrated by the agency that saw pie in the sky,\nlarge numbers.\nIn that situation, for the agency to be able to\ncollapse the capital formation here tells us something\nrather unpleasant about the future. How likely is it that\nCiticorp and the California and Kansas pension funds and\nall of the other organizations that have put money in on\nreliance on the way section 525 works will do this again\nnext time around?\nThe formation of capital, the market on which\nthe FCC chose to rely, choosing to rely in the capacity of\na first lender, with no more or less secured protection\nthan others, that whole system depends on, in the most\nliteral sense, the rule of law. It does not depend on the\nquestion whether we can attribute to the regulator some\nmotive that does not relate solely to the money. So if\nthe system is to work the way the FCC claims, 525 is a\ndead letter.\nNow, if you were right, Justice Breyer, if there\nreally was a problem that couldn't be solved in the way\nthe confirmation rules work, in the way the pie is divided\nup, then maybe, as with perishable commodities, there\nwould be a problem for Congress to solve. Congress has in\nsection 523 enumerated 18 categories of debts that are not\ndischargeable in bankruptcy, and sometimes it does it in\nanother statute, not always in the Bankruptcy Code. These\nare policy judgments about whether something is unique\nabout the situation that requires treating the Government\nin some different way, the way the Department of\nAgriculture is treated.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Tribe.\nMR. TRIBE: Thank you.\nQUESTION: Mr. Clement, you have 3 minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nFEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nLet me first address Justice O'Connor's very proper\nconcern that licensees are going to be able to enjoy their\nlicenses for much less than they agreed to pay the\ncommission. That is not a dead letter and, in fact, one\nof the cases that is being held for this case involves\nKansas PCS, where the bankruptcy court approved the plan\nthat gave the FCC 5 cents on the dollar for the value of\nits licenses.\nNow, it's true that one mechanism to get the\nlicenses for less than they paid for, the fraudulent\nconveyance theory, is something that the FCC can address.\nThat was the GWI bankruptcy, where the FCC only got 16\ncents on the dollar. But there's a second way to do it,\nwhich is to only give the FCC the value for its security\ninterest, the value of the licenses at that point, and the\nbankruptcy court did that in Kansas PCS, and only gave the\ncommission 5 cents on the dollar.\nSecond, let me address Justice Kennedy's concern\nwith, where's the authority for the FCC to take into\naccount bankruptcy policy concerns? The authority comes\nfrom a D.C. Circuit decision called LaRose, which is cited\non page 79a of the decision, the reconsideration decision\nthat's under review. The LaRose decision is a D.C.\nCircuit decision that tells the FCC that it must take\nbankruptcy policy considerations into account.\nNow --\nQUESTION: It's not binding on us, certainly?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, it is binding on the\nFCC, though, and the FCC tried to do its best to take\nbankruptcy considerations into account. Now, if it failed\nto do it properly --\nQUESTION: But this, they're saying that they're\nnot going to take bankruptcy considerations into account.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: No, they did. They did, and\nagain I think they -- one of the reasons they took\nbankruptcy considerations into account is by extending\npayments for all the C-Block licensees for 18 months. But\nif you think the problem here is that the FCC didn't do\nthe right balancing of bankruptcy policy and\ntelecommunications policy, then the D.C. Circuit or this\ncase could reverse for an arbitrary capriciousness, but\nthat's not the role of 525.\n525 is an exceedingly narrow provision that\nsimply prevents a regulator under any circumstances from\ncanceling a license solely because, and here it's just not\ntrue that the failure to make a payment was the sole\ntrigger, because you have to look at it in context, and\nwhat triggered default is the failure to make a payment of\na payment that was due for a particular reason.\nNow, anybody in -- any FCC licensee could have\ngone to the commission and tried to get a further\nextension of that payment deadline. They'd already gotten\nextended 18 months. They could have gotten extended even\nfurther, and it's hard for me to understand how there's a\nsole trigger when the very payment deadline that is\nsupposed to be -- trigger the automatic cancellation is\nitself the reflection of a multifactor public interest\ndetermination by the commission. They extended it 18\nmonths but no further, based on a consideration of the\npublic interest.\nNow, on Justice Breyer's concern about what's\ngoing on here, I think your concern is exactly right, and\nwhat sense does it make from a bankruptcy policy to\ndisable the Government to make installment payments?\nQUESTION: Exactly right. Why didn't you argue\nit?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I think -- no, I\nthink -- I think --\n(Laughter.)\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think -- there's two reasons\nwe didn't argue it. One, we did -- there is that flavor\nin the brief, but the other reason is, you at one point\nsaid, doesn't the commission just want the money? That's\nactually not true. What we want is, we want the licenses\nback --\nQUESTION: I know, but if they did, it's such an\nobvious argument that I feel there's something wrong with\nit because you didn't argue it.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Don't worry -- thank you, Your\nHonor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\n"
