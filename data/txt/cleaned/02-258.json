PECK\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. PECK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nIn enacting section 1367, Congress took up this\nCourt's invitation in Finley to manage the boundaries of\nsupplemental jurisdiction. It had two goals in doing so.\nIt sought to provide a Federal forum for plaintiffs that\nso chose to use it, and for -- for reasons of respect for\nthe interests of comity and federalism, it provided a\nmechanism by which those cases may be returned to State\ncourt.\nThey knew that there was a dilemma, a dilemma\ncaused by the operation of statutes of limitations, and so\nthey sought to find and found a simple, practical,\nworkable solution that traveled down a well-trod path.\nIt's a path that was traveled down by the Soldier and\nSailors' Relief Act, a act that also tolls State statutes\nof limitations even when exigent circumstances do not\nexist. And in the case in 1993 holding that, Conroy, this\nCourt found that it was applicable in that instance to a\ndefendant who was a town.\nIt also traveled down that road in section 108\nof the Bankruptcy Act. This too provides that kind of 30-\nday window after dismissal of the automatic stay or\nlifting of the automatic stay for a plaintiff to file an\naction which is otherwise purely a State matter in State\ncourt.\nThis Court found in Stewart v. Kahn that there\nis no federalism bar to congressional authority as long as\nthat authority exists someplace in the Constitution.\nThroughout its history, pursuant to Article I, which has a\ncognate provision duplicative of the authority it derives\nalso from Article III, Congress has used its jurisdiction-\nsetting authority as a traffic cop over the area of\nconcurrent State and Federal jurisdiction. It has done so\nalmost from the beginning in the Anti-Injunction Act, the\nremoval statute, and has always found this to be a\nnecessary incident of maintaining a dual-court system.\nQUESTION: Well, the Anti-Injunction Act just\napplies to Federal courts, doesn't it?\nMR. PECK: The -- it gives Federal courts the\nauthority, though, to stay a State action when it\ninterferes with the jurisdiction of the Federal court.\nQUESTION: It's an -- that -- that's an\nexception to the Anti-Injunction Act.\nMR. PECK: That's an exception contained in the\nAnti-Injunction Act, and another exception is when an act\nof Congress so provides.\nThe choice of tolling did not attempt to give\nlonger life in State court than it would have enjoyed in\nFederal court. It did not eliminate defenses that were\navailable in Federal court, have the matter remain there.\nIt did not change the State's policy on waiver of\nmunicipal liability or alter its statute of limitations.\nIt simply said that the case, as it stood in Federal\ncourt, is now available to be heard in State court. The\nState is free to change both its waiver of immunity, its\nstatute of limitations, and Congress accepts those changes\nregardless of the application of the supplemental\njurisdiction statute.\nOnce that jurisdiction attaches, once the\nFederal court has authority to hear the State action, then\neven after the Federal -- Federal claim has fallen away,\nthe court still has the jurisdiction to hear what\notherwise would have been a purely State claim.\nThis is unusual in a diversity case. When\ncomplete diversity is broken, the jurisdiction ends. But\nhere no one, not the Supreme Court of South Carolina, not\nthe respondents, not the amici, questioned Congress'\nauthority to say that this remains a Federal matter\nbecause a Federal interest has attached because the matter\nhas now been heard.\nQUESTION: I didn't understand it that way, I\nthought South Carolina said, Federal court, you want to\ntake this and deal with this stale claim? That's all\nright with us. It's one of the ironies of the case that\nthe State's position is the Federal court can have it if\nyou keep it. The only thing they can't do is give it back\nto us when we don't want it because that would be\ncommandeering the use of our courts. South Carolina's\nposition is the Federal court can keep our State claim in\nFederal court. Indeed, it must if it wants the claim to\nremain alive.\nMR. PECK:\nthis late date, rule 60(b) would enable a plaintiff like\nSusan Jinks to seek to reopen that Federal case, to -- to\nreconsider its judgment and allow this case to still live\nif -- if the tolling provision is ineffective.\nSo here what we're saying is that there's a\ncontinuing Federal interest in this matter. There's --\nthere's been a Federal attachment to what otherwise would\nhave been a purely State matter. In a removal situation,\nfor example, South Carolina could not refuse a remand and\nwe contend that that authority which is contained in the\nremoval statute is the same kind of authority that\nCongress is exercising here because what Congress has\neffectively done is define the legal effect of the\nappearance of this matter in Federal court and the Federal\ndisposition of it. And the State courts of South Carolina\nor any other State is not equipped, it's not authorized to\nrefuse that definition because Congress is the supreme\nsovereign of Federal law. So --\nQUESTION: We -- we know what Congress has --\nhas -- has defined. Why is it important? I mean, what is\nthe -- how would you define the important interest to the\nFederal courts in -- in our seeing the constitutional\nissue your way?\nMR. PECK: Well, first of all, Congress wanted\nto provide this Federal forum.\nauthority to do that. But they also wanted to take in the\ninterest of comity which this Court has always referred to\nas a vital consideration.\nQUESTION: The State says, we don't want this\nkind of comity. Keep it.\nMR. PECK: It's -- it's very nice for the State\nto have that interest, but the federalist design of our\nConstitution provides that impetus that Congress was\nacting on.\nQUESTION: No, but I -- I want to get down to\nspecifically what's important to the Federal courts and to\nCongress.\nMR. PECK: Well --\nQUESTION: Why would it hurt the Federal courts\nif you lose this case? What's -- practically what's --\nwhat's at stake?\nMR. PECK: I -- I think there are -- there are\nseveral things that might happen. Right now what we call\nsupplemental jurisdiction is a doctrine of discretion. It\nwould be turned into a doctrine of plaintiffs' rights,\nthat if the State courts are refusing to receive these\ncase -- cases, then the Federal courts will be obligated\nto hear these State matters even if they were novel and\ncomplex matters in which only the State courts have the\nappropriate expertise to hear it.\ncause some problems.\nQUESTION: What difference does complexity make\nif the State Federal court's position is we don't want to\nclutter up Federal courts with a lot of State tort --\ngarden variety, simple State tort claims? We don't want\nto be a fender bender court.\nMR. PECK: And I think it is perfectly\nlegitimate in Congress' jurisdiction-setting authority for\nthem to make that determination. These are matters that\nare --\nQUESTION: The -- the idea is that Federal\ncourts should be occupied with Federal cases and not with\nState cases.\nMR. PECK: And I -- I think that is an\nappropriate -- appropriate reason for Congress to adopt\nthis kind of a statute to assure that that happens.\nThe other -- Justice Souter, the other possible\nconsequence is that plaintiffs, fearful that a Federal\ncourt will not hear their matter, will not take it back if\nthe -- the State courts will not accept the matter, may be\nleft without a cause of action on their State claim, that\nthey will suddenly be shut out the door. And in order\nto --\nQUESTION: And how is that going to hurt the\nFederal courts?\nMR. PECK: That does not necessarily hurt the\nFederal courts, but Congress certainly has a right to be\nconcerned for those litigants and try to --\nQUESTION: Why -- why isn't the person to be\nconcerned for those litigants the State courts under whose\nlaw the litigants want to sue?\nMR. PECK: Because -- because, Justice Souter,\nhere the State courts have -- have -- Congress has\nbasically done one thing. They've -- they've looked at\nthe idea of comity that this Court had talked about in\nGuaranty Trust, in Ragan, and -- and what they said is\nthat comity is a reciprocal process. It's got to have a\ntwo-way street.\nAnd so what we're doing is we're not giving\nlonger life in Federal court to what's in State court. We\nhave the authority to assign to the State courts a matter\nthat is purely Federal in nature. Now we have a matter\nthat has a Federal interest because of the intervention of\nits arrival in Federal court, and because of that, we have\nenough authority also to say that this is a matter that\nthe State courts can't refuse. They can't suddenly say\nthat we do not recognize the authority here --\nQUESTION: But comity is traditionally a matter\nof consent rather than having one sovereign impress its --\nits law on the other.\nMR. PECK: It is consensual, but then again, the\n-- the idea behind comity is tied up with our -- our\nfederalism and our idea that we have a dual court system.\nThat dual court system recognizes that there will be\nconflicts. There will be some -- some difficulties\nbetween the Federal and State systems. Those difficulties\nis what Congress is trying to police.\nIt's a -- it's a function that they have\nperformed repeatedly, and the removal statute is a very\ngood example of that. And certainly Congress could insist\n-- could insist that the State courts receive back even a\nmatter that the Federal court erroneously dismissed rather\nthan remand it.\nAnd here they're not asking the South Carolina\ncourts to do anything that they don't normally do. If a\n-- a matter is --\nQUESTION: Well, they're asking the South\nCarolina courts to grant relief in a case that is outside\nthe statute of limitations. I take it they don't -- the\nSouth Carolina courts don't normally do that.\nMR. PECK: South Carolina courts, as -- as we\ncited in the -- the Hilton Head and Moriarty decisions,\nhas said that they will sometimes waive the statute of\nlimitations in the interest of justice.\nAnother instance in which they waive that issue\nis when venue has been misapplied. When -- when they\ndemand that venue be placed in one particular place, you\nfile in that wrong place, the statute of limitations\nexpires before that court acts on it, they say it has\njurisdiction to transfer it to the proper venue.\nQUESTION: Well, would this case come out\ndifferently in the State? Supposing Georgia, a\nneighboring State, had no such waiver. Would this case\ncome out differently there?\nMR. PECK: I don't think so, and the reason I\ndon't think so is because when all that is left in the\nFederal court is a matter that is otherwise a State-based\nclaim, that Federal court sits as just another court of\nthat jurisdiction, another court within that State's\nsystem. And for that reason -- for that reason, it ought\nto be treated, when Congress so authorizes -- and\nCongress, exercising that Article III, that necessary and\nproper powers that it had, utilizing the Supremacy Clause,\nauthorizes that this be treated essentially by tolling as\nmeeting the statute of limitations.\nThey have the right to define the meaning of\nwhat the Federal law is here, and that is simply what\nthey've done. They've done it by adopting a tolling\nprovision that is not unlike other tolling provisions\nthroughout the law.\nthey've done something that they have the authority to do.\nTolling comports completely with the federalist\ndesign of the Constitution, enables the court's\nconsideration of what court is best positioned to\nadjudicate. That is decidedly a jurisdictional decision.\nHere -- and it's -- and it -- it is doing that by allowing\nthe courts to control their own borders of what is\nappropriate to them and what is not.\nQUESTION: I thought the South Carolina Supreme\nCourt agreed that as far as the Federal courts are\nconcerned, this is all fine. So it was necessary to spare\nthe Federal courts having to sit on a case that no longer\nhas a Federal element. That's fine. It serves a\nlegitimate Federal purpose.\nBut, says South Carolina, you can't -- it isn't\nproper to tell us then -- they can dump it. That's fine.\nThey can't tell us that we have to pick it up.\nMR. PECK: That is indeed what they've said.\nBut Stewart v. Kahn says otherwise.\nQUESTION: That was a -- that was a Civil War\ntolling of the statute of limitations.\nMR. PECK: That is correct. It found that\nwithin the war power, Congress had the authority to toll\nthe statute of limitations in a State action brought in\nState court.\noverlay that prevents the use of that war powers\nauthority.\nHere they have similar authority, both in\nArticle I, section 8, to establish the inferior courts, as\nwell as Article III where there's a cognate phrase, and\nthat authority has to be equivalent. They've used that\nauthority also with respect to bankruptcy, again deriving\nfrom section 8.\nAnd so here again there's no question that these\nother tolling provisions have been properly used. No one\nhas questioned their constitutionality in recent times,\nand this simply adopts a longstanding congressional\napproach to this issue. It's one that this Court has\npreviously approved.\nIf -- if the respondent has his way, enormous\nmischief will result. You leave the courts with a\nHobbesian choice, a choice that they have been\nuncomfortable with in which you've seen courts granting\nmotions for reconsideration, courts requiring waivers of a\nstatute of limitations, so having much the same effect --\nand clearly when tolling does that, it is clearly\nappropriate to the judicial power -- and in other\ninstances, simply holding onto a case they would otherwise\nallow the State courts to do, again in the interest of the\nfederalist overlay in our Constitution.\nQUESTION: Well -- well, isn't it -- if --\nsuppose you should not prevail here. Well, then you just\nbring -- the plaintiff would bring two actions, bring --\nbring a protective action in the State court within the\nstatute of limitations and then that would solve the\nproblem, wouldn't it?\nMR. PECK: But that -- that's an unworkable\nsolution. Congress sought to avoid that. Congress wanted\nto give a Federal forum capable of hearing all matters\nthat a plaintiff would expect a single court to hear. And\nby filing a protective action of that sort, first of all,\nyou could not stop the State court from continuing to\nproceed, possibly eclipsing in speed the Federal court and\ncoming up with res judicata on their Federal claim, as\nwell as the fact that you may be signaling the Federal\ncourt that on the State matter we have a preference to be\nin State court when that really isn't the case.\nI -- I would -- if there are no further\nquestions, I would like to reserve the rest of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Peck.\nMr. Lamken, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. LAMKEN\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS INTERVENOR\nMR. LAMKEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe tolling provision at issue here is within\nCongress' constitutional powers for two reasons.\nFirst, it establishes the legal effect of a\ndistinctly Federal set of events: the filing, pendency,\nand dismissal of an action in Federal court over a\ndefendant over whom the court can exercise jurisdiction.\nSecond, it serves legitimate Federal interests,\nensuring that if plaintiffs are held harmless for having\nselected a Federal forum in the first instance and\nensuring that Federal courts are not required to exercise\njurisdiction and decide cases that involve potentially\nsensitive issues of State law that are more reliably and\nmore appropriately decided in the State court.\nBecause municipalities are not States or arms of\nthe States, sovereign immunity does not prevent them from\nbeing hailed into Federal court and it doesn't prevent the\nFederal courts from exercising jurisdiction over cases\nagainst them, including supplemental State law claims.\nCongress can establish the rules for when\nFederal courts should hear such claims and the rules for\nwhen they should not. Congress has corresponding\nauthority to establish reasonable rules about the legal\nconsequences of the pendency of the Federal action, of the\nfiling of the claim, its pendency, and the court's\ndecision to dismiss it under specified rules that Congress\nitself has established.\nThe rule established here falls within the\ntradition of Federal control over the effect of Federal\nproceedings. It falls in the tradition of, for example,\nlegal effect of the filing of a bankruptcy petition which\nstays all the actions that are against the debtor and\ntolls the State limitations periods during the pendency of\nthe automatic stay.\nOr the removal provision which takes cases out\nof State courts, stays the proceedings in State courts,\nand thus prevents the State courts from proceeding in a\nway such as by deeming the case constructively dismissed\nthat might have the effect of causing the statute of\nlimitations to continue to run.\nAnd the effect of a Federal -- a judgment of a\nFederal court case.\nAll these are matters that are controlled by\nFederal law, and that Federal law is no less binding on\nState courts adjudicating State causes of action,\nincluding against municipalities, than they are on Federal\ncourts.\nThe rule in this case serves twin Federal\ninterests.\nFirst, it holds plaintiffs harmless for having\nselected a forum -- a State -- excuse me -- a Federal\nrather than a State forum in the first instance. Absent\nthis sort of rule, plaintiffs would face the risk, if they\nchose a Federal forum, of having the statute of\nlimitations run on their State law claims. If the Federal\ncourt then chose to dismiss, those State law claims would\nbe barred. And plaintiffs would have an artificial\nincentive to avoid Federal court, including for the\nassertion of their Federal law claims.\nIt also serves the interests of Federal courts\nin ensuring that they don't have to decide State law\nclaims that are potentially sensitive, that under the\nstandards this Court articulated in Gibbs that Congress\nhas codified in section 1367(c) and it reflects sensible\nnotions of division between State and Federal authority\nmore appropriately belong in State court and can be more\nreliably adjudicated there.\nThis Court's decision in Stewart v. Kahn\nestablishes that there is no constitutional impediment to\ncongressional preemption of State tolling rules if it\nserves a legitimate Federal interest, the tolling\nprovision here, like the social -- excuse me -- like the\nSoldiers' and Sailors' Relief Act, the bankruptcy\nautomatic stay tolling rule, following that tradition.\nFinally, the tolling rule here intrudes only\nmodestly on State interests.\nState claims in Federal court serves all of the statute of\nlimitations purposes as the claim -- as the timely filing\nof those same claims in State court.\nAccordingly, we ask that the judgment of the\nState supreme court be reversed.\nIf there are no further questions.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Lamken.\nMr. Lindemann, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW F. LINDEMANN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. LINDEMANN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nBy enacting section 1367(d), Congress has\nintruded on principles of State sovereignty. This case\ninvolves more than just the tolling of a State law statute\nof limitations. It involves, in this particular instance\nwhere a political subdivision is involved and South\nCarolina law is involved, specifically the South Carolina\nTort Claims Act -- this case involves a -- a waiver of\nState law sovereign immunity, State law governmental\nimmunity.\nQUESTION: What about examples cited by the\nrepresentative of the Solicitor General of the Soldiers'\nand Sailors' Civil Relief Act and other Federal laws that\nhave a similar effect on South Carolina and other States?\nMR. LINDEMANN: Well, I would submit to the\nCourt that, first of all, the issue has never come up,\nnever been litigated in this Court, and as far as I'm\naware, has never been litigated in any court whether or\nnot the Soldiers' and Sailors' Act in any application is\n-- is constitutional.\nQUESTION: Okay. So you think, as far as you're\nconcerned, it would be the same problem and the same\nresult.\nMR. LINDEMANN: No, I do not necessarily believe\nit will be the same result. I believe it would be a much\nmore difficult question for this Court than what was\nfacing the South Carolina Supreme Court and is presently\nbefore this Court.\nQUESTION: Why?\nMR. LINDEMANN: Because you have different\nFederal interests that are involved. And obviously, in\ndetermining whether or not the -- a statute is proper\nunder the Necessary and Proper Clause and to do a Tenth\nAmendment analysis, you have to look at -- you have to\nweigh the various Federal and State interests that are\ninvolved.\nIn this particular case, which I'll elaborate\nmore momentarily, you have very superficial, I would\nsubmit, Federal interests involved compared to a very\nsubstantial State interest of determining whether or not\nthe State and its political subdivisions are subject to\nsuit under State law.\nQUESTION: But is it not -- is it not correct --\nis it not correct that the intrusion on State sovereignty\n-- forget the Federal side of the balance for a moment --\nthe intrusion on State sovereignty is precisely the same\nunder all these other statutes?\nMR. LINDEMANN: I would disagree, Justice\nStevens.\nQUESTION: Why is the intrusion in the Soldiers'\nand Sailors' Civil Relief Act any different than this one?\nMR. LINDEMANN: The Soldiers' and Sailors' Act\n-- it would be a very similar intrusion on the -- on the\nState sovereignty.\nQUESTION: And how about the bankruptcy statute?\nMR. LINDEMANN: The bankruptcy -- the actual --\nany -- any of these statutes that have been cited by the\npetitioners and by the Government that actually provide\nfor a stay of a State court action I think are\nsubstantially different because I would submit to the\nCourt that a stay of a State court action, whether it's\npursuant to the Bankruptcy Code, pursuant to the removal\nstatutes, any of -- Anti-Injunction Act, any of those does\nnot have the same effect upon State sovereignty because\nit's not changing the actual liability of the defendant,\nin this particular case, Richland --\nQUESTION: Well, neither does this statute\nchange the liability. It just preserves the cause of\naction.\nMR. LINDEMANN: I --\nQUESTION: Just like the Soldiers' and Sailors'\nstatute.\nMR. LINDEMANN: I -- I would respectfully\ndisagree, Justice Stevens, because what has occurred in\nthis particular case is Richland County was entitled to\nState law sovereign immunity once 2 years passed from the\ndate of the loss. And at -- at the point that this\nlawsuit was filed in State court --\nQUESTION: Wouldn't it be entitled to sovereign\nimmunity if a sailor had -- had sued them too?\nMR. LINDEMANN: Well, that's why I was trying to\ndistinguish the stay cases from the Soldiers' and Sailors'\nAct. I think the Soldiers' and Sailors' Act issue is a\nmuch closer question and there what you're weighing is\nmuch more substantial Federal interests.\nQUESTION: I'm -- I'm just looking at it from\nthe State's point of view in the point of my questions.\nIt did not seem to me that the State interest in it being\nimmune was any different in any of those situations.\nMR. LINDEMANN: Well, I would -- I would submit\nthat there is no difference in the Soldiers' and Sailors'\ncontext, but there would be a major difference in any of\nthe situations involving a stay.\nQUESTION: Mr. Lindemann, I don't -- I don't see\nwhat difference it makes that the statute of limitations\nin this case was applied to -- to what you call State\nsovereign immunity. That is, you -- you acknowledge that\nthis entity, Richmond -- Richland County, was -- was not\nentitled to sovereign immunity as we know it under Federal\nlaw.\nMR. LINDEMANN: That's correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: But you're saying that the State\nwished to confer upon Richland County a shorter statute of\nlimitations for suit against it than -- than this Federal\nstatute permits.\nWhy is that any -- any different from applying\nthe same statute against South Carolina's determination\nthat a private individual should not be suable after 2\nyears? What difference does it make whether -- whether\nthe person being affected by it is a private individual or\nRichland County? So long as it's not the State of South\nCarolina, Federal sovereign immunity law is not -- is not\nat issue. What do we care?\nMR. LINDEMANN:\ncase involving the Eleventh Amendment.\nQUESTION: Exactly.\nMR. LINDEMANN: This is not a case that is\ninvolving Federal constitutional immunity.\nQUESTION: Exactly.\nMR. LINDEMANN: This is a case that was brought\n-- a negligence case that was brought in State court\nagainst a State governmental -- or a local governmental\nentity in the State of South Carolina to which South\nCarolina law should apply. And the reason why we contend\nthat this violates the Tenth Amendment is it intrudes into\nthe areas of State sovereignty to determine, number one,\nwhat South Carolina law provides; number two, how South\nCarolina law determines whether or not their own\ngovernmental entities are subject to suit.\nQUESTION: But, Mr. Lindemann, one of the\ncuriosities about this case is if the Federal court, once\nthe Federal claim dropped out, decided that it would clean\n-- clean up the operation, it would keep it in Federal\ncourt, there would be a Federal court adjudicating South\nCarolina's State law case. The only regulating rules\nwould be State rules. And South Carolina says, that's\nokay with us. They can take our law into the Federal\ncourt and apply it there and -- but we don't want it back.\nIn other words, we want to force our cases to be litigated\ninto -- in the Federal court. And that doesn't make a\nwhole lot of sense.\nMR. LINDEMANN: Well, it's not as much that\nthey're trying to force the Federal court to litigate the\ncase. Obviously, the plaintiff chose that forum to start\nwith. And Congress has deemed -- has provided for\nsupplemental jurisdiction. So obviously Congress has\nprovided a forum in Federal court for the litigation of\nthese State law claims. And so South Carolina has not\nsaid, you can't give it back to us, but what South\nCarolina had said is that in the interim, if there's a\ndismissal without prejudice of the State law claims in\nanother court, whether it be the Federal district court or\nwhether it be in a court of another State, if there's a\ndismissal without prejudice under South Carolina law,\nthat's considered as if the suit had never been brought in\nthe first place.\nQUESTION: In other words, you're saying it's\nall right with us if the Federal court adjudicates this\npurely State claim. The State isn't offended by that, but\nit is offended by getting it back even though everyone had\nnotice in ample time within the -- the county had ample\nnotice because they received a Federal summons and\ncomplaint. So there was no question of -- of repose\ninvolved.\nBut there's one -- another aspect of this, it\nseems to me, passing strange. Are you suggesting that the\nremoval statute would be vulnerable to a similar attack?\nBecause that's really -- if you're talking about State\ncourt, this is wrenching a case out of the State court,\nousting the State court of jurisdiction, putting it into\nthe Federal court. I would think if you're right about\nsending it back, then you'd certainly object to lifting it\nout.\nMR. LINDEMANN: I don't believe the interest\nhere is that South Carolina has a problem with -- with the\nFederal court deciding issues of State law, and I don't\nthink South Carolina has a problem with deciding those\nissues itself. The problem South Carolina has in this\nparticular case is with Congress expanding upon State law\nthat actually set the boundaries as to when and how a\npolitical subdivision can be sued.\nQUESTION: What difference does it make whether\nit's a political subdivision or not? Suppose South\nCarolina law said, gas stations shall be immune from suit\nexcept that you can sue them within two years, and then\nthe same situation occurs. Would -- would not the Federal\ncourt be intruding upon South Carolina's decision of\nimmunity just as much?\nMR. LINDEMANN:\nbe intruding upon --\nQUESTION: So -- so --\nMR. LINDEMANN: -- the ability of the State of\nSouth Carolina to set a statute of limitations for private\ndefendants.\nQUESTION: That's -- and that's all we're\ntalking about, to set a statute of limitations whether\nit's for private defendants or whether it's for Richland\nCounty which, as far as Federal law is concerned, is a\nprivate defendant, or whether it's for gas stations.\nI mean, I -- you -- you try to make something\ndifferent of this case by saying what it involves in -- is\nRichland County, but what we, the Federal courts, say is\nRichland County is not the State of South Carolina. It is\nnot a State entity, and as far as we're concerned, it's a\ngas station.\nMR. LINDEMANN: But I would submit to the Court\ntwo points in response to that. It goes beyond because\nit's a governmental entity and you look at the application\nof State law because again, this is a State law case\nbrought and adjudicated in a State court. And you look at\nthe State law which actually provides a greater defense\nfor a governmental entity than it does for a private\ncitizen.\nTo give the Court an illustration --\nQUESTION: You would have no --\nQUESTION: You give greater defenses for gas\nstations. Would -- would that change the gas station case\nsimply because you give greater defenses to gas stations?\nMR. LINDEMANN: No, it would not change the\ncase.\nQUESTION: Of course not.\nMR. LINDEMANN: My point is it -- it actually\nmakes a stronger case to show the intrusion on State\nsovereignty where you have a political subdivision.\nAnd if I may illustrate. Prior to 1985, South\nCarolina recognized absolute sovereign immunity for its\nState entities as well as its political subdivisions. And\nif you looked at -- the question that comes to mind is\nwhether Congress, prior to 1985, could have enacted a\nstatute that subjects Richland County, a political\nsubdivision in the State of South Carolina, to a claim for\nnegligence in the operation of its local detention center\nwhere South Carolina law itself provides there is no such\nclaim because of sovereign immunity.\nQUESTION: The answer is, of course, they could\nif they had a -- if there is a basis in the Constitution\nfor the Federal Government to pass a law that changes\nState law. They do it every day of the week.\nAnd so usually what you ask is, is there a basis\nhere? Of course, there is. They say Article III.\nIndeed, was there a problem Congress was trying\nto cure? Indeed, there is. It was the mess that existed\nbefore the statute.\nIs there an infringement of what the State would\nlike to do? Of course, there is but the Constitution\ngives the power to the Federal Government to do that.\nNow -- now, what's -- that -- like, you know,\npurely I'd say hornbook. So what -- what is the -- what\nis the special thing about this infringement of the\nState's power to do what it would like to do here?\nMR. LINDEMANN: I respectfully disagree with\nyou, Justice Breyer. If, prior to 1985, Congress wanted\nto create a situation where Richland County would be\nliable for the operation of its detention center, it would\nhave to do so in the context of a Federal cause of action\nwhich obviously existed at that time under section 1983.\nWhat I'm saying is --\nQUESTION: So Congress in your opinion doesn't\nhave the power to -- to interfere with State law insofar\nas it creates State laws of action? Congress couldn't\npass tort reform, for example.\nMR. LINDEMANN: Well, I believe tort reform in\ncertain instances would be permissible. I -- I believe\nthat -- and certainly the -- the precedent set by this\nCourt supports this -- that Congress has the authority\nthrough preemption and through its properly enacted\nstatutes to limit the liability in State court actions --\nin State law actions, but cannot create liability where\nnone existed previously. And I'd submit to the Court that\nI'm not aware of any single example where Congress has\nstepped in and created a statute that creates a -- a State\nlaw cause of action or expands upon a State law cause of\naction to create liability where none existed.\nQUESTION: Except the Soldiers' and Sailors'\nRelief Act, for example.\nMR. LINDEMANN: Well, and the Soldiers' and\nSailors' Relief Act, if it is indeed constitutional, is\nbased upon a different weighing of the Federal interest\nversus the State interest. You obviously in that case\nhave much greater Federal interest involved than the\nsimple convenience to litigants to have to be able to be\n-- have the ability to file your Federal and State claims\nin the same Federal action without concern that your State\naction might ultimately be dismissed after the statute of\nlimitations ran.\nObviously the Soldiers' and Sailors' Act\ninvolves First Amendment war powers. It involves issues\nof national defense and deployment of armed services\naround the country where they're not available to -- where\nthey don't have the immediate availability of access to\nour court system. Those are much different rights, much\ndifferent Federal interests, and would create a much\ndifferent issue. And how this Court would ultimately\nresolve that issue I cannot say, but it would certainly\nmake a much stronger case for allowing that than the\nsimple case that is -- or the Federal interests that are\nat stake in this particular instance.\nThe --\nQUESTION: If we went back to the old ways, is\nthere any unconstitutionality in one of the things that\nwas done? And the Federal judge will say, yeah, this is\nreally State business, but I'm not going to subject the\nplaintiff to a time bar. So, defendant, Richland County,\nany defendant, would you agree that you will waive the\nstatute of limitations should I dismiss this case without\nprejudice. The -- the -- the State -- the county\ncertainly could do that.\nMR. LINDEMANN: That -- that happened frequently\nprior to 1990, and I'm actually aware of -- personally of\ninstances even since 1990 where that's been the case --\nQUESTION: And how about bringing --\nMR. LINDEMANN: -- and that obviously is the\nsolution.\nQUESTION:\naction and says, I really want this 1983 claim to be the\nfront runner, but if I fail on that, I want to have these\ngarden variety State -- whatever it is -- assault cases.\nSo the plaintiff begins a State -- a case in State court\nand the State tort claims, the Federal case, including the\n1983 claim.\nMR. LINDEMANN: That's right.\nQUESTION: Then that would be perfectly all\nright.\nMR. LINDEMANN: That would be perfectly all\nright, and in fact --\nQUESTION: And all that accomplishes is having\ntwo cases instead of one, which is if -- if that can be\navoided, it's -- for the efficiency of the system, it's a\npretty good idea, isn't it?\nMR. LINDEMANN: But realistically looking at the\nway 1367(d) operates anyway is you often do have two\nseparate lawsuits such as what we have in this particular\ninstance.\nQUESTION: But that's what 1367(d) was meant to\novercome I thought, having two lawsuits going on, just to\nhave the -- the State court sitting there and nothing\nhappening in the event that the Federal court should\ndismiss the Federal claim and there's a live lawsuit to\npick up.\nMR. LINDEMANN: There are many different\nalternatives that courts dealt with this issue prior to\n1990. And in fact, I'd submit that there's certainly no\nauthority to support any finding or any conclusion that\nlitigants' due process rights were violated before 1367(d)\nwas enacted.\nQUESTION: No. It wasn't necessary to\nlitigants. It's just that your solution to the problem\npermits the two parties who want to try their case in\nFederal court to confer a jurisdiction on the Federal\ncourt that the district judge believes it doesn't have and\ndoesn't want.\nMR. LINDEMANN: Well, and -- and that is true.\nQUESTION: So from a point of view of protecting\nthe State, I guess Congress dived into this mess. I -- I\nwrote an opinion. You might -- to recall it to mind, it\nhappened to involve a plagiarism. Did you read -- I had a\n1st Circuit case. It involved plagiarism of an Icelandic\npoet called Franjen Gendulik.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. LINDEMANN: I'm not aware of that --\nQUESTION: And in that -- you're not aware of\nthat. Well, if you don't -- that doesn't call it to\nmind --\nQUESTION:\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: But the poem was Suze Sine Razmut\nNogot.\nIn any case, the -- the point was at the end of\nthat it seemed like a terrible mess. There seemed like\nfive solutions. Each of them had something to be said for\nit, and so Congress went in to legislate in order to deal\nwith this procedural mess.\nNow -- now, why isn't that a legitimate interest\njust as legitimate as the interest in protecting soldiers\nand sailors, the interest that underlies lots of other\nFederal legislation?\nMR. LINDEMANN: Well, I would submit to Your\nHonor that that is certainly not a very substantial\nFederal interest to the extent it is a Federal interest.\nQUESTION: To deal with a problem of unfairness\nto States, unfairness to litigants, try to have a uniform\nrule?\nMR. LINDEMANN: Well, I don't believe it -- it\ncreates unfairness necessary to litigants, and there are\nobviously solutions around it -- and was dealt with by --\nmany courts dealt with this particular issue prior to\n1990. And I would submit that when you balance that\nFederal interest with the State interests that are\ninvolved here and -- which is obviously what -- what's the\nanalysis under the Tenth Amendment, that the result should\nbe that the State interests involved to be able to control\nState law and State law claims, to be able to control when\nand how State -- States and their political subdivisions\nare subject to suit under State law, that those interests\nfar outweigh the Federal interest. Obviously it is a\nbalancing problem.\nQUESTION: Isn't -- isn't one of the questions\nwho should do the balancing? Should we do it or should\nCongress do it?\nMR. LINDEMANN: Well --\nQUESTION: Doesn't Congress normally make this\nkind of policy decision?\nMR. LINDEMANN: Well, I believe in this --\nQUESTION: And the branch of the Federal\nGovernment that makes this kind of policy decision.\nMR. LINDEMANN: Well, there -- there's clearly\nno -- no legislative history that suggests that Congress\nmade that particular balancing. In fact, there's nothing\nin the legislative history --\nQUESTION: No, but I assume the State of South\nCarolina was represented in Congress at the time they made\nthat decision and could be -- could raise all these\nobjections in that forum.\nMR. LINDEMANN:\nCourt that just as this Court ruled in the Raygor case\nlast term in the Tenth Amendment context, just like in the\nEleventh Amendment context --\nQUESTION: The Eleventh Amendment was really\nimplicated there.\nMR. LINDEMANN: -- you have to look at whether\nor not there's a clear statement that Congress intended to\naffect Federal-State relations such as it did.\nQUESTION: No, but I think the clear statement\nrule is limited to States, and of course, counties are not\nconsidered the same as States.\nMR. LINDEMANN: Well, I would -- I would submit\nto the Court that if -- if Your Honor is suggesting that\nonly comes into play in Eleventh Amendment cases, that --\nthat -- I would disagree with that because Gregory versus\nAshcroft was a Tenth Amendment case and this Court ruled\nbased upon the clear statement rule.\nNow, whether or not a party has standing to\nassert --\nQUESTION: Was that -- was that a -- an\nimmunity --\nQUESTION: That was State officials.\nQUESTION: -- official -- an officer immunity\ncase?\nMR. LINDEMANN: That was a case.\nADEA case, Your Honor, looking at the qualifications of\nState judges in the State of Missouri.\nQUESTION: But the difference is that the State\nis not amenable to suit in Federal court. The\nmunicipality is just like any other corporation. So --\nMR. LINDEMANN: I don't disagree with that.\nThat's why we are not pursuing this matter under the\nEleventh Amendment. However, a municipality has standing\nto assert a challenge under the Tenth Amendment, and this\nCourt in the Printz case, Printz v. United States, was\nactually --\nQUESTION: It's not a kind of jurisdictional\nchallenge. I mean, the State -- if the State were sued in\nFederal court and there was a pending claim, the State\nwould say you -- we don't fit under 1367(a), and the State\nnot there at all. But here this claim is properly brought\nin Federal court against the city. Is that right?\nMR. LINDEMANN: That -- that's correct, Your\nHonor.\nQUESTION: So it seems to me there's a very\nlarge difference in that respect.\nMR. LINDEMANN: We -- we are certainly not\narguing that 1367(d) is unconstitutional as applied to --\nI mean, (a) is unconstitutional as applied to Richland\nCounty.\nState law statute of limitations and the limited waiver of\nsovereign immunity under State law is what, as applied in\nthis particular case, violates the Tenth Amendment.\nQUESTION: I can see in the abstract what your\nargument is, but in the concrete, let's take the removal\ncase. So there's a case lodged in State court. It's\nlifted up, put into Federal court, and then more than 2\nyears later, it gets remanded. Practically what's the\ndifference in terms of South Carolina and its concern with\nstale claims between those two cases?\nMR. LINDEMANN: Well, Your Honor, obviously a\nremoval situation is substantially different in that\njurisdiction was first lodged in the State court, and as a\nresult, any type of waiver issue or any type of statute of\nlimitations issue would be resolved by the fact that there\nwas a initial filing of the State court claim in State\ncourt.\nQUESTION: But functionally I don't see any\nsignificant difference if the concern is we don't want\nstale claims. We don't want to adjudicate claims that\nhave been hanging around more than two years. In my case,\nyes, you touched base in Federal -- in State court. What\nyou got was what you got in Federal court, that is, notice\nthat the plaintiff is suing arising out of this particular\nepisode.\nState's -- the State is trying to protect its concern for\nadjudicating stale claims. The claim is still stale when\nit comes back from the Federal court.\nMR. LINDEMANN: It's not so -- as Your Honor\npointed out earlier, it's not solely an issue of repose\nbecause here because the respondent, the defendant in the\n-- in the underlying case is a governmental entity, there\nis a aspect of State sovereign immunity that comes into\nplay that doesn't come into play in -- in the other\ninstances. And so you have the added interest of\npreserving the right of the State in order to determine\nwhether it's going to waive its sovereign immunity, which\nof course didn't happen until 1985, and when it does waive\nsovereign immunity, the extent to which it's going to\nwaive it. And again, I'm referring to State law sovereign\nimmunity, not Federal constitutional immunity under the\nEleventh Amendment or otherwise. So what --\nQUESTION: I understand that. I just don't\nunderstand why you think we should -- we should care.\nMR. LINDEMANN: Well --\nQUESTION: If you're not talking about Federal\nsovereign immunity of the State, why should we care if --\nif the State chooses to create some other kind of\nsovereign immunity that -- that isn't the kind that we're\nconcerned about?\nMR. LINDEMANN: Because it goes, Your Honor, to\nthe heart of exactly what the -- the State sovereignty,\nthe interests of State sovereignty that's involved in this\ncase.\nQUESTION: No, it doesn't. No, it doesn't. The\n-- the essence of State sovereignty is everything covered\nby Federal State sovereign immunity which is States and\nagencies of States. Everything else is not central to\nState sovereignty, whether -- whether they choose to make\nRichland County a -- you know, give them some State\nsovereignty protection or -- or choose to make a gas\nstation that way.\nI don't -- I just don't understand why you\nexpect this to impress us, that the State has gone beyond\nFederal State sovereign immunity and created some new\nelement of State sovereign immunity. I mean, they're --\nthey're free to do that, but I don't see how it invokes\nany new doctrine under either the Eleventh Amendment or\nthe Tenth Amendment or any other provision of Federal law.\nMR. LINDEMANN: Well, I'm not submitting that it\ncreates any type of new doctrine, Your Honor. What I'm\nsuggesting is that it's an aspect of State sovereignty for\na State court -- I mean, for a State legislature to\ndetermine what the law is in that State that is applicable\npurely to State law claims litigated in a State court.\nQUESTION: Okay. Why isn't the answer then\nnecessarily the same whether we have a private litigant or\nwhether we have a -- a political subdivision? They said\nfor the private litigants, two year statute of\nlimitations. Why isn't your answer exactly the same? The\nState was exercising the State's -- the same sovereign\npower in each case.\nMR. LINDEMANN: Well, I believe it would also\napply to a private litigant, and I didn't try to convey to\nthe Court --\nQUESTION: Okay. I -- I hadn't understood that\nwas your position.\nMR. LINDEMANN: What I'm trying to suggest to\nthe Court is because you have this added element of State\nlaw sovereign immunity, which is created by a State\nconstitution, it makes it even a more compelling Tenth\nAmendment --\nQUESTION: But you don't -- you don't need it.\nYou don't need it. The private litigant doesn't have any\nsovereign immunity rights under State law, but the private\nlitigant would be able to insist on the two-year statute\njust the way the county is insisting on it here.\nMR. LINDEMANN: I believe that would be the\ncase. Now, that's not the issue, obviously, before this\nCourt and that's not decided by the South Carolina Supreme\nCourt. The South Carolina Supreme Court decided this case\nin a very limited fashion and found that 1367(d) as\napplied to political subdivisions in South Carolina, given\nthe South Carolina Tort Claims Act and the history of\nsovereign immunity -- State law sovereign immunity in that\nState, that as a result, as applied to Richland County,\nit's unconstitutional.\nQUESTION: Suppose a judge should say -- the\nFederal judge -- knowing South Carolina's position on this\nquestion, I'll keep the case, which is now an entirely\nState case, and I know that in diversity cases I'm\nsupposed to apply the State statute of limitations. So if\nthe Federal judge keeps this case in deference to South\nCarolina's position that it doesn't want it, it's too\nlate, and the Federal court in a diversity case must apply\nthe State statute of limitations, when -- when does that\nlimitation begin, when South Carolina said it would if the\ncase were reinstituted there?\nMR. LINDEMANN: No, Your Honor. I would -- I\nwould submit that the statute of limitations started to --\nor ran from obviously the date of loss through -- through\nfor the two-year period, and if the case was filed in\nFederal court within that two-year period, the statute of\nlimitations, as well as the -- the argument that sovereign\nimmunity applies, would not be applicable to that case.\nBut what occurred in this case is there was a\ndismissal without prejudice of the State law claims.\nUnder South Carolina law, a dismissal with prejudice is\ntreated as if the suit was never brought in the first\nplace. And as a result, when the case was refiled in the\nState court, it was refiled beyond the two years, at which\npoint the statute of limitations had run and at which\npoint Richland County was also entitled to absolute\nimmunity under the South Carolina Tort Claims Act.\nAnd I would again submit to the Court that the\nreason why we believe that this is a significant issue\nunder the Tenth Amendment for this case and why the\nEleventh Amendment jurisprudence of this Court does not\ngovern is -- is because of the importance of the State law\ninterest. And the key to this whole argument is the point\nthat this is not a Federal claim litigated in Federal\ncourt. In fact, the cases that have been cited by the\npetitioner in their briefs, the Burnett case, the Order of\nRailroad Engineers case, all of those cases are\ndistinguishable because those are Federal causes of action\nthat are litigated in Federal court.\nThis is a State law claim that's litigated in\nState court under purely State law, and we would submit\nthat the South Carolina General Assembly should decide\nwhat is the applicable South Carolina law and that\nCongress does not have the power under Article III and the\nNecessary and Proper Clause to override that statement of\nState law and to create liability where no liability\npreviously existed. And that is the key point.\nCongress has the authority through a validly\nenacted statute and through use of the Supremacy Clause to\nlimit liability in State actions by providing for\npreemption, ERISA being an example, but there is no\nexample that I'm aware of where Congress has created\nliability where none previously existed.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Lindemann.\nMR. LINDEMANN: Thank you, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Mr. Peck, you have 4 minutes\nremaining.\nMR. PECK: If the Court has no further\nquestions, I would ask that the Supreme Court of South\nCarolina be reversed and would waive rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Peck.\n"
