Italian Colors Restaurant.\nMr. Kellogg.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL KELLOGG\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. KELLOGG: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThe court below thrice refused to enforce\nthe parties' arbitration agreement because he thought\nthat class procedures were necessary to vindicate the\nplaintiff's Sherman Act claims.\nThat holding was reversible error for at\nleast three reasons. First, it has no basis in either\nthe FAA or the Sherman Act. Second, it creates an\nunworkable threshold inquiry. And third, it is\nunnecessary to any legitimate policy concerns raised by\nthe court below.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kellogg, suppose it\ngoes to arbitration as you think it should, and the\narbitrator says to the merchant, to prove your case, you\nhave to show the relevant market, you have to show that\nAmerican Express had market power, that it used that\npower to the detriment of its competitors, and the way\nthese sections -- the way these tying cases have gone\nis you get an expert. And I don't see that you can\nprove it in -- in a new way.\nI mean, the whole point of this is that the\nexpense to win one of these cases is enormous. And no\nsingle person is not worth that person's while.\nMR. KELLOGG: Well, three responses to that,\nYour Honor. The first is, that it is up to the\narbitrator in the first instance to devise procedures to\ndeal with claims in an efficient and cost-effective\nmanner.\nSecond, to the extent that an expert report\nis required that would cost a lot of money, we have\nconceded below that the parties could share costs of\nthat expert just as they could share the costs of a\nlawyer.\nAnd, third, the alternative is to have an\ninquiry upfront, that this Court has rejected in\nConcepcion, that you cannot condition the enforcement of\nan arbitration agreement on the availability of class\nprocedures.\nIt's up to --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What was the -- what was\nthe -- I missed that. The sharing of the costs, how\ndoes that work? It's certainly not in the agreement,\nnot in the arbitration agreement, that -- that American\nExpress is going to pay for the expert for the other\nside.\nMR. KELLOGG: We acknowledge below that they\ncould share costs among multiple plaintiffs --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Oh. Oh.\nMR. KELLOGG: -- before that. The sharing\nof costs. Now, under the court below's regime --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And then what you would\nyou have, five, six different arbitrations going, and in\neach of those five or six cases, you would have -- they\ncould share? They could share the million dollar cost\nof this -- the experts?\nMR. KELLOGG: They can share the cost of the\nexpert. And, of course, they get their attorneys' fees\nback, plus reasonable statutory costs, plus potentially\ntreble damages.\nThe alternative, as the court below held, is\nthat the district court has to decide in the first\ninstance, I'm not going to send it to arbitration\nbecause I think they need a class action. To make that\ndetermination, he first has to do a Rule 23 analysis.\nWould there even be a class certified in this case?\nOnly 20 percent of putative classes are\ncertified. And that's not an inquiry that the Court\nshould be making at the outset.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I -- I'm sorry, but I\ndon't think I got the answer to my question. Is -- the\narbitrator has now said we have to have an expert, and\nthe plaintiff says -- or the complainant says, I haven't\ngot the wherewithal, and if I have six friends who bring\nindividual arbitrations, that's not nearly enough.\nSo what happens then, the case ends, and\nit's not possible --\nMR. KELLOGG: As we said, they would be able\nto share an expert between multiple plaintiffs, but\nthere is no guarantee in the law that every claim has a\nprocedural path to its effective vindication.\nThis Court held in Eisen, for example, even\nthough the Court acknowledged that it was a $70 claim,\nit could only be brought as a class action, but the\nplaintiff in that case said, I can't afford to do the\nnotice costs, and the Court said well, then, the class\nis decertified because the plaintiff has to put up the\nnotice.\nThe whole point of arbitration of course is\nthat it expands the universe of claims that can be\nbrought efficiently and effectively for small consumers.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Kellogg, do you think\nthat if in your arbitration agreement you had a clause\nwhich just said, I hereby agree not to bring any Sherman\nAct claim against American Express, could -- could your\narbitration agreement do that?\nMR. KELLOGG: Under this Court's decision in\nMitsubishi, I believe not.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: It -- it couldn't,\nright because we would say no, there has to be an -- an\nopportunity for a vindication of statutory rights, is\nthat right?\nMR. KELLOGG: Correct.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And -- and suppose that the\narbitration clause said something different. Suppose\nthat the arbitration clause said, I -- I hereby agree\nthat I will not present any economic evidence in an\nantitrust action against American Express.\nCould it do that?\nMR. KELLOGG: I think that would be subject\nto review under State unconscionability principles, and\nwould probably be struck down, Your Honor, just like any\nother provision that essentially prevents --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, even putting aside\nState unconscionability principles, wouldn't you think\nthat our Mitsubishi case and our Randolph case would\nagain come in and say, my gosh, this arbitration clause\nprevents any effective vindication of the rights to\nbring an antitrust suit.\nWouldn't you say that.\nMR. KELLOGG: I -- I don't think Mitsubishi\ncan be read that broadly, Your Honor. To the contrary,\nthe whole point of Mitsubishi was that arbitration is an\neffective forum for vindicating Federal statutory\nrights. Mitsubishi --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So you think -- I'm sorry.\nGo ahead.\nMR. KELLOGG: I'm sorry. Mitsubishi dealt\nwith the very specific question of a waiver, a\nsubstantive waiver of your rights, not with the\nprocedures to vindicate those rights.\nAs, for example, in the Vimar Seguros case,\nwhere the Court said, well, you might have to go to\nJapan, but we're not going to get into the business of\nweighing the costs and benefits.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So I just want to make sure\nI understand your answer, which is that you read\nMitsubishi and Randolph as so narrow that you would say\nthat the principle that they embody does not prevent\nAmerican Express from saying, you cannot produce -- you\ncannot use any economic expert or any economic testimony\nin an antitrust suit.\nMR. KELLOGG: You know, I think the better\nplace to handle that would be State unconscionability\nlaw. Whether the Court would want to expand the ports\nof Mitsubishi to say that.\nIt's not clear to me what the statutory\njustification for that would be, given that the Sherman\nAct -- the question here, of course, concerns class\nprocedures. And given that the Sherman Act was passed\nat a time when there were no class procedures, and given\nthat the Court in Concepcion --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, my -- my question is\nnot about class procedures, it's about allowing economic\nevidence to help prove your claim. And you said, no\nproblem, even though it is, of course, true in the real\nworld that to prove a successful antitrust claim, you\nneed economic evidence.\nMR. KELLOGG: Correct.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And you said that's\nfine because you're going to read Mitsubishi and\nRandolph in such a way that it allows an arbitration\nclause to 100 percent effectively absolutely frustrate\nyour ability to bring a Sherman Act suit.\nMR. KELLOGG: I have no doubt that such a\nprovision would be struck down. I think the proper way\nto do that would be under State unconscionability law,\nwhich Section 2 specifically preserves. But if the\nCourt felt the need to expand Mitsubishi in that narrow\nrespect, that would still not help the Respondents here,\nwho are saying that you should condition the enforcement\nof the arbitration clause on the availability of class\nprocedures, which this Court held in Concepcion is\nfundamentally inconsistent with the purposes of the FAA.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I think -- I think\nwhat they are saying is something a little bit\ndifferent, which is that if you go -- if you accept my\npremise that the arbitration clause could not say no\neconomic evidence, what the -- Respondents here are\nsaying is, well, now you have to give us the ability to\nproduce economic evidence and maybe that involves class\nprocedures, maybe it involves something else.\nIt could involve some other cost-sharing\nmechanism. But if the arbitration clause works to\nprevent us from sharing costs in such a way that we can\nproduce that evidence, then once again we have a problem\nabout completely frustrating the effect of the Sherman\nAct.\nMR. KELLOGG: Well, I think -- I think not\nYour Honor. And I think we have to return to the fact that\nthe only provision at issue here was the class action\nwaiver. That was the only issue that they raised below.\nIt was the issue decided by the Court. It was the issue\non which this Court granted certiorari, and it's\ndirectly contrary to this Court's decision in\nConcepcion.\nI have no doubt that if there were\nprovisions in a contract that essentially prevented a\nplaintiff from raising a substantive claim or from\npresenting evidence that they might have in support of\nthat claim, that it would be struck down under State\nunconscionability principles or under Mitsubishi. But I\ndon't think we can expand Mitsubishi into a\nfree-floating inquiry for district courts into the costs\nand benefits of each case.\nThey would have to sit down and say, well,\nwhat evidence is going to be needed in this case and how\nmuch evidence is going to be required. They would have\nto say, what are the document production costs?\nAccording to the court of appeals, they would even need\nto say, what are your chances of winning? Because, say\nit's going to cost a million dollars, but you only have\na 50 percent chance --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that the only thing\nthat the court of appeals said is, you have to pay\n300,000 minimum for the expert, the most you can get in\ntreble damages is 5,000. It didn't go into all the\nother things that you were saying. It said nobody in\nhis right mind will bring such a lawsuit to pay $300,000\nto get $5,000.\nMR. KELLOGG: And nobody in their right mind\nin Eisen would -- would pay a million dollars in notice\ncosts to get $70 on --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I guess you could have said\nthe same thing under the Sherman Act before Rule 23\nexisted, right?\nMR. KELLOGG: You could have.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Before there was such as\nthing as class actions.\nMR. KELLOGG: Under that position --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The same thing would have\nbeen true. If, indeed, your claim was so small that you\ncan't claim -- can't pay an expert, you, as a practical\nmatter, don't bring the suit.\nMR. KELLOGG: That was true. In fact,\nCongress at the time of passing the Sherman Act\nspecifically considered adding class procedures and\ndeclined to do so. For the first 4 decades of the\nSherman Act, there were no class procedures even left.\nEven today, in court, as I noted, only\n20 percent of cases actually get the class certified.\nThe whole point of arbitration, as I noted, is to expand\nthe scope of claims, small consumer claims, that can be\nbrought in an efficient and cost-effective manner.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do you think the nature of\ntheir underlying -- their antitrust claim is relevant to\nthis? They are claiming that they were unlawfully\ncompelled to enter into the contract that they say, as a\npractical matter, precludes them from raising the\nantitrust issue. Does that -- does it matter?\nMR. KELLOGG: Well, a couple of points on\nthat. They certainly weren't compelled to enter the\ncontract. Lots of merchants don't take American\nExpress. It was a voluntary choice on their part. But\nmore fundamentally, the only provision that they have\never challenged in this case is the class action waiver.\nThey have not suggested below that there was any problem\nwith cost-sharing or other ways that they might deal\nwith the specific question how to present their case in\narbitration.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In the AT&T Mobility\ncase, the Court remarked that this was a -- that the\narbitration agreement had certain provisions that made\nit easier for the consumer to use the arbitral forum.\nIs there anything like that in this arbitration clause?\nMR. KELLOGG: I'm sorry, I didn't -- I\ndidn't quite follow that, Your Honor. A provision in\nthe arbitration clause that makes it easier to -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, where not some other\nconsumer in another arbitration, not that sharing of the\ncosts, but wasn't AT&T Mobility going to pick up a good\npart of the tab of the cost of the arbitration?\nMR. KELLOGG: That's correct, there were\nprovisions in AT&T that the Court said would make small\nvalue claims easier to process. I would note that in\nConcepcion the Court said even if small value claims\ncould not be brought, it would still fundamentally\nchange the nature of arbitration to insist upon class\nprocedures. So I don't think that helps them in\ndistinguishing Concepcion.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: One of the ways I have\nbeen thinking about this case is to think about\narbitration and the whole point of arbitration is to\nhave a procedure where you don't have costs, you have as\nan arbitrator an antitrust expert or the best in the\nclass in the third year antitrust course in law school.\nAnd they cite reports, and -- you know, it's\nclassic to have contractors sit in as arbitrators in\nconstruction claims; just because it's cheaper and they\nknow -- so I was thinking that that's substantial\njustification for your position. But your argument so\nfar seems to say that doesn't make any difference. Even\nif they can't bring the suit in an economic way -- the\narbitration in an economic way, that that's irrelevant.\nThat's -- that's what I'm getting from your argument.\nMR. KELLOGG: I did not mean to imply that,\nYour Honor. The key point is that it's up to the\narbitrator in the first instance to find the most\nefficient and cost effective way to resolve a particular\nclaim.\nAnd it's not necessarily the case that\ncomplicated -- that huge numbers of documents --\nplaintiff said, we will need 5 million documents and we\nwill need a very, very expensive expert and they got an\naffidavit from a very, very expensive expert saying,\nthis is what I would charge to do this.\nThe whole point of arbitration, of course,\nis that its informality actually expands the universe of\nclaims, of small value claims that can be brought\neffectively.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Kellogg, are you\nsuggesting that you can win an antitrust suit in\narbitration without presenting economic evidence of such\nthings as monopoly power, antitrust injury, damages?\nHow could somebody do that?\nMR. KELLOGG: No, I acknowledge that they\nwould probably need a report in this case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why? I mean, I could be\nyour arbitrator. I know exactly what I would do. I\nwould ask for five things, which will be admitted, and\none thing that's going to be difficult for them to\nprove. I don't see why an expert in antitrust would\nhave to have this enormous report.\nMR. KELLOGG: Well, I -- perhaps I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Do you want to concede I'm wrong? --\nMR. KELLOGG: -- conceded too much to\nJustice Kagan.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, maybe.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. KELLOGG: But in this case, if you look\nat the complaint, the market definition that they're\nseeking to establish is, if I might put it, somewhat\ngerrymandered. It essentially consists --\nJUSTICE BREYER: If you want to argue that\nstuff, which I -- then I guess maybe they're right.\nMaybe you do need experts on that. I don't know that we\nwant to get into this, but I just want to know if you\nwant to concede that there is no way to win this case in\narbitration unless they spend $300,000.\nMR. KELLOGG: I did not mean to concede that\nat all, Your Honor. The whole point of arbitration is\nthe informality and the speed of the procedures.\nAnd in addition, to the extent that there\ndoes need to be some sort of safety valve, of course\nCongress can deal with that question. Congress recently\nin the Dodd-Frank Act said, in certain circumstances\nwe're going to allow the Consumer Financial Protection\nBoard to determine whether class action waivers will be\npermitted. But obviously there's nothing either in the\nFAA or in the Sherman Act that would justify such an\ninquiry here.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Kellogg, could I\ngo back to Justice Alito's point because I'm not sure I\nquite understood your -- your answer to it.\nEssentially, the claim here, right, is that this is a\nparty with a monopolistic power, such that -- and this\nis just the Plaintiff's allegation, it may or may not be\ntrue, but -- but they say that American Express is using\nits market power to impose particular contract terms.\nAnd they have a tying thing, but it could just as easily\nbe the case that American Express could be using its\neconomic power to impose terms essentially making\narbitration of antitrust claims impossible.\nAnd why shouldn't we understand this problem\nas connected to the very allegation that's being\nbrought? That -- you know, how is it, how is it going\nto be possible in a case where there's a monopoly power\nable -- able to impose contracts terms that -- that you\ncan create an arbitration clause, which essentially\nprevents that from being challenged?\nMR. KELLOGG: Well, there is a separate\nissue below which the court did not reach about whether\nthe arbitration clause itself had been improperly\nimposed. But the question before the Court has to do\nwith the class action waiver, which this Court in\nConcepcion said there's no statutory basis for the\ncourts to preclude application of that waiver.\nIt's also -- would create a completely\nunworkable inquiry at the outset of litigation in order\nto determine whether to refer a case to arbitration in\nthe first place, and it's unnecessary because State law\nunconscionability, can deal with contracts of adhesion\nor unfair terms. The arbitrator in the first instance\ncan deal with how to cost effectively arbitrate the\nclaims in issue.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Did -- did American\nExpress say, as Justice Breyer suggested, that, well we\nwill concede A, B, and C, so the only issue on which you\nneed proof is D? As I understood it, American Express\nnever took the position that it would -- it would\nconcede certain issues so that you could limit the\nproof.\nMR. KELLOGG: Well, Your Honor, we took the\nposition even in district court that they could pool\ntheir resources --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: No, I'm not\ntalking about --\nMR. KELLOGG: -- and share the cost of the\nclaim.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm not talking about\npooling with other single merchants bringing single\narbitrations. I'm asking whether American Express -- so\nhere's the complaint. It says, I have to prove relevant\nmarkets separately. And did American Express take the\nposition, no, you don't have to prove all that. I think\nthat's what Justice Breyer was suggesting. There's only\none thing that's really in controversy, and the rest we\ncould stipulate.\nBut I didn't see anything in all the time\nthis case has been in the courts on American Express's\npart to say that we are not going to demand the\nfull breadth of proof.\nMR. KELLOGG: Well, that's -- that's not\nactually correct. We did not say that we're going to\nrelieve them of their burden of proof on any issues, but\nwe did say, and the district court agreed with us, that\nthe arbitrators are capable of dealing with these claims\nin an efficient and cost-effective way that would allow\nthe plaintiffs to bring them.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I suppose that American\nExpress wouldn't have had to agree to arbitration at\nall, right? They could have just said -- you know,\nyou -- you have a cause of action, you sue us in court,\nright? They could say that, legally, couldn't they?\nMR. KELLOGG: We could. And indeed --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And until Rule 23 was\nadopted, that would mean -- you know, if you had a small\nclaim, tough luck, right? De minimis non curate lex.\nIf it's just negligible, it's impracticable for you to\nbring a Federal claim. And that would not violate the\nSherman Act, would it?\nMR. KELLOGG: Correct. That -- that very\nissue was present in the Eisen case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm a little\nconfused about this business about pooling resources and\nwhether it's prohibited or permitted. Tell me exactly\nwhat your position is on that.\nMR. KELLOGG: Our position is that multiple\nclaimants in arbitration could share the costs of an\nexpert for preparation of a report.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it seems to\nme -- I don't see how that concession is at all needed\nby the other side. I mean, let's just say they have a\ntrade association or something. They -- they can all\nget together and say we want to prepare an antitrust\nexpert report about what American Express is doing, and\nthey do, and then presumably, one of them can use it in\nthe arbitration. Any problem with that?\nMR. KELLOGG: That -- no problem with that,\nand that's absolutely right. But the plaintiffs below\nsaid that wasn't good enough. They said, we need the\naggregate damages provided in a class action to make\nthis worthwhile because if we're just going to\nessentially get costs --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But they could borrow the\nmoney from a lawyer instead of from the trade\nassociation, right?\nMR. KELLOGG: Well, or from a hedge fund,\nwhich increasingly finances litigation.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, again, that\ndoesn't seem too difficult. You either have your trade\nassociation or you have a big meeting of all them and\nsay we need to pay for this expert report and once we've\ngot it -- you know, I'm going to represent each of you\nindividually in individual arbitrations and I'm going to\nwin the first one, and then the others are going to fall\ninto place and they'll get a settlement from American\nExpress that's going to be -- satisfy their concerns.\nMR. KELLOGG: Absolutely right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. And you have\nno problem with that.\nMR. KELLOGG: I have no problem with that.\nAnd that's why this case is about the class action\nwaiver.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And, Mr. Kellogg --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry, I'm\nsorry. Just a follow-up one, briefly. Is the -- is\nthere collateral estoppel effect in the arbitration that\nwould be applied to subsequent --\nMR. KELLOGG: That is unclear. I have tried\nto look at that issue. You know, even in court,\nnon-mutual use of offensive collateral estoppel is\nsometimes at the discretion of court.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.\nMR. KELLOGG: I couldn't find anything in\nthe arbitration contract.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Just to be sure I understand\nit, that you're saying that it does not violate the\nconfidentiality agreement of this clause to -- to all\nget together and produce one report?\nMR. KELLOGG: Correct.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Okay.\nMR. KELLOGG: And if you look at actually\nthe affidavit put in by the plaintiff's expert and you\nlook at all the things he says I need to study in my\nreport, they're all issues in common. They're not\nspecific to a --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And did -- did you say that\nbelow as well, that -- that the confidentiality clause\ndoes not sweep so widely as to prevent this? Because\nclearly, the court below thought that the\nconfidentiality clause did sweep so widely as to prevent\nthis.\nMR. KELLOGG: The Second Circuit did say\nthat after we suggested that they could pool resources.\nAnd we think that was an indication of the Court's,\nshall we say, urgency to strike down the class action\nwaiver.\nNobody challenged the confidentiality\nprovision below.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So but you're saying the\nconfidentiality position would not apply in that\ncircumstance.\nMR. KELLOGG: It would not apply. We took\nthat position below.\nIf I might reserve the remainder of my time?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Clement?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis case is about the scope and continuing\nexistence of a doctrine that has been a feature of this\nCourt's cases and a necessary corollary of its\nwillingness to extend arbitration to Federal statutory\nclaims, the vindication of rights doctrine.\nEver since this Court 30 years ago, roughly,\ngot in the business of extending arbitration to Federal\nstatutory claims, it's used the effective vindication\ndoctrine as an assurance that Federal statutory claims\nwould not go unvindicated just because of the arbitral\nforum.\nAnd so, if you look at this Court's cases,\nthey stand for a simple proposition. When the choice is\narbitration or litigation, surely the FAA favors\narbitration and it's no threat to the underlying\nstatute because the underlying statutory claim is\nvindicated in the arbitral forum.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't see -- I don't see\nhow a Federal statute is frustrated or is unable to be\nvindicated if it's too expensive to bring a Federal\nsuit. That happened for years before there was such a\nthing as class action in Federal courts. Nobody thought\nthe Sherman Act was a dead letter, that it couldn't be\nvindicated.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Scalia, let me\ntake --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And I don't see why it's\nany different when you transpose the situation to the --\nto the arbitration situation.\nMR. CLEMENT: Justice Scalia, let me take on\nthe premise and then we get -- then also say where\nreally the concern comes in for the differential\ntreatment.\nI would take issue with the premise, which\nis, sure, there wasn't a Sherman Act -- there wasn't a\nclass action Rule 23 back when the Sherman Act was first\npassed. But there were procedures in like joinder that\nallowed for multiple claims to be litigated together;\nthere were not confidentiality agreements that came in\nand limited your ability to share information from one\nclaim to another, and, of course, back in the good old\ndays, you didn't necessarily need a $300,000 expert to\nbring a Sherman Act claim.\nBut what I think is the problem is when you\nhave a difference, and that is the assumption on which\nthis case comes to the Court, where you could vindicate\nthis claim in court because there are mechanisms to\nshare or shift costs and you cannot vindicate them in\nthe arbitration because of a combination of features of\nthe arbitration agreement that prevent any sharing or\nshifting of costs.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Before you get to that, I\nhave two questions. One is on the point you've just\nmade because I -- I agree, I understand it is fairly\nwell established, this doctrine, but I don't see quite\nhow it works.\nSuppose there's a Tyler claim, a Truth in\nLending Act -- you know, something like that, and the\nclaim is a fairly -- it's worth about $10,000 or so.\nAnd so the plaintiff says you violated the act, pay me\nthe $10,000. Now, he happens to come up with a theory\nthat is really far out; and the more far out the theory,\nthe harder it is to prove. And the harder it is to\nprove, the more you need expensive experts.\nAnd do we go case by case, saying -- you\nknow, where you have a really weird theory that's going to\nrequire 17 experts and endless studies, you don't have\nto have an arbitration claim, or you don't have to\nfollow it in this instance, but everybody else does.\nNow -- now, is -- is that something, in\nother words, we're supposed to look at case by case,\nwhich would produce the odd result I suggested? Or do\nwe do it by categories? How does the doctrine work?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, you could do it by\ncategory, and I suppose you could treat antitrust claims\ndifferently, but I think there's an answer that's\nalready built into the Court's cases, which is Randolph,\nand it's putting the burden on the plaintiff to make a\nnonspeculative showing.\nAnd in the case you've described, I would\nthink you would say, boy, that's speculative. I mean --\nyou know, you don't need that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, what I'll do because I\nwork with my own hypothetical, I'll have a far-out case,\nbut yet not quite speculative. In other words, what I'm\ntrying to suggest is it's an odd doctrine that just\nsays, plaintiff by plaintiff, you can ignore an\narbitration clause if you can get a case that's\nexpensive enough, and there we are.\nI haven't seen it work, and I haven't seen\nenough to know how it does work. And I guess you\nhaven't either, but -- but I'm concerned about that.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well -- well, don't be too\nconcerned, Justice Breyer. First of all, if you look at\nthe cases where the doctrine's been applied, it's\nlargely been in antitrust cases. The First Circuit\nKristian case is an antitrust case. And I don't think\nthat's an accident.\nI mean, if you look at the Hovenkamp amicus\nbrief, it make clear that you just can't bring this type\nof claim without an expert --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, that doesn't seem right to\nme. Now, Hovenkamp would be the person I would hire as\nthe arbitrator. So surely he does know -- or Phil\nArita -- a blessed memory. And they're under the\ninstruction to get this done cheap. Well, I think that\nmight be possible.\nThat might be possible because it's only the\nquestion of damages that's tough here because if you\ndon't have the double -- there's only one monopoly\nprofit at the two levels, da, da, da, and we don't need\nto go through that.\nBut I can think of a way of getting it done\npretty cheap. But regardless, your expert here didn't\ntalk about the cost of arbitration. He did use the word\nonce. But as I read pages 88 through 92, it seemed to\nme he was talking about the cost of litigation, not the\ncost of arbitration. And -- and I wouldn't proceed\nnecessarily with all those reports he does to impress to\nthe jury, or even the judge.\nThis is Phil Arita. You don't need to\nimpress him. And -- so, so, so -- hasn't the Second\nCircuit looked, assuming your doctrine's in place, to\nthe wrong set of costs: The cost of litigation? Even\nthough they use the word \"arbitration,\" that isn't what\nyour expert told me.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I mean, Justice Breyer,\nnone of us can know for sure what Professor Arita would\nsay. But we know what Professor Hovenkamp says, and he\nsays to bring these claims you need an expert. Now,\nin --\nJUSTICE BREYER: In arbitration or in court?\nMR. CLEMENT: He says in arbitration or\nanywhere. He assumes that anywhere you bring these\nclaims, you're going to need a market power expert.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Does he take into account\nthe fact that the arbitrator can be him? And moreover,\ncould, in fact, work under an instruction keep these\ncosts down?\nMR. CLEMENT: And what I would say,\nJustice Breyer, is the place for that debate, if it were\ngoing to take place, was in the district court. Because\nwe made our case, as Randolph requires -- and it was a\nnonspeculative case. We said it's going to cost\n$300,000 to $500,000 or even a million dollars to get a\nmarket power expert. They didn't come back and say, no,\nin arbitration, I think you can do it for 50,000.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, that isn't the point.\nIf I were doing this offhand, I would say everything is\nconceded, but for one thing: Since there is no double\nmonopoly power, there is only one monopoly power at the\ntwo levels which can be exercised, the only way the\nperson is damaged is if in fact you've raised entry\nbarriers. So you'd say to the plaintiff, how are you\ngoing to prove that? And you'd read it and submit a\nreport.\nNow, I'm not saying this is the right way to\ngo about it. All I'm saying is it's hard for me to\nfigure out on the basis of that affidavit, which talks\nabout courts, why this has to be so expensive. So what\ndo I do?\nMR. CLEMENT: I think what you do is you,\nwith all due respect, fault Petitioners for that.\nBecause we put in that report -- they could have\ncriticized it exactly the way you are and we'd have a\ndifferent case. But they argued before the district\ncourt and the court of appeals just what they argued to\nyou, Justice Kennedy, it doesn't matter if you can do\nit.\nIt doesn't matter if it's too expensive. We\ndon't think this doctrine exists, or we don't think it\nextends to this kind of cases, and having put their --\ntheir money on that extreme position that the effective\nvindication doctrine doesn't exist, I think it's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: One other thing which I\ndidn't understand, and that's why I am asking. What\nthey chose as the remedy here was sever the arbitration\nclause if you want, it seemed to be, and go to court.\nAll right.\nNow, I don't know where that power comes\nfrom. So if you were going to improve this contract in\nthe direction that you would like, why couldn't you\nsever the part about the confidentiality, or why\ncouldn't you require -- you have some awfully big\nmerchants.\nLike, I don't know -- probably, you have\nmaybe Costco, maybe Walmart, maybe -- you know, these\npeople are not without money. Though your client,\nmay be. But -- go get these contributions. Go for --\nthere are many ways you can treat this particular set of\nwords in the arbitration clause, short of severing it\nentirely.\nAnd -- and what about that? What's your\nview on that? What do you think?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, our -- our view on that\nis -- you know, the Court is balancing two things here.\nIt's trying to apply the effective vindication doctrine,\nbut it's also trying to honor the principle of this\nCourt that you treat the parties to the bargain that\nthey have committed.\nNow, if they would have come in and said in\nthe district court -- which they didn't -- that we'll\nget rid of the confidentiality -- they said you could\nshare costs, but they -- you know, the confidentiality\nwas the problem.\nIt was the problem the Second Circuit saw.\nYou can look at 92a of the Petition appendix. And they\ndidn't petition on that issue, so I don't know how they\nget to say, well, the Second Circuit was wrong about\nthat, but isn't that a shame. I mean, if they thought\nthat was wrong, they should have petitioned.\nAnd that just shows you, these issues were\nin front of the Court. Now --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you -- I don't\nunderstand. You think they could have appealed on\nthat -- on that issue?\nMR. CLEMENT: Sure. I don't think this\nCourt would have necessarily granted it because it's not\nvery cert-worthy. But it's also -- I don't know how\nthey can keep that issue in their back pocket and then\nsay well, we got cert -- we got cert on the cert-worthy\nissue and now we have this factual finding where the\nSecond Circuit held that the confidentiality agreement\nprecludes the sharing of this information from\narbitration to arbitration.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Let me ask you. Your\neffective vindicability principle depends upon a\ncomparison with what you could do in Court.\nMR. CLEMENT: It doesn't, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't?\nMR. CLEMENT: It doesn't. It's a simple\ncomparison of the necessary unrecoupable costs of\nbringing the claim in arbitration compared to the\nmaximum recovery.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but if you couldn't do\nit -- if you couldn't do it either -- even if there had\nbeen no arbitration agreement, how could the arbitration\nagreement be -- be harming you? I don't understand\nthat.\nMR. CLEMENT: If you have -- if you have a\nclaim, Justice Scalia, that can't be vindicated in\narbitration or in court, that claim's not going --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Or in court.\nMR. CLEMENT: Right. But that's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You have to compare it to\ncourt.\nMR. CLEMENT: No you don't.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If you couldn't do it in\ncourt, you don't have to be able to do it in\narbitration, it seems to me.\nMR. CLEMENT: With respect, Justice Scalia,\nyou don't have to make that comparison part of the\ntest because the cases that can't be vindicated in\neither place won't show up at the courthouse door. So\nonce you show up at the courthouse door, you've got a\nplaintiff's lawyer. They may be crazy, but you have a\nplaintiff's lawyer that thinks I can do this in the\nlitigation system.\nAnd so at that point, the only question is,\nall right, I think I can do this in the litigation\nsystem. If the only thing that's precluding me from\ndoing it is this arbitration agreement -- so this\narbitration agreement is not operating as a real\narbitration agreement, it's operating as a de facto\nas-applied exculpatory clause. If they can make that\nshowing, then -- and the option is not arbitration or\nlitigation --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No. No. It's saying that\nthere's an alternate mechanism for resolving disputes.\nIt's called arbitration. And arbitration does not\nnecessarily or even as a matter of fact often as a\npractical matter involve the costs and the formalities of\nlitigation.\nMR. CLEMENT: And -- and God bless it,\nJustice Kennedy -- when it does that, and it can\neffectively address claims that can't be addressed in\nthe litigation system, that's exactly what we want\narbitration to do.\nBut there are some cases where the\narbitration system -- not generally -- I mean, if you\nhave the kind of pro-vindication agreement you had in\nConcepcion, or that Sovereign Bank has that we mentioned\nin our brief, then you can vindicate these claims in\narbitration.\nBut when you have a specific arbitration\nagreement that has a variety of clauses that don't allow\nfor any mechanism to shift or share the costs, so you\nknow it's not litigation versus arbitration, of course\nwe'll go with arbitration. It's litigation or nothing.\nIn those circumstances, this Court has always said that\nwe'll have --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I mean maybe it is\nlitigation if you need a $300,000 report. But why do\nyou need a $300,000 report? That's what we're asking.\nAnd I just can't -- it seems to me that I have to engage\nin speculation about the limits of arbitration in order\nto resolve in your favor.\nNow, to be sure, they took a -- a more rigid\nview below, so we don't have much of a record.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well -- and, Justice Kennedy,\nI would say that -- I mean, shame on them, with all due\nrespect. Because there was an opportunity in the\ndistrict court to make an apples to apples comparison,\nand they could have said, no, $300,000 is way off; you\ncan do this for $25,000, and here's how. But they\ndidn't make that showing. They said -- you know, we\ndon't think the effective vindication doctrine applies\nin these circumstances at all.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's a little much\nto expect them to come back and say, oh no, no, no, you\ndon't have to prove all this. The only thing you've got\nto prove is it's going to cost you $25,000. That's an\nodd position to put them in.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I don't think it is,\nMr. Chief Justice. I -- they don't have to say -- you\nknow -- they don't have to tell us how to prove our case\nto the lowest possible price. They just have to show us\nsomething that will allow us to vindicate our claim --\nJUSTICE BREYER: There is no authority that\nI could find for the prop -- I mean, if in fact it costs\nyou $10,000 to buy the arbitrator -- system -- you know,\nyou buy the system --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: Sorry. But I mean -- you\nknow, hire -- whatever it is, if those are obstacles,\nit's pretty well established, I think, that that\narbitration is not something that you can use to\nvindicate the Federal claim. And the part that's\nbothering me about this, though, is that those aren't\nobstacles.\nIt's just you brought a very expensive\nclaim. And the real problem here is the reason they can\ngo into court is they can get a class action in court.\nAnd then this Court has said, you can't get the class\naction in arbitration. There we have it.\nSo -- so the -- the question in my mind is,\nwell, is there a way that some of the beneficial aspects\nof class action can be used in an arbitration that does\nnot formally have a class action? And there it seems\nyours is a good case because a lot of them can. You\nsay, well, the one part that can't is getting this\nprivate information.\nSo maybe we should send it back and say,\nwell, why do you need the private information? On a\ngood theory of antitrust, you're going to show that the\nprice of the Tide product was higher than what it would\nhave been had the entry barriers not been raised from\nthe Tide. That's a general entry question, which I\ndon't think you need private information from them to\nanswer. But that's -- and now we're really into the\ndepths of the merits.\nSo I thought of sending it back and saying,\nlet's -- let them explore this kind of thing about other\nways of trying to get some of these advantages of class\naction into your -- you're going to say I'm too far out\non this.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, what I'm going to say,\nJustice --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They could write a treatise\non it, maybe.\nMR. CLEMENT: But -- but what I was going to\nsay is look, I mean, take a step back. You know, one of\nthe great things about the effective vindication\ndoctrine is it gets the incentives rights. It gives\ncompanies incentives to draft clauses that will allow\nfor the maximum vindication of Federal rights.\nAnd so there are lots of clauses out there\nthat would allow for even this claim because they have\ncost shifting of expert costs or they don't have\nconfidentiality agreements or they'll waive the\nconfidentiality -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose this class could\nnot -- could not qualify for certification in Federal\ncourt. Are you asserting that there is some arbitration\nprinciple that -- that allows you to create some new\nclass?\nMR. CLEMENT: No, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you have to make -- you\nhave to make a comparison to what can be done in Federal\ncourt, don't you?\nMR. CLEMENT: No, it's not part of the\ninquiry because --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It isn't. So that any\nclass that the arbitrator thinks is okay is required.\nMR. CLEMENT: No, it's just that if by virtue\nof showing up in court and saying, I want to litigate my\nclaim, the lawyer has already made a judgment that I can\nvindicate it in Federal court.\nMaybe it's because of class action, maybe\nit's just because of joinder, maybe it's because there's\nno confidentiality rule in the Federal proceedings, so\nit can bring a lot of these claims, maybe it's a\ndifference in collateral estoppel. Whatever it is, that\nlawyer has already spoken that I can make this claim\nwork in litigation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But he wants a class. What\nhe wants in the arbitration is the ability to sue on behalf\nof a class, doesn't he?\nMR. CLEMENT: That might be what they most\nwant, but they don't get that. They just get some way\nto vindicate the claim. And if this had a cost-shifting\nprovisions that the expert costs were shifted, that\nwould get the job done, that's the Sovereign Bank\nexample we talked about in our brief. There are more\nthan one way. We're not trying to get a guarantee for\nclass treatment in one form or the other.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is -- is that what you\nasked for below, anything, class action or compensation\nor whatever?\nMR. CLEMENT: We -- in fairness, we focused\nbelow on the class action because that's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's what I thought.\nThat's what I thought this case was about. What's the\nquestion presented anyway?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, don't just look at the\nquestion presented, look at the opinion below. And look\nat 91(A) and 92(A). The questions that the Second\nCircuit addressed --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Whether -- whether the\nFederal Arbitration Act permits courts invoking the\nFederal substantive law of arbitrability to invalidate\narbitration agreements on the ground that they do not\npermit class arbitration of a Federal law claim.\nNow, you're saying that -- that whether they\npermit class arbitration is not going to be decided on\nthe basis of whether you could certify a class under\nRule 23, but just what?\nAnd -- and -- and if it does depend on that,\nwhat is the Court supposed to do? Before it can -- it\ncan give you your claim, it has to -- it has to decide\nwhether this class would be certifiable, wouldn't it?\nMy goodness --\nMR. CLEMENT: No, it would not --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- this is a very\ncomplicated procedure.\nMR. CLEMENT: -- Your Honor. You just have\nto answer the question, is there a problem with the\narbitration, is there something with this specific\nagreement that precludes this claim going forward. Here\nit's a combination of no class arbitration, no way to\nshift costs because they don't provide cost shifting,\nand no way to share costs because of the\nconfidentiality.\nWhatever they put in the question presented,\nthey can't make the Second Circuit's holding that the\nconfidentiality provision blocks the sharing of\ninformation to go away. They're stuck with that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is -- tell me\nhow the no -- no sharing of information and\nconfidentiality, how does that work again? You can't,\nif you're a trade association, get together and say, I\nthink we should have a study of Amex's whatever. And\nthen you put together the study, and then one of your\nmembers says -- you know, that's a good study, I'm going\nto go -- go to arbitration. They can't do that?\nMR. CLEMENT: They -- they could do that\nmuch, Mr. Chief Justice. The critical point at which\nthe confidentiality provision creates a practical\nproblem is you're trying to get all the information,\nyou're trying to get a single expert report in order to\nshare the costs, and you're trying to do not just the\nmarket survey, but do a damage calculation, have a\ndamage formula.\nBecause when you have a market like this\nwhere the allegations are they've distorted the market,\nso we can't rely on the market price, we need to know\nthe sales volumes of all the individual stores. Their\nconfidentiality agreement protects that and doesn't\nallow that to be shared. That's not that unusual.\nThis Court in Nielsen and Concepcion both\nremarked that one of the features of arbitration is you\ngenerally keep it confidential. And that's something\nthat the Second Circuit said because of that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what if you\ndo -- I mean, what if you do it, is that just part of\nyour trade associations, they think this is -- you know,\nthey're not talking about particular arbitration or\nanything. They just prepare a -- a report, and then\nonce you see the report, you say, my gosh, I had no\nidea, and then you file your claim for arbitration.\nMR. CLEMENT: With all due respect, Mr. --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It seems to me my\npoint is simply that there's no sharing, confidence, it\nseems like an awfully amorphous provision that would be\nvery difficult to enforce.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I mean, I don't think\nit's that difficult, Mr. Chief Justice. Certainly, cost\nshifting is not difficult, and there are other ways to\nsolve this problem. But the Amex agreement forecloses\nall of them.\nAnd the question for this Court is, do you\nsay, well, tough or do you say what you've said every\ntime you've confronted this problem, the effective\nvindication doctrine provides the solution.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll afford you\nsome rebuttal time.\nMr. Stewart?\nOh, no, we won't.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You should have said, \"I\naccept,\" very quickly.\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just being generous\nthis morning.\nMr. Stewart?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MR. MALCOLM L. STEWART,\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENTS\nMR. STEWART: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nAt the beginning of the argument,\nJustice Kagan asked whether a pure exculpatory clause, a\nprovision in a contract that simply said, we promise not\nto seek relief under the arbitration -- under the\nantitrust clause period would be enforceable, and\nMr. Kellogg replied that it would not.\nAnd I think the unenforceability of such a\nprovision would not depend on any analysis of what was\nlikely to happen if the suit was brought in court; that\nis, a pure exculpatory clause could be set aside and the\nplaintiff could still lose for any number of reasons.\nThe plaintiff could be denied class certification and\ndecide it's uneconomical to proceed with an individual\nsuit.\nHe could lose on a threshold ground like the\nstatute of limitations or he could lose on the merits.\nBut the unenforceability of the pure exculpatory clause\nwouldn't require the Court to make a comparison between\nbeing kicked out of court on that basis and what would\nlikely happen if the suit were able to be brought.\nAnd we would submit that the same mode of\nanalysis applies when the arbitration agreement can be\nshown to have the same practical effect as an\nexculpatory clause; that is, if it is the case that\ngiven the amount of money at stake, the arbitration\nprocedure specified in the contract and the modes of\nproof that would be necessary in arbitration, if it can\nbe shown persuasively by the plaintiff who bears the\nburden that no reasonable plaintiff would find it\neconomically feasible to proceed, then the arbitration\nagreement can't be enforced --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Would that be the case even\nbefore Rule 23 was -- was adopted?\nMR. STEWART: Yes. And it would be --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Even though you couldn't\nvindicate it in the Federal courts, you must be able to\nvindicate it in arbitration?\nMR. STEWART: The question would be whether\nthe arbitration agreement could be enforced.\nAnd before Rule 23 was adopted, if there had\nbeen a pure exculpatory clause, it would have been\nunenforceable and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not even talking about\na pure exculpatory clause. I'm talking about the mere\nfact that as a practical matter, it's impossible to\nbring it in arbitration. In a context in which it is\nalso impossible to bring it in Federal court.\nAnd you would say, still, you must permit it\nto be brought in arbitration, even though it can't be\nbrought in Federal court.\nMR. STEWART: In the same way that we would\nsay a pure exculpatory clause would be invalid and\nunenforceable, even if it were clear from the\nplaintiff's complaint that he was not entitled to relief\non the merits.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And, Mr. -- Mr. Stewart,\nisn't that also consistent with the way the Court\naddressed the issue in Randolph? Because what the Court\nsaid there was it might be that these arbitration fees\nare prohibitive. And if those arbitration fees are\nprohibitive, then this doctrine kicks in.\nAnd it didn't look to say, well, let's\ncompare how these fees relate to whatever costs you\nwould wind up with in litigation. It just said, if the\narbitration fees are prohibitive, in such -- in such a\nmanner that it prevents you from vindicating your\nFederal claim in arbitration, that's enough.\nMR. STEWART: That's correct. And I would\nmake two real world --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what are the\narbitration fees? It's not -- not -- not lawyers' fees.\nDo they include lawyers' fees?\nMR. STEWART: No, the attorneys' fees would\nbe recoupable under the substantive law.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. So I don't know,\nwhat do you --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Expert costs.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So what are you comparing\nit to in court litigation?\nMR. STEWART: We are not really --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: A filing fee?\nMR. STEWART: No, I think we are not\ncomparing it to anything. That is, our -- our position\nis in determining whether the arbitration agreement has\nthe same practical effect as an exculpatory clause, we\nasked could any reasonable plaintiff proceed under the\nterms and conditions that are set up? And if the answer\nto that is no, then the arbitration agreement is\nunenforceable.\nNow, I would make two real-world points, one\nof which Mr. Clement has already alluded to. The first\nis the only cases that are going to wind up in court are\nthose in which the plaintiff at least believes that it\nwould be feasible to vindicate the claim in court, and\nso they are likely to be those in which there is at least a\npotential difference between the outcome in court and\nthe outcome in arbitration.\nThe other is, even if a plaintiff believes\nwrongly that he can proceed in court through a class\naction mechanism and class action -- class certification\nis denied under Rule 23, presumably at that point the\nplaintiff is going to give up and the outcome at the end\nof the day is going to be the same as if the arbitration\nagreement had been enforced.\nJUSTICE BREYER: This is exactly -- I found\nno authority for the proposition that what hinders --\nplenty of authority, you can't make the person go to\narbitration if the fees involved are too high because\nhe's blocked.\nBut you're quite an advance over that. You\nare saying the thing that keeps him out is his own\ntheory of wrong, which will involve hiring a lot of\nexperts and others.\nNow, once that's adopted, it seems to me in\npractice we have reversed in many, many cases the\nproposition that you can, in fact, require Federal\ncauses of action to be arbitrated because all you have\nto do to get -- out of the arbitration is to allege a\ntheory of your case which is hard and complicated to\nprove. Now, you are back in court.\nNow, that's a significant erosion, it seems\nto me. So I want to know if you have any standard\nthere, if we're just supposed to accept that, if in fact\nyou are trying to reverse in practice what was the\nholding that you can arbitrate these Federal causes of\naction. What is going on here?\nAnd an addendum to that is if you are going\nto convince me, which you might, that, well, that's\nokay, do it, do it, do it, is it a possible remedy to\nmonkey with the arbitration clause and provide for a\nsharing of costs, say if you win, the loser will pay the\nexpert fees, which is of course a much more\npro-arbitration way than just throwing it out entirely?\nMR. STEWART: Well, let me start --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's a long question, but\ndo you see what I'm driving at?\nMR. STEWART: Let me start with your last\nquestion and work backwards. It is possible and it\nsometimes has happened in the lower court cases that a\nplaintiff will come into court and say, I can't proceed\nthrough arbitration because the arbitral fees are too\nhigh in relation to my likely recovery.\nAnd the defendant at that point will say, we\noffer to waive the fees or we offer to pay your share of\nthe arbitral fees, and a court will be persuaded that,\ngiven that consensual modification of the contract, it\nis feasible for the claims to be brought in arbitration\nand the plaintiff is kicked out of court.\nNow, this is consensual. This is something\nthat the court has -- that the court has done at the\ncompany's behest, and it would be different question of\nwhether the court could do that over the company's\nobjection. But another thing that the company could do\nis put in a severability clause in the contract that\nwould specify what results should obtain if one\nprovision of the contract were held to be invalid.\nI guess another thing I would say in\nresponse to your question is we do have one data point,\nthe First Circuit's decision in Kristian, which I\nbelieve Mr. Clement referred to, in 2006, which\nessentially held on facts similar to these that the\narbitration clause as written was not enforceable\nbecause the cost of the expert fees in an antitrust case\nwould dwarf any potential recovery, and we haven't seen\nthe floodgates opened.\nThe last thing I would say is if this is the\nconcern, Petitioner's proposed rule really doesn't match\nthe argument in its favor. That is, Petitioner is not\njust arguing for a rule that would cover cases in which\nthe relevant costs are those of experts or similar\nauthorities.\nPetitioner's rule would say even if the\ncontract provides for a non-recoupable $500 filing fee\nand the amount of the claim at stake is $200, so it's\nabsolutely apparent on the face of the contract that the\nclaim can't be brought, the agreement is still\nenforceable and the plaintiff is deprived of his day in\ncourt.\nThe other thing I would say about\nPetitioner's argument is the challenge to the Second\nCircuit's decision has really changed drastically since\nthe cert petition was filed; that is, the Second Circuit\ntook it as essentially undisputed that the costs of the\nexpert report would render it economically infeasible to\nproceed in arbitration, and it took the further step of\nsaying, therefore the arbitration agreement is\nunenforceable.\nNow, the cert petition challenged only the\n\"therefore\" part of the Second Circuit's analysis.\nThere wasn't a suggestion that the Petitioner intended\nto challenge the antecedent determination that these\nclaims couldn't feasibly have been brought in\nindividualized proceedings.\nAnd I think as Paul -- Mr. Clement said, the\nlikely reason is that wouldn't look like a cert-worthy\nissue. That sort of fact-specific inquiry wouldn't seem\nlike a wise use of this Court's resources.\nSo having gotten cert granted on the\nimportant legal question whether the inefficacy of\narbitration procedures is a basis for invalidating the\nagreement, Petitioners are now spending a great deal of\ntime arguing that it would in fact have been feasible to\npursue these claims through individualized arbitration.\nAnd one thing we would say in response, as\nMr. Clement said --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. They didn't get\ncert granted on that question at all. As I pointed out\nbefore, they got it granted on whether the mere fact\nthat the arbitration agreement did not permit class\narbitration renders it invalid.\nMR. STEWART: But they did get cert --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's what I thought the\nquestion before us.\nMR. STEWART: They got cert granted on that\nquestion, but neither the question as so framed or the\nbody of the cert petition suggests any challenge to the\nSecond Circuit's factual determination that these claims\ncould not feasibly have been brought in individualized\narbitration.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Stewart, is it -- the\narbitration agreement is a one-on-one, right? They\ncan't, or can they have -- they have the 12 similarly\nsituated people, not a class, join in the arbitration,\nor is it one on one?\nMR. STEWART: That's correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Which is correct?\nMR. STEWART: It is correct that it has to\nbe one on one, that the agreement requires only --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And even in the days\nbefore we had Rule 23, when you were bringing a suit in\nFederal court you could have multiple plaintiffs joining\ntogether.\nMR. STEWART: That's correct. The agreement\nprohibits even the types of joinder mechanisms that\nmight have been available when the Sherman Act was\npassed.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Kellogg, you have rebuttal time, 6\nminutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL KELLOGG\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS\nMR. KELLOGG: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nLet me focus on what the court of appeals\nheld below. At 3a of our appendix, the court said.\n\"The only issue before us is the narrow question of\nwhether the class action waiver provision contained in\nthe contract between the parties should be enforced.\"\nThat is the question on which we sought certiorari.\nThat is the question that the Court granted.\nIt is Respondents who have now tried to\nrewrite that question by talking about other possible\nways of vindicating their rights that they claim are\nforeclosed, that they claim wrongly are foreclosed by\nthe contract at issue here.\nThis is not --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, do we have a factual\nrecord? Suppose, I think, based in substantial part on\nJustice Breyer's suggestion, that we could have an\narbitration that's effective and we could have a trade\nassociation prepare a report, and we could do one\narbitration and then see if it applies to others.\nSuppose I think that.\nDo I -- doesn't that bear on this question?\nAnd if it does, I don't have a factual record to support\nmy assumptions.\nMR. KELLOGG: I don't think you need a\nfactual record because as Respondents acknowledge the\nburden is on them to show that the arbitration-specific\ncosts would preclude them from pursuing their claim.\nAnd they have not done that by putting in an\naffidavit saying, well, in litigation we have to do --\nget 5 million documents and spend $300,000 processing\nthem and get an expert report which could cost up to $1\nmillion.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But suppose we answer --\nMR. KELLOGG: That is not --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- the question -- the\nanswer is yes, a class action waiver can be enforced.\nMR. KELLOGG: Correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, what are the\ncircumstances here? The record leaves us uncertain, we\nremand it for further consideration of what they are.\nMR. KELLOGG: Well, the court could\ncertainly --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because that isn't the\nissue they decided, whether it could be enforced. They\ndecided whether you can -- whether the whole arbitration\nagreement could be enforced.\nMR. KELLOGG: The holding of the court of\nappeals is the arbitration agreement cannot be enforced\nbecause it has a class action waiver. That is clearly\nreversible error. I don't even hear --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It was because -- it was\nbecause Judge Pooler said, \"I have been instructed by\nthe Supreme Court that I may not require class\narbitration.\" That's -- and she was bound by our\ndecision that a court can't order class arbitration,\nisn't that correct? So that was not an option for her.\nMR. KELLOGG: But the Court also in\nConcepcion said you can condition the enforceability of\nan arbitration agreement on the availability of class\nprocedures, and that is what the Court below violated.\nSo the decision below has to be vacated.\nI do not think you should remand for a\ndetailed factual showing on just how they are going to\nvindicate their rights in arbitration because most of\nthose questions, what evidence is required, et cetera,\nare for the arbitrator in the first instance.\nThat said, we made -- we did respond to\ntheir showing below. We did not put in a dueling\naffidavit saying, no, in litigation, it only requires a\n$200,000 report or a $25,000 report. We said, that's\nirrelevant because we're talking about\narbitration-specific costs. And there's lots of ways\nthat they can proceed with their claims.\nOne is by sharing the costs of an expert,\nand they specifically rejected that. They said, even if\nwe could shift the costs of the experts to the other\nside, that wouldn't be good enough because then all we'd\nbe doing is expending much money to get it back.\nWe need aggregated damages of the sort\navailable in class suit --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Or you have to do without.\nI -- you just said what -- I thought that the expert\ntalked about litigation costs, not about arbitration\ncosts.\nSo how is that handled?\nMR. KELLOGG: That is how I read -- that is\nhow I read the report. And certainly with an expert\narbitrator --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You said you waived that\npoint, whatever -- however it is. You waived it. Never\nraised it. The Court of Appeals took it as if it were\narbitration costs.\nMR. KELLOGG: No, we raised -- we've argued\nthat all along. In fact, I can refer the Court to page\n27 of our -- the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The Second Circuit never\nsaid anything about, this is what it would cost in\ncourt. The court -- the Court of Appeals said, this is\nwhat it would cost to prove this kind of tying, right?\nIt didn't say one word distinguishing what\nit would cost in litigation from what it would cost in\narbitration. It was simply what it was going to cost.\nMR. KELLOGG: We did, in fact. But let me\nanswer Justice Breyer's question first, at page 27 of\nour Court of Appeals --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I believe you.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'd like to hear the\nanswer, if nobody --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. KELLOGG: We specifically said, \"The\ndeclaration of merchant's expert is similarly\nun-illuminating, as he too studiously avoided projecting\nthe costs for an individual arbitration of these\ndisputes.\"\nSo we did argue against that point. This is\nnot an exculpatory clause. The Court has made clear\nthat a class action waiver is not an exculpatory clause.\nThis Court has also made clear that you cannot assume\nthat the arbitral forum will be inadequate to vindicate\nFederal substantive rights.\nAnd they cannot now change the nature of the\nquestion presented by arguing that well, there should\nhave been another provision to allow -- specifically\nallow cost-sharing, or specifically allow cost-shifting.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Kellogg, it does\nseem like both of the parties have changed what they're\nsaying a bit. And -- you know, if this case as\npresented to us was presented to us in the first\ninstance that the premise was that if you go into\narbitration, it would not provide an effective way to\nvindicate the claim.\nAnd, now, people are saying different things\nabout the confidentiality clause, and people may be\nsaying different things about the necessity of an\nexpert. It suggests that the premise on which this case\nwas presented to us was not quite right.\nMR. KELLOGG: Well, I -- I don't believe\nthat's the case. The premise on which the Court\naccepted the case, presumably, is that the decision\nbelow which conditioned the enforceability of the\narbitration agreement on a -- on the availability of\nclass procedures, was wrong under Concepcion.\nTherefore -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
