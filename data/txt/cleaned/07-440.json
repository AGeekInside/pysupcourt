        "content": "(11:06 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will now hear\nargument in Case 07-440, Rothgery v. Gillespie County,\nTexas.\nMs. Spinelli.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIELLE SPINELLI\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. SPINELLI: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn Brewer and Jackson, this Court held that\nan initial appearance before a magistrate like the one\nhere marks the commencement of a criminal prosecution\nunder the Sixth Amendment. This case demonstrates why\nthat holding makes eminent sense.\nRothgery was arrested on the erroneous\nbelief that he was a felon in possession of a firearm.\nAs required by the Texas Code, he was brought before a\nmagistrate, who informed him of the felony accusation\nagainst him and required him to post bail or remain in\njail to ensure that he answered that accusation.\nAt that point, Rothgery acquired specific\nrights under Texas law as the accused in a felony case,\nincluding the right to have the prosecution against him\ndismissed if an indictment or information were not filed\nwithin a set period and the right to contest the\naccusation against him prior to indictment in an\nexamining trial before the magistrate. At that point,\nRothgery was no longer merely a suspect, but an accused\nwithin the meaning of the Sixth Amendment.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, how can\nthis -- how can this be part of an adversary proceeding\nwhen there's no other adversary on the field? The\nprosecution's not present. They don't even know\nanything about this.\nMS. SPINELLI: Mr. Chief Justice, this Court\nheld in Jackson that the question whether a particular\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, in Jackson of\ncourse the charges had already been filed by the\nprosecutor, so there was an adversary on the field.\nMS. SPINELLI: What I was going to say was\nthat there is a clear distinction which is set forth in\nthis Court's opinion in Jackson between the question\nwhether a particular proceeding initiates a criminal\nprosecution and whether that proceeding itself is\nadversarial in the sense that it requires the presence\nof defense counsel.\nAnd, as to the first question, whether a\nparticular proceeding initiates a criminal prosecution,\nthis Court's cases have not held that prosecutorial\ninvolvement is a relevant factor, and that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I suppose -- I\nsuppose you could you have an adversarial proceeding\nwithout the prosecutor present, but it would depend on\nthe nature of the proceeding. And here the magistrate\nsimply advises the individual of the charges against\nhim, repeats the Miranda warnings, advises him that he\ncan have counsel if bail is denied or if he can't make\nbail. What about that is adversarial?\nMS. SPINELLI: That's correct, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and we don't contend that it is adversarial.\nIn Jackson, this Court made clear that a\nproceeding need not itself be adversarial in the sense\nthat would require defense counsel to be present to\ncounter the adversary presentation of the prosecutor in\norder for that proceeding to initiate a criminal\nprosecution. Rather, it held that the initial\nappearance itself, regardless of those other factors,\nmarked the commencement of a prosecution.\nAnd it's worth noting that in Jackson\nsubstantially the same arguments that Respondent raises\nhere were made by the State there. The State there\ncontended this initial appearance is merely an\nadministrative ministerial proceeding.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I guess I'll\nget back to the point I raised earlier, that in Jackson\ncharges had already been filed by a prosecutor. The\nprosecutor was aware of this proceeding. I think that's\na fairly significant distinction.\nMS. SPINELLI: Well, the Court in Jackson\nplaced no weight on that distinction. That wasn't\nsomething that was mentioned in Jackson. And what\nhappened in Jackson was that warrants were obtained, the\ndefendants were arrested, and they were brought before a\nmagistrate for this initial proceeding. There is no\nindication that the prosecutor was present at that\ninitial proceeding. The Jackson court -- the Jackson\ncourt put no weight on that factor. And none of this\nCourt's cases have ever stated that there is a\nrequirement that a prosecutor be involved. And that\nmakes sense, because the consequences of the initial\nappearance for the defendant are precisely the same\nwhether or not a prosecutor is involved.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But what we're looking for\nhere, at least one of the things we might look for in\nthis case, is a specific rule to give to the States so\nthe State knows when counsel has to be appointed.\nIn this case suppose the magistrate, the man\nbehind the little window, said: We're going to give you\na ticket; keep in touch with us; don't change your\naddress until you notify us; you're free on your own\nrecognizance. Would counsel have been required there?\nMS. SPINELLI: Had there been no way in\nwhich the defendant was bound to reappear and answer the\ncharges, then we would not have the situation that we\nhave, and it would seem less likely that that would\ninitiate a criminal proceeding. The factors that we\nhave here that make it clear that a prosecution was\ninitiated, just as it was in Jackson on identical facts\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Spinelli, there's\nsomething confusing about your presentation of this,\nbecause you say that at this initial appearance that's\ncalled a magistration, you are not contending that there\nwas a right to counsel at that very proceeding.\nMS. SPINELLI: That's correct, Justice\nGinsburg.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So when, at what point in\ntime, did this right to counsel attach? If it didn't\nattach during that magistration proceeding, when did it\nattach?\nMS. SPINELLI: Well, first I should say I\nbelieve that that question goes to Respondent's\nalternative argument for affirmance. The only question\nthat was addressed by the Fifth Circuit and the only\nquestion presented in the petition was the question\nwhether a criminal prosecution commenced at Rothgery's\nmagistration. And we are certainly not asking this\nCourt to direct the entry of judgment in our favor, but\nmerely --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you are taking the\nposition that there was a right to counsel that attached\nin this case. And I'm asking you at what point in time\nthat right attached.\nMS. SPINELLI: We believe that -- well, this\nCourt's cases have made clear that the right to counsel\nattaches at the time a criminal prosecution commences.\nNow, the question whether counsel must then be appointed\nimmediately upon attachment is a separate question.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What does \"attachment\" mean?\nMS. SPINELLI: What \"attachment\" means under\nthis Court's cases is that since a criminal prosecution\nhas now begun, the explicit guarantees of the Sixth\nAmendment are applicable, the State no longer -- the\nState cannot interfere after that point with the\nattorney-client relationship. At that point the\ndefendant has the right to counsel to serve as an\nintermediary --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well if Mr. Roth -- if your\nclient had shown up at the magistration with an\nattorney, could the State of Texas have said, no, your\nattorney may not be present during the magistration?\nMS. SPINELLI: No, I don't believe so,\nbecause --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, does that mean that\nthe right attached prior to the magistration?\nMS. SPINELLI: We believe that the right\nattached at the magistration.\nJUSTICE ALITO: At the beginning, at the\nend?\nMS. SPINELLI: Upon the magistration.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What does that mean?\nMS. SPINELLI: So perhaps -- so at the\nend -- I suppose I would say at the end, once --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Then why could Texas have\nsaid your attorney -- why could Texas have not said,\nalthough you came here with an attorney, your attorney\nmay not be present because you don't have a Sixth\nAmendment right to counsel at the magistration? Your\nright hasn't attached yet. It won't attach until the\nend.\nMS. SPINELLI: Well, I believe that it would\nattach at the time that the magistrate informed the\ndefendant of the accusation against him, at which point\nhe became a defendant in a criminal case and his right\nto counsel attached.\nNow, to get back to Justice Ginsburg's\nquestion, whether -- whether counsel is required to be\nappointed immediately upon attachment is a separate\nissue, which is the subject of Respondent's alternative\nground for affirmance. We are merely asking this Court\nto resolve the threshold question, which is the\nthreshold question in every right to counsel case, did a\ncriminal prosecution commence at Rothgery's\nmagistration?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The two are kind of\nrelated. If in fact there's not a right to counsel upon\nthe magistration, but, as you said earlier to Justice\nAlito, it attaches at the end of the magistration, it\nseems to me like you're asking for counsel to be an\ninvestigator rather than to participate in the trial\nproceedings.\nMS. SPINELLI: No, I don't believe so, Your\nHonor. This Court has said that a defendant does not\nhave a right for a lawyer to act as a pre-charge private\ninvestigator. But our contention is that Rothgery was\ncharged at his magistration. At that point he became an\naccused, which is demonstrated by the structure of the\nTexas Code itself.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: How is that different from\na traffic ticket?\nMS. SPINELLI: It's very different from a\ntraffic ticket, Justice Kennedy, because in that\nsituation -- I think that situation would be analogous\nto a warrantless arrest, which, as we know, does not\ncommence adversary judicial proceedings. Here, we have\nan arrest. We have a person who has been held for a\nperiod of time --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So it's the warrant that\nmakes the difference?\nMS. SPINELLI: No, I don't believe so. I\nbelieve it's the magistration.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Or the incarceration.\nWould your case be different if after the magistration\nthe -- your client was free to go? The court said, you\nknow, this is what you've been arrested for and charged\nwith by the policeman who brought you in; we'll -- you\nknow, good-bye. Whereas in this case, he was required\nto make bail. Suppose he hadn't been required to make\nbail, supposing he was free to go?\nMS. SPINELLI: If he had not been required\nto make bail or make any other binding promise to\nappear, which is the function of bail, to ensure that\nthe defendant will answer the accusation --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMS. SPINELLI: -- then we would be lacking\nthat piece of evidence that he had been accused. There\nstill would remain other evidence under Texas law that\nhe was, in fact, an accused at that time.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So Texas -- assuming we\nagree with that, Texas made one of two possible\nconstitutional violations. Either it was\nunconstitutional for Texas to require him to make bail,\nor it was unconstitutional for Texas not to provide him\nwith an attorney. Why should -- why should we find that\nthe latter was the problem rather than the former?\nMS. SPINELLI: Well, there is certainly\nnothing unconstitutional about requiring bail, as we\nknow.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, there certainly is if\nyou're not charged. I think it's a very strong point in\nyour favor that he was required to make bail, because I\ndon't think you can hold somebody without charging him,\njust say, you know --\nMS. SPINELLI: Well, we -- I mean, we --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The fact -- the fact that\nhe was held suggests that he was charged with something.\nMS. SPINELLI: We agree, Justice Scalia. In\nfact, the Texas Code expressly recognizes that the\nfunction of bail is to ensure that the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Sure.\nMS. SPINELLI: -- accused will answer the\naccusation against him.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So maybe, maybe Texas was\nwrong about that, that it shouldn't have required bail.\nMaybe that was what was unconstitutional, rather than\nits failure to provide counsel.\nMS. SPINELLI: Well, what occurred here,\nhowever, was that Texas did require Mr. Rothgery to post\nbail. And in addition, the magistration gave rise to\ncertain specific rights, which only accrued to\ndefendants in criminal prosecutions.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- that a magistrate is\nrequired whenever bail is set -- pardon me, that an\nattorney is required whenever bail is set?\nMS. SPINELLI: We're not contending that an\nattorney was required.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The rule is -- I want to\nknow, what do we tell Texas it has to do in all these\ncases? What do we tell jurisdictions that have to deal\nwith traffic tickets? Does it make a difference that\nyou're held in custody or not held in custody? I don't\nunderstand the rule you want us to adopt.\nMS. SPINELLI: I think the rule -- we're\nactually not asking the Court to adopt any new rule\ntoday, but simply to reaffirm the rule it has already\nannounced in Brewer and Jackson, which is that an\ninitial appearance before a magistrate, which is a\nproceeding that is common across jurisdictions and has a\ncommon significance across jurisdictions, a proceeding\nat which a magistrate informs the defendant officially\nof the accusation against him and of his rights as a\ncriminal defendant --\nJUSTICE ALITO: But when do you say counsel\nhas to be appointed? Is it before the magistration? Is\nit at the end, immediately upon the end of it?\nMS. SPINELLI: No, we believe --\nJUSTICE ALITO: What if -- what if an\nattorney had been appointed here ten days after the\nmagistration?\nMS. SPINELLI: Our contention is that an\nattorney was required to be appointed promptly after\nRothgery renewed his request for an attorney following\nthe magistration.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, so the --\nMS. SPINELLI: And this Court --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What is the -- so the point\nof the magistration is that is the point at which a\nreasonable time starts running within which Texas must\nafford -- appoint counsel, isn't that your basic point?\nMS. SPINELLI: Correct, Justice Souter.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMS. SPINELLI: That's our contention.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So there's no claim that\nthere was anything invalid about the magistration\nproceeding --\nMS. SPINELLI: Not at all.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- itself because there was\nno counsel there.\nMS. SPINELLI: No, not at all.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: There's no claim -- for\nexample, had there been a probable cause hearing, that\nthe attorney would have been required to participate in\nthe probable cause hearing under --\nMS. SPINELLI: No.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: There has simply got to be\none appointed within a reasonable time after the\nmagistration. That's -- that's your argument?\nMS. SPINELLI: That's correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is there any law on that?\nIs there -- suppose there's an indictment and the\ndefendant finds out about it; he's never arrested;\nnothing further happens; weeks pass. Now, is there any\nlaw that tells me -- it's an indictment, that's clear --\nand is there any law that tells me, when he requests a\ncounsel be appointed, when they have to do it?\nMS. SPINELLI: Justice Breyer, this Court\nhas not been faced with the question --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So the answer is no.\nMS. SPINELLI: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What happens -- what\nhappens if -- the part that's worrying and I don't know\nhow people handle it -- a riot. A big sit-in. A big\ndemonstration, 500 people arrested, they are brought\ndown to the station, bail is posted the next day, the\nU.S. attorney or the D.A. thinks: I'm going to indict\nthe ringleaders, and the rest -- you know, the rest we\nare just going to let go; they will forfeit their bond.\nHow is that handled? How is it handled under your rule?\nHow is that handled generally? How should it be\nhandled?\nMS. SPINELLI: How is it handled with\nrespect to the persons who were indicted?\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. No. That's easy.\nMS. SPINELLI: Or how is it --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean -- I'm talking about\nthe people who nobody ever intends to prosecute. What's\ngoing to happen, as I think happens quite often, they\nare brought to the station, they are arrested, they are\nreleased on bond, and then everybody forgets about it.\nMS. SPINELLI: If there are --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Or they're -- or the D.A.\nsays, you know, forfeit -- like a traffic ticket or\nsomething -- forfeit your bond. And I want to know how\nthat's handled under your rule, how is it handled now,\nhow is it handled in the -- discuss it, please.\nMS. SPINELLI: If a person is arrested,\nbrought to the station house, and then released prior to\nthe initial appearance, which is actually a --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, you see what I'm\ndoing. I'm trying to make it comparable. What happens\nthere is that these 500 people brought down to the\nstation, they are required to put up bail; they are\ngiven a warning because people might question them; they\nare given a warning; they are then released. And\nnothing further is heard. Maybe three months later,\nthey come in and they agree that they'll forfeit their\nbond.\nNow, that's what I'm wondering. That must\nhappen, because I think there are lots of\ndemonstrations; they occur sometimes. I suspect it\nhappens. How is it handled, if you know?\nMS. SPINELLI: It happens quite frequently,\nJustice Breyer, that persons are arrested, brought to\nthe station house, and then released by the police\nwithout undergoing an initial appearance. And in that\ncircumstance, we don't contend that a prosecution would\nhave begun.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why not, if they\ninitiate charges against them? You're saying, in\nJustice Breyer's hypothetical, you're charged with, for\nexample, trespassing or conducting a demonstration on\nthe court grounds, and that's a crime. You're charged\nwith that, but we are not going to hold you, so, you\nknow, come back in a month.\nMS. SPINELLI: Well, it -- it might depend\non the manner in which the charges are conveyed or\nfiled. If all that happens is that the police tell you,\nyou know, we believe you've committed a crime, certainly\nthat doesn't commence a prosecution. If there is a\nformal -- you know, as happens in misdemeanor\nprosecutions, if there is a formal complaint filed which\ncan be the basis for a conviction in a misdemeanor case,\nthen it may be that, by analogy to an indictment in a\nfelony case, a prosecution would commence at that point.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what about my\ntraffic ticket?\nMS. SPINELLI: I don't believe --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I've never had one so I\ndon't know what they say.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Other members of the Court\ncan advise me about that.\nMS. SPINELLI: I believe -- I believe a\nticket or a citation of that nature would not commence\nadversary judicial proceedings because it's analogous to\na warrantless arrest.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why doesn't it solve your\n-- the problem that you're obviously wrestling with, if\n-- if we simply said there is a right to counsel, but it\ndoesn't attach until there's a significant stage of the\nprosecution which then follows? I mean, if you have\nsome proceeding afterwards, yes, then you do need a\nlawyer, but the mere fact that you've been brought to\nthe courthouse and made bail and let go does not require\n500 counsel to be provided. Only -- only when there is\nsome later proceeding, which is an essential part of the\nprosecution, must you have counsel.\nMS. SPINELLI: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why wouldn't that solve the\nproblem?\nMS. SPINELLI: First of all, we agree that a\nprosecution commences upon a first appearance before a\njudge --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's fine, but --\nMS. SPINELLI: Not merely --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you only need counsel\nat significant phases.\nMS. SPINELLI: Oh, right. And we are not\ncontending that counsel must be present at that initial\nappearance itself.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMS. SPINELLI: So just to be clear about\nthat. But to address your question, which, again, I\nbelieve goes to Respondent's alternative ground for\naffirmance --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but it's so wrapped up\nwith how we decide this case. I mean, if I think that\ncounsel has to be appointed right away for -- for\nJustice Breyer's 500 demonstrators, I'm going to give a\ndifferent answer to the first question. But if I know\nthat counsel doesn't have to be appointed until the\nprosecution proceeds to some significant phase where an\nattorney would be -- would be really helpful, then --\nthen I can -- I can be quite more sympathetic to your --\nto your argument.\nMS. SPINELLI: Well, were the Court to reach\nthat alternative argument, which is that -- despite the\nfact that a criminal prosecution had commenced, and\nRothgery was an accused, by hypothesis he nevertheless\nwas not entitled to the assistance of counsel for his\ndefense because no critical stage had been reached -- we\nwould say, first of all, assuming that Respondent is\ncorrect, that the right to counsel lies dormant\nfollowing its attachment on the commencement of a\ncriminal prosecution until some subsequent critical\nstage is reached, if we assume that that is correct,\nthere was such a stage here because Mr. Rothgery was\nfaced with the decision whether or not to invoke his\nright to an examining trial.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that was at the\nmagistration, and you -- you have said that there was no\nright to counsel at the magistration.\nMS. SPINELLI: That's correct, Justice\nGinsburg, but his decision regarding the examining trial\nwas not one that needed to be made at the magistration.\nRather, this was a right that he possessed to contest\nthe accusation against him under Texas law, which could\nonly be exercised prior to indictment. And, indeed, it\nwas a --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Any time prior -- any\ntime prior to indictment?\nMS. SPINELLI: Correct. And, indeed --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So you're saying that\nthat is the critical stage that he needed to have\ncounsel's advice about.\nMS. SPINELLI: To the extent that it's\nnecessary to have a critical stage, then we believe that\nis a critical stage.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that stage would arise\nimmediately as soon as the magistration was completed,\nright?\nMS. SPINELLI: His right --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He'd have to have counsel\nappointed immediately --\nMS. SPINELLI: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- to advise him whether to\nask for this hearing or not.\nMS. SPINELLI: Not necessarily immediately,\nbut within some reasonable time after his request, and\nafter he had demonstrated --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Before he said no, I\ndon't want an examining trial. As soon as he says that,\nthen he can have one, and you're saying he should have\nhad a lawyer before he said that?\nMS. SPINELLI: Well, I mean, had he said --\nhad he waived his right to an examining trial, which he\ndidn't do, then, you know, under -- then we would not\nhave --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But he could do it;\nanyone else could do it. And you would say, once he\ndoes that, he's made it into a critical proceeding, and\nso you have to have counsel before he gives up that\nright?\nMS. SPINELLI: Yes. We're contending that\nin felony cases -- this is only an issue in felony cases\n-- because Texas has provided this right, which is\nprecisely for defendants in Rothgery's situation, who\nare innocent but --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then -- but\nthen you are saying that he has a right to counsel at\nthe magistration, because that's when the magistrate\nsays: Look, you have an examining trial coming up, and\nyou can waive your right to that.\nMS. SPINELLI: No. That's actually not\ncorrect, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What does he say\nabout the examining --\nMS. SPINELLI: At a magistration --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What does he say\nabout an examining --\nMS. SPINELLI: Precisely what he said and\nwhat appears on the warning form is: In a felony case,\nyou have a right to an examining trial. There is no\nprovision at the magistration for the defendant to\neither invoke or waive that right. And there's no\nindication that any further explanation of that right is\ngiven.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you know any other case\nin which we've held that it's a critical stage of the\nproceeding where nothing has happened, but something\ncould have happened if the defendant had asked for it?\nMS. SPINELLI: Well, we're not contending\nthat.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't -- I find it hard\nto describe that as a critical stage of the proceeding.\nMS. SPINELLI: We're not contending that,\nJustice Scalia. Our contention is that the examining\ntrial, this Court has already held in Coleman, is a\ncritical stage.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: When the trial occurs, it\nis a critical stage.\nMS. SPINELLI: Correct. Correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I have no doubt.\nMS. SPINELLI: And --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you're claiming that\nhis decision of whether to ask for that or not is a\ncritical stage. And I just don't know any precedent for\nsaying that something that hasn't happened is a critical\nstage.\nMS. SPINELLI: I think the strongest\nprecedent for that is Estelle versus Smith, in which\nthis Court held that counsel -- counsel's assistance is\nneeded not only to conduct and prepare for critical\nstages, but also to assist a defendant in deciding\nwhether to undergo them.\nAnd more broadly, this Court has repeatedly\nstated that one of the core purposes of the right to\ncounsel is to ensure that the defendant understands and\nis able to invoke all of his rights. And in this case,\nthis was the right that he possessed that could have\nenabled him to demonstrate his innocence prior to being\nindicted, rearrested, and incarcerated. And he lost\nthat right because he didn't have counsel's help.\nWith the Court's permission, I'll reserve\nthe balance of my time.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I know -- when we were\ntalking about traffic tickets, you said, well, that was\na warrantless arrest. This was a warrantless arrest.\nMS. SPINELLI: This was a warrantless\narrest, but following that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And then --\nMS. SPINELLI: But there was more, because\nfollowing that, there was -- the magistration occurred,\nat which time the police officer filed an affidavit\nsetting forth the basis of the charges. The magistrate\nfound probable cause, and the magistrate officially\ninformed Rothgery of the accusation against him. And\nthat's why -- that's why -- in Kirby, this Court held\nthis a warrantless arrest does not commence adversary\njudicial proceedings; in Jackson, on exactly these\nfacts, the Court held that it does.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, not exactly\nthese facts, because in Jackson the prosecutor had\nalready filed charges.\nMS. SPINELLI: Charges were filed in Jackson\nin exactly the same sense that charges were filed here.\nA document which contained basically simply a factual\nstatement of what had occurred --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the prosecutor\nwasn't involved here. The prosecutor was involved in\nJackson.\nMS. SPINELLI: That's correct, but we don't\nbelieve that should make any difference because the\neffect on the Defendant of this proceeding is precisely\nthe same, whether or not a prosecutor is involved. And\nthat's true in general and it's true under Texas law.\nEither way he's faced with a need to negotiate criminal\nlaw in order to contest the charges against him. He has\na right to do so under Texas law, and he has a right to\nhave the prosecution against him dismissed if an\nindictment isn't filed within a set period. All of\nwhich we believe demonstrate that he was accused and\nthat a prosecution had commenced.\nMay I reserve the balance of my time?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. Thank you,\ncounsel.\nMr. Coleman.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY S. COLEMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. COLEMAN: Good morning, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\nThe magistration that follows every Texas\narrest does not begin a criminal prosecution under the\nSixth Amendment. When Rothgery was magistrated, no\nformal charges had been filed against him; no one\nattempted to elicit incriminating information from him;\nno witnesses were presented --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Then how could they hold\nthem in jail?\nMR. COLEMAN: It is not uncommon -- in fact,\nit's universal practice that when one is arrested on a\n-- without a warrant, it is normally because a police\nofficer sees an individual in the commission of a crime.\nIt's not uncommon to go and to arrest that person, to\ncease the crime that is taking place and perhaps to\nprevent other crimes from taking place, and to present\nthem. Gerstein makes clear that this happens all of the\ntime.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What happens in Texas?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: He was held after he saw\nthe magistrate. Suppose he had been held for three\nmonths and you couldn't make bail, we don't need\ncounsel?\nMR. COLEMAN: Texas statute allows for\ncounsel under that situation. But this is an issue that\nis addressed primarily by the Fourth Amendment.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I am asking what the\nconstitutional rule is.\nMR. COLEMAN: The Fourth --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: We have here a proceeding\nbefore a magistrate; this results in custody. And my\nquestion is, suppose this were weeks, would counsel be\nrequired to be appointed?\nMR. COLEMAN: No, Your Honor. The Fourth --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What authority do you have\nto hold somebody who's not been charged? I mean I don't\nunderstand that. You say he hasn't been charged, but\nwe're going to hold you in jail. That's very strange.\nMR. COLEMAN: We believe that this is an\nissue that was addressed by the Court in Gerstein and\nMcLaughlin, that the Fourth Amendment prevents\nunreasonable seizures and the Sixth Amendment speedy\ntrial rights kick in. And so there is a limit on what\ntype of a seizure that can you have.\nAnd the Fourth Amendment does prevent that,\nas do other rights, and as the Court recognized in\nGouveia. But the liberty interest that is at stake\nthere, as the Court said in Gouveia, is not one that\nimplicates the Sixth Amendment right to counsel. If\nthere are other --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What you're saying, in\nanswer to Justice Kennedy's question, that an individual\ncan be brought into court, held in jail for three weeks\nwithout charge, and no right to counsel applies? I\nthink that's your answer, but I want to make sure. I'll\nbe candid to say I'm surprised. But if that's your\nposition, I want to make sure I understand it.\nMR. COLEMAN: Gerstein says that there must\nbe --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I want to know what your\nanswer is here. Get to authority later, but I want to\nknow whether your position is that an individual may be\nbrought by a police officer before a magistrate, charged\nwith no crime, required to post bail, and if he doesn't\npost bail, be held for three weeks without charge.\nMR. COLEMAN: That could not happen in\nTexas.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I'm not asking whether it\ncould happen; I'm asking whether it would be\nconstitutional without appointing counsel.\nMR. COLEMAN: It would be -- not be a\nviolation of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it would be a\nviolation of some liberty interest beside the Sixth\nAmendment.\nMR. COLEMAN: It might well be a violation\nof the Fourth Amendment or other Sixth Amendment --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No counsel right would\nattach?\nNo counsel right would attach?\nMR. COLEMAN: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think it's a problem even\nif you appoint counsel. You say you can keep people\nwithout charging them so long as you give them counsel?\nMR. COLEMAN: It happens all the time,\nJustice Scalia, where people are appointed counsel but,\nfor whatever reason, do not make bail and --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But they didn't -- they\ndon't --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Without charges filed? In\nother words, if the lawyer comes in and says, you know,\nmy client is sitting in jail, you've had him there for\nthree days now, and no complaint has been filed against\nhim, we don't know why he is being held -- your answer\n-- the -- it's a constitutional answer to say, well, you\nknow, that's for us to know and you to find out?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. COLEMAN: I think Gerstein would prevent\nthat, Justice Souter.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, the answer\n-- your answer is that the Sixth Amendment is concerned\nwith the fair trial, not the detention of individuals,\nand he has other constitutional rights that would be\nimplicated, but his right to a fair trial is not one of\nthem.\nMR. COLEMAN: That's absolutely true here.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is the law here in\nTexas in respect to this particular magistration\nproceeding? I noticed what happened is that the\nmagistrate tells the person arrested, he says precisely:\n\"I find probable cause to believe\" that you -- \"that\nthere was probable cause to arrest you.\" That's what\nthey say, right? It said: \"I have determined that\nprobable cause existed for the arrest of the individual\naccused therein.\"\nAll right. Now, what happens -- and I think\nit would be helpful to know the answer to this -- in\nwhat might be a rare instance, but the truth of the\nmatter is there was probable cause to arrest that\nindividual when he was arrested, but there isn't now.\nSo because he came in -- you know, he said here's 14\ncousins, I was somewhere else at the time, they all\nagree. I mean, everybody agrees on a certain fact that\nmeans there isn't now. And what I'm driving at is does\nthe magistrate here -- is he required, does he have the\npower to commit someone, even though he honestly\nbelieves there is no longer probable cause, in which\ncase he is making the decision, the magistrate, not the\npoliceman?\nMR. COLEMAN: I don't know the answer to the\nconstitutional significance of the different --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I could -- I can think\nthere would be tremendous constitutional significance\nand it would make a difference if all that's really\nhappening is a policeman is arresting someone, in which\ncase we might have liberty interests and others at\nissue. But what's happening in this proceeding is that\nthe magistrate is deciding that there is probable cause\nto hold him, in which case it's more like, not\ncompletely like, but more like what happens in an\nindictment or an arraignment, et cetera.\nMR. COLEMAN: What is stated on the form --\ncertainly I can't say what was going through the\nmagistrate's mind.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. But I want to know\nwhat's Texas law, if you know it, in respect to that\nquestion?\nMR. COLEMAN: The answer I believe is that\nyou -- that you find that there is probable cause to\nmake the arrest.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So we have a magistrate who\nhas to find that there is -- no, to make the arrest or\nto hold him now? Do you see what I'm doing?\nMR. COLEMAN: I do see what you're doing.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Do you see why I'm doing\nit? So, what's the answer, if you know?\nMR. COLEMAN: I don't think that there is a\ndifference in this case. I think --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, I know there may not\nbe, but what about in general.\nMR. COLEMAN: Magistrates have a great\namount of discretion, and I think if a magistrate was\nconvinced that probable cause existed at the time of\narrest and not now, it's quite likely the magistrate\nwould find --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. That's what I would\nthink. In which case we have before us bringing this\nperson before a State official who himself has the power\nto decide if there is probable cause to hold him, and he\nis saying, yes, there is probable cause to hold him.\nThat's -- that's what's happening; is that right?\nMR. COLEMAN: I believe so. That's exactly\nwhat the Court required in Gerstein, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Thank you.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Coleman, may I just\nask this kind of simple question. If the prosecutor had\nparticipated in the magistration, then under Texas law\nwould the right to counsel have arisen?\nMR. COLEMAN: No, Justice Stevens.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Whether the prosecutor\nparticipates is not relevant?\nMR. COLEMAN: There is no role for a\nprosecutor at a magistration under Article 1517 of the\nTexas Code of Criminal Procedure.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, couldn't he\npoint out -- I mean, if this is a probable cause\ndetermination and he knows a particular fact, couldn't\nhe say, well, Magistrate, you should know this, and the\nmagistrate would say, well, I didn't know that, so\nthere's no probable cause?\nMR. COLEMAN: That's possible.\nAnd I would like to amend my answer to you,\nJustice Stevens. It's not at all uncommon -- once an\narrest takes place and an officer can go and present a\ncase to the county or district attorney, it's not\nuncommon at all for charges then to be filed in the --\ndepending on what the crime, is in the district court or\ncounty court, and for the magistration then to be moved\nover and to take place in an official court. And so at\nthat time, it could very well be.\nAnd we would say -- we would say likely at\nthat point that, yes, that formal criminal judicial\nproceedings had initiated, and it's not uncommon. But\nin this circumstance --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What about the very\nproceeding in this case? Supposing instead of a\ndetective bringing in the affidavit, that the prosecutor\ndid it, had the detective's affidavit, and the\nprosecutor said: This is a case we intend to pursue\nmore seriously. That's all he says to the judge. Would\nhave that been sufficient?\nMR. COLEMAN: No, Justice Stevens.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It would not?\nMR. COLEMAN: An expression of subjective --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I got the impression from\nthe briefs that the absence or presence of the\nprosecutor made a difference. But you're telling me I'm\nwrong under that?\nMR. COLEMAN: Under the circumstances where\nno formal charges have been brought, a statement by a\nprosecutor that they are looking at it or that they\nintend to bring some is not itself the initiation of\nformal adversary judicial proceedings.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Coleman, what happens\nin other jurisdictions? I probably ought to know this,\nbut I don't. Maybe you do. When you don't have a\nprocedure called magistration, but someone is taken\nbefore a magistrate and with the prosecutor present, is\nthe indictment at that point drawn up, or doesn't the --\ndoesn't the prosecutor have some time to decide what the\nindictment ought to contain? What -- what happens at\nthat point?\nMR. COLEMAN: An indictment does usually\ntake a little bit more time because it has to be taken\nand presented to a grand jury.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So what happens in the\ninterim? Is he -- is he charged in the interim, or is\nhe just held because he is going to be charged, which is\nwhat's going on here.\nMR. COLEMAN: He is not charged during that\ninterim. But you can have --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You mean no complaint needs\nto be filed by the police? If the magistrate says,\nwhat's this guy doing here, don't the police normally\nhave a complaint, in this case a -- what was it, a\npossession of a gun by a felon, say, you know, we're\nfiling this complaint that charges him with possessing a\ngun with a felony record? And wasn't there such a\ncomplaint displayed here?\nMR. COLEMAN: No, Justice Souter. Texas\nstatutes do allow for the filing of a complaint in some\ncircumstances. It's not frequently used. But that's a\ncomplaint that has to be filed in the district court or\nin the justice of the peace court.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What was filed by the\npolice? What was filed by the police --\nMR. COLEMAN: Nothing was filed.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- to justify holding\nthis person? You can't just say the police brought\nsomeone in and they get locked up in jail. The police\nhad to present something --\nMR. COLEMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- to show probable cause\nand it was the burden of the State in the presence of\nthe police officer to prove probable cause. So that had\nto be based on something. What was it based on?\nMR. COLEMAN: It was based on the officer's\naffidavit of probable cause, which was presented at the\nlittle glass window to the magistrate and --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And then -- and then the\ndefendant was told or was given Miranda warnings. What\nwas said to him precisely about right to counsel in the\nwarnings that the magistrate gave him?\nMR. COLEMAN: Well, the warnings go through.\nThey are very similar to Miranda warnings. He is told\nthat he has a right to counsel under Texas statute for\nthis. He is -- he is warned, as Ms. Spinelli said,\nabout examining trial. There is a list of things --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. But if he is\ntold -- the defendant is listening to this. And,\nmagistrate, you just told me I have a right to counsel.\nOkay, I would like counsel. And then the magistrate\nsays, no you're not entitled to counsel?\nMR. COLEMAN: I don't think that's what\nwould happen. I think if he had insisted on counsel\nbeing present for the bail portion of the 1517\nmagistration, I believe that they would have gotten\nsomebody to come and --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Would they have been\nobligated to get somebody to come?\nMR. COLEMAN: Under Texas statute they\nwould.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Under the Sixth Amendment?\nMR. COLEMAN: No.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Suppose Texas law provided\nthat there had to be an examining trial within a certain\nperiod of time after the magistration unless there was\nan intervening indictment. Then would you not agree\nthat under those circumstances the defendant would have\nbeen entitled to the appointment of counsel shortly\nafter the magistration, at least in order to prepare for\nthe examining trial?\nMR. COLEMAN: We completely agree that if\nthat were the case, Coleman -- this Court's decisions\nmake absolutely clear he would have been entitled to\ncounsel for an examining trial and would have been -- we\nwould have been obligated and would have appointed\ncounsel at a reasonable time before that examining trial\nso that the preparations could take place.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why would the situation be\ndifferent simply because Texas law doesn't require the\nexamining trial, but gives the defendant the option of\ndemanding one?\nMR. COLEMAN: Because there is no prejudice\nto your fair trial rights from not choosing to have an\nexamining trial. We are unaware of any case that has\nsaid that there is a Sixth Amendment right to consult\nwith counsel before deciding whether to ask for an\nexamining trial. And in fact, in Texas they are very\nrare because in the very unusual circumstances where\nsomebody asks for one, more often than not the\nprosecutor will simply hurry up and do an indictment.\nAnd so there will be no examining trial that takes\nplace. And that's a put up or shut up procedure, but\nit's not something that prejudices your fair trial\nrights if no examining trial actually takes place.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If we said that when a\ndefendant is ordered held in custody, that there is then\na right of counsel, would we be contradicting any of our\nprecedents as opposed, say, to extending them?\nMR. COLEMAN: I certainly do believe that\nthe court would. I believe that a decision that the\nright attaches, that there is an initiation of formal\njudicial proceedings at the magistration, would\ncontradict not only Kirby, but also Gerstein and\nGouveia.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well -- no. But my\nassumption was assuming that the defendant is remanded\nto custody. I added that.\nMR. COLEMAN: It's not clear to me that that\nmakes a constitutional difference in our circumstances.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose you were to say\nthat where the State arrests an individual, brings him\nbefore a neutral official and intends and does impose a\nsignificant restraint on his liberty for the purpose of\nbringing that individual to trial, there is a\npresumption that that -- forget the presumption. If\nthat happens for the purpose, the primary purpose,\nprimary purpose of bringing the individual to trial, at\nthat point the Sixth Amendment right attaches.\nNow, the State would not have to give him a\nlawyer if there was some other purpose primary, for\nexample, as in Gouveia, keeping the prisons safe.\nFor example, it's quite clear under the\ncircumstances, there are 14 people accused, they\ncouldn't have all have done it, they want to investigate\nfurther. Or maybe there are other examples. But, for\nthe primary purpose, then the right attaches.\nSo you pick up Gerstein and add to Gerstein\nthat additional requirement. What about that? What\nharm would that cause? What inconvenience would it\ncause, what difficulties, et cetera?\nMR. COLEMAN: I -- I think the primary issue\nwith that, Justice Breyer, is that it contradicts what\nthe Court said in Gouveia. The Court went through a\nlengthy exegesis in Gouveia about what interests in\nparticular are protected and talked about this, this\nexpression of a concern about our liberty interests; and\nthat the purpose issue was not something that the Court\naddressed there.\nIt simply said that our Fourth Amendment\nprecedents go to the liberty interests. Our Sixth\nAmendment speedy-trial and other precedents go to the\nliberty interests.\nThe right to counsel is not specifically a\nliberty-interest protection. It is something, as Chief\nJustice Roberts mentioned a few minutes ago as we set\nout in our brief, something that protects your right to\na fair trial. And there are -- there are proceedings\nthat take place along the way that the Court has held\nare critical stages, and we need and want counsel to be\npresent for them, and so we have so dictated. But\ngetting behind --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought you -- I\nthought you recognized that if he had opted to have this\nexamining trial to determine whether there really was\nprobable cause, that he would be entitled to counsel at\nthat examining trial. And, yet, that's detached from\nthe fair trial. The whole purpose of it is that they\nwill never get to trial.\nMR. COLEMAN: No. I -- I disagree with\nthat. Coleman itself says that the reason we're\nrequiring counsel for a preliminary hearing or an\nexamining trial, as we call it in Texas, is precisely\nbecause there will be witnesses, there will be arguments\nmade; and you could waive defenses if not made there;\nthat this is very important. So we're going to define\neven, this examining trial or preliminary hearing, even\nthough it comes before an indictment, we're going to\ndefine that as an event of attachment solely because\nyour right to a fair trial could very much be prejudiced\nthere.\nAnd that -- that doesn't exist in this case,\nand that certainly the failure to ask for a examining\ntrial does not prejudice your right to a fair trial.\nJustice Breyer, you asked a hypothetical\nthat I would like -- I would like to address because it\nis something that happens all the time, and I think\nshould inform the Court's decision here. And, that is,\nit is not uncommon, and some statistics that I have seen\nsuggest that it may happen in half of the cases, where\nan individual is arrested, magistrated, released, and no\ncharges are ever brought. So the bulk of your 500\nprotesters are never brought.\nUnder Mr. Rothgery's view of the Sixth\nAmendment, the county -- you know, let's say somebody is\nprotesting whitetail deer hunting in Gillespie County.\nThe county would be required to appoint counsel for all\nof those individuals even though --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Only if they ask for them.\nOnly if they ask for the lawyer.\nMR. COLEMAN: If they ask for them.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That's why I wondered --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And that would be subject,\nwouldn't it, to sort of a condition subsequent, because\nif it turned out -- I mean we -- no counsel is required\nif there's no incarceration. So that even if the right\nhad attached, if it turned out later that there was no\nincarceration or even attempt to incarcerate, then that\nwould relate back, and there wouldn't be a Sixth\nAmendment violation. Isn't that right? Wouldn't that\nbe the answer to the -- a partial answer?\nMR. COLEMAN: If -- if the court were to\nmake a rule that depended solely on incarceration, that\nis true. I don't understand Mr. Rothgery to be making\nthat argument because he was released on bond.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And you couldn't -- you\ncouldn't because of the fact that bail -- if you're\ngoing to insist on bail, that in effect is\nincarceration. But the reason I asked the question,\nwhich I would ask you the same, is there are a lot of\nStates, we're told, that do have counsel attach in\ncircumstances similar to this.\nSo they must have some way of dealing with\nthe problem that I raised if it's really a problem. And\nI want to -- and that's -- and I want to -- if we're\ngoing into this, I think I need to know how this is\ndealt with.\nMR. COLEMAN: That amicus brief attempts to\nsuggest that Texas's statute is very different from\nstatutes that exist in other cases -- in other States,\nand that's simply not true, Your Honor.\nI do not understand what happens in each of\nthose -- in each of those States, but I have at least\nseen decisions in some of those States that suggest that\nthey don't act that much differently than we do, and\nthat -- that they do apply a critical-stage-type\nanalysis in evaluating --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You see, you would have\ngiven him a counsel. I mean, in fact, if he had wanted\none, Texas would give him one. So Texas must have -- it\nmust not be a problem. The problem, I just --\nMR. COLEMAN: You mean at the magistration?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. COLEMAN: If he would have asked for\none, he would have gotten one.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So the problem I raise\ncan't be a real problem.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask on Texas\nprocedure. Supposing after the magistration he wanted\nto have the charges dismissed. Could he have hired a\nlawyer to come in and ask the judge to dismiss the\ncharges?\nMR. COLEMAN: Absolutely not, Justice\nStevens. There were no charges pending. This -- this\nmagistration that occurs in the jail is simply --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let's say he wanted to get\na release from bond and said he wanted to terminate his\ncustody. Is there any procedure whatsoever available to\na defendant to say: I want to get this monkey off my\nback after this bond premium?\nMR. COLEMAN: A release from bond, it would\nhave theoretically been possible, yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And could he have a lawyer\nappear before the Court to ask for that?\nMR. COLEMAN: I don't --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Could the judge say: You\ngot to appear yourself?\nMR. COLEMAN: I don't think the judge would\nhave said: You have to appear yourself. I think he\ncould have personally come forth --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If the prosecutor said:\nYou are not entitled to a lawyer, wouldn't the judge\nhave said: You're crazy; of course, he is entitled to a\nlawyer to come in for this proceeding?\nMR. COLEMAN: Well, that's an issue that\ndoesn't come up because judges don't exclude --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: We are talking about\ntheoretical problems here, and the question is whether\nhe would he have had a right to a lawyer asking him to\nget released from bond. Twenty minutes after the first\nproceeding ended his father hired a lawyer and brought\nhim in. Would the lawyer have been allowed to appear?\nMR. COLEMAN: The difference between the\nSixth Amendment strict requirements and practicalities\nis a significant one. I don't think the Sixth Amendment\nwould necessarily have required it. The -- I am aware\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Even though he is paying\nfor his own lawyer?\nMR. COLEMAN: It is the same as every other\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That's your answer?\nMR. COLEMAN: -- situation.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: He would not have had a\nright under the Constitution to have a lawyer come in\nand say: I want to get released from this bond. I find\nthat hard to believe.\nMR. COLEMAN: He would have -- he would have\nthe same rights as anybody else, whether retained or --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It would not include the\nright to be represented by counsel if I understand you\ncorrectly.\nMR. COLEMAN: It would not be a Sixth\nAmendment right to counsel. There could be a right if\nyou otherwise have a lawyer; that the State cannot\nexclude that lawyer from participating on your behalf.\nBut it would not be an \"attachment,\" an \"appointment\"\nissue, where you are entitled to appointment of counsel\nto do that.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose that he is out on\nbail, but he has a suspicion that this alleged felony --\nthat that wasn't cricket because it was expunged. So he\nsays to the judge: Judge, I want to contest my being\nheld to some kind of criminal process because there is\nno basis for the charge.\nSo he is out on bail. He has no lawyer, but\nhe wants to contest the State's right to hold him at\nall, and he asks for a lawyer to help him do that.\nMR. COLEMAN: I think if -- if he were to\nask somebody, he would be told that you can ask for an\nexamining trial. If you ask for that, we will appoint\nyou a lawyer; and you will have your examining trial\nunless the State decides to indict before we actually\nget to it.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why is the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Now -- no, please.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why is the question of\nwhether the right attaches, which seems to mean\ndifferent things in different situations, a separate\nquestion from what I would think would be the question\nhere: Whether he had the right to have counsel\nappointed for him.\nWhy isn't that the question, and\n\"attachment\" is simply a label that is used to express\none of the conditions for having the right to appoint a\ncounsel?\nMR. COLEMAN: I have given this great\nthought, Justice Alito. In my mind, the only doctrinal\ndifference it really makes is the situation that this\nCourt has described in Michigan v. Jackson, which I have\npreviously addressed in the Cobb case which I argued.\nBut in most other circumstances we think\nthat the analysis is essentially the same, because the\nCourt has never said that there isn't a right -- there\nis a right to have the assistance of counsel without\nhaving a critical stage.\nIn fact, I believe Justice Brennan -- if you\nwill allow me 15 seconds -- Justice Brennan's decision\nin Maine v. Moulton said: \"Recognizing that the right\nto the assistance of counsel is shaped by the need for\nthe assistance of counsel, we have found that the right\nattaches at earlier critical stages in the criminal\njustice process where the results might well settle the\naccused's fate and reduce the trial, itself, to a mere\nformality.\"\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it then episodic?\nThat is, if the right is turned on when there is a\ncritical event, and then the critical event is over, and\nno more right to counsel until the next critical event?\nIt's not -- you have no right to counsel in between\nthose critical events?\nMR. COLEMAN: Once -- once a case gets\ngoing, I don't believe this Court has ever been\npresented with a case where there has been attachment,\nthere have been some critical stages, and then the State\nhas decided to deny access. And we don't think that the\nCourt would like --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So you only need this one\ncritical stage, and then you get appointed counsel at\nthat stage, and that counsel will continue thereafter.\nYou don't have to --\nMR. COLEMAN: That is the usual course of\nthings.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you give me -- can you\ngive me some idea, or some empirical assessment, or tell\nme where I could go to find out, as we sit here, how\nmany people are being held in custody after a\nprobable-cause determination and do not have counsel\nappointed for them and do not have the right to have\ncounsel appointed to them until some other critical\nphase takes place?\nMR. COLEMAN: In Texas, because the Fair\nDefense Act permits the appointment of counsel for those\nwho are held in custody, all persons who request counsel\nare appointed counsel within one business day in the\nlarge counties and within one -- within three business\ndays in the smaller counties. And so that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So then there was just a\nmisapplication of the statute here when this man was\nheld for three days, and then he requested counsel?\nMR. COLEMAN: No. Section 1.051(j)\nauthorized the counties who went -- to not appoint\ncounsel when an individual is released on bail, and to\nawait -- to await the first critical stage or the\ninitiation of adversary judicial proceedings; whichever\noccurs first, it says. And so once this gentleman was\nindicted, that would disappear; and he would be entitled\nto counsel, as he was appointed counsel immediately upon\nindictment.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm talking about\nthe first phase before there was an indictment, just the\nprobable-cause phase. You say even then there is --\nunder this Texas statute there is a right to have\ncounsel in one day?\nMR. COLEMAN: The Texas statute authorizes\nappointment. Gillespie County is a smaller county, so\nit's three business days, Your Honor. Upon --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Then I am not sure why we\nare having this discussion.\nMR. COLEMAN: Well, because Mr. Rothgery was\nreleased on bail, and so the county was authorized not\nto appoint counsel.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If Mr. Rothgery had,\nimmediately upon being admitted to bail, said: I want a\n-- I was going to say a probable-cause hearing. You\nhave a different term for it.\nMR. COLEMAN: \"Examining trial.\"\nJUSTICE SOUTER: \"Examining trial.\"\nMR. COLEMAN: Right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: At that point, under Texas\nlaw, the right to counsel within one or three business\ndays would have attached?\nMR. COLEMAN: Once -- once an examining\ntrial is scheduled, I'm not sure there are one or two\ndays, but requests -- I think that's what would have\nhappened. The Constitution requires appointment of\ncounsel for an examining trial a reasonable time before\nthe examining trial to allow for preparation.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Now, at the -- may I? At\nthe examining trial, is there a charge filed?\nMR. COLEMAN: No. The examining trial,\nitself --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What are they finding\nprobable cause for if they don't know what the charge\nis?\nMR. COLEMAN: This Court in Coleman said\nthat the examining trial, because of the potential harm\nto a fair trial in the future, would define it as a --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but I realize if the --\nif somebody is going to demonstrate probable cause, the\nprobable cause has got to be probable cause to hold\nsomeone to answer for a particular charge. So why\nhasn't there, as a matter of definition, got to be a\ncharge, even on your reasoning, by the time the\nexamining trial is held?\nMR. COLEMAN: An examining trial is an\nextended version of a probable-cause determination. It\nis not holding on a charge --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That is right. It is a\nprobable-cause determination, and you've got to have an\nanswer: Probable cause for what?\nMR. COLEMAN: Probable cause that -- that a\ncrime has been committed.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So -- so, in other words,\nyou determine whether a crime has been committed without\ncharging the individual with the crime.\nMR. COLEMAN: If -- if that were the law,\nGerstein would have to be reversed.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I'm just asking what\nyou do. Is that the case? Is no charge filed? Then,\nat the end of the probable cause hearing you say: Well,\nwe -- the judge says: Well, you've got probable cause\nto hold this person for possessing a gun after having\nbeen convicted of a felony, but there doesn't happen to\nbe any charge to that effect here. Is that the state of\nthe law, in fact?\nMR. COLEMAN: That is what preliminary\nhearings and examining trials have always been about.\nYes, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nMs. Spinelli, you have three minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DANIELLE SPINELLI\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me that our\nprecedents do say, Gerstein versus Pugh, that the\nprobable-cause hearing is not an adversary proceeding\nwhere counsel is required; and if we are going to give\nyou relief, we have to go beyond what Gerstein says.\nMS. SPINELLI: I don't believe so, Justice\nKennedy. It's correct that Gerstein says that the\nprobable-cause determination made under Gerstein is not,\nitself, a critical stage, and we are not contending\notherwise.\nThe Gerstein determination is something\nseparate from the initial appearance that occurred here.\nA Gerstein determination is made for the purpose of\ndetermining whether there was probable cause for an\narrest. It can be made ex parte. It's essentially the\nequivalent of what happens prior to arrest when a\nmagistrate decides whether there is probable cause to\nissue a warrant.\nWhat happened here, by contrast, was after\narrest and after the police had decided to --\nMr. Rothgery, he was brought before a magistrate. He\nwas officially informed of the accusation against him,\nand at that time he acquired the right to contest the\naccusation against him in an examining trial, which we\nbelieve shows that he was accused within the meaning of\nthe Sixth Amendment, and a prosecution had begun.\nAnd we are not contending that that initial\nproceeding was, itself, a critical stage where counsel\nwas required; and it's not necessary to contend that in\norder to prevail on the point that that was when a\nprosecution commenced, which is the only question that\nwe believe is properly before this Court and the only\none we are asking it to resolve.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So Texas would be\nbetter off if they didn't have a magistration proceeding\nat all, if they didn't have a proceeding to alert the\nindividual of the charges against him; they did not have\na proceeding to read him his rights; they did not have a\ndetermination of probable cause. They would be better\noff if they didn't do any of that?\nMS. SPINELLI: Well, I mean I think you are\nsuggesting, Mr. Chief Justice, that reaffirming the rule\nadopted in Jackson would create, you know, a perverse\nincentive for States to do away with this proceeding. I\ndon't believe that that's the case because, as Justice\nBreyer observed, 45 jurisdictions already follow the\nrule of appointing counsel at, or immediately following,\nthe initial appearance, which the -- any CDL brief lays\nout and which neither Respondent nor its State amici\nhave contested.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what's in it\nfor the State to provide this additional layer?\nBecause, of course, the person gets Miranda warnings\nwhen he is arrested. And so why -- why should the State\ndo this?\nMS. SPINELLI: The initial appearance serves\na specific, substantive purpose which I think is well\ndescribed in the Seventh Circuit's decision in Armstrong\ncited on page 15 of our reply brief, which is this is\nthe proceeding at which the defendant is informed: You\nare now a criminal defendant. This is the accusation\nagainst you, and these are your rights as a defendant in\na criminal proceeding.\nAnd for that reason, as the Armstrong\ndecision says, it is commonly recognized across\njurisdictions as the inception of a formal prosecution,\nand we believe that's the rule that this Court has\nalready laid out in Brewer and Jackson and should\nreaffirm today.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why don't you take\nan extra minute? We have eaten up your rebuttal time.\nMS. SPINELLI: Of course, absolutely. I\nmean, just to respond to one other question that arose\nduring the course of Respondent's argument, I think it\nis important to understand that in Texas, as in other\njurisdictions, there are two phases in a felony\nprosecution.\nThere is an initial phase that commences in\na magistrate court where a document setting out the\ncharges will be filed either by the police or by a\nprosecutor, and the magistrate at that point has\njurisdiction over that criminal case. It is only later\nthat an indictment or information will be filed in the\ngeneral trial court with jurisdiction to enter final\njudgment.\nBut this Court has repeatedly rejected the\nnotion that a prosecution begins only in that second\nphase. It rejected it expressly in Moore. It rejected\nit in Coleman, in Brewer, in Jackson, and in statements\nin Kirby and McNeil. So that can't be the rule.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nMS. SPINELLI: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The case is\nsubmitted.\n(Whereupon, at 12:09 p.m., the case in the\nabove-entitled matter was submitted.)\n59:3 advise 19:4 answer 7:5 2:2,7 3:4,7 attach
