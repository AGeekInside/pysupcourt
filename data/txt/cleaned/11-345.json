        "content": "(11:04 a.m.)\nMR. REIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I get to say\nthat this is Case Number 11-345, Fisher against the\nUniversity of Texas at Austin. And you get to say --\nORAL ARGUMENT OF BERT W. REIN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. REIN: Mr. -- Mr. -- General Suter\ntrained me too well.\nMr. Chief Justice, and members of the Court,\nand may it please the Court:\nThe central issue here is whether the\nUniversity of Texas at Austin can carry its burden\napproving that its use of race as an admissions-plus\nfactor in the consequent denial of equal treatment,\nwhich is the central mandate of the Equal Protection\nClause, to Abigail Fisher met the two tests of strict\nscrutiny which are applicable.\nFirst --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Rein, before we get\nto that, because the Court is supposed to raise it on\nits own, the question of -- of standing. The injury --\nif the injury is rejection by the University of Texas,\nand the answer is, no matter what, this person would not\nhave been accepted, then how is the injury caused by the\naffirmative action program?\nMR. REIN: Well, Justice Ginsburg, the first\ninjury that was before the Court was the use of a system\nwhich denied equal treatment. It was a Constitutional\ninjury, and part of the damage claim was premised\ndirectly on the Constitutional issue.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How do you get past\nTexas v. Lesage with that injury --\nMR. REIN: Lesage --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- which says that mere\nuse of race is not cognizable injury sufficient for\nstanding.\nMR. REIN: Lesage was litigated on its\nmerits, and the question was whether Lesage could carry\nhis case when -- on summary judgment, when it was\napparent that his complaint, which was that he was\ndenied access to the graduate program at the University\nof Texas, was not sustainable.\nAs I said -- and there are several factors\nin this case that are quite different. First, there is\na Constitutional injury as such, and the Court has\nrecognized it.\nSecond, the fact premise, she could not have\nbeen allowed in under any circumstance, was never tested\nbelow, wasn't raised below. It comes up in a footnote\nin --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I go to another\nside? She's graduated.\nMR. REIN: Correct.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: She disclaimed the\ndesire, after her application, to go to the school at\nall. She was permitted to apply for the summer program\nand get in automatically, and she didn't, correct?\nMR. REIN: No, that's not correct,\nYour Honor. She -- she was not automatically admitted.\nShe was considered for the summer program and rejected.\nYou are talking about the CAP program, where\nshe could have attended a different university in the\nTexas system, and had she been able to achieve --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But she's graduated.\nMR. REIN: She has graduated.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Injunctive relief, she's\nnot going to get. So what measure of damages will she\nget or will she be entitled to?\nMR. REIN: Well, that issue, of course, is\nbifurcated, and we've reserved the ability to --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you have to claim an\ninjury. So what's the injury --\nMR. REIN: Well --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- that you're claiming\nthat would sustain a claim of damages?\nMR. REIN: The -- the denial of her right to\nequal treatment is a Constitutional injury in and of\nitself, and we had claimed certain damages on that.\nWe -- we started the case before it was clear whether\nshe would or wouldn't be admitted.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You still haven't\nanswered how Lesage gets away from that --\nMR. REIN: Well, Lesage --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- but if there's a --\ngive me another --\nMR. REIN: Well, I think --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- damages question.\nMR. REIN: On the -- if we then, on remand,\nwere to assert damages contingent upon the fact that she\nshould have been admitted to UT and was not admitted, we\nwould then have to prove that, but for the use of race,\nshe would be admitted. That's the thrust of Lesage.\nWhether we can prove it or can't prove it is\nsomething you can't tell on this record. It's merely\nasserted. And I would point out that Texas said below,\nthere was no way to determine that issue without --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What damages --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We've had cases involving\nalleged discrimination in state -- state contracting.\nAnd we haven't required the person who was discriminated\nagainst because of race to prove that he would have\ngotten the contract otherwise, have we?\nMR. REIN: No, sir.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's -- it's been enough\nthat there was a denial of equal protection.\nMR. REIN: That is our correct, and that is\nour first premise. And I would say that the same issue\nwas raised in Bakke. And in Bakke, the contention was\nhe couldn't have gotten into the medical school;\ntherefore, he has no case. The Court said, in footnote\n14 to Justice Powell's opinion, that's a matter of\nmerits; it is not a matter of standing.\nI think in -- in Parents Involved, the same\ntype of contention was made with respect to the\nLouisville class plaintiffs, whose son had been admitted\nto the school of his choice, and the Court said damages\nare enough to sustain standing. There is a live damages\nclaim here, and I don't think there is a question of\nstanding.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Her claim is not\nnecessarily that she would have been -- would have been\nadmitted, but that she was denied a fair chance in the\nadmission lottery. Just as when a person is denied\nparticipation in the contracting lottery, he has\nsuffered an injury.\nMR. REIN: Yes, Justice Scalia, I agree with\nthat.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If you are going to the --\nto the merits, I want to know whether you want us to --\nor are asking us to overrule Grutter. Grutter said it\nwould be good law for at least 25 years. And I know\nthat time flies, but I think only nine of those years\nhave passed.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: And so, are you? And, if\nso, why overrule a case into which so much thought and\neffort went and so many people across the country have\ndepended on?\nMR. REIN: Justice Breyer, we had said, very\ncarefully, we were not trying to change the Court's\ndisposition of the issue in Grutter. Could there be a\nlegitimate -- a compelling interest in -- in moving --\nin using race to establish a diverse class.\nWhat -- the problem that we've encountered\nthroughout the case is there are varying understandings,\nnot of the legitimacy of the interest, but how you get\nthere; is it necessary to use race to achieve that\ninterest; what does a critical mass --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So your question is\nwhether -- your point is does your case satisfy Grutter?\nIs that what you're arguing?\nMR. REIN: We litigated it on that basis,\nyes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, how do you want to\nargue it right now in the next ten minutes? I'm\ninterested because I have a very short time to get my\nquestion out, and I need to know how you are going to\nargue it.\nMR. REIN: Well, Justice Breyer, our\nargument is we can satisfy Grutter if it's properly\nread. What we've seen --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask you on that\nspecifically, let's take away the 10 percent solution.\nSuppose the only plan were the one that is before the\nCourt now, no 10 percent. This is the exclusive way\nthat the University is attempting to increase minority\nenrollment.\nThen, if we had no 10 percent solution,\nunder Grutter, would this plan be acceptable?\nMR. REIN: Well, I think that there would be\nflaws under Grutter, even if you assumed away something\nthat can't be assumed away because it is a matter of\nTexas law, that is, there is a top 10 percent program,\nand that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, then the -- the\nquestion is can you have both? But it seems to me that\nthis program is certainly no more aggressive than the\none in -- in Grutter; it's more -- in fact, more modest.\nMR. REIN: Well, I don't agree with that,\nand let me explain why.\nIn order to satisfy Grutter, you first have\nto say that you are not just using race gratuitously,\nbut it is in the interest of producing a critical mass\nof otherwise underrepresented students. And so to -- to\nbe within Grutter framework, the first question is,\nabsent the use of race, would we be generating a\ncritical mass?\nTo answer that question, you start -- you've\ngot to examine in context the so-called soft factors\nthat are in Grutter -- you know, are -- is there an\nisolation on campus? Do members of minority feel that\nthey cannot speak out?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The one social studies\nthat this University did said that minority students,\noverwhelmingly, even with the numbers they have now, are\nfeeling isolated. So what do -- why isn't that even\nunder your test?\nWe can go back to whether substantial\nevidence is adequate, is necessary, or not. Why does\ntheir test fail?\nMR. REIN: Well, the survey was -- a random\nsurvey. It's not reported in any systematic way. They\nevidently interviewed students. And it was all about\nclassroom isolation. It wasn't about --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Was it -- was it done\nbefore or after they announced the decision to\nreinstitute racial --\nMR. REIN: It was done after\nPresident Faulkner had made the declaration they were\ngoing to do it. It was done before --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Which came almost\nimmediately after our decision in Grutter.\nMR. REIN: On the -- I believe, on the same\nday.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And by the way, do you\nthink that Grutter -- this goes to Justice Breyer's\nquestion -- do you think that Grutter held that there is\nno more affirmative action in higher education after\n2028?\nMR. REIN: No, I don't.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Was that the holding of\nGrutter?\nMR. REIN: That was -- that was not --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's a scary -- that's a\nscary --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I agree it might, but I\nwant to get to the question, so, what I'm trying to\npinpoint, because we have such a limited time, and to\nme, the one thing I want to pinpoint, since you're\narguing on that this satisfies Grutter, if properly\nunderstood, as you say that. In looking up, we have a\ntwo-court rule.\nAnd two courts have found, it seems to me,\nthat here, there is a certain thing -- there is no\nquota. It is individualized. It is time limited. It\nwas adopted after the consideration of race-neutral\nmeans. Each applicant receives individual\nconsideration, and race did not become the predominant\nfactor.\nSo I take those as a given. And then I want\nto know what precisely it is that Grutter required in\nyour opinion that makes this different from Grutter, in\nthat it was not satisfied here? The ones I listed, two\ncourts say are the same. So maybe there's some others.\nMR. REIN: I'm not sure we agree with those\ncourts in their method of analysis.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But we have a rule that if\ntwo courts say it, we're very reluctant, on something\nconnected with facts, to overturn it, so -- so that's\nwhy I mention that.\nMR. REIN: Well -- and -- particularly in\nthe case of considering alternatives that have worked\nabout as well, I think that's a legal question this\nCourt is free to act on.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There are facts, and there\nare facts, aren't there?\nMR. REIN: So if I might try to answer your\nquestion, there was no effort in this case to establish\na -- even a working target for critical mass. They\nsimply ignored it. They just used words, and they said,\nwe've got to do more. So they never answered the\npredicate question, which Grutter asks: Absent the use\nof race, can we generate a critical mass?\nSo -- I mean, that's -- that's a flaw we\nthink is in Grutter. We think it's necessary for this\nCourt to restate that principle. Now, whether that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That -- that's a normal\nfact that we accede to two-court holdings on, whether\nthere is -- is or is not a critical mass?\nMR. REIN: No. I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's a weird kind of a\nfact.\nMR. REIN: And I'm -- I'm not saying --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's an estimation, isn't\nit? A judgment?\nMR. REIN: Well, Justice Scalia, that is\ncorrect. And in addition, the courts didn't find\nwhether a critical mass --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So could you tell me\nwhat a critical mass was? I'm looking at the number of\nblacks in the University of Texas system. Pre-Grutter,\nwhen the state was indisputably still segregating, it\nwas 4 percent. Today, under the post-Grutter system,\nit's 6 percent. The 2 percent increase is enough for\nyou, even though the state population is at 12 percent?\nSomehow, they've reached a critical mass with just the\n2 percent increase?\nMR. REIN: Well, we don't believe that\ndemographics are the key to underrepresentation of\ncritical mass.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No -- putting aside -- I\ndon't -- I'm not going to quarrel with you that, if\ndemographics alone were being used, I would be somewhat\nconcerned. But you can't seriously suggest that\ndemographics aren't a factor to be looked at in\ncombination with how isolated or not isolated your\nstudent body is actually reporting itself to feel?\nMR. REIN: Well, I think, if you start to\nsplit out subgroups of minorities, you mistake, I\nthink -- what I think is the proper thrust of Grutter,\nor at least ought to be.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It might be insulting --\nit might be insulting to some to be thrown into a pot.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why don't you\nseriously suggest that? Why don't you seriously suggest\nthat demographic -- that the demographic makeup of the\nstate has nothing to do with whether somebody feels\nisolated, that if you're in a state that is only\n1 percent black that doesn't mean that you're not\nisolated, so long as there's 1 percent in the class?\nMR. REIN: Certainly -- racial balance --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I wish you would take that\nposition because it seems, to me, right.\nMR. REIN: Well, Justice Scalia, racial\nbalancing is not a permissible interest. And we have\nconstantly -- this Court has constantly held not a\npermissible interest. And that is something we\ncertainly agree with.\nTrying to respond to Justice Sotomayor\nand -- and in the framework of Grutter, what you're\nlooking at is, do you -- does this person, member of a\nso-called underrepresented minority -- it's a concept we\ndon't necessarily accept, but it's Texas' concept -- are\nthey isolated? Are they unable to speak out?\nAnd I think we've always said, if you have a\nvery large number, as Texas did in 2004, when they\nostensibly made the decision to reinstitute race, they\nhad a 21 percent admission percentage of what they\ncalled the underrepresented minorities.\nThey also had about an 18 percent admission\nratio of Asian Americans. So on campus, you're talking\nabout -- about 40 percent of the class being minorities.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, but the test is -- the\ntest is, in your opinion -- I have to write this in the\nopinion, let's say -- the proper test of critical mass\nis, is the minority isolated, unable to speak out.\nThat's the test. And that wasn't in Grutter or was in\nGrutter? And in your opinion, it was in Grutter?\nMR. REIN: Yes. It said expressly in\nGrutter --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Isolated. And the reason\nit was satisfied there and not here is?\nMR. REIN: In Grutter, the Court assumed\nthat the very small number of admissions -- minority\nadmissions, looked at as the whole -- and it was looked\nat as a whole, only as a whole in Grutter -- would have\nyielded about 3 or 4 percent minority admission in a\nclass of 350, which means about 12 to 15 students --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what are you telling\nus is the standard of critical mass? At what point does\na district court or a university know that it doesn't\nhave to do any more to equalize the desegregation that\nhas happened in that particular state over decades, that\nit's now going to be stuck at a fixed number and it has\nto change its rules. What's that fixed number?\nMR. REIN: We -- it's not our burden to\nestablish the number. It was the burden of the\nUniversity of Texas to determine whether --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, they told -- they\ntold the district court. They took a study of students.\nThey analyzed the composition of their classes, and they\ndetermined in their educational judgment that greater\ndiversity, just as we said in Grutter, is a goal of\ntheir educational program and one that includes\ndiversifying classes.\nSo what more proof do you require?\nMR. REIN: Well, if you are allowed to state\nall the grounds that need to be proved, you will always\nprove them, in all fairness, Justice Sotomayor.\nThe question is, they have --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, but given it was\nin the evidence, what more do you think they needed? I\nthink I hear all you saying in your brief is the\nnumber's fixed now, they got enough, no more is\nnecessary.\nMR. REIN: What we're saying in the brief\nwas they were generating, in fact, a very substantial\nnumber of minority presence on campus.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's enough now.\nMR. REIN: And --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's what you're\nsaying?\nMR. REIN: No. And that immediately thrust\nupon them the responsibility, if they wanted to -- you\nknow, essentially move away from equal treatment, they\nhad to establish, we have a purpose, we are trying to\ngenerate a critical mass of minorities that otherwise\ncould not be achieved.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Tell me -- all right.\nTell me what about their use of race did not fit the\nnarrow tailoring -- not the necessity prong as you've\ndefined it, but the narrow tailoring that Grutter\nrequired? How is race used by them in a way that\nviolated the terms of Grutter?\nMR. REIN: And for this purpose --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Assuming that the need\nis there. I know you're challenging the need.\nMR. REIN: Well, put -- put aside whether\nthis was necessary and whether it was an appropriate\nlast resort in -- in a quest for diversity and critical\nmass because Grutter's not without limits. But I'll put\nthat aside, and let me come directly to your question.\nFirst of all, if you think about narrow\ntailoring, you can't tailor to the unknown. If you have\nno range of evaluation, if you have no understanding of\nwhat critical mass means, you can't tailor to it.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you have to set a\nquota for critical mass?\nMR. REIN: No. There's -- there's a huge\ndifference, and it's an important one that is not well\nput out by the University of Texas. Having a range, a\nview as to what would be an appropriate level of\ncomfort, critical mass, as defined in Grutter, allows\nyou to evaluate where you are --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So we won't call it a\nquota, we'll call it a goal, something Grutter said you\nshouldn't have.\nMR. REIN: Well, Justice Sotomayor, I think\nit's very important to distinguish between the operative\nuse of that range. In other words, that's where we are,\nand we're going to use race until we get there, every\nyear, in consideration of each application, which was a\nproblem --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Boy, it sounds awfully\nlike a quota to me, that Grutter said you should not be\ndoing, that you shouldn't be setting goals, that you\nshouldn't be setting quotas. You should be setting an\nindividualized assessment of the applicants.\nTell me how this system doesn't do that.\nMR. REIN: This system doesn't -- I mean,\nit's not narrowly tailored because it doesn't fit.\nThere are certain forms of Grutter that it follows.\nIt --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Rein, do you understand\nwhat the University of Texas thinks is the definition of\na critical mass? Because I don't.\nMR. REIN: I -- well, it simply reiterated\nthe language of Grutter. They have no definition. They\ncan't fit --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. -- Mr. Rein, it seems\nto me that, in your talking about critical mass, you are\nrelying entirely on the 10 percent is enough. They\ndon't -- they got minorities through the 10 percent, so\nthey don't need any more. And I tried to get you\nrigidly to focus on -- forget the 10 percent plan. This\nis the entire plan.\nMR. REIN: Well, let me tell you that, if\nyou look outside the top 10, at the so-called AI/PAI\nadmits only -- forget the top 10 for a minute, they were\ngenerating approximately 15 percent minority admissions\noutside the top 10, which is in -- above what the target\nwas in Grutter. So this is not Grutter on its facts.\nIt's vastly different. This is a --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Because of the\n10 percent.\nMR. REIN: No, it was -- I'm talking about\nonly the non-top 10 percent admissions. 15 percent of\nthose were so-called underrepresented minorities. This\nis without the top 10. Now, the top 10 is also a major\ngenerator of admissions for underrepresented minorities.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And this was -- and this\nwas before the adoption of the plan.\nMR. REIN: That is correct. Those are the\nnumbers --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I'm sorry.\nNow, I'm confused. I thought the 15 percent figure was\nthe one that was arrived at with the 10 percent plan.\nMR. REIN: No. With the 10 percent plan,\nit's much higher. In 2004, it was 21 percent for just\nHispanics and African Americans, and these are the\ncategories they used. If you add in Asians, it was over\n38 percent.\nBut I'm isolating -- in response to Justice\nGinsburg, I'm isolating to the non-top 10 admissions.\nThose are over 15 percent in that year, and they average\nvery close to that over time.\nSo the -- the total generation of minority\npresence is a combination of the two in fact, but the\nAI/PAI system -- which was adopted in response to\nHopwood, it was -- as Texas says, it was the first thing\nthey tried to accommodate to their loss of the ability\nto use race directly, which came up in Hopwood.\nSo that was their first response, to look at\na more balanced admission program between Academic Index\nand Personal Achievement Index. So it is not a system\nwhich just excludes minorities.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Could you comment on\nthis -- and then I hope we can get back to\nJustice Alito's question.\nYou argue that the University's\nrace-conscious admission plan is not necessary to\nachieve a diverse student body because it admits so few\npeople -- so few minorities. And I had trouble with\nthat, reading the brief. I said, well, if it's so few,\nthen what's the problem?\nMR. REIN: Well, it's a question --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Then -- let's assume --\nMR. REIN: Excuse me, Justice.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- that it resulted in the\nadmission of many minorities. Then you'd come back and\nsay, oh, well, this is -- this shows that we -- we were\nprobably wrongly excluded. I --\nMR. REIN: Well --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I see an inconsistency\nhere.\nMR. REIN: Well --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it -- are you saying\nthat you shouldn't impose this hurt or this injury,\ngenerally, for so little benefit; is -- is that the\npoint?\nMR. REIN: Well, yes, that's part of it.\nThe second is the question of reasonably available\nalternatives. If we take Texas at its word, and it says\nthey are satisfied, they are happy going on with the way\nthey apply race today, we tried to measure, well, what\ndifference is it making? And could you achieve the same\nthing with a reasonably available race-neutral\nalternative?\nThat's a question that was asked in Grutter.\nThey were supposed to analyze that. They didn't look at\nit. But it --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But is the -- the\nrace-neutral alternative is the 10 percent plan?\nMR. REIN: The race-neutral alternative\nincludes an extension of the 10 percent plan because\nit's a major generator of minority admissions. And\nright now, that ranges at 30.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you say, and that's\nokay because it's -- it's race-neutral. But is it\nreally? The -- the only reason that they instituted the\n10 percent plan was to increase minority enrollment.\nMR. REIN: Well, we say --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And it -- and that -- the\nonly way it works is if you have heavily separated\nschools. And worse than that, I mean, if you -- if you\nwant to go to the University of Texas under the\n10 percent plan, you go to the low-performing school,\nyou don't take challenging courses, because that's how\nyou'll get into the 10 percent.\nSo maybe the University is concerned that\nthat is an inadequate way to deal with it.\nMR. REIN: But, Justice Ginsburg, let -- let\nme say that -- that a lot of that is speculative. There\nis nothing in the record to support it. We don't know.\nThey've never surveyed the top 10 admits, the minority\nadmits, to see, well, did you --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. The 10 percent\nplan is not imposed by the University. It's not their\noption --\nMR. REIN: Correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- to say this -- this is\nnot good for education because people will take easy\ncourses. It's imposed by state law, isn't it?\nMR. REIN: Correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Anybody who is in the top\n10 percent of any school in the state gets into the\nUniversity of Texas.\nMR. REIN: Yes. And even the Fifth Circuit\nsaid you can't disregard its consequences because it's a\nmatter of law. I'm simply saying they could choose to\nextend it beyond where it is because it's capped today\nat 75 percent.\nBut that's not the only option. That's not\nthe only alternative. And -- and certainly, one simple\nalternative is they could look at the yield, that is,\nwhat percentage of the admitted minorities are they\nactually encouraging and -- and enrolling.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Or they could -- this is\nwhat is underlying my thing here. I want to get you\ndirectly to answer it. I did look up the figures. And\nbefore Hopwood and the 10 percent plan, it looked on the\nAfrican American side, that it averaged about 5 --\n5 percent per year, really, pretty steadily.\nThen after Hopwood and 10 percent, it went\ndown a little bit, not a lot, but it went down to about\n3 and a half percent -- 4 percent, maybe. And then they\nintroduced Grutter, and it's back up to 5 percent.\nMR. REIN: No --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Now, is that a lot?\nIs that a little? There are several thousand admissions\nofficers in the United States, several thousand\nuniversities, and what is it we're going to say here\nthat wasn't already said in Grutter, that isn't going to\ntake hundreds or thousands of these people and have\nFederal judges dictating the policy of admission of all\nthese universities? You see why I'm looking for some\ncertainty?\nMR. REIN: Well, Justice --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I saw what happened, you\nsaw the numbers.\nSorry. Go ahead.\nMR. REIN: Justice Breyer, just -- I will\nanswer your question. I'd like to reserve a little\ntime.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You can answer it later, if\nyou want, or not answer it at all, if you don't.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. REIN: No, I am perfectly happy to -- to\nanswer your question.\nI think that the increase in\nAfrican American admissions that you're looking at was\npre-Grutter. It -- it was generated before 2004.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Uh-huh.\nMR. REIN: So I just want to make clear the\nrecord doesn't depend -- they don't depend on race to do\nit. It's minimal change with the use of race. And\nthat's why we say there is an alternative, which would\nserve it about as well in increasing yield or, indeed,\nin reweighting the -- the PAI, which is a critical\nelement here, so that you put more emphasis on the\nsocioeconomic factors and less emphasis on the essays,\nwhich are an academic measure within the PAI.\nSo there are lots that they could do --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So now, we're going to\ntell the universities how to run and how to weigh\nqualifications, too?\nMR. REIN: It's not the job of the Court to\ntell them how to do it. It's their job to examine the\nalternatives available to them and see if they couldn't\nachieve the same thing.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you tell me,\nagain, how race and their use of race overwhelms those\nother factors in their system as it's created?\nMR. REIN: I -- the question is not whether\nit overwhelms them. They're -- but they -- they say --\nthey admit, it is effective. There are admissions that\nwould not have taken place, but for; somebody else would\nhave had that place, but for the use of race.\nAnd I think, Justice Kennedy, just to answer\nyour question fully, you have to analyze race-neutral\nalternatives. And if you look at Parents Involved,\nthat -- that was the critical question. The out -- the\noutcomes were so small, that there were readily\navailable alternatives.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, perhaps you could\nsummarize by saying -- by telling us, from your point of\nview, this plan fails strict scrutiny on one or two or\nboth levels, A, because the objective is inappropriate\nor ill-defined, and, B, because of the implementation is\ndefective. Which or both of those are you arguing?\nMR. REIN: We have argued both, and we\ncontinue to argue both. It is not a necessary --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And in what respect does\nthis plan fail strict scrutiny under either of those --\nunder both of those categories?\nMR. REIN: Okay. Under the category -- the\nfirst category, was it a necessary means of pursuing a\ncompelling interest, we don't believe they've shown any\nnecessity for doing what they were doing. And\ncertainly, it -- race should have been a last resort.\nIt was a first resort. That's, in a nutshell, that\nprong of it. And in order -- and they failed in every\nrespect.\nIf you go to narrow tailoring, what we are\nsaying is they didn't consider alternatives, and their\ntreatment of, as we have pointed out, Asian Americans\nand Hispanics makes a -- an incomprehensible\ndistinction. They say, we don't worry about Asians,\nthere are a lot of Asians, it's a demographic measure,\nwhich is a forbidden measure.\nThey are in excess of their share of the\nTexas population. But if you are trying to find\nindividual comfort levels, if you are breaking it down\nbetween African Americans and -- and Hispanics, the --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, you are the one\nwho, in your brief, has assumed that they are valuing\ndifferent races differently. But Asian numbers have\ngone up, under however they have structured this PAI.\nAnd as I understand their position, race is balanced\nagainst other issues like socioeconomics, the strength\nof the classes people took. It's never a standalone.\nSo even a white student, I presume, who goes\nto an -- an entirely black or an entirely Latino school,\nwho becomes class president, would get some points\nbecause he has or she has proven that they foster or can\ndeal in a diverse environment. That's how I understood\ntheir plan, that it's not just giving you a plus because\nof race. It's combining that with other factors.\nMR. REIN: There is a plus because of race.\nThere are many other factors in the decision. And might\nI say that this -- the white student president of the\nclass in an ethnically different school is a measure of\nleadership.\nLeadership is an independent factor in the\nPAI. It isn't -- he is not getting that point because\nhe's -- because of his race; he's getting that point\nbecause of his leadership. That's a race-neutral\ncriteria could work for anybody.\nSo race is an independent add-on. It -- it\nis something they can use to boost the PAI score, the\nPAS element in any way they like, because they say they\ncontextualize it. And we've said it's not necessary,\nit's not narrowly tailored, it ignores available\nalternatives, it treats -- gives disparate treatment to\nAsian Americans because they are minorities as well.\nAnd to the extent it depends on the\nclassroom factor, there is simply no way to relate or\nfit what they are doing to the solution of the problem\nwhich they used as a major foundation of their proposal,\nwhich is the nondiverse classroom. That -- certainly,\nthere is just no correspondence there.\nI see my time is up, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will afford you\nrebuttal time, since our questions have prevented you\nfrom reserving it.\nMR. REIN: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Garre.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. GARRE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nFor two overriding reasons, the -- the\nadmissions plan before you is Constitutional under this\nCourt's precedents. First, it is indistinguishable in\nterms of how it operates in taking race into account as\nonly one modest factor among many for the individualized\nconsiderations of applicants in their totality from\nplans that this Court has upheld in Grutter and plans\nthat this Court approved in Bakke and the Harvard\nplan --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- I put that in the\nnarrow tailoring category, that it is narrowly tailored\nthe way Grutter did -- said, not the necessity prong and\nnot the need prong -- not the necessity prong. I think\nmost of his argument has been centered on that, so --\nMR. GARRE: That's right. And so that's the\nsecond point I was going to make, which is that the\nholistic admissions process at issue here is a necessary\ncounterpart to the state's top 10 percent Law and works\nto systematic -- to offset the systematic drawbacks of\nthat law in achieving an interest that is indisputably\ncompelling, the university's interest in assembling a\nbroadly diverse student body.\nIn the interest --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, before -- I\nneed to figure out exactly what these numbers mean.\nShould someone who is one-quarter Hispanic check the\nHispanic box or some different box?\nMR. GARRE: Your Honor, there is a\nmultiracial box. Students check boxes based on their\nown determination. Now, this is true under the Common\nApplication --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I suppose a\nperson who is one-quarter percent Hispanic, his own\ndetermination, would be, I'm one-quarter percent\nHispanic.\nMR. GARRE: Then they would check that box,\nYour Honor, as is true of any --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They would check\nthat box. What about one-eighth?\nMR. GARRE: Your Honor, that was -- they --\nthey would make that self-determination, Your Honor.\nIf -- if anyone, in any part of the application,\nviolated some honor code then that could come out --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would it violate the\nhonor code for someone who is one-eighth Hispanic and\nsays, I identify as Hispanic, to check the Hispanic box?\nMR. GARRE: I don't think -- I don't think\nit would, Your Honor. I don't think that that issue\nwould be any different than the plan upheld in Grutter\nor the Harvard plan or in Bakke --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't check, in\nany way, the racial identification?\nMR. GARRE: We do not, Your Honor, and no\ncollege in America, the Ivy Leagues, the Little Ivy\nLeagues, that I'm aware of.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So how do you know\nyou have 15 percent African American -- Hispanic or\n15 percent minority?\nMR. GARRE: Your Honor, the same way that\nthat determination is made in any other situation, I'm\naware of, where race is taken into account --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You say it's \"the\nsame way.\" What is that way?\nMR. GARRE: Well, the persons self-identify\non that form.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do they have to\nself-identify?\nMR. GARRE: They do not, Your Honor. Every\nyear people do not, and many of those applicants are\nadmitted.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And how do they decide?\nYou know, it's -- they want not just a critical mass in\nthe school at large, but class by class? How do they\nfigure out that particular classes don't have enough?\nWhat -- are they -- somebody walks in the room and looks\nthem over to see who looks -- who looks Asian, who looks\nblack, who looks Hispanic? Is that -- is that how it's\ndone?\nMR. GARRE: No, Your Honor, and let me try\nto be clear on this. The university has never asserted\na compelling interest in any specific diversity in every\nsingle classroom. It has simply looked to classroom\ndiversity as one dimension of student body diversity.\nAnd after --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know what you are\ntalking about. I mean, it is either a factor that is\nvalidly in this case or it isn't. Now, do they look to\nindividual classroom diversity or not? And if so, how\ndo they decide when classes are diverse?\nMR. GARRE: This Court in Grutter, Your\nHonor -- and maybe the most important thing that was\nsaid during the first 30 minutes is, when given an\nopportunity to challenge Grutter, I understood my friend\nnot to ask this Court to overrule it.\nThis Court in Grutter recognized the obvious\nfact that the classroom is one of the most important\nenvironments where the educational benefits of diversity\nare realized. And so the University of Texas, in\ndetermining whether or not it had reached a critical\nmass, looked to the classroom, along with --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Fine. I'm asking how. How\ndid they look to the classroom?\nMR. GARRE: Well, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: On their way in -- did they\nrequire everybody to check a box or they have somebody\nfigure out, oh, this person looks 1/32nd Hispanic, and\nthat's enough?\nMR. GARRE: They did a study, Your Honor,\nthat took into account the same considerations that they\ndid in discussing the enrollment categories --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What kind of a study? What\nkind of a study?\nMR. GARRE: Well, Your Honor, it's in the\nSupplemental Joint Appendix.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. It doesn't explain to\nme how they go about, classroom by classroom, deciding\nhow many minorities there are.\nMR. GARRE: Your Honor, there are student\nlists in each classroom. The student lists --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There are student\nlists in each classroom that -- that have race\nidentified with the students?\nMR. GARRE: No, no, Your Honor. Of course,\neach classroom -- the university knows which students\nare taking its classes. And one can then, if you want\nto gauge diversity in the classrooms, go back --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, you go back to\nwhat they checked on the form?\nMR. GARRE: Your Honor, this was part of\na --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's a yes or no\nquestion. You go back to what they checked on their\napplication form in deciding whether Economics 201 has a\nsufficient number of African Americans or Hispanics?\nMR. GARRE: That is information that is\navailable to the university, Your Honor, the race of\nstudents, if they've checked it on the application. But\nI do want to be clear on this classroom diversity study.\nThis was only one of many information points that the\nuniversity looked to.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, on the classroom\ndiversity, how does the non-top 10 percent part of the\nplan further classroom diversity? My understanding is\nthat the university had over 5,000 classes that\nqualified as small, and the total number of African\nAmericans and Hispanics who were admitted under the part\nof the plan that is challenged was just a little over\n200.\nSo how does that -- how does that -- how can\nthat possibly do more than a tiny, tiny amount to\nincrease classroom diversity?\nMR. GARRE: Well, Your Honor, first, I think\nthat 200 number is erroneous. There have been many more\nminority candidates in --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Per class?\nMR. GARRE: No, not -- not on a per-class\nbasis.\nJUSTICE ALITO: In an entering class.\nMR. GARRE: I think in looking at the\nclassrooms, Your Honor, what the university found was\nshocking isolation against --\nJUSTICE ALITO: How many -- how many non-top\n10 percent members of the two minorities at issue here\nare admitted in each class?\nMR. GARRE: Your Honor, we didn't look\nspecifically at that determination. What we did -- in\nother words, to try to find whether there were holistic\nadmits or percentage admits, we did conclude in 2004 --\nand, again, this was before -- we did the classroom\nstudy before the plan at issue was adopted, and at that\ntime, there were no holistic admits taking race into\naccount.\nAnd what we concluded was that we simply --\nif you looked at African Americans, for example, in\n90 percent of the classes of the most common\nparticipatory size --\nJUSTICE ALITO: I really don't understand\nyour answer. You know the total number of, let's say,\nAfrican Americans in an entering class, right? Yes or\nno?\nMR. GARRE: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And you know the total\nnumber who were admitted under the top 10 percent plan?\nMR. GARRE: We do, Your Honor. But, again,\nat the time --\nJUSTICE ALITO: If you subtract A from B,\nyou'll get C, right?\nMR. GARRE: Your Honor, at the time --\nJUSTICE ALITO: And what is the value of C\nper class?\nMR. GARRE: Your Honor, I don't know the\nanswer to that question, and let me try to explain why\nthe university didn't look specifically at -- to that.\nBecause at the time that the classroom diversity study\nwas conducted, it was before the holistic admissions\nprocess at issue here was adopted in 2003-2004.\nAnd so that determination wouldn't have been\nas important as just finding out are African Americans\nor Hispanics, underrepresented minorities, present at\nthe university in such numbers that we are not\nexperiencing racial -- racial isolation in the\nclassroom.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is that number?\nWhat is the critical mass of African Americans and\nHispanics at the university that you are working toward?\nMR. GARRE: Your Honor, we don't have one.\nAnd -- and this Court in Grutter --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So how are we\nsupposed to tell whether this plan is narrowly tailored\nto that goal?\nMR. GARRE: To look to the same criteria of\nthis Court in Grutter. This Court in Grutter\nspecifically rejected the notion that you could come up\nwith a fixed percentage. Now --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Does critical mass vary from\n-- from group to group? Does it vary from state to\nstate?\nMR. GARRE: It certainly is contextual. I\nthink it could vary, Your Honor. I think -- let me\nfirst say that my friends have -- throughout this\nlitigation, not in this Court, asserted 20 percent as a\ncritical mass, and that's lumping together different\nminority groups.\nJUSTICE ALITO: No. But could you answer my\nquestion? What does the University of Texas -- the\nUniversity of Texas think about those questions?\nMR. GARRE: We --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Is the critical mass for the\nUniversity of Texas dependent on the breakdown of the\npopulation of Texas?\nMR. GARRE: No, it's not at all.\nJUSTICE ALITO: It's not.\nMR. GARRE: It's not at all. It's looking\nto -- to the educational benefits of diversity on\ncampus, and I think we actually agree on what that means\nand what Grutter said it meant, in terms of --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Garre, could you\nexplain -- I think you were trying to before -- what\nseems to me the critical question in this case: Why\ndidn't the 10 percent solution suffice? There were a\nsubstantial number of minority members admitted as a\nresult of the 10 percent solution. Why wasn't that\nenough to achieve diversity?\nMR. GARRE: Well, let me make a couple of\npoints, Your Honor. First, if you just looked at the\nnumbers -- we don't think it's the numbers, but if you\nlooked at the numbers, after 7 years, racial diversity\namong these groups at the University of Texas had\nremained stagnant or worse. 2002, African American\nenrollment had actually dropped to 3 percent. That's\none part of it.\nThe other part of it is, if you look at the\nadmissions under the top 10 percent plan, taking the --\nthe top 10 percent of a racially identifiable high\nschool may get you diversity that looks okay on paper,\nbut it doesn't guarantee you diversity that produces\neducational benefits on campus. And that's one of the\nconsiderations that the university took into account as\nwell.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand that.\nWhy? Why -- why doesn't it?\nMR. GARRE: Because, Your Honor, as is true\nfor any group -- and the Harvard plan that this Court\napproved in Bakke specifically recognized this, you\nwould want representatives and different viewpoints from\nindividuals within the same -- the same racial group,\njust as you would from individuals outside of that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What kind of viewpoints? I\nmean, are they political viewpoints?\nMR. GARRE: Well, anyone's experiences,\nwhere they grew up, the situations that they -- that\nthey experience in their lives are going to affect their\nviewpoints.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This -- this has nothing to\ndo with, with racial diversity. I mean, you're talking\nabout something else.\nMR. GARRE: Your Honor, I think it directly\nimpacts the educational benefits of diversity in this\nsense, that the minority candidate who has shown that --\nthat he or she has succeeded in an integrated\nenvironment, has shown leadership, community service,\nthe other factors that we looked at in holistic review,\nis precisely the kind of candidate that's going to\ncome -- come on campus, help to break down racial\nbarriers, work across racial lines, dispel --\nstereotypes --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Also, the kind that is\nlikely to be included within the 10 percent rule. And,\nincidentally, when -- when was the 10 percent rule\nadopted?\nMR. GARRE: 1998, Your Honor.\nBut, but with respect to your -- your\nfactual point, that's absolutely wrong, Your Honor. If\nyou look at the admissions data that we cite on page 34\nof our brief, it shows the breakdown of applicants under\nthe holistic plan and the percentage plan.\nAnd I don't think it's been seriously\ndisputed in this -- this case to this point that,\nalthough the percentage plan certainly helps with\nminority admissions, by and large, the -- the minorities\nwho are admitted tend to come from segregated,\nracially-identifiable schools.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, I thought that the\nwhole purpose of affirmative action was to help students\nwho come from underprivileged backgrounds, but you make\na very different argument that I don't think I've ever\nseen before.\nThe top 10 percent plan admits lots of\nAfrican Americans -- lots of Hispanics and a fair number\nof African Americans. But you say, well, it's -- it's\nfaulty because it doesn't admit enough African Americans\nand Hispanics who come from privileged backgrounds. And\nyou specifically have the example of the child of\nsuccessful professionals in Dallas.\nNow, that's your -- that's your argument?\nIf you have -- you have an applicant whose parents are\n-- let's say they're -- one of them is a partner in your\nlaw firm in Texas, another one is a part -- is another\ncorporate lawyer. They have income that puts them in\nthe top\n1 percent of earners in the country, and they have --\nparents both have graduate degrees.\nThey deserve a leg-up against, let's say, an\nAsian or a white applicant whose parents are absolutely\naverage in terms of education and income?\nMR. GARRE: No, Your Honor. And let me --\nlet me answer the question. First of all, the example\ncomes almost word for word from the Harvard plan that\nthis Court approved in Grutter and that Justice Powell\nheld out in Bakke.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, how can the answer to\nthat question be no, because being an African American\nor being a Hispanic is a plus factor.\nMR. GARRE: Because, Your Honor, our point\nis, is that we want minorities from different\nbackgrounds. We go out of our way to recruit minorities\nfrom disadvantaged backgrounds.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So what you're saying is\nthat what counts is race above all?\nMR. GARRE: No, Your Honor, what counts is\ndifferent experiences --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's the\nnecessary -- that's the necessary response to\nJustice Alito's question.\nMR. GARRE: Well, Your Honor, what we want\nis different experiences that are going to -- that are\ngoing to come on campus --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You want underprivileged\nof a certain race and privileged of a certain race. So\nthat's race.\nMR. GARRE: No, Your Honors, it's -- it's\nnot race. It's just the opposite. I mean, in the LUAC\ndecision, for example, this Court said that failing to\ntake into account differences among members of the same\nrace does a disservice --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But the -- but the reason\nyou're reaching for the privileged is so that members of\nthat race who are privileged can be representative, and\nthat's race. I just --\nMR. GARRE: It's -- it's members of the same\nracial group, Your Honor, bringing different\nexperiences. And to say that -- if you took any racial\ngroup, if you -- if you had an admissions process that\nonly tended to admit from a -- people from a particular\nbackground or perspective, you would want people from\ndifferent perspectives.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel --\nMR. GARRE: And that's -- that's the\ninterests that we're discussing here. It's the\ninterests that -- that the Harvard plan specifically\nadopts and lays out --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understand my job,\nunder our precedents, to determine if your use of race\nis narrowly tailored to a compelling interest. The\ncompelling interest you identify is attaining a critical\nmass of minority students at the University of Texas,\nbut you won't tell me what the critical mass is. How am\nI supposed to do the job that our precedents say I\nshould do?\nMR. GARRE: Your Honor, what -- what this\nCourt's precedents say is a critical mass is an\nenvironment in which students of underrepresented --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I know what you say,\nbut when will we know that you've reached a critical\nmass?\nMR. GARRE: Well --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Grutter said there\nhas to be a logical end point to your use of race. What\nis the logical end point? When will I know that you've\nreached a critical mass?\nMR. GARRE: Your Honor, this question, of\ncourse, implicates Grutter itself. And, again, I\nunderstood my friend not to challenge that. They\nhaven't challenged that diversity is a compelling\ninterest at all.\nWhat -- what we look to, and we think that\ncourts can review this determination, one, we look to\nfeedback directly from students about racial isolation\nthat they experience. Do they feel like spokespersons\nfor their race.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you, what, you\nconduct a survey and ask students if they feel racially\nisolated?\nMR. GARRE: That's one of the things we\nlooked at.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And that's the basis\nfor our Constitutional determination?\nMR. GARRE: Your Honor, that's one of the\nthings that we looked at.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. What are the\nothers?\nMR. GARRE: Another is that we did look to\nenrollment data, which showed, for example, among\nAfrican Americans, that African American enrollment at\nthe University of Texas dropped to 3 percent in 2002\nunder the percentage plan.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: At what level will\nit satisfy the critical mass?\nMR. GARRE: Well, I think we all agree that\n3 percent is not a critical mass. It's -- it's well\nbeyond that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but at what\nlevel will it satisfy the requirement of critical mass?\nMR. GARRE: When we have an environment in\nwhich African Americans do not --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When -- how am I\nsupposed to decide whether you have an environment\nwithin particular minorities who don't feel isolated?\nMR. GARRE: Your Honor, part of this is a --\nis a judgment that the admin -- the educators are going\nto make, but you would look to the same criteria --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, I say -- when\nyou tell me, that's good enough.\nMR. GARRE: No, Your Honor, not at all. You\nwould look to the criteria that we looked at, the -- the\nenrollment data, the feedback from the students. We\nalso took into account diversity in the classroom. We\ntook into account the racial climate on campus.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But would 3 percent be\nenough in New Mexico, your bordering state, where the\nAfrican American population is around 2 percent?\nMR. GARRE: Your Honor, I don't think it\nwould. I mean, our concept to critical mass isn't tied\nto demographic. It's undisputed in this case that we\nare not pursuing any demographic goal. That's on page\n138 of the Joint Appendix.\nAll of -- I think many key facts are\nundisputed here. It's undisputed that race is only a\nmodest factor. It's undisputed that we're taking race\ninto account only to consider individuals in their\ntotality. This is a --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Garre, I think that\nthe issue that my colleagues are asking is, at what\npoint and when do we stop deferring to the University's\njudgment that race is still necessary? That's the\nbottom line of this case. And you're saying, and I\nthink rightly because of our cases, that you can't set a\nquota, because that's what our cases say you can't do.\nSo if we're not going to set a quota, what\ndo you think is the standard we apply to make a\njudgment?\nMR. GARRE: I think the standard you would\napply is the one set forth in Grutter, and it comes from\nJustice Powell's opinion in Bakke, that you would look\nto whether or not the University reached an environment\nin which members of underrepresented minorities, African\nAmericans and Hispanics, do not feel like spokespersons\nfor their race, members -- an environment where\ncross-racial understanding is promoted, an environment\nwhere the benefit -- educational benefits of diversity\nare realized.\nAnd the reason why the University of Texas\nconcluded that that environment was not met here, it\nlaid out in several different information points that\nthis Court can review and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that -- that -- that\nholds for only -- only another what, 16 years, right?\nSixteen more years, and you're going to call it all off.\nMR. GARRE: Your Honor, we don't read\nGrutter as establishing that kind of time clock. We are\nlooking at this --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you're appealing to\nGrutter, and that's what it said.\nMR. GARRE: Well - well, Your Honor, Grutter\nis this Court's precedence. We're guided by it here.\nAt least the advocates are. And -- and what we would\nlook to is once -- we're looking at this every year,\nwe're looking at it carefully. And once we reach that\npoint, of course, we're going to stop.\nBut we also take into --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Garre. Mr. Garre.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Some of the stuff that\nGrutter says -- some of the stuff that Grutter says you\nagree with, some of the stuff that it says you don't\nagree with.\nMR. GARRE: Well, I don't know that I've\ndisagreed with anything it said. It --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Garre, before your\ntime is -- runs out, the other point that I'd like you\nto answer is the argument based on Parents Involved,\nthat the gain is just too small to warrant using a\nracial criteria.\nMR. GARRE: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Once you have the\n10 percent, you don't need more. So how do you answer\nthe argument of the gain is too small?\nMR. GARRE: First I'd point to my friend's\nown concessions, that the consideration of race has\nincreased racial diversity at Hispanic and helps with\nminority enrollment. That's on page 138 of the Joint\nAppendix.\nSecondly, I'd point to the fact that African\nAmerican and Hispanics' admissions did increase.\nAfrican American admissions doubled from the period of\n2002 and 2004. So this has had a real important impact\non diversity at the University of Texas.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, in terms of diversity,\nhow do you justify lumping together all Asian Americans?\nDo you think -- do you have a critical mass of Filipino\nAmericans?\nMR. GARRE: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Cambodian Americans --\nCambodian Americans?\nMR. GARRE: -- the common form that's used\nhas Asian American, but also, next to that, has a form\nthat says country of origin where that can be spelled\nout.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And do you have a critical\nmass as to all the subgroups that fall within this\nenormous group of Asian Americans?\nMR. GARRE: Your Honor, we've looked to\nwhether or not we have a critical mass of\nunderrepresented minorities, which is precisely what the\nGrutter decision asks us to do.\nI think -- if I can make a quick point on\njurisdiction --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If I could, before we get\nto that.\nMR. GARRE: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose we -- that you, in\nyour experience identify a numerical category a\nnumerical standard, a numerical designation for critical\nmass: It's X percent. During the course of the\nadmissions process, can the admissions officers check to\nsee how close they are coming to this numerical --\nMR. GARRE: No. No, Your Honor, and we\ndon't. On page 389 of the joint --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You -- you cannot do that?\nMR. GARRE: We -- we wouldn't be monitoring\nthe class. I think one of the problems --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But isn't that what\nhappened in Grutter; it allowed that.\nMR. GARRE: It did, Your Honor. It was one\nof the things --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So are you saying that\nGrutter is incorrect?\nMR. GARRE: No, Your Honor. It was one of\nthe things that you pointed out in your dissent. What\nI'm saying is we don't have that problem, because --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm -- I'm asking whether\nor not you could do that. And if --\nMR. GARRE: I don't think so, because the\nGrutter majority didn't understand it to be monitoring\nfor the purposes of reaching a specific demographic.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They don't -- they\ndon't monitor, but race is the only one of your holistic\nfactors that appears on the cover of every application,\nright?\nMR. GARRE: Well, all the holistic factors\nare taking into account on the application, and they're\nlisted at various points on the application.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. The\nquestion was whether race is the only one of your\nholistic factors that appears on the cover of every\napplication.\nMR. GARRE: That -- that is true on the\ncover of the application.\nIf -- could I make one point on jurisdiction?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will give you a\nlittle more time since I'm going to give your friend a\nlittle more time.\nMR. GARRE: Thank you.\nThe fundamental problem with jurisdiction is\nthis: First of all, they definitively cannot show that\nshe was injured by any consideration of race. That's at\npages 415 and 416 of the Joint Appendix, where it makes\nclear that Ms. Fisher would not have been admitted to\nthe fall 2008 class at University of Texas no matter\nwhat her race, because her --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just to be clear,\nare you arguing that she doesn't have standing in an\nArticle III sense?\nMR. GARRE: Yes, Your Honor. And I think --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You address that in\nyour brief in one footnote, right? We have an\nobligation to consider it in every case, and what you\ngave us is one footnote in which you said it's hard to\nsee how she could establish cognizable jurisdiction.\nMR. GARRE: And there is another part of\nthat that comes from the brief in opposition, Your\nHonor, which goes to the relief that she has requested.\nThe declaratory and injunctive release -- relief that\nthis case began with, that request has fallen out, and\nthat's undisputed. So the only thing that is live in\nthis case is a request for monetary damages. That\nrequest is on page 79 of the Joint Appendix, and it's\nfocused exclusively on a request for the return of\nadmissions fees. And the reason why that is not enough\nto confer standing is that she would have paid the\nadmissions fee no matter what policy the university\nadmissions had.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about -- what\nabout our Jacksonville case that said it is an injury to\nbe forced to be part of a process in which there is\nrace-conscious evaluation?\nMR. GARRE: Texas v. Lesage says that\nthat -- that injury is not sufficient in a\nbackward-looking case like this, where you only have\nmonetary damages. In Jacksonville and all the other\ncases, they involved forward-looking claims for\ndeclaratory injunctive reliefs where people who were\ngoing to go out and get contracts again. So Texas --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought your\nfriend -- your friend told us that these remedial issues\nand damages issues had been segregated out of the\nprocess and are still available for remand.\nMR. GARRE: Your Honor, that is not an\nanswer to jurisdiction for this reason: It's true that\nit is bifurcated in the sense that we could go and prove\ndamages, but the complaint makes no doubt that the only\nrequest for monetary damages is a request for admissions\nfees. That -- it says that explicitly. And this Court\nhas said that relief that does not remedy the injury\nsuffered cannot bootstrap a plaintiff into Federal\ncourt. That is the very essence of the redressability\nrequirement. That comes from the Seal Co. Case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's part of the\ninjury she suffered. It's -- it's not the only injury\nperhaps.\nMR. GARRE: It's the only --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But she -- she had to pay\nan admissions fee for a process in which she was not\ntreated fairly.\nMR. GARRE: And the reason why --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why shouldn't she get her\nmoney back?\nMR. GARRE: The reason why the payment of\nthat fee doesn't redress the injury, Your Honor, is that\nshe would have paid it even if Texas didn't consider\nrace at all; and, therefore, the payment of the\napplication fee back doesn't remedy the injury that she\nis complaining about.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can I ask you to get -- if\nthis is easy, do it; if not, don't.\nI wanted to use accurate numbers, and so I\ndiscovered -- I wanted to find out how many universities\nactually used a Grutter-type process last year or the\nyear before, etcetera. And one of your amici, the\nadmissions officers, according to our library, is the\nonly place that has that information, though it's\npublic, and I didn't want them to do it because they are\nan amici of yours. And you are both here, both sides,\nso if you can agree on -- simply, roughly -- what that\nnumber is, I would like to know it; otherwise, I will --\nI can use pre-Grutter numbers which are public and\navailable.\nMR. GARRE: Your Honor, I don't have\nspecific numbers. Obviously, the Ivy Leagues and Little\nIvy Leagues that have filed amicus briefs are using it.\nAnd this Court recognized in Grutter that the best\nuniversities, many of the best universities in America,\nhave been using these plans for 30 years or more.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Since we are asking\nquestions about just curiosity, I am curious to know how\nmany -- this is a very ambitious racial program here at\nthe University of Texas. How many people are there in\nthe affirmative action department of the University of\nTexas? Do you have any idea? I mean, there must be a\nlot of people to, you know, to monitor all these classes\nand do all of this assessment of race throughout the\nthing. There would be a large number of people be out\nof a job, wouldn't we, wouldn't they, if we suddenly\nwent to just 10 percent?\nMR. GARRE: Your Honor, one of the things\nthat the University of Texas does monitor is the racial\nclimate on campus. It does that to improve the\nexperience for all students on campus.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How many people?\nMR. GARRE: I don't --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't.\nMR. GARRE: -- have a specific number of\npeople, Your Honor, but it is -- it is an important part\nof improving the educational experience for all students\nat the University of Texas no matter what their race.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. GARRE: Thank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: General Verrilli.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.,\nFOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nIn resolving this case, it is important to\nfocus on what is, or more precisely, what is not at\nissue.\nPetitioner is not challenging Grutter's\nreaffirmation of the principle of Justice Powell's\nopinion in Bakke that student body diversity is a\ncompelling interest that can justify the consideration\nof race in university admissions. Colleges and\nuniversities across the country have relied on that\nprinciple in shaping their admissions policies, and it\nis of vital interest to the United States that they\ncontinue to be able to do so.\nThe core of our interest is in ensuring that\nthe Nation's universities produce graduates who are\ngoing to be effective citizens and effective leaders in\nan increasingly diverse society, and effective\ncompetitors in diverse global markets.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Does the United States agree\nwith Mr. Garre that African American and Hispanic\napplicants from privileged backgrounds deserve a\npreference?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: I understand that\ndifferently, Justice Alito. Here's how we understand\nwhat is going on with respect to the admissions process\nin the University of Texas, and I am going to address it\ndirectly. I just think it needs a bit of context to do\nso.\nThe top 10 percent plan certainly does\nproduce some ethnic diversity. Significant numbers get\nin. The problem is the university can't control that\ndiversity in the same way it can with respect to the\n25 percent of the class that is admitted through the\nholistic process.\nSo my understanding of what the university\nhere is looking to do, and what universities generally\nare looking to do in this circumstance, is not to grant\na preference for privilege, but to make individualized\ndecisions about applicants who will directly further the\neducational mission. For example, they will look for\nindividuals who will play against racial stereotypes\njust by what they bring: The African American fencer;\nthe Hispanic who has -- who has mastered classical\nGreek. They can also look for people who have a\ndemonstrated track record of --\nJUSTICE ALITO: If you have two applicants\nwho are absolutely the same in every respect: They both\ncome from affluent backgrounds, well-educated parents.\nOne falls within two of the groups that are given a\npreference, the other doesn't. It's a marginal case.\nIt's the last -- the last position available in the\nclass. Under the Texas plan, one gets in; one doesn't\nget in. Now, do you agree with that or not?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: No. I think the -- in\nthe --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do you agree with -- do you\nagree that that is an incorrect statement of the facts,\nor do you agree that that's an incorrect understanding\nof the Equal Protection Clause?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: I think it's both. I\nthink the -- there is no automatic preference in Texas.\nAnd I think this is right in the -- it says at page 398a\nof the Joint Appendix -- the -- they describe the\nprocess as saying, \"An applicant's race is considered\nonly to the extent that the applicant, viewed\nholistically, will contribute to the broader vision of\ndiversity desired by the university.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but -- but the\nhypothetical is that the two applicants are entirely the\nsame in all other respects.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Right. But the point --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And if -- if the ability to\ngive a racial preference means anything at all, it\ncertainly has to mean that, in the -- in the\nhypothetical given -- given by Justice Alito, the\nminority student gets in and the other one doesn't.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: I disagree,\nJustice Scalia. What the -- Texas, I think, has made\nclear -- and I think this is a common feature of these\nkinds of holistic approaches -- that not everyone in an\nunderrepresented group gets a preference, gets a plus\nfactor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's not a matter of not\neveryone; it's a matter of two who are identical in all\nother respects.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And what does the racial\npreference mean if it doesn't mean that in that\nsituation the minority applicant wins and the other one\nloses?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: There may not be a racial\npreference in that situation. It's going to depend on a\nholistic, individualized consideration of the applicant.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But, they're already\ntalking --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I just don't understand\nthis argument. I thought that the whole point is that\nsometimes race has to be a tie-breaker and you are\nsaying that it isn't. Well, then, we should just go\naway. Then -- then we should just say you can't use\nrace, don't worry about it.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: I don't think it's a\ntie-breaker. I think it functions more subtly than\nthat, Justice Kennedy.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It doesn't function\nmore subtly in every case. We have findings by both\ncourts below -- and I'm reading from the court of\nappeals opinion at Petitioner appendix page 33.\n\"The district court found that race is\nindisputably a meaningful factor that can make a\ndifference in the evaluation of a student's\napplication.\" If it doesn't make a difference, then we\nhave a clear case; they're using race in a way that\ndoesn't make a difference. The supposition has to be\nthat race is a determining factor.\nWe've heard a lot about holistic and all\nthat. That's fine. But unless it's a determining\nfactor, in some cases they're using race when it doesn't\nserve the purpose at all. That can't be the situation.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: It can make a difference.\nIt just doesn't invariably make a difference with\nrespect to every minority applicant, and that's the\nkey here --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You have to agree\nthat it makes a difference in some cases.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Yes, it does.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: But it doesn't\nnecessarily make a difference in the situation that\nJustice Alito posited in the hypothetical --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's the same --\nthe same would be true in -- of the Bakke plan, that in\nsome cases it's going to make a difference. The same\nwould be true under Grutter. The same would be true\nunder the policies now in existence at the military\nacademies.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: That -- that is exactly\nright, Justice Ginsburg, but the point is that it's not\na mechanical factor.\nNow, with respect to the implementation\nof -- and the narrow tailoring inquiry, with respect to\nthe University's implementation of this -- of its\ncompelling interest, I do think it's clear that,\nalthough the Petitioner says she's challenging\nimplementation, that this plan meets every requirement\nof Grutter and addresses the concern of Justice Kennedy\nthat you raised in dissent in Grutter. Whether Texas\nhad to or not, it did address that concern.\nThere's no quota. Everyone competes against\neveryone else. Race is not a mechanical automatic\nfactor. It's an holistic individualized consideration.\nAnd because of the way the process is structured, they\ndo not monitor the racial composition on an ongoing\nbasis.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: General, I think, as I\ntake your answer, is that the supposition of\nJustice Alito's question is truly impossible under this\nsystem. There are not two identical candidates because\nthere are not identical mechanical factors that --\nexcept the 10 percent plan.\nUnder the PIA, the factors are so varied, so\ncontextually set, that no two applicants ever could be\nidentical in the sense that they hypothesize.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: That's correct. They\nmake specific individualized judgments about each\napplicant --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because no two people\ncan be the same --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just to get back to\nwhat we're talking about, you -- as I understand it,\nrace by itself is taken into account, right? That's the\nonly thing on the cover of the application; they take\nrace into account.\nAnd the district court found -- and you're\nnot challenging -- that race makes a difference in some\ncases, right?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Yes. But the key,\nMr. Chief Justice, is the way it makes a difference.\nAnd it makes a difference by casting the accomplishments\nof the individual applicant in a particular light, or\nthe potential of an individual applicant in a particular\nlight.\nWhat -- what universities are looking for\nprincipally with respect to this individualized\nconsideration is what is this individual going to\ncontribute to our campus? And race can have a bearing\non that because it can have a bearing on evaluating what\nthey've accomplished, and it can have a bearing for the\nreasons I tried to identify earlier to Justice Alito on\nwhat they can bring to the table, what they can bring to\nthat freshman seminar, what they can bring to the\nstudent government, what they can bring to the campus\nenvironment --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right, so. But it is\nthe correct answer to Justice Alito's -- if there are\never two applicants where the GPA, the test -- the\ngrades, the SA1, SA2, leadership, activities, awards,\nwork experience, community service, family's economic\nstatus, school's socioeconomic status, family's\nresponsibility, single-parent home, languages other than\nEnglish spoken at home, and SAT score relative to\nschool's average race, if you had a situation where\nthose -- all those things were absolutely identical,\nthan the person would be admitted on the bounds of race.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Not necessarily.\n(Laughter.)\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Because -- because -- I'm\ntrying to make a simple point here. Neither --\nJUSTICE ALITO: General, if you don't\nlike --\nGENERAL VERRILLI: -- neither -- neither\nmight get in.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Let me withdraw my prior\nquestion if you don't like that.\nBefore your time runs out, let me ask you\nanother question.\nYour ROTC argument -- you make -- you\nmake -- you devote a lot of attention in your brief to\nthe military. Could you explain your ROTC argument to\nme?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Sure.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why is it important for the\nROTC program for commissioned officers that Texas have\nthis other plan on top of the top 10 percent plan?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Our -- our military\neffectiveness depends on a pipeline of well-qualified\nand well-prepared candidates from diverse backgrounds\nwho are comfortable exercising leadership in diverse\nsettings, and --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Oh, I understand that. And\njust -- I don't want to cut you off, but --\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Right.\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- because the time is about\nto expire, so you've got a marginal candidate who wants\nto go to the University of Texas at Austin and is also\ninterested in ROTC. Maybe if race is taken into\naccount, the candidate gets in. Maybe if it isn't, he\ndoesn't get in. How does that impact the military?\nThe candidate will then probably go to Texas\nA&M or Texas Tech? Is it your position that he will be\nan inferior military officer if he went to one of those\nschools?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: No, Justice Alito.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Then I don't understand the\nargument.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: The point of educational\ndiversity, the point of what the University of Texas is\ntrying to achieve is to create an environment in which\neveryone develops an appropriate sense of citizenship,\neveryone develops the capacity to lead in a racially\ndiverse society, and so it will benefit every ROTC\napplicant from the University of Texas.\nAnd 43 percent of the Officer Corps comes\nfrom the ROTC. It's a very significant source of our\nmilitary leadership.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: General, how -- what\nis your view on how we tell whether -- when the\nUniversity has attained critical mass?\nGENERAL VERRILLI: I don't think critical --\nI agree with my friend that critical mass is not a\nnumber. I think it would be very ill-advised to suggest\nthat it is numerical. So --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. I'm hearing a\nlot about what it's not. I'd like to know what it is\nbecause our responsibility is to decide whether this use\nof race is narrowly tailored to achieving, under this\nUniversity's view, critical mass.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: May I answer,\nMr. Chief Justice?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, yes.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Thank you.\nI think -- I don't think that this is a\nsituation in which the Court simply affords complete\ndeference to the University's judgment that it hasn't\nyet achieved the level of diversity that it needs to\naccomplish its educational mission.\nI think that the Court ought to -- has to\nmake its own independent judgment. I think the way the\nCourt would go about making that independent judgment is\nto look at the kind of information that the university\nconsidered. That could be information about the\ncomposition of the class. It could be information about\nclassroom diversity. It could be information about\nretention and graduation rates. It can be information\nabout -- that's specific to the university's context in\nhistory. Is it a university that has had a history of\nracial incidents and trouble or not? A series of\nfactors.\nAnd then what the Court's got to do is\nsatisfy itself that the University has substantiated its\nconclusion based on that -- based on the information\nit's considered, that it needs to consider race to\nfurther advance the educational goals that Grutter has\nidentified as a compelling interest.\nAnd I will say, I do think, as the number of\nminority enrollees gets higher, the burden on the\nuniversity to do that is going to get harder to meet.\nBut I don't think -- I don't think there is a number,\nand I don't think it would be prudent for this Court to\nsuggest that there is a number, because it would raise\nexactly the kind of problem that I -- that I think\nJustice Kennedy identified in the Grutter dissent of\ncreating hydraulic pressure towards that number.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We should probably stop\ncalling it critical mass then, because mass, you know,\nassumes numbers, either in size or a certain weight.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: I agree.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So we should stop calling\nit mass.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: I agree.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Call it a cloud or\nsomething like that.\n(Laughter.)\nGENERAL VERRILLI: I agree that critical\nmass -- the idea of critical mass has taken on a life of\nits own in a way that's not helpful because it doesn't\nfocus the inquiry where it should be.\nIf I may just add one word in conclusion.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure.\nGENERAL VERRILLI: Thank you.\nI think it is important, Your Honors, not\njust to the government, but to the country, that our\nuniversities have the flexibility to shape their\nenvironments and their educational experience to make a\nreality of the principle that Justice Kennedy identified\nin Parents Involved, that our strength comes from people\nof different races, different creeds, different\ncultures, uniting in a commitment to freedom, and to\nmore a perfect union.\nThat's what the University of Texas is\ntrying to do with its admissions policy, and it should\nbe upheld.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.\nMr. Rein, 10 minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BERT W. REIN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. REIN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nThat's more than I expected.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just keeping the\nplaying field level.\nMR. REIN: Well, that's what we're seeking\nin this case, Mr. Chief Justice, a level playing field\nfor Abby Fisher. So it's most apt at this point.\nThere's just three things I want to touch\non. First, there's been a lot of back and forth on\nstanding, but, as we have pointed out, that really\nrelates to merits. And I just want to make clear that\nwe do not accept the premise of that footnote, that she\nwould not have entered under any circumstances; that\nthey've asserted that, but, in fact, she was considered\nfor the summer program, which is --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is your complaint\nlimited to injunctive relief and the return of the $100?\nAs written, is that what it's limited to?\nMR. REIN: No, because it said, \"any and all\nother damages,\" at the point when we were writing it,\nwhich was --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In Arizonans and Alvarez\nwe said any all -- any and other -- all damages is too\nspeculative. Is what you actually see what I said:\nInjunctive relief and the return of the $100.\nMR. REIN: And what I'm saying is that we\nnever had the opportunity to develop the full damages --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In --\nMR. REIN: -- because of --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In Arizonans and Alvarez\nwe said you can't manufacture standing after the fact.\nDid you ask only for injunctive relief and the $100,\nspecifically?\nMR. REIN: The only specific number in the\ncomplaint, because of the point in time when it was\nfiled was the application fee, which we believe --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And you would have paid\nthat no matter what; under any system of admission you\nwould have paid the same $100.\nMR. REIN: You would have paid the fee in\nreturn for a fair processing of the application, which\nshe did not receive, and we think that is a claim that\nwill be sustained. It is not tested at this point.\nAnd the second thing is, because of the way\nthe case was bifurcated, with the agreement of all and\nthe district court as well, we did not develop the\nadditional damages here. We reserved the right to\namend, and as things have progressed --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: For what, nominal\ndamages?\nMR. REIN: No --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And then how do you get\naround Arizonans?\nMR. REIN: Because as -- as in the BIO, what\nUT pointed out was there are other kinds of financial\ninjuries which were not ascertainable at the time the\ncomplaint was filed because we were trying to put her\ninto the university.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: She was going to get a\nbetter job because she went to a different university?\nMR. REIN: That's one of the things they\nsuggested. There are differences in cost between the --\nwhat she paid at LSU and what she would have paid at UT.\nI'm just saying, these are all reserved questions and\nthey don't go to standing. The Court made that clear in\nBakke.\nLet me go to another issue that, you know, I\nthink I never completed my answer to Justice Breyer.\nWhere we stand on what you should do about Grutter is as\nfollows.\nWe recognize, as in the words of -- that the\nSolicitor General just issued -- that there is an\ninterest which is cognizable in diversity. That is --\nthat was the root question in Grutter, could you\nrecognize it at all. But what we are concerned about,\nas you are seeing here, is universities like UT and many\nothers have read it to be green light, use race, no end\npoint, no discernible target, no critical mass written,\nyou know, in circumstances reduced to something that can\nbe reviewed.\nAnd as long as you don't cross two lines,\ndeterminative points and fixed quotas -- \"quotas\"\nmeaning we will fill this quota exclusively with who we\ndeem to be under-represented -- you are okay. We don't\nthink that's the way Grutter was intended. Grutter was\nintended to say this is an area of great caution; using\nrace itself raises all kinds of red flags, so before you\nuse race make a determination whether really, your\ninterest in critical mass -- that is, in the dialogue\nand interchange, the educational interest, is that --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You are not suggesting\nthat if every minority student that got into a\nuniversity got into only the physical education program;\nand in this particular university that -- that physical\neducation program includes all the star athletes; so\nevery star athlete in the school happens to be black or\nHispanic or Asian or something else, but they have now\nreached the critical mass of 10, 15, 20 percent -- that\nthe university in that situation couldn't use race?\nMR. REIN: Well, I think you are talking\nabout --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In the holistic way that\nGrutter permits?\nMR. REIN: Well, if you are saying there's a\n-- a differentiated department of physical education,\nwhich is like a separate college, you have changed the\nnature of the hypothetical.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, it's just that every\none of their students who happens to be a minority is\ngoing to end up in that program. You don't think the\nuniversity could consider that it needs a different\ndiversity in its other departments?\nMR. REIN: Well, if that were the case,\nremember the factor that is causing it, and you are\nassuming, is choice. You have a critical mass of\nstudents. They choose to major in different things, and\nthat's one of the base problems with the classroom\ndiversity concept. They never asked the question why,\nif 40 percent of our students are minorities, are they\nnot in the small classrooms? Why does that happen?\nStatistically you would say that's an aberration. You\nmight ask the question what's causing it? Because in\norder to fit --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Aren't they saying the\nsame thing when they say, when we are looking at the\nholistic measure, we are looking for that student who\nis a -- that minority student who is a nuclear\nscientist?\nMR. REIN: No. Because they don't take into\naccount your interests, they don't ask you, are you\ngoing to join ROTC, they don't ask you are you going to\nmajor -- major in physics. And when it comes time in\nthe UT system to allocate access to different majors,\nthey do that in a way that is basically premised on\nacademic index.\nSo they have a two-tiered admission system.\nThey are only here focused -- their preference goes to\nadmission as such, it doesn't go to sorting people out\nby majors.\nAnd if I might then say to Justice Breyer, I\nthink our answer is, when we see what UT is doing, what\nwe that -- Grutter's -- you know, it has been perceived\nas a green light; go ahead and use race, race which is\notherwise really a highly questionable, an abominable\nkind of sorting out. That unchecked use of race, which\nwe think is -- has been spawned by misreading of\nGrutter, needs to be corralled. So what we --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it any more unchecked\nthan the Harvard plan which -- that started all this off\nin 1978, decided by Justice Powell? Is it any different\nfrom how race is used in our military academies?\nMR. REIN: Well, I mean, they are two\ndifferent questions. The Harvard plan is a very\ndifferent world. It's a plan of wholly individualized\nadmission comparing individuals one on one, to establish\nthe platonic ideal of the class as the educational\nmission. This is not what is going on at UT.\nThis is not an individualized, I will look\nat you. I will score you. I will score you\nindividually. But as they keep saying, at the point of\nadmission, I am not admitting people; I am admitting\ncategories, boxes; and that relates to Justice Alito's\nquestion.\nI thought your hypothetical, Justice Alito,\nwas entirely fair, because in the way they do their\nsystem, in the PAI scoring, you can figure out that two\npeople would have had the same PAI score but for race.\nIt's an add-on. It allows them to boost the PAS\ncomponent of the PAI score. So -- it is not infrequent.\nThere are many, many candidates who will score the same\nPAI, may even have the same AI, and then you boost some\nof them.\nNow, what UT says is, well, we don't boost\nall the minorities. And that -- as they've stood here\ntoday, and they said in their briefs, we want to boost\nthe ones we like. We want those affluent minorities who\nwe think will improve, in our view, dialogue. That is\ncontrary indeed to the fact that they give points in the\nsame system for socioeconomic disadvantage. It's at\nodds with itself.\nBut it's purely race, and it comes to the\nultimate question then, which, Chief Justice, you were\nasking: Where is the end point? If you have nothing to\ngauge the success of the program, if you can't even say\nat the beginning we don't have critical mass because we\ndon't know what it is and we refuse to say what it is,\nthere is no judicial supervision, there is no strict\nscrutiny and there is no end point to what they are\ndoing.\nSo what we have said, and it comes right\nback to Justice Breyer, how would you write it, you can\nclarify it, you can say Grutter properly applies,\nrequires you to do A, B, C, and -- and we've said in our\nbrief that would be satisfactory. But to the extent\nthat you then have it surviving side by side, there\ncould be enormous confusion.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So what you want me to do\nis go read back what we wrote in Grutter, go look what\nthe underlying determinations of critical mass were\nthere, go look exactly how it is being done in Texas --\nwhich I have charts that help me see that -- and I will\nthen find enough of a difference that I can write some\nwords that can be administered by 2,000 or 3,000 -- a\nthousand Federal judges as they try to deal with\nprograms like this, in -- that's the point, is that\nright?\nMR. REIN: Well, I'm saying if you clarify\nthe needs and the necessity point, if you then look at\nsome of the other deficiencies and clarify the -- the\nconsideration of reasonably available alternatives as a\nnecessity, if you then attribute that -- you attribute\nthe weaknesses of the Texas program to the absence of\nthose factors, I think you can fashion a result in this\ncase which may or may not have to, quote, \"overrule\"\nGrutter.\nIt's really a matter, what do you -- do you\nwant to clearly restate what it is that allows the use\nof this odious classification? That's what we are\ntalking about, it's a narrow window; and it should be\nstated as a narrow window.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you don't want to\noverrule Grutter, you just want to gut it.\nMR. REIN: Excuse me?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You just want to gut it.\nYou don't want to overrule it, but you just want to gut\nit.\nMR. REIN: Well --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now you want to tell\nuniversities that once you reach a certain number, then\nyou can't use race anymore.\nMR. REIN: Justice Sotomayor, I don't want\nto gut it. And the only way one could reach that\nconclusion is to assume that Grutter is an unlimited\nmandate without end point to just use race to your own\nsatisfaction and to be deferred to in your use of race.\nThat is unacceptable. That is the invasion of Abigail\nFisher's rights to equal protection of the law.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel,\ncounsel.\n"
