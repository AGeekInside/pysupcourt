Nelson.\nMr. Katyal.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GENERAL NEAL K. KATYAL\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nGENERAL KATYAL: Thank you,\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:\nBackground checks are a standard way of\ndoing business. The Government has required them for\nall civil service employees since 1953 and for\ncontractors since 2005. If the Ninth Circuit in this\ncase held that a constitutional right to informational\nprivacy precluded asking the questions it asked, that\nwas wrong for two basic reasons.\nFirst, the background checks' mere\ncollection of information with accompanying safeguards\nvitiates no constitutional privacy interest. These\nchecks have been going on for millions of employees for\ndozens of years. They are part of the employment\nprocess. They are manifestly not roving checks on\nrandom individuals. And, second -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Katyal, is there any\nlimit to what questions the Government can ask --\nGENERAL KATYAL: Well, the --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- an applicant?\nGENERAL KATYAL: The -- the limits are -- in\nthis case, are the ones on SF-85 and Form 42. And we do\nthink that that's a fairly --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What does that mean?\nGENERAL KATYAL: Well, those two --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you ask somebody,\nwhat's your genetic make-up, because we don't want\npeople with a gene that's predisposed to cancer,\nwhatever other -- could you ask that?\nGENERAL KATYAL: Well, I think that the\nCourt doesn't need to confront that fairly --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We do, because I have to\nstart with the question of what are the limits on the\nGovernment, if any? Are you taking the position that,\nas an employer, there are absolutely none, or are you\ntaking the position that there are some, and what would\nthey be?\nGENERAL KATYAL: Our position is, in a case\nsuch as this, where there are collections on the\nGovernment's dissemination of the information --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what you are saying\nis, there's no limit?\nGENERAL KATYAL: I -- I think that this\nCourt in Whalen -- and there is no decision thus far\nthat has recognized any constitutional limit on the\nGovernment's collection of information, so long as there\nare accompanying safeguards on the disseminations and --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: General Katyal, why are\nwe getting into this? Because this case, it seems to\nme, is a challenge -- your challenge to a preliminary\ninjunction which was quite narrow. There was only one\nquestion at issue. There is no cross-appeal, is there?\nGENERAL KATYAL: There -- there is no\ncross-appeal.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So we have Form 85. The\nonly thing that's in contention there is the question\nabout treatment or counseling. Nothing else. So why\nare we talking about the universe of what questions\nmight be asked?\nAnd on the other form, I take it, it's just\nthe so-called open-ended questions, not everything on\nthe form.\nGENERAL KATYAL: I quite agree, Justice\nGinsburg. That's what I was trying to say to Justice\nSotomayor; that is, I think that this case doesn't force\nthe Court to answer questions it has never really\nanswered, which are the outer limits of what the\nGovernment can do in terms of the collection of\ninformation.\nHere you have a narrow decision by the Ninth\nCircuit, one whose reasoning, I think, could radiate\nvery broadly and undermine Government -- the\nGovernment's background checks generally.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So, what do you think has\nbeen -- there hasn't been a formal injunction entered, a\npreliminary -- a preliminary injunction, has there?\nGENERAL KATYAL: It's only -- it's at the\npreliminary injunction stage.\nBut our -- our point is that the reasoning\nthat the Ninth Circuit used, if adopted -- if adopted to\ncreate a permanent injunction, could preclude the\nGovernment from asking all sorts of questions in\nbackground -- in background checks, not just the ones it\nisolated here, but more general ones, because the Ninth\nCircuit decision is essentially a how-to manual on how\nto question, various individual questions, and\nmicromanage them and inject Federal courts into --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the -- the\nentire Form 85 was approved, and there's no question you\ncould ask about, have you used drugs within the last\nyear? It's only the question about treatment and\ncounseling that's -- that is at issue, right?\nGENERAL KATYAL: That's -- that's all that\nthe Ninth Circuit ruled on at the preliminary injunction\nstage.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does that -- does\nthat ruling stop you from asking that question right now\nthroughout the Ninth Circuit?\nGENERAL KATYAL: Which question? The drug\ntreatment question?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no, no. The --\nyes. Yes, the counseling and treatment question.\nGENERAL KATYAL: Well, there's a -- the\nmandate has been stayed --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.\nGENERAL KATYAL: -- so we haven't been able\nto --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But if we sustained\n-- if we sustain the preliminary injunction, the\nGovernment can't ask that question throughout the --\nthe -- the reach of the Ninth Circuit?\nGENERAL KATYAL: That's exactly correct.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and if we did so,\nit would be because there is an underlying privacy right\nthat's somewhat ill-defined or undefined?\nGENERAL KATYAL: Exactly, Justice Kennedy.\nAnd if this Court were to embrace that reasoning -- and\nthis is my answer to you, Justice Ginsburg, as well --\nthen it doesn't just reach drug treatment. I could\nimagine other litigants doing it for other forms of\nquestions, whatever they may be.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the -- the circuit\nprecedent, as far as the other questions on Form 85 --\nthe circuit said that's okay. It's permissible to ask\nthose questions.\nGENERAL KATYAL: Thus far, that's correct.\nBut I could imagine other litigants coming in, and maybe\nnot just with respect to these questions but questions\non SF-85P or Form 86, any number of other things.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Katyal, what is the\nwell-defined, the well-defined, constitutional right to\ninstitutional -- to informational privacy that the\nGovernment is -- is willing to acknowledge? You -- you\napparently don't -- don't challenge the existence of\nsuch a constitutional right.\nGENERAL KATYAL: Justice Scalia, our\nposition is that the Court doesn't need to answer that\nquestion. It's just like Whalen, because in Whalen this\nCourt assumed the existence of some sort of\nconstitutional right and then said: Is that right\nviolated here?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's a strange way to\nproceed. We normally don't do that, see? If there were\na constitutional right, would it cover this?\nGENERAL KATYAL: I agree --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do we do that in cases? I\ndon't think so.\nGENERAL KATYAL: I agree that in many other\ncontexts, it might not be appropriate, but here I think\nthere are some good reasons why. This Court has had\nspecial reticence to the rule broadly in the range of\nprivacy, and I think the reason is privacy is something\nthat is in flux in ways that other things aren't, both\nin terms of our social understandings, technology, and\nlegislation itself.\nAnd for that reason, I think this Court has\nspoken narrowly whenever it's dealt with --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That would justify not\ndefining it broadly or narrowly. It wouldn't justify\nnot reaching the question of whether there is any such\nconstitutional right at all.\nGENERAL KATYAL: Justice Scalia, that's what\nthis Court has done throughout its history. And Whalen\nwas a unanimous decision, and Nixon, on that particular\nquestion, I don't think there was a disagreement about.\nSo --\nJUSTICE ALITO: How can the Court determine\nthat the right is not violated here without having some\nidea about either the existence or the contours of the\nright?\nGENERAL KATYAL: Well, I think it would just\nbe like in Whalen itself. So in Whalen, the Court said\nthere might be some right to informational privacy, but\nso long as there are safeguards on the disclosure, the\nGovernment's dissemination of the information, that\nmeans that there is no --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Is it -- is it your argument\nthat the Government can collect whatever information it\nwants from private individuals so long as the\ninformation is not publicly disseminated?\nGENERAL KATYAL: No, that's not our\nposition. Our position here is that the Government can\ncollect information so long as it is not disseminated in\nthe employment context. And this case, unlike Whalen,\nis one that has that added fact to it, that the\nGovernment here is asking --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, does it -- does it\nhelp us in finding what this residual background right\nis and asking you: Why is it that you can't disclose\nit?\nGENERAL KATYAL: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Why can't you disseminate\nthe information?\nGENERAL KATYAL: Surely -- we are restricted\nby statute, the privacy of --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Let's assume no statute.\nGENERAL KATYAL: If you assume --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In other words, this is\njust testing whether there is some background\nconstitutional right and how to define it, if we have to\nuse that as a beginning premise.\nGENERAL KATYAL: Absolutely. If we took out\nall of the safeguards that are at issue here, then the\ncase wouldn't be like Whalen or Nixon, in which you had\nthose -- in which you had safeguards in the\ndissemination. And then you would have to confront the\nquestion, which we think you shouldn't confront in this\ncase, for the reasons I said to Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And what would be your\nposition if the -- all this information were disclosed?\nOr that there was an attempt to disclose all the\ninformation, and they asked you for your advice --\nGENERAL KATYAL: Right.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- on a constitutional\nbasis?\nGENERAL KATYAL: Right. I mean, our\nposition is that the Court really shouldn't, for all of\nthe reasons I said, get into it, but if the Court had to\nget into it and ask is there some constitutional right\nthat would be violated, Justice Kennedy, by your\nhypothetical, our answer would be no.\nBut we do think the way that this has been\ntraditionally been handled is legislation. Safeguards\nfor political processes --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So when you say your\nposition would be no, you mean that there is no right of\nany kind under -- I know you don't want us to reach it,\nbut you would say there is no right of any kind for a\ncitizen to tell the Government that that's none of your\nbusiness. The Government will decide that it can ask\nanything of a citizen, so long as you don't disclose it.\nGENERAL KATYAL: Well, in the\nemployment/proprietor context. Okay? So if the Court\nhad to confront that question, it would apply the matrix\nthat Justice Scalia has talked about, the Glucksberg\nmatrix, of whether a right -- the right is firmly rooted\nin the traditions of the people, and -- and ask: Is the\nGovernment's collection --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think it's\nfirmly rooted in our traditions that there is some right\nto tell the Government that's none of your business?\nGENERAL KATYAL: I think there is some\nright. The question about whether it employs in the\nunique employment/proprietor context is one the Court\nhasn't confronted, and our strong -- our strong position\nhere is the Court shouldn't confront it.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What is the test -- what is\nthe test for determining what sort of questions can be\nasked in the employment context? Is there any limit?\nSuppose the -- suppose the Government says,\nwell, we want to know all about your diet; we want to\nknow whether you smoke cigarettes; we want to know\neverything you read; we want to know what your hobbies\nare, what forms of entertainment you enjoy, sexual\npractices, every aspect of your private life, just\nbecause that gives us a better picture of who you are as\nan employee. Is that okay?\nGENERAL KATYAL: Sure. No, there are\nlimits, and I should have said this earlier. If the\nGovernment's collection of information or the disclosure\nof the information burdens some other fundamental\nconstitutional right, that is certainly one limit.\nSo if the Government were collecting\ninformation, Justice Alito, on sexual practices of its\nemployees, it may burden the exercise of other rights.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but that's\nputting those aside. I mean, what about some of the\nhypotheticals that Justice Alito posed? Your diet?\nGENERAL KATYAL: Right. So --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's certainly\nrelevant in the employment context, right? They're\ngoing to have to pay for your health care, worry you\nmight miss things, miss days of work.\nSo I guess the point is: Do you think the\nGovernment's right to inquire in the employment context\nis exactly as broad as a private employer's right?\nGENERAL KATYAL: I do think that if the\nprivate employer -- the private employers are a good\ntemplate. If the Government is simply mirroring what\nprivate employers do, as Justice Scalia said in O'Connor\nv. Ortega, that's a good suggestion that what it's doing\nis reasonable.\nNow, to the extent, Justice Alito, that they\nare gradating far beyond what private employers do, in\nterms of asking about eating habits and the like, I do\nthink that that may pose -- that there may be some\nlimits. The Court doesn't need to confront that here.\nIt simply needs to look at the Ninth Circuit's decision,\nwhich recognize a broad, free-standing right against\ninformational collection of its employees to make sure\nand -- and realize that that is a serious problem for\nthe way the Government does business.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We do have a legislature,\ndon't we, that can place some limits on what the\nGovernment asks employees or anybody else?\nGENERAL KATYAL: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's the same legislature\nthat prohibited the Government from disclosing a lot of\ninformation, isn't it?\nGENERAL KATYAL: That's precisely correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And it's possible that\nthat's the protection that the Framers envisioned,\nrather than having courts ride herd on -- on Government\ninquiries.\nGENERAL KATYAL: It's certainly possible,\nJustice Scalia. I think that all of these hypotheticals\nare enormously interesting, but the --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Were these two forms\napproved by Congress?\nGENERAL KATYAL: The forms themselves were\nnot approved by Congress, but the Privacy Act, which is\nthe main restriction --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's a restriction on\ndisclosure, but the same Congress can change that,\ncorrect?\nGENERAL KATYAL: That's absolutely correct.\nThe Privacy Act has been around since 1975, and the\nGovernment has collected -- you know, it's been used\nmillions of times, SF-85. It's been used 553,000 times\nin the last 4 years, and we have not seen the types of\ndisclosure or complaints that I think animate the worry\nthat my friends on the other side are saying.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is the\nreason -- I've had trouble putting my finger on it --\nthat you need the information about counseling?\nYou already have the information, have you\nused drugs in the past year? I couldn't tell if you\nthought the question about counseling was for the good\nof the employee -- oh, you are taking steps to -- or was\nit to allow you to show, well, it must be serious,\nbecause you need counseling.\nGENERAL KATYAL: It is for the good of the\nemployee, so it's a --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, now that's --\nwhenever the Government comes and says this is for your\nown good, you have to be --\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- you have to be a\nlittle suspicious.\nI mean, if it's -- the employee gets to\nexpand upon his or her answer. They say, tell us about\nit. And they can say, don't worry, I'm in counseling or\ntreatment. And even then, that doesn't sound like it's\nfor their good. It's one thing to say, I had a drink.\nIt's another thing to say, I'm in AA.\nGENERAL KATYAL: Mr. Chief Justice, the way\nthe question is framed is, first, they are asked, have\nyou used illegal drugs in the last year? And then --\nand then, if the answer is yes, provide details and then\nindicate any treatment or counseling received.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now, I had a\nquestion about the way it's worded. You're supposed --\nit says, if you've used it in the last year, detail your\ninvolvement with drugs and any counseling you received.\nDo you understand the counseling question to\nbe limited to the past year, or to reach back as far\nas --\nGENERAL KATYAL: I -- I think that the\nquestion itself is vague.\nNow, the way that our -- that the Office of\nPersonnel Management will process such a form is it will\nprocess anything so long as there is information about\njust drug use on the question --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But do you think\nit's required? I mean, you do sign at the end, this is\ntrue to the best -- do you think it's required to\ndisclose counseling and treatment you received more than\na year back?\nGENERAL KATYAL: No. This is unlike, for\nexample, SF-86, which does ask for treatment and\ncounseling back up to, I think, a 7-year period.\nSo I think this is a much more narrow\ninquiry, and I think the reason for that inquiry is to\nhelp the employee. The Government -- the background\ninvestigation --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The answer to that is\nobvious. It was raised by the other side. If it's for\nthe good of the employee, make it voluntary.\nGENERAL KATYAL: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I\nthink that that's the type -- that that's the type of\ninquiry that this Court rejected in Whalen. Because in\nWhalen, the whole debate in the court, in the district\ncourt below, was, well, if you want to stop doctor\nprescription mills people from providing too many\nnarcotics, you don't need the names and ages of the\npatients. We could change the triplicate forms and\nredact that.\nBut what this Court said on the second page\nof its opinion was it called that Lochnerian, that\nFederal courts shouldn't be policing forms and excising\nor suggesting random different -- you know, a few\ndifferent words here or there.\nAnd here, experts put this form together to\ntry and get at, basically, are you using drugs and are\nyou using treatment which might ameliorate the fact that\nyou had used illegal drugs in the last year.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, I had thought before\nthe argument that one of the purposes for asking about\ntreatment was to identify employees who may have\nundergone treatment on numerous occasions and dropped\nout of programs and been unsuccessful, so as to identify\nchronic drug abusers. But I guess in light of what\nyou've just said, that this only reaches back 1 year,\nthat is not a purpose of this -- this question.\nGENERAL KATYAL: That is correct, and in\npreparation for this, we did survey all of the NASA\ndifferent centers to ask, has treatment ever been used\nin any sort of way to hurt an employee? And the answer\nthat came back was, no, it has not been used. It has\nonly been used to help. It is to retain someone who did\nuse illegal drugs but is taking steps to mitigate.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, how do you\nknow -- how do you know that? I mean, you ask a lot of\nquestions on these forms, and they say, well, we're not\ngoing to hire you. How can you go back and say it was\nbecause you put in, you know, in treatment for -- for\ndrug abuse?\nGENERAL KATYAL: Well, the process by which\nthis takes place is the form is filled out. It is\nultimately sent to an adjudicator if there is negative\ninformation, and that -- and that information is then\ndiscussed with the candidate for employment or the\nemployee to see if they have an explanation. And of the\ntimes that this has happened, that someone has been\ndenied -- and I think the number is 128 times over the\n-- over the last 5 years -- none have been denied for a\npositive answer to drug treatment.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Over the last 5\nyears, this has only come into play 128 times across the\nFederal bureaucracy?\nGENERAL KATYAL: For Federal contractors.\nThat is correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Federal contractors.\nGENERAL KATYAL: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. I'm not sure\nI understand the answer. Only 128 times has somebody\nidentified themselves as a drug user?\nGENERAL KATYAL: One hundred and\ntwenty-eight times, the SF-85 process, is my\nunderstanding, has been used to deny someone a\ncredential of the Federal contractor --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So it could be for any\nother answers as well?\nGENERAL KATYAL: For anything. Exactly.\nAbout -- and I think there have been about 74,000\ncontractors that have sought -- sought badges through\nthe SF-85 since --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you representing to\nus that every employee who is rejected will know the\nreason?\nGENERAL KATYAL: That is correct. That is\npart of -- that is part of the regulations that are in\nplace, so that if someone is denied a credential -- and\nthis is, I think, at Joint Appendix page 180 -- they are\ntold the reason for that denial. They are given an\nopportunity to explain themselves, and a process is then\nput in place. There is then also robust appeal and\nother things that may happen as well.\nBut one thing that doesn't happen, Justice\nSotomayor, is that JPL, the contractor, is not told the\nbasis for why the person is denied a credential, that it\nis private as between the Government -- here, NASA --\nand the individual employee. And that is the --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So where does the\nsuitability matrix come in?\nGENERAL KATYAL: It doesn't.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It doesn't?\nGENERAL KATYAL: It doesn't.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And NASA has never used\nit? You're representing that to the Court?\nGENERAL KATYAL: I'm representing that NASA\nhas -- NASA will not and does not use this employee\nsuitability chart to make contractor credentialing\ndecisions.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Where did it come from?\nGENERAL KATYAL: Well, it's -- it's been\nhard to actually pin down where it came from. I think\nit is derived from earlier Office of Personnel\nManagement materials at a time when it listed out what\nvarious crimes were. And so some of those things that\nare on there that are quite salacious are things that\nOPM, at earlier points in time, looked to, not for\ncontractors, but for Government employees.\nBut I can represent to the Court that NASA\ndoes not and will not use this chart for credentialing\ndecisions.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you -- do you have a\nclear idea of how the Form 42 would have to be amended\nif the Respondents are correct? Form 85, we know, is\nthe excised \"counseling or treatment.\" What in the Form\n85 did the Ninth Circuit say -- it said \"open-ended\nquestions,\" but I looked at the form, and it's not clear\nto me which ones they considered open-ended.\nGENERAL KATYAL: Justice Ginsburg, I quite\nagree with you. I don't think that the Ninth Circuit's\nreasoning is capable of being ameliorated easily.\nSo we talked before about how the drug\ntreatment was just a narrow part of the Ninth Circuit\ndecision, but this Form 42 -- the invalidation of Form\n42, goes to the heart of what the Government does all\nthe time and what all employers do. They ask open-ended\nquestions to figure out whether someone is trustworthy\nand reliable. I think as Judge --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: General -- I'm sorry.\nGo ahead and finish.\nGENERAL KATYAL: I think as Judge Kleinfeld\nsaid, that's how law clerks are hired, and that's how\nbaristas at Starbucks are hired. You have to ask these\nopen-ended questions because as an employer, you don't\nreally know what -- where the pressure points or danger\nspots in an individual application are.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is your position today\nthat our ruling should say that the Government is free\nto ask, as a private employer or a contractor -- it is\nfree to ask any question it wants whatsoever?\nGENERAL KATYAL: That is not what we're\nsaying. We --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If you were not saying\nthat, then what's the narrower ruling? Because that's\nwhat I thought I heard at the beginning of our colloquy\ntoday.\nGENERAL KATYAL: Justice Sotomayor, the\nnarrow rule is what we said in our petition and what we\nsaid on the very last page of our reply brief and all\nthroughout, which is, this Court should simply say what\nit said in Whalen, which is assuming that there is some\nsort of right to informational privacy, the -- the use\nof a background check with accompanying safeguards to\ncollect information doesn't violate any constitutional\nright to privacy.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, why wouldn't that\nviolate it if the question involved a fundamental right?\nIf you were asking the question that Justice Alito\nasked, which is, what's your sexual practices in the\nbedroom, if there are security checks against you\ndisclosing it, you're saying even that would be okay?\nGENERAL KATYAL: I could imagine a\ncircumstance far afield from this one in which the\nGovernment's just mere collection of information about\nsexual practices might burden the exercise of those\nrights. I'm saying it's not at all present here, but --\nand I don't think the Court should get into it.\nBut that's a really different question than\nthe one here, which is: Is there some free-standing\nright to constitutional privacy that is unburdened by\nthe fact that there are protections against the\ndisclosure of information? Here, the Privacy Act\nimposes strong protections against the disclosure of\ninformation. And so what's left is a very residual\ninterest in the part of the employees.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Don't -- this is a bit\nunsatisfying because you start by saying to us, as long\nas there are some nondisclosure protections, then\nvirtually any question, whether it impinges a\nfundamental right or not, would be okay, because\nthere's -- I don't even know what the Government's\ninterest is in asking every question it wants to.\nThere has to be a need for a set of\nquestions, doesn't there?\nGENERAL KATYAL: Well, I could imagine an\nas-applied challenge to, for example, you know, the\nhypothetical on sexual practices or whatever.\nI do think, as Justice Scalia said, the real\ncheck on that is the political process check. The fact\nis that the Government doesn't ask those kinds of\nquestions, and -- and to the extent it ever did, the\nCourt could confront that in an as-applied challenge.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I still don't see why\nthat -- why the universe is before us, because the Ninth\nCircuit said some of this form is okay; most of Form 85\nis okay, and some of Form 42 is okay. I thought it was\nonly the questions under 7 and 8, the open-ended\nquestions. I didn't think the Ninth Circuit had\nenjoined anything other than those questions.\nGENERAL KATYAL: Those questions,\nJustice Ginsburg, are really the heart of the form. I\nmean, those are the most -- in many ways the most\nimportant questions, because they're the ones that\nemployers have to ask because they don't know the\nweaknesses in an individual applicant's background.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: There are a number of\nstatements in, I guess, the concurrence from the denial\nof en banc, explaining how JPL is fairly open, and it is\nclose to the Pasadena courthouse. Pasadena residents\nand judges visit JPL often.\nAre there any statements of fact that you\ndon't agree with that are not in the record, other than\nthe matrix question? Leave that aside.\nGENERAL KATYAL: Well, yes, I mean, I would\nsay a few things. Number one is I think that the\nconcurring judge did -- did, I think, underestimate how\nimportant security is there.\nFirst of all, there are armed guards when\nyou're coming in. It is not the campus-like atmosphere.\nIt's not like a campus I'm familiar that she described.\nThe information at the debate -- at JPL is sensitive,\nquite sensitive, both, you know, in terms of\nscientifically and with respect to our nation's secrets.\nAnd I think more important point about this\nis the badge that the Plaintiffs were seeking access to\ndon't -- doesn't just give them access to JPL. It will\nalso give them other access to all other NASA\nfacilities. And it's such an important credential that\nit would allow them to get within, for example, 6 to 10\nfeet of the space shuttle as it's being repaired and\nreadied for launch. So this is a credential not just\nfor JPL and getting onto JPL, but other places as well.\nIf I could reserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.\nMr. Stormer.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAN STORMER\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. STORMER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe issue as now characterized is really how\nfar may a Government go, may this Government go, to\nintrude into the private lives of its citizens, both in\npositions that do not involve sensitive issues,\nclassified issues, national security issues, or\npositions of public trust?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Stormer, what provision\nof the Constitution are you relying -- I looked at your\ntable of authorities in your brief, and you have cases\nlisted, you have statutes listed; there is not a single\ncitation anywhere in your brief to a provision of the\nConstitution.\nWhat provision of the Constitution are you\nrelying on?\nMR. STORMER: It would mostly fall --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think it's a very nice\nthing that the Government shouldn't ask intrusive\nquestions. I also think it's a nice thing that the\nGovernment should pay a living wage to its employees,\nbut I don't feel authorized to go around saying how much\nthe Government should pay each of its employees because\nthere is nothing in the Constitution about that, and the\nquestion is left to Congress.\nWhat do you rely on in the Constitution that\nenables me to decide how much intrusiveness is too much,\nrather than leaving that to Congress?\nMR. STORMER: It would flow from the ordered\nconcept of liberty component of the Fifth Amendment, as\nwell as the First Amendment.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The Fifth Amendment? Okay.\nWhich says no person shall be deprived of what?\nMR. STORMER: Of life -- I mean, no person\nshall be deprived of due process of law, and then the\nlast --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Due process of law.\nMR. STORMER: -- refers to the concept of --\nordered concept of liberty.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: All right. That -- that's\nwhat I thought. You're talking substantive due process\nhere.\nMR. STORMER: Well, the Whalen case, the\nNixon case, and to some extent, the Reporters Committee\ncase refer to this concept of privacy. And they are, in\nfact, vague, but they do talk about the concept of\nprivacy as being the right to control information about\noneself.\nAnd -- and both -- and all of the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, I like that, but I\njust don't see it anywhere in the Constitution. That's\nall I'm taking about.\nMR. STORMER: Well, I -- there -- those\ncases, in fact, do not refer to a term called\n\"informational privacy.\" Those terms have grown from\nthe various cases that have flowed from the\ndeterminations in Whalen and Nixon and, to some extent,\nReporters Committee.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So that right is subject\nto what level of scrutiny? Is it always strict\nscrutiny? And how do you square Whalen and Nixon's\nbalancing with strict scrutiny?\nMR. STORMER: The -- the standard would\nbe -- I think the appropriate standard was applied by\nthe Ninth Circuit, which is a legitimate state interest\nnarrowly tailored to meet that need.\nIn this case, there is some -- like the Von\nRaab case, which is not cited in our brief but which is\na Fourth Amendment case, the -- this Court used a\ncompelling state interest standard for a Fourth\nAmendment invasion. And in that case, the Court\nremanded on the issue of whether or not the positions\ninvolved classified or sensitive materials.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So what is your view of\nwhat the liberty -- you're saying that the words in the\nConstitution that protect the right that you claim was\nviolated are the words, \"No person shall be\" -- I\nguess -- \"deprived of life, liberty, or property,\nwithout due process of law.\" I guess you mean the word\n\"liberty.\"\nMR. STORMER: That's correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. And in your\nwords, it is liberty -- define it. Liberty to what?\nMR. STORMER: Liberty to control information\nabout oneself. The liberty to --\nJUSTICE BREYER: There is a right to liberty\nto control information about oneself?\nMR. STORMER: Without governmental\nintrusion.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. And all\ninformation? Some information?\nMR. STORMER: Well, there --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Liberty -- there's a\nliberty to control all information? Protected from --\nfrom what? From the state? The state doesn't have a\nright to give you any -- get any information about you?\nOn a driver's license? It's -- what? When does it come\ninto play?\nMR. STORMER: It comes into play when the\ngovernment, the state, seeks to intrude and obtain\ninformation from an individual. The -- the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So the fact that the\ngovernment says -- I go and I want my driver's license,\nand they say fill out the form, we want to see how\nyou -- if you can drive or not, that potentially could\nviolate the Constitution?\nMR. STORMER: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Potentially. It might not,\nbecause it might be justified, but each such case would\nhave to be justified. Is that -- is that your theory?\nMR. STORMER: Any intrusion into private\nlives would have to have some --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It says \"liberty.\" The\nliberty, you said, was liberty to control information\nabout yourself.\nMR. STORMER: That was the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So I want to know how that\nworks. Every time anyone in the Government asks a\nquestion about you personally -- of course, it wouldn't\nbe unconstitutional -- but every time it would have to\nbe a justified thing; is that -- is that your theory?\nI'm just asking.\nMR. STORMER: That -- yes, it is.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So that's all\ninformation about yourself?\nMR. STORMER: Well --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I think what Justice\nBreyer is getting to and that I'm trying to figure out\nis you've used the word \"privacy.\" What does privacy\nrelate to?\nMR. STORMER: Privacy relates, in this case,\nto the --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, I'm talking\nabout -- answer his broad question, which is -- you've\ndefined the constitutional right to information about\nyourself.\nMR. STORMER: Correct.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is that all information\nabout yourself, including your date of birth, your\nSocial Security number, your -- where you live, where\nyou've gone to school, who your friends, who your\nreferences are? Because as broadly as you've defined\nthat, it would include all of that.\nMR. STORMER: It -- the -- the nature of\nwhat is included can be intruded upon based upon a\ngovernmental need. So if there's a rational basis for\nknowing Social Security numbers, driver's license,\ncensus information, that type of information, then --\nthen there's not an issue.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So this gets back to\nJustice Sotomayor's earlier question. You just said if\nthere is a rational basis, so is that the test?\nMR. STORMER: The test --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No matter what type\nof information? I suppose it's harder to show a\nrational basis when you get into certain areas that --\nthat concern you, but is it a rational basis test?\nMR. STORMER: In this case, I think it's a\nlegitimate state interest, narrowly tailored to meet\nthat interest, Your Honor. It's --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But in the case of a\ndate of birth for a driver's license, you say it's\nrational basis?\nMR. STORMER: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And so, what -- how do we\ndecide? I'm a little interested, if you could spend 2\nor 3 minutes elaborating this.\nA number of laws, Federal laws -- I imagine\nthe regulations fill this room, and I think many --\nmaybe more, maybe several rooms. And many of them\ninvolve asking people for information. And the number\nof forms that ask people for information, I guess, about\nthemselves, might fill several rooms. And I can imagine\nin a country of 300 million people, you would find\nsomeone objecting to many of the questions.\nAnd so, how is the system supposed to work,\nin your view, where judges will decide whether a\nparticular question -- I'm not saying you're wrong. I\njust wanted to get an idea from you as to how this legal\nsystem works, where any question asked by the Government\nabout a person is potentially subject to challenge as\nunconstitutional. You and I will agree that many are\nfine. But you are worried about some that aren't fine.\nHow does it work, the system, distinguishing\nthe ones from the other?\nMR. STORMER: Well, this Court has done much\nof that already in a whole history of cases:\nContraception, procreation, marriage, sexual relations,\nfamily relations --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The fundamental rights\nissue that the Sixth Amendment identified, are those the\nquestions that are subject to that greater scrutiny?\nMR. STORMER: The -- the rights that go --\nthe questions that go to those types of -- which could\nelicit that type of information.\nFor instance, on Form 42, if they said, tell\nus any adverse information you have about this person,\nwhich includes any other matters. This could be -- they\ncould respond with saying, well, I don't like the way\nhe -- how many kids he has; I don't like his religion; I\ndon't like his sexual practices.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But isn't that question,\nthat kind of open-ended question, routinely used in\nemployment situations? That is, the employer wants to\nknow is there any adverse information about this person?\nDoesn't know which question to ask, because there's a\nwhole -- many things that could be relevant.\nSo are you suggesting that that kind of\nquestion is off-limits to the Government, although it is\nroutinely used in other employment sectors?\nMR. STORMER: It is not routinely used in\nemployment sectors where there is allowed to inquiry --\ninquiry into non-employment-related --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, it has a legend on\nthe top. Everything that we are asking you is meant\nto -- to determine suitability for employment. So they\nwant to find out information relevant to suitability for\nemployment.\nMR. STORMER: And for security clearances.\nThose are the two issues.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- I have to agree\nwith the implication of Justice Ginsburg's remark, at\nleast what I imply from it.\nLook at the private employment sphere. It\nseems to me that for a sensitive position, a bank who\nhas people taking care of -- its employees taking care\nof other people's money, or the medical profession, that\nthe employer could be sued and would be remiss if it did\nnot ask this question.\nDo you know anything adverse about this\nperson whom we're going to hire for a very sensitive\nposition?\nMR. STORMER: That --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: This is done all the time,\nand we do it with -- a judge said below, with our law\nclerks.\nMR. STORMER: That would be exactly my\npoint, Your Honor. It is in those situations where\nthere are sensitive issues, you're allowed to inquire\nbased on the need.\nBut here, they are inquiring -- the snack\nbar worker, the -- the bus driver, the gift shop\noperator, are -- are required to respond to these\nquestions. The GS-4 Interior Department clerk. The\nGovernment's position is all of those are subject to\nthis same type of inquiry.\nJUSTICE ALITO: I don't see what the\nalternative, as a practical matter, is to asking this\nsort of open-ended question. The -- the alternative\nwould seem to be to try to compile a list of every\npossible thing that the -- the person might do that\nwould raise serious questions about suitability for\nemployment or would be disqualifying for employment.\nAnd that seems to be impractical.\nThere's almost no limit to the -- the sorts\nof things that might be relevant in that respect; isn't\nthat right?\nMR. STORMER: This goes to the very basic\nquestion of why does the Government need to know this\ninformation for these individuals, most of whom have\nbeen there for 20 to 30 years? The Government can't\nshow a single instance of any of these individuals doing\nanything that would require any of the type of\nscrutiny --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you then saying that\nthese people have to be grandfathered or grandparented\nbecause they worked for 20 years --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- without --\nMR. STORMER: I am not, Your Honor. But the\nGovernment has some burden to show a need to inquire\ninto these privacy areas. It needs to know if you have\ngone to the Betty Ford Clinic.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you are making a --\nyou said that these people have worked there for\n20 years. Are they different from the new employee?\nAre you suggesting it's okay for the new employee, but\nnot okay --\nMR. STORMER: I am not.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- for the person who is\nalready in the job?\nMR. STORMER: I -- I am not. The -- the\ndifference between this case and, ultimately, what was\nallowed in both Whalen and Nixon -- excuse me,\nparticularly in Whalen -- is that there was some\noverarching societal need to have this information.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, suppose the person who\nworks at the -- at the gift shop or the snack bar -- I\nthink that's what you mentioned -- has a big sign on his\nfront lawn that says, \"I hope the space shuttle blows\nup.\"\nIs that information the Government has a\nlegitimate reason to get?\nMR. STORMER: I would agree that -- that in\nthat instance, \"I hope the space shuttle blows up,\"\nwould certainly implicate some First Amendment issues,\nbut the Government should know that information.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And now, what's the\nalternative to acquiring that information through an\nopen-ended question? You have to have a specific\nquestion on the form: Does this individual have a big\nsign on his front lawn that says --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- \"I hope the space shuttle\nblows up\"?\nMR. STORMER: I wouldn't think that that\nwould be needed. I think that --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do you see what I am getting\nat? I don't see how you are going to do this, other\nthan by asking an open-ended question.\nMR. STORMER: Only if you need to know the\nanswers. And for the snack bar worker or the GS\nclerk-typist, for those types of people who have no\naccess to sensitive information, do not -- it can -- the\ndefinition here is that these are no- or low-risk --\nthey are low-risk employees, which is defined as, if\nthey misuse their position, they will have little or no\nimpact on the agency mission.\nSo we know that these questions are being\nasked of people who, if they completely misused their\nposition, there will be no impact --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- just to -- I'd\nlike to get back to Justice Breyer's question.\nSo now you not only have to decide which\nquestions -- they can challenge any question they want\nand say this isn't pertinent, but you also have to\ncategorize which employees are being asked that\nquestion.\nThis is a -- SF means \"standard form,\"\nright?\nMR. STORMER: It does.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that -- you\nknow, it's a big government, and they can't tailor every\ninquiry, every form, to the individual applicant.\nMR. STORMER: It -- it can to the positions.\nThis -- this -- what is being done now, if they've done\n70,000 inquiries, that means -- and 128 issues arose,\nthat means a whole host of people, over 69,000 people,\nhave had to give up information that otherwise they\nwould not have to give up --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you suggesting\nthat this is no good for Government employment? You\nwere dealing with a contractor here, but this form, as I\nunderstand it, has been used for -- for many years for\nstandard Government employment.\nIs it -- are they okay? And for\nnonsensitive positions, are you -- are you arguing just\nGovernment contractor or are you saying even for the\nGovernment employee, the person who's hired to work at\nthe snack bar in the Senate, let's say, the Government\ncan't ask these questions?\nMR. STORMER: If I understand Your Honor's\nquestion, and I apologize, I -- I think this cannot be\nasked of -- these questions cannot be asked of people\nfor whom the Government does not have a justifiable need\nto know that information.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But we can handle those\ndetails. My goodness, it's all right there in the\nConstitution. And we can decide what -- what employees\nhave to know what, and what questions you can ask them,\nand how much privacy is too much privacy, right?\nMR. STORMER: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's a piece of cake.\nMR. STORMER: The Government is -- claims to\nbe acting as the employer here. In fact, it is not. It\nis -- it's once or twice removed. But assuming that the\nGovernment is the employer, there is a massive amount of\nwaste that is generated by this form.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You are -- you are\nattacking these forms for all Government employment, not\njust the contractors?\nMR. STORMER: I -- I don't -- it -- I think\nit would apply to all of those people who are in\nnonsensitive positions. This is the Government's\ndefinition; it's not our definition. We chose the\nGovernment's definition.\nAnd if it is a low-risk or a no-risk\nemployee, then the Government doesn't have a need to\nknow. A private employer could not --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you don't\nknow -- you don't know if it's a low-risk employee until\nyou find out what he -- he or she is like or what the\nneighbor thinks. Well, you know, he keeps practicing\nplanting bombs or something. I mean, then he becomes a\nhigh-risk employee. You don't know until you get the\ninformation. That's the reason you ask for it.\nMR. STORMER: In the context of these\nemployees for this particular case, we absolutely know,\nbecause the Government went through, and of the 7,500\nemployees there, it categorized 97 percent as low- or\nno-risk employees. So, we know in this context where\nthey are already employed and it's just a badging\nprocedure. What the Government did here --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. I thought -- I\nthought that your friend said that the badge enables you\nto get within 10 feet of the shuttle?\nMR. STORMER: I don't know that for a fact.\nI do know that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, do you contradict\nthat? And if it's so, how can you say that these people\nare low-risk employees?\nMR. STORMER: Because the Government says\nthey are low- or no-risk employees.\nThis is a campus atmosphere. I have been\nthere. I have seen it. If you want -- if I want to go\non, I just call up Dr. Nelson and say, can you get me\non? If I'm on there, and my car breaks down and I call\nup and I say can the AAA auto come on, I just call the\ngate and the AAA auto person, they say, yeah, just let\nhim in. The -- the people who have -- bring supplies on\nthey just come on. This is a campus where they don't\nhave --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Does al-Qaeda know all this\nstuff?\nMR. STORMER: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Does al-Qaeda know this?\n(Laughter .)\nMR. STORMER: Well, the interesting response\nto that, Your Honor, is that it wouldn't matter if they\nknew this, because it's open, transparent science by a\ncivilian agency in a campus atmosphere. This is not\na -- weapons, national security --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What you're\nsaying -- what you're saying is it may not make much\nsense to have the people here fill out Standard Form 85,\nbut the Government can't tailor its open -- opening\nsecurity form to people that -- you know, maybe down the\nroad at a different NASA laboratory, they do work on\nmore sensitive information. It's a standard form. The\nGovernment has to do things in a standard way.\nMR. STORMER: And the Government has a form\nfor those people who work in classified information.\nThat's SF-85P, SF-85S, and SF-86. The Government can\nstandardize, and when it acts as the employer, it has an\nobligation, because it can't take both it's ability and\nauthority as the Government and -- and overreach into\nthe private lives of its citizens. The questions that\nare being asked here would not be allowed for a private\nemployer --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm -- I'm very surprised\nto hear that. I thought that -- that it -- there were\nin -- in the private sector similar questions.\nMR. STORMER: Similar but not questions that\nwould go -- you couldn't, as a private employer, say you\nhave to turn over your medical records, you have to turn\nover --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Where does it say you\nhave to turn over your medical records?\nMR. STORMER: That's in SF -- SF-85 page 6,\nwhich is the release. And all of this has to be\ninquired into --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Under what -- under\nwhat law could you -- a private employer not ask for\nthose records?\nMR. STORMER: In the State of California\nunder the right to privacy.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, we're talking\nabout under general federal law.\nMR. STORMER: Most -- general federal law, I\ncannot answer that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it's a matter of\nstatutory law.\nMR. STORMER: Yes -- well, in some States\nthere's a -- where there's a privacy right.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Question 42, do you\nhave -- pardon me. Question 7 on Form 42, the -- the\nstandard one -- do you have any adverse information\nabout this person's employment, residence, or activities\nconcerning, and so forth -- a violation of the law? Are\nyou saying that private employers cannot ask that\nquestion?\nMR. STORMER: They can't ask the question --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The prospective private\nemployer?\nMR. STORMER: -- in the context of the\nrelease which is SF-85 page 6, which requires that you\nrelease your private records, extensive records,\nresidential, retail businesses, where you shop, your\neducational, your --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I'm asking whether or\nnot a private employer can ask third persons the\nquestion that's at Form 42 question 7. I thought your\nrepresentation to me was that private employers cannot\nask that question.\nMR. STORMER: I -- I -- if I said that, Your\nHonor, I misspoke. The question goes --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But that was enjoined by\nthe court below; was it not?\nMR. STORMER: It was.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: All right.\nMR. STORMER: Question 7 talks about\nfinancial integrity, mental and emotional stability,\ngeneral -- general behavior or conduct, or other\nmatters. If a private employer, in many States, goes\ninto non-employment-related issues, it's -- it's\ncontrary to --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is your view on that\nquestion? You know, there's a famous, funny example\nthat supposedly may be untrue. Senator Hruska used to\nask and say -- in giving a reference, he would write\nabout someone, you'll be lucky if you can get Smith to\nwork for you. That's --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's the kind of thing\nthat you might want to know, and despite the ambiguity\nthere, and it seemed to me that question 7 sort of drove\nat that. And so -- but they did enjoin it. So, in your\nview, is that aspect of the injunction wrong?\nMR. STORMER: No.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right, then, if it's\nright, why is it right? Because it seems to me the\nbasic thing any employer would want to know is whether\nI'm lucky to get this person to work for me, that kind\nof thing.\nMR. STORMER: Any employer can ask issues\nthat are employment-related and based upon the nature of\nthe job. You can ask those questions, but any employer\ncan't require, as a condition of employment, that you\nsign a release that gives them all manner of information\nas to where you shop, how you shop --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, what is the\nspecific thing about question 7 that you think is\nunlawful or should be changed? What words do you object\nto in that question?\nMR. STORMER: Well, other matters, general\nbehavior or conduct, certainly.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So they cannot\nask, do you have any information about this person's\nemployment, residence, or activities concerning general\nbehavior or conduct or other matters? Now, I am an\nemployer and I'd like to find out if he's going to do a\ngood job. So what am I supposed to say? There doesn't\nseem to be a place here other than that to get into that\nquestion.\nMR. STORMER: That's because these -- this\nquestion for the types of situations is not needed. The\nquestion that is needed is, what are the characteristics\nthat you feel he has for this job?\nJUSTICE BREYER: I see. I see.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why do you say a private\nemployer could not ask a question of such detail? Why\ncould not --\nMR. STORMER: Primarily because of the\nrelease. That's the sixth page of Standard Form 85.\nThat release just allows the Government --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why could a private\nemployer not -- not do it?\nMR. STORMER: Because, in virtually every\nState, there are laws requiring the disclosure of\nprivate information --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you mean that\nlegislatures take care of these matters? I find it\ncurious that in order to establish a Federal\nconstitutional right, which turns this area over to this\nCourt, you invoke laws that have been democratically\nenacted by State legislatures. I mean, if indeed that's\n-- that's the criterion, maybe you don't need us.\nMR. STORMER: I -- the reason I invoke that\nis because the Government has stated that any private\nattorney could ask these questions, and that's a\nmisstatement of the law in most States.\nJUSTICE ALITO: May I ask you this question\nabout the question on drug treatment? Would it be\nunconstitutional for the Government to take the position\nthat to require an employee or applicant for employment\nto disclose whether this individual had violated Federal\nor State drug laws and take the position that if the\nperson gave an affirmative answer that was\ndisqualifying, would that be unconstitutional?\nMR. STORMER: If they've said I violated\nState or Federal laws, not on its face so long as if it\nsaid voluntarily you may show mitigation that -- that\nwould show that this is not a problem that would make\nyou unfit for the job.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So they could -- they could\nsay, have you bought, sold, used drugs in violation of\nFederal or State law? If so, you're disqualified,\nunless you can show that you have had treatment. And\nthen it's up to you to disclose whether you've had\ntreatment.\nMR. STORMER: That's correct.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What's really the difference\nbetween that regime and this -- and what you have here?\nMR. STORMER: The difference is here is\nbecause it is compelled. It's a compelled disclosure\nand not offering you the opportunity to make a showing.\nAnd in this concept, the appeal right that you have from\nthis is not a robust appeal right that was described.\nIt's a very limited appeal that's internal to the\ndepartment, that does not have a right to confront or\ncross-examine --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Can I ask you to clarify\nyour understanding of what has been enjoined? We know\nit's easy for Form 85. For Form 42, you mentioned the\nreleases. I thought that the Ninth Circuit's order\ncovers parts of question 7 and perhaps question 8. I\ndidn't see -- is there something, maybe I missed it,\nthat says they can ask for release of the records?\nMR. STORMER: There was in the emergency\norder specific reference to the -- to the release.\nThere was not in the final order, but the order -- the\nquestion can't -- has to be read in the context of the\nrelease, because that's how they get to -- if you go to\nthe Betty Ford Clinic --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But they didn't say,\nGovernment, you can't ask for the release.\nMR. STORMER: They did not.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: They said you can't ask\nopen-ended questions.\nMR. STORMER: That's correct. They did not\nsay that, but it has to be implicit in their ruling\nbecause in many of the cases --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If somebody is going to\nbe enjoined, I mean, it can't be implicit in the ruling\nif you are enjoined. Because it has been stayed, you\ndon't have a formal order, but you can't say, well, it's\nimplicit in the, how many page, opinion.\nMR. STORMER: The -- well, in the court\nbelow, for instance, the argument that the Government\nmade was that they needed to have the medical records,\nnot that they just needed this information, that they\nneeded to have the medical records.\nThe question that logically flows is, what\ncan they do with this information once they learn that\nyou had counseling? Then I guess they can ask you who\nthe counsellor was, what you told the counsellor, what\nwas the purpose of --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: As I understand this\nprocess, this is not an oral interview. It's not -- you\nfill out a form, you meet somebody, and they ask\nfollow-up questions. This is -- this handled on the\npapers, right?\nMR. STORMER: It's handled -- first you\nreveal the information, and then there are 22 approvers\nat JPL, civilians who are not employed by NASA. They\nreview it; then it goes to NASA and then there's a whole\nseries --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. But is there -- is\nthere an oral interview in this process?\nMR. STORMER: There is not.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So then they wouldn't\nsay -- it says here, so I'm going to ask this, that, and\nthe other thing. There's this -- it's a\nwritten procedure.\nMR. STORMER: I may have misspoken. It\ndoesn't preclude an oral interview. I am not aware of\noral interviews having been made or taken.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You said there are 22\npeople at JPL that are involved in the employment?\nMR. STORMER: There are 22 in the -- the\nGovernment has approved 22 so-called approvers, who are\nat JPL, who look over -- who are eligible to look over\nthese forms and the responses to the forms.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What do you\nunderstand the scope of the preliminary injunction to\nbe? Does it bar the solicitation of this information\nthroughout the Ninth Circuit or only with respect to\nJPL?\nMR. STORMER: At this point, it only applies\nto -- well -- this is not before the -- part of the\nrecord, but when it went back to the district court, the\ndistrict court and all parties agreed that it would only\napply -- HSPD-12 would be limited to these 28\nindividuals, that investigation.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nGeneral Katyal, you have 4 minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nGENERAL KATYAL: Justice Ginsburg, you had\nasked earlier whether this was a narrow decision on just\na couple of questions, and I think that the argument\nthat you just heard from my friend illustrates that it's\nnot. He asks for a, quote, \"free-standing right to\ncontrol information\" --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But whatever he asks, we\nare reviewing a judgment.\nGENERAL KATYAL: Right. And the judgment --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And the judgment is not\nthe universe; it's certain questions can be asked.\nGENERAL KATYAL: And the judgment is based\non the following rationale -- this is from the Petition\nAppendix at page 18a from the Ninth Circuit. \"If the\nGovernment's actions compel disclosure of private\ninformation, it has the burden of showing that its use\nof the information would advance a legitimate state\ninterest and that its actions are narrowly tailored to\nmeet the legitimate interest.\"\nNow, that reasoning was used to invalidate a\nquestion, as Justice Kennedy said, on Form 42, that\nemployers ask all the time. Banks ask it and the like.\nAnd it's a -- and it's used to invalidate parts of a\nstandard form that the Government uses day in and day\nout and that employers generally use in order to make\nemployment decisions.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you conceding you\ncan't meet that standard, or are you saying that the\nNinth Circuit misapplied that standard?\nGENERAL KATYAL: Well, no, we're not\nconceding that at all. I do think we would meet the\nstandard, but our point is it's the same point as in\nEngquist, in the Chief Justices's opinion in Engquist v.\nOregon, which is forcing the Government to have to march\ninto court every time and justify a question here or an\nemployee there or soup clerk here or whatever, all of\nthose different inquiries pose practical burdens on the\nability of the Government to operate. And so --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you think there's\nsomething wrong with the Government having to explain\nwhy it seeks information? I mean, I would think that\nwould be fairly simple in virtually every situation.\nGENERAL KATYAL: I think --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I ask that question\nbecause that begs the question of can you ask anything\nyou want regardless of why?\nGENERAL KATYAL: I think that political\nprocess ensures that the Government generally has to ask\n-- has answer that question writ large, but in order for\nthe Ninth Circuit's reasoning to apply, it would permit\nany individual person here or there to ask the\nquestion --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't see how that's so\nbecause, at least if you're in the Ninth Circuit, you\nknow that the Ninth Circuit has blessed all the\nquestions on that form but one.\nGENERAL KATYAL: Well, that's only --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So, I mean, you could\nraise the question, but you'd be out of court in a\nminute.\nGENERAL KATYAL: Justice Ginsburg, I think\nthat's only because the challenge -- or the Petitioners\nhere only challenge certain questions. Now, I could\nimagine other petitioners challenging other questions.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought they did in the\nlower court but abandoned it here, challenge the\nquestion about the drug use.\nGENERAL KATYAL: The drug use piece, but I\ncould imagine all sorts of inquires about other aspects\nof the form. And, indeed, the rationale, the language\nthat I just read to you is a road map for anyone to be\nable to come in and say, well, this -- this question\nisn't -- isn't necessary for me because I got a\nbackground clearance before, I'm rehired, or whatever.\nAnd it would be a huge practical burden in the same way\nas recognizing the cause of action in Engquist was a\npractical burden. Instead, we think what the Court\nshould do here is what it did in Whalen, which is\nrecognize governments collect information all the time,\ncollect --\nJUSTICE ALITO: How much of the information\nthat's at issue here can be released and to whom?\nGENERAL KATYAL: The information that can be\ncollected that's released here is governed by the\nPrivacy Act. And so there are -- the appendix to our\nbrief lists out precisely to whom they could be released\nto, and that has been around since 1975. We've seen\nvirtually no complaints about the Government disclosing\nthis type of background information on the SF-85.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that also within the\nGovernment itself? I know the Privacy Act says the\nGovernment can't disclose, but how about checks -- I\nmean, we have a vast government -- checks about\ncirculating the information within the Government?\nGENERAL KATYAL: If it is for a -- if it is\nto further the Government purpose for which the\ninformation is collected, it can be distributed to other\nfolks in the Government. There are restrictions on\nthat, so -- and they're specified in the Privacy Act,\nand they're quite extensive. And to the extent the\nCourt is concerned that there is something that isn't\nrobust enough in the Privacy Act, we suggest that would\n-- that could wait for an as-applied challenge down the\nroad when information is disclosed.\nAnd we don't think it will, but if, heaven\nforbid, that happens, that's the basis for an as-applied\nchallenge down the road. But here what they're asking\nyou to do is invalidate questions and forms that the\nGovernment asks all of its employees and now just wants\nto ask contractors.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.\n"
