        "content": "(11:18 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in Case 08-214, Atlantic Sounding v. Townsend.\nMr. McCreadie.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID W. McCREADIE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. McCREADIE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nMr. Townsend is a Jones Act seaman who seeks\npunitive damages for the willful failure to pay\nmaintenance and cure.\nLike the unseaworthiness claim in Miles, Mr.\nTownsend's maintenance and cure claim is a general\nmaritime law cause of action. Mr. Townsend cannot\nrecover punitive damages under his general maritime law\ncause of action because those damages are unavailable\nunder the Jones Act FELA, and to a lesser extent DOHSA.\nThis Court's decision in Miles requires\nuniformity between the damages that a seaman can recover\nunder general maritime law and the damages that a seaman\ncan recover under the guiding statutes.\nThose guiding statutes again are the Jones\nAct, the FELA, and the DOHSA.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. McCreadie, in this\ncase, why is it necessary to get into that, whether they\nare punitive damages under FELA and the Jones Act? If\nwe accept, as I think we must, Townsend's allegations to\nbe true, he has said that Atlantic, as a matter of\nroutine, puts in a boilerplate complaint for declaratory\nrelief, reciting all the reasons why somebody could not\nget maintenance and cure, even though that is patently\nfalse, the allegation for example that he deserted his\npost. He says it's false. He said the allegation that\nhe falsified his application for employment is false.\nAccepting the -- that to be true at this\nstage, isn't there some kind of punitive measure to be\ntaken against a litigant who abuses the court process in\nthat way?\nMR. McCREADIE: First, Justice Ginsburg,\nthose are just allegations. There's no evidence --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but -- but now we're\nat the pretrial stage, and we're supposed to assume the\ntruth of the allegations in Townsend's complaint. We're\nassuming -- they may well turn out to be false; but at\nthe threshold under 12(b)6 we accept those allegations\nas true and then determine whether a claim is stated.\nMR. McCREADIE: Well, if -- if those\nallegations are true, there's no distinction between the\nwillful wanton misconduct that traditionally has been\nthe subject of the dispute about maintenance and cure\nand punitive damages as opposed to those allegations.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But let's take this out\nof the maintenance and cure spot altogether. Litigation\ngenerally, if a court determines that a litigant is\nabusing the court's process by filing false pleadings,\nis there a remedy; and if so, what is it?\nMR. McCREADIE: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, there\nis a remedy. And that's what Vaughan v. Atkinson\nprovides. In that case this Court looked at abuse of\nthe litigation process and determined that the plaintiff\nin that case was entitled to attorneys' fees.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that all that\nwas at stake there was whether the employer wrongfully\nwithheld maintenance and cure that was owing. The\nallegations made by Townsend go far beyond that they\njust unreasonably denied him maintenance and cure. They\nsuggest that this litigant, as a matter practice,\nstandard operating procedure, makes false claims before\na court. And my question to you is, isn't across the\nboard there a sanction, wholly apart from the particular\nclaim, for a litigant who abuses the court's processes?\nMR. McCREADIE: I think there's a -- there's\na number of potential sanctions. I mean, there is Rule\n11. There's the natural discretion of the court.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is any of them called\npunitive damages? Do you know of any case in which a\ncourt has --\nMR. McCREADIE: No, I do not.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And punitive damages, of\ncourse, requires that you first find the guilty person\nto lose the case. So what if a person makes these\nterrible allegations, but ends up winning the case\nanyway, and -- and -- well, you couldn't impose punitive\ndamages.\nMR. McCREADIE: I agree with --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We've got to call it\nsomething else, don't we?\nMR. McCREADIE: I agree with your position\nthere. And what I was trying to answer the question is\nif someone does abuse the litigation process, that is\nwhat Vaughan v. Atkinson addressed. And it -- it\nawarded attorneys' fees, which -- which are unusual. It\nis an exception to the American rule. And it is a\ndeterrent for anyone to try to play fast and loose\nwith --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How many --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But do you read Vaughan v.\nAtkinson as necessarily implying punitive damages would\nbe inappropriate? I can't quite find the negative that\nyou want me to find, I think, in Atkinson. True, they\ndidn't talk about punitive damages. They said damages\nare appropriate, and attorneys' fees in this case, which\nis what the district court gave, we are going to affirm\nit. But there's nothing there that said punitive\ndamages are inappropriate.\nMR. McCREADIE: No. The dissent mentioned\nthat. But you can not speak for the majority opinion.\nBut up until Vaughan v. Atkinson, in the history of the\nUnited States there was never a holding where punitive\ndamages were awarded to a Jones Act seaman for the\nfailure to pay maintenance and cure.\nIt was only after Vaughan v. Atkinson, after\nthe dissent mentioned that concept, that the issue ever\narose in the history of Supreme Court precedent, circuit\nprecedent, in this country.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Whose dissent was that? I\nhave forgotten that. Whose dissent was it? Do you\nrecall? Stewart?\nMR. McCREADIE: I do -- I do not believe --\nit is coming Justice Harlan, but I just -- I just cannot\nsay off the top of my head who wrote the dissent.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You said never in the\nhistory. I mean, there -- there are examples like the\nancient Nancy case, where the damages, where they were\ncalled exemplary -- but when you say never has there\nbeen before or after punitive awards. But there is\nprecedent, the Nancy case in this Court, cases in lower\ncourts, there have been punitive damages awards in -- in\nmaintenance and cure cases.\nMR. McCREADIE: Justice Ginsburg, I made the\ndistinction between there's no case in the history of\nthe United States before Vaughan v. Atkinson awarding\npunitive damages to a seaman, a Jones Act seaman, for\nthe failure to pay maintenance and cure.\nThe case that you refer to, the Amiable\nNancy, and other cases, they apply to general maritime\nlaw with respect to collisions, now with respect to\npollution, and that's a broader context. But if we look\nat the history of general maritime law, if we look at,\nfor example, Calhoun, there's the critical distinction\nbetween non-seafarers and seafarers. If we look at\nLatsis, there's the critical distinction between seaman\nand longshoremen. In those status, they define the\nclass of persons that we're looking at to see whether\nthey can recover punitive damages.\nAnd this case involves a Jones Act seaman.\nAnd because it involves a Jones Act seaman, that's the\nclass of claimant that we're looking at. And when we\nhave a Jones Act seaman the primary statute that we look\nat is the Jones Act. Of course, the Jones Act\nincorporates FELA by reference. And the DOHSA, as Miles\npoints out, also has an impact on the -- on the case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Did this Court ever hold\nthat under FELA or under the Jones Act there are no\npunitive damages? Do we have any holding to that\neffect?\nMR. McCREADIE: No, there is no specific\nholding, and I would point out that if there was, that\nwould answer our question today and we wouldn't be here.\nBut that we do have is Miles, which is very\nclear and specific about what damages are available to a\nseaman; and those damages are compensatory damages.\nMiles is clear that the seaman can be compensated for\npecuniary loss, the seaman can be compensated for his\npre-death pain and suffering. Because punitive damages\nare not compensatory damages, because punitive damages\ndo not compensate for pecuniary loss, and because\npunitive damages do not compensate for pre-death pain\nand suffering, they are not available to a Jones Act\nseaman.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But that -- but that was a\ncommon law wrongful death action, correct, Miles?\nMR. McCREADIE: Miles was --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It was not admiralty\nmaintenance and cure.\nMR. McCREADIE: Justice Kennedy, Miles was a\nwrongful death action. But when we look at Miles and we\nquestion, well, that is a wrongful death action, it is\nvery clear, should Miles apply in a personal injury\naction, then we need to -- we -- first we know -- we\nlook at the cases that have addressed that point.\nAnd first off, Miles does not say that the\nuniformity principle applies only to wrongful death\nactions.\nSecondly, Cortes, Supreme Court precedent,\ntells us that the rules are the same for personal injury\nand death actions for maintenance and cure under the\nJones Act.\nIn Cortes, the opposite argument was made:\nThat the maintenance and cure claim could proceed for\npersonal injury but not for a death action. Here, the\nRespondent is making the argument --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me, that the\nmaintenance and cure claim could proceed or that the\npunitive damages claim could be made?\nMR. McCREADIE: You're absolutely correct.\nHere they are making the argument that the punitive\ndamages claim could -- can proceed under the personal\ninjury side of the case but not the death side. And\nCortes has already addressed that issue.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. McCreadie, there's a\nquestion about this case, a troublesome feature of it.\nThat is, you are saying because there are no\npunitive damages available under FELA and under the\nJones Act, then there certainly should not be any under\nmaintenance and cure. But if we have to answer those\nquestions, whether there are punitive damages available\nunder FELA and the Jones Act, in the context of a\nmaintenance and cure claim, then we're deciding a much\nlarger question than are punitive damages available for\nwillful refusal to pay maintenance and cure. We're\ndeciding a question under the Jones Act, a question\nunder the FELA, and there are a lot of people who would\nbe interested -- and the seamen are a sizable group that\nthe law cares about particularly. But there would be a\nlarger interest, a larger interest in the answer in the\nJones Act context and FELA. And to decide those\nquestions in a case that doesn't present any claim under\nFELA or any claim under the Jones Act is troublesome.\nMR. McCREADIE: I certainly agree with you,\nJustice Ginsburg, that the answer to this case answers\nthe question of what damages are available under the\nJones Act and -- and FELA.\nBut, again, if you look at Miles, which\nanalyzing both FELA cases, Vreeland for example, and\nKraft, which is a railroad case, it -- it has already\nspecifically stated what compensatory -- that\ncompensatory damages alone are available under the death\nside, admittedly, and that the compensation for a seaman\nand, therefore, for a FELA employee is limited to\ncompensation for pecuniary loss and for pre-death pain\nand suffering.\nAlso, if we look at another string of\nSupreme Court precedent, it's not as clear as Miles, but\nif we look at the other string, it -- this Court has\nstated over and over that compensatory damages are what\nis available under the Jones Act; compensatory damages\nare available under the FELA; and compensatory damages\nare available under DOHSA. For example, Zicherman is a\npost-Miles case, and it's written and states the\nprinciples very clearly: The Jones Act provides,\npermits, I should say, compensation only for pecuniary\nlosses. And then it discusses Vreeland, which is a FELA\ncase, and it says that the FELA permits compensation\nonly for pecuniary losses.\nAnd so, again, if we look at the history on\nthe death side, which Miles summarizes, but if we look\non the personal injury side, at the Osceola, the\nIroquois -- Peterson mentions compensatory damages nine\ntimes in expressing what remedies are available to\nseamen. And so those railroad cases, those Jones Act\ncases, have been decided and have been a part of our\nprecedent for 60, 70, 80 years.\nAnd, of course, it is important to note that\nthe Congress has amended the Jones Act in 1982, with no\ntampering with this history. It has amended the Jones\nAct in 2006 with no tampering with the history, and it\nhas amended the Jones Act in 2008 without any change.\nAnd that's in light of Guevara, decided in 1995; that's\nin light of Roy Al, decided in 1995, and 10 years plus\nfor the cases to percolate and for Congress to decide\nwhether they agree with those policy determinations.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: As I read your reply\nbrief -- and please correct me if it's a\nmisimpression -- you didn't dispute the fact that\npunitive damages were available historically for the\nshipowner's wrongful refusal to provide maintenance and\ncure, or am I wrong about that?\nMR. McCREADIE: I -- that must have been the\nRespondent's brief, because our position is -- hopefully\nwas clearer than that, that punitive damages have never\nbeen awarded in the history of the United States for the\nwillful failure to pay maintenance and cure until\nafter -- until after Vaughan v. Atkinson.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And what about English\nadmiralty, under the English precedents?\nMR. McCREADIE: The English precedents we\ndid not analyze. We took Miles when it analyzes Lord\nCampbell's Act, and then that was analyzed in Vreeland,\nand from that point forward, Miles took that, that line\nof cases --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course, in Miles --\nagain, we're coming back -- was wrongful death, not\nmaintenance and cure.\nMR. McCREADIE: Miles was a wrongful death\ncase that analyzed an unseaworthiness cause of action,\nwhich is brought under general maritime law. We are\nlooking at maintenance and cure, which is a claim\nbrought under general maritime law. Both existed before\nthe Jones Act, unseaworthiness and maintenance and cure,\nand again both are general maritime law claims.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course, your\nfriend on the other side distinguishes that argument by\nnoting that death is different. As he puts it, we're\nall going to die, so --\nMR. McCREADIE: In that case --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- you have\ndifferent considerations under the maintenance and cure.\nMR. McCREADIE: Mr. Chief Justice, that take\nus back again to Cortes, which this Court has already\ndecided and analyzed. Should we distinguish between a\ndeath action, maintenance and cure action under the\nJones Act, from a personal injury action? And the\nunequivocal answer from this Court is no, that you\nshould not treat them differently. There's no logic for\ntreating them differently. We also need to remember\nthat one of the anomalies that was -- that was cured by\nMoragne -- the first anomaly cured by Moragne was an\nanomaly where the unseaworthiness action would exist in\nState territorial waters but not in -- I'm sorry, it\nwould exist in State territorial waters, but not on the\nhigh seas. And that troubled the Moragne Court, that\nyou would have a discrepancy between personal injury and\ndeath, and that's one of issues that they tried to --\ntried to reconcile.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought there was -- it\nwas on the high seas. They had DOHSA. At the time of\nMoragne, there was DOHSA, but then it was when you\nweren't on the high seas that was the gap. Wasn't that\nthe case?\nMR. McCREADIE: That's correct. My point is\nthere was a difference of what right you had under -- in\nterritorial waters under unseaworthiness that Moragne\ndescribed as one of the anomalies. And the anomaly was\nthat if the person was injured, they could get an\nunseaworthiness claim; if they died, they could not.\nAnd Moragne was clear that distinguishing between death\nand personal injury, it made no sense.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's what the\ncommon law was. That's why we had Lord Campbell's Act.\nThat was if you die, too bad; if you're injured, you\ncollect.\nThat was fixed by statute on the high seas,\nDOHSA. Because there was the gap, there was no Lord\nCampbell's Act, the Court effectively made one up,\nright? That's what it did in Moragne.\nMR. McCREADIE: Moragne did create some law,\nyes. Let me try to answer the question in a different\nway --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I just -- and you can\ngo ahead and answer that question without my\ninterrupting. But my assumption from reading the amicus\nbriefs in this case is that punitive damages were\nawarded in some maintenance and cure cases (a) as simply\npart of the overall award -- they weren't separated out,\nbut it was part of the measure -- and (b) that some\nAmerican courts, American judges, including noted\nadmiralty judges, awarded in some cases punitive damages\nin maintenance and cure before the modern cases Moragne\nand so forth -- and Miles -- that you're talking about.\nIs that incorrect?\nMR. McCREADIE: That is incorrect. If you\nread the cases cited, and they have their roots in some\nlaw review articles that are critical of Miles, that\ndon't like the Miles decision, but if you read those\ncases --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm talking pre-Miles.\nI'm talking pre-Miles.\nMR. McCREADIE: And I'm saying the cases\nthat are cited in those law review articles -- the\npurpose of the articles is to criticize Miles. Those\ncases do not stand for the proposition that they're\npresented for in the law review article and they do not\nstand for the propositions that they have been presented\nto this Court. They are not holding -- they are not\ngiving an award of punitive damages for maintenance and\ncure in any of those cases.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is -- how many -- how many\nwould you say there are in a typical year, maintenance\nand cure cases? About, roughly? I mean, say in the\nlate twentieth century, 18 -- 1980, 1990. Have you have\nany guess at all?\nMR. McCREADIE: Justice Breyer, because\nmaintenance and cure is so often linked to the Jones Act\nand the unseaworthy cause of action, and because of the\nleverage that seems to be brought with punitive damages,\nthey are virtually included in every seaman's case --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right.\nMR. McCREADIE: -- from the get-go.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So how many would you\nguess?\nMR. McCREADIE: And -- and I would have to\nestimate, just extrapolating from my own experience,\nthousands of Jones Act cases are filed in the country\nevery year.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Uh-huh. And they usually\nhave maintenance and cure aspects.\nMR. McCREADIE: Necessarily they do.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can you get punitives under\nthe Jones Act or not?\nMR. McCREADIE: You cannot recover punitive\ndamages under the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What about unseaworthiness?\nMR. McCREADIE: You cannot recover punitive\ndamages under unseaworthiness because that's the same\nrule that Miles already decided. Miles decided in\nunseaworthiness --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay, so if I have about 30\ncases -- no, I had, actually, to be honest, I thought we\nfound about 12 in the period around 1980 - 2000 where\nthey do give some punitive damages.\nMR. McCREADIE: And -- and -- and I hope I\nwas clear that the can of worms was opened by Vaughn.\nNo one awarded it. No one thought about it, until after\nVaughn.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Then I found\nabout 10 cases in the period before the Jones Act where\nthere was something given -- punitive damages being\ngiven for something, and there was something sort of\nlike maintenance and cure in there.\nMR. McCREADIE: There -- there are some\npre-Jones Act cases, like the Amiable Nancy, that --\nthat talk about punitive damages; and there are some\ncases where some seamen have not been treated very well.\nBut a specific look at the cases reveals that there is\nno pre-Jones Act case awarding punitive damages --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Over here, there is one\ncalled -- Unica v U.S. The master should have put the\n-- into the hospital. Given him $1,500. It was partly\npunitive. Considering -- De Troupe -- I mean, I found\nsome that are sort of -- sort of -- I don't know what to\nsay. I don't know who to make of it.\nMR. McCREADIE: The Troupe is on the list.\nIt is a case that we have looked at, and it is -- and\nagain, it is a case that I can say that if you look at\nall of them -- it is a very tedious process; there are a\nlot of cases, and wading through each one, none of them\nhold or award punitive damages for the failure to pay\nmaintenance and cure. And --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The Troop gave them $4,000.\nConsidering all the circumstances of the aggravation.\nGross neglect, mistreatment. \"It is useless to parade\nmore of the sickening details.\"\nMR. McCREADIE: And our position is that\neven if there is -- and there is not; let me be clear --\nbut even if there was one rogue case, one individual\ncase, that does not create general maritime law.\nSomething more is needed. For example, a decision from\nthis Court would create general maritime law.\nThe Wilburn Boat case is an insurance case.\nThere's an example where there are some cases on the\nsubject of marine insurance, but there's not enough for\nthe court to conclude that there is a general maritime\nlaw on that subject.\nAnd so returning again to this -- this\npocket of cases, they do not stand for the\nproposition -- even if they did, if you'll notice, two\nof them, it's the same district court judge who is\nmaking the noise that he would have done this or he\nmight have done this. And -- and our position is that\none district court judge does not create general\nmaritime law by mentioning the possibility of punitive\ndamages in one case.\nWe're much more comfortable relying on this\nCourt's precedents, the line of cases that builds from\nMoragne to Higgingbotham and culminates in Miles, we're\nmuch more comfortable looking at the history of the\ndamages awarded by this Court to seamen, where it uses\nthe term compensatory damages -- compensation for --\nover and over and over without any mention whatsoever of\npunitive damages.\nThe punitive damages problem did not crop up\nuntil Vaughn, even though now everyone seems to agree\nVaughn did not hold that punitive damages were\navailable.\nI would also just like to mention all the\ncircuit court cases addressing this issue hold that\nJones Act precludes punitive damages, and any circuit\ncourt that has addressed this issue since Miles likewise\nspecifically holds punitive damages are not available\nfor the willful failure to pay maintenance and cure.\nI'd like to reserve my remaining time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Sullivan.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF G.J. ROD SULLIVAN, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. SULLIVAN: Mr. Chief Justice, may it\nplease the Court:\nI would like to start by answering the\nquestion that was raised by Justice Ginsburg. This\nCourt does not need to reach the question of whether or\nnot punitive damages are available under the Jones Act\nor under the FELA in order to decide this issue, because\nmaintenance and cure is different. It precedes the\nJones Act by centuries, perhaps even a thousand years,\nand it deals with a distinctly different problem.\nMaintenance and cure deals with a situation\nas what do we do with an injured seaman to get him back\nto health and get him into the workforce? And the law\nhas provided since Catherine of Aragon went to Greece in\nthe 1200s that the ship owner has a responsibility, in\nits capacity as a ship owner, to provide that seaman\nwith medical care and to provide that seaman with a\nliving allowance so that he can get better and get back\ninto the work force.\nNow in 1920, Senator Jones intended to make\nthe United States merchant marine the world's greatest\nmerchant marine. He was dealing in a factual scenario\nwhere 12 years earlier, on April 12 of 1912, the Titanic\nhad sunk; 1,900 people had died.\nVirtually every member of the Senate and\nCongress knew somebody who was on the Titanic, and\nduring the intervening eight years, certain points of\nlaw became obvious. First of all, the people who died\non the Titanic could not recover for anything other\nexcept their lost baggage. They could not recover for\nthe fact that their loved ones had passed away because\nthere was no cause of action.\nSecondly, because the Titanic hit an iceberg\nand was not unseaworthy, there was no cause of action\nfor negligence. So Senator Jones set around to correct\nthese two anomalies in the law, and said what we are\ngoing to do is we're going to create a new class of\nbeneficiaries, who are dependents of people who die at\nsea, and we are going to give them the right to recover\npecuniary damages. That's the only place where\npecuniary damages are mentioned in the law. And then it\nsaid, and as to seamen, we're going to give them an\nadditional right, a cumulative right on top of\nunseaworthiness, and that's going to be negligence.\nIt never sought out to touch maintenance and\ncure. Maintenance and cure has been something that's\nbeen monitored by the courts ever since its inception,\nand it is a self-regulating system. Before Guevara,\nship owners regularly provided their employees with\nmedical care without asking the question. If there was\na close call, they provided the medical care without\nrunning to the court. They provided maintenance.\nThen came Guevara, and Guevara decided for\nthe first there were no punitive damages, and now you\nhave a growing problem in this country. You have a\nproblem with ship owners providing less and less medical\ncare without resort to the courts.\nNow our position here is that a seaman\nshould be not ever have to come before a court to seek\nmaintenance and cure, and the court should never, ever\nhave to award punitive damages.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, surely there will be\nsome incidents in which the employer in good faith\nthinks there's no illness, that there's no basis for\nmaintenance and cure. MR. SULLIVAN: And as --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: For you to tell me oh,\nthis will just never happen, I mean, that's not the way\nthe world works.\nMR. SULLIVAN: No. And Judge, when a --\nwhen an employer comes to the court in good faith and\nsays there's no entitlement to maintenance and cure, and\nthere -- the court finds that -- or the factfinder finds\nin good faith, there's no basis for punitive damages.\nThen you merely have a dispute. But the situation --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, of course there are\ngoing to be disputes, and the question is whether or\nnot, just from the standpoint of filling professional\nresponsibility, in almost any maintenance and cure\naction where the counsel for the plaintiff thinks\nthat -- for the seaman thinks that the employer has been\nremiss, he doesn't add the punitive damages complaint if\nwe agree with your position, which changes completely\nthe settlement and the bargaining aspect. But you can\naddress -- you can address that.\nMR. SULLIVAN: Well -- and I agree, Your\nHonor, that is a prospect and a possibility, something\nwhich I personally abhor doing. I mean, you should only\nplead punitive damages when you have a good faith basis\nfor doing it; you believe you will survive a directed\nverdict. It should not be thrown in to every single\ncomplaint, and I'm not denying that some counsel will do\nthat.\nBut what I'm saying is that today, in 2009,\nin 2006, there are actually ship owners who are, as a\nregular practice, denying their seamen medical care. I\ndon't know why that is. Perhaps it's because it is\nexpensive now, more expensive than it has ever been.\nPerhaps it is because there are safety nets that will\nallow the seamen to seek Medicaid, and so the taxpayer\nwill pay for it. Whatever the motivations are, it is a\ngrowing trend that we are seeing.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How many of these seamen\nwho seek maintenance and cure are represented? I mean,\nwhat is the incidence of representation for maintenance\nand cure claims as distinguished from Jones Act\nnegligence type claims with the -- the possibility of\nlarge recoveries for pain and suffering?\nMR. SULLIVAN: Judge, I'd be picking a\nnumber out of the air, but I can give you anecdotal\nevidence of this. In the Fifth Circuit attorneys who\nregularly do maritime personal injury work tell each\nother -- we talk about the fact that you can't afford to\nrepresent somebody who's got a maintenance and cure case\nthat's not combined with a Jones Act case. And there\nare a number of practical reasons for that.\nYou have to pay all of the experts, and it\nis very expensive to bring these cases. You have to\nhire the orthopedic surgeons, the -- the radiologists.\nYou have to pay for the tests, and then, as an attorney,\nthese are never recoverable as costs.\nAnd then you are working on a contingent\nhourly fee. If you win your case and you prove that\nthey were willful, wanton, and callous in -- in denying\nmaintenance and cure, then you might get a portion of\nyour attorneys' fees back.\nNow, you may do that as a pro bono matter on\noccasion. But you cannot rely upon the fact that\nattorneys will take these cases.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why -- why does\njoining it to a Jones Act case help?\nMR. SULLIVAN: Well, because when you join\nit to a Jones Act case, you have the substantial\npossibility of getting either a settlement or a verdict\nat the end of the case which is going to compensate the\nattorneys for taking on the maintenance and cure case as\na portion of it.\nAnd so, consequently, if somebody has a\nserious accident, it falls under the Jones Act and there\nis a maintenance and cure count, the attorney will\nhandle all of those together and feel adequately\ncompensated.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the -- the point\nyou are making is that the recovery under the Jones Act\ncan be very large, and the attorney on a contingent\nbasis would get a piece of that.\nMR. SULLIVAN: Exactly, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Because it would be\nswelled by the pain and suffering damages which are not\navailable in maintenance and cure.\nMR. SULLIVAN: That's correct, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is the\npre-Vaughan case that awarded punitive damages --\nawarded punitive damages in a maintenance and cure case?\nMR. SULLIVAN: Judge, first of all, I would\ncite to you two cases: The Rolf case, which is a 1924\nNinth Circuit case --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I am -- what --\nwhich --any case from this Court?\nMR. SULLIVAN: No. No. This issue did not\ncome before this Court.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It hasn't come before\nthis Court under FELA or the Jones Act, either, the\npunitive damage question?\nMR. SULLIVAN: It hasn't -- it has not, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Rolf was not a -- Rolf was\nmaintenance and cure and personal injury and\nunseaworthiness. So we don't know which aspect of the\ncase led to the punitives.\nMR. SULLIVAN: We don't, but we know that\nthere was outrage on behalf of the court. And,\nunfortunately, in -- and I think, as Justice Souter\npointed out --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is it the case that we\ncan't find a single pre-Jones Act case where punitives\nwere awarded and what was sought was maintenance and\ncure? I -- I found some, but they seem ambiguous to me.\nMR. SULLIVAN: Well, Judge, I would say that\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is your best?\nMR. SULLIVAN: Yes. I would say that the\nbest are the Rolf and the Margharita, which were denials\nof medical care where the damages were enhanced because\nof outrageous conduct. But to say that, Judge, is there\na case that says this is maintenance and cure, we are\ngoing to award punitive damages, that's not been done.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So we have a history all\nthe way back to Catherine of Aragon, and what we've been\nable to find in these pre-Jones Act cases is really two\nor three, or maybe I found ten actually, that I couldn't\nsay -- leaning over in your direction, I could take\nmaybe three or four. And they show a little ambiguity.\nBut give them all ten, and that's still ten out of\nhundreds of years of history.\nMR. SULLIVAN: Well, let me -- let me\nrespond to that in a couple of ways. First of all,\npunitive damages were part of the common law until taken\naway by Congress.\nAnd -- and it could be asserted that\nmaintenance and cure punitive damages were not necessary\nbecause the threat was enough to -- to require\nshipowners to go ahead and provide this. And I would\npoint out to the Court that this had not been a problem\nprior to Guevara. Shipowners did self-regulate. They\ndidn't -- seamen didn't run to the courts every time\nthey wanted maintenance and cure; whereas, today they\nhave to.\nThe leading scholar in this whole area is\nProfessor Robertson at the University of Texas who wrote\nthe AHA brief. And his brief on pages 7 through 11\ncatalogs the cases where he suggests punitive damages or\nexemplary damages were awarded for outrageous conduct\ninvolving failure to provide medical care.\nAnd I would suggest that those show that\npunitive damages were unexceptional before Vaughan.\nThey were part of the common law. They -- they were\nbefore this Court in the Amiable Nancy even though it\ndidn't involve medical care. There is no reason to\nassume that punitive damages are accepted in maritime\nlaw; as part of the common law, that they weren't also\naccepted for the willful, wanton, and egregious failure\nto provide a seaman with medical care.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If I thought that the lack\nof counsel in maintenance and cure cases was a pivotal\npoint or a relevant point for our decision, other than\nthe representations of counsel, where would I look to\nverify that?\nMR. SULLIVAN: The existence of prior\nmaintenance and cure cases?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The -- the -- that there\nis a problem in seamen finding attorneys who will take\nmaintenance and cure cases.\nMR. SULLIVAN: Yes, Judge. There is not\nempirical evidence out there. Nobody has done studies.\nI'm not aware of any. But do we really want to wait for\nthe situation where we have hundreds and hundreds of\nseamen who are -- are, you know, living homeless or\nliving in their cars or unable to obtain medical care\nbefore this Court decides that if somebody does this, it\nis something that can be punished?\nAnd -- and I think that's the situation\nwe're at today. It is a growing problem. And it is a\ngrowing problem because Rivera is a relatively new case,\nand it has spread to the other circuits.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if -- if the\n-- if the existence of the punitive damages and\nmaintenance and cure were as well established, why\nwasn't that mentioned in terms in the Vaughan majority?\nIt only comes up in the Vaughan dissent.\nMR. SULLIVAN: Well, it does come up in the\nVaughan dissent because it was not requested by the --\nin the -- in the lower courts. And this Court would not\nconsider a claim for punitive damages for the first time\non appeal.\nI -- I think what Justice Stewart was saying\nis we have a question before us where somebody is\nrequesting attorneys' fees in -- in derogation of the\nAmerican Rule. The majority is saying we are going to\nfind an exception to the American Rule and give\nattorneys' fees. And justice Stewart is saying, I don't\nwant to do that. I think that the better --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think Stewart knew\nmore about these -- these obscure, ancient cases than we\ndo?\nMR. SULLIVAN: I'm sorry? Was he more --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think he knew more\nabout these obscure, ancient cases than we do?\nMR. SULLIVAN: No, I -- I think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Had he had the benefit of\nbriefs by Professor Robertson and -- I think not, right?\nMR. SULLIVAN: No. No. I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It was just sort of off the\ntop of his head that he thought there should be punitive\ndamages.\nMR. SULLIVAN: He was quoting from McCormick\non damages amend some basic treatises. And I think he\nwas taking the position that punitive damages are in our\nquiver of weapons that we can use to deter --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They -- they normally are,\nbut the question is whether there -- whether this --\nthis is a different quiver.\nMR. SULLIVAN: Well, I think that he was\nsaying that this is one of the weapons we have. Instead\nof creating an exception to the American Rule, let's\ngive them punitive damages to account for this egregious\nconduct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And that -- that was not\nargued by anybody. It wasn't raised in the lower court.\nIt wasn't a punitive damages case.\nMR. SULLIVAN: No, it wasn't. It wasn't.\nThe first time counsel for Mr. Vaughan raised the\nquestion of punitive damages was on remand. And then\nthe district court said, hey, look, you didn't raise it\nbefore. Just because Justice Stewart suggested this as\n-- as an alternative to attorneys' fees doesn't mean\nwe're going to award punitive damages now.\nJUSTICE BREYER: With attorneys' fees there\nis a compensatory aspect. The -- the basic obligation\nis to keep this seaman alive and well, and then you give\nhim some wages if necessary, and you give him medical\ncare. And -- and now he's going to be out that\nattorneys' fees as a result of his sickness. So I\nunderstand that.\nPunitives does not compensate him for\nanything. It is a policy matter for the State. He's a\nbeneficiary of a windfall. And it seems a more radical\nstep to make something up out of whole cloth here with\npunitives than it does with attorneys' fees.\nMR. SULLIVAN: Judge, I would like you to\nlook at how Congress treats this problem. If you had,\nfor example, a bridge-building project where a seaman, a\nlongshoreman and a State worker all got injured\nidentically in the same accident side by side, and the\nshipowner failed to provide medical care for the\nlongshoreman, the shipowner could go to jail. If the\nshipowner provided -- or failed to provide medical care\nto the State worker, he could be, again, subject to\ncriminal penalties.\nOn top of the criminal penalties, Congress\nhas established these administrative agencies to assure\nthat those workers get medical care. On top of that, if\nthey don't get medical care, they lose their defense of\nworkers' compensation immunity. They lose the defense\nof assumption of risk, contributory negligence, and they\nare subject to personal liability, not just corporate\nliability.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Maybe it would be a good\nthing.\nMR. SULLIVAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The -- the problem here is\nit has pros and cons. I was quite moved by the brief --\nthe citation that Professor Robertson made of all of\nthose old cases until we looked them up. And -- and\nthen I found they seem to stand for a little bit less\nthan I had the impression they stood for.\nMR. SULLIVAN: That --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So we'd be making this up\nout of whole cloth, it seems to me.\nMR. SULLIVAN: I don't think so, Your Honor.\nWhat I think he would be saying is this is part of our\npower as a common law court. And just because.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We've abandoned that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- because Miles says don't\ndo that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly. We've abandoned\nthat in this hearing. We said what we do with these\nadmiralty causes of action we should be guided by what\nCongress has done in the Death on the High Seas Act and\nthe Jones Act.\nDo you acknowledge that there are no\npunitive damages available in the event of death?\nMR. SULLIVAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that -- you want to\ntalk about what's a sensible system and what is not a\nsensible system. In the days when Massachusetts used to\nhave a -- when I was in law school, they had a\ncompensation limit for wrongful death, but to limit for\npain and suffering, for negligence; and the line was\nback her up again -- back her up again, Sam, she's not\nquite dead yet.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SULLIVAN: Judge, I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is -- is -- is this going\nto be the same thing, where -- where the ship owner\nsays, well, you know, if -- if -- if I treat him badly\nenough that he dies, I don't get hit with the punitive\ndamages?\nMR. SULLIVAN: I would hope that would not\nbe the case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah, but it is invited,\nisn't it?\nMR. SULLIVAN: Well, I don't think it is\ninvited, Judge. There are reasons why that there is\nthis anomaly that there are no punitive damages for\ndeath. And that's because in 1920 when Congress created\nthe Death on the high Seas Act there were no -- any kind\nof damages. There was no recovery at all.\nAnd so, Congress preempted this field of\ndeath. And it said that death cases shall be decided\nunder the Death on the High Seas Act. But Congress has\ncompletely stayed away from the area of maintenance and\ncure. It hasn't enacted administrative remedies because\nthe Court has always been the one who has decided what's\nappropriate.\nAnd this Court, as a matter of its -- as\nmaintaining its court docket and maintaining these\nremedies, has the right and I think the obligation to\nsay we're going to keep these cases out of court by\nawarding punitive damages when somebody willfully denies\nthis right, when somebody willfully withholds medical\ncare.\nAnd I think if you do that, you're going to\nsee these cases are going to disappear. Seamen are\ngoing to start getting their medical care again. They\nare not going to be coming to the court every time they\nget injured and saying, I haven't gotten my back\nsurgery. I haven't gotten my rotator cuff surgery. It\nis sort of a matter of court administration to --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm not sure as\nsure -- I'm not sure I follow that. In other areas\nwhere we allow punitive damages it hasn't resulted in\nthe cases going away. Quite the opposite. It seems\nthat it has given rise to a variety of claims on both\nsides.\nMR. SULLIVAN: This is a very narrow area of\nlaw, Your Honor. We are talking about are you giving\nthe seaman the medical care he needs to get the maximum\nmedical improvement? And that's all it is.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah, but the normal\nmedical malpractice area has given rise to a lot of\npunitive damage litigation. I don't know why this would\nanybody different.\nMR. SULLIVAN: I think this would be\ndifferent because all we're talking about is does the\nseaman get the surgery he needs. If he doesn't get the\nsurgery he needs and he gets worse or continues to stay\nill or he continues to stay in pain, then the ship owner\nshould be punished. But --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It certainly makes these\nmaintenance and care cases a lot more attractive to the\nplaintiffs' bar doesn't it? I mean, one of your\ncomplaints is there's just no money in it. The claim is\nnot for that much.\nMR. SULLIVAN: The goal here, Judge, is not\nmoney. The goal here, I think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course it shouldn't be\nthe goal. But we're inquiring into the question of\nwhether granting punitive damages will increase or\ndecrease the number of lawsuits.\nI -- I -- I would think it would be\nastounding if it would decrease the number of lawsuits.\nMR. SULLIVAN: I think it would decrease the\nincidence when medical care is denied.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There -- there wouldn't\nbe any maintenance and cure claim if the system worked\nas it was intended; that is, that if you have a sailor\nwho is injured, the ship owner pays room and board and\nmedical expenses.\nMR. SULLIVAN: That's all it is, Your Honor.\nJust say if the ship owner will treat the seaman fairly,\nwill follow the doctor's recommendations, get him to a\ndoctor, give him treatment so he gets better, there's --\nI mean, you are saying there may be more claims for\npunitive damages, but there will be more awards of\npunitive damages because there won't be this willful and\nwanton, callous disregard of the seaman's rights.\nAnd so, I would suggest that, in fact, in\nthis narrow area of the law, if you impose punitive\ndamages, actual punitive conduct, conduct that deserves\npunishment will go down and it will go down rapidly.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I wish it were as clearcut\nas that. I mean, what if the seaman says, you know, I\nshould have had this very expensive treatment? And the\nship owner's medical counsel said, no, this treatment is\nnot necessary.\nIs that -- is that a punitive damages claim?\nI bet it is.\nMR. SULLIVAN: I don't think so, Judge. I\nthink those kind of cases should be weeded out on\nsummary judgment by the courts -- by the district court,\nbecause we're only talking about the willful, wanton and\ncallous withholding.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He's going to say that was\nwillful and wanton. I obviously needed this more\nexpensive treatment. He just didn't want to pay the\nmoney.\nMR. SULLIVAN: And the court is going to\nhave to -- the district courts are going to have to make\na judgment as to the bona fides of that case. But I\nthink that you are going to find that it is very rare\nwhen somebody is going to act callously when the\npotential on the other side is that they are going to be\nawarded -- have punitive damages awarded against them.\nAnd that, therefore, this is going to be a\ncorrective mechanism that's going to do away with the\nproblem we currently have now and make the plaintiffs\neven better.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I mean, it --\nwhether it gives rise to more litigation or not, it is\nstill a significant and will give rise to greater costs\non the part of the shipper which will be passed on, as\nis the case in a lot of areas where you have punitive\ndamages, it will be passed on to the consumer.\nMR. SULLIVAN: If the punitive damages are\nawarded. But the hope, of course, is that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no, even if\nthey're not. In other words, you were saying, look, to\navoid punitive damages, the ship owner is going to make\nsure that there -- that that more expensive test is\nprovided.\nMR. SULLIVAN: It's going to err on behalf\nof the seaman. Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That doesn't mean\nthere are no costs involved in ruling in your favor.\nMR. SULLIVAN: That's true, Judge. But here\nagain, we're balancing the interest of somebody who is\ninjured and whose condition may become permanent and\nincurable by virtue of not getting prompt care as\nopposed to the limited costs to the ship owner of\nproviding a doctor who is going to determine what the\nbest care is. And that's all we asking for, the best\ncare that medical care can currently provide to get the\nseaman to maximum cure.\nIf there are no further questions --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. SULLIVAN: Thank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. McCreadie, you\nhave three minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID W. McCREADIE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. McCREADIE: Justice Ginsburg, I wanted\nto respond first to a question that you asked that I\nthink there may have been some confusion with respect to\nthe answer.\nThere is pain and suffering available in a\nmaintenance and cure claim if the failure to pay the\nmaintenance and cure causes injury, causes hurt. That's\nwhat we understand from reading the Osceola and Iroquois\nas interpreted by Cortes.\nSo, I didn't want you to be left with the\nimpression that even if a maintenance and cure claim was\nbrought by itself, if there's some injury, some damage\nbeyond the failure to receive the maintenance and cure,\nthere is a cause of action that could lead to, I think\nas you put it, the higher award and, hence, attorneys\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is that a separate cause\nof action? Or is it just part of the maintenance and\ncure act?\nMR. McCREADIE: It's -- it's maintenance and\ncure and it can be brought either under the maintenance\nand cure with an injury or it can be brought under the\nJones Act. You can choose your cause of action. You\njust don't recover twice.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you -- are you then\ndisputing what your colleague said about lawyers being\nreluctant to take maintenance and cure claims that are\nnot tied with a Jones Act claim?\nMR. McCREADIE: Justice Ginsburg, we're\nrelying on Supreme Court precedent as opposed to\nanecdotal information. But to answer your question\nspecifically, that's why I'm explaining that they do\nhave the right to bring a personal injury component to a\nmaintenance and cure claim.\nAnd the other point I wanted to make in the\nNinth and Fifth Circuits those are the circuits of\nGuevara and Roy Al, where punitive damages have been\nclearly eliminated from a maintenance and cure claim for\nwillful failure to pay. Since 1995 there's no dearth of\ncases. Those remain two of the most active circuits in\nthe country for seamen's cases. And whether they are\nfiling as just maintenance and cure or combining with\nthe Jones Act, the ratio would probably be the same as\nany other circuit.\nThere was also a question about the Vaughan\nand -- and what the dissent knew or didn't know; and\nreference to McCormick on damages. I think, again, it\nis a small point but it is interesting to point out that\nMcCormick on damages, the same volume that the dissent\nreferred to, specifically states that punitive damages\nare not available under FELA -- under the FELA. And, of\ncourse, the Jones Act incorporates FELA by reference.\nReally the Vaughan dissent did not have the\nbenefit of Miles when it reached its decision. If that\ncourt had had the benefit, we believe they would have\nfound punitive damages are not available.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
