MITCHELL: Justice Stevens, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Court has directed us to address, in\naddition to the question raised in the petition for writ\nof certiorari, the following question. Was petitioner's\nFederal constitutional claim properly raised before the\nMississippi Supreme Court for purposes of 28 United States\nCode, section 1257?\nAccordingly, we begin by addressing that\nquestion and answering it affirmatively. Here, Howell\nmaintains, one, the standards for adjudicating State and\nFederal claims of this particular type are identical --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Where --\nMR. MITCHELL: -- where they're labeled as\nsuch --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- where was that -- where\nwas that maintained? Because I thought that below, all\nthere were was this was a -- was it a lesser-included offense\nunder State law, and I didn't see below any reference to\nthe Federal Constitution.\nMR. MITCHELL: Justice Ginsburg, we believe that\nthe rule in Beck establishes that State law must be viewed\nand State law is the determiner of whether an offense is a\nlesser-included offense, but Federal law, the Federal\nConstitution determines whether, as a matter of due\nprocess under the Fourteenth Amendment and Eighth\nAmendment concerns, whether an instruction must be given\nas a Federal constitutional matter.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And -- and the standards under\nBeck are different from the standards under the roughly\ncomparable State rule, as I understand it, because under\nthe State rule, the lesser offense need not be an included\noffense, in the technical sense; and number two, there\nneed not be, in the absence of a further instruction, a --\na limitation to the jury to two choices, death or\nacquittal, so that unless one is very careful to raise the\nFederal standard, simply raising the State standard\nwouldn't do it.\nMR. MITCHELL: Respectfully, Justice Souter, we\nwould submit that Mississippi's own law says that it\nembraces the Beck standard and that Mississippi's own\nlaw --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Sure, it embraces it because\nit's broader, which means that if you raise -- if you --\nif you make a claim under the State standard, you are not\nnecessarily making a claim under the narrower, more\nrestrictive Federal standard.\nMR. MITCHELL: We would respectfully submit that\n-- that in Mississippi, for example, as contrasted with\nthe statutory scheme that was present in Hopkins, the\nNebraska scheme, in the Mississippi scheme, Mississippi\nhas held that simple murder is a lesser-included offense,\nand therefore, by definition that offense at least mirrors\nwhat is required under Beck.\nNow, the question of whether some other\nlesser --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What about -- what about the --\nthe Beck condition that in the absence of the instruction,\nthere must be a choice between -- the jury must be\nconfined to a choice between death and acquittal?\nMR. MITCHELL: In --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's -- that's not the same\nin the State's scheme, is it?\nMR. MITCHELL: Well, we believe that -- that it\nis the same. And in fact, the -- the case that the State\ncites, State v. Goodin, explains that. The representation\nof Goodin in the State's brief, as it appears in the\nrespondent's brief at page 23, we contend is not\nfaithfully representative of what the Court said in that\ncase.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is -- is Goodin the case that\n-- that stands for the proposition that under -- under\nState law, the -- the jury has an -- an option to sentence\nfor life, as -- as well as -- as to impose the death\nsentence?\nMR. MITCHELL: Goodin is the case that the State\ncited for that purpose, but an analysis of what the\nMississippi Supreme Court actually said at page 656 of the\nSouthern Reporter, 787, is this. The Goodin jury did not\nface the dilemma of the Beck jury. Here, the jury's\nalternatives in the guilt phase were to convict Goodin of\ncapital murder, simple murder, or to acquit him, which is\nthe very purpose that the later cases -- and Beck itself\nexplains. Schad, for example, explains that the reason\nfor the Beck determination was that presenting only the\noption of convicting of a capital offense or acquitting\nwas not constitutionally permissible.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So -- so I just want to make\nsure I know where we stand. You're saying that the\nassumption I was making, that under Mississippi law, in\nthe absence of an instruction for a lesser offense, the\njury has an option not only to acquit or to impose the\ndeath penalty, but an option of life with or without\nparole, that assumption is simply incorrect as a -- as a\nfact about Mississippi law.\nMR. MITCHELL: No, I do not believe that is\nincorrect. I'm sorry, Your Honor. What I do believe is\ncorrect is that under Mississippi law, the jury, because\nof the bifurcated nature of the -- of the case, is given\nat least the preliminary reference or preliminary\ninstruction that if there is a guilt verdict, then there\nwill be a sentencing phase. But we submit that that is a\ndistinction that this Court has not adopted, nor have\nother courts adopted because in this situation --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But it takes you out of Beck,\nat least arguably, doesn't it? The -- the question is,\nhave you raised something that is necessarily on all fours\nwith Beck? And given this sentencing scheme, we can't say\nthat simply raising a State claim necessarily raises the\nBeck claim. Isn't that true?\nMR. MITCHELL: Your Honor, we would respectfully\ndisagree with that position because of the analysis that\nthe Court has undertaken, for example, in Hopkins and\nbecause of the analysis in Spaziano v. Florida. In those\ncases, they were presented with schemes in which the jury\ndid not, of necessity, impose the death penalty. However,\nthe jury was confronted with exactly the same position --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But the consequence of the jury\nverdict was -- was the death penalty.\nMR. MITCHELL: Well, the consequence of the jury\nverdict may have been the death penalty. For example, in\nSpaziano, the -- the jury returned a verdict of guilty.\nThe jury recommended life, but the judge imposed a\nsentence of death nevertheless. In the Hopkins case, the\n-- a three-judge panel then imposed the death penalty.\nThose -- those differences in sentencing schemes we do not\nbelieve separates the rationale of Beck which is the\ndanger of affecting the jury verdict by being faced with\nthe dilemma of either convicting of a capital offense or\nacquitting.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Mitchell, my -- my problem\nis even more fundamental than Justice Souter's. Conceding\nthat the rule in Mississippi is exactly the same as the\nFederal rule in Beck, it doesn't seem to me that arguing\nMississippi law, just because it happens to be the same as\nFederal law, amounts to raising a Federal question.\nLet's assume you have a -- a State law against\nwire-tapping. It is unlawful. And you -- you come in and\nyou ask that the evidence be -- be excluded because it's\ncontrary to the State law. Have you raised a -- a Federal\n-- a Federal question when all you cite is the State law,\neven though the effect under State law is the same as the\nFederal effect under the Fourth Amendment? It's not my\nunderstanding that you've raised a Federal question.\nMR. MITCHELL: I do not believe that I would\nhave unless in that particular State, if its highest court\nhad said, we embrace the same standard and we apply the\nsame --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's all it takes for the New\nYork State Supreme Court, for example, to have said, well,\nyou know, our -- our wire-tap statute does the same thing\nas the Fourth Amendment does anyway? That's all it takes?\nMR. MITCHELL: I believe --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Thereafter, all you have to\ndo is cite the New York State statute, and you've raised a\nFederal question.\nMR. MITCHELL: No, respectfully, Your Honor.\nHowever, if the State supreme court has adopted not only\nthe same purpose, but the very language and has, in\neffect, said, our ruling in these cases is controlled by\nthe same provision of law, whether a -- a decision of this\nCourt, as in the Beck standard that we believe Mississippi\nhas adopted, or if the court has articulated that the\nUnited States Constitution controls this particular\nprovision.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I mean, if -- but the\nState standard always has to -- has to comply with the\nFederal requirement, doesn't it?\nMR. MITCHELL: It always has to comply with the\n-- with the Federal requirement, but as Justice Souter\npointed out, it may be broader, for example, in situations\nwhere there might be a right to a -- a jury instruction on\na lesser-related offense. For --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So all it takes is a -- is a\nsingle decision by the State supreme court which says that\nour rule is no broader than the Federal constitutional\nrequirement, and thereafter all you have to do is appeal\nto State law.\nMR. MITCHELL: Well, while we believe that is\nminimally sufficient, we believe that thereafter it is\nimportant certainly to raise a claim which puts the court\non notice of a --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course --\nMR. MITCHELL: -- claim.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- it does. Why -- why is that\n-- I mean, it seems to me counsel should stand up on his\ntwo feet and say, we're raising a Federal question. Why\nis that too much of an imposition when the statute\nrequires that you raise a Federal question? Why do we\nhave to go researching what the State supreme court said\nseveral years ago?\nMR. MITCHELL: Where -- where it is generally\nunderstood, as in this case, that the two claims are\ninterwoven, we believe the jurisdiction of this Court, as\nthe Court has said, is plain.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So we have to figure out in\nevery case whether the two claims are interwoven. Do you\nthink -- do you think counsel for the defense isn't always\ngoing to say that they're interwoven?\nMR. MITCHELL: I think counsel for the defense\nwould, indeed, contend that they were interwoven.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think it's too much to\nask counsel for the defense to say, we are raising a\nFederal question. And it solves the problem.\nMR. MITCHELL: The -- the difficulty in saying\nthat we -- that we raise a Federal question is that\nsuppose, in this instance, the trial counsel and appellate\ncounsel, Mr. Lott, had said, the jury in this case is\npresented with an untenable position, convicting of a\ncapital offense or acquitting. That's untenable and that\nraises a Federal question. Would the State then concede\nthat that was a sufficient assertion of a Federal\nconstitutional claim? Probably not, and that is because\nthe State contends, just as the amicus brief contends,\nthat this Court should adopt some inflexible rule that is\nextremely and extraordinarily difficult to apply in the\ncontext of, for example, a trial in Mississippi or North\nCarolina where counsel understands the lifeblood of the\nrule, the lifeblood even of the Constitution, but cannot\nat the moment recall the correct citation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, my goodness, all it\nrequires -- look, the problem is not a technical problem.\nIt's a human problem. A judge is a human being. He gets\nthe petition. There are 28 different issues. That's a\nlot of work. He goes down one, two, three, four. He gets\nto this issue, which is somewhere hidden among the 28, and\nwhat it says is, there should have been a lesser-included\noffense instruction and it cites three Mississippi cases,\nwhich in turn cite one other case, and that -- that other\ncase says that the Mississippi rule has constitutional\nimplications and cites Beck. Well, I mean, if that's\nsupposed to be sufficient, I as a judge would have to, in\nevery one of these cases that's cited in these 28\ndifferent issues, start looking up the other cases in\nMississippi to see if there's some other place they cite\nsome other case that says something about a Federal case.\nI mean, you see it's impossible.\nMR. MITCHELL: And -- and we would concede that\nbut for the fact that in this particular instance, this\nparticular rule is so clearly identifiable.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But it isn't even because,\nafter all, Beck talked about an instruction where the\nchoice was either convict the person of murder, death\npenalty, or acquit him, and your case happens to involve\nan instruction which said to the jury, convict him or give\nhim a life sentence or acquit him. So we don't even know\nif -- if Beck applies to your case. That's never been\ndecided.\nMR. MITCHELL: Well, Your Honor, we would\nrespectfully submit suppose that the -- that Howell's\ncounsel here had called this a Schad issue, for example,\nwhere a sentencing scheme somewhat similar to the\npresent --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't even know -- I am so\nignorant I don't even know if Schad is a Federal case or a\nState case.\nMR. MITCHELL: And -- and --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So I guess if he had, he should\nhave said Fed or U.S. or whatever it is so that I'll know.\nMR. MITCHELL: Or -- or suppose --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That doesn't seem like such a\nburden.\nMR. MITCHELL: Or -- or --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I -- I wrote it.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. MITCHELL: But Justice Souter --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Justice Souter was -- was a\nState court judge as well.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. MITCHELL: Suppose, though, that this were\nnot -- were not a -- a lesser-included instruction case.\nSuppose that what had happened in this case was that\nHowell had stood before the judge and said, I'm asking for\nyou to appoint counsel, and the judge said, well, under\nthe law of this State, I don't have to do that. But then\nHowell had responded, but the Supreme Court says that you\ndo. Would that then be sufficient to raise --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Supreme Court? Yes, that's\nprobably pretty clear it's Federal.\nMR. MITCHELL: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Maybe he meant the State\nsupreme court.\nMR. MITCHELL: Maybe he meant the State supreme\ncourt.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. I'm saying you\ndon't carry it to extremes. Don't be ridiculous about it,\nbut that isn't an extreme case we have. We have which is\nthe case we have, the State, and then three State cases,\nand then referring to one State case that says that Beck\nis -- is a constitutional implication citing Beck. I\nmean, I don't have to be extreme in order to say yours\nisn't that extreme example.\nMR. MITCHELL: No, but we would say -- we would\nsay this, Your Honor, that the effort to federalize the\nclaim as was done in the Mississippi Supreme Court was\ndone in an effort to address the instructions as a whole,\nand --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, it isn't even clear\nhere that Beck would have been violated. As I understand\nit, in -- in Mississippi the jury could have given a\nsentence less than death despite the conviction. Isn't\nthat right?\nMR. MITCHELL: We would concede that. Once the\nsentencing phase was reached.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes. So I'm not sure if Beck\neven applies on its own terms.\nMR. MITCHELL: It would be our contention, Your\nHonor, that -- that Spaziano v. Florida, that Schad, and\nthe cases following Beck, Hopkins v. Nebraska even would,\nof necessity -- or Hopkins v. Reeves -- I'm sorry -- the\nNebraska scheme -- would, of necessity, report to the\ncourt the continuing vitality of Beck even under these\ncircumstances, but it -- it is a matter that we believe\nwas at least made fairly and reasonably presented to the\ncourt.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Mitchell, what gives me\npause is that there are Mississippi cases -- you no doubt\nknow them -- where the court has seemed to think that the\nFederal issue under Beck was discrete from the State\nissue. So I forgot the name of them, but one of them was\nstriking because it says this doesn't run afoul of Beck,\nand then it says, now we turn to Mississippi law on\nlesser-included offense. And it -- the -- the State\nsupreme court treated those two as discrete. So when you\njust say lesser-included offense, why should the Court\nassume that you're talking about one rather than the other\nwhen the Mississippi Supreme Court itself has made it\nclear that it thinks they are discrete inquiries?\nMR. MITCHELL: Justice Ginsburg, we would\nrespectfully submit that -- that the State's recitation of\nGoodin is not a faithful representation of what happened\nin Goodin. In Goodin, he was -- the defendant was given\nthe lesser-included simple murder instruction, which\nHowell seeks. It was a robbery case. The report of the\ncase appears at 787 So.2d, beginning, I believe it's, 639.\nAt pages 655 and 656, the court addresses the Beck issue,\nand it says there that because the jury's alternative in\nthe guilt phase was either to convict of capital murder or\nsimple murder or to acquit, then and in that circumstance,\nthe Beck -- that Beck was not violated. It then says we\nmust look to our practice to determine whether a\nmanslaughter instruction should be given.\nAnd it is for that reason that we respectfully\nsubmit that Goodin does not attempt to distinguish Beck,\nbut in fact squarely addresses a Beck claim, although --\nand we candidly admit -- Goodin's counsel did cite Beck\nitself to the Mississippi court. Nevertheless, the claim\nwas phrased in precisely the same manner in which Mr.\nHowell's counsel expressed the same claim.\nThese claims, therefore, we would respectfully\ncontend, are not virtually identical but are in fact\nidentical. But even if there were some minor variations,\nsome deviations, as this Court indicated would appear from\ntime to time, we contend that clearly that such identity,\nsuch virtual identity is sufficient to raise the issue.\nIn this case, Howell's trial and appellate\ncounsel raised two issues with regard to the jury\ninstructions. Those two issues themselves were\ninterrelated. Those two issues were a whole. Those\nissues related to whether or not there was sufficient\nevidence to convict of robbery and whether or not -- or\nattempted robbery rather, and whether or not there was a\nbasis to give a lesser-included instruction. The cases\nwhich he cites are State cases related to the necessity of\ngiving lesser-included instructions where there's an\nattempted robbery and simple murder is, therefore,\nincluded in that offense.\nHe also, at the outset of his contentions with\nregard to jury instructions, says that under the Eighth\nand Fourteenth Amendments, these jury instructions -- and\nwe contend that they must be considered as a whole. These\njury instructions violate his rights under the Eighth and\nFourteenth Amendments. It is our position that this is\nsufficient -- while not a cognate of that, is sufficient\nto at least be a corresponding claim, a substantially\nidentical claim to Beck, and one which entitles the\ndefendant as a matter of due process and as a matter of\nEighth Amendment consideration and concern, to an\ninstruction.\nThe difficulty that we face in a circumstance\nsuch as this where the instruction is not given is that\nthe jury's function, while not always reviewable, but\nwhich is always entitled to protection, may be called into\nquestion and the quality of the verdict impeached, in\neffect, by the failure to have the third option. In\nessence, it is our contention that where a defendant uses\nthe very words that this Court has used to describe the\nconstitutional claim, where it uses the very words that\nthe State supreme court has used --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you this question,\nMr. Mitchell? Supposing the -- there are alternative\nlesser-included offenses that might be urged by the\ndefendant as to -- to get an instruction on, and he asks\nfor the wrong one. In other words, the question -- there\nis a question here about exactly what is the lesser-\nincluded offense. It seems to me that if he tried to kill\n-- if he killed the driver of the vehicle, there may well\nhave been some kind of crime. But maybe you ask for a\nlesser-included offense of, say, simple murder and the\nfacts don't fit simple murder, but they might fit\nmanslaughter or something else. Would your request for --\nfor a simple murder, lesser-included offense instruction\nbe sufficient if you should really have asked for a\ndifferent lesser-included offense instruction?\nMR. MITCHELL: We would respectfully submit that\n-- that even the Mississippi court has addressed that\nsituation in -- in a case cited in -- in the briefs in\nMease. And there, the defendant asked five times for\ninstructions, lesser-included offense instructions, and\nnever actually got them right. The court said that that\nis not a basis upon which to deny the instruction and\nthen, citing Beck, said that where there is a proper\nlesser-included offense, the fact that the -- that the\ndefendant does not request the proper instruction still\nrises to the constitutional proportions that a Beck claim\ndoes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is -- is that the case here\ntoo? One of the things that's neither here nor there I\nguess, but one of the things that perplexed me was that I\nwould have thought that the lesser-included offense on --\non the theory that the -- that he didn't intend to kill,\nhe was sprayed with mace, got mad, pulled out a gun, and\nshot and so on -- I would have thought the lesser-included\noffense was a heat of passion kind of killing. But as --\nas I read the -- the statement of -- of simple murder,\nwhich requires a deliberate act, that didn't sound like\nit. And I -- I read negligent homicide, and that didn't\nsound like heat of passion. But is -- is it your point\nhere, if -- if we get into it, that as long as you asked\nfor some lesser-includeds, under Mississippi law that\nraises the issue adequately?\nMR. MITCHELL: We -- we believe that it does\nraise it adequately. We believe that it --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But then what would be a\nlesser-included offense? Because if it's not simple\nmurder and it's not manslaughter, you haven't suggested a\nthird that it might be. I thought your whole position was\nthat this simple murder was right and the --\nMR. MITCHELL: We do contend that it was right,\nYour Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- and the judge was obliged\nto give it. So why -- in view of what Justice Souter just\nsaid about simple murder requiring a deliberate design,\nwhere was the deliberate design here?\nMR. MITCHELL: We believe that -- that there\nare, in effect, two forms of simple murder because of the\nstructure of -- and in fact, the Mississippi Supreme Court\nhas said this -- because of the structure of the\nMississippi murder definitions. They are contained in a\nnumber of separate sections, but the most important of\nwhich is that a killing, not done in certain enumerated\nfelonies, such as robbery or attempt to rob, would\nconstitute simple murder. We believe that the simple\nmurder instruction would have been correct. But even if\nit were not, we would respectfully submit that that is\nsufficient to raise the question.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But what would be if it were\nnot? What would be the lesser-included offense?\nMR. MITCHELL: Arguably it would be\nmanslaughter. For example, the Mease case, which the\nState cites and to which I made reference, was a case in\nwhich capital murder was not robbery murder as in this\ncase, but the killing of a police officer. In Mease,\nthere was an altercation between the sheriff and Mease.\nDuring that altercation, Mease was struck on the head by\nanother deputy. His contention was that the gun fired,\nwhich he was holding next to the sheriff's neck. The gun\nfired by reaction for two reasons, one that he was in a\nfight and, secondly, that he was struck. The Mease court\nsaid that that was a proper basis to instruct on\nmanslaughter, the fact that he had pulled the gun and was\nusing it during the course of the fight.\nNow, while I find that case difficult to parse,\nwe believe that that certainly could have been an argument\nthat could have been raised and that, albeit it was not,\nit could have been a proper instruction to have been\ngiven.\nIf there are no further questions, I'd like to\nreserve the remainder of my time.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You may.\nGeneral Hood.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES M. HOOD, III\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. HOOD: Justice Stevens, may it please the\nCourt:\nI'd like to make the point, as far as\njurisdiction goes, that -- that the defendant has failed\nto make a Federal claim and he is required under Webb v.\nWebb. If the Mississippi Supreme Court -- if the lower\ncourt does not address the issue, then it is assumed that\nit was not properly raised.\nAs to the issue of Beck, there is no Beck\nviolation. Actually Mississippi finally -- we've gotten\nin one instance, we've -- we've become first in -- in this\nregard. In Jackson v. State in 1976, our Supreme Court --\nwhich was cited in a footnote 10, I believe, in -- in\nBeck. In the Jackson case, Mississippi said -- we had the\nsame statute, pretty much, that Alabama had that\nrestricted a lesser-included offense instruction.\nMississippi said, number one, you cannot restrict that\nlesser-included offense instruction if it is supported by\nthe facts, and number two, in the Jackson case, the court\nheld that it had to be bifurcation, which was the\nproblem, the impact on the guilt phase. And -- and so I\nwould submit to the Court that there is no impact in\nMississippi in this case on the guilt phase, nothing to\ninfluence the jurors' decision, and that was the inherent\nproblem that the Court recognized in Beck.\nNumber two, Mississippi allows a life sentence,\nwhich also distinguishes Beck. It -- it allows the jury,\nin a separate, bifurcated hearing, to determine whether or\nnot the defendant should receive life or the death\npenalty.\nAnd then thirdly, in Mississippi, we have a\nbroader standard than the Federal standard. If it's any\nlesser offense in Mississippi, then the defendant is\nentitled to it if it's supported by the facts of the case.\nSo we have a broader standard that gives the defendant an\neasier opportunity to meet that standard.\nAnd thirdly --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't get your point. It\ndoesn't have to be a -- a lesser-included offense --\nMR. HOOD: Yes, yes, sir --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- so long as it's a lesser\noffense?\nMR. HOOD: -- Justice Scalia. It just has to be\na lesser offense.\nAnd I would submit to the Court that if we are\nanalyzing a Federal constitutional issue, then perhaps we\n-- we should follow Federal constitutional standards,\nwhich was stated -- the strict elements test, in other\nwords, because under -- under Federal law, it has to be,\nwell, number one, a lesser-included offense, a true\nlesser-included offense, and under the Schmoke case, this\nCourt has stated that that is in fact applying the strict\nelements --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I interrupt with a\nquestion there, General Cox?\nMR. HOOD: Yes, sir.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: In this case, if the man\napproached the victim in the car and shot him and killed\nhim, as I understand it, and the theory was an attempted\nrobbery and therefore the -- the capital offense. Now,\nare you telling me that if they failed to prove there was\nan attempted robbery, it was not an offense at all?\nMR. HOOD: No, sir. I -- I'm not stating that.\nIt would -- it would be an offense, but based upon these\nfacts.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Then why wasn't he entitled to\nan instruction on whatever offense it was?\nMR. HOOD: Because the -- the facts in this case\nshow that there was no other reason for him to approach\nthat vehicle than to rob that individual. There was no\npremeditated intent.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But his theory was if there\nwas a failure of proof on the attempted robbery, that all\nwas left was a -- a killing for some other reason. And if\nthere was a killing -- if there was a failure of proof on\nattempted robbery, would he not then have been entitled to\na -- a lesser offense instruction?\nMR. HOOD: Yes, sir, Justice Stevens.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So what your theory is then --\nMR. HOOD: It depends on --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- if I understand it\ncorrectly, is the proof that there was an attempted\nrobbery is so convincing that no other theory was\navailable.\nMR. HOOD: Well, that's the facts that we had in\nthis case. And your analysis there again will -- will\nhinge on whether or not -- in Mississippi admittedly\nmurder would be a lesser-included offense if the facts\nsupport it and also manslaughter. But now, if you apply\nthe Federal standard --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I still don't understand\nyour answer to Justice Stevens' question. I had the -- I\nhad the same problem. The evidence of robbery here was\ncircumstantial, strong, but still circumstantial based on\nhis earlier statements that he was going to make a sting,\nI think he said, and then the witness saw him outside the\nwindow and -- and he stopped the car. And I take it, he\ndidn't take the stand and say, I stopped the car to ask\nfor directions or something. But still it's -- it's --\nthat's certainly a jury issue as to whether there was a\nrobbery.\nMR. HOOD: Yes, sir, it is. It's -- the -- the\nfacts were in this case, though, all night long they had\nridden around looking for someone to rob. They made a\nstatement in Tupelo --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but would the State of\nMississippi take the position that if there was no\nrobbery, there was no crime in this case --\nMR. HOOD: No, sir.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- when a man is shot and\nkilled?\nMR. HOOD: On the facts that we had, if -- if\nyou analyze it under the Federal standard -- and I would\nsubmit to the Court that we should apply --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No. I'm talking about just\nMississippi law. You're the prosecutor saying, we -- we\nmay not get robbery here. The -- is that the only thing\nthey charge is robbery or let the man go after he shoots\nand kills the person he doesn't even know?\nMR. HOOD: We don't know -- he didn't know this\ndefendant.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no, but the question is\nsuppose we have a different case, not this case.\nEverything is the same but for the fact we know for sure\nit wasn't a robbery. That's all. Now, in that different\ncase, is it a crime under the law of Mississippi what\nhappened?\nMR. HOOD: Well, first --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I've told you everything about\nthe case. It's just like this one except we know it isn't\na robbery. Now, is it a crime? The answer we think is\nabsolutely it's a crime. And my next question is which\ncrime.\nMR. HOOD: Which crime.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay?\nMR. HOOD: Yes, sir. You're correct. First, we\nwouldn't have -- have charged --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So which crime is it?\nMR. HOOD: Based upon the facts that we had --\nand he didn't know this individual. He had no\npremeditated intent to kill him.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Right.\nMR. HOOD: It would not be murder.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. So it would be something.\nWhat would it be?\nMR. HOOD: It could arguably be a felony murder,\nwhich is a separate statute in Mississippi.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So then maybe\nthere's a felony --\nMR. HOOD: He meant to commit another --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is anything else possible?\nMR. HOOD: -- another crime.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Manslaughter?\nMR. HOOD: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, it's odd that in\nMississippi people just go around shooting each other all\nthe time and there's no statute that seems to cover it.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And if you don't know someone,\nthen it's not murder?\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't understand.\nMR. HOOD: Oh, yes, sir. That -- that happens\nall the time.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So there must be --\nMR. HOOD: But, of course, it's premeditation.\nIf there were evidence, say, for example --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no, no. They just do it --\nwho knows why. All we know about them is they went and\nkilled somebody. Now, I think it's still a crime to kill\npeople in, I thought, all 50 States, but -- but --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: So I'm going to say which --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Let's make it -- if we make\nit concrete, let's take all that we have in this case is\nthe testimony that Rice gave. Rice was the one who\nobserved this murder, and he didn't have any statements\nabout the defendant needing money to pay off his debt.\nYou have only that snapshot scene of what the witness saw\nfrom the window, which doesn't establish any robbery at\nall because Rice said he didn't observe any robbery going\non. All he observed was the killing. Now, if that's all\nyou have in this case, a person was killed, an eyewitness\nto the shooting, the eyewitness testifies exactly as Mr.\nRice did in this case, what crime would you indict for?\nMR. HOOD: Justice Ginsburg, to -- to -- first\nof all, we wouldn't have indicted for capital murder if we\ndidn't have that evidence. We wouldn't be discussing the\nBeck issue. It wouldn't be a lesser-included offense\nquestion. We'd strictly be focusing on those facts,\nnumber one, that particular witness Rice was on the other\nside of the vehicle. You had separate testimony from\nLipsey, the co-defendant who was in the vehicle and could\n-- behind where -- where --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but I'm giving you a\nhypothetical where --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: General Scott, I suggest you\ntry to answer her question.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. All you have --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The question is that's -- one\nwitness is all you had. Would there be a crime against\nthe law of Mississippi and if so, what would it be?\nMR. HOOD: It would be manslaughter, I suppose,\nYour Honor. That's not the facts in this case and -- and\nI apologize --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So what -- but -- but\nthe line of reasoning is -- is -- now, there is a crime.\nLet's call it X. All right? And what you're -- what\ncounsel says is it's the law of Mississippi that if there\nis a crime and it's X and it's lesser, you've got to\ncharge it if somebody just says, please give me a lesser-\nincluded instruction, even if he's all mixed up as to what\nthe right crime is.\nI don't know if that's the law of Mississippi.\nFrom reading the Mississippi Supreme Court opinion, I\nwould say it wasn't the law of Mississippi because they\nsay you're not supposed to charge people in ways that\nwould mix them up. But, I mean, anyway -- but that's the\nargument. So what's the response?\nMR. HOOD: There --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And don't take the one I just\nsuggested because I'm not sure that's right. What is your\nresponse?\nMR. HOOD: There are 12 separate manslaughter\nsections in the Mississippi code, not in one section. Our\nmurder section lists -- lists four just in one section.\nThere are 12 different ones. We have one if you drive a\nnail in a tree and -- and you're -- you're cutting lumber\nand it kills someone, that's a manslaughter still.\nThis defendant only requested a culpable\nnegligence manslaughter instruction. There was no evidence\nto -- to support that. The only potentially -- I -- I could\neven make a stretch -- would be a heat of passion. He did\nnot request that -- request instruction, and --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, is that fatal to him? I\nmean, that's what we're -- one of the things we're trying\nto get at I guess. Is -- is that fatal to him?\nMR. HOOD: His failure to request --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Under Mississippi law, would he\nbe entitled to a lesser offense instruction if he asked\nfor the wrong lesser offense? I.e., in this case, if he\nfailed to ask for heat of passion, would he still be\nentitled to a correct lesser instruction, even when he\ndidn't ask for it?\nMR. HOOD: Perhaps the judge should correct\nwithin a particular statute, but not go look at all 12\nstatutes that he's under -- which -- which would classify\nas murder.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So you say he's not entitled\nthen.\nMR. HOOD: Yes, sir.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The -- the only thing he would\nbe entitled to, if he were correct, is the lesser\ninstruction that he asked for, and if he's not correct,\nthere's no error.\nMR. HOOD: Yes, sir. He would have had to -- to\nhave specifically requested heat of passion. But there\nagain, I don't believe that he put on evidence to support\neven --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No. We're just trying to get\nat what Mississippi law is, and I think you've --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And under your view of the\nfacts, as I understand it, he would have been entitled to\na manslaughter instruction.\nMR. HOOD: I don't -- that's only a stretch to\nanswer -- answer Justice Breyer's question.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, surely -- surely, if one\nwalks up to a car and shoots the driver dead, that's must\nbe a crime.\nMR. HOOD: Yes, sir. It -- it would have to be\nclassified as --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And the question is we don't\nknow exactly which of your several statutory provisions it\nviolated, but if it violated one of them, I don't\nunderstand. And if he's correct -- maybe he misrepresents\nthe law. He tells us, as a matter of State law, if he\nasked for the wrong lesser-included instruction, but there\nis a correct one, the judge has a duty to give the correct\ninstruction. That's what -- what the counsel has told us.\nAnd if that's right, I don't understand why he wasn't\nentitled to some lesser-included offense instruction.\nMR. HOOD: I -- I believe what he was addressing\nwas language within a particular statute, meaning a\nlesser-included offense of -- of murder or how you styled\nit, whether it be depraved heart murder or -- or felony\nmurder, first degree murder.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So it's -- it's your view he\nmust ask for the correct lesser-included offense\ninstruction.\nMR. HOOD: Yes, sir. And -- and there again,\nI'd like for the Court to -- to understand my statement\nthat we should construe this on what -- how the Federal\nlaw -- how you -- how the Federal courts construe it, not\nuse Mississippi's lesser standard, but let's -- let's\nconstrue it on whether or not, first, it is a true lesser-\nincluded offense because that's -- that's what the Federal\nstandard is, and that's what we followed in Nebraska.\nAnd secondly, if it's a true lesser-included\noffense, we have to use the analysis of the Federal courts\nwhich says that it has to use the strict elements test.\nWell, murder would not be a lesser-included offense under\nFederal law because under the Mississippi capital murder\nstatute can be with or without deliberate design.\nTherefore, there is no deliberate design. It would not be\na lesser-included offense of murder. Manslaughter would\nnot be a lesser-included offense under that same elements\ntest because it requires the additional element of sudden\nprovocation or heat of passion. So I would submit to the\nCourt, if we apply what's fair under Federal law, what the\nfloor is under Federal law, we should use the Federal\nanalysis and not Mississippi --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But is sudden provocation or\nheat of passion part of the prosecution's burden or a part\nof his -- one of the -- is it a matter of defense?\nMR. HOOD: It would be a matter of the defense\nraising sudden provocation. And I don't believe that they\n-- they certainly didn't put on anything about culpable\nnegligence. For example, maybe he was spinning the gun in\nhis hand for culpable negligence. They didn't put on\nanything about deliberate design because he didn't want to\ntestify. His defense was alibi and so he didn't take the\nstand and say, I intended to kill this person, therefore,\ngive me the murder instruction. He's got to put on\nevidence to support it, and I don't believe he put on\nsufficient evidence for either of those.\nAnd -- and I was the district attorney who tried\nthis case, so factually I -- I remember the -- the -- my\nargument was that we couldn't have proved murder if we had\nwanted to because there was no premeditation.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: May I go back to the heat of\npassion point? You say he did not put on evidence, but\nwasn't there evidence in the record through a State's\nwitness that at least would have supported a heat of\npassion argument, the evidence being that he went up to\nthe car, no gun was apparent, something happened.\nEvidence shows that he was sprayed with mace, and at that\npoint, he pulls out a gun and shoots. That, I suppose, is\nevidence of heat of passion. Couldn't he have asked for a\nheat of passion instruction even though he did not put on\nthe heat of passion evidence himself?\nMR. HOOD: He could have asked for a heat of\npassion instruction, but --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but he did not do so.\nMR. HOOD: -- but he did not do so. Yes, sir.\nThat -- those facts --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wait. You're -- you're -- I\ndon't -- you're calling the heat of passion an element of\n-- of the crime of manslaughter? It's not an element of\nthe crime.\nMR. HOOD: It's sudden provocation, yes, sir.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose you walk up and -- and\nyou blow somebody away. You can't -- there's no heat of\npassion. There's no sudden provocation. You just walk up\nand blow them away. And you're telling me that that's not\na crime because you can't -- you can't prove heat of\npassion? You can't prove one of the other elements of\nmanslaughter? That can't be right.\nMR. HOOD: No, sir. The --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why isn't it enough that you\nkilled somebody?\nMR. HOOD: If -- if --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You killed somebody. You\ndidn't plan to kill to somebody, so it's not murder.\nOkay. But you killed somebody. Surely, there must be\nsome crime in -- in Mississippi that -- that covers that.\nMR. HOOD: Yes, sir. You --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What is it?\nMR. HOOD: -- charge murder and -- and the\nprosecution --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No. It's not murder. It\nwasn't -- you know, he didn't -- I didn't walk up to the\n-- to the car intending to kill him. As you say, you\ncouldn't have indicted for murder.\nMR. HOOD: Likely, the State would -- would have\n-- have -- if those were the facts and that's all the\nfacts that we had, then the State would likely have\ncharged murder and asked for a lesser-included offense\ninstruction for manslaughter.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Manslaughter being defined as\nkilling without deliberation?\nMR. HOOD: Yes, sir.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. That's what he is saying --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There -- there is a -- you say\nthere -- there are what? Nine different manslaughter, did\nyou say?\nMR. HOOD: Twelve different manslaughter --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Twelve different, and one of\nthem is simply killing somebody simpliciter, without any\nprovocation. Right?\nMR. HOOD: Yes, sir, without. But he requested\nthe culpable negligent manslaughter instruction, and there\nwas no evidence of culpable negligent manslaughter. It's\na separate section in our code now. There are 12\ndifferent sections. It's not like we have one statute\nthat lists all of those. And -- and some of them are --\nare arcane. And I think it's unfair to ask a trial court\njudge to correct every request for an instruction and --\nand -- he -- at trial, if you read --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, let -- let me ask -- ask\nyou this. Knowing what we know now, we have the record,\nwe have the benefit of hindsight, we know the evidence, in\nyour view now what would have been the closest lesser-\nincluded offense for which an instruction might have been\nsought?\nMR. HOOD: There are two possibilities that were\nnot requested. One is our felony -- felony murder.\nFelony murder is -- is the killing of -- that occurs\nwithout occurring with one of the seven offenses that we\nhave listed, murder, rape, and so forth, committing\nanother crime. Or heat of passion manslaughter. And I\nwould submit to the Court that -- that they never\nrequested anything about the felony murder and they never\nrequested the heat of passion manslaughter.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question just\nto help me sort of -- what are the -- as a matter of State\nlaw, what are the elements of the offense for which he was\nconvicted?\nMR. HOOD: Elements of the offense are that he\n-- that he -- a killing occurred with or without intent\nand that it was in the commission of -- of a crime,\nrobbery.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Those are the two elements.\nAnd so that if you take out with -- in the commission of\nanother crime and just left the -- the other part of it,\nwould that also be an offense?\nMR. HOOD: With or without under Mississippi\nlaw --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: In other words, you say -- you\nsay the offenses are killing somebody with or without the\nintent to do so --\nMR. HOOD: Yes, sir.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- and in the course of an\nattempted felony. Say you failed to prove the attempted\nfelony and you proved the remainder of the -- the other\nelements. Is he guilty of anything in -- under\nMississippi --\nMR. HOOD: It -- if you -- if you prove the\nintent --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And if he is, why isn't it a\nlesser-included offense is my next question.\nMR. HOOD: Yes, sir. If you just take those\naway and you just have those two elements, with or\nwithout, if it's with intent, then it would be classified\nas murder. If it's without, it could possibly be --\nwithout intent, then it could be classified as\nmanslaughter.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me that then there\nare two lesser-included offenses, and either one would\nhave -- he should have gotten an instruction on both.\nMR. HOOD: I -- I --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And I don't understand why\nnot.\nMR. HOOD: Yes, sir, I understand. But there\nagain, if we go back to what the Federal standards are,\nwe're talking about what the United States Constitution\nrequires, and therefore, I would submit to the Court that\nwe should apply what the Federal law is. And that law is\n-- number one, is it a lesser-included offense? Using the\nelements test, murder is not a lesser-included offense to\ncapital murder, and the reason being is because capital\nmurder is with or without intent and you add an additional\nelement of murder which requires intent. Same goes for\nmanslaughter because you had the additional sudden\nprovocation element.\nSo I would say that if we follow the Federal\nstandard and -- and that's -- that's the floor, and the\nfloor is it's got to be a lesser-included offense, it --\nit's not a -- a lesser-included offense. So therefore\nthat should answer the question.\nSecondly, under the Federal standard, you have\nto prove that -- that the court -- the judge has to decide\nthat the -- a reasonable juror would acquit of the greater\noffense and also convict of the lesser. Well, Mississippi\nlaw does not require that, but I -- I'd submit to the\nCourt that -- that after the Beck decision in 1980, our\nsupreme court in the case of In re Jordan -- they applied\nthe Federal standard. They required that -- when they\nanalyzed Beck, they applied the Federal standard, in other\nwords, the -- the part about that you have to acquit. You\nhave to acquit on -- on the greater offense. And they\nalso included the lesser-included offense language in that\nBeck analysis.\nSo, therefore, had he properly raised the\njurisdictional issue -- there's nowhere in the record does\nhe cite Beck. There's nowhere in the record that he\nstates facts that would even support Beck. So had he even\nproperly reached that issue and -- and cited Beck, I would\nsubmit to the Court that the facts don't support it under\nMississippi law. The facts don't support it under Federal\nlaw. And it doesn't meet the lesser-included offense\nstandard.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: May -- may I ask you? I'm\nunclear on -- on lesser-included in Mississippi. And I'm\ngoing to take this step by step.\nMR. HOOD: Yes, sir.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And tell me if I'm right or\nwrong at each step.\nThe offense that he was charged with -- the\ncapital offense that he was charged with was killing with\nor without intent in the course of committing a crime. Is\nthat correct?\nMR. HOOD: Yes, sir.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All right. Now, his claim --\nlet's assume he claims this. There is evidence from --\nfrom which you -- you could infer that he wasn't\ncommitting a crime. He may or may not be right, but let's\nassume that's his claim, and let's assume the judge says,\nyes, there's some evidence that would indicate that he\nwasn't up there robbing at the time he stood next to the\ncar. Assume the judge accepts that. He then says, on\nthat assumption, I want a lesser-included offense\ninstruction of simple murder, killing with intent. Is\nthat a lesser-included offense under -- under capital\nmurder?\nMR. HOOD: There again, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Because what he's saying is,\nI'm asking for an instruction on an offense which is\nlesser -- it does not -- it's an offense that doesn't\ninclude the course of the crime, but it does include the\nother elements. It includes killing with intent. Isn't\nthat lesser-included on your definition of Mississippi\nhomicide law?\nMR. HOOD: No, sir. And -- and I would say that\nunder the Federal standard, clearly it's not a lesser-\nincluded offense. I would say under the State --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes. I mean, he's got to\nqualify under the Federal standard. He says, the offense\nI was charged with was killing with or without intent,\nplus crime. I want an instruction that says nothing about\nplus crime but simply charges on killing with or without\nintent. Isn't he asking under Federal law for a lesser-\nincluded instruction?\nMR. HOOD: No, sir. He didn't -- first of all,\nhe never --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All right. Confine it to\nkilling with intent.\nMR. HOOD: Yes, sir.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Under -- under -- as I\nunderstood -- as I understood you to define the capital\noffense, the State could prove the capital offense by\nsaying he did have intent when he killed and he also\nhappened to be committing a crime. Am I wrong about that\nstatement of Mississippi law?\nMR. HOOD: I'm sorry, Your Honor. I apologize.\nI -- I didn't follow you.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I thought you said that on the\ncapital offense, the killing could be with or without\nintent.\nMR. HOOD: Right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I -- I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think you confuse us by\nsaying that. If you just left that out of your statement,\nfelony murder is killing in the course of a crime. Don't\nsay anything about intent. Intent is not an element of\nfelony murder. Right?\nMR. HOOD: Yes, sir.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So if you want to get plain\nmurder, you're adding an element.\nMR. HOOD: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It has to be murder with\nintent, and that's why you say it's not a lesser-included\noffense because for plain murder, you need intent, and for\nfelony murder, you don't need intent.\nMR. HOOD: Thank you, sir.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't that -- isn't that your\ncase?\nMR. HOOD: Yes, sir.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So that the Mississippi law for\nfelony murder is killing, pure and simple, plus crime, and\nsimple murder is killing plus intent. And that plus\nintent is why it is not lesser-included.\nMR. HOOD: Yes, sir, on a felony --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. I understand you now.\nLet -- let me ask you this as a matter of -- on\n-- on the second point, as a matter of Mississippi law.\nUnder the charge of capital murder, was there a\npossibility of sentencing to life or life without parole,\nas well as the possibility of the death penalty upon\nconviction?\nMR. HOOD: Yes, sir, and that's why I would\nsubmit to the Court it distinguishes --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. So that's the second\nreason why it would not fall within the -- the Beck rule.\nMR. HOOD: Yes, sir.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. HOOD: I'd like to also point out factually\nthat in the -- in the -- initially in the petition, the --\nand actually at trial and at the Mississippi Supreme\nCourt, they talked about that the defendant may have been\nable -- may have been out there selling drugs to the\ndefendant. I'd submit to the Court that a proper review of\nthe record, if you look at the Mississippi Supreme Court\nopinion at page 98 and -- 97 and 98 and page 40, the\ndefendant in his own brief admits that that was not in\nevidence. It came from the -- from a plea where the --\nwhere one of the co-defendants pled, and it never was\nplaced before the jury.\nHere in -- in the brief in this particular case,\nthey talk about, well, he -- maybe he was borrowing money,\nthe sting question, whether he was borrowing money. That\ncomment came from one of the witnesses named Powell who\nwas merely speculating. I don't know what he was talking\nabout a sting, but it could have been that he was going to\nborrow money or -- or rob somebody. So that -- that was\nspeculation. So the -- the facts just don't support the\ngranting of a lesser-included offense in this particular\ncase.\nI'd also like to ask the Court to -- to note\nthat in Hopkins v. Reeves in footnote 7, the -- the Court\nsuggests that we don't decide that -- that particular case\nbased upon the bifurcation issue alone. I would ask that\nthe Court answer that question in this particular case and\nstate that Beck has no application in this particular case\nbecause the danger that occurred and the Court's concern\nwith in Beck is not -- doesn't happen here in the\nMississippi instance because in Jackson v. State, we\nhad already said that you have a bifurcated hearing --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, but -- but it is true\nthat -- that there's a difference between becoming\neligible for the death penalty, on the one hand, and not\nbeing eligible on the other. And conceivably the Beck\nconcern is triggered when the failure to give a lesser-\nincluded offense gives the jury the option of -- no other\noption other than convicting of a capital offense.\nMR. HOOD: Justice Stevens, I -- I would\nrespectfully disagree. We believe that the -- the Beck\nissue is just with this question. You have a choice of\nguilt and death penalty or acquittal. This question that\nthey're raising is conviction, not death penalty, or\nacquittal. And those are separate issues.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- an offense for which the\ndeath penalty is the punishment.\nMR. HOOD: Yes, sir, but it doesn't impact the\nguilt phase, and that was what the problem was, I believe,\nin Beck, was that -- that a jury might not -- they don't\nwant to turn him loose because -- and they give him a\nconviction, which automatically carries the death penalty.\nAnd that impacts the jury. And I understand that. That\nwas a proper decision, but that just didn't happen here in\nthis particular case. And Mississippi has just\ndistinguished Beck.\nI don't believe that they properly raise this\nCourt's jurisdiction. They never cite Beck. They never\nraised -- they never said due process.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, but if the jurors' concern\nis that you either have to acquit them or -- we want to\nmake sure he never walks out of prison again, and the only\nway to do that is to convict him of a capital offense so\nthe judge can impose the death penalty. I don't know why\nthat Beck wouldn't be triggered on those facts.\nMR. HOOD: Well, maybe I don't understand the\nquestion correctly. But in Beck, you know, the jury\nwasn't told that the judge would have a separate option of\ndenying the death penalty. In this case, judge in State's\n-- court instruction C-5, the court says you are not to\nconsider the sentence, that you only consider the issue of\nguilt or innocence of the charge. And so that's why I say\nthis is not a Beck issue because it doesn't impact the --\nthe jury's determination in the guilt phase.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it seems to me that\nworks against you because it takes away from the jury the\noption of saying, well, we'll convict him of a serious\noffense, but we'll be sure not to give him a capital\noffense. So that -- it seems to me that that argument\nthen works against you.\nMR. HOOD: Well, Justice Kennedy, in\nMississippi, we have, there again, that open standard, not\nthe Federal standard. And we would give him that\ninstruction and give that jury that option if the facts\nsupport it, and I respectfully submit to the Court that --\nthat the facts do not support a lesser-included offense\nunder these facts.\nIf the Court has no further questions, thank\nyou.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, General Hood.\nMr. Mitchell, you have about 4 and a half\nminutes left.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RONNIE M. MITCHELL\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. MITCHELL: Justice Stevens, and -- and may\nit please the Court:\nWith regard to the argument that the State makes\nhere that these individuals had ridden around all night\nwith a plan to rob and that, therefore, there were no\nother -- there was no other possibility for the court to\nconsider in -- in granting instructions, first, it is our\ncontention that both Mississippi law and due process law\nrequires a judge to instruct a jury on all of the relevant\nissues in the case, on all the relevant law in the case.\nAnd in Fairchild v. State, that is precisely what the\nMississippi court did in saying that a court could not\nsimply conclude, no matter how strong the evidence of\nattempt to rob or plan to rob, that it could, in effect,\ndirect a verdict and not instruct on lesser-included\noffenses.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, your -- were the two\nprincipal lesser-included offenses in -- in your view your\nD-13 and D-18 that are in the appendix?\nMR. MITCHELL: Your Honor, those are the ones\nthat were -- were, in fact, raised. We believe that\nrather than intent the -- on the simple murder, that the\nissue is malice as opposed to intent. The statutory\ndefinition, for example, of manslaughter in -- in\nMississippi statute 97-3 -- I believe -27 is a killing of\na human being without malice and while not in the\ncommission of these felonies.\nNow, it may be that simply a small-town lawyer\nfrom -- from North Carolina is told don't go to the big\ncity and get stung by some guy coming up to you and\nsaying, you know, I just got off the bus and I need to get\nsome money from you and my kids and my wife are waiting\nfor me in the hotel room. But that happens not only in\nthe big city, it also happens in Mississippi. And so\nthere was a basis in which a jury could reasonably infer\nthat there was a reason to approach that vehicle other\nthan an attempted robbery. And the question is, what is a\nreasonable inference?\nThe Mississippi court here in its opinion said\nthat there was clearly evidence from which a jury could\ninfer robbery. We concede that, but there were also other\ninferences that this evidence raised, and that evidence,\nwe respectfully submit, mandated a lesser-included offense\ninstruction.\nWe also contend that -- that the State has not,\nheretofore, raised any issue about Beck's continuing\nvitality, but we respectfully submit that Beck is of\ncontinuing vitality. Just a -- a survey of even habeas\ncorpus cases from the various circuits will show that the\ncircuits are continuing to apply Beck even in States where\nthe statutory sentencing scheme is far different from Beck\nand there is no preclusive statute involved, as there was\nin Alabama.\nWe respectfully submit that the language in Beck\nitself speaks to this issue. The Beck court added, the\nsame reasoning must apply to rules that diminish the\nreliability of the -- the guilt determination, the very\npoint that Justice Kennedy pointed out undercuts\nMississippi's argument. It is this diminution of the\nreliability of the guilt determination that is at issue\nhere.\nIn addition to that, we would respectfully\nsubmit that under these circumstances, there was a basis\nunder which a lesser-included offense instruction was\nmandated because Beck did not apply the Blockburger test.\nIn fact, it did not incorporate Blockburger, did not refer\nto Mullaney v. Wilbur. What it did was it said if there\nis a lesser-included offense, as defined by State law.\nAll of the succeeding cases from this Court have said if\nthere is a lesser-included offense, as defined by State\nlaw, conceding that State law is the applicable standard\nthen and not the standard that the State now seeks to\nimpose, which it never raised in -- in its brief, which it\nhas never asserted to be the standard. Blockburger is\ncertainly not cited in anything that the State has\nsubmitted. Blockburger is not contended to be the basis,\nnor could it be. The basis is is there a lesser-included\noffense under State law, and we contend that that is the\nbasis on which this case should be decided.\nThank you very much.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Mitchell.\n"
