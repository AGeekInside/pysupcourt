        "content": "(10:04 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst this morning in Case 11-1059, Genesis HealthCare\nv. Symczyk.\nMr. Mann.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD MANN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. MANN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThe decision of the court of appeals\ndeprives the Defendant of the ability to free itself\nfrom litigation, even when it is willing to pay complete\nrelief to the sole Plaintiff; thus, as long as the\nPlaintiff refuses to accept full and complete payment, a\nputative collective action must continue onward to\ncertification.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Did that offer include\nadmission of liability?\nOr was it just that it was going to pay the\namount of damages requested?\nMR. MANN: That's a good question,\nJustice Ginsburg. Because it was an offer of judgment,\nif the offer had been accepted, the result would have\nbeen a judgment by the Federal court imposing liability\nunder the statute, under the Fair Labor Standards Act,\non the Defendant, and requiring the Defendant to pay\nfull and complete relief, including costs and attorneys'\nfees, to the Plaintiffs. So there would have been a\njudgment of the Federal court imposing liability under\nthe statute.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So if -- if there were\njudgment of liability, then that would be preclusive for\nall other people similarly situated?\nMR. MANN: Well, I think there is rules of\nissuing claim conclusion that would flow from the\njudgment, and it would have -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that -- so the next\ncase is another employee who claims uncompensated work\ntime, and that's brought on behalf of similarly situated\npeople. Then that next case, the employer would be -\nwould be subject to summary judgment because the\nliability has been established.\nMR. MANN: Well, there would be a variety of\nfact questions that would have to be resolved to\ndetermine the extent of the preclusion from the first\njudgment. But the rules of issue and claim preclusion\nwould apply. And to the extent those rules call for\nmatters that were comprehended within the judgment to\nbind, in a later case, they would.\nI think the way that I would put it, looking\nback to Justice Kagan's opinion in the Smith v. Bayer\ncase, it's common for there to be a preclusive effect of\na judgment in one case against people that are not\nparties. And this would have been a judgment imposing\nliability under the Fair Labor Standards Act, based on\nthe allegations made in the complaint. And that's\nwhat -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, so what am I to\nmake of your transmittal letter which says, in the offer\nitself, that -- JA 5556, that Petitioners make clear\nthat the offer of judgment, quote, \"was not to be\nconstrued as an admission that Petitioners are liable in\nthis action or that Respondent has suffered any damage\"?\nWhat -- what are we to make of that -\nMR. MANN: Well, let me -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- when you're now\nclaiming that you would have accepted a judgment of\nliability?\nMR. MANN: Well, I don't think that you have\nto rely on my statements here, to say that we would have\naccepted judgment of liability at that time. The -- the\noffer itself was a formal offer of judgment on a form\npromulgated by the trial court.\nThe offer itself is not an admission of\nliability. The offer itself is not a judgment against\nthe Defendant. The offer is a statement that, under the\nordinary rules for Rule 68, if -- if they accept the\noffer, it would be a judgment against our client.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How did you pick the\n$7,500?\nMR. MANN: That's detailed later in the\nJoint Appendix, at pages 77 to 79. But, essentially,\nwhat our client did is they took the amount of time for\nbreaks during the Respondent's period of employment and\noffered her full wages for all of the break time, so\nthat whatever amount of break time was appropriately\ncharged for her -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I see in the -- in the\nFLSA, that it also requires an amount for liquidated\ndamages. Did you include that amount as well?\nMR. MANN: Yes, Your Honor -- yes, Justice\nSotomayor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, what if the\ndistrict court -- this proceeding -- you filed the\nsuggestion of -- of mootness, whatever, and the judge\nsays, okay, I have this suggestion of mootness, I also\nwant to address the certification issue, the mootness\nargument is scheduled for three months down the road,\nthe certification issue for two months down the road;\nisn't this just a question of what order the district\ncourt wants to address these two issues?\nMR. MANN: Okay. So there is two things I\nwant to say about that. The first one is to talk about\nwhat happened in this particular case, which is the case\nthat's before the Court; and, the second is to discuss\nthe practical consequences of what could have happened\nin some other case.\nSo what happened in this case is that it was\nuncontested that the offer provided complete relief.\nAnd so the Respondent suffered a judgment to be entered\nagainst her because of the conceded acts of the offer.\nAnd at the time that judgment was entered, nothing had\nbeen done about certification. At the time the offer\nwas entered -- had made -- nothing had been done about\ncertification.\nSo what we -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it was not possible\nfor anything to be done about the certification because\nyou moved immediately. The complaint is filed, and then\nyou moved -- then you immediately offered the judgment\nthat you did.\nMR. MANN: Well, I think there is two\nquestions to unpack here that -- that are implicit in\nboth what the Chief Justice is commenting on and what\nyou're commenting on, Justice Ginsburg.\nOne is the question that was presented in\nthe petition, which is: What is the effect on a\ncollective action if, before certification or any motion\nfor collective process has been determined, the sole\nplaintiff loses the case.\nThe second one is: How do you deal with the\nhousekeeping issues of terminating the interest of a\nplaintiff when there's no longer controversy between the\nplaintiff and the defendant?\nAnd so -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, it seems as though\nit's more than housekeeping issue that's involved here\nbecause -- I mean, I realize that you have an argument\nabout what happens when the plaintiff's individual\nclaims have been fully satisfied, but the plaintiff\ncontinues to want to represent other individuals.\nBut, here, the plaintiff's individual claims\nhave not been fully satisfied. She walked away with\nnothing. She walked away with no judgment, and she\nwalked away with no $7,500. And the question is: How\ncan it possibly be that her individual claim was moot?\nMR. MANN: Okay. So I think there is two -\nagain, there's two things to say. One is: We view it\nas a housekeeping question because it seems to us clear\nthat, if the defendant no longer wishes to contest\nliability and formally offers to pay all of the relief\nthat the person could possibly win in any formal\nlitigation, it has to be the case that the individual's\ninterest is moot.\nNow, it might be that the appropriate\nresponse is, as is consistent with the Third Circuit, is\nthat the district court should just dismiss the case\nbecause, if the person won't take yes for an answer, the\nFederal court doesn't need anything further -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there is nothing in\nRule 68 -- you're basing the -- your position on a rule\nthat provides as the only sanction, if the plaintiff\ncontinues and gets less than the offer of proof, then\nthe plaintiff has to pay the costs. Rule 68 doesn't say\nanything about dismissing suits.\nMR. MANN: Well, I don't think our position\ndepends on Rule 68 at all for the mootness. Our\nposition for the mootness is that, if there's no further\ncontroversy about the relief that is created by the\ncause of action, there's nothing more for the trial\ncourt to do -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, let me ask you\nthis -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice Kennedy.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Let me ask you just this\nquestion -- just tell me as a matter of common practice,\ndo district courts enter judgments against plaintiffs\nroutinely when a full offer of settlement has been made\nand the defendant just is silent? I mean, does this\nhappen?\nI just can't remember seeing a -- but\nthis -\nMR. MANN: There's -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It may -- it may be that\nit's common practice that, if the plaintiff doesn't\nreply and there's an offer that's filed with the court,\nthe court says, I haven't heard anything, I'm going to\nenter judgment.\nMR. MANN: I think -- I think that the\ncourts of appeals have taken a variety of approaches to\nwhat I'm characterizing as a housekeeping question of,\nif there's no further controversy between the plaintiff\nand the defendant, how do we move the case off our\ndocket? One approach, which is followed by some of the\ncourts of appeals, is that you enter a judgment against\nthe plaintiff, whether they like it or not.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: As a matter of\nhousekeeping, you could -\nMR. MANN: In favor of the plaintiff -- you\nenter a judgment in favor of the plaintiff -- that needs\nto be clear -- in favor of the plaintiff -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Right.\nMR. MANN: Whether they want a judgment or\nnot, you say, here's everything you asked for; you must\ntake it.\nAnother approach is to say, if they're\nwilling to give you everything to which you're entitled\nand you won't take it, then there's no reason why we\nshould continue to adjudicate your case because there's\nnot really a controversy. Our -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, here's what -- here is\nwhat the Court said last in Knox last year, when it\nsaid, \"What makes a case moot?\" It says, \"A case\nbecomes moot when it's impossible for a court to grant\nany effectual relief whatever to the prevailing party.\"\nNow, here, the judge says, okay, is this\ncase moot? Well, it's not moot because I could give -\nat the very least, I could give the plaintiff $7500,\nbut, I didn't give the plaintiff $7500, so she still has\nher claim for at least $7500, regardless of the\ncollective side of this action. I mean, she hasn't been\nsatisfied.\nMR. MANN: Okay. So let -- let me respond\nto that. I think Knox flows naturally from Friends of\nthe Earth, and I think they're both saying exactly the\nsame thing. And the -- the -- what's going on in those\ncases -- and I suppose in the Nike case from last\nmonth -- is this general problem of a defendant is faced\nwith a piece of litigation, and they no longer wish to\ncontest it.\nIf the action seeks prospective relief, it's\nquite difficult, once the case has begun, for the\ndefendant to convince the court that they are going to\nchange their conduct in a way that moots the claim for\nprospective relief. And this Court's had a series of\ncases and has often not been convinced of that.\nIn a case that only seeks retrospective\nrelief, it's somewhat easier to convince the court of\nthat. One way would be to formally offer to pay\neverything the person could get.\nWhat happened in this case and what's before\nthe Court is simply if that happens. So what happened\nhere is there was an offer that was conceded to be\nadequate, and the plaintiff suffered a judgment to be\nentered against her on the premise that she had no\nfurther claim.\nAnd the question is, if that interest is\ngone, which has been conceded at all stages of the\nlitigation, until the bottom side briefing on the merits\nin this Court, what's the consequences for the\ncollective action?\nAnd so what the parties have litigated\nabout -- because this was conceded repeatedly over the\ncourse of several years, is what happens when that\ninterest is moot.\nNow, we believe that it is correct that a\ndefendant, faced with litigation that it does not wish\nto contest, can terminate the litigation.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What do you do when -\nwhen you have a governing statute that says that an\nemployee may bring suit for and in behalf of himself and\nother employees similarly situated? Can you use a mere\nrule, Rule 68, to carve out what the statute authors -\nauthorizes; that is, that the employee can seek relief\non behalf of himself and others similarly situated?\nMustn't you give a chance for the statutory\nprovision to work, which you didn't. By filing\nimmediately, you didn't allow the normal process of\ninviting opt-ins to occur.\nMR. MANN: I think that the language of the\nstatute, Section 216(b) of the Fair Labor Standards Act,\nprovides compelling guidance for the case that the court\nof appeals ignored.\nIn this case, because it's under the Fair\nLabor Standards Act, the very paragraph you're looking\nat, Congress has opined -- and I'll say it's only an\nopinion because the lower courts ignored it. But\nCongress at least has opined as to how you tell when\npeople that are not yet before the court can be treated\nas relevant.\nAnd the answer is the non-party plaintiffs\ncannot be part of the case until they formally opt-in -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but you have to give\nthe plaintiff an opportunity. That -\nMR. MANN: The -- the statute does not say,\nif a plaintiff files a case and alleges that other\npeople are similarly situated, the case shall not be\ndismissed until the court has proceeded to conclusively\ndetermine the propriety of certification. It doesn't\nsay that.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose -- suppose the\nplaintiff had simultaneously, with the filing of the\ncomplaint, moved to have it first preliminarily\ncertified as on behalf of other employees situated; so,\ninstead of having the complaint, which was labelled a\ncollective complaint, separate from a motion for\ncertification, they came together, that the plaintiff\nfiled a complaint and immediately filed a motion for\ncertification and a request to discover the names of\nother people simply situated.\nMR. MANN: I think the answer to that would\nflow directly from this Court's decision in Geraghty.\nThe first question would be: At the time that the\ndefendant's interest becomes moot, who is a party to the\ncase? And the answer would be: Well, there's just this\none person.\nThe next question would be: Has the\ndistrict court ruled on certification in a way that\ncould have erroneously caused the mootness? Well, the\nanswer would be, no, because it became moot not because\nof an erroneous district court ruling on certification,\nwhich was the situation in Geraghty -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So your answer is it\nwouldn't make any difference?\nMR. MANN: It wouldn't make any difference.\nWhat Geraghty turns on, and -- and I encourage you to\nlook at the portion of footnote 11 that -- the last two\nparagraphs of that footnote that goes over onto page\n407, the court emphasizes -- all we're saying here, all\nwe're saying here is that, if the basis of mootness is\nan error by the district court and if we later ascertain\nthat error, we will not only correct the error about\ncertification, but we will forgive the mootness that\nflowed from that error.\nIn this court case, there's no suggestion\nthat the district court error caused mootness to occur.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I don't\nknow that you've answered my question sometime ago, but\nwhat -- if the judge can simply order the two\ndeterminations in a way that certification is addressed\nbefore mootness, does that take care of your problem?\nObviously, if you grant certification, there\nis an ongoing controversy. And under Roper and\nGeraghty, if you deny certification, the relation-back\ndoctrine applies.\nMR. MANN: I think that -- that those cases\nprovide a way to analyze that situation. So one\npossibility is that the district judge grants\ncertification at some moment after the plaintiffs filed,\nand then later in time, the sole person who is in the\ncase at that time loses their interest in the case for\none reason or another. But -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, there's no\ndoubt that -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I have -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. There's\nno doubt that that -- in that situation, the case goes\nforward, right?\nMR. MANN: There is doubt in that case. And\nwe would suggest that it's clear that it doesn't go\nforward.\nUnder the Fair Labor Standards Act, as\nopposed to Rule 23, which was at issue in Geraghty, even\nafter the district judge signs an order saying, pursuant\nto Justice Kennedy's opinion in Hoffman, we should send\nnotices out to see if we can find some new plaintiffs,\nif none of those people have yet appeared before the\ncourt and signed into the case, there is still only one\nplaintiff.\nSo in Geraghty, it was important to the\nCourt that, when the case got here, although the\ninterest of the named prisoner had been vitiated, there\nwere several people who had filed motions to intervene.\nAnd so it appeared that, at all times, there were other\npeople.\nIn this case, by contrast, there's every\nreason to think that, after the person's interest was\nvitiated, there were no other plaintiffs because -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what do you -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, can I ask a\nfundamental question under Rule 68? I mean, when I was\na district court judge, if parties told me about their\nsettlement discussions, I would get quite upset. But,\nit says explicitly -- explicitly, \"Evidence of an\nunaccepted offer is not admissible except in a\nproceeding to determine costs.\"\nWhat authorizes you to use evidence of that\noffer to argue anything -\nMR. MANN: So, again -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- especially when a -\nthe statute gives the plaintiff an absolute statutory\nright to refuse it at a specific penalty? What permits\nyou to use it as evidence of anything, mootness -- I\ndon't care what you're using it for -- except in cost?\nMR. MANN: Okay. So I would say two things.\nThe first thing is, of course, the plaintiff did not\nchallenge the use of the offer in the trial court.\nThe second thing, responsive to your\nquestion on the merits is, trial courts have considered\nthis question, have generally considered that the offer\nis admissible by analogy to Rule 408, which deals with\nsettlement discussions more generally, and the Advisory\nCommittee Notes discuss this.\nAnd the general idea is the offer is being\nadmitted for a purpose other than to prove the validity\nor amount of the disputed claim. And so -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: This makes no sense to me\nbecause, if the offer is for judgment, it has to be\nproof of validity and amount because, at least you\nhave -- you should be able to get a judgment.\nMR. MANN: Well, I think that the offer is\nnot being admitted to prove the validity of the\nplaintiff's claim or the amount of the plaintiff's\nclaim. The offer is being admitted to prove that the\nplaintiff has no -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But didn't you just tell me\nthat an offer results in an admission of liability and a\njudgment for a particular amount?\nMR. MANN: If the plaintiff accepts the\noffer, then the district judge will enter offer -- will\nenter judgment for the plaintiff in the amount of the\noffer.\nThe district courts that have considered\nthis have ordinarily concluded that, in cases where the\noffer is not accepted and the defendant contends that\nthe offer is complete, that the offer can be admitted\nfor the purpose of proving that there is no controversy\nbetween the parties, which is distinct from admitting it\nfor the purpose of proving the validity or amount of the\nclaim.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Mann, could -- could I\ncome back to your response to the question of Knox -\nthe statement in Knox that -- you know, where the court\ncan issue -- can provide no relief, there is -- there is\nno standing. That -- I would have thought your answer\nto that is -- is not -- I mean, you -- you answered it\non the facts, but that statement was not meant to be\nexclusive, that that's the only situation in which\nthere -- there is no standing.\nIt was addressing just the third prong of\nour -- of our standing doctrine, namely the prong that,\nwhere the court can issue no relief, the remedial -- the\nremedial prong, that one of -- one of the elements of\nstanding is the court has to be able to provide relief.\nBut there are other elements to standing as well,\nincluding whether there is injury, in fact, and whether\nthe injury is -- you know, springs from the action that\nis challenged. And those -- those prongs would continue\nto exist.\nI didn't think Knox's statement was meant to\nbe all-inclusive, that that's the only -- only way in\nwhich standing can be eliminated.\nMR. MANN: I think that's correct,\nJustice Scalia. And so the problem that we face here is\nthe -- the questioning relates to something that has -\nwas not disputed below. And our position is a\nrelatively simple one, which is that, under the doctrine\nof mootness, it has to be correct that, if there is not\na controversy between the plaintiff and the defendant\nabout a cause of action that's authorized by law, then\nthe case is over.\nAnd that was all conceded below. The\nplaintiff suffered a judgment to be entered against her.\nShe did not challenge that judgment on appeal.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Mann -- excuse me.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Does the -- can I ask this\nquestion? Does the district court have the authority\nwhen an offer of judgment is made to hold a hearing as\nto whether the offer of judgment actually gives the\nplaintiff everything that the plaintiff could possibly\nget under the complaint?\nMR. MANN: We think that's the appropriate\nresponse. We think that what should happen is that, if\nthe defendant makes an offer of judgment and -- and\nfiles a motion to dismiss, suggesting that it provides\ncomplete relief, that if the plaintiff doesn't concede\nthat the case should be dismissed, the district judge\nshould hold a hearing, as the district judge did here -\nJUSTICE ALITO: But where -- where does it\nsay that in Rule 68?\nMR. MANN: The proceeding isn't under\nRule 68.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What is it under?\nMR. MANN: The proceeding is under\nRule 12(b), as a motion to dismiss for lack of\njurisdiction because the case is moot.\nSee, we don't think that it matters that the\noffer happened to be made under Rule 68. There are\nobvious -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, your -- your offer\nsays, you hereby offer to allow entry of judgment under\nRule 68.\nMR. MANN: But -- but we don't think that\nthe mootness of the case flows from Rule 68. The\nmootness of the case flows from the fact that there is\nnot a dispute between the parties about anything a\nFederal court can handle.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But the -- but the\nquestion from Justice Alito was, what happens, does the\ncourt have authority to have a hearing?\nMR. MANN: But the court -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And you said, oh, well,\nthis is not under Rule 68; but -- but you offered to\nallow entry of judgment under Rule 68.\nMR. MANN: And the -- and -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And incidentally, you\nnever did follow up and say that you wanted an entry of\njudgment. You just wanted a dismissal. And that's\nanother point.\nMR. MANN: Well, because -- because the\nplaintiff didn't accept the offer.\nOne course of action is we make an offer\nunder Rule 68, and the plaintiff says, all right, let's\nhave a judgment under Rule 68; in which case, there\nwould be a judgment under Rule 68.\nIn this case, the plaintiff said, I'm not\ninterested in Rule 68. And we said, all right. Well,\nnow what we see is a cause of action under Federal law\nCongress has created that specifies certain forms of\nrelief that are available to the plaintiff. And in this\ncase, there are damages, some liquidated damages, some\nattorneys' fees and costs. There is no injunctive or\ndeclaratory relief.\nAnd we have a defendant that is willing to\ngive more than you could possibly get if you win.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Was there attorneys' fees\nin that offer? I thought there wasn't in -\nMR. MANN: Yes. Yes, there were. The offer\nspecifically provides for attorneys' fees. And even if\nthe offer didn't provide for attorneys' fees, they would\nbe avail under Section 216(b) -\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. But this, I\ntake it, is a statutory case, not a constitutional case.\nThat is, do you have any constitutional objection if\nCongress had said, in 216(b), that Joe Smith and other\npeople similarly situated to Miss Laura Symczyk have a\ngenuine dispute with the employer, and the way they file\ntheir case is Miss Symczyk's case will be deemed to be\ntheir case as well, though it ceases to be their case,\nunless they confirm within 60 days of such-and-such, in\nwriting, that it is their case.\nIf Congress passed that statute, there\ncouldn't be a constitutional objection to it, could\nthere?\nMR. MANN: Well, I think there could be\nconstitutional objections, depending on the details of\nthe statute -\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no, no. Do you see\nwhat I'm driving at?\nIn other words, if Congress had explicitly\nsaid, in 216(b), that the Third Circuit's procedure is\nthe correct procedure for Mr. Joe Smith to bring his\ncase in such circumstances, if they had said that\nexplicitly, is there a constitutional objection? If so,\nwhat could it be?\nMR. MANN: I think the constitutional issues\nthat proposals like that might raise would flow from the\ndecision in Vermont Agency. And the question has to be\nwhether there is a person before the court -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, we know at least, since\nwe are doing -- I looked up a little bit, but Article\nIII is what was a case or controversy in Westminster in\n1788 or 1750 or whenever, that in Westminster, in a\ncourt of equity, I found at least two instances. A\nperson dies, there is no case with that person, but it\nremained in equity on the docket until the other person,\nthe -- the estate, came in.\nA woman could not bring a case if she was\nmarried. She starts as a single person. She gets\nmarried. Lo and behold, the case remains on the docket\nuntil her husband comes in. That's not a happy example,\nbut nonetheless, it's in point.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, I could find nothing\nthe other way, so I thought of the canon of\ninterpretation that equity deems to have been done what\nought to have been done -- or something like that.\nOthers on the Court will -- but the -- the point is that\nthere are instances -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Equity is wonderful.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What? Yes.\nIt remained on the docket in the Westminster\ncourts, even though there was no plaintiff.\nSo I would ask you again: Is there any\ncounterexample? Is there any instance from equity or\nelsewhere, where there is a constitutional objection,\nhad they said it, at which point our question is have\nthey said it?\nMR. MANN: I think the problem is, in that\ncase, there is an identifiable person to substitute. In\nthis case, it's not substituting somebody for the\nplaintiff. It's leaving the Federal -\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. It's Mr. Joe\nSmith, if he confirms it in writing.\nMR. MANN: The -- the problem in this type\nof case would be that the Federal proceeding would be\nmoving along for a substantial period of time with no\nplaintiffs. And the district judge's role would be\nsimply to assist the plaintiff in trying to find -\nplaintiff's counsel in trying to find new plaintiffs.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'll bet you equity could\nhave considered the husband to have been substituted\nautomatically and could have considered that -- the\nestate to have been substituted automatically. That -\nthat happens when -- when that particular element is -\nis eliminated. But there is nothing automatic about\ndiscovering some new plaintiff who -- who is out -- we\ndon't know who is out there.\nMR. MANN: On that note, I'd like to reserve\nthe remainder of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Katyal.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL KUMAR KATYAL\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. KATYAL: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nI'd like to begin with the question of\nwhether a withdrawn Rule 68 offer could moot a case. It\ncannot. This Court has said that Article III's case and\ncontroversy requirement demands both a plaintiff with a\nconcrete injury and a matter where the Court is fully\ncapable of -- of providing relief.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'd like to begin\nwith the question of whether or not you waived that\nargument.\nMR. KATYAL: Absolutely, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No -- did you waive\nit or not?\nMR. KATYAL: We -- We did not waive -- we\ndid not waive the -- we did not waive it. We do think\nthat the brief in opposition should have pointed it out,\nabsolutely. It was a mistake on our part not to -- not\nto bring to the Court's attention the -- the impact of\nan unaccepted Rule 68 offer. However, we do think that\nthis Court can -- can consider that, and the reason for\nthat is that it is an answer to the question presented.\nIndeed, it is literally the question presented.\nHere is the question presented as -- as my\nfriend Mr. Mann wrote it, whether a court -- \"whether a\ncase becomes moot and, thus, beyond the judicial power\nof Article III when the lone plaintiff receives an offer\nfrom the defendants to satisfy all of the plaintiff's\nclaims.\" And we submit that the answer to that question\nis no, that the mere receipt of an offer, without more,\ncannot possibly moot a case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that was not\nthe way the case was presented in the body of the\npetition, and I would suppose, if that were your\nobjection, that it wasn't received, wasn't accepted, we\nmight have heard about that, as you -- as you suggest.\nMR. KATYAL: And -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And if, in fact, we\nthought we were dealing with a case in which the Rule 68\noffer was not accepted, we might have thought\ndifferently about whether to grant it.\nMR. KATYAL: I -- I completely understand\nthat, Mr. Chief Justice. I guess I would say, however,\nthis Court, in Lebron, confronted a similar situation,\nin which the matter of whether Amtrak was a State actor,\nwas not present in the cert papers; indeed, it had been\ndisavowed, as Justice Scalia's opinion for the Court\nsaid.\nNonetheless, the Court considered it and -\nand got into the merits of that question. And we think\nhere, actually, it's an easier case for the Court to get\ninto than Lebron. Both -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I have a question for\nyou, counsel.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You -- you rely on\nthe question presented. Your reformulated question\ndoesn't have that feature in it.\nMR. KATYAL: It does have the unaccepted\noffer feature in the -- in the question, and of course,\nthis Court's decision in Bray does say that it is the\nquestion presented as the Court -- as the Court granted\nit, that controls.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, there is -\nfrom the beginning, you never accepted the offer.\nMR. KATYAL: That's exactly right, Justice\nSotomayor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What you appear to have\nconceded and -- is that the amount of the offer would\nsettle your personal claim.\nMR. KATYAL: I don't quite think we conceded\neven that. That's a separate matter. That's about what\nthe terms of the offer were. And our first point to you\nis to say this offer wasn't even accepted. Mr. Mann is\nwaxing nostalgic about an offer that literally has not\ngiven Ms. Symczyk a dime. She is as injured today as\nshe was the day she filed her complaint.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: What do you think the court\nshould do in that circumstance, where a defendant comes\nforward and says, I'm willing to satisfy the entire\nclaim? What should happen?\nMR. KATYAL: If -- we think that, just like\nthe Solicitor General, we think that, in that\ncircumstance, it is possible for a court to enter a\ndefault judgment and force relief upon the plaintiff.\nAnd we think -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Is this under Rule 68? Or\nis this under some inherent authority?\nMR. KATYAL: I think it could work either\nway, so long as the forcing happened within the time\nperiod of Rule 68. I don't think like -- the court can,\nlike Lazarus, raise this after it has already been\nwithdrawn. The text of Rule 68 says the offer is now\ndead. If they had, I imagine, moved for the court to\nenforce that order -- enforce that offer and enter a\ndefault judgment within the 14-day period, then I think\nthat would have been something that might have been\npossible to do.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- what benefit\ndoes this -- why are you arguing so much? You -- you\nwill have an entry of judgment in the favor of your\nclient who is, according to you, simply situated to lots\nof others.\nWhy don't you just -- if somebody comes\nforward, just take them in, go in, you get a check for\n$7500, or whatever it is, you get attorneys' fees, and\nyou can do that as often as you want.\nMR. KATYAL: For two reasons, Your Honor.\nThe first is, of course, that is precisely what didn't\nhappen here. Ms. Symczyk has zero, not even the\n$7500 -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I know. But\nthat's the fortuity of the fact that she didn't accept\nthe offer. And we are dealing, perhaps, with a case on\nthe record, as presented to us, where she did accept the\noffer, if you waive that argument. So -- so assume the\ncase where the offer is accepted.\nMR. KATYAL: And I think it goes back to\nwhat then-Justice Rehnquist said in Roper because what\nhe said is it's not then just about the individual\nplaintiff. You can't force an offer onto a plaintiff\nthat doesn't have all -- it doesn't award complete\nrelief because, if you do so, it undermines the\ncollective action aspect of the claim.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it undermines the\ncollective aspect, if she never brings the suit in the\nfirst place. I mean, I -- I must say I'm -- I'm not\nterribly impressed by the fact that -- you know, if she\ndrops out there is -- there is no collective suit for\nthese other people. There is also no collective suit\nfor these other people if she never appeared in the\nfirst place.\nI don't -- I don't know that the law demands\nthat there be a collective suit. If she doesn't bring\nsuit or if she brings suit and -- and is given\neverything she wants, the case is over, unless other\npeople have come in.\nMR. KATYAL: Justice Scalia, we think that\nthe Congress has answered that question, at least in\n216(b), by providing for both the opportunity to file a\ncomplaint on her own behalf, as well as for those that\nare similarly situated. And so I think that, as Justice\nGinsburg said to my -- to my friend, if you adopt their\nrule, essentially, you truncate that process and\neliminate the ability of people to opt in, in any given\nsituation.\nAnd that -- for that reason, it's very\nmuch -- assuming that we get to this question, that it\nis very much like Gerstein or Sosna or Roper in that\ncircumstance -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Katyal, I'm a little\ntroubled that you have given up or argue that the\nability to enter a forced judgment is permissible under\nRule 68. There is nothing in that rule that gives the\ncourt that power, certainly not stated explicitly or\neven implicitly, because it talks about an entire\nprocedure of accepting the offer or rejecting it, all of\nit in the hands of the parties, none of it until the\nentry of the judgment in the hands of the court and only\nafter the plaintiff has accepted the offer in writing.\nSo I can't see anything but an inherent\npower. So, for me, if there is an inherent power, it\nhas to be under a default judgment because the other\nside is saying, I give up.\nMR. KATYAL: Exactly.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right.\nMR. KATYAL: That -- that's precisely right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's go from there, at\nleast with me, and that may answer an earlier question\nabout an inquest on damages because that is a part of\nthe requirements for a default judgment, so that if\nthere is a dispute about damages, that can be resolved.\nBut my point is that liability is admitted.\nNow, let's deal with the Chief's question and Justice\nScalia's question, which is in what ways is this\ncomparable to a shared cost, like what motivated our\ndecision in class actions, that the settlement of one\nexisting plaintiff doesn't settle the collective action.\nHow is this similar to that?\nMR. KATYAL: So we think that the corpus of\ncases that this Court has handled in the class action\narea, such as Geraghty and Gerstein and the like, we\ndon't think that they absolutely control this question.\nI don't want to say that.\nBut we think that they set up two principles\nthat help inform the Court's judgment. The first is\nthat, when you have circumstances like this, in which a\nclaim has gone away as moot because the named\nrepresentative of the claim has gone away for one reason\nor another, there is play in the joints.\nEssentially, you can have a bridge plaintiff\nwho acts to keep the case alive for purposes of letting\nthe class unfold. That's really what then-Justice\nRehnquist was getting at in his decision in Roper. And\nwe think there is a lot of force to that because,\notherwise, as Justice Ginsburg mentioned, the collective\naction mechanism doesn't even get off the ground.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, you -- you don't\naccept the argument that I suggested, that is Rule 16 -\n216, the Fair Labor Standards Act, in saying that you\ncan commence a suit on behalf of others similarly\nsituated, and implicit in that is that there be some\ndecent interval for you to find similarly-situated\npeople?\nMR. KATYAL: We absolutely agree with that,\nand we think that's precisely the problem. And this\ncase illustrates it, Justice Ginsburg, because they -\nwe filed their complaint, and 75 days later, they filed\ntheir preemptive Rule 68 offer. And now, they are\ncoming before the Court and saying something even more\nradical than I think any court has accepted, to my\nknowledge, which is even filing a class certification\nmotion along with the complaint wouldn't be enough.\nThat is something that would essentially cut\nthe heart out of the collective action mechanism\naltogether.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why didn't -- why didn't\nyou file the -- the motion for certification, along with\nthe complaint?\nMR. KATYAL: Because the text of Rule -- of\n216(b) provides for two different processes, both the\nfiling of the complaint and then a subsequent opt-in\nprocess. I suppose we could have done that. That's\nwhat the Seventh Circuit has said to do in a case called\nDamasco, but this Court's decision in Hoffman-LaRoche\nsays the entire collective action mechanism depends on\nnotice and discovery to find out who those people are,\nto find out and make sure that they are similarly -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you could -- you\ncould have done that with the complaint and I don't -\nyou say you want to get joiners, so why do you have to\nwait? Why -- why wouldn't you -- why wouldn't the most\nlogical thing be to say, court, we have labelled this a\ncollective action, and now, we want to start the ball\nrolling in getting certification?\nMR. KATYAL: Your Honor, that is what we\ndid. You know, we -- we asked the district court, right\nafter the Rule 68 offer expired, within 4 days, to say,\nplease set up a class certification process. And that\nprocess was then interrupted by their subsequent motion,\nafter the Rule 68 offer had expired, to say, this case\nis moot.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It doesn't matter in\nterms of what the judge is supposed to do with your\nmotion to certify, if nobody else is in the case? I\nmean, isn't that one of the factors?\nI don't know if it's even a sort of\ngood-faith pleading if -- if -- you want certification,\nbut there is no nobody else there.\nMR. KATYAL: That's precisely, Mr. Chief\nJustice, why we think the Seventh Circuit rule doesn't\nmake much sense. To come in and to ask for\ncertification before you've conducted the discovery and\ngotten the names, we think is really not the right way\nto go.\nRather, I think this Court's decisions in\nIqbal and Twombly suggest that you've got to have some\ngood-faith belief before you go and file a motion for\nclass certification. And I'd be very hesitant for this\nCourt to -- to recommend a rule to litigants that says\ngo and file your motion for class certification right\naway.\nThis Court, in McLaughlin, I think,\nessentially said that it's not about the timing of when\nthat motion for certification unfolds. At 500 US page\n68, the Court said, \"The fact the class was not\ncertified until after the named plaintiffs' claims had\nbecome moot does not deprive the Court of jurisdiction.\nWe recognize in Gerstein that some claims are so\ntransitory\" -- \"inherently transitory that the trial\ncourt will not even have enough time to rule on a motion\nfor class certification.\"\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, you're\ninterpreting -- I think it's true that we're\ninterpreting the statute, and -- and I'm trying to look\nat what document are we interpreting? Is there a\ndifferent rule or a different -- what -- what rule?\nSo I could come back to the statute. And\nCongress could deprive -- could provide exactly the\nsystem that you suggest. I don't see anything\nunconstitutional about it. But isn't it a little hard\nto read this statute as providing that mechanism, since\nwhat it says is no party shall -- no -- you know, it\nsays what it says in the last two sentences.\nHow do we read that to foresee the mechanism\nthat you're talking about?\nMR. KATYAL: Right. I take it this is\nMr. Mann's point, that people who aren't yet opted into\na class are not parties, and, therefore, the Court can't\nproperly consider them. And I think that's the same\nexact thing in the class action context, is this\nquestion -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, he says the\ndifference in the class action context is, in the class\naction context, you can consider them there, but there\nisn't a specific sentence somewhere in a statute, which\nsays, no one shall be a party unless he signs in\nwriting.\nMR. KATYAL: Your -- Your Honor, I think\nnothing turns on their designation as party status or\nnot; rather, the relation-back doctrine, to the extent\nthe Court wants to get into it and deem this offer where\nwe got nothing, somehow, they want to deem it against\nus, but if it does and wants to get into the\nrelation-back doctrine, I think it would find that it is\nbased on the idea that the cases would otherwise go\naway, and that you need a bridge plaintiff -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, why? Why?\nMR. KATYAL: And it's a very important\nreason -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because that's -- why?\nWhy, is my question?\nMR. KATYAL: The reason for that goes back\nto this Court's decision in Flast -- in Flast, in which\nit said that, in the kinds of cases we're talking about\nhere, it's not as if we're risking a merits judgment in\nwhich relief is going to be imposed against one party\nand possibly trench on the separation of powers.\nRather, the worst that happens, if you rule\nfor us, or if you rule for the plaintiffs in those\ncases, is that the case goes back down on remand to find\nout whether or not any of those parties can be\nidentified and come forward. If they do, then you can\nreach the merits.\nBut this is a very different separation of\npowers inquiry than the one -- in the case in\ncontroversy inquiry than the one that the Court\ntraditionally handles.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It -- it's hard for me to\naccept the relation-back doctrine for your purposes\nwhen -- when it's clear, under the statute, that if\nparties come in beyond the statute of limitations\nperiod, they're not in. Their -- their entry is not\ndeemed to relate back to the filing of the original\ncomplaint, is it?\nMR. KATYAL: It -- for purposes of the\nstatute of limitations, exactly.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: For purposes of the statute\nof -- so you want one relation-back doctrine for the\nstatute and a different one for what we're discussing\nhere.\nMR. KATYAL: Absolutely. And we think,\nactually -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I know you do.\nMR. KATYAL: And -- and, Justice Scalia, we\nthink that that statute of limitations argument cuts the\nother way.\nSo the statute of limitations provision,\nwhich is Section 255, says that, \"in determining when an\nact is commenced for purposes of the statute,\" and so we\ndon't think it bears on the question or not of whether\nrelation back applies.\nMuch to the contrary, the real worry in the\nclass action context -- and, indeed, my friend's opening\nline is, \"These cases are going to linger forever, and\nthe defendants are going to have no tool.\"\nBut in the Fair Labor Standards Act context,\nactually, it's the very reverse because every day counts\nagainst the plaintiffs and their counsel. They are\nincentivized to bring these cases quickly because the\nclock is literally ticking.\nAnd so you don't have, I think, the same\nworry that you do in the regular class action context of\none plaintiff, who can essentially save the day for all\nof the different -- for all of the different parties.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Katyal, if we do get to\nthe question that Mr. Mann wants us to raise, you spend\na lot of time talking about McLaughlin and talking about\nGerstein. Those cases were about prospective relief.\nYou're asking for retrospective relief. Why doesn't\nthat make a difference?\nMR. KATYAL: We think that it is a\ndifference, but we don't think it's enough to change\nthis. And it's for the reasons that then-Justice\nRehnquist said in Roper.\nHere -- here is what he said -- this is at\n445 US 341. \"The distinguishing feature here is that\nthe defendant has made an unaccepted offer. The action\nis moot in the Article III sense, only if this Court\nadopts a rule an individual seeking to proceed as class\nrepresentative is required to accept a tender of only\nhis individual claims acceptance need not be mandated\nunder our precedents since the defendant has not offered\nall that has been requested in the complaint (i.e.,\nrelief for the class), and any other rule would make the\nquestions unreviewable.\"\nAnd it's the same point. He is talking\nthere about a retrospective action for damages. The\nrule that we are seeking here is no different than what\nthen-Justice Rehnquist said in Roper.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do we take this case on\nthe premise that you would have objected if a judgment\nhad been entered in your favor for the full amount, plus\nattorneys' fees?\nMR. KATYAL: I think you should. And this\nis in response to what Justice Alito had said in the\nfirst part of the argument. It is not as if we didn't\nask for a hearing. Absolutely, we asked for a fairness\nhearing at Joint Appendix page 110 in the district court\nand then, again, at the Third Circuit.\nAnd what we asked for specifically was\nreview of the contours of the offer. This is at Joint\nAppendix page 110. We said, quote -- excuse me, 111 -\n\"There has been no review and/or approval by this Court\nof defendant's offer of judgment to the plaintiff,\" and\nfor that reason, we said, quote, \"Dismissal is\ninappropriate at this early procedural juncture.\"\nSo this case comes to the Court having asked\nthat particular question about the contours of the\noffer. We think that an offer that never gave\nMs. Symczyk anything is one that didn't make her whole,\nand for that -\nJUSTICE ALITO: If I were to -- I'm sorry.\nIf I were to think that the individual plaintiff's claim\nisn't moot until a judgment is entered into her favor,\nbut that -- but that -- that issue, was not preserved,\ncan you give me an analog that I should think about,\nwith respect to the second question?\nMR. KATYAL: Sure.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Should I -- yes.\nMR. KATYAL: I think that the best way to\nthink about it is the -- the category of cases from\nGeraghty, Gerstein, and Swisher suggest that if the -\nif you wanted to hold that offer against us, that you\nwould then say, as Judge Sirica did, the relation-back\ndoctrine looks similar enough to the 216(b) context in\nthis specific area because, otherwise, the 216(b)\ncollective actions won't work the way Congress intended\nthem to work.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, should I assume that\nthis is the same -- the case would then be the same as\nif a default judgment had been entered in your favor for\nthat amount?\nMR. KATYAL: I think -- well, it's hard to\nknow how you'd hold that offer against us, in that -\nand the way in which you did so, I think, informs that\nsecond question. And that's part of the reason why we\nthink it is a predicate question.\nI suppose that, yes, you could say -- one\npath available is to say it is a default judgment now\nthat is imposed on us, along the lines of the Second\nCircuit decision; and, if so, then, as the Solicitor\nGeneral says, at pages 15 to 18, the then-appropriate\ncourse would have been for the district court to\nevaluate whether other people could opt into the class\nusing the procedures of Hoffman-LaRoche.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- to get the point -\nthe Court had to evaluate whether the offer actually met\nyour personal damages claim, too.\nMR. KATYAL: Oh, absolutely, Justice\nSotomayor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And what you're\nsaying -\nMR. KATYAL: We were proceeding on the\nhypothetical.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- in those pages is the\nCourt didn't even do that.\nMR. KATYAL: Exactly. I was proceeding on\nthe hypothetical that -- that, for one reason or\nanother, the Court can't reach that question.\nAnd we think Lebron absolutely permits this\nCourt to do so. And we think it's prudent for this\nCourt to reach that question first because you can\nsidestep and avoid what is, undoubtedly, a very\ndifficult constitutional question about exceptions to\nArticle III mootness and the relation-back doctrine.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nWe'll hear from Mr. Yang now.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY A. YANG,\nFOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING RESPONDENT\nMR. YANG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nRespondent has never been compensated for\nher individual damage claim, nor has she received a\ncourt judgment favorably adjudicating that claim. It\nfollows that her individual claim remains live, as does\nthis collective action.\nMore generally, a settlement offer does not\nmoot a claim, if it is not accepted. Individual freedom\nof contract is basic to our legal system, and mutual\nassent is always a necessary element for any settlement.\nRule 68 embodies those principles.\nJUSTICE BREYER: How does that differ from\nan employee who says that he is annoyed for a variety of\nreasons at the employer, and he sues the employer for\nhis pay -- for his pay for the month of October. The\nemployer says, He got his pay, I -- I sent him the\ncheck, I mean, he gets it every month. And he says,\nyes, but I didn't cash the check.\nIs there a case for controversy? He can go\nsue for his paycheck that he didn't cash?\nMR. YANG: Well, if you're -- you're -- I'm\nnot sure what the injury would be in that case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So why is it any\ndifferent when the -- the defendant -- employer says,\nhere's the check.\nMR. YANG: Well, there's a difference -\nJUSTICE BREYER: And he says, oh, I didn't\ncash it.\nMR. YANG: This -- this I think speaks\nsomewhat to Justice Scalia's point earlier on, which is\nthere -- there are three elements to Article III\nstanding, and it also carries through a bit to mootness.\nOne is an injury in fact. When we are\ntalking about retrospective claims, there is a past\ninjury. If you get a payment or court redress, it\ndoesn't eliminate the injury. The injury continues to\nexist. Redressability -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, we have a case if the\nemployer, for some reason -- a mistake in bookkeeping or\nsomething -- didn't send the check on time, so it\narrived 3 days late. And he says, ha, I'm not cashing\nthe check; now, I can sue him. Right? That's your\ntheory.\nMR. YANG: Well, if there is a violation of\nthe Fair Labor Standards Act -- and I'm not sure that\nthat would be a violation of the Fair Labor Standards\nAct -\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. He -- he -- it's a\ncontract -- you know. He -- he is paid every month, the\nend of the month.\nMR. YANG: Well, if there is a breach of a\ncontract, that is an injury. And it is a past -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Even though the -- the\nemployer gave him the paycheck. He just didn't cash it,\nplus the damage is for the 3 days.\nMR. YANG: If I can just finish, I think it\nis a past injury. It is traceable to the defendant, and\nit is redressable because the requested relief would\nredress it. There may well be a defense on the merits.\nIt may well be that there was payment. It could -\nthere could be accord and satisfaction -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm not sure I\nunderstand. You think there is a live case, not if he\ndoesn't cash it, but I guess, as Justice Breyer was\nasking, if it's a day late? You -- you said, well,\nthere was a past injury, it was a day late, it -- it -\nyou know, could be redressed, by telling him what? Pay\nhim again? Or -\nMR. YANG: Well, no. I -- I guess there is\na few questions. If they -- if the defendant had paid\nthe plaintiff, then you would have what is traditionally\nknown as -- and it's accepted -- you would have accord\nand satisfaction. It is an affirmative defense in\nRule 8(c).\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you would also\nhave what's usually known as no injury.\nMR. YANG: Well, again, I think it's\nimportant to distinguish between injury and something\nthat redresses an injury. Redress of an injury, like a\ncourt redress, which is the only question that's\nrelevant in Article III, whether the requested relief\nfrom the court would redress the injury.\nNow -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think a court\nhas to go through the whole process of a trial if the\ncheck is a day late and the employer says, I'm sorry,\nhere's -- you know, whatever the interest is on the\ncheck?\nMR. YANG: No, certainly not. And this is\nwhat -- what we say is the right approach, although it's\nnot a question of mootness, if an employer comes in and\nthrows up their hands in court and says, it's not worth\nit, I want to forfeit, I want to just pay the\njudgment -- and -- and by the way, this would not have\nthe issue preclusive effect, notwithstanding my friend's\nstatement earlier -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. Could\nyou directly answer my question about -\nMR. YANG: The court can simply enter\njudgment. It can simply enter judgment to -- to stop\npointless litigation. That's the normal course, is\nthat, if there is a past injury, it's redressable, but\nthe defendant comes in and either says accord and\nsatisfaction and says that there is no merits claim -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.\nMR. YANG: -- or I just give up on the\nmerits -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Or the plaintiff\nsays no -- no standing.\nMR. YANG: Well, no. Again, I -- I don't\nthink it's a question of standing because there is two\nissues going on. Standing has to exist at the beginning\nof the suit. It's assessed at the date that the\ncomplaint is filed.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And -- and, as we've\nsaid, at every stage of the litigation.\nMR. YANG: Right. That's the -- the\nmootness inquiry, then. It has to continue to persist\nthroughout the litigation.\nNow, the fact that you have had some redress\nof some sort in the form of a private contract, that\ndoesn't eliminate the past injury, nor does it mean that\nthe court could not, if the court were to give\nadditional damages relief -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if you're due -\nif you're due $100 from your employer, it's a day late,\nhe gives you $100, and he says, well, here's another\ndollar for interest, that, as you said, doesn't\neliminate the past injury?\nMR. YANG: It doesn't eliminate the injury.\nIt might be compensation for the injury. The injury\nwould -- once a past injury occurs, it's there.\nIt's unlike a prospective injury, which can be stopped.\nWhen you -- when you seek injunctive relief, you need\nhave to have an imminent on ongoing injury. If the\ndefendant stops, that can eliminate the injury, and then\nyou go into questions of voluntary cessation. But with\nrespect to past injury, it's quite different.\nNow, I think the possibility of courts\nwasting their time on this cases is quite small. There\nis all kinds of incentives for a plaintiff not to bring\nthese suits. There is questions of vexatious\nlitigation. But that's not what we have here. We have,\nin the Fair Labor Standards Act, a judgment by Congress\nthat employees are to have a right in the -- to -- to go\nforward in the collective form.\nAnd as Justice Kennedy's opinion for the\nCourt in Hoffman-LaRoche recognizes, Section 216 imposes\nupon district courts a managerial responsibility to join\nplaintiffs in an orderly way. And the -- the collective\naction ties in with other aspects of the Fair Labor\nStandards Act. The action is designed, as\nHoffman-LaRoche says, to serve the important function of\npreventing violations.\nIt also says that the -- the collective\naction is to be enforced to the full extent of its\nterms. These are judgments that Congress made because\nthey were trying to protect particularly vulnerable\nemployees in our society. These are nonunionized,\ngenerally, low-wage employees without bargaining power.\nCongress created liquidated damages in order to provide\na strong deterrent for employers to comply with the law.\nAnd also -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Yang, would -- would\nyou continue with what you started speaking to, issue\npreclusion, because I'm -- I'm also -- I think it's\nquestionable whether there would be issue preclusion on\nthe basis of a judgment issued with the concession of\nthe defendant.\nMR. YANG: Yeah. This -- this is page 14,\nfootnote 2 of our brief. Issue -- there might be claim\npreclusion, in that the defendant would not be able to\nbring other claims associated, res -- traditional res\njudicata.\nBut for a judgment entered by a concession,\nthe actual issue is not litigated and necessary to the\njudgment. And so it's well established that that would\nnot serve any issue preclusive effect. And in fact, I\nthink, if it did, it would put a chill on the ability of\npeople to settle their disputes through offers of\njudgment.\nSo our solution that we provide the Court,\nwe think, is the only solution that provides a practical\nway to accommodate the very important interests that are\nat issue in this case.\nOne, it recognizes the district court's\ndiscretion to resolve the case in a sensible way, in\norder to -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So, Mr. Yang, do you think\nit would be -- I -- I mean, I take the point completely\nthat judgment was rendered against the wrong party here.\nBut if the judgment had been rendered against\nMs. Symczyk -- for Ms. Symczyk, but -- but the court had\ndone so prior to looking at the whole class question -\nMR. YANG: Right.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: -- do you think that that\nwould be an abuse of the court's discretion? Do you\nthink that the court has to look at the class question\nbefore rendering judgment for an individual plaintiff?\nMR. YANG: In the context of a collective\naction, yes, because of the Congressional policy that\ngives plaintiffs a right to proceed collectively.\nThat said, the collective process does not\nhave to be a burdensome one. There are certain small\nclaims, idiosyncratic claims, that a court can simply\nlook at the -- the allegations and say, there are not\ngoing to be similarly situated people here.\nBut when we have an allegation like we have\nhere, which there is a widespread policy of deducting 30\nminutes a day, notwithstanding the employer's knowledge\nthat the employers -- employees are working through that\nlunch break, there is every reason to think that there\nis a substantial body of -- of employees similarly\nsituated.\nAnd it would be an abuse of discretion for\nthe Court not to proceed at least down that road,\nprovide some discovery, facilitate class notice -- as\nthe Court in Hoffman-LaRoche recognizes is the\nappropriate thing to do under Section 216 -- and at the\nend of that process, which could be short for some\ncases, a little longer for some, should be, of course,\nalways exercised in the Court's sound discretion.\nAt the end of the case, if there are more\nplaintiffs who opt in, then it proceeds as a collective\naction. If it remains the single plaintiff, the Court\nmight decide to enter judgment.\nNow, we don't think that follows, Justice\nSotomayor, from Rule 68. It simply follows from the\nfact that the defendant is willing to just to pay, to\ngive up. It won't have issue-preclusive effect, it\nresolves the dispute, judgment in the amount of $7,500,\nattorneys' fees, costs.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But what you're talking\nabout is imputing into this process, a fairness hearing,\nessentially, to see, by the district court, to determine\nwhether this is a quirky case where you entered a\njudgment and you don't need collective action or whether\nor not this is a genuine case that requires joining\nplaintiffs.\nMR. YANG: May I answer the question,\nMr. Chief Justice?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Certainly.\nMR. YANG: I don't think it's a fairness\nhearing. I think what it does is -- it -- it's a\nquestion about whether there are people similarly\nsituated. And if there are plaintiffs similarly\nsituated, the case should proceed. If, at that point,\nthe defendant wants to pay everyone, it certainly could\ndo so.\nBut my guess is, usually, the -- the claims\nwould be litigated on the merits of that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. YANG: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Mann, you have\nfour minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD MANN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. MANN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nI think the most useful thing to do is to\naddress the point that Justice Breyer has raised several\ntimes because I think it's important to discuss the\nrelationship between what I would call the statutory\nfacts and the constitutional questions that they might\nraise. And so I do think it's fair, in a sense, to\nthink about this as a statutory case.\nWhen a plaintiff files suit in a Federal\ncourt, often, the cause of action rests on a statute\nthat Congress has adopted. Those statutes have a lot of\nattributes that Congress can control to make it easier\nor harder for a defendant to make an offer of complete\nrelief.\nThey can provide for mandatory seeking of\nattorneys' fees, as this one does. They can alter the\nrules for shifting costs, as perhaps the Fair Debt\nCollection Practices Act does from last month. They can\nprovide for injunctive or declaratory relief, which\nmakes it basically impossible.\nBut Congress gets to decide, when they write\na statute, whether they want to make it a statute for\nwhich it -\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. That's true.\nAnd so what we would be reading into this statute is a\nrelation-back doctrine, which happens every day of the\nweek in class action cases and has historical analogies.\nSo I understand the difference you're\npointing to, but why not read that in? It would be\nfair, and it would get the job done, that Congress sets\nup in the statute. That's the argument the other way.\nMR. MANN: Well, that leads me to the second\npoint I wanted to make, which is exactly what is the\nconstitutional problem. And I think the way to get to\nit is when my colleague, Mr. Katyal, refers to the worst\nthat happens, well, the worst that happens, I think\nit's -- it's important to understand what the worst\nthing is that happens.\nThe worst thing is -- that happens is the\ncase is on the docket of the Federal district judge, and\nthere is no plaintiff with an interest, and the\nprocedure in the district court is we should spend some\ntime, have some discovery, look around to see if we can\nfind another plaintiff.\nAnd so I think that that's a different\nproblem from how the district court should decide the\norder of hearing -- of deciding motions. If the problem\nis -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Mann, if this is -\nif what Mr. Yang just told us is so, then there would be\nno issue preclusion because there has been no -- been no\nadjudication of anything. Then it seems to me that this\ncase falls into a classic exception to mootness, which\nis defendant's voluntary cessation doesn't moot a\ncontroversy. And this controversy is capable of\nrepetition yet evasive review because every time -- so\nthe plaintiff's got this judgment, not preclusive.\nThe employer continues in the old ways. The\nplaintiff sues again. This seems to me to fit exactly\ninto that category of cases. If there is no issue\npreclusion, defendant doesn't have to stop the practice,\ncan continue the practice, and then every time there is\na suit say, okay, we'll pay the judgment.\nMR. MANN: So I spoke unartfully before.\nObviously, there is a difference between claim\npreclusion and issue preclusion. And what I was\nattempting to say, unartfully, I will agree, was the\nextent of preclusion will depend on the issues that are\nactually litigated in the proceeding.\nAnd so I don't -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there is nothing\nlitigated when you have -\nMR. MANN: Claim preclusion is going to\napply because there's a judgment by -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Claim preclusion, but the\nclaim is, for this period of time, I wasn't given the\ncompensation. That's the claim.\nMR. MANN: But it is -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And then there is another\nperiod of time, and there is no issue preclusion.\nMR. MANN: But in this particular case,\nthere's no further dispute likely to occur between these\nparties. These -- she no longer works for us. There is\nno reason to think she is going to work for us again.\nThe Court has extended the \"capable of\nrepetition, yet evading review\" to class actions in\nthree cases: Gerstein, Riverside, and Swisher. In -\nbut in those cases, what happened was the plaintiff\nsought prospective injunctive relief. The case became\nmoot.\nIf the Court has held that those cases were\noutside of Article III, the result would have been that\nthe defendant could have been -- could have been\nengaging in the conduct that allegedly violated Federal\nlaw and would never have had to change.\nIn this case, what happened -- in this case\nand in the cases like this, what happens is someone\nseeks purely prospective -- retrospective relief for\nsomething, an injury that is complete. Except for their\nattorneys, she would have received complete relief. We\ndidn't engage in our conduct any longer.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
