CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument
first this morning in Case 10-1016, Coleman v. The Court
of Appeals of Maryland.
Mr. Foreman.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL L. FOREMAN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FOREMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
The propriety of any section 5 legislation
is judged by in reference to the historical perspective
that it reflects, and that historical perspective is
very clear in -- and it's set very clearly by Congress
and by this Court. It -- it is an unfortunate, long
history of State-sponsored gender discrimination. And
those -- that discrimination embodies gender-based
stereotypes that took a very firm hold in the employment
area, where women had difficulty obtaining employment
and holding employment. And this Court in a litany of
cases recognized these gender-based stereotypes as -- as
an improper assumption about women's abilities.
In Frontiero v. Richardson, it rejected this
issue that women's mission were to be women -- to be
wives and mothers; Stanton v. Stanton, that women were
to be the homemaker and men the breadwinner, and --
JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Foreman, I guess
the question in this case is what this particular
statutory provision has to do with gender discrimination
and the history of gender discrimination, whether
Congress was aiming to eradicate gender discrimination
through this provision or whether it was trying to do
something else entirely.
MR. FOREMAN: And it was directly attempting
to address these gender-based stereotypes in a couple
different ways as a practical matter. At that time,
when an employer saw a woman, they didn't necessarily
just see a worker. They saw a person that could become
pregnant, and worked on these gender-based stereotypes,
that that woman would either become pregnant, would be
disabled because of pregnancy-related disabilities but,
in any event, was a least -- least attractive employee.
And the Family and Medical Leave Act
addresses that specifically in its purposes section. It
specifically says that is intended to promote the equal
opportunity for women and men pursuant to the Equal
Protection Clause.
But more specific to the self-care
provision, Congress made it very clear what they were
attempting to do. If you move to the "findings"
section, first, in finding number 6, they address --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where -- where are
you reading from, counsel?
MR. FOREMAN: I am reading from Appendix A
to the brief, and it is -- that employment standards
that apply to one gender only have a serious potential
for encouraging employers to discriminate against
employees and applicants of employment who are of that
gender.
That's the negative inference argument that
we make in our brief. But even more to the point, if
you move to the purpose sections at appendix 2,
page appendix 2, it specifically is intended to minimize
the potential for employment discrimination on the basis
of sex by ensuring generally that leave is available for
eligible medical reasons, including maternity-related
disabilities and for compelling family reasons, and to
ensure equal protection under the law.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, following up on
Justice Kagan's question, I have -- I have difficulty
seeing how providing 12 weeks of leave for self-care for
both men and women affects the incentive of an employer
who we will assume has an inclination to discriminate
against women based on the possibility that a woman
applicant for employment may become pregnant. I just
don't see how that would affect the incentives of -- of
an employer in that situation.
MR. FOREMAN: The rationale of Congress at
that point was that they could have addressed this issue
several different ways. They -- and they passed (A),
(B), and (C) -- the birth of the child, the adoption of
the child, and the Family and Medical Leave Act --
against -- again, addressing gender-based stereotypes.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, (A) is not at issue,
right?
Okay. So, we're just dealing with (D),
which concerns a serious health condition. So, you have
an employer who is willing to discriminate on the basis
of gender. The employer has two applicants for
employment, a man and a woman, and the employer says,
well, if I hire the man, he might take 12 weeks of leave
for a serious medical condition, and if I hire the
woman, she might take 12 weeks of leave for a serious
medical condition which might be something that either
men or women could get, or it also could be a sickness
related to pregnancy.
So, there still is -- there still would be
an incentive for this hypothetical employer to
discriminate against the woman.
MR. FOREMAN: But one of the things Congress
tried to do is to take that incentive away.
JUSTICE ALITO: How does it do that? That's
what I'm -- I understand that, and it's a worthy
objective. I just don't understand how giving both men
and women 12 weeks of leave for self-care affects the
incentive.
MR. FOREMAN: It affects the incentive by
providing -- it becomes the equal opportunity employer.
It evens the -- the ground. And the way it would do it
is an employer, if you just have (A) through (C), can
look at an employee and, based upon gender stereotypes,
would make the assumption that the women, because of
historically the role they were required to play, would
be taking all the leave under (A) and (B) and (C). And
so, why would I even hire that woman in the first place?
JUSTICE KAGAN: But women don't get sick
less often than men, do they?
MR. FOREMAN: No, absolutely.
JUSTICE KAGAN: So, you're just adding
something to both sides of the balance, and it doesn't
affect the employer's incentive. The employer still --
the -- the hypothetical discriminatory employer would
still say, well, women are going to be caregivers more
often; so, I'm -- I'm going to not hire that person.
MR. FOREMAN: But under (A), (B), and (C)
after the Family and Medical Leave, an employer would
look and say both men can take these now. And I think
we need to step back --
JUSTICE KAGAN: And that's why (A), (B), and
(C) go to the problem, but what does (D) have to do with
it? If you assume that both men and women get sick at
an approximately equal rate -- maybe you don't assume
that -- but if you do, it doesn't seem to factor into
the employer's incentives in any way.
MR. FOREMAN: There is nothing in the record
that demonstrates that there's a differential rate
between the self-care rates for men and women. But the
perception was that women, because of pregnancy, because
of pregnancy-related disabilities, would in fact take
more leave. And so that I would look at a woman as an
employer and say she will become pregnant, she will take
leave, she will be disabled. However, with (D) now, but
the man can take a -- a disability leave on the same
basis.
And the hope of Congress was not that it
would happen immediately, but by the -- what would
happen is, with the application of family and medical
leave, at some point men would be taking (A), (B), and
(C), and, in fact, women and men would be taking family
and medical self-care leave. I just --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Foreman, I think
everyone has been trying to get you to focus on the
health care sickness leave alone, and in the -- in the
portions of the Act that this Court upheld, the Congress
said there is this close association of women with
children; we think it's going to be good for everybody
if fathers recognize their responsibility for elderly
parents, sick children, sick spouse. So, we -- we can
see the rationale, trying to change the stereotype,
trying to open up caregiving for both sexes.
But you have answered the question that
women and men get sick; there's no -- there's no
disproportion. So, how do you tie that, just -- just
that part of the Act, where there -- there isn't the
obvious association of women with childbearing? So, we
extend the benefit to men so they'll be associated with
child care. There isn't that same link here, is there?
MR. FOREMAN: I think it is the same linkage
trying to address -- it's addressing a difference there,
but it's addressing the linkage that women will in fact
take pregnancy-based leave or pregnancy-based
disabilities and, therefore, are less attractive, less
-- employees, and that's what self-care was intended to
do.
JUSTICE KAGAN: So, you're saying -- let me
just make sure I understand. You're saying that the --
that Congress is thinking that an employer actually does
think that women take more sick leave because women get
pregnant. And just as Congress was thinking about the
employer who thought women are going to take more family
leave, you think Congress was thinking about the
employer who thinks women are also going to take more
sick leave because of pregnancy?
MR. FOREMAN: Absolutely, Your Honor. And
in response to Justice Alito's question -- and I'm sorry
if I gave a confusing response. There are two separate
ways of addressing that.
You can look at self-care as a stand-alone
provision, without (A), (B), and (C). Congress passed
just self-care. In that case it would be responding to
exactly that type of gender stereotype, and 12 weeks
would be a congruent and proportional response.
The other way to look at it is that's not
the way Congress passed the bill. They passed it as a
comprehensive response with (A), (B), and (C), and hence
(D) then becomes a bit of an equalizer to take away this
negative incentive that only women would take (A), (B),
and (C).
So, there's two separate ways that this
Court can get to the same conclusion, and that
conclusion is that this is a congruent and proportional
response to gender-based discrimination.
JUSTICE KAGAN: Do you have any evidence
that Congress in fact was thinking about either of these
two things? Is there anything in the record that
suggests either of those two theories?
MR. FOREMAN: Yes, there -- there is, Your
Honor, and let me -- let me take the negative inference
first, because I think looking at the statute as a
comprehensive makes sense -- is it was introduced -- and
I'm reading from page 43. It's referenced on page 43 of
our brief, that starting in 1987, National Women's
Political Caucus testified, quote: "My primary purpose
is to stress that parental and medical leave are
inseparable. In the words of the old song, 'You can't
have one without the other.'"
And the point she then later on to explain
was parental leave without medical leave would encourage
discrimination against women of child-bearing age, who
constitute approximately 73 percent of all women in the
workforce. Employers would tend to hire men, who are
much less likely to make this claim.
Fast forward to 1993 at the time of the
passage of -- and this would be on page 42 of our merits
brief: "A law providing special protection to women or
any defined group, in addition to being inequitable,
runs the risk of causing discrimination." The FML
addresses this by addressing the needs of all workers,
avoids this risk. The FMLA is based on the guarantees
of equal protection. So, it addresses that aspect of --
it addresses that aspect.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counselor, I -- I take
your argument, but if you look at the legislative
record, the reports, the findings, et cetera, and the
statements repeatedly by many congresspeople, there
appears to be -- have been a dual motive for this
provision. They were, in fact, engaged in the question
of discrimination against pregnant women. That was
recognized in Hibbs, and that's clear.
But with respect to this particular
provision, they were also concerned about economic
effect that -- that happened to everyone, men and women,
who became disabled. And so, they appear to have had
dual motivation. Part of the bill was gender-related;
part of the bill seemed to be disability-related.
What do -- how do we judge that kind of
bill, where Congress may have been expanding the
benefits it's giving to people, not solely because of
gender discrimination, but because of this desire to
address disability discrimination?
MR. FOREMAN: Justice Sotomayor, I -- I
think the way you judge it is rely on what Congress's
expressed findings and provisions are. And to the
extent this Court makes a determination that the FMLA is
responsive to gender-based discrimination, then how
Congress chose to address that is congruent and
proportional.
The fact that Congress may also have had
other motives, that there was a concern with -- with
families and that families are -- benefit should not be
used to undermine the fact that Congress indeed was
acting pursuant to one of its broadest powers, section 5
of the Fourteenth Amendment, and, therefore, that their
-- their considered judgment is a congruent and
proportional response.
Part of -- part of the findings is clearly
reflective of a fact that this covered both governmental
employers and private industry. So, there was reference
to Commerce Clause type of -- of analysis, which my
colleagues raised repeatedly in their brief. But the
court -- the Congress needed to do that because they
were regulating private employment but, at the same
time, recognized to the extent that we are -- are going
to regulate State-based conduct.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, with respect to the
Commerce Clause, could I ask you this: If we were to
disagree with you on the Fourteenth Amendment and hold
that it -- that Congress didn't validly abrogate State
sovereign immunity with respect to subsection (D), would
your client still be able to seek reinstatement or other
injunctive relief?
MR. FOREMAN: Justice Alito, I think what
you're -- and you'll clearly correct me if I am wrong,
but I think what you are responding to, is there an Ex
parte Young action here that would be made -- able to be
made consistent with the Commerce Clause, under the
Commerce Clause?
And the answer is -- and I know that both
Justice Kennedy and Justice Rehnquist, I think, in one
of his dissents, pointed out in the Family and Medical
Leave Act that the employee may not be left out in the
dark because there is an Ex parte Young claim.
A couple points on that --
JUSTICE ALITO: Here the district court
completely dismissed your FMLA claim, not just insofar
as you sought damages. I -- I think you also sought
reinstatement and other equitable relief, but the
district court dismissed it completely.
MR. FOREMAN: That's right.
JUSTICE ALITO: But you're not contesting
that, are you?
MR. FOREMAN: We're not contesting it
consistent with any Ex parte Young claim. What the
district court did was say the claim is totally
dismissed based upon Eleventh Amendment immunity.
But if I could try to respond to your
question more specifically, this Court has never as a
Court held that Ex parte Young type of action is
available in this type of claim. Assuming that it --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Because this is for money
damages.
MR. FOREMAN: Pardon?
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Because this is for money
damages. Ex parte Young was just injunctive relief.
The Eleventh Amendment primarily protects the treasuries
of the State against money damages.
MR. FOREMAN: Correct.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's not Ex parte Young.
MR. FOREMAN: Correct. But as -- as you
pointed out in your dissent in Hibbs, that Ex parte
Young may be available, but one of the concerns we have
is, again, that the Court -- as a majority, the Court
has never held that. I believe that is in fact the
correct interpretation of the law, that it would be
available for injunctive relief. However, the Court has
never defined the parameters of what an Ex parte Young
action really gives a plaintiff, and that becomes very
important in this case.
JUSTICE ALITO: You said "in this case."
That's basically what I'm asking. If we were to
disagree with you on the Fourteenth Amendment, are you
asking us simply -- would we then simply affirm the
Fourth Circuit? Or would we have to -- would we have to
make some accommodation for the possibility that the
dismissal of your claim, insofar as you sought
injunctive relief, may have been improper?
MR. FOREMAN: I think you would have to make
that accommodation, but, with respect, Your Honor, I
think that would be an incorrect approach. And here's
-- here's the reason why in Ex parte Young, a perfect
example --
JUSTICE ALITO: I am really trying to be a
little bit helpful to you. And I --
(Laughter.)
MR. FOREMAN: And apparently I missed that,
and I apologize.
JUSTICE ALITO: Okay.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What relief did you ask
for? Damages, we know, and the -- you have to overcome
the Eleventh Amendment. Injunctive relief, you don't,
but did you ask for it?
MR. FOREMAN: In the complaint itself, it
does not ask for injunctive relief pursuant to the
Family and Medical Leave Act.
JUSTICE ALITO: I thought you --
MR. FOREMAN: There were combined claims --
JUSTICE ALITO: I thought you did, but maybe
I'm reading your complaint more generously than you read
it yourself.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, you --
JUSTICE KAGAN: I'd go with Justice Alito
here.
MR. FOREMAN: If that's your reading of it,
we will certainly accept your reading.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE GINSBURG: You must have asked for
such other and further relief.
MR. FOREMAN: But, again, back to the Ex
parte Young, in the case Nelson v. The University of
Tennessee -- Texas, a -- the case that dealt with --
exactly with this issue of abrogation of Eleventh
Amendment immunity, and they found that there was valid
abrogation of Eleventh Amendment immunity, the State of
Texas -- then the court was required to address the Ex
parte Young issue. And the State of Texas argued that
reinstatement is not an appropriate remedy under Ex
parte Young and that -- while the Fifth Circuit
ultimately rejected that, that is an argument that
employees would have to face: What are the parameters
of Ex parte Young? And, more importantly, that is not
the remedy that Congress in their considered judgment
believed was the appropriate remedy to address
gender-based discrimination.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, Congress must have
thought that giving the woman back her job was an
important part. I mean, I thought the whole idea is she
wasn't supposed to be fired. So, I think that the --
the relief, the non-monetary relief, is certainly
important.
MR. FOREMAN: It is extremely important, but
Congress did not stop there. Congress decided it needed
to take one step further and there needed to be monetary
relief. And I think Mr. Coleman's case illustrates
exactly why.
Here Mr. Coleman exercised his rights that
were supposedly guaranteed him under the Family and
Medical Leave Act, and indeed under a State law, and the
State of Maryland fired him, and he is out of work. And
what is the disincentive for the State to not do the
same thing the next time if the only thing that you can
get is possibly injunctive relief prohibiting them from
doing that in the future and maybe reinstatement 2 or 3
years down the line? Employees at that point cannot put
their lives on hold. They have a duty to go out and try
to mitigate, try to find another job.
What's an employer to do? And Congress said
there needs to be more. We passed Title VII to try to
address gender-based discrimination, the Pregnancy
Discrimination Act, but there were still voids. And the
Family and Medical Leave Act attempts to fill those
voids, and one of those voids is try to provide a
monetary incentive so that the State of Maryland and
private employers will in fact comply with the law.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: When you -- when you --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I go -- I'm sorry.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: When you say you're
concerned about a disincentive to hire women, but the
Pregnancy Discrimination Act makes that unlawful. So,
if an employer decides I don't want to hire women of
child-bearing age, that is an out-and-out violation of
the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, isn't it?
MR. FOREMAN: That is, Your Honor, but the
Pregnancy Discrimination Act did not fill the other gap
which the Family and Medical --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you're relying on the
incentive -- the disincentive to hire women of
child-bearing age. The law protects the woman of child-
bearing age by saying, Employer, you can't refuse to
hire her, promote her, and all the rest because of
pregnancy.
MR. FOREMAN: It -- well, what the Pregnancy
Discrimination Act provided was that you needed to treat
pregnancy-related disabilities as you would other
short-term disabilities. So, if an employer decided not
to provide --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm just asking you
about -- your -- your argument rests on an employer
acting unlawfully, you see. He won't hire -- we have to
give them medical leave, to everyone, because otherwise
the employer won't hire women. And that's -- the
question I'm asking is, you are assuming that the
employer will break the law by refusing to hire women
that -- of child-bearing age?
MR. FOREMAN: I don't want to make that
assumption in my incentive argument. I was using Mr.
Coleman as an example of why Congress could have made a
determination that monetary relief would be appropriate
in the Family and Medical Leave Act.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I -- your argument to
a large extent depends -- or you say Congress did this
because they wanted to eliminate or at least reduce one
kind of discrimination against women in the job market.
MR. FOREMAN: Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And that -- that
discrimination was refusing to hire women of child-
bearing age. Well, they couldn't do it out and out
because that would be a violation of the law. So, is
Congress having in mind discrimination that is under --
under the radar screen, that it's going to go on even
though it's unlawful?
MR. FOREMAN: I -- I don't think that was
Congress's intent, and that that's not what was
reflected. I think, again, they were trying to address
it on two separate levels: one, the gender-based
discrimination, the gender stereotype that women simply
become less attractive; and in the broader statute, to
prevent the negative inference so that all -- that
ultimately where we would get in society is the ability
to take pregnancy-related leave, other leave, would not
be viewed as a negative inference running against women,
and, therefore, women ultimately would become a
nonissue.
And I see the light's on. So, if I could
reserve the balance of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Howard.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN B. HOWARD, JR.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. HOWARD: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
In order to affirm in this case, the Court
need go no further than to distinguish Hibbs, and we
think Hibbs is readily distinguishable. And I'd like to
highlight four principal --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Need go no further? I'm
sorry. I -- I didn't --
MR. HOWARD: I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg.
Need go no further than simply to distinguish Hibbs.
And we think there are at least four distinctions that
we'd like -- I'd like to highlight today. The first is
one that's -- Justice Kagan, your question goes to,
which is subsections (A), (B), and (C) are all related
in some fashion to women's roles with respect to work
and family. Subsection (D) really does not speak to
that purpose.
And I think my second sort of distinction I
would point to --
JUSTICE KAGAN: If I could just --
MR. HOWARD: Yes.
JUSTICE KAGAN: -- stop you there, Mr.
Howard, for a second, as I took from Mr. Foreman
something that I hadn't understood from his briefs --
maybe I just missed it -- which is that he's making a
kind of analogous argument, that, just as in the -- in
the prior provisions of the Act, employers thought of
women as caregivers and the response of Congress was to
provide a gender-neutral leave benefit that had both --
that both women and men were eligible for.
So here, employers think of women as needing
more medical leave because of pregnancy, and the
response of Congress is to provide gender-neutral sick
leave. So, what is your response to that argument?
MR. HOWARD: Congress, Justice Kagan, did
not I think take that stereotype or perception that Mr.
Foreman referred to into account. And I'd specifically
point the Court to page 21 of our brief, where we cite
some Bureau of Labor Statistics studies indicating that
men and women at the time took roughly the same amount
of sick leave. In fact, Mr. Foreman has conceded as
much. And that same study projects that men and women
will take roughly the same amount of time after the
enactment of the FMLA --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But there certainly
was -- there was certainly much conversation and
testimony that, whether they in fact took the same
amount of leave time or not, that women who were
pregnant or were perceived as capable of getting
pregnant were hired less frequently because,
subjectively, the employers thought that they were more
likely to take the time.
So, frankly, for years there was questions
about whether law firms were hiring young -- not hiring
young women because they feared they would leave in the
middle of a big case or something else. We all know
those stories. So, it is sort of common knowledge in
many ways, but there was plenty of testimony related to
that.
So, assume that that was Congress's
perception, because it was supported by the record or as
much of the record as Hibbs recognized as adequate.
Where does that leave your argument?
MR. HOWARD: Well, I would make a couple of
points in response to that, Justice Sotomayor. First,
the Pregnancy Discrimination Act was already in place.
And so, to the extent there were perceptions that
employers might discriminate based on pregnancy
disabilities, that would be unlawful under Title VII as
amended by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act.
And the fact that -- and you are quite right
that there is a fair amount of discussion in the
legislative record, although I think it's less of a
predominant theme than the concern for job security for
working families, but there certainly is discussion
about pregnancy discrimination and pregnancy disability
as a type of illness.
But we again would note that this is valid
Commerce Clause legislation. And so, to the extent that
kind of discrimination was occurring and leave was being
denied or women were suffering adverse consequences in
the workplace as a result of pregnancy discrimination,
they could enforce the 12 weeks through a Title VII
action.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: They couldn't -- the
Pregnancy Discrimination Act says that you have to treat
pregnancy like any other disability. So, if they're not
giving anybody any leave for anything, they don't have
to give any leave; not 12 weeks, not 1 day. And that's
what -- that's the gap that this legislation fills. It
says, yes, you do have to provide leave for women who
have disabling conditions, including pregnancy, but then
you have to give that to men as well. You can't reserve
that for the one sex. So, it was the gap in the
Pregnancy Discrimination Act that this -- this was
referring to.
MR. HOWARD: Yes, I agree, Justice Ginsburg,
but the gap that existed was the absence of a guaranteed
period of leave. In other words, it was the absence of
a substantive entitlement, and so -- to a certain amount
of leave. And, in effect, the gap that was being filled
served as prophylaxis for Title VII but not for
constitutional violations. Now --
JUSTICE ALITO: Assume for the sake of
argument that for the -- the applicants for particular
provisions -- particular positions, I should say --
where the applicants are typically of a certain age, men
tend to take less sick leave than women, because women
also take sick leave for pregnancy-related illnesses.
So, giving everybody 12 weeks eliminates the -- the
possibility that women -- women who will be -- want to
take additional -- will want to take more sick leave
will be fired because they exceed the amount of sick
leave allowed by the employer for everybody. Now, isn't
that connected to eliminating discrimination in
employment?
MR. HOWARD: Justice Alito, I think that one
could argue that that is connected with eliminating
pregnancy disability discrimination. It's also
connected to the purposes of (A), (B), and (C). I think
that the principal reason why employers do view
potential hires as -- when they're women, as likely to
take a lot of time off I think goes more to the family
caretaking provisions, and I think that's largely
reflected in the record.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I don't think -- I
have difficulty with the incentives argument either --
honestly, either as to (D) or as to (C). But I'm just
talking about the -- an argument based on consequences.
If an employer says you get 2 weeks of sick leave,
period; after that, if you can't come back, you're
fired -- that may -- at least for applicants within a
certain age range, that may have a much more severe or a
more severe impact on women than on men.
MR. HOWARD: Yes, Justice Alito, and I
think what --
JUSTICE ALITO: What would the answer to
that be, that that's not intentional discrimination?
MR. HOWARD: That would certainly be part of
the answer, and what I was going to say was that what
you are describing is a disproportionate impact on women
as a result of assumptions concerning pregnancy
disability. And, of course, if States were engaging in
this kind of conduct or if there were a disproportionate
impact, that would not state an equal protection
violation under Washington v. --
JUSTICE BREYER: Why are you separating four
things? I mean, I've heard, it seems to me, three
separate rationales. One, the easiest, is in (D)
itself. Sometimes a woman could have a miscarriage, and
of course she has to stay home. And that isn't covered
by (A), (B), or (C). So, we cover it in (D), you know.
And then we put the men in too because we don't want to
make this incentive just to not hire women. That's one.
The second one was the one Justice Ginsburg
brought up, that there is a gap in the pregnancy law
which won't work unless you have to give people some
medical leave. So, here it is, (D).
And the third one, which I think was related
to what Justice Alito just said, is when -- you have to
read it together to understand the third one. You get
12 weeks all together. All right? Now, that means,
once you put in (D), this Act will have less of a bad
effect. The bad effect of the Act is if you protect the
women, then the -- the employers say, well, we're not
going to hire women, perfect; we have to give them 12
leaves; we'd have to give the men -- terrible, it's a
terrible disincentive.
But then they worked out how to lessen the
disincentive. And the way you do that, you say 12 weeks
overall. And now look what happens. A woman wants to
take, say, 12 weeks to look after her family, and she
gets separately sick, 4 more weeks. But how many does
she get? Answer: Twelve, right? Twelve. You could
answer that part.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER: Now let's think of the man.
Let's think of the man. The man would like to look
after the family, say, for 6 weeks. And he gets sick 4
weeks. How many weeks have we got?
MR. HOWARD: Ten.
JUSTICE BREYER: Ten. Thank you.
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER: All right.
MR. HOWARD: I like these questions.
JUSTICE BREYER: So -- perfect.
So, now the employer is sitting -- and it
will work with other numbers. I don't rely on those
alone.
(Laughter.)
MR. HOWARD: Right.
JUSTICE BREYER: But now look what happens.
Without this Act, he's got a woman who is going to be
out of there -- I mean, with the Act -- see, unless we
put in four -- unless we put in the fourth part of it,
we have a woman who's gone for 12 weeks and a man who's
gone maybe for 6 but maybe for zero, okay? Maybe for 6.
With the Act, the woman's gone for 12, the man's gone
for 10. You see?
And so, the comparison there -- and it will
work with whatever numbers you want. The comparison
there is very different. And the comparison doesn't --
doesn't totally erase the problem with the woman, but it
may reduce it to a size where the Act itself will no
longer act as such a disincentive to hiring a woman.
We have three different rationales. All of
them are related to a serious problem, which is the
problem of discrimination against women because the
employers think they'll be home more. And so, you see
the conclusion I'm drawing? Yes, okay. So -- so, where
are we?
MR. HOWARD: Well, let me speak first to the
second one, the concern about the gap. The gap that is
filled by the 12 weeks is -- is a -- is to provide a
substantive entitlement. And when it permits a claim, a
damages claim enforceable against a State treasury, it
provides an entirely -- it requires a different
justification than simply to fill a gap with a
substantive entitlement. It becomes --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: The idea is it's part of
one package. I think that's what Justice Breyer was
getting at. But just suppose that Congress wanted to
improve conditions for the -- in the job market for
women, which I think it's fair to say was the motivating
force behind this Act, and they also wanted to protect
families so that sick children, sick spouses are
attended to.
Now, what leave policy would say, okay, to
do that, we will have leave when a spouse is sick, a
child is sick, a parent is sick, but not when the worker
herself is sick? Without -- it's all part of one
package which is designed to increase job security for
women and increase protection for their families. So, I
don't think you can slice off (D) from the other three.
MR. HOWARD: Justice Ginsburg, I think you
can separate (D) on the same analysis that this Court
applied in Tennessee v. Lane, in contrast to the Garrett
case. In Lane, of course, different sections of the
same Antidiscrimination Act required different
analysis -- analyses and reference to different parts of
the record. There was a single over-arching purpose, to
prevent discrimination against persons with
disabilities, but the operation and effect of the
particular claim requires a different analysis. As
Justice Stevens said, the Court is not required to
evaluate statutes as an undifferentiated whole.
JUSTICE BREYER: No, it doesn't have to, of
course. But the whole point of the question that I was
asking was, sure, what helps you by doing it separately
is it helps your case. But if we look at what Congress
was trying to do, they were trying to do it as a whole.
That's my point that I want you to answer. And they're
trying to do it as a whole because, no matter what
numbers I use, if I look at it without (D) -- is it (D)?
Yes, (D). If I look at it without (D), the ratio will
disfavor the woman. And if I look at it with (D),
suddenly the ratio from the point of view of the
employer of the disadvantage of hiring a woman over --
over hiring a man -- it goes way down. And that helps
women.
And that is why, I think -- reading this and
listening, a major reason why they put in (D) as part of
the other, because working with that 12-week limitation
and the whole rest of the statute, we now have a statute
that doesn't defeat itself. We now have a statute that
actually can achieve the end of leading employers to not
discriminate against women. Not perfectly, but there's
a big improvement.
And that's the -- that's the argument I'm
making. You have to read it as a whole to see that.
And that's what I -- I wonder if there's an answer to
that. Of course, I'm at the moment thinking there isn't
an answer to it, but I asked the question because I want
to hear what you say.
MR. HOWARD: Well, with respect to the
ratio, I think the premise of that point is that women
will take more leave for serious health conditions than
men. And I don't think that's borne out. And, you
know, Mr. Foreman has recognized as much. So, I don't
think the ratio really changes.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what if Congress had
added three additional subsections here and said that an
employer has to provide 12 weeks of unpaid leave so that
an employee can go to a health spa, 12 weeks of unpaid
leave for -- so that the employee can travel, 12 weeks
of unpaid leave so that the employee can take an
educational course?
Now, that -- those could be taken advantage
of by either men and women. It makes both men and women
increasingly unattractive as employees and, therefore,
reduces the any special disincentive that might have
been created by (A), (B), and (C).
Now, on that same logic, would those be --
would those be provisions that further the elimination
of discrimination based on gender?
MR. HOWARD: I -- I think even if one
accepted the premise, and we don't, that women take more
leave for health conditions, that would further dilute
the ratio, to have available all those types of leave.
Now, I thought, for example, one could imagine --
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I thought Justice Alito
was trying to help you.
JUSTICE BREYER: He was.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: He was.
JUSTICE BREYER: He was -- he's absolutely
right, and that's why this isn't a health spa thing,
(D). This is -- in fact, has two independent reasons,
that all -- the miscarriage reason and the Pregnancy Act
reason. And so, it isn't just saying go to a health
spa.
But I mean, I don't want to put arguments in
your mouth, which I just have, which you wouldn't like
there anyway, because -- but I would appreciate your
going on with this discussion in respect to what
Justice Alito and I have been talking about, and I'd be
interested in what you think.
MR. HOWARD: Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And I'm working from a
different proposition than you are in response to this
question. I don't think that the actual amount of time
that men and women take is relevant. The question is:
What is the employer's perception, and did Congress have
a valid basis, as Justice Kagan pointed out earlier, to
believe that employers thought women took more time?
MR. HOWARD: I -- I think that if -- even if
that were correct, and -- and I don't think it is
because I think the overwhelming themes in the
legislative record as a whole really were a concern for
working families, whether single-income, double-income,
and the concern that if a breadwinner falls ill, the
family's going to have severe financial insecurity. And
then there was also concern against discrimination
against persons with illness.
But I think that one thing I'd like to
emphasize is that your -- your suggestion, Justice
Sotomayor, and -- and really almost all of the
discussion here today, I think, explains why this is
good social policy. We support it. But I don't think
that we've really gotten anywhere near the necessary
predicate of unconstitutional State conduct when the
constitutional right is defined with some precision.
And I -- and I think one has to define this
right as -- as disability. And I think also the
protections that the Pregnancy Discrimination Act
already had in place, when added with the substantive --
to the substantive entitlement, as a matter of Commerce
Clause legislation, to this leave --
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if the State of
Maryland thinks this is good social policy, why is it
asserting its sovereign immunity?
MR. HOWARD: Well, that's a good question,
and I think we're here mainly on -- we need to defend
this on principle.
As, Justice Kennedy, you've pointed out in a
number of your opinions, the exercise of the section 5
power alters the Federal-State --
JUSTICE ALITO: But you can waive. Can't
you waive your -- your Eleventh Amendment immunity?
MR. HOWARD: We could, I believe.
That's this Court's --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you can
provide this, the kind of relief that's sought here,
without waiving immunity, right? It's a matter of
legislation.
MR. HOWARD: Yes, I think that's right, and
there --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could I just get
back to the discussion before about how (D) relates to
the others?
MR. HOWARD: Yes.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Who do you think
benefits most from subsection (E), men or women? That's
the one about armed services obligations at the time the
law was passed.
MR. HOWARD: I assume -- and I haven't
studied the history of that, but I assume that, just
based on the demographics of the military, it's like --
likely that there are more men in -- in service deployed
and that more women and wives benefit from that
provision.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Was that -- that wasn't
part of the original Act, was it?
MR. HOWARD: No, it was not.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And so, it was -- that
was -- the concern was a discrete concern for veterans.
MR. HOWARD: Yes, and --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: In that part.
MR. HOWARD: And we have not --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: It wasn't part of the
package that was the Family/Medical Leave Act.
MR. HOWARD: No. And we are not suggesting
that. We haven't raised that as a point in our briefs
or here today.
JUSTICE KAGAN: And, Mr. Howard, I -- I do
think that the point about the package is that if you
look at (D) alone, when you abstract it from everything
else, you have a good point, that it seems to be related
to economic security, which is not a section 5 issue;
that it seems to be related to discrimination against
sick people, which would also put us in a different
legal universe.
But when you look at (D) as passed at the
same moment on the basis of the same record as (A), (B),
and (C), with the overwhelming purpose of Congress being
to protect women from discrimination in the workplace
because of unfair stereotypical -- views about what
women do as workers, then (D) assumes a different kind
of aura.
And you can talk about a number of theories
for that, but I guess I would just ask for your -- your
reaction to that, that (D) is just part of a package
which was about telling employers: Get rid of your old
stereotypes. Don't act on your old stereotypes. Employ
women.
MR. HOWARD: Well, I -- I would respond in
part -- and I'm going to accept your proposition that I
should discuss these provisions as part of a single
package. But from the standpoint of States, subsection
(D) provides a separate claim, a separate basis to sue
States, and we think that claim is incongruent and
disproportionate to any conceivable unconstitutional
conduct that it might prohibit.
And I think this is borne out in the case
law. We've surveyed the 40 Federal cases that we could
find under subsection (D). Only two involve
pregnancy-related disabilities. Only one of them
alludes in passing to headaches arising from pregnancy
along with other stress-related conditions. But -- but
all of the others really have to do with men and women
benefiting from this leave for -- to care for a serious
health condition.
So, I -- I would really emphasize, in
response to your question, that one could look at it as
a package, but from the standpoint of States, it's a
separate and independent claim, and it's an
extraordinarily broad one. And it is not necessary, not
simply because Pregnancy Discrimination Act claims are
available, but, Justice Alito, there are Ex parte Young
claims available.
In -- in response to your question, in this
case at the Joint Appendix pages 3 to 12, the amended
complaint reveals that injunctive relief was sought,
albeit -- and on page 12 is the prayer for relief.
It's -- it's not clear whether that relief is sought
under Title VII or FMLA or both. But the reason why I
don't think -- the claim fails separate and apart from
any sovereign immunity argument. Of course, Ex parte
Young is not -- does not protect on that ground.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there's some focus in
the legislative history particularly on the -- the
family that has a single parent -- much more often a
woman, not a man -- and the devastating impact on that
family of the woman getting sick, the sole breadwinner
getting sick. So, that was certainly an -- a problem
for families with -- with only one breadwinner. And
Congress was focusing on those women and wanting to have
job security for them. That wasn't the only group of
women, but certainly that -- that affected the -- this
Act as it came out, didn't it?
MR. HOWARD: Yes. There is discussion in
the record of the disproportionate impact that you say.
But what -- what is left out -- well, it -- it is found
in other parts of the record that -- the relevant --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You're talking about the
legislative record here?
MR. HOWARD: Yes. The -- I'm sorry, yes.
The record of -- before Congress.
The relevant comparison, we think, is not --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that a closed record?
Is that a closed record, the way a record of a case is?
MR. HOWARD: I -- I am not sure I understand
the question.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I just find it a strange
expression to talk about "in the record" --
MR. HOWARD: Oh, I --
JUSTICE SCALIA: -- when what you're talking
about is legislative history.
MR. HOWARD: I misspoke. I do mean the
legislative history.
The -- the relevant comparison we think is
not between single-parent families who were
predominantly women, but between working families where
it could be two parents with a single income, man or
woman; it could be a family with two incomes, but
neither one can be lost. So -- and in any event, I
think we're talking now about a disproportionate impact,
which -- which would not state a -- an Equal Protection
violation.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: There's a question of how
Congress would do it. If they -- if they provided only
for the woman who's the single head of the family, then
that would be vulnerable under equal protection because
they didn't provide it for men.
MR. HOWARD: I think one would need to find,
as this Court's cases have emphasized, a widespread
pattern of unconstitutional conduct in the part of
States. And I think the circumstances, Justice
Ginsburg, that you've described, do not flow from
unconstitutional State action. They have their roots in
other socioeconomic causes. So --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, the leave is a remedy
for the problem. I think there's really not much
disagreement about the problem, that there is gender
discrimination in the job market.
MR. HOWARD: Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And then the question is
how do we remedy that?
MR. HOWARD: Well, I -- I don't think by
providing the -- the very sweeping remedy of (D), which
-- I see that my light's on. May I --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can finish your
sentence.
MR. HOWARD: We think that the remedy in (D)
may cover the types of concerns you referred to, but
I -- I would emphasize this is a disproportionate,
incongruent remedy. It subjects States to far more
suits for unrelated health conditions than the Eleventh
Amendment should permit.
Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Foreman, you have 4 minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL L. FOREMAN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FOREMAN: This is not responsive to
disability-based discrimination. The findings and the
purpose of the Family/Medical Leave Act make it clear
that it is responsive to gender-based discrimination.
Hibbs, in fact, found that the FMLA was in
response to gender-based discrimination. In making that
finding, they did not differentiate between the
different leave provisions. And, indeed, if you move to
Tennessee v. Lane, where Justice Rehnquist dissented,
drawing distinctions between disability-based
discrimination and sex-based discrimination, stated that
the task of identifying the constitutional right at
issue in the Family and Medical Leave Act was an "easy"
one. And that was his word, "easy." It's responsive to
gender-based discrimination.
Chief Justice Roberts, I think your question
about the military leave portion of the FMLA illustrates
that -- what Congress was doing here when they added
that almost 10 years later, they did not simply try to
pigeonhole it into -- this is section 5 legislation. In
the circuits at that time, there was considerable debate
as to whether that could be justified as proper
abrogation of immunity --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think it
would be --
MR. FOREMAN: I'm sorry.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think it
would be -- how would this case come out if we were
dealing with -- with subsection (E)? Do you think that
should be treated separately than the prior ones?
MR. FOREMAN: Yes, it should, because --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How?
MR. FOREMAN: -- it was passed pursuant to a
different constitutional power, and they provided in
fact a different remedy, recognizing that the -- the
Commerce Clause could not -- that Commerce Clause was
the appropriate way to deal with this, and they provided
a right of action by the United States in order to
provide damages.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If -- if we think
that you should look at these provisions separately,
where with respect to (D) -- and I'm looking at one of
our prior precedents -- has Congress unequivocally
declared its intent to abrogate sovereign immunity?
MR. FOREMAN: As to --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Unequivocally. Not
on the basis of implications from -- from how the other
provisions work. But if you do look at (D), is there
any place where Congress unequivocally declared its
intent to abrogate State sovereign immunity?
MR. FOREMAN: Well, I -- I think it -- yes,
Your Honor. It's in -- they provide that the State is
an employer for purposes of coverage of the Family and
Medical Leave Act. And if you go to 29 U.S.C. 2005,
where it says a public entity is covered by the Family
and Medical Leave Act, then -- that damages are
available. It -- it specifically includes "State."
In terms of my colleague's attempt to
distance this case from Hibbs, in all due respect, we
think that Hibbs did the heavy lifting here. It is the
same legislative purpose. It is the same constitutional
right. It is the same statutory scheme. As this
Court --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but your --
the answer you gave to my request depends entirely on a
conclusion that (D) is linked to (A), (B), and (C)
because, otherwise, you don't have the argument that
it's precisely relief with respect to a discrimination
under the Fourteenth Amendment.
MR. FOREMAN: But you do, Your Honor, and
that's the -- that's the discussions we had earlier,
that it's response to gender-based discrimination, the
stereotypes that pregnant women will take leave. And
so, we think (D) would stand alone. But as the
discussion today indicated, we think the appropriate way
is to treat this as a comprehensive whole responsive to
gender-based discrimination and do as you did in Hibbs,
find that it is a congruent, proportional response to
gender-based discrimination.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
