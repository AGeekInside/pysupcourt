        "content": "(11:09 a.m.)\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The Court will hear argument\nin Borden Ranch against the Corps of Engineers, No. 1243.\nMr. Bishop, you may proceed.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY S. BISHOP\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. BISHOP: Justice Stevens, and may it please\nthe Court:\nThe Army Corps of Engineers has a considerable\nnumber of hurdles to clear before it may regulate activity\nas a discharge under section 404. Congress specified in\nsection 404 that a permit is required for an activity that\nis an addition of a pollutant to a navigable water. That\naddition -- that added pollutant must be in the form of\nfill material or dredged material. And the addition must\ncome from a point source.\nThose statutory terms, we believe, have a core\nof plain meaning that excludes a farmer and rancher, deep\nplowing in a seasonal wetland, to prepare the soil for\ndeep-rooted crops. A deep plowing of that sort does not\nadd fill material or dredged material, and it doesn't\ninvolve a point source. And so it --\nQUESTION: Well, did -- did the district court\nhere find that the deep ripping tracked material into\nwetland areas from the adjacent uplands?\nMR. BISHOP: Only as to 3 of the 30-odd wetlands\nthat are involved.\nQUESTION: And as to those three?\nMR. BISHOP: And that -- that is not -- and that\nwas not the basis of the judgment below or of the penalty.\nIn the summary judgment ruling, the court found,\nas a matter of law, that plowing that moved material that\nwas already in the wetland -- and this is page 36 of the\npetition appendix -- was a violation. When it came to\nhearing evidence, for that reason the court did not focus\non the question of whether material was added to the\nwetland, as the Government says, from -- from outside.\nThe penalty in this case was based on 358 rips,\npasses, of the plow across the wetlands. The court did\nnot distinguish, in any of those cases, as between passes\nthat brought outside material into the wetland and those\nthat didn't. It simply was not a focus.\nThis was not the basis of the Government's\nargument below. This is entirely novel. It wasn't the\nbasis of the district court's decision in this case. It\nwasn't the basis of the court of appeals decision, if you\nlook at page 6 of the court of appeals decision.\nFurthermore, we believe that --\nQUESTION: Even so, if we agreed that that's a\nproper basis --\nMR. BISHOP: That would not be a basis on which\nyou could affirm here because that was not --\nQUESTION: But we'd have to -- we'd have to\nremand for that to be considered?\nMR. BISHOP: And we believe that a remand that\nfocused on that issue would show, first of all, that there\nwere on some occasions a minimal amount of material that\nwas moved into the edge of the wetland, just on some\noccasions, a minimal amount that would be well below the\namount of fill that would have fitted at that time with on\nthe -- under the nationwide permit so that no individual\npermit would be required in this case.\nIt would also show that the -- that the deep\nplow was raised on many occasions before the -- it moved\nfrom upland into wetland, and there's an example of that\ndescribed at page 71 of the petition appendix.\nAnd finally, on page 3 of our reply brief, we\ncite a California Ag Extension pamphlet which describes in\ngreat detail the nature of the soils and the plowing in\nthis area, and what it -- what it describes is that when a\ndeep plow passes through this sort of clay soil and it\nthen rains, that the -- that the -- the clay pan seals up\nagain and that because of the -- the nature of the clay\npan, there really is no homogenization during the plowing\nprocess between the soils above and below the pan.\nQUESTION: What -- what is the relevance of\nthat? That is, I'm thinking of --\nMR. BISHOP: Well, the Government is --\nQUESTION: Let me explain how I'm thinking of\nthis case. Suppose that you went in the middle of Lake\nErie with a big punch, and you punched a hole in the\nbottom and all the water ran out. Would that violate this\nact?\nMR. BISHOP: No.\nQUESTION: No.\nMR. BISHOP: That would regulated under the\nrivers --\nQUESTION: Okay, it wouldn't violate the act.\nThere's nothing. All right.\nNow suppose you went to Lake Erie and you had\nabout 1,000 dump trucks or great big rakes and you filled\nup Lake Erie. Would that violate the act?\nMR. BISHOP: That would fall under section 404.\nQUESTION: Absolutely, okay. So now what you\nhave is you punch a hole in the bottom and you bring some\ndirt in. All right? So -- so --\nMR. BISHOP: We bring no --\nQUESTION: -- you brought in some dirt and you\npunched the hole. Now --\nMR. BISHOP: We bring -- we bring a little dirt\nin at the margin.\nQUESTION: So your argument is because you only\nbrought a little dirt and you were mostly interested in\npunching the hole, you fall outside the act.\nMR. BISHOP: That's right. And that --\nQUESTION: That's it. Okay. Well, I don't know\nif we're interested in the purpose of the act and you\nviolate it even a little bit, why don't you lose?\nMR. BISHOP: No, no. Well, the purpose of the\n-- no. The purpose of the act, Justice Breyer -- there\nare multiple purposes of this act, but the purpose to\npreserve the Nation's waterways is achieved through a -- a\ndual or perhaps a tripartite process. There is a section\n402 NPDES permit that is regulated by the Federal\nGovernment. There is a section 404 fill and dredge\nauthority that is -- is -- that is handled by the U.S.\nArmy Corps of Engineers. But that is only part of the\npicture.\nThe Government through -- the -- the Congress\nthrough section 208 set up a process which is mainly\nadministered through the States, although with\nconsiderable Federal assistance, for -- for regulating\nnonpoint source pollution. If this activity, this plowing\nactivity, is not regulated under section 404, it is,\nnevertheless, regulated by the States as nonpoint source\npollution.\nAnd so the goal of the act to -- to protect the\nNation's waters is not one that depends on the Federal\nGovernment, and in fact, we think here that to give a\nbroad reading to the powers of the Army Corps of Engineer\nunder section 404 by straining these very -- these --\nthese terms, these series of terms that Congress\npredicated section 404 jurisdiction on, that that would\ncontravene Congress' other goal in section 101(b) which is\nto preserve and protect the primary responsibilities and\nrights of the States.\nQUESTION: Mr. Bishop, will you explain\nsomething to me? And -- and -- on a most basic level, if\nwhat the concern was it was to preserve wetlands and not\nhave them converted into dry lands, what difference should\nit make if the conversion comes about through redeposit,\nshaking all the stuff up, turning it upside down, but what\nyou're ending up with is dry land rather than wetland, or\nif you take a little sludge from someplace else and put it\nthere?\nMR. BISHOP: We don't think it's permissible,\nJustice Ginsburg, to protect wetlands by ignoring the\nplain language of the statute because Congress, through\nusing the terms that it did, imposed limits on Federal\npower that preserve and protect, as 101(b) says, the power\nof the States to regulate nonpoint source pollution. And\nso this --\nQUESTION: So when you say --\nMR. BISHOP: -- so it --\nQUESTION: -- you say, well, nonpoint is --\nthat's another issue, whether this is a point source,\nwhether the --\nMR. BISHOP: We don't believe this is a point\nsource. We don't believe it involves fill material --\nQUESTION: But that's -- that's another issue --\nMR. BISHOP: -- or dredged material.\nQUESTION: -- than whether -- I thought you were\nsaying this is a redeposit of the same material.\nTherefore, it can't come under the act.\nMR. BISHOP: It's -- it's a redeposit of the\nmaterial. Therefore it is not an addition --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. BISHOP: -- of material to the wetland.\nQUESTION: Is there any redeposit that could be?\nMR. BISHOP: Well, the -- the -- Judge Silberman\nin the National Mining case said that the terms addition\nin section 404 and also the concept that a 404 permit is\nfor the -- is for the deposit of material to a specified\ndisposal site, that read together, those show that\nCongress intended that there be a geographic or temporal\nseparation between the dredging activity or where the\nmaterial comes from and where it is deposited. So, you\nknow, if a bulldozer digs up large quantities of material\nfrom one side of a wetland and moves them to another, you\nknow, perhaps it is reasonable for the agency in a\ncircumstance like that to say that there has been an\naddition.\nEven in a case like Deaton, where you have\ndredging, the dredging takes soil out of the wetland. At\nthat point it becomes a defined pollutant under section\n404 which is dredged spoil, something that Congress said\nwas a pollutant. And if is that is sidecast, then, you\nknow, certainly there is far more movement of the soil and\nfar more disturbance of the soil in a situation like that.\nIt's lifted out of the wetland and it is moved elsewhere.\nBut what we're dealing with here is a plow, a\ndeep plow, that goes through the soil and that pushes it\nto the side and -- and moves it, but it stays in contact\nwith the soil all around it and it's simply moved in small\ndegrees.\nQUESTION: Is there a difference between deep\nripping and deep plowing?\nMR. BISHOP: They're the same. They're the same\nthing, Justice O'Connor. And -- and chiseling, which is\nmentioned as a form of plowing in the regulations, is the\nsame thing too. It's just -- it's exactly the same\nimplement.\nQUESTION: Well, what -- what is the effect of\nsection 1344 which says nonprohibited discharge of dredged\nor fill materials, that the discharge from normal farming\nand activities such as plowing are not considered, I\nguess, as --\nMR. BISHOP: Well, Justice O'Connor, our -- our\ntake on this case is that we never get to 404(f), that\nthis activity is not a discharge to begin with because it\ndoesn't satisfy the requirements set out in 404(a). It is\nnot -- it does not involve a point source. A plow is not\na point source. This is not fill material. It's not\ndredged material. It is not an addition. Therefore, it\nis not discharge.\nQUESTION: So, you think we never get there.\nMR. BISHOP: That's -- that's our argument.\nQUESTION: But if we were to disagree with you,\nbecause of this marginal shifting of soil from the uplands\nto the wetland, then we'd have to look at that?\nMR. BISHOP: If -- well, that would be -- that\nwould be an issue, but as I say, there's no finding as to\nthat sort of a -- that sort of an addition. And I don't\nbelieve -- Justice O'Connor, let me be clear that that --\nthe -- the movement of material into the margins of the\nwaters here would not be a discharge. Even if it is an\naddition, it still has to qualify as fill material and as\ndredged material and as a point source. And a plow simply\nis none of those things, and I hope I get a chance to\nexplain why I don't think it's a point source.\nQUESTION: Why -- there's something called a\nbackhoe that has been labeled a point source and a\nbulldozer that has been labeled.\nMR. BISHOP: Right.\nQUESTION: Why not a ripper?\nMR. BISHOP: Well, let me explain. The language\nof the statute is that a point source is a confined\nconveyance, a confined, discrete conveyance. And we do\nnot believe -- and if you look at -- and then are examples\nset -- set out in the statute. And this is at 5a of the\naddendum to the Government's brief, which is a little\neasier to handle than our petition appendix. A point\nsource is a discernible, confined, discrete conveyance.\nAnd then there are a series of examples.\nNow, the Government's regulations don't define\npoint source. In fact, they don't even use point source.\nThe -- the 404 regulations don't include the term, point\nsource, and they're not in the 1996 memorandum to the\nfield in which the -- the Government purported to explain\nwhy deep plowing is covered by 404.\nBut we think that these terms and these examples\nshow one important characteristic of a -- of a point\nsource, that it confines the material that it conveys.\nQUESTION: Why? It doesn't -- I mean, why is a\ntruck? Does a truck fall within it? I mean --\nMR. BISHOP: A dump -- a dump --\nQUESTION: -- what I do is I have my truck. I\nfill it up with guck and I move the guck over to the lake\nand I dump it in.\nMR. BISHOP: A dump truck --\nQUESTION: Now, is the truck a point source?\nMR. BISHOP: A dump truck confines the material\nand it conveys it.\nQUESTION:\nanywhere in the statute.\nMR. BISHOP: Yes, it does.\nQUESTION: Which word --\nMR. BISHOP: It says a discernible, confined,\nand discrete --\nQUESTION: Not confining. Not confining.\nQUESTION: It's the conveyance that is confined,\nnot the material.\nMR. BISHOP: Well, that's the Government's\ntheory, but --\nQUESTION: Well, but isn't that what the plain\nlanguage says?\nMR. BISHOP: No, no.\nQUESTION: It says confined conveyance, not\nconfining conveyance.\nMR. BISHOP: Well, I don't think that's right.\nI mean, first of all, the Government has never adopted\nthat -- it's just come up with that -- that argument for\nthe purposes of this litigation. It's not in any\nregulation.\nQUESTION: Well, we're coming up with it now.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: And it's a pretty darned good one\ntoo.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BISHOP: Well, I -- I don't think it is,\nJustice Scalia, if you look at the examples that are --\nare given because the characteristic of all of these\nthings is that they confine the material --\nQUESTION: Well, what is rolling stock?\nMR. BISHOP: It's defined in Webster's as -- as\nthe -- the trucks of a trucking company or --\nQUESTION: Fine. So -- and it doesn't, however\n-- suppose I have a brilliant idea. Instead of a truck, I\nwill take a giant rake, 17 feet across, and rake the\nmountain into Lake Superior. All right. Now, is -- is --\nthat doesn't fall within this just because I thought of\nthis brain storm of using this giant rake instead of a\ntruck?\nMR. BISHOP: No. I think the -- the common\nsense question is, does this vehicle confine material.\nThere are some --\nQUESTION: I would say the common sense question\nis whether or not it's exactly the same for all intents\nand purposes of this statute as a truck.\nMR. BISHOP: Well, but -- the -- there is a list\nof examples --\nQUESTION: Well, isn't -- isn't your point\nwhether it's a conveyance?\nMR. BISHOP:\nQUESTION: The rake is a conveyance. It is\nmeant to move the dirt down, and I suppose your point is\nthat the -- the plow is not intended to convey the dirt\nanywhere except up and down. Some of it may accidentally\ngo sideways, but that's not what the plow is for.\nMR. BISHOP: Well, I think that that is a very\nuseful term for us, conveyance. Conveyance certainly\ngives the idea of something that is intended to move\nmaterial from one place to another. And a plow is not. A\nplow is intended --\nQUESTION: Well, why -- why will not up and down\nsatisfy?\nMR. BISHOP: The -- because we're not -- I mean,\nwe're not in this business to convey a material anywhere.\nWe're in this business --\nQUESTION: No. That's not your purpose.\nQUESTION: Isn't a plow a --\nQUESTION: That's not your purpose. But that is\nnecessarily what you are doing by the activity that you\nengage in, isn't it?\nMR. BISHOP: Justice -- Justice Souter, I don't\nthink that in any normal use of the term conveyance that\nyou would include a rake or a plow that just pushes\nmaterial a short distance, perhaps a matter of inches or\nfeet.\nQUESTION: Well, let's -- let's assume that I --\nI'm accepting Justice Breyer's suggestion and the rake\nwould be a -- would -- would be a point source here\nbecause it conveyed. If that is so, why should there be,\nin effect, a -- a -- an excluding analysis for the -- for\nthe ripper that moves the stuff up and down?\nMR. BISHOP: Well, I mean, that's my argument,\nJustice Souter. I believe that the terms confined and\nconveyance in the statute in their plain meaning and as\nthey are elucidated through all of these examples that are\ngiven, that they all have characteristics in common. One\nis that they confine the material. The other is that they\nconvey it. And I don't believe that that is an apt\ndescription of a plow shank, a 5-inch wide plow shank,\npulled through the soil and -- and the movement that --\nQUESTION: Well, you -- you could say that it\ndoes convey. It -- it conveys mostly, almost entirely, up\nand down and maybe a little bit sideways. But to the\nextent that it does convey a lot up and down, which is its\npurpose, it hasn't made any addition. That would be your\npoint for the up and down.\nMR. BISHOP: Well --\nQUESTION: But you're still stuck with the\nsideways, it seems to me.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BISHOP: Well, and we don't -- we don't\nthink that the -- the plowing here satisfies any of these\nterms. So we don't think that it's a point source, but\neven if it is a point source, we certainly don't think\nthat it's an addition because there is no addition to the\nwetland unless something is added. And all we are doing\nis moving soil, be it up or down or sideways, small -- to\nsmall degrees. And that doesn't -- nothing is coming into\nthe wetland from the outside.\nQUESTION: Well, isn't --\nQUESTION: -- the argument that -- that it's a\n-- it's not adding material. No new material is added,\nbut as I take the Government's argument, it's converting\nsomething that wasn't a pollutant into a pollutant when\nthis deep ripper churns up the earth and deposits the\nrocks and the soil and the biological material on the top.\nMR. BISHOP: Justice Ginsburg, the -- the\nstatute, section 404, applies to two types of pollutant\nonly, and that's fill material and dredged material.\nDredged material is material that is dredged out of the\nsoil, the sort of thing that a backhoe does, dredging a\nhole and lifting it up out of the soil. The agency's\nregulations define dredged material as material that is\nexcavated or dredged from the wetland.\nThe district court didn't find that there was\nany dredged material involved here, and we don't believe\nthat any reasonable reading of the term, dredged material,\nor of the regulation that talks about excavating and\ndredging from the wetland could describe the activity of\ndeep plowing.\nThat leaves fill material. Fill material in its\nplain meaning is material that is -- is used, is moved in\nto fill a gap or a cavity. It was defined in the\nregulations at the time as material that was used for the\nprimary purpose of replacing an aquatic area with dry land\nor changing the bottom elevation. As Justice Breyer has\npointed out, if anything took water out of this wetland,\nit is the activity of punching the hole in the clay pan so\nthat it drains out. We are not interested in filling this\nwetland and there was no purpose here to -- to use the\nmaterial to replace wet areas.\nAnd in fact, it's quite irrelevant to a farmer\nand rancher if the topsoil remains wet, and in this area\nit does, as a matter of fact, remain wet because the clay\npan seals up and during the rainy season, there's --\nthere's water on the surface. It's just not our purpose\nto do that.\nQUESTION: You -- you were quoting the -- the\nregulations as to the -- the definition of -- of dredged\nmaterial, but the definition in the statute of pollutant\nincludes rock and sand.\nMR. BISHOP: It does, but the -- but the\npollutants -- the pollutants have to be in a particular\nform in order to be covered by 404, and that form is fill\nmaterial or dredged material. So it's not enough to say\nthat there is rock or sand involved here. It has to be in\nthe form of fill material or dredged material which is why\nyou have these regulatory definitions of those two\nconcepts.\nQUESTION: Where do I get that from?\nMR. BISHOP: In -- in section 404(a) on page 2a\nof the Government's addendum. The permits are issued for\nthe discharge of dredged or fill material into the\nnavigable waters at specified disposal sites. The -- the\nregulations then define on page 6a and 7a fill material,\ndischarge of fill material, and dredged material and\ndischarge of dredged material.\nQUESTION: So the definition -- for present\npurposes the definition of pollutant is irrelevant.\nMR. BISHOP: It is -- I'm not sure whether it's\nirrelevant because under section 301, if you don't get a\npermit, then what you're charged with violating is section\n301(a), which is on page 1a. And that talks about the\ndischarge of any pollutant.\nBut the basis on which this case has been\nlitigated is that we needed a 404(a) permit not a 402\npermit, and that is a permit for the addition of fill\nmaterial or dredged material.\nQUESTION: Is -- is -- what is your definition?\nBecause I think that's actually not a bad point. You said\nit's a conveyance. This is not a conveyance. The\ndictionary, I guess, defines conveyance as a -- as a means\nof conveying, and it says conveying is cause to pass from\none place to another. So the Government says, well, we'll\naccept that. And of course, if you take that literally\nfrom the dictionary, then this is a conveyance because it\nis a means of conveying. You say it couldn't be that\nbroad. I have a better definition, more consistent with\nwhat the paragraph means, and that better definition is\nwhat?\nMR. BISHOP: It's the -- well, clearly the\nGovernment has some room here, but what we do say is that\na conveyance does not describe that no one -- no one\nlooking at a deep plow would say that's a conveyance. It\nis not an object --\nQUESTION: Well, except Webster would seem to\nsay that it is a conveyance because it fits the\ndefinition. And now, so you don't like that definition.\nI understand. I -- I see where -- in general terms, I see\nwhere you're going, but I -- I'm asking you if you have a\ndefinition that would help you short of Webster's\ndefinition.\nMR. BISHOP: Well, I'm not sure that Webster's\ncovers this situation. A conveyance in common parlance is\nsomething that will move material that is intended to\nconvey, to transport. I'll have to find the page of our\nbrief.\nQUESTION: Is it --\nQUESTION: I must say I never thought a plow was\na conveyance either.\nMR. BISHOP: A means -- I mean, this is what I\nhave from Webster's Third. This is on page 4 of our reply\nbrief. A means or way of conveying, carrying,\ntransporting, serving as a means of transportation. I\nmean, there's the idea in there that it's a purposeful\nactivity --\nQUESTION: You -- you want to read it as --\nMR. BISHOP: -- to convey the material to\nanother place. And -- and that's not just want a plow\ndoes. A plow just moves through the soil pushing it to\nthe side and turning it over and cutting through the soil.\nI -- I just don't think any common sense or reasonable\nmeaning --\nQUESTION: Is that different from --\nMR. BISHOP:\nQUESTION: -- the propeller that was involved in\nthe Florida case?\nMR. BISHOP: In -- in MCC?\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. BISHOP: The propeller in MCC -- this is a\nhuge propeller on a barge in a very shallow navigable\nstream. The propeller cut through the -- the material at\nthe bottom of this stream, picked up large quantities of\nit with every -- with every -- at each stroke, and\npropelled it out of the -- out of the waters. Whether or\nnot that is --\nQUESTION: Is that what it was designed to do?\nMR. BISHOP: No, that's not what it was designed\nto do. And I think --\nQUESTION: It wouldn't meet your definition.\nQUESTION: But isn't that exactly what happens\nhere, that the deep -- deep rigging or whatever you call\nit -- the -- it breaks up the clay. There's a -- a body\nof clay, and then the -- the broken-up clay finds its way\ninto the water.\nMR. BISHOP: Well, yes, it gets pushed. It does\nget pushed to the side within the -- within the waters.\nQUESTION: So it's the exact parallel to the\nother case.\nMR. BISHOP: MCC -- no.\ndecision, and I'm not sure that it fits the definition of\nthe point source or dredged or fill material. I mean, it\nis more like dredging.\nBut, you know, if a point source is a confined\nconveyance, our -- our contention is that it must\ntransport -- purposefully transport material from one\nplace to another and it must confine it --\nQUESTION: The key to your argument, if I\nunderstand it, is the purposeful thing. They didn't\nreally intend to do this. It's just a byproduct of what\nthey're doing, and therefore there's --\nMR. BISHOP: No. That's -- that's not the key,\nJustice Stevens. The key -- the key is equally that this\nis to pick up and move material to another place. We\ndon't want it here. Let's move it. And it's just not an\napt description of what plowing does.\nBut I don't want --\nQUESTION: Would give us -- would you give us a\n-- your best comprehensive description of what this kind\nof so-called plowing does? Does it leave the clay down at\nthe clay layer and simply break it up? Does some of the\nclay find its way up in the course of this ripping? I'm\nnot sure that I know how it works.\nMR. BISHOP: Well, I think primarily what\nhappens is this is a very dense clay layer that the --\nthey have 5-inch shank cutting through it. And I think\nthe most apt description is that it cuts through the clay.\nThis clay is heavy. It is not -- there's not a lot of\nhomogenization, as the -- as the Ag Extension pamphlet\nthat I cite in the reply brief says. There's not a lot of\nhomogenization at the lower levels from below the clay to\nabove or from the clay above because of the nature of the\nsoil and because of the nature of the piece of equipment.\nThis is not like a moldboard plow that has a curved shank\nthat pushes the soil up. It's a cutting device that is\nintended to allow water to hydrate the roots and to allow\nthe roots room to grow.\nIf I could reserve the balance of my time.\nQUESTION: Mr. Minear.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY P. MINEAR\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. MINEAR: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may\nit please the Court:\nThe Clean Water Act placed no regulatory\nrestrictions on the vast majority of acreage that\npetitioners sought to subdivide and sell in this case.\nThe act required only that petitioners obtain a Federal\npermit for those few acres of -- of wetlands that are\nprotected under the Clean Water Act. And those wetlands\nare concededly protected.\nthese are waters of the United States is not in this case.\nPetitioners who are --\nQUESTION: And the -- the legislation doesn't\nrequire that these wetlands be -- be left fallow. You --\nyou could use them agriculturally and -- and they would\nstill be wetlands and you wouldn't be violating the act.\nMR. MINEAR: That is correct. That is correct.\nRather, the focus here is on the activities --\nQUESTION: Could be used for normal farming and\nplowing presumably without a permit.\nMR. MINEAR: They could be under the normal\nfarming exemption.\nAnd we have three questions here, so I'd like to\ntry and proceed logically from the question of whether\nthere was a discharge of a pollutant, the first question\non which we spent most of the time discussing this so far;\nthe question of whether that discharge would be covered by\nthe normal farming exemption; and then finally, the\nquestion of civil penalties.\nOn the question of whether there was a discharge\nof pollutant -- pollutants, the Clean Water Act makes\nclear that a discharge is defined as any unauthorized\naddition of any pollutant from any point source. If you\nmake such a discharge, under 301 you have violated the\nlaw.\nexceptions to 301. You can obtain a permit for normal\npollutants under 402 or you could obtain a dredge and fill\npermit for fill and dredged material under 404.\nQUESTION: So is a -- is a point source a\ndefined, discrete conveyance? Is that how the statute\ndeals with it?\nMR. MINEAR: The -- the statute states that a\npoint source is a discernible, confined, discrete\nconveyance.\nQUESTION: And is a plow of this type such a\nconveyance?\nMR. MINEAR: Yes, it is, and let me describe.\nQUESTION: Why?\nMR. MINEAR: Let me describe.\nQUESTION: Because that's a point of\ndisagreement between you and your opponent here.\nMR. MINEAR: That is correct, Your -- Your\nHonor.\nThe equipment we're talking about here is a\nbulldozer, a Caterpillar D10 bulldozer, that is about 20\nfeet tall and about 25 feet long and typically carries a\n16-foot blade on the front of it. It weighs about 100,000\npounds. In this particular application, this earth-moving\napplication, it carries what's called a deep ripper or\nshank behind it. Mr. Bishop says it's 5 inches wide. The\nunderstanding from my experts is that it's actually more\nlike a foot wide. But the shank is about 5 to 7 feet\nlong. The shank penetrates deeply into the ground and\npulls up the material behind it. The idea here is to\ndisgorge the clay material that lies beneath the surface\nof the soil so that the --\nQUESTION: It doesn't just go in and come out.\nIt --\nMR. MINEAR: It pulls --\nQUESTION: -- in your view moves the material?\nMR. MINEAR: Yes, and in fact the district\ncourt --\nQUESTION: To the side or forward or something?\nMR. MINEAR: Yes. The district court opinion\nstates on page 70 that material is moved both horizontally\nand vertically.\nQUESTION: Yes, but if -- so long as the\nmaterial that -- that moved a couple of inches or even a\ncouple of feet horizontally is moved from within the\nwetlands to within the wetlands, you haven't added\nanything to the wetlands, have you?\nMR. MINEAR: No. I disagree with this, Your\nHonor, and let me make a point here that I think is very\nimportant to the entire dredge and fill permit program.\nDredged material by its very nature is typically\nmoved from one area of a wetland and placed elsewhere.\nThink of it when we talk about dredging a river and we're\ndredging a channel. We are taking the material out of one\nportion of the waterway and putting it into another. So\nthat's -- this idea of redeposition has been a part --\nQUESTION: Well, that's easy to see, a dredge\nthat takes a quantity of material and physically moves it\nto another place. Here your opponent says this goes in\nbut it comes up and down. It doesn't, in fact, move the\nmaterial to a different spot.\nMR. MINEAR: No. I think that Mr. Bishop would\nagree that once the -- what happens is once the plow\npenetrates into the -- the earth, it stays beneath the\nearth and it's pulled up. And what happens is that clay\n-- that clay pan that is beneath the surface is raised to\nthe top, together with other material.\nQUESTION: He says that's not the purpose. He\nsays the purpose is -- it doesn't do that. It just breaks\nit up. I mean, maybe some of it come, but that the\noperation is not intended to mingle the clay with the --\nwith the topsoil. Just to break up the clay. I mean,\nthis is apparently a dispute between the two of you.\nMR. MINEAR: And it was one that was resolved,\nwith respect, Your Honor, by the district court which made\nclear that the purpose here is to break up the clay pan.\nAnd in the process of doing that, it moves the earth both\nhorizontally and vertically.\nQUESTION: Well, he doesn't deny that.\nMR. MINEAR: Yes. And that's sufficient.\nQUESTION: But -- but you're -- you're\ndescribing the moving it -- of it -- of it at least\nvertically as being the whole purpose of the operation.\nAnd -- and he says that's not the case, that what they\nwant to do is break up the clay and a little bit may --\nmay, indeed, come higher in the course of that. But\nthat's not what it's designed to do unlike the kind of\nplow you -- I'm used to seeing, you know, that you carry\nbehind a horse and it's -- it's shaped in such a way that\nindeed the soil comes up. This is not that kind of a\nplow.\nMR. MINEAR: But, Your Honor, the purpose here\nis not what matters. It's what happens in the wetland.\nIs there an addition? And as I said, there's an addition\nfrom three different perspectives.\nQUESTION: Well, I suppose there's an addition\nif I'm walking through a wetland that -- you know, that --\nthat happens to be dry at this time a year and I kick -- I\nkick a dirt ball and it moves to another part of the\nwetland. I guess -- I suppose that's an addition too,\nisn't it?\nMR. MINEAR: The regulations make clear -- EPA\nhas made clear that those types of --\nQUESTION: Lucky for me my foot is not a\nconveyance. Maybe it is a conveyance. I don't know.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. MINEAR: The regulations make clear that de\nminimis movements of this type are not of concern to the\nagency. Rather --\nQUESTION: Suppose a person has boots that --\nand he regularly -- regularly -- people on this farm\nregularly walk through some poison and it's on their\nboots. And they walk further on and, lo and behold, they\nwalk into the place and poison all the fish. And they do\nthat on a regular basis. Are the boots considered a\nconveyance?\nMR. MINEAR: EPA has indicated that walking,\nbicycling, driving a vehicle through a wetland is normally\n-- has -- has de minimis effects and --\nQUESTION: No, no. I'm trying to ask --\nMR. MINEAR: Can it be? Can it be in the\nabstract sense?\nQUESTION: I'm interested in the question of\nconveyance. Are the boots a conveyance where the effects\nare not minimal where, for example, it happens regularly,\nseriously, destroys the fish because they're walking\nthrough poisons?\nNow, the boots are not normally considered a\nconveyance, but they do, in fact, convey the poison. A\nplow is not normally considered a conveyance. A ditch\nthat you dig to plant roses in is not a conveyance. But\nany of those things could in a subsidiary way convey\nsomething as part of their primary nonconveying objective.\nNow, I want to know if you consider those subsidiary\nthings where it is serious to be conveyances.\nMR. MINEAR: Yes. They meet the statutory\ndefinition --\nQUESTION: Gee whiz, Congress should have said,\nyou know, by conveyance or otherwise then. Why did it\nsay, you know, it has to be -- it has to be a conveyance?\nMR. MINEAR: Because although as Justice Breyer\nexplained --\nQUESTION: And if a boot is not a conveyance,\nit's not a conveyance.\nMR. MINEAR: It is a -- it is a conveyance.\nthink you -- you need to understand the logic that\nCongress applied in enacting the statute, and that was to\ndefine all of these terms quite broadly, understanding\nthat there would be enforcement discretion.\nNow, we're not talking about de minimis\nactivities in this case.\nacres of wetlands in this case. And we're talking about\nactivities that were found to have adverse environmental\neffects.\nQUESTION: Now, you -- you say filling as\nthough, you know, they're not going to be wetlands\nanymore, but that's perfectly okay. He can make them not\nwetlands anymore so long as he's doing it by normal\nfarming. Right?\nMR. MINEAR: He can --\nQUESTION: I mean, the evil here is not that\nthis is taken out of our national deposit of wetlands.\nThat isn't the evil, is it?\nMR. MINEAR: That was the concern that motivated\nthese provisions. Congress understood when it enacted the\nClean Water Act --\nQUESTION: Well, but Congress exempted normal\nfarming and -- and activities such as plowing, did it\nnot --\nMR. MINEAR: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- from a permit?\nMR. MINEAR: Your Honor, it did. And I think\nwhat --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. MINEAR: -- that indicates is that Congress\nwas aware that plowing was a point source of addition of\npollutants. It could have that effect. And for that\nreason it created an exemption, the normal farming\nexemption. But that exemption itself is limited and the\nregulations that EPA and the Corps have issued under this\n-- under this normal farming exemption make clear that the\nactivities we're talking about here would not be covered.\nQUESTION: How so?\nMR. MINEAR: To be sure --\nQUESTION: How so?\nMR. MINEAR: The activities that are covered\nunder the normal farming exemption are ongoing\nagricultural activities, part of a regular farming\nactivity, and also activities that ultimately under the\nrecapture provision, first, do not change the use of the\nland and do not result in converting a wetland to dry\nland.\nNow, the agency was charged with responsibility\nfor -- for fleshing out the scope of the normal farming\nexemption, and it made clear that a farmer who continues\nto engage in practices that he's always engaged in,\nincluding normal -- normal plowing --\nQUESTION: And you say here there was a change\nin the use.\nMR. MINEAR: Yes. This land --\nQUESTION:\nto reach that exception because he says he wants to rest\non the fact that, A, it wasn't a point source, that the\nplow is not a point source, and B, there was no addition.\nThere was simply a redeposit of material in the same\nplace. Have you dealt with that yet?\nMR. MINEAR: Yes. I would like to go back to\nthat point. We're now back to question 1 and talking\nabout the question of addition which is fundamental to the\nidea of a discharge.\nOur view is that there were additions from three\nsources here.\nFirst, there was addition by material being\nmoved from the upland into the wetland. Counsel states\nthat that occurred in only three cases. The record\nactually shows that it occurred in at least 33 of the 40\nwetlands that are involved here. The district court made\nreference to it only in those three cases where it was the\nonly movement of that material. But it's easy to see that\nthe three cases that are cited in the district court's\nopinion refer to those cases where the ripper passed next\nto a wetland but didn't go in and pushed -- nevertheless,\npushed soil into the wetland. The same thing would happen\nin those areas where the ripper actually intruded through\nthe wetland as well. So in the case of all of the -- the\nareas, the 29 areas that were filled, all of them had\nmovement of material from upland into the wetlands.\nQUESTION: Well, excuse me. I thought your\nopponent said it isn't an addition because it's a\nredeposit of material. Have you dealt with that?\nMR. MINEAR: Yes. The -- in talking about --\nbefore when I spoke about the dredged material, about how\nmaterial is moved from one place to the wetland to another\nplace, that is a regulable redeposit that is covered by\nthe act. And we believe the Fourth Circuit's reasoning in\nDeaton is quite persuasive on this.\nQUESTION: I think that's already a stretch. I\nmean, you know, with that you'll say, well, literally\nyou're not adding anything to the wetlands just to move\nthe -- the mud from one portion to another. But you have\nthis big dredging operation and it does disturb everything\nand you move it. So, yes, I'll go along with you on that.\nBut -- but then, you know, that's not enough for\nyou. Now we have to generalize from that and say that any\nmovement of anything within the wetlands is also an\naddition to the wetlands. And -- and that brings you to\nthis case. And I think it is fanciful to think that\nanything has been added to the wetlands here.\nMR. MINEAR: As I said before, Your Honor, not\nonly do we have redeposits. We also have the material\nthat moved from the upland into the wetland.\nQUESTION: Fine.\nMR. MINEAR: And we also have material, if I may\nfinish --\nQUESTION: I see that, but -- but not all of the\npenalties -- we're going to get to the penalty part.\nRight?\nMR. MINEAR: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: They were $25,000 for each pass, and\nit hasn't been established that every one of these passes\nhad that effect. And -- and he says most of them didn't.\nMR. MINEAR: Before we get to the penalty part,\nif I could, Your Honor, I'd like to point to one area --\nother area in which material is moved into the wetland,\nand that is material that's beneath the clay pan that was\nsegregated and separated by this impermeable clay pan and\ninstead was pulled up and put into the wetland as well.\nQUESTION: Okay. Would you be explicit about\nwhat is implicit in that is, and that is, the definition\nof wetland, I take it, is the -- the land area between the\nsurface and the hard pan, and the area beneath that is not\npart of wetland so that if you take material from beneath\nand bring it up, you are moving into the wetland. Is that\nyour definition and what you're saying?\nMR. MINEAR: Yes, that's correct.\nQUESTION:\nand I'm not disturbing the wetland.\nMR. MINEAR: You would not be regulated by\nsection --\nQUESTION: Is that -- is that the position the\nGovernment -- the Government wants to take, that you --\nanything that's under the wetland, you know, go -- go for\nit? It -- it doesn't -- doesn't involve the wetland.\nMR. MINEAR: Your Honor, we're paying attention\nto the -- the strict language of the statute. The statute\nis concerned with additions.\nQUESTION: How far down does a wetland go?\nMR. MINEAR: We think in this case it's fair to\ndescribe it as going to the bottom of the clay pan because\nthat's what's actually holding the water in the area. In\nother cases, it might be different. There's vast\nhydrological variation. In some places wetlands are\nsustained by the groundwater that comes up from beneath,\nand so it's very difficult to talk about where the bottom\nof the wetland would be --\nQUESTION: You're willing to have us say that in\nthis case, that wetlands only go down as far as whatever\n-- whatever stratum holds the water in the wetland, and\neverything else is not included. Below that is okay.\nMR. MINEAR: Well, Your Honor, respectfully what\nwe're asking you to do in this case is to recognize that\nthe wetland does go to that clay pan. In other cases it\nmight well be different. But we need to deal with the\nfacts --\nQUESTION: I thought so.\nMR. MINEAR: Yes, Your Honor --\nQUESTION: But I -- I think -- I thought you\nwere saying it does not go below the clay level because I\nthought you were making the argument that when you bring\nmaterial from below the clay level into the wet area, you\nare moving it into the wetland from outside the wetland.\nSo I thought you were making the further proposition that\nthe wetland stops at the -- at the clay.\nMR. MINEAR: In this case that's correct. But\nin other cases such as in Riverside Bayview, the case that\nthis Court previously addressed wetlands, there the\nwetland was actually -- was -- received water from\nbeneath, and it did not have a sustaining clay pan.\nThere's simply variations in the types of --\nQUESTION: No.\nQUESTION: How do we view --\nQUESTION: Never mind.\nQUESTION: The sustaining clay pad is not part\nof the wetland you're now -- you're now saying.\nMR. MINEAR: We're saying that the clay pan is a\npart --\nQUESTION: Is part of the wetland.\nMR. MINEAR: But the area beneath it is not.\nQUESTION: Well, but he --\nMR. MINEAR: There's -- there's soil beneath the\nclay pan that he pulled up.\nQUESTION: Was he -- was he pulling up soil from\nbeneath the clay pan?\nMR. MINEAR: Yes. I think it's clear from the\nrecord that he must have.\nQUESTION: What -- what about the question I\nthink Justice O'Connor asked? And I think Justice Scalia\ndid too. At least I'm waiting with bated breath. That\nis, what -- what -- suppose we agree with you that, well,\nat least the material from the side, at least the material\nfrom the bottom was an addition to the wetland, brought\nabout by, let's say, this conveyance. All right.\nNow, what do we have to do with this case? Do\nwe then have to send it back for a reassessment of\npenalties or what?\nMR. MINEAR: No. I think you can affirm on that\nbasis because those two sources were present with regard\nto all of the -- all of the -- the wetlands that were --\nQUESTION: All of the passes?\nMR. MINEAR: All of the -- all of the wetlands\nthat were at issue in this case.\nQUESTION: Well, he -- he -- I think your\nopponent said that the penalties rested upon 17 passes or\nsomething, and I guess they conceded that each one was a\nseparate violation, which they may regret, if this is the\nrationale anyway. Do we have to have a reassessment of\nthe penalty or not?\nMR. MINEAR: We don't think that a reassessment\nof the penalty would be necessary even if you took this\nalternative position. And let me say, first of all, the\npenalty here was based -- what's in contention is how one\ncalculates the maximum penalty that can be imposed on a\nparty in one of these cases. And there's a fair amount of\nflexibility in determining how that might be done. In\nthis case, the parties had agreed below that each pass of\nthe ripper was, in fact, a violation. The -- the district\ncourt then determined the maximum penalty by taking the\nnumber of passes of the ripper and multiplying it times\nthe maximum penalty. But it did not impose that penalty.\nInstead, it looked to the specific statutory criteria that\ngovern the application of the penalty provision.\nQUESTION: I -- I see that, but I'm still -- I'm\nwriting the opinion let's imagine. I say, all right, they\nbrought some guck from the side. That violates the\nstatute. They got some from underneath the bottom. That\nviolates the statute.\nNow I'm at the point where the lower court wrote\nmost of its opinion. What about the stuff that's just\nsort of muck down at the bottom and it simply turns it\nover? Now, do I have to answer the question of whether\nthat does or does not violate this statute? Do I have to\nanswer that? Because, after all, it turns -- the penalty\nturns on it.\nMR. MINEAR: I'm not sure the penalty turns on\nit. We would say that if -- obviously this Court has\ndiscretion to determine this -- the types of -- the type\nof remand it wants to send back. We do think --\nQUESTION: All right. If I do have to answer\nit, what do you say to their argument that, yes, if you\nchurn up a lot and move it, for example, over to the point\nwhere the river is running in and dam up the river, that's\none thing. But here all it does is turn it around in\nplace. And indeed, it doesn't really cause any harm.\nIt's the hole that causes the harm. That's their argument\nI think as to that bit. And what do you say as to that?\nMR. MINEAR: I would say, first, the district\ncourt found that there was environmental harm here. On\npage 106 of the petition appendix, it makes note that\nthese types of activities did cause environmental harm.\nWith regard to the penalty assessment, I would\nlook to the fact that the -- the district court considered\nthe seriousness of the violation, the bad faith\nactivities --\nQUESTION: You haven't quite answered the\nquestion.\nMR. MINEAR: I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: The question was think only of that\nlittle bit where the plow blade is taking a bit of muck\nand turning it over. Now, in respect to that they're\nsaying, one, it's a small amount. Two, the redeposit of\nit has nothing to do with the harm. The harm is caused by\nthe hole. Now, as to that bit, if I have to answer the\nquestion, what's your response to that argument?\nMR. MINEAR: My response is that deposit, that\nturning over material that's in place, can still cause\nenvironmental harm that subjects them to a penalty.\nImagine if in that muck, in that material, there are\nentrained heavy metals, arsenic, the types of materials\nthat are filtered out through the normal wetland process.\nQUESTION: And they have added those to the\nwetlands.\nMR. MINEAR: They -- they have added those to\nthe wetland if they've in fact been released from a\nsituation where they're --\nQUESTION: They were in the wetland before, and\nthey're still -- and they're still in the wetland.\nMR. MINEAR: But as the Fourth Circuit explained\nin Deaton, that when you take material and you physically\nchange its situation, if you change it from an aerobic --\nan anaerobic environment to an aerobic environment, if you\nchange its reduction oxidation potential, these are the\nreasons why we have a permit because we're concerned about\nthese types of activities --\nQUESTION: I understand. It's well to be\nconcerned about it, but -- but Congress did use the term\naddition -- addition -- to the wetlands. I mean, don't\nwords mean anything?\nMR. MINEAR: Yes, they do, Your Honor. And as I\nsaid before, they must have contemplated that an addition\nincluded a redeposit because otherwise the idea of -- of\nregulating dredging and the placement of dredged material\nwouldn't have made any sense. Congress was aware of --\nchose its terms quite carefully. It's just that it\nunderstood that --\nQUESTION: Well, it could have meant dredged\nfrom elsewhere, couldn't it?\nMR. MINEAR: That is -- that is possible, but\nthat is very unusual.\nQUESTION: Well, if it's possible, it -- it\nwould mean addition --\nMR. MINEAR: It seems --\nQUESTION: -- if it was dredged from elsewhere.\nMR. MINEAR: It seems unlikely that Congress\nwould have enacted provisions regulating dredged and fill\nmaterial that excluded the most common form of dredging,\nwhich is to take material from one area of the water body\nand move it elsewhere.\nIn any event, it's important to remember that\nthe pollutants we're talking about here include sand,\ngravel, rock, and biological material. These are\nmaterials that are defined within the statute as\npollutants. Clearly Congress recognized the dangers of\nmoving these materials about --\nQUESTION: What about the raking the beach? You\nknow, there are people here worried about what you're\ngoing to do next and say they can't rake the beach in\nfront of their house on the shore of the lake. What about\nthat?\nMR. MINEAR: The answer again is found in the\nagency's regulations which make clear that de minimis\ndisturbances simply do not rise to the level of a\nviolation.\nQUESTION: Well, I mean, but they're saying we\ngo out every morning. We like a neat beach and we -- we\nrake it. And I don't know. Are you going to say that's\nde minimis or not? They like to rake their beach. They\n-- they see a lot of muck washed up from the lake. So\nthey go out there and they -- they go rake the beach, and\nthey throw away all the muck. It might be like an oil\nspill. I don't know. It could be terrible. They clean\nup the beach, and they say on your definitions what you're\ngoing to do is you're going to subject them to permits\nevery time they want to stop -- clean up some\nenvironmental disaster.\nMR. MINEAR: I think, Your Honor, the question\nis have they been subjected to that type of -- of\nregulation, and the answer is no.\nQUESTION: Well, they're worried that they might\nbe. My question is, if we decide the case the way you\nwant, are we, in fact, making their worry justified?\nMR. MINEAR: I do not think so, Your Honor. And\nagain, I think it's important to remember that what the\nagency is fully concerned with are those types of serious\nviolations that cause real environmental harm.\nQUESTION: Well, I don't think Congress wanted\nthe homeowner to have to worry about raking. I don't\nthink they wanted to place the -- the homeowner at the --\nat the mercy of this benign agency who will say, well,\nthere, there, don't worry. We won't get you for raking.\nMR. MINEAR: Your Honor --\nQUESTION:\nto be covered.\nMR. MINEAR: I think, Your Honor, then if they\nhad not intended that there would be enforcement\ndiscretion exercised by an agency, they wouldn't have\nprohibited the addition, any addition, of any pollutant\nfrom any point source. They made the net that was covered\nhere quite broad because they realized there's a vast\nvariety in the types of environmental harm that might be\ncaused --\nQUESTION: Maybe they didn't think a rake was a\npoint source as I don't.\nMR. MINEAR: Your Honor, they -- they have had\nample opportunities to change the regulations -- or to\nchange the -- the terms of the statute. The statute has\nbeen revised three times, and they've been quite specific\nin what they've done. The normal farming exemption is a\ngood example. Congress could have simply exempted all\nfarming activities from coverage under section 404 or the\nClean Water Act itself. Instead, it drew a very specific\nline in this case and it said that we are only restricting\nnormal farming activities and we're subjecting them to a\nrecapture provision. That recapture provision applies\nwhenever the activity, even if it's simply plowing,\nresults in the change in use of the property and also\nresults in a diminishment of the waters of the United\nStates, if it actually fills --\nQUESTION: Mr. Minear, are you saying that an --\nan ordinary plow too, like this deep ripper, would be a\npoint source, but what takes that activity out is that it\nwould come under the normal farming exemption?\nMR. MINEAR: That's exactly right.\nQUESTION: But it is a point source.\nMR. MINEAR: That is correct. The -- the plow\nwould be a point source. And this is the reason why\nCongress enacted the normal farming exemption. It\nrealized it defined these terms quite broadly, and it\nwanted to provide sensible exemptions. But it drew limits\non those exemptions to avoid covering situations like we\nhave here where we're not talking about a yeoman's plow,\nbut rather we're talking about a 100,000 pound bulldozer\npulling a 7-inch -- 7-foot long shank through a wetland\narea.\nI think it's important to remember too that this\nlawsuit could have easily been avoided. The -- the\nparties were -- were -- discussed this issue on a number\nof occasions, and the Corps made quite clear that they\nwere not subject to a permit provided they simply avoided\nthese small wetland areas, what's -- in the case of the\nparcels at issue here are about 1 percent of the property.\nIt was easy enough to simply mark these areas and have the\ncontract rippers who came through avoid those areas. The\npetitioners in this case decided not to do that. They\ndecided to disregard the law and the fact is that this\nsuit and 10 years of litigation -- excuse me -- 8 years of\nlitigation is the result.\nThe fact is that this is a quite sensible\nprogram. The Corps and EPA have applied it quite\nsensibly, and I think that their actions in this case, if\nyou look at the record, were really quite reasonable.\nNow, I would like to touch back, since we've\ncovered a lot of material here, just to go over --\nQUESTION: Excuse me.\nMR. MINEAR: Yes.\nQUESTION: What -- what farming exception is\nthere? Is there just one or are there several of them?\nMR. MINEAR: There's one normal farming\nexemption. That is contained in section 404(f) of the\nstatute, and that is found on pages 2a and 3a of our --\nQUESTION: Okay. But, you see, that's -- that's\nnot an exception for -- for normal -- it's an exception\nfrom the discharge of dredged or fill material. Right?\nMR. MINEAR: That's correct. And so what this\ndoes is it exempts the party from having to get a section\n404 permit for activities that would otherwise constitute\ndredge or fill activities.\nchosen to exempt activities, including specifically\nplowing, indicates that Congress understood that plowing\ncould result in a point source addition of pollutants.\nNow, what Congress additionally did is it -- it\nstates on the carryover -- there's a number of other\nmatters that are exempted as well. It indicates that\nthese activities are not regulated under section 301 or\nsection 404 or section 402, for that matter. But then on\nthe paragraph on page 4a, it recaptures those provisions\nwhen they result in a change of use, when someone, such as\nin this case, decides to take a ranch and subdivide it and\nsell it as farmettes. And it -- and even that recapture\nprovision only applies when it reduces the reach of\nwaters, which is what happened in this case.\nAs the district court found, these waters were\nfilled. They are no longer wetlands, and the idea that\nthese areas are going to be resealed finds no support in\nthe record. The district court found here that what were\nonce wetlands are now orchards. These are not areas that\ninclude wetland -- or have wetland characteristics any\nlonger.\nI would simply like to touch on -- since we --\nwe have bounced around among the three issues here quite a\nbit, I'd like to simply say a few more words about the\ncivil penalty provision because I think it's important.\nThe legal issue that's before the Court on the\ncivil penalty is -- is whether a penalty ought to be\nassessed in terms of determining the maximum penalty on a\nper-day basis or on the basis of the number of violations\nper day. And the Congress made -- made quite clear that\nit wanted the latter to be the basis for determining the\nmaximum civil penalty. It amended the statute in 1987 to\neliminate any ambiguity that might exist with regard to\nthe -- to that provision, and it's quite clear that it\ndoes apply to every violation each day.\nNow, it takes into account that some violations\ncan be continuing and go on for a long period of time.\nAnd those are treated as receiving a $25,000 a day\npenalty. But in the case of the violations we have here,\nthey all occurred in one day on the basis the district\ncourt analyzed the -- the problem.\nFinally, I'd like to make the point that the\ndistrict court needs to have a great deal of discretion in\ndetermining how to apply the penalty provisions that are\ninvolved here. There are different ways to calculate\nviolations, determine what is the appropriate measure of\nviolations, but ultimately the fairness turns on the\ndistrict court's judgment of the individual penalty\nfactors that are considered here.\nIn this case, the court took into account all\nthose factors, including the economic benefits that the\nparty received by avoiding its legal obligations in this\ncase. It's important to remember there are land\ndevelopers, ranchers, and farmers out there that do comply\nwith the statute, that do comply with the regulations, and\nthey are, in effect, penalized if in fact people who\nignore the law are allowed to go forward and not be\nsubject to a substantial penalty in cases in which they\nhave violated the law.\nIn this case the penalties are less than what\nactually would be necessary to recoup the economic benefit\nthat they received according to the -- the facts that the\ndistrict court put forward. The court of the -- or excuse\nme -- the -- the Government put forward. The district\ncourt recognized there was some uncertainty with regard to\ndetermining economic benefit, but nevertheless I think\nchose a very reasonable approach here in terms of\nrequiring both a mitigation remedy and also a substantial\ncivil penalty.\nIf there are no further questions.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Minear.\nMr. Bishop, you have 4 minutes left.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY S. BISHOP\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. BISHOP:\nGovernment has chosen to insert at this level for the very\nfirst time this idea that soil came in from outside the\nwetland. On page 36 of the petition appendix, the -- the\ndistrict court, in describing what the plowing here did,\nsaid that it broke up, mixed, turned over material already\nin the pools, swales, and intermittent streams.\nIf you turn to page 86 through 91, where the\ncourt describes in detail factual findings after hearing\nthe evidence on the impacts on waters, on only three -- as\nto three of the jurisdictional features does the court say\nthat there is any fill coming in from outside, and that is\nwhere there is upland plowing parallel to a drainage that\npushes a small amount of material into the very margins of\nthe wetland.\nAnd the reason that the court didn't need to get\ninto this is, A, that it had made a legal finding to begin\nwith that soil disturbed within a wetland was a discharge,\nand B, that there was a factual dispute here about the\nextent to which we have pulled up the plows before we\nentered across from the upland to the -- to the wetland.\nAnd the court didn't want to deal with -- with that. And\nit didn't have to under this notion that if you disturb\nsoil within a wetland, that's an addition.\nSecond, I'd like to point out on page 8a of the\n-- of the Government's addendum the regulation about\nplowing. Plowing means all forms of primary tillage\nincluding moldboard, chisel, and wide-blade plowing,\ndiscing, harrowing, and similar means utilized on the farm\nto break up, cut, turn over, or stir the soil to prepare\nit for the planting of crops.\nQUESTION: What does primary mean?\nMR. BISHOP: Primary I think means just\npreparation. If you -- you have to go to the end and --\nand see -- it's soil -- to prepare the soil for the\nplanting of crops. Primary is the initial preparation of\nthe soil. You might contrast that, for example, with --\neven though harrowing is mentioned here, farmers\nunderstand that harrowing is actually a secondary form of\nland preparation. It's like a large rake that -- that\nclears the seed bed for -- for seeding. Primary is the\nfirst movement that prepares the soil for accepting the\ncrops.\nQUESTION: Why do you need the exception for it?\nThat's what puzzles me.\nMR. BISHOP: Well, you don't need an exception\nfor it. Our -- our position is that it's not a discharge\nand so -- and that Congress, if you read the 1972\nlegislative history -- I'm sorry to mention it, Justice\nScalia.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BISHOP: But it's clear that they did not\nintend to reach agricultural activity. The Corps in a\ndispute with the EPA made noises between '72 and '77\nabout, well, we're -- we're going to start regulating\nstock ponds and -- and ordinary farming activities. And\nCongress reacted to that by, as one commentator has said,\na provision that reflects the fact that it didn't think\nthat one stake through the heart of the vampire was\nenough. This is a belt and suspenders provision.\nBut what it does, as you remarked Justice\nScalia, is to provide an exemption for agricultural\nactivities that are discharges. It doesn't change the\ndefinition of point source, fill material, dredged\nmaterial, addition in any way. It doesn't change any of\nthe operative terms in the statute that we think mean this\nactivity is not a -- a discharge to begin with.\nAnd the exemption also mentions other\nactivities, seeding and cultivation and harvesting, that\njust are not -- I mean, these are not discharges. These\ndo not result in the addition of fill and dredged material\nfrom -- to the -- to the wetland. And -- and that is why\nthis structure is what's reflected in the regulations.\nThe regulation on page 8a. It says plowing, as described\nabove -- I mean, they purport to exclude what we did from\nthe definition of plowing, but plowing, as described\nabove, will never involve a discharge. It's not a\ndischarge to begin with. You don't get into the 404(f)\nexemption.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Bishop.\nMR. BISHOP: Thank you.\n"
