        "content": "(11:10 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in Buckeye Check Cashing v. Cardegna.\nMr. Landau.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER LANDAU\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. LANDAU: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis case presents the question whether a\nparty can avoid arbitration by challenging the validity\nof the underlying contract containing an arbitration\nclause as opposed to the arbitration clause itself.\nWe believe that this Court answered that\nquestion almost 40 years ago in Prima Paint. The\nFlorida Supreme Court tried to distinguish Prima Paint\non State law grounds, holding that the challenge at\nissue there, fraud in the inducement, would have\nrendered the contract voidable under State law, whereas\nthe challenge at issue here, illegality, would have\nrendered the contract void under State law.\nWe respectfully submit that this distinction\nmisses the point. Prima Paint held that a party cannot\navoid arbitration by challenging the validity of the\nunderlying contract as opposed to the arbitration\nclause because an embedded arbitration provision is\nseverable from the underlying contract as a matter of\nFederal substantive law. Thus, the nature of the State\nlaw ground, on which the underlying contract is\nchallenged, and the State law severability implications\nof that challenge are irrelevant.\nWhat matters, as a matter of Federal law, is\nthat a challenge to the underlying contract does not\nallow a court to deny arbitration. Rather, that\nchallenge must be presented to the arbitrator in the\nfirst instance. That point, we submit, is dispositive.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You -- you concede,\nthough, that if -- if the challenge to the underlying\ncontract implicates the arbitration clause as well,\nthat that is for the court and not the arbitrator.\nMR. LANDAU: Your Honor, we --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In other words, you\nknow, you put a gun to the person's head and say, sign\nthis contract, and the person does. It contains an\narbitration clause. They don't have to go to\narbitration to challenge that.\nMR. LANDAU: Your Honor, we concede that\nthere is asterisk, as we put it in our brief, to the\notherwise bright line rule set down in Prima Paint,\nthat rule being if you're challenging the arbitration\nclause, you can stay in court, but if you're\nchallenging the underlying contract, you have to go to\narbitration, precisely along the lines that Your Honor\nidentified where the challenge to the underlying\ncontract involves the parties' assents to the\nunderlying contract, that challenge necessarily\nchallenges your assent to arbitration. And given that\nthe whole premise of arbitration in the first place is\nthat it's a matter of consent, we would say that that\nparticular challenge, as the lower courts have\nrecognized since Prima Paint, an assent-based challenge\nto the underlying contract, is again an -- an exception\nor an asterisk to the otherwise bright line rule.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Does -- does that include a\nquarrel over offer and acceptance?\nMR. LANDAU: Your Honor, I think --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm -- we're trying to\nexplore the -- the meaning of -- of this -- of this\nassent. I know there are going to be hard cases, but I\nwant to try to see how we describe this area where it\nis for the court.\nMR. LANDAU: You're absolutely right, Your\nHonor, that there are going to be hard cases. If I\ncould just start by answering that by saying I think\none thing that's clear is that this case is not one of\nthe hard ones. The challenge to the underlying\ncontract here --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What about offer and\nacceptance?\nMR. LANDAU: I think generally when you're\nnot saying I didn't agree to the underlying contract,\nin other words, where you're not saying that's a\nforgery or the -- the person who signed that didn't\nhave authority, where you're -- where you're really --\nwhere you're not challenging factual agreement to the\nunderlying contract, then it's fair game to send you to\n-- to arbitration because when -- you factually agreed\nto -- to arbitrate.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You misinterpreted my\nletter. It was not an acceptance.\nMR. LANDAU: You misinterpreted my letter.\nThe -- there was no acceptance at all. I would think\nthat that's -- that would fall within the scope of this\npotential asterisk because you're basically saying I\nnever agreed to any contract at all. So, therefore, I\nwould think under those circumstances, the whole\npremise of the Prima Paint rule that -- that's once\nyou've agreed to arbitration, you can let the\narbitrator decide your grievances with the underlying\ncontract is not present.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, Prima Paint did,\nthough, involve what we would characterize as a\nvoidable contract.\nMR. LANDAU: Your Honor, that is not --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And I think it is\nconceivable that the Florida court was correct that you\ncould draw the line some way and say contracts that are\nvoid should be handled differently.\nMR. LANDAU: Your Honor, two responses to\nthat. At the most fundamental level, I think it misses\nthe point to talk about the nature or the -- the State\nlaw severability implications of your challenge to the\nunderlying contract because the insight to Prima Paint\nis that you treat the arbitration clause --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes, but voidness is a\nquestion of public policy. The State itself makes a\ndecision that certain contracts can't be entered into.\nAnd the question of voidability is usually one\naffecting the -- the will of the contracting party.\nMR. LANDAU: Your Honor, you're entirely\ncorrect, and I think again the -- the insight of Prima\nPaint is that you are perfectly able to present your\nchallenge to the underlying contract. The question is,\nwho is the person to -- which is the forum in which you\npresent that? Are you allowed to -- to present that in\ncourt or -- or are you relegated to -- or are you\nrequired to submit it to the arbitrator pursuant to\nyour agreement? And -- and I think the Prima Paint\ncourt recognized that if you allow parties to avoid\narbitration altogether by bringing whatever challenges\nthey may have to the underlying contract, whether it be\nfraud in the inducement or illegality or -- you know,\nthere are obviously any number of grounds for\nchallenging contracts under State law -- you\neffectively vitiate the arbitration agreement, the --\nthe whole point of which is that we're going to --\nwe've chosen the arbitrator as -- the arbitration as\nthe correct forum to resolve our dispute.\nAnd -- and so again, as long as you are not\nchallenging arbitration specifically -- the arbitration\nlaw specifically, then it's fair game to send you to\narbitration, again where you are perfectly entitled to\nraise the whole panoply of challenges that you may\nhave.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's -- it's a little odd\nthat --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Landau --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- the way our -- it's a\nlittle odd that the way our cases have -- have worked\nout is that we assume there's two contracts, one for\narbitration and the other for the rest of the\ncontracts. That's -- that's the way we've rationalized\nthese cases. It seems a little odd to me.\nMR. LANDAU: Well, Your Honor, again, I think\nthe -- the Federal Arbitration Act, both section 4 and\nsection 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act, certainly\npermits that -- that way of looking at it because\nsection 4, as Prima Paint emphasized, says, you know,\nonce the making of the arbitration agreement is clear,\nit must go to arbitration. And section 2 says it's the\narbitration provision in a written contract -- or the\nwritten provision in a contract that shall be valid and\nenforceable. And so, both those provisions do\ndistinguish between the arbitration provision\nspecifically and, in fact, treat it as an underlying\ncontract.\nAnd again, I don't think there's any shame in\nadmitting that Prima Paint, I think, recognized the\nimportant policy implications of a contrary rule, that\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Landau, maybe this --\nthis is a point your -- the respondent makes. Prima\nPaint talks about section 4 and it says, with respect\nto matters within the jurisdiction of the Federal\ncourts. So the answer to everything you said could be,\nfine, if this were proceeding in, say, the Southern\nDistrict of Florida, but it's in a State court. And\nPrima Paint just spoke about procedure in Federal\ncourt.\nMR. LANDAU: Your Honor, it is certainly true\nthat Prima Paint itself arose from Federal court and\nthat the decision is, I think, rather carefully written\nto talk about Federal courts as a -- in fact, Justice\nHarlan concurred in Prima Paint to say he would have\naffirmed the Second Circuit in that case on the basis\nof the Lawrence case, which said that this rule applies\nin Federal and State court, the FAA.\nBut the Court was obviously unwilling in\nPrima Paint to cross the bridge of saying that our rule\napplies in State court. And I think that, frankly,\nthat's why it's written in that way of -- of focusing\non section 4 and not really specifically addressing\nsection 2.\nThis Court, however, subsequently confronted\nthat issue head-on in the Southland case and held that\nthe substantive provisions of the Federal Arbitration\nAct, really relying on Prima Paint for the proposition\nthat the -- the Federal Arbitration Act does create\nFederal substantive law enacted under the commerce\npower -- it says that that rule -- those rules of\nsubstantive arbitration law apply in State as well as\nFederal court because you really wouldn't want to\nattribute to Congress kind of a -- a reverse Erie\npresumption of creating substantive Federal law that\napplied only in diversity cases in Federal court which\nwould then promote forum shopping between Federal and\nState courts.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- what's wrong\nwith the argument that when you're dealing with a void\ncontract, as opposed to a voidable one, that the State\npolicy is that you don't enforce any aspect of it? I\nmean, if you and I had, you know, a contract for murder\nand it had an arbitration clause, it's pretty strange\nto send that to an arbitrator and enforce part of that\ncontract as opposed to saying that the contract as a\nwhole is void.\nMR. LANDAU: Not really, Your Honor, in the\nsense that the -- the insight of Prima Paint, again, is\nthat you treat the arbitration clause as separate from\nthe underlying contract. So --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But we don't do that\nwith other provisions of void contracts. I mean, if\nour contract had a liquidated damages clause -- if you\ndidn't go ahead and murder somebody, you'd owe me\n$1,000 -- we don't say, well, that part is enforceable\neven if the contract as a whole is not enforceable. We\ntreat it as a whole. Because the subject matter of the\ncontract is illegal ab initio, the whole contract is --\nis void and illegal.\nMR. LANDAU: Your Honor, that is certainly\none plausible world view that one could have taken as\nan initial matter when confronting this issue. I mean,\nit's a little bit like a chicken and egg issue here.\nYou have got the underlying contract, which contains an\narbitration provision, and one could certainly say, as\nYour Honor just did, that well, if the underlying\ncontract falls, it seems perfectly sensible to say that\neverything falls. This Court specifically rejected\nthat approach in Prima Paint.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, you could say the\nsame thing about a voidable contract. You could say,\nyou know, the whole contract is voidable.\nMR. LANDAU: Well, in fact --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, in -- in that\nrespect, a contract that's void is no different from a\ncontract that's voidable.\nMR. LANDAU: In fact -- exactly. The -- in\nPrima Paint itself, it was far from clear that the\nrescission suit that was sought there -- in other\nwords, when a contract is -- is voidable, basically\nwhat that does is that -- under general common law\nprinciples, that creates an option for the aggrieved\nparty. And that party can either seek to affirm that\ncontract or it can seek to rescind that contract. And\nwhen you seek to rescind it, basically you're saying it\nwas void ab initio, which is exactly what Justice Black\nsaid in his dissent in Prima Paint.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You also run into a\nproblem with the -- some States classify a contract as\nvoidable and other States for that same ground make it\nvoid. So at least you would have -- you would lose the\nuniformity if you've made the distinction between those\ntwo.\nMR. LANDAU: You are absolutely right, Your\nHonor, and I don't think this Court should lose sight\nof the bright line importance of the Prima Paint rule.\nBut in a sense, Prima Paint again is a rule of Federal\nlaw. The Court in that case specifically affirmed the\nFederal law approach taken by the First Circuit as\nopposed to the State law approach, which I think was a\nlittle bit like Your Honor's hypothetical, the Chief\nJustice's hypothetical.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do we usually -- do\nwe usually ask arbitrators to enforce broader notions\nof public policy as opposed to the specific agreements\nof the party? In other words, if the reason the\ncontract is void or voidable has to do with broad State\npublic policy, do we -- what -- what's this -- the best\nyou case you have for the notion that arbitrators\nenforce those types of constraints as opposed to\nfiguring out what the parties agreed to?\nMR. LANDAU: Oh, sure, Your Honor. I think\nif you think about the Mitsubishi case, all the cases\nthat sent statutory cases to arbitrators and said that,\nyou know, RICO claims or antitrust claims could be\narbitrated, I think initially the -- the argument that\nwas made against that was precisely the one Your Honor\nis making, that, gee, arbitrators have expertise in the\nspecific commercial agreements here, but we don't\nexpect them to be knowledgeable about RICO or -- or\nother statutes.\nBut I think the insight of the cases, really\nover the last 30 years in this Court, is that\narbitrators are perfectly able and certainly have to be\npresumed to be able to decide legal and public policy\nquestions.\nAnd I think if you -- again, if you go the\nother way and you say, well, we're going to allow\nchallenges to the arbitration clause, we're not going\nto allow it to be enforced, I think you are really\ngoing to declare open season on arbitration in the\nsense that it is -- as a logical matter, there is no\nway to limit the principle that the other side is\nproposing to challenges based on illegality, which is\nwhat they've tried to -- to cabin this off as.\nBasically -- and I think the Florida Supreme\nCourt was very forthright about this -- they said it's\nany challenge that leads to the contract being void as\na matter of State law. And in fact, the -- the\nrespondents in their brief in this Court really admit\nthat it's any challenge that goes to contract\nformation, the formation at all of the underlying\ncontract. So they would presumably sweep in all things\nlike consideration, mutuality, anything that could be a\nground for that.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What would be the issues\nfor the arbitrator in this case? Is there anything\nother than was it -- was this interest usurious? The\ndispute between the parties -- we're not told what the\nissues are that would be subject to arbitration.\nMR. LANDAU: That is the key issue, Your\nHonor. They are essentially saying that the underlying\ninterest in the contract is usurious, in violation of\nseveral Florida statutes.\nAnd again, one thing that is important to\nkeep in mind is that there is no question that these\nissues now, the practices that they're complaining\nabout, are entirely legal in Florida today. There was\nan act passed in 2001 that clearly made all this legal.\nThe only issue is they're saying it was illegal prior\nto enactment of that statute and whether or not that\nstatute clarified the law or changed the previous law.\nBut presumably the arbitrator would be asked\nto decide is -- was the law in Florida prior to 2001\nsuch that -- that these other statutes that limited --\nthat limited interest applied here. The underlying\ndispute is really about whether these charges are\ninterest or whether it's a service fee for cashing a\ncheck. That's the heart of the underlying dispute, and\nthat's certainly one that the arbitrator is capable of\ndeciding --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Did the arbitrator --\nMR. LANDAU: -- looking to Florida --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Could the arbitrator decide\nthat I'm -- I'm going to apply the new statute rather\nthan the old one?\nMR. LANDAU: Well, I think the arbitrator\nwill say, you know -- first of all, if I could just\nmake one point clear for the record. The -- this --\nthe underlying issue here, whether or not this 2001\nstatute changed the law or simply clarified the law is\ncurrently pending in the Florida Supreme Court. It was\nargued on -- on September 30th in -- in a case that did\nnot involve arbitration.\nSo presumably, the arbitrator, if this case\ngoes to arbitration, will look at that case and will\ndecide whether or not that governs this case, will\ndecide is there any ground for distinguishing this\ncase.\nAnd -- and, you know, one point to remember\nis that when you go to arbitration, that's not the end\nof the line. You have rights to judicial review of\narbitration.\nSo going back to your hypothetical, Mr. Chief\nJustice, if the -- if the contract were to be, let's\nsay, for murder -- that's a favorite example of -- of\nrespondents -- that does not mean that a contract for\nmurder gets enforced. That means that the arbitrator\nwill decide whether the contract for murder is -- is\nvalid under State law and -- again, this is in the\nfarfetched situation where somebody who has signed a\ncontract for murder is actually trying to enforce\narbitration, you know, presumably from his or her jail\ncell --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. LANDAU: -- and then would -- would try\nto enforce arbitration, and then if -- you know, if the\narbitrator says it's illegal, would -- you know, even\nif the arbitrator were, in the most fanciful situation,\nto say, yes, this contract for murder is legal under\nthe law of our State, well, then presumably you could\ngo up for manifest disregard review. There are\nsafeguards in the process.\nWhat they're trying to do is short-circuit\nthe process, and I think this goes back to Justice\nGinsburg's question. The -- what they are now\ndescribing as the threshold issue of contract formation\n-- contract validity is not a threshold issue at all.\nIt's what this whole dispute is about. It is what they\nare challenging here. They are saying these contracts\nare illegal because they charge too much interest, that\nwhat they're charging is in fact interest and that was\nillegal.\nWell, they are now saying that the -- the\ncourt should decide that underlying question as a\nthreshold matter. Well, then there's actually nothing\nwhatsoever left for the arbitrator to decide, and they\nhave effectively vitiated the arbitration agreement.\nAnd again --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, no, that's not\ntrue. There may be dozens of other subsidiary issues\napart from illegality. They may say, well, once you\ndetermine that it's legal, we think that we're entitled\nto these damages or those damages or -- or the rate\nshould be this or that. Just because there's a\nthreshold issue doesn't mean there aren't other issues\nthat an arbitrator might decide.\nMR. LANDAU: Well, Your Honor, I -- I guess\nmaybe it depends on how you look at the word threshold.\nI mean, I would think that that is the core issue in\nthe dispute. I mean, certainly there -- you are\nabsolutely right that there could be some ancillary\nissues like damages.\nBut clearly, the -- the nub, the crux of\ntheir challenge here is a challenge to the legality of\nthe underlying contract. And under their view, they\nget to obtain judicial resolution of that issue in the\nfirst instance, notwithstanding the fact that they\ndon't dispute that they agreed to arbitrate all issues\nrelating not only to the validity of the arbitration\nclause itself, but relating to the underlying contract.\nSo there's no question here -- and I think\nthis is really important not to lose sight of -- that\nthis dispute falls within the plain language of their\narbitration provision. If you look at joint appendix\n42, the arbitration provision here is very broadly\nworded in this regard, and the parties clearly agreed\nto do it. The only question is basically whether the\nState could frustrate the -- the plain, express intent\nof the parties by saying, oh, well, this challenge\nimplicates arbitration -- implicates legality.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If the case was one in\nwhich the merits issue you claim is basically the same\nas the legality issue under the contract -- but would\nyour argument be as strong if it were different, if you\nhad a different reason for claiming that the contract\nwas void or voidable?\nMR. LANDAU: The -- I think the argument,\nYour Honor, would be the same. It's just -- it's a\nparticularly stark illustration here of the dangers of\nthe -- of -- of that position. It may not -- you're\nabsolutely right. It may not always be the case that\nthe -- that the challenge to the contract is going to\nbe the merits dispute in itself, but I think where, as\nhere, it is, it really shows how pernicious this rule\nis and precisely why the Prima Paint rule, which again\nhas been in effect almost 40 years now -- why that\napproach works and actually promotes the policy\nsupporting arbitration.\nAnd when you -- again, when you think of an\nalternative rule, it's one in which you could come in\n-- the party who has concededly agreed to an\narbitration clause and says, well, I think the\nunderlying contract is void on public policy grounds,\nwhich again you can make in virtually any case. Under\nthe Florida Supreme Court's rationale in this Court --\nin this case, that is a basis for remaining in court,\nand --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What about the possibility\nthat you always want a neutral decision-maker in cases\nlike this? The arbitrator always has an interest in\nfinding that the contract is valid and arbitrable\nbecause that's his source of business is arbitrating\ndisputes.\nMR. LANDAU: Your Honor, you -- I think it's\nimportant to keep in mind that in this case, they have\nnot challenged the arbitrator. The reason --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No. I'm just talking about\nas a general matter if we're trying to decide the issue\nnot just on these facts, but what is the better rule --\nMR. LANDAU: Your Honor, I don't -- I think\nthat's -- again, that -- if you were to have a\npresumption that the arbitrator is always in favor of\nupholding a contract, that would seem somewhat in\ntension at the very --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. I mean, the\nquestion is, I take it, in most of the arbitration\nassociations, once you have arbitration, you will get\npaid even though -- the arbitrator will be paid, won't\nhe, whether --\nMR. LANDAU: Oh, yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- he decides one way or the\nother?\nMR. LANDAU: Oh, I'm sorry. Then yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So he has no particular\ninterest in getting paid in upholding the contract or\nnot.\nMR. LANDAU: You're absolutely right, Your\nHonor. That is absolutely clear. And -- and again, I\nwould think he would not have an interest in -- in\nsaying that a contract for murder is perfectly valid.\nYou're absolutely right. It wouldn't get him more\nmoney in his pocket and it certainly would, I think,\nlead to the reputation of a rogue arbitrator out there\nwho is not to be trusted. And -- and presumably that\nperson wouldn't -- wouldn't get much business.\nAgain, so I think that the key point here is\nthat the respondents have tried to create a lot of\nState law issues regarding void, voidable. And -- and\nI think as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, the problem is\nit's kind of like trying to put a square peg in a round\nhole, that whether something is void or voidable under\nState law, which may vary from State to State, kind of\nmisses the whole point which is the genius of a Federal\nseparability rule is we don't care about those State\nlaw issues. You don't have to get into that bog to\ndecide the arbitrability question or the -- you know,\nyou cannot avoid arbitration by simply coming up with\nall those grounds. And whether it's ground A for\nchallenging the underlying contract and whatever the\nseverability implications may be of ground A or ground\nB, the point is when you're not challenging the\narbitration clause, it's fair game to send you to\narbitration, and then you can raise ground A or ground\nB or whatever ground you have before the arbitrator.\nAnd it's simply not a basis for avoiding arbitration\naltogether to be talking about that.\nAnd again, the -- the point -- I think this\nis all kind of a common-sensical point that you want to\nget parties quickly to arbitration. I mean, if you --\nif you have a situation where the parties have to spend\nyears in court litigating these kind of issues, that\nreally, in and of itself, defeats the whole point of --\nof arbitration.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, Prima Paint certainly\ndisplaced the States and State law from this area in a\nvery substantial -- to a very substantial extent.\nI'm curious now. Have there been any\nattempts in Congress to overrule Prima Paint?\nMR. LANDAU: I'm not aware of any, Your\nHonor. And to the contrary, I think the Federal\nArbitration Act has been amended multiple times since\n1967 and it has always been in a pro-arbitration\ndirection, as this Court emphasized in the Allied-Bruce\ncase where there was a concerted attack not on Prima\nPaint, but on Southland.\nAnd in a sense, Southland is really a -- a\nreflection of Prima Paint because Southland simply says\nthat the -- the substantive Federal arbitration law\nthat was announced in Prima Paint sensibly should not\nbe limited to Federal court, but should also apply in\nState court.\nSo I think the -- the Court faced a fork in\nthe road in Prima Paint about the meaning of the\nFederal Arbitration Act. Was it just a procedural\nprovision that governed in -- in Federal proceedings\nbased on Congress' power over the Federal courts and\ntheir procedures? Or was it a substantive provision\nenacted under the Commerce Clause? And this Court took\nthe latter approach and made that absolutely crystal\nclear in -- in Southland and then later again in\nAllied-Bruce.\nAnd so what I think the respondents are\nreally asking you to do here is to really overrule root\nand branch the whole Federal substantive law of\narbitrability altogether and say, well, this should\njust be -- you took the wrong path back in 1967 and --\nand you should just interpret the FAA to be a -- a\nprocedural statute. We would respectfully submit that\nthat would cause an earthquake in the law in terms of\narbitration and, therefore, would respectfully urge you\nto reverse the Supreme Court of Florida's judgment.\nI'd like to reserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nLandau.\nMr. Bland.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF F. PAUL BLAND, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. BLAND: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThis Court has repeatedly said that Federal\nlaw preempts State law only where Congress clearly and\nmanifestly intended for it to do so. And the Court has\nalso repeatedly said that the best guide to what\nCongress intended was the language of the statutes.\nNow, petitioners have not pointed to any\nlanguage of the Federal Arbitration Act itself that\nwould create a separability rule for this case. And\nmoreover, the language of the act itself and\nparticularly section 2 -- and particularly section 2\nthe way it was followed in the Prima Paint case --\nactually strongly supports us. Section 2 says that an\narbitration provision is enforceable if it is in a\ncontract evidencing interstate commerce.\nNow, to order of arbitration, they say, well,\nthe -- the threshold issue is whether there's an\nagreement. Let's have the arbitrator decide that. To\norder arbitration is to enforce the act. That is\nenforcing the act. But they want to enforce the act\nbefore we've determined if section 2 is met, before the\nrequirements of section 2 are met. That's not the way\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess what they\nwould say is that there -- they insist only that the\nagreement be to arbitrate, and to the extent there is\nan agreement to arbitrate, they can enforce section 2,\nand the arbitrator can decide whether the broader\nagreement is enforceable.\nMR. BLAND: That's an argument. The word\nagreement was used in section 4, and that's the -- that\nprovision, of course, is the provision that refers only\nto the -- not only applies to the United States\ndistrict courts, that refers to jurisdiction under\ntitle 28 and twice refers to the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure, and that in the Southland case in footnote\n10, this Court said doesn't apply in the State courts.\nSection 2 doesn't use the word agreement.\nSection 2 uses the word contract, Mr. Chief Justice.\nAnd the word contract is a very different idea than\nagreement. If section 2 had said an agreement in\ninterstate commerce or a transaction in interstate\ncommerce, perhaps they would have a point. But the\nCourt, instead, used -- excuse me. The Congress,\ninstead, used the word contract. Contract is one of\nthe most important words in the law.\nNow, when the Court in Prima Paint looked at\nthis, in the first sentence, the very first sentence of\nPrima Paint, the Court said this case involves a\ncontract involving the U.S. Arbitration Act. And in\nthe first sentence, the Court said this case is a case\ninvolving contracting parties. The Court didn't say\nwe're going to see what the arbitrator thinks as to\nwhether there's a contract.\nIn Prima Paint, this Court did it the right\nway. They said section 2 -- does it apply first? Only\nif it does apply, only if once after we have crossed\nthat Rubicon will we go to the next step.\nThen the Court in Prima Paint goes and\ndiscusses whether or not the interstate commerce prong\nhas been met. And there's a long discussion of is this\nin interstate commerce or not, and they find that it\nis.\nWell, under their theory, under petitioner's\ntheory, why should the Court be deciding interstate\ncommerce? Arbitrator -- the interstate commerce issue\ngoes to the whole contract. Why shouldn't the\narbitrator decide the interstate commerce issue?\nJUSTICE BREYER: When I was working on the\nfirst options in those cases, I thought there was from\nSouthland a pretty clear distinction between whether\nthe person is attacking the arbitration clause itself.\nIf he says that's not valid, that probably goes to the\ncourt, unless there's some other special thing. But if\nwhat he's doing is attacking the rest of the contract\nas illegal, that doesn't. That goes to the arbitrator.\nNow, I really did think that was the law.\nAnd even if I was wrong in thinking that was the law,\nit seems to me the whole community, the whole business\ncommunity in the United States thinks it's the law.\nEverybody else thinks it's the law, and the briefs on\nyour side don't even say that it isn't the law, except\nfor yours. They say go and overrule the cases that\nmake it the law.\nMR. BLAND: We -- we do not in any way urge\nthis Court to overturn -- the Court does not need to\noverturn Southland, Your Honor. And let me make two\npoints about Southland.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, logically you're\nright. I accept all that you're saying logically. You\ncould make those distinctions, but you also could come\nout the other way logically. And so to expose to you\nwhat's really bothering me about the case are two\nthings.\nOne, I think you're worried about consumer\ncontracts, and there are a lot of good arguments on\nyour side.\nBut this rule also applies to business\ncontracts, and there what's bothering me is that --\nthat the whole business community seems to have\ndeveloped an arbitration system throughout the world\nthat depends upon the distinction I just made. And if\nwe decide for you, we're going to throw a large section\nof those contracts back into the laws of the 50 States\nand arbitration will be seriously injured as the\ncommercial community has come to rely on it.\nNow, that's what's worrying me because I\nwouldn't want to reach a decision, in the absence of it\nbeing clear anyway, that would make a significant\nnegative difference to the gross national product of\nthe United States, for example.\nMR. BLAND: Well, Your Honor, let -- before I\ngo on with the statutory arguments --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm putting it dramatically\nbecause I want to get your --\nMR. BLAND: -- let me -- before I talk about\nthe statutory arguments, then let me go to the policy\narguments and this idea that we're going to open the\nflood gates and undermine the Federal Arbitration Act.\nIt is a minimal requirement to say that you\nmust have a contract in interstate commerce. And in\nthe Southland case, on page 10, at the bottom of page\n10 and page 11, before it said that section 2 would\napply in States, Chief Justice Burger's opinion for\nthis Court started off and said there -- we perceive\ntwo limitations on arbitration -- on the enforceability\nof arbitration provisions. And the first of those is\nit does have to be in a contract in interstate\ncommerce. So there is nothing in Southland that said,\noh, well, the question about whether or not there's a\ncontract is something the arbitrator gets to decide.\nThe beginning of the opinion said that particular issue\nis one for the -- is one that is a limitation on the\nenforceability of contracts.\nIs this going to lead to an explosion of\nlitigation over the formation of contracts? It will\nnot because there are fairly few cases where there is\nan argument that the entire contract is void ab initio\nsuch that it comes up.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Every usury case, for\nexample. That's very few? I mean, that's a lot of\ncases.\nMR. BLAND: After the National Banking Act,\nYour Honor, there are actually very few usury cases\nleft. If you look at the six cases they cite that are\nall -- they say they're Federal. There are six Federal\ncourt of appeals decisions that support them. Four of\nthose are payday lending cases decided since 2000. The\nprincipal economic effect of this case actually is\ngoing to involve the payday lending industry.\nAnd was it irrational for the State of\nFlorida to say that it's loan-sharking to charge people\nup to 1300 percent interest? We think that that --\nwhether -- whether Florida made a good decision or not\nwith its usury laws, usury laws just don't apply to\nmany cases.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What about fraud in the\ninducement?\nMR. BLAND: Fraud in the inducement does not\ngo to rendering the contract void ab initio. A\ncontract comes into existence. You cross the statutory\nlanguage of section 2. Fraud in the inducement --\nthere is a contract. Now one party has a defense to\nit. Suppose --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Bland.\nMR. BLAND: -- Your Honor --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Bland, some State may\nsay fraud in the inducement is void. These -- these\nare classifications that States make. These are labels\nthat the State puts on them. And you are introducing\nvast disuniformity if you say that the line to draw is\nbetween void and voidable. You are forced into that\nbecause the Prima Paint case dealt with voidable. So\nyou -- that you -- you are drawing a line between void\nand voidable which shifts from State to State.\nMR. BLAND: Well, the -- the -- Your Honor,\nfirst, the Congress drew the line when it said that you\nhad to have a contract first as to whether or not a\ncontract came into existence.\nBut the law of contracts does not differ so\nmuch from State to State. This case in the American\nAirlines v. -- this Court -- excuse me -- in the\nAmerican Airlines v. Wolens case said that the law of\ncontracts is not largely disuniform from State to\nState, and there is no State in the country that I know\nof -- and I'm fairly certain of this -- that hold that\nfraud in the inducement means that a contract never\ncame into existence.\nAnd the reason for that is -- is that if\nsomeone defrauds me into buying a stock or someone has\nan unconscionable deal or almost any of the other\nthings that give rise to defenses to formed contracts,\none party has an option to get of out it. If someone\ndefrauds me into buying a stock but then the stock\nprice shoots up through the roof -- it's one of Justice\nBreyer's clever technology inventions that works --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BLAND: -- I have an option at that point\nto hold onto the stock, even though I was defrauded. I\nwas defrauded. I was cheated, but I'm happy with it.\nIt turns out it's okay. It is left to the option --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But almost every\nState --\nMR. BLAND: -- of the party.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- almost ever State\nwill -- has an exception for contracts that are void\nagainst public policy. And it's just left to the\ncreativity of the lawyer in any given case to explain\nwhy a particular contract is contrary to public policy.\nAnd you would allow that to be shifted from the\narbitrators to court presumably based simply on an\nallegation, well, the contract is void, it's against\npublic policy.\nMR. BLAND: I think you will find, Your\nHonor, if you look at the -- at the law that's\ndeveloped around void ab initio contracts, that it's\nfairly rare. It's a fairly small universe of cases\nwhere State courts have found that an entire line of\nbusiness is illegal, where State courts have found that\nno contract ever comes into existence because of a\npublic policy.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But if you open the door\n-- if you open the door -- public policy has been\ncalled an unruly horse. All you have to do is open the\ndoor and you will have litigation in court, and then\nthe court will decide what the arbitrator would other\n-- otherwise decide.\nMR. BLAND: But, Your Honor, there are\nalready a host of circumstances in which litigants\nwould like to be able to get out of contracts that do\nnot involve arbitration clauses, where they would like\nto be able to argue that no contract came into\nexistence in the first place.\nAnd the public policy typically -- and in\nFlorida particularly -- tends to be linked to statutes.\nIn most States, there is a rule that says of contract\nlaw, that we will not void a contract because some\njudge feels there's a public policy, but it has to be\nbased on a statute. And we cited several cases, and\nthe law professors in Professor Alderman and Braucher's\nbrief cited a variety of cases around the country in\nwhich courts have only struck down contracts for public\npolicy where they violated a statute that forbid\nequality.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You're giving the end\nresult. How many cases have the lawyers gone into\ncourt and said, court, strike down this contract\nbecause it's against public policy? Courts may reject\nmany of those, but --\nMR. BLAND: Well, I think there's no reason\nto suspect that there's going to be abuse in which\nparties are going to come in and make frivolous\narguments that an entire line of business is illegal\nand then -- and that that's going to cause a flood gate\nof cases into courts because courts have, with rule 11\nand other similar rules, a lot of ways of getting rid\nof those.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, what about --\nMR. BLAND: It's very hard --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You get rid of them after\nfrustrating the arbitration provision, the whole\npurpose of which is to keep you out of courts.\nI'd like to -- I'd like to ask you about your\nargument on section 2, which --\nMR. BLAND: Please.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- appears at page 3 of the\npetitioner's brief. If you want to read it the way\nyou're reading it, you say a written provision in a\ncontract evidencing a transaction involving commerce.\nYou say that has to be a -- a contract that is a valid\ncontract.\nWell, what do you do about the end of section\n2 which says, shall be valid, irrevocable, and\nenforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or\nin equity for the revocation of any contract? That\nwould apply to -- to contracts that are not -- not void\nbut voidable.\nMR. BLAND: Exactly, and that's the language\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So Southland was wrong.\nMR. BLAND: No. With all respect, Your\nHonor, that's the language that -- that the\nseparability rule in Prima Paint has been used to apply\nto. The first part of section 2 says this is how you\ncreate an arbitration provision. You have an\nenforceable provision if it's in a contract, but there\nis an exception for general State contract laws that\nprovide defenses to a contract.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why?\nMR. BLAND: That --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why would you make that --\nthat weird distinction --\nMR. BLAND: Because that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- and treat the first part\nof it as though it applies across the board to the\nentire contract, but the last part of it, reading it\ndifferently? I -- I don't understand that.\nMR. BLAND: The first part of it is the way\nyou -- the way you trigger the existing forceability\noption at all is that it has to be in a contract in\ninterstate commerce. That's why in Prima Paint the\nCourt went through interstate commerce rather than\nleaving that for the arbitrator.\nThe second part is once you have an\nenforceable agreement, it may be subject to certain\ndefenses.\nAnd then in Prima Paint, what this Court did\nwas it looked at section 4 of the act and it derived\nfrom section 4 of the act, the one that only applies in\nFederal court and refers to the Federal Rules of\nJudicial Procedure, a rule of separability for these\nkinds of defenses, for the defenses that arise in the\nSavings Clause.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me even if you\nseparate it, you still have the language, save upon\nsuch grounds that exist in law or in equity for the\nrevocation of any contract. Unless you take that\nlanguage, the reference to contract in section 2, as\nreferring to two separate things, the contract without\nthe -- without the arbitration clause and the\narbitration clause alone, it seems to me section 2\ndoesn't make any sense.\nMR. BLAND: With all respect, Your Honor, I\nthink that the way that it makes sense is that the --\nyou get the threshold issue of getting through the\nlimitation, as this Court described it in Southland on\npages 10 and 11, of the limitation on the\nenforceability of arbitration clauses of is it in a\ncontract in the first place. That is the -- what the\nfirst part is talking about.\nThen separately the Court -- the -- the\nCongress had intended only a limited intrusion into\nState law, as this Court said in the Volt case where it\nsaid that this -- that there was not -- this is not the\nNational Bank Act. There was no field preemption.\nThere was no express preemption. There was only\nconflict preemption.\nAnd in the Allied-Bruce case, what Justice\nBreyer's opinion for the Court said was we recognize\nthat State law will play an important role for certain\ncontract defenses after the contract has first been\nfound to be enforceable.\nI think that if -- if this jurisdictional\nidea -- the way you get into the Arbitration Act, what\ntriggers that the Arbitration Act exists -- and this is\npretty much the language that's used at the -- in the\nbottom of 10 and top of 11 of Southland -- is that you\nhave an arbitration agreement that's enforceable. Then\nthere is a but in which Congress left out an\nalternative where you have specific challenges to how\nthe arbitration clause is formed. I think that that's\na very workable system, but that's also the way\nCongress drafted the statute.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's not -- the workability\nof it depends on how many challenges you get to people\nsaying this contract is void, you know. And if there\nare a lot of them, then that takes a whole wide set of\ncases out of arbitration and puts them into the courts,\njust where they're trying to escape. And -- and so I\ndon't know the answer to how many, to be truthful, and\nI suspect no one does.\nSo I'm wondering if there isn't another route\nto the problem you're getting at, which is, as I think\nin other countries, you say there's a doctrine of\nkompetenz-kompetenz. You know that? You know what I'm\nthinking of?\nMR. BLAND: No, I'm afraid I do not, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's arbitration generally.\nThey don't even look to see whether people agreed\nabout the arbitration clause. It says arbitration. It\ngoes to arbitration regardless.\nNow, the safeguard is, A, maybe the\narbitrator will get it right or, B, if the arbitrator\ndoesn't get it right, they have to come to court to\nenforce it. And at that point, you could say, you\nknow, this arbitrator is out to lunch. Our cases say\nhe has to be really out to lunch, but you could make\nsome distinctions there, you see. And -- and if this\nis really a problem that arbitrators are upholding\nillegal contracts, that might be the place to begin to\nmake the distinctions. Say, Judge, look at this a\nlittle more closely where it's illegal, the whole\ncontract, et cetera.\nWhat do you think?\nMR. BLAND: I -- I think two things, Your\nHonor. First, I'd like to say that I think an enormous\ndifference between the European illustrations, for\nexample, that you give in this setting is that here the\nFederal Arbitration Act is not a common law rule of\nlet's push as many cases as we can from the civil\njustice system into arbitration. It is a statute that\nhas language. And the way this Court has treated that\nlanguage before is this Court has always said not until\nthe case falls within section 2 will you then go and\nenforce section 2, that you have to be in the act\nbefore you apply the act.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If we take --\nMR. BLAND: And I think that that language is\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- if we take, Mr. Bland,\nwhat you said so -- the words transaction involving\ncommerce, but a contract -- okay. So you spoke about\nvoid contracts. Well, what about there's not enough\nconsideration, things that go to the formation? So\nthis contract was never formed. So --\nMR. BLAND: Those are issues that we believe\nalso are issues that a court would resolve. I think,\nYour Honor, that there are very few --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So we're going far -- far\nbeyond a void subject matter like usury. But you could\nsay there -- there wasn't sufficient consideration.\nThere was no mutuality or things that go to the\nformation of a contract.\nMR. BLAND: I think that when Your Honor used\nthe word far, that that -- that that is not really\nfair. There are really very, very few contracts in the\nUnited States of America in 2005 that are going to be\nstruck down because there wasn't enough consideration.\nThat sort of argument against contract formation very\nrarely comes up. I do a ton of consumer contract\ncases. We've never gotten rid of a contract on the\ngrounds there wasn't consideration.\nThese doctrines are on the books. They are\ncertainly part of what makes a contract different from\nan agreement. It's certainly one of the reasons why I\nthink it's important that Congress chose such a loaded\nword, but these -- there are very few cases that\ninvolve this.\nAnd -- and one thing about the -- about the\nillegal issue and the voidability -- the -- the void ab\ninitio issue that Your Honor raises. In Florida -- and\nwe cited a number of cases of this in our brief and in\nthe -- in -- both in our brief and -- and in the\ncontract law professors' amicus brief, there's a number\nof cases around the country. You only strike down a\ncontract as void ab initio where the principal purpose,\nthe essence of the contract is that -- that it was to\ndo an illegal purpose, was that it was to violate a\nstatute as reflected in -- as -- as it would reflect\nthe public policy of a State. You could have a\ncontract that has one or two illegal provisions or\nminor legal provisions. Those are not enough to get\nthe entire contract thrown out as void ab initio. It's\na much higher test.\nIf I can use an analogy. There may be a lot\nof people who wish they weren't married, but meeting\nthe tests of annulment are very different from divorce.\nTrying to prove that a contract is void ab initio such\nthat it is so extremely illegal that no provision of it\nwill come into contract doesn't come up very often.\nWhat we are talking about with void ab initio\ncontracts that violate public policies and statutes are\nwe are talking about businesses that are skirting\naround on the edge of legality. We are talking about a\nbusiness where there is a colorable argument that\nsomeone can go into court and say, this entire line of\nbusiness is loan-sharking. It's a crime. It's 29\ntimes the -- the felony rate of loan-sharking in\nFlorida. That's why so many of these cases are payday\nlending cases. You don't see a lot of void ab initio\ncases in which come -- someone comes in and say, hey,\nyou know, they sold me a car and the entire line of\nbusiness of car selling was void ab initio.\nThe only example that's supposed to show the\nflood gates that has come from petitioner's brief is\nthey cite to this Vacation Beach case in Florida. And\nwhat -- that was a case that involved was sort of a\nuniquely Florida problem, but after a bunch of\nhurricanes, they've had people come down who were\nunlicensed contractors and they go and say we know how\nto fix roofs and so forth and they do not. And then\npeople's roofs blow off, and there have actually been a\nnumber of people who have died.\nSo the State set up a licensing regime that\nwas a licensing regime not designed to extort money\nfrom businesses, but a licensing regime designed --\nscheme based on safety and health and welfare of the\ncitizens and said, you can't go into this line of\nbusiness without passing certain certifications.\nSo in that case, it was a declaratory\njudgment action in which a company -- in which a\ncompany comes in and says, this company is falsely\nrepresenting they know how to do this work and they\ndon't. And in fact, the court of appeals notes it\ncould be a crime.\nAnd now petitioner comes in and says, well,\nthis is an outrage. Of course, the arbitrator should\ndecide that question in the first place. No. That's a\nbusiness that is arguably -- and probably more than\narguably -- operating on the outskirts of the law.\nTheir reliance interests are different.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But there's no -- but\n-- but why do you assume that that underlying\nillegality taints the arbitration clause? I mean, take\nthe arbitration clause that you would find in a\nperfectly normal contract, and if you put it in the --\nthe contract of the sort that you're hypothesizing, I\ndon't see why this underlying substance of the contract\ntaints the enforceability of the arbitration clause.\nMR. BLAND: Because -- because the language\nof the statute is what draws the key link difference to\nme, Your Honor. The statute says an arbitration\nprovision is enforceable if it is in a contract\nevidencing interstate commerce. The in a contract\nmakes the legality of the whole contract -- for the\ncontract comes into existence. You can't drive this\ncar until you start it, and the way that the Federal\nArbitration Act works is it becomes enforceable once\nthose terms are met.\nUnder their theory, there's no good reason\nwhy in Prima Paint this Court spent all those pages\ntalking about whether interstate commerce was met. Why\nwasn't that for the arbitrator? The reason that that\nwasn't for the arbitrator was that was something that\nwent to the threshold issue of whether section 2 had\nbeen met.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you saying then if\nthis case, the case that was brought in Florida, had\nbeen brought or removed in -- more likely removed\nbecause there was diversity, removed to the Federal\ncourt, the Federal court should do just what the\nFlorida Supreme Court did? Or would the Federal court\nsay, well, we've got our instructions from Prima Paint?\nIt says excise the arbitration clause. If that's\nokay, we decide the other questions.\nMR. BLAND: Your Honor, in this case I\nbelieve that the answer is that you would have the same\nresult in State court or in Federal court. And the\nreason I believe that is because section 2 makes the\nexistence of a contract a precondition, and you don't\nget to anything else if that is not met.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Doesn't it -- doesn't it\nfollow from -- from that theory of yours that in every\ncase you are entitled to a judicial determination, not\nan arbitrator's determination, but a judicial\ndetermination that this was a contract evidencing a\ntransaction involving commerce?\nMR. BLAND: Yes, we do believe that, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wow. So in every -- every\ncase, the person who -- who is being brought to\narbitration can say, I deny that interstate commerce is\ninvolved in -- in this -- in this contract and I want\nto have a -- a judicial determination of it.\nMR. BLAND: And of course, in the Efabco case\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I mean, that's --\nMR. BLAND: Well, that -- this Court 2 years\nago in 2003 in the Efabco case, the Alabama Supreme\nCourt had developed a practice of finding that lots of\ncontracts didn't involve interstate commerce and\ninterstate commerce didn't reach to a lot of things.\nAnd this Court just 2 years ago said this is an issue\nfor the court and there is interstate commerce here and\nthey -- they -- and this Court -- I can't remember the\nphrase -- per curiam. There was no need for an\nargument or whatever. The Court just came in and\nresolved it --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You said this was an issue\nfor the court. Was there an alternate forum in that\ncase? Was it an arbitration case?\nMR. BLAND: This was an arbitration case, and\nthe Alabama Supreme Court had said that we're not going\nto enforce the Federal Arbitration Act, and Alabama is\none of the three States that has -- that has a State\nstatute that bars it.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I had thought that the\ninterstate commerce question was like Crowell v.\nBenson. You know, it's like a constitutional fact.\nAnd in fact, if you can't -- if there's not the\nconstitutional -- if there's not the connection with\ninterstate commerce, Congress, at least arguably, would\nlack the constitutional power to tell the State court\nwhat to do in this case. So it's not as surprising if\nthere is a difference between that kind of fact and the\nkind of fact that goes to whether the -- the contract\nis void ab initio.\nMR. BLAND: But it -- but it is also a\nstatutory fact, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, it is. It's both.\nMR. BLAND: It's a fact that the statute says\nboth. It is a constitutional fact. I certainly\nconcede that.\nJustice Ginsburg, I believe I did not answer\n-- I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The question isn't whether\nthe court can -- can determine that fact. Ultimately,\nif the arbitrator determines it incorrectly, you can\ntake it to court. But the question is whether in every\narbitration case, you can go immediately to court to\nhave that question of interstate commerce or not\ndetermined. And that would really throw a monkey\nwrench into the whole system, it seems to me.\nMR. BLAND: Your Honor, it's -- it would not\nthrow a monkey wrench because it's exactly what\nhappened in Prima Paint. In Prima Paint, this Court\nstarted off and before it enforced the Arbitration Act,\nbefore it got into what it called the main issue and\nstarted talking about what does section 4 mean, this\nCourt first went and did the entire interstate commerce\nanalysis. This Court said, we've got to figure out if\nwe're in section 2 first and described that. It's not\nthe monkey wrench. It's exactly what's happened.\nAnd in the Efabco case, it was a issue for\nthe Court. To say that now, whether or not section 2\nexists except for the assent agreement, but everything\nelse about a contract and everything else about\ninterstate commerce would suddenly be for the\narbitrator, that is an exact shift from what this Court\ndid in Prima Paint, and it's a shift from what Chief\nJustice Warren Burger said in the -- in the Southland\ncase, that this is a prerequisite.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Once the case is in the\ncourt, of course, the court has to decide that\nquestion. Once it is in the court. And it was in the\ncourt in -- in Prima Paint. The question is does it\nhave to go first to the court before it goes to the\narbitrator, and -- and Prima Paint doesn't decide that\nquestion.\nMR. BLAND: Well, where these cases come up\nagain and again, Your Honor, is someone brings a\nlawsuit in court and then there is a motion to compel\narbitration and there is a challenge to that motion.\nThere are next to no challenges anywhere in the country\nright now in the -- after your decision 2 years ago, in\nwhich anyone is saying, oh, this transaction doesn't\ninvolve interstate commerce.\nThere are going to be a small number of\nchallenges involving companies operating at the edge of\nlegality and maybe a tiny number of challenges\ninvolving consideration where people are going to be\nable to say there's no contract at all, there's not\neven a -- there's not even the beginning of a contract\nhere. There's not going to be a wealth of hundreds of\nthe -- of those, but there's going to be some cases,\nmostly involving the payday lending industry, but\nthey're just aren't dozens of businesses out there\nwhere there is a conceivable, plausible, colorable\nargument that the whole line of business is violating\nthe law.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Bland, I'm curious to\nknow if you agree with your opponent that whoever\ndecides it, an arbitrator or a judge, it's really going\nto be decided by the Florida Supreme Court in the next\ncouple of months.\nMR. BLAND: I think that the question of\nwhether or not this is illegal will be something that's\ndecided by the Florida Supreme Court, but that question\n-- first of all, if this case is sent back to\narbitration, the arbitration clause, of course, is on\nan individual basis and this case could never be\npursued on an individual basis. If it's not done as a\nclass action, it would be the end of the case.\nBut moreover, the arbitrator is basically\nfree to ignore what the ruling of the Florida Supreme\nCourt is. You know, there was a ruling from the Third\nCircuit a few weeks ago that said that glaring errors\nof law are not grounds for overturning an arbitration\ndecision. So the Florida Supreme Court could come out\nand say this is plainly illegal, and then a row of\narbitrators could come in and say, seems okay to us,\nand there's really not going to be a court challenge to\nthat. So I would not agree with that as a matter of --\nas a matter of practical reality, Your Honor.\nThis State law that we're talking about is\nnot about hostility to arbitration. The rule that\ndistinguishes between void contracts and the small\nuniverse of cases that are void ab initio is a rule\nthat goes back something like a hundred years in\nFlorida and it goes back hundreds more years through --\nit's come up in decisions of this Court. It has come\nup in decisions of English courts that go back that\nwere traced by the contract professors.\nAt the time that the Congress wrote the\nArbitration Act in 1925, this distinction was set out\nin Corbin and in the First Restatement of Contracts.\nThis is basic, core common law of contracts. And the\nidea that in 1925 Congress wanted to throw out all of\nthe basic core rules of contracts and, instead, replace\nthem with some new Federal rule of contract, when they\ndidn't define contract, and when they put it as a\nprecondition before the act applies, the idea that\ngeneral rules of State contract law are going to be\ntossed overboard is really going to be a dramatic\nchange for this Court -- for this Court's\njurisprudence.\nIn case after case, this Court has said\narbitration clauses are as enforceable as other\ncontracts, but no more so. And that was the basis of\nthis Court's ruling in the EEOC v. Waffle House case\njust a few years ago. Just like petitioner here, the\nWaffle House was saying arbitration clauses are sort of\nsuper contracts. They are something so many businesses\nhave relied on, as Justice Breyer says, that they are\n-- that they are treated by a different and better set\nof rules. These are contracts which are just better\nand more important than other contracts.\nAnd this Court stopped and, in Justice\nStevens' opinion in the Waffle Case, said slow down.\nFirst, you just have to treat these like other\ncontracts. And here, there's no signature line for the\nEEOC. The EEOC didn't sign on. We're going to treat\nthis like another contract, and by a 6 to 3 vote, this\nCourt found that you couldn't enforce it.\nThey want to put the cart before the horse.\nThey want to enforce this Arbitration Act before its\nterms were met. That is not what this Court did in\nPrima Paint. Prima Paint did it right. They said\nsection 2 first and only if section 2 applies, then do\nwe jump to the next point, you know, sort of dinner\nbefore dessert. And that was the appropriate approach\nbecause you have to find out if section 2 is there and\ncross that threshold before you start saying now that\nwe're in the Federal Arbitration Act, how much fun\nwould it be to apply section 4, the part that keeps\ntalking about the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, to\ncases in State court proceedings and apply a decision\nthat was based entirely on language in section 4 to\nState court proceedings.\nThat is simply an enormous expansion of the\nlaw in this area, and we urge the Court strongly to\naffirm the decision below. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Bland.\nMr. Landau, you have 4-and-a-half minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER LANDAU\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. LANDAU: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nThree --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Landau, I'd like to know\nhow you read section 2. What -- what meaning do you\ngive to a written provision in a contract?\nMR. LANDAU: Your Honor, I think the word\ncontract is not a precondition in the sense that\nrespondents talk about in the sense that the court has\nto look into whether it's a valid contract with all the\nbells and whistles of State contract law because I\nthink that is entirely inconsistent with Prima Paint.\nI think the -- the answer is --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But State law -- the\nsupposition is that State law provides that in this\ncase, the usury context, whatever, you do not have a\ncontract. That's the difference between void ab initio\nand voidable.\nMR. LANDAU: Your Honor, I think the point is\nthat it -- the key part there is -- I think Justice\nBreyer was getting to this -- that it has to be a -- a\ncontract that evidences interstate commerce to have the\nhook of commerce power for the FAA to apply in the\nfirst place. That was enacted under the substantive\ncommerce power.\nThen the question arises -- and this is\nreally where they're hanging their hats in this case to\nsay, well, you have the word contract. The word\ncontract brings with it all the bells and whistles of\nState law for a valid underlying contract. The problem\nwith that is that looking at it that way -- I think\nthis is the heart of this case -- that completely\nundermines -- or the severability rule says, we've got\na different contract. The underlying contract is -- is\nthere, and you can raise your challenge to that\ncontract, but as long as you're not challenging the --\nthe arbitration clause, then any challenge you have to\nthe underlying contract goes to the arbitrator.\nAnd again, I think the point is to say that,\nwell, they don't deny that there's a severability rule,\nbut to say that before you apply the Federal\nseverability rule, you have to go and look at the\nunderlying contract and ascertain all this is to deny\nthe Federal severability rule.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I guess that respondent\nuses the language in the way it -- he says it should be\nused when he refers to a contract that is void ab\ninitio. There's no such thing as a contract that is\nvoid ab initio, is there?\nMR. LANDAU: No.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If you take the meaning of\ncontract that he takes in section 2.\nMR. LANDAU: I -- I think you're -- you're\nright, Your Honor. I mean, I think the -- the point is\nit -- it just doesn't make sense to say that you have\nto go through all the bells and whistles of looking at\nthe validity of the underlying contract if the whole\npoint of Prima Paint -- I think this goes back to what\nthe Chief Justice said is you just look at the\narbitration provision as a severable contract. So to\nsay that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I -- his answer\nwould be, well, you only get to do that if you're under\nthe Federal Arbitration Act in the first place, and if\nyou don't have a contract, then you're not under the\nFederal Arbitration Act under State law.\nMR. LANDAU: You're right, Your Honor. I\nthink that's the key point, that to say that the -- you\nhave to go to the -- the validity of the underlying\ncontract under State law and the severability\nimplications of the challenge to the underlying\ncontract before you -- before you even get to the\narbitration clause is essentially to negate the\nseverability of the arbitration clause because the\nwhole reason you're looking at the underlying contract\nis presumably to see whether or not the arbitration\nclause can fall. So they cannot logically have a\nregime that says the arbitration clause is severable\nfrom the underlying contract.\nJUSTICE BREYER: They can logically because\nthey say the arbitration clause, when embedded in a\ncontract that is voidable -- i.e., A and B enter into a\ncontract. B says it's voidable. I void it. I void\nit. And there they say, fine, there was a contract and\ntherefore this arbitration clause, which is separable\n-- you go to arbitration. But if it's void, where B\ndoesn't have to say I void it, I void it, you never had\na contract in the first place. Now, that is a logical\nposition.\nMR. LANDAU: And you're absolutely right,\nYour Honor, and that was the lines that were drawn in\nPrima Paint. That -- that was the -- the real issue\nthat was presented. They said there was no contract.\nThey said I'm bringing a rescission suit. And if you\nread what Justice Black said in dissent in Prima Paint,\nhe said there was no contract.\nAnd this kind of goes back to what Justice\nGinsburg was saying, that to talk about the\nimplications, the severability implications, of\nparticular challenges under State law misses the point\nthat the Federal severability rule doesn't depend on\nState law.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nLandau.\nMR. LANDAU: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The case is\nsubmitted.\n(Whereupon, at 12:09 p.m., the case in the\nabove-entitled matter was submitted.)\n"
