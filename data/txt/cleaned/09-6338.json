FREELAND\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. FREELAND: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nBelieving its hands were tied by a policy\nstatement created to prevent application of this Court's\ndecision in Booker to section 3582(c) proceedings, the\ndistrict court imposed a mandatory guideline sentence\nthat exceeded the maximum authorized by the jury's\nverdict by more than six years. Sentencing Commission\npolicy cannot override this Court's clear and\nunambiguous directive to courts to treat the guidelines\nas advisory in all cases moving forward, and any\ninterpretation of section 3582(c) that permits the\nCommission to mandate sentences must be rejected, not\nonly as a matter of statutory stare decisis, but because\nit would violate the Sixth Amendment.\nIn an effort to avoid this result, the\ngovernment elevates form over substance, arguing that\nsection 3582(c) proceedings are not sentencings at\nthe -- and that the sentence imposed is not a new\nsentence. The government is wrong.\nSection 3582(c) proceedings are sentencings\nat which Booker's constitutional and remedial holdings\nmust apply. The --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Freeland --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if the\nSentencing Commission just issued a new guideline and\nsaid anyone with a -- a crack sentence, their sentence\nis going to be reduced by 10 percent? That wouldn't\npresent any problems, would it?\nMS. FREELAND: Mr. Chief Justice, I think it\nwould present precisely the same problems here. By\nindicating an amount of time that a sentence could be\nreduced, the Sentencing Commission would be doing\nprecisely what it did here, which is setting a lower\nlevel, mandatory lower level, on sentences --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But there's no --\nMS. FREELAND: -- that the district court\ncould impose.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But 3553(a) doesn't\neven come into play under my hypothetical.\nMS. FREELAND: I'm sorry, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 3553(a) doesn't even\ncome into play, so there's not a resentencing by a\njudge. It is just an across-the-board policy, like\nincreasing good time credits.\nMS. FREELAND: I disagree, Your Honor,\nbecause Congress in this case decided to enact a\nstatute, 3582(c), that invokes the discretionary\nsentencing power of the court.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right, in -- in this\ncase, but in my hypothetical Congress hasn't done that.\nIt hasn't -- or the Sentencing Commission hasn't done\nthat. They haven't invoked the discretionary\nsentencing. They just said: Across the board, 10\npercent off.\nMS. FREELAND: And, Your Honor, perhaps I\nmisunderstood, but once the Sentencing Commission acts\nto revise a guideline under its power under 994(u) and\nopts to make that amendment retroactive under -- I mean,\n994(o) -- and opts to make it retroactive under 994(u),\nonly the court has power to lower a sentence. Congress\nenacted --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, why is that? It's\nthe same hypothetical of the Chief Justice. I'm not\ninterrupting your -- your discussion with him. Suppose,\npursuant to a permissible regulation, the BOP says: Just\nfile paperwork with us, and if -- and if you show that\nyou were under a crack cocaine sentence, you're going\nto be reduced by X number of months, period. Just file\nit. What --\nMS. FREELAND: And, Justice Kennedy --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is there a problem with that?\nMS. FREELAND: Justice Kennedy, I think there\nwould be. And, again, I don't mean to be dodging the question.\nThe problem is section 3582(c). Congress clearly indicated\nthat it wanted these types of reductions to be treated\ndifferently than those under 3624(b), which are\ndelegated to the Bureau of Prisons. And those types of\nreductions --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, but the -- the\nhypothetical is Congress doesn't do this. The\nhypothetical is that Congress just tells the BOP: Find\nout who's in on crack cocaine and release them --\nwhatever, 20 months early.\nMS. FREELAND: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What's wrong with that?\nMS. FREELAND: Your Honor, if\nCongress chose to draft a statute similar to 3624(b) to\nempower the Bureau of Prisons to act whenever the\nCommission lowered a guideline or -- or changed a\nguideline under 994(o), I agree with Your Honor. It\nwould not present the problems here.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Okay. Then the Chief\nJustice's hypothetical, at least for me, meant: What --\nwhy should there be a difference?\nMS. FREELAND: The difference, again -- and\nI don't mean to be dodging your questions. The\ndifference is that Congress acted in two very different\nways here. It enacted 3582(c) to deal with reductions\nin sentence that are -- that are prompted by revisions\nto the guidelines, and it enacted 3624(b) to deal with\nrevisions that are prompted by good behavior. And\nit --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What is the\nconstitutional difference that would inure a Sixth\nAmendment right in the resentencing by the court that\ndoesn't when it's a resentencing or a modification of a\nsentence by the Bureau of Prisons?\nMS. FREELAND: Justice Sotomayor, I think\nthe difference would be that when it is delegated to the\ncourts under a statute like 3582(c), the court is then\ndealing with a mandatory guideline range, and the Sixth\nAmendment problem arises when the court sentences --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But is this truly a new\nsentence, meaning a person serving a sentence? This is\nan act of clemency. Whether the Bureau of Prisons does\nit or the court does it, why should we introduce a\ndifferent binding or non-binding constitutional limit on\none body rather than the other?\nMS. FREELAND: Justice Sotomayor, I disagree\nwith the premise of your question that this is an act of\nclemency similar to the reductions for good time\nbehavior.\nThe -- the term \"clemency,\" \"leniency,\"\n\"grace,\" connotes the idea that you deserve to be\npunished for this, but we're going to -- we're going\nto exercise leniency --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Freeland --\nMS. FREELAND: -- and give you a lesser\nsentence.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I take\nyou on another path, not the question of the difference\nbetween the two -- two sections. We have a large\nprison population, and then Booker comes down, and then\nthe guidelines change only as to crack cocaine, nothing\nelse. All of the others whose sentence has become final\ncannot get into the court's door because they don't have\nthe entering wedge.\nIn what system -- what fair system would\nsay, aha, because the crack cocaine guideline was\nreduced -- the disparity was reduced -- these people are\nnow going to overcome the finality bar, but all of the\nothers who are identically situated with respect to all\nother factors, they don't get their sentences revised?\nMS. FREELAND: Justice Ginsburg, I have a\ncouple of responses to your question. The first is that\nI think that a decision by a district court judge to\ncorrect a sentence under 3582(c) should be analogous to\na decision of a district court judge to correct a\nsentence under 2255.\nOnce the decision is made that the sentence\nshould be corrected, finality is extinguished, and when\nthe court goes about imposing the new sentence, it must\ncomport with the law of the land at the time.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But why should, bearing\nin mind that entire prison population similarly\nsituated, the courts say it's -- the finality bar is lifted\nonly to the extent that the crack cocaine guideline disparity\nhas been reduced?\nMS. FREELAND: And, Your Honor, once the\nfinality bar is lifted, the concerns about retroactivity\nshould slip away. But with respect to fairness, which I\nthink is at the heart of your question, the fact that\nthis partial remedy for an urgent and compelling\nproblem, that is, the crack guideline, was afforded to\nsome should not prevent the court from seeing justice\nfor those like Mr. Dillon, even though there are some in\nprison that are serving unconstitutional sentences that\nwill not be able to seek relief.\nMr. Dillon is properly compared to other\ndefendants who were sentenced under the amended crack\nguideline, not the original crack guideline. His\nsentence is an amended crack guideline sentence, and for\npurposes of avoiding unwarranted disparities, Mr. Dillon\nis most comparable to those other defendants that are\nsentenced after the crack guideline.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If you -- if you are\nright that this benefit goes to -- only to the class\nthat can get in the door, wouldn't that be a powerful\nmotive to the Sentencing Commission not to make its\nguidelines reductions retroactive?\nMS. FREELAND: Your Honor, I would certainly\nhope not. 994 clearly contemplates that the Commission\nwill undertake a constant review and revision of the\nguidelines to make sure that they serve the purposes of\npunishment. And 994(u) clearly shows that Congress\ncontemplated that some of those decisions would warrant\nretroactive application.\nIf the Commission were to respond to a\ndecision by this Court in Mr. Dillon's favor by refusing\nto revise the guidelines in the future or refusing to\nmake any of those revisions retroactive, I submit that\nit would be abdicating its duty under 994.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It wouldn't say that. It\njust wouldn't do it. That's all.\nMS. FREELAND: You're right, Your Honor.\nIt just wouldn't do that, but history would speak for\nitself. The Commission has constantly undertaken this\nduty under 994(o).\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But it's certainly a\nfactor that if I were -- if I were on the Commission, I\nwould certainly take that factor into account. Every\ntime I make it retroactive, it's going to reopen --\ngoing to reopen the whole sentencing and -- and allow\na Booker application where -- where it didn't apply\nbefore. How can I close my eyes to that if --\nMS. FREELAND: Well, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- if I'm making the\nretroactivity determination?\nMS. FREELAND: Your Honor, if I could, I'm\nnot suggesting that the Commission close its eyes to\nanything. However, what we're asking for in this case\nis not a full resentencing where all sentencing\ndecisions would be reopened. We're simply saying that\nwhen a court imposes a new sentence, that new sentence\nmust comply with this Court's decision in Booker, and --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Only Booker?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that means it --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Only Booker?\nWhat if there is another constitutional objection\nto the sentence, and he goes back under --\nunder the crack cocaine? Can you say, oh, and, you\nknow, also, it violated my rights under equal\nprotection? You didn't notice that before, but here's\nthe argument. Is that before the sentencing court?\nMS. FREELAND: Your Honor, I would have to\nsay that it is. The -- the new sentence --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, you would you\nhave to say. So --\nMS. FREELAND: The sentence imposed would\nhave to comply with the Constitution.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it's not only as\nunfair as Justice Ginsburg hypothesized. It's even more\nunfair than that, because just because of the crack\ncocaine change, somebody with an equal protection\nchallenge gets to raise that. While somebody in prison\nwithout an equal -- with an equal protection challenge\nbut not the crack cocaine one is still stuck.\nMS. FREELAND: That's true,\nMr. Chief Justice, but that's the case in any situation\nwhere a defendant has raised an issue on appeal or has\npresented a claim in a 2255 petition, and just by\nhappenstance the decision awarding them a new -- a new\ntrial or a new sentence happens when a new\nconstitutional rule is announced by this Court.\nNow, certain --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's a new\nconstitutional rule. This is an old one. This is one\nthat was -- you know, the equal protection clause has\nbeen in the books for a while. And -- and he -- he just\ngets the chance to raise it solely because of the fact\nthat his conviction involved crack cocaine.\nMS. FREELAND: And, again, Your Honor, I\nthink that he would get to raise it, but I want to point\nout that not every constitutional issue would be ripe\nfor the court's decision at that proceeding. If there\nwere an opportunity to raise -- as you said, equal\nprotection isn't a new law like -- we're talking about\nBooker being a new law for Mr. -- for Mr. Dillon. If\nthere were an equal protection challenge that had not\nbeen lodged at the original sentencing, the district\ncourt would apply the law of the case and then --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, no, no, no. I\nthought under your theory this is a whole new\nsentencing. So who cares whether he waived it at the\nfirst one? We're starting from -- from point zero.\nMS. FREELAND: Mr. Chief Justice, I must\nhave misspoken. That is certainly not what I meant to\nindicate. What I meant to say is, certainly, all\nsentences imposed ought to comply with the Constitution,\nbut we live in a system that has waiver principles, law\nof the case, mandate rule. These are all obstacles that\na defendant seeking to overturn a sentencing or raise an\nissue on equal protection grounds that weren't presented\nbefore would serve as obstacles to their doing so.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And my point is that\nthey shouldn't under your theory. The fact that he\nwaived it at the earlier sentencing under your theory\nshould not matter at all, because your theory is that\nthis is a whole new sentencing, so who cares what went\non in the prior sentencing?\nMS. FREELAND: I disagree, Your Honor, that\nmy theory does not encompass that part of the rule. And\nI think with respect to our criminal history issue that\nwe've raised that's precisely what we've said, that\nthere are errors that a district court may not be able\nto correct in a 3582(c) proceeding --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why do you -- why do\nyou pick on -- on Booker as -- as not carrying over? I\nmean, if you say that there carries over from the prior\nsentencing his failure to raise the equal protection\nclaim, why can't you say it's also law of the case that\nthe Booker objection doesn't stand? It's law of the case.\nIt was decided before Booker, and that's the law of the\ncase as far as that's concerned.\nMS. FREELAND: Well, Your Honor, if the law\nof the case were in place before Booker were decided, the\nnew law would be an exception to the law of the case if\nMr. Dillon were resentenced as he were after the Court's\ndecision in Booker.\nI'm not sure if that answers your question\nprecisely. For Mr. Dillon, Booker is new law at his new\nsentencing. He did not have an opportunity to raise a\nBooker objection or ask for a sentence below the\nguideline range at his original sentencing.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Under your theory,\nthere's no bar to an upward sentence by the -- by the\njudge, because if it's a brand new hearing subject to\nBooker, which mandates complete discretion under 3553,\nthe judges define the sentence that fits the crime and\nthe defendant. So you don't mind an upward --\nMS. FREELAND: Well, under 3582(c), Your\nHonor, statute -- the statute provides that it --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I know you want --\nMS. FREELAND: -- a sentence be only reduced\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You only want part of\n-- the statute, not the whole statute?\nMS. FREELAND: Your Honor, I think we want\nthe whole statute, the statute that allows --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If you want the whole\nstatute, then it's a new sentence. You can't beg and say\nthe statute limits up and down, but I only want the\ndown --\nMS. FREELAND: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- and I want a new sentence.\nIt doesn't make sense.\nMS. FREELAND: I think I understand your\npoint. The -- the problem is with the statute. 3582(c)\ndoes not authorize a court to increase the sentence.\nThe fact that a sentence cannot be increased\ndoes not divest the proceeding at which it's imposed --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So what's -- what's the --\nthe words in the statute is that it may reduce the term.\nYou can't change the term -- you cannot change a\nsentence, except that you can reduce the term if such\nreduction is consistent with applicable policy\nstatements.\nMS. FREELAND: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Do you see anything --\nwhat's -- what's unconstitutional about that? Then they\nissue a policy statement, and the policy statement says\nyou can't reduce it except insofar as our new --\nwhatever the new thing is -- applies.\nIf you're arguing that that violates the\nConstitution, what I'm missing is why? What violates\nthe Constitution in that?\nMS. FREELAND: Your Honor, post-Booker, what\nviolates the Constitution is the policy statement's use\nof the word \"shall.\" That's a -- that's a\nsignificant change --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't remember --\nMS. FREELAND: -- in the wording of 1.10\nJUSTICE BREYER: I thought in Booker --\nand I have to go back and look at it, but I thought in\nBooker the Court held that certain specific -- like\ncertain specific words in certain specific provisions\nof the -- the sentencing statutes were unconstitutional\nbecause of Apprendi and because of the other part,\nBooker itself.\nWell, 3582 wasn't one of them. So -- so\nthere must be something unconstitutional if you're\nright. I don't see how you get around this statute.\nMS. FREELAND: Your Honor, in our view\n3582(c) is not unconstitutional. It --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. If it's not\nunconstitutional, then why don't you have to follow it?\nBecause what it says is, you cannot get a reduction\nexcept in respect to what the policy guideline says.\nAnd the policy guideline says you don't get a reduction,\nexcept insofar as we've reduced a sentence in a\nparticular respect.\nWhat's unconstitutional about that? I'm --\nI'm not saying there isn't. I want to know what your\nargument is that it is unconstitutional.\nMS. FREELAND: Justice Breyer, post-Booker,\nif 3582(c) is interpreted as you just said, that the\nsentence -- the reduction in sentence must be consistent\nwith applicable policy statements absolutely --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's what it says.\nI don't know how you'd interpret it some other way --\nMS. FREELAND: And that the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- if that's what it says.\nMS. FREELAND: And that the policy statement\nthen requires the court to impose a mandatory guideline\nsentence --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, it just says what we're\ndoing is we're reopening the sentencing in respect to\nthe particular way we reduce people's sentence, not in\nrespect to something else. That's what I read the\npolicy statement to say. That if there were 19 things\nthat were considered in the sentence and one of those 19\nis changed in a downward direction, then it says we make\nan exception, says the policy statement. You can reopen\nnumber 19, but not the first 18.\nNow, why is that unconstitutional? What in\nthe Constitution prohibits doing that?\nMS. FREELAND: The -- Your Honor, if I could,\nthe constitutional problem with section 1B1.10(b)(2)(A)\nis that it requires the district court to impose a\nsentence within the guideline range. Therein lies\nthe problem. The requirement, a mandatory guideline\nsentence based on a judicially enhanced range --\ntherein lies the problem.\nSection 3582(c) does not mandate guideline\nsentencing. It's 1B1.10.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Freeland, what would\nhappen if the -- the motion is made with respect to the\ncrack cocaine, and the judge said, I'm -- I'm not going\nto -- I deny the motion? Would the judge then have to\ngo on and consider Booker and say, now, on this piece,\nI deny the motion, but now I can just do whatever I want\nwith the rest of it?\nMS. FREELAND: Your Honor, if I could, if a\njudge is presented with a 3582(c) motion and denies the\nmotion, all the court has done is enter an order denying\na motion.\nIt's not until the district court decides to\ngrant the 3582(c) motion and reduce the defendant's\nsentence that 3553(a) factors come into play, the policy\nstatements come into play, and a new sentence is\nthereafter imposed.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, if -- suppose\nCongress and the Sentencing Commission had made it\ncrystal clear that they are authorizing a reopening but\nonly with respect to one piece. You say -- you say no\nmatter how clear it is, as a matter of constitutional\nlaw, because Booker has been decided, the whole sentence\nis up for --\nMS. FREELAND: Justice Ginsburg --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- consideration?\nMS. FREELAND: Justice Ginsburg, that's\ncorrect. And the reason is because 3582(c) is a\nprovision that is used by courts to correct sentences.\nOnce the court decides that the defendant is worthy of a\ncorrection, that the sentence should be corrected, it\ngrants a motion extinguishing the old sentence and\nimposes a new sentence.\nOur position is simply that when it imposes\nthe new sentence, it must comply with Booker's\nconstitutional and remedial holdings.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I have a better answer to\nJustice Breyer's question. You want my better answer?\nMS. FREELAND: Please, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Sure.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's -- it's -- it's not --\nit's not section 3582 that's unconstitutional, and it\nisn't even the provision for being guided by a policy\nstatement of the Sentencing Commission that's\nunconstitutional. It is the nature of the Sentencing\nCommission's policy statement that is unconstitutional.\nSurely, if the Sentencing Commission had a\npolicy statement which said you will reduce it for white\nprisoners but not for black prisoners, that would surely\nbe unconstitutional, right?\nMS. FREELAND: Absolutely, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And your point here is that\nthe policy statement which says you effectively will\ndisregard Booker is unconstitutional?\nMS. FREELAND: I agree.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That works, doesn't it?\nMS. FREELAND: I agree. And, Justice\nBreyer --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You agree. Now -- now,\nwhat -- that's what I -- I could understand that if 3582\nsaid to the judge you resentence him. But it doesn't\nsay that. So there's a sentence in effect, and what\n3582 says is a -- a sentence can be reduced just as if,\nto go back to the beginning, Congress passed a statute\nor the Commission said everybody's sentence will be\nreduced. That doesn't change what the sentence was. It\nsays there's a reduction, like for good -- good time.\nSo it says a defendant, if he has been\nsentenced based on factor 19 in the case, the court may\nreduce the term of imprisonment, the term of\nimprisonment there under the sentence. So I'm back to\nmy question.\nWhat's unconstitutional about that?\nMS. FREELAND: Justice --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And what the court just says\nis the court -- the Commission says: That's right. You\nmay reduce it in respect to what we've considered; you\nmay not reduce it in respect to something which is\nnot considered.\nSo I'm still puzzled about the constitutional\nproblem.\nMS. FREELAND: And, Justice Breyer, I\napologize because I may not be --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no, you don't have to\napologize.\nMS. FREELAND: -- I may not be understanding\nyour question.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I understand your argument\nnow. And I didn't quite and now I do. So there's nothing\nto apologize for.\nMS. FREELAND: Okay. I'd like to --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You wanted to get the idea\nin my mind. I'm not expressing that in my question, but\nI got your answer.\nMS. FREELAND: Okay, thank you.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. FREELAND: A couple of points, though,\nthat I -- that -- from reading the text of the statute\nthat I'd like to point out. Justice Breyer, notice\nit doesn't say \"sentence.\" It says \"term of\nimprisonment.\" \"Term of imprisonment\" is -- is a term\nof art in the Federal Code. A \"term of imprisonment\"\nis an authorized sentence under 3551 of the United\nStates Code. And under 3621, the Bureau of Prisons\ncannot hold someone in custody absent a sentence of\nimprisonment.\nAnd in this case, there are two judgments,\ntwo sentences of imprisonment. The Bureau of Prisons\nwould not have been able to hold Mr. Dillon for\n270 months under the 1993 judgment, and the Bureau of\nPrisons certainly cannot hold Mr. Dillon for 322 months\nunder the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. Why --\nMS. FREELAND: -- the June 2008 judgment.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why could they --\nthe first part of that, why could they not hold him for\nthe term under the 1993 sentence?\nMS. FREELAND: Under 3621, it's very clear\nthat the -- the Bureau of Prisons, absent a reduction\nunder 3624(b) for good time, is directed to hold the\ndefendant in the custody of Bureau of Prisons for the\nterm of imprisonment on the judgment.\nIn this case, following the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what if the\nPresident reduces the sentence using his pardon\npower? He cuts it back; he cuts it in half. The Bureau\nof Prisons has to hold him for the full term of the\nimprisonment? No, that can't be true.\nMS. FREELAND: Justice Scalia, I'm certain\nthat that's not true. And I mean, there -- I'm not\nfamiliar --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So why is this any\ndifferent?\nMS. FREELAND: -- with those provisions.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why is this any different?\nI mean, there are obviously -- what it proves is that\nthere are exceptions to that requirement that they hold\nhim for the term of imprisonment. They -- they have to\nhold him for the term of imprisonment unless it has been\nshortened, right, by -- by pardon or remission of part\nof the term by the President or what the argument for\nthe government is, or by application of this retroactive\nrule by -- by the Commission.\nMS. FREELAND: And again, Your Honor, I'm\nnot familiar with the clemency and commutation\nprocedures. I would have to think that some piece of\npaper, some order directing the Bureau of Prisons to\nreduce the sentence, just as a new judgment in a 3582(c)\nis a new sentence of 270 months, would have to be\npresented so that the Bureau of Prisons would release.\nBut -- but that aside, the -- the real point\nhere is that the new judgment is a new judgment; it is a\nnew sentence. This is not a reduction in the old\nsentence. It --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's what it says.\nIt's -- the other thing that has bothered me, to tell you\nthe truth, is -- is the part of the point that was brought\nup previously, that it is up to the Commission whether to\nmake it retroactive. It is.\nMS. FREELAND: I agree.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't know why they\ncouldn't take into account that to make any drug-related\nchange, you see, and then make that retroactive, is\ngoing to reopen the sentencing for every single person\nwho has already been convicted of a drug crime in the\nFederal courts, of which there are probably tens of\nthousands.\nAnd -- and I think they would properly take\nthat into account. And, therefore, they might properly\nsay, we're not going to make this retroactive.\nMS. FREELAND: Your Honor, the -- the\npractice in the court of appeals post-Booker of\nremanding all of the cases that were in the pipeline\nshows that the Federal courts are able to handle\nrevisiting thousands of sentences imposed under a\nmandatory system to revisit them under 3553(a). And as\nJustice Walton said in testifying before the Sentencing\nCommission with respect to this issue, that the courts\nare fully prepared to handle any administrative burden\nand believes that such a burden would be sufficiently\njustified for people like Mr. Dillon who are deserving.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'll make this brief\nbecause your -- your rebuttal light is on. Your answer\nmade sense when we talk about term as opposed to\nsentence, if you just look at (c). But (b) says,\n\"Notwithstanding the fact that a sentence to imprisonment\ncan be modified ... a judgment of conviction that\nincludes such a sentence constitutes a final judgment.\"\nDoes (b) not apply to (c)?\nMS. FREELAND: (b) does apply to (c), Your\nHonor, and I'm glad that you raised that because 3582(b)\nis significant in that it does not distinguish the\neffect of finality of remands, modifications under\n3582(c); it's the judgment of conviction -- the\nconviction that remains final. The sentence is no\nlonger final if modified under any of the provisions\nlisted in 3582(b).\nIf there are no further questions, I'd\nlike to reserve the remainder of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms.\nFreeland.\nMs. Kruger.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONDRA R. KRUGER\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. KRUGER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe provisions of the Sentencing Reform Act\nat issue in this case, unlike the provisions that were\nat issue in Booker, do not govern the imposition of\nsentence. They instead provide a discretionary\nmechanism for the exercise of leniency for defendants\nwho have already been sentenced. The district court in\nthis case properly exercised its authority under the\nstatute to reduce Petitioner's sentence by a little bit\nmore than 4 years, which was the maximum amount of\nreduction that was consistent with the Sentencing\nCommission's specification under section 994(u) about\nwhether and to what extent its crack cocaine amendments\nwarranted reductions in already imposed sentences.\nThe district court had neither a further\nobligation nor indeed the authority to set Petitioner's\nsentence aside altogether and resentence Petitioner\nunder the advisory guidelines regime announced in\nBooker.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Does that extend to --\nwhich was part of this case -- the court notices that\nthere was a technical error; it was a calculation error\nthe first time, and the judge says, well, I'll fix\nthat up, too. That was an arithmetic error.\nMS. KRUGER: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, the same\nrule applies to the calculation error that Petitioner is\nraising.\nSection 3582(c)(2) wasn't designed by\nCongress to serve as effectively a less restrictive\nsubstitute for raising such challenges on direct appeal\nor where otherwise available under section 2255. It was\ninstead designed for the limited purpose of providing an\nopportunity to extend leniency to defendants whose\nsentences are otherwise final, nonappealable, and\ntherefore not subject to any modification.\nJustice Sotomayor, you had asked earlier\nwhether this provision was designed as an act of\nclemency or was instead designed as a kind of adjunct to\nthe court's judicial review power, a kind of 2255-type\npower. We think the answer is clearly that it was\ndesigned as a mechanism for the exercise of a type of\nclemency power. I think that's particularly clear if\nyou look at the parallel provisions in section\n3582(c)(1), which are reprinted at pages 3a and 4a of the\nappendix to the government's brief.\nThose provisions also provide for similar\ntypes of sentence reductions in cases where the director\nof the Bureau of Prisons makes a motion for sentence\nreduction based either on extraordinary and compelling\nreasons or because the defendant is over the age of 70\nand has served more than 30 years in prison.\nIn all of these cases, the district court\nexercises a discretionary power to reduce the sentence\nin the exercise of leniency, not because of legal error\nbut for equitable reasons.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that gets tied up,\ndoesn't it, to your argument that this is not a part of\nthe criminal prosecution, that this is a -- not a Sixth\nAmendment proceeding, but -- not a Sixth Amendment\nproceeding, so it doesn't require constitutional\nprotection?\nMS. KRUGER: That's correct, Justice\nSotomayor. We think that what Congress has called for\nin all of the sentence reduction provisions of section\n3582(c) is a kind of discretionary mechanism for\nreducing sentences that are already final and\nnonappealable and can't be modified in any other respect.\nIt hasn't called for a de novo plenary resentencing so\nto allow defendants in the position that Petitioner is\nin to come into court and reopen every aspect of their\nsentence, requiring reconsideration of guidelines\ndeterminations made in this case more than a decade ago\nor requiring application of intervening changes in the\nlaw.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Am I correct in\nunderstanding that 3582(c) was enacted prior to our\ndecision in Booker?\nMS. KRUGER: Yes, it -- it was.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And is it clear that it\nshould be construed as though the system was mandatory\nbefore the decision in Booker, rather than construed in\nthe light of the remedial decision in Booker?\nMS. KRUGER: Well, I think there are two\nquestions that are raised here about how this statutory\nscheme comports with Booker. One is the Sixth Amendment\nquestion, whether this is a statutory provision that\ncalls for a resentencing, at which Booker and its\ndecision about the Sixth Amendment would apply.\nAnd then the second question is even if you\nthink there is no constitutional problem with reading\nthe statute in accordance with its plain terms, whether\nBooker's remedial analysis requires treating the\nreference to the policy statements in section 3582(c)(2)\nas purely advisory.\nWe think with respect to that question, not\neven Petitioner is quite willing to embrace the full\nconsequences of that argument. It would mean severing\nand excising the portion of 3582(c)(2) that requires\nconsistency with the applicable policy statements.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Right. Is that any more\na dramatic change than was made in the Booker remedial\nopinion itself?\nMS. KRUGER: I'm not sure whether or not\nit's a more dramatic change in terms of the number of\ncases that would be affected, but it's --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But the remedial opinion\nbasically rewrote the whole statute on -- except first\nit didn't have to reach 3582(c), but it certainly\nchanged the -- the nature of the mandatory provisions\nthat were previously in the statute.\nMS. KRUGER: That's true, and it did so in\norder to solve the constitutional difficulties that were\ncreated by a mandatory guidelines system with respect to\nthe imposition of sentence.\nWithout that same kind of Sixth Amendment\nviolation in the context of discretionary sentence\nreduction proceedings, we think there is no basis in\nBooker's analysis for severing and excising any portion\nof 3582(c)(2), but I would note that the consequence of\nsevering and excising the requirement of consistency with\nthe applicable policy statements would be to free\ndistrict courts not only from the Sentencing\nCommission's specifications about how much to reduce\nsentences, but also which of its amendments to the\nguidelines would justify retroactive application,\nbecause it is after all in a policy statement, section\n1B1.10, that the Sentencing Commission has specified\nwhich of its amendments, among many, justify sentence\nreductions under 3582(c)(2). That would mean that every\ntime the Sentencing Commission revises its guidelines\nand reduces applicable sentencing ranges, any number of\ndefendants would be free to come to the district courts\nand ask them to make their own independent judgment\nabout whether or not they should be effectively\nresentenced as a consequence. And that would certainly\nprovide a significant disincentive for the Sentencing\nCommission ever to revise sentencing guidelines in a\ndownward direction.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Have there been other\nguidelines ranges that have been reduced, and, if so,\nwere those also retroactive?\nMS. KRUGER: There have -- there have been\nmany guidelines ranges that have been reduced over the\ncourse of the existence of the sentencing guidelines. I\nbelieve that right now, the current number of -- of\nguidelines amendments the Sentencing Commission has made\nretroactive stands at 27.\nThis was the -- one of the first decisions\nthat the Sentencing Commission made about retroactivity\nin the wake of Booker, and it did so with full\nconsciousness of the potential for broadly reopening\nsentences. And it certainly weighed very heavily in the\nSentencing Commission's deliberations that the\ntraditional understanding, existing long before Booker\nwas ever decided, was that 3582(c)(2) proceedings do not\nconstitute plenary resentencings that incorporate all\nintervening changes to the law.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can -- can I ask you a\ndifferent question on the secondary argument that they\nmake? When I read the secondary argument, that there\nwas an error in the calculation of the guidelines and\nshe would like to have that error corrected, I didn't\nsee anything in the policy statement that would prevent\nher from getting that correction.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I think you told me -- I\nasked you that question, and you told me it could not be\ncorrected, because everything was final.\nMS. KRUGER: That's correct --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But why?\nMS. KRUGER: -- and the policy statement\nactually also --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What in the policy\nstatement? Because what it says is: What you're\nsupposed to do is: Judge, you go and look at the\nguidelines that were applied. Now, substitute the\nnew one reducing the sentence for the old one, and\nthen go apply it.\nAnd, therefore, that seems to me not to\nblock a claim that would say, when you apply these\nguidelines with the new one substituted for the old one,\napply them; that is, if, in fact, there was an error\nthe first time.\nNow, she may have a hard time showing that,\nbut if she can show it, what in the words that are right\nthere in (b)(1) stops her from getting that correction?\nMS. KRUGER: It's on page -- if you look at\npage 8a of the appendix --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I have it.\nMS. KRUGER: -- in the government's brief --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I have it in front of me.\nMS. KRUGER: In the final sentence, it says,\n\"In making such determination, the court shall\nsubstitute only the amendments listed in subsection (c)\" --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's right.\nMS. KRUGER: -- \"for the corresponding provisions\nthat were applied\" ---\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's right.\nMS. KRUGER: -- \"and shall leave all other\nguideline application decisions unaffected.\"\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, all other guideline\napplication decisions, and the claim is that they just\nmade an error, like a clerical error, a clear error,\nmanifest injustice, in that first math. Do you think\nthat this would leave them unaffected?\nMS. KRUGER: I do.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. I see.\nMS. KRUGER: I think that that is the plain\nmeaning of the Sentencing Commission's directive there.\nI would say that the question --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I guess they also made a\nmistake in not applying Booker, right?\n(Laughter.)\nMS. KRUGER: Well, the premise of that\nquestion, I think, assumes two things. It assumes that\n3582(c)(2) proceedings are plenary sentencings at which\nBooker applies, which the Sentencing Commission, based\non a very long history of rejections and precisely\nthat parameter.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. I would have thought\nthe objection to that is: No, they didn't make a mistake\nin applying Booker, because this Court has said that Booker\nisn't retroactive.\nMS. KRUGER: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And, of course, they did make\na mistake if it is retroactive. And then the Court should\nhave said it is retroactive, in which case there would\nbe no problem.\nMS. KRUGER: Well, if Booker were\nretroactive, I think that our position would still be\nthat this is not the proper vehicle for applying it,\nthat the proper vehicle would be to file a motion for --\nto vacate or set aside the sentence under section 2255.\nCongress didn't intend these sentence\nreduction proceedings to serve essentially the same\npurpose. It -- it intended them to serve simply the\npurpose of reducing otherwise final, nonappealable\nsentences. I would say --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I know my word was: It\nshall leave all other guideline application decisions.\nWell, that's -- that's -- their claim is not that the\nguideline -- it's that they -- they chose the wrong\nguideline or they didn't apply the right words. You\nsee, so they weren't applying that -- they just applied\nthe wrong thing. Now you say I'm working too hard.\nOkay.\nMS. KRUGER: I think you may be working a\nlittle hard, Justice Breyer.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. KRUGER: I would say that, on that\npoint, we also fundamentally disagree with Petitioner's\nsubmission that there was any error in the calculation\nof his criminal history score in 1993.\nBut to the extent that Petitioner wanted to\nraise any challenges to that determination, we think the\nappropriate time and place to do that would have been on\ndirect appeal of that sentencing decision, rather than\nwaiting a decade and attempting to use the 3582(c)(2)\nproceedings as a kind of vehicle for collaterally\nreopening that aspect of his sentence.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: When the judge considers\nthe adjustment motion under the -- under the section,\ndoes he consider how the prisoner has behaved in prison;\ni.e., if he has behaved very badly, he doesn't give\nthe -- the reduction?\nMS. KRUGER: The district court can consider\nany disciplinary proceedings that have occurred in the\ncourse of the defendant's imprisonment, yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But he -- but he can't go\nbelow.\nThe -- the Petitioner makes the argument\nmetaphysically that there's just a new sentence. In\nyour view, is that refuted by the language of (c)(2)\nbecause they talk about in the case of a defendant who\nhas been sentenced to a term of imprisonment, and then\nthey say the term can be reduced, and it doesn't use the\nwords \"a new sentence shall be imposed\"? I assume that's\nyour argument.\nMS. KRUGER: I mean, I think that that\ncertainly reinforces the conclusion that I think also\narises from other aspects of the provision, that what\nCongress had in mind wasn't the imposition of a\nbrandnew sentence, but simply a discretionary reduction\nof the old one. I think that's right, Justice Kennedy.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm troubled by\nyour response to Justice Kennedy's previous question,\nthat the judge can take into account conduct in prison\nand all these other things. It does seem to open it up\nto other factors than the crack cocaine disparity, and\nonce you're looking at other factors, why not look at\neverything?\nMS. KRUGER: Well, I think the answer to\nthat question is resolved by looking at the plain text\nof 3582(c)(2), Mr. Chief Justice, which directs that\ndistrict courts have a discretion to reduce sentences in\na manner that's consistent with applicable policy\nstatements, but after considering these statutory\nsentencing factors under section 3553(a), which\ninclude, of course, the need to protect the public from\nfuture crimes committed by the defendant, as well as the\nhistory and characteristics of the prisoner.\nThe reference to 3553(a) guides district\ncourts' discretion in deciding whether or not to grant a\nreduction that's authorized by the Sentencing Commission\nin the course of its statutory duty under 994(u) to\nspecify whether and to what extent its amendments\njustify retroactive application.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So, it's a one-way ratchet?\nMS. KRUGER: Effectively. I mean, it works\nin both directions. It can justify granting a\nreduction; in the case of Petitioner, the district court\nthought that the 3553(a) factors clearly pointed in\nfavor of granting the reduction. But it also -- those\nfactors can work in the direction of denying an\notherwise available reduction.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The Petitioner's brief\nopens with a statement about his rehabilitation. We\ndon't know if that has been contested. You don't\nrespond to it. But let's assume that's all true. He\nestablished schools, and he helped young people and so\nforth.\nDoes the Justice Department ever make\nrecommendations that prisoners like this have their\nsentence commuted?\nMS. KRUGER: I am not aware of the answer to\nthat, Justice Kennedy. It is certainly true that\nevidence of that type of rehabilitation factored into\nthe government's recommendation in this case that\nPetitioner --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And isn't the population\nof prisoners in the Federal prisons about 185,000 now?\nMS. KRUGER: I think --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I think it is. And were\nthere -- how many commutations last year? None. How many\ncommutations the year before? Five.\nDoes this show that something is not working\nin the system? 185,000 prisoners? I think that's the\nnumber.\nMS. KRUGER: I -- I'm not prepared to speak\nto that question today, Justice Kennedy. I can tell you\nthat the government very much takes those considerations\ninto account when making recommendations about available\nsentence reductions under section 3582(c)(2).\nAnd, indeed, in this case, the government\nagreed that the Petitioner should receive the full\nmeasure of the benefit that the Sentencing Commission\nhad made available when it decided to make the crack\ncocaine amendments retroactive, based in large part on\nPetitioner's conduct in prison and his other\ncharacteristics.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question?\nAccepting the point that there's no constitutional\ncompulsion that they had to open up for a full new\nsentencing, and I understand one reason for not doing it\nis that you don't impose too much work on the district\ncourts for doing it, but could you explain to me why\nas -- just as a matter of policy and good judgment, the\nCommission would say, well, you can take a look at all\nthe negative factors that would argue against reduction,\nbut you cannot look at any of the factors that would show\nwhy you should have had the same sentence that if -- why\nyou should get the kind of sentence you would have\ngotten if you had been sentenced in the first place\ntoday?\nBecause I guess this particular man is\ngoing to be -- spend 22 more years in jail than if he\n-- if he had been sentenced today.\nMS. KRUGER: The reason why the Commission\ndoesn't do that is because it wouldn't comply with its\nstatutory mandate under 28 U.S.C. 994(u) to specify both\nwhich guidelines amendments justify retroactive\napplication and the amount by which sentences may be\nreduced.\nThe Sentencing Commission would have no\npower to simply say in its policy statement: District\ncourts, you are free to reduce sentences by however\nmuch amount you believe is appropriate.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You think the statute\nwould have prohibited a more generous policy statement,\nthen?\nMS. KRUGER: I do think the statute would\nhave prohibited such a policy statement. Yes, that's\ncorrect, Justice Stevens.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But I -- I still don't\nunderstand how you fit into that your answer to the\nChief Justice earlier that, in fact, the court can\nconsider other factors in -- in 3553 when it's making\nthe reduction.\nMS. KRUGER: Justice Scalia, I think the\nanswer is simply that the 3553(a) factors and their\nconsideration under 3582(c)(2) is designed for a\ndifferent purpose than for the consideration that goes\ninto the initial imposition of the sentence.\nThe point of considering the 3553(a)\nfactors, to the extent they are applicable, to use the\nwords of 3582(c)(2) --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMS. KRUGER: -- is just to determine whether\nor not the district court will grant a reduction that is\nauthorized, to the extent it is authorized, by applicable\npolicy statements. It's not to determine whether the\nresulting sentence, as an original matter, is greater\nthan necessary to comport with the statutory sentencing\nfactors. It's simply for the limited purpose of\ndeciding whether to exercise discretion to reduce the\nsentence in a manner that's authorized by the statute.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I see. But -- but I\nthought you said you could take into account good\nbehavior in that determination? But that isn't --\nthat isn't a factor that would cause you to disallow\nthe reduction. It's a factor that --\nMS. KRUGER: It's a factor that would cause\nyou to permit the reduction, presumably. It's one of\nthe many considerations that a district court can take\ninto account in deciding that it will, in fact, exercise\nits discretion to reduce the sentence to the extent that\nthat's permitted by Congress and applicable policy\nstatements.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it -- it's also\na factor that would -- might guide the district court to\na decision not to reduce the sentence.\nMS. KRUGER: That's correct. It can point\nin either direction in any given case.\nBut the critical point is that Congress has\nset the parameters for the district court's exercise of\ndiscretion in these proceedings. Whatever the district\ncourt chooses to do has to be consistent with applicable\npolicy statements, including the Commission's policy\nstatement in which it's implemented its statutory\nauthority to specify whether and to what extent its\nguidelines amendments will justify retroactive\napplication.\nIf the Court has no further questions, we\nwould ask that the judgment of the court of appeals be\naffirmed.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMs. Kruger.\nMs. Freeland, have you 3 minutes remaining.\nMS. FREELAND: I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice\n-- how many minutes?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Three.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LISA B. FREELAND\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. FREELAND: Three minutes, thank you.\nA couple of points. I wanted to answer\nJustice Kennedy's question. The court is not only\npermitted to consider bad behavior in prison; under\n1B1.10, the court is required. The word is \"shall.\"\nAnd, so, all of these things and many of your questions\npoint to the fact that this is an adversarial\nproceeding.\nSection 3582(c) describes a sentencing. It\nrequires the court to consider all of the 3553(a)\nfactors. It requires the court to be consistent with\npolicy statements. It requires the court to impose a new\nsentence.\nAnd the word \"modification\" that's used in\n3582(c) connotes correction, not leniency, not grace.\nThose are the functions of the executive branch, not of the\njudicial branch. And, in this context, the court decided,\nafter the Commission reduced the sentencing -- the\nsentencing guidelines for crack offenders, that a\ncorrection was warranted. There was an error in the\nprior sentence that 3582(c) permitted the district court\nto correct, and when it imposed a new sentence, that new\nsentence has to comport with current law.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Can I get you to go back\nto -- you said something that only the executive can grant\nclemency or ought. What -- what about a program where a\ndistrict judge says I'm going to have this person undergo a\ncourse -- a drug addiction course, and if the defendant\nsuccessfully passes the course, then I'll give a\nlighter sentence? That -- that --\nMS. FREELAND: Justice Ginsburg -- I'm\nsorry.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Did your answer exclude\nthat -- that possibility?\nMS. FREELAND: Justice Ginsburg, your\nhypothetical -- the court is imposing a sentence or\nconditions of a sentence, and once those conditions have\nbeen met, the defendant is relieved, just as when the\nconditions of a sentence of imprisonment have been met,\nthe defendant is released from prison.\nOne point that I'd like to get back to,\nbecause there were many questions about it, is this\nconsistent with policy statements? Policy statements by\ndefinition do not bind. The Sentencing Commission in\nthis case changed the 1B1.10 to say that the sentencing\ncourt could not, shall not, impose a sentence below the\nguideline range. 1B1.10 for all of the 26 retroactive\namendments that preceded the crack amendment read\ndistrict courts should sentence within the amended\nguideline range, and that's appropriately a policy\nstatement. 1B1.10(b)(2)(A) is not a policy statement.\nIt purports to be a binding rule. And as this Court\nknows, policy statements do not bind.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but they do if\nCongress says they do.\nMS. FREELAND: When Congress says consistent\nwith policy statements -- and, Your Honor, I would\ndirect you -- I see my red light is on, if I could\nfinish --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can answer\nJustice Breyer's question.\nMS. FREELAND: I would direct you to the\namicus brief on behalf of the defenders, at pages 23 and\n24, and our reply brief, at pages 25 and 26, for an\nexcellent --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMS. FREELAND: Thank you very much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The case is\nsubmitted.\n(Whereupon, at 11:00 a.m., the case in the\nabove-entitled matter was submitted.)\n26:12 28:6 32:17,21 31:6 34:20,22
