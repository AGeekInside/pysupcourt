        "content": "(10:02 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nfirst this morning in case 06-694, United States v.\nWilliams.\nGeneral Clement.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nThis Court has made clear that speech\nproposing an unlawful transaction is not protected by\nthe First Amendment.\nAnd speech that falsely proposes an unlawful\ntransaction is likewise unprotected.\nThe statute at issue here properly construed\ndoes no more than prohibit efforts to offer or solicit\nmaterials that are contraband and then prevents somebody\nfrom turning around after soliciting or offering\ncontraband and suggesting that the materials either did\nnot exist or were not contraband after all. The statute\ndoes not prohibit truthful speech about lawful\nmaterials.\nAccordingly, the court of appeals erred in\nstriking the statute down on its face.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But if I could start\nwith one of the more compelling hypotheticals on the\nother side. Let's say I'm a movie reviewer. I write a\nreview saying this is an awful movie. It portrays child\npornography. Aren't I presenting information in a way\nthat would cause others to believe that the movie\ncontains child pornography, and wouldn't that be covered\nby the statute?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, we do\nnot think that would be covered by the statute. We\ndon't think that that would involve -- in the first\npoint, we don't think it would involve presentation or\npromotion of the movie in the meaning of this statute.\nWe think those terms are really limited to\nefforts to make the product available to the market.\nAnd I think if you read those terms in\nconjunction with each other, they are all directed at\nefforts to make the product available to the market.\nNow, so if the person whose actually\ndistributing the film wants to try to market it as\nactual child pornography, then I suppose that would come\nwithin the ambit of the statute. But a movie reviewer\ndoes not have anything to worry about in the first\ninstance because I don't think that would come within\nthe term --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the distributor\nattaches the movie review. It's in amazon.com, and then\nit has the movie review.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Again, Justice Kennedy, it\nmight be conceptually possible for somebody to market,\nlet's say a mainstream movie, on the basis of a --\neither their own statement or an attached review, that\nmisrepresents the nature of the movie and makes a claim\nfor the movie, that it's actual child pornography. I\nsuppose in that unusual circumstance, it would be\ncovered. But I guess it would be equally possible for\nsomebody to take one of the countless mainstream movies\nthat portrays a murder on screen, and say this is\nactually a snuff film. There's actually -- this was a\nsnuff film. This was an actual murder. Now, somebody\nwho did that would be clearly misrepresenting the film.\nI don't think they would turn around if somebody tried\nto do something about that false or misleading speech\nand be able to defend on that speech because it would be\nclearly false and misleading speech.\nAnd I think what is important here is if the\nunderlying movie is not child pornography, then truthful\nefforts to promote that movie won't be captured.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Supposing the underlying\nmovie is a depiction of atrocities being committed in\nsome foreign country, in a war zone or something, by\nsoldiers who rape young kids. And so it comes within\nthe literal terms of the statute. And if one said I'd\nlike to take a look at this movie, wouldn't that be\ncovered by the statute?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: If the movie itself comes\nwithin the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The movie itself would be\npictures of soldiers raping young kids.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: And if it were done in a\nsufficiently graphic way, that it was captured --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If the news -- I'm\nthinking of the news reel -- somebody makes as exhibit\nat a war crimes trial, or something like that -- sees\nthis actually happening. Now, as I understand the\nlanguage of the statute, if the person who had that film\ndescribed it to someone he wanted to send it to, he\nwould violate the statute.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Stevens,\nthere's -- I guess there's an anterior problem, which is\nif the depiction were sufficiently graphic --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: They are.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: The person that would have\nthat film would be in possession of child pornography,\nwhich itself would be a problem under the statute. He's\nin the possession of it.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Depiction of a war crime\ntaking place? He saw that on camera -- that would be a\ncrime?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: And that might be an\nexample where, starting with the basic prohibition on\nthe possession of child pornography, that might be a\nsituation where there was a valid as-applied challenge.\nAnd that also might be a situation where there would be\na valid as-applied challenge to the pandering and\nsolicitation provision. But I think the proper way to\nanalyze that is to ask first whether or not something is\ncovered by the basic prohibition.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You do agree I guess that\nthere are some -- there would be some valid as-applied\nchallenges to this statute.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I agree, and I think in\ntheory, at least, there may be valid as-applied\nchallenges to the underlying prohibition. And this\nCourt of course in Ferber recognized that possibility in\nupholding the basic prohibition on the promotion of\nchild pornography in that context.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But Ferber confined the\nmeaning of child pornography to, I think, the greater\nextent than this statute does. It talks about artistic\nvalue, but this -- there were several examples given in\nthe briefs. One was this film depicts 12 year old child\nhaving sexual relations with an old man. Now that\nstatement could be perceived as this film shows child\npornography.\nJust that statement. But it's a truthful\nstatement about Lolita, is it not?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: It is, Justice Ginsburg\nbut I think in context that would not be something that\ncomes within the ambit of the statute. And again, if\nyou start with the proposition that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why not? If you say --\nif you say, 12 year old child -- this film shows a 12\nyear old child, and it doesn't tell you that the person\nwho's playing a 12 year old is a young adult?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I understand that, Justice\nGinsburg. What I would say is this statute in order to\napply, at least the way we interpret it, requires both\nan objective and a subjective component. And so you\nwould have to have a situation where that promotion of\nthe movie objectively would lead somebody to believe\nthat you're marketing in a manner that portrays it as\nactual child pornography. Now I think what you've just\nsaid right there would probably fail at the objective\ntest because I think particularly when you start talking\nabout it being a motion picture and the like, the\nnatural assumption -- let's say it's a mainstream motion\npicture, is going to be oh, that's just actors, it's\nprobably adult actors, or a body double or something. I\ndon't think that comes within the statute.\nThe other thing that's required, of course,\nis a subjective component -- specific intent is the way\nthat we would read the statute. And clearly the person\nwho's marketing Lolita itself and wants people to go see\nit in a mainstream box office does not have the intent\nto convey to people that this is actual, forbidden child\npornography.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well what if an individual\nreceived actual child pornography in the mail that had\nnot been solicited. And he calls the chief of police in\ntown and says I just opened my mail, and this envelope\nis full of child porn. And he's right. I mean, there\nare no body doubles. This is the real thing in here.\nHe has presented child pornography to that\nchief of police and he's violated the statute, hasn't\nhe?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Justice Souter, I would\nsay that the better answer is no, that he has not. Now\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You say no, but you say no\nbecause we won't enforce it that way. But the -- but\nthe objective component and the subjective component in\nmy example are both satisfied.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Justice Souter, I would\nsay no for a more fundamental reason, which is I think\nyou have to read two provisions of the statute here in\npari materia. And the other provision I think that is\nrelevant is the affirmative defense that's in subsection\n(d) of the statute, which is at 6a of the appendix to\nour opening gray brief. And that provides an\naffirmative defense in the situation where somebody is\nin possession of child pornography.\nNow, the first problem the person who gets\nchild pornography in the mail has is that the statute --\nthe bans of possession would apply. Now, there's an\naffirmative defense. The affirmative defense is\nspecific to possession, but one of the things that's a\nprerequisite to qualify for the affirmative defense,\nwhich is in (d)(2)(B) is that you have to afford that\nmaterial -- you have to afford the agency, the law\nenforcement agency, access to the material. Now --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's -- that's fine, but\nbefore you get to that point, you have -- there's still\nan indictable offense. You don't prevent -- you don't\npresent affirmative defenses until you're already\nindicted.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: You're right, Justice\nSouter, but that is a problem both for the prohibition\non possession and it is not a unique problem for the\npandering solicitation provision. And I don't think the\nfact that you might have to if -- in that situation, you\nmight have to actually present your affirmative defense\nin some case is a reason to strike a ban on possession\nas overbroad. But the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But the ban on possession\nis not the real problem because, under a normal\npossession statute, you would indeed have a problem not\nmerely in terms of -- that could be raised not merely by\naffirmative defense but as an element of the statute.\nIf the possession is merely a matter of happenstance,\nthere's an intent problem and presumably there's no --\nthere's no offense. There's no knowing offense in\nacquiring material for the possession.\nBut in the pandering statute, what we've got\nhere is there is -- as you put it earlier, there is an\nunderstanding which happens to be correct, objectively\ncorrect, that there is child porn, and there is a very\nclear intent to convey that message by way of presenting\nthis material to a third party, in this case the police.\nSo I think this is not merely comparable to the problem\nof haphazard possession.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Souter, let\nme try two responses. One is I do think you have a\nproblem even in possession because once you get it in\nthe mail, your possession of it is knowing. And that is\nprecisely why Congress included this affirmative defense\nin the statute. The second thing I would say though is\nagain, we have to read these statutes in pari materia,\nand if one of the ways you qualify for the affirmative\ndefense is you afford access to law enforcement agency\nof the material, I don't think that which is a\nprerequisite for qualifying for the affirmative defense\ncan be independently prohibited --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What if --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- by the statute.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What if you call up your\nneighbor and say God, I got this disgusting child porn\nin the mail?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well -- and, again, I\nthink if you did no more than that, I don't know that\nyou would necessarily be covered by the statute, but if\nyou said I got this disgusting child pornography in the\nmail, it's clearly unlawful, here take a look, I mean I\nsuppose that is covered by the statute. But that\ndoesn't seem like a natural reaction.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Indeed, it is covered by\nthe statute because I read your brief as saying that the\nstatute applies only in instances where either you're\ntrying to sell it or trade it. That is what you're\ntrying -- now it seems to me a different matter if it's\ncovering only -- covering as well instances where\nsomebody's simply showing it to someone else to show him\nwhat he got in the mail. Well, I'd appreciate clarity\non that.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Justice Breyer, I think\nthat we would take the position that even if you are\npresenting the material, making it available, but you're\nnot charging for it, you're not exchanging it, you're\njust offering it for free, here's a quick free look,\nit's still covered by the statute.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If that's covered by the\nstatute, what you're going to do then is suddenly\ncriminalize what could be an awful lot of activity that\ngoes on in schools all over the place and somebody\nhas -- they think it's funny, and maybe it isn't funny,\nbut they think it is and it's kind of school-boy\nbehavior, and they're showing this stuff around, not\ntotally certain what it is. Suddenly that can become a\nFederal crime. Seems like quite an extension. And I\nthought you'd written your way out of that problem, and\nnow I think you haven't.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Breyer, I\nmean, you know, I think you could certainly interpret\nthe statute to write around that problem if you wanted\nto, but I do think the most natural reading of the terms\n\"promotes, distributes, presents, and advertises\" is to\ncapture not just somebody who is making that available\nto the market for sale or for barter, but also somebody\nwho says look, I have child pornography, I want to get\nyou interested in this, this is the real stuff, here\ntake a look.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's a very\ndifferent thing. I read your brief the same way Justice\nBreyer did and particularly footnote 4 of the reply\nbrief, which I understood to be giving \"presents,\" for\nexample in this statute, a promotional meaning in light\nof the other words around it, \"advertises, promotes\" and\nsimply telling your -- you know, your neighbor, I got\nthis, what should I do about it, isn't promotional. It\nmay be in a technical term \"presents,\" but it's not\npromotional.\nAnd, again, I understood your brief to\nsuggest that you have to interpret all of those words in\nan advertising, soliciting sense.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Mr. Chief Justice,\nhere -- I mean I think my first cut at drawing the line\nwould to be say it's not a problem to say, can you\nbelieve what I got in the mail, and talk to your\nneighbor about it, describe it.\nOn the other hand, I do think you're\npresenting the materials if you say, I got this in the\nmail, look at this, isn't this disgusting, this is\nclearly child pornography.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Then take it as\nthat.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: If you think though --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Take it as that. I would\nsay looking and presenting to schoolmates dirty pictures\nis a fairly common adolescent and post-adolescent\nactivity. And I would suspect a very high-level\npercentage of that class of people don't examine too\ncarefully what the age of the individuals depicted is,\nand many might misrepresent what that age is. So this\nsounds like a statute that has enormous reach, whereas\npreviously I thought it hadn't.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Breyer, if\nyou think that's the difference between expanding this\nstatute in some enormous way and not, then I would\ninvite you to have a more restrictive view of\n\"presents.\" And we certainly want you to interpret the\nstatute in a way that renders it not overbroad. And, of\ncourse, this Court has made clear on a number of\noccasions that, before you get to the overbreadth\nanalysis, you are applying the early constructions to\nmake sure that the statute if possible --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- is construed to be\nconstitutional. But if I could just -- I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I just wanted to clarify\nthe footnote to which the Chief referred, that footnote\n4 in your reply brief. It says, to the contrary, the\ngovernment's brief expressly acknowledges that the\nstatute's proscription encompasses noncommercial speech.\nSo I think Justice Breyer's suggestion that\nyou said in your brief, that the statute is limited to\ncommercial speech, is something that you -- say, no,\nthat's not so; we say it encompasses noncommercial\nspeech.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I\nthink there may be a distinction to be drawn. We\ncertainly don't think that it's limited to commercial\nspeech if by \"commercial speech\" you mean only efforts\nto buy or sell or even only efforts to barter. Because\nwe think that somebody who sort of systematically is\noperating a web site where they are giving away child\npornography and advertising it as such would be clearly\ncovered by the statute.\nSo, to the extent that the distinction\nbetween commercial and noncommercial is at the line\nwhere you would say you're giving it away gratis, we\nthink that's still covered. Now, I gather that maybe\nJustice Breyer had a different conception in mind, that\nyou really have the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: My understanding was\nnot that it was limited to commercial speech. That was\nclear from the footnote that I cited. But that\n\"presents\" was limited to promotional activity. It's\none thing to present and say either whether to law\nenforcement or your neighbor; it's another thing to\npromote the child pornography. And I thought your brief\nwas adopting a limited construction of words like\n\"presents\" that would cover only promotional activity.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, in fairness,\nMr. Chief Justice, I think we had a slightly broader\nconception of \"presents.\" What we were thinking that\n\"presents\" means is really when you are not just sort\nof -- you know -- in some abstract way talking about\npresenting the material, but you're actually furnishing\nthe material to somebody else.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, General Clement, is\nthere --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: And --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Is there anything to suggest\nthat some of these hypotheticals, where people get child\npornography unsolicited in the mail or that kids at\nschool are showing each other not just dirty pictures\nbut actual child pornography, are situations that occur\nwith any frequency in the real world?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Not at all, Justice Alito,\nand I think that's an important point with respect to\nJustice Breyer's hypothetical. I mean you have to\nremember that the materials that we're talking about\nhere are in the main materials that are unlawful even to\npossess. And it is also true that the -- in the wake of\nFerber, a pretty good job was done of getting these\nmaterials out of the real world. So the kind of\npictures that are --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. I\nlost -- in your answer, I lost a negative or something.\nAre you saying that this type of activity frequently\noccurs or infrequently occurs?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Infrequently occurs --\nespecially in the real world, which is to say when\npictures or magazines are being handed around from\nadolescent to adolescent, there is really no reason in\nthe world to suspect that what's being handed from\nadolescent to adolescent is child pornography as opposed\nto adult pornography -- Playboy and that sort of thing.\nBecause the truth of the matter is in the\nwake of Ferber, a pretty good job has been done in\nstamping out child pornography in the real world. It\nhas moved, unfortunately, on to the Internet. And, in\nthat context, when people are promoting it as actual\nchild pornography or soliciting it as actual child\npornography --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The universe of child\npornography includes activities of 17-year olds.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: It does, Justice Stevens,\nbut so, too, for the basic prohibition. And I think\nwhat's important here is there may be some definitional,\nyou know, questions. Or you may have a view that there\nare applications of the statute that would be\nunconstitutional.\nBut what's important, I think, is that this\npandering and solicitation provision doesn't add some\nnew definition, some more aggressive definition. It\nsimply picks up the notion of the basic definition of\nchild pornography, and it says that if you're taking\nmaterials and you are offering them to the market as\nactual child pornography, if you are soliciting actual\nchild pornography, then the government can go after the\ndirect acts of solicitation and offering and -- and --\nprosecute those acts without --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Even though -- even\nthough what you are, in fact, showing or presenting does\nnot fit the definition? Even if what you're showing --\nyou say, have I got some hot child porn and here it is,\nand the \"it\" is -- is -- an adult pretending to be a\nchild, or a virtual image.\nSo the -- the problem is not an accurate\nrepresentation that this is hardcore porn, and it is,\nbut saying, have I got the real stuff, but what you\npresent is not at all the real stuff.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: That's right, Justice\nGinsburg. If the scienter requirements are satisfied\nand I'm consciously trying to get you to believe that\neven though I have something that for some technical\nreason is not the real thing, what I'm offering you is\nthe real thing, the statute does target that. But that\nseems to me to not be a First Amendment problem.\nIt seems to be a natural consequence of\nCongress taking the Court's advice in Free Speech\nCoalition and moving from a prohibition on materials\nthat had been pandered to the actual acts of pandering\nand solicitation themselves.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And is that your answer to\nthe -- all of the hypotheticals that are put forth in\nthe Coalition for Free Speech, the Catholic Bishops, the\nadvertisement in amazon.com or Netflix, then?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Kennedy, we\nthink that all those hypotheticals are taken out with\nmore than one reason. I mean, I think from the Catholic\nBishops --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Let's -- pardon me.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Sure.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Let's assume for the\nmoment that there are minors, so that the content aspect\nof it is film.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Oh --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That there are real minors\nin some of these things.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: But are there real minors\nengaging in forbidden activity?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Actual child pornography?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, if the underlying\nmaterial is actually child pornography, then you may be\nin a different situation. All of the hypotheticals in\nthat brief were with materials -- the underlying\nmaterials were not child pornography.\nAnd I think that's an important distinction,\nbecause if you're taking a movie like \"Traffic\" or\n\"American Beauty,\" which is not child pornography --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Right.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: -- and you're simply\ntruthfully promoting it, you have nothing to worry about\nwith this statute.\nNow, if you took something -- I also think\nthat the Catholic Bishop situation isn't covered,\nbecause that is not promoting, presenting and\ndistributing --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If one had a hand held\nvideo at a school or something like that?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I mean, again -- I\nmean, if you had a hand held video and the video itself\nwas child pornography, and then you got that on the\nInternet or otherwise and decided you wanted to promote\nthat, I mean would be covered by the statute. But --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: There are two things that\nyou -- that all of us have to work with here. One is\nthe scienter component here. Is that overly broad,\nvague, and so forth? The other is the content.\nAnd my concern is the same as that indicated\nby Justice Stevens at the outset. There are some\nterrible practices in the child-trafficking area where\nchildren are held in brothels for the most debased of\nacts. There are abuses in prisons, abuses in schools.\nIf there are videotapes showing those\nthings, it seems to me that the statute is -- that\nthey're clearly covered by the statute, and maybe even a\nkilling of a little girl in public might be sadistic.\nAssume that that's covered by the statute.\nIs there anything in the \"presents\" and the\n\"promotes\" language in the scienter component of the\nstatute that gives some protection to these materials?\nIs it just as-applied? Is that what we have to do?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Here is how I would try to\nanalyze it, Justice Kennedy, which is I would say that\nthere would be an as- applied challenge there because\nthe basic prohibition on child pornography that would\napply to the underlying materials, there would be an\nas-applied exception to that. And therefore, the\npandering and the solicitation of that would be equally\noutside the constitutional --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So we want the public to\nsee this to show them how bad it is, and that is\npermitted under the statute, because it is not\n\"presenting\"?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I mean there would be\nanother way to try to get at that.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I agree with you that we\nhave different motives.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Right.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I'm not sure that the\nstatute covers that.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, there might be a way\nin which the statute could cover it, and it would be, as\nfollows, which basically is if I'm going to portray that\nas material that is -- and I'm going to portray it only\nin a way that makes it clear that I have a valid\nas-applied challenge, then I'm not sure I would be\nsatisfying the objective and the subjective scienter\nrequirements for that statute. Because it would be\nclear that, although I was presenting it as visual\ndepictions of children who had that happen to them, I\nwas presenting it exclusively for its scientific,\nartistic, literary value. And, therefore, in a sense, I\nwas building my as-applied challenge into the way I was\nmarketing it. I think you could --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, you have a\nproblem not just with the presenting, not just with the\npandering of it. You have a problem with the mere\npossession of it. You have to find some exception for\nthat anyway. You have to find some as- applied\nchallenge exception for the mere possession of it, even\nif you don't pander it.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Scalia,\nthat's exactly right. And that's why I would think the\nlogical way to proceed would be you would find an\nas-applied exception to the basic prohibition. And\nthen, naturally, that would apply to the pandering\nprovision.\nI was only sort of suggesting, if pressed,\nthat in some ways it might actually be easier to find a\nway to get that outside the statute with respect to the\npandering and solicitation provision than for the\npossession for this.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But how would you do it in\nthe case -- you mentioned that if there is not actual\nchild porn shown, and there is a truthful or honest\nstatement about it, that there is nothing to worry\nabout.\nBut what about the movie reviewer who is\nreviewing the latest re-release or something of the\n\"Lolita\" film and says this depicts sexual activity with\na minor?\nThat statement is true. It would be taken\nby some naive people as saying boy, this is what it\nshows, the real thing. That is a truthful statement.\nAnd yet, it would still fall within the prohibition of\nthe statute.\nAs I understand your position, the only way\nthat statement would be truthful in a way that would\nexcuse would be if the reviewer said this depicts sexual\nactivity with a minor, but of course the actor wasn't\nreally a minor. Isn't that correct?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: No, that is not correct,\nJustice Souter. And I would say that that hypothetical\nis outside the ambit of the statute for two reasons.\nFirst of all, I don't think that the movie\nreviewer is promoting or presenting the underlying\nmaterials. They would be out for that reason.\nI also think they would be out because, when\nyou started applying the objective and the subjective\nrequirements of the statute, you would not find either\nof them satisfied with respect to that.\nIf I know you're talking about a mainstream\nmovie, and you say it depicts sex with a minor, I'm not\ngoing to naturally think that comes within the ambit of\nthe statute, that it is actual child pornography within\nthe meaning of the statute.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What if you are 17 years\nold and you haven't gone to law school and you haven't\nread these cases? You may very well assume that.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: With respect, Justice\nSouter, that's why I think it is important to have both\nan objective and a subjective requirement. And I think\nthe objective requirement alone would take that out.\nIf I could reserve the remainder of --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do we use a seven year old\nfor the objective requirement?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: No, I wouldn't think so.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We would use a --\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think we would use a\nreasonable person. That's why --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- reasonable adult, I had\nthought.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Exactly, and that's why I\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Wouldn't we use -- wouldn't\nwe use a reasonable personal of the sort who goes to\nmovies?\nGENERAL CLEMENT: That would be fine,\nJustice Souter, and if --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I would suppose my 17 year\nold, non- law-school graduate would be within the ambit\nof the reasonable class.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: And I would submit that\neven a 17 year old, non-law student would know that\nmovies depict things that don't actually happen. When\nthey see a murder on screen, that's not actually a\nmurder. And so I think they would understand that\nthat's a movie. It's not child pornography.\nIf I may reserve the remainder of my time.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You could -- just one\nquestion. You mentioned a film, \"Traffic,\" which I did\nnot see, but one of the briefs said there was an actual\n17 year old playing that part.\nBut you said that wouldn't be -- that\nwouldn't fit.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: \"Traffic\" is not child\npornography. I understand that the actress was 17 at\nthe time of the film, but we don't think that comes\nwithin the ambit of the basic prohibition on child\npornography, because we think that simulated sexual\nactivity has to be interpreted with enough subtlety that\nit doesn't capture that. And that's the position --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the statute says\nsimulated.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: It does. But so does the\nstatute in Ferber. And we don't think that introduced\nany overbreadth or vagueness that was fatal. This\nstatute here just picks up on that definition. It\ndoesn't add to it.\nIf I may reserve --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Clement.\nMr. Diaz.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD J. DIAZ\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT\nMR. DIAZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe pandering provision of the PROTECT Act\ncarries a 5-year mandatory minimum prison term and a\npossible 20-year prison term, has no affirmative defense\nprovision. It is unconstitutionally vague and\noverbroad, because on its face it captures protected\nspeech about materials. And it captures speech about\nmaterials that may not even in fact exist.\nThe language \"in a manner that reflects the\nbelief, or that is intended to cause another to\nbelieve,\" does not sufficiently define prohibited\nconduct giving law enforcement unfettered discretion to\nsubjectively enforce the statute.\nIn essence, as the Eleventh Circuit held,\nthe determination does not rest on what materials\ncontain, but rather on how someone conveys his or her\nimpression about what the materials convey. In other\nwords, this statute, in short, punishes thought,\nbeliefs, expressions, and opinions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, there's a\ndifference, isn't there, between beliefs and thoughts\nabout -- what, the legality of a particular type of\npornography or something like that, and a factual\nmatter? I thought this was child pornography? Saying\nthis regulates thoughts and beliefs, those are two quite\ndifferent questions, aren't they?\nMR. DIAZ: Yes, it is, Mr. Chief Justice.\nAnd one of the problems with the statute, and just\nanother example of what we've been talking about here --\namazon.com and Netflix -- there's also, for example, a\nseries of photography that we've seen nationwide by\nfamous photographers of minors or children,\nphotographers of child modeling agencies --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But none of those -- I\nmean, we've gone through this with the Solicitor\nGeneral. He went through every example in his brief\nthat you've been able to produce, and he said they\naren't caught by the statute. What's wrong with what he\nsaid? Why isn't that so?\nMR. DIAZ: If --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Photographers, for example.\nThat's not child pornography. And if it was, they would\nhave to act -- if it is child pornography under Ferber,\nit isn't protected. If it isn't child pornography under\nFerber, well, then there's no problem. Okay. That's\ntheir view of the photographers. And the same with\nAmazon, the same with Netflix.\nMR. DIAZ: Correct. The problem is if I\nwere to take anything such as the CNN video of an actual\nsexually explicit conduct involving a minor, or if I\nwere to take any of these films, if I were to start an\nInternet blog and say, look, this film contains sexual\nconduct of a minor, and I think we should do something\nabout this, I think we should form a coalition or I\nthink we should boycott it. And I am conveying the\nbelief. I am intending to make you believe that what\nthose materials contain, albeit what they really have or\nwhat they really are, is illegal.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Problem with Ferber, you\nsaid. Same problem.\nMR. DIAZ: Yes, sir.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So what's your response to\nwhat he said? It is the -- with possession. You\npossess these materials. What you are trying to do is\ntake them to the police and stop them. Under Ferber, is\nthat protected or not? If it is protected, as I think\nit would be, so is it here.\nMR. DIAZ: I do not think it would be\nprotected.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then under Ferber he's\ngoing to go right to jail because he has them. I would\nthink it would be protected. I can't imagine somebody\nwho collects, on these sites where they are molesting\nchildren, material to prevent children being molested\nand presents it to the proper authority is going to be\nprosecuted under the New York statute in Ferber.\nMR. DIAZ: If the material substantively\nviolates the statute, then the mere possession of them\nis illegal. And there is a defense under the possession\npart of the statute for presenting them to the police\nwithin a certain amount of time and within a certain\nmanner of your conduct.\nWhat we're talking about here is not the\npossession of the materials. We're talking about the\nexpression about what the materials contain. Even if\nyou're wrong about it, even if you're mistaken, even if\nyou're lying about it, even if you're bragging about it,\nthe traditional prankster, as Senator Leahy said in the\ncongressional report, one of the things we're concerned\nabout with the statute is that it could capture people\nwho are expressing salacious thoughts.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Or just good honest liars,\nright? I had thought that the purpose of the First\nAmendment was to protect speech that had some value, and\nthat the reason obscenity is excluded entirely from\nFirst Amendment protection is that it has no redeeming\nsocial value.\nWhat social value do you find in being able\nto lie about the content of what you're offering to\nsomebody else? You say somehow if you're lying about\nit, oh, well, then the First Amendment protects that. I\nwould think if you're lying about it, it is clearer than\never the First Amendment doesn't protect it. There is\nno social value in protecting lies.\nMR. DIAZ: One of the problems with the\nissue of social value and lying is that we don't put\npeople in jail for 5 mandatory minimum years or 20 years\nin prison for simply lying. We simply don't do that. I\nagree with Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But it depends on what\nthey're lying about. If they're lying about the value\nof what they're selling, you know, it's fraud.\nMR. DIAZ: And I agree with Your Honor --\nJustice Scalia, that we have a slew of State statutes\nparticularly in the area of consumer fraud. If I\npretend to have something that's illegal and offer it to\nyou or promote it to you or advertise it to you, and I\nhave nothing, then that person can and should be\npunished, but not for -- not under this statute.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Tell me what social value\nare we protecting here, by protecting the lie about\nwhether this thing that really isn't child pornography\nis? What -- why would we want to protect that?\nMR. DIAZ: We necessarily do not want to\nprotect that. But we don't punish it with a 5 to\n20-year prison sentence.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Are you complaining about\nthe degree of the penalty?\nMR. DIAZ: It is not just the degree of the\npenalty. The statute doesn't just cover liars, Justice\nScalia. It also covers people who are mistaken. It\ncovers exaggeration. It covers puffing.\nFor example, if I have a legitimate clean\nvideotape that I want to duplicate, I may be violating\ntrademark or other patent laws or whatnot, but I want to\ntake this and I want to sell it in the marketplace over\nthe Internet. And I exaggerate by the words that I\nchoose to use in promoting that tape for commercial\npurpose, for example, and I'm exaggerating.\nThat person if they market the materials in\na way that causes the potential buyers to believe that\nwhat it has is illegal, even if I'm just puffing or\nbragging, the car salesman in a car sales situation, we\ndon't like it --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's an\nentirely different thing to say that this car is a great\ncar and it turns out not to be a great car, and to say\nwhat you have is either -- is not -- is child\npornography when, in fact, it's not. Those are two\ndifferent things.\nMR. DIAZ: I think it could be very -- in\nthe real world I think it is very easy for a person to\npuff about what materials contain that are lawful to\npossess, such as Titanic, Lolita or American Beauty.\nAnd all you would have to say is, put a trailer on it\nand say that this is hot graphic teen sex, and you're\npuffing about what it really is. We know -- you know it\nreally isn't.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The statute has an\nobjective component. To the objective observer, it must\nreasonably cause them to believe that it's actually\nchild pornography. So that -- that would be -- that\nwould prevent sort of the vague puffery that you're\ntalking about from being covered while still covering\nsomething that satisfies both the subjective and\nobjective test.\nMR. DIAZ: Mr. Chief Justice, I think that\nif a person listens to or hears somebody describe\nTitanic, Lolita, American Beauty or any of the films of\nthe like as hot graphic teen sex, I think a reasonable\nordinary person could believe that what is being\nportrayed is proscribed material, even if it doesn't\nexist, or even if it exists and is protected under\nFerber.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You seem to think we are\npunishing the lying. I don't read the statute as\npunishing the lying.\nMR. DIAZ: No, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You'd be punished even if\nit were true. What is being punished is the pandering.\nYou are the one that's bringing in the lying example.\nYou say, my goodness, even if the pandering is a lie,\npandering is pandering. And I don't see why there is\nsome special protection against pandering when in\naddition to pandering, you're lying.\nMaybe you ought to get extra penalty.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But, in fact, the statute\ndoes not provide extra penalty. It just provides a\npenalty for pandering. And I don't know why it's a good\ndefense to that to say, oh, I was actually lying. I\nmean --\nMR. DIAZ: I don't think -- I think the\nstatute covers people who brag, people who puff, people\nwho tell the truth, who --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about \"present\"?\nThe word \"pandering\" itself is not used in the statute.\nIt uses a lot of words, \"promote\" and \"advertise\" --\nwell, maybe that's just redundant. I guess that would\nbe the government's position -- but \"present,\"\n\"distribute\" -- what else?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: All of those verbs only\nbecome pandering when they are attached to explicit\nsexual material. When you promote explicit sex, you are\npandering. I mean, the word pandering does have a\nsexual connotation. I -- I think -- I had thought it\nwas accepted that we have here a statute that's directed\nagainst pandering.\nMR. DIAZ: But the problem with the statute,\nwhile it does capture pandering and illegal conduct, it\ngoes beyond that and captures a slew of innocent conduct\nwhich we discussed this morning in the examples --\nJUSTICE ALITO: What would you say is the\nbest realistic example that you can provide to show that\nthis is overbroad?\nMR. DIAZ: The best and realistic example\nwould be any person, not necessarily amazon.com or\nNetflix, it could be a private citizen. It could be a\nreligious leader of a religious group, regardless of\nwhat type of religion we're talking about.\nIt could be any of those people --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Doing -- doing what?\nMR. DIAZ: Who look at the -- the Nan Goldin\npictures, who look at Lolita, Traffic and all of these\nother movies and harbor a belief that it is obscene,\nwhich is one of the two types of materials that's\nproscribed.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose we did this? What\nwould you think about an opinion, and why, which says\nthe following? We take every one of those examples and\nall the ones listed here and put them in appendix A, and\nthe opinion says this is the Solicitor General's\ninterpretation of the statute, as amended, say with the\nword presentment, which comes out of promotion infer,\nand we think under that interpretation of the statute,\nnone of these things, nor anything like them, could be\nprosecuted.\nAnd if so understood, we can find no\nexample, at least none not present in Ferber itself,\nwhere this would be overbroad. Therefore, it is\nconstitutional. I'm not saying that is my view. I am\nsaying simply I want to know your opinion about what\nwould be wrong with such an opinion.\nMR. DIAZ: My opinion, Justice Breyer, is\nthat could be done. We could put a dozen or two dozen\nor three dozen, an exponential number of examples, that\nwould be excluded. Essentially we would be writing an\naffirmative defense into the statute or an absolute\ndefense that would prohibit even the prosecution. The\nconcern that that raises for me, in answer to Your\nHonor's question, is you're still going to have a\nchilling on free speech. There are still going to be\npeople out there who are not covered by one of these\nexamples who we haven't thought of, and that person is\ngoing to be afraid to express opinions.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I suppose if we were\ngoing to do that it would be simpler and maybe prudent\nfor us to reexamine our overbreadth rule. Your client\nhere falls within none of these examples. He was\nconvicted of having what everyone recognizes as not only\nchild pornography but involving a very small child. And\nhe knew what it was. And he -- and he conveyed that\nbelief.\nGiven the fact that it would appear that\nchild pornography is a growing problem, a serious\nproblem on the Internet, maybe we should examine the\noverbreadth rule and just say that your client cannot\nmake this challenge.\nMR. DIAZ: The Court can certainly do that,\nJustice Kennedy. Essentially, though, I think what the\nCourt would be doing would be taking the four areas of\nspeech that have been taken out of the First Amendment\nprotection, which is defamation, the fighting words\nunder Brandenburg, Miller, which is obscenity, and the\nadditional extension of Ferber. Now what we would be\ndoing is carving yet another area of speech out of the\nFirst Amendment, and we're just going to continue\nchipping it away and chipping it away.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. I don't think\nthat is responsive to Justice Kennedy's point. You\nwouldn't be carving it out of the First Amendment. You\nwould be saying we're going to treat this area like\nother areas, which would say that whoever is challenging\nit has to show that they're a problematic case.\nIn other words, your client is relying -- he\ndidn't produce Lolita. You're relying on the effect on\nother people, and that is what our overbreadth doctrine\nallows, if there's a substantial amount of speech that's\nprotected. And what I understood the question to\nsuggest is that we would wait basically for as-applied\nchallenges when Lolita is being prosecuted and we would\nhear from them, but not in your case.\nMR. DIAZ: That certainly could be done,\nMr. Chief Justice. Again, and as I suggested earlier,\nthe problem with that is that we're not talking about\nanything less than a criminal statute, a criminal\nstatute that implicates the First Amendment, freedom and\nthought which this Court since its very existence has\nsaid we have to honor and respect, even if people are\nthinking about nasty or dirty things.\nThat's what this country is based upon, and\nthe grave concern if we're going to do it on an\nas-applied challenge, is people who might be afraid to\nexpress their views about whether this is or is not\nobscene. It's is the parent of a neighborhood group who\nsee a movie and wants to tell everybody about it and\nsay, look --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Here we have -- we have one\nstatute that covers advertising, promoting, presenting,\ndistributing, and soliciting. Suppose that all of those\nactivities were not lumped together in one statute, and\nthere was a separate provision for each, and suppose\nthat the Court were to conclude that there is a problem\nwith one of them. Let's say promotes or presents.\nWould all of the others fall as well, under\nthe overbreadth doctrine, if they were set out in\nseparate statutory provisions?\nMR. DIAZ: I believe that that would more\nnarrowly tailor the statute, but I don't believe,\nJustice Alito, that it would solve the problem of\nchilling speech.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but isn't the problem\nthe problem of your answer to Justice Breyer's\nhypothetical. He said, you know, what if we have this\nappendix and we list -- I forget what he said, three\ndozen examples that the Solicitor General says wouldn't\nbe covered and that sounds fine to us. Your answer was\nwell, there would still be some examples not covered.\nBut isn't -- isn't the answer to that that\nthere would be some conceivable overbreadth, I suppose,\nno matter what the appendix said? Somewhere out there\nthere would be an example not covered that would be the\nbasis for an as-applied challenge, but there wouldn't be\nsubstantial overbreadth. And isn't that the case? That\nif Justice Breyer's hypo were in fact the decision of\nthis case, there wouldn't be a fair argument that there\nis any substantial overbreadth left to the statute,\nisn't that so?\nMR. DIAZ: That -- it could be, and that\nwould depend. I agree with Your Honor, Justice Souter,\nthat we have this world or this universe of overbroad\nspeech, and the appendix would shrink it and make it\nnarrower.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And rewrite -- and\nessentially rewriting the law, and that's my question\nabout this technique that Justice Breyer has proposed.\nThis Court is not generally in the business of writing\nappendices that say well, the statute couldn't apply in\nthis situation, and it couldn't apply and as long as we\nput those contours around it. Certainly the Court could\nwrite an opinion that would inform Congress why this\nparticular statute as written is overbroad, and explain\nwhat kind of statute wouldn't be overbroad.\nBut for the Court itself, I think that\nthat -- I don't know any instance in which we have\nprovided that kind of appendix that said things that are\nlike Traffic, they're okay, and things that are like\nsomething else are not okay. I don't know.\nMR. DIAZ: With respect, my initial response\nto Justice Breyer's suggestion, if you will, was the\nsame as Your Honor, Justice Ginsburg. I don't know that\ncreating an appendix of examples is going to cure the\nproblem. I do concede that it would lessen the problem.\nWe would -- we would --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why would it lessen? I\nassume whatever you put in an appendix, saying all these\nother situations that are not before us are not covered.\nIsn't that the most blatant dictum? But -- but -- and,\nof course, we're not bound in later cases by our dicta.\nBut come to think of it, I guess the whole doctrine of\noverbreadth rests upon dictum, doesn't it? It -- it\nrests upon our determination in this case, which\ninvolves somebody who undoubtedly was selling child\nporn, and a horrible kind of child porn -- we say in\nthis case, oh, we can -- we can contemplate other cases,\nwhere we would not hold the person guilty. That is all\ndictum, too, isn't it?\nSo I guess the whole doctrine is -- is based\non dictum. So we may as well put it in all an appendix.\nLet's put our dictum in an appendix. I agree.\nMR. DIAZ: In answer to Your Honor's\nquestion or comment --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. DIAZ: -- the -- I agree that the issue\nof overbreadth is something where we're looking at\nboundaries. And that's really what I think the Court\ndoes in a situation of overbreadth analysis. You look\nat the boundaries. How much -- how far we've gone\noutside of the boundaries of what is protected.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but it's the\nboundary between what is -- what should be protected in\nrelation to what's unprotected.\nSo what's the ratio between legitimate films\nlike Lolita and illegitimate child pornography? In\nother words, is, in fact, the protected material\nsubstantial in relation to the law's legitimate sweep?\nMR. DIAZ: The problem is we don't have an\nempirical answer, a mathematic answer to that question.\nWhat we do know is that films like Lolita, American\nBeauty, and whatnot, which if presented in a certain way\ncan bring people under the coverage of the statute, have\nreceived acclaim around the world, I mean all sorts of\nacademy awards. They're seen time and time again.\nThey're seen on Netflix. They're seen on cable TV. To\nthis day, some of these movies have been around for 30\nyears.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Of course, the point of the\n-- the point of the appendix, which unfortunately has\nthe failing of many charming metaphors, is that it has\nacquired a life of its own.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: It distracts from the\nquestion. But it -- as I read the Solicitor General's\ninterpretation of the statute, and amended it, taking\nthe word \"presentment\" from its context in Ferber, where\nit was part of the definition of promotion, I thought\nthat was the appendix. At least, that's my hypothetical\nquestion. And so whether you like appendices or don't\nlike appendices, you could focus on why isn't it the\nappendix I'm talking about?\nHe's filled it with qualifications using the\nwords \"knowingly, reasonable,\" and a context that if it\nis not purely commercial, as I understood, is at least\ncommercial plus a few things such as bartering.\nThat was really my question, and you've come\nback to American Beauty and so forth, and if there's one\nthing I think his definition keeps out of this\ndiscussion, it is American Beauty and Traffic, because I\ndon't see under his interpretation how anyone could\nconceivably be prosecuted even if he's talking to a\ngroup who have never seen a movie. That isn't a\nreasonable group of people. So what is your response to\nwhat he said?\nMR. DIAZ: My response, Justice Breyer, is\nthat if you take the word \"present\" and you give it the\nmeaning that it was given in Ferber, you make the\nstatute narrower. You make it -- bring it into more of\na constitutionally acceptable realm, but I respectfully\ndo not believe that it cures the entire problem, and my\nbasis for saying that the question of Justice Souter of\nthe Solicitor General. You know -- the concern is, when\nyou don't have lawyers who understand these\nhypertechnical meanings that the Court is going to give\nand the interpretations we're going to put on them --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But isn't the answer to\nthat you may still have some overbreadth left, but it's\nnot substantial? Most 17 year olds are, in fact, going\nto realize that the real thing is not going on in, you\nknow, the Lolita movie. And if we accept that as a\nfactual proposition, which was the Solicitor General's\nanswer, and if we also accept, not by way of appendix\nbut way of rationale in the opinion, that these various\nactivities have got to be given an essentially\ncommercial or quasi-commercial character, so that they\ndon't pick up the conversations with the neighbor, then\nthat's simply a matter of statutory interpretation that\ncould be part of our rationale. If we accept the\nfactual proposition about what reasonable viewers are\nlikely to know, and we engage in that kind of\ninterpretation following the Solicitor General's view of\nhow this serial list of activities should be construed,\ndon't we eliminate the possibility -- wouldn't we\neliminate the possibility of substantial overbreadth?\nSome things may get by. There may still be legitimate\napplied challenges, but substantial overbreadth, would\nthat be left?\nMR. DIAZ: I think it would, but concededly\nto a lesser degree, because once you make it clear as to\nwhat matters are not covered by the statute, it makes it\neasier for people to conform their conduct and their\nwords accordingly. The concern that I have is that it\nstill chills a -- it still chills free speech. If a\nperson looks at an appendix or looks at the rationale in\nthe Court's opinion in this case --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It can, but can you give me\nan example of a class of activities that would not be,\nin effect, insulated from indictment by these two steps\nin the opinion, that would be of substantial character?\nMR. DIAZ: Certainly, and I go back to the\nquestion of Justice Breyer which is adolescents, 17 year\nolds, 18 year olds, who like to look at these types of\nmaterials and one of them could simply say to another\nover the Internet, you know, do you think we can get\nsome hardcore child porn? He's soliciting child porn\nfrom another person, and that individual, that 17 year\nold kid, who's fantasizing or experimenting with his own\nsexuality, can go to jail for 5 to 20 years. And we see\nthat in everyday America, in high schools around the\ncountry.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do we see them getting\nprosecuted in any state?\nMR. DIAZ: If he's soliciting materials\nunder sub (i) or sub (ii) of the statute, of the\npandering provision of the statute, yes. That person\ncan be prohibited. Excuse me, that person can be\nprosecuted.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I asked you have there\nbeen such cases? A lot of states have pandering laws\nnow, and is the case that you posit a case that has\noccurred in any of those states?\nMR. DIAZ: Your Honor, I cannot cite a\nspecific example, but I can certainly tell Your Honor\nthis -- prosecutions from 1997 to 2004 have increased\nover 452 percent. The conviction rate --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Maybe that's because the\nquantity of material has increased.\nMR. DIAZ: Exactly. And the conviction rate\nis 99.6 percent. And --\nJUSTICE ALITO: And if one person says to\nanother, can we get some child pornography, how is that\nsolicitation?\nMR. DIAZ: \"Can you get me.\"\nJUSTICE ALITO: Oh, \"can you get me.\"\nMR. DIAZ: \"Can you get me.\"\nJUSTICE ALITO: And you think that's\nprotected by the First Amendment? Asking someone for\nchild pornography is protected?\nMR. DIAZ: First of all, it may not be\nprotected by the First Amendment, but it shouldn't be\ncaptured by this statute, which puts that 17 year old in\njail for 5 to 20 years.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The only thing that\nlimits the statute is the First Amendment. What else --\nyou say it may not be covered by the First Amendment.\nWhat else gives you a right to challenge the statute?\nMR. DIAZ: I don't think that it is\nnecessarily not covered by the First Amendment. I think\ncertainly the First Amendment -- and this Court has\nheld, that we protect salacious thoughts, salacious\nideas.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But it's not thought at that\npoint. It's a request to obtain contraband, which fuels\nthe production of the contraband. Is it protected by\nthe First Amendment or not, soliciting child\npornography?\nMR. DIAZ: I think the First Amendment is\nimplied, but I don't think it becomes criminal conduct\nuntil you get to either an attempt, solicitation, or a\nconspiracy. You have to do more than just say I would\nlike to get it or can you get it for me, to be guilty of\nthe statute.\nJUSTICE ALITO: To fall -- to fall under the\nstatute or to be protected by the First Amendment or not\nprotected by the First Amendment?\nMR. DIAZ: Right.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Which is it?\nMR. DIAZ: To fall within the protection of\nthe First Amendment. And another example that comes to\nmind is a person has material which they believe is\nchild pornography. They give it to somebody else, such\nas Lolita, for an opinion and they present to it that\nperson. One of the biggest problems or one of the\nbiggest -- the verb that's most objectionable in the\nstatute is \"present,\" because it does not have to have\nany commercial requirement.\nJUSTICE ALITO: I mean the model penal code\nhas a general prohibition of soliciting illegal\nactivities. Are you saying that that's -- that\nprovision violates the First Amendment? Because it's\njust words?\nMR. DIAZ: Solicitation is a crime in and of\nitself, and talking about or expressing a desire to\nobtain is not -- doesn't quite go to the level of\nsolicitation or intent, where there has to be a\nproximity in time, in immediacy, and a certain\ngeographical proximity between the words and the comment\nthat you intend.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But I thought the word in\nthe statute is \"solicit.\"\nMR. DIAZ: Well, there's \"solicit\" and\nthere's also \"present.\" It works in both directions.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If you're asking somebody\nfor child pornography, you're not presenting child\npornography.\nMR. DIAZ: Correct. I agree.\nThank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Diaz.\nGeneral Clement, you have three minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. PAUL D. CLEMENT\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice.\nOverbreadth, as this court has reminded us\nany number of times, is strong medicine, and that is\nwhy, even in the First Amendment context, as-applied\nchallenges remain the basic building blocks of\nadjudication. Rejection of this overbreadth challenge\nhere does not mean that the courts will not be open to\nhere as-applied challenges going forward. Of course,\nthe Respondent here has no claim that the statute is\nunconstitutional as applied to him.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can we reject the\noverbreadth challenge here and still leave an\noverbreadth doctrine for some other cases? I'm not sure\nhow we could do that.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I think you could,\nJustice Kennedy. You could -- I mean the burden here is\non the challenger who doesn't say that the statute's\nunconstitutional as-applied to them to show substantial\noverbreadth in absolute terms and relative to the\nstatute's legitimate sweep. And it's interesting that\nneither Respondent nor the court of appeals ever engaged\nin that latter inquiry. And that's a critical inquiry.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How is it different it\nwould be strange to trust out the document -- the\ndoctrine as I -- as I understand it is what we relied on\nwhen we had the predecessor to this statute before.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: Justice Ginsburg I'm not\nurging that you get rid of overbreadth doctrine once and\nfor all -- probably be in the government's interest. I\nam simply saying that if you apply overbreadth analyses,\nthe way it supposed to be applied it's not satisfied\nhere. It's not just enough for you to envision a couple\nof hypotheticals. It has to be the overbreadth has to\nbe substantial relative to the legitimate sweep of the\nstatute. This Court in Virginia against Hicks said\nfaulted the lower court opinion because it had no\nanalyses whatsoever of valid versus invalid\napplications. The proportionality aspect of this courts\noverbreadth jurisprudence was ignored entirely. That\ncould be verbatim the holding of this case. The 11\ncircuit did engage in that relative analysis. When my\nbrother was asked for empirical evidence about the\ncomparison he said he didn't have any. With all due\nrespect, I think that's fatal to his case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How did that occur in --\nfree speech coalition.\nGENERAL CLEMENT: I think, in the way I\nwould explain that is I didn't think you get -- you\nfound there was such absolute overbreadth that you\ndidn't even reach the proportionality inquiry. In any\ninvent Hicks was decided afterwards, and I think Hicks\nmakes very clear that you have to have both absolute and\nrelative. I would say one last thing, though. This is\nfirst and foremost you start with the facts of this case\nand the facts of this case I think caution against\nreading the word presents out of the statute or reading\nit unduly narrowly.\nThe gravamen of the pandering here was not\njust the offer of pictures of this individual and his\ndaughter, but was his claim that I can post these actual\nimages of child pornography on this group site because\nI'm for real and I'm not an undercover agent. Now that\nseems to be within the epicenter of the statute but it's\nnot for profit. It was doing it to establish his bona\nfide. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you general\nthe case is submitted.\n(Whereupon, at 11:01 a.m., the case in the\nabove-entitled matter was submitted .)\nadolescent amazon.com 47:6 48:3 a.m
