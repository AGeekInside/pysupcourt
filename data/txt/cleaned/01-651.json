REID\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. REID: Mr. Chief Justice and may it please\nthe Court:\nThe alienage diversity statute provides that the\nFederal courts have original jurisdiction in civil actions\nbetween citizens of different States and citizens who are\nsubjects of a foreign State where the matter in\ncontroversy exceeds $75,000. The question presented today\nis whether respondent, Traffic Stream (BVI) Infrastructure\nLimited, a corporation incorporated under the laws of the\nBritish Virgin Islands, qualifies as a subject of the\nUnited Kingdom within the meaning of that statute.\nPetitioner, JPMorgan Chase Bank, submits it clearly does.\nIt is well-settled that the term, citizens and\nsubjects, applies to corporations and not just natural\npersons. It is also not controversial that a subject is\none who owes allegiance to and is under the protection of\na foreign State.\nQUESTION: Is this a question of Federal law?\nMS. REID: In terms of looking to the matter of\nthe subject?\nQUESTION: In determining who is a citizen or\nsubject of a foreign State, or whether a corporation in\nthis instance is a citizen or subject? Is that a Federal\nlaw question?\nMS. REID: Yes, Your Honor, we would submit it\nis in the first instance, but in saying that we must then\nlook at the nature of the relationship and look at the\nforeign State which is asserting the sovereignty, and\ncertainly that is a matter that we should consider\ncarefully. In this case, the United Kingdom has clearly\nexpressed its sovereignty over respondent and over the\nother residents and corporations of its overseas\nterritories.\nQUESTION: When you say the United Kingdom has\nexpressed its sovereignty, Ms. Reid, do you mean that\nyou're looking at their statutes, or that their diplomatic\nrepresentatives have made a representation?\nMS. REID: Both, both the fact that they have\nintervened as an amicus in this and in other cases, but\nalso, particularly in the case of respondent, if one looks\nat the BVI constitution enacted in 1976, it is enacted as\na result of the act of parliament and the order of\nparliament, and it reserves expressly all power to the\nCrown ultimately, and it is only from the Crown that the\nlaw is then delegated to the elected legislative council.\nEach member of whom must swear allegiance to the Crown and\nto the Queen.\nThe United Kingdom reserves the right to review,\napprove, and ultimately disapprove any statute that is\nenacted in the British Virgin Islands, which is a right\nthat they do exercise. In this case, therefore, the\nenabling or enacting statute which, under which respondent\nis incorporated, is a direct result of the authority\ngranted from the Crown, so I would argue it is not just a\nmatter of the diplomatic relationship and the fact that\nthe United Kingdom is the external face for the British\nVirgin Islands in terms of matters of defense and\ninternational relations, but also the fact that all law is\nderived ultimately from the Crown.\nQUESTION: Ms. Reid, every corporation must be\nformed under the law of some sovereign, and if that's\nright, a corporation just can't generate itself.\nIs there any corporation that is formed under\nthe law of some sovereign other than the United States not\nincluded within 1332, or is this just a very simple case\nwhere every foreign corporation of course is organized\nunder the law of some State, and therefore would qualify.\nDoes your case involve anything more than that?\nMS. REID: I would say, Your Honor, in 99\npercent of the cases, that you're right. I suppose it is\nconceivable that you would have corporations organized by\nsomeone who declares they are sovereign of some island\nsomewhere, but no one recognizes them as a sovereign, and\nthe United States would say, we know nothing of this\nperson, and know they can't be --\nQUESTION: Then the United States would also say\nthat that's not a corporation.\nMS. REID: Right, exactly.\nQUESTION: So I think you could say in 100\npercent of the cases if we acknowledge it as a\ncorporation, it will have been formed under the law of\nsome State.\nMS. REID: I would agree, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And I suppose even as to natural\npersons in this sort of eccentric island in the real\nworld, if we did not recognize their claim to individual\nsovereignty or nationality, in the real world I assume\nthey would be subject to some other national sovereign and\nthey'd by that virtue, by virtue of that be swept up under\nthe term, citizen or subject, wouldn't they?\nMS. REID: I would agree.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nQUESTION: Let's assume -- and I'm not sure that\nthis is an actual proposition of international law, that a\nsubject of a sovereign has a special duty to obey the laws\nof that sovereign. A United States citizen in China has a\nspecial obligation to obey the laws of the United States\nthat a British subject does not. Does this corporation\nhave a special obligation to obey the laws of Great\nBritain in any greater degree than it has the obligation\nto obey the laws of any other sovereign to whom it might\nbecome --\nMS. REID: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: -- subject?\nMS. REID: An analogy, though, not completely\nperfect, but it -- you know, JPMorgan Chase is a\ncorporation organized under the laws of the State of New\nYork. It obviously has to follow the laws of the State of\nNew York, but it also has obligations that it has to\nfollow under our Federal law.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMS. REID: Similarly, a corporation set up under\nthe laws of applicable overseas territories in the first\nin stance, of course, must follow the laws of their\nlegislative district, but they must also abide by agreed-\nupon laws and conventions of the United Kingdom, and that\nis specifically an issue in the Caribbean, where there are\ncertain financial disclosure, which is mandated in part\nthrough the relationship, constitutional relationship\nbetween the United Kingdom --\nQUESTION: Where can we document the proposition\nthat you've just stated? What do I look to?\nMS. REID: To a certain extent, the treaty,\nthat -- for example the Narcotics Enforcement Treaty.\nThere are also the United Kingdom -- the one I'm thinking\nof is their recent overruling on the homosexuality, which\nwe cited only to a newspaper article in our brief, will\ndemonstrate that.\nThe best sites are the web sites for the BVI and\nfor the United Kingdom, which detail the relationship\nbetween these two entities, also the white paper we cited\nto Your Honor written in, I believe, 1999, goes into great\ndetail about the relationships between the overseas\nterritories and the United Kingdom, what the authority and\nsovereignty the United Kingdom has --\nQUESTION: No more established authority like\nBlackstone, or --\nMS. REID: Not that we have cited to Your Honor,\nthough in many ways there are parliamentary debates that\nyou can access concerning -- which are referenced in the\nwhite papers -- concerning the relationships between the\noverseas territories and the Queen, which were quite\nreminiscent of the debates before the American Revolution\nin terms of virtual representation and --\nQUESTION: If we were dealing with a private\nindividual rather than a corporation, do you think there\ncould be a stateless person who wouldn't fit under this\nstatute?\nMS. REID: In very, very rare instances, and\nthose instances are where the individual had either\nrenounced their citizenship, which has on occasion\noccurred, or where they have been, you know, exiled, and\nhave not yet acquired citizenship somewhere else, and we\nwould submit that the cases cited by the Matimak Court\ndeal with those kinds of statelessness.\nQUESTION: Suppose that kind of person that\nJustice O'Connor and you just discussed, a true stateless\nperson, is temporarily in a port of Australia, San\nFrancisco, or Monterey, Mexico, can it be said\nconsistently with the statute here in question that they\nare at least temporarily subject to the laws of Australia\nwhile they are there, because they're stateless and they\nhave no other higher obligation, so they're then\nsubject --\nMS. REID: No. I would submit that what subject\nto you must mean is that you have an allegiance to a\nsovereign, and the sovereign in turn has an obligation to\nyou, including protection.\nQUESTION: It's not subject to. The phrase is\nsubject of, isn't it?\nMS. REID: Yes, of a --\nQUESTION: Everybody living in a country is\nsubject to the laws of that country, and presumably to the\nGovernment of that country, but they are not necessarily a\nsubject of that country.\nMS. REID: That is true, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: So there can be stateless persons who\nare not within the clause.\nMS. REID: Yes.\nQUESTION: And the reason you take that\nposition, I take it, is that the impetus for the\nconstitutional grant was in effect to keep countries from\ngetting mad, rather than for purposes of extending\njurisdiction as such to everyone who one might want to sue\nin a Federal court.\nMS. REID: Right. I mean, we have argued that\nthere were two impetuses. One is the prevention of\nforeign entanglements by providing a neutral Federal\nforum, and the other was the promotion of commerce.\nQUESTION: I must say, I didn't understand what\nyou mean by foreign entanglements. Are you talking about\nthe foreign entanglements that George Washington warned us\nagainst?\nMS. REID: The --\nQUESTION: I mean, like alliances with France,\nor things like that? What --\nMS. REID: No. The foreign entanglements, when\none looks back at the Framers' discussion, seem to\nenvision that if the British debt could not be collected\nwe might find ourselves back in another war.\nQUESTION: We don't want to make them mad.\nMS. REID: We didn't want to make them mad.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMS. REID: That, I think, was the entanglement\nthat they were worried about.\nQUESTION: It's a strange term for it, then.\nMS. REID: And just briefly on the issue of the\npromotion of commerce, I wanted to make the point that\nJPMorgan Chase Bank and the financial market, you know,\nconsidered the Matimak decisions as ones who have\npotentially very deleterious effects on international\ncommerce.\nQUESTION: Well, why? Aren't New York courts --\nthis is not a question of saying for our corporation you\ncan't enter U.S. court. They can enter a New York State\ncourt, and those courts are pretty savvy about commercial\nmatters, are they not?\nMS. REID: Absolutely, and I practice before\nthem frequently, but the perception on the part of\nforeign -- foreigners is that the Federal system is one in\nwhich procedures are uniform across the country, and a --\nwith predictability, perhaps, that is more a matter of\nperception than of reality.\nQUESTION: I know Alabamans who are afraid of\nNew York courts.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. REID: And vice versa.\nQUESTION: But it is a little different from\nwhat it was in the days of the post revolution, when the\nBritish creditor said State courts are simply going to let\nthem collect on their debts.\nMS. REID: That's true. In this particular\ncase, the reason in large part that it was decided to go\ninto Federal courts is simply because we wanted to get as\nspeed a resolution as possible, and the State court system\nhas interlocutory appeals, which is just the way the\nsystem works, and -- but it does often lead to additional\ndelay and we had noteholders who were insistent that we\ntry and get our collateral back as soon as possible.\nQUESTION: Anyway, you -- I think no one has\nsuggested a dynamic interpretation of 1332, so that if the\noriginal rationale is not as strong today as it was then,\nthat somehow the meaning of 1332 would change.\nMS. REID: No. I think it's -- the -- clearly\nthe United Kingdom at this point is, I guess one could say\nat best, annoyed by this continuing refusal to recognize\ntheir sovereignty over these types of entities, and the\nfact is that you know, they have submitted an amicus brief\nhere, several other amicus briefs, two diplomatic notes,\nso that the fear of the Framers of having an entanglement\nof some sort with an ally is still, I think, valid today.\nQUESTION: No other circuit has followed the\nSecond Circuit, have they?\nMS. REID: No. The Third Circuit has split\nexplicitly. The Fourth and the Seventh Circuit have also\ndisagreed, though not -- they didn't discuss Matimak, and\none of them was earlier than Matimak, but no, there is no\nother circuit that has followed this rule.\nIf the --\nQUESTION: You wish to reserve the rest of your\ntime?\nMS. REID: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Reid.\nMr. Minear, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY P. MINEAR\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. MINEAR: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThe United States submits that corporations\norganized under the United Kingdom overseas territories\nare citizens or subjects of a foreign State for purposes\nof alienage diversity jurisdiction. We reach that\nconclusion based on the plain language of 1332. Section\n1332's operative term, subject, describes a personal\nentity that is amenable to foreign authority in the sense\nthat it owes allegiance to that foreign State and is\nentitled to the protection of that foreign State. That\nterm quite clearly embraces a corporation created by a\nforeign State. This Court recognized that principle in\nSteamship Company v. Tugman 120 years ago.\nThe crucial issue in this case is whether the\nUnited Kingdom exercises sufficient sovereign authority\nover the British Virgin Islands such that citizens and\ncorporations can be said to be subject to the United\nKingdom's rules, and we think the answer to that is\nclearly yes. The United States expressly recognizes the\nUnited Kingdom's sovereignty over the British Virgin\nIslands. We do so through treaties such as the Consulate\nConvention that we have with the United Kingdom. We also\nrecognize it through our diplomatic relations with the\nUnited Kingdom. Now, we fully support the United\nKingdom's claim here of sovereignty over the British\nVirgin Islands.\nIn addition, if the Court needs to look further,\nand we think it does not, it's clear from the British\nVirgin Islands' constitution that the United Kingdom has\nretained its sovereignty over the British Virgin Islands.\nThat constitution expressly states that the United Kingdom\nreserves full power to exercise and pass laws for the good\ngovernment, order, and peace of the British Virgin\nIslands.\nWe think the language of section 1332\nconclusively resolves this case, but if the Court needs to\nlook further still, then we think the policies that\nunderlie section 1332 further buttress the conclusion that\nwe reach.\nQUESTION: Mr. Minear, what if the -- say, the\nU.K. takes one position and makes a representation, but\nthe State Department, our State Department disagrees.\nMR. MINEAR: The --\n(Slide.)\nQUESTION: Then what sort of an action should\nour courts take?\nMR. MINEAR: We think that you should defer on\nthe United States views on these matters. As far as\ndisagreements between the United Kingdom and the United\nStates, that's a matter for the State Department to deal\nwith, but this Court's own decisions, cases such as Jones\nv. The United States, which is at 137 U.S. 202, explicitly\nstate that questions of sovereignty are political\nquestions that are entrusted to the political branches.\nQUESTION: Well then, if you were to submit the\nviews of the State Department in a case like that, no\nmatter what else there is in the record, we should accept\nthe views of the State Department?\nMR. MINEAR: Your cases suggest that that is the\nresult that would follow.\nQUESTION: Yes, but do you have a position --\nMR. MINEAR: Yes, we do. To answer pointedly,\nyes, we do believe that you should defer to the United\nStates views, because oftentimes on the question -- let me\ndistinguish here that the question of subject is, of\ncourse, the meaning of that term is a legal question that\nthis Court would interpret according to its normal\npractices, but the question of whether a foreign entity is\na foreign State is a question that is properly entrusted\nto the political branches.\nWe believe that the Second Circuit's decision\nstands alone here because it is quite plainly wrong. The\nThird Circuit has expressly rejected it, and the Fourth\nCircuit and the Seventh Circuit have not followed it.\nUnder these circumstances, we think it is appropriate for\nthe Court to reverse the decision below and remand the\ncase for further proceedings.\nQUESTION: Can you comment on the stateless\nperson problem, not a legal person?\nMR. MINEAR: But an individual. Yes, we can\nconceive that there can be such a thing as a stateless\nperson, and we cannot believe that section 1332 by its\nplain language would reach a person who is not a citizen\nor a subject of a foreign State. Pure alienage is not\nsufficient. Nevertheless, the class of stateless persons\nis vanishingly small, and as was pointed out in the\nearlier discussion, the idea of a stateless corporation is\nan oxymoron, as Judge Altimari had stated.\nQUESTION: But there are some U.S. citizens who\ndon't have access to the Federal court because they're not\na citizen of any State. Let's take a U.S. citizen who is\nresiding in Switzerland.\nMR. MINEAR: That is correct. That is correct,\nand again, we think the courts have consistently answered\nthese questions by adherence to the plain language of the\njurisdictional provisions. For instance, for many years,\nuntil Congress dealt with the issue, citizens of the\nDistrict of Columbia were not entitled to ordinary\ndiversity jurisdiction, but these are matters that we\nthink are best resolved by looking closely at the language\nthat Congress has provided in the jurisdictional\nprovisions.\nIf there are no further questions, thank you.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Minear.\nMr. Albert, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CRAIG J. ALBERT\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. ALBERT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThere are two statutes at issue here, both of\nwhich have plain language. Section 1332 of title 28 says\nthat diversity jurisdiction extends only to citizens or\ncitizens and subjects, and it does not extend to all\naliens. The British Nationality Act of 1981 defines those\npersons whom the United Kingdom of Great Britain and\nNorthern Ireland views as its citizens or subjects, and\nnatural persons who are living within the British\nDependent Territories do not fall within the category of\nbeing British Citizens.\nThere is a special class, a subclass that is\ndelegated to those people. They are British Dependent\nTerritory citizens, or British Overseas Territories\ncitizens, and this is an important distinction, because\nthey do not have the full measure of rights that any\nEnglish citizen would have.\nQUESTION: You're now relying on English law, I\ntake it.\nMR. ALBERT: I'm referring to English law, yes.\nQUESTION: Yes. I think that creates some\ndifficulty for United States courts, particularly when the\nU.K. is making representations here as to one point, then\nyou tell us we have to read English law, which we're much\nless familiar with, of course, than American law.\nMR. ALBERT: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. Under Rule\n44.1 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a court can\nlook to any source for finding where --\nQUESTION: I realize that. It's not that we're\nsomehow disqualified from it, but it makes it a much more\ndifficult inquiry.\nMR. ALBERT: It would be a much more difficult\ninquiry had the United Kingdom actually cited to any\nstatute or any case ever decided in any English court\nanywhere on the subject, but it is --\nQUESTION: Well, Mr. Albert, even if the British\nNationality can be read as saying that corporations formed\nin the British Virgin Islands are not citizens, it doesn't\nsay they're not subjects of the United Kingdom, does it?\nMR. ALBERT: Well, actually, the British\nNationality Act carves out classes of citizens, and\nclasses of subjects, and persons who are neither citizens\nnor subjects, so in fact it --\nQUESTION: I just didn't find anything that\nindicated to me that a corporation formed in the British\nVirgin Island was not a subject of the U.K., and we are\ndealing here with a brief filed by the U.K. that says they\nare subjects, so what do we --\nMR. ALBERT: Well, I think that the question\nhere is whether the deference should be unyielding to a\nlitigation and advocacy position which the British\nGovernment puts forth in its briefs versus the substantive\nbasis for that position which one would find in a statute.\nQUESTION: Just looking at it from an American,\nU.S. perspective under the statute, citizens are subjects,\nand the fact that it is a corporation formed in the\nBritish Virgin Islands would lead me to conclude that is a\nsubject of a foreign nation under our own statute.\nMR. ALBERT: Respectfully, Justice O'Connor, I\nthink that the conclusion ought to be different, because\nthere is nothing with -- the first step in the inquiry is,\nwhat would 1332(a)(2) have to say about corporations, and\nwe know that 1332(a)(2) is a reference to citizens or\nsubjects which is consistently -- which before the Letson\nfiction was adopted had resulted in severe conflict over\nwhether there was jurisdiction for corporations at all.\nWhat this Court did in Letson was adopted the\nfiction not that the corporations were citizens or\nsubjects, but that the corporations would be deemed to be\ncitizens or subjects by virtue of the imputed citizenship\nof its shareholders and, applying the same principle here,\nyou would impute the citizenship of the -- the citizenship\nof natural persons resident within the British Virgin\nIslands to a British Virgin Islands --\nQUESTION: That's going back to a law that has\nlong since become obsolete. A corporation within the\nUnited States is a citizen of the State in which it's\nincorporated and where it has its principal place of\nbusiness. We don't look to the citizenship of the\nshareholders any more. Why should there be such a\ntremendous disparity between our modern view of what a\nU.S. corporation is and the rest of the world when we\ndon't even really think of the corporation as an entity in\nitself but say it's stuck by what its shareholder\ncitizenship is.\nMR. ALBERT: Respectfully, Justice Ginsburg,\n1332(c) does not say that corporations are citizens of\ntheir States. It says that for purposes of diversity they\nare deemed to be citizens of these States. It is a\ncounting rule, not a citizenship rule, and hence, the\nLetson fiction still obtains. All that Congress did when\nit adopted the 1332(c) language was to restrict the scope\nof diversity jurisdiction by providing a second political\njurisdiction, principal place of business, which would\nfurther limit the number of diversity cases which were\nappearing in Federal courts.\nThis Court has never held that corporations were\npolitical citizens or political subjects. Only 1332(c)\ndeems them to be so, and taking that a step further, it is\nCongress' choice, because Congress' language in 1332(a)(2)\nis that only citizens or subjects -- it does not use the\nword aliens or anything broader -- are subject to\ndiversity jurisdiction.\nQUESTION: Are you saying those words cover only\nhuman individuals and not corporations?\nMR. ALBERT: For 1332(a)(2), humans, then\napplying the 1332(c) presumption, that would bring\ncorporations within the scope of diversity jurisdiction.\nQUESTION: Well, 1332(a) does use the term,\naliens at the very end.\nMR. ALBERT: Yes, there is a reference to it,\nbut not in the provision of 1332(a)(2) on the extension of\nthat dispute between citizens of a State and citizens or\nsubjects of a foreign State, and in fact, Mr. Chief\nJustice, Congress in fact had used the word, aliens, the\nbroader word, in the original enactment, in the Judiciary\nAct of 1789, but Congress abandoned that language when it\nrevised the statute in 1875.\nQUESTION: Is a Spanish corporation -- as I\nsay -- is that -- does that come within 1332 jurisdiction,\na corporation formed in Scotland?\nMR. ALBERT: In Scotland, yes, because a --\nbecause the Scottish people, the English and Welsh people,\nand the people of Northern Ireland all are citizens of the\nMetropolitan United Kingdom, the United Kingdom of Great\nBritain and Northern Ireland.\nQUESTION: Well, my problem is if -- take\nsome -- the British Virgin Islands, a place that's still\nheld in something like colonial status, that you say that\nScotland, which has a great deal more independence,\nbelongs to the U.K. in the sense that it is a subject of\nthe U.K., but the British Virgin Islands, or the Cayman\nIslands, that have less independence, are not subjects?\nThat may be something a lawyer could understand, but I\ndon't think it makes much sense, does it?\nMR. ALBERT: I think that the distinction is, no\none is disputing here that the British Virgin Islands is\nsubordinate to the United Kingdom, no one is disputing\nthat its people ultimately are answerable to the authority\nof the United Kingdom, but that simply goes --\nQUESTION: Does it make them subject --\nsubjects?\nMR. ALBERT: Subject to, not subject of, and\nthat is why the British Nationality Act is so important\nhere.\nQUESTION: If it's so important, I guess then\nmaybe corporations incorporated in Scotland are not\ncitizens and subjects either, because it doesn't say\nanything about corporations, does it?\nMR. ALBERT: No, Justice Breyer.\nQUESTION: Wouldn't people then be surprised if\nit doesn't say anything, if we said that Scottish\ncorporations weren't citizens, or -- in fact, wouldn't the\npeople who live in these islands be a little surprised if\nthe Supreme Court were to say, you're not nationals? How\ndoes it work? This is not an act that refers to\ncorporations.\nMR. ALBERT: The proper allegation in a case\nlike this would be that a corporation is incorporated\nunder the laws of Scotland and is therefore a citizen or a\nsubject of the United Kingdom.\nQUESTION: And the reason that they are but\nthese people aren't is?\nMR. ALBERT: Is because England, Wales,\nScotland, and Northern Ireland, along with the Channel\nIslands, are the constituent parts of the Metropolitan\nUnited Kingdom. That is the Government with whom we\nmaintain a direct relationship, and when we treaty with\nthem, we -- our treaties are binding as to that nation and\nthose persons who are within those political subdivisions.\nQUESTION: As of English law, the reason that --\nalthough their law says, I guess, the counselor law, the\ndiplomatic manual,the thing that says you have to swear\nallegiance if you're in the British foreign -- you know,\nyou're in the British Virgin Islands, all the laws are\nsubject to British authority and so forth, so the reason,\nin your opinion, despite all those things they list in\ntheir brief, that makes it very, very similar, the reason\nthat a corporation incorporated in Wales is a citizen of\nthe United Kingdom or subject of the United Kingdom but\nthese are not, because it's the British Virgin Islands,\nis?\nMR. ALBERT: Because when parliament enacts a\nlaw of general applicability within the United Kingdom,\nits applicability is to those four jurisdictions that I've\nmentioned, England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland,\nalong with in some instances the Channel Islands, but it\ndoes not, of its force, extend to the British Overseas\nTerritories, the British dependent -- what's now known as\nthe British Overseas Territories. They are regulated\nseparately.\nWhen we enter into a treaty with the United\nKingdom on any subject whatsoever, unless our treaty\nspecifically extends to those territories, what happens in\nthose territories is unaffected by our treaty, so it is\nnot a two-way street of reciprocal obligations within the\nUnited Kingdom. All of their powers of these\njurisdictions are derived from the United Kingdom, but\nthey don't have any reciprocal rights, and that is\nespecially true of the natural people who live within\nthese territories.\nThe natural people who live within these\nterritories have no right of abode within the -- have no\nright of abode within the Metropolitan United Kingdom. If\nyou call them citizens or subjects, and in fact the United\nKingdom uses both terms now, it no longer adheres to the\nold concept of subjects, they cannot travel to the United\nKingdom --\nQUESTION: Are they stateless people?\nMR. ALBERT: They are not stateless people at\nall. They do have a State. Their State, their\noverarching State is the United Kingdom, which extends to\nthem defense protection. The United Kingdom protects them\nin an international sense, but they do have -- and in that\nsense they a State.\nQUESTION: They are British -- their State is\nthe U.K.?\nMR. ALBERT: They are just -- they are very\nsimilar to what our territorial residents would have been\nbefore we extended citizenship.\nQUESTION: They are subject of and to the United\nStates, I assume, the residents in the U.S. Territories.\nMR. ALBERT: Residents of U.S. Territories are\nnow citizens by virtue of an amendment to the Immigration\nand --\nQUESTION: What were they before they were\ncitizens?\nMR. ALBERT: They were nationals and natives.\nThey had no status. They were very much --\nQUESTION: They were not stateless, were they?\nMR. ALBERT: No, they were not.\nQUESTION: And so why isn't a corporation\norganized in the British Virgin Islands or the Cayman\nIslands -- why is that stateless? There's only one State\nit can belong to, because these are not independent\nsovereigns. The BVI is not an independent sovereign.\nWhat State does that -- you tell me that the individual\nwould belong to the U.K. What does a corporation belong\nto?\nMR. ALBERT: I do not advocate the position that\nthe Matimak -- the Matimak Court adopted that these\ncorporations were stateless. I do not think that that is\nessential to the determination below, and I think that it\nwas a poor choice of words. There is a State involved.\nThe United Kingdom granted to the British Virgin Islands\nthe authority to adopt a Companies Act, just as United\nStates territories have authority under statute of\nCongress to adopt their own incorporation laws. That does\nnot mean that the corporations that are incorporated\nwithin the British Virgin Islands are subjects of, rather\nthan subject to --\nQUESTION: They belong to some State, and either\nthey belong to the U.K., or they belong to something that\nisn't a sovereign, or they're stateless. It's got to be\none of those three, so which is it?\nMR. ALBERT: They belong to the United Kingdom,\nbut that does not answer the statutory question at issue\nhere, because even if they belong to a kingdom, even if\nthey belong to the United Kingdom, that does not make the\ncitizens or subjects of the kingdom. You can be an alien\nand subject -- an alien to the United States, subject to\nthe kingdom, yet not be a citizen or subject of the United\nKingdom, and that was Congress' choice to make.\nCongress --\nQUESTION: Could I ask, the word subject in the\nstatute just tracks the word subject in the Constitution,\nand I -- wasn't the status of the colonists before our\nRevolution precisely the same as the status of the British\nVirgin Islands?\nMR. ALBERT: Justice Scalia --\nQUESTION: Which would lead me to the inquiry\nwhether the -- even the revolutionaries considered\nthemselves subjects of the British Crown. If they\nweren't, I guess they weren't engaging in a revolution\nreally, were they?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. ALBERT: The laughter from the audience in\nfact focuses the point here, because that was the\nfundamental shift in the understanding of the colonists\nand their relationship to the British Government. Before\nthe Revolution, the old idea of subjectship was that it\nwas permanent. One could never abandon one's subjectship.\nThe political idea during the Revolution was a shift\ntoward the idea of volitional allegiance.\nThat is, that once the Crown abdicated parts of\nits protective authority, then the people no longer were\nsubjects of the Crown, and the legal basis for the legal\nphilosophers during the formation -- in the 1774 to 1776\nperiod was to justify how it was that we could throw off\nour bonds to the British Crown, and the way in which they\njustified it was to say that the King had abdicated, and\ntherefore, in the words of the Declaration of\nIndependence, we were no longer his subjects. What were\nwe? Well, there was a --\nQUESTION: But we had been. We had been.\nMR. ALBERT: Oh, we had been. We had been.\nQUESTION: We occupied the same status in those\ndays as the British --\nQUESTION: Why wasn't that status the one that's\ncomparable to the status of citizens in the Virgin Islands\nhere --\nMR. ALBERT: Justice --\nQUESTION: -- because they're not claiming that\nthey've been abandoned by the Crown here.\nMR. ALBERT: Justice Stevens, there are two\nplaces in which that abandonment can come about. One is\nby the people themselves declaring themselves independent,\nthey saying that those bonds have been thrown off.\nQUESTION: Of course, that hasn't happened here.\nMR. ALBERT: It certainly has not happened here,\nbut there is another way, because when nations adopt the\nidea of volitional allegiance, the new idea of what a\nsubject is, then the nation itself can change its laws to\ndetermine what the status of its people are. Here, the\nUnited Kingdom has changed the status of its persons. The\nUnited Kingdom has moved away from that 18th and 16th,\n17th century view of what a subject is and moved to our\nview of what a subject is, and the British Nationality Act\nexplains exactly what these people are.\nQUESTION: The British Nationality Act has\nnothing to do with corporations.\nMR. ALBERT: But the British Nationality Act\ndoes have to do with what the people in the British Virgin\nIslands are --\nQUESTION: And the other thing they --\nMR. ALBERT: -- and then applies --\nQUESTION: I understand your point there, but --\nso I'm cutting you off, but they say that in these places\nthe Queen appoints the Governor, the Governor is\nresponsible for internal security, public service, and\ncourt administration, but all the laws they pass in these\nplaces are subject to review by the Foreign Office, the\nCommonwealth Office, and then the Queen in Council, which\nis a group of particular individuals, that the Legislative\nCouncil swears its allegiance to the Crown before it takes\nplace, and so they haven't just discarded this place at\nall. They've sort of treated it as we might treat a city\ninside a State, or some other kind of semi-independent\nentity, and you say to that, what?\nMR. ALBERT: Or more particularly, as we would\ntreat one of our territories, because the ability of\nCongress to legislate for its --\nQUESTION: You mean, people in our Territories\nlike Puerto Rico, let's say, which is a Commonwealth --\nMR. ALBERT: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- or Samoa, they are not subjects of\nthe United States?\nMR. ALBERT: They are not subjects of the United\nStates.\nQUESTION: They don't owe their allegiance to\nthe United States, and they're not subject to its laws.\nWhich is it?\nMR. ALBERT: The position that has been\nadvocated here, and I think that the -- and that has been\nuniformly advanced by the scholars is that citizenship\nversus subjectship is simply -- are simply two sides of\nthe same coin determin -- describing what the relationship\nis of one in either a democracy or a monarchy, and what\nhas happened in the United Kingdom is that as the country\nhas evolved from a strict monarchy to a constitutional\nmonarchy with democratic principles, that the ideas of\nsubjectship have evolved, and the idea of citizenship has\nbeen incorporated into their law. This --\nQUESTION: Do you feel some discomfort in\nsaying, well, that's what the U.K. law is, and you told us\nthat what the Companies Act means, when U.K. itself is\ntelling this Court, you've got it all wrong? You're\nstanding before the Court as an interpreter of U.K. law.\nYou're riding the whole -- your whole case on what U.K.\nlaw is, and yet the U.K. tells us, you read it wrong.\nMR. ALBERT: I would have thought that had the\nUnited Kingdom had a statute on which it could rely, or\nany decision on which it could rely, it would cite them.\nThe only authority to which it cites in the record at all\nis in the lodging --\nQUESTION: Which -- go ahead.\nMR. ALBERT: Is in the lodging at page L31, an\nexcerpt from its diplomatic manual which describes the\nvarious categories under the British Nationality Act.\nThe other authority upon which it relies are its\ndiplomatic notes in which it asserts that it views these\npeople as its subjects, but if you look to each citation\nof that -- those diplomatic notes, they come not in a\nsubmission to a court, asking a court to determine what\nBritish law is, but in a protest to the State Department\nafter a case has been decided saying, we don't like the\ndecision of this court.\nNow, I've cited to the -- I've certainly cited\nto the text of the British Nationality Act which tells you\nwhere the diplomatic -- where the diplomatic manual\nderives its basis.\nQUESTION: Is it a fair summary to say that it's\na litigating position and therefore we do not owe it\nChevron deference?\nMR. ALBERT: I think it is a pure advocacy\nposition, and it does not deserve --\nQUESTION: Are you arguing for what we might\ncall a variable definition of subject, that VI residents\nare subjects of Great Britain in some cases and not\nothers?\nThat is to say, you said earlier that the U.K.\ncould make a treaty binding on VI residents, VI citizens,\nso that you can be subject of Great Britain in some\ninstances and not others.\nMR. ALBERT: Justice Kennedy, the U.K. itself --\nQUESTION: If I characterize your argument that\nway, would that be a proper characterization of your\nargument?\nMR. ALBERT: I think that at the second level of\nMatimak inquiry, when -- that the Court would necessarily\nhave to inquire as to whether or not a person is or is not\na subject, and I think that I would be -- I am willing to\nconcede that Britain could change its statute for general\npurposes or for limited purposes so as to give to these\nterritorial citizens the right to proceed in American\ncourts, and we would defer to that simply by reason of --\nsimply for reasons for international comity.\nQUESTION: But doesn't that potential indicate\nthat there is sovereignty, because --\nMR. ALBERT: Once --\nQUESTION: -- isn't sovereignty the capacity to\nexercise power and authority?\nMR. ALBERT: Sovereignty is that power. The\nquestion is whether or not they are subjects.\nI'll give you an example.\nQUESTION: They are subjects because of the\npotential of the exercise of that power.\nMR. ALBERT: The land that sits in the middle of\nLondon at Leicester Square, the famous Tolk v. Moxie Land,\nis subject to the sovereignty of the United Kingdom, but\nthat does not make the land a subject, and so the mere\nfact that the United Kingdom adopts legislation which\nregulates behavior of its people, both within the\nmetropolitan United Kingdom and within its territories,\ndoes not mean that the people within its territories are\nsubjects for purposes of 1332, and I say that especially\nin light of the fact that as we stand here today the\nUnited Kingdom has adopted a new statute which has not yet\ncome into force, because a statutory instrument has not\nyet been signed for it, which will render the British\nTerritories' citizens to be British citizens, giving those\nBritish citizens now the right of abode within the United\nKingdom, and that will happen in the future. It probably\nwill happen soon, maybe in a matter of months, maybe in a\nmatter of years, but it has not happened yet, and we\ndetermine subject matter jurisdiction as of the time of\nthe commencement of --\nQUESTION: How does that affect a corporation?\nYou're talking about what will be the status of\nindividuals.\nMR. ALBERT: I think that a -- that applying --\nthat the proper way to apply the Letson principle here is\nthat a British Virgin Islands Corporation should never be\nsubject to diversity jurisdiction precisely because the\npresumption is that its shareholders have opted for\nBritish Virgin Islands status rather than opted for\nBritish status.\nQUESTION: And that would be the case -- it\nwould be -- the Congress would be immobile as well. In\norder to make -- if I follow your argument correctly, in\norder to make a BVI corporation subject to 1332\njurisdiction, there would have to be a constitutional\namendment, because the Constitution uses the same words\nfor a citizen or subject -- citizen or subject.\nMR. ALBERT: The Second Circuit did not reach\nthe constitutional --\nQUESTION: That's what I'm putting to you,\nbecause the statute uses the same term, citizens or\nsubjects.\nMR. ALBERT: I do not think that there is a\npresumption in this Court that the use of the same\nlanguage in Article 3 and in title 28 means that the\nstatute has --\nQUESTION: Well, tell me what subject means\nwithin Article 3 that it doesn't mean within 1332 and why\na court should interpret it -- interpret them differently.\nMR. ALBERT: Because if you look to the\nJudiciary Act of 1789, which was adopted nearly\ncontemporaneously, Congress used the broader language,\nalien, rather than the narrower language, citizen or\nsubject, and --\nQUESTION: That's not -- the Constitution says\ncitizen or subject, doesn't it?\nMR. ALBERT: That's correct, it does, and --\nQUESTION: What does it mean -- what does\nsubject mean within the Constitution, within Article 3, as\nit reads?\nMR. ALBERT: It would be mere speculation on my\npart to suggest what it was that they meant, since this\nwas one of the least debated provisions of the\nConstitution.\nQUESTION: But you're urging a certain statutory\ninterpretation, and you said, well, maybe it has a\ndifferent meaning, the word subject, in the Constitution,\nso I'm asking you to tell me what could be those different\nmeanings.\nMR. ALBERT: I think that it is entirely\npossible that in 1787 Congress -- the Convention intended\nto extend the grant of authority to the full measure of\ndiversity jurisdiction over cases involving all\nforeigners, but the reason that I don't think that they\nfocused on the issue was because in 1787 there really were\nnot these cases of -- there were not a lot of cases,\nprobably no cases in which there were people who lacked\nsubjectship yet nevertheless were foreigners.\nWith respect to these trading colonies in\nparticular, the people who were involved in the mercantile\ntrade involving these Caribbean colonies were not people\nwho were resident within those colonies --\nQUESTION: What about Canadians? Until Canada\ndomesticated its constitution, I suppose for most of the\n19th Century Canadians were not subjects of the Crown?\nMR. ALBERT: I think Canadians were subjects of\nthe Crown by virtue of the fact that they were in a\nsettler colony rather than in a plantation, a plantation\ncolony, and the -- one of the difficulties of the British\nlaw of that entire era is that it never really had a\nuni -- it never had a uniform picture of who its persons\nwere, and what the relationship was between the Crown and\neach one of the different types of colonies that were\ncreated, and it was very, very difficult for the -- it was\nvery difficult for Britain, because Britain had different\ntypes of colonies which promoted different types of\nBritish interests, and therefore it created different\ntypes of Governments within them, and created different\nstatuses with respect to immigration and migration to\nEurope for those people.\nQUESTION: So among the subjects, or -- well,\nthe entities that are under U.K. sovereignty, which are\nthose are subjects and which of them are not?\nMR. ALBERT: The ones which are certainly not\nsubjects right now are those which are the British\nOverseas Territories, which include the British Virgin\nIslands, the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, the Turks and\nCaicos --\nQUESTION: Which ones are? Which ones are?\nMR. ALBERT: Pardon?\nQUESTION: Which ones are?\nMR. ALBERT: The Isle of Man, the Channel\nIslands are British -- are British citizens, and --\nQUESTION: I didn't ask citizen, I said,\nsubjects.\nMR. ALBERT: Oh, British subjects, sorry.\nBritish subjects, and --\nQUESTION: How about the Falklands?\nMR. ALBERT: The Falklands -- the Falklands,\nthose residents are not British citizens. They are\nBritish Overseas -- Overseas Territories citizens.\nQUESTION: How about Leicester Square?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. ALBERT: It has no status whatsoever,\nbecause it is property, not a person.\nThank you.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Albert.\nMs. Reid, you have 6 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SARAH L. REID\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. REID: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthis Court:\nI will try to be brief. I would like to\nseparate the inquiry between corporations and then address\nnatural persons. Corporations are incorporated through\nthe laws of their legislative district. The United\nKingdom's brief details quite clearly how the corporations\nare incorporated, rather like our States, corporations in\nNorthern Ireland are incorporated under the laws of\nNorthern Ireland. As I understand respondent's argument,\nthat would make them stateless entities, because they are\nnot actually incorporated in Scotland, Wales, or the\nUnited Kingdom. Clearly, that is an absurd result, given\nthe presence of the British --\nQUESTION: I think his answer was that if\nthey're formed under Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland,\nthey're okay, but if they're formed under BVI, they're\nnot.\nMS. REID: Right. I think he may have\ninadvertently been in error, because the Northern Ireland\ncorporations are actually incorporated under a different\nlaw than those of the ones in England, but the point is\nthe same. All of these entities incorporate under their\nown individual quasi State or district law, all subject to\nthe Crown, and they all should be analyzed in the\nidentical way. They are all subject to and subjects of\nthe United Kingdom.\nIn terms of the natural citizens, I just wanted\nto point -- the British Nationality Act, of course, has no\napplications to corporations, and the analysis that\nsomehow we should adopt the old Letson rule is\ninapplicable both because it's United Kingdom law, we have\nno learning -- I mean, United States law, no learning on\nwhat -- how the United Kingdom would do it, but it seems\nsensible to adopt the more modern view, but the 1981\nNationality Act, interestingly, in schedule 5 to section\n41, in terms of naturalization and becoming a citizen or a\nBritish Overseas Citizen, or a British, what was then\nknown as Dependent Territory citizen, you're required to\ntake the following oath of allegiance: I, name, swear by\nAlmighty God that on becoming a British Dependent\nTerritory citizen I will be faithful and bear true\nallegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, her heirs\nand successors, according to law.\nI submit to you that that is the definition of a\nsubject, and of allegiance, and that really is --\ndemonstrates that the United Kingdom has come before this\nCourt not as a litigation posture, because it has no\ninterest really in any of these cases, but as a concern\nover the fact that its sovereignty is not being recognized\nby the judiciary when it has been recognized by the United\nStates Government in numerous treaties, and again, I won't\nread them, but I would simply refer you to the Consular\nConvention and footnote 17 of the United Kingdom's brief,\nwhich details the numerous treaties that have been entered\ninto governing the British Virgin Islands and other of the\nOverseas Territories.\nIf the Court has no further questions, I will\nsubmit.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Ms. Reid.\n"
