McCORTNEY\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. McCORTNEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe issue in this case is whether the award of\nback pay to an undocumented alien who never was legally\npresent or legally authorized to work in this country\nconflicts with this Court's holding in Sure-Tan or with\nthis country's immigration laws and policies.\nIn Sure-Tan, this Court held that the\ndiscriminatees in that case must be deemed unavailable for\nwork and the accrual of back pay therefore tolled during\nany period when they were not lawfully entitled to be\npresent and employed in the United States.\nThe Sure-Tan Court's back pay limitation is\nconsistent with INA's dual requirement that to be employed\nin this country an alien must be both legally present and\nlegally authorized to work. Despite this dual\nrequirement, the board contends that Castro is entitled to\nback pay even though he never was legally present or\nlegally authorized to work during the back pay period.\nThe fatal flaw in the board's position lies in\nits adherence to its physical availability doctrine. The\nboard contends that this Court denied back pay to the\ndiscriminatees in Sure-Tan only because they had left the\ncountry and were physically unavailable for work. If the\nboard is right, the Sure-Tan discriminatees could have\nillegally reentered the country to establish physical\npresence and to commence the accrual of back pay.\nHowever, such reentry would violate the immigration laws\nof this country and be contrary to this Court's holding in\nSure-Tan.\nQUESTION: Have the immigration laws changed at\nall in any relevant respects since our decision in Sure-\nTan?\nMR. McCORTNEY: Yes, Your Honor, the passage of\nIRCA in 1986.\nQUESTION: And what relevant changes did IRCA\nmake?\nMR. McCORTNEY: IRCA was an amendment to the INA\nthat made the employment, the knowing employment of\nundocumented aliens unauthorized from the employer's\nperspective.\nQUESTION: And is it correct that when Sure-Tan\nwas argued, IRCA, if that's the way you pronounce it, was\nbeing considered by Congress and the Government in its\nargument told us that if IRCA had been passed, back pay\nwould not be available?\nMR. McCORTNEY: That's correct, Your Honor.\nRecognizing, as it must, that this Court in\nSure-Tan conditioned the accrual of back pay on legal\npresence, the board contends that the Sure-Tan Court\nsought only to deter the discriminatees from illegally\nreentering this country to claim back pay.\nQUESTION: Well, when you say conditioned it on\nlegal presence, I mean, in fact they were not present. I\nmean, the people in that case were still out of the\ncountry, weren't they?\nMR. McCORTNEY: That's correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: So you have to acknowledge that it\nwas dictum.\nMR. McCORTNEY: Well, Your Honor, I would not\ncall it dicta only because the Court set forth the\nconditions upon which the discriminatees might receive\nback pay if they were to legally reenter the country.\nQUESTION: That's right, but it only had to say\none condition in order to decide the case. Namely, you\nhad to be in the country, and it went on to say, and in\naddition you have to be available to work, but that is\nreally unnecessary to the decision.\nMR. McCORTNEY: Well, the threshold condition\nwas legal reentry, and that was the starting point of the\nanalysis. If they were to reenter, then of course they\nwould have to establish at the back pay hearing --\nQUESTION: Mr. McCortney --\nMR. McCORTNEY: -- legal authorization to work.\nQUESTION: If that is so, then why did the Court\nmake the comment on page 901 of the opinion in\nfootnote 11, talking about the board has said it will make\nit an arbitrary number of weeks, and the Court said the\nboard has never attempted to impose a back pay award that\nthe employer must pay regardless of the actual evidence as\nto such issues as the employee's availability to work?\nAll of that would have been unnecessary if it were just\nthis blanket rule, right?\nMR. McCORTNEY: Well, Your Honor, I think in\nfootnote 11 what the Court was addressing was the minimum\nback pay award of 6 months that the court of appeals had\nimposed and the board had adopted, and then the board\ntried to defend that award by arguing that it had in other\ncases had estimates of back pay, despite the fact that the\ndiscriminatee was unable to establish with any certainty\nthe probable length of the back pay period.\nI think the Court there was simply saying that,\nlook, you don't even go so far as to provide any showing\nof proof as to how long these discriminatees would have\nworked before their apprehension by the INS, but we don't\nread that to mean that had those discriminatees in Sure-\nTan remained in the country, that they would have been\nentitled to back pay, because they wouldn't have been\nlegally present and legally authorized to work.\nQUESTION: Well, if the opinion in Sure-Tan we\nthink equivocal, if it's a wash either way, what is your\nprincipal argument for reversal here?\nMR. McCORTNEY: Assuming that Sure-Tan is\nequivocal?\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. McCORTNEY: That the board's award of back\npay conflicts with the immigration laws and policies of\nthis country as embodied in the INA and IRCA.\nQUESTION: Well, what do you say the argument\nthat the board makes that even if the dictum in Sure-Tan\nwere a holding as you say it should be treated, that the\nstatute has changed the landscape, and that the board's\nrule in effect is in aid of the statute, because the board\nis saying the illegality on the part of the employer comes\nwhen the employer knowingly employs these people despite\nknowledge of their illegal character, so in effect we're\ngoing to say that the obligation to pay back pay stops\nwhen the employer knows that the alien in fact is\nillegally there.\nUp to that point, however, we're going to follow\na different policy. We're going to make the employer pay\nback pay because otherwise we would make it very easy for\nemployers. We would, in fact, create an inducement for\nemployers to ignore the law by, in effect, winking at\nillegality on the part of the workers, so the board is\nsaying, sure, the statute changed the legal landscape even\non your reading of Sure-Tan, and we've come up with what\nseems to be a sensible way of implementing it. What is\nyour response to that?\nMR. McCORTNEY: Your Honor, just the mere\nprospect of receiving back pay in this case encouraged\nCastro to extend his illegal stay by more than 4 years and\nto continue using --\nQUESTION: Well, I think you're right, but the\nboard is saying, yes, there's that inducement on one side,\nbut there's a very powerful employer inducement if we come\nout the other way, and although I don't think the board\nput it in these words, I take it the board is saying, we\nthink the employers are going to make a rational decision\nabout inducements more clearly or more obviously than\nemployees, the illegal aliens might do, so we're going to\nprefer the inducement or the policy that is going to have\nthe strongest effect on the employers. Isn't that a\npermissible choice for the board to make?\nMR. McCORTNEY: No, Your Honor. The board's\nauthority here is to enforce the provisions of the\nNational Labor Relations Act to the extent that they do\nnot conflict with the immigration laws and policies of\nthis country, and --\nQUESTION: But the board is saying we can't have\nit both ways. No matter which way we go, something we do\nwould provide an inducement to violate the immigration\nlaws. We think probably the best way to get where we want\nto go is to concentrate on inducements on the employer.\nMR. McCORTNEY: Your Honor, I don't believe that\nthose, the deterrence of the employer to -- that knowingly\nhires illegal aliens or employs them, that awarding back\npay is necessary in light of the sanctions under IRCA that\nnow subject employers that do so to civil and criminal\nsanctions, and so --\nQUESTION: Wouldn't it also be the case that if\nthe employer, by reason of this inducement, hired --\nsupposed inducement -- hired somebody whom he knew at the\ntime of the hiring to be an unlawful, an illegal alien,\neven applying the board's rule, he wouldn't have to pay\nany back pay.\nMR. McCORTNEY: That's correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: What is -- here -- I think Justice\nSouter is -- we said in our cases just what Justice Souter\nsaid, I take it, INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, quoting what Sure-\nTan says. An employer can be guilty of an unfair labor\npractice in his dealings with an alien, notwithstanding\nthe alien's illegal presence in this country. You agree\nwith that. Retrospective sanctions against the employer\nmay accordingly be imposed by the board to further the\npublic policy against unfair labor practices.\nNow, those -- that's what the Court said. Now,\nthis is a retrospective policy, a retrospective sanction\nof a compromise variety only for the period where the\nemployer is not committing any labor law, any immigration\nlaw violation in order to further the labor policy. Why\ndoesn't this fit within the two sentences that I just\ndescribed?\nMR. McCORTNEY: Because --\nQUESTION: And if this doesn't, what would?\nMR. McCORTNEY: Your Honor, what it doesn't\naddress is the violation of the INA.\nQUESTION: I'm sorry. What the Court said in\nthe sentences I read is, retrospective -- I take it,\nretrospective sanctions can be assessed by the board.\nNow, are we -- now, I want to know, if they\ncan't do this, what can they do retrospectively, or is the\nsentence I just read you by this Court wrong?\nMR. McCORTNEY: Your Honor, I think what the\nsentence means, at least my reading of it, is that\nretrospective sanctions may be imposed, but not\nnecessarily, and --\nQUESTION: Fine.\nQUESTION: What other rules are there, is\nwhat -- what other retrospective sanctions are there?\nQUESTION: Yes. Yes, that's correct. Thank\nyou.\nQUESTION: Can the board fine the employer?\nMR. McCORTNEY: No, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: What else can the board do to punish\nthe employer for the unfair labor practice?\nMR. McCORTNEY: A cease and desist order, as in\nthis case, with the threat of contempt sanctions.\nQUESTION: That's a prospective --\nQUESTION: I would have called that prospective.\nQUESTION: -- sanction, isn't it?\nMR. McCORTNEY: Yes.\nQUESTION: So you really don't have any\nexplanation for that language.\nMR. McCORTNEY: All I would say, Your Honor, is\nthat --\nQUESTION: Which is, I suppose your explanation\nis that that's as much dictum as your opponent says Sure-\nTan was.\nMR. McCORTNEY: That's correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: So it's a wash, right?\nQUESTION: Well, if that's the explanation, I\ntake it that Sure-Tan was dealing with a case where the\nemployer did know in respect to the sanction that the\nemployee, the alien, was illegal, so Sure-Tan did not\nconsider the kind of sanction here at issue, which is a\nsanction that applies only to the period where the\nemployer did not know that the employee was an illegal,\nhence the employer was not violating the immigration law.\nMR. McCORTNEY: It still doesn't address, Your\nHonor, the fact that the illegal presence and the use of\nfraudulent documents and working without authorization is\na violation of the INA.\nQUESTION: Is it unlawful? That's the question\nI was going to ask you. Is -- under the immigration laws,\nis it only the employer who is violating the law when he\nhires, with knowledge, an illegal alien, or is it also the\ncase that an illegal alien who deceives an employer by\nproviding a false green card and who then draws pay when\nhe's illegally in the country, is that unlawful?\nMR. McCORTNEY: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Now, I know --\nQUESTION: I thought --\nQUESTION: -- the use of the green card is, but\nis the working and getting pay unlawful under the\nimmigration laws?\nMR. McCORTNEY: Yes, it is.\nQUESTION: I thought IRCA itself enacted a\nprovision making it illegal for aliens to provide false\ndocumentation to get employment. That wasn't in the law\nwhen Sure-Tan was decided, was it?\nMR. McCORTNEY: Yes, it was, Your Honor. In\nfact, let me just explain that 18 U.S.C. 1546 was already\non the books, that prohibited the use of fraudulent\ndocuments for immigration purposes, and when IRCA came\nalong it amended the INA but added 1324(c), which also\nprohibits the use of fraudulent documents to obtain\nemployment, so at the time that Sure-Tan was decided, you\nhad the following laws in this case that were violated by\nMr. Castro, regardless of IRCA: entering a country\nillegally in violation of 8 U.S.C. 1325, failing to\nregister as an alien within 30 days of his entry, a\nviolation of 8 U.S.C. 1302, using fraudulent documents to\nobtain employment, a violation of 18 U.S.C. 1546,\nremaining in this country illegally and working without\nauthorization, a violation of 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(5), which\nwas formerly 8 U.S.C. 11 --\nQUESTION: Now, did IRCA add provisions and\nimpose obligations on prospective employers to require\nthem to review the documents and make sure that they\nappear to be regular on their face?\nMR. McCORTNEY: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And that was a new provision?\nMR. McCORTNEY: That was a new provision.\nQUESTION: And is there any allegation in this\ncase that the employer failed to comply with that?\nMR. McCORTNEY: No, Your Honor. It's\nundisputed.\nQUESTION: It's --\nQUESTION: May I ask if your position would\napply if this were a violation of the Fair Labor Standards\nAct instead of the labor act? If the employer had\nunderpaid the employee, would he have a right to back pay?\nMR. McCORTNEY: Your Honor, I -- in the amicus\nbrief of the States they seem to equate back pay under the\nNLRA with back pay under the FLSA when they're two\ndifferent things. Back pay --\nQUESTION: I understand they're two different --\nI just want to know what your position is on that.\nMR. McCORTNEY: No, we would not advocate at\nall, and we have not, taking wages away from undocumented\naliens that have been earned for work already performed.\nQUESTION: Even though they -- it was a crime to\ndo any work? Why -- if you're sticking with your theory\nthat everything that this person did on that job, from\npresenting the false documentation on, was unlawful, so\nwhy should he be paid anything for unlawful activity?\nYou're making a distinction between the Fair Labor\nStandards Act and the NLRA, but your theory, I think,\nwould cover both.\nMR. McCORTNEY: Well, Your Honor, we give\ncertain rights and benefits to undocumented aliens that\nare already in this country, and we do that to level the\nplaying field between undocumented aliens and American\nworkers so that unscrupulous employers won't prefer\nundocumented aliens over American workers.\nQUESTION: Well, furthermore, just from the\nstandpoint of equity, I suppose the employer has\nbenefitted from the services in the case that Justice\nGinsburg puts, and there's --\nMR. McCORTNEY: Absolutely.\nQUESTION: -- no benefit here save, arguably,\nfrom the illegal labor practice, but there's no benefit\nfor work received.\nMR. McCORTNEY: That's absolutely correct, Your\nHonor. In fact --\nQUESTION: Would you clarify one thing for me?\nMR. McCORTNEY: Sure.\nQUESTION: Do I understand that if the employer\nand the employee both know of the illegality, that then\nthere's no back pay?\nMR. McCORTNEY: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: It seems to me that's absolutely\nupside down.\nMR. McCORTNEY: Well, Your Honor --\nQUESTION: The -- and of course, you don't --\nthis is the Government's position, you don't have to\ndefend it, but in other words, as I understand the\nGovernment's -- once the employer knows that there's a\nviolation and continues it, he's no longer liable for back\npay. That's a strange calculus.\nMR. McCORTNEY: Well, Your Honor, that's the\nproblem with the rule, is that it in some ways rewards the\nunscrupulous employer in Sure-Tan and penalizes the\ninnocent employer, as in Hoffman. If the unscrupulous\nemployer knowingly hires an illegal alien, then whenever\nsome kind of union organizing drive comes along and say\ngee, we can get rid of them, and we know they're illegal,\nand we're going to terminate them, then they can report\nthem to the INS right from the outset --\nQUESTION: Mr. McCortney --\nQUESTION: Well, the difference is --\nMR. McCORTNEY: -- get him departed, and cut off\nback pay.\nQUESTION: The difference is, of course, that if\nthe employer knowingly hires this alien, he's subject to a\nlot of other penalties under the immigration law.\nMR. McCORTNEY: That's correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Take an employer who, you know, all\nhe does, he says, I've checked their cards, I've checked\ntheir cards, the cards say they're here legally, and he\nruns some God-awful sweat shop.\nNow, your theory, there is no remedy under any\nlaw against that employer but for a prospective remedy,\nand so everyone gets one bite at that apple.\nQUESTION: Well, he has to pay for the sweat,\nthough, doesn't he?\nMR. McCORTNEY: Absolutely.\nQUESTION: And it's pretty low cost, because\nhe's violating every labor law under the sun.\nQUESTION: If, indeed, the worker, under this\nscheme you're proposing, there's no doubt that the\ndocument -- undocumented alien works, he's going to get\npaid for the work.\nMR. McCORTNEY: Absolutely, Your Honor, no\ndoubt, and we have never advocated --\nQUESTION: And in Justice Breyer's hypothetical\nthere's an OSHA violation.\nMR. McCORTNEY: Could be. There could be an\nOSHA violation, and we're -- as I said in answer to\nJudge -- Justice Ginsburg's question, we recognize that\nundocumented aliens are given certain rights and benefits\nto level the playing field.\nQUESTION: What about title VII?\nMR. McCORTNEY: Under title VII, if it's back\npay exactly like back pay under the National Labor\nRelations Act, where it's unearned wages for work not\nperformed during the back pay period, then that would be a\nproblem.\nQUESTION: Suppose the allegation is, they kept\nme in this entry-level job, although I was qualified for\nthe next step, because I was a woman and they never\npromote women. That's the charge, and she wants back pay,\nshe wants to be paid at the rate she should have earned\nabsent sex discrimination.\nMR. McCORTNEY: In that situation, Your Honor,\nif it were discovered that the illegal -- that this person\nwas an illegal alien --\nQUESTION: Make it just like this case.\nMR. McCORTNEY: Then there are other remedies\navailable under title VII to effectuate the policies of\nthe act and to enforce compliance.\nQUESTION: I'm asking about back pay for title\nVII. You said you would treat FLSA differently, and there\nwould be back pay. Here, title VII, which -- would that\ngo -- be bracketed with FLSA, or would it be bracketed\nwith the NLRA?\nMR. McCORTNEY: It would be -- if -- in your\nsituation, you would get back pay, and let me explain the\ndifference in this case. The problem with the board's\nremedy is that the very nature of the remedy creates a\nduty to mitigate, which in turn requires and encourages\nthe illegal alien to seek interim employment, thereby\ncommitting further and new violations of the immigrations\nlaw.\nQUESTION: So in title VII, if she were laid\noff, say, because they laid off all the women before they\nlaid off any men, so she would also have a duty to\nmitigate in those circumstances, would the result be\ndifferent?\nMR. McCORTNEY: No. When there's a duty to\nmitigate which requires them to seek interim employment,\nthat is where the rub is, but under title VII, under,\nlike, the National Labor Relations Act, there's a whole\narray of other remedies available to enforce compliance.\nPunitive damages, you can -- compensatory damages,\nemotional distress, that is not dependent on the victims\nauthorization to work in this country.\nQUESTION: Of course, her complaint, if it were\ncomplaint, should read something like, you know, I\nshouldn't have been working at all, and it was illegal for\nme to be working at all, and I'm complaining because I\nonly got $12,000 in illegal wages. I should have gotten\n$14,000 in illegal wages. I don't find that a very\nappealing case anyway. Do you find that an appealing\ncase?\nMR. McCORTNEY: No, Your Honor, I don't. I\ndon't find that an appealing case.\nQUESTION: But you just told me that you would\nbracket title VII with the FLSA.\nMR. McCORTNEY: Yes, because I --\nnotwithstanding Justice Scalia's very good example that I\ndon't find that appealing, that there is a way that this\nCourt can distinguish between the National Labor Relations\nAct, which is remedial in nature, and all these other\nState and Federal discrimination laws that have punitive\nfeatures to it that are not dependent on the undocumented\nalien's ability to work in this country.\nQUESTION: Well, I don't have any doubt that\nthere are other ways for us to distinguish this, and it\nmay very well be that if this were an original matter with\nus we wouldn't have struck the balance where the board\ndid, but you've got the element here, the added element\nhere of the board's decision, and I suppose we owe some\nkind of respect to it. Given the confusion of statutes,\nthe extent to which we owe deference is not, perhaps,\nclear, but we've got to give some consideration to it,\nhaven't we?\nMR. McCORTNEY: Well, Your Honor --\nQUESTION: If I could just supplement that, do\nwe owe any deference to the views of the Attorney General\nof the United States, who is responsible for enforcing\nthese -- both statutes?\nMR. McCORTNEY: Your Honor, I don't believe so.\nUnder -- we're looking at a remedial statute under 10(c)\nof the NLRA, and the only deference that the board is\nentitled to is, if the remedy that they order does not\nconflict with the immigration laws and policies of this\ncountry.\nQUESTION: We don't give a deference to\nadministrative agencies as to what damage are available in\ncourt. That's not part of their administration of the\nlaws, is it? I don't know any case where we've said,\nwell, what damages -- you know, the agency can tell us\nwhat damages we can award. That seems quite\nextraordinary.\nQUESTION: Were there agency adjudications here?\nMR. McCORTNEY: In what way, Your Honor? There\nwas a back pay hearing, there was a underlying unfair\nlabor practice proceeding.\nQUESTION: Which -- and the result of which was?\nMR. McCORTNEY: That the employer was found to\nhave violated the National Labor Relations Act. The\nadministrative law judge at the back pay hearing --\nQUESTION: No, I mean, there was an\nadministrative order to pay, wasn't there?\nMR. McCORTNEY: Yes.\nQUESTION: That's what I thought.\nMR. McCORTNEY: But the administrative law judge\ndid find -- did not award any back pay to Castro because\nit conflicted with -- Sure-Tan had found that it\nconflicted with IRCA.\nQUESTION: But the board did.\nMR. McCORTNEY: Yes.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nQUESTION: I guess you're quite right that if\nthe board's award violates the immigration law, that's the\nend of the case.\nMR. McCORTNEY: That's correct.\nQUESTION: You win. But suppose that the\nimmigration law doesn't forbid that award in terms, but\nits policy would, in fact, be hindered, while the labor\nlaw, actually the policy is furthered, though it doesn't\ninsist on this kind of award, wouldn't we defer to the\nboard when it seeks to reconcile, or the Attorney General\nwhen they seek to reconcile the policies of the two\nstatutes?\nMR. McCORTNEY: No, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Because --\nMR. McCORTNEY: I respectfully disagree, and\nthis -- in Sure-Tan this Court said in devising remedies\nfor unfair labor practices the board is obliged to take\ninto account another equally important congressional\nobjective, to wit, the objective of deterring unauthorized\nimmigration that is embodied in the INA.\nQUESTION: Well, that goes back as far as\nSouthern Steamship Company, where you're talking about the\nmutiny statute, that the board can't just go ahead without\nany reference to competing statutes.\nMR. McCORTNEY: Well, Your Honor, I would agree,\nif the board's remedy conflicts with the policies of\nanother statutory scheme, then it's -- they're owed no\ndeference.\nQUESTION: The board did take that into account,\nthough. I don't remember what they did in this case, but\nin the case where the board explained that it was, indeed,\ntaking into account the policy of the immigration laws and\nthe policy of the NRA -- what was the name of that case?\nIt was affirmed on appeal. The case where the board laid\nout its reasoning for taking this position.\nMR. McCORTNEY: The APRA Fuel case?\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. McCORTNEY: Okay. Your Honor, the\nfundamental problem with this case is that this Court\nstated in Sure-Tan that the objective of the INA is to\ndeter unauthorized immigration, and that a --\nQUESTION: But let's go back to one thing it\nalso said in Sure-Tan, which is that the court of appeals\nhere made an estimate without any evidence as to the\nperiod of time these employees might have continued\nworking before apprehension by the INS, and that sounds --\nworking before apprehension by the INS, that sounds very\nclose to what the board did in this case?\nMR. McCORTNEY: Well, Your Honor, also in Sure-\nTan, in the last sentence of the remedial section of the\nopinion it states, by directing the board to impose a\nminimum back pay award without regard to the employee's\nactual economic losses or legal availability to work, the\ncourt of appeals plainly exceeded its limited authority\nunder the act. It made it clear that it wasn't just\nactual losses that was the problem, it was the fact that\nthe discriminatees were not either legally present or\nlegally authorized to work.\nQUESTION: So then, what do you make of the\ncondition about the period between the violation and when\nthe employees might have continued working before\napprehension by the INS?\nMR. McCORTNEY: Your Honor, I don't know,\nbecause the discriminatees in that case were -- left the\ncountry the same day their employment terminated.\nQUESTION: I'm not talking about the outcome of\nthat particular case, where they were in Mexico, but a\ncase where they were here, and the question was, how much\nback pay, and there's a reference to not a flat 6 weeks or\n6 months or whatever, but a time period from the unlawful\nemployment practice until one would expect the INS would\npick up these people.\nMR. McCORTNEY: Your Honor, again I think that\nis consistent with the other language in the Sure-Tan\ndecision which is repeated over and over again about legal\navailability to work, and being legally authorized to\nwork, and why would the Court use that language if it\ndidn't have to?\nSo I -- getting back to the policy of this that\nunderlies the immigration laws of this country, it is to\npreserve jobs for American workers. It is not the act of\nillegal entry that takes jobs away from American workers.\nIt's the act of working in this country without\nauthorization that takes jobs away from American workers,\nand I would submit that the continued presence of an\nillegal alien in this country poses a greater threat to\nAmerican jobs than an alien who enters this country\nrepeatedly, because the latter presupposes that the alien\nhas been physically absent from the job market for a\nperiod of time.\nIf the -- under the board's scenario, the Sure-\nTan discriminatees could have reentered on a tourist visa\nand be legally present and not legally authorized to work,\nand under that scenario they're clearly not entitled to\nback pay because it violates 1182(a)(5), that sets forth\nthe terms and conditions on which aliens can work in this\ncountry and those that can't.\nThe same would be true of aliens who enter the\ncountry on a student visa, or who overstay their visa and\nwork without authorization, so whether you have an alien\nthat enters this country illegally and works without\nauthorization, or who enters this country legally and\nworks without authorization, both takes jobs away from\nAmerican workers, and both violate the INA.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. McCortney.\nMr. Wolfson, we'll hear from you.\nMR. McCORTNEY: Thank you, Your Honor.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL R. Q, WOLFSON\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nQUESTION: Mr. Wolfson, before you get to the\nsubstance of the matter, I want to ask a question that\nsort of relates to something that Justice Steven asked --\nStevens asked, and that is, can we take it that this -- I\nknow that the SG's office usually reconciles the views of\nvarious agencies before a case is argued here. What was\nthe position of the Immigration and Naturalization\nService --\nMR. WOLFSON: Justice Scalia --\nQUESTION: -- in this matter when it was told\nthat it -- that you're going to argue that courts should\npay illegal aliens money that it was unlawful for them to\nearn? What did the INS say to that?\nMR. WOLFSON: Justice Scalia -- may it please\nthe Court -- the position in our brief has been developed\nin consultation with the Immigration and Naturalization\nService. This is the position of the United States,\nand --\nQUESTION: I understand that. Did the INS agree\nwith it?\nMR. WOLFSON: The INS has agreed with it and\naccepts it, and I'm here representing --\nQUESTION: They accept it.\nMR. WOLFSON: Right.\nQUESTION: They have no choice --\nMR. WOLFSON: Well --\nQUESTION: -- but to accept it if the Attorney\nGeneral --\nMR. WOLFSON: Well --\nQUESTION: -- tells them to. Well, I mean, if\nthey agreed with it, and just thought --\nMR. WOLFSON: The INS --\nQUESTION: -- well, I have no -- it explains why\nwe have a massive problem of illegal immigration, if\nthat's how the INS feels about this.\nMR. WOLFSON: I must disagree with that, Justice\nScalia, and the point is, as the board recognized both in\nthis decision and in the APRA Fuel decision which preceded\nit, the essential problem is that there is, as the board\npointed out, an inseverable connection between illegal\nimmigration, the availability of jobs, and poor working\nconditions for employees for -- that illegal immigrants\nare wiling to take in the United States.\nNow, Congress enacted IRCA on the premise that\nthere was very little that it could do about the wage\ndifferential and the difference in levels of employment,\nunemployment that was drawing illegal immigrants to the\nUnited States in search of jobs.\nQUESTION: What did it say in IRCA -- didn't the\nhistory of the report say that IRCA is not meant to\nundermine or diminish in any way labor protections in\nexisting law, or to limit the powers of labor relations\nboard to remedy unfair practices committed against\nundocumented employees?\nMR. WOLFSON: That is exactly right, so\nQUESTION: What is exactly right, that is what\nthe legislative history --\nMR. WOLFSON: That is what the legislative\nhistory says, but simultaneously in the --\nQUESTION: What legislative history was that? I\nmean, was this a really powerful portion of legislative\nhistory?\nMR. WOLFSON: Yes. Yes, it is.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: One committee report?\nMR. WOLFSON: It's two committee reports.\nQUESTION: Two committee reports?\nMR. WOLFSON: It's the Judiciary Committee,\nHouse Judiciary and the Education and Labor Committee, but\nI don't just have --\nQUESTION: Of the House or the Senate?\nMR. WOLFSON: Of the House.\nQUESTION: Both of the House?\nMR. WOLFSON: But I don't have just legislative\nhistory --\nQUESTION: Two committees in one House.\nMR. WOLFSON: I think it is important also to\nnote that in IRCA Congress also wrote into law\nauthorization of increased resources for enforcement of\nFederal labor laws by the Department of Labor by the Wage\nand Hour Division and the Office of Federal Contract\nCompliance.\nQUESTION: Did that include -- did it include\nthe National Labor Relations Board?\nMR. WOLFSON: It did not refer to the National\nLabor Relations Board, but the point is, Congress knew\nthat the Department of Labor was enforcing and should\nenforce Federal labor laws at the behest of and for the\nbenefit of illegal aliens to obtain back pay for them.\nQUESTION: They wanted to be sure that aliens\nwho had no right to be here, had no right to be earning\nany money --\nMR. WOLFSON: Well --\nQUESTION: -- should get paid for periods that\nthey didn't work? It's not a matter of their having\nworked and provided the employer with a benefit, which\nyou're then reimbursing them for, but they haven't worked.\nMR. WOLFSON: It is -- it's not just periods for\nwhich they have worked, which might arguably distinguish\nthe Fair Labor Standards Act --\nQUESTION: Right. Right.\nMR. WOLFSON: -- minimum -- you know, maximum\nhours and minimum wage. It's also the Office of Federal\nContract Compliance, which enforces antidiscrimination\nprovisions, routinely seeks back pay for aliens and others\nwho have been terminated in violation of executive orders.\nAnother --\nQUESTION: Even though it's unlawful for them to\nreceive that money?\nMR. WOLFSON: Even though -- yes, even though it\nis.\nQUESTION: That's extraordinary. I --\nMR. WOLFSON: It's a very --\nQUESTION: Let me --\nMR. WOLFSON: -- fundamental part of the Fair\nLabor Standard Act. Excuse me.\nQUESTION: In most back pay situations where the\nemployer has committed an unfair labor practice and\ndismisses an employee improperly, the amount he's going to\nbe stuck with for back pay is limited by the fact that the\nperson unlawfully fired has to mitigate. He has to find\nanother job. If he could have gotten another job easily\nand doesn't do so, the employer doesn't have to pay. Now,\nhow is this unlawful alien supposed to mitigate?\nMR. WOLFSON: Well --\nQUESTION: Mitigation is quite impossible, isn't\nit?\nMR. WOLFSON: I'm not sure I agree with that\nexactly, Justice Scalia. Here's -- I wouldn't say that\nthe undocumented alien has a duty to mitigate. I have to\nemphasize that the board is not --\nQUESTION: He does not have a duty to mitigate?\nMR. WOLFSON: I will agree with that. I have to\nsay the board has not examined this issue in detail, but\nfirst of all, of course, anything that he does obtain in\nthe matter of interim wages will be deducted from his back\npay --\nQUESTION: Oh. Oh.\nMR. WOLFSON: -- and that is quite consistent\nwith --\nQUESTION: If he unlawfully obtains another job,\nthat will be deducted?\nMR. WOLFSON: And -- yes, and that is quite\nconsistent --\nQUESTION: But if he's smart, he need not do\nthat.\nMR. WOLFSON: Not --\nQUESTION: If he's smart he'd say, how can I\nmitigate, it's unlawful for me to get another job.\nMR. WOLFSON: Justice Scalia --\nQUESTION: I can just sit home and eat\nchocolates and get my back pay.\nMR. WOLFSON: I don't agree that the board would\nhave to accept such a representation. That is, the board\nmight permissibly conclude that an undocumented alien\nshould not be any better off than an authorized worker by\nvirtue of his undocumented status, so if an employer could\nsay, well, if a person with the same credentials,\nbackground, education, and so forth, would have made a job\nsearch and would have obtained employment and would have\nobtained thus-and-such wages, this undocumented alien\nworker would have --\nQUESTION: Should have done so.\nMR. WOLFSON: Should have done -- or should\nhave --\nQUESTION: Should have violated the law.\nMR. WOLFSON: Or should not benefit from the\nfact that he is an undocumented alien and being relieved\nof -- and getting more back pay than the similarly\nsituated authorized worker.\nNow, the board was faced with the task here of\nreconciling two important Federal statutory schemes, the\nFederal labor laws and the immigration laws, consistent --\nQUESTION: I would think that the -- does the\nboard have to reconcile the Fair Labor Standards Act and\nthe Office of Contract Compliance? I would think that\nit's responsible as the National Labor Relations Act and\nthe Immigration Act in this case.\nMR. WOLFSON: That is correct, Mr. Chief\nJustice, but I -- but the board did look to IRCA and the\nCourt can look to IRCA, which includes these other\nprovisions in the Department of Labor, to determine what\nCongress is attempting to achieve in IRCA, and those are,\nI think, reasonable indicators of what Congress'\nobjectives were and how far it intended to go along with\nthe legislative history of the --\nQUESTION: Well, when the board makes its\ncalculus and when the Government made its calculus, did it\ngive any consideration to the fact that a union ought not\nas a matter of policy to use illegal aliens for organizing\nactivity, or do you think the union can do that?\nMR. WOLFSON: Well --\nQUESTION: Is it consistent with the labor laws\nof the United States for the union to say it knowingly\nuses an alien for organizing activity?\nMR. WOLFSON: I don't know that the board has\naddressed the point of knowingly using illegal aliens. I\ndo know that the board has concluded that undocumented\naliens may be included within the bargaining unit, and\nindeed, in both Sure-Tan -- in Sure-Tan itself I believe\nthey were included in the bargaining unit.\nQUESTION: And that doesn't induce illegal\nimmigration?\nMR. WOLFSON: Well --\nQUESTION: It seems to me that's a far more\ndirect link than the very tenuous idea that you have that\nthere's going to be more illegal immigration because they\nknow they're going to get back pay. Here, what you're\nsaying is that a union can, I suppose even knowingly, use\nillegal aliens on the workforce to organize the employer,\nknowing that by doing that the alien will still be\nentitled to back pay. That seems to me completely missing\nfrom any calculus, from any equitable calculus in your\nbrief. I just -- and since it's a more direct link, I'm\nquite puzzled by it.\nMR. WOLFSON: Well, I don't know -- I would\nsuggest that the more powerful inducement towards illegal\nmigration is the availability of the job, union or no.\nThat is, even if the union is willing to include\nundocumented workers in its bargaining unit, there still\nhas to be a job for that worker, and it is the employer\nwho is fundamentally in control of that matter, and it is\nthe employer --\nQUESTION: Mr. Wolfson, in these cases we're\nonly talking about a situation where the employer, and\npresumably the union, too, doesn't know, because if the\nemployer knows, then the employer's obligation is to\ndismiss that person, as I assume it would be the union's,\ntoo, but in all these cases the issue comes up only\nbecause the employer didn't know of the illegality, isn't\nthat so?\nMR. WOLFSON: Well, in this case the employer\ndid not know. Now, there are cases, I have to say, where\nthe employer does know, such as the APRA Fuel Corporation\nthat was referred to, and in that case what the board has\ndone is, it has said that the board -- the board has\nordered reinstatement on condition that the undocumented\nalien put himself into a situation where he can obtain\nreinstatement legally. That is, under no circumstances\ndoes the board order reinstatement of an employee who\neverybody knows is undocumented.\nQUESTION: But not back pay.\nMR. WOLFSON: It does order back pay up to the\npoint where either the employee is reinstated, or it\nterminates at a reasonable -- if the employee fails to put\nhimself in compliance with the immigration laws and become\nqualified, the board cuts off back pay as of the end of a\nreasonable period. That is consistent --\nQUESTION: Even though the employer -- I thought\nthat the rule was, as soon as the employer knows of the\nillegality we're not going to allow any back pay from then\non.\nMR. WOLFSON: Well, that is because in a case\nlike this, what the board is doing is affording the\nemployer the benefit of its general, after-acquired\nevidence rule.\nQUESTION: If he knows about illegality from the\nvery beginning, then we will --\nMR. WOLFSON: Well, in a situation --\nQUESTION: We will order back pay?\nMR. WOLFSON: Yes, because in a situation like\nthat the employee -- the employer is not well-situated to\nclaim the benefit of the after-acquired evidence rule,\nbecause it cannot claim that it wouldn't have hired the\nalien anyway.\nTo use an example --\nQUESTION: So you have two people violating the\nlaw, instead of one.\nMR. WOLFSON: Well, there are two people\nviolating the law here, Justice Scalia. I mean, the\nboard -- I mean, there aren't two people violating the\nimmigration laws, but the employer did violate the\nNational Labor Relations Act, and the board is quite\nproperly --\nQUESTION: From the time of his initial hiring\nup until his violation. I mean, but what you're saying is\nwhen both the employer and the employee are violating the\nlaw, we're going to -- you're asking the courts to give\ntheir benediction to this stark violation of United States\nlaw by awarding money that hasn't even been worked for.\nI -- it's just something courts don't do.\nMR. WOLFSON: Well, the board is charged with\nthe responsibility of developing a workable implementation\nof the National Labor Relations Act pursuant to its\nauthority under section 10(c). In doing so, it of course\nmust take into consideration the policies of the\nimmigration law, but there is no --\nQUESTION: What it's doing, though, really is\nkind of odd, because the result is that back pay awards to\nillegal workers are likely to be greater than to legal\nones under this board's policy, and that's so odd, and it\ngives the illegal alien an incentive to try to phony up\nmore documents and to extend for the longest possible time\nthe charade that the worker is here lawfully, and that's\nsurely strongly against the policies of the immigration\nact at the very least.\nMR. WOLFSON: The problem, Justice O'Connor, is\nthat the immigration act, the policies come down on both\nsides.\nI mean, yes, they obviously discourage illegal\nimmigration and obtaining of jobs by illegal immigrants,\nbut they also very strongly operate on the employer, and\nthe fundamental premise on which Congress enacted IRCA was\nthat it was the employer's -- the employer had a very\nstrong and natural economic and competitive incentive to\nhire illegal workers, and it is that -- it is -- the\nboard's concern, in this case I think quite properly, is\nthat if back pay were removed from the equation the --\nQUESTION: Well, but you --\nMR. WOLFSON: -- Congress's attempt to -- excuse\nme. I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: You say it comes down on both sides,\nand it makes certain acts by illegal immigrants illegal,\nthe entry, and it makes certain acts by the employer\nillegal. Here, the worker, the alien was violating the\nlaw. The employer was not violating the law. So you say\nit comes down on both sides. If both were violating the\nlaw I could see your point, but the employer was not\nviolating the law.\nMR. WOLFSON: That is correct, Mr. Chief\nJustice, but the board is attempting to fashion -- the\nboard doesn't know in advance which employer will violate\nthe law by hiring undocumented aliens knowingly and which\nwill not, or which employer will, you know --\nQUESTION: So you say this is a prophylactic\nrule?\nMR. WOLFSON: I think that the board is\nfashioning a rule that is implementing Congress' policy\nobjective in IRCA across the board.\nQUESTION: But shouldn't remedies be looked at\nafter the fact, let's find out who violated what and then\nfashion the appropriate remedy?\nMR. WOLFSON: Well, the Court has not said that\nthe board has to only fashion its remedies in a case in\nwhich the precise situation -- you know, in the precise\nsituation into which it's dedicated.\nIn a case called NLRB v., I think, 7-Up Bottling\nCompany the Court explained that the board can make its\nback pay calculations for the purpose of across-the-board\nrules rather than just the employer to which -- that is\nbefore the board itself, and the point is, even though\nthis employer, even though there's no evidence that this\nemployer violated IRCA when it -- nonetheless the board, I\nthink, could quite reasonably say, well, if -- or if there\nis a flat rule that employees will never get back pay when\nthey are terminated in violation of the National Labor\nRelations Act, employers then will pick up on that rule\nand they will say, okay, now I can get away with it\nbecause there's not going to be any remedy for any\nemployee, and this is a very large --\nQUESTION: They won't get away with it. They're\nsubject to prosecution for -- if they know that it's an\nillegal --\nMR. WOLFSON: It's not just the problem of their\nknowing that they're illegal hiring. There also is the\npaperwork obligations, the verification systems, and I\nthink there is a very real concern that an employer who\nknows that there's not really any monetary price to being\nlax in hiring, in checking whether illegal aliens are\nhired would say, well, on the one hand I just have the\ncivil violations for violating the paperwork concerns. On\nthe other hand, the labor of undocumented aliens is in a\nvery real sense much --\nQUESTION: But it's just not reasonable --\nQUESTION: Why should the board be responsible\nfor making sure that the employer documents his material\nabout illegal aliens?\nMR. WOLFSON: I don't think that -- it's not\nthat the board is implementing IRCA, Mr. Chief Justice.\nIt is that its policy here is consistent with the policies\nthat I've been discussing.\nQUESTION: Well, here's the thing. When an\nemployer reviews documents and concludes that they're\nvalid and the person is lawfully here, then the employer\nisn't going to get some advantage of hiring some illegal\nalien because the worker will have to be paid and given\nbenefits as though the worker were legally here, so\nthere's no incentive for the employer under those\ncircumstances to give a bum deal to the employee.\nQUESTION: None at all.\nQUESTION: But there is an incentive, it seems\nto me, for the employee to continue to conceal the facts,\nthe facts that he's here illegally and has no right to\nwork, and that the documents are false, and the board's\nrule fosters both those --\nMR. WOLFSON: But one does have to take into\naccount I think what would be the consequence of an\nopposite rule, that is, no back pay for an undocumented\nalien, and there is, I think, a very serious consequence\nthat a flat rule that said something like, 7 million\nundocumented workers just simply get no back pay at all if\nthey are in this country illegally and not employed.\nThat is a very large class of people to\nbasically say, you are just without a remedy under the\nNational Labor Relations Act, and there may be\nimplications for other Federal labor laws as well, and --\nQUESTION: But why should they be used to\norganize a bargaining unit --\nMR. WOLFSON: Because it --\nQUESTION: -- if they're illegal employees? I'm\nbaffled by that.\nMR. WOLFSON: Because it -- well, because the\nlabor laws benefit everybody, and it's not just -- I mean,\nthey are -- when I say they're organizing a bargaining\nunit, obviously they are -- there may be -- in this case\nthere were other citizens and authorized aliens who are\ninterested in organizing for the purpose of vindicating\ntheir rights under section 7 of the labor relations act.\nThe Court pointed this out in Sure-Tan, where it said it\nis appropriate to include illegal aliens within the\ndefinition of employees, because all the workers are in it\ntogether.\nQUESTION: I would have thought, Mr. Wolfson,\nthat when you said, you know, there are 7 million illegal\naliens in this country, that what you would follow that\nwith is not, that's an awful lot of people not to give\nback pay to. I would have thought you would follow it\nwith, we have to do something to reduce this massive\nnumber of 7 million illegal aliens.\nMR. WOLFSON: And what --\nQUESTION: And what you don't want to do to\nreduce it is to give them back pay.\nMR. WOLFSON: Now, there is no question that\nthere is a serious problem of illegal immigration, and the\nINS and the Attorney General dedicate substantial\nresources to attempting to resolve that problem.\nOn the other hand, Congress without question\nrecognized when it enacted IRCA that this was a many-\nfaceted problem, and one aspect of the problem was that\nthere was a natural magnet in drawing illegal,\nundocumented workers here in the wage differential, and\nthat employers were willing to give jobs, and that it\nshould not be cheaper for an employer to hire an\nundocumented alien than it is to hire --\nQUESTION: Okay, but the argument, Mr.\nWolfson -- every time -- and I understand that argument.\nEvery time you make that argument, it seems to me the\nanswer comes back, there are other ways to go against the\nemployer. You can fine the employer, you can bring\ncriminal actions against the employer, and so on, so that\nthe answer always is the effort to discourage employers\nfrom hiring illegal aliens doesn't depend upon the back\npay.\nI thought the board's position was strongest to\ncounter that when the board says, there's kind of the gray\narea in which it's not clear that we can prosecute. The\nevidence of what the employer knew at the relevant time is\nnot leaping out at us, and so what we are trying to do is\nto fashion a remedy for those cases in which it's not\npractical to prosecute, but which we know perfectly well\nin the real world employers are winking at the likelihood\nthat they're employing illegal aliens. That's the group\nthat we want to provide the inducement for by forcing back\npay. Is -- am I giving the board too much credit?\nMR. WOLFSON: I wouldn't say that the board has\nlimited -- it certainly hasn't limited its remedy to that\nsituation --\nQUESTION: Well, why then, in the question --\nwhy in the question -- because I have exactly the same\nquestion. That's exactly what I thought. In the question\nthat the Government presented it says, whether an order to\npay back pay to an employee who was discriminatorily laid\noff, but only up to the date on which petitioner\ndiscovered that the employee was an undocumented alien,\nwhether that kind of order is lawful. That's how you saw\nthe question presented.\nNow are you telling me that what I'm supposed to\ndecide is a case I really didn't think I had to decide,\nwhich is, what happens if the board awards back pay to\nothers, such as those whom the employer has always known\nwere illegal?\nMR. WOLFSON: We are not suggesting that the\nCourt has to decide that case here. Indeed, in our brief\nin opposition to the cert petition we pointed out that\nthat was a different set of cases, the set of cases under\nthe APRA --\nQUESTION: Well, if it's a narrow question, just\nwhat Justice Souter said I had taken to be the precise\nrationale for the narrow set of cases we're supposed to\ndecide. Now, maybe that's all not so. That, I think, is\nwhat he was saying, and I'm seconding it.\nQUESTION: Clearly you haven't missed your\nopportunity.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. WOLFSON: Justice Breyer, my point is that\nthe board in a case -- the board did rely on its APRA Fuel\ndecision in this case, but what it held in this case was\nthat an employer, once an employer learns that an alien is\nundocumented and therefore he cannot be hired, and in\naddition that the board accepts that that employer would\nnot have hired that alien and would have discharged the\nalien when it found out that he was undocumented, then the\nemployer should surely get the benefit of the after-\nacquired evidence rule that is applied in many, many kinds\nof Federal labor laws, including the Age Discrimination\nAct, for example.\nQUESTION: Once you adopt that rule, however, it\nseems to me that the asserted benefit to the immigration\nlaws that you're claiming this rule has disappears. It is\nno disincentive to any employer, because the only employer\nwho would get the benefit of the rule that you don't get\nany back pay would be the perfectly innocent employer who\nhires someone not knowing that the person is an unlawful\nalien. How are you possibly deterring anybody?\nYou're trying to deter the employer who hires an\nimmigrant, apparently with this in the back of his mind:\nI know this guy's an immigrant and I can commit an unfair\nlabor practice upon him. I'm rather skeptical whether\nthat's high in the mind of any employer, but assuming it\nis, you still have to assume, if he's going to be\ndeterred, that he knows that the person is an illegal\nimmigrant, but this rule only applies to people who don't\nknow.\nMR. WOLFSON: Well, whether or not -- he may not\nknow in the face of having clear, irrefutable evidence\nbefore him. On the other hand, he may be induced to be\nsomewhat lax in his compliance with the obligations of the\nverification system, because --\nQUESTION: Well, get him for that, then. Get\nhim for that, then.\nMR. WOLFSON: Well, that -- of course, that's\nnot --\nQUESTION: But your -- isn't another way to\ndescribe the class you're dealing with is, he may not know\nin the sense that the Government can prove that he knew,\nbut there is a class of employees as to whom the evidence\nis not clear, and it is that class that we want to provide\nthe negative inducement for. Isn't that the answer?\nMR. WOLFSON: I think at a, I would say at a\nminimum that is the answer, and the board cannot know in\nadvance --\nQUESTION: Why should the board take over\nresponsibility for those provisions that are basically\nimmigration law provisions?\nMR. WOLFSON: Mr. Chief Justice, the board does\nnot view itself as enforcing the immigration laws. I\nthink the question is, is this particular order\ninconsistent with the immigration laws, or is it\nconsistent, and for some of the reasons that are being\nexpressed here, all that we are saying is that it does\nnot -- it is consistent with them.\nSurely there is no direct conflict with the\nimmigration laws. The board --\nQUESTION: What you just agreed to in your\ncolloquy with Justice Souter does contradict the\nimmigration -- I remember when this statute was passed\nabout what the responsibility of the employer was. It was\na clear provision of the statute that all the employer has\nto do is check the papers. It isn't the responsibility of\nthe employer to look behind the papers and see whether\nit's forged.\nNow you're saying, ah, but there are some\nemployers that maybe, yeah, you know, they complied with\nthe provision of the law, they looked at the card, which\nis what the -- there was a big fight over that. How much\nis -- investigatory responsibility is going to be placed\non the employer, and the answer was basically none, just\nlook at the documentation, and now you're saying, but some\nemployers, we think they should have known better, and\nwe're going to impose on this class of employers and, as\nit turns out, on a lot of others, liability which they\nshouldn't have.\nMR. WOLFSON: They don't have any liability\nunder IRCA. I mean, nobody is suggesting that the board\ncan impose a liability under IRCA, but there is a concern,\nI think, that if en employer is totally exempted from back\npay, a back pay remedy under another Federal labor law,\nthat that does -- that does work an inducement on the part\nof the employer to hire illegal aliens.\nQUESTION: Do no more than what the statute\nrequires. Check the documentation. If the documentation\nis there, and valid on its face, he's entitled to proceed.\nThat's what the fight was about, and that's how the\nimmigration law came out.\nMR. WOLFSON: I do want to touch a bit on Sure-\nTan, which I haven't had much of a chance to discuss.\nOur -- we have submitted in our brief that we think that\nthe facts of the Sure -- of the situation in Sure-Tan\nreally make it quite distinguishable from this particular\ncase. In Sure-Tan, first of all I do want to point out\nthat the condition that the Court explained and put on a\nreinstatement and back pay remedy, those did originate in\nthe Seventh Circuit, and no party to this Court challenged\nthat condition, that reinstatement and back pay had to be\nconditioned on the employee showing that he was legally\nauthorized to be present and employed in the United\nStates.\nNow, the Court perceived that what happened in\nSure-Tan was essentially the employer was being forced to\nsay to the employee, you have a guaranteed job and a\npaycheck waiting for you right now, so come back to the\nUnited States right now and pick it up. I mean, that\nobviously is a very powerful lure to an employee to\nmigrate back to the United States if there is no condition\nthat the employee show that he is authorized.\nWe submit that the incentives work quite\ndifferently in a case like this where the employee does\nremain in the United States. Congress did enact IRCA on\nthe assumption that illegal, undocumented alien employees\nin the United States were at the very bottom of the wage\nscale, they were likely to remain here as long as they\ncould get any job that was available, and as against that,\nwe submit that the inducement to violate the immigration\nlaws that petitioner suggests by the prospect of waiting\naround after years of litigation for the prospect of some\nkind of back pay award at the end of the day is quite\nminimal, and all the courts that have looked at this under\nother Federal law such as title VII and the FLSA have\nagreed that it is not the prospect of a back pay award\nthat induces illegal migration or illegal stay in the\nUnited States, it is the prospect of any job at any wage\nthat is available, and so the incentives do operate quite\ndifferently here than they did in Sure-Tan.\nQUESTION: Mr. Wolfson, do you think a State\ncourt could enforce a contract for employment by an\nillegal alien?\nMR. WOLFSON: I do not think that a State court\ncould --\nQUESTION: You know, an illegal --\nMR. WOLFSON: Right.\nQUESTION: -- makes a contract with an employer,\nthen it is -- he sues because the employer doesn't go\nahead with it, and -- could a State court say, well, you\nmade the contract, you should be liable for damages?\nMR. WOLFSON: I think a State court could award\ndamages, and State courts have done so. It could not\norder specific performance, because that would order -- it\ncould not order specific performance in ordering the\nemployer to employ the person because that would be\nemployment in violation of IRCA, but there, there would be\na direct conflict with IRCA, but State courts have --\nQUESTION: There's no doctrine that conflicts in\nviolation of the law are unenforceable?\nMR. WOLFSON: They're not necessarily completely\nvoid. I mean, not just contracts, but State courts have\nawarded tort damages for lost wages. It is universally\nthe rule that undocumented aliens are entitled to Worker's\nCompensation. I think only two States have gone the other\nway, and all of the State courts that have looked at that\nhave said, yes, it is true, when the employee is just --\nyou know, is injured and claims Worker's Compensation he\nis claiming a measure of compensation that is related to\nthe employment he would have had, but nonetheless, the\nvast majority of State courts have held that illegal\naliens can proceed under the Worker's Compensation rules,\nand the same is true of tort and contract damages as well.\nQUESTION: But all of that is for work done --\nMR. WOLFSON: No --\nQUESTION: -- or injury suffered, not to\nenforce a contract which has not been executed, which is\nwhat's going on here.\nMR. WOLFSON: Well, there may -- perhaps there\nis a difference between tort and contract damages, but it\nis not just for work done. If it is for injury suffered,\nit is for injury suffered as measured against that the\nwork would have been done, or work that would have been\ndone. I mean, surely that's the case in tort damages or\nWorker's Compensation, where the employee says, I would\nhave worked and you owe me this money.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\n"
