FREDERICK,\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. FREDERICK: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and may it please the Court.\nIn 1988, the Government of British Columbia\ncreated Powerex to perform a variety of public functions\nincluding the marketing of surplus hydropower generated\nby development of the Province's natural resources\npursuant to bilateral agreements with the United States.\nThe Ninth Circuit, however, denied Powerex\nits rightful status as an organ of a foreign State\nentitled to remove this case from State court to Federal\ncourt.\nBefore addressing the appellate jurisdiction\nissue, I'd like to highlight briefly the two key errors\nby the Ninth Circuit in rejecting Powerex's organ\nstatus. First, the court articulated the wrong test for\ndetermining an entity's status as an organ of a foreign\nState. The factors the Ninth Circuit found dispositive\nare inconsistent with the FSIA; and second, the court\noverlooked crucial evidence of Powerex's public\nfunctions that are the best indication of its sovereign\nstatus. The British Columbia Government receives and\ndistributes the proceeds from Powerex's operations,\nsupervises Powerex through BC Hydro, subjects Powerex to\nprovincial laws not applicable to private companies and\ngrants Powerex special benefits including exemption from\ntaxation.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Frederick, are you\ngoing to get to the 1447(d) problem?\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes. Let me address that\nnow. The court's -- the district court's remand order\nwas appealable because it was not issued under 1447(c).\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The district court\nthought it was and one we did, the district court said I\nhave no authority in -- under -- over any of these\npeople. So back it goes.\nMR. FREDERICK: The district court made two\nmutually exclusive statements, that remand was proper\nand that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction. Because\nof that inconsistency, the court of appeals --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Removal. Removal was-\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- talking that -- where\nare these statements?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You said remand was proper.\nThat's the --\nMR. FREDERICK: Sorry. That removal was\nproper under the sovereign removal provisions of 1441(d)\nand 1442(a). It also then said it lacked subject matter\njurisdiction.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But at the point it was\nacting it was remanding, and its basis for remanding was\nnot that it thought the removal had been proper; the\nbasis for its remanding was that it said it lacked\njurisdiction over three of the other cross defendants.\nMR. FREDERICK: But immunity was the basis\nof the district court's thinking that it had to remand.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It may have been, leaving\naside the question of whether it was right or wrong, it\nmay have been wrong. But what it thought it was doing\nit seems to me is fairly clearly remanding for a\njurisdictional reason.\nMR. FREDERICK: And what this Court's cases\nsay, Justice Souter, is that the remand has to be a\nground cognizable under 1447(c).\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Those cases are all\n-- all based on Thermtron. You don't have any doubt\nthat Thermtron would come out the other way today, do\nyou?\nMR. FREDERICK: I certainly do --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- in light of, in\nlight of the statutory language as it exists now?\nMR. FREDERICK: Mr. Chief Justice, the\nThermtron rule has been reaffirmed no less than four\ntimes by this Court, notwithstanding two statutory\namendments. It has been reaffirmed and stare decisis on\nthe basis of statute is the strongest form of stare\ndecisis. So I do --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But stare decisis on\nthe basis of statute is kind of a weak basis when the\nstatute's been changed.\nMR. FREDERICK: Mr. Chief Justice, the\nThermtron rule was reaffirmed earlier this term in the\nOsborn case, has been reaffirmed in prior cases lead --\nfrom the time it was decided even through statutory\namendments. Our submission is that if Congress intended\nto change that rule, it could have done so clearly. And\nwe note that the Respondents here don't ask for\nThermtron to be overruled, and it is clear from the\namicus on their side, that the only way you could rule\nin favor of the Respondents in this case would be to\noverrule Thermtron.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But Thermtron was such a\nfar cry from this case. In Thermtron the district judge\nsaid yes, I have jurisdiction but I'm just too busy, so\nI'm going to toss this case back to the State court.\nMR. FREDERICK: But here, Justice Ginsburg,\nthe court did have jurisdiction because removal was\nproperly effectuated once the entities that we moved\nwere identified correctly as sovereigns, either foreign\nsovereigns in the case of BC Hydro, or Federal\nsovereigns in the case of BPA.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But we go into that\nquestion all the time, 1447(b) is a nullity. I mean, if\nin every case you're going to be able to appeal whether\nindeed there was lack of jurisdiction, you're going to\nbe able to appeal every case.\nMR. FREDERICK: No, you're not,\nJustice Scalia, and here's why. Immunity is not a\nground for remand because it is not a precondition for a\nremoval by a sovereign. It is a separate freestanding\nissue. It is a status determination that determines\nwhether removal is proper by those sovereigns.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That would be fine if\n1447(d) said that there is no appeal so long as the\nbasis for removal was proper, but that's not what it\nsays.\nMR. FREDERICK: But if in Thermtron the\ncourt, the district court had said my docket is too\nbusy, I therefore lack subject matter jurisdiction and\nremand under 1447(c), I don't think there's any doubt\nthat the courts would look beyond the label given.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't think the court\nsaid in Thermtron, so therefore, I have no subject\nmatter jurisdiction.\nMR. FREDERICK: I'm speaking hypothetically,\nJustice Ginsburg. My point is that the label the\ndistrict court attached here was the wrong label, and\nthat's why the court of appeals to satisfy --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why? Why was it wrong\nwhen with respect to the sovereign parties, the district\ncourt said I have -- these people are totally immune\nfrom suit; therefore, I have no jurisdiction over them.\nMR. FREDERICK: Because it is inconsistent\nwith the notion that remand orders have no preclusive\neffect to remand a case on the ground that the\nsovereigns are immune, and force them to relitigate\ntheir immune status in State court. That is precisely\nwhy Congress enacted these sovereign removal provisions.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then what you are really\narguing for is, in effect, a separate rule, and that is\nthat 1447(d) has an exception when we are dealing with\nforeign sovereign immunities.\nMR. FREDERICK: That's our backup\nsubmission, Justice Souter. You do not need to reach\nthat if you agree with our principal submission and --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But the trouble with the\nprincipal submission, it seems to me, is that we have\nsaid that even if the district court has come to an\nerroneous conclusion about jurisdiction, if it\nunderstands that it is making a jurisdictional ruling,\nthat is not appealable.\nMR. FREDERICK: But Justice Souter, it did\nso. The case -- the cases in which the Court has said\nso have always been grounds -- jurisdictional grounds\ncognizable under 1447(c). Immunity from suit is not\nsuch a ground, because the purpose of having the removal\nprovision on the basis of status is to allow the Federal\ncourts to decide the immunity status. If the court\nsends the case back to State court on immunity grounds,\nit does not have preclusive effect in the State courts.\nThe State courts will be obliged to relitigate sovereign\nimmunity status and there will be no recourse except\nthrough appeal through the State court --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you're into your\nbackup argument now.\nMR. FREDERICK: No.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The backup argument that\nyou're now making, that not your principal argument.\nMR. FREDERICK: No, Justice Scalia, that's\nnot our backup argument. Our point is that in this\ncase, the district court had jurisdiction by virtue of\nthe successful removals, which everybody conceded were\ncorrect, that the label that it attached, immunity is\nsubject matter jurisdiction, is not a label for a ground\nrecognized in 1447(c). So it was appropriate for the\ncourt of appeals to exercise appellate jurisdiction to\ndetermine whether or not the remand was a mandatory\nremand under 1447(c) or a discretionary one of the type\nthis Court has recognized in the Cohill case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Did you request -- when\nthe question of Powerex -- authority over Powerex was\nbefore the district court, did you request that the\ndistrict court give you a 1292(b) order before the court\nremanded the case, so that you could have gotten the\ncase -- the question up on appeal?\nMR. FREDERICK: I don't believe that we did,\nJustice Ginsburg. This case was remanded. A motion --\nmotions for clarification were subsequently brought.\nBut a 1292(b) order was not requested by Powerex.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Because that would have\ntaken care of it if the district judge agreed to delay\nthe remand to allow this question of law to be\ndetermined by the court of appeals.\nMR. FREDERICK: It is certainly the case\nthat in searching through the docket entries, you'll\ndiscover that there was a holding by the district court\nof the remand, which is in itself an unusual procedure.\nBut the point that is important here is that\neven apart from that, when the court had jurisdiction\npursuant to the removal provisions, it did not lose\nsubject matter jurisdiction by finding the immunity\nclaims upon the part of the Federal and foreign\nsovereigns. And it is their theory that the district\ncourt never had subject matter jurisdiction, and that\nhas to be wrong because it conflicts with the purposes\nbehind the removal provision to give the sovereigns the\nopportunity to litigate their immunity defenses in\nFederal court.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They don't care whether it\nhad subject matter jurisdiction or not. It's not an\nessential part of their case. Their case is even if it\ndid, it mistakenly thought it didn't, and remand it, end\nof case.\nMR. FREDERICK: Their submission in this\nCourt, however, is that there was no subject matter\njurisdiction.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's their backup\nargument, I think.\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, their backup argument\nshould be rejected by the Court as wrong.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If in fact it goes back to\nthe State court and you litigate it, you lost, can you\nraise as a point of appeal that you did not receive two\nthings the statute guaranteed you? One was a\ndetermination in the Federal court that you're an organ\nof a Federal State, and second, a bench trial?\nMR. FREDERICK: Justice Breyer, there's no\nprovision --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, but could you?\nMR. FREDERICK: By the time the appeals in\nthe State court would have been exhausted, the very\nbenefits --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, I'm just asking could\nyou, yes or no. I --\nMR. FREDERICK: We would certainly make the\nargument.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, okay. Now if you lost\nin the State court, could you then use that as a basis\nfor asking this Court to accept jurisdiction? And if\nthey -- if we did, we took it and we heard the case,\nreverse, and send it back for the proper tribal under\nthe statute?\nMR. FREDERICK: Justice Breyer, I would not\nwant to foreclose any arguments that we might try to\nmake; but let me point out to you that in the years that\nit would take to march through the State court system,\nPowerex, as a sovereign, would be denied its right to\nhave a bench trial --\nJUSTICE BREYER: See, what I'm getting at is\nwhenever there's an erroneous remand, the practical\nproblems that you raise are present. And they're awful.\nI don't deny them. I mean, they're right there in the\nstatute, it foresees them. So I wonder, is there any\ndifference in this case from every case where the remand\nis erroneous?\nMR. FREDERICK: I do think foreign\nsovereigns are different, and Congress intended to treat\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: In terms of the legal right\nto get the trial to which the law entitles you on your\nview of the law, there is no difference.\nMR. FREDERICK: The foreign sovereign is\nentitled to a bench trial. It is entitled to other\nprocedural protections with respect to treatment of\ngarnishment, other --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And you would get those\neventually, it would just have to happen.\nMR. FREDERICK: It would be after -- it\nwould be --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's purely --\npure question begging. I mean, the whole issue on the\nmerits is whether it's a foreign sovereign or not. And\nyou can't assume that you're correct when the remand\nprovision or the provision barring appeal when it's been\nremanded doesn't care whether you're correct. The idea\nis, you can get a correct determination in State court\nthrough up to review by this Court eventually, as you\ncan in Federal court. There's no reason to assume that\nthe Federal court is the only place you would get a\ncorrect determination.\nMR. FREDERICK: But Mr. Chief Justice, the\npoint of having Congress enact these removal provisions\nand to ensure jurisdiction in the federal court for\nsovereigns on the basis of their status is entirely to\nvindicate those rights and interests. If Powerex were\nsued for not --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's -- it's the same with\ndiversity jurisdiction. You can make the same argument.\nThere's nothing distinctive here. This statute says\nthat in a foreign sovereign immunity case you have a\nright to be tried in Federal court. Fine. But the\nstatute also says that if you're a defendant in a\ndiversity suit, you have a right to trial in federal\ncourt.\nAnd I don't know why this is any more\ndemanding of an exception to 1447(d) than is ordinary\ndiversity jurisdiction, where Congress has said you're\nentitled to trial in federal court.\nMR. FREDERICK: Diversity is different,\nJustice Scalia, and here's why.\nWhen a case is removed on diversity grounds,\nthe court of appeals -- the district court is obliged to\nexamine the bases of diversity. That is what the\ncourt's removal duty is. When a foreign sovereign\nremoves a case, the district court's duty is to\ndetermine is this a foreign State within the meaning of\nthe FSIA. If it is, I have jurisdiction.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Frederick, may I just\nfollow up on Justice Breyer's question? It seems to me\nthat your answer suggests that you have two bites at the\napple because you -- all the way along, you might win.\nAnd if you won, then it wouldn't matter. If you lose,\nyou always have the argument that you've made here,\nlet's go back and start over again.\nMR. FREDERICK: Justice Stevens, I don't\nthink we would win at all in that circumstance because\nwe would be forced as a foreign State to litigate in\nState court contrary to Congress's will.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but --\nMR. FREDERICK: Whatever arguments that may\nbe preserved --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But you might win that\nlitigation. It's not impossible, is it?\nMR. FREDERICK: It is certainly not\nimpossible, but the point --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And if you lose, you\nalways have a point on appeal and may start all over\nagain later on.\nMR. FREDERICK: It is unclear to me, and I'm\nnot sure that I've seen any of this Court's cases that\nwould suggest that the denial of that kind of procedural\nright would be grounds for reversing a State court\njudgment. And our position is that Congress intended to\nprotect the bench trial right, the immunity defenses of\na foreign sovereign, because the organ status\nquestioned --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Did anybody in this\ncase -- did any of the Defendants in this case request a\ntrial by jury?\nMR. FREDERICK: I don't recall whether the\nDefendants do, but it is clear that the Plaintiffs would\nbe entitled to a jury trial --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And have they asked for\nit? Has any party asked for a jury trial? If not, that\npart of the case seems academic.\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, the case has settled,\nJustice Ginsburg, prior to the formal invocation of\ntrial procedures, and so --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The case is settled?\nMR. FREDERICK: As explained in the cert\npetition papers, the case is on appeal in the State\ncourt system on objections to the settlement, and it\nwill not be mooted during the course of this Court's\naction on the case.\nBut the invocation of jury that would be\ndone normally just before trial has not been an issue\nthat's been presented.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that's different\nthan it is in the Federal courts. You have to -- can't\nwait to the eve of trial to demand a jury.\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, what the Plaintiffs\nhere assert is that they would be denied their right to\njury trial, and I presume that that means they intend to\nask for one and to perpetuate that request. Our\nposition, as we explain in a footnote in our reply\nbrief, is that they have a jury trial right as against\nDuke and Reliant; they do not as against the foreign\nsovereigns that they have sued.\nSo at root, the case is about the kind of\ncomity and dignity that the courts of the United States\nwill accord to foreign sovereigns. If Powerex were sued\non the basis of non-commercial acts, it would not be\nentitled to have its immunity defense vindicated if the\ndistrict court is held to have no jurisdiction,\nnotwithstanding the proper removal under 1441(d).\nI'd like to save the reminder of my time for\nrebuttal, please.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Frederick.\nMr. Hallward-Driemeier.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES\nAS AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThis Court has recognized repeatedly that\nthe bar on appellate review in 1447(d) applies only to\nremands under 1447(c). This Court has held that the\ncourts of appeals have authority to decide whether a\nremand order was, in fact, one within the authority of\n1447(c). In fact, just this term in Osborn, the\ndistrict court remanded the case on the basis of 1447(c)\nfor purported lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Osborn made it very clear\nthat was an extraordinary case where Congress had\nexplicitly ordered two conflicting things. One, it said\nno remand of a case of this type, and then it said no\nreview of remands. So the Court was as clear as it\ncould be that only when you have those conflicting\nsignals does that court -- does that case have any\napplication.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Your Honor is\nabsolutely correct. Osborn concerned a particular kind\nof categorical exception from 1447(c). Our argument is\nthat as a categorical matter, the basis of remand in\nthis case was not one within the scope of 1447(c). That\nalthough the District Court termed the sovereign\nimmunity of the defendant's jurisdictional, it was not\njurisdictional in the relevant sense. And this Court\nheld precisely that in the Oliver American trading case.\nThere, a case removed by Mexico was dismissed by the\ndistrict court on the basis of its immunity and the\ndistrict court certified that holding as a\njurisdictional decision immediately appealable to this\nCourt.\nYet this Court looked beyond that label\nattached by the district court and held that sovereign\nimmunity is not jurisdictional in the relevant sense\nbecause it does not limit the authority of the Federal\ncourts qua Federal courts but rather is a general rule\nthat would preclude suit in State court as well.\nLikewise, under 1447(c) it is not a basis to remand that\nthe defendant is immune.\nWhen Congress authorized sovereign\ndefendants to remove cases to Federal court to vindicate\ntheir immunity, it did not intend that when the district\ncourt upheld that immunity, it would be remanded to\nState court which would be free to disregard the Federal\ncourt's decision.\nJUSTICE BREYER: One technical question.\nThe same one. I would to be -- imagine it is a\ndiversity case. Imagine that a Federal court\nerroneously remands it. A trial gets up to this Court.\nAnd we say it was diverse. It shouldn't have been\nremanded. Now what's -- is that like -- can that\nhappen? I guess. And is the remedy then wipe out the\nState proceedings, go back to Federal court? What\nhappens? Has that have ever been a case like that?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What happened?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: The Missouri\nPacific Railway case holds that even this Court, on\nreview of a State court judgment following remand cannot\nreview the remand order itself. It can review issues of\nFederal law that were decided by the State courts on\nremand but --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And it is called, the case,\nMissouri --\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Missouri Pacific\nRailway case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, what --\nwhat do you do about 1447(e) which says that if after\nremoval joinder might defeat subject matter\njurisdiction, the court can deny joinder or permit\njoinder and remand the action. In other words, you have\ngot subject matter jurisdiction but the statute\ncontemplates it may -- later -- later you may lose\nsubject matter jurisdiction and you can remand it there.\nAnd I suppose that that needs to be interpreted in pari\nmateria with (c) so that the remands would not be\nsubject to review. It seems to me the same situation\nhere. You have got allegedly subject matter\njurisdiction. It is later defeated, and it is remanded.\nWhy shouldn't that be covered by (c)?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: What, what's\nnotable is that Congress enacted 1447(e) at the same\ntime that it amended 1447(c). It provided in 1447(e)\nfor an authority to remand in a particular instance\nwhere the court lost subject matter jurisdiction\npost-removal. It had of course been the rule since this\nCourt's decision in St. Paul Mercury Indemnity, that\npost-removal events did not defeat the removal court's\njurisdiction; and in the statute it was made explicit\nthat 1447(c) authorized remand only when the case was\nremoved improvidently and without jurisdiction.\nAnd when Congress amended the language in\n1998 to make clear that non-jurisdictional defects in\nremoval had to be raised immediately or were forfeited,\nit at the same time -- and added the language, or\nchanged the language in the second sentence that raises\nproblems for our argument; at the same time, it added\n1447(e) to provide, as I said, a particular authority to\nremand based on post-removal events that would have been\nunnecessary if, as Respondents urge, 1447(c) was\nintended to confer general authority to remand on the\nbasis of post-removal events.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you don't have\nany doubt that a remand under 1447(e) would be covered\nby 1447(d), do you?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: No. And the courts\nof appeals that have considered that question likewise\nhold that a remand under 1447(e) is right in pari\nmateria with (d) although the courts seem to be split on\nwhether the decision to allow the joinder is a separable\ndecision appealable under Waco or not. But -- but that\nissue is not presented.\nBut what is significant is that had Congress\nintended by the amendment of 1447(c) to authorize for\nthe first time remand on the basis of post-removal\nevents, 1447(e) would have been unnecessary; and yet,\nthe legislative history, the 1447(e), makes clear that\nCongress believed that in the absence of that provision,\nthe Court would have been limited to two alternatives.\nAuthorize the joinder -- or deny the joinder, or dismiss\nthe case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How is that relevant here?\nWhere is the post-removal event?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: The post-removal\nevent here is the recognition of the defendant's\nsovereign immunity.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's not an event.\nThat's -- that's an epiphany, it's not an event.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, according --\nwell, apparently the district court viewed it as a\npost-removal event that deprived it, or defeated,\ndivested --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Very strange meaning of\nevent.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, I -- Your\nHonor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean the sovereign\nimmunity didn't exist from the outset. Nothing changed.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: But -- but the\ndistrict court's order is clear. And it is absolutely\ncorrect in this regard that removal jurisdiction existed\nat the outset. So the court does not lack removal\njurisdiction. The reference in 1447(c), second sentence\nto \"lacks subject matter jurisdiction,\" refers to lacks\nremoval jurisdiction. And in fact, this Court used that\nshorthand repeatedly in the Kircher decision to describe\n1447(c), lacks removal jurisdiction. This Court --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: When did it say that? I\nreally find it very hard to accept that argument, when\nits says -- you know -- it doesn't use lacks removal\njurisdiction, that's what it means. It is such an easy\nthing to say.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, the Court has\nto go back to the history of the statute, how it's\nevolved. Clearly pre-1998, authority to remand was only\nif it was removed without jurisdiction. And so the\nquestion is when Congress changed the language to lacks\nsubject matter jurisdiction, did it mean lacks removal\njurisdiction? Which it --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Under the -- under the\ndistrict court's view, would there have been original\njurisdiction against Powerex?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: No, it would not\nhave. Bit that's because of the peculiarities of the\ndifference between original jurisdiction under the FSIA,\nsection 1330(a), and removal jurisdiction under the\nFSIA. Whereas original jurisdiction depends upon a\nconclusion that the defendant is not immune, Congress\nconferred removal jurisdiction whenever a foreign\nsovereign is defended.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Then can you --\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Likewise in\n1442(a), which was about the Federal --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can, can you tell me, if\nthe Petitioner does not prevail here, the case goes back\nto the State court. Can the immunity argument be raised\nin the State court?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: The immunity\nargument could be raised in State court. That's what\nthis Court held in Kircher. But the defendant would be\nforever denied its right to a bench trial under Federal\nlaw. That right is limited to suits in the Federal\ncourts by its term; 1441(d) --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In other words the State\ncourt couldn't say well you know, this district court\nwas wrong; there's really immunity under the Federal\nstatute. The State court can't hold that?\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: The State --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Because then you'd have\nconstant -- eternal shuttling back and forth, that's\nwhy.\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: The State court\ncould reconsider Powerex's status as a foreign\nsovereign, but it wouldn't have many, if any,\nimplications in the State court because Powerex isn't\nclaiming immunity in this case. It's only invoking the\nprocedural benefits of the FSIA which include that the\ncase be litigated in the Federal court before a judge\nrather than a jury. And it would be forever denied the\nbenefits, those important procedural benefits of the\nstatute if this Court doesn't uphold review of the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, we don't know --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In other words, the -- the\nFederal determination bars the State court from\nredetermining that there's immunity? That the State\ncourt can't say, \"Federal court, you're wrong?\"\nMR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: The issue of\nimmunity of Powerex was never raised in this case. It\ncan review the question of whether it is an organ of the\nState it but it cannot review the remand determination\nthat Powerex can never be granted the procedures\nbenefits of Federal foreign order bench trial. Thanks,\nYour Honor.\nThe Court: Thank you, Counsel.\nMr. Simon.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONARD B. SIMON,\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS\nMR. SIMON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court.\nThere are two reasons, independent and\nsufficient reasons why there is in appellate\njurisdiction in this case. The first most narrow and\nsimple reason to vacate the decision below for lack of\njurisdiction, is to follow this Court's precedents which\naccept the district court's remand order for what it is\nand what it says it is, a remand for lack of subject\nmatter jurisdiction under 1447(c), unremovable under\n1447(d). That is a simple direct route to that result.\nThere is a second approach suggested by a\nlot of the briefing and some of the argument Your Honors\nhave heard this morning. And I want to lay it out\nbriefly for the Court.\nAnd it is that, as the law professor amici\nhave suggested, there is some amount of confusion in the\nlower courts, I might say with due respect, evasion of\n1447(d) in the lower courts, by judge-made exceptions to\n1447(d), created by some but not all of the courts of\nappeal.\nAnd the Court could clear out some of this\nunderbrush, mooting many of the issues that\nMr. Frederick and the that Solicitor General have\nraised. Thermtron after Carnegie Mellon, addressing the\nquestion Justice Kennedy raised in his concurring\nopinion, in Things Remembered versus Petrarca, Thermtron\ndoes not say what many of the lower courts think it\ndoes. Thermtron does not say what my adversaries say it\ndoes, because Thermtron has been partially overruled by\nCarnegie Mellon. The notion that the only proper remand\nis a 1447(c) remand is ancient history after Carnegie\nMellon, and therefore the notion that the only remand\ncovered by 1447(d) is a remand under 1447(c) is also\nancient history.\nCongress has given us a simple and strong\nmessage, which is when we're disputing the forum, when\nthe parties in a case are legitimately and in good faith\ndisputing forum, State court versus Federal court,\nCongress has said take one shot at it, let an Article\nIII judge determine whether the forum is State court or\nFederal court, and move on to the merits.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, what, what reason\nwould Congress have for wanting a system that says --\nand there are many, many, many people in the United\nStates who would like to sue Pakistan. They would like\nto sue China. They would like to sue Russia. There are\nall kinds of places they would like to sue. And why\nwould Congress want to have a system that says to those\ncountries, you can come into Federal court and get your\nclaim adjudicated, whether it is really you, China a;\nbut by the way, if the Federal judge makes a mistake,\nthere you are in Mississippi, Alabama, Illinois, any one\nof 50 different states? In front of juries, the very\nthing that we gave you this statute so you wouldn't have\nto do.\nNow what would their theory be?\nMR. SIMON: It --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can I, -- I'm not sure it\nis even that he made a mistake. It is even worse than\nthat. If he gets it right and finds that you are a\nsovereign --\nMR. SIMON: Let me try to answer it --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- you can go back to State\ncourt. I mean, that's even worse. He gets it right.\nMR. SIMON: Let me try to answer both\nquestions. The problem is whether he gets it right or\nwrong, we spend two years in a court of appeals. But\nYour Honor, you're assuming there's an immunity issue in\nthis case. With due respect, my adversaries are arguing\nsomeone else's case. There is no immunity claim in this\ncase by Powerex. There is one petition, one petitioner.\nJUSTICE BREYER: They were saying they were\nan organ of --\nMR. SIMON: They were saying they were an\norgan.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yeah, and therefore they\nare immune unless -- unless they fall within an\nexception. And it may be they do.\nIs that not right?\nMR. SIMON: No. They conceded that they\nfell within the exception.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I'm saying, that's\nhow the statute works.\nMR. SIMON: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But I take it if you win\nthis, it's precisely the same, in respect to a person\nwho has total immunity.\nMR. SIMON: No.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why not?\nMR. SIMON: I would disagree Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why not?\nMR. SIMON: A party who has total immunity\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yeah.\nMR. SIMON: Would have removed the case the\nsame way --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yeah. Yeah.\nMR. SIMON: And it would have presented two\narguments to the district court. It would have argued\nnumber one, we are a foreign sovereign; maybe it wins,\nmaybe it loses. And number two. We are immune.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. SIMON: There is a solid line of cases\nthat suggests the decision on immunity -- first of all\nlet me say, I think it is somewhat far-fetched that a\nparty that would actually be immune, say the King of\nSaudi Arabia, would end up being in this third lowest\ncategory of foreign -- purported foreign sovereigns and\nend up in the position Powerex is in.\nBut if it did, in other words we have three\ncategories. We have immunes, we have non-immunes who\ngot Federal court, and then we have would-be foreign\nsovereigns like Powerex, who end up in State court. And\nI'm suggesting for a party to fall from the first\ncategory to the third in front of an Article III\njudge --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And a Judge makes a big\nmistake --\nMR. SIMON: Makes a big mistake.\nJUSTICE BREYER: China comes in --\nMR. SIMON: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And says of course you're\nChina. And then it signs a remand order.\nMR. SIMON: I would submit, Your Honor, the\nquestion has never been addressed by this Court. The\nlower courts suggest that that is a collateral order.\nThe immunity issue, not the remand issue. We actually\nnow have a Waco type case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. Well, after all -- if\nyou're going to say, you say that one is reviewable on\nappeal.\nMR. SIMON: The immunity --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is it or not, in your view?\nMR. SIMON: In my view, the immunity issue,\nbut not the remand is reviewable on appeal --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Fine. And now all they\nwant here is the organ issue reviewed on appeal.\nMR. SIMON: Right. And the difference is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And what's the difference\nbetween the one and the other?\nMR. SIMON: The difference is that the\nimmunity issue is reviewed on appeal because there is a\nline of court of appeal cases -- a majority, not a\nunanimous majority, never blessed by this Court -- which\nsuggests that immunity is so important, don't need a\nlawyer, you don't go to court, you don't say a word, you\ndon't spend a dollar, you walk away -- so important that\nyou are entitled to an immediate --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay, and you agree with\nthat?\nMR. SIMON: And I agree with that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Fine. Then why is it in\nyour opinion that the immunity thing is so important\nthat they get this collateral appeal, but the organ\nthing is not so important since all, what turns on that\nis whether they're going to have their non-jury trial.\nMR. SIMON: Well, I want to come back\nnon-jury trial and answer Justice Ginsburg's question\nbecause I don't think she got the right answer. But the\nreason it's more important is this is, as Justice Scalia\nsaid, like a diversity decision, this is a litigation\nwho sells power in the Pacific Northwest and admits that\nit competes with Enron, Duke, and Reliance, and it is\ndisputing whether it belongs in a State court in San\nDiego or the Federal court across the street in San\nDiego, leaving aside the jury issue. And that is\nprecisely the kind of dispute that Congress suggested in\n1447(d) and its predecessors, which have been on the\nbooks for more than 100 years, ought to be done once.\nWhat do they say, one and done? Is that what they say\nin the district court?\nJUSTICE ALITO: You're saying this all turns\non our assessment of the strength of the interest in\nremaining in Federal court? Is that what it boils down\nto?\nMR. SIMON: No, it turns on the strength of\ngetting an immediate decision on the immunity question.\nThe immunity question I think is a question of an\nentirely different nature than the question of forum.\nIn the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The immunity question,\nthe immunity question is the same as State or Federal\ncourt, because the statute as it's written, any foreign\nsovereign, China, whatever, is as immune from State\ncourt jurisdiction as it is from Federal court\njurisdiction because Congress said so.\nBut with respect to the commercial\nenterprise, Congress said, we're going to give you a\nFederal court and we're going to give you a judge trial.\nThat doesn't apply to State courts.\nMR. SIMON: That's correct. But Congress\nsaid, we're going to give you a Federal forum and a\nbench tribal if you convince us that you are an agency\nor instrumentality of a foreign State. This, this\ncorporation Powerex failed to make that convincing\nshowing. Having failed to make that convincing slowing,\nagain, they are debating in the appellate courts and\ntying litigants up for two, five years over whether this\ncase should be litigated in State court or in Federal\ncourt.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There was a sovereign\nparty who said: I'm out of this; I have suit immunity.\nAnd that was the B.C. --\nMR. SIMON: B.C. Hydro.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What happened to B.C.\nHydro? Because as I understand the district court sent\nthat party back, too.\nMR. SIMON: The district court found that\nthey were immune, properly followed the law, but\ndetermined because it believed it had no subject matter\njurisdiction that it should then stop at that point,\nthat it should just walk away from the case and remand\nit, over the vehement disagreement of B.C. Hydro and the\nparallel vehement disagreement of the Bonneville Power\nAdministration. The Ninth Circuit when it erroneously\ntook the appeal on the remand also clarified or\nstraightened out that issue.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but it couldn't --\nif you are right, then the Ninth Circuit never should\nhave touched this case. So what happens to the three\nparties, two U.S. parties, one British Columbia, who are\nentitled to suit immunity?\nMR. SIMON: Well, what's happened so far is\nnothing, which might tell us that in the practical world\nwhen a Federal district judge says that B.C. Hydro is\nimmune and then remands a multi-plaintiff,\nmulti-defendant, multi-cross defendant-cross defendant\ncase to San Diego Superior Court, it is exceedingly that\nthe San Diego Superior Court will reconsider the\nimmunity. But if it did --\nJUSTICE ALITO: But could it?\nMR. SIMON: I suppose it could, but if it\ndid that matter is subject to appeal and subject to\nultimate certiorari review in this Court. So I think\nwe're talking about a frolic.\nJUSTICE ALITO: I thought the argument you\nwere making a few minutes ago, if I understood it\ncorrectly, was that B.C. Hydro would not have been\nbarred by 1447(d) from taking an appeal to contest the\nremand; is that correct or not.\nMR. SIMON: I think B.C. Hydro could have\ntaken a collateral order, a collateral order appeal.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Whether it's a collateral\norder or not just goes to whether it falls under 1291.\nIt doesn't speak at all to the issue of 1447.\nMR. SIMON: B.C. Hydro could have attempted\nto appeal the immunity decision under a series of\ndecisions which suggest that immunity is so important\nthat it ought to be decided right then.\nJUSTICE ALITO: The difference between that\nimmunity and Powerex's status is what? It's simply the\nfact that there's a stronger interest in allowing\nimmediate appellate review, Federal appellate review of\nthe determination of the remand of a party that claims\nto be a sovereign as opposed to Powerex's status as an\norgan?\nMR. SIMON: Among several other things.\nThere is a stronger interest in that, and we are not\ndebating about the forum. Again, we have the Kircher\ncase from last term saying State courts are perfectly\ncapable of resolving this issue. That is a quotation\nactually from the Missouri Pacific case.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If we think that Powerex,\nthat there's a strong interest in having Powerex remain\nin Federal court if it's entitled To that under the\nForeign Sovereign Immunities Act, that would be suffer\nto get around 1447(d)?\nMR. SIMON: I think Justice Scalia was\ncorrect to say there is just as strong an interest in a\ndiversity case in having a New York corporation trying\nto escape --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I'm having, I'm having\nthe same problem as Justice Scalia and Justice Breyer.\nCan you say in just a few sentences the difference\nbetween the case where there is sovereign immunity,\nChina, the China hypothetical, and this case where it's\norgan immunity?\nMR. SIMON: Yes, if I could --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You're telling us that one\nis more important than the other, but there's no textual\nbasis in the statute for us to make that distinction.\nMR. SIMON: I think there are two\ndifferences, so if I could. One is textual and one is\nimportant. Let me start with the textual difference.\nThe textual difference is that 1447(d) speaks to\nremands, and so to the extent the district court\nremanded the matter to State court the remand is\nuntouchable on appeal or by mandamus because of 1447(d).\nAnd if the foreign -- if the foreign relations body,\nlobby, doesn't like that, if the State Department\ndoesn't like, that they can go to the Capitol and get\nthat fixed quite easily.\nThere are half a dozen exceptions to 1447(d)\nfor class actions, for Native Americans, for civil\nrights cases, and they can get their own exceptions. So\nto the extent what the trial court did was remand, it is\nuntouchable. That is my textual answer. It's a remand,\ni.e. Waco, in which the court says the remand is\nuntouchable, the dismissal of the unnecessary or\nindispensable party is reviewable. So what I would say\nis, although the remand is untouchable, the denial of\nimmunity -- and that's why I kept saying collateral\norder; I apologize if that confused you, Justice Alito.\nI meant that line of cases about going\nstraight up even though the case was continuing. While\nthe case continues in State court, where it belongs\nunder 1447(d), it would appear under this line of\ncollateral order cases that the denial of immunity\nper se could go up on its own --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm asking why is denial\nof immunity for sovereign status different from denial\nof organ status giving you a right to a bench trial,\netcetera?\nMR. SIMON: Possibly, possibly this could\nwould decide that question the other way. But --\nJUSTICE BREYER: We have this very old judge\nlike me. China is there. And he says: This isn't\nChina; Formosa is China. So he says remand. So there\nwe are, China is now in the Western District State Court\nfor Illinois and they're suing them for a lot of money.\nNow, you said, I thought, before that where that\nhappened, and they wrongly ly denied immunity, they\ncould, China, appeal in the Federal system. I thought\nyou said that.\nMR. SIMON: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right.\nMR. SIMON: But not the remand.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What?\nMR. SIMON: But not the remand.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All they want is a\ndefinitive appeal that this is really China, all right.\nNow, can they do that, yes or no? You said yes.\nSo I thought Justice Kennedy's question was,\nif they can do that, why can't Powerex appeal in exactly\nthe same way on the question of whether they're an\norgan. What's the difference?\nMR. SIMON: The first difference is what I\nsaid in response to Your Honor's question was I think\nthey could do that under some cases from the courts of\nappeal. I know they can't appeal the remand because we\nhave an act of Congress which --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't care. I don't call\nthis an appeal of a remand. What this is, it is an\nAppeal of the determination precedent to remand that\nPowerex is not an organ.\nMR. SIMON: Well, Justice Breyer --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That would make them just\nas happy, I believe.\nMR. SIMON: Justice Breyer, think about a\nmulti-party case and maybe my answer will be clearer to\nyou. In a multi-party case my position is the remand\nstands, the case goes back to Missouri or Mississippi or\nwherever your hypothetical was, but at the same time, I\ndo believe that the potentially immune party, which is\nnot here in this courtroom today, the potentially immune\nparty, could seek to review of what is a dispositive\nruling.\nRemember, that's a dispositive ruling. They\nwin the case. That's very different than a venue\nruling.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Regardless of how they\nwould get up on it, assuming they could get up on the\nimmunity question, our series of questions is why do we\ndraw or why should we draw a distinction between\nimmunity and federal bench trial? And your answer is, I\ntake it, immunity is dispositive; Federal bench tribal\nis not?\nMR. SIMON: Immunity is dispositive and\nFederal bench trial is not -- and is no different from\nthe day to day decisions district courts make all the\ntime about the choice between a State court and a\nFederal court in the area of remands and removals.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Immunity, suit immunity,\nis you can't be sued anyplace, not in State court, not\nin Federal court; you can't be sued, period. But now it\nis admitted that you can be sued. That's not in dispute\nin this case, right?\nMR. SIMON: That's correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So the only question is\nwhere.\nMR. SIMON: And that is my core --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The question is if --\nMR. SIMON: Excuse me. That is my core\npoint, that Congress told us when the only question is\nwhere, we stop after one level and we move on to the\nmerits.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Can you help me with --\nMR. SIMON: I would like to answer your\nquestion about a jury, but I think I interrupted\nJustice Stevens.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I just want to be sure\nyour position. Assume that there is a remand that was\nimproper and cannot be appealed under your theory and\nthe Powerex argues all along, I was entitled to a\nFederal forum and a non-jury trial. And the State court\nsays no all the way up. Can they file a petition for\ncertiorari saying, we had a Federal right that was\ndenied us, not the remand but our entitlement to a bench\ntrial? Can they petition for certiorari at the end of\nthe State proceeding in your view.\nMR. SIMON: Other than the jury question, I\nthink the answer would be no because of 1447(d), because\nI think 1447(e) would suggest that that's an appeal of a\nremand. But again, you're asking questions that I\nbelieve have not been addressed by this Court or even\nlower courts.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'm just wondering what\nyour position is.\nMR. SIMON: A clever enough lawyer I suppose\ncould argue that at that point that we're no longer\nchallenging the remand, the remand has happened and been\ncompleted and the trial has taken place; we're now\nsimply challenging the results. And maybe that clever\nlawyer would win the day.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And in effect he would say\n-- I mean, I assume what the clever lawyer would say is,\nState court, cannot try me at all. The feds can do what\nthey want about remand and it gets back here. But\nbecause I'm entitled to a bench trial, you cannot try me\nat all. Isn't that the argument?\nMR. SIMON: Oh, I think in State court a\nclever litigant could argue all these points over again,\nbecause 1447(e) --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But his clever opponent\nwould say --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that what 1447(d) means\nis that you can be tried in State courts. That's\nprecisely what it says.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And ultimately when the two\nclever parties got to the State supreme court, they\nwould have these two opposing issues and ultimately if\nwe granted cert this Court would decide it, wouldn't it.\nMR. SIMON: This Court would ultimately\ndecide it and they would ultimately decide questions\nsuch as whether the jury or, to put it the other, the\nbench trial issue has been preserved.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why not say, depending on\nthe clever lawyers, or non-clever as the case may be,\nwhy not just say Congress intended that you do get an\nunderlying appeal in the Federal system, for what is at\nstake is not simply where the case will be tried, but\nrather significant and important rights attach in the\nFederal court that do not attach in the State court.\nAnd therefore, it is right, the appeal you get when\nthey -- when what is at stake is immune or not, and by\ndoing that we avoid four more years of litigation and\nthe necessity to hire clever lawyers.\nMR. SIMON: Well, Congress has said --\nCongress has said the contrary. And there are often\nimportant differences between State and Federal courts.\nJustice Breyer, I think you have some experience in\nCalifornia. We have 9 to 3 jury verdicts. You will\nhave a litigant here next year saying that the\ndifference between a removal and a remand is a unanimous\njury verdict or a 9 to 3 jury verdict, and that's really\nimportant.\nNow, I would just briefly like to go back to\nJustice Ginsburg's question about a jury because I don't\nthink she got the full answer. Let me give it to you,\nJustice Ginsburg. The jury issue is virtually -- I\nwould say not virtually. The jury issue is out of this\ncase based on my adversary's reply brief. I will tell\nwhy you. We did ask for a jury trial in our case and we\nwere upset about the whole notion of this case being\nremoved on a cross-claim we were not involved in -- we\nnever sued Powerex -- losing our right to a jury trial\non this important case.\nMr. Frederick's reply brief says at footnote\n4, page 3 -- or footnote 3, page 4; I apologize -- that\nour right to jury trial is not threatened here and that\nunder certain lower court decisions, which he is correct\nthey do exist -- I'm not sure they're unanimous -- Our\nright to jury trial would survive even though he would\nhave a right to a bench trial under his theory.\nWell, there is no right to a jury trial on\nthe cross claim against Mr. Frederick's client. The\ncross claim in the California court, which got this\nwhole ball of wax rolling, is a cross claim for\nequitable indemnification and declaratory relief,\nequitable claims as to which there is no right to a jury\ntrial. So I think we are all now in agreement on a jury\ntrial. We are arguing someone else's case. Some day a\nlitigant will appear in this Court and present the issue\nof jury trial --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But they raise that there\nis still the question of Federal forum over State forum.\nMR. SIMON: There is, and that's the issue\nthat I think Congress has clearly and definitively said,\nthe State courts have pretty good judges, pretty good\njuries, pretty good systems and certiorari procedures to\nthis Court. In Kircher, the Court's opinion says, \"the\nState courts are perfectly competent to resolve these\nissues.\"\nThe cost of this case being frozen for 3 or\n4 years while we debated these issues -- and these\nissues are very difficult. I would say, we don't only\nhave a backup position, we have a backup backup\nposition. Because we think, number one, the court\nshould be taken at its word. We think, number two, the\ncourt had no subject matter jurisdiction. Removing\njurisdiction is not subject matter jurisdiction. If you\nlook at the book, Chapter 89, Section 1441, et cetera,\nit's titled Removal of Cases From State Courts. You\nwon't find the word \"subject matter jurisdiction\" in\nthere anywhere.\nA removal petition removes a case from the\nState court to the Federal court, where if it's a\nforeign sovereign immunities case, the Federal court\ndecides if it has subject matter jurisdiction. That's\nwhat 1330 says in haec verba. It's what this Court's\ndecision in Verlinden versus Central Bank of Nigeria\nsays in haec verba. Verlinden says every court that\ngets a foreign sovereign immunities case must determine\nat the outset whether it has subject matter jurisdiction\nby determining if the foreign sovereign is immune.\nWhich means that Judge Whaley was correct\nwhen he decided that by concluding he had an immune\nparty in front of him, he had no jurisdiction. And it\nwas equally correct for Bonneville, when he determined\nthat United States versus Myers says the same thing, so\nthat he had no subject matter jurisdiction. And in\naddition, there was a derivative jurisdiction doctrine.\nThis notion of \"removal jurisdiction\" quote\nunquote, it's a term we all use. The Court used it in\nKircher. I use it. Other people use it. But if you\nstart getting serious about your words, it's meaningless\nin this context. We have subject matter jurisdiction\nand it is conferred in the area of 1330, 1331, 1332. It\nis not conferred in 1441, 1442, or 1443. It's simply\nnot there.\nSo my backup argument is, he was right on\nevery point. And my backup argument beyond that is\nagain, please, reread Carnegie Mellon. Put it next to\nThermtron and look at what the lower courts have done.\nThey have found excuse after excuse to take appeals in\ncases that have no business being in the courts of\nappeals. They don't have immunity issues. They don't\nhave foreign sovereign issues. They don't have\nanything.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, the reason why they\nmay have done that is because they've seen case after\ncase where absolute power corrupts absolutely. And\nbecause district judges know that remand orders are not\nreviewable, on occasion they will remand cases for\nreasons that are clearly improper. That may be the\nreason.\nNow on your first argument, you say that\nwhat the district judge says is dispositive. You mean\nif the district judge says I lack subject matter\njurisdiction because my docket is crowded, that's not --\nMR. SIMON: No.\nJUSTICE ALITO: That's not --\nMR. SIMON: No, Your Honor. I overstated.\nLet me say it more clearly. Kircher, decided last term,\nmakes clear the line between what can and can't be done.\nIt discusses precisely this point and it refers to the\nRyan versus Contra case and it refers to the Principi\ncase. And it says that when the court is patently wrong\nabout whether the issue it is discussing is subject\nmatter jurisdiction, then this Court may enter into --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, it's a good\nthing you've got a lot of fallback arguments because you\nfall back very quickly. I would have thought your\nanswer to Justice Alito would be, the statute says if\nit's remanded, it's not reviewable on appeal or\notherwise. And if it's remanded for a silly reason,\nthat will be corrected on review of the State supreme\ncourt by this Court.\nMR. SIMON: That would be my first answer,\nand the Chief Justice said it much better than mine,\nthan I have. But I think, Your Honor, looking at\nKircher, to be fair, looking at Kircher, I believe that\nis the position Justice Scalia took, it is concurring\nopinion. And I didn't want to suggest that\nJustice Scalia's concurring opinion was the opinion of\nthe Court. The opinion of the Court wrestles with what\nI thought was Justice Alito's question. What do you do\nif the trial judge says he has no subject matter\njurisdiction and he has not simply made a garden variety\njurisdictional error but he has missed what the issue\nis? It's really failure to state a claim. It's really\nsomething else. And we of course have the Steele case\nwhich says jurisdiction has many meanings and we often\nget confused about them. And the Court answered the\nquestion by saying, only when the trial court is\npatently wrong, patently wrong not about the\njurisdictional question but as to whether it is even a\njurisdictional question, only when the court is patently\nwrong do we second guess the court.\nSo --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That certainly\nchanges the argument. So the notice of appeal that's\nfiled or the brief on appeal says not only was the court\nwrong, it was patently wrong, and the court of appeals\nhas to consider that before determining whether it has\njurisdiction to review the remand order.\nMR. SIMON: If the court wants to adopt\nJustice Scalia's view in the prior case, in the Kircher\ncase, my clients would be pleased with the results --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I recommend that.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SIMON: But I think, Justice Roberts --\nI think, Mr. Chief Justice -- I apologize. Because my\ntime is running short, I would say the key point in this\ncase came when we sought to have a prompt dismissal in\nthe Ninth Circuit of the appeal prior to full briefing\nand argument, and it was denied. That was the point at\nwhich if a litigant simply parroted the phrase \"this is\npatently wrong,\" would likely in most circuits before\nmost panels have lost. And this matter would have gone\nback to the State court 2-1/2 years before it got\naffirmed by the Ninth Circuit and five years before\ntoday.\nUnless the Court has any further questions,\nI think I've completed my comments.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Simon.\nMr. Frederick, you have three minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. FREDERICK: Mr. Chief Justice, a\nnon-jury trial is an aspect of sovereign immunity. This\nCourt's cases have recognized that. In footnote 6 of\nthe Government's brief, the Government cites the Lehman\ncase which makes this point clear and argues that the\npoint should be applicable to sovereigns in the context\nin which we are faced here.\nThe question of whether a foreign entity,\nand it's more complicated often in the real world,\nJustice Breyer, as your question's identified not simply\nwith questions but with the kinds of entities that\nforeign governments create to advance public purposes.\nThe intent of Congress was not to have those kinds of\nentities tested in State court to determine whether or\nnot they enjoyed the privileges and procedural\nprotections of the FSIA. And it is not simply a\nquestion of whether or not an elderly judge might choose\nto recognize China or Formosa, but rather the kinds of\ninstrumentalities that were created by those governments\nto advance public purposes, to serve as separate\npolitical entities, and who would be performing the\nkinds of acts that might lead them into litigation, and\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And Congress said, those\nentities don't get any immunity, they get two things:\nThey get a federal forum and they get a judge trial.\nThat's all that's at stake.\nMR. FREDERICK: That's not all that's at\nstake, Justice Ginsburg. There are also rights with\nrespect to foreign states to be free of punitive\ndamages. There are rights to have certain property of\nthe sovereign that would be subject to different\nattachment rules.\nThe FSIA has a whole string of procedural\nprotections that are afforded to foreign states and\ntheir instrumentalities. And this case ultimately is\nabout the fact that Powerex is being subjected to\nmultiple suits in State court, but as a result of the\nNinth Circuit's holding in --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Are those -- have they\nbeen sued by the plaintiffs in any of these cases or\nhave they always been brought in by defendants?\nMR. FREDERICK: They have been directly sued\nby the People of the State of California whom my brother\nhere represents. They have been sued by the California\nAttorney General. They have been sued by the California\nDepartment of Water Resources. And under the Ninth\nCircuit's precedent in this case which I urge you to\noverturn, Powerex has been remanded to State court, has\nnot been permitted to appeal the remand order, and is\nstuck in State court in these cases without any\nopportunity to test what is a clearly erroneous, and\nwhat my brother doesn't make any attempt to defend, the\nmerits of the decision, that Powerex has performed\npublic functions, it's serving at the direction of the\nGovernment of British Columbia, and is performing these\nfunctions to advance clearly public purposes.\nAnd yet, we are now in this Kafkaesque work\nworld between State and Federal court where if we try to\nlitigate all the way up through State court, it is not\nentirely clear whether we will ever have our organ --\nour status as a foreign organ ever vindicated. Thank\nyou.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
