TODD\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. TODD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nThe rule this Court announced in Ring did not\nchange what is to be decided. It only changed who\ndecides. It did not make any conduct -- it did not\ndecriminalize any conduct, nor did it make any defendant\nineligible for the death penalty.\nWe agree with all the State and Federal\nappellate courts that have looked to determine whether\nApprendi or Ring should apply retroactively and concluded\nthat the Apprendi/Ring rule is not the sort of ground\nbreaking rule that overcomes this Court's Teague bar.\nQUESTION: Mr. Todd, could we go back to what\nyou opened with, that you said this is just a -- and you\nemphasized this throughout your brief -- it's only a who\ndecides, not what. But I thought that the notion in Ring\nis that it adds elements to the offense that were not\nthere before. So now you have aggravating factors is an\nelement of the offense, and by so characterizing it, other\nthings happen. It has to be proved beyond a reasonable\ndoubt on the aggravating or the other aggravating factors.\nYou would have whatever you have to prove elements; that\nis, you -- the confrontation clause would apply,\neverything that goes with making it as part of the\nsubstantive crime. Is that not so?\nIt's not just a question of, well, before it was\nthe judge and now it's the jury. Because it's part of the\nsubstantive crime, other things go along with it too,\ndon't -- don't they?\nMR. TODD: Justice Ginsburg, my understanding of\nthis Court's holding in Ring was that it applied the Sixth\nAmendment jury guarantee as -- as this Court recalls,\nArizona already found, beyond a reasonable doubt, this -\nthese particular aggravators and that it applied it to -\nfor purposes of finding these -- these aggravators. It -\nit didn't change the substantive reach of the statute.\nThose -\nQUESTION: Well, let me give you a concrete\nexample. The judge relied on the presentence report in -\nin this case. If the -- if it had to be found by the\njury, if the aggravating factor had to be found by a jury\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, would that presentence report\nhave been admissible?\nMR. TODD: Well, Your Honor, the judge in this\nparticular case did not rely on a presentence report to\nfind either of the aggravating circumstances that he\nfound. He relied on the trial testimony to find the --\nthat the crime was -\nQUESTION: Well, just let's say that the judge\ncould consider, or would you concede that if the judge\ncould make this determination, that the judge could, and\njudges routinely do, look at presentence reports?\nMR. TODD: Not under Arizona law, Your Honor,\nthat the -- the aggravating circumstances that are -- that\nare present in Arizona law are not the type that would be\n-- you could rely on a presentence report to find because\nArizona law doesn't permit hearsay evidence to establish\nthe aggravator.\nBut the -- the key question -- I mean, the key\nfact is that the underlying conduct, the -- has not\nchanged at all, that the aggravators are the same today as\nthey were before Ring. The -- it has the conduct -- the\nreach of the statute hasn't changed. All we're talking\nabout is applying the Sixth Amendment guarantee to these\naggravators that the Arizona put into their sentencing\nstatute as a result from this Court's opinion in Furman.\nQUESTION: Was it clear under prior law that the\naggravators had to be found by the judge beyond a\nreasonable doubt?\nMR. TODD: That's correct, Your Honor. Yes,\nJustice Kennedy.\nQUESTION: Was that in the statute or the\nsupreme court decision?\nMR. TODD: Supreme court decision.\nQUESTION: Thank you.\nQUESTION: It's sort of like a mixed case on the\nsubstantive procedural part. It's -- the argument that\nit's substantive, which is -- imagine you have a statute\nthat says if you use a gun in connection with a drug sale,\nit's a crime. All right? And then this Court says that\ndoesn't mean the drug in the -- the gun is in the attic.\nyou know, the gun is in the attic -- that doesn't count.\nThat's clearly substantive, isn't it?\nMR. TODD: Yes, Justice Breyer.\nQUESTION: All right. Now, suppose they have a\nsubpart (b) which said if the gun is in the attic, you get\nmore, but the gun in the attic will be found by the judge.\nThat's just as if those words, gun in the attic, weren't\nthere. So it's just like the first statute, and that's\nApprendi, you see. That's Apprendi.\nAnd you say, well, if you got that second\nstatute that looked just like the first, this one does\ntoo. I mean, that's the argument. And you say, well,\nwhich way should we look at it. I'm not sure.\nMR. TODD: Well, Your Honor, I -- I think that\nthe -- that this Court's discussion in Bousley or Bousley\n-- as -- as you were indicating based on the Bailey\ndecision, sort of capsulizes where -- what -- what in\nterms of retroactivity analysis, where substantive -- what\n-- what a real substantive change is.\nQUESTION: We -- didn't we make it quite clear\nin Bousley that it was important that we were interpreting\na Federal law, which we had the authority to interpret,\nrather than what's happened in this case where, as I\nunderstand it, the Supreme Court of Arizona has said the\nchange brought by Ring was procedural.\nMR. TODD: That's -- that's correct, Mr. Chief\nJustice.\nThe -- this Court does not construe State\nstatutes. State courts do that, and it's our position\nthat in order to change the substance of a crime, this is\nsomething either that the legislative body must do or that\nthe State court, in the case of a State -\nQUESTION: Does it follow, if it is procedural,\nthat you necessarily prevail? If -- you -- you do agree\nthat he has been sentenced to death by an unconstitutional\nprocedure.\nMR. TODD: This Court has said that it was, yes.\nQUESTION: Yes, I mean, under our holdings.\nAnd do you know any case in which we've held\nthat a death sentence can be carried out when it was\nimposed pursuant to an unconstitutional procedure?\nMR. TODD: I -- if I read your cases correct,\nJustice Stevens, I believe that you have decided three\ncases since Teague in which you have found that the -\nthere was a problem, unconstitutional problem, with a jury\nsentencing procedure in a capital case and you have found\nthat those cases are Teague barred.\nQUESTION: But the -- the -- what was barred was\nconsidering whether or not there was a constitutional\nviolation. We didn't actually hold that where it was\nacknowledged there was a constitutional violation, that\nthe death sentence could be carried out. Or am I wrong on\nthat?\nMR. TODD: My recollection, Justice Stevens, is\nthat in each of those cases there had been a prior holding\nby this Court finding some unconstitutional procedure and\nthat the case was in these three cases that procedure\nexisted, only they had -- they were on collateral review\nand this Court found them Teague barred.\nQUESTION: I see.\nMR. TODD: In our opinion, the only way that Mr.\nSummerlin can avoid this Court's Teague bar is if somehow\nhe can find that the Apprendi/Ring rule fits within the\nexception for watershed changes in the rule. And as this\nCourt recalls, in order to do that, the Ring/Apprendi rule\nmust meet two tests. It must satisfy two tests. The\nfirst test is it must enhance the accuracy. The second\ntest is it must alter this Court's understanding of some\nbedrock principle.\nNow, as to the -- the first test, we would\nsuggest that this Court's line of cases from 1968 answer\nthe first question in the negative. That is, that the\nSixth Amendment jury guarantee and cases arising out of\nthat are not to be applied retroactively. As you -- as\nyou recall in Duncan v. Louisiana in 1968, this Court for\nthe first time held that the Sixth Amendment jury\nguarantee should be applied to the States. And in that\nvery case -- in that very case, this Court said that judge\ntrials are not inherently unfair. Then a month later in\nDeStefano v. Woods, this Court decided and held that this\nright, this very right to have a jury trial, would not be\napplied retroactively. And then in a series of cases\nafter that, this Court -- that in cases where the -- the\nright arose out of the jury guarantee -- this case -- the\nCourt did not apply those cases retroactively. At the\ntime when the military was -- had a right to a jury for a\ncivil offense that the person committed, this Court held\nthat that would not be applied retroactively.\nQUESTION: May I interrupt you just once more?\nBecause I'm most interested in the capital cases. Am I\ncorrect in remembering that after Furman, all of the death\nsentences across the country were held invalid\nretroactively?\nMR. TODD: Well, Your Honor, the -- I can't\nspeak to -- to all the cases. In Arizona what -- what\nhappened was that the -- after Furman, that sentencing,\nthe jury verdict in all the death penalties were\nunconstitutional. And the -- the Arizona Supreme Court\nsimply applied Arizona law and said the sentence was\nexcessive and, therefore -- because it was\nunconstitutional, and therefore, imposed life sentence. I\ndon't -- I was unable to find any case that really briefed\nor discussed the whole question of retroactivity or\nwhether you could -\nQUESTION: Well, you wouldn't -- you wouldn't\ncontest that Furman was a watershed decision, would you?\nMR. TODD: No, I would not.\nQUESTION: So, I mean, the question is whether\nthis -- whether Ring is equivalent to Furman as far as\nwatershed decisions go I guess.\nMR. TODD: Of course, Justice Scalia, our\nposition is that it is not. It's far from it.\nBut the -- all these cases that the cross\nsection -- right to have a cross section of the community\nrepresented on a jury -- that was not applied\nretroactively.\nQUESTION: Let me just ask you why is Furman a\nwatershed decision? It just said the procedures were all\nwrong. What -- what made that watershed and -- and this\nnot watershed?\nMR. TODD: Because Furman affected all death\npenalty cases nationwide.\nQUESTION: Because it was applied retroactively.\nMR. TODD: And -- and it --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. TODD: It -- and it was a complete -\nQUESTION: And I suppose if this case is applied\nretroactive, this might be a watershed decision.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Was Furman decided before Teague?\nMR. TODD: Furman, Justice O'Connor, was decided\nbefore Teague. And -- and also in Furman, there was a\nmajor shift in this Court's thinking and understanding of\nthe meaning of the Eighth Amendment.\nQUESTION: Yes, which -- an understanding which\n-- which had existed in the country for a couple of\nhundred years, whereas, as I understand Ring, it's based\non a reversal of -- of a relatively recent practice of\nannouncing in statutes sentencing factors as opposed to\nelements of the crime. That -- that was a quite recent\npractice and it seems to me quite reasonable to think that\nFurman was a watershed and that -- that Ring and -- and\nApprendi, which preceded Ring, was not. It was just a\ncorrection of a temporary wandering off from the -- from\nthe common law rule.\nMR. TODD: We would agree, Justice Scalia.\nQUESTION: You would agree that Apprendi just\ncorrected a -- a minor wandering law, not an old rule?\nQUESTION: There's a question whether it\ncorrected anything.\nMR. TODD: At -- at most -- at most, Apprendi\nmerely extended in an incremental degree an existing\nproposition of this Court.\nQUESTION: Apprendi purported, did it not, to be\nsetting forth established law? Did it not?\nMR. TODD: I --\nQUESTION: And -- right?\nMR. TODD: Yes.\nQUESTION: And did Furman?\nMR. TODD: No. It was a -- a complete change is\nmy understanding.\nQUESTION: There was no -- there was no Court\nopinion in Furman, was there?\nMR. TODD: No, there was no opinion by the full\nCourt where every -- all the members agreed or a majority\nof the members agreed.\nQUESTION: What will you do if -- I mean, I\nabsolutely accept your point, at least for argument, that\n-- that if you go through the factors that favor calling\nit a watershed rule, you've listed several that argue\nstrongly against calling it a watershed rule.\nAnd I want your reaction to something on the\nother side. And I have to say, though, I'm sure he -- he\nwill agree with these words. Justice Scalia will not\nagree with the sentiment I'm quoting him for. But in Ring\nhe said -- he spoke about the repeated spectacle of a\nman's going to his death because a judge found an\naggravating factor existed and added that we cannot\npreserve our veneration for the protection of the jury in\ncriminal cases if we render ourselves callous to the need\nfor that protection by regularly imposing the death\npenalty without it.\nNow, what I'm using those words to call to mind\nis that here we will have the spectacle of a person going\nto his death when he was tried in violation of a rule that\nthe majority of the Court found to be a serious procedural\nflaw. See, I'm not calling it absolutely overwhelming.\nSo I'm giving you that, but on the other side, I'm trying\nto focus your attention on the spectacle of the man going\nto his death, having been sentenced in violation of that\nprinciple. What do you want to say about that?\nMR. TODD: Your Honor, in our view Teague\nanswers that question, that if the Apprendi/Ring rule\nwould come within the Teague exception, then certainly in\nfairness, it should be applied retroactively.\nQUESTION: Justice Breyer is -- is arguing for a\n-- a general capital sentencing exception to Teague. I\nmean, you -- you could make that statement that he just\nmade in any capital case.\nQUESTION: No, but -- but anyway --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: -- the -- the -- Teague, of course,\nencapsulates a long prior history with Justice Harlan\ntrying to formalize to a degree rules that will separate\nthe more important for the less important. Is that fair?\nMR. TODD: Yes, absolutely, Your Honor. And our\nposition is that this case, because of -- it doesn't\nincrease the accuracy, the -- the Teague/Apprendi rule,\nand it does not -- is not even a bedrock rule, not even a\nbedrock rule, let alone a -- a change in this Court's\nunderstanding of a bedrock rule.\nQUESTION: Where as, is Teague itself a bedrock\nrule? It was judge-made rule, isn't it? It's not in the\nConstitution itself or any statute anywhere. It's a\njudge-made rule.\nMR. TODD: Teague -\nQUESTION: And that should trump the\nconstitutional right at stake.\nMR. TODD: Teague is a judge -- judge-made rule,\nYour Honor, yes.\nIf I may reserve the remainder of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Todd.\nMr. Feldman, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. FELDMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nWith respect to the bedrock principles -- that\nis -- that is, the bedrock watershed rules that come\nwithin the second Teague exception -- the Court has\narticulated that exception not in terms of any rule that\ncarries out a principle of the Constitution, even an\nimportant rule that carries out a principle of the\nConstitution, or one of the amendments that have been\nincorporated, but rather a bedrock rule.\nAnd the examples that the Court has given, which\nare things like the violation of the rule of Gideon\nagainst Wainwright or a mob dominating a trial or the\nknowing use of testimony that was -- of a -- of a\nconfession that was extracted by torture I think give\nguidance as to what that sort of bedrock rule is. And\nwhat it is, is those are elements that, if they exist in a\ncriminal trial, you can look at that trial and say this\nwas not -- could not have been a fair trial. In fact, the\ntrial conceivably could have come to the right result, but\nit couldn't have been a fair trial if those elements were\nnot satisfied.\nThe rule in Ring and Apprendi does not come\nwithin that class.\nQUESTION: Mr. Feldman, what would you think the\nresult should be for someone whose capital conviction and\nsentence became final after Apprendi but before Ring?\nMR. FELDMAN: I -- I think that -- that was a\nrelatively brief period, but during that period, this\nCourt's decision in Walton had held that judges could\ndecide aggravating factors. And accordingly, the law at\nthat time was that and it would have to satisfy the Teague\nsecond exception if it were to be applied. For the\nreasons I've said, I don't think it does.\nThe Court -\nQUESTION: Let me ask you something else. I\ndon't think you cited or relied on that DeStefano v. Woods\ncase. Why not?\nMR. FELDMAN: We should have. The Court said in\n-- in the -- in the Duncan case -- actually the quote is\nwe would not assert that every criminal trial or any\nparticular trial held before a judge alone is unfair or\nthat a defendant may never be as fairly treated by a judge\nas he would be by a jury. That's a quote from Duncan.\nIn DeStefano, which was a pre-Teague case and I\nsuppose maybe that was the reason why it was overlooked,\nbut the Court relied on that particular reasoning in\nholding that the Duncan rule, which was the whole Sixth\nAmendment right, should not be retroactively applied.\nThe rule in Apprendi and Ring doesn't apply to\nthe whole Sixth Amendment right. It was long accepted\nbefore Apprendi and Ring that any element that the\nlegislature identifies as an element of the offense has to\nbe proven to the jury. The question in these cases was\nthings that the legislature had -- was at the margins,\nthings that the legislature had set forth not as an\nelement of the offense, but as a sentencing factor that\nonly goes to sentencing. And what those cases did is\ndivide up the -- the universe of things that just go to\nsentencing and say some of them have to be submitted to\nthe jury and others don't.\nThose kinds of line-drawing decisions are not\nthe kinds of things that are -- that you can look at the\nsubmission of that particular fact to a judge rather than\na jury and say this proceeding couldn't have been a fair\none. In fact, judges make -- the Court has recognized\nthat judges make similar types of decisions both\nprocedurally in terms of the admission of evidence, in\nterms of the application of the Fourth Amendment, and even\nsubstantively, in fact, even in the capital context, in\ndeciding the presence of mitigating factors, in deciding\nfacts that may be of -- of crucial importance in weighing\nthe weight of mitigating against aggravating factors. All\nof those things judges may permissibly do and may do so\nfairly.\nGiven that those things can be decided by a\njudge fairly, I don't think that it can be said that the\nrule in Apprendi and in Ring reaches that level of bedrock\nimportance, that it just is -- is -- necessarily the whole\nproceeding was unfair because this element was -\nQUESTION: Can we go back to the -- the first\nand how you characterize this? I would imagine you list\nelements of an offense. Well, the elements of an offense\n-- that has a substantive feel. Who decides has a\nprocedural feel. It seems to me you could give this a\nsubstantive characterization if you're saying recite the\nelements of -- of an offense. That sounds very\nsubstantive. What does it take to -- to compose this\ncrime. And then -- well, and then you say it -- well,\nit's just who decides. That's a procedural question. You\ncan characterize this fairly either way I think.\nMR. FELDMAN: I -- I don't think so. I think\nfor the -- for purposes of Teague, the best definition of\nsubstantive offense -- of what is substantive is what\nsubstantive is what -- what has been made criminal and -\nand perhaps what facts -- on what facts turns a particular\npunishment. The definition of those facts is a\nsubstantive point. And the reason for that is that in\nBousley, what the Court said was a -- a longstanding\nconcern of Federal habeas is that someone is going to\nstand convicted of an offense based on conduct that the\nlaw does not make criminal or does not subject to the\npunishment that he's going to get.\nNow, when a court comes to a new understanding\nof an element of -- of what the meaning, the substantive\nmeaning, of an element of an offense, what conduct is or\nisn't criminal or can or cannot be subject to a particular\npunishment, there is a risk that -- that the defendant,\nwho was tried under a different standard, does stand\nconvicted of committing an act that the law didn't make\ncriminal. And that's why substantive rules don't come\nwithin Teague.\nBut where -- what happened here is not at all\ntimes, both before and after Ring, the -- in Arizona the\nlist of aggravating circumstances was the same. They\nmeant exactly the same thing. And that risk that the\nCourt talked about in Bousley of standing convicted of an\nact based on a finding that you committed an act that in\nfact is not criminal or couldn't be subject to the death\npenalty, that risk was not raised by this decision in\nRing.\nQUESTION: Mr. Feldman, do you think that the\noutcome of this case necessarily determines whether\nApprendi is retroactive or not?\nMR. FELDMAN: I -- I would think they stand or\nfall together because the Court in Ring -\nQUESTION: Do you think if we hold this is bad,\nwe must follow the same rule in Apprendi?\nMR. FELDMAN: Well, I'd prefer not to be\ncategorical about that. I -- I mean, if the Court reached\nthat conclusion, I'd want to see what the reasoning was\nthat the Court used and see whether there are distinctions\nor aren't distinctions at that point.\nBut the Court --\nQUESTION: But if we -- if we said, for example,\nthat this is -- this is retroactive because we, in effect,\nhave said that the sentencing factor is -- is like an\nelement so that we are, in fact, for purposes of -- of\nserving the jury right, recharacterizing or redefining the\n-- the crime, then that would cover Apprendi as well as\nthis case, wouldn't it?\nMR. FELDMAN: It -- it may well. It may well.\nBut I don't think the Court should reach that\nresult for the reasons I just said, which is as a matter\nof substance and procedure, I think you can -- if the\nquestion is, is this an element or is it a sentencing\nfactor, but in both cases it's something that the\nlegislature intended to set aside as this is something\nthat's going to trigger a particular penalty, in this case\nthe eligibility for the death penalty, either way I don't\nthink that's a substantive decision.\nIf the question is, as it was in Bousley or in\nthe -- the Bailey case, well, is mere possession of a gun\na criminal act or do you have -- or is something else, is\nit something narrower than that, it has to be active use\nof the gun, that is a substantive decision because there\nare defendants who might have been found to have just\npossessed the gun and -- and therefore not to be guilty of\nany crime at all. And that does tie into a core purpose\nof habeas as -- as the Court articulated in the Bousley\ncase.\nThe Court has said in -- said in Tyler -- to\nreturn to the -- the bedrock, the second Teague exception,\nthe Court said in Tyler and -- v. Cain, that not all rules\nrelating to due process, not even all new rules relating\nto the fundamental requirements of due process, will\nsatisfy the second Teague exception. That exception is a\nnarrow one because States have very vital interests in the\nfinality of criminal convictions and in coming to closure\nafter there's been a criminal conviction based on a good\nfaith interpretation and reasonable interpretation of\nexisting law, that not having to constantly reopen\ncriminal convictions as the law naturally develops, as it\ndoes with respect to the jury trial right or any of the\nother rights that have been incorporated.\nApplying that standard, the -- the decision in\nRing and the decision in -- in Apprendi also, shouldn't be\napplied -- don't come within the Teague second exception\nbecause it cannot be said in those circumstances that the\n-- that the trial, in violation of those rules, was\nnecessarily -- couldn't have been a fair trial.\nIf there are no questions from the Court -\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Feldman.\nMr. Murray, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF KEN MURRAY\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. MURRAY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI'd like to first go right to the heart of the\nissue of the questions that were between Justice Breyer\nand Justice Scalia and point out that we are not, in fact,\nasking for an exception in death penalty cases of Teague,\nbut we are asking the Court to look at the specific issues\ninvolved in capital cases and how the Teague exception\nthat -- that implicates accuracy and fairness is applied\nin those contexts.\nAnd this Court has done that before in Stringer\nv. Black, the only case that we are aware of where you\nwere looking at jury instructions to see whether they're\nold and new. The -- the criteria and the specific unique\naspects of the death penalty and the aggravating\ncircumstances that you were looking at, such as the\nheinous, cruel, and depraved one that's in this case, were\nof a particular importance in determining whether the\nissue was new or old.\nQUESTION: Did the court of appeals rely on the\nfact that there was a -- this was a death case as part of\nits reasoning?\nMR. MURRAY: It did in many respects, Your\nHonor.\nQUESTION: You mean it said in so many words?\nMR. MURRAY: Well, it -- it pointed out the fact\nof the necessity of having evidence presented in a manner\nthat would go to accuracy in a capital case, especially\none was -- you know, if somebody was looking at the death\npenalty, and there was a concurrence that specifically\nwent into the fact that this was a capital case.\nIt's important to note if -- if we're going to\nthe first in the Teague exception that implicates accuracy\nand -- and fairness, it's important to note that at the\nheart of the Sixth Amendment, we have the right to have\nall the facts necessary for a sentencing decision to be\nmade by a jury. And it's even more essential in capital\ncases. In death penalty cases, juries really do make a\ndifference.\nQUESTION: Well, isn't -- isn't that because a\nlot of the sentencing -- a lot of the aggravating factors\nthe sentencing pivots are -- are not only factual but\nnormative? I mean, heinous, atrocious, and cruel is -- is\nthe -- is a perfect example of it. It's -- it's a how -\nhow bad is it kind of determination.\nThis isn't so much a matter of accuracy as it is\na -- a matter of -- of moral weighing, and does that fall\nwithin prong one of -- of the Teague exception?\nMR. MURRAY: Prong one of the second exception?\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. MURRAY: Yes, Your Honor, to the extent that\n-- I mean, I understand what you're saying, but to the\nextent that this is going to categorical accuracy.\nQUESTION: But it sounds more like judgment than\naccuracy is what I'm getting at.\nMR. MURRAY: It is -- and is -- and that's why\nthe accuracy I -- we believe has to be categorical. If I\ncould put it this way. There's -- there's a imaginary\nline of -- about who can get closest to being correct in\nthe term of accuracy that really hasn't been defined by\nthe Court in this context, but in everyday uses accuracy\nis -- is sort of getting it right. But that's not what\nreally works out here in these capital cases because we\nhave this normative or subjective type aggravating\ncircumstances.\nWe're talking about can we say for sure that\njurors versus the judge -- the individual judge would\nalways get these issues the same. And if they would not,\nif they would not categorically be accurate in that\nrespect, then we have a problem because the -- the jurors\nare supposed to be representing the community's common\nsense.\nQUESTION: Well, that's -- that's -- everything\nyou say is -- is true so far, but I don't know that that\ngets you to satisfy the accuracy prong. Judges and juries\nmay -- I -- I don't know how it would really work out, but\nthey -- they may make different normative judgments,\ndifferent moral judgments in -- in applying a factor like\nthis. But I don't think it falls within the -- the\ncategory of accuracy.\nMR. MURRAY: Well -- well, Your Honor, we're -\nour position is that it's accuracy only in, as I said, a\ncategorical context because you can't ever determine who\nis absolutely right or wrong. It's not like adding\nnumbers. But you can say that after the Court's decision\nin Ballew and other cases looking at group deliberation\nand unanimity requirements and the proper presentation of\nevidence to the jury, that their role as the community's\nvoice for what their sense of -- of the moral outrage, of\nwhat their sense -- in determining the eligibility,\nbecause that's what we're looking at here with the\naggravators in Arizona, is going to be more accurate over\nthe long run than a single judge.\nQUESTION: Mr. Murray, I -- I have sort of the\nsame problem that Justice O'Connor did. I find it hard to\ncontemplate how we could have held in DeStefano that\nDuncan v. Louisiana, which for the first time applied the\njury trial guarantee of the Federal Constitution to the\nStates -- I mean, the entire trial didn't have to be\nbefore a jury until we decided Duncan. And in DeStefano,\nwe said that decision doesn't have to be retroactive, that\nthe cases decided before Duncan will stand even though the\njudge decided the entire criminal case, not just the -\nthe one element we're talking about here.\nHow -- how can you possibly reconcile that with\nwhat you're asking us to do here? This seems relatively\nminor compared to the quite more massive change in\naccuracy, if you believe it, which -- which Duncan\nproduced.\nMR. MURRAY: Well, specifically, Your Honor, we\nhave two responses to that.\nFirst, there are other cases from this Court's\nprecedent where the DeStefano's refusal to find\nretroactivity for Duncan was set aside and not followed.\nFor example, after Ballew, then you had Brown and the\nBurch decisions, and they -- they specifically refused to\nfind -- follow DeStefano, and in fact, this Court said,\nrejects the argument in Brown v. Louisiana that\nDeStefano's refusal to apply Duncan retroactively\ncontrolled and because of a constitutional rule directed\ntoward ensuring that the proper functioning of the jury in\nthose cases in which it has been provided can be given\nretroactive effect. That is in note 13 in -- in Brown.\nQUESTION: But -- but those cases do not involve\nthe precise issue that you're bringing before us here.\nThe precise issue in Duncan was the difference between\nhaving the judge decide and having the jury decide.\nThat's the very thing that's at issue here. Those other\ncases you mentioned did not involve that very thing.\nMR. MURRAY: Yes, Your Honor. In Duncan, they\nhad dealt with the issue of whether there is a right to\njury trial in the States.\nWe also have other cases from this Court's\nprecedents such as In re Winship, which was going to the\nburden of proof to prove every element being held\nretroactive.\nWe have Mullaney being held retroactive and\nHankerson which talks about whether the States can make\nsort of end runs around by labeling issues as sentencing\nfactors -\nQUESTION: The point is that they didn't involve\nprecisely what is involved here. The difference between\nhaving the judge decide the case and having the jury\ndecide the case. Our only precedent dealing precisely\nwith that issue says that the decision is not retroactive.\nMR. MURRAY: That's correct, Your Honor, but\nalso you can remember that that case was decided pre\nTeague when the balancing process that the Court used\nincluded a consideration and -- and have given great\nweight to the consideration of the overall effect of the\nadministration of justice.\nAnd I'd also point out -\nQUESTION: Teague -- but Teague does that too,\ndoes it not? Gives great weight to the overall effect in\nthe administration of justice in a different way perhaps.\nMR. MURRAY: Teague has done that essentially to\nthe extent that the Court is going to consider that by the\ndefinition of a standard that is set in Teague. But it\nhas withdrawn it as a balancing factor that's specifically\ntaken into consideration and can be given as much weight\nas it has previously.\nI'd also point out that Teague as -- as a result\nof Justice Harlan's writings in Desist and Mackey and he\nhimself had said that the failure to hold Duncan\nretroactive in DeStefano was -- probably eroded the\nprinciple that new rules affecting the very integrity of\nfact-finding processes are to be retroactively applied.\nSo -\nQUESTION: That was a separate opinion, was it\nnot?\nMR. MURRAY: It was, Your Honor.\nIf I can then, I'd like to move on to the\nsubstantive and procedural question that has been raised,\nand that is something that has caused a lot of confusion.\nBut it is not our position that Ring -- the rule in Ring\nitself is purely substantive because every substantive\nruling will generate and will have flow from it a\nprocedural consequence constitutionally. So Ring is both\nprocedural and substantive. But it had to be substantive\nfirst because what the Court said in Ring was these\naggravating circumstances in Arizona where they are used\nfor the purpose of determining eligibility as opposed to\nthe purpose of imposition of the death penalty or\nselection under the Eighth Amendment due -- Eighth\nAmendment jurisprudence -- these factors are necessary to\nestablish eligibility for the death penalty. Thus, it\nfollows that the conviction for murder or first degree\nmurder which the jury can make in -- under Arizona law,\nplus the finding of the aggravating factor is what\nactually makes an individual guilty of a capital offense\nin Arizona.\nQUESTION: I agree. I think you can see it as\nsubstantive or you can see it as procedural.\nBut I wonder, because you've read all these\ncases now, is that -- is -- do you -- do you think that\nthe Teague categories -- how fixed are they meant to be?\nWhat I'm thinking of in particular is the remark that\nactually the Chief Justice made about it did reflect\nsomething to do with administration of justice.\nSo suppose that you had a case in which it looks\nas if it falls on the substantive side of the line, but\nreally to let everyone out of prison is going to -- is\ngoing to just devastate the justice system. Is there\nroom, given Teague, for some flexibility there? In other\nwords, are the factors absolutely written in stone? Is\nthere any indication they're flexible to read in the light\nof Teague's purposes? What's your reaction to that?\nMR. MURRAY: Well, our position, Your Honor, is\nthat there is room for flexibility and -- and it is\nessential if you're going -- if the Court is going to be\nlooking at these cases and trying to determine how the\nresult of their decisions will affect everybody else who\nare in similar positions, because the goal of Teague is to\nensure that people in similar circumstances receives equal\ntreatment. And in looking at the specific circumstances,\nI think that it is flexible.\nQUESTION: Mr. Murray, we have many opinions\nwhich -- which comment upon the fact that the -- the line\nbetween substance and procedure is an extremely variable\none and that they really are just -- just two opposites in\nvarious fields, and -- and where the line is depends upon\nthe purpose for which you're calling it substantive or\ncalling it procedural.\nNow, Mr. Feldman gave us what he -- what his\nassessment of -- of what our Teague rule means by -- by\nsubstantive and that is if you have changed the -- the\npunishment or if you have changed the status of whether an\nact could be performed without being criminally punished,\nthat is a substantive change.\nNow, if you believe that that's what substance\nversus procedure means here, this is clearly not\nsubstantive. Right?\nMR. MURRAY: If that's the limitation -\nQUESTION: If -- if that's what it means.\nNow, if -- if you don't agree with his\ndescription of -- of what the dichotomy is, what is your\nunderstanding of -- of what constitutes something that is\nsubstantive under -- under Teague?\nMR. MURRAY: Our understanding, Your Honor, is\nthat the position that the Assistant SG gave is included\nin a broader, more universal definition of what\nsubstantive is and that is at the core of a substantive\nruling is defining what the elements of an offense are,\nback to the status quo of finding what is a crime, what is\nthe crime of capital murder -\nQUESTION: Even though the additional 5 years or\n10 years for -- for an act that was innocent was being\nimposed under the rubric of a sentencing factor rather\nthan under the rubric of element.\nMR. MURRAY: Well, anytime that you -- yes, but\nanytime that you change the definition, it's a substantive\n-- substantive change -\nQUESTION: Well, it -- it is substantive for the\npurpose of whether it's in a criminal procedure book as an\nelement or as a -- as a sentencing factor, but it's not\nsubstantive for the purpose of whether an individual knew\nthat if he did this, he was going to get 5 more years.\nIt's not substantive in that sense. And I thought that\nthat's what Teague was talking about.\nMR. MURRAY: Well, Your Honor, that -- that\nsounds of the first exception to Teague, and our position\nis that -- is not the entire universe of what substantive\nis about because in this case, although in Arizona the\nindividuals were charged with -- setting aside for the\nmoment the indictment issue, they were charged and given\nnotice, at least pretrial, of the aggravating\ncircumstances for which they -- the State was trying to\nimpose the death penalty. So that is known.\nBut the -- the question is would -- did they\nknow that the -- the jury -- that they have a right to\nhave a jury verdict. Did they know that the jury was not\ngoing to be determining essentially what was the offense\nof capital murder? And that is where it becomes a\nsubstantive situation because in Arizona they do not,\nbased on the jury's finding, convict the individual being\ncharged in a capital case of capital murder. It wasn't\nuntil Ring came down, that they finally admitted that in\nArizona from -- from the other side, but that's the\nessence of the substantive.\nQUESTION: There was a question that was asked\nto Mr. Wood and that was about do Apprendi and Ring go\ntogether, and I'd like your answer to that. If we agree\nwith you that this is substantive, wouldn't it follow that\nApprendi also would be retroactive?\nMR. MURRAY: The short answer, Your Honor, is\nmaybe or -- or not necessarily. It would depend on the -\n(Laughter.)\nMR. MURRAY: -- the reason -\nQUESTION: What -- what -- could you give me a\nreason why they shouldn't go together?\nMR. MURRAY: If -- if you rule -- we've\npresented basically four arguments. If you accept the\nargument that there was a misunderstanding of State law,\nnot Federal or that it was an old rule, which we haven't\ndiscussed yet, we don't think that Apprendi and Ring would\nbe hooked together.\nIf it's the substantive versus procedural issue\nthat this Court relies upon, our position -- it would be\nvery difficult to distinguish Apprendi from Ring. If -\nif we're going to buy our -- our definition of\nsubstantive, then they will both probably be the same.\nIf we get to the second exception of Teague, the\none that implicates the fairness and accuracy, our\nposition is that you wouldn't necessarily have to overturn\nor make Apprendi retroactive if you're depending on the\nspecific and unique aspects of capital cases that we've\nbeen discussing so far.\nQUESTION: On your -- your not a new rule, I\nfound that hard to follow in light of Walton. I mean,\nWalton was the law until Ring said it was -- overruled it\npro tonto.\nMR. MURRAY: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: So how could it not be -- given that\nWalton was the instruction, how could Ring be anything but\nnew?\nMR. MURRAY: Well, Ring went back, so to speak,\nto the old law. First off, let me just point out in\nanswering the question that Mr. Summerlin's case was pre\nWalton. His case became final 6 years before this Court's\ndecision in Walton.\nWhat happened in Walton then was this Court made\nthe decision, based on the aspect -- the issue of whether\nthere is a Sixth Amendment right to juries' involvement in\nsentencing in capital cases. Walton, until Ring, was in\nessence a -- a blip in the history upon which the State\njumped on to deny relief in these cases.\nIn Ring, the Court recognized that there is a\ndifference between the Sixth Amendment right or lack of\nthat -\nQUESTION: Why do you say Walton was a blip in\n-- in the history? Are you talking about from the time\nArizona reimposed capital punishment after Furman?\nMR. MURRAY: Yes, Your Honor, and even before\nthat. For hundreds of years, juries have been having the\nresponsibility to determine the facts that are necessary\nfor individuals to be eligible for the death penalty.\nQUESTION: But surely, I mean, Arizona had\nadopted that system before Walton or Walton wouldn't have\nhad occasion to pass on it.\nMR. MURRAY: Arizona never adopted the -- the\nsystem wherein the juries would be involved in sentencing.\nThey adopted the system where the jury convicted only of\nthe first degree murder and never performed the\neligibility determination, although that's what the\nstatute required.\nQUESTION: And -- and it was that system that\ncame to us in Walton, was it not?\nMR. MURRAY: It was that system, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: So saying that Walton -- when you say\nblip, I got the impression you thought it originated\nsomething. It didn't. It just passed on the existing\nsystem in Arizona.\nMR. MURRAY: It passed on the existing system in\nArizona but for the wrong reason. But for a\nmisunderstanding of how the system in Arizona worked, this\nCourt -- had this Court been presented with, for example,\nthe information the Arizona Supreme Court gave in Ring I\nwhen they explained that in the Arizona system the\naggravating circumstances do serve the eligibility purpose\nthat they are an essential statutory factual element, then\nhad you had that before Walton, had you had that\ninformation, Walton would have resulted in a different\nopinion is our position because you would have known then\nwhat you acknowledged in Ring, that we're not talking\nabout jury sentencing in capital cases. We're talking\nabout making determination of eligibility for the death\npenalty itself with these aggravating circumstances.\nAnd I would point out this is heinous, cruel,\nand depraved aggravating circumstance. It isn't one --\nand this goes back a little bit to accuracy, but it isn't\none that everybody necessarily agrees on because the\nprosecutor himself, the initial prosecutor in this case,\ndid not, as the court in the Ninth Circuit points out,\nbelieve that there was enough evidence to support the\nheinous, cruel, and depraved circumstance -- aggravating\ncircumstance. But that --\nQUESTION: Why -- why should that be a factor\nthat we take into consideration? I mean, surely there\ncould be a difference between prosecutors and the fact\nthat somebody in the DA's office thought there wasn't\nevidence -- enough evidence to go ahead, shouldn't be\ncrucial in deciding whether the finding was correct made\nby the court or by the jury.\nMR. MURRAY: It just, Your Honor, goes to the\nfact that if two people on the government's side of the\ncase are disagreeing on it, then it just shows the\nabsolute need and the -- the essential character of the\njury's role in determining the community's sense of\nwhether such an aggravating factor did exist in this case.\nNow, if I can just continue on the old versus\nthe new then, what happened then was that given the\nunderstanding of the -- how the Arizona court worked, this\nCourt went back to -- to the basics of determining that\nevery element of an offense, in this case capital murder,\nmust be proved beyond a reasonable doubt and the State is\nnot able to rely upon mere labels or, you know, drafting\nof the sentence -- of the statutes to give a different\ndetermination to what those aggravating circumstances are.\nAnd so this is really back consistent with\nMullaney and -- and Patterson and McMillan, although\nMcMillan wasn't out at the time Mr. Summerlin's case\nbecame final. That was 2 years later. But that series of\ncases.\nWhen we say it's -- it's old, it's as if Walton\nwas a -- in essence, a new rule and Ring was a new rule\nthat corrected Walton. And so we're back for Mr.\nSummerlin where he's raised this issue for 20 years since\n1983, over 20 years, and -- and has sought to have the\njury verdict on the capital offense to make -- and their\ndetermination of whether he was eligible for the death\npenalty. And he has not been given that.\nQUESTION: Do you agree, by the way, with Mr.\nWood that the judge -- whatever his name was -- that he\ndidn't use the presentence report because that would be\nconsidered hearsay under Arizona law?\nMR. MURRAY: I do, Your Honor. There was a\nsignificant amount of inadmissible or irrelevant evidence\nthat went to the judge, Judge Marquardt, who was a judge\nthat had his own problems in this case, but that went to\nhim that would not have been reviewed or heard by the\njury.\nIn addition, the -\nQUESTION: But Mr. Wood said he couldn't\nconsider it because it was hearsay. Is it -\nMR. MURRAY: Well -\nQUESTION: But the judge -- no more than the\njury, the judge could not have considered that in\ndetermining whether there was an aggravating factor.\nMR. MURRAY: I understand, and I agree that\nthere are rules that -- and there are rules and\npresumptions that say that the court is not going to\nconsider irrelevant or inadmissable evidence. The problem\nwe have is that evidence is there. The judges are human.\nThey have human frailties as this case shows, and in the\nlong run, that is precisely why the Framers of the\nConstitution chose to have the juries to stand as\nprotectant bulwarks between the accused and the government\nofficials who are, you know, seeking to have the death\npenalty imposed on the individual.\nQUESTION: Who don't have human frailties.\nRight? Juries -- juries without human frailties.\nMR. MURRAY: We all -- the juries, the judges,\nevery one of us have human frailties, Justice Scalia.\nQUESTION: There -- there were a number of\nissues that you raised in this case that -- that they\ndidn't get to below. Is that right? Because of the court\nof appeals' decision on the Ring retroactivity.\nMR. MURRAY: Yes, Your Honor. There are all but\n-- they did rule on the ineffectiveness at the trial phase\nitself --\nQUESTION: And they rejected the -\nMR. MURRAY: -- as a preliminary matter, but the\nremainder of the rules -- of the ineffectiveness issues\nand the judge issues remain open. And I -- I would assume\nthat if we did not prevail on this, that we'd be back in\nthe Ninth Circuit for a ruling on that.\nIf there are no further questions, I believe\nI've covered the issues, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Murray.\nMr. Todd, you have 2 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN P. TODD\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. TODD: If I may, I would like to respond to\nJustice Breyer's question concerning flexibility of\nTeague. And I -- I would suggest that if this Court had a\nrule that so increased accuracy, a new rule, and so was -\nchanged this Court's understanding of some truly bedrock\nprinciple, then this Court would not care how many cases\nit affected because it was so important, so critical and\nthat you would apply it retroactively.\nConversely, if a rule doesn't reach that, then\nyou don't apply it retroactively under Teague is -- is our\nunderstanding. The -\nQUESTION: What -- what rules would fit that so\nimportant? And the -- the briefs cite Gideon. Is there\nanything else?\nMR. TODD: I think Gideon is the -- the ideal,\nperfect example.\nQUESTION: Yes, but are there other examples?\nMR. TODD: I cannot think of one off the top of\nmy head, Your Honor. These surely are not.\nIn -- in terms of your concern with whether\nthere's any substance component to the Teague -- excuse me\n-- to the Ring or Apprendi opinions, it seems to me this\nCourt's opinion in Bousley where you're explaining what\ntruly is a substantive change and you cite to the first\nTeague exception in the Bousley case, that sort of\nexplains that -- what you're really concerned with,\nparticularly on habeas, is that we don't have somebody who\nshouldn't be convicted, shouldn't be punished in the\nsystem. And so if it falls within like the first Teague\nexception or if you've change the law, your -- your\nunderstanding of the law like in Bailey, or the other two\ncases that are cited in the yellow brief, Fiore v. White\nand Bunkley v. Florida, where the State court interpreted\nState law and determined that in their construction of the\nlaw, they changed the scope of that statute -\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Todd.\nMR. TODD: You're welcome.\n"
