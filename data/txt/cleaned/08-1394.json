United\nStates.\nMr. Srinivasan.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\nThe dramatic collapse of Enron had profound\nreverberations experienced throughout the Houston\neconomy and citizenry. Countless individuals in the\nHouston area were affected, as the court of appeals\nexplicitly recognized, so much so that 60 percent of the\njury venire affirmatively acknowledged in the responses\nto questionnaires that they would be unable to set aside\ntheir deep-seated biases or doubted their ability to do\nso, or that they were angry about Enron's collapse, an\nanger that was manifested in the vitriolic terms in\nwhich Petitioner Jeff Skilling was referred to\nrepeatedly both in the questionnaires and in the\ncommunity more generally.\nThe passions about this case were so intense\nand the connections to Enron ran so deep that the entire\nUnited States Attorney's Office, all 150 or so\nattorneys, recused themselves from the investigation\nthat culminated in this prosecution.\nIn those conditions, the court of appeals\nwas correct in unanimously concluding that this was one\nof the very rare cases in which, because of the degree\nof passion and prejudice in the community, the process\nof voir dire cannot be relied upon to adequately ferret\nout and identify unduly biased jurors. And --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What do we take from\ntrial counsel at the end of the voir dire process\nannouncing that if he had had extra preemptory\nchallenges, he would have used them only against 6 of the\n12 people that were finally selected? If that's all he\nwould have ejected, why couldn't a fair jury have been\nfound?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, Your Honor, to be\nclear even one juror who should have been excluded and\nwasn't would have been enough, but --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's a different --\nthat's a different question.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Sure.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You are taking a broader\nproposition and saying that the presumption could not\nunder any set of circumstances be overcome, and that's\nwhat I'm trying to probe.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Yes, Justice Sotomayor.\nThe reason that trial counsel objected to six specific\njurors at the juncture that Your Honor's referring to\nis that that corresponded to six cause objections that had\nbeen, in our view, erroneously denied. Now, that in no way\nsuggests that we were satisfied with the remainder of\nthe jury. We had made an objection --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. There was\nonly one juror that had been challenged for cause\nagainst -- for which a preemptory challenge wasn't used.\nI thought that every other for-cause challenge ended up\nbeing excused on the basis of a preemptory challenge.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: That's right, and that's\nwhat I was trying to say, Your Honor, that the reason\nwhy trial counsel identified six specific jurors was\nthat there were six other jurors who would have been on\nthe venire as to whom we had applied -- as to whom we had\nasserted a cause challenge that was denied, and because\nof that we had to use a preemptory to strike those\njurors, which left us without --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that means that\nthere were six that were okay.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, no. There were\nsix as -- there were six remaining as to which we didn't\nhave a corresponding for-cause objection that had been\ndenied. But in no way indicates that we were satisfied\nwith the other six.\nFrom the very outset, we complained about\nthis process. We said at the outset before trial that\nno juror could be seated in this case because the\nprocess of voir dire couldn't adequately be relied upon\nin these conditions.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Tell me what in the\nprocess itself, outside of your general proposition that\nno process could find fair jurors? What else in the\nprocess was deficient?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: The process was deficient\nin a couple of respects, Your Honor: First, with respect\nto time and scope. The voir dire that the trial judge\nconducted was essentially an ordinary voir dire for\nordinary circumstances. He announced before the fact\nthat the voir dire would be conducted in a period of 1\nday, and we objected to that.\nHe also announced that he would have limited\nquestioning and that counsel would have very limited\nopportunity to follow up with additional questions. We\nalso objected clearly and repeatedly to that. And that\nwas manifested in the voir dire that occurred, because\nwhat the trial judge did is made two fundamental, we\nthink, mistakes in the way he conducted the voir dire.\nOne occurs with respect to those jurors as\nto whom they had laid bare their biases, and another\noccurs with respect to those jurors as to whom they\ndidn't affirmatively acknowledge their biases, but,\ngiven the conditions that prevailed in the community,\nthey might well have had biases that they didn't\naffirmatively acknowledge.\nNow, with respect to the first, the mistake\nthat, in our view, the trial judge made was to accept a\nsimple assurance of fairness in the face of overt statements\nof bias and in conditions that confronted this community,\nwhere there was deep-seated community prejudice and animus\nthat permeated the Houston -- that permeated the city of\nHouston, that kind of acceptance of a simple assurance of\nfairness in the face of repeated overt statements of bias\nshouldn't be countenanced.\nAnd we think what the trial court should\nhave done in that situation is to move to an additional\njuror. But instead of doing that, the trial court\ninterviewed 46 jurors, nearly 8 more than the minimum\nthat was necessary to constitute a jury in this case.\nAnd just to give this a frame of reference, the entire voir\ndire process in this case took 5 hours, and the trial\njudge interviewed each juror for approximately 4 and a half\nminutes.\nBy way of comparison --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But he did -- he did give\ntime for counsel to ask additional questions, trial\ncounsel.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: He -- he did.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: He asked both sides if\nthey had additional questions.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: He gave some time, Justice\nGinsburg, but he made clear before the voir dire began\nthat that opportunity was going to be limited both in\ntime and scope. With respect to scope -- and this is at\npage 11805 of the record -- what he said was that\nfollow-up questioning would be permitted if it was\nreasonable and if it was related to the purposes for\nwhich the juror was brought before the bench.\nAnd just to paint the picture a little bit,\nthe -- the potential jurors were brought before the bench,\nand they were left standing, which I think reinforced the\nconception that this was going to be a rather quick affair\nand it was not going to allow the kind of extensive,\nmeaningful follow-up that we thought was required.\nAnd to give it a frame of reference, in the\nOklahoma City bombing case, the prosecution of Timothy\nMcVeigh, that proceeding was transferred from the city\nof Oklahoma City to Denver, but even after the transfer,\nthe trial judge conducted an 18-day voir dire with an\naverage of 1 hour of interviews per juror; 18 days and\n1 hour as compared with 5 hours and 4 and a half minutes.\nAnd we think the Oklahoma City experience is much more\nbefitting of the kind of voir dire that's necessary in\ncircumstances of community prejudice and passion of the\nkind that existed here.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You made a change of\nvenue motion at the outset, right?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: We did. We --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And I'm unaware of any\ncase in which we have said a change is mandatory when\nwhat's involved is money rather than life or limb. Life\nor limb obviously was involved in the McVeigh case.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Sure, it was, Your Honor,\nand by no means would we in any way diminish the -- the\nprofound human tragedy that accompanied the Oklahoma\nCity case, but I think the reality of the sentiment on\nthe ground in Houston was that Houston citizens, as we\npointed out in our brief, in fact referred to the -- to\nwhat happened in the wake of the collapse of Enron in\nterms that were similar to the way they referred to\nterrorist attacks. They -- they in fact talked about it\nin terms of the 9/11 attack.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what was remarkable\nabout some of those questionnaires, there were a lot of\npeople didn't read the newspapers. There were a lot of\npeople who indicated they really didn't know anything\nabout this case.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: That's true,\nJustice Ginsburg, but I'd like to clarify one aspect\nof that, if I could, and that's that our argument is not\n-- and it hasn't been at any point in this proceeding --\nthat pretrial publicity caused the passion and prejudice\nin the community. This is -- is very much a case\nin which pretrial publicity was a symptom rather than the\ncause.\nNow, pretrial publicity, to be sure, stoked\nthe passions that -- that already lay within the\ncommunity, but really this was a case in which the\npassions existed regardless of pretrial publicity. And\nI think the juror questionnaires and the surveys and all\nthe other evidence that we put before the district\ncourt manifests that. If you look at the juror\nquestionnaires -- and they are -- there are several examples\nof situations in which particular jurors said that they\nwere unaware of any of the pretrial publicity, they did\nnot watch the news, they didn't read the newspapers,\nthey hadn't seen the movies about Enron, but yet they\nstill said they had feelings about Jeff Skilling and Ken\nLay.\nJuror 63, a person who wound up on the\npanel, is a good example of that. She answered \"no\" to\nall the questions concerning her exposure to pretrial\npublicity, but then when she was asked whether she had\nviews about the guilt or innocence of Jeff Skilling, she\nsaid yes, she did; and she elaborated on that by\nexplaining that I think he probably knew he was breaking\nthe law. So this is a person who, notwithstanding a\nlack of exposure to pretrial publicity --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there was some\nfollow-up to that.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: There -- there was a bit of\nfollow-up to that, Your Honor, but I think the nature of the\nfollow-up is -- is quite illuminating on what we think are\nsome of the fatal flaws in this voir dire process. The\nfollow-up --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do you really think that\nif -- if there had been a much more lengthy voir dire\nand if the trial judge had been more willing to -- to\ngrant motions to dismiss for cause, that it would have\n-- that it would not have been possible to find a fair\nand impartial jury in the district?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, our first --\ncertainly, there should have been a more intensive voir\ndire, Justice Alito. Now, our first order of submission\nis that the proceedings should have been transferred,\nnot necessarily because there don't in fact exist or\nthere didn't in fact exist 12 unbiased jurors in the\ncity of Houston.\nOur point is a different one, and that is\nthat in conditions where you have the level of passion\nand prejudice that permeated the Houston community,\nthere's too great a risk that the process of voir dire\nand particularly the ordinary process of voir dire\nwouldn't be successful in identifying those 12 people.\nThat's the danger.\nAnd the other problem with the argument that\nthe government makes with respect to the fact that there\nare 4 and a half million citizens in Houston, which I think\nis part of Your Honor's question, is that that would mean\nmore if the trial judge had gone deeper into the jury\npool than the mere 46 jurors he did interview. Because\nwhen he interviewed those 46 and stopped at that point,\nwhat we were left with was a jury panel as to which\nthere was too great a danger of bias, too great a danger\nthat they would bring their biases to bear with them in\nadjudicating Petitioner's guilt.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, rule 21 says that the\njudge must grant a transfer if the judge is satisfied\nthat a prejudice against -- that so great a prejudice\nagainst the defendant exists in the transferring\ndistrict that the defendant cannot obtain a fair and\nimpartial trial there.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Correct.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, doesn't that suggest\nthat if you could find a fair and impartial jury with an\nadequate voir dire, then the transfer need not be\ngranted?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I think it has to be\nread against the context of whether we can be confident\nthat you can find that fair and impartial jury. I think in\nany -- I think we would say that in any community in\nwhich there is 4 and a half million people, there may,\nin fact, be 12 individuals who aren't so biased that they\ncan't sit. The real danger, though, is that the ordinary\nprocess of voir dire, as this Court's decisions\nrepeatedly recognize, in Mu'Min, in Patton, and Murphy\nand others, the ordinary process of voir dire in that\nsituation can't be trusted to identify those people.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Because you think --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: And that's the danger here.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- they're going to lie,\nright?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: I'm sorry.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Because you think\nthey're going to lie?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: No, that's --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When they fill out\nthe form and say this is what I've heard, and this -- I\ncan fairly evaluate the law and the arguments?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: No, no. No,\nMr. Chief Justice. With respect, that's not -- that's\nnot the only danger. I mean, that's -- that's part of\nit, but I think there's -- there's other ones that we\nwould put forward before that one.\nThere's two in particular: First, in a\ncommunity like Houston, in the state of the -- the\npassion and prejudice that existed in Houston at the\ntime of this trial, there's a real concern that jurors\nwill not feel fully free to return to that community\ndelivering anything other than the conviction for which\nthe -- the community desires. And that, I think, is an\nimportant concern that this Court's decisions identify.\nAnd the other one, and this is in Murphy in\nparticular, where there's a substantial share of the\ncommunity that's impassioned and prejudiced, as this one\nwas, there's a concern that even jurors who don't lay\nbare -- who don't affirmatively acknowledge their\nbiases -- are unwittingly subject to the same biases\nthat permeate the community. And that sort of danger is\n-- is the reason that in these situations, we think\ntransfer is required.\nBut even if transfer wasn't required, what\nneeded to happen was a more extensive and intensive voir\ndire than happened here. The voir dire was deficient --\nand Justice Ginsburg, this gets back to your question\nabout juror 63. The voir dire was deficient in at least\nthis respect. In conditions like those that permeated\nHouston, we think it's error to accept the assurance of\nfairness of a juror who has already laid bare their\nbiases.\nNow, juror 63, for example, she said she\nthinks she knew that Jeff Skilling -- she thinks that\nJeff Skilling knew he was breaking the law. This is\nsomeone as to whom we ought to be very concerned. In\nour view, that person shouldn't get --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Was there a challenge for\ncause against her?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: There -- there wasn't a\nspecific challenge for cause against her, Your Honor,\nbut -- but again, we challenged everybody on the basis\nthat voir dire wouldn't adequately ferret out biases in\nthis case. And then we did challenge -- as Justice\nSotomayor's question about the six specific challenges\nthat we lodged at the close of the voir dire, but before the\njurors were sworn -- juror 63 was one of those jurors.\nAnd so I think it was evident that juror 63\nwas not at all somebody who we were satisfied with. And\nthe reason is, if you look at the nature of -- at the\nvoir dire colloquy with her, the trial court asked her\nabout that statement and asked her: You remember\nmaking this statement? Do you still feel that way? And\nher response was: I don't know.\nAnd then she acknowledged: I have no further\ninformation to bring to bear on that question than I did\nthen. And at that point, she has only fortified the\nbias that she brought with her, but the trial court was\nunsatisfied, and he continued to press. And then he asked\nher at some point: Can you apply the presumption of\ninnocence? And she said yes. And then that was it.\nBut in our view, a -- a search for a --\n-- what I think can fairly be described as a rote\nassurance of fairness can't be sufficient, given the\nvery evident danger that someone like juror 63, who has\nalready laid bare her biases, would bring her biases\nwith her to the panel when she adjudicated Petitioner's\nguilt or innocence.\nJUSTICE BREYER: How do you say we -- in\nyour opinion, if we agreed with your basic idea -- if,\nwhich is totally hypothetical.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Sure.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If we agreed with that, how\nwould we sketch the lines? That is, when does the\njury -- does the judge have to do more than is ordinary,\nand what counts as more than ordinary? I mean, I --\nwhat I have fear of, to put it out for you, is that jury\nselection can go on a very long time.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And judges have to -- have\nto run their trials. And if we tell the judges that\nthey have got to do more, that will become exaggerated,\nand they'll administer it in a way that will make it\nhard to select juries.\nThat's the harm I'm worried about. So I'm\nasking you, how would you sketch a line that prevents\nthat harm?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Justice Breyer, it is by\nnature a contextual inquiry. The standard that this\nCourt has articulated to identify the circumstances in\nwhich this sort of extra -- I think -- precaution is\nnecessary is that there has to be, a quote, \"wave of\npublic passion,\" close quote, and that's the language\nthat the Court has used in a number of its decisions.\nNow, that may --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: See, the problem with --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: I'm sorry. Go ahead,\nJustice Sotomayor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No. Finish Justice Breyer --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: I -- I -- anticipating what\nyou might feel, which is that that language may not be\nself-evident as to the circumstances in which a deeper\ninquiry is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I didn't ask you -- I just\nasked you to do your best.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Yes, and that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So we've got the wave of\npublic passion --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Wave --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And what about the second\nhalf?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Wave of public passion, and\nI guess the substrata that I would put beneath that,\nespecially for this category of cases, is pervasive\nanimus directed towards the defendant as responsible for\na harm felt by the entire community.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, what's the\nsecond half? The second half, which I'm really worried\nabout, is that we get into the business of running the\ntrial court's trials. So I want to know what it is that\nthe trial court at that stage, in your opinion, other\nthan transfer, has to do?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: I think what the trial\ncourt has to do is two things, Your Honor: First, for a\njuror who has laid bare his or her biases, that juror\nshould not be allowed on the panel, and an assurance of\nfairness from that sort of juror isn't enough. At the\nvery least, Your Honor, on this category -- and then I'll\ngo to my second point -- in a situation in which a\njuror has laid bare his or her biases, we think that\njuror shouldn't be seated.\nBut if you're going to entertain the\nthought of seating that person, at the very least this has to\nhappen: They have to be forced to confront their assurance\nof fairness as against the many statements of bias that\nthey may have uttered.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What happens if -- I gather --\nthat a -- that a trial judge has a panel in front of him and\npeople say, yes, I think he is guilty? And -- and the\ntrial judge says, now, if you listen to the presumption,\ncan you be fair? You look him in the eye, and if he says,\nyes, I can put this aside, trial judges do accept those\njurors.\nNow, if that is the practice, and others\nwould know more than me, then our -- our -- I'm\nworried about changing that ordinary practice.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: To be clear, Justice Breyer,\nthat ordinary practice would only be altered in the very\nrare category of cases that involve a wave of public\npassion. And -- and they would be altered in the\nfollowing respect: That if somebody had laid bare their\nbiases, the -- in our view, what should happen is that\nyou should move to the next juror.\nBut even if you didn't do that, at least the\nfollowing should happen, Justice Breyer, and that is\nthat when somebody utters an assurance of fairness, that\nitself shouldn't be enough when the community is\npermeated with the sorts of biases that attended this\nproceeding. The jurors should at least be forced to\nreconcile their previous statements of bias with their\nutterance of fairness.\nThe other point I would make is this: That\nthe danger that this Court has identified in conditions\nlike those that pervaded the Houston community is that\neven with prospective jurors who don't affirmatively\nacknowledge their biases, there's a danger that they\nmay have biases they haven't brought to the fore. And\nwe think what can't happen is what the trial judge did\nin this case, which is to refuse to question any of the\njurors on the basis of any response they gave in the\nquestionnaire, other than responses that raised a red\nflag.\nAnd we think if you curtail the inquiry in\nthat regard, it doesn't allow for the sort of voir dire\nthat's necessary to in order to be --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I look at --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: -- in order to ferret out\nbiases that may be latent.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is there any place in\nthe record I could look to see questions that you would\nhave posed absent the judge's limitations?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: There are, Justice\nSotomayor. There's at R 12036, I think, is an --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. Repeat that.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: I sorry. R 12036 is an\nimportant document, which is our renewed motion for\nchange of venue and related relief. And that was after\nthe questionnaire responses had been received.\nAnd the point we made in that document is\nthat as a consequence of the questionnaire responses, we\nalready knew that a great deal of bias permeated the\nvenire. And we proposed not only that the proceedings\nshould be transferred, but also that a different\nsort of voir dire should be conducted than the one that\nthe trial court envisioned. And we laid out in that\nmotion the sorts of things that we thought should be\ndone.\nAnd we did that in other places as well,\nYour Honor, but I think that would be a good place to\nlook. But --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, can I --\nperhaps it's time for you to shift gears, if I could --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Sure.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- and move to\nthe statutory question.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Sure.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't understand\nwhy it's difficult. The statute prohibits \"scheme to\ndeprive another of the intangible right of honest\nservices.\" Skilling owed the Enron shareholders honest\nservices. He acted dishonestly in a way that harmed\nthem. But I don't understand the difficulty.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I\nthink part of the problem with that sort of rendition is\nthat that -- I think nobody suggests that any dishonest\nconduct falls within the compass of this law, that no\npre-McNally case suggests that. And I think the\ngovernment doesn't takes that position, either.\nIf it did --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, there has to\nbe -- there has to be a right to honesty. In other\nwords, it's not just in the abstract. And the\nshareholders had a right to his honest services.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: But I don't think that\nyou've advanced the ball, with all due respect, that much\nby saying there has a right to honest services, because I\nthink what -- at the end of the day, what that would mean\nis that any situation in which there's a fiduciary duty\nor even if there's not a fiduciary duty, but at least\nany situation in which there is a fiduciary duty, a\nnondisclosure of deception would give rise to a\nFederal felony prosecution.\nAnd that has never been the understanding\nunder pre-McNally case law, and that shouldn't be the\nunderstanding now, because its sweep is breathtaking, and\nit's not something that we would ordinarily construe\nCongress to have intended.\nNow, I think in -- in this case, there's\nseveral objections we have to the application of the\nhonest services fraud statute to this case. We think\nthe statute is unconstitutionally vague. We think it's\nparticularly vague as applies to -- as applied to anything\nbeyond the narrow category of bribes and kickbacks.\nBut I think in some ways the most\nstraightforward way to understand why the honest\nservices fraud statute can't be applied validly in this\ncase is to appreciate what I think is an evolution in\nthe government's theory. And -- and at the time of\nWeyhrauch -- and this is at page 48 of the government's\nbrief in Weyhrauch, just a few months ago. The government\nsaid that the honest services fraud statute, quote,\n\"Nor does it cover an official whose interest is public\nknowledge.\"\nSo, at that point, I think we -- we would have\nbelieved that the honest services fraud statute can't be\napplied to Jeff Skilling, because his interest, as the\ngovernment acknowledges, was public knowledge.\nBut the position that the government has\ntaken now is that even though his interest was\ndisclosed, he didn't disclose that he was acting in\npursuit of that interest at the expense of the\nemployer's interests, which I read to be contrary to the\nposition that they took in the Weyhrauch case and, I\nthink, which is problematic in two respects.\nFirst, there is no pre-McNally\nunderstanding, none, that a disclosed interest can give\nrise to honest services liability. And, second, and\nmaybe more importantly --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. A\ndisclosed interest?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: A disclosed interest, where\nthe interest is disclosed. All the cases dealt with\nsituations in which the interest is undisclosed, as the\ngovernment suggested would be the case in the Weyhrauch\nbrief.\nBut -- but perhaps even more importantly,\nthere is no pre-McNally understanding to the effect\nthat acting in pursuit of an interest in compensation\ncan give rise to honest services liability. And, in\nfact, in a post-McNally case, the Thompson case\nout of the -- out of the Seventh Circuit, Judge\nEasterbrook, we think, explained persuasively why\npursuit of an interest in personal compensation\nshouldn't afford the gravamen of --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And I thought part of\nthe government's theory was not --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: -- an honest services\nprosecution.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- wasn't limited to the\ncompensation. It was essentially Skilling owned shares,\nand he had information that those shares were inflated.\nShareholders owned shares. They didn't have that\ninformation. Skilling then sold those shares at a great\nprofit to himself. And the shareholders were left\nwithout that information. And then when the stock\nprice plummeted, they all lost out.\nI thought that the government was not\nlimiting the -- its position to the compensation, but was\nalso dealing with the share price.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: I think, Justice Ginsburg,\nthe government's theory on how the honest services fraud\nstatute applies in this case is laid out at page 49\nand 50. And the interest that the government identifies\nthat was furthered by Petitioner Skilling's action is\nhis interest in compensation. That's -- that's how the\ngovernment, I think, describes it.\nAnd the -- it's true, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What 49 and 50? Of the\ngovernment's brief?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Of the government's brief.\nAnd it's true, Your Honor, that the\ndeception that they identify has to do with securities\nfraud. And I'll bracket for the moment that we think\nthat the honest services fraud theory that was put\nbefore the jury is not at all commensurate with the one\nthat's being asserted now.\nBut even if you take as a given that it's\nthe theory now, the elements of honest services fraud\nunder the government's theory are that the individual\nwould act in pursuit of his interest in his own\ncompensation at the expense of the employer's interests\nin acquiring better information with which to make an\ninformed decision.\nAnd one of the fundamental problems we see\nwith that approach is that it would threaten to convert\nalmost any lie in the workplace into an honest services\nfraud prosecution for the following --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I -- I just don't\n-- because I'm looking at page 50. I thought this\ndiscussion goes from 50 to 52, and that the part on 52\ncertainly homes in on the share -- the shares.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: It -- it does, Your Honor,\nbut the interest at issue -- and I'm reading from page\n50. This is in the middle of the first full paragraph\non page 50. The government says, \"That constitute\" --\n\"That conduct constituted fraud.\" The only question here is\nwhether the public nature of petitioner's compensation\nscheme prevents his conduct from constituting honest\nservices fraud.\"\nAnd then they go on: \"Although the\" --\n\"Although petitioner's basic compensation scheme was\npublic, his scheme to artificially inflate the\ncompany's stock price by misrepresenting its financial\ncondition, in order to derive additional personal\nbenefits\" -- i.e., his compensation -- \"at the expense of\nshareholders, was not\" disclosed.\nSo I think the theory of application here is\nthat because he was acting allegedly --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why -- why do you put in\nthe \"i.e.\"? Additional personal benefits could be both.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Because the stock is the\ncompensation, Your Honor. There's -- there's no -- I\nthink, in this sort of situation, there's not a\ndisaggregation between the stock and the compensation.\nThe stock was intimately tied to his compensation, and\nthe personal benefit that, I think, was being received\nwas that compensation interest.\nI mean, the government can clarify that, but\nthat's my understanding of the government's view.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I think we'll ask the\ngovernment to do that.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: And the danger with that theory\nis that it would have the capacity to convert almost any\nworkplace lie into a Federal felony, for the following\nreason: That, in a variety of situations, an employee\nmight -- might engage in an act of deception to his\nemployer with respect to a work-related matter. For\nexample, suppose that there is an employer policy that\nsays you can only use workplace computers for business\npurposes, and when asked, the employee says that he is\nonly using it for business purposes, but he is in fact\nusing it for personal reasons. Well, at that point he\nwill have made a deception to the employer. Arguably,\nit would be material, particularly given that it acts in\nthe face of an employer policy, and it arguably was made\nin furtherance of the employer's personal interest in\nmaximizing his compensation at the expense of the -- at\nthe expense of the employer's interests in having better\ninformation with which to make an informed decision\nabout the employee's future.\nSo for that reason as well, we think that\nthe application of the honest services fraud --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What you've just\nexplained is why you think the statute is very broad.\nYou haven't explained why it's vague.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, there are two\ndifferent arguments, Your Honor. Our threshold\nsubmission is the statute is unconstitutionally vague,\nand we believe that it's particularly vague as applied\nto a category that extends beyond bribes and kickbacks.\nAnd I haven't been through those arguments, but they're\n-- they're spelled out in our briefs.\nNow, with respect to the remaining category,\nwhich is undisclosed self-dealing, even that category we\nthink is a problem in and of itself. But it's\nparticularly problematic when it's applied to the realm\nof compensation for the reasons that I have outlined.\nIf the Court has no further questions, I'd\nlike to reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Dreeben.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. DREEBEN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nWhen Judge Lake approached this case with\nthe question of how to select a jury, he had 15 years of\nexperience in selecting juries, and he informed the\nparties that it was his experience that voir dire\nconducted by the trial judge is more effective at\neliciting the potential biases of a juror than the\noftentimes tendentious voir dire that's conducted by\nthe parties.\nHe did not ignore the fact that the Enron\ncollapse had a significant impact on the Houston\ncommunity. He worked with the parties to develop a 14-\npage questionnaire, which I encourage the Court to look\nat, if the Court has not already done so. It's\nextraordinarily detailed. It has more than 70 questions\ndesigned to ferret out any possible connections between\nthe individual jurors and the Enron collapse. It asked\nfor their views about the Enron collapse. It asked for\nwhether --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can you tell me of any\nother high-profile case comparable to this in which the\nvoir dire lasted only 5 hours?\nMR. DREEBEN: Judge -- Justice Sotomayor,\nI'm not familiar with the length of voir dire in\nparticular cases. But I think that there is no --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you aware of any\nthat's been reported where the selection was 5 hours\nonly?\nMR. DREEBEN: No, I'm not aware of any,\nbut I don't think that there is any problem with this\nvoir dire, and I think there is really --\nJUSTICE BREYER: There's no problem? I went\nthrough the 200 pages, and I counted -- this is only my\nown subjective recounting of it, but I counted six of\nwhom only one lasted, but I counted five others that\nthey had to use peremptories on that include one juror,\n29, who herself was a victim of this offense to the tune\nof $50,000 or $60,000. The judge said: I will not\nchallenge her for cause.\nI counted another, juror -- what's this one\n-- juror number -- number's 74, who when he looked her\nsquare in the eye and said, \"Can you be fair?\" She said,\n\"I can't say yes for sure. No.\"\nOkay? So, in my own subjective account, there\nwere five here, maybe six, certainly three, that perhaps\nif they'd had an appeal on peremptories, which\napparently they don't, they might have said these should\nhave been challenged for cause. So I'm concerned about\nthe 5 hours, about the lack of excusal for cause, about\nthe very, very brief questions that he provided to\npeople who had said on the questionnaire they could\nbe -- they could be biased. They said we think he's\nguilty, for example.\nAnd all those are cause for concern. At the\nsame time, I'm worried about controlling too much a\ntrial judge. I've expressed those concerns. I know\nthis is a special case. Half, almost, of the jury\nquestionnaires they just threw out. And the\ncommunity -- you know all the arguments there. You see\nwhat's worrying me. And I'm worried about a fair trial\nin this instance and to say -- and I'm genuinely worried,\nand -- and I'd like to hear your response to the kind of\nthing I'm bringing up.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Breyer, I think\nthat there was a fair trial in this case, and I think\nthat a full reading of the voir dire reveals that\nindividuals sitting from this vantage point with a cold\nrecord who were not there may have different viewpoints\nabout --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'd never heard of an\ninstance where a trial judge would not challenge for\ncause -- but I'm not saying it doesn't happen -- where the\njuror herself is a victim of the offense to the tune of\n$50,000 to $60,000. See, we are getting into an area that\nI'm not familiar with, but I think that that's not\nsupposed to be.\nMR. DREEBEN: I don't think that there's\nany per se disqualification. But even if there was,\nthat juror did not sit, and this Court held in\nUnited States v. Martinez-Salazar that one of the\npurposes of peremptories is to protect against the\noccasional accidental error.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How -- but is it\noccasional or accidental? I think that's what Justice\nBreyer is getting at. With such a truncated voir dire\nand one in which the judge basically said to the lawyers,\nI'm not giving you much leeway at all, how can we be\nsatisfied that there was a fair and impartial jury picked\nwhen the judge doesn't follow up on a witness who says,\nI'm a victim of this fraud? I don't know -- I would find\nit strange that we would permit jurors who are victims of\nthe crime to serve as jurors.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, none sat in this case.\nI don't think there is any claim that they did.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, but -- but the judge\ndidn't strike her for cause. So isn't that symptomatic\nof not following through adequately?\nMR. DREEBEN: I don't think that a -- what\nthis Court may perceive as an error in the denial of one\nfor-cause challenge --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, but it's not just one.\nThere were like five, of which I have given you the\nworst, and they had to use up all their peremptories.\nAnd they can't appeal this. And it's that taken\ntogether, plus the one who sat, juror 11, provides, as\nthey point out for the reasons they say, some cause for\nconcern. And that's what I'm trying to get at.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Breyer, I think\nthat reading the entire voir dire reflects that the\njudge was interested in determining whether these jurors\nwere qualified to sit. He was not interested in having\nthe voir dire used as a lobbying or a argumentative\nexercise by the lawyers. And as a result, he relied on\nthe very extensive questionnaires to pinpoint the\nexamples of areas in which further questioning was\nnecessary. And then he went and he, I think, did fairly\nallow sufficient inquiry into whether these jurors could\nsit. And I think one of the best examples of that is\nactually juror number 63, who Petitioner says was not\nproperly voir-dired. And I think what juror number 63\nillustrates -- and this is in the Joint Appendix at page\n935a and then following -- is that, as this Court has\nremarked many times, the question of --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Excuse me. What was the\npage? Nine --\nMR. DREEBEN: 935a. This is in volume 2 of\nthe Joint Appendix.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Go ahead with it, but they\ndidn't challenge 63 for cause, so I guess they waived\nit.\nMR. DREEBEN: They did not challenge 63 for\ncause, but they -- but they came to this Court today and\ntried to use 63 as an object lesson of what was wrong\nwith the voir dire. I actually think juror 63\nillustrates not only what was right with the voir dire,\nbut the immense distortion that Petitioners have\nattempted to perpetrate by putting together effectively\na highlight reel of every bad headline in every Houston\npublication and claiming that the entire jurisdiction,\nall 4.5 million people virtually, were infected with\nsome sort of a pervasive prejudice that could not be\nferreted out in voir dire.\nIf you look at what happened in juror number\n63, she happens to be a 24-year-old who comes to court.\nShe filled out a questionnaire that she said: I can be\nimpartial. She did have the statement: I -- I think that\nprobably Skilling is guilty of some crime. When the\nvoir dire proceeds, it turns out that she's not one of\nthese jurors who has been in the Houston culture\npervasively exposed to what Petitioner says is\nprejudicial publicity. She was living in Austin at the\ntime, going to school.\nThen she's asked, \"Are you watching major\nnetworks?\" And she says, \"No, I don't really watch the\nnews at all. I'm a turtle person.\"\n\"Do you recall anything that may have --\nyou've seen -- that you may have seen or heard on\ntelevision about this case?\" \"No.\"\nAnd then the judge, after some more questioning\nabout her that reveals that, among other things, Ken Lay\nis a member of the country club that her parents belong\nto, he asks her about the very question that Petitioners\nfocus on as problematic: \"Do you have any opinion about\nthe guilt or innocence -- and you say, I think they probably\nwere breaking the law?\"\nAnd her answer is: \"I don't know. The only\nthing I can say is, anything I've ever heard even\nperipherally has not been, you know -- but that's what\npeople say and, I mean, it's hard to know. People don't\nknow what they are talking about.\"\nAnd the judge says, \"Well, I'm just trying\nto find out what you think.\" She says, \"I don't have an\nopinion either way.\"\nJUSTICE BREYER: Let's try juror number --\nlet's try 76: Judge: \"Here's the detail that really\nconcerns me. You said, 'I think they're all guilty.'\"\n\"Right.\"\n\"Now, there's nothing wrong with thinking\nthat, if that's what you really think. You just need to\ntell us that.\"\n\"Okay.\"\n\"That's what you think, isn't it?\"\n\"It's been a long time since I answered that\nquestionnaire.\"\n\"Right. Now, as you\" --\nOkay? Now, that's -- that, as far as I could tell,\nis as close as I can get to a recantation of what she\nthought originally.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Breyer, this\nCourt has recognized -- and it has recognized this as\nlong ago as Chief Justice Marshall in the Burr case --\nthat people come to court with opinions in highly\npublicized cases. We expect our jurors to be somewhat\ninformed of civic affairs. They receive information\nthrough the media or through their friends, and they have\nlight opinions. And they come to court, and the trial\njudge instructs them: This is a legal proceeding; you're\ngoing to hear evidence in court. What happened\noutside of the courtroom no longer matters. What\nmatters is what has been presented in here. I'm going\nto instruct you that defendants have a presumption of\ninnocence. Can you follow that?\nAnd then the judge is the only person on the\nscene. We're not there, the court of appeals is not\nthere; the judge is the only person on the scene to\njudge the jurors' inflection, the jurors' demeanor, the\njurors' apprehension of the seriousness of the duty.\nAnd this Court has held that the standard for review of\na determination of no removable bias for cause is\nmanifest error.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Were -- were these\ncolloquies that are reported, the -- the pages we have\njust been reviewing, heard by the entire jury pool?\nMR. DREEBEN: They were not --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Or were they just -- where\nthe person -- the juror was standing in front of the bench\nfor this?\nMR. DREEBEN: That's correct, Justice\nKennedy. This was not a case like Mu'Min, where in your\nconcurrence -- your dissent, you pointed out that the\ncolloquy occurred in the full presence of the -- of\nevery other juror, and there was no individualized voir\ndire. Here there was individualized voir dire. Judge\nLake had that juror right in front of him, eyeball to\neyeball, and was able to make the kind of credibility\nassessment, taking into account all of the context, that\nno other judge can do.\nAnd it's not to say that there's no judicial\nreview of that on appeal. In the Irvin case, Irvin v.\nDowd, which is really the Court's first case in this\nline, the Court noticed that there -- 90 percent of the\njurors had an opinion that the defendant was guilty. It\ninvolved a highly sensationalized murder in rural\ncounties in southern Indiana. There was a barrage of\npretrial publicity. Eight of the 12 jurors said they had\nan opinion that the defendant was guilty.\nThe Court, after meticulously reviewing the\nvoir dire, concluded that the judge had committed\nmanifest error in accepting the representations of the\njurors that they could be impartial. But this is\nnothing like that.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's hard for me to think\nthat the voir dire would have been much shorter even if\nthere had been no showing of pervasive prejudice.\nMR. DREEBEN: I think that what Judge --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Five hours sounds to me\nabout standard for a case of this difficulty.\nMR. DREEBEN: I -- I think that's not\nnecessarily correct at all, and it would not have been\nthe case that in a normal trial there would have been as\ndetailed a 14-page questionnaire as there was in this\ncase, that was designed to elicit any and all\nconnections to Enron.\nNow, whether there may have been some\nindividualized mistakes along the way, whether some of\nus would have preferred that the voir dire be more\nextensive, is not the issue; and unless this Court is\nprepared to set standards that are based either on a\nstopwatch or some sort of, you know, notion of how many\ndays voir dire has to occur, it's going to be very\ndifficult to administer a standard that says this was\ntoo little.\nThe Oklahoma City bombing case, it is true,\ntook many, many days, but that was a capital case, and I\nknow that this Court is well familiar that there are\nnumerous --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It took many\ndays after it had been transferred.\nMR. DREEBEN: It did, and Denver itself was\nexposed, probably almost as much as Oklahoma City, to\nthe pretrial publicity, and a terrorist act of that\nmagnitude, Mr. Chief Justice, really strikes at the\nheart of the entire nation. Judge Matsch, who sits in\nDenver --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It was very -- the\natmosphere in Oklahoma City was very different from that\nanywhere else, in terms of the impact of the bombing on\nthat particular community.\nMR. DREEBEN: Agreed. It was 168 deaths.\nMany of them were children. There was a sense of -- of\nvictimization in the part of the community that I don't\nthink is comparable to what happened with a financial\nmeltdown in Houston, a 4.5 million city with a robust\neconomy and a trial that took place 4 years later,\nafter numerous other Enron trials had already taken\nplace in Houston, resulting in favorable verdicts for\ndefendants, mistrials, acquittals of one defendant.\nThis very trial itself of Mr. Skilling\nresulted in nine acquittals on insider trading counts.\nNow, if you would think that the jury had some sort of\na substratum of subterranean bias that was ineradicable by\nthe conventional techniques of voir dire that we have been\nusing for 200 years, then insider trading where the\ndefendant pockets personally, as a result of the\nexploitation of insider information -- you would think\nthat would be the first place the jurors would go to vent --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, no, no. No.\nThey'd go to the statute that says honest services --\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. It seems --\nit seems -- I'm being flip. It seems that that's where\nyou would focus your attention, if you think your community\nhas essentially been fleeced by somebody because of his\ndishonesty.\nMR. DREEBEN: I don't think so,\nMr. Chief Justice, because the honest services component\nactually, and the component of this trial, was really a\nsubset of the securities fraud. The essential gravamen\nof Petitioner's crimes were lying to Enron, lying to its\nshareholders about the health of the company in a\nfinancial sense, when, in fact, he knew that he had been\nengaging in numerous manipulations of earnings and\nschemes that are detailed in the briefs, in order to\navoid Enron having to recognize that portions of its\nbusiness were imploding.\nAnd the victimization was of shareholders.\nThat was expressed through securities fraud; it was\nexpressed through insider trading. There were counts\ninvolving liars -- lying to auditors, and one object of a\nmulti-count conspiracy charge involved an honest services\nobject as well as a money or property fraud object, and\nas well as a securities fraud object.\nNow, in our view Petitioner has essentially\nconceded that the honest services statute is not vague\nas applied and, therefore, facially unconstitutional. He\nall but acknowledges that bribes and kickbacks, which\nconstitute the bulk of pre-McNally honest services\ncases, can be defined with precision. There is not an\nunconstitutional vagueness in it. And so I think at a\nminimum --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, a concession that a\nbribe or a kickback scheme statute would not be vague is\nhardly a concession that this statute as written is not\nvague. In fact, I thought that was the point. The\npoint is that the Court shouldn't rewrite the statute;\nthat's for the Congress to do.\nMR. DREEBEN: I don't think that in this\ncase, Justice Kennedy, the Court needs to rewrite the\nstatute so much as to recognize that what happened in\nMcNally was this Court said that the mail fraud statute\nhas two clauses, scheme to defraud and scheme for\nobtaining money or property by false representations and\npretenses. The government's position, in accordance with\nall of the lower courts, was that these two clauses set\nforth two separate crimes. Scheme to defraud was not\nlimited to money or property. This Court disagreed, and\nit said, oh, yes, it was.\nAnd what Congress did in responding was to\ninvoke words that had appeared in this Court's decision\nin McNally, in the dissent written by Justice Stevens,\nin the lower court opinions, and intentionally -- as\nthis Court put it in Cleveland v. United States -- cover\none of the intangible rights that the lower courts had recognized\nbefore McNally, and that was the right to -- intangible\nright of honest services. And in the context of the\npre-McNally honest services cases, that was well known\nto include at its core the bribery and kickback cases\nand, in the additional category, nondisclosure of a\npersonal, conflicting, substantial interest.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, suppose you have a\nstatute that -- that makes it criminal to -- to do any\nbad thing, okay? Now it's clear that murder would be\ncovered. All right? Nobody would say that murder is\nnot covered by that. Does -- does that make the statute\nnon-vague?\nMR. DREEBEN: No, Justice Scalia, but --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, just because you can\npick something that everybody would agree comes within a\ndenial of honest services, doesn't -- doesn't mean that\nwhen you say nothing but honest services, you're saying\nsomething that -- that has sufficient content to -- to\nsupport a criminal prosecution.\nMR. DREEBEN: But this is not like a\nstatute, Justice Scalia, that says prohibiting any bad\nthing. It's a statute that responded to a decision of\nthis Court in which a term of art, the intangible\nright of honest services, featured prominently. And\nCongress has --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And there were cases that\n-- that -- some of which included bribery, but others of\nwhich included a variety of -- of other actions, some of\nwhich were allowed by some courts and some of which\nwere disallowed by some courts. There was no solid\ncontent to what McNally covered.\nMR. DREEBEN: I think that there was a solid\nenough content for this Court to be able to respond to\nthe McNally decision by giving shape to the crime in\naccordance with the paradigm cases that the lower courts\nhad done and logical implications of those cases, just\nas if it had concluded, in accordance with Justice\nStevens's dissent, that the statute did protect\nintangible rights in the phrase \"scheme to defraud.\"\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But if -- if you're\ngoing to say that the statute refers to a term of art,\nthe whole point of a term of art is that it's a shorthand\nfor defining something. And then -- but if you're\nsaying that it's a term of art that means the\npre-McNally case law over the -- you know, all the\ndifferent circuits and the district courts and that some\nknowledge of that, it -- it's descriptive of\nsomething, but it's not a term of art.\nMR. DREEBEN: I think it's a term of art in\nthe sense that it referred to a -- a body of law that\nuntil quite recently, when defendants began making\nvagueness arguments, was understood to refer to the kinds\nof schemes that had been prosecuted before this Court\nheld that \"scheme to defraud\" was limited to money or\nproperty. And it --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I'm with you\nthere. But then the kinds of cases -- that's where it\ngets fuzzy. I mean, you need lawyers and research\nbefore you get an idea of what the pre-McNally state of\nlaw was with respect to intangible -- the right to\nintangible services, of honest services. And I'm just\nwondering how clear does what that body of law is have\nto be before you can say, you know what, when we tell\nyou that right, you know that that's what it's referring\nto?\nMR. DREEBEN: I think it's clear enough at\nthe core, this Court can say so and can provide\ndefinition, and it can use its standard tools of\ninterpretation of criminal statutes to dispose of cases\nthat are at the periphery and ensure that there is --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It kind of -- it\nputs the prospective defendant, I guess, in an awfully\ndifficult position, though, if he has got to wait.\nThere's this common law evolution over time. You have\ntwo cases the government wins, one it loses, three --\nand he's supposed to keep track of that. That doesn't\nsound like fair notice of what's criminal.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I\ndon't think it puts a defendant in a very bad position\nat all, because this statute is only triggered when\nthere's an intent to deceive, an intentional fraudulent\nact taken to deprive the victim of whatever right exists\nin question.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What was -- Mr. Dreeben,\nwhat was the jury told when this honest services count\nwas given to the jury? What was -- what were they told\nwas the definition --\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, the jury instruction,\nJustice Ginsburg, appears on page 1086a of the Joint\nAppendix. That's in volume 3 of the Joint Appendix.\nAnd I will describe the jury instruction, too, but I\nwant to say at the outset that this jury instruction was\ndrafted against the background of Fifth Circuit law,\nwhich I think did take a somewhat broader view of the\nhonest services crime than the government has taken in\nthis Court, and it has to be read against that\nbackground.\nBut the -- the instruction said that \"to show\nthat defendants deprived Enron and its shareholders of\ntheir right of honest services, the government must prove\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that, in rendering some\nparticular service or services, the defendant knew that\nhis actions were not in the best interests of Enron and\nits shareholders or that he consciously contemplated or\nintended such actions, and that Enron and its\nshareholders suffered a detriment from the defendant's\nbreach of his duty to render honest services.\"\nSo -- and this was against a background --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But it's circular, isn't\nit?\nMR. DREEBEN: The -- I would agree,\nJustice Scalia. I've read this phrase many times, and\nit does seem a little circular to me.\nThe introduction to this jury instruction says,\n\"Honest services are the services required by the defendant's\nfiduciary duty to Enron and its shareholders under State law.\"\nSo this was tried in a circuit that followed the State law\nprinciple that's at issue in the Weyhrauch case. The\ngovernment defined the fiduciary duty in that way.\nBut the essence of the fraud was that -- that Petitioner\nhad a fiduciary duty to the shareholders of Enron to act\nin their best interests, and he betrayed that by acting\ncontrary to the best interests of the shareholders,\nfraudulently upholding the price, and ultimately that\nconstituted the crime.\nNow, I think there's a --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that covers the\ncase that your friend put of the employee using the\ncomputer for personal use? That fits under this\ninstruction?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, whether the employee had\na fiduciary duty in that respect would be, I think, quite\na litigable question. This case doesn't involve any\nsubtle or arcane fiduciary duty. This is one of the\nbasic fiduciary duties that any chief executive has, not\nto lie to shareholders about the financial condition of\nthe company.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm sorry. The duty of an\nemployee to provide honest services to his employer --\nthat's not included because the employee is not a\nfiduciary?\nMR. DREEBEN: Not all employees are\nfiduciaries, no, Justice Scalia. I mean, most\nfiduciaries have a sort of heightened duty towards\nthe --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where do you get the\nfiduciary limitation?\nMR. DREEBEN: I think that it's inherent\nin that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: All it says is \"honest\nservices.\" I would think that --\nMR. DREEBEN: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- any employee has the\nobligation to provide honest services.\nMR. DREEBEN: I think, Justice Scalia, that\nyou cannot successfully attempt to understand Congress's\nreaction to this Court's decision in McNally without\nsome cognizance of the McNally decision and the\npreexisting law.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What authority do I look\nto, to see that some employees are fiduciaries and\nothers are not?\nMR. DREEBEN: That would be a standard\nagency law principle, Justice Kennedy, and --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If I look in the\nRestatement of Agency, and they have a section that\napplies to fiduciaries and non-fiduciaries, both of whom\nare employees?\nMR. DREEBEN: Normally, Justice Kennedy, no\nsuch complexities are necessary, and I think that this\nCourt can resolve this case without introducing such\ncomplexities, because the core duties of loyalty that\nhave formed the core of the honest services prosecutions\nare universal. They are equally applicable to agency.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I would assume that any\nemployee, even at the lowest level of the corporate\nstructure, who has corporate property, a car or something,\nhas a duty to protect that car for the employer.\nMR. DREEBEN: But that's not an honest\nservices case. The honest services cases are about\nconflicting interests and the misuse of official\nposition.\nI'm not even sure, in the personal computer\nuse case, that the government could successfully show\nthat the employee had misused his official position.\nThis case is quite typical in that respect. Petitioner\nabsolutely misused his official position to serve what\nwe say was his private interest in private gain.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Were there any pre-McNally\ncases that involved a situation like this, where the\nbenefit to the employee was in the form of the\nemployee's disclosed compensation?\nMR. DREEBEN: There were not to my\nknowledge, Justice Alito, and I would frankly\nacknowledge that this case is a logical extension of the\nbasic principle that we have urged the Court to adopt in\nthe nondisclosure cases. And the Court can evaluate\nwhether it believes that that is legitimately within the\nscope of an honest services violation or not. But it\nshould not obscure our fundamental submission, which is\nthat there was a definable category of undisclosed\nconflict of interest cases, that a person furthered\nthrough his official actions that constituted\nhonest services fraud. A good example of that is United\nStates v. Keane, which was a Seventh Circuit decision.\nPetitioner, in his reply brief, claims that\nKeane involved financial injury to Chicago as a result\nof an alderman's concealment of his interest in\nproperties that the City was selling. Actually there\nwere three separate schemes in Keane. In one of them,\nthe court was quite clear that, even though the alderman\ngot the same deal that every member of the public would\nhave gotten, it still was honest services fraud because\nhe did not disclose his financial interest in that\nproperty to the council when the council was voting on\nit.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could I -- the following\nhypothetical: I'm a councilperson in a jurisdiction\nthat's considering a tax increase or a tax break, and I\nvote for the tax break, and I happen to have property\nthat qualifies. Is that a breach of the statute?\nMR. DREEBEN: It may well be, Justice\nSotomayor. It depends, I think, on whether the tax break\nwas something that basically all general members of the\npublic were in a position to benefit from, which may\nwell be the case if it's just a private residence,\nversus if it's a particularized business property\ninterest that you have either acquired --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Please tell me what I\nlook to, to discern -- if I'm a councilperson, to discern\nwhat needs to be disclosed or not disclosed?\nMR. DREEBEN: I think in the first instance,\nyou will inevitably, as a councilperson, turn to your\nlocal law. And I think this brings up an important point\nthat was discussed in the Weyhrauch decision, which is\nthat the mail fraud statute does not criminalize\nbreaches of duty without more. There has to be a\nshowing of scienter, of a mens rea element of intent to\ndeceive. And unless the government can point to\nsomething which shows that the individual knew that they had\na duty to disclose and did not do that --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So could --\nMR. DREEBEN: -- or -- if I could just\nfinish this part of the answer -- or can point to\ncircumvention-type activity, using of shell companies to\nconceal an interest, then the government is not going to\nbe able to have an indictable case on honest services\nfraud. And I think what --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That doesn't give me a\nwhole lot of comfort, I mean, just because there's an\nintent to deceive. An intent to deceive can be the basis\nfor -- for terminating a contract. There's -- there's\nbeen fraud in the inducement or something of that sort.\nSo I know I'm liable to have the contract terminated, and\nmaybe for damages for the contract. And you say: And also,\nby the way, you know, you can go to jail for a number of\nyears, because, oh, yes, it's very vague, but you\nintended to deceive, and that's all -- that's all you need\nto know.\nMR. DREEBEN: But this Court has recognized\nin numerous cases, Justice Scalia, that a mens rea\nelement requiring an intent to deceive, an intent to\nviolate the law, is exactly what helps prevent statutes\nthat might otherwise be considered too vague from\nfalling --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You can -- well, you focus\non what you just put together. You said intent to deceive,\nintent to violate the law. I believe in another case,\nyou're saying they don't have to have an intent to violate\nthe law because there was no State law that prohibited\nwhatever was at issue.\nSo is the government now saying -- which is a\nbig difference -- that you cannot convict somebody unless\nthey know, i.e., they intend to violate a law that\nforbids the conduct in which they are engaging, other\nthan this honest services law, or are you not saying\nthat?\nMR. DREEBEN: I'm not saying that,\nJustice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You're not saying that.\nMR. DREEBEN: I'm saying that in the\nordinary case --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then if you're not saying\nthat, what the person has to carry around with them\nis an agency treatise.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, I think that what\nhappens, Justice Breyer, is that unless the government\ndoes have some sort of legal platform like that to show\nthat there was knowledge of a duty, it's not possible\nfor the government to bring its proof to the court and\nestablish that the individual acted with the requisite\nmens rea, unless there is activity that reveals an\nintent to circumvent the law and to withhold the\ninformation, as in Justice Sotomayor's example,\ninformation about a property interest that might well\naffect the deliberations of the council. And that kind\nof evidence often requires use of offshore accounts --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, I mean, of course they\nintend to -- it's not the case that is obvious; it's the\ncase that is not obvious that worries me, and --\nMR. DREEBEN: I don't see any of those --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- in the case that\nis not obvious, of course they intend to withhold\ninformation. I agree with that. But the problem is\nthey don't know it's unlawful to do so.\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Breyer, I think if you\nlook at the cases in which this has happened, there is --\nthere's not like a deliberation on somebody's part -- oh, do\nI have to disclose or not disclose? What these cases are,\nare really outright criminal conduct in the form of\nconflicting interests that every fiduciary knows you\nneed to disclose this before you take official action to\nfurther that interest. That --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Dreeben, would you\nclarify the issue that came up: Is the government's\ntheory focused simply on the compensation or does it\ninvolve the sale of shares?\nMR. DREEBEN: It involves the sale of shares\nas well. That was part of the compensation, and it's\nlinked to it. But, Justice Ginsburg, if you look at the\ngovernment's opening statement in this case, the\ngovernment opened by saying, \"You will see that\ndefendants Lay and Skilling knew few -- a few key facts\nabout the true condition of Enron, facts that the investing\npublic did not know. With that information, defendants\nLay and Skilling sold tens of millions of dollars of\ntheir own Enron stock.\"\nAnd then continued: \"When an investor buys a\nshare of stock, an investor buys some rights in a\npublicly traded company. When an investor buys a share\nof stock, they buy the right to hear and receive truth\nfrom the chief executive officer. And, importantly, they\nbuy the right to have their interests placed ahead of\nthe chief executor officer every day of the week.\"\nSo there was, baked into this case at the\noutset, the notion that these officials were not acting\nin the best interests of the shareholders. They were\nfurthering their own interests by maintaining a high\nstock price so that they could profit from it.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Srinivasan, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice.\nA couple of quick points on the honest\nservices fraud issue, and then a couple of points on the\njuror issue, if I might.\nWith respect to honest services fraud, first\nof all, I think that the government pointed to the jury\ninstruction -- and, Justice Ginsburg, this goes to some\nquestions that you had raised -- I think what's clear from\nthe capacious nature of the jury instruction that was issued\nin this case is that the elements that the government say\nmake Jeff Skilling guilty of honest services fraud weren't\nput before the jury or required to be found by the jury.\nAnd for that reason alone, the conviction against Jeff\nSkilling ought to be overturned.\nAnother point I'd make very quickly with\nrespect to the sweep of the government's theory\nconcerning the workplace is, under our understanding,\nthe duty of loyalty does extend to all employees. It\ndoes, and, therefore, the theory that they assert should\napply in this case, I think, has devastating\nimplications for workplace relations.\nNow, with respect to the juror question, a\ncouple of preliminary points, and then I'd like to\nwalk the Court through just one aspect of the voir dire\nwhich I think exhibits the manifest flaws in the process\nthe trial court conducted.\nWith respect to the question about the\nissuance of questionnaires, questionnaires were also\nissued in the Timothy McVeigh case. But I don't want to\nlimit our comparison to Timothy McVeigh, because I think\nin response to some of the questions that were raised, I\ndon't want to leave an impression that a multiple-day\nvoir dire with the sort of extensive questioning that we\nthink was required here is not in use in other cases\nthat involve like crimes.\nIn the Martha Stewart case, for example,\nwhich was a financial case, there were 6 days of voir\ndire and after a questionnaire was issued. And in that\ncase, the only reason you needed an extended voir dire\nwas because of the celebrity status of the defendant.\nYou didn't have the deep-seated community passion and\nprejudice that characterized the Houston venue in this\ncase.\nSo, I think it's not at all unusual to have\nthat kind of extended voir dire, and, in fact, we would\nsay it's absolutely necessary to assure that the\ndefendant receives the fair and impartial jury to which\nhe's entitled.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So either this was too\nlittle or Martha Stewart was too much?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I think the former\nrather than the latter --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but it's -- it's\na different model of it. As Mr. Dreeben was explaining,\nif you have an experienced judge who goes through this\nall the time, I think it's reasonable for him to say: Look,\nbring the person in front of me. We've got a questionnaire.\nI can identify the problems, look him in the eye, and I've\ngot a lot of experience picking a jury, and it's better to\nlet me do it than to have the lawyers have 3 weeks to do it.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, you don't necessarily\nneed all of that, Your Honor, but I think with respect\nto the way in which the district court, in fact,\nconducted this voir dire, if I could just take -- if I\ncould just direct the Court's attention to one juror in\nparticular -- and, Justice Breyer, this is -- maps onto\nsome of the points you were making. This is juror 61,\nand the relevant exchange is at pages 931a to 932a of\nthe Joint Appendix, which is at -- in -- in volume 2.\nAnd I think the way the trial court\nconducted the voir dire in this case exhibits the\nmanifest flaws in his approach generally. This is\nsomeone who at page 932a, it's revealed, answered the\nquestion whether she was angry, whether there was anger\nabout Enron, with yes, quote -- it was, quote, \"based out\nof greed, hurt a lot of innocent people.\"\nAnd to paint the picture more fully, the\nperson was also asked: Do you have an opinion about the\ncollapse of Enron? To which the answer was, quote, \"Yes,\ncriminal, caused a huge shock wave which the entire\ncommunity felt,\" close quote.\nNow, at 931a at the top, she was asked the\nquestion whether she had the opinion about Mr. Lay and\nher answer was, quote, \"Shame on him.\"\nAnd then much of this was put before her in\nthe course of the voir dire. In the middle of page\n932a, the first answer -- she's asked the question: \"Can\nyou presume as you start this trial that Mr. Lay is\ninnocent?\" The answer is, \"I hope so, but you know, I\ndon't know. I can't honestly answer that one way or\nanother.\"\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then on 932, she does answer\nit, and says, \"He's assumed innocent.\" \"And can you\nconscientiously carry out that assumption?\" \"I could\nhonestly say I will give it my best.\"\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Not until --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And so the judge looks her\nin the eye and says -- fine.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Well, not -- not until this\nhappens first, Justice Breyer, between 932a and 933a.\nAnd so she's asked, \"So that might -- might your views\nabout Ken Lay cloud your judgment relative to criminal\nresponsibility?\"\nJUSTICE BREYER: I see. And I'll --\nMR. SRINIVASAN: And her answer is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'll read that again. But my\nquestion is, can we get a hold of these 238 questionnaires?\nAre they in the record in front of us?\nMR. SRINIVASAN: I believe that they are. I\nthink that they're certainly in the record before the court\nof appeals. So I think that they are.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. SRINIVASAN: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel.\n"
