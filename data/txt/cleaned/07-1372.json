BENNETT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nA 1993 congressional apology resolution did\nnot alter Hawaii's right to transfer its public lands or\nrepeal, by implication, prior congressional enactments\nthat it extinguish all competing claims to those lands.\nIt was, as its sponsor said at the time, a simple\napology, and no more.\nThe lands in question were the former Crown\nand government lands of the Kingdom of Hawaii. The\nRepublic of Hawaii was the successor in interest and\nownership to those lands and was recognized as such by\nthe United States. The 1898 Newlands Resolution of\nAnnexation recited that the Republic of Hawaii was\nceding the absolute fee ownership of those lands to the\nUnited States, and that that cession was accepted,\nratified and confirmed. Once the United States Congress\nso acted, all competing claims to title were\nextinguished, and under precedent going back almost\n200 years, the determinations by Congress to accept the\ncession were final and conclusive on any court.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Excuse me. Does that\nproposition settle the question whether your opponents\nhave equitable interest in the lands?\nMR. BENNETT: Your Honor, what the\nRespondents have contended from day one in this case is\nthat they have a property right in this -- in the land,\nand the Newlands Resolution conclusively settled that\nquestion. There is no property interest that could have\ncompeted with the United States as perfect title. That\nperfect title was passed to the State of Hawaii in 1959\nthrough the 1959 Hawaii Admission Act.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But would the state of\nHawaii, under Hawaii law, be entitled to take the\nposition, if it so chose, that as the new owner of the\nlands, it has a special duty as a trustee that some\nother owner might not?\nMR. BENNETT: Your Honor, the Admission Act\ngives the State the right to manage and dispose of the\nlands according to State law. So the political branches\ncertainly have the right to decide which lands they are\ngoing to use for which of the five purposes --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But then -- then it's just\na question of whether the Hawaiian Supreme Court --\nassuming that it made the decision that I hypothetically\nstated -- whether the Hawaiian Supreme Court, as opposed\nto Hawaiian legislature, could make the determination of\nwhether or not there is some special trust obligation\nimposed on the State of Hawaii by reason of its own\nduties.\nMR. BENNETT: But, Your Honor, in this case\nwhat Respondents urged was that the Apology Resolution\nchanged the legal landscape and commanded the State to\nhold these lands possibly in perpetuity without\nalienation. The Hawaii Supreme Court specifically found\nthat the Apology Resolution dictated the results here,\nthat plaintiffs claims did not even arise until the\nApology Resolution was signed into law by President\nClinton. In addition, the plaintiffs -- the Respondents\nurged upon the Hawaii Supreme Court a property right, a\nproperty and ownership interest in these lands. Even if\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But, General Bennett, if\nI understand correctly, looking to your question\npresented, the only thing before us is the effect of the\nApology Resolution. The question presented doesn't say\nanything about the Admissions Act or the Newlands\nResolution. So shouldn't we just stick to the question\nas you presented it? Whatever the picture is, does the\nApology Resolution have any substantive effect?\nMR. BENNETT: Your Honor, that certainly is\none question before the Court, but we believe fairly\nincluded in that question is the issue of the nature of\nthe State sovereign authority. The question presented\ntalks about whether the Apology Resolution changed in\nany way the State's sovereign authority, and that\nquestion -- certainly interior and predicate to an\nintelligent resolution of that question is the nature of\nthe State sovereign.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why is it necessary? Why\nisn't it sufficient just to say that this resolution has\nno substantive effect, period, and then remand to the\nHawaii Supreme Court?\nMR. BENNETT: Because, Your Honor, the\nHawaii Supreme Court's decision also rests on a premise\nforeclosed by Federal law, that is that there are\ncompeting claims to title. As late as page 18 of the\nred brief, Respondents even say now that Native\nHawaiians are entitled to these lands as a matter of\nproperty law, but they do not say anywhere in the red\nbrief how that property law claim arises or how that\nproperty law claim could survive the Newlands\nResolution, the Hawaii Organic Act, or the Admission\nAct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: General, the difficulty I\nhave is that not only do they not say, so the Supreme\nCourt of Hawaii didn't say so either. And it seems to\nme that we would be well advised to make sure that we\nunderstand the reasoning of the Supreme Court of Hawaii\nbefore we start talking about the relationship between\nthe various Federal statutes and whatever this claim may\nbe. I simply don't understand the claim myself.\nI do understand your point, because I think\nthis much is clear from the Hawaiian opinion: That they\nthink the Apology Resolution seriously affects the\nclaim. That we can deal with, but once we get out of\nthat, the -- the whole case seems murky to me. Am I\nmissing something?\nMR. BENNETT: Well, Your Honor, the Hawaii\nSupreme Court, at page 69a of the appendix for the\npetition, says that this was a claim seeking an\ninjunction -- injunctive relief with regard to property\nrights. At page 87a of the petition appendix, the\nHawaii Supreme Court said there are questions regarding\nthe title to the State's ceded lands.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There -- there may well\nbe, but then the Hawaii Supreme Court chose its grounds,\nand it said at one point the resolution dictates the\npreservation of the ceded lands. At another place it\nsaid that Federal law provides the basis for its\ndecision and that State trust law is interwoven with\nthat Federal law. It also said that Federal law grounds\nthe decision and provides the governing legal standards.\nNow, they could not have been clearer. They\nrepeated at least five times that their decision rested\non the resolution, that everything turned on that\nresolution having substantive effect. That's why they\nsaid that their decision was driven by Federal law. And\nI don't know why we shouldn't take the Hawaii Supreme\nCourt at its word repeated so many times.\nMR. BENNETT: Well, Your Honor, we believe\nthat Respondents' attempt to trivialize this Court's\njurisdiction -- they say, for example, in the brief in\nopposition that even if this Court were to reverse, the\nHawaii Supreme Court will simply reinstate the exact\nsame decision, and presumably they would press upon the\ncourt the exact parameters they've pressed for 14 years\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: We don't --\nMR. BENNETT: -- that is --\nJUSTICE BENNETT: We don't know that for\nsure. It may well be, but there is a large -- large\ndifference, and if they're relying on Federal ground\nthat insulates them from any checks by the Hawaii\npolity, but if they are forced to rely on State law,\nthen it's up to the people of Hawaii whether they like\nit or not. They could change the State statutory law,\nequitable notion, constitutional law. But by doing what\nthe Hawaii Supreme Court did, they have taken the case\nout of the realm of State law, subject to the political\ncheck, put it on Federal grounds.\nSo I think that that's what -- the issue\nproperly before this Court, and not anything about the\ninterpretation of the Admissions Act, which -- if it's\nimplicit in your question, it's a little hard to see.\nOrdinarily, if a party wants us to address the effects\nof a piece of legislation, they will mention that in the\nquestion presented.\nMR. BENNETT: Your Honor, I agree that this\ndecision clearly rests on Federal grounds, but we would\nalso suggest that the question presented talks about\nwhether the State's sovereign authority is stripped, and\nthe State's sovereign authority, we would submit, is\nclear.\nThe United States had perfect title. The\nState of Hawaii succeeded to the United States perfect\ntitle. Respondents do not suggest that anywhere in\ntheir pleadings why that is not so, or why they continue\nto press even with this Court this property right claim\nto these lands. And so we would suggest that it would\nbe prudent for the Court to address what we believe is\nthe fairly included question of the nature of the\nState's sovereign authority, especially as it would\nappear to be entirely not subject to contravention by\nthe Respondents.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm not sure it\nwould be prudent when the great bulk of the opinion is\nbased on the Apology Resolution. And I -- I certainly\ndo think you have a powerful argument if the Apology\nResolution presents us with a Federal question. But the\nmore far-reaching question -- I just inferred --\nsuggests -- might not even be very specifically within\nthe question presented, and even if it's fairly\nembraced, you used the word \"prudent.\" It seems prudent\nfor us to confine our decision to the effect of the\nApology Resolution and whether or not the Hawaiian\nSupreme Court got that part of that right.\nMR. BENNETT: Well, with -- with respect,\nYour Honor, the Court could limit its ruling, but in a\ncase that has been gone on for 14 years and which, in\nvirtually every pleading, the Respondents have filed\nthey have asserted essentially that the State lacks\ntitle to these lands because the United States lacked\ntitle, the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii was\nillegal, and that's the precise reason for 14 years the\nState has either been through an injunction or, as a\npractical matter, not been able to alienate its lands,\nthat this Court certainly has the ability for a question\nthat we believe --\nJUSTICE ALITO: If the Apology Resolution is\nput aside, I'm not quite sure what is left, other than\nState-law issues.\nMR. BENNETT: Well, what's left --\nJUSTICE ALITO: You could -- would there be\nanything to prevent the Hawaiian legislature from\npassing a law that says, we have absolute -- we have\ntitle to these lands, but we are going to impose a\nfive-year moratorium on any transfer of these lands\nbecause we want to promote a reconciliation process?\nMR. BENNETT: Your Honor, certainly under\nthe terms of the Admission Act, the authority given the\npolitical branches for the management and disposition of\nthe lands is broad and would run up against only the\nFederal common law of trust that the Ninth Circuit says\ngoverns --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But that's not what the\nHawaiian Supreme Court said. I am reading from page 98a\nof the petition appendix, the concluding portion of the\nopinion. \"We hold, number one, that the Apology\nResolution and related state legislation give rise to\nthe state's fiduciary duty.\"\nThe only Federal statute mentioned is the\nApology Resolution, and the rest of their reasoning\nseems to rest upon some kind of State equity law or\ntrust law. Now, that trust law may ultimately be\ninconsistent with prior Federal acts, but the only --\nthe only thing they are disclosing right now is -- aside\nfrom the Apology Resolution, seems to be State trust\nlaw.\nMR. BENNETT: Well, Your Honor, the Hawaii\nSupreme Court did say that this is an injunction based\non property rights. The Hawaii Supreme Court did say --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But trust law is based on\nsomebody's property rights. We don't know whether they\nare talking about legal rights or equitable rights, and\nthat's consistent with the statement I just read to you.\nMR. BENNETT: Well, Your Honor, at page 85-A\nof the appendix to the petition the Court said that the\nCongress recognized that native Hawaiians had\nunrelinquished claims to the ceded lands. And as a\nresult of that recognition the Apology Resolution\ndictated the entry of this injunction.\nWe believe that clearly that is not so, but\nthat this idea of unrelinquished claims is an\nunrelinquished property-right claim. This is what was\nurged upon the Hawaii Supreme Court at every stage.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But, General, I think --\nwith respect, I still don't know what the position of\nthe Hawaiian Supreme Court is going to be if this Court\nrules that the Apology Resolution does not support the\nproposition that you just read.\nI don't know whether at that point the\nHawaiian Supreme Court is going to say, okay, all we\nhave got left to deal with now is State trust law, or\nwhether they've got to pull another rabbit out of the\nhat and say, but there is -- there is some kind of -- of\nprior -- there is some kind of a -- a claim against\nwhich prior Federal law could not prevail.\nI don't know. And I -- that's -- that's why\nit seems to me, to -- to say the least, imprudent to\nwade into it at this point. The one thing we know that\nseems to have been significant to their decision is the\nApology Resolution. And I think we would be wise to\nstick to that.\nMR. BENNETT: Your Honor, what our response\nwould be is a simple one: That the issue of the State's\ntitle would in our view be undisputed. The United\nStates's title is perfect and indisputable, and the\nState's title is perfect and indisputable. And this\nCourt has said that one of the functions in -- in cases\nwhere respondents claim an adequate and independent\nState-law ground is to remand the case by disabusing the\nState court of incorrect notions of what Federal law\neither permits or requires.\nJUSTICE ALITO: A point on which both you\nand your adversaries seem to agree is that the Apology\nResolution really is not critical to the decision of the\nHawaii Supreme Court. Because if you thought that\nsimply taking the Apology Resolution off the books would\nprovide an acceptable outcome from your point of view,\nyou would be happy with our deciding just that narrow\nquestion. And your opponent explicitly says that the\napology resolution wasn't critical to the decision of\nthe Hawaii Supreme Court; isn't that true?\nMR. BENNETT: Yes, Your Honor, and they have\nnot asked this court to affirm.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And isn't it true that you\ndon't think that just saying the Apology Resolution did\nnot change anything would be insufficient?\nMR. BENNETT: Your Honor, because it seems\nto us clear that both the respondents and Hawaii Supreme\nCourt believe that there are property-right claims that\nthe Native Hawaiians have. And we believe those\nproperty-right claims are clearly inconsistent with\nFederal law, the Newlands Resolution, and the Admission\nAct, and that there is no reason for this Court not to\nreach such a clear claim.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But they don't say that --\nthere is nothing in the Resolution and nothing in the --\ndoes anything in the Court's opinion or the Resolution\nsay that the claims are valid? We all know they have\nclaims. They have been making claims. Is there\nanything in any document I have that says the claims are\nvalid claims? Maybe they are valid, and maybe they are\nnot.\nMR. BENNETT: The -- the only thing is the\nposition of the Respondents who assert --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Of course, they think they\nare valid.\nMR. BENNETT: But I mean --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So -- so since you have\nnormally one group thinks they are valid; another group\nthinks they are invalid. Well, here we are. Let them\nfight it out.\nAnd all we can say is that this Resolution\nof the Apology doesn't really say who's right. And if\nHawaii wants to give some more money, or whatever they\nwant to do, to the Native Hawaiians, that's their\naffair. What's the -- what's the problem?\nMR. BENNETT: Well, Your Honor, it is\ncertainly true that the Apology Resolution does not as\nRespondents state recognize the validity of any claims,\nbut federal law forecloses the validity of any claims.\nAnd we believe that that is a question that is fairly\nincluded interior to the question of whether the\nResolution stripped Hawaii of its sovereign authority.\nIt's only natural for the Court to declare what we\nbelieve is the indisputable proposition that Hawaii's\nsovereign authority is based on --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Could the Hawaiian\nLegislature pass a law saying that the Native Hawaiians\nhave claims? Those claims, because of the Federal 1950\n-- whatever it is -- are not valid any more. But that\nwas pretty unfair to them. And, therefore, what we\nthink we should do is the following. And then they pass\na whole lot of things that they think would be\nappropriate to do in light of what I just said. What\nstops that?\nMR. BENNETT: Your Honor, the -- legislature\nhas wide discretion in managing and disposing of the\nassets.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And the legislature, if\nthey had wanted to -- as I understand the Admission Act,\nit lists five purposes to any one purpose. And the\nlegislature, if it so chose, could say, we want this\nproperty -- the proceeds from this property to be for\nthe exclusive betterment of the conditions of the Native\nHawaiians. They could. It would be up to the\nlegislature to give it all to the Native Hawaiians.\nMR. BENNETT: That would not violate the\nAdmission Act, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That -- that would not?\nMR. BENNETT: That would not.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Would it violate the\nAdmission Act if the legislature had not said -- said we\nare giving it to them because we want to, because we\nthink it's a good idea. No, we are giving it to them\nbecause we think they have a right to it.\nMR. BENNETT: Your Honor-\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And we feel that we must\ngive it to them because it's theirs.\nMR. BENNETT: Your Honor, the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Would that violate the\nAdmission Act?\nMR. BENNETT: The legislature believed that\nit bettered the condition of Native Hawaiians to provide\nproceeds from land to the Native Hawaiians. The\nAdmission Act gives them that ability to do it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Did you answer my question\njust then?\nMR. BENNETT: Yes. I'd -- I'd like to --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Please, let me put my\nquestion again. Let's assume that the legislature does\nnot say, we want to give it to the Native Hawaiians\nbecause we like the Native Hawaiians or because we think\nthey deserve it; but, rather, we think we have to give\nit to the Native Hawaiians because it's theirs.\nMR. BENNETT: I think that would be contrary\nto Federal law, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think it would be.\nMR. BENNETT: Your Honor, if I -- if I may\nreserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.\nMr. Jay.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM M. JAY\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMR. JAY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThree binding Federal laws make clear that\nthe State of Hawaii has absolute fee title to the lands\nin the Federal trust and also has the power to sell\nthose lands for the purposes Congress set out in the\ntrust instrument.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What do you think on\nthe question-presented issue? Are all of the Federal\nlaws on which the Hawaii Supreme Court relied to say\nthere was a cloud on the title before the court.\nMR. JAY: We think that they have been in\nthe case from the beginning, and they -- they were\nclearly pressed in the State supreme court. And we\nthink they are fairly encompassed in the question\npresented partly because, as General Bennett said, the\n-- the questions referenced to the State's sovereign\nauthority, which necessarily includes consideration of\nthe act which made Hawaii a sovereign state, the\nAdmissions Act, is -- is a necessary antecedent to the\nresolution of that question.\nBut also the admission in the Apology\nResolution, itself, in the preamble on which the\nRespondents rely extensively goes into great detail\nabout the Newlands Resolution and the cession of\nabsolute fee and ownership by the Republic of Hawaii to\nthe United States.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, I don't see where this\nlaw -- where those laws get us. The -- the argument\nthat is made on the other side is that the Native\nHawaiians have a moral claim to these lands, not that\nthey have a property-right claim to the lands.\nAnd if the State of Hawaii, acting through\nany branch of its government -- and that is not a matter\nof concern to us -- says they have a moral claim to the\nland and, therefore, there should not be any land\ntransfers for some period of time, what's inconsistent\nwith Federal law in their doing that?\nMR. JAY: Let me answer that in two steps,\nJustice Alito. The first step is that the State's\nsupreme court permanent injunction, although Respondents\nare now saying that the claims on which -- the claims on\nwhich -- they state are moral in nature, but a permanent\ninjunction is a legal obligation and enforceable by\ncontempt.\nSo the State supreme court, by effectively\nlocking up the lands for an indeterminant period of\ntime, has treated them as -- as legally valid and has\nentered relief that is legal in nature.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is -- is it the function of\nthe Hawaiian Supreme Court to declare moral obligations?\nMR. JAY: Well, Justice --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Would there be any problem\n-- certainly there is noted the legislature deems there\nto be a moral obligation and gives the land away on that\nbasis. But do you -- do you think there -- there might\nbe some democracy problem if -- if the Supreme Court of\nHawaii goes around pronouncing moral obligations and --\nand giving away land on that basis?\nMR. JAY: Well, Justice Scalia I guess the\nsecond half to my answer to Justice Alito as well, which\nis that the State supreme court is not free as a matter\nof State trust law or otherwise to formulate obligations\nthat don't relate to the State's obligation as trustee\nof the Federal trust --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But isn't it perfectly\nclear that's a question of State law?\nMR. JAY: I don't think so, Justice Stevens,\nbecause that State law has to comply with the\nlimitations set out in section 5(f)of the Admissions\nAct. To be sure, the political branches operating as\ntrustee of the trust have broad discretion to allocate\nlands within and among the five purposes set out in\nsection 5(f).\nBut what the State can't do and what in\nparticular the State courts can't do in the name of\nformulating State trust law is to rely on considerations\nthat are all together outside the trust. In this case,\nany consideration of the unrelinquished claims of the\nNative Hawaiians would not be based on their status as\none of the beneficiaries of the trust.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Are you saying that the\nState court couldn't do it but the legislature could?\nMR. JAY: I'm saying the -- the -- no,\nJustice Stevens. The State court can't rely, nor, I\nthink, could the State legislature --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Could the legislature do\nit?\nMR. JAY: The legislature could determine\nthat the wisest use of the lands today, the way that\nwould best further -- promote the welfare of Native\nHawaiians today would be not to sell it. The\nlegislature certainly could do that and then could enact\na moratorium that was consistent with that view.\nBut what it can't do is treat it -- and this\nis the question Justice Scalia asked at the end of\nGeneral Bennett's presentation -- what the State is not\nfree to do is, based on claims by Native Hawaiians, not\nas beneficiaries of the section 5(f) trust, but based on\nconsiderations that arose before the Admissions Act was\never enacted, based on -- based on their status as\ncompeting claimants to the title of the land, give them\nan equitable, moral, or otherwise claim to lock up the\nuse of the land.\nThe theory that the Respondents advanced in\nthe state Supreme Court under the name of trust law is\nthat a trustee may not, in furtherance of a trust,\nengage in an illegal act. And that is on Joint Appendix\n141A to 143A and other places in the record. And the\nillegal act they contemplate is the continued ownership\nof the lands by the State of Hawaii. So, the State\ncannot, in ostensible furtherance of the federal trust,\nrely on State law principles that presume the illegality\nof the federal trust or the illegality --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The State power -- the\nState legislative power to act depends on the validity\nof its reasoning.\nMR. JAY: Well, Justice Stevens, the\nState -- the State has given authority to act for\nparticular purposes. And so, the purpose of the -- of\nthe -- for which the State acts is necessarily relevant.\nThe State can't act for a purpose that is not --\nJUSTICE ALITO: What is the position that\nit's -- it is imposing a moratorium on land transfers\nbecause it thinks this is the best way to promote the\ninterests of the Native Hawaiians, and part of their\nthinking is that there was an inequity done when\nabsolute title was transferred to the United States and\nthen to the State of Hawaii? Would that be a violation\nof federal law?\nMR. JAY: I think, Justice Alito, that if\nthe state made that determination with respect to the\nclassic Native Hawaiians who are defined in the\nAdmissions Act as -- as one of the present day\nbeneficiaries of the trust, and determined that it\nwas -- that that was the best way to act for the\nbetterment of Native Hawaiians, which is a permissible\ntrust purpose, that that would be permissible.\nBut for the State to act on considerations\nthat are wholly extrinsic to the trust, to treat the\nnative -- the claims of Native Hawaiians as valid, even\nthough they are -- and to assume a duty to the Native\nHawaiians that has nothing to do with the State's\nobligations as trustee of the section 5(f) trust, we\nthink that would be impermissible.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But that doesn't seem to be\nwhat the Supreme Court of Hawaii has done. The Supreme\nCourt of Hawaii, in effect, has said the land is tied up\nuntil these people who are currently negotiating, the\nState, the Native Hawaiians and -- what is it, the\nUnited Church of Christ, all come to a -- in effect, a\nresolution and a reconciliation.\nWhatever that means, it does not sound to me\nas though it is the recognition of a legal title claim\nor indeed the validity so far as courts are concerned\nwith validity of any claim the Native Hawaiians are\nmaking. They are just saying, no more land transfers\nuntil these people sit down and make up their\ndifferences.\nIsn't that all the court is saying at this\npoint?\nMR. JAY: Well, the court said,\nJustice Souter, that there is a fiduciary obligation not\nto make these land transfers at any time until this\nindeterminate point in the future which reconciliation\nis achieved.\nBut to say -- to say that that -- that they\nare not thereby pronouncing on the validity of the\ntitle, I think that is inconsistent with the Newlands\nResolution.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't the fact that you and\nI are having this exchange a pretty good indication that\nwe don't know what they meant exactly by that? The only\nthing we can be sure of is that that thought the Apology\nResolution had some legal significance. They said, you\nknow, it's required after the Apology Resolution.\nWe can say you are right or you are wrong,\nand I think we know what -- what we are talking about.\nBut to go beyond that, it seems to me, that we are\nwading into an argument that you and I can't settle\nhere.\nMR. JAY: Well, I wholly agree,\nJustice Souter, that the State supreme court thought\nthat the Apology Resolution had significance and that\nthe Apology Resolution --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: More than significance.\nI am reading the sentence that immediately follows the\none that General Bennett brought to our attention on\npage 85A. It says, \"Accordingly, the Apology Resolution\ndictates that the ceded lands should be preserved\npending a reconciliation between the United States and\nthe Native Hawaiian people.\"\nIt is very fear language, dictates. And\nthat's why I am really puzzled as how this Court has any\nbusiness wading into any question other than telling the\nHawaii Supreme Court either their right about what the\nresolution dictates or they are wrong, and they are\nwrong because it's a nice apology but it's without\nsubstantive effect.\nMR. JAY: Well, I certainly agree,\nJustice Ginsburg, that the State supreme court thought\nthe Apology Resolution dictated the entry of the\ninjunction, and the -- also on page 85A the State\nsupreme court says that the Apology Resolution gives\nrises to the -- to a fiduciary duty to Native Hawaiians.\nAnd it is -- it is that principle that the\nState supreme court was able to find a fiduciary duty\nand impose it on the State's trusteeship obligation,\neven though that fiduciary duty arises outside the\nsection 5(f) trust. And that is why we think that the\nscope of the State -- of the State's obligation as\ntrustee is within the Court's review at this stage.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Jay.\nMR. JAY: Thank you, Mr. Chief justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Shanmugam?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Thank you,\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:\nThe only issue properly presented in this\ncase is whether the Hawaii Supreme Court concluded that\nthe Apology Resolution created an affirmative federal\nobligation not to sell ceded land. In our view, it did\nnot.\nThe Hawaii Supreme Court held only that the\nsale of ceded lands would breach the State's fiduciary\nduty to Native Hawaiians under State law. And it relied\non the Apology Resolution only for its recognition that\nNative Hawaiians have claims to the ceded lands that are\ncurrently being addressed through the political process.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, they relied on\nfederal law to create the fiduciary obligation. So if\nwe think that federal law did not create the fiduciary\nobligation, what should we do?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Then the Court should vacate\nand remand. But we believe the better interpretation of\nthe Hawaii Supreme Court's opinion is that it believed\nthat the source of the fiduciary duty at issue was State\nlaw and not Federal law. To be sure --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All Federal law?\nAll Federal law? In other words, not simply the Apology\nResolution but the other Federal provisions?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: As the source for fiduciary\nduty?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think\nthose -- yes.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: The source for the fiduciary\nduty, according to the Hawaii Supreme Court, was State\nlaw. To the extent that the Hawaii Supreme Court --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Shanmugam, on page 99,\nthe State supreme court is saying, inasmuch as the\nApology Resolution and related State legislation give\nrise to a fiduciary duty. They are saying the Apology\nResolution did so, too, not only State law.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: They did say at various\npoints in the opinion that the Apology Resolution,\ntogether with State law, gave rise to the fiduciary\nduty.\nBut I think that if one looks at the\ncritical portion of the Hawaii Supreme Court's opinion\non pages 31A to 32A, where the Hawaii Supreme Court\nactually discusses the relevance of the Apology\nResolution, the Court makes clear that it is relying on\nit only for the acknowledgment that Native Hawaiians\nhave unresolved claims.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then how to you explain\nthe language, over and over again, I won't repeat it,\nbut they said this resolution of ours is dictated by,\ncompelled by, the Apology Resolution? Without the\nApology Resolution it would be an entirely different\ncase. And now you seem to be taking what the Hawaii\nSupreme Court put as the necessary link, the Apology\nResolution, before that this would have been impossible,\nand you are treating it now as sort of window dressing,\nicing on the cake, really didn't matter.\nBut we would disrespect the Hawaii Supreme\nCourt if we didn't take them at their word and say --\nusing words such as \"dictated,\" \"compelled.\" You -- you\nare treating this as sort of just part of the\natmosphere.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, it was more than mere\nwindow dressing, Justice Ginsburg. The apology\nresolution really did confirm the factual predicate for\nRespondent's State law claim. And I do mean to\nemphasize that these have been State law claims from the\noutset. If you take a look at the original complaint in\nthis case, which is found in the Joint Appendix at pages\n34a to 36a, the only source of law on which we rely for\nthe counts at issue here was article 12, section 4 --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's what you relied on\nbut it's not what the Hawaii Supreme Court relied on,\nand I would repeat the point I made in the prior\nargument: what's worrisome about this is they are\nfastening on a piece of Federal legislation and said, we\nare compelled to do this because of Federal law. What\nthat does is it removes it from the Hawaii political\nprocess.\nIf they left Federal law out of it, and they\nsaid truly this decision rests on State law, we think\nthat the title belongs with the Native Hawaiians, then\nthey have to answer to the policy; and here the Hawaii\nSupreme Court insulates themselves by using the Federal\nlaw as a crutch.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Let me -- let me be clear\nabout this, Justice Ginsburg, if the Hawaii Supreme\nCourt's opinion is read to construe the Apology\nResolution as creating some affirmative duty or\nobligation as a matter of Federal law, we agree that\nthat would be erroneous. And if the Court --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Would you agree that there\nwould be a Federal question if the Hawaiian Supreme\nCourt said the Apology Resolution dictates our results?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: No, because we believe that\nread in context, Justice Kennedy, that that statement is\nconsistent with our theory of the Hawaii Supreme Court's\nreliance on the Apology Resolution. So --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why doesn't the Hawaii\nSupreme Court's reliance upon Hawaiian law to establish\nthat there is some property right on the part of these\nnative Hawaiians -- why doesn't that conflict with\nFederal law?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: The Hawaii Supreme Court\nrelied on Hawaii law only for the existence of the\nfiduciary duty and that fiduciary duty has repeatedly\nbeen recognized by the Hawaii Supreme Court. That duty\ngives Native Hawaiians an equitable or beneficial\ninterest in the plan.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't care what you call\nit; it's a property interest.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: As I read the Federal law,\nit extinguished all property rights in these lands; the\nlands were transferred to the Federal Government; and\nthe Federal Government transferred them in absolute fee\nwithout any encumbrances to the State of Hawaii. Now if\nyou are telling me the Hawaii Supreme Court is now\nfinding as a matter of State law that there is a\nproperty interest on the part of the Native Hawaiians --\nI don't care what you call it, equitable or whatever --\nit seems to me that is flat contradiction of Federal\nlaw, and probably is an issue that we ought to address\nin this opinion.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: There are two separate\nissues, Justice Scalia. The first is what was the\nsource for the injunction in this case. And the source\nof the injunction was Respondent's instant claim for\nbreach of fiduciary duty. Now to be sure, we were\narguing that there would be a breach of the fiduciary\nduty to Native Hawaiians precisely because Native\nHawaiians have underlying claim to the land. It's those\nunderlying claims that trigger all of these additional\nFederal issues that Petitioners are now seeking to\ninject into the case.\nBut I think that the critical point for\npurposes of this Court's review at this stage is that in\nthe Hawaii Supreme Court, we freely and repeatedly\nconceded that any underlying claims to ceded lands would\nbe nonjusticiable. That much was clear as a matter of\nState law.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You concede -- you concede\nthat the Apology Resolution does not say that the\nHawaiian people's claims are valid.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: The Apology Resolution --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Does it say that? Yes or\nno.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: -- does not directly speak\nto the merits of any underlying claims.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay, so if that's so, do\nyou object to a three-sentence pro curiam opinion in\nthis case where we say, to the extent that the Hawaiian\nSupreme Court could be read to suggest that the Apology\nResolution either resolved or cast a cloud, legally\nspeaking, on the title of the trust land, or suggested\nin any way that land be enjoined -- the sale be\nenjoined, the Court made a mistake; and insofar as it is\nresting on State law, that's up to them.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: I -- I think so, with one\ncaveat and I don't mean to quibble --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Do you think your draft --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You would object to\nthat?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: I think we would acquiesce\nin that with one small quibble, which is that I think\nthe issue being debated here is not whether the Hawaii\nSupreme Court relied on the Apology Resolution as\ncreating some cloud on title. Precisely because we\nconceded below that the underlying claims were\nnonjusticiable, the Hawaii Supreme Court did not opine\non the merits of those underlying claims. The only\nissue is whether the Hawaii Supreme Court believed that\nthe Apology Resolution created a fiduciary obligation to\nessentially preserve and protect the ceded lands, until\nthose underlying --\nJUSTICE BREYER: How could it have done\nthat? I mean, I didn't see anything in here that\nsuggests anything like that. That is to suggest that\nthe Apology Resolution created an obligation on the part\nof the State courts to enjoin sales until everything was\nworked out. Now I have read this Apology Resolution\nabout six times, and I certainly didn't see anything\nlike that.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Yes. And we agree that the\nApology Resolution could not be read to create some\naffirmative duty not to sell the ceded lands.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You agree that the Apology\nResolution does not say who's right about the claim?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: No. There are various --ere\nare various findings in the Apology Resolution that\ncould potentially be relevant to the ultimate\ndisposition of the land.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Like what?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: It is, after all,\nsignificant that Congress --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Congress expressed its\nsupport for the reconciliation process, Justice Breyer,\nand that would provide an obvious boost in the Hawaii\nlegislature for the ultimate resolution of those claims;\nand it's really for that reason, to get back to\nJustice Ginsburg's question, and we feel it's important-\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If -- if you took Federal\nlaw, the Apology Resolution, out of the picture, the\nHawaii Supreme Court could reach the result that it\nreached and then we might have questions about its\nconsistency with the Admissions Act and the Newlands\nResolution; but as Justice Breyer said, if we disabuse\nthem of the notion that there is any Federal compulsion\nhere, then the rest is to be sorted out. We wouldn't\nhave to say that they have a claim under State law, just\nnot address it.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Yes. I think that's it.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And the political process\nquestion I think is really bothersome, that the Hawaii\nSupreme Court chose to use this Federal crutch. It\nseems a very weak reed.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: And it's for that reason,\nJustice Ginsburg, that we freely concede that if the\nHawaii Supreme Court had relied on the Apology\nResolution as creating some Federal duty, that would be\nproblematic. That would be not --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about the\nNewlands Resolution and Admission Act and the Organic\nLaw, do you acknowledge that if the Hawaii Supreme Court\nrelied on those, that also would be inappropriate?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, it's hard to say\nbecause it would depend on how they relied on them, but\nI think that the critical point --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They relied on them\nthe same way you say they relied on the Apology\nResolution, to give rise to a fiduciary responsibility\nunder State law.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, I don't think that a\nFederal act could be read as creating a fiduciary duty\nnot to sell the ceded lands. So I think I would concede\nthat that would be problematic as well. But I think\nthat the question before the Court according to\nPetitioners is whether an injunction, even if that\ninjunction were framed solely in terms of State law,\nmight itself contravene the Newlands Resolution by\nvirtue of --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you would have no\n-- just to carry on the opinion-drafting process, you\nwould have no objection to an opinion that said no\nsource of Federal law gave rise to a duty under State\nlaw, fiduciary or otherwise; that any further\nproceedings on remand should be based solely on State\nlaw?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, I think that that is\nright in the sense that we certainly think that the\nHawaii Supreme Court in the first place intended to rely\non a State law of fiduciary duty. And we would\ncertainly have no problem with and indeed would welcome\na remand that afforded the Hawaii Supreme Court an\nopportunity to do what we think they did in the first\nplace.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They do nothing at all?\nCould I get back to Justice Breyer's three-sentence pro\ncuriam, where we just say to the extent that the Supreme\nCourt of Hawaii relied upon the Apology Resolution as\ncreating any -- any property entitlement in the\nHawaiians, it was in error. Okay, we send it back to\nthe Hawaiian Supreme Court and the Hawaii Supreme Court\nsmiles, and doesn't do a blessed thing. Leaves --\nleaves the injunction against any distribution of the\nland in effect. What -- what happens then?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, I don't think they\nwould do that, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: On remand, I think that they\nwould consider the issue of whether the injunction could\nbe granted on State law, which after ball was the basis\nof our complaint from day one in this case. And there\nis certainly language --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not if we said \"to the\nextent that.\" I mean, if we said it is -- it's grounded\non the proposition that the Apology Resolution creates\nproperty rights, and that's wrong; then they have to do\nsomething.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, presumably --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: To the extent that it may\nbe grounded on that, we take no position on whether it's\ngrounded on that or not --\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Presumably, Justice\nScalia --\nJUSTICE SCALIA. -- why would that require\nany action on their part?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: If the Court were to write\nthat opinion, I assume the last line of the opinion\nwould be to vacate and remand, and that would eliminate\nthe injunction and so the Hawaii Supreme Court would\nhave the case once again; and at that point the Hawaii\nSupreme Court could clarify that the source of fiduciary\nduty at issue was State law.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not simply a\nquestion of the source of the fiduciary duty. It,\npresumably, in the course of saying what the Apology\nResolution, the Newlands Act, the Organic Act, and the\nAdmission Act had to say, we may well say something to\nthe effect that, because it conveyed perfect title, it's\ninconsistent with the cloud of that title, under a\nfiduciary obligation created by State law or anything\nelse.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: And if the Hawaii Supreme\nCourt on remand, Mr. Chief Justice, addressed the merits\nof any underlying legal claims, then the Court could\nreview the decision, and at that point it might have a\nsense of, for instance, what those legal claims actually\nare.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But if we told them\nthat these various Federal resolutions, including the\nApology Resolution, conveyed title to the State in a\nparticular way that precluded the burdening of the\nState's title on the basis of Federal law, then they\nwould have to find a basis under State law that was not\ninconsistent with the Federal law's conveying of perfect\ntitle.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, that is presumably\nalways true, but, you know, I think for purposes of the\ncurrent posture of the current case, Mr. Chief Justice,\nthe only Federal issue that is before the Court is the\nquestion of whether the Apology Resolution was the\nsource of the underlying obligation.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And do you think --\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Petitioners did not --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you think that that\nresolution is distinguishable in any way from the\napology that the United States made to the people of\nJapanese ancestry who were interned after World War II?\nThe United States did say -- it was -- I think it was an\nexecutive order by President Ford that, in no uncertain\nterms, stated that the United States made a dreadful\nerror and there was never reason for rounding these\npeople up and putting them in interment camps.\nDid -- is there any difference? And that,\nas I understand it, had no substantive effect until\nCongress passed legislation providing for compensation.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: The -- the Apology\nResolution in this case does not speak directly to the\nmerits of any underlying claims. What does do is\nrecognize that the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii\nwas illegal, apologized for the Federal Government's\ninvolvement in that overthrow, and, in the operative\nprovision of the resolution, expresses support for the\nreconciliation process. And it is that expression of\nsupport on which the Hawaii Supreme Court critically\nrelied here in informing its application of State law.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If I said that -- just in\nthe opinion -- and said just what you said, and nothing\nelse about the resolution, say we don't see any other\nway in which the resolution could have supported this,\nwould that -- is that okay with you?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Yes, that would be okay,\nJustice Breyer, and I do think that it would be\nimportant for this Court to make clear that to the\nextent that the Hawaii Supreme Court, in any subsequent\nremand, relies on the Apology Resolution only for what\nare essentially factual findings, its acknowledgment\nthat Native Hawaiians have unrelinquished claims, which\nis undoubtedly true as a factual matter -- I don't hear\npetitioners to suggest otherwise -- and its recognition\nthat there is an ongoing reconciliation process, that is\nentirely proper. And the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But then it would\nalso have to just -- the opinion we're drafting would go\nfurther, I suppose, and since we are interpreting all\nthese Federal provisions, it may not be sufficient to\nsay that it did not create this obligation and the\nHawaiian Supreme Court was wrong to do that, but that it\nprecluded the creation under State law of this type of\nobligation.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And if the Hawaiian\nSupreme Court wants to create, under State law, a\nparticular type of fiduciary obligation grounded on the\nstatus of the land prior to admission, then it has to\nrun -- under the Supremacy Clause, it has to be\nconsistent with the Federal provisions.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: But the Hawaii Supreme\nCourt, in the opinion under review, did not ground that\nduty on any judgment about the validity of the original\nconveyance of title --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I'm not saying\nthey did. That's the first question. I'm not saying\nthey grounded it on Federal law; I'm saying we would\nhave to determine whether Federal law precluded the\ngrounding of the fiduciary duty under the status of the\nland prior to admission.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: But I do think,\nMr. Chief Justice, that that is an entirely discrete\nquestion from the question presented, and it's entirely\ndiscrete precisely because this argument concerning the\nNewlands Resolution could have arisen, even if the\ninjunction were, as we believe it was, unambiguously\nbased solely on State law with nary a reference to the\nApology Resolution.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The Native Hawaiians --\nMR. SHANMUGAM: And it is precisely --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The Native Hawaiians --\nthey do get 20 percent of the proceeds, correct?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: That's correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And what -- that comes\nout of Hawaii legislation?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Yes, that's right. It comes\nout of -- I think it's Hawaii statute 10-13.5, and as a\nmatter of State law they get 20 percent of the revenue\nfrom the ceded-lands trust, though the amount of that\nrevenue has itself been the subject of protracted and\nunresolved litigation.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The -- the $5.5 million\nfigure, is that the subject of litigation?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: The valuation of the\nLeiali'i parcel was challenged in this litigation, and\nit remains pending before the trial court.\nBut, I think, more broadly the important\npoint is that to the extent that the injunction in this\ncase was based on the lack of resolution of underlying\nclaims in the State political process, the Hawaii\nlegislature could readily resolve those claims without\nin any way casting any doubt on the validity of the\noriginal conveyance of lands to the Federal Government.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It also, I guess, has a --\nthere -- in the Admission Resolution, it set up a trust.\nThey hold it in trust, and there are five purposes in\nthe trust, and only one of those relates to the Native\nHawaiians. Now, I know from the newspapers -- I don't\nknow the merits of it -- but the trust that has been set\nup is the subject of controversy continuously.\nSo what I don't see -- and I hope we don't\nhave to get into this -- is what the relation between\nthe trust principles as enacted in the legislature is\nand the trust principles set forth in the Admissions\nResolution. Is there any law going to anything like\nthat?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, now -- but let me say\nsomething about that, because you think that it is\nrelevant to our interpretation of the Hawaii Supreme\nCourt's opinion. What State of Hawaii did, with article\n12, section 4 of the Hawaii Constitution, was\nessentially to say that, while the State does have some\ndiscretion to use the assets in the section 5(f)\nceded-lands trust for any of the stated purposes, the\nState owes a particularly high duty to Native Hawaiians.\nThe Hawaii Supreme Court has so construed\narticle 12, section 4, in other cases involving the\nceded-lands trust. And, at page 39a of its opinion in\nthis case, the Hawaii Supreme Court plainly relied on\nthat provision as a source of its fiduciary duty, the\nfiduciary duty that we believe was at issue in this\ncase. The opinion does not cite that provision in so\nmany words, but it refers to the Hawaii Constitution in\na case construing that provision.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is the court the trustee?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: The State is the trustee.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The State is the trustee.\nSo I assume it would be up to the State officers to\ndecide to what extent the obligation to the Hawaiians,\namong the five obligations, should be given precedence.\nIs the Supreme Court of Hawaii directing the State\nofficers to give it precedence?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, article 12, section 4,\nwe would respectfully submit, Justice Scalia -- it does\nplace Native Hawaiians in something of a privileged\nposition vis-a-vis the other beneficiaries. And in\nconstruing article 12, section 4, the Hawaii Supreme\nCourt was doing, albeit in a somewhat unusual context,\nwhat courts do every day, which is essentially to\nevaluate whether the trustee is acting consistent with\nthe trustee's obligations under the terms of the trust.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And saying that the trustee\nmust direct it primarily to -- to that among the five\nends.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: All that the Hawaii Supreme\nCourt said was, in light of the very realistic prospect\nthat lands may be returned to Native Hawaiians as part\nof the reconciliation process that Congress recognized\nin the Apology Resolution, it would constitute a breach\nof fiduciary duty to sell those lands for another trust\npurpose, for the simple reason that once those lands are\ngone, they are gone forever. And that is entirely\nconsistent with the general principle of trust law, that\na trustee in exercising its discretion --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And all this comes from the\nfact that Congress made reference to and approved a\nso-called reconciliation process?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, Congress did support\nthat --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So in -- in perpetuam, this\nland can't be transferred because Congress approved the\nthis reconciliation process?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Only until the claims of the\nNative Hawaiians are resolved. And what is clear --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I see.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: -- regardless of the degree\nof the reliance on the Apology Resolution, Justice\nScalia, is that the Hawaii legislature has substantial\ndiscretion to act and to act in a way that essentially\nvacates the terms of the injunction. So if the Hawaii\nlegislature either says, we're going to reach a\ndefinitive solution of the underlying claims of the\nNative Hawaiians by giving them land or additional\nmonetary compensation, or the Hawaii Supreme Court\ndetermines that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Or denying it to them?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Or denying it to them. Then\npresumably, according to the terms of the injunction, it\nwould no longer have any force. So the Hawaii\nLegislature remains empowered to act in such a way as to\nget out from under the terms of the injunction to the\nextent they are restrictive.\nI would note, however, parenthetically, that\nimmediately after this litigation was commenced the\nHawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources imposed\na unilateral moratorium on the sale of ceded lands.\nThat moratorium, as an executive matter, has remained in\neffect during the 14-year pendency of this litigation\neven during the considerable period between the trial\ncourt's ruling in favor of the Petitioners and Hawaii\nSupreme Court's ruling in our favor.\nSo there doesn't seem to be any great\nimpetus on the part of the State to sell the ceded\nlands. Indeed, Governor Lingle, one of the Petitioners\nin this case, has recently and repeatedly made\nstatements to the effect that the State has no intention\nto sell ceded lands.\nAnd if that is really the State's position\n-- and I would be very interested in my friend's,\nGeneral Bennett's, views on the matter, then it would\nseem that there really is no case or controversy before\nthis Court at all. Because if the State has no\nintention to sell ceded lands and the sale of ceded\nlands was the instigating event for this litigation,\nthere would not necessarily be any real dispute between\nthe parties.\nI -- I want to say just, you know, one more\nword --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the decision of\nthe Hawaii Supreme Court would then be vacated.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: The petition would be\ndismissed under Munnsingwear.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Under Munnsingwear.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what is --\nMR. SHANMUGAM: If there is, in fact,\nmootness. And if there were -- if the State -- if the\nState had not intention to sell ceded lands, presumably\nthe underlying dispute would be moot.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't quite understand.\nYou mean -- you mean a Federal court can enjoin the sale\nof my house, and there is nothing I can do about it\ninasmuch as I do not have any present intention of\nselling my house --\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, if --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- except to live under\nthat injunction.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: If a Federal court enjoins\nyou from selling your house without any underlying legal\nauthority for doing so, presumably that injunction would\nbe invalid. But the critical point here --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you say there is no\ncontroversy, so I -- I cannot get its validity\nadjudicated, right?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, here the lawsuit was\ncommenced by Respondents, because Respondents believed\nthat the State was going to imminently sell the Leiali'i\nparcel. That was the triggering event for this\nlitigation.\nIt now appears at -- at least possible that\nthe State has no intention to sell even that parcel. If\nthat was true --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think that -- I\ndon't think that the State has to have an immediate\nintention to sell any particular piece of land in order\nto object to an injunction against any sale of land by\nthe State in the future. I -- I don't think it has to\nwait until it -- it wants to sell a particular plot.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, it just -- it merely\nsuggests that the -- that there is no longer an\nunderlying dispute, Justice Scalia. Because, again --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But there is. The State\nsays that I am free to sell the land, and -- and the\nCourt says, no, you are not. Isn't that a dispute?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, I -- I think that\nthere is -- you know, that there was a case or\ncontroversy as this case came to the Court in the\nArticle III sense precisely because there was a dispute\nbetween the parties about --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Your whole case rests on a\ncloud on the title in favor of your clients. But you --\nyou ignore the cloud on the title that has been entered\nagainst the State.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, first of all, our\nwhole theory has never been that there is a cloud on the\ntitle. To be sure, we have maintained at various points\nin this litigation that Native Hawaiians do have\npotentially valid legal claims, as well as moral and\npolitical claims, to the underlying land.\nBut we have never argued that the injunction\nin this case should be based on some assessment of the\nexistence or validity of legal claims. To the contrary,\nwe have consistently taken the position -- and this is\nclear from our briefs in support of the Hawaii Supreme\nCourt -- that any such underlying claims would be\nnonjusticiable.\nAnd for that reason all we were seeking was\nan injunction to protect these lands until those claims\ncould be resolved through the political process. That\nwas all we were conceding below, and the Hawaii\nLegislature again could readily resolve those underlying\nclaims without in any way casting doubt on the validity\nof the Newlands Resolution or any other Federal\nenactment that purports to recognize absolute title --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Can I --\nMR. SHANMUGAM: -- to ceded lands.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Can I go back to your --\nyour suggestion that this is a moot case because the\ngovernment -- because the -- the governor agrees with\nyour position. But wasn't a lot of money already sunk\ninto developing this area of Maui for desperately needed\nhousing?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: A lot of money was sunk into\nthis parcel, at least according to the record below.\nAnd the State would remain free at a minimum to proceed\nwith the development by simply entering into long-term\nleases instead of the sale of these parcels of land.\nIndeed, that appears to be some suggestion that that is\nwhat the State would do in the event that this Court\ndoes not vacate the injunction.\nAnd so -- and, indeed, in the State of\nHawaii it is not uncommon for land to be transferred by\nmeans of such long-term leases. So it isn't as if the\nState would be barred from engaging in any development\nwhatsoever. The terms of the injunction simply prohibit\nthe sale of these lands.\nAnd, again, the State's executive has been\noperating under an effective moratorium on the sale of\nceded lands of its own volition during the pendency of\nthis litigation, which suggests at a minimum, regardless\nof the jurisdictional implications, that there is no\ngreat burden on the State from this injunction, which,\nagain, by its terms lasts only as long as the State\nlegislature acts.\nAnd I would add one additional point on that\nscore, which is that to the extent that we believe that\nthe Hawaii Supreme Court's decision rested on a\nfiduciary duty under State law, the State would, of\ncourse, be free to amend its constitution in order to\nmake clear that the State's fiduciary duty to Native\nHawaiians does not run to the extent of requiring this\ninjunction. But this -- there has been no effort to do\nthat, and I would submit, as a political matter, it\nwould be highly unlikely.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Shanmugam, you -- you\ndidn't raise in -- in your opposition to the petition\nthe -- the question of mootness.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, the governor's\nstatements about the lack of an intention to sell ceded\nlands were only made literally in the days before we\nfiled our brief. We do refer to them in a footnote in\nour merits brief, and I think that that would be\nsufficient to preserve the issue.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you don't have to\npreserve it. I mean it's -- it's an issue of Article\nIII jurisdiction, so we would have to look into it on\nour -- on our own. But it does suggest that it is not a\nvery strong string to your bow, if I may put it that\nway.\nMR. SHANMUGAM: Well, I would submit that\neven if the Court does not believe that this rises to\nthe level of jurisdictional import, that it is at least\nsignificant in assessing the substantiality of the\nburden on the State. That the State through its highest\nrepresentative appears to be suggesting that the State\nhas no present need to alienate any of these lands.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Shanmugam, just\nas a matter of curiosity, do you know what percentage of\nthe Hawaiian population is comprised of Native\nHawaiians?\nMR. SHANMUGAM: I think the most recent\nfigures from the 2000 census are that there are\nsomething like 1.2 million people in the State of\nHawaii. And of that number something like 240,000\nidentify themselves as Native Hawaiians in the way that\nthat phrase is currently defined under State law.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nGeneral Bennett, you have a minute remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. MARK J. BENNETT\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. BENNETT: Thank you, Your Honor.\nIt is undisputed that Respondents asserted a\nproperty-interest claim. That any property-interest\nclaim is, in fact, inconsistent with Federal law. That\nthe State has perfect title to these lands, and that\nthere is no possible reason why this Court should not\ndisabuse the State court of the incorrect notion that\nthe State lacks perfect title.\nOn the mootness issue, the ASARCO versus\nKadish case makes clear that the injunction that has\nbeen entered is a present injury. But, in addition, the\ngovernor, who does not control all of the State lands --\nthere are a variety of independent agencies that do --\ntalked about sale but not transfer or exchange, which\nare other things that are forbidden by this court's --\nthe State court's -- injunction. But ASARCO clearly\nsets out that we have an injury.\nBut, again, what -- the basis of the State\ncourt's decision is a property-right interest. It is\nnow undisputed by counsel that such a property-right\ninterest is absolutely inconsistent with Federal law,\nand there is no reason why in this 14-year-old\nlitigation this Court should not make clear the simple\nand indisputed fact that, pursuant to the Newlands\nResolution, the Organic Act and the Admission Act, that\nthe State has perfect title.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, general.\n"
