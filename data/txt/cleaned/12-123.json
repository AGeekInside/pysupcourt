McCONNELL\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. McCONNELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nThere's a surprising number of difficult\nmerits questions lurking in this case, mostly involving\nwhether there was a taking, and if so, how it should be\nconceptualized and valued.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could I -- could I just\nstop you on a factual matter -\nMR. McCONNELL: Certainly.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- because it has\nconfused me. As I look at the captions of the cases,\nthere appear to be two different partnerships: One\npartnership, known as Raisin -- doing business as Raisin\nValley Farms, has Mr. Horne and his wife as the\npartners.\nLarsen Valley, the producer -- not the\nproducer, the handler -- has four other, the Hornes,\nplus two other people. So who owns the raisins? Isn't\nthat the first partnership of the husband and wife? And\nisn't the handler a second partnership that does the\nbusiness of handling?\nMR. McCONNELL: The other two partners in\nLassen were Laura Horne's parents, now deceased.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But the estates have\nbeen substituted.\nMR. McCONNELL: Substituted. That's right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So isn't it two legal\nentities, one who owns and one who handles? One\npartnership produces, one partnership handles?\nMR. McCONNELL: The Department of\nAgriculture did not distinguish among them.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, I don't care if\nthey did or they didn't. I mean, we should know. Are\nthey two separate legal entities? One who produces -\nMR. McCONNELL: They are separate -- they\nare separate legal entities, all effectively controlled\nby the same family.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that's -- you\nknow, in the cat -- you get some limited liability by\ncreating separate entities, so the creature who owns is\none partnership, and the -- and the entity that\nproduces, that handles, is a second one.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I assume this is one of\nthose difficult merits questions you were alluding to,\nit doesn't go to whether there's jurisdiction, but to\nwhether the claim of a taking can be asserted by the\npartnership in question, isn't it?\nMR. McCONNELL: That's right,\nJustice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't -- I don't see how\nit goes to jurisdiction, which is the only question\nbefore us.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, it does to my mind\nbecause what is the claim, assuming that the producer\nowns -- the producer entity owns the raisins. What\nexactly is being taken from the handlers? Is it the\npercentage -- it can't be the raisins because they don't\nown them.\nMR. McCONNELL: Well, Justice Sotomayor,\nI'm -- I'm delighted to preview our -- our argument on\nthe merits on that.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What -- what do they\nown?\nMR. McCONNELL: So the -- so the -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What is it that's being\ntaken from the handler entity?\nMR. McCONNELL: The order in this case was\nissued against the -- the Hornes in their capacity as a\nhandler only, so the entire fine was paid by them. None\nof the fine is attributable to anyone in their capacity\nas a producer.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So go back.\nWhat is the -- what was taken from them -- you're saying\nit's just the fine, that the fine is a taking or -- what\nwas the interest that they're claiming was taken by the\ngovernment? They didn't own the raisins, so they get\npaid a fee for handling.\nMR. McCONNELL: So -- so this is -- this is\nour position, Justice Sotomayor. I think we have to\nlook at what is it that the Department of Agriculture\nattempted to take. So, in the demand letter from the\nDepartment of Agriculture addressed to the Hornes,\nthey -- they asked the Hornes to deliver California\nraisins, or the dollar equivalent. So that's the fact\nupon which all of this case is -- is built.\nNow, what is the legal significance of that,\nCalifornia raisins or the dollar equivalent? It is our\nlegal position, or it will be our legal position on the\nmerits that when the government seeks a specific\nphysical property, a res, or its monetary equivalent,\nthat that is a taking of the res itself. And there's -\nand there's support for that in the -- for precedent\nfrom this Court. The closest case is Village of\nNorwood v. Baker.\nIn this case, the -- the city condemned a\nstrip of land for the purpose of building a road. They\ntried to get out of paying any compensation by claiming\nthat the abutting landowner would gain value. That was\nrejected. They were assessed $2,000 compensation for\nthe taking.\nAnd then the city turned around and issued a\nspecial assessment against the landowner for precisely\nthat $2,000. The landowner came back up to this Court,\nand this Court held that it was a taking -- a taking of\nthe land.\nAnd in a subsequent case just a couple of\nyears later, the Court described this as a, quote\n\"actual confiscation of private property to public use.\"\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But you -- you began by\nsaying that these are merits defenses, but you wanted to\nfocus first on -- on the jurisdictional question that's\nbefore us.\nMR. McCONNELL: That's right. I hope it\nhelps to inform the jurisdictional question. But the\njurisdictional question is this: The Ninth Circuit held\nthat my clients could not even raise their takings claim\non the merits until they had first gone to the Court of\nClaims.\nI think there are three things wrong with\nthat.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Am I right in thinking\nthat there is no dispute on that point, that the -- the\ntakings claim could have been asserted by the Hornes, as\nproducers, in the Court of Federal Claims?\nMR. McCONNELL: I think that the government\nno longer disputes, although you should ask them to\nbe -- to be clear -- I think that they no longer dispute\nthat this is not a jurisdictional client, even though\nthey prevailed after the petition for rehearing was\nfiled in the Court of Appeals -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, jurisdictional -\nMR. McCONNELL: -- on the ground that it was\njurisdictional.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- jurisdictional or not,\nas a practical matter, producers who are not subject to\nfine as handlers, but the producers of the raisins whose\nraisins are being segregated, could they go to the Court\nof Federal Claims and say my raisins have been taken?\nMR. McCONNELL: The -- whether the claim is\nbeing brought in the capacity of producer or handler I\nthink is not relevant to one of our arguments, and it is\nrelevant to the other argument.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But I'd just like a\nstraight answer to that question. You -- you are\nrepresenting producers, and they just produce.\nMR. McCONNELL: No, no. No, we're\nrepresenting people who are both producers and handlers.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm saying\nhypothetically -- hypothetically. Is the Court of\nFederal Claims the proper forum for a producer?\nMR. McCONNELL: It depends upon whether the\ntaking has been from them or not. In the ordinary case,\nthe ordinary relationship between a producer and a\nhandler, the producer is not paid for the reserve\nraisins and therefore any payment that would come, any\nlawsuit on behalf of those raisins would go to the\nproducer, and that would go I think to the Court of\nClaims.\nIn this case, though, the business model is\nquite different from that and the producers in this case\nwere paid everything. They received full value -\nmarket value for their raisins. The only people who are\nout any money in this case are the Hornes in their\ncapacity as handler. So that's why they are the\nonly ones -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But the problem is that\nthey weren't entitled to that money. Meaning they had\nto pay it over to the producer. The producer was going\nto pay them a handling fee, but that money didn't belong\nto them. It belonged to the producers who supplied them\nwith the raisins and expected payment for them -\nMR. McCONNELL: I'm not sure what -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- if they were sold in\nthe ordinary course.\nMR. McCONNELL: I'm not sure which\nmoney you're -- they have not asserted any claim on any\nmoney. The producers have been completely paid off. It\nis the handlers who have been held responsible. And the\nreason they were held responsible was the following\nlogic, and you see this on -- on -- on page 78 of the\njudicial officer's opinion.\nThey were held responsible because in\ntheir -- in their processing capacity, when they were\ndoing the stemming, the seeding, the fumigating, the\npacking, that this was regarded by the Department of\nAgriculture as possession -- physical possession of the\nraisins and acquisition of the raisins, even though they\nnever had title to the raisins.\nIt's the Department of Agriculture that has\nattached to them a possessory interest in the raisins\nand then assessed them the full monetary equivalent of\nthose raisins, full market value, $484,000 for the\nmarket value because it's -- because under this very\nunusual regulatory scheme the government regards them as\nhaving possessed the raisins even though that -- that is\nnot -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. McConnell, I'm sorry.\nCould I -- along the lines of what Justice Ginsburg was\nsaying, suppose that the Hornes had given over all the\nraisins, right, but that they thought that this was\nimproper, that this marketing order was -- it was a\nviolation of the takings clause. Could they have gone\nto the Court of Claims, via the Tucker Act, and said, we\nwant our money back?\nThey gave -- they gave over the raisins,\nthey say we're entitled to compensation. Could they\nhave gone through the Court of Claims?\nMR. McCONNELL: If they had -- if they had\nnot been paid for the raisins, they had taken raisins to\na handler, received no money for them, I think that they\ncould go to the Court of Claims.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: In other words, the Hornes\ndid what the marketing order suggested they should do.\nThey gave over the raisins. But they said this is just\nimproper. You're saying they could go to the Court of\nClaims?\nMR. McCONNELL: Yes.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Okay. So if -- if that's\nthe case, I guess then the question is, why didn't they\nhave to go that route?\nMR. McCONNELL: They didn't -- they didn't\ngo that route, and the question I think is what are the\n-- what are the legal consequences of that -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Right.\nMR. McCONNELL: -- because what they -- what\nthey knew was that they were not going to be compensated\nfor the raisins, and therefore they came up with a -\nwith a plan, a business plan that they believed made -\neliminated any handler and made it unnecessary for any\nof the independent producers, on whose behalf they're\noperating, to turn over raisins to the government.\nThe plan was ultimately rejected and we\nhaven't brought a -- a cert petition on it, but the plan\nactually complies with the -- with the language of\nthe -- of the regulation because they believe that in\ntheir capacity as handler, as processor, that they never\nacquired the raisins. \"Acquisition\" is the key term for\nbecoming a handler under the rule.\nAnd they believe that since they were simply\nproviding a service for -- for $12 a ton to their\nneighbors, that they never acquired the raisins, they\nnever possessed the raisins, and therefore no one had to\ncomply the regulation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, some of the raisins\nwere their own. Some of the raisins were their own.\nMR. McCONNELL: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: At least as to that, that\nwouldn't be true, right?\nMR. McCONNELL: That's -- that's correct. I\nthink that's correct.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, to get you back to\nthe -- the jurisdiction point, let's -- let's just\nassume a hypothetical case where a regulated entity has\nto pay an exaction which it deems to be a penalty. And\nlet's assume it can go to the Court of Claims, but it\ndoesn't.\nIt waits until the penalty's assessed and\nthen when the penalty's assessed it says, this is a\ntaking. That -- is that the case that you want to\ndiscuss with us today.\nMR. McCONNELL: That's right. When the\nunderlying order would be a taking and they have been\nassessed money because they didn't comply with the\ntaking, we believe they can challenge that as a taking.\nAnd both under the AMAA procedures, which are exclusive,\nI think that they have to go through the -- through the\nDepartment of Agriculture and then to the district\ncourt, but I also think under the principles of the -\nannounced by this Court in of the Apfel decision that\nthey are entitled to a remedy in the district court.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. McConnell, would you\nexplain the -- if they were just handlers and weren't\nproducing any raisins, if they were just handlers, do\nthey have a claim and where? And if they were just\nproducers -- I take it from the question I asked and the\nquestion Justice Kagan asked that if they were just\nproducers, the raisins got set aside, they were paid for\nonly the ones that went to market, they could go to the\nCourt of Claims.\nBut now they're just handlers, as this\nentity is for most of the raisins that are involved,\nsome 80 percent, right? It's only about 20 percent is\ntheir own. So could this work for someone who was just\na handler, doesn't produce any raisins?\nMR. McCONNELL: So if they are just a\nhandler -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.\nMR. McCONNELL: -- as the Department of\nAgriculture treated them, as far as the Department of\nAgriculture is concerned they are only a handler. They\nare required to raise -- exhaust their claims before the\nDepartment of Agriculture and then challenge the order\nin the district court.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What I'm -- I'm trying to\nunderstand is this scheme. Apparently it wasn't enough\njust to be a handler or just to be a producer. The\nclaim that you're making turns on the coincidence of\nbeing both the producer and a handler.\nMR. McCONNELL: I don't think that that's\nso. I think that we -- that the Hornes ought to prevail\non either -- in either of their capacities.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So any handler, any\nhandler could be making the same claim?\nMR. McCONNELL: Any handler who has a\nbusiness model that is similar to this. But most\nhandlers -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But what do you mean\nby -- what's the business model that's similar to this?\nMR. McCONNELL: So most handlers, if they're\nin compliance with the order, they take all the raisins\nfrom the producers, they only pay for -- for the free\npool of raisins. They don't pay for the reserve raisins\nand they never have any interest in the reserve raisins.\nIn this case, the Hornes did not operate that way.\nThe -- the producers received full value for all of\ntheir raisins.\nSo the producers are -- are not in the case.\nThey have no standing. They have no pocketbook injury.\nThe -- the entire pocketbook injury in this case is\nborne by the Hornes in their capacity as a handler.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry.\nMR. McCONNELL: In response to -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In the Horne model, the\nhandlers buy -- buy the free raisins and then pay the\nproducers, is that what it -\nMR. McCONNELL: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Oh, so that's the\ndifference in this model, they don't take title to the\nraisins is what you're saying?\nMR. McCONNELL: Exactly. And the Hornes\nbelieved that this would mean that they were not\nhandlers.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. Let me -\nlet me -\nMR. McCONNELL: And that -- and they were\nfound to be handlers anyway.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What is -- what is the\nvalue in permitting a party who doesn't own property to\nraise a taking claim on behalf of other people?\nMeaning, doesn't the system have an interest in ensuring\nthat people comply with their legal obligations, and to\nthe extent that you choose to violate the law the way\nthey have here, that the fine is punitive and not\ncompensatory.\nMeaning, you don't own the raisins, but you\nwere obligated to put raisins aside for someone else.\nYou were their agent and you failed to meet a government\nobligation that was independently on you.\nMR. McCONNELL: No.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So I go back to my\nquestion: What was the taking? Since you didn't own\nthe raisins, the taking is the fine is what you want to\ncall the taking.\nMR. McCONNELL: The taking is what the\ngovernment demanded, which was either give me your house\nor give me your money, give me your raisins or give us\nthe monetary equivalent.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But they're not your\nraisins.\nMR. McCONNELL: By the time -- by the time\nthis order was enforced, the raisins were gone and so as\na practical matter, only one of those two alternatives\nwas left as a matter of timing.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, but in answer to\nJustice Ginsburg's question that -- you said the\nproducers could go to the -- the Court of Federal Claims\nto contest the taking of -- producers could go to\ncontest the taking of raisins.\nMR. McCONNELL: If they had not been paid\nfor the raisins.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If they had not been paid\nfor it.\nMR. McCONNELL: Right.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But are you -- does that\nmean you do not think that the AMAA withdraws Tucker Act\njurisdiction?\nMR. McCONNELL: It withdraws Tucker Act\njurisdiction only for handlers. So if we're talking\nabout pure producers -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Only for handlers.\nMR. McCONNELL: -- pure producers do not go\nto the -- don't have to go through the AMAA process.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why? Why -- why does it\nwithdraw for the one and not the other?\nMR. McCONNELL: These New Deal-era programs,\nJustice Scalia, are somewhat -- the purpose is somewhat\nobscure -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, I don't mean the\npolicy. I don't mean the policy reason. What in the\nlaw leads you to that conclusion?\nMR. McCONNELL: Oh, well, this is\nstraightforwardly set forth in the -- in the -- in\nSections 14(a) and 15(a) of the AMAA. I don't think\nthat's in dispute. So only producers are -- are\nregulated by this program. Only producers have a right\nto go through their remedies in the Department of\nAgriculture.\nOnly producers have to do that. It's -\nit's a -- it's completely a producer -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You said -\nMR. McCONNELL: I'm sorry, I'm sorry.\nExcuse me. Each of those was -- please substitute the\nword \"handler\" for each of those. It's only the\nhandlers that are regulated under this -- under this\nprogram.\nSo -- and -- and my clients were treated as\nhandlers. They believed that they were not. But it is\nthe Department of Agriculture that has attached this -\nthis status to them. And it's -- it's I think quite a\nCatch 22 for the government to come along and say,\nalthough we are fining you $700,000 in your capacity as\na handler, you're not a handler for purposes of\nchallenging the legality of that order.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm just trying to get to\nwhat you're arguing about. And I might be off base by\nnow. I feel like handlers, purchasers, raisins, like an\nold Abbott and Costello movie. I just want to see if\nI'm right. Tell me. Just say you're wrong and I don't\ngo into it further.\nThere -- there are some people, they've been\n-- they are either -- they have some raisins, all right.\nAnd these particular people, whom the Department has\nsaid have acquired the raisins, it said they acquired\nthe raisins. And so they're there with some raisins,\nand then the government says, do this thing with your\nraisins. And they don't want to do it, so they don't.\nThey don't do it even though the law says do it.\nAnd then they say the law is\nunconstitutional and, moreover, you fined us a huge\namount of money and we don't want to pay it because the\nlaw is unconstitutional, and we consider that money to\nbe paid. Call it a fine, call it what you want. We\nconsider we shouldn't have paid it and now we want it\nback and we want compensation and we think it's a taking\nand where do we go. Can't we make that argument in the\nNinth Circuit? It's something like that; isn't that\nwhat we're arguing about?\nMR. McCONNELL: That's almost exactly right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But not quite.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. McCONNELL: With -- with one detail\ndifferent -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes?\nMR. McCONNELL: -- which is that this is the\nproceeding here that decides whether they have to pay.\nThey have not yet paid the fine.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay, okay. So we\nshouldn't have to pay because this is all\nunconstitutional. And -- and now what's your argument?\nMR. McCONNELL: So -- so they're raising a\ndefense. It isn't that they are -- it isn't that\nthey're getting -- trying to get it back.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And then the Ninth Circuit\nsays go to the Court of Claims. And you say no, we\ndon't have to go to the Court of Claims.\nMR. McCONNELL: But that detail actually is\nquite important because, remember, you can't even go to\nthe Court of Claims unless you are seeking damages for\nan actual violation that has already taken place. We\ncould not go to the court -- the Hornes could not go to\nthe Court of Claims right now. What the government says\nis that they should pay the $700,000 fine first and then\ngo to the Court of Claims to get it back. And that is\nexactly what this Court said in Apfel, is a, quote,\n\"pointless set of activities that Congress could not\npossibly have\" -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: That's true -\nMR. McCONNELL: -- \"have contemplated.\"\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I think that's true, Mr.\nMcConnell, as to part of the fine, that part of the fine\nfalls under Apfel, but not the other part. As to the\ncompensation part, it seems to me you have a pretty\ndecent Apfel argument. But as to the penalty part, I\ndon't really understand how the Apfel argument would go.\nIt seems to me that as to the penalty part,\nthe key thing is that if they had handed over the\nraisins, they could have gone to the Court of Federal\nClaims and had the compensation done there. And the\nfact that the government is penalizing them for not\ncomplying with the marketing order does not fall within\nthe rationale of Apfel.\nMR. McCONNELL: Well, the most pertinent\ncase for that part of the fine, for the penalty part, is\nMissouri Pacific Railroad v. Nebraska. So this is the\ncase where the railroad was told by the State to do\nsome -- some expensive work, the railroad says no, that\nwould be a taking if we were required to do that. There\nis no compensation available and so they don't do it.\nThey're fined $500.\nThat gets up to this Court and an opinion by\nMr. -- Justice Holmes, the Court holds that that is a\ntaking and that the railroad is entitled to challenge\nthe taking in the form of the fine. So for -- for the\npenalty portion, the punishment portion of the fine,\nMissouri Pacific Railroad is actually the more pertinent\ndecision.\nWhich comes back -- I don't think I fully\nanswered all the variants of Justice Sotomayor's\nquestion.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All I was trying to do was\nto get you on the basic argument, which you started\nwith, which is why is there -- why was the Ninth Circuit\nwrong when they said they had no jurisdiction to hear\nthis, that rather, they had to go -- you had to go to\nthe -\nMR. McCONNELL: May I tick off the three\nreasons?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. McCONNELL: One is it has nothing to do\nwith jurisdiction.\nSecond, the Tucker Act does not apply to\ncases where -- where there is a defense being lodged to\na monetary exaction. That's Apfel, as supplemented by\nMissouri Pacific Railroad.\nAnd third, even if that were not so, the\nAMAA displaces the Tucker Act and they were required to\nexhaust their remedies before the Department of\nAgriculture and take their case to the district court in\nwhich they are residing.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What was the first? I\nforgot the first already. What was the first?\nMR. McCONNELL: The first is that it isn't\njurisdictional and therefore it should not have been\nraised -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what isn't\njurisdictional?\nMR. McCONNELL: The -- the requirement to go\nto the Court of Claims when you -- when you need to is\nnot jurisdictional, that that's a matter of remedy, that\nis, it's -- it's the equitable principle that you may\nnot pursue your case for an injunctive relief when\nthere's an adequate remedy at law.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. McConnell, in -\nin -- if the producers had decided to challenge this as\na Tucker Act violation, they would have had to hand over\nthe raisins? Or could they have just held on to the\nraisins and said, I'm not handing it over until I get\njust compensation?\nMR. McCONNELL: So had they held on to their\nown raisins and sold them, I assume, you don't -- not\njust left them rot, if they had sold them, then the\nDepartment of Agriculture would have called them a\nhandler because anyone who sells raisins is called a\nhandler, and then they would be fined in their capacity\nas a handler and it would be a somewhat similar case to\nthis one.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right.\nMR. McCONNELL: Maybe an easier one than\nthis one.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, the point is that\nunder a normal takings claim, you have to hand over your\nproperty, you've lost the value, and you want the\ngovernment to pay it back to you, correct?\nMR. McCONNELL: Not necessarily correct.\nThere are a whole string of cases in which property\nowners raise takings as a defense rather than turning\nover the property. Kaiser Aetna is perhaps the most -\nbest known recent case, but out of an administrative\ncontext, there's the Florida Power & Light case. Penn\nCentral was -- was like this. Loretto v. Teleprompter\nis like this.\nThere's a whole string of cases. The\ngovernment themselves cite six such cases, most of them\nfairly old, for this proposition. So there's nothing\nunusual about bringing a -- a defensive takings claim.\nMr. Chief Justice, unless -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. McConnell, I don't\nwant to encroach on your rebuttal time, but one\nmysterious thing. The first time around, the Ninth\nCircuit decided this case on the merits. So if you're\nright, I take it, we remand and then they adjudicate the\nmerits of the takings claim. But they already did that.\nMR. McCONNELL: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. And\nthey did that on a ground that we think is manifestly\ninconsistent with this Court's precedents. We were\nprepared to -- we were trying to get an en banc review\nand were prepared to come to this Court from the merits\ndetermination.\nWe were blocked from that because the\ngovernment, after the petition for rehearing was filed,\ncame up with -- calling this a jurisdictional argument,\nraised this objection for the first time; and the Ninth\nCircuit panel accepted their view, issued a new opinion,\nstripping out the entire merits, and substituting this\njurisdictional holding that is producing so much\nenjoyment for us this morning.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. McCONNELL: May I reserve the remaining\ntime? Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. McConnell.\nMr. Palmore?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH R. PALMORE\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. PALMORE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nI'd like to start where Justice Sotomayor\nstarted with Petitioner's counsel because any takings\nanalysis needs to begin with a careful identification of\nwhat property was allegedly taken. Petitioners in this\ncase have actually advanced two different theories about\nwhat property of theirs was taken. What taking is at\nissue here? Raisins and money.\nWe think both takings claims fail for\nthreshold reasons, but they're different threshold\nreasons that call for different analysis.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Palmore, before you do\nthat then, haven't you conceded the point that this is\nnot jurisdictional?\nMR. PALMORE: We agree that the failure to\ngo to the Court of Claims is not properly viewed as a\njurisdictional defect. We did invoke Ninth Circuit\nprecedent below stating that it was jurisdictional. And\nsome of this cases -- this Court's cases put it in\nripeness terms, which is an Article III concept. So\nthere has been confusion -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When did you first\nraise the argument that it was jurisdictional?\nMR. PALMORE: In our opposition to the\nrehearing petition.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And now you are -\nnow you are changing back again and saying it's not?\nMR. PALMORE: There was Ninth Circuit\nprecedent holding that it was jurisdictional, and we\nrelied on that and there is certainly language from this\nCourt -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You relied on that\nwhen you got to rehearing. You didn't rely on that\nbefore you went before the Ninth Circuit, right?\nMR. PALMORE: That's correct.\nWe think -- we think this is properly viewed\nas a substantive defect in the claim, so in a sense the\nNinth Circuit, in its initial panel decision, ruled for\nthe government on a substantive defect one, there's no\ntaking. And what it did on rehearing in our view,\nalthough it attached the wrong label to it, it\nsubstantively was correct in concluding that there was\nsubstantive defect number two -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But Mr. Palmore, if you are\nconceding now that this is not jurisdictional, it seems\nto me that your Tucker Act argument as a substantive\nargument, I mean, has been waived. You didn't raise\nthat argument until the rehearing petition.\nMR. PALMORE: That would certainly be\nsomething that -- that the Ninth Circuit could consider\nin the event there were a remand here. But the Ninth\nCircuit did decide it. The substance of its bottom line\nconclusion was correct and all of its analysis was\ncorrect. It simply used the wrong words, so we think it\nis here.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm really -- I'm really\nconfused. You are saying there ought to be a remand\nhere because the question is not jurisdictional, which\nis just what your friend says, right?\nMR. PALMORE: Well, the Ninth Circuit -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So the two of you are in\nagreement it ought to go back to the Ninth Circuit, they\nshould do it on the merits, and -- and if that's wrong,\nwe can review that.\nMR. PALMORE: Look, if that happens, of\ncourse, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, the consequence\nfor us is they reinstate the prior panel opinion, in\nwhich we win, also -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That may well be, but -\nMR. PALMORE: I'm not going to resist too\nstrenuously that kind of remand, but they did decide it.\nAnd moreover, they decided something separate, which is\nat JA-305 they said something different, which is the\nkind of threshold defect in the takings claim turning on\nraisins, which is there is a capacity problem.\nSo there are two problems with the raisin\nclaims, a capacity problem and a just compensation\nproblem. The capacity problem is this: In 2002, after\nhaving been strictly raisin producers since 1969,\nentering into a market where there was a reserve\nrequirement from the beginning, they knew what they were\ngetting into, they decided to adopt a new business\nmodel, as Petitioner's counsel says. But, as was found\nbelow, they adopted a business model that was an\nintentional, willful attempt to evade regulatory\nrequirements in order to secure an unfair competitive\nadvantage.\nBut what they did was they took on the\nobligations of a handler. They became raisin handlers\nin 2002. And what came with that status were a series\nof regulatory obligations that apply only to handlers\nand under the AMAA can apply only to handlers: The\nrequirement to have raisins inspected, the requirement\nto file truthful reports, the requirement to make\nrecords available, and the requirement to separate out\nraisins into what's called free tonnage and reserve\ntonnage, any raisins processed, it doesn't matter who\nowns them.\nThose are handler-specific regulatory\nobligations that were imposed upon them, and they\nviolated every single one of them, willfully and\nintentionally, in order to secure an unfair competitive\nadvantage.\nAnd what the USDA did was impose penalties\non them for the violation of law that -- that attached\nto them only as raisin handlers. And then they invoked\nthe judicial review proceedings in Section 14 that\nprovides a judicial review mechanism only for handlers.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but part of -- part of\nthat penalty was -- you know, your raisins or your life,\nright? I mean, it was -\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- you don't have to pay\nthe penalty if you give us the raisins.\nMR. PALMORE: That's not correct,\nJustice Scalia. They have to give the raisins.\nMr. McConnell referred to demand letters -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You mean they -- Is that\nright, they have to give the raisins?\nMR. PALMORE: They are under a regulatory\nobligation to provide the raisins. If they violate that\nregulatory obligation, they are subject to sanctions.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. So -\nMR. PALMORE: One component of -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that amounts to the same\nthing, your raisins or the penalty, right?\nMR. PALMORE: No, but it's not a choice.\nAnd I think that's very important to point out. There\nwere actually two different demand letters.\nMr. McConnell referred to a demand letter saying your\nraisins or your money. There was an initial demand\nletter saying: You are a handler; you have to comply;\nwe're going to come get the raisins. The second demand\nletter said, we showed up -- literally it says, we\nshowed up with our truck, you didn't provide the\nraisins, so now you have got to provide the cash\nequivalent.\nAnd there were also going to be, as there\nwere, separate regulatory proceedings brought against\nthem for violating those -- those obligations. Not just\nthe failure to reserve, but all these handler-specific\nobligations. They filed false reports. They didn't\nmake raisins available for inspection.\nThere were a whole host of regulatory\nviolations that were at issue here, and when they\ninvoked the handler review action in the district court\nthey could assert defenses as a handler. But, for\ninstance, another producer -- producers can't invoke\nthese -- these judicial review schemes. Another\nproducer couldn't have intervened in that action to\nassert its producer claim.\nJUSTICE ALITO: As this case stands when -\nas it comes before us, is there a claim that they -\nthat money -- the government is trying to take money\nfrom them without just compensation?\nMR. PALMORE: That was certainly not how we\nunderstood the claim to be litigated below. That's not\nhow the Ninth Circuit thought -- understood the claim.\nWe have been talking about the claim involving the\nraisins, which fails for a to capacity reason and a just\ncompensation reason.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Is that an issue -- is that\nan issue we should decide or is that an issue that the\nNinth Circuit should decide, whether there is a takings\nclaim for money?\nMR. PALMORE: That was certainly not decided\nbelow, so a remand -- to the extent that this was\npreserved, a remand would be possible outcome there. We\nthink, though, that that claim suffers from separate -\nseparate procedural threshold defects.\nJUSTICE ALITO: All right. If we assume for\nthe sake of argument that there is such a claim, why\ndoes that not fall within Apfel?\nMR. PALMORE: Well, we think that -- for\nseveral reasons. First of all, the Apfel opinion that's\nreferred to is just a plurality. It's not been adopted\nby the Court. Second of all, the Apfel analysis relied\non this one-for-one, dollar-for-dollar concept. That\nwas a critical part of the plurality's discussion there,\nand it thought that it would simply be a pointless\nexercise for Eastern Enterprises to be required to pay\nthe premium and then to go to the Court of Federal\nClaims and get the exact same amount of money back.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Don't they claim that -\nMR. PALMORE: We suggested that there are a\nwhole host of reasons -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Before you leave that, don't\nthey claim that the entire amount that is assessed\nagainst them is a taking? Now, maybe they are wrong.\nThat the entire amount assessed against them is a taking\nwithout just compensation? Maybe they are wrong, but\nisn't that a merits question?\nMR. PALMORE: That's -- that's -- they are\nclearly wrong about that, and I -- but I think -\nhowever you characterize that defect, it defeats this\ndollar-for-dollar pointless exercise point that\nApfel plurality -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, why is that a\nnecessary part of Apfel? Why didn't Apfel just mean\nwhen we are dealing with cash you don't have to go to\nthe Court of Claims? So even if -- you know, you can\nhave a discussion in the district court about whether\nit's not dollar-for-dollar and it should be discounted\nin some way.\nBut why should the fact that its\ndollar-for-dollar mean -- why is that a requirement, as\nopposed to just it's cash and so the question of,\nlike -- you know, handing some -- handing it all over\nand getting some back, that can be done in the district\ncourt rather than making somebody file a separate suit?\nMR. PALMORE: Well, I think there were two\nthings going on in Apfel and there were really two\ndistinct reasons why the plurality in Apfel thought that\nthere was no requirement to go to the Tucker Act there.\nOne was that it thought that in a statute like that,\nthat simply allocated benefits and burdens among private\nentities, Congress would not have intended there to be\ncompensation available in the -- in the event that there\nwere a taking.\nAnd that was actually the government's\nposition in that case and the Apfel plurality cited to\nthat portion of the government's brief. And it cited\ncases in its discussion that weren't dollar-for-dollar\nor even cash transfer cases in which the Court had gone\nto the merit of takings claims without consideration of\na Tucker Act remedy.\nThen there is the second idea, which is the\ncash transfer idea. And we think that the\ndollar-for-dollar aspect of that was important to the\nplurality's analysis because it viewed that as evidence\nthat Congress would not have intended the Tucker Act to\nbe deployed because it would have been a pointless\nexercise. So it really went to what Congress's intent\nwas.\nHere, of course, for myriad reasons, that\ndollar-for-dollar analysis breaks down.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no, but there's a\nsimilar -- I mean, it seemed to me, again simplifying,\nthat underlying this their clients think this whole\nraisin program is unconstitutional. What it does is it\ntakes raisins that we grow, in effect throws them in the\nriver. And in the thirties, that was done to raise\nraisin prices.\nAnd they think as a matter of policy that\njust hurts people by raising prices, and as a matter of\nconstitutional law it takes raisins from some people\nthat belong to them and uses them for this bad purpose.\nOkay, that's their view of it, something like that,\nisn't it?\nMR. PALMORE: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Fine. So they're making\nthat kind of constitutional claim. Now, I would think\nif all you told me was that and I knew nothing about all\nthese statutes, I would say that's the kind of claim\nthat should be made in a Federal district court, period,\nnot the Court of Claims. Because their government isn't\ngoing to compensate them for anything. That's against\nthe whole point of the program.\nEither this program is valid or it isn't.\nAnd if it isn't, some authoritative set of courts should\ntell us that. So I have a feeling this is somehow not a\nright fit with the Court of Claims.\nNow, you explain to me why that purely\ninstinctive feeling at this point is completely wrong.\nMR. PALMORE: Sure. Justice Breyer, we've\nnow shifted back to the -- the first theory about the\nproperty, which is the raisins. What they could have\ndone in 2002, would they have been a producer of\nraisins, solely a producer of raisins for decades, at\nany point during -- between 1969 and 2002, they could\nhave gone to the Court of Claims and said, this reserve\nrequirement, the taking of my raisins, I want my just\ncompensation.\nThat is not just a remedy, as Mr. McConnell\nsuggests, it is a constitutional condition on the taking\nof private property for public use. As long as there's\njust compensation, there simply is no violation. So\nthat's why -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That couldn't be what the\nstatute meant. I think that's what Justice Breyer says.\nDid -- did Congress create a statute in which we're\ngoing to take your raisins and then you can go to the\nCourt of Claims and get your money back. I mean,\nthat -- that surely is not what Congress contemplated.\nThe -- the whole notion of the program is you can't get\nyour money back in the Court of Claims.\nNow, if you're raising a constitutional\nobjection, that's something else. That should be done\nin district court. But to say that Congress\ncontemplated -- you know, we'll take your raisins and\nthen you sue in the Court of Claims, they give you your\nmoney back. That's a weird statute.\nMR. PALMORE: Justice Scalia, I have two -\ntwo responses to that. First of all, these claims have\nbeen litigated in the Court of Claims; the Evans case,\nthe Cal-Almond case, both of which we cite in our brief.\nRaisin producers, or in the Cal-Almond case it was an\nalmond producer, went to the Court of Claims and said\nthis reserve requirement is a taking, I want my money.\nAnd they lost; the Court of Claims -- correctly, in our\nview -- held that there was no taking.\nThat said, we do agree that it is actually a\nclose question whether Congress would have intended\ncompensation to be provided in a situation like this\none, in the event the raisin reserve program were found\nto be a taking. We've said -- we've said in our brief,\nwe do view that as a close question, although on\nbalance, we think that the proper answer is that there\nis a remedy -- or, sorry, there is just compensation\navailable in the Court of Claims.\nBut there are cases, Justice -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you -- you think that's\na close question? You think that the way the statute is\nsupposed to operate, once it is held that this is an\nunconstitutional taking, is that every year, the\ngovernment takes the raisins and every year, the grower\ngoes to the Court of Claims and gets the money back for\nthe raisins. Is that the program that Congress\nanticipated?\nMR. PALMORE: Well, we do agree that it's a\nclose question for the -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think it's close at\nall. That's a crazy statute. Every year we're going to\ntake raisins and every year we're going to pay you in\nthe Court of Claims. What's the purpose of that?\nMR. PALMORE: Well, of course, Congress\ndidn't think this was a taking. And it -- and it built\nconsiderable administrative flexibility into the\nstatute, and at the end of the day, that's what\nconvinces us that Congress would not have intended to\npreclude compensation in the Court of Claims and to -\nto opt for an injunction instead because the Secretary\nof Agriculture has wide latitude to adjust.\nSo the compensation wouldn't be paid year\nafter year, as your hypothetical suggested. The program\ncould be adjusted. A reserve requirement is only one\nway of complying with the kind of supply control\nprovisions of the statute. There are any number of\noptions available.\nBut I'd also point out that in this Court's\nprecedence in Monsanto and Regional Rail, those were\nboth statutory schemes which had their own compensation\nmechanism, as does this one, this reserve raisins that\nproducers do get paid sometimes for them in a smaller\namount. Those were cases in which the statutes did have\ncompensation mechanisms, and this Court held that the\nTucker Act was available as kind of a supplementary\ncompensation in the event -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Palmore, am I\nincorrect in thinking that the government is saying,\nhandlers cannot raise the constitutionality of the\nRaisin Marketing Order? You've told us that the\nproducers can go to the Court of Claims. What about the\nhandlers? They're at least being fined for violating\nthe Act, and it's their position that the whole thing is\nunconstitutional.\nCan they raise the constitutionality of the\nwhole arrangement defensively, or they simply can't\nraise the constitutionality of the Act?\nMR. PALMORE: Justice Ginsburg, I think this\ngoes back again to the property question. If the claim\nis that it's unconstitutional because it takes\nproducers' property, they can't raise that in this\nproceeding. If the property is the raisins, they can't\nraise that in this proceeding. They need to -- to\ncomply and go to the Court of Claims for compensation,\nwhich means there has been no -- in the event there's a\ntaking, it's a constitutional taking because just\ncompensation is provided.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it would be -\nMR. PALMORE: If the claim -- if the claim\nis that the money that was taken from me, the fine, that\nitself is a taking, then we think that claim can and\nmust be brought in the context of the AMAA proceeding.\nThat was not how the Court of Appeals understood the\nclaim here to be, and there's no precedent for the idea\nthat a fine for violation of law can be articulated as a\ntaking of the lawbreaker's property without just\ncompensation. I haven't seen any case that -- that\nstands for that proposition and that would be quite\nremarkable.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But then you just -- but\nthen you just lose on the merits. What the Ninth\nCircuit says, they can't even argue this.\nMR. PALMORE: Well, Justice Kennedy -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I thought that what\nwe were going to decide was whether or not, assuming you\ncan go to the Court of Claims, you must go to the Court\nof Claims, can you prefer to wait, have a penalty\nassessed against you and say this is unconstitutional,\nit's a taking. Your position is you can't say that. I\ndon't understand why. Other than, if you want to talk\nabout Williamson and so forth, we can get into that.\nMR. PALMORE: But, Justice Kennedy, the -\nthe Ninth Circuit didn't understand the taking claim to\nbe that the fine for my violation of law is a taking of\nmy money. That's not how the Ninth Circuit understood\nthe claim, so they didn't analyze it in that way.\nThey understood the claim to be that the\ntaking of producers' raisins is a taking, and we\nlawfully resisted it because it was an unconstitutional\ntaking. The Ninth Circuit correctly rejected that\nbecause there was nothing unconstitutional about it\nbecause it was not without just compensation.\nThe Tucker Act is the just compensation.\nThis Court has held -\nJUSTICE BREYER: The just compensation, I\ntake it, in the program is supposed to come from the\nfact that raisin prices go up. So the poor children\nwith their noses pressed to the glass because they can't\npay the raisins, their parents are the ones who are\npaying the compensation. And certainly not the\ntaxpayer, he's not going to pay it, and maybe the other\nproducers will pay, some who get gypped or something, I\ndon't know. But I can't believe that Congress wanted\nthe taxpayers to pay for a program that's going to mean\nthey have to pay higher prices as consumers.\nMR. PALMORE: Justice Breyer, and that goes\nto the -- to the merits of the case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. No, it doesn't go\nto the merits. It goes to whether or not it makes sense\nto think that the Court of Claims has something to say\nabout this. And suppose we did this. Suppose we said,\ngiven the fact that you filed your thing, whatever it\nwas -- you know, late, and the -- and the light of this\nvery enlightening discussion which has been helpful, we\nthink that this is the kind of program and challenge to\nthe program where there isn't going to be a remedy\nreally in the Court of Claims and they ought to go ahead\nin the Ninth Circuit, and in light of all these\nenlightening things that we'll write, you just decide\nthe merits of -- is that -- now, I'm sure you're going\nto say that's absolutely terrible, it won't work at all.\nSo tell me why not.\nMR. PALMORE: Well, Your Honor, of course,\nthe consequence of that is they reinstate our prior\nvictory in the prior panel opinion -\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no, we'd say -- we'll\nsay given the way that we've talked about the program,\nperhaps it's best to consider this matter fully.\nMR. PALMORE: Well, they did consider the\nmatter fully. In the initial opinion, they said there's\nno taking here.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. PALMORE: So all of the discussion we're\nhaving here is about -- is predicated on the idea that\nif there were a taking, would compensation be available\nin the first place.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Excuse me. Can I -\nMR. PALMORE: We agree there's no taking.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. It almost\nseems to me, and I'll ask Mr. McConnell when he gets up\nat rebuttal, that there is some sort of due process\nchallenge going on here that's been created by the\nlabels they did in this new situation -- in this new\nbusiness venture. In the normal situation, the handler,\nI'm being told, would actually have title to the\nraisins, and they would pay the producers for the\nraisins. So there would be property taking.\nIn that situation, where the handlers\nactually own the property, would they be able to raise a\ntaking defense?\nMR. PALMORE: No, because of the way that\nthe statute and the regulatory program works. If the\nhandler is actually buying raisins from the producer,\nthe handler never takes title to the reserve raisins.\nAnd he doesn't pay for the reserve raisins. He takes\ntitle to the free-tonnage raisins and the title to the\nreserve raisins passes, as a matter of law, from the\nproducer to the Raisin Administrative Committee. The\nhandler never owns those raisins.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So they are missing a\nbusiness opportunity because they can't take title to\nthose raisins. And yet you're asking -\nMR. PALMORE: They would never pay for\nthose -- they would never pay for those raisins because\nthey can't take title. They can't lawfully take title\nto those raisins. Now -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: This really does sound\nto me -- and I think that both Justice Scalia and Breyer\nnow are being more and more convinced -- there has to be\na place to challenge this scheme.\nMR. PALMORE: And there absolutely is.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Whether it's a taking -\nwhether there's a takings claim for the handler because\nthe handler is being asked to do things -\nMR. PALMORE: But the handler's property is\nnot being taken, and that's critical. There are\nseparate takings claims that handlers have advanced\nthat -- that could be asserted through this process.\nFor instance, there was a case called Lion Raisins from\nthe Federal Circuit that we cite in our brief, in which\nthe issue was that the handler provided bins to store\nthe raisins, and he didn't get his bins back. Okay?\nThat was a handler takings claim, and that\nhad to be asserted in the context of this handler review\nscheme. But the handler doesn't own the raisins under\nthis scheme.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's -- that's a merits\nquestion again. I mean, it's not a question of whether\nyou -- you can resist on the basis of a takings claim.\nIt's a question of whether you are going to win.\nMR. PALMORE: No, Justice Scalia, I think it\ngoes to the scope, the capacity question that we were\ntalking about before because the statute is quite clear\nin section 608c(13)(B) that this scheme does not\nregulate producers in their capacity as producers. And\nif someone wants to take on both roles, they will be\nregulated only as a handler.\nSo the regulatory obligations that applied\nto Petitioners when they adopted this business model\nwere handler-only regulatory obligations, and then this\nis a handler judicial review proceeding. That's a very\nnarrow means of decision here that avoids some of these\nkind of conceptual questions about the nature of the -\nthe Takings Clause, which is that this claim simply\ndoesn't belong in this proceeding.\nBut there's no unfairness or no due process\nissue here at all because they -- in 2002, when -- when\nPetitioners decided to engage in this, these regulatory\nviolations in order to secure an unfair advantage over\ntheir competitors, as was found by the ALJ at JA41, at\nthat point they could have sought compensation for the\npast 6 years of raisins that they had provided. They\ndidn't do it.\nI don't understand why they didn't do it.\nThey left that claim on the table. And to the extent\nthey wanted to claim going forward, they could have\ncontinued to use compliant handlers and sued every month\nfor compensation in the Court of Claims.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Did I understand you to say\na couple minutes ago that if the case were remanded, you\nwould be entitled to win on the reasoning of the panel\nopinion?\nMR. PALMORE: The prior panel opinion,\nJustice. If -- if there was a remand on the basis that\nthe Ninth Circuit misunderstood this as a jurisdictional\nArticle III defect, and then the Ninth Circuit were to\nfind waiver, what the Ninth Circuit presumably would do\nwould be to reinstate its first panel decision, which we\nthink was also correct and held that there was no taking\nhere. There are two -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Palmore, what would be\nwrong -- would anything be wrong -- with a -- with a\ndisposition of this Court that went something like this:\nEverybody agrees that this is not a jurisdictional\nissue, including the government, so they got that wrong.\nNow, as to this whole business about the\nTucker Act and whether the Tucker Act provides a remedy,\nthe government only started talking about that in a\npetition for rehearing en banc, and the government can't\ndo that. You know, it can't introduce an argument like\nthis in a petition for rehearing en banc. So that's\nwaived.\nAnd now, the Ninth Circuit can go and try to\nfigure out whether this marketing order is a taking or\nit's just the world's most outdated law.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. PALMORE: That would certainly be an\navailable option, or the Ninth Circuit could decide for\nitself whether there had been a waiver.\nBut there's a separate issue in that there's\nthis capacity issue, which is a separate point that the\nNinth Circuit made at JA305, when it pointed out that\nthis was a producer claim, and that's something that -\nthat was strictly a producer claim and wasn't -- wasn't\na fit for this handler review action, and that's\nsomething that could also be considered on remand.\nBut the consequence of this -- of that would\nbe for the -- the Court to impose its -- if it found a\nwaiver, to rule for us for separate merits reasons.\nWe do view the Tucker Act -- the failure to\nseek just compensation -- as a merits defect in the\nPetitioners' claim here. So even putting this capacity\nproblem aside, there is simply -- there's no defense.\nMr. McConnell says this can be raised as a defense. But\nthere is no defense if all you show is that there has\nbeen a taking of private property for public use, full\nstop.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What does the word\n\"acquire\" mean. There is some opinion here which says\nthese handlers acquired the raisins. What is -- what's\nthat about?\nMR. PALMORE: \"Acquire\" is a defined term,\nand it includes to possess. So they took to -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Like lessees or something,\nbailees?\nMR. PALMORE: There was no question under\nthe regulatory scheme here that Petitioners were\nhandlers. And in fact, there's a surprising -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I -- no, no. I just wanted\nto know what the word \"acquire\" -\nMR. PALMORE: \"Acquire\" -- \"acquire\" is\ndefined to include a number of things, including to\npossess. And a handler is anyone who sells raisins.\nThere was no mystery about this.\nAnd, in fact, at pages 8 through 11 of our\nbrief, we cite communication after communication where\nUSDA told them -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, can an acquirer of my\ncar, for example -- I don't know. Forget that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: A bailee?\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can they -- can they\nassert a takings claim attaches to the car? It sounds\nlike a standing question.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, I suppose a bailee\ncould, a bailee of the car.\nMR. PALMORE: No, I don't think a bailee\ncould. I think the owner would have to assert that\nclaim, right.\nBut \"acquire\" is a defined term, and as this\ncase comes to this Court it's accepted. The Petitioner\nhas not sought cert on the underlying regulatory\nfindings. In fact, their arguments -- they were told\nahead of time that they were completely wrong over and\nover and over again, and then they lost that claim at\nevery level, twice within the Department of Agriculture,\nin the district court, in the court of appeals. They\nlost on that regulatory claim.\nThis wasn't a good faith misunderstanding.\nIf you look at JA41, the ALJ found that this was a\nwillful and intentional, knowing violation of regulatory\nrequirements because they were able to undercut their\ncompetitors by not playing by the rules. So this\ndoesn't present any kind of due process -\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. But still, it might\nif they're acquirers -- but they are acquirers, okay?\nThey think this program is unconstitutional because it\ntakes some other people's property, right? So those\nother people are in a very special relation to them.\nThose other people are really close.\nAnd it may be they have standing to assert\nthose other people's claims. And if they do have\nstanding to assert those other people's claims, why\ncan't they make the argument that way?\nMR. PALMORE: I -- I disagree that they have\nstanding to make those other people's claims. And also,\nPetitioners haven't argued, haven't made any third-party\nstanding argument here.\nBut -- this Court's requirements are quite\nstrict for third-party standing. You have to have a\nclose -- a close relationship, and I don't think a mere\narm's-length commercial relationship would count.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose they did have\nstanding. Could they raise the claim?\nMR. PALMORE: If -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You say no.\nMR. PALMORE: Well, they have -- they\ncertainly have standing as producers to raise the claim.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Let's assume they have\nstanding. Could they raise the claim -\nMR. PALMORE: Yes, that -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY -- that this is an\nunconstitutional taking?\nMR. PALMORE: In the Court of Claims,\nabsolutely, as producers.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no. In the\nadministrative proceeding where they are charged with -\nwhere a penalty is being assessed against them.\nMR. PALMORE: I think that they would have\nstanding, but it's still a claim that's beyond the scope\nof this narrow specific judicial review proceeding. I\nthink its' a -- it's a different problem.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I have to say -- I\nthink it comes with less than good grace for you to\ncriticize the other side for not having raised a\nparticular argument. But I do want to clarify that you\nhave no objection at this point for reversing the Ninth\nCircuit on the ground that they erred in saying that\nthis -- they should have dismissed on jurisdictional\ngrounds.\nMR. PALMORE: Well, I'm not going to resist\nthat too strenuously, -- but I think if they did decide\nthe question, they decided it correctly. It was a\nthreshold defect. Their analysis was all correct. So I\nthink that's before the Court.\nBut yes, we -- we frankly acknowledge and we\nacknowledged in our brief that we did not -- we did\nsuggest below that this was a jurisdictional defect.\nNinth Circuit authority said that it was and we relied\non that.\nWe now believe that it's best understood not\nas a jurisdictional defect, but as a substantive defect\nin the claims, not simply a choice of remedies issue, as\nPetitioners suggests because choice of remedy suggests\nthat there has been a constitutional wrong and that we\nneed to decide what remedy is going to be available, an\ninjunction or damages.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The short answer is,\nyes, reach the merits only if I win. That -- that's\nreally what you want us to do.\nMR. PALMORE: Well, we -- we think you could\nreach some of the merits. We think that the narrow\ndisposition here is actually the capacity -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, no, no. I need to\nask you this question because do you want us to reach\nthe merits if we're going to have you lose? You got to\nwant one or the other.\nDo you want us to reach the merits, period,\nis really the question?\nMR. PALMORE: Yes. Our position is that\nwe're not acquiescing in a -- in a remand. We think you\ncan affirm, and you should affirm. However, I do\nrecognize -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you think we should\nreach the merits, which is a very different question?\nMR. PALMORE: Well, it depends on what you\nmean by \"merits.\"\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Only if you win, right?\nMR. PALMORE: There is the taking -- no.\nThere is the underlying kind of takings claim, that\nthere was -- was there a taking here at all. And that's\nnot before the Court. I don't think anyone suggests\nthat that's before the Court.\nBut we do -- we do think that there are a\nseries of other threshold defects in the claim that this\nCourt could -- could rely on.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Palmore.\nMr. McConnell, you have 3 minutes remaining.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL W. McCONNELL\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. McCONNELL: I'd like to make two quick\npoints. One is that I believe that the government has\nessentially conceded here in this argument and in their\nbrief that the Tucker Act does not apply. They have\ntold us that the Tucker Act does not apply on page 50\nand repeated here when Congress could not have\ncontemplated a compensation. Now, in addition -- and\ntheir only answer to that is to say, first, that\nCongress didn't think it would be a taking, which in\nRegional Rail, this Court said is not the question.\nAnd secondly, that if -- if there's one -\nwe should get paid once, compensation once and then the\nadministrator's going to cancel the program, which is no\nanswer at all. Either the statute contemplates\ncompensation for everybody or it contemplates it for\nnobody.\nI think they have effectively conceded that\nthe Tucker Act does not apply.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, they've conceded\nthat it doesn't apply to handlers.\nMR. McCONNELL: To handlers. And -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Yes, and so they've\nconceded there is no -\nMR. McCONNELL: And the second issue I\nwanted to talk about so is this capacity issue.\nCertainly, we have standing. When -- it's not\nthird-party standing. All of the money comes out of our\npocket, yes, we have standing. And secondly, we\ncertainly -- and then that is in our capacity as\nhandler.\nEssentially, the Department of Agriculture's\nview is that during those couple of days when the\nraisins are going through our packing plant, that we\nacquired them and possessed them during those couple of\ndays and that we should have given them their -- their\nshare. That's raisins, that's not money. But by the\ntime they get around to enforcing that and so forth, the\nraisins are gone and now the money stands in -- stands\nin for the raisins. But that is a taking claim.\nWe think it's a -- it's a straightforward\ntaking claim under -- under Norwood and Missouri Pacific\nRailroad, that's a merits question. But in any event,\nit is not a problem of capacity. Whatever might be,\nthat taking, that taking is in the capacity as a\nhandler.\nThose are my two points.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
