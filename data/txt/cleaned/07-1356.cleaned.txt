CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear

General McAllister.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R. McALLISTER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. McALLISTER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may
it please the Court:
The Court has always held that the
defendant's voluntary statements obtained in violation
of constitutional standards may be used for impeachment
purposes when the defendant testifies at trial.
The Court has excluded statements for all
purposes only when they are involuntary or have been
compelled. The question in this case is whether
voluntary statements obtained in violation of the rule
of Massiah v. United States should be treated
differently than all other voluntary statements.
The answer is "no" for at least three
reasons. First, permitting the impeachment use of
voluntary statements obtained in violation of
constitutional standards is necessary to prevent perjury
by criminal defendants.
Second, in terms of the effect at trial,
there is no basis for distinguishing a voluntary
statement obtained in violation of the Massiah rule from
Fourth Amendment violations, Miranda violations, or
violations of the rule of Michigan v. Jackson.
In all of those situations the resulting
evidence may limit defense counsel's options at trial,
but there is no basis in that respect for distinguishing
a Massiah violation. It has no different effect than
those others. Also, the Sixth Amendment right to
counsel does not include a right to commit perjury or to
have the assistance of counsel in presenting false
testimony.
JUSTICE SCALIA: When does -- when does the
Sixth Amendment violation occur?
MR. McALLISTER: That question, Your Honor,
as you realize, is debated a bit in the briefs, it's --
Kansas for purposes of deciding this case, is willing to
accept the position of the United States and the
Respondent that it occurs when the statement is admitted
at trial, although the cases have not necessarily
definitively resolved that question. We, frankly, think
it is unnecessary to answer the question, because it's a
minimal point in terms of potential deterrence --
deterrence that operate in this segment --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you -- do we have any
other situation in which, for purposes of impeaching
testimony, a constitutional violation results?
MR. McALLISTER: Well, that's the -- that is
one of the intricacies of this particular question,
although arguably in the Fifth Amendment context
certainly the Miranda warnings are given. The police
don't do that. And if that is the completion of the
violation, it's analogous in many ways, if one looks
back at the cases.
The Court has suggested that the actual
violation is the use of the statement at trial against
the defendant, not simply obtaining it without the
necessary warnings being given. So we would argue that
is, in fact --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It's parallel to the Fifth.
MR. McALLISTER: It's parallel to the Fifth
in this respect, and certainly, it's distinct from the
Fourth in that respect. But we don't think it matters
at the end of the day. If one were to treat it like the
Fourth Amendment, so that the violation is complete when
the police send in an informant and he works hard to
elicit statements in violation of the Messiah law, if
it's complete at that time, then all of the analysis
from the Fourth Amendment cases is equally applicable
here.
If the violation does not occur until it's
presented at trial, then it's analogous more to the
Fifth Amendment and also to the Michigan v. Jackson and
Michigan v. Harvey cases, which were Sixth Amendment
right to counsel violations, in which case the Court
said it was wrong for the police to initiate
interrogation after he invoked his right but will let
the statement be admitted for impeachment purposes. So
it is exactly analogous to what the Court did in Harvey
itself.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would it make no
difference, I take it, General McAllister, if this had
been a police officer who was pretending to be a
cellmate? In this case it was a snitch, but it could be
a police officer doing inside the cell what he couldn't
do outside; that is, the police officer outside wants to
interrogate, must inform the arrestee of his Miranda
rights, but inside the cell, the police could pretend to
be a jailbird and they can get the information that way.
Is that --
MR. McALLISTER: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I
believe that is correct if -- if it's for example, an
undercover officer, someone has gone in -- in fact,
there are cases such as Weatherford v. Bursey that
involved an undercover agent who was present for
meetings with the defendant and his counsel, and the
Court indicated that the presence alone would not
violate the right to counsel. It's the deliberate
solicitation and use of statements obtained from the
defendant that would violate the Sixth Amendment.
So if a cellmate, another defendant, is the
informant who listens and hears, it wouldn't make any
difference under the Court's cases if, in fact, it was a
police officer pretending to be a cellmate who listens
and hears. Just as it wouldn't make -- it wouldn't be a
violation if there were a recording device in the cell
and the defendant talked to himself, which there are
cases of that, and it was picked up on the recording
device. The mere listening, that goes to whether there
is a violation at all. But the who, there is -- it
wouldn't matter for our purposes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, the police know that
they can get around the clear prohibition of their
questioning without Miranda warnings by pretending to be
a jailbird?
MR. McALLISTER: Potentially, yes. But,
again, the violation would go to what happens in the
cell. So if the police officer is pretending to be
another defendant and sits in the cell and the defendant
starts telling the officer things, that would not
violate the Sixth Amendment at all under the --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: No, I am assuming we are
not in the area where the jail mate is simply passive.
In this case, the jail mate made a statement that
encouraged the defendant. He wasn't just passive. He
was encouraging the defendant to speak.
MR. McALLISTER: There was certainly
testimony about what he was told to do and what he did.
It does not suggest aggressive efforts, certainly, to
find out. He may not have been completely silent, but
he certainly didn't say, tell me what you did, let's
talk about your crimes. But he did make one arguably
suggestive statement to the --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Anyway, your answer is
the police officer could affirmatively elicit testimony?
MR. McALLISTER: No, not that he could
affirmatively elicit. That's the dividing line between
the Massiah and Kuhlmann case. He was in the cell --
well, I guess what I'm suggesting is --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And for your -- you are
talking about impeachment only. We are not talking
about the case in chief. So if the police -- he
can't -- outside, when he questions the defendant and
gives no Miranda warnings, that is inadmissible, right?
MR. McALLISTER: Outside -- well, it would
still be admissible for impeachment. We are asking for
basically the same rule. It would be the same thing if
he were in the cell, deliberately elicits, knows he is
violating Massiah, it couldn't be used in the government
case in chief, but it could be used for impeachment
purposes. But that would be true of Miranda, if the
officer deliberately failed to give the warnings, got a
statement, they would not be admissible in the case in
chief; but the Court cases are very clearly, it would be
admissible for impeachment purposes.
So we are asking for a precise parallel
rule.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: You are making no
distinction, then, between the Fifth and Sixth
Amendment?
MR. McALLISTER: Well, there may be
distinctions, and there is an distinction in the text of
the Fifth Amendment that suggests actually a rule of
exclusion when you truly have -- when there truly is a
compelled statement. And the Court has recognized that
in cases such as Portash, where the witness has given
use immunity, testifies before the grand jury and the
government later tries to use it against him. The Court
says, no, you cannot use that testimony for any purpose.
So there is a difference between the Sixth
Amendment and Fifth Amendment in that respect.
But what I was suggesting is the way Massiah
and Miranda operate is similar in this context, that a
violation results in suppression of the evidence from
the government's case in chief, but it remains available
for use as impeachment.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the argument
that essentially this is like taking a pretrial
deposition, only one side isn't represented?
MR. McALLISTER: Well, with all due respect
to that argument, Your Honor, we disagree with that.
There are strong incentives for the police, frankly, not
to do this. And in part one of the reasons -- well,
there is two. One is the police know if this is truly
in violation of the Sixth Amendment, then nothing can be
used in the case in chief. So, at most, it is
impeachment if the defendant testifies and if the
defendant testifies inconsistently with whatever is
elicited.
But furthermore, given the line the court
has drawn between Massiah and Kuhlmann and what goes on
with the informant in the cell, if they can hear the
statements without deliberately eliciting them, if you
will, if the informant is present, the defendant wants
to talk, starts chatting, they discuss the crime, those
statements, the Court has held in Kuhlmann, are
admissible for all purposes, because they are not a
Sixth Amendment violation at all.
So, the police do have some strong
incentives to actually try to gather the evidence, if
they are going to, in a way that makes it usable in the
prosecution's case in chief. It's much less value to
having it solely for impeachment, which is always going
to be speculative if it were ever going to be used. It
would depend on if the defendant testifies and if he
testifies inconsistently with what he has told an
informant.
And in that regard, there are other
deterrents I would like to mention here as well. The
informant in this case, for example, in jail recognized
that he did not want to be an aggressive questioner or
obvious as a government agent. In fact, he said, I
didn't really want to ask him questions because I was
afraid if he felt I was being too nosey, I might get
hurt. So, the informants have their own incentives to
be careful here.
And in this case, it's also important to
remember that deterrence is simply one side of the
balance. And the Court has said many times even if
there would be some deterrent effect to extending the
rule to include impeachment, that doesn't answer the
question whether it should, in fact, be excluded. That
still must be weighed against the costs on the other
side.
And the Court has numerous cases emphasizing
the costs that are present on the other side of this
case. Perjury by criminal defendants is a primary one,
but also cases talking about the importance of allowing
the jury to hear the truth and to search for truth.
The jury here gets to evaluate and did, I
would argue, quite effectively from Mr. Ventris's
standpoint, evaluate the defendant's credibility. The
jury was informed, cross-examination, of the informant's
circumstances, what benefit he received, who he was, all
the things they might want to know in deciding whether
to believe him. His testimony went not solely but
primarily to the question of who was the shooter in the
murder in the case, and the jury acquitted Mr. Ventris
of the murder charge, so they did not believe, at least
beyond a reasonable doubt, that he in fact was the
shooter. And that is precisely how this should work.
We are not saying informants are always
100 percent reliable, but we are saying the court has a
long tradition, the country has a long tradition, of
putting this evidence in front of a jury. It's tested
by cross-examination, knowledge of what the incentives
are, bringing that out in front of the jury, and then
the jury decides. There are many of these cases where
-- this was a typical, one codefendant saying, "he was
the shooter," the other defendant saying, "no, she was
the shooter."
And the informant simply had information
that was relevant to the credibility. And that's the
way it was used in this case, was as impeachment on
rebuttal to evaluate Mr. Ventris's testimony in whether
the jury believed him or not.
The other thing I would remind the Court is
we are simply saying that the rule should be no
exclusion under the Sixth Amendment for impeachment
purposes, but that does not mean that the normal rules
of evidence and other rules of trial procedure do not
apply. They do. And they might well result in the
exclusion of some potential informant's testimony. So
if the government were to want to put on an informant
who had been convicted many times of perjury and the
judge said, no, I just do not think this evidence is
credible enough to even put in front of the jury, not
this person, the ordinary rules of evidence and trial
procedure would operate. Furthermore, as happened in
this case, the judge can, and often will, give
cautionary instructions, limiting instructions. All of
that remains appropriate, but there is simply no reason
to exclude the evidence as a matter of the Sixth
Amendment right to counsel.
It would be inconsistent, frankly, with --
with, really, the general tone and holdings of the cases
in the Fourth Amendment, Miranda, and even Sixth
Amendment territory, including primarily
Michigan v. Harvey and Nix v. Williams.
Unless the Court has further questions, I
will reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Ms. Saharsky.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE A. SAHARSKY
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,
AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
MS. SAHARSKY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
This Court has consistently allowed the use
of voluntary statements obtained in violation of
constitutional standards for impeachment purposes, and
that same rule should apply here. There is no question
that Respondent's statements were voluntary, and the
substantial societal cost of allowing him to commit
perjury unchecked greatly outweighs any speculative
deterrence benefit that would flow from a per se rule of
exclusion.
The purpose of the right to counsel is to
provide an adversary process to ensure that the
defendant gets a fair trial. And to effectuate that
right, the Court has excluded deliberately elicited
statements from the government's case-in-chief. But not
allowing the statements for impeachment purposes doesn't
further that right. Instead, what it does is allow the
defendant to distort the truth-seeking process, and
that's just too high a price to pay.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you say there
is no deterrent value, since the police are -- are not
going to do this if they know they are not going to be
able to use this in their case-in-chief. But there is
also no down side, is there?
I mean, you say it's only for impeachment
purposes, but, you know, why not? He -- he may take the
stand. He may lie. It is better to have this in the
bank instead of not.
MS. SAHARSKY: But there is a down side. I
mean, as this Court recognized in cases versus -- like
Hudson v. Michigan, for example, the police have their
own codes of conduct. They have training on
constitutional rules and standards. And if they violate
those constitutional rules and standards, it has real
effect for the police. It has effect in terms of
internal discipline, in -- in terms of limiting their
career opportunities.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that internal
discipline verifiable? Do police officers who engage
snitches, do they get disciplined, especially if they
are then able to accomplish what was accomplished here?
That is, the -- the testimony -- the snitch is then able
to testify after the defendant testifies.
MS. SAHARSKY: I don't think that there is
any evidence in the briefs, and I am not aware of
specific instances of discipline, but I think that that
is because this situation arises pretty infrequently.
You know, when this came up in the Kansas Supreme Court
it was a case of first impression. And as General
McAllister noted, there are a lot of reasons why the
police would want to follow the rule in Kuhlman and send
the informant in to be a passive listening post.
Because if --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: On the Federal level is
there anything one way or another, any manual that
instructs a U.S. Attorney about the use of snitches to
extract confessions?
MS. SAHARSKY: I think the Department of
Justice Manual sets out this Court's rules in terms of
the Kuhlman case and the Henry case. And then, of
course, there are also State and the Model Professional
Ethics Rules that talk about when a prosecutor can
contact a person who is represented by counsel. And
there are limitations there as well, both in terms of
the prosecutor contacting a person represented or using
an agent contacting a person represented.
But I mean, those are -- those are
deterrents. I think the police discipline is a
deterrent. But I think we also need to -- to focus on
this Court's cases in the Fourth and Fifth and Sixth
Amendment Jackson context that taking the evidence and
making it unavailable in the government's case-in-chief
is a substantial deterrent.
This Court said in each of those previous
case that not having the evidence available in the
government's case-in-chief is a very high price to pay,
because that means that the government has to come up
with other evidence that can meet its burden of proving
all of the elements of the case beyond a reasonable
doubt.
And, as General McAllister noted, it is
really very speculative, and the police certainly
wouldn't know at the time they are asking questions of
the defendant, whether this rebuttal impeachment
evidence could ever be used. It's entirely within the
control of the defendant. It is only if the defendant
-- if the government first meets its burden of proof
with other evidence at trial, and then the defendant
decides to testify, and then he testifies inconsistently
with his prior statements.
And our position is at that point that the
jury should hear the conflicting evidence just as it has
heard it in all of these other previous cases and be
allowed to make a decision about who is telling the
truth.
JUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me you are
just confirming the answer to the Chief Justice's
question. There really isn't any down side. The worst
that -- the worst that happens is maybe they can't use
the stuff. But what -- what is the down side?
MS. SAHARSKY: Again, I -- I think that
there is a down side in terms of police discipline and
the deterrence --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Has any police officer
ever been disciplined for doing this; do you know?
MS. SAHARSKY: I -- I --
JUSTICE STEVENS: I would find it rather
amazing if he has.
MS. SAHARSKY: Again, I think that most
police officers just follow the rule that this Court set
forth in Kuhlman, so that this issue has not arisen
frequently. But, you know, even if you thought that
there would be some type of minimal deterrence benefit
that would arise from -- from not making the evidence
available for impeachment purposes, you have to balance
it against the cost to the truth-seeking process that
would be incurred if the defendant could --
JUSTICE STEVENS: The defendant could
sometimes lie. But sometimes people who are in this
position in prison are not the most trustworthy people,
either.
MS. SAHARSKY: I think --
JUSTICE STEVENS: You could bring that out
on cross-examination. I understand that.
MS. SAHARSKY: That -- that is what I was
going to say. I mean, as General McAllister noted, that
-- that happened in this case. The prosecutor himself
got up and talked about the -- the informant's prior
offenses, why the informant was in jail, whether the
informant received anything in exchange for his
testimony, the fact that the informant had actually gone
back to jail after testifying -- or after serving as an
informant in this case.
JUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me that that
all confirms the fact, well, they have nothing to lose.
Maybe we have one witness who is not very persuasive,
but no harm in giving it a try.
MS. SAHARSKY: I think that the -- the fact
that the evidence would be unavailable in the
government's case-in-chief really is a strong price that
the government pays. And -- and this Court recognized
it in in Havens, in Walder, in Harris, in Hass, in
Harvey, and in all of those prior cases. And there is
just -- there is not any reason to depart from them,
because the -- the other side of the balance is that,
you know, you are letting a defendant to get up and take
the stand and -- and not subject himself to this prior
statement.
And this -- this prior statement, if
believed by the jury, is incredibly important to his
credibility, probative with respect to whether the
crimes were committed and the defendant is telling the
truth.
JUSTICE STEVENS: If it is truthfully
reported. Of course, that is always -- that is an issue
of credibility in all of these cases.
MS. SAHARSKY: Yes, every case has a
question about someone's credibility, some witness's
credibility, and that's for the jury to decide. And in
-- in this case there was ample cross-examination, and
there was the limiting instruction that the State
mentioned.
I mean, clearly the jury did its job here
because it went back and it considered all this
information. And it didn't come back with a -- a
verdict -- although you, of course, never know exactly
what the jury is thinking, it didn't come back with a
verdict suggesting it just reflexively believed the
informant's testimony.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Saharsky, I am still a
little hung up on -- on whether we would be allowing a
constitutional violation. General McAllister said that
in the Fifth Amendment area we -- we indeed allow --
allow it to be introduced in rebuttal even though that
is the actual constitutional violation. Isn't that the
case other than in the Miranda situation? I mean,
suppose you have a generally coerced confession. Would
we -- would we permit that to go in?
MS. SAHARSKY: Certainly not. In the Fifth
Amendment context, the text of the amendment itself
would prohibit the use of that statement for any
purposes.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly, but why -- why is
not that the case with the right to counsel?
MS. SAHARSKY: Because the text of the Sixth
Amendment doesn't say anything about the exclusion of
evidence at trial. What it does is it guarantees counsel
for a purpose, and that purpose is to ensure an
adversary process at trial. And if counsel is not
afforded, then it's up to the court to determine what
the remedy is --
JUSTICE SCALIA: But its real meaning is
that counsel is guaranteed at trial; isn't that right?
MS. SAHARSKY: I'm sorry. I missed the
first --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Its root purpose is that
counsel is guaranteed at trial. And here we're saying
it's okay not to have counsel at trial so long as it's
refuting a lie by the defendant.
MS. SAHARSKY: That's not true. I mean,
certainly counsel is available at trial. The question is
just whether statements that were obtained without
counsel prior to trial can be used for impeachment
purposes. The answer --
JUSTICE SCALIA: So you say that -- you say
the Sixth Amendment violation occurs before trial?
MS. SAHARSKY: I'm sorry if I suggested
that. No, the Sixth Amendment violation occurs when the
statements are introduced in the government's case in
chief at trial.
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's right.
MS. SAHARSKY: And that's because the
government should not be allowed to go behind counsel
prior to trial and gather up statements, and then use
them to prove guilt at trial. That subverts the
adversary process. When you are talking about
impeachment, you are not talking about proving guilt at
trial. You are not talking about the government
distorting the adversary process. If there is any
distortion of the adversary process, it's with the
defendant attempting to commit perjury at that point.
The Sixth Amendment is different from the
Fifth Amendment in that it doesn't say anything about
statements that are obtained and if it can be used at
trial. And that means it's up to courts to balance the
cost and benefit of exclusion of evidence. And in the
case of the government's case in chief, that balance
means that that the statements cannot come in because it
would be too much of a cost to the adversary process
that the Sixth Amendment guarantees to allow the
statements in.
But, when you switch over in looking at
impeachment, this Court said 50 years ago impeachment is
a very different story than the government's case in
chief. The interest that you are talking about
furthering there, the adversary process interest, would
not be furthered by allowing the defendant to take the
stand and be able to commit perjury unchecked. It would
not be furthered, and it would not lead to greater
deterrence by simply allowing the statements to be
unavailable for impeachment purposes, because the great
deterrent comes with the statements being unavailable in
the government's case in chief.
We just don't think there's any reason to
depart from this Court's rule that, so long as
statements are not involuntary, they can be used for
impeachment purposes.
If there are no further questions, we submit
the judgment below should be reversed.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Edge.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW J. EDGE
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. EDGE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
I guess I have basically three arguments
with the -- or problems with the State's position. First
of all, what we are dealing with in the Sixth Amendment
case here is a violation of a core enumerated trial
right, and this makes it a very different animal from
all the other cases that we are talking about. If we are
talking about the Fourth Amendment, we are talking about
something that isn't a trial right. It's a right of the
people to be secure in their homes and possessions. The
violation occurs when the police commit whatever
misconduct makes the search of the evidence illegal. But
the use of that evidence at trial doesn't work any
further constitutional --
JUSTICE BREYER: Wasn't this individual
represented by counsel? Was he represented by counsel?
MR. EDGE: Yes, he was.
JUSTICE BREYER: And he was represented by
counsel at the time that the informant took the
statement, got the statement elicited? Is that right?
MR. EDGE: No, I don't think so --
JUSTICE BREYER: I have my memo that I
haven't looked through carefully, but I would be quite
interested. I thought he asked for counsel. He was
given counsel, and subsequent to that, this statement
was elicited. I would like to know that because the
Sixth Amendment says you have right to assistance of
counsel in your defense, period. And I guess, if he had
a lawyer, the lawyer could have told him, "Don't talk to
informants in the jailhouse." He could have said, "I'm
going to talk to who I want." Or he might not have. But
I would be interested in knowing, did he have assistance
of counsel at the time the statement was elicited? It's
one thing to me if he did, and another if he didn't.
Don't know?
MR. EDGE: No.
JUSTICE BREYER: How can I find out?
MR. EDGE: No, the -- I don't know exactly
the day that this happened. I do know that he was
arrested on the 16th of January of 2004, and there was a
search of his cell on January 20th. And we know from
that testimony that -- why that's relevant that he was
cellmates with Mr. Doser by that time, and Mr. Doser
testified that he was the cellmate of Mr. Ventris for
two days. And on the second day, Mr. Ventris supposedly
made these statements.
So my best guess is that the -- this
conversation occurred sometime between the 17th and the
20th. Now, the order of appointing counsel was entered
on January 21st, and counsel doesn't enter his
appearance until January 27th.
JUSTICE BREYER: So it might be he asked for
counsel but hadn't yet received counsel?
MR. EDGE: Correct, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, do I
understand the first sentence on page 6 of your brief to
concede that there's no deterrent value from prohibiting
the introduction of these statements for impeachment?
The sentence says, "A Sixth Amendment exclusionary rule
that allowed use of uncounseled statements for
impeachment would not deter violations of the right to
counsel."
MR. EDGE: That's correct, Your Honor. And
the reason I believe this is that, as long as there's
some kind of incentive for the prosecutor to use
informants in this manner, then the only -- then even if
they are not usable in the case in chief, there is still
an incentive to use this kind of evidence, and the
prosecutor and the police will attempt to obtain it.
There's simply very little downside. The prosecutor
instructs the informant not to deliberately elicit the
statement. The prosecutor is still responsible for the
informant, because the informant is his agent, so even
if -- when the informant goes ahead and deliberately
elicits the statement, it's still a constitutional
violation. But so long as you allow it for some kind of
purpose, then there isn't a deterrent effect, and to --
JUSTICE ALITO: So in a situation like we
have here, where the law enforcement officers do not
instruct the informant to do anything that would violate
the Sixth Amendment and in fact, according to their
testimony, instruct him to engage in conduct that is
consistent with the Sixth Amendment, there's no
deterrent value in later suppressing the use of the
statements for impeachment purposes?
MR. EDGE: I mean -- I guess, maybe I am
confused. There is a deterrent -- there is a deterrent
effect from suppressing it in the case in chief, but
it's not sufficient unless it's also extended to use in
rebuttal as well.
JUSTICE ALITO: But what do you want to
deter? You want to deter them from using informants at
all, even in a manner that is consistent with the Sixth
Amendment?
MR. EDGE: No, Your Honor. What I am
attempting to deter is the sort of up-ending of the
adversarial system that this represents. There was a
question that was presented earlier about when does this
violation occur? And I think that gets to the manner of
-- or the nature of the Sixth Amendment violation. Our
contention is that the violation occurs when the
statement is extracted, and then it's further aggravated
when it's used at trial. When the police obtain these
kinds of statements, even if they are not used at trial,
it does work a harm on the defendant and his
relationship with counsel. It affects defendant's --
JUSTICE BREYER: I see the problem. I wonder
if you have an answer to another question. You may not.
I can't find it. It seems to me it's been 20 years since
this -- nearly 20 -- since the Court decided the
Michigan case. The other cases were decided even
earlier. And it's just surprising to me that it has
never come up or rarely, rarely come up that the
question of whether the State can introduce into
evidence a statement made when the State questioned an
individual who'd asked for counsel or had counsel out of
the presence of the counsel.
I mean, does that normally happen, or does
it never happen? Why is there so little law on it? Do
you have any idea?
MR. EDGE: I do not, Your Honor. And I am
really at a loss to speculate as to why that would be.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You agree with the
representations on -- from your friends on the other
side that there is no case of ours where we have
excluded a statement of evidence submitted for
impeachment, even though it would have been excluded in
this case in chief? If you prevail here, it would be
the first time that any evidence or statement has been
excluded when submitted for purposes of impeachment?
MR. EDGE: It would be a very different
rule. I think the only rule that this would be the case
so far is in Portash, the self-incrimination clause. We
are saying that the same type of rule should apply to
the Sixth Amendment. Otherwise, no, that's correct,
whenever you are talking about the Fourth Amendment or
one of the prophylactic rules like Miranda or Jackson,
then they are admissible for impeachment purposes. What
makes this case different is that it -- it involves a
violation of an enumerated Constitutional trial right.
JUSTICE BREYER: That's what I'm not certain
about. And this is why I ask -- have been asking these
questions and what I can't figure out in my own mind is
this.
I ask for a lawyer. The State has some
period of time to give me a lawyer. Now it's one thing
if what's going on is once I ask for a lawyer, the State
should deal with me through my lawyer; that's how they
are supposed to do it. But that isn't as basic --
that's like a rule of ethics in most States in civil
context and other contexts -- that's not as basic as if
I ask for a lawyer and then the State just doesn't give
me one, though it should.
That's a different violation, a different
kind of violation. One is a kind of a rule of ethics
incorporated in the Constitution. The second is what
the case is -- is what the Constitution is really about,
give him a lawyer when he asks for one. And which is
this case? That -- that's why I'm having hard time. Is
it the first or the second?
MR. EDGE: Well, in -- I think one of the
complicating factors here, Your Honor, is that the State
in this particular case didn't try a straightforward
interrogation. They sent in an undercover informant.
JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, no. I will
amalgamate that for you. I will say they are exactly
the same thing. But what I want to know is what rule is
violated, what Sixth Amendment rule. The rule -- you
heard what I said, the rule "don't talk to a guy who
wants a lawyer until you talk to the lawyer." No
communications with a client. It's a communication with
the lawyer. That's one thing.
And the other rule is he has asked for a
lawyer but you never gave him one. Now which is this
case? I mean, I first thought well if he didn't have a
lawyer at all, then it must be the second; but then I
thought they must have a reasonable time to give him a
lawyer, and they haven't violated that second.
If you have any view on that, it would be
helpful to me.
MR. EDGE: I don't know whether he had asked
for a lawyer or not. I know that he was entitled to one
at the time, and one would be appointed for him. But
otherwise--
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But we do know that
unlike the police giving Miranda warnings, there's no
warning here at all. I mean, he thinks he is talking to
a cellmate. Nobody tells him, "remember you've got a
right to be represented by counsel," and he's
essentially giving a statement without the Miranda
warnings.
MR. EDGE: That's correct, Your Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the other side says
well, practically, the defendant is much more likely to
say something that's really involuntary when he is
confronting police officers, that the reason that we
exclude in the case of a police officer is this
intimidating setting, when the defendant is in the
police station or in the cell and there are these police
officers. Now he thinks he's just with a cellmate, so
there isn't -- there isn't the coercive atmosphere that
there is when the police do the questioning.
MR. EDGE: Well, Your Honor, I think that
there certainly can be a coercive atmosphere even if you
are not talking to a known police agent. Now, those are
not the facts of this particular case and there is no
claim that the statement was involuntary. However, one
of the advantages of speaking to known police officers
is that a defendant can simply end the interrogation by
invoking his right to counsel, and that is not
necessarily a course of action that is available to him
if he thinks he is merely talking to a cellmate,
somebody who whether he wants to speak to him or not is
going to be in the cell with him for some time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, you've --
you've emphasized that what distinguishes this case from
the other ones where we have allowed evidence that would
be excluded from the case in chief and for impeachment
purposes is that this is a trial right. But the Sixth
Amendment says in criminal prosecutions you have a right
to the assistance of counsel. Well, he had assistance
of counsel here, and one of the things that counsel did
was point out the problems with relying on the snitch's
evidence and all the bad things that he did.
But -- but just like in the case of a Fourth
Amendment violation where we allow the evidence to be
admitted at trial, this Sixth Amendment problem, you
know, it doesn't -- I just don't see the -- the strength
of that distinction.
MR. EDGE: Your Honor, I think it goes to
the nature of the harm that comes from a Sixth Amendment
violation. The Sixth Amendment simply doesn't limit
itself to the trial. The exact wording of the -- the
constitutional provision is in all criminal
prosecutions.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it seems to me
you are getting away from the basis for your
distinction, then. Saying well, it's not just at trial.
Well, these other constitutional rights where we have
allowed the evidence to come in for impeachment are
indistinguishable from the Sixth Amendment right,
outside of trial.
MR. EDGE: Well, because the harm isn't
something that just affects the outcome of the trial, it
also affects the -- it affects the litigation in a much,
much deeper way. It affects counsel's trial strategy,
it affects the defendant's decision whether or not to
testify. It also --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just to pause on
that, it affects his decision to testify because it
makes it more likely that he will testify truthfully if
he is going to testify.
MR. EDGE: Not necessarily.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The focus -- the
focus on the context is at least a double-edged sword
because the harm that we are facilitating under your
rule is to allow perjured testimony.
MR. EDGE: Yes, Your Honor, in some contexts
it would. I think one of the underlying assumptions of
the State's argument with regard to perjury is that the
mere existence of a prior inconsistent statement is
necessarily indicative of perjury, and we know there are
many reasons why the defendant may have given a prior
inconsistent statement.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah, and if he has
the assistance at trial consistent with the Sixth
Amendment, those -- those problems could be pointed out.
He was -- he was he is not lying now. The reason he
said something different then was, you know, he likes to
brag in prison or whatever the basis is.
MR. EDGE: In some cases it will be possible
for counsel to vigorously cross-examine the informant.
In others it may not. But in addition to that, Your
Honor, I would also say that it doesn't simply affect
the decision whether or not to go to trial or whether or
not to testify at trial; it also affects the litigation
in a very deep way, inasmuch as the defendant is
burdened in trying to negotiate a favorable plea deal.
Every statement or every piece of evidence
that the State has affects their willingness to plea
bargain, and when the State obtains this kind of
evidence illegally, it puts the defendant in a bind for
-- puts the defendant's counsel in a bind.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think -- I think
that's quite right. But I don't see how excluding the
evidence even on impeachment helps that. I mean,
they've still got the statement, and they -- I mean, you
know -- I guess your point, you know, maybe they will
get some leads from it even if they can't use it. But
excluding the evidence for impeachment purposes doesn't
eliminate that harm.
MR. EDGE: It would, Your Honor, inasmuch it
would remove any disincentive for the police to obtain
this evidence by this manner in the first place. So
there would be that marginal deterrent factor.
JUSTICE ALITO: Which of the things that
you've just said result from the use of this for
impeachment would not be true with respect to the other
situations where illegally obtained evidence has been
used for impeachment purposes? Take the Fourth
Amendment, for example.
MR. EDGE: I think they would be largely the
same, Your Honor. The difference would be in the
interest protected. The self-incrimination clause in
the Fifth Amendment is aimed primarily at coercion of
the defendant; whereas, the Sixth Amendment aims
primarily at the preservation of an adversarial process,
the relationship between counsel and his attorney.
JUSTICE ALITO: You don't dispute that there
was a Sixth Amendment violation at the time this
statement was taken, do you?
MR. EDGE: No, I do not.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: You urged a -- a
fall-back, and you said at least that there may -- there
should be a determination by the judge that the
defendant intentionally testified falsely. And I was
wondering how that would operate. You are here in the
-- the heat of the trial, and the prosecutor says, I
want to call snitch so-and-so. And then what do we do,
just interrupt the trial and have kind of a mini trial
to test the credibility of the -- the informant?
MR. EDGE: Yes, you could, Your Honor.
Also, you could have it as part of the pretrial
suppression hearings. I would anticipate that even if
the -- if the Court were to adopt our position, these
kinds of Sixth Amendment cases are still going to be
litigated. The issue is simply going to be whether or
not the States or the police agent is deliberately
eliciting the statement or not.
So there is -- there is likely going to be
some kind of pretrial litigation regarding the
admissibility of the statements, and it could be handled
at that time.
If there are no further questions, I will
reserve the remainder of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. McAllister, you have six minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R. McALLISTER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. McALLISTER: Two points by way of
rebuttal. The balancing of the interests here is
sprinkling water under the bridge even in the Sixth
Amendment context. In both Nix versus Williams and
Michigan versus Harvey where the Court was dealing with
Sixth Amendment interests and the Sixth Amendment right
to counsel violations, the bulk of those cases make
clear that the question of what exclusionary effect to
give a violation is subject to a balancing analysis.
And that's what we are asking for here. That's why it's
treated for these purposes like the Fourth Amendment in
the Miranda context.
And Nicks itself, to paraphrase the Court,
makes a fundamental point which I think illustrates how
this works, and it worked effectively to defendant's
advantage in this case.
In Nix v. Williams, the Court said the Sixth
Amendment right to counsel -- and I am paraphrasing
slightly -- protects against unfairness by assuring an
adversary process in which proffered evidence is tested
by cross-examination. And it's done in front of a jury.
It is not about requiring the exclusion of entire
categories of witnesses or types of evidence for all
purposes.
So the right to counsel was exercised. It
was exercised effectively in this case when Mr. Doser
was strongly cross-examined by defense counsel.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Would that apply equally
for statements under oath?
MR. McALLISTER: It could, Your Honor. I
realize a logical extension is you could say just test
all of it. But that is where the -- the police here and
prosecutor pay the price of the way in which the
evidence was obtained. It's excluded from the
government's case-in-chief.
Unless there are further questions, we would
respectfully ask that this Court reverse the decision
below.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 12:01 p.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.)
