PENDLEY\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. PENDLEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn 1989, the small family business that is\nAdarand lost a Federal contract because of a racial\nprogram and the race of its owner, Randy Pesh.\nIn 1995, this Court held that Adarand had\nstanding to seek forward-looking relief because that\nprogram prevented it from competing on an equal footing.\nIn 2001, Adarand returns to this Court because\nit still can't compete on an equal footing.\nQUESTION: Mr. Pendley, treat, if you will,\nfairly shortly coming up in your argument, the Government\nsays that in a direct procurement program, these sort of\npreferences that you're challenging are simply not used in\nColorado. You say they are. Do we simply have a factual\ndispute here?\nMR. PENDLEY: No, Your Honor. The evidence is\nquite clear that the program still exists in Colorado.\nThere are a number of mechanisms -- the Government calls\nthem means; Adarand calls them tools or mechanisms -- by\nwhich the Government implements this complex statutory\nscheme that it has. It has monetary incentives, which\nincluded the subcontracting compensation clause, which the\nUnited States now asserts is turned off in Colorado as a\nresult of the benchmark studies.\nBut in addition --\nQUESTION: You don't challenge those, as I\nunderstand it.\nMR. PENDLEY: Your Honor, Adarand has challenged\nall manner in which the --\nQUESTION: But they apply only in the State\nsubsidized programs, and you're -- you're claiming that\nyour challenge is limited to the Federal programs.\nMR. PENDLEY: No, Your Honor. The monetary\nincentives apply in the direct Federal procurement\nprogram. In --\nQUESTION: I thought -- I thought the monetary\nincentives have been declared unconstitutional by the\ndistrict court, affirmed by the Tenth Circuit, and that's\nout of the case.\nMR. PENDLEY: Not at all, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: -- what they call the\nsubcontracting --\nMR. PENDLEY: Compensation clause, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Compensation clause? Didn't both\ncourts hold that that was unconstitutional?\nMR. PENDLEY: What happened was that the -- the\ndistrict court held that the entire program, all of\nsection 8(d) of the Small Business Act, was\nunconstitutional. The United States, on the 20th of June\nof '96, asked the court to narrow its decision to include\nonly the subcontracting compensation clause. On the 23rd\nof June, the district court declined.\nAt the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, the Tenth\nCircuit held the district court was right as to the 1996\nsubcontracting compensation clause, but there was a new\nsubcontracting compensation clause now in place, and it\nhad been changed sufficiently.\nQUESTION: The one that you were complaining\nabout last time around, that one has been held invalid.\nIs that so?\nMR. PENDLEY: It -- it -- Your Honor, it is the\nsame.\nQUESTION: The Government hasn't challenged\nthat. Is that --\nMR. PENDLEY: Excuse me. I don't understand.\nQUESTION: The Tenth Circuit, I thought, said\nthat the clause that you were complaining about last time\naround was invalid. It agreed with the district court to\nthat extent. The Government hasn't challenged that\ndetermination. So, what you were originally complaining\nabout is now over and gone. Is that correct?\nMR. PENDLEY: No, Your Honor, it is not correct.\nThe subcontracting compensation clause is still alive and\nit still applies against Adarand. As this Court held in\nJacksonville, simply removing that selfsame program does\nnot allow the case to be moot. The -- the United States\nis still implementing --\nQUESTION: You just answered my question.\nMR. PENDLEY: I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: You said they -- they removed the\nprogram.\nMR. PENDLEY: No, Your Honor. They did not\nremove the program.\nQUESTION: I didn't ask you if the case was moot\nor not because of it, but it's no longer what -- the\nspecific thing you were complaining about no longer\nexists. Is that right?\nMR. PENDLEY: It is not right, Your Honor.\nAdarand continues to maintain the subcontracting\ncompensation clause is in place in Colorado. It is in\nplace in Colorado and it applies against Adarand.\nQUESTION: If we disagreed with you on that, are\nthere other issues on which -- which are live and which\nyou have standing --\nMR. PENDLEY: Absolutely.\nQUESTION: And what are those?\nMR. PENDLEY: Absolutely, Your Honor.\nYour Honor, on the issue of standing or\nmootness, this Court held in 1995 that Adarand had\nstanding, and as the Court said in its Adarand 2000\nopinion, in the Adarand case and in the Laidlaw case, the\nissue is now is not an issue of standing but one of\nmootness. Has, indeed, the Adarand case been mooted?\nIt has not been mooted because the United States\nin its tool bag of mechanisms by which it applies this\nprogram -- it still has others.\nTo answer your question, Justice Kennedy, it\nhas, for example, the monetary -- the mandatory\nsubcontracting plans. These are plans that the United\nStates requires of contractors to adopt, and Adarand put\nthree of them in the lodging at tabs A, B, and C and on\nthrough K of our -- Adarand's lodging in its reply brief\nand which the United States, on three separate instances\nsince this Court ruled in Adarand 2000 -- where the United\nStates has used the mandatory subcontracting plans against\nAdarand. And in fact, all three guardrail portions of\nthose three contracts were won by -- I'm sorry. It's in\n-- it's in that yellow book, the big yellow --\nQUESTION: Are these in --\nMR. PENDLEY: -- lodging.\nQUESTION: Are these provisions you just\nmentioned in paragraphs 4 through 6 of 15 U.S.C. 637 --\nMR. PENDLEY: Yes, Your Honor, they are. They\nare --\nQUESTION: That's -- those are the plans as to\nwhich the court of appeals said in -- in one sentence, a\nrather terse comment, nor are we presented with any\nindication that Adarand has standing to challenge\nparagraphs 4 through 6.\nMR. PENDLEY: Well, as this Court said in\nAdarand 2000, the courts and parties have been confused as\nto the difference between standing and mootness, and the\nTenth Circuit was confused as to mootness and standing,\nresulting in the Court's Adarand 2000 decision and it\nappears to be still confused as to the two.\nQUESTION: It -- it says that you have no\nstanding to attack these paragraphs that we've just\ndiscussed, and -- and you don't challenge that in your\npetition for certiorari or in your -- or in your opening\nbrief.\nMR. PENDLEY: Well, Your Honor, we believe the\nissue of standing is always before the Court. It was not\nan issue -- it was not an issue in the original petition\nin 1989. Yet, standing was addressed, as it properly is\nalways by the Court.\nQUESTION: The issue of lack of standing is not\nalways before the Court. The Court -- the Court certainly\ncannot render a judgment in a case where there is no\nstanding but where a party doesn't -- doesn't present any\n-- any standing material, the Court is not going to go\nlooking to see whether, in fact, there is or not.\nMR. PENDLEY: Well, Your Honor, the --\nQUESTION: All the cases you're citing are cases\nwhere both of the parties assumed standing and the Court\nlooked into it on its own. But -- but where -- where\nstanding has been denied below and -- and the party\ndoesn't come forward challenging that denial, I don't know\nof any case where we say standing is nonetheless an issue.\nMR. PENDLEY: Well, Adarand believes that\nstanding is under rule 14(a) is fairly included within the\nquestions presented because it was plain error for the\nTenth Circuit below to hold that Adarand did not have\nstanding because the Tenth Circuit below addressed the SCC\nand yet declined to address the statutory program that\nwe're --\nQUESTION: Mr. Pendley.\nMR. PENDLEY: Yes, ma'am.\nQUESTION: Did you challenge below the Small\nBusiness Act provision, section 8(d)(4) through (6)?\nMR. PENDLEY: Absolutely, Your Honor. In\nAdarand's amended complaint on the 22nd of January of\n1996, Adarand challenged all the statutes, all the\nregulations, and all the contract provisions promulgated\nas a result thereof.\nQUESTION: Were -- were -- did Adarand bid on\ncontracts issued by States with Federal assistance?\nMR. PENDLEY: Yes. Adarand has bid on State-\nassisted or Federal-assisted State contracts --\nQUESTION: Were they at issue in the suit?\nMR. PENDLEY: It's not at issue in this case,\nYour Honor.\nQUESTION: So, the only thing that you now say\nyou're challenging are contracts -- direct contracts --\nMR. PENDLEY: Yes, ma'am.\nQUESTION: -- with the Federal --\nMR. PENDLEY: Yes, Your Honor. It's the direct\nFederal procurement program which remains unchanged.\nQUESTION: And the Tenth Circuit seemed to think\nthat you did not challenge those Small Business Act\nsections that I referred to.\nMR. PENDLEY: Well, the Tenth Circuit was\nabsolutely incorrect. It's plain error for the Tenth\nCircuit to reach that conclusion. The Tenth Circuit\nlooked at -- for example, this Court held that Adarand\nchallenged two things: number one, the financial\nincentives; and number two, the statutory and regulatory\nregimes, the racial presumptions that are their\nfoundation.\nQUESTION: Can you cite us any filing in the\ndistrict court that specifically referred to section\n8(d)(4)?\nMR. PENDLEY: Yes, Your Honor. In -- on --\nfirst of all, on the 20th of June of 1996, the United\nStates appealed to the district court and said Adarand\nonly challenged the SCC. It didn't challenge everything.\nThe district court denied that.\nThen on the -- on the 19th of -- of August of\n1998, the United States, in its appeal to the Tenth\nCircuit, said the district court held that Adarand had\nstanding to challenge everything and -- and we don't think\nthat's true. In our --\nQUESTION: Well, we have a joint appendix.\nCould you refer us to the pages where you challenged\nsection 8(d)(4) through (6)? Can you say on page so and\nso of the joint appendix, it shows that we did that?\nMR. PENDLEY: Well, Your Honor, I -- I can cite\nto the pleadings that Adarand filed in this case where\nAdarand asserted that all parts of the program, all the\nstatutory provisions that allow this program to exist and\nthe United States to implement it, have been -- have been\nchallenged by Adarand.\nQUESTION: What it says on --\nQUESTION: Was there a separate question in your\npetition for certiorari addressed to 8(d)(4) through (6)?\nMR. PENDLEY: No, there was not a separate\nquestion addressed to that, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: They didn't say you didn't file it.\nWhat the -- what the circuit said in footnote 32 on page\n84 of your appendix, the parties have not addressed\nparagraph (4) of section 8(d) at all, and because there is\nno indication from the parties that Adarand has or will\nbid for contracts governed by that paragraph's\nrequirement, we do not address it in great detail.\nNow, I take it that the problem here is that\nsince that time, you have tried to get a contract and you\nhave tried to get a contract from a contractor who has in\nthe contract the very clause you're trying to attack.\nIf I'm right about that, what are we supposed to\ndo? The lower court didn't address the issue you want to\nraise. The lower court thought you had no standing at\nthat time. You probably didn't have standing at that\ntime. You probably do have standing now. So, what is it\nyou suggest we do? Do we send it back to the lower court?\nDo we dig the whole thing? Do we do something else?\nMR. PENDLEY: Your Honor, Adarand had challenged\nconsistently -- first -- first of all, the subcontracting\ncompensation clause is one mechanism that the United\nStates developed to implement the statutory program that\nAdarand challenges. Adarand challenges not just that tool\nor mechanism by which it's implemented, but those statutes\nthat are used.\nThis Court held in Adarand 2000 that the\nsubcontracting compensation clause came directly out of\n8(d)(4)(E). That was the holding of this Court in -- in\nAdarand 2000. And so when the Tenth Circuit holds in the\nfootnote to which the Justice cited, that -- that the\nparties have not discussed it, in fact there was no need\nto discuss it because it was clear that this was the\nmechanism by which -- this was the statutory mandate by\nwhich the United States used the subcontracting\ncompensation clause against Adarand.\nQUESTION: What's the answer to Justice Breyer's\nquestion?\nMR. PENDLEY: That Adarand had standing at that\ntime --\nQUESTION: No. What are we supposed to do? He\ngave you a premise and said, what do we do? Do we send it\nback? Do we dig? Do we something else?\nQUESTION: But -- but the premise was that you\nhad no standing at the time the court of appeals wrote\nthis decision. Do you agree with that premise?\nMR. PENDLEY: I do not, Your Honor.\nThe reason Adarand does not agree with that\npremise is because the Laidlaw decision holds that once\nAdarand had standing, as a result of this Court's 1995\ndecision, that standing continued until such time as the\nUnited States somehow made the case moot as the result of\nthe revocation of --\nQUESTION: Well, I thought Laidlaw stood for the\nprinciple that standing is judged as of the time the suit\nis filed.\nMR. PENDLEY: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And subsequent changes affect\nmootness possibly, but not standing.\nMR. PENDLEY: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Is that correct?\nMR. PENDLEY: That's my understanding.\nBut -- so -- the question before the Court --\nQUESTION: My question was not quite so\ntechnical. It seemed to me that you're trying to raise a\nserious issue and the fact is that the Tenth Circuit never\naddressed it. Now, the reason that the Tenth Circuit\nnever addressed it is what they say; it's because you\ndidn't address section (4) -- subsection (4) of section\n8(d). And they didn't address it because there was no\nindication there would be any practical problem in the\nfuture because you didn't -- they at time thought you\nweren't bidding on the contract. Things have changed.\nThat's the premise of my question. It's not a\ntechnical question. It makes that practical assumption\nthat's in paragraph -- in footnote 32. And so my question\nwas, what should we do?\nMR. PENDLEY: Conclude that the Tenth Circuit\nwas wrong in stating what it stated in that footnote\nbecause Adarand specifically challenged 8(d)(4).\nQUESTION: Well, you raised it, but you surely\ndidn't address it. In fact, you didn't even address it in\nyour principal brief, and the Government has certainly not\naddressed it in their -- in their principal brief because\neverybody thought the fight was about these -- these new\nregulations that -- that modify the -- the Subcontractor\nCompensation Clause, rather -- rather than this other\nclause.\nNow, you may well have preserved the objection,\nbut the fact is it hasn't been discussed below and it has\nbarely been argued in the briefs here. Your reply brief\nis devoted to it, but the Government's principal brief\ncertainly isn't.\nMR. PENDLEY: Well, what -- what Adarand\naddressed was the -- at the Tenth Circuit was the\nconstitutionality of this -- of this racial program, and\n-- and there are a number of mechanisms by which the\nracial program is implemented against Adarand. That flows\nout of section (4)(d) -- section 8(d)(4) -- (4) to (6).\nQUESTION: That's right, but all of those other\nmechanisms the Government says in their brief have been\nwashed away by -- by the -- by the benchmark study\nprovision, which eliminates -- which eliminates the\ndifficulty. And in your reply brief, you do not contest\nthat. You simply say that despite the benchmark study,\nthere is still one other objection we have, and then --\nand then you focus on the -- on the subcontractor\ncommitment requirement in -- in 8(d)(4).\nMR. PENDLEY: It is one of the mechanisms by\nwhich the United States continues to implement this --\nthis regime, this program.\nQUESTION: And that wasn't discussed below and\nhad barely been discussed in the briefs here.\nMR. PENDLEY: In addition, Adarand -- Adarand\nnoted that the benchmark study allows it to be turned on\nand turned off, and it still can be turned -- turned on in\nthe State of Colorado.\nQUESTION: But what do you mean by that, to be\nturned on and turned off?\nMR. PENDLEY: Well, here's what the -- pardon\nme, Mr. Chief Justice.\nMr. Chief Justice, the United States asserts we\ndo these benchmark studies. We do them about once a year\nand we decide where underutilization takes place.\nNow, these benchmark studies don't comply with\nCroson because they don't examine qualified, willing, and\nable. They don't look at subcontracts, and -- and they\nassume that racial disparity means racial discrimination.\nBut the United States says, in those States in\nwhich there is not underutilization, we will not use some\nof our mechanisms, like price evaluation adjustments and\nother -- other monetary incentives. However, we retain\nthe ability to use the monetary -- excuse me -- the\nmandatory subcontracting clause, as -- as Adarand has\npointed out in its lodging.\nIn addition, the United States reserves the\npower to use these set-asides to achieve the goal.\nQUESTION: You say they reserve the power. Does\nthat mean that in a State where they say -- like Colorado\nwhere they say we're -- we're not using it, they -- they\nnonetheless do use it or that they could later use it on a\ndifferent study?\nMR. PENDLEY: That's -- that's what our lodging\ndemonstrates, Mr. Chief Justice. It demonstrates the\nUnited States is today still using in Colorado the\nmandatory subcontracting clauses. In addition, the United\nStates continues to use, as its 9 March memo points out,\nthe set-asides in Colorado, as well as the mentor protege\nprogram. So, these -- these programs by which the United\nStates uses the racial preference program in Colorado --\nthose mechanisms still exist.\nBut tomorrow the United States, as a result of\nan overdue benchmark study, could conclude, well, now\nColorado is into the underutilization category. These\nmonetary mechanisms go back on.\nQUESTION: But to the extent that your -- your\nanswer, in effect, tells us that the controversy is live\nand presented based on what you have in a lodging, you're\nreally asking us to make a -- a determination of fact in a\ndisagreement between you and the Government as to whether\nthey're being used or whether they're not being used. And\ndoesn't it make much more sense for us to send -- if\nthat's what the case is going to turn on, doesn't it make\nmuch more sense for us to send it back to facts -- to\ncourts that engage in fact-finding and that will make that\ndetermination on the basis of evidence as distinguished\nfrom our making it on the basis of a lodging?\nMR. PENDLEY: Well, the United States cannot\nassert that it does not use the mandatory subcontracting\nincentives because it's required by law. It's required by\n8(d)(4) to (6).\nQUESTION: It has asserted that. I mean --\nQUESTION: That's what I thought they said in\ntheir briefs.\nQUESTION: Maybe -- maybe you say -- I mean, and\nthey have filed a memorandum from Arthur Hamilton, Federal\nLands Program Manager. Now, your assertion is that that\nis not authorized by law.\nMR. PENDLEY: I'm asserting that it violates law\nand it violates the regulation. It violates 48 C.F.R.\n19201. Your Honor, if you could hear me out on this.\nOn the -- on the 9th of March, the United States\nwas -- on the 24th of February, the United States was\ninvited by the Tenth Circuit to provide us additional\nindication as to how this case is moot. On the 9th of\nMarch, Mr. Hamilton wrote a memo, and he said, here's how\nit's moot. We're not going to use the SCC in Colorado\nanymore.\nNow, of course, as of the 30th of June of '98,\napparently under the benchmark studies, they had stopped\nusing the SCC, but now all of a sudden on the 9th of March\nof 2000, they say, well, now we're not going to use it\nanymore.\nSo, Adarand comes forward to this Court and\nsays, it doesn't matter if they stopped using the SCC as\nthat 9 March memo shows, Your Honor, the United States\nsays, we'll use the requirements of the bar and we'll use\nthe set-aside. And then --\nQUESTION: Mr. Pendley, may I ask you --\nMR. PENDLEY: Your Honor, may I -- may I finish\nthis? I apologize. This is important to my case.\nAnd so -- so, Adarand files this lodging and\nsays, wait, look, they're still using these FAR's and\nthey're hurting us.\nAnd so, on the 24th of August, the United States\ncomes forward and says, oh, oh, wait, we've changed our\nmind. Not only are we not going to use the SCC's, now\nwe're not going to use the FAR's either, even though on\nthe 9th of March we said we would use the FAR's.\nBut whether they've abandoned the FAR's and\nwhether they've abandoned the SCC, they are still using\nthe set-asides in Colorado. And, Your Honor, I don't\nthink the United States should be permitted to moot this\ncase by withdrawing this program on the eve of this\nargument and -- and then allowed to reinstitute it as soon\nas this Court --\nQUESTION: Mr. Pendley, may I -- may I now ask\nwhat is very important, I think, in this -- in this case?\nAnd you seem to be walking away from it.\nMR. PENDLEY: I apologize.\nQUESTION: This Court is a court of review.\nMR. PENDLEY: Yes.\nQUESTION: Not a court of first view. The Tenth\nCircuit isn't even a court of first view. To the extent\nthat you are arguing things that have occurred since the\nlast litigation, one would expect you to be in the\ndistrict court with the current controversy.\nSo, one question is, what do we have? What\nlower court determination are we reviewing?\nAnd the second is, what is the concrete\ncontroversy that you have? Last time it was easy to see.\nYou bid on a certain contract. You were the high bidder,\nand nonetheless you didn't get it. Now, what is the focus\nof this case? It's no longer that contract because that\n$10,000 bonus is out of the picture.\nMR. PENDLEY: Your Honor, the -- the controversy\nAdarand presents in 2001 is that Adarand still is unable\nto compete on an equal footing because the United States\nstill has in its tool of -- in its tool kit mechanisms by\nwhich it is applying this racial preference against\nAdarand. And it is a matter of mootness indifference\nwhether it is the -- the monetary incentives, the\nmandatory subcontracting clause, the set-asides, or the\nmentor protege program. The United States is still -- it\nstill has mechanisms. It's still using it against Adarand\nnotwithstanding its attempt to tell this Court --\nQUESTION: Mr. Pendley.\nMR. PENDLEY: -- that it's withdrawn those.\nQUESTION: May I ask you just one question?\nMR. PENDLEY: Yes.\nQUESTION: I'd like you to just assume for a\nminute that you're dead right on everything you've argued\nso far. I'd like you to spend a minute or 2 explaining to\nme why you think the program is unconstitutional.\nMR. PENDLEY: Absolutely, Your Honor.\nThe first --\nQUESTION: The specific provisions of the\nstatute that you challenge are unconstitutional.\nMR. PENDLEY: Under strict scrutiny, the Court\nmust start, as Croson dictates, with the question, is\nthere a strong basis in evidence of a compelling\ngovernmental interest? Congress declined this Court's\ninvitation, and generous invitation, in 1995 to provide\nthat. Instead, the Congress said, we'll leave it up to\nthe courts. We don't know, and furthermore, let's get\nsome information on this. Let's ask the General\nAccounting Office to do a study.\nThat report from the General Accounting Office\nis in.\nQUESTION: Your first point is that the\ncongressional findings are inadequate.\nMR. PENDLEY: There are no findings, Your Honor.\nThey asked the GAO, find something for us, find the facts.\nAnd the GAO came back just like City of Richmond did in --\nin the Croson case, and said, we don't know how many DBE's\nthere are. We don't know what market they're in. We\ndon't know if they're qualified, willing, and able, and we\ndon't know how many subcontracts they win. The GAO said\nin its report the lack of information prevents anyone from\nknowing the nature of this program. And that's at --\nthat's at page 6, 26, and 27 of Adarand's petition\nappendix -- or merits appendix.\nThe second reason it's unconstitutional, Your\nHonor, is simply because it's not narrowly tailored. It\npresumes that all people of certain racial groups are\nsocially and economically disadvantaged and entitled to\nthe benefits of the program without any individualized\nfindings. There are no time requirements. It's ageless\nin its ability to reach into a person's past. Timeless in\nits ability to affect their future. There's no severity\nrequirements. There's no in-the-USA requirements. No\nother construction industry requirements. And nothing\nremoves the taint from an individual, not winning a Nobel\nPeace Prize, not election to the U.S. Senate, and not\ngraduating magna cum laude from the Wharton School of\nBusiness at the University of Pennsylvania. Nothing\nremoves the taint. And that lack of individualized\nfinding requirement demonstrates it's not narrowly\ntailored.\nAnd the regulations can't save it because the\nagency has admitted on the 30th of June of '98, we can't\nseparate the social and economic -- social and economic\ndeterminations, one from the other, because that violates\nthe intent of Congress.\nMr. Chief Justice, may I reserve my time?\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Pendley.\nGeneral Olson, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nQUESTION: General Olson, if -- if counsel for\nthe petitioner is correct, it would be fair to infer\nthere's a certain amount of bobbing and weaving going on\non the part of the Government in this case. Would you\naddress that somewhere in your --\nMR. OLSON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nI certainly will. I believe there has been no\nshowing of any bobbing and weaving of any sort on the part\nof the Government here.\nWhat we have, first of all, the Subcontractor\nCompensation Clause is no longer a part of this case. To\nthe extent that Adarand had standing with respect to it,\nthat provision of the law was declared unconstitutional.\nThe Government has not challenged that provision. That --\nthere is no evidence in this record that that provision is\nbeing used with respect to Adarand at all.\nWith respect to the --\nQUESTION: And that was the provision that was\nthe focus of the original suit?\nMR. OLSON: Yes, Justice O'Connor.\nNow --\nQUESTION: Well, cannot those under -- under the\namended statute, cannot some additional compensation be\nprovided but subject to the new regulations?\nMR. OLSON: Well, if we distinguish between that\nthe Federal aid program and the direct Federal procurement\nprogram and the Subcontractor Compensation Clause the\nUnited States Government has abandoned in all respects,\nthose provisions have not been justified, and the United\nStates Government is not employing those.\nWith respect to the clauses --\nQUESTION: You're not employing them on what\nbasis?\nMR. OLSON: On the basis that -- that they've\nbeen determined to be unconstitutional. And the United\nStates is not pursuing that.\nNow, what -- where the bobbing and weaving has\noccurred is, as this Court has identified, Adarand has\nchanged its position. It now has decided to challenge the\nsubcontractor clause provisions of the direct procurement\nactions by the Department of Transportation. But as this\nCourt noted and -- and the Tenth Circuit specifically\nheld, there was no indication that Adarand at the time was\nchallenging those provisions or that Adarand has or will\ncontinue to bid for contracts or subcontracts covered by\nthose paragraphs, the race-conscious provisions of those\nparagraphs.\nQUESTION: Those provisions were specifically\nmentioned in Adarand's amended complaint.\nMR. OLSON: They were mentioned.\nQUESTION: Specifically mentioned.\nMR. OLSON: The challenge was to the\ncompensation clause provisions. All of the litigation, up\nto the point of the reply brief in this Court, had to do\nwith the subcontracting compensation provisions which are\nnot -- no longer in this case.\nThe clause that Adarand now challenges cannot be\nand is not being applied in the areas in which Adarand\ndoes business pursuant to --\nQUESTION: Well, it certainly didn't come as\nlate as the reply brief, Mr. Olson. The -- the petition\nfor certiorari says the following, that the Government is\n-- is favoring these racial minorities -- this is on page\n2 of the petition for certiorari -- through a combination\nof compulsion and incentives. As to compulsion, the\nstatutes require every private prime contractor, on\npenalty of being ineligible to win Federal contracts, to\nestablish and adhere to a plan to try to hire DBE's as\nsubcontractors.\nMR. OLSON: The --\nQUESTION: That is precisely the issue that --\nMR. OLSON: It was -- it was mentioned in -- at\nthe beginning of the brief and not addressed -- those\nprovisions were not addressed in the arguments of the\nbrief.\nBut, more importantly, pursuant to the\nDepartment of Justice guidelines issued in 1996, those\nrace -- any race-conscious provisions in the statute may\nnot be applied in any area of the country unless they're\njustified by the Department of Commerce benchmark study\nthat shows a disparity in effect in those districts. The\nDepartment of Commerce made its study, and in all but\neight States, which do not include Colorado, those\nmeasures have been ruled out of bounds, and they're not\nbeing applied. And the Department of Transportation has\nconfirmed that.\nQUESTION: But are the benchmark studies\nconducted every year?\nMR. OLSON: They're to be conducted every year,\nbut they're not actually being conducted that -- that\noften.\nQUESTION: What does that mean?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. OLSON: Well, it's one of those -- one of\nthose Government programs that it is hoped will be\nconducted more often than they actually get conducted,\nChief Justice Rehnquist.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: But a new benchmark study could find\nthat Colorado was subject to --\nMR. OLSON: Well, it's conceivable, yes. That's\n-- that's entirely possible. But there is no evidence\nthat that will occur. There is no evidence that that is\nlikely to occur. That is not usual.\nQUESTION: Well, there -- there is evidence that\nAdarand is working in a context where regulations are\nchanging year to year in order to effect the one -- this\none goal, to which it -- it claims there is a substantial\ndoubt in --\nMR. OLSON: There is no evidence in this record\nthat the subcontract clause provisions, which Adarand is\nnow discussing, have been applied ever in Colorado or in\nthose States precluded by the benchmark study.\nQUESTION: What is the basis for not applying\nthem, Mr. Olson? That -- that's what puzzles me. What\npossible basis is there for the Government not to apply\nthem? They are required by the statute.\nMR. OLSON: Well, and also they are required by\nthe holdings of this Court to apply and interpret that\nstatute in a constitutional fashion. Precisely what this\nCourt discussed in Adarand is to implement whatever\nprograms it has in a narrowly tailored fashion.\nWhat the Department of Justice did, after this\ndecision in Adarand, is enter into a lengthy study,\ndetermined that race-conscious programs or provisions of\nFederal statutes could not be applied in ways that were\nnot narrowly tailored, responding directly to this Court's\nguidance. As a result of that, the Department of Justice\nstudy indicated that they would only be applied -- only --\neven at the outset -- in areas where there was evidence of\nthe direct effects of discrimination in Federal\ncontracting.\nThe Department of Commerce thereafter conducted\na study, did not find these disparate impact in terms of\neffects of discrimination in the areas in which Colorado\nexists. In fact, in 42 -- 42 States. And as a result of\nthat, the Department of Transportation has not used and\nhas not employed the -- the race-conscious provisions of\nthose clauses in those areas.\nQUESTION: Well, Mr. Olson, does -- are those\nclauses covered by section 8(d)(4) through (6)?\nMR. OLSON: Yes.\nQUESTION: And I thought that Mr. Pendley argued\nthat, in fact, in Colorado some of those provisions have\nbeen and are, in fact, now in contract forms.\nMR. OLSON: They are in the contract forms, but\nthe Department -- that is again another carryover of\ninstances where they probably should be removed from the\ncontract forms, but they're not being implemented or\nenforced to impose any race-conscious remedy --\nQUESTION: Well, why wouldn't the -- why\nwouldn't the --\nQUESTION: But they're in there.\nQUESTION: -- contractor have standing to say\nthat I'm contracting, I'm trying to business in a milieu\nwhere the Government has, through either prior or existing\npolicies, required contractors to put in clauses that\ninjure me, and I want those clauses removed so that I can\ndo business on a fair basis?\nMR. OLSON: Well --\nQUESTION: And he has standing to say that now.\nMR. OLSON: Well, he -- well, in the first\nplace, the three contracts that were mentioned in the\nreply brief -- Adarand was not the high bidder in those\nthree contracts. And Adarand has not alleged --\nQUESTION: High bidder or low bidder?\nMR. OLSON: I mean the low bidder. Excuse me.\nIn fact, in the submission that it -- that it put before\nthe Court --\nQUESTION: So, despite all these years of\nlitigation, he still has to litigate bid by bid.\nMR. OLSON: Well, he has got to demonstrate --\nas I understand this Court's holdings with respect to\nstanding, he's got to show some immediate impact or the\npotential for actual harm. Now, what is -- the Department\nof Justice has said race-conscious remedies will not be\napplied in these areas. The Department of Commerce has\ndelineated the areas. The Department of Transportation\nhas again, on August 24th as submitted to this Court, made\nit absolutely specific that it is the policy of the\nFederal Highway Administration that separate percentage\ngoals shall only be required in those areas where the --\nQUESTION: Well, all of this is new since the\nTenth Circuit looked at it.\nMR. OLSON: Yes.\nQUESTION: What are supposed to do now, please?\nMR. OLSON: This case --\nQUESTION: I mean, these are new things the\nGovernment is presenting.\nMR. OLSON: Well, no, no. What the Government\nhas said in this August 24 memorandum is entirely\nconsistent with what the Department of Justice guidelines\nrequire and what the Department of Justice and -- and the\nDepartment of Transportation has been saying all along.\nTo the extent that those provisions appear in the\ncontract, this -- this document, that was issued on August\n24, says contracting officers shall disregard those goals\nin --\nQUESTION: That's fine, but they're still in the\ncontracts. I'm a contractor and I have signed a contract\nthat says I will make these special provisions for\nminority firms, and I will -- I will try to get these\ngoals. And I know that I'm subject to penalties if -- if\nI do not make a, quote, good faith effort. Have letters\ngone out to those contractors that say, hey, forget about\nit? No. No letters have gone out. You just come up and\ntell us, oh, the Government won't enforce that. I --\nMR. OLSON: Justice --\nQUESTION: I don't think that that's adequate\nassurance to those -- to those companies who are competing\nfor -- for contracts where -- where the prime contractor\nhas signed a commitment to get a certain -- a certain goal\nof -- of minority participation.\nMR. OLSON: The -- the Department of\nTransportation and the Department of Justice have\nconsistently adhered to the provision that those race-\nconscious provisions will not be enforced in the direct\nprocurement program in these areas. And there's no\nevidence that they ever have been.\nQUESTION: Have they told -- have they told the\ncontractors and subcontractors?\nMR. OLSON: Yes, they have, and they\nreaffirmed --\nQUESTION: Where was that?\nMR. OLSON: Well, this -- this memorandum --\nQUESTION: This went out to Federal Lands\nHighway Division engineers. We have no indication that\nthe people who signed these commitments have been put on\nnotice that these commitments do not -- do not bind\nanymore.\nMR. OLSON: Well, Justice Scalia, it strikes me\n-- and I -- I respectfully submit that -- that you're\nswitching it around. It seems to me that Adarand has the\nresponsibility to suggest or demonstrate to this Court\nthat it's actually being hurt or that there is some\nevidence that -- that race-conscious decisions are being\nmade in the contracting process. And Adarand has not\ndemonstrated, with respect to even the three contracts it\nmentioned, that it was the low bidder.\nQUESTION: Do you think that for a single minute\nif these clauses required racial discrimination, an\nabsolute clear, patent violation of the Fourteenth\nAmendment, that we would say there's no standing for a\nminority who wanted these removed? Not for a single\nminute.\nMR. OLSON: Well, I -- I wouldn't contradict\nthat, but I would say when the Government has made it\nabsolutely clear that it is not enforcing race-conscious\nremedies, as instructed by this Court in the first Adarand\ndecision, except in a narrowly tailored fashion, and\nthere's been subsequent legislation of a compelling need,\nbut that that response to that compelling need has been\nnarrowed down to the areas where it is necessary and --\nQUESTION: But the provision hasn't been removed\nfrom the contract.\nMR. OLSON: The provision was not removed in\nsome of those contracts, and I -- I can't tell this Court\nhow many. But it is -- it is explicitly clear and there\nis no evidence to contradict that they're not being --\nthose race-conscious provisions are not being enforced\nwith respect --\nQUESTION: If they were being enforced, do you\nagree that Adarand has standing to -- to challenge it?\nMR. OLSON: If they were being enforced and\nAdarand could suggest that it was somehow affected by\nthat. And it has not been able to do that either because\nwith respect to the three contracts, its own lodging --\nand I would refer the Court in part to C1 of tab M in the\nyellow -- the first volume of the yellow submission, which\nis a sheet in which -- this is the Adarand submission.\nAnd tab M refers to one of those contracts, just as an\nexample. And it says in that document -- this is an\nAdarand document -- who was awarded the work we bid? And\nthen it circles the company who was awarded the bid. If\nnot us, why not? And it's scribbled in here from Adarand,\nwe were not high -- we were high. Excuse me.\nQUESTION: They were the high bidder.\nMR. OLSON: They were the high bidder and\ntherefore they didn't get the contract because they were\n-- were not the low bidder. And that's true if -- it\ntakes a little bit of combing through the record, but it's\ndemonstrably true with respect to those other two\ncontracts as well.\nQUESTION: And -- and you think they're --\nthey're not at risk of that happening in -- in other\ncontracts when these provisions still exist in the\ncontract clauses and all we have is -- is your assurance?\nIf I were the prime contractor, I'd say, I\nbetter not take a chance. I understand that there is\nsomewhere floating around the Government a memorandum that\nsays that they won't enforce this, but I've never been\ntold about it.\nMR. OLSON: It's -- it's -- well, Justice\nScalia, it has been the documented, articulated policy of\nthe -- since the Department of Justice study. The\nguidelines went out to all Federal agencies not to employ\nthese programs, except under certain conditions. The\nCommerce Department implemented that decision, and there's\nno evidence to the contrary.\nQUESTION: What programs? Let's -- let's be\nclear about what programs we're talking about. I\nunderstand that at an early date we said until these\nstudies are done and -- and the studies show no\nunderutilization, the compensation and the other two\nprograms would -- would not be used. But as far as I\nknow, the first indication that the contracting commitment\nwould not be used is this memorandum of August 24, 2001.\nIs -- is there any earlier memorandum?\nMR. OLSON: Well, if you look at the\nGovernment's --\nQUESTION: Dealing with the contracting clauses.\nMR. OLSON: No. But the -- what there is is a\nDepartment of Justice requirement imposed upon all Federal\nagencies not to employ race-conscious remedies in those\nareas --\nQUESTION: When -- when was that memorandum?\nMR. OLSON: That was in 1996.\nQUESTION: Well, but why, if that went out in\n1996, was it necessary to have this memorandum in the\nsummer of 2001, if that had -- if the earlier one had any\neffect?\nMR. OLSON: Well, it -- well, the memorandum in\nAugust of -- of 2001 reiterates the policy that the\nDepartment of Transportation had been operating under.\nQUESTION: Would you read me the '96 one? I\nthink it's -- it's pretty clear to me that the '96 one did\nnot cover the contracting requirement. It just covered\nthe other three programs.\nMR. OLSON: I don't agree with you. I -- I --\nQUESTION: Where is it? Where is it?\nMR. OLSON: I can't -- I can't give you cite to\nthe record, but the -- the Department of Justice memoranda\nis in the Government's appendix. It's a -- it's a lengthy\ndocument, and it makes it clear that race-conscious\nremedies cannot be used except in those areas subject to\nthe Department of Commerce benchmark study.\nQUESTION: Is there another reason here why it\ndoesn't apply and that is -- and I read this somewhere --\nthat Mountain Gravel is itself a small business and for\nthat reason the clause wouldn't apply in any event?\nMR. OLSON: It would not have applied in 1989\nwhen this case first arose. The -- that's -- that's a\nvery good point, Justice Souter. When this case first\narose, Mountain Gravel was not -- was a small business\nenterprise itself. At the appendix to the Government's\nbrief at pages 202 to 203 to 204, the actual contract is\nlisted. The box is checked, are you a small business\nenterprise. That's checked. And then on the page which\ncontains the subcontractor -- subcontracting clause\nitself, the language in there specifically says, this\nshall not apply to small business concerns. Now --\nQUESTION: Why is it -- why is it then that --\nthat what they say in the first three pages of their reply\nbrief, for example, is that they have to -- they want to\nget a sub under a prime, that the Weenomunch Construction\nAuthority got the prime. And they got the prime contract\non August 27, 2001. And when they got the contract, they\nlooked up the requests for bid, and in the request for\nbid, there was an appendix. And in that appendix, it gave\nan example of just what the prime had to have. And one of\nthe things the prime had to have was a promise that it\nwould use its best efforts to try to get subs awarded to\nsmall business -- disadvantaged small businesses. So,\nthey're saying at least on that one, we saw right in the\ncontract -- that we saw right -- right there the kind of\nthing that you say doesn't exist.\nMR. OLSON: Well, as I say, they were not the\nlow bidder on that contract. They weren't\ndisadvantaged --\nQUESTION: All right, but they're saying --\nMR. OLSON: -- by that contracting situation.\nQUESTION: -- give you three examples, you know.\nWe're a guardrail company and we're going to go and we're\ngoing to bid again and again and again. And the last\nthree all have these examples in it, which you say I\nwouldn't have gotten anyway, but maybe in the future we'll\nget it anyway.\nMR. OLSON: Well, all I can say is that the\nGovernment has announced its policy, and there's no\nevidence in the record that it's acted inconsistently with\nany application of race-conscious remedies in the area in\nwhich Adarand --\nQUESTION: So, we have just a mistake possibly,\nthe appendix C. But if that's -- if that's so, do you\nthink we should just send this back to the Tenth Circuit\nand say, okay, you sort it out?\nMR. OLSON: This --\nQUESTION: They say they're facing these clauses\nall the time. You say they're absolutely not facing them.\nColorado isn't a place where this is appropriate. And\nthat's the end of it, and let them sort it out.\nMR. OLSON: Well, I think it's very important to\nemphasize that this is a facial challenge to the statute\nand to the system. And this Court has consistently said\nthat unless there are no set of circumstances under which\nthe regulation and the statute could be enforced on a\nconstitutional matter -- that's the Salerno case.\nQUESTION: But what's -- what's a facial\nchallenge in -- in this context? I mean, it seems to me a\nlot of the questioning here and to Adarand's counsel has\nbeen to show that Adarand was directly affected by the\nthing. And so, I -- I don't think you're really talking\nabout a facial challenge in the sense we use that in the\nFirst Amendment.\nMR. OLSON: I -- I respectfully disagree with\nrespect to whether Adarand was adversely affected by the\nprogram. They have not demonstrated that they lost a\nsingle contract as a result of -- of the provisions which\nthey're -- which they've decided now to challenge.\nQUESTION: Well, they certainly in -- in the\ncase we first -- we first decided, the 1995 case -- we\ndecided that they -- they were sufficiently affected, so\nwe ruled.\nMR. OLSON: Yes, and they were affected by --\nwe're not contending that they did not have standing to\nchallenge that subcontracting compensation provision.\nQUESTION: It challenged that financial\ncompensation provision.\nMR. OLSON: Yes.\nQUESTION: Which now has been found to be\nunconstitutional.\nMR. OLSON: Yes.\nQUESTION: And it's out of the picture.\nMR. OLSON: That's correct.\nQUESTION: But now we have a new set of\narguments basically.\nMR. OLSON: Yes, and -- and to the extent that\n-- that the program, as it exists, requires people to --\nin order to be designated as a disadvantaged business\nenterprise, must file certificates articulating that they\nhave been the victim of a social and economic\ndisadvantage.\nQUESTION: What does that mean?\nMR. OLSON: Well, it's defined in the statute.\nQUESTION: I -- I could probably certify to\nthat.\nQUESTION: For yourself?\nQUESTION: Yes, absolutely. I mean, it depends\nwhat you mean by social or economic --\nMR. OLSON: Well, it's --\nQUESTION: There are country clubs I couldn't\nget into.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. OLSON: It's -- it's explained in the\nstatute both with respect to ethnic and racial prejudice\nbecause of their identity as a group without regard to\nindividual qualities, and that economic disadvantage --\nthe ability to compete in the free enterprise system has\ndiminished capital and credit opportunities as compared to\nothers in the same business area --\nQUESTION: Either -- either social or economic,\neven though the social would -- would be quite irrelevant\nto whether you can --\nMR. OLSON: Both -- well, that's a social -- the\nuse of the term in the statute described a victim of -- of\nprejudice or bias, and that has had economic effect on the\nindividual. Both of those points are required. The\nregulations themselves --\nQUESTION: I think the form is attached to the\nreply brief of the --\nMR. OLSON: No. That -- that form is a --\nQUESTION: That is not the right form?\nMR. OLSON: That is not the right form. There\nis a -- that's a -- that's a part of a notice of proposed\nrulemaking. That form has never been adopted . I'm --\nI'm reasonably confident that it never will be adopted.\nThe -- the regulations which explain in further\ndetail social and economic disadvantage are contained --\nQUESTION: I'm just saying if this isn't the\nright form, what is? The form has not yet --\nMR. OLSON: The forms -- the different States\nuse different forms. There's no uniform form. But the\nregulations explain --\nQUESTION: But apparently what -- what the\nagency proposed -- proposed on May 8th, 2001 -- simply\nsays, I hereby certify that I am a member of one of the\nfollowing groups -- you check the minority group -- and\nthat I have held myself out as a member of that group. I\nfurther certify I am an owner of a company seeking DBE\ncertification and that I have experienced social\ndisadvantage due to the effects of discrimination based\nupon my -- check all that apply -- race, ethnicity,\ngender, other. Print name, signature, date.\nMR. OLSON: But that is --\nQUESTION: That's what the agency said. Let's\nfloat this. Maybe this is what we'll adopt. Right?\nMR. OLSON: But the -- but the -- but that has\nto be looked at in terms of the -- what the statute\ndefines as social and economic disadvantage and what the\nregulations, which are in -- at pages 70 to 72a of the\nGovernment's appendix, which define -- which -- which are\nthe regulation -- Department of Transportation\nregulations. And it's a -- it's a rebuttable and\nchallengeable position, Justice Scalia. It has to be\nsigned before a notary. The agency --\nQUESTION: Well, how would one go about\nrebutting it? I mean, who could rebut it and how would\nyou go about it?\nMR. OLSON: Any adversely affected party can\nrebut it. The State may challenge it. In fact --\nQUESTION: But, I mean, what -- what would you\nhave to show to rebut it?\nMR. OLSON: Well, what you have to show to be\nentitled to certification, according to the regulations,\nis substantial and chronic social disadvantage in the\nbusiness world and that -- and that credit has been\nimpaired due to diminished capital or opportunities have\nbeen impaired due to diminished capital and credit\nopportunities, as compared to others in the same or\nsimilar line of business. I submit --\nQUESTION: Social disadvantage in the business\nworld. What is that?\nMR. OLSON: Social -- social disadvantage,\nJustice Scalia, is defined in the statute as having been a\nvictim of racial or -- or prejudice of that nature, and\nthat it has produced economic disadvantage based upon --\nQUESTION: You say just two opposite things on\nthis economic disadvantage. You say in your brief that\nthey -- you have to sign an affidavit that says my ability\nto compete in the free enterprise system has been impaired\ndue to diminished capital and credit opportunities. Then\nyou say, moreover, if you have more than $750,000 net\nworth, you're out of it. You can't qualify.\nThey say something completely different. They\nsay that if you have less than $750,000, you -- you\nautomatically qualify. So, that in fact, despite those\nwords, all that you have to say is I have less than\n$750,000. That's the end of it. You qualify. You say,\nno, that isn't so at all. You're out if it's over --\nwhich is right?\nMR. OLSON: Well, I believe that we're correct.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. OLSON: Once you -- once you --\nQUESTION: That's the right answer.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. OLSON: And I hope I said it persuasively.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. OLSON: I think the regulations are\nrelatively clear. Once you've reached a certain plateau\nof economic category, you're out. And these -- these\ncertifications are -- again, the regulations explain the\nState must conduct a relatively careful investigation of\napplications for certification. In fact, I understand --\nit's not in the record, but I understand in the last 12\nmonths in Colorado, out of 160 applications, only 65 or --\nQUESTION: So, your point, to be absolutely\nexplicit, is if you are below the plateau, $750,000, you\nstill might not qualify as being economically\ndisadvantaged.\nMR. OLSON: That's correct. That's our\nposition. And I -- and I don't -- well, that is our\nposition. I don't understand the analysis that would come\nout the other way because I think the statute is\nrelatively clear with respect to that.\nThe -- the -- so, the -- in the first place, the\ncertification process requires someone asserting under\noath, because that -- that affidavit requirement is there,\nthat subject to challenge -- Adarand itself said in its\ncert petition in the most recent case before this one that\nit was not prepared to sign a certification about social\nand economic disadvantage because it was afraid of being\nprosecuted for fraud, perjury, and disbarment charges and\nthings of that -- that sort. So, there's plenty of\nevidence that people take these things seriously, that the\nstatutory threshold and the regulatory threshold must be\nmet. It may be challenged by people. There are field\nprocedures in place and so forth. So, that's another step\nof the narrow tailoring requirement that takes place with\nrespect to this process.\nSo, we submit that with respect to the subject\nof a compelling governmental interest, this Court\naddressed that very point in its first Adarand decision,\nand -- and made it clear in the last paragraph of part\n3(d) of that opinion that the unhappy persistence of both\nthe practice and lingering effects of racial\ndiscrimination against minority groups in this country is\nan unfortunate reality.\nQUESTION: Well -- but when you get to that,\nGeneral, you have this list of people. You know, some by\nculture, you know, people from the Northern Marianas,\nMacau, Fiji, Tonga, Kiribati, Tuvalu, Nauru, the Federated\nState of Micronesia, Hong Kong. How did all -- what\nstudies put all those --\nMR. OLSON: Well, in the first place, there's\nabout 30-some years of study by Congress of disadvantage\nand discrimination, which this Court recognized in\nFullilove and in Croson and in Adarand, that is taking\nplace in the contracting industry. Those -- those\ncategories --\nQUESTION: The people from Macau were\ndiscriminated in the contracting --\nMR. OLSON: People -- people of a certain racial\nbackground and a certain color are discriminated against\nand those --\nQUESTION: But -- but this thing just sets it\nout in great detail by country.\nMR. OLSON: Well, I -- I submit that when you --\nif you were to describe different people of different\nnational backgrounds or racial backgrounds that have been\nguilty of discrimination, they may fall in any of those\ncategories. They may come from a certain country in\nAfrica or -- or a certain country in Southeast Asia or a\ncertain Hispanic community. That doesn't change the fact\nthat what the racial discrimination is has been on the\nbasis of the characteristics of skin and nationality, of\nwhich those are simply subgroups.\nQUESTION: Well, but -- but they aren't. It's\nonly those subgroups that get the preference. In -- in my\nexperience, racial discrimination is usually stupid enough\nthat it's not that reticulated --\nMR. OLSON: Well --\nQUESTION: -- that you discriminate against\npeople from Gabon but -- but not from the next-door\ncountry. That -- that's weird.\nMR. OLSON: Well, what -- what the Congress said\nover and over again, on the basis of detailed analytical\nstudies which are -- which are described in considerable\ndetail in the -- in the court of appeals opinion, and what\nthis Court has said is that there has been the lingering\neffects, unfortunately, of publicly financed\ndiscrimination in the construction industry.\nWhat you're referring to, Justice Scalia, is an\neffort by the Government. Now, we have all three branches\nof Government recognizing a significant, serious problem\nthat Government has a responsibility to address. What the\n-- what the executive branch did with respect to the\nregulations in its programs is put a number of measures in\nto attempt to meet the very points that this Court\nsuggested that are ways to narrowly tailor the remedy,\nwhich is certainly something that the Government has a\nresponsibility to do, to make sure that only individuals\nthat fall into cases where there's actual -- actually been\ndiscrimination are the beneficiaries and limits on the\nprogram to make sure that it does not go to a broader area\nor longer temporally than it should.\nI submit that what we have here is the executive\nbranch attempting to respond to a legitimate serious\nproblem that all three branches of Government have been\nconcerned about in a highly responsible way. And in the\nface of a facial challenge, it cannot be said that there\nare not ways that this -- these regulations can be\nimplemented in a constitutional fashion.\nAnd therefore, to the extent that there is a\nfacial challenge, the petitioner has not met, by any\nstretch of the imagination, its burden. If anything, this\ncase should be dismissed as improvidently granted, but if\nthe Court rules on the merits, these programs are\nconstitutional against a facial challenge.\nQUESTION: Thank you, General Olson.\nMr. Pendley, you have 5 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM P. PENDLEY\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. PENDLEY: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please\nthe Court:\nFirst of all, the -- the Department of Justice\nguidelines, the proposed reforms have never gone final.\nThey were put out in 1996. They have never been\nimplemented in the direct Federal procurement program.\nSecondly and relatedly, they have been\nimplemented to some degree with regard to the State aid\nprograms, but that case isn't at issue here.\nThirdly, the Court held in Jacksonville --\nQUESTION: How do we know they haven't been\nimplemented? The -- the Solicitor General tells us they\nhave.\nMR. PENDLEY: The -- the Government concedes,\nwith regard to the State aid program, that that's not at\nissue in this -- in this case, and that's in the\nGovernment's responsive brief. However, the -- the\nproposed reforms -- one need only look at the small\nbusiness regulations at 13 C.F.R. and also the -- the bar\nregulations at 48 C.F.R. Those are unchanged with regard\nto this race-neutral approach that the -- that the United\nStates is talking about.\nIn the -- in the Jacksonville case, what is\nnecessary for Adarand to show is its inability to compete\non an equal footing, the back end. That's what this Court\nheld in 1995, and it is still unable to compete on an\nequal footing because of these very -- various programs\nthey have in place.\nIn the City of Jacksonville, the Court -- this\nCourt refused to permit the City of Jacksonville to remove\na program and submit a new program. And this Court said,\nyou don't need to have the selfsame program to maintain\nyour challenge.\nThe Government can't simply change the program,\nplay this little shell game, and deny this Court\njurisdiction. This isn't even removing the whole program.\nThis is simply changing the mechanism by which it is\napplying it and saying, well, we're not using that bad,\nold SCC anymore, but we have this other bag of tricks that\nwe're -- we're going to utilize.\nThe -- the Court is absolutely right. These\ncontractors out there are on pain of loss of serious money\nif they don't comply with these mandatory subcontracting\nplans. The term is liquidated damages. In one contract,\nthis guardrail subcontract, it was $105,000. If that\nprime does not issue that contract to a DBE, he loses that\n$105,000. The United States takes it from him.\nThis is both a facial and an as-applied\nchallenge. We have made that clear consistently. We say\nthe statute is unconstitutional on both.\nAnd finally, let me draw the Court's attention\nto the subcontracting decision by the Tenth Circuit. It's\nat page 70 to 71 of Adarand's petition appendix. And\ntherein, the Tenth Circuit makes it very clear there used\nto be a bad, old SCC in 1996. That isn't there anymore.\nWe have a brand new SCC that's been changed and it won't\nbe quite so -- quite so non-narrowly tailored. But there\nstill is an SCC in place.\nAnd finally, Your Honor, the United States told\nthis Court that the benchmark study is overdue, and I know\nin my bones, as I know that this case has gone on forever\nby the United States' effort to make it go on forever and\nwith broad jurisdiction from this Court, that the day this\ncase ends is the day the benchmark study comes out, and\nsuddenly and miraculously Colorado is back in the\nunderutilized category and all these mechanisms apply.\nI think it's incredibly amazing that on the 9th\nof March of 2000, the man in charge of this program said,\ndon't use the SCC, continue to use the FAR and its\nmandatory subcontracting plans, and that 2 weeks before we\nfiled that lodging that showed all those mandatory\nsubcontracting plans, suddenly his instruction from the\n9th of March of 2000 was withdrawn and said, wait, wait,\ndon't use the mandatory subcontracting plans out of the\nFAR. Use the set-asides instead. And whether they call\nit the set-aside or the mandatory subcontracting plans or\nthe subcontracting compensation clause or the price\nevaluation adjustments, Adarand is still denied that equal\nfooting this Court found in 1995.\nI urge this Court to reach this case on the\nmerits because the day this Court says it's moot is the\nday Adarand gets standing again because it loses another\ncontract because this program is applied in Colorado, and\nAdarand will start this sad process again.\nThank you for the Court's indulgence.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nPendley.\n"
