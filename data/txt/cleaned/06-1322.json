LENSING\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. LENSING: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nCongress clearly set out a statutory scheme\nin which timely notice and the opportunity for\nconciliation are required before an age discrimination\nprivate suit may be brought. While our position is that\nreading -- the reading of ADEA Section 626(d) as a whole\nshows that \"charge\" encompasses notice, even if that\ndefinition is too broad and you accept only a content\ndefinition of \"charge,\" it is clear from the structure\nof the statute that notice and an opportunity to\nconciliate before a lawsuit commences is required.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, EEOC Form 5 is\nlabelled \"Charge.\" And would it be your position that\nif an employee filled out that form and submitted it to\nthe EEOC, but the EEOC made a mistake and did not notify\nthe employer, that that would not be a charge?\nMS. LENSING: We think the better rule is\nthat it would not be a charge until notice is given,\nbecause that's the only rule that is faithful to the\nstatute, that notice is required. But equitable tolling\nis available for such a mistake and that's the exact\nsituation in which equitable tolling should be used, to\nrectify a true mistake on the EEOC's part at the time,\nrather than what they have been engaging in of late,\nwhich is second-guessing the decision made at the time.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, why don't we do\nexactly that here? I mean, you say that the proper\nthing to do, now a charge labelled Form 5 has been\nfiled, is to dismiss this lawsuit; and then we wait 60\ndays; and the identical lawsuit is reinstated. Why\nshouldn't the court simply toll the case and say, now we\nhave a proper Form 5. The employer didn't get a chance\nto engage in settlement. So we hold on to the case and\nallow the 60 days to elapse, and then the complaint is\nthere. Why isn't that the appropriate solution for this\ncase?\nMS. LENSING: Well, Justice Ginsburg, to\nbegin with, the plaintiff never requested that the court\ndo that. But in a broader sense, it's not the proper\nthing to do because there's a very big difference in\nconciliation after notification and before a lawsuit has\nbeen filed. There is -- the emphasis is on let's get\nthis conciliated, if possible.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you said the same\ncomplaint could be filed at the end of the conciliation.\nWhat difference does it make that you have a piece of\npaper there?\nWhat I don't understand is the only effect\nof your position -- dismiss the whole thing, 60 days,\nstart over -- is you're making the plaintiff file an\nadditional filing fee. The complaint has already been\nfiled. The filing fee has been paid.\nNow, everything would work out just the same\nexcept the plaintiff has to pay a second filing fee. In\nthe court there are certain inefficiencies if it's first\ndismissed and then they have to docket it again. So I\ndon't see any -- it doesn't seem to make any sense to\nme.\nMS. LENSING: Well, Congress believed that\nnotice and a chance to conciliate without a lawsuit was\nthe proper way for this to be done, and there is a\ndifference in efforts to conciliate before and after a\nlawsuit is filed. And if --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I think -- I\nthink you're right about that. I mean, once the\nlawyer's involved and they're in litigation and all\nthat, they're not going to take conciliation efforts\nwith the same light as before.\nBut the question is whether the remedy for\nthat, which is some unfairness to you, is to throw the\nsuit out or try to fix it as much as possible, such as\nthrough a stay or dismissing without prejudice or\nsomething.\nWhy should the Plaintiff -- it's not his\nfault that the EEOC didn't notify you. Why should he\nsuffer the categorical sanction of dismissal simply\nbecause it's a little unfairness to you?\nMS. LENSING: I think it could be dismissed\nwithout prejudice. I think that that's fine, because\nthen you would have an opportunity, as in this case\nwhere there is a proper charge, to have that period of\nconciliation, and the plaintiff would not be out\nanything other than the filing fee, which the employer\nis out a little bit, too, because the employer never got\na prompt notice at the time of the first situation.\nBut the biggest reason --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why -- why should the --\nthe filing fee penalty, in effect, go to the plaintiff\nwhen it wasn't the plaintiff's fault?\nMS. LENSING: Well, you know, I would submit\nthat perhaps it is the plaintiff's fault when the\nplaintiff does not do everything a plaintiff can to be\nsure that a charge is filed. This particular form, for\ninstance, stated that it is for -- pre-charge counseling\nis the purpose, and that it's to determine potential\ncharges.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: May I interrupt you to this\nextent: As I understand it, if -- your position, if the\nplaintiff had filed on Form 5 and the EEOC had done\nnothing and the plaintiff then brought suit, you'd be\nmaking the same argument.\nMS. LENSING: That is true, and equitable\ntolling is available.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand that. I\nmean, that -- that seems to me a very strange argument.\nYou say since -- since the EEOC must give notice when a\ncharge is filed, if it doesn't give notice, no charge\nhas been filed.\nThat doesn't make sense. I mean, it's just\nlike saying, you know, you have a civil rule, a rule of\ncivil procedure, that says, you know, after a complaint\nhas been filed there shall be an answer within 60 days.\nAnd if no answer is filed, no complaint has been filed?\nMS. LENSING: Well, Justice -- sorry.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, it just doesn't\ntrack.\nMS. LENSING: Justice Scalia, I understand\nyour hesitancy to accept our definition of \"charge\" as\nincluding notice, but the other view --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So give me another one that\nwill enable me to rule in your favor?\nMS. LENSING: It is -- it is just as true\nand the results are just the same if you look at the\nstatute as a whole and you uphold the sense of the\nstatute and you understand that the requirement before\nbringing a suit, whether or not notice is part of the\ndefinition of \"charge.\" But there is a requirement\nunder the statute that notice and an effort to\nconciliate be made before the suit is brought. So\nunderstanding the statute as a whole and upholding that\npurpose, that it's a requirement, an indispensable\nprerequisite to a lawsuit, is a different way of getting\nto the same result.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: All right. Now, does --\ndoes the person who's filed a proper charge know whether\nnotice has been given or not? Is a copy of the notice\nalways given to the filer.\nMS. LENSING: I don't know if it always is.\nCertainly when it's not given, it is not. But, yes, I\nthink the person easily can contact or find out from the\nEEOC, what is happening with my, what she believes or\nmay not believe is a charge. In this particular case,\ncertainly she did within the time limits because she\nfiled a charge later.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: After she had a lawyer.\nBut is it -- is it not the practice at the EEOC when\nyou're dealing with an unrepresented person who files\nthe intake questionnaire and if the SEC reviewer thinks\nthat it fits within the statute, that the Form 5 will be\nfilled out, not by the layperson, but by the EEOC\nofficer herself?\nMS. LENSING: Well, I think that the, the\npractice has been so inconsistent and that's part of the\nproblem. Two field agents in this particular case, one\nin '01 and one in '02, because she submitted the\nquestionnaire twice, two field agents did decide that it\nwas not a charge and did not treat it as a charge -- no\ncharge number, no notice. They decided it was not a\ncharge. And so no Form 5 --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's not the\nquestion. The question I asked is if they decide that\nthe, what the intake -- the information on the intake\nquestionnaire fits within the statute so that the claim\ncan go forward, isn't it the practice not to ask the\nlayperson to fill out the Form 5, but for the EEOC to do\nit itself?\nMS. LENSING: I don't believe so, Your\nHonor. The website says, for instance, until 2 months\nago -- for 2-1/2 years the Web site, which is probably\nthe way the agency gets out information to more people\nand more employees than any other way, says when the\ncompleted signed Form 5 is received back in the field\noffice --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, it has to be\nsigned.\nMS. LENSING: Well, this -- right. Received\nback in the field office -- in this case, for instance,\nboth the questionnaire and the charge were filled out by\nher, by the, by the employee.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, she filled out hers\nafter she was already in court and had a lawyer. But I\nthought that this statute, as all the statutes EEOC\nadministers, are designed for claims that are put forth\ninitially largely by unrepresented people. And the\nnotion is that the agency should make it as easy as\npossible for them to get through the legal process.\nMS. LENSING: It -- the form does say, the\nform that she filled out, the intake questionnaire, does\nsay that someone will talk with you after you fill this\nout. It does not say that they will fill out the\ncharge. In our experience the charge is very often\nfilled out by the employee.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It said it wasn't a charge,\ndidn't it? Didn't it say that it's not a charge?\nMS. LENSING: Yes, it did. Well, it did not\nsay that this is not a charge, which I think would be a\nbetter practice if it did say that in the future. But\nit said the purpose of this is for precharge\ncounseling --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Precharge counseling.\nMS. LENSING: -- and for determination\nwhether we have jurisdiction over potential charges. So\nwe think the plain language of the form --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do we know --\nperhaps this is a question your friend on the other side\nwill be able to answer better than you. But do we know\nwhere she got the form, why she filled it out? I\ncouldn't find in the record whether this was given to\nher by someone at the EEOC or whether she downloaded it\nfrom the website or what.\nMS. LENSING: We do not know, or I do not\nknow. It is not in the record. You're correct.\nThe problem is, is that the practice at EEOC\nhas been so inconsistent, both the, what they call a\ncharge, what they recognize as a charge, and their\ntreatment of documents as a charge. Again, the Web site\nclearly says a Form 5 that is signed and completed and\nreceived back in the field office is a charge. That is\nwhen your charge is filed. And yet we have two memos\nthat went out, one after the Edelman case and one after\nthe opening brief in this case, to field agents that\nsay, no, you're supposed to use this manifest intent\ntest.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I agree completely\nwith everything you said. I just don't understand your\nleap from government incompetence to saying the\nplaintiff loses.\nMS. LENSING: The plaintiff does not lose.\nAnd that is the difference in this situation and the\nLogan case, which the government, I think, and also the\nRespondent have cited. The plaintiff does not lose,\nbecause equitable tolling is available. Now, in our\ncase --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What happens -- what\nhappens if -- in this case it's not a problem, but I can\nimagine it would be in many cases -- - if you have a\n300-day or a 180-day problem, you withdraw the\ncomplaint, and then you're out there and the clock keeps\nticking, and you get past the 300 days and you are\ntotally out. That's why it's important not to follow --\nto say, well, it's, it doesn't make any difference, if\nwe dismiss this complaint, she comes back in 60 days.\nWell, but 60 days may be 360 days.\nMS. LENSING: Yes, Your Honor. That's where\nequitable tolling comes in. That's the purpose of\nequitable tolling.\nIf the situation is that you have missed the\ntime to file the charge, either the 180 or the 300 days,\nequitable tolling saves from you that. In other words,\nyou can now file the charge.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think\nMs. Kennedy is entitled to equitable tolling in this\ncase?\nMS. LENSING: Ms. Kennedy didn't need\nequitable tolling, because in this case she caught the\nsituation before the time ran and she filed a charge.\nThe problem in this case is that she chose not to file a\nlawsuit based on that charge, and she decided to do that\nfor quite some time. She did finally get -- you know,\nonce the charge was filed, the EEOC recognized it as a\ncharge, they gave notice to us, the employer. They\nbegan the time --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess she,\nreasonably or otherwise, thought there already was a\nlawsuit.\nMS. LENSING: Well, not after the lawsuit\nwas dismissed, Your Honor. I mean after the lawsuit was\ndismissed, she got the right to sue letter and she still\ndid not bring a lawsuit. She had 90 days from the right\nto sue letter and she still did not bring a lawsuit.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Wasn't she appealing?\nMS. LENSING: Pardon me?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Wasn't she appealing the\ndismissal?\nMS. LENSING: Yes, Your Honor.\nBut, you know, the equitable tolling is not\nneeded where you file within the 180 or 300 days. All\nyou have to do is file a --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Did you undertake\nconciliation efforts after her formal, her filing of the\nForm 5 charge?\nMS. LENSING: We were in a lawsuit, Your\nHonor, and so that sort of changes everything. We\ncan't, we can't talk to her. We can't -- you know, the\ndiscovery process is what you then would use to\ninvestigate, rather than an informal investigation. And\nthat never occurred and that's part of the problem here,\nbecause we spent a long, long time on the motion to\ndismiss. It was finally dismissed. Then it was on\nappeal, and it's still on appeal. So we haven't had\nthat opportunity, although she is a current employee;\nthat this has been in litigation, and that changes the\nface of conciliation completely.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If the employee files an\nintake questionnaire but not a Form 5, would you say\nthat there would be equitable tolling, or would you say\nthat the employee wouldn't be entitled to equitable\ntolling because the employee didn't file the right form?\nMS. LENSING: I think that unless she was\nrelying on the EEOC, and there have been cases like that\nin which the EEOC says, the field agent says, that's all\nyou need to do, this is a charge and notice is going to\nissue. If that were -- if there were some evidence of\nthat in the record, which of course this record is\ncompletely silent. The plaintiff chose to put no\ninformation in about whether she believed, didn't\nbelieve or what she was relying on. But in a situation\nwhere the EEOC misleads her, yes. I would certainly say\nno in a situation where the form clearly says that it's\nprecharge.\nJUSTICE ALITO: I don't see much difference\nbetween the substance of these two forms, other than the\nfact that the Form 5, I think, requires a listing of the\nnumber of employees that the employer has. What -- they\nbasically cover the same ground.\nMS. LENSING: There is very little\ndifference, you're exactly right, in the information\nrequested. The difference is that one is an intake\nquestionnaire and not a charge, and the other is a\ncharge. And the EEOC, which we think is a good idea,\nhas had a multistep process, so that lay people that\ncome in and say, you know, I have this charge of\ndiscrimination, it happened to me when I was working in\nFrance, they can go through those and say that's not,\nthat's not a charge, and they can read through them and\nnot have to process everything as a charge. That's the\nreason for the intake questionnaire. But it is simply\ngiving the information to the EEOC and not a charge, and\nmust be treated, must be treated differently.\nYou know, going back, Justice Ginsburg,\nbecause I don't think I ever finished the answer to your\nquestion some time ago. One of the problems with\nstaying the lawsuit is if that were the answer, then we\nwould be doing away with presuit notice, because anybody\ncould go in on an intake questionnaire a year later\nbecause, remember, nothing is happening to --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, I don't understand\nthat, because EEOC is a responsible agency. Congress\nhas told it: You weed out the people complaining about\nsomething that happened in Paris, and then you give\nnotice. But the notice obligation -- and I understand\nit is EEOC's, not the complainant's. So we would not\nexpect this agency -- yes, it messed up in this case --\nroutinely not to give notice, routinely not to engage\nthe employer in conciliation efforts.\nMS. LENSING: But that is the problem. If\nyou -- they are routinely not giving notice of intake\nquestionnaires, and they are not supposed to. We agree\nwith them. And twice this happened. And only 5 years\nlater after it got to this Court did the EEOC write a\nmemo and say, oh, those field agents were wrong. But we\nneed to take the opinion of the EEOC at the time. And\nof course this was a very reliable, very justified\nopinion of the field agents because it clearly said on\nthe form it was precharge.\nBut if you -- if you just say the lawsuit,\nthat means that anybody that files an intake\nquestionnaire can come in 2 years later because it's not\nbeing processed, so no notice to sue letter will ever go\nout, and so there is no end to the statute.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the new form,\nthe EEOC's new form -- I suppose responsive to this case\nand others like it -- that says if you don't file any\nother administrative complaint, we'll count the intake\nquestionnaire as the charge?\nMS. LENSING: Well, that's -- that's an\ninteresting form because that means it you come in the\nday after the act of discrimination, that form is filled\nout; it is neither a complaint nor a charge. Who knows\nwhat it is until 300 days run. So at the end of 300\ndays, if the -- if the complainant has not filed another\nwriting, then there -- there can be no prompt notice.\nThen it is -- has morphed into a charge; then there can\nbe no prompt notice to the employer.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If the EEOC treats it as\na charge, then the EEOC is obliged to give notice.\nMS. LENSING: But they won't know if it's a\ncharge until the entire time runs, to know if it's the\nonly timely filed document, because it says it's only a\ncharge if you don't file anything else on time. You\nhave 300 days to do that.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Where -- where does it\nsay if you don't file it's only --\nMS. LENSING: If it's the only timely\ndocument filed --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.\nMS. LENSING: -- means that no other\ndocument within the time period, which is 300 days.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's the new form.\nMS. LENSING: In deferral stage. Yes.\nThat's the form, yes, Your Honor, the form in footnote\n3, I believe, of the EEOC's brief.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And where in the form\nthat --\nMS. LENSING: I'm sorry. Footnote 2, I\nthink, on page 3.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The new form does say\nthat, that if no other paper is filed, this can be\ntreated as a charge?\nMS. LENSING: This will be a charge, if no\nother timely allegation of discrimination is -- is\nfiled.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Doesn't that eliminate the\nwhole purpose of the -- of the preliminary document, to\nweed out those charges that relate to employment in\nFrance?\nMS. LENSING: It does. It does completely.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It will -- it will be a\ncharge even if it's in France?\nMS. LENSING: Right. It should be. Now, I\nthink the practical matter is, Justice Scalia, that if\nnobody does anything ever -- you don't file suit, you\ndon't try to rely on it -- they don't give notice and\nthey don't --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think that's right. I\nthink what it boils down to is it'll be a charge if we\ndecide to give notice, and it won't be a charge if we\ndon't decide to give notice.\nMS. LENSING: Exactly.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Which is very nice for the\nEEOC, but not --\nMS. LENSING: Which can only happen at the\nend of a long period of time, which means that the\nnotice will not be prompt.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, the\nGovernment relied in its brief very heavily on the\nChevron case, saying we should defer to the agency's\nregulations, and on the Auer case, saying we defer to\nthe agency to tell us what its regulations mean. And\nyou didn't cite either of those cases in your reply\nbrief. So I wonder what your answer is to that\nargument.\nMS. LENSING: Well, the -- the regulations\nare certainly entitled to deference, and taken as a\nwhole, the regulations, just as the statutes, require\nnotice. But what the EEOC's position is, is the\nregulations that describe what a charge is are not\nenough, and the entire definition is not embodied in the\nregulations. You have to go to -- to memos we wrote and\nto a compliance manual, which is not in the record and\nis not attached to the brief and is not available to\nemployees or most lawyers, readily.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But if they do that why\ncan't -- and you don't -- if they don't give you the\nnotice, well, then you can complain, they didn't give us\nthe notice.\nMS. LENSING: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But if you're not hurt by\nit, what difference does it make?\nMS. LENSING: Well, I agree if we get the\nnotice, we cannot complain.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And if you don't get it,\nyou can't complain, if you actually knew about it.\nMS. LENSING: I -- I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: If you didn't know about\nit, then -- then you have a complaint.\nMS. LENSING: Justice Breyer, I agree. If,\nfor instance, a plaintiff gave us the notice and the\nEEOC didn't -- didn't file it, I agree, because notice\nis the important thing; but that's not what happened.\nThat is just simply not what happened.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well -- well, then you'd\nhave the complaint if you didn't, et cetera, but so\nwhat? In other words, if the EEOC wants to have a very\nbroad definition that turns 90 percent of its --\nwhatever this thing is called, the statement -- I\nforgotten the name, sorry. What's the name of this\ndocument? The intake questionnaire.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Intake questionnaire.\nMS. LENSING: Intake questionnaire.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. If it has a broad\ndefinition that says this counts as a charge, so what?\nLet it do it. Who's hurt?\nMS. LENSING: If they treat it as a charge\nand give notice, I have no problem.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And if they don't, you\ncomplain about that.\nMS. LENSING: Well, where do you -- the\nproblem is that there no place to complain. You didn't\nget notice; you didn't get a chance to conciliate; the\nentire --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You complain just as you're\ndoing now, in court. You just the same words, but\ninstead of using the words as against the word \"charge,\"\nyou use those same words you've all said in your\nexcellent arguments, except you attack the fact you\ndidn't get the notice, and there you're really hurt. Or\nif you're not, it doesn't matter.\nMS. LENSING: Exactly. If you're not, it\ndoesn't matter.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, all right. So what's\nwrong with that?\nMS. LENSING: Well it's -- it's the\nsituation where you are hurt that's the problem. The\nproblem is that we need a better rule that's faithful to\nthe statute, where notice is given. And --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you're only --\nwhen you say you're hurt, the only prejudice that you\nrely on is the fact that you didn't have an opportunity\nto go through prelitigation conciliation.\nMS. LENSING: We didn't have prompt notice.\nWe could not investigate --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But -- but my point\nis, you're not alleging prejudice from the lack of\nprompt notice. In other words, it's not a situation\nwhere you'd say if we had notice we would have done\nthis, and that would have prevented everything.\nMS. LENSING: Well, we don't --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your only prejudice\nis the lack of conciliation period.\nMS. LENSING: Well, I don't think that's the\nonly prejudice, and this is what somewhat speculatory\nbecause it did not happen; but generally if you have\nprompt notice, particularly without a lawsuit, you can\ninvestigate; and if you don't have prompt notice,\nsometimes you have destroyed documents in the regular\ncourse of your business that are helpful to you. That\nhas happened to us. You have employees who are\nwitnesses who are gone; you don't know where they are.\nYou have all sorts of things that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do we know whether that's\ntrue in this case?\nMS. LENSING: Do I believe that's true in\nthis case?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do we know whether -- I\nmean the difference -- what you are suggesting would be\nperfectly fine is once the charge was filed, and this is\na lawsuit, and then you would investigate or whatever,\nbut you would be under exactly the same disadvantage if\nthe time lapse has meant that employees have left, that\nyou have -- you have removed evidence as old and\ndisposable. It wouldn't -- you would -- on your\nscenario of what would be the right way to do this\nlawsuit, you would be -- you would suffer the same\ndisabilities in terms of documents and witnesses.\nMS. LENSING: That is true. Had -- had\nthis -- well, the charge, the only timely charge we did\nget notice of, and so if there had not been a lawsuit we\ncould have investigated, and you're a little bit\nestopped from the investigation when a lawsuit is\npending because you've got rules of discovery and that\nsort of thing. And --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. I thought you\nsaid you were deprived of something else. I mean, the\nstatute provides for a conciliation process in which you\ncan talk to the employee and say, you know, what\nhappened? And you may well be able to satisfy the\nemployee with -- before -- before she lawyers up.\nI think it's a big disadvantage to -- to\nhave no contact with the employee until there's a lawyer\non the other side, and you can't talk to her\nconfidentially; you can't make a conciliation notice. I\nthink that's a considerable disadvantage, and it's --\nit's a situation that the statute did not envision.\nMS. LENSING: And I agree, Justice Scalia.\nI think they did -- the statute did envision it because\nit does require prompt notice. That's -- that's exactly\nwhere I was going next, is it's notice for investigation\nand the opportunity to conciliate without a lawsuit\npending.\nAnd particularly in this suit and in many\nothers now, when you have the piggyback situation, a\nplaintiff is in a lawsuit and others are attempting to\npiggyback off of her charge, she may not at that point\nfeel that she can conciliate just for her -- herself;\nbut before suit, that is a very good situation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, as a practical\nmatter, you can't conciliate after suit anyway. You can\nnegotiate with the lawyer --\nMS. LENSING: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- on the other side.\nMS. LENSING: That's absolutely right.\nMr. Chief Justice, I didn't finish the\nquestion you had asked me about deference in the Auer\ncase. The Auer case is an interpretation of a\nregulation, and in this case the regulation says nothing\nabout manifest intent, and that is just a wholly new\nsituation that --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: How is it -- how is it new?\nI thought that you argued for that test in the court of\nappeals.\nMS. LENSING: Well, in the court of appeals,\nas the test had been administered by other courts which\nrequired evidence --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, didn't -- didn't your\nbrief say that was the appropriate test?\nMS. LENSING: Because in that court we were\nbound by precedent and that was the test, but we said --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you -- I know you're\nbound by precedent, but if you think it's wrong, you can\nsay it's wrong. And, as I understand, you did not say\nit was wrong; you adopted it.\nMS. LENSING: Well, we -- the manifest\nintent test that we talked about was the one the courts\nhave used, which is the situation we were talking about,\nwhere equitable tolling should occur. And that is where\nyou have, in the record, reliance on the EEOC that\nyou've done everything you need to do and this is a\ncharge.\nThat is not the case under the Second\nCircuit's ruling, where they just say: Just look at the\ndocument and if you think that she wanted you to file a\ncharge, that's enough. That's a very different intent\ntest than the other courts accept.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, what is your test?\nWhen is it a charge?\nMS. LENSING: When notice --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And don't tell me when\nnotice is given.\nMS. LENSING: Yes, sir. Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: My goodness. It's like\nsaying there's no complaint until an answer is filed.\nMS. LENSING: Well -- I'm not -- and that's\nwhat I'm saying --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's just not true.\nMS. LENSING: But -- but notice is required\nfor the suit. So, while a charge may be a charge before\nnotice is given, and I understand your reluctance to\naccept that definition, but --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, only because I'm sane.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. LENSING: A point well taken.\nWe still -- we still get to the same place\nif you -- if you accept the position that notice is\nrequired in the statute and suit can't be brought.\nMaybe there is a minimal charge, but suit cannot be\nbrought on that minimal charge until notice is given, is\na more sane way to put it.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If she had the obligation\nto give notice, you would have a much stronger argument,\nbut the statute places that burden on the EEOC, not on\nthe lay complainant.\nMS. LENSING: The burden is on the EEOC, and\nthat is why there's equitable tolling. But the\nplaintiff needs to demonstrate in the record she's done\neverything she can.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But there can't be\nequitable tolling unless she has really filed a charge.\nSo sooner or later -- you cannot run away from it --\nyou're going to have to give us a definition of what a\ncharge is.\nMS. LENSING: A charge --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're only going to give\nher equitable tolling if in fact she's, she's filed a\ncharge. And you don't give me any -- unless you want to\nfall back on the manifest destiny rule or --\n(Laughter.)\nMS. LENSING: No. A charge needs to clearly\ndelineate that it's a charge. And I think the EEOC\ncould do that if they knew they had to live by that, and\nthen we're perfectly happy with the EEOC defining\n\"charge\" as long as they consistently define it and give\nus notice.\nYour Honor, I'd like to reserve the rest of\nmy time if there are no more questions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms.\nLensing.\nMr. Rose.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID L. ROSE\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. ROSE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI'd like to make two points initially. And\nI'll make them briefly, and I'll try not to re-cover the\nground that's been covered by a number of the questions.\nThe first major point is that the statute\nand the -- well, this has been made sort of -- the\nstatute and the regulations state that, after a charge\nhas been filed, the responsibility for sending the\nnotice and docketing the case is upon the commission.\nIt's not on the aggrieved individual. The argument that\na petitioner has -- the charging party, excuse me, or\naggrieved individual has a duty to provide notice is\njust absolutely flatly inconsistent with the statute, as\nJustice Scalia was just stating.\nI want to make a second point which ha also\nbeen alluded to by, I think, Justice Breyer and others.\nThe Petitioner suffered no harm from the fact Ms.\nKennedy filed a Form 283 rather than a Form 5, which is\nentitled \"Charge,\" because EEOC did not give prompt\nnotice to the defendant Federal Express, the Petitioner\nhere, on May 30th. EEOC did not send the notice of the\nfiling of the charge until sometime after August 20th,\n2002. That is, it was more than 60 days. So that even\nthough the charge was filed and -- EEOC did absolutely\nnothing with it. No notice. And it's in the appendix,\nif you look at Joint Appendix 294-296.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is this after the real\ncharge was filed or what everybody concedes --\nMR. ROSE: Form 5.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The charge form.\nMR. ROSE: The charge Form 5 was file on --\nwell, she signed it on the 30th. It may have been filed\na couple of days later. But whatever it was, that was\nsubmitted. I sent it to the EEOC by, I think, FedEx.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But suit was pending at\nthat time.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. ROSE: Well, I used FedEx --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's pretty risky.\nMR. ROSE: I used FedEx for a record because\nI can use their tracking. Some of the tracking\ndocuments are in the joint appendix. I dealt with -- I\ndealt with FedEx in the Bost case. I call it Bost. I'm\nnot sure whether it's \"BOSST\" or \"BOEST.\" He calls\nhimself Tony, so I don't know.\nIn any event --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Answer my question. Was\nsuit already filed at that point?\nMR. ROSE: Yes, sir. Suit had been filed\nearlier.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. ROSE: All right, let me address your\nquestion, if I may. There is a period for conciliation.\nWe have records from the EEOC which we sent copies of to\nopposing counsel by e-mail yesterday, and perhaps we\nshould have done it earlier, that show that something\nlike 240 -- I may have the wrong number -- over 200\ncases that were filed -- charges, excuse me, by EEO --\nfiled by employees of FedEx with the EEOC. Not one had\nbeen conciliated from 1997 through 2005. Not one.\nZero.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wait. I'm sorry. 247\nduring that whole period?\nMR. ROSE: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's the only number of\nmistakes they have made; is that what you're saying?\nMR. ROSE: No. That's the only mistakes\nthat we know that EEOC made with respect to -- I'm not\nsaying that all of them should have been served or\nanything like that, but there were --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm astounded if that's the\nonly number of mistakes they made, from 19 --\nMR. ROSE: No, no. This is only with\nrespect to FedEx.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, with respect to FedEx.\nMR. ROSE: And it's age claims.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh.\nMR. ROSE: That date is -- I had to ask for\nit, but it is public, and I checked again yesterday with\ncounsel for the EEOC, which I'm also representing here\ntoday.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But are you telling us\nstuff that's not in the record at all? Why is that\nrelevant to the argument here?\nMR. ROSE: Well, it's relevant because this\nis a complaint that was dismissed before any evidence\nwas taken, and therefore any set of facts that's alleged\nin the complaint is assumed to be true for purposes of\nits trial B motion. So there was no discovery. We\ndidn't have a chance to do any discovery. The district\ncourt threw us out on a motion to dismiss. Now, it was\nmorphed into a summary judgment motion functionally, but\non the very limited topic of what there was.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What is the point of these\nstatistics? To show that conciliation wouldn't have\ndone any good? Is that what you --\nMR. ROSE: Yes. And, furthermore, I cite to\nyou the fact that since --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I thought conciliation\nwas an important policy of the EEOC.\nMR. ROSE: EEOC does very little within 2\nmonths, Your Honor, of anything, of receipt of the\ncharge.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But you want us to write\nan opinion saying, we're not concerned with\nconciliation? We just --\nMR. ROSE: No. I think conciliation is\nimportant. I think what -- if this is treated as the\ncharge, as I think it should be, under the definition in\nthe regulation, it's -- it's in 16 --29 CFR 1626. It's\nin 3.6 and 8(b) of that regulation. The original\ndocument is a charge because it identified the\nRespondent, identified the kind of discrimination, and\nthe person signed it. That's all that's needed under\nthe regulation. That regulation is lawful.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What if the person fills out\nan intake form, checks the box that says \"I do not\nconsent to have my employer notified\"?\nMR. ROSE: I think that's a question that's\nnot presented here, and I think that's a question that\nis best -- best left to EEOC. The -- that form says on\nit that we don't -- you don't need to let us notify.\nThere's a footnote or something. We don't -- you don't\nneed to let us -- you don't need to agree at this stage\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What's -- what's wrong with\nthis? Why don't I -- I mean, I do believe that the\nthing either is a charge or isn't a charge before the\nEEOC decides whether it's going to give notice or not.\nIt either is or isn't.\nNow, what about this: It is a charge if it\nreasonably appears to be a charge, or if you want to say\n\"manifest intent,\" that's okay, too.\nNow, if you signed a document which -- which\nsays that it is a prefiling document and the purpose is\nto discuss a future charge, it seems to me you know, or\nought to know, that this is not a charge.\nAnd we can't run the system for people who\nare either illiterate or don't even have friends who are\nliterate. We can't run a system that way. So I look at\nthis, and I say this is not a charge.\nMR. ROSE: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Now, if the EEOC chooses to\ngive notice, then I guess you could say one that's close\nto the boundary line becomes a charge retroactively, and\nthere is -- there is no harm done. You can have the\ncounseling, and so forth.\nBut when you come in with something that\ndoesn't look like a charge, it seems to me if there is\nno notice given and you get into the situation that is\nhere where the company has been deprived of the\nconciliation opportunity, deprived of the opportunity to\npreserve evidence and whatnot, it seems to me the fault\nshould lie on your client, because she filed something\nthat any reasonable person should know is not a charge.\nMR. ROSE: Your Honor, I differ on this. I\nthink many reasonable persons don't know what a charge\nis, particularly if, like Miss Kennedy, she had never\nfiled a charge before. And just let me complete it if I\nmay.\nShe had never filed a charge before. She\nhad never complained. She had tried to complain\ninternally, but she had never filed a charge before.\nShe didn't know what it was. I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Whatever it was, this thing\nsays it's a precharge document.\nMR. ROSE: Your Honor, it says -- if you\nlook at the two-part form, it's very small writing.\nIt's at the bottom. It doesn't say it's a precharge\nform. It says the purpose of this questionnaire is to\nsolicit information to enable the Commission to avoid\nmistakes.\nAnd then it says routine uses, and it says\npotential charges, complaints or allegations, and to\nprovide counseling --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: This is where -- you're\nreading from where?\nMR. ROSE: It's two -- I'm sorry. It's 265,\nI believe, (J) 265, it's the two-page printout. And the\nhandwriting is her handwriting on the top. That's a\nXerox of her handwriting.\nJustice Scalia, I would further add that I\n-- she was not my client when she filled this out, as\nthis document makes clear, because she checked the box\n\"not represented.\"\nBy the time I asked her if she had filed a charge,\nand she said, oh, yes, I went and got the document from\nthe EEOC, and I sent it in.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is that in the record?\nMR. ROSE: No. But -- but it is, Your Honor\n-- this is in the complaint, the facts that are supposed\nto be alleged. As we said in the complaint, that the\nparties had given notice to EEOC of the overall system.\nIncidentally, there is another Respondent\nnamed Robertson, who did have a live charge and a right\nto sue letter which was running out, which is why we\nfiled this in May rather than in June or July.\nI also -- I think I said that EEOC did not,\nin fact, give notice to EEOC -- to FedEx until sometime\nafter August 20th, which was much more than 60 days from\nthe filing of the charge. So --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Rose, I'm having\ntrouble figuring out -- she not only filed this intake\nquestionnaire; she also filed a lengthy affidavit.\nMR. ROSE: Yes, sir.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where did all this\nstuff come from?\nMR. ROSE: She had friends who had filed\ncharges before. She had met with them. Much of this I\ncan --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Did these friends\nfile charges on intake questionnaires?\nMR. ROSE: They had all filled out intake\nquestionnaires. Many of them had filed charges\nthereafter.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: On Form 5.\nMR. ROSE: Yes. I mean, there's a whole --\nshe is from the same station -- she was from the same\nstation as Mr. Freeman, who filed a suit way back in\n1999 with a group of other people. So this language was\naround, and the couriers were friends, some of them at\nleast, and they discussed the matter with each other.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you know why she\nsigned the intake questionnaire on two different dates?\nMR. ROSE: Yes, Your Honor. Because I spoke\nto her in January, and I believe it was -- this is not\non the record, but it's compatible with my allegations\nin the complaint. This is not on the record, but she --\nI -- I never had seen her in person, and I spoke to her,\nand she said she had been to EEOC, and she filed it.\nAnd then I called her in January and said --\nlate January, I think -- did EEOC give you a number? I\ndidn't know the difference then between a complaint --\nbetween a Form 5 and a Form 283.\nIt was not something -- I had been\npracticing mostly Title VII work, but I had had some age\ncases before then. And I didn't know the difference in\nthe forms.\nAnd I had a form on my computer that I had\npeople fill out which says \"charge,\" but -- so she -- I\nsaid they must have lost it. Why don't you go down\nand -- she said, well, I'll file it again. I said fine.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You were\nrepresenting her at that point?\nMR. ROSE: By February, I -- I don't think\nwe had the retainer, but I had talked to her, and I --\nand she signed the retainer either in late January or\nearly February.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why do you think -- why do\nyou think they must have lost it? Why did you think\nthey must have lost it: Because she hadn't been given a\nnumber?\nMR. ROSE: Yes. Because it hadn't been\ndocketed. It's like a clerk. They -- you -- it's\nsimilar to what the courts -- the courts do. They get a\nnew thing, and they docket it. The problem with EEOC\nis, when they get a new thing that's not a Form 5, they\ndon't docket it. This didn't get docketed.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Even if they treat it as a\ncharge, they don't docket it?\nMR. ROSE: I don't know when they docketed\nthe form, the Form 5, that she filed. But the timing\nsuggests they did not docket it until August, sometime\nafter August.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I really think the problem\nhere is the EEOC, rather than anybody else.\nMR. ROSE: I think that's exactly right,\nYour Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It does, indeed, have this\nform which says -- which says that its purpose --\ninformation provided on this form will be used by\nCommission employees to determine the existence of the\nfacts relevant to a decision as to whether the\nCommission has jurisdiction and to provide such\nprecharge filing counseling, blah, blah, blah.\nAll of that, however, is contained as part\nof the Privacy Act statement.\nMR. ROSE: Exactly.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And if the filer is not\ninterested in keeping any of it confidential, I wouldn't\neven read the Privacy Act.\nMR. ROSE: Well, she probably didn't, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, what kind of an\nagency is this?\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose they made a mistake\nhere.\nMR. ROSE: I'm sorry, Your Honor?\nJUSTICE BREYER: What I think Miss Lensing,\none of her more basic points is this: There is a\nstatute. And the statute says the EEOC shall send\nprompt notice in part to the conciliation. And she\nadds, if we get the notice, we also start getting\nevidence and preserving it and talking to people. There\nare a lot of things they would like to do with that\nnotice.\nMR. ROSE: Sure.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, I replied to that,\nwell, okay, they complain about the lack of notice. But\nher response is, sure, they sometimes don't give notice\nwhen they file a charge. That's just a mistake. But if\nyou start calling these documents charges, well, they\nnever give notice, so they will never do it. It will be\na big problem, so, therefore, don't call them charges.\nNow, I want to know what your answer is to\nthe first part of what I said. My -- I was assuming\nthat if the employer is really hurt, there is a statute\nand a rule and the statute and the rules say you have to\ngive notice and if they are hurt by that, they can\ncomplain about it.\nMR. ROSE: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But they must make mistakes\nin their history when they file charges and didn't give\nnotice. So what does the law tell us? If you found it\nany case ever where the EEOC didn't give the notice, now\nthe complainant files a lawsuit and it's not the\ncomplainant's fault, her response is work out some kind\nof equitable tolling. But there must be law on this,\nbecause this couldn't -- this is a big agency and they\nmust have sometimes in the past forgotten to give\nnotice.\nMR. ROSE: Oh, it's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What does the law say\nhappens when they don't give notice?\nMR. ROSE: I think the law says that it\ncould be a defense but it's an affirmative defense and\nit's not --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, it wouldn't be a\ndefense. I mean, it's not this complainant's fault.\nIt's the --\nMR. ROSE: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You'd have to work out some\nkind of equitable tolling or something. I think she's\nright about that. There is no law to your knowledge or\nwhat is there?\nMR. ROSE: Well, I'd say the law is, Your\nHonor, what the regulation says. The regulation was\nadopted in 1983 after notice published in the 1981\nregulation says that any document that has, identifies\nthe employer, essentially respondent, and identifies the\nnature, general nature of the charge and is signed is a\ndocument. By the way?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where does that appear?\nWhere does that appear?\nMR. ROSE: It's in all the, it's in the\njoint appendix, Your Honor. It's toward the end of the\njoint appendix.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 351?\nMR. ROSE: That sounds right. Yes. It's\n351 if you look on the 351, three, it says in the middle\nthere, in the middle of that dense paragraph, it says\nthat most clearly in six which is on 351.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In its very definition of a\n\"charge,\" it says a charge shall be in writing and shall\nname the prospective respondent and shall generally --\nshall generally allege the discriminatory acts. That's\nwhat it must contain.\nMR. ROSE: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't say that\nanything that contains that is a charge.\nMR. ROSE: Oh, I think it does.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I could write out something\nthat contains all three of those things. Would that be\na charge?\nMR. ROSE: Well, let me -- let me refer you\nto the next page, then, Your Honor, which is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: All right. Let's try\nsomething else.\nMR. ROSE: -- which is (a) and (b).\n\"Notwithstanding the provisions of (a) of 8 above of\nthis section, a charge is sufficient when the Commission\nreceives from the person making the charge either a\nwritten statement or information reduced to writing by\nthe Commission that conforms to the requirements of\n1626,\" which I just read on page 351.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I like my cite\nbetter. If you look at 1626.3 on page 351, it says:\n'Charge' shall mean a statement filed with the\nCommission by, or on behalf of, an aggrieved person\nwhich alleges that the main prospective defendant has\nengaged in, or is about to engage in, actions in\nviolation\" --\nMR. ROSE: I like that one, too, Your Honor.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. ROSE: It's the same thing.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But if an employee files\nsomething like that and says I don't consent to\nnotification of the employer, can that be a charge?\nMR. ROSE: I think that it -- it really\ndepends whether the employee has put on top of it -- I\nthink you need -- I think there is a -- we take the\nposition that if it meets the definition of 1626.3, or\nthe other parts of 1626, it is a charge.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then, all intake\nquestionnaires are a charge, because they all contain\nthat. I mean that definition is simply inconsistent\nwith the -- with the agency's assertion that it has\nsomething called an intake questionnaire which does not\nconstitute a charge unless -- I don't know -- unless\nthere's manifest whatever it is.\nThat's inconsistent because all of those\nintake questionnaires contain all of that information --\nMR. ROSE: Well, I think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- set forth in 26.3.\nMR. ROSE: I think the last question was\nwhether if -- if she checked the other box, it would be;\nand I think that there is no consistency on what EEOC\nhas done in that situation.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, there may be none,\nbut if the -- if the employee indicates by the box\nchecked that the employee does not want the company to\nknow that the employee is making whatever this is, this\nstatement --\nMR. ROSE: Right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- how can it be regarded\nas a charge against the employer which sets in effect a\nlitigation process?\nMR. ROSE: Well, I think that's why the\nbetter reading probably, as Your Honor suggests, is that\nit's not a charge if that's all the form is, and she\nchecks only --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But you're okay because on\nthat criterion your -- your client said, yes, you can\ntell them?\nMR. ROSE: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Rose.\nMr. Heytens.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF TOBY J. HEYTENS\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES\nAS AMICUS CURIAE\nSUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. HEYTENS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Heytens, let me tell\nyou going in that my -- my main concern in this case,\nhowever the decision comes out, is to do something that\nwill require the EEOC to get its act in order, because\nthis is nonsense: These regulations that are\ncontradicted by forms; this failure to give notice, but\nit's okay because it's a charge anyway.\nThis whole situation can be traceable back\nto the agency, and I -- whoever ends up bearing the\nburden of it, it's the agency's fault, and this scheme\nhas to be revised.\nMR. HEYTENS: The agency absolutely agrees\nwith that, Your Honor, and the agency has taken a number\nof concrete steps, some of which we illustrate in our\nbrief, to deal with what in reality is a very serious\nproblem.\nI think it is important to point out,\ntherefore, right at the start, that the problems that\narose in this case are in some measure -- not\nexclusively but in some measure -- a reflection of when\nit arose.\nMs. Kennedy submitted her form in December\nof 2001. That was before the Edelman litigation; and,\nmost importantly, it was before the February 21st, 2002,\nmemo that was issued in response to the Edelman\nlitigation.\nNow, some members of the Court may recall\nthat one of the problems that surfaced at the time of\nEdelman was that the agency, or at least some of the\nfield offices of the agency, had a practice of not\nserving notice until after they received a verified Form\n5. And the February 21st memo was to say that needs to\nstop right now because our statutory obligations require\nus to serve notice within 10 days of the charge.\nSo that happened immediately following the\nEdelman litigation, which was, regrettably, after this\ncase arose.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me.\nMR. HEYTENS: Sure.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's within 10 days of\nthe charge, but that assumes, it seems to me, what's to\nbe proven. I mean what is the charge?\nMR. HEYTENS: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If -- if the prefiling, the\nintake thing, is not a charge, there is no problem.\nMR. HEYTENS: That's correct, as well,\nJustice Scalia, and it's important that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can you not make that not a\ncharge by saying in bold letters on the top: This is\nnot a charge. If you want a charge, ask for Form 5?\nMR. HEYTENS: Two responses to that, Justice\nScalia:\nFirst of all I think it's important to\nunderstand that, from our perspective, the test is an\nobjective intent test that looks to the intent of the\nemployee, not the intent of the EEOC in promulgating a\nform.\nAnd the reason that's important --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why do the courts have to\nstruggle with this when the agency could put in bold\nletters at the top: This is a charge or this is not a\ncharge?\nWhy do Federal district judges have to\ninquire into manifest intent from now until doomsday?\nMR. HEYTENS: The fundamental source of the\nproblem, Justice Scalia, is, as this Court has\nrecognized, the vast majority of people who initiate\nEEOC proceedings are lay people who aren't familiar with\nthe statute.\nAnd the other dilemma is that a great many\nof the initial contacts with the EEOC -- the EEOC, as we\nset forth in our brief, got 176,000 initial contacts in\nfiscal year 2006. Of those, 32,000 of them came in by\nmail -- mail from lay people who have no --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And the practical problem:\nI want to know where do I read what the definition of a\n\"charge\" is in the EEOC rules. The three criteria that\nit has certain information in it can't be the rule. It\ncan't be the rule because we already know that it isn't\na charge if the person says I don't want it to become\npublic.\nSo, where do I read the rule that you just\nsaid? That it -- an intake questionnaire that satisfies\nthese three conditions becomes a charge if it reflects\nthe manifest intent of the person who files it that it\nbe a charge.\nYou said that. That's a pretty modestly\nclear rule, except it isn't totally. And they qualify\n-- where do I read that?\nMR. HEYTENS: Certainly, Justice Breyer.\nThe definition of \"charge\" is the one the Chief Justice\ncited. It is in 1626.3 of the regulations, and that's\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: We use the word there\n\"manifest intent\"?\nMR. HEYTENS: The word \"manifest intent\" is\nnot set forth expressly there.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Ah. Well, I read those\nregs, and those regs had a definition that can't\npossibly be right as applied to \"intake questionnaire,\"\nbecause they make it a charge when the person says I\ndon't want notice. So we know that isn't the thing.\nI also know what you just said does sound\nlike a rule. I just want to know where to read it,\nbecause I don't think you'd refer to a rule of an\nagency, though normally we do -- but you don't refer to\na rule that doesn't exist; you don't refer to a rule\nthat nowhere can be found; you don't refer to a rule\nthat is internally inconsistent. So, before I defer, I\nwould just like to know where the clear rule that you\nstated can be found.\nMR. HEYTENS: Just as a point of\nclarification, Justice Breyer, the three requirements\nthat I believe you just referred to are in 1626.6, which\nis the provision of the regulations labeled \"Form of\nCharges.\"\nWe are saying that it's in construction of\n1626.3, the definition of \"charge.\" Now, I concede that\nthe --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, I just want to read it\nsomewhere.\nMR. HEYTENS: Sure.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So that if I were not here\nhaving you in front of me, as many people don't have you\nin front of them, where I would go to read just what you\nsaid.\nMR. HEYTENS: Four places, Justice Breyer:\nFirst of all, you could go to the final rule\nas it was promulgated in 1983. There was an issue that\ncame up when the agency promulgated the final rule that\nthe definition of \"charge\" versus the definition of\n\"complaint,\" both of which are defined terms in 1626.3,\nwas ambiguous and unclear.\nAnd in the final rule at Volume 48 of the\nFederal Register, page 138, the EEOC stated that one of\nthe distinctions between a charge and a complaint is\nthat a complaint is a way for the EEOC to receive\ninformation about allegations of discrimination where\n\"the party providing the information does not wish to\nfile a charge.\"\nThat was in the final --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is a complaint different\nfrom an intake questionnaire?\nMR. HEYTENS: In our view, yes, Justice\nGinsburg. The complaint would include, in a typical\ncase, an intake questionnaire, but a complaint is\nbroader. A complaint refers under the regulations to\nany way that the EEOC receives information about\ndiscrimination.\nThe reason that's contained in the Age Act\nregulations is because, unlike Title VII, the EEOC\ndoesn't need a formal charge in order to initiate its\nown proceedings.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why should we defer\nto an agency regulation when people in the agency hardly\never follow it?\nMR. HEYTENS: Mr. Chief Justice, I think\nit's not fair to say that people in the agency very\nrarely follow it. We would agree that in certain --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you didn't --\nin this case you didn't treat it as a charge, because\nyou didn't give notice.\nMR. HEYTENS: It's true that in this case\nthe document was not docketed as a charge, and that's\ntrue; we know that. The problem is, because it arose\nbefore Edelman and because it arose before the February\n21st, 2002, memo, we simply don't know why it wasn't\ntreated as a charge.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But you said there were\ngoing to be four places. I want to write them down.\nMR. HEYTENS: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: One is 48 Fed. Reg. 148?\nMR. HEYTENS: 48 Federal Register 138,\nJustice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: 138. Now, the other three.\nMR. HEYTENS: Yes, Justice Breyer.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where is that in CFR?\nMR. HEYTENS: It is not codified in the CFR.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, okay.\nMR. HEYTENS: The second place it is in\nsection 2.2 (b) of the compliance manual. That language\nhas been contained since at least 1988, if not sooner,\nand it's quoted on page 16 of our brief. The third\nplace you would look is the February 21st, 2002 memo\nwhich is on the EEOC's Web site. And it's also in the\nappendix to our brief, which directs use of the\ncompliance manual; and it's also the August 13th, 2007\nmemo, which is also attached to our brief, and what is\nalso contained on the agency's Web site. So this is not\nsomething --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do we give Chevron\ndeference to things like your internal compliance manual\nand these other memos?\nMR. HEYTENS: We certainly do not assert,\nMr. Chief Justice, that the compliance manual gets\nChevron deference. In our view, the compliance manual\nrepresents the agency's considered judgment about the\nproper interpretation of its regulations, and is thus\nentitled to deference under Auer. The Petitioners don't\nallege that our regulations don't get Chevron deference.\nThe EEOC has clearly been given the authority to issue\nregulations dealing with this topic.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Under the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Heytens, is it true\nthat the Form 5 for somebody who's not represented by\ncounsel is usually done by EEOC itself? Is it that\ntrue?\nMR. HEYTENS: In situations where the Form 5\nis filled out in the office, Justice Ginsburg, yes,\nthat's correct. Sometimes people mail in modified Form\n5, but official issues where it's done during the office\nvisit, my understanding is that the typical practice\nit's filled out by the EEOC office.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Heytens, what's your\nsolution for the situation where the EEOC treats it as a\ncharge, but doesn't give notice, which is what has\nhappened here? How do you think that should play out?\nMR. HEYTENS: In situations where the\nemployer does not receive notice, Justice Scalia?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's right.\nMR. HEYTENS: The first thing we think -- at\nthat point, Justice Scalia, I think that task is to try\nto recreate as well as possible the situation that\nshould have existed, and the Commission agrees notice\nshould have been given. So the first thing, as we say\nin our brief, the employer should be entitled to a stay\nof the litigation for up to 60 days to attempt to intent\nto work out, absent discovery requests, absent motions\npractices -- the problem -- Justice Scalia, you raised\nthe problem that at that point, the person probably has\na lawyer and you can't talk to him, but there's really\n-- but I think that's conceptually a separate question,\nfor two reasons. First, they might have had a lawyer\nwhen they filed the charge, in which case the same\nproblem you discussed would arise; but the flip side is\nit they could also be pro se after they filed a lawsuit,\nin which case the ex parte bar wouldn't count either.\nSo I think it's conceptually, although I can see it's\nprobably related in practice, it's at least conceptually\ndifferent.\nThe second thing we think, and it's been\nexplored during the oral arguments so far, if the\nemployer could allege or show some concrete prejudice as\na result of not having received notice, then the\ndistrict court should take that into account. But in\nthis case Federal Express has simply not alleged any\nconcrete prejudice.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's on the notice\npoint. Going back to the other, more important point,\nyour words that I found quite useful are the \"manifest\nintent,\" that shows a manifest -- are those words going\nto be in these four sources that I look up?\nMR. HEYTENS: The precise words manifest?\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. I suspect not.\nMR. HEYTENS: Well, then --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Therefore -- I'm --\nMR. HEYTENS: Well, but I would say, Justice\nBreyer, the word intend is in fact in the 1983 final\nrule; it says where the person \"does not intend to file\"\n--I apologize, Justice Breyer. As I stand here, the\nword is \"wish,\" \"does not wish to file a charge.\"\nThe language in the compliance manual which\nis repeated in the memorandum is well, is it states that\nyou look at whether the submission constitutes a clear\nrequest for the agency to act, which we think, though\nnot exactly the words manifest --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Just to get one thing\nperfectly clear in my mind, does that mean if the intake\nquestionnaire is checked not consent, that would not be\na charge?\nMR. HEYTENS: Mr. Chief Justice, may I ask\n-- in our view that if she had checked the box saying do\nnot disclose for identity, this would not have been a\ncharge. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Heytens.\nMiss Lensing, you have a minute left.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CONNIE L. LENSING,\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. LENSING: First of all, in this case the\naffidavit attached to the intake questionnaire began --\nand this is at Joint Appendix 266 -- with the statement,\n\"I have been assured of confidentiality by the EEOC.\"\nSo it is a confidentiality concern.\nCongress determined that there must be an\nopportunity for conciliation before a lawsuit was filed.\nWe never saw the numbers that are not in the record,\nthat were testified to today, but if 247 charges were\nfiled against FedEx, in that period of time we had 25\nage discrimination cases. So conciliation before a case\ndoes work. And I appreciate those numbers because it --\nit just shows that we conciliate, we look into it, but\nyou can't do it once the lawsuit is filed.\nThe best rule obviously are the clear forms\nthat many of you have mentioned today. One can say it's\nnot a charge. The other one can say it is a charge, and\nthis could all be a situation where you'd have only rare\noccurrences where notice was not given.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How do we fix it? You\nhaven't gotten notice, you haven't had a chance to\nconciliate -- how do we fix it?\nMS. LENSING: Well, this particular case,\nshe could -- may I answer?\nShe could have filed her lawsuit, she had a\ncharge. She chose not to file a subsequent lawsuit 60\ndays later. This lawsuit was properly dismissed. The\nopportunity to file another lawsuit was there. She\ndidn't need equitable tolling because she caught it and\nshe filed a charge, indisputable, and we did get notice\nof the charge in July. I think it was filed the very\nend of May; we got it in July.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMiss Lensing.\n"
