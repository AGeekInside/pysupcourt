        "content": "(10:52 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in Case 06-1509, Boulware v. United States.\nMr. Cline.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN D. CLINE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. CLINE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nCongress placed the phrase \"with respect to\nits stock\" in Section 301(a) of the Internal Revenue\nCode to make clear that the taxation rules in Section\n301(c) do not apply to corporate payments that a\nshareholder receives in a nonshareholder capacity.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: May I ask you a question\nwhich is going to come up sooner or later? And it's\nkind of a threshold question. So, if I may, let me\ninterrupt you with it now. You emphasize the\nsignificance of the limiting condition \"with respect to\nthe stock.\" But before you get to that phrase, Section\n301 refers to a distribution by the corporation. And my\nquestion is this: Let's assume that we -- we accept\nyour -- your position that the circuit was wrong in\nrequiring an offer of proof of intent to return capital.\nIsn't it also the case that you would still have an\nobligation, if you're going to take advantage of this\nsection, to offer some evidence with respect to the fact\nthat there was a corporate distribution involved? And\nas I understand it, your evidence is or the Government's\nevidence and yours is that, you know, there was\nskimming, there was misdirection, et cetera, but there\nwas no indication, there's no evidence that there was\nany distribution, in the normal sense of that word, by a\ncorporation.\nSo it seems to me that if you -- if you win\nthe case in the sense of convincing us that the circuit\nwas wrong with respect to the specific intent\nrequirement, you would still be left without a defense\nbecause you have not come forward with any evidence that\nindicates a distribution. Am I wrong?\nMR. CLINE: Yes, Your Honor, I believe you\nare.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I thought you were going to\nsay that.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. CLINE: Although I agree that the\nquestion of a distribution is important, and I think\nimplicit in that question, in that term, although the\ncourts have not addressed it, is some sort of corporate\naction. Where you have a controlling shareholder, as we\ndo here with Mr. Boulware, who is a 50 percent share\nowner, he's the president, he's the founder, he\ndominates this company, his action is action on behalf\nof the corporation.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it certainly can be,\nand there's no question about that, but isn't there some\npoint of informality or some point, I guess, of\nformality or relevance to corporate practice that has to\nbe reached? In other words, he may keep lousy books, he\nmay be very sloppy, but directing funds to one's\ngirlfriend is not the act of a corporation. And it\nseems to me that the kind of -- of actions that he took\nto get or to direct the payment of moneys could not, by\nany stretch of the imagination, be regarded as an act of\nthis corporation or of any corporation.\nMR. CLINE: With respect, Justice Souter,\nJustice Souter, I disagree. There are, I've discovered,\nhundreds of corporate diversion cases involving a very\nsimilar fact pattern and a very similar fact pattern to\nthis, where have you a corporation that is really the\ncreature of one person. It's formed by one person. He\nchose the corporate form, but in effect he is the\ncorporation. That's the case of Mr. Boulware and it's\nthe case in a lot of these diversion cases, and --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, in this case, he's a\n50 percent owner, as I understand it. He formed the\ncorporation, but isn't 50 percent of the stock owned by\nthe trust for the love child of him and the girlfriend?\nMR. CLINE: It is indeed, although it's\nimportant to keep in mind that the girlfriend, according\nto the Government's evidence, received a very large\nchunk of this money. So in effect what we have here is\na situation where you not only have a 50 percent\nshareholder who dominates the corporation; the other 50\npercent -- the trustee for the other 50 percent\nshareholder is the recipient of the money and is\ncertainly knowledgeable about most, if not all, of\nwhat's going on.\nBut in these circumstances where you have a\nclose corporation typically run very informally, as this\none was, with one person who dominates it, the courts\nhave uniformly taken the view that, the Tax Court has\nand for that matter the Government has in every case\nexcept this one, that when the controlling dominant\nshareholder takes money from his corporation, that's a\ndistribution by the corporation. And although -- Your\nHonor, I had thought about this question myself before\nyou raised it. The cases don't pause on that issue.\nThey move directly to the question of whether it's taken\nin some other capacity, as compensation, for example, or\nas a loan.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, perhaps because --\nbecause the Government might very well be on the other\nside of that question, that is the dominant shareholder\ntakes money from the corporation, gives it to his\ngirlfriend, and the Government is saying that\ncorporation had earnings and profits, we want to tax\nthis as a dividend to you.\nMR. CLINE: Well, yes, Justice Ginsburg.\nThe way this often comes up, the Government usually\ntakes the opposite position --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.\nMR. CLINE: -- to what it's taken here. It\nusually takes our position, and here's the reason why:\nFirst of all, a lot of times, as in this case, some of\nthe money that is coming toward the corporation is\nintercepted by the controlling shareholder. And the\nquestion then is, was it ever income to the corporation?\nWell, of course, the Government wants to say that it was\nbecause they want to tax it twice, at the corporate\nlevel and then again at the individual level. And the\nissue there again is one of control. If it's the\ncontrolling shareholder, even though he gets the money\nbefore it ever hits the corporate bank account. It's\nconsidered income to the corporation.\nIt also comes up when the corporation wants\nto claim a theft deduction or embezzlement deduction.\nThat again is a common fact pattern in these cases. The\ncorporation -- everything comes to light, the IRS\nconducts its investigation, now the corporation wants to\navoid its tax. Sure the individual is going to get\ntaxed, but it wants to avoid its tax. And so, it claims\nthat there was a theft or an embezzlement by the\nshareholder and it's entitled to a deduction and\nshouldn't have to pay tax on that money.\nAnd again, the Government uniformly takes\nthe position that a controlling shareholder, such as\nMr. Boulware, can't embezzle from his own corporation,\nwhich is essentially the position that we're taking\nhere.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it may be that he\ncannot embezzle in the sense of committing a separate\nprivate act or even a separate, a separate tort that the\ncorporation could object to. But the question still\nremains -- excuse me -- whether the act of, of taking\nthe money in this unorthodox way could be regarded as a\ncorporate act within the meaning of the term\n\"distribution.\" And I think I understand your point,\nbut I guess the only point that I'm making is the fact\nthat it may not qualify as embezzlement, civilly or\ncriminally, does not necessarily answer the objection\nthat I'm raising.\nMR. CLINE: I agree with that point, Justice\nSouter.\nBut one other point I would emphasize is\nthat I think if you start to say that an act by the\ncontrolling shareholder, which is Mr. Boulware, does not\nconstitute a distribution by his corporation, there are\ngoing to be unintended consequences of that. One of\nwhich is that in a situation where a controlling\nshareholder such as Mr. Boulware intercepts money coming\ninto the corporation, you're going to have the\ncorporation coming in and arguing that that\ninterception, that taking in of money wasn't an act of\nthe corporation, and so, there is no income to us. And\nI think that's why the courts in a whole series --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That explains why I'm\nmaking the argument and the Government wasn't in its\nbrief?\nMR. CLINE: I think it does.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you did say something\nabout the interception that -- your argument is that\nthis corporation had no earnings and profits, so what\nthe shareholder got was a return of capital. But part\nof what was involved was he was taking, I thought,\nreceipts for goods that customers were -- had paid and\ngiving them to the girlfriend.\nIn determining whether that corporation had\nany earnings and profits, wouldn't you have to credit\nthe corporation? In other words, did you prove that\nthere was no -- that there were no earnings and profits?\nYou would have to prove that, wouldn't you?\nMR. CLINE: The way I believe it would work\nwith a properly instructed jury in the district court is\nas follows: I think Mr. Boulware would have the burden\nof coming forward with some evidence that the\ncorporation did not have earnings or profits and that\nhis basis exceeded the amount of the diversion. I think\nat that point, if he comes forward with some evidence,\nand Bok talks about this, Leonard talks about this --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: For which purpose you'd\ninclude the receipts?\nMR. CLINE: I beg your pardon?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: For which purpose you would\ninclude the receipts that he sent to his girlfriend\ninstead of putting them in the corporate treasury?\nMR. CLINE: Your Honor, I believe that is\ncorrect, but I'm not certain. What I can tell you about\nearnings and profits and basis as well is this. It is a\nvery complicated calculation, and I think it would be\nhotly disputed in the district court. I would expect\nthe Government to argue that the company did have\nearnings and profits and that Mr. Boulware's basis is\nless than he contends it is. I think it would\nultimately be a question of fact for the jury.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I also wanted to know\nwhether there is in the record the corporation's balance\nsheet? It was frankly hard for me to believe that this\nwas not in excess of basis. You don't usually\ncapitalize corporations for $10 million. But I don't\nhave any basis other than just an assumption to make\nthat observation. Is the corporate balance sheet with\nthe capital structure in the record?\nMR. CLINE: I don't believe so, Your Honor.\nBut what is in the record, and it's also in the joint\nappendix, is the fairly sketchy evidence of both basis\nand earnings and profits that was introduced. But there\nwas not a full presentation of those issues.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Was it introduced by the\nGovernment or by the defendant?\nMR. CLINE: It came in -- I must say it came\nin more or less by happenstance, because neither party\nwas really looking at the question of earnings and\nprofits or basis because the trial court had ruled those\nout. But, for example, on cross-examination I believe\nof Mr. Boulware's accountant -- this is at page 42 of\nthe joint appendix -- Mr. Boulware's lawyer elicited\nthat the corporation had not had earnings and profits\nduring the years in question. That was not explored at\nall. But there is that statement in the record.\nThere is also -- I'm sorry, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm not, I'm not sure if\nwhat the Government is maintaining here is so\nprejudicial to its position in other cases, which was\nthe earlier discussion we were having. Here there is\nsimply nothing on the corporate records to show that\nthis was a distribution with respect to stock. I don't\ncare whether this is earnings and profits or in excess\nof basis. But there's just no indication of the\ndistribution with respect to stock, and you have two\nshareholders. Under Hawaiian law, can you make a\ndisproportionate distribution to shareholders so one\nperson gets capital back and the other doesn't and\nthere's no redemption of shares?\nMR. CLINE: I think it is entirely possible\nthat under Hawaiian law a minority shareholder or\nnoncontrolling shareholder who was treated unfairly by\nthe controlling shareholder might have a cause of action\nunder State law. But I --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That was, that was the\nqualification that the Second Circuit made in its\nD'Agostino case. It said if there's a violation of\ncorporate law then our rule doesn't apply.\nMR. CLINE: Well, except, Your Honor, that\nthe way these cases have played out is that there are\nnumerous cases, dozens of them, where there are minority\nshareholders oftentimes unwitting of what the majority\nshareholder is using. Those minority shareholders\ncertainly have rights. They can sue under State law.\nThey can do any number of things.\nBut their rights and the possible violation\nof their rights -- and I emphasize possible, because no\none has ever established that Mr. Boulware did anything\nwrong with respect to anyone -- those don't drive the\nFederal tax treatment.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but that's the whole\npoint. The fact that he doesn't show this as a\ndistribution indicates that he couldn't do this under\nFederal law, so it must be something -- under State law,\nso it must be something other than a distribution.\nMR. CLINE: I think, Your Honor, that where\nthe controlling shareholder of the corporation does\nsomething with corporate funds, and in this case\ntransfers them to himself, I think that's a\ndistribution. And I think that it is properly treated\nunder Federal law, under Federal tax law, for purposes\nof Federal tax law as a distribution by the corporation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm less concerned with the\nword \"distribution\" in the statute than I am with the\nphrase \"with respect to its stock\" -- \"distribution made\nby a corporation to a shareholder with respect to its\nstock.\"\nNow, the court below held that there had to\nbe a conscious intent to return capital. Even if I\ndisagree with that and think that that was wrong, isn't\nthe Government right that it nonetheless is the burden\nto establish that the distribution here was a\ndistribution with respect to stock, and the distribution\nwas given to the girlfriend who owns no stock in the\ncorporation. How does it become a distribution with\nrespect to stock?\nMR. CLINE: Well, Your Honor, that gets back\nto where I -- to where I began the argument. The phrase\n\"with respect to stock\" has never received in any case\nor any argument, as far as I know, the significance that\nthe Government is trying to accord it here. What that\nphrase -- it was put in the 1954 Code. And the purpose\nof putting it in the code was simply to distinguish\ntransfers to shareholders in a capacity where the\nshareholder is effectively returning consideration --\nshareholder employees, shareholder vendors, shareholder\ncreditors --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Or girlfriends. I mean,\nwhy doesn't it distinguish a girlfriend as much as it\ndistinguishes an employee who's receiving back a loan?\nMR. CLINE: Because the issue, Your Honor,\nis not the recipient of the funds. I mean, the money is\ngoing to be taxed to Mr. Boulware if it's taxable\nregardless of where he diverted it. For example, there\nare again dozens of these cases where controlling\nshareholders divert corporate assets to their family\nmembers, and the issue is whether it's a constructive\ndividend to that corporate shareholder. Here the\nquestion, regardless of where Mr. Boulware --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And the Government would\nsay yes?\nMR. CLINE: Absolutely. The Government in\nevery case says yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, they're really --\nthey're really between a rock and a hard place on this\nstuff.\nMR. CLINE: Well, because, Your Honor, they\nwant -- they want the controlling shareholder, the\nperson in Mr. Boulware's situation, to pay tax. And, of\ncourse in most cases -- in most cases, again, it's to\nthe Government's advantage to argue the position that\nwe're arguing here. And the reason is most corporations\nhave earnings and profits. Most shareholders don't have\nenough basis to cover their tax until the Government\nwants to hit it at both levels, it wants the corporate\ntax and it wants the individual tax. And so, it argues\nreadily that this is a distribution with respect to\nstock.\nThat phrase was -- was put in the 1954 Code\nto distinguish one capacity from another. The\nGovernment has argued that it should receive some sort\nof a causal type meaning. There should be a causal\nlink, that Mr. Boulware should have to establish that he\nreceived the stock because he was a shareholder.\nIf that's the standard, first of all, it's a\ndifferent standard than what the district court and the\nNinth Circuit required Mr. Boulware to meet. So he\nought to have a chance to satisfy the standard.\nSecond, that standard doesn't necessarily\nrequire any form of intent. There's nothing in the\nphrase \"with respect to stock\" that talks about intent.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We don't -- and this\nmay be the point that you just made, but I want to\nclarify it. We don't have to decide whether this\ndiversion was with respect to stock, because you put\nthat at issue, and you weren't allowed to make that --\nMR. CLINE: Absolutely, Your Honor. What --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose it would\nbe open on remand for the Government to argue it was not\nwith respect to stock for the reasons that have come\nout, that it was just a diversion?\nMR. CLINE: The Government could argue that,\nbut, Mr. Chief Justice, I have to say I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You are pretty sure they\nwon't.\nMR. CLINE: I would be astounded if they\ntook that position, because it would be so contrary to\nthe position they take in every other case.\nBut to get back to your basic point, yes,\nMr. Boulware was asked to meet a standard that no one\ndefends in this Court. The Government isn't here\ndefending the intent to have a return of capital\nstandard. And part of the reason they don't defend it\nis it's an impossible concept. You don't know if you\nhave a return of capital until you know if you have a\ndividend. And you don't know that until -- until the\nend of the tax year.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the -- the\nGovernment did say that this accountant -- what was his\nname, Monango, or something like that?\nMR. CLINE: Monago, yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Testified at the trial\nthat there was no return of capital in the relevant\nyear.\nMR. CLINE: What Mr. Monago testified to was\nthat there weren't any payments out of the capital\naccount, and that's undisputed. But that's not the\nquestion.\nThose sorts of corporate formalities are not\ndeterminative, or even particularly helpful, in these\nconstructive dividend types of cases.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, under the\nGovernment's intent test, I suppose if you have a\ncalendar year and the distribution is made in June, that\nthe Government could say: What we want to show -- we\nwant you to show that there was an intent to make a\ndistribution with respect to stock at that time.\nWhether or not it was a dividend, whether or\nnot it was a return of capital, we won't know until the\nend of the year. I suppose they could try to argue\nthat.\nMR. CLINE: That is what they're arguing.\nNow, two things about that Justice Kennedy:\nFirst, that's not the standard Mr. Boulware\nwas required to meet in the district court. The\nstandard there was intent that it be a return of\ncapital. And that's a different thing than an intent\nthat it be with respect to stock.\nAn intent that it be a return of capital\nsuggests that you know what a return of capital is. You\nknow about earnings and profits. You know about basis.\nAnd I can tell you that Mr. Boulware, who was an\nunsophisticated man, didn't know any of those things at\nthe time; and so, of course, he couldn't meet the\nstandard he was required to meet. If this Court were to\nagree with the Government that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You mean to say the\nGovernment can't argue that this -- the Defendant has to\nshow that it was a distribution with respect to stock\nand that that was his intent. Whether or not it was a\ndividend, whether or not it was a return of capital, we\nwait.\nMR. CLINE: I don't think that's the right\nstandard, but even if this Court decides that it is,\nthat's not the standard Mr. Boulware was required to\nmeet in the trial court. He was required to show an\nintent that it be a return of capital, and he couldn't\nmeet that standard.\nIf this Court were to decide -- and I\nsuggest it would be the wrong standard, but if this\ncourt were to decide that the correct standard were an\nintent that it be with respect to stock, Mr. Boulware\ncould meet that standard.\nHe was never given the opportunity to meet\nit before, but he could meet that if this Court were to\ndecide that that was the standard in the sense that he\ncould certainly show that, to the extent he got this\nmoney personally, he got it because he was a\nstockholder. And he knew he was getting it because he\nwas a stockholder.\nBut he never had a chance to meet the\nstandard, because it wasn't the standard that the\nGovernment urged in the trial court or even before the\npanel on appeal.\nUnless the Court has further questions, I'd\nlike to reserve the remainder of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Cline.\nMs. Maynard.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DEANNE E. MAYNARD\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. MAYNARD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn the Government's view, to make a\nsufficient proffer of a return of capital defense a\nDefendant must point to some factual evidence to support\nthree elements:\nFirst, that there was a distribution with\nrespect to stock. Second, that the corporation lacked\nearnings and profits during the relevant tax years.\nAnd, third, that the Defendant had a sufficient basis in\nhis stock to cover the funds received.\nThe question before this Court relates to\nthe first element.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The court below didn't give\nhim a chance --\nMS. MAYNARD: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- to establish that. The\ncourt below required him to show an intent to distribute\ncapital.\nMS. MAYNARD: And the Government here\nbelieves that the correct test is the rule of the Ninth\nCircuit, Your Honor. The Government believes that\nbefore a defendant may present a return of capital\ndefense to the jury, there must be some evidence that\nthe corporation intended, as objectively inferred from\nall the facts and circumstances, to make a distribution\nwith respect to its stock at the time the funds were\ntaken.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But if it turned out that\nthere were earnings and profits and everything else was\nthe same, would the Government be taking the position\nthat the proper test is: Was this a distribution with\nrespect to stock?\nMS. MAYNARD: In -- in every case, Your\nHonor, the question about whether or not the Section 301\ntax treatment applies, the Government believes that\nturns on all the facts and circumstances and that there\nmust be some facts and circumstances suggesting that it\nwas a distribution with respect to stock.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose the government --\nthe corporation is rich with earnings and profits.\nWould the Government be saying: Oh, aha. So we have to\ngo through the motions of first seeing was this a\ndistribution with respect to stock?\nI thought that the idea of was it \"a\ndistribution with respect to stock\" refers to was it --\nwas the corporation -- was there to be any quid pro quo?\nThat is, the shareholder gets money from the\ncorporation. Is the shareholder expected to pay it\nback, or is it just that it comes out of the corporation\ninto the shareholder's pocket with no expectation by the\ncorporation to get it back?\nI thought that that's what \"with respect to\nstock\" means instead of \"with respect to salary,\" \"with\nrespect to a loan.\" That's what I thought was the\nunderstanding of the term. Am I wrong about it?\nMS. MAYNARD: That is half of the\nunderstanding of the term. I do think it is, as\nPetitioner says, a term of art. There are two parts to\nthe term of art with respect to stock, Your Honor.\nIt is, as you say, funds that you receive\nwithout consideration. But it is also funds that you\nreceive solely because of your status as a shareholder.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that was -- we're just\nnot on the same page here. That's not what the -- the\ndecision you're defending said.\nThe decision you're defending did not say\nthat it was incumbent on the defendant to show that it\nwas with respect to stock. They said it was incumbent\non the defendant to show that it was intended to be a\nreturn of capital.\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, that's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that's just a wholly\ndifferent issue, and it seems to me the best you can get\nout of this case, the way you're arguing it, is a remand\nfor them to apply the proper test.\nMS. MAYNARD: I think the test that I'm\narticulating is the Ninth Circuit's test in this\ncircumstance, Your Honor. In Miller, which is the\ngenesis of the Ninth Circuit's test, the court said --\nand this is on page 545 at 1214 -- \"We, therefore,\nconclude that whether diverted funds constitute\nconstructive corporate distributions\" -- and that would\ninclude dividends, return of capital, or capital gain --\n\"depends on the factual circumstances involved in each\ncase under consideration.\"\nAnd then it went on to say, before a\ndefendant could proffer a defense of return of capital,\nthe taxpayer had to make some demonstration that this --\nsuch distributions were intended to be such a return of\ncapital --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, it depends on what\nyou mean by that. The Ninth Circuit said, quote, about\nwhat he has to show, that he has to show not merely that\nthe funds could have been a return of capital, but that\nthe funds were, in fact, the return of capital \"at the\ntime of transfer.\"\nThen, they go on to say, since there was no\nevidence that they were considered, intended or recorded\non the corporate records as a return of capital at the\ntime they were made, then it isn't a return of capital.\nNow, I thought everybody thinks that's\nwrong, because you might have an absolute distribution\nthat absolutely counts as a distribution to every\nshareholder in the corporation. And at the time they\nall think the company's going to make a billion dollars,\nbut it just turns out that they have a loss of a billion\ndollars, in which case at the end of the tax year that\nwould count as a return of capital if the basis were\nhigh enough, and it would not count as a dividend. Am I\nwrong?\nMS. MAYNARD: No. You may not know at the\ntime the funds are paid whether or not that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right, fine. So if we\ndo not know, that's the end of the Ninth Circuit test,\nisn't it? Because the Ninth Circuit test says: What we\nwant to do is to look at the books at the time of the\ndistribution and see if it is entered on those books as\na return of capital. That's how I read it.\nMS. MAYNARD: If you -- if you -- it would\nbe more accurate to say: At the time, was it intended,\nas objectively manifested from all the facts and\ncircumstances, to be a distribution --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. No. It was not. What\nthey thought at the time they distributed it was\nfabulous dividends because we are going to be rich.\nMS. MAYNARD: But if --\nJUSTICE BREYER: My example was they just\nmade a little mistake. Instead, the corporation is\nclose to bankrupt, so there are no earnings or profits.\nIs it then a return of capital or not?\nMS. MAYNARD: It could be a return of\ncapital depending on the person's stock.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The basis? He has more\nthan enough basis. He has a $14 trillion basis, okay?\nSo there is no problem about that.\nMS. MAYNARD: But here he -- the defendant\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. And so it is a\nreturn of capital. So, therefore, the test is wrong.\nMS. MAYNARD: It would be a return -- but\nthe point, Your Honor, is that the test is whether or\nnot at the time the funds were taken, the corporation\nintended to be making a distribution with respect to its\nstock.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, aren't you -- aren't\nyou saying not that the -- that the test of intent that\nthe Ninth Circuit used is, in itself, a sufficient test;\nbut that, rather -- and correct me if I'm wrong, because\nI thought this was the basis really of your argument.\nI thought the Government, in effect, was\nsaying in order to treat it as a return of capital, it\nis a necessary condition that it be intended to be\ntreated as a return of capital.\nBut that is not a sufficient condition,\nbecause if, in fact, it turns out, as in Justice\nBreyer's example, that there are no earnings, then under\n301 it can't be treated as -- as a dividend. And only\nthen, under 301, would it be treated as a return of\ncapital.\nSo the conditions are, No. 1 necessary\nintent; No. 2, a determination at the end of the year\nthat, in fact, there were no earnings.\nConversely, if at the end of the year there\nare profits, even though the first necessary condition,\nintent, was satisfied, under 301 that would not be\nenough; and the Government would treat it as income.\nIsn't that the nub of your position?\nMS. MAYNARD: If it were with respect to\nstock and there were --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes. Yes.\nMS. MAYNARD: -- earning profits, and it was\nthen income --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I doubt that. Then --\nthen, you would say, when it is not a criminal\nprosecution for failure to pay taxes, so long as\nsomebody, when they take the money, intended it to be a\nreturn of dividends, it does not become a return of\ncapital. Are you sure you're willing to live with that\nintent requirement?\nMS. MAYNARD: If at the time the corporation\nmade a distribution, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: At the time -- is it\nimportant for the tax treatment that at the time of the\ndistribution it be intended to be either a return of\ncapital or dividends? Does that make the difference as\nto whether you're going to be able to tax it or not?\nMS. MAYNARD: It depends in all cases, in\nboth criminal and civil cases -- and in that sense the\nGovernment doesn't agree with the Ninth Circuit's\nreasoning -- in all cases whether or not something gets\nthe tax treatment set forth in 301(a) depends on whether\nor not it's a distribution with respect to stock.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I'm not -- we are not\ntalking about distribution.\nMS. MAYNARD: Okay, I'm sorry. I\nmisunderstood your question.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We are talking about the\nintent that it be a return of capital or not.\nMS. MAYNARD: If it -- - if the\nGovernment -- if it was intended at the time it was paid\nout to either be a dividend or return of capital or a\ncapital gain --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Either one.\nMS. MAYNARD: -- that would be enough to\nsatisfy the -- with respect to stock --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It could be anything at\nall. So in other words, there is no preliminary\nrequirement that you intend that it be a return of\ncapital. Right. So if the Court of Appeals said that\nhere, it was wrong.\nMS. MAYNARD: I think if the court chooses\nto read their test that rigidly, I don't believe that\nthe Petitioner understood it that way.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well I -- let me -- I just\nwant to get clear on how you understand it. I gave you\none alternative in which you defend the Ninth Circuit.\nJustice Scalia has given you another alternative in\nwhich you don't defend the Ninth Circuit. Which --\nwhich are you going to take?\nMS. MAYNARD: I must not understand. There\nare three elements. I want to make clear there is an\nadditional element, Your Honor, to the defense than the\ntwo you laid out.\nThat there would also -- the taxpayer must\nhave a sufficient basis in his stock to cover the amount\nof the diverted funds for it to be treated as a return\nof capital.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can I try a third example?\nBecause I think an example might help.\nLet us imagine that the company distributes\n$10,000 on June 1 to every shareholder.\nLet us imagine that every shareholder has a\nbasis of a trillion dollars in his stock. There is no\nproblem about basis. There is no problem about the\nnature of the distribution.\nLet us imagine they put in the corporate\nrecords on June 1: This is a very valuable corporation;\nwe are going to make a fortune; and this is a dividend.\nThey write it down.\nNow, unfortunately, four weeks later the\nbottom falls out of the market, and it is not a dividend\nfor the reason that they have no profits that year.\nNow, is it not under ordinary tax law a return of\ncapital?\nMS. MAYNARD: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay.\nMS. MAYNARD: If --\nJUSTICE BREYER: If that -- once you say\nyes, then the Ninth Circuit must be wrong because the\nNinth Circuit said we do not look to see what happens.\nMS. MAYNARD: If that's how --\nJUSTICE BREYER: A month later, we look just\nto see how it's characterized by the corporation at the\nmoment of the transfer.\nMS. MAYNARD: If one reads the Ninth\nCircuit's test that rigidly --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's what they\nsaid.\nMS. MAYNARD: -- perhaps that would be\nright. But I believe if one looks back to Miller, you\ncan see that the Ninth Circuit is talking about whether\nor not it was a constructive distribution.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but why talk about\nthat at all? I mean, on Justice Breyer's third and\nsimplest example, he is basically saying let Section 301\nmake the determination, in effect, at the end of the\nyear, when we know what the actual situation of the\ncorporation is. If you wait and see, 301 takes care of\nit, and you don't have to get into the -- sort of the\nmetaphysics of intent.\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, there is a threshold\nrequirement to 301 treatment, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes. Distribution with --\ndistribution with respect to stock.\nMS. MAYNARD: Right. And there --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And I think he was assuming\nand I'm assuming that -- that that condition is met.\nBut, in order to meet that condition, you don't have to\nhave a specific intent that the -- on the part of the\ncorporation that the distribution either be a return of\ncapital or that the distribution either be a dividend.\nIt simply has to be a distribution to this guy because\nhe is a stockholder.\nMS. MAYNARD: That's right, Your Honor. We\nagree with that.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMS. MAYNARD: If he had testified here that\nhe believed he was receiving a dividend at the time he\ntook these funds, we believe that would be sufficient to\nmeet the threshold requirement.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He wants a chance to argue\nthat. He was not given a chance to argue that.\nMS. MAYNARD: I believe you can tell from\nhis proffer, Your Honor, that he understood his test was\nto show that these were intended to be some sort of\nconstructive distributions.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Was there anything in the\ntax court at all that used the words as having any\nsignificance for this determination whether there was a\ntax evasion here with respect to this stock? Was there\nany -- any hint that those -- those words were\ncontrolling?\nMS. MAYNARD: In the Ninth Circuit?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In the tax court\noriginally. Was this a -- this was in the tax court?\nMS. MAYNARD: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: This is a criminal case.\nMS. MAYNARD: A criminal case, yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Okay. In the trial court\nfirst.\nMS. MAYNARD: In -- in -- the rule has been\nclear in the Ninth Circuit since 1976 that you had to\nmake a showing that there was an intent at the time the\nmoneys were paid to make a constructive distribution.\nSo, no, there was no need to go back to\nfirst principles and argue where in the statute that\nrule was grounded; but the Government has made this\nargument and made it in seeking an en banc prehearing in\nD'Agostino, in 1998.\nThis is not a new argument. When -- when\nthe issue was reopened and they sought en banc review,\nthe Government --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Can I can ask you sort of\nan elementary, stupid question? What is the\nGovernment's theory as to what this money was? Is it\nthe theory that it was a dividend or that it was salary?\nMS. MAYNARD: The Government's theory of the\ncase, Your Honor -- but I'd like to step back and\nexplain it after I tell you what it was. The\nGovernment's theory of the case was that this money was\nstolen from the corporation. But in a criminal case, in\norder to show tax a deficiency for purposes of tax\nevasion or --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So your theory, just to be\nsure I understand, it was not salary; it was not a\ndividend; it was the proceeds of an embezzlement?\nMS. MAYNARD: That was as we argued it to\nthe jury, Your Honor. But there is no need in -- for\nthe Government to characterize in a tax -- for the\npurposes of a criminal case, this Court's decision in\nHolland makes clear that in order to prove the tax\ndeficiency element of a tax evasion case, or here a\nfalse statement with respect to income for the false\nreturn counts, the Government need prove only two\nthings:\nOne, that the Defendant received a\nsubstantial amount of funds that he did not report on\nhis income taxes.\nAnd, two, that the funds came from a likely\nsource of taxable income.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It does not have to prove\nthat it was income.\nMS. MAYNARD: It has to prove that it came\nfrom a likely source of taxable income. I mean, to\nprove that here, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I just want to be sure I\nhave the right answer. You do not have to prove that it\nwas income?\nMS. MAYNARD: That is a proof -- that it's\nincome. We don't have to label what type of income it\nis.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It's income to him. You\nwould be taking a different position if you thought you\ncould attribute it to the corporation and tax the\ncorporation, too.\nMS. MAYNARD: The fact that it's -- it's\nincome to him. It may or may not be income to the\ncorporation. We also believe that it was income to the\ncorporation.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Right. And if you want to\ngo after the corporation, you are specifically going to\ntake the position in this guy's case that, in fact, it\nwas income to the corporation. If there is no income to\nthe corporation, then you don't care, and that's the\nsituation you're in here.\nMS. MAYNARD: It was income to the\ncorporation, Your Honor, even here.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But it was not profits; it\nwas not taxable income.\nMS. MAYNARD: Yes. It should have been\nincome to the corporation, and --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It was not taxable income.\nMS. MAYNARD: Yes, it should have been.\nYes, Your Honor, it should have been taxable income to\nthe corporation, income that was coming to the\ncorporation that he diverted before it hit the corporate\n-- just before it hit the corporation's books. In other\ninstances, he took money from the corporation and put it\nto his personal use.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Under your response to\nJustice Stevens, once you show that it was from a likely\nsource of income that he received it, it's unreported,\nthen it's the defendant's burden to go ahead and show\nthis was a 301 distribution, that I had a basis that\nabsorbed it, that there were no earnings and profits.\nThat's all for the defendant.\nMS. MAYNARD: The Government retains the\nultimate burden of proof at all times, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the court\ndidn't let the taxpayer submit evidence. He came\nforward and said: Look, there's an issue here despite\nthe return of capital. I would have thought at that\npoint the burden shifted to you again. That burden --\nhaving met that burden of production or at least tried\nto, the burden would shift to you to show, no, it's not\na return of capital, it's a dividend.\nMS. MAYNARD: Here he -- in order to make\nthe -- to make out a case, to be allowed to present a\ndefense to the jury, Your Honor, that the funds are\nnontaxable, the defense must have some basis in fact.\nAnd here he proffered nothing to show that this was a\ndividend or a return of capital at the time it was made.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He said in his\nproffer that he would present expert testimony that this\n-- the corporation didn't have profits and earnings, and\ntherefore it was a return of capital. And the district\ncourt said no, you don't get to do that.\nMS. MAYNARD: It is -- I think this is, in\nhis proffer, the relevant portion of it, is in the JA on\npage 97.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.\nMS. MAYNARD: And it says: \"Alternatively,\nthe expert will explain that if the moneys were not\nloans or advances or if Boulware did not use the moneys\nfor corporate purposes, then as the controlling\nshareholder, the moneys could be deemed a constructive\nreturn\" -- \"a constructive dividend or return of capital\nto Boulware, which may or may not be income, depending\non whether or not HIE\" -- the corporation -- \"had\nearnings and profits for the years when the moneys were\nobtained by Boulware.\"\nThat's all he proffered, an expert who would\ntestify that it could have been either dividends,\nJustice Breyer, or a return of capital. So he did\nrealize that he needed to show --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. I mean, the\ndistrict court -- the district court said that's not\nrelevant, it's not relevant whether they could be\nclassified as dividends. I'm quoting from your brief on\npage 8: \"It is not relevant whether the funds could\nhave been classified as a return of capital or a\ndividend at the time when they were diverted,\" because,\nhe said, what was relevant is -- is the intent, whether\nthey were in fact treated as return of capital.\nMS. MAYNARD: That's right, Your Honor, and\nour position is that in both civil and criminal cases\nbefore something can be treated under the tax treatment\nin 301(c), it must meet 301(a), which requires that,\nunder all the facts and circumstances it in fact be a\ndistribution, either a dividend or return of capital.\nAnd all his proffer testifies -- all his proffer offered\nis that it theoretically could be deemed a dividend or\ntheoretically could be deemed a return of capital.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I think maybe he was simply\ngetting at the fact that under 301, assuming the\npossibilities of non-301 treatment are excluded, under\n301 it will be treated either as a dividend or as a\nreturn of capital, depending on the corporate books for\nthat year, and he wasn't making a proffer at that point\nprecisely as to what those corporate books would show,\nbut he was making a proffer that, under 301, it would\neither be classified as a dividend or as a return of\ncapital. And wasn't that enough to -- to get him -- get\nhim the right to introduce the evidence?\nMS. MAYNARD: No, Your Honor. In our view,\n301(a), the language with respect to stock, and the\nregulations have so interpreted it and the legislative\nhistory makes clear that it was added to the 1954 Code\nspecifically to show that, before distributions can\nreceive that treatment. Regardless of what the facts\nare about E and P and regardless of what the facts are\nabout the basis, it had to have been a corporate\ndistribution with respect to stock.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but if he is\nmaking a profit and it depends upon whether or not\nthere's adequate earnings or not, isn't he plainly\nsaying that that means it's with respect to my stock?\nBecause if he were getting it, for example, as an\nemployee for consideration, it wouldn't matter whether\nthere was sufficient earnings or not. But when he says\nit depends on whether there's sufficient earnings, it\nseems to me that that's clearly notifying you that he's\nsaying it's with respect to his stock.\nMS. MAYNARD: This proffer also has factual\nproffers in it, Your Honor, and none of the factual\nproffers go to the fact that it was with respect to\nstock. The Petitioner testified --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He said -- and it seems to\nme that this is enough to put you on notice -- \"Boulware\nwill present further evidence that all of the alleged\nunreported income was either a loan or advance or was\nused by Boulware for corporate purposes or for the\nbenefit of HIE.\"\nMS. MAYNARD: He --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Now, \"for corporate\npurposes\" would include either a return of capital or a\ndividend, payment out to shareholders.\nMS. MAYNARD: No, Your Honor. No, Your\nHonor, it wouldn't. For corporate purposes -- and he\ntestified here, and he testified as to those three\nthings. He testified that he thought the moneys were\nalways corporate moneys. In other words, that he'd been\ngiven them to use them to buy coffee and do other things\nthat were for the corporation. He testified that,\nalternatively, he thought they were loans to him and\nthat he was going to pay them. And alternatively he\nthought that they were corporate advances to him. The\njury was instructed on all those things and rejected\nthem in convicting him.\nBut he did not testify that he thought he\nwas being paid a dividend. He did not testify that he\nthought he was being paid a return of capital. And the\nreason he proffered an expert is because he doesn't\nbelieve there is this first element of the defense, at\nbottom, that the Government believes that there is, and\nthat in 301(a) the threshold requirement, with respect\nto stock -- and if you trace back the civil cases, and\nthe basis in the D'Agostino rule is based on civil cases\ninterpreting the old code --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Tell me about the civil\ncase? There would be a tax deficiency, and wouldn't the\nGovernment have to say what were the elements of the tax\ndeficiency?\nYou said in a criminal case they don't have\nto characterize it at all. You just say he got -- he\nhas money on which tax hasn't been paid, and there was a\nlikely source of income. But now you're in a deficiency\nmode, and the Government asserts a deficiency. Doesn't\nit have to say what the elements of the deficiency are?\nAnd what would it say in this case?\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, in this case the\nGovernment's position at bottom is that he stole these\nfunds, but that -- but in the criminal case it didn't\nneed to characterize it.\nI think -- and if I can take a common\ncriminal -- a common civil situation, Your Honor, where\na corporation comes in and tries to deduct a salary that\nit pays to a controlling shareholder and/or to, say, the\nspouse of the controlling shareholder who is also a\nshareholder, and the services that that person has\nprovided, the corporation has called it a salary and\ndeducted it as necessary business expenses, and the\nService comes in and says that's -- we're going to\ndisallow that deduction and then that's litigated in Tax\nCourt.\nIn that situation, the Government does often\nargue that that -- the excess -- you know, say this\nperson at home is providing $10,000 in bookkeeping\nservices to the corporation, when in fact a net value, a\nnet worth, fair market value of $10,000 of services, but\nbeing paid $500,000, and the corporation is deducting it\nas a necessary business expense of $500,000. The issue\nin that case will turn on whether or not there was an\nintent to compense for services, whether or not the\nservices are reasonable, and the Government may well\ncome in and say --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, let's take this\ncase. Let's take this case and not some hypothetical,\nand where -- on the civil side -- the Government is\nasserting a deficiency. Just change one thing. The\ncorporation is rich with earnings and profits. What\nwould the notice of deficiency say?\nMS. MAYNARD: You know, I -- to be honest\nwith you, Your Honor, I don't know, but the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Wouldn't the Government\nwant to take the position that this is a dividend and\nnot something else, if that were the case?\nMS. MAYNARD: The Government --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If there were earnings\nand profits.\nMS. MAYNARD: The Government might want to\ntake that position, Your Honor. On the facts of this\ncase, the Government's position is that he stole these\nfunds. But in a hypothetical situation like this case,\nif the Government wanted to take a position, it is our\nview here and certainly if you adopt the rule that we're\narguing for, that 301(a) -- that there must be -- the\nfacts and circumstances must suggest that the moneys\nwere taken out with respect to the stock because of the\nperson's status as a shareholder.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Maynard, may I just go\nback to your hypothetical for a second? In the closely\nheld corporation situation you describe where they pay a\nhuge salary to the wife of the president and they decide\nyou can't deduct that, that's really a dividend --\nthat's what the Government normally does in that\nsituation. And don't they decide it's a dividend\nirrespective of the intent of the company making the\ndistribution?\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, in that situation --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So there's no attempt on\nthe part of them to satisfy with \"respect to stock\"\nrequirement?\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, the express intent, Your\nHonor, is belied by all the facts and circumstances. I\nmean, just to be clear, the Government is arguing for an\nobjective test here -- JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but the\nonly fact and circumstance in your hypothetical is they\npaid them a million dollars when they only earned\n$100,000?\nMS. MAYNARD: Right.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And it's clearly with\nrespect to stock --\nMS. MAYNARD: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- regardless of intent?\nMS. MAYNARD: No, Your Honor. All the facts\nand circumstances would show that the expressed intent\nwas not the actual intent and that the -- what's really\ngoing on -- and that's what you're asking in all these\ncases, what's really going on? In what way did this\nperson get the payment, and why did they get the\npayment? Why did the corporation make a payment to this\nperson?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Surely he is entitled to\ntry to prove that. And I'm still hung up on your\nassertion that he made no proffer on it below.\nHere's another portion of the joint\nappendix. The expert, his expert, he says, will further\nexplain that if Boulware used -- this is on page 97,\nbottom of 97: \"If Boulware used the moneys for\ncorporate purposes, the moneys were not income to\nBoulware. Alternatively, the expert will explain that\nif the moneys were not loans or advances or if Boulware\ndid not use the moneys for corporate purposes, then as\nthe controlling shareholder, the moneys could be deemed\na constructive dividend or a return of capital to\nBoulware, which may or may not be income depending on\nwhether or not HIE had earnings.\"\nThat seems to me presenting the claim that\nhe asserts he should have been given an opportunity to\npresent.\nMS. MAYNARD: That's the language on which I\nrely to show that he's proffered nothing in basis in\nfacts, Your Honor. In order to present a defense to the\njury --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This is a criminal\ncase. He's presented the argument, but don't you have\nthe burden of showing as an element of tax deficiency\nthat what he's proffering there is not true?\nMS. MAYNARD: The Government doesn't -- it's\nclear under Holland -- have to refute every hypothetical\nnontaxable source. The defendant in the Second\nCircuit's Leonard decision and in Bok makes this\nclear -- there must be some basis on fact. And this is\njust an expert proffer. He already knows that.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Let me get something\nclear. They wish to introduce evidence. They wish to\nintroduce evidence. And you say, oh, well, the proffer\nis no good because there is no basis, so there was no\nevidence. I don't understand that.\nMS. MAYNARD: They wish to introduce expert\nevidence that it could be deemed, as a legal matter --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Oh, I see.\nMS. MAYNARD: They don't have --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And you say there was no\nother evidence in the record that the expert could use\nfor that testimony?\nMS. MAYNARD: Exactly, Your Honor. In fact,\nthe Ninth Circuit decision, on Pet. App. 6, makes that\nclear. Boulware presented no concrete proof that the\namounts were considered, intended. Or recorded on the\ncorporate records as a return on capital.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's not right.\nHe says right here that it may or may not be income\ndepending on a fact, not an expert's opinion, whether or\nnot HIE had earnings and profits for the years when the\nmoneys were obtained by Boulware. That's a question of\nfact. You look at the corporate books. You get the\naccountant on to testify. It's not an expert's view on\nwhat's legally relevant.\nMS. MAYNARD: But that fact goes to the\nsecond element. And what we're disputing is sufficiency\non the first element, which is that it must have been a\ncorporate distribution with respect to the\ncorporation's --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not totally\nrelevant if the question he is trying to submit, whether\nthey are earnings or profits or not, which will affect\nits treatment. It's only relevant if it's with respect\nto stock.\nMS. MAYNARD: Right, Your Honor. And he\npresented absolutely no factual basis --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But we don't -- we are not\ncertain on that one, I think, because of the cases he\nsaid before would this be a possible holding. If it was\na distribution in respect to the stock, and if he had\nsufficient basis, then if there were no earnings and\nprofits in the corporation during the year, it would be\ntreated as a tax deficiency -- no tax deficiency or it\nwould be a return of capital. Insofar as as the Ninth\nCircuit says something to the contrary, it is wrong.\nNow, if we remand to decide whether the --\nwhether he intended to prove and produced enough to show\nthey didn't have the earnings and profits and also to\nconsider the question of whether this was a distribution\nin respect to stock.\nMS. MAYNARD: If you were -- if you are\ngoing to remand, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Does the Government have\nany objection to what I just said?\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, if you're going to\nremand, Your Honor, all three elements should be opened.\nThe Government's view is that he knew that he needed --\nthat the Ninth Circuit's rule required him to proffer on\nthe first element, that, in other words, that it was\nintended to be a constructive corporate distribution by\nsomebody, that is any evidence -- this is not a high\nburden. He could have testified he thought it was a\nconstructive distribution intent. Either he could have\ntestified it was a dividend, or he could have testified\nhe thought it was a return of capital.\nMr. Monago also testified, Your Honor, that\nit was not -- there were no dividends during the\nrelevant period. So there is testimony in the\nGovernment's case that there were no dividends in the\nrelevant period and no returns of capital during the\nrelevant period. And he proffered no basis in fact to\nbelieve that what happened here nor did any of the facts\nthat suggest what happened here, unlike in our excessive\nsalary case, Your Honor, where the government books it\nas a deductible business expense, and one can infer from\nthe fact that it's such an unreasonable salary that it\nmust have been earnings and profits. Here the facts of\nrecord are that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, please --\nMS. MAYNARD: There is no way to infer from\nthe way in which he diverted these funds that these\nfunds were with respect to stocks.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMs. Maynard.\nMr. Cline, you have four -- ten minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN D. CLINE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. CLINE: Your Honor, I just want to make\na few quick points.\nThe phrase \"with respect to stock\" was never\ndiscussed in the district court at all. It was never\ndiscussed before the court of appeals panel at all. It\nwas never the basis in the lower courts for the\nGovernment's position that Mr. Boulware could not assert\na return of capital defense.\nThe Government's sole argument, from the\ntime it moved to exclude Mr. Boulware's testimony on\nthis issue and his evidence on this issue to the time\nthat it sought to prevent him from getting a jury\ninstruction on this issue, the Government's only\nargument was Miller, and in particular the Miller\nrequirement that there be an intent, a contemporaneous\nintent that the distribution be a return of capital.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do you think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Even so, no harm no foul,\nif, in fact, you hadn't proffered any evidence that\nwould enable you to meet the -- in respect to stock\nrequirement. Now, what do you say to the contention\nthat you hadn't proffered anything?\nMR. CLINE: I say several things, Justice\nScalia. First of all, I think there was an adequate\nproffer at page 97 of the joint appendix.\nSecond, at pages 62 through 66 of the joint\nappendix, Mr. Boulware specifically invokes Truesdell\nand the -- and the D'Agostino no earnings, no profits --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, at 97, are you\nsaying that the expert would have brought with him\nfinancial records to show earnings and profits and\nbasis? Because I interpret the Government as saying\nthere was nothing for him to testify to because there\nwas no other -- the basic value was not in the record.\nMR. CLINE: Justice Kennedy, there actually\nis a fair amount of basis data in the record. And I can\nquickly refer the Court to the portions of the joint\nappendix. There is testimony, for example, that\nMr. Boulware contributed a water company value of\nroughly $1.7 million dollars to HIE. That's at joint\nappendix 70 through 73, 116 through 23, 147 through 51.\nThere's evidence that he contributed a\ncoffee processing and wholesaling business valued at\nroughly $1.8 million. That's at joint appendix 123\nthrough 27, 151 through 53.\nThere was evidence that he spent money on\ncoffee beans for --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But those are different.\nThose are whether that's a corporate purpose. I think\nthe question here is, as I started, I thought that this\nexpert was going to testify that there were no earnings\nand profits in the relevant year. Having read it more\nclosely, it seems to me that that is not what the expert\nis going to testify. Rather, he's going to say if there\nwere no earnings and profits, then it is a return of\ncapital if the basis is high enough. He's going to\ntestify to that legal proposition.\nSo, my question is, is there any proffer of\nevidence here where the taxpayer says I want a chance to\nshow there were no earnings or profits?\nMR. CLINE: Justice Breyer --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Where is it?\nMR. CLINE: That's how I read the portion of\nthe joint appendix at pages 62 through 66 that I\nreferred to where Mr. Boulware invokes that rule.\nNow, the problem here was that at no\npoint -- from the very beginning, the Government brought\nthis issue to fore by filing a motion in limine. And\nthe sole focus of the Government's motion in limine was\nthe Miller contemporaneous intent rule, and that was the\nsole focus of the discussion. That's all anyone talked\nabout in the district court.\nAnd so, Justice Breyer, the proffer is not\nas wholesome as I might hope, but it's clear that\nMr. Boulware sought the opportunity to present earnings\nand profits and basic information through expert\ntestimony.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you recognize that he\nwould have the burden? If he said this corporation had\nno earnings and profits so what I got was a return of\ncapital, it would be his burden to show that?\nMR. CLINE: I think, Justice Ginsburg, that\nunder the rule in Bok and under the rule that the\nparties proceeded under in the district court in this\ncase, whether or not it's the correct rule, Mr. Boulware\nhad the burden of producing some evidence, some evidence\nof the earnings and profits and the basis issues. Then\nthe burden of persuasion --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Coming forward, he had\nthe burden of coming forward?\nMR. CLINE: Just the burden of coming\nforward with some evidence, even if it's weak evidence\nor not credible evidence, just to put the issue in play.\nThen the burden of persuasion beyond a reasonable doubt\nrests with the Government.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where is that\nevidence? If he has the burden of coming forward with\nit, I assume that means in the proffer. And where is\nit?\nMR. CLINE: The evidence, Your Honor, is in\nthe record where I have previously identified.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice Breyer's\npoint is that that isn't directed to that issue. It's\ndirected to the issue of whether he was using the funds\nfor a corporate purpose.\nMR. CLINE: Actually, Your Honor, it was --\nit was -- the evidence that came into the record came\ninto the record more or less by happenstance because the\ndistrict court had prohibited any evidence of return of\ncapital.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And that evidence\ncame in after the proffer, didn't it?\nMR. CLINE: No. It came in throughout the\ntrial.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, this is a\nmotion in limine which is before the trial.\nMR. CLINE: No. The motion was actually\nfiled June 30th, which is, I think, the third day of\ntrial. The issue was litigated continuously throughout\nthe trial up until, I think, July 11th, which was a day\nor two before it ended. This issue came up repeatedly\nthroughout the trial.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So what did happen there?\nI've been looking at page 62 through 66. They are\ndancing around the issue. It's fair to say that they\nwouldn't be having these four pages unless they are\nthinking of return of capital as a defense, but they\ndon't actually say it.\nMR. CLINE: Justice Breyer, had the issue\nnot been limited to the Miller --\nJUSTICE BREYER: They would have raised it.\nMR. CLINE: I believe that Mr. Boulware\nwould have presented expert testimony that would, in\nfact, have at least put into play the issue of earnings\nand profits and basis.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well am I -- am I right\nthat all he would have to do in order to satisfy that\nburden would be this: He would have the option, which I\ngather he availed himself of, to show that, in fact, the\n-- the funds were loans or non-income to him.\nAnd he would also have had the option to\nfollow that by putting on the corporate accountant\nsaying: This guy is a stockholder. It's what the\ncorporate books show. In fact, that's not in dispute.\nNo. 2, the corporation didn't have any\nprofits that year. No. 3, if the money was diverted, if\nthe money was corporate funds, the only thing left under\n301 is to treat it as a return of capital. And if, in\nfact, the funds exceeded his basis, to treat it as a\ncapital gain.\nSo all he had to do, in effect, to make the\nproffer, as I understand it, is to say: If you don't\nbelieve me that this was non-income like a loan, then\nall I have to do is to put in the evidence that the\ncorporation didn't have any -- any profits that year,\nand Section 301 will take care of the rest of it.\nBecause you have to conclude that it's either a return\nof capital or a capital gain.\nIs that fair? Is that correct?\nMR. CLINE: I think that's basically right,\nJustice Souter, and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, wait. Doesn't he\nhave to show, still show, that it's with respect to\nstock?\nMR. CLINE: Yes, but --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That one little element:\nThat he has to show the distribution was not because\nthis was his girlfriend, but it was with respect to\nstock, and the record is -- is that the intent?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But doesn't -- doesn't he\nsuffice, on a going forward burden, simply to show that\nhe is a stockholder?\nMR. CLINE: I think so, Justice Souter, and\nI think --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I mean I agree with Justice\nScalia, but doesn't he make it at least to the point of\nputting the Government to its proof by showing that he\nis a stockholder?\nMR. CLINE: That he is a stockholder, and\nthat he did not receive this money in any nonstockholder\ncapacity.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nMR. CLINE: For example, for income or\nsomething like that. And I think the record is probably\nadequate as it stands. Now, he was clearly a\nstockholder. He would not have received this money had\nhe not been a stockholder.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's kind of\nhard to say it's with respect to stock when the other\nstockholder doesn't get any.\nMR. CLINE: Chief Justice Roberts, the\ncases, again, are uniform -- and we cite them, I think,\nat footnote 8 of our reply brief -- that you can have a\nconstructive distribution even if there are no corporate\nformalities, even if it's a disproportionate\ndistribution, even if other stockholders don't share it.\nAnd, again, that's a position that the Government\nargues.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What page in your\nbrief did you say?\nMR. CLINE: I believe it is -- the cases are\ncited, I believe, at footnote 8 of our reply brief. Let\nme just make sure.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of your reply brief?\nMR. CLINE: It's footnote 3 -- I'm sorry.\nIt's footnote 3 on page 8, and there is a whole series\nof cases. And, again, as far as I know, Mr. Chief\nJustice, there is no law to the contrary, and this is a\nposition that the Government, itself, argues.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The issue is whether the\nGovernment wants to convict more -- more malfeasors or\nwhether it wants to collect more money, and the latter\nobviously prevails in the cases, right?\nMR. CLINE: But, Justice Scalia, it seems to\nprevail only in this case, and I would be astonished if\ncounsel argues that the Government views Mr. Boulware as\nhaving stolen this money from the corporation. I would\nbe astonished if the Government would accept a theft\ndeduction, if HIE argued for it, when the Government\nseeks to collect these -- the corporate income from HIE.\nUnless the court has further questions --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
