United States.\nMs. Cain.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CANDACE CAIN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. CAIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nRecognizing that certain offenders convicted\nbefore enactment or an implementation of SORNA would be\nunable to comply with SORNA's initial registration\nrequirement, Congress included section 16913(d)\ndelegating to the Attorney General the authority to\ndetermine whether and how to apply SORNA's registration\nrequirements to those offenders.\nMr. Reynolds is one of those offenders\nbecause he was convicted, sentenced, and released from\nprison a year before SORNA was enacted. But for a valid\nexercise of the Attorney General's authority under\nsubsection (d), Mr. Reynolds had no obligation to\nregister under SORNA, could not initially register under\nSORNA, and, therefore, was not subject to SORNA's\ncriminal penalties. Action by the Attorney General was\nneeded to bring offenders like Mr. Reynolds into the new\nsystem.\nAnd because both implementing SORNA and\ndetermining whether and how SORNA would be applied to\npre-enactment offenders would require time and\nconsideration, Congress left the Wetterling Act\nregistration law in place for 3 years to ensure that all\noffenders would be covered under the old law. And\nuntil -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Was the -- is the\nWetterling Act retroactive?\nMS. CAIN: The Wetterling Act, Your Honor,\nwas remaining in place for 3 years and had a sort of a\nsunset provision under -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no, I know.\nThat's going forward. But was the requirement to\nregister under the Wetterling Act -- did that apply as\nof the enactment date or did that reach back?\nMS. CAIN: Your Honor, actually the\nWetterling Act was not effective for a year into the\nfuture.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, you think it\nonly applied to that year?\nMS. CAIN: No, I'm sorry. The Wetterling\nAct was enacted in -- in 1996.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, if the offense\nwere committed in 1994, did that person have to register\nunder the Wetterling Act?\nMS. CAIN: They had to register, but there\nwere no criminal penalties. At that point, it was a\n1994 law called Wetterling, and then 2 years later under\nthe Lychner Act, criminal penalties were added.\nOur reading better accords with the text and\ncongressional intent -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you clarify that\nanswer? The -- are you admitting that there were no\ncriminal enforcement options for the Attorney General\nunder the Wetterling Act for acts committed prior to\n1996? Is that what you're saying?\nMS. CAIN: Your Honor, the Wetterling Act,\nas it was enacted in 1994, was a registration\nrequirement without criminal penalties. In 1996, the\nLychner Act was enacted amending Wetterling and added\nthe criminal penalty, the Federal criminal penalty of\n1-year punishment for failure to register.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And that included all\nindividuals who had -- who had been convicted of -- of\nsex abuse acts before 1996?\nMS. CAIN: I don't know.\nOur reading better accords with the text of\nSORNA and congressional intent, but the Government\nreading is simply not reasonable. If SORNA were to\napply to all pre-enactment and pre-implementation\noffenders on day one, and the Attorney General could\nthen modify in the future, which would in fact -- in\neffect repeal SORNA as to some offenders, then you could\nhave a situation where someone was convicted of an\noffense and then have to be covered under SORNA, and\nthen later the AG could decide that that group was\nnot required to register.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, maybe -- maybe the\nAttorney General doesn't have that power. But your\nposition is that whether this behavior, not registering,\nis criminal or not is left up to the Attorney General,\nis left up to the executive. Do we have other examples\nwhere Congress says, well, we don't know whether this\nshould be a criminal offense; so, we're going to leave\nit to the Attorney General?\nIt's quite different to say the Attorney\nGeneral will implement it in the technical details, but\nto say that whether it's a criminal offense or not is up\nto the Attorney General -- is there any other instance\nwhere that's so?\nMS. CAIN: Your Honor, I'm not aware of any,\nbut we don't -- this is not what the Attorney General is\ndoing. This is -- SORNA is a civil registration\nrequirement, and the Attorney General is deciding\nwhether someone has to register. In order for a\ncriminal indictment to be brought, a person would have\nto travel and then fail to register. So, it's really\nnot actually deciding whether someone would be guilty of\na crime or convicted of a crime or exposed to a crime.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- maybe I just don't\ngrasp the core of the case then. I thought this was a\ncriminal conviction and that you were arguing that it's\na criminal conviction because the conduct that's\nprohibited by the statute was conduct that covered this\nclass of people by order of the Attorney General under\nthe interim regs. I mean, is that wrong?\nMS. CAIN: Your Honor, actually what we are\nseeking is the ability to contest the Attorney General's\nrule. We're saying -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm asking, isn't this is\ncriminal conviction that resulted from the fact that\nyour client was within the class of persons covered by\nthe statute? The Government says they're covered\nanyway. You say they're covered only because the\nAttorney General acted, but then you say it's a criminal\n-- it's a civil provision? I -- I -\nMS. CAIN: Well, Your Honor, it is -\nfailure to register and then travel -- I mean, travel\nand then fail to register after you are obligated under\nSORNA to register is a crime, yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I -- you know, my\nproblem is that's very strange. I find it very strange\nto leave it up to the Attorney General whether something\nwill be a crime or not. It will be a crime if the\nAttorney General says so, and it won't be a crime if he\ndoesn't. I mean, especially leave it up to the Attorney\nGeneral, for Pete's sake; he's the prosecutor. You\nknow, it will be a crime if the prosecutor thinks it is,\nand it won't be a crime if the prosecutor thinks it\nisn't. I don't -- I don't know of any parallel, and -\nand I -- I think it's sailing close to the edge of\nunconstitutionality; whereas, what the other side claims\nis simply it's a crime to begin with, but the Attorney\nGeneral can make it not a crime. That -- that's sort of\nlike prosecutorial discretion. In -- in his -- in his\njudgment, if it shouldn't be a crime, you know -- I have\ntrouble with that, too. But it's a lot -\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But it's a lot closer to\nprosecutorial discretion than -- than what you're asking\nus to accept, that something is a crime only if the\nAttorney General says it's a crime. That seems to me\nvery strange.\nMS. CAIN: Well, Your Honor, that's really\nwhat the text says, and our reading -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But are you -- now -- now\nwe do -- the Attorney General has spoken. The first\ntime, you say it was ineffective because there was no\nnotice and comment. But from -- what is it -- August of\n1908, we have a rule, a final rule, that did go through\nnotice and comment. So, are we talking about, is this\ncase simply about the period from February 1907 to\nAugust 1908, and that's -- that's all that's involved in\nthis case, only those people? Or are you contesting\nthat after August 1908, you still have some kind of\nclaim?\nMS. CAIN: Well, Your Honor, our -- our case\ndoes not involve the time period after August of 2008.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So, it's -- so, this\nwhole case is about what happens between February '07\nand August '08, and that's the limit of it.\nMS. CAIN: Right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Because there was no rule\nat all before February '07, and there was a rule August\n'08. So, it's just that period this case is about.\nMS. CAIN: Yes. Our client traveled in '07.\nAnd -\nJUSTICE ALITO: It's the period from the\nenactment of SORNA until the adoption of the SMART\nguidelines, right? That's what we're talking about?\nMS. CAIN: Well, Your Honor, if the SMART\nguidelines are deemed valid, yes. But that was -- in\n2008. Our client traveled in 2007. And so, the\nAttorney General's interim rule is the rule that would\nsubject him to criminal liability.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Excuse me. I'm -- let\nme go back to that question, counselor -- to that\nanswer. Let's assume we accepted the Solicitor\nGeneral's understanding of the rule, that it was illegal\nto travel -- that you had to be -- had to register from\nthe start of SORNA. What challenge do you have left\neither to the interim rule in 2007 or to the final rules\nin 2008? What -- what challenge could you conceivably\nmake?\nMS. CAIN: Your Honor, if the -- if the\nstatute applies from day one, we would still contest the\ninterim rule for -- the Attorney General took action but\ndid not exclude our client. The Attorney General did\nwhat he was authorized to do in subsection (d).\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What would be the basis\nof that challenge?\nMS. CAIN: Pardon me.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What would have\nobligated him to take your client out of SORNA?\nMS. CAIN: The exercise of his discretion to\nnot take him out -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you -- could you\ntell me why?\nMS. CAIN: Because -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What would be an abuse\nof his discretion if he didn't take your client out?\nMS. CAIN: He had exercised his discretion\nunder subsection (d) and decided not to exclude our\nclient from the -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That -- we're in a\ncircular argument.\nMS. CAIN: -- statute.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What would have\ncommanded him to take your client out?\nMS. CAIN: It would be his discretion.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You -- you would have to\nbring some sort of suit that said he abused his\ndiscretion. On what basis would he have -- what would\nbe your claim of abuse other than I really want my\nclient out?\nMS. CAIN: Well, that he would have\nstanding. That's what we're trying to -- we're trying\nto get standing to contest the interim rule.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But what impact would\nthe interim rules have had on you?\nMS. CAIN: If the statute applies from day\none without the interim rule, we still would -- that is\nwhat the standing issue is about. We're saying that the\ninterim rule is the only rule that gave -- gave the\ngovernment the ability to include Mr. Reynolds in the\nprosecution.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You have -\nMS. CAIN: This is -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You have a notice -\nnotice and comment claim, right?\nMS. CAIN: Yes. Yes, Your Honor, we do.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But what -- but what\nyou're challenging is interim rule, because there was no\nnotice and comment. So, you would have had no\nchallenge, not from the date of SORNA's enactment, but\nfrom the date of the rule that you're challenging -- and\nthat rule was February '07. Your challenge is to the\ninvalidity of the interim rule, right?\nMS. CAIN: That's right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Okay. So -- but before\nthere was an interim rule, you would have no such\nchallenge.\nMS. CAIN: No, but the -- SORNA would not\napply to Mr. Reynolds before then.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You might have some other\ncase, but this case is about a challenge to a rule as\ninvalid. Is that -- that's as I understand it. So,\nthere had to be the rule for you to make the challenge.\nMS. CAIN: I'm sorry. I missed the last\npart.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You are challenging the\nAttorney General's first rule as invalid, the\nFebruary '07 rule.\nMS. CAIN: That's right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You say it's invalid\nbecause there was no notice and comment. You have no\nchallenge -- your challenge doesn't reach before that,\nbecause there was no rule before that so that you can -\nthe earliest point is when the rule was adopted, you're\nsaying, the rule was invalid. So, that's why I said the\nbrackets are from when there was an allegedly invalid\nrule, which was in February '07, until when there's a\nvalid rule, which is in August of '08.\nMS. CAIN: That's right, Your Honor. I\nmean, that -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, that's not -\nno. Your argument, as I understand it, is there was no\nnotice and comment when he issued the interim rule.\nMS. CAIN: Right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If there had been\nnotice and comment, you would have jumped in with\ncomments that would have convinced the Attorney General\nnot to apply the rule to your client.\nMS. CAIN: That's right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.\nMS. CAIN: That's right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And your argument is\nfurther that without the rule, SORNA doesn't exist,\nright?\nMS. CAIN: For our client. He is -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMS. CAIN: He is unable to comply with the\ninitial registration provision under (b) because he was\nreleased from prison a year before SORNA was enacted.\nSo, he could not meet either one of the descriptions of\ninitial registration.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That doesn't mean -- that\ndoesn't mean SORNA doesn't apply; it means 2250 doesn't\napply.\nMS. CAIN: That's right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is that right?\nMS. CAIN: Well -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, it might be a\nmetaphysical, but it may be that Congress intended the\nstatute to apply to people like your client, but the\nquestion is when the initial registration has to take\nplace. And I took you as saying until the Attorney\nGeneral acts, we don't know. So, 2250 doesn't -\ndoesn't criminalize a failure until he can know when\nhe's supposed to register.\nMS. CAIN: Register under SORNA. That's\nright.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's right. Okay.\nMS. CAIN: The problem is here that the\nprosecution -- the Attorney General's office is\nsubstituting a State registration for the initial\nregistration under SORNA, and that's just not what the\ntext says.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Cain, why do you think\nCongress would have written the statute in this way? I\nmean, in your brief, you say it was all very complicated\nand Congress was worried about certain problems, the way\ndifferent registrations overlapped on each other. But\nexactly what was so complicated? Why couldn't Congress\njust have applied the statute to people in\nMr. Reynolds's situation itself?\nMS. CAIN: Well, even the Government agrees,\nin their brief, that there are complications.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I was going to ask the\nGovernment the same question. What are the\ncomplications -\nMS. CAIN: Well -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: -- that Congress was so\nworried about?\nMS. CAIN: Some sex offenders, you know,\nfrom the various States -- there were State laws that\nwere varied amongst each other. There was the Federal\nWetterling Act that had its own different periods of\nregistration and different requirements.\nAnd I think that one of the permutations -\nsome of them are that some sex offenders never had to\nregister in some States; some had been convicted before\nand had served out their time and no longer had to\nregister; and some were released from prison, you know,\nbefore the enactment or implementation of -- of SORNA.\nAnd an example of a permutation that\nwas going to take some thought and some consideration is\nthe one that sort of is an example in a different\ncontext, in the Federal Register and in the Government's\nbrief, which is that certain people who had served their\ntime and were completely out of the system, if they got\nre-arrested for a misdemeanor, the Attorney General\ndecided that those individuals did not have to register\nfor a State to be deemed substantially implemented with\nrespect to SORNA. And so, that's an example of a type\nof decision, a complication that the Attorney General\nwas particularly well-suited to deciding and making that\ndetermination.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Arrested for a\nmisdemeanor to do what?\nMS. CAIN: Any arrest for a misdemeanor that\nwould bring a previous offender back in the system -- if\nthat person was just convicted of a misdemeanor, they\nwould not -- the State would not have to re-register\nthem in order to be deemed substantially compliant with\nSORNA and get the Byrne grant money.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I thought Justice\nKagan's question was, what would have stopped Congress\nfrom just saying you have to register on the day of\npassage? There was nothing to stop Congress from doing\nthat, correct?\nMS. CAIN: They could have done that, but\nthey were concerned about how you get the older\nconviction, the older pre-enactment people into the new\nsystem.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's your reason for\nwhy they didn't do that. They didn't make it automatic,\ncorrect? That's your argument?\nMS. CAIN: Right. They wanted to have a new\nregistration, a new system that would start from a\ncertain point that would bring in new requirements. And\nthe problem is how to get the people with the older\nconvictions and the older registrations into the system.\nAnd that would be done with initial registration. But\nMr. Reynolds -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, why is -\nMS CAIN: -- can't register.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Why is it easier for the\nAttorney General to do that by regulation than for\nCongress simply to do it by the statute itself? What\ndid they expect to happen in the regulatory process that\nwould solve these problems for them?\nMS. CAIN: Well, I think that it's more\nflexible to have a regulation and takes perhaps less\ntime than legislation to think of all the different\npermutations. They don't know every State's laws and\nevery State's capabilities. And so, it was more\nflexible, and -- and they could respond more quickly to\nchanges.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, take this case.\nWhat would compliance entail other than simply telling\nthe Missouri authority -- I mean, he had to register,\nwas registered in Missouri -- telling the Missouri\nauthority that he was moving to another State? That's\nall he had to do, right, to comply?\nMS. CAIN: Comply with Missouri's law? The\nState law?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: To comply with the -- the\nSORNA requirement, that he'd have to tell the Missouri\nauthority that he was moving to another State. And then\nMissouri would have an obligation to tell that other\nState he's there.\nMS. CAIN: Well, Your Honor, that -- your\nquestion assumes that State registration would suffice\nfor SORNA. And, respectfully, the -- SORNA was not\nenacted until -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But I'm talking about\nSORNA has been enacted, and now he's moving after SORNA\nis enacted, right?\nMS. CAIN: Right. Well, that's -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Okay. So -- so, SORNA is\non the books. He's registered in Missouri. He's\nleaving the State. To comply with SORNA, what does he\nhave to do other than tell the original State, I'm\nmoving to another State?\nMS. CAIN: Well, he would have to comply\nwith the requirements of initial registration under\nSORNA. Those contain more requirements than under the\nMissouri -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But he can't -- he can't\ncomply with the initial registration because he\ncommitted this crime even before SORNA was enacted.\nMS. CAIN: Under -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But now, what would he\nhave to do to be in compliance?\nMS. CAIN: With Missouri law, with State\nlaw, would be, to comply with Missouri law, tell\nMissouri he is leaving and then go to Pennsylvania and\ncomply with Pennsylvania law, perhaps. And that's also\nnot a SORNA registration; that is a registration under\nState law.\nWe know from Carr that SORNA is -- doesn't\ncreate an obligation until the statute's effective date.\nAnd the statute's effective date is after a valid\nAttorney General regulation for purposes of people like\nMr. Reynolds.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Could you tell me, Ms.\nCain -- you may have said this, and I may just have\nmissed it. But under the new regulations, a man who's\nin the position of your client and who cannot initially\nregister under (b) -- (b) just doesn't fit his\ncircumstances -- does he now have to initially register\nagain, or does his initial registration stick and he\njust has to update it when he moves?\nMS. CAIN: The initial registration under\nSORNA could be updated. The State registration that he\nmay have already done in the past is not a SORNA\nregistration. He would have to register initially\nagain, and that is a new registration. And that would\nbe what Congress intended, because their goal was to not\nhave a patchwork of regulations and rules. So, it would\nbe a new registration, but an update of a SORNA\nregistration is certainly possible, yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Under the current\nregulation, under the 19 -- I mean, the '08 regulations,\nwould it be enough to comply -- for somebody in his\nsituation, to comply simply by telling his parole\nofficer, I'm moving to the other State? Under the\nregulation that says how this is implemented?\nMS. CAIN: Actually, Your Honor, no. We\nactually don't know the answer to that question, because\nthe Attorney General has not issued regulations\ninstructing offenders what to do. They have simply\nissued guidelines telling the States what they can do to\nsubstantially implement SORNA. So, we don't really know\nthe answer to that question.\nThe point is that the requirement to\ninitially register under SORNA was not effective until\nthe Attorney General -- could not be effective until the\nAttorney General said so. And that's what the statute\nsays under (d). And that if you look at how the\nGovernment is reading the statue, you apply it from day\none, but yet they have the ability to modify SORNA,\nwhich in effect means to repeal SORNA's effect as to\nsome people in the future. That also would cause a lot\nof complications, especially in the context I mentioned\nwhere someone with a misdemeanor, you know, may be part\nof the group that doesn't have to register in the\nfuture, but they had to at some point, and -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, let's -- is\nthere anything -- if I understand the Solicitor\nGeneral's position, all your client had to do after\nSORNA was passed was, after a reasonable amount of time\nor upon his travel, to tell Missouri, which was his\nState of conviction, that he was moving. Correct?\nMS. CAIN: If you -- they say that he was\nnot part of the people that could register within a\nnormal -- I mean, a reasonable amount of time because of\nthe State registration.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Right.\nMS. CAIN: But assuming that that wasn't the\ncase, assuming he was, you know, just -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, I'm not assuming\nthat.\nMS. CAIN: Okay.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Would he have been in\ncompliance with SORNA under the final rules today, the\ninterim rules when they were passed, or on the date that\nhe left if he had when he traveled, or a reasonable time\nthereafter, told his State of conviction that he had\nmoved? Would that have been enough?\nMS. CAIN: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What does he have to do\nin addition to that, under the interim or final rules?\nMS. CAIN: We don't know. Because, again,\nthe Attorney General has not issued regulations or\nguidelines telling offenders what to do. They have only\nissued guidelines telling jurisdictions how they can\nsubstantially implement SORNA. So, it's not as\nthough -- he cannot register under SORNA until the\nAttorney General specifies that he -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That was the answer that\nyou gave to my question, which was the same thing: Why\nisn't it sufficient now for him simply to tell his\nparole officer he's moving?\nMS. CAIN: Oh, I'm sorry. Yes. That was -\nit would not be sufficient. I mean, it's -- he has to\ninitially register to register under SORNA. And he\ncan't do that until the Attorney General issued a valid\nrule, which -- we are contesting that the 2007 rule is\nnot valid. We're saying that our client has standing to\nmake that challenge. We were denied the ability to do\nthat below.\nAnd I would like to reserve my time if\nthere's no further questions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMs. Sherry.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MELISSA ARBUS SHERRY\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nIf I could start by answering your question,\nYour Honor, about the Wetterling Act, it was not\nretroactive. It didn't apply to pre-enactment conduct.\nIt defined a sex offender, unlike SORNA, as somebody who\nis convicted of a sex offense, and in guidelines issued\nafter Wetterling and after several subsequent amendments\nto the Wetterling Act, the Attorney General interpreted\nit as only requiring States to register offenders that\nare convicted not only post-enactment but\npost-implementation by the States. And one such cite\nis 61 -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Post- what?\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: Post-implementation by\nthe States. And so, 61 Federal Register cite 15,112 is\njust one example of that type of regulation. And so,\nwhen Congress enacted SORNA, it switched from \"is\nconvicted\" to \"was convicted\" in order to include\npre-enactment offenders.\nJustice Kagan, to get to your question about\nwhy is it all so complicated, our answer is that it\nreally is not. There's no reason why it couldn't have\napplied on day one to all pre-enactment and\npre-implementation offenders. And to start off, when\nyou look about all pre-enactment and pre-implementation,\nthis is an incredibly large class. This is all existing\nsex offenders on day one and all existing sex offenders\nfrom many months and years going forward while the\nStates proceed towards implementation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, why -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But then, as I indicated,\nwhy would Congress have given you the authority to\nexempt people? It seems to me that the -- the burden is\non you in the exact same way it's on Ms. Cain.\nMS. SHERRY: In our view, what subsection\n(d) was, essentially, was a safety valve. It wasn't\nsomething that Congress thought the Attorney General was\ngoing to need to use, but it was something that was\nthere for the Attorney General, should problems arise in\nthe course of implementation.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What would happen in -- in\nthis situation: Someone is convicted of a sex offense\nbefore SORNA is enacted; then shortly after the statute\nis enacted, the person moves to a new State, does not\nregister; then after that, the Attorney General,\nexercising the authority that you say he has under -\nexercising -- excuse me, exercising the authority under\nsubsection (d), determines that SORNA shouldn't apply to\npeople who were convicted of offenses before its\nenactment? Would that person have committed a criminal\noffense?\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: I think at the -- at the\ntime he acted, yes. I suppose the Attorney General\ncould decide whether or not he was going to apply his\nregulation prospectively or retrospectively. But I\nthink the important point is the same result is reached\nunder Petitioner's view.\nOn Petitioner's view, the Attorney General\nhas full and complete control of the light switch.\nCongress didn't do anything and simply left it for the\nAttorney General to turn the lights on. We don't think\nthat's right for a number of different reasons, one of\nwhich is the way that Congress delegated authority to\nAttorney General in subsection (d). If -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, if Congress wasn't\nsure whether it wanted -- whether it was appropriate to\napply SORNA retroactively, then I just -- and,\ntherefore, was willing to leave that to the Attorney\nGeneral, then I don't understand why it would have made\nthe Act applicable immediately upon enactment -\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: Our -\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- pending a determination\nby the Attorney General.\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: Our understanding is that\nCongress did know that it wanted to include as a general\nmatter all pre-enactment -- and again, not just\npre-enactment but pre-implementation offenders as -\noffenders as well. And I think we know that because\nwhen you look to the provisions that actually speak to\nwhat a sex offender was required to do under the Act -\nand there are six such provisions -- they all start the\nsame way. They say that the sex offender shall do\nsomething. And it defines the sex offender as somebody\nwho was convicted.\nWhen you look at all six of those provisions\non their face, they apply to all sex offenders so\ndefined without any qualification. And Petitioner's\nview is that despite that clear language, despite the\nlack of any qualification within those provisions, by\nvirtue of subsection (d) what Congress is really saying\nis that nobody has to register until the Attorney\nGeneral says otherwise.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, how do they know\nwhere to register? Do you agree with your adversary\nthat -- that they have to register under SORNA?\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: No, I -- they don't have\nto register under SORNA -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, how were they\nsupposed to know when or how they would register until\nthe Attorney General acted?\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: Sure. If I could break\nit up into a few classes. Again, we are talking about\npretty much -- actually, we are talking about everybody\non day one. And so, for a number of pre-enactment and\npre-implementation offenders, they're still going to be\nin prison on the day that SORNA was enacted.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not talking about\nthose people.\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: Okay. So -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Not the people who can\ncomply with (b).\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: Okay.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm talking about the -\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: So, people -- and then\nthe second group I was going to talk about are offenders\nlike Reynolds, who have already registered before SORNA\nwas enacted. They're already initially registered.\nIt's the very same State registry system that\npre-existed SORNA. There is no creation of any SORNA\nregistry, and the statute itself doesn't talk about a\nSORNA-compliant registry. To the contrary, it defines a\nsex offender registry in 16911, subsection (9). And\nit's on page 10a of our brief. It defines a sex\noffender registry as a registry of sex offenders\nmaintained by a jurisdiction.\nSo, these are the same registries that have\nbeen in existence in all 50 States for the last decade.\nSo, offenders like Reynolds don't have to do anything\nunder (b); (b) simply doesn't apply to them. They do,\nhowever, as pointed out, have to comply with the other\nprovisions. They do have to do what (c) requires, which\nis when Reynolds moved from Missouri to Pennsylvania, he\nhad to tell somebody. That is what (c) requires; it's\nwhat he was required to do even before SORNA was\nenacted. And what Congress did with respect to the\nsubset of sex offenders that haven't already registered\nbefore SORNA but that need to get on the registry rolls\nafterwards because, for example, their sex offense\nwasn't covered before SORNA -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, your -- your\nargument is that \"requirements\" in the heading for 42\nU.S.C. 16913, Registration requirements for sex\noffenders, means something different than \"requirements\"\nin subsection (d), which the Attorney General can issue\nrules about, because you're saying, although there is\nthe requirement that they register and comply with (c)\nand all those other things, when it says that the\nAttorney General can issue regulations specifying the\napplicability of the requirements of this subchapter,\nthat only meant the administration, you know,\nprovisions, not the general requirement that you\nregister and keep current and all that.\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: No, I don't think that\nthat is what we are saying. What we view (d) as,\nessentially, is a safety valve. It does give the\nAttorney General that authority with respect to the\nrequirements, but going forward. Congress has set the\nbaseline; Congress has set the default rule.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's a safety valve\nto release what?\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: To release sex offenders\nif needed to -- to perhaps suspend certain registration\nrequirements. And let me give a couple of examples.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you are\ntalking about sort of in the weeds, the little details,\nnot the underlying requirement of registration, right?\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: No, I think it -- I think\narguably it could be both. Again, I don't think this is\nsomething that Congress thought the Attorney General was\nnecessarily going to have to exercise. And, in fact,\nthe Attorney General has not done so.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But does that mean, Ms.\nSherry, that -- that the Attorney General could, if he\nwanted to, for whatever reason, could exempt all\npre-enactment offenders from SORNA?\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: I think as a theoretical\nmatter, on its face, the delegation of authority in (d)\nis -- is quite broad and plenary. But I think as -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And would allow that. So,\nwhen you say it gave the Attorney General the ability to\nconfirm or modify the requirement in section (a), you\nmean he could, if he wanted to, exempt all pre-enactment\noffenders.\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: And, again, I say in\ntheory because I think, like all delegations of\nauthority, the Attorney General is certainly limited to\nacting in furtherance of the purpose of Congress, and\nhere we know what was its purpose.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, we had a case\ninvolving the meaning of \"modify,\" and it doesn't -\ndoesn't mean \"repeal.\" So, he presumably couldn't\nsuspend the whole thing.\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: I -- I do know what case\nyou are talking about, and I have read it, and that's\ncertainly true.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But to confirm -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You want to share it\nwith the rest of us?\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: I'm not saying I\ndefinitely remember the name. I think it was MCI, but\n-- but I do know the case you are talking about. I\nmean, here the word is \"specify\" as opposed to \"modify.\"\nAnd I guess there could be an argument -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It authorized the FCC to\nmodify the requirement to post rates, and the FCC simply\neliminated the requirement to post rates, and we said\nthat that was no good.\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: And -- and I -- I suppose\na similar argument could be made with respect to\n\"specify.\" I don't think it necessarily has to be -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Leaving the language aside,\nI'd like to go back to what Justice Sotomayor was\nasking. We are talking, it seems to me, about section\n2250. He was convicted of violating, criminally, that\nsection. So, I have no problem about the statute\napplying to all these people; it's a question of how it\napplies.\nAll right. Imagine with me that we have an\nindividual who was convicted a year ago and sentenced to\na 5-year term. Does the statute apply to him?\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: He was convicted a year\nago -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, correct.\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: -- of a sex offense?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, correct.\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: In our view, the statute\ndoes apply.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Of course, it does. Of\ncourse, it does.\nNow, he hasn't registered yet. He's in jail\nfor 4 more years. So, has he violated 2250 so far?\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: He has not.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Not? Thank you.\nSo, a person who has recently -- recently -\ncommitted the crime, is in prison, is under an\nobligation to register, is yet not in violation because\nthe time for initially registration -- registering has\nnot yet expired. Now let's go back to a person who is\nfar less certain how it applies. He committed the crime\n10 or 15 years ago. He has long since been released\nfrom prison.\nThere are, as you point out, several\ncategories. One is a person who has to -- who should,\nunder Michigan State law, register, but he didn't.\nAnother is a person who did and moved. You know, there\nare several categories.\nNow, is he in violation of 2250? Your point\nis he is immediately, even though it was much less clear\nthat it applied to him, much less clear. And much less\nclear -- in fact, it doesn't say when he is supposed to\nregister, but still 2250 applies to him.\nI just wonder how that could be,\nparticularly when we have three sentences, indeed, which\nseem to me to tell the Attorney General, certainly,\nplease deal with that kind of a case.\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: If I could start with\n2250 and then go back to subsection (d), that is not our\nposition. 2250 is the criminal provision. What we're\nactually looking at here are the registration -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I thought he was convicted\nof a crime.\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: -- requirements.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I thought he was convicted\nof a crime under 2250. That's why I asked the question.\nAnd his lawyer said, in response to my question, that\none of the things she wants to argue is that he cannot\nbe convicted under 2250 until he is under a legal\nobligation to register, and that initial registration is\nnot a legal obligation until the Attorney General makes\nhis rules. I thought that was the argument.\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: Let me make an important\ndistinction. If we're actually talking about Reynolds\nhere, you are right, but Reynolds was not convicted and\nwas not prosecuted for failing to comply with the\ninitial registration requirements in subsection (b). He\nwas convicted and prosecuted for failing to comply with\nthe timing requirements in subsection (c), which are\nquite clear as applied to offenders like Reynolds, who\nhave already registered or already in the system.\nWhat he did was he traveled from Missouri -\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, subsection (c) says he\nhas to, not later than 3 days -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where is this? Do you want\nto tell us where it is?\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: I'm sorry. This is on\n12(a) of the Government's brief.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's very helpful to know\nwhat you're talking about.\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But you're suggesting, Ms.\nSherry, that (b) and (c) have nothing to do with each\nother. And, in fact, one can read (a), (b), and (c) as\nall integrally linked and referring only to\npost-enactment offenders. So, (a) is the umbrella\nprovision. It says \"a sex offender shall register, and\nkeep the registration current\"; (b) says how you shall\nregister initially; and (c) says how you shall keep that\nregistration current.\nSo, all three of these refer only to\npost-enactment offenders. And then (d) comes along and\nsays, by the way, the Attorney General can apply all of\nthis to pre-enactment offenders as well and can specify\nhow to do that.\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: Again, I don't think\nthat's right. And if it helps, I'd like to walk through\nthe different provisions. The one thing I would say on\nthe outset, however, is when you say that -- when you\nread those sections, you can read them as only applying\nto post-enactment offenders -- I don't think that's\nright, especially because of subsection (b), because on\nthe day that SORNA was enacted, every single person in\nprison at that time was by definition a pre-enactment\noffender. And so, on its face when you read subsection\n(b), it quite easily applies to quite a number of\npre-enactment offenders.\nAnd the other point I would make along those\nlines is the fact that subsection (d) just doesn't talk\nabout pre-enactment; it talks about pre-implementation\noffenders. So, offenders that were convicted after\nSORNA's enactment but before a State had implemented,\nagain, quite easily fit not only within subsection (b)\nbut within all the other subsections as well.\nAnd with respect to the interrelationship\nbetween them, I think subsection (a) really identifies\nthe jurisdictions in which an offender needs to\nregister. And so, the first sentence sets out three\njurisdictions and where an offender both needs to\nregister and to keep the information current.\nSubsection (b) really serves a limited\npurpose. It's an intake process. It's getting an\noffender into the system. For offenders like Reynolds\nwho are already in the very same system, there's nothing\nto be done under (b); (b) simply doesn't apply to them.\n(B) is applied to people who are not already in that\nsystem, and for those that can comply with the timing,\nit gets them in before they're released to the\ncommunity.\nBut the inability to comply with subsection\n(b) for the small set of offenders that cannot comply\nwith the timing requirements, it doesn't immunize them\nfrom complying with all of the other registration\nrequirements.\nJUSTICE BREYER: In other words, you're\nreading (c) as saying, to go back to my example, the\nperson who was convicted last year and has 4 more years\nto do his initial registration -- nonetheless, if he\nchanges his name, if he stops being a student while in\nprison, he has to register tomorrow or the day after. I\nwould say if that's your reading of those two sections,\nit's -- it's going to confuse everybody who is in\nprison, as it did confuse me.\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: That is not my reading of\nthe statute.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Then I take it\nyour reading is he does not have to fulfill (c) until\nafter he has to have initially registered. And so,\nwe're back to the question of why you treat somebody who\ncommitted the crime long ago with less clarity, with\nless time to initially register, with more confusion\nfrom one jurisdiction than another, than you would treat\na person who was convicted last year, is still in jail,\nand has 4 more years to register. That's why I read (d)\nas trying to sort that kind of thing out.\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: Two points on that:\nNumber one, for offenders like Reynolds that are already\nregistered, there's nothing more to be done as far as\nregistration goes. All they need to do is to keep the\ninformation current and to keep it updated.\nThe other point I would make, since we're\ntalking about 2250, Congress provided other protections\nfor offenders that were unable to comply with the timing\nrequirements. Number one, it -- it provided an\nimpossibility affirmative defense in 2250(b). And the\nother thing that Congress did is it required that any\nfailure to register, in order to be subject to criminal\nsanctions, that it be a knowing failure to register. In\nother words, that the offender know he has a\nregistration requirement and know that he is not\ncomplying with that requirement.\nSo, the idea that there are some\nhypothetical, or maybe even not so hypothetical, sex\noffenders out there who can't comply with the precise\ntiming in (b) and will -- have no idea what they're\nrequired to do, they're not going to be -- they're not\ngoing to be criminally liable under 2250 because there\nis an impossibility defense. And to the extent they\ndon't know that they have a registration requirement,\nthey're also not going to be criminally liable under\n2250.\nAnd so -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why -- why isn't\npart of your answer to Justice Breyer's question that\nthe one person who doesn't have to register for 4 years\nis in prison already; so, presumably, he doesn't present\nthe same type of threat that led to the enactment of\nthese registration laws in the first place?\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: That's absolutely right.\nI mean, the release from -- the reason the release from\nprison is the -- is the trigger is because the concern\nand the reason we have registration is for periods of\ntime where these offenders are released into the\ncommunity.\nAnd that's why the timing requirement in (b)\nis there. The notion is that, before offenders are\nreleased into the community, we want to get them on the\nregistry rolls; we want to be able to track them from\nthe day that they're released.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I see. Your view is that\nthey have to register initially when?\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: If they have not?\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no, I'm just saying\ntake my example. The person is in Michigan. Michigan\ndoes have a sex registration thing, but he never\nactually did it. So, now this Federal Act comes in, and\nnow when is he supposed to register? When's his initial\nregistration?\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: He is to register within\na reasonable time.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, reasonable time.\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: He can only be -\nJUSTICE BREYER: And what is a reasonable\ntime?\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: Given the other timing in\nthe rest of the requirements, something probably along\nthe lines of, give or take, 3 business days. The\nimportant point, however -\nJUSTICE BREYER: In 3 business days, he's\nsupposed to go out and do that, and if he doesn't do it,\nhe has committed a Federal crime which makes no mention\nof it, no mention at all, and he's just supposed to\nguess that that's 3 business days because he's a lawyer;\nis that why?\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: No, it's actually -- it's\nnot unique with respect to the statute. It's quite\ncommon for status offenses, and let me try to give one\nexample. One of the statutes that this Court looked at\nfairly recently, 922(g)(9), makes it unlawful to possess\na firearm after having a conviction for a misdemeanor\ncrime of domestic violence. That statute was passed in\n1996, and it applied to everybody who has been convicted\nof a domestic violence offense.\nAnd so, if an individual had a domestic\nviolence conviction in 1990, for example, and had had a\nfirearm in his house, in his possession, for the last\n20 years, when the statute was passed in 1996 he was in\nviolation of the statute. Of course, he couldn't be\ncriminally prosecuted unless he was given some\nreasonable period of time to get rid of the firearm.\nBut there's nothing unique with respect to that.\nAnd, again, the criminal provision here,\n2250, provides additional protections. It has an\naffirmative defense for impossibility, and it requires\nthat there be knowledge. So, for an offender that knows\nhe is required to register, he's given a reasonable\namount of time to come into compliance with that\nregistration requirement.\nReynolds, in particular, is a good example\nhere of what Congress was trying to get at. Reynolds\nknew he was required to tell somebody when he moved from\nMissouri to Pennsylvania. He knew that because he\nsigned registration forms in Missouri telling him as\nmuch. And those are in the joint appendix at pages\n16 -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But those were under\nMissouri law, not under the Federal statute.\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: They were -- they were\nunder Missouri law, but the important point for SORNA\npurposes is that he knew he had a registration\nrequirement. He doesn't have to know what law it arises\nunder. And, again, the sex offender registries that\npre-existed SORNA are the exact same sex offender\nregistries that SORNA is using.\nSORNA was enacted in 2006. It wasn't\nstarting over; it wasn't starting from scratch. It\nwanted to build on the previous regime. It wanted to\nfix it and make it better and fill in gaps and fill in\nloopholes and stitch all of the State systems -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And providing\ncriminal penalties that weren't always there.\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: Well, the criminal\npenalties -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's a big change.\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: The criminal penalties -\nthe Federal felony criminal penalties were not there\nbefore. Wetterling did have a misdemeanor penalty, and\na number of States did have penalties. But, again, the\ncriminal penalty is distinct from the registration\nrequirement, which is what we actually are looking at\nand what we're interpreting, the registration\nrequirement, violation of which can result in criminal\npenalties in certain circumstances. But, again,\nCongress provided additional protections for those\ncircumstances. The registration requirements themselves\nnot only apply to sex offenders and tell sex offenders\nwhat they're required to do; it also tells States and\nother jurisdictions what they're required to do if they\nwant to -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your theory -\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: -- actually implement.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your theory of what\nthe Attorney General did here, as you put in your -- I\nforget what, the regulations or the -- was confirm the\napplicability of SORNA, right?\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: Our -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's the word you\nused, I think, on page 12 of your brief.\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: We did. One of the\nthings he did was confirm. In the interim rule, the\nAttorney General, in the preamble section, read the\nstatute exactly as -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: -- as we read the\nstatute.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is the other\nexample -- do you have any other example where an\nAttorney General confirms the applicability of a\ncriminal law?\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: I don't know if I would\nsay \"confirm.\" There certainly are other examples where\nthe Attorney General has had authority and exercised\nauthority to define certain aspects of criminal law.\nTouby is one example of such a case. And I think -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, that's\ndifferent. I mean, if you're talking about defining\nwhich drugs are qualified, you know, under provisions\nthat criminalize possession, things like that. That's\nis clarification going forward. I'm talking about\nstraightforward confirming, which is what you say\nhappened here.\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: Oh, well -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You know, the law\nsays this, and I -- I think it means -- I think it means\nwhat -- what you say it means.\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: I mean, I think there are\na number of examples where, for example, agencies do\nlittle more than restate what the statute says. I think\nthat this Court doesn't give deference in those\ncircumstances, but it's certainly within the scope of\nthe general authority of an agency or the Attorney\nGeneral in this case to reiterate the statute's\nrequirement.\nThe Attorney General went -- went a step\nfurther in the interim rule in that what the Attorney\nGeneral said in the preamble is: I read the statute as\nwritten. I think it applies facially to all sex\noffenders regardless of the date of conviction, but I\nunderstand the defendants are making an argument to the\ncontrary. And in an abundance of caution, to foreclose\nthat argument to the extent I need to do something under\nsubsection (d), I'm doing it now, and I'm saying that,\nyes, it applies to all pre-enactment and\npre-implementation offenders. And I think -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, I get back to my\nquestion, which -- what's your best example of an\nAttorney General doing something like that?\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: Confirming? I don't know\nif I have one in a criminal context exactly, but I think\nthe point maybe that Your Honor is getting at -- you can\ncertainly correct me if I'm wrong -- might be a point\nthat you made earlier. It certainly is somewhat unusual\ndelegation of authority to the Attorney General. If\nCongress had wanted the Attorney General to decide\nwhether or not the registration requirements at the very\ncore of this statute had any operative effect going\nforward, presumably it would have told the Attorney\nGeneral that he needed to do something.\nThat's something that Congress did in many\nother provisions of SORNA where Congress said the\nAttorney General shall do something. In fact, more than\na dozen provisions -- Congress used that language to\ndirect the Attorney General to take a certain action.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, here it says\n\"shall.\" It says, \"The Attorney General shall have the\nauthority to specify the applicability of the\nrequirements of this subsection.\"\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: But it says \"shall have\nthe authority.\" And I think there's a significant\ndifference between \"shall specify\" and \"shall have the\nauthority to specify.\" The latter is a passive\ndelegation of authority; it's a permissive delegation.\nIt suggests that Congress did not think that the\nAttorney General had to do something for the statute to\napply as written. It suggests that the statute applied\non day one to all pre-enactment and pre-implementation\noffenders as all the other subsections that set forth\nthe registration requirements suggest, but if the\nAttorney General in the future sees a need to specify\nthe applicability going forward, then he has the\nauthority to do that. Not that he -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But the question -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're starting from a\nproposition, counsel, it seems to me, that Congress\nnecessarily and under all circumstances thought that it\nhad to include pre-SORNA convictions. But I don't\nknow -- yes, it wanted a uniform system, but it had\nState systems in place; it had an imperfect Wetterling\nAct in place. It had lots of other mechanisms in place\nto punish non-registrants.\nSo, you're starting from the proposition\nthat, by necessity, they wanted to include preconviction\nfelonies. But I guess for those of us who believe in\nlegislative history, and I know many of my colleagues\ndon't believe in it or pay attention to it, there were\ntwo bills passed on SORNA, one a House bill that made it\nvery clear, explicitly clear, that it applied to\npre-SORNA conviction felons; and the Senate bill which\nunder the label Retroactivity had the terms that (d) now\nhas.\nDoesn't that suggest to us that Congress\nitself was unsure of whether it wanted to include the\npre-SORNA convictions or not?\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: I don't think so, and for\ntwo reasons. First, to address the bills themselves, I\ndon't think the Senate bill, just like I don't think\nsubsection (d) means that Congress meant to apply the\nregistration requirements to all pre-enactment offenders\nin the registration provisions and then take away that\napplication in the specify the applicability provision.\nIn the Senate bill that you're talking\nabout, it defined a sex offender as anybody who has been\nconvicted of a sex offense. And as this Court said in\nCarr, that's the language that Congress quite often uses\nwhen it intends to include pre-enactment conduct.\nSo, I think the verb choice, both in the\nSenate bill, in the House bill, and in the bill that was\nactually enacted, indicates that it did intend to\ninclude pre-enactment offenders.\nThe other point I'd want to make is, again,\nanother point that was made in Carr, which is that the\nregistration requirements stand at the very center of\nCongress's efforts to find and to register the 100,000\nmissing sex offenders that had fallen off the registry\nrolls under the previous regime.\nSo, I think it is quite clear with respect\nto SORNA that Congress did want to include pre-enactment\noffenders. It wanted to not only find those missing sex\noffenders; it wanted to make sure that they got back on\nthe registry rolls. And as far as the hundreds of\nthousand offenders that were already on the registry\nrolls when SORNA was enacted, they wanted to make sure\nthat they stayed on the registry rolls, that they kept\nthe information current, they continued to update their\ninformation going forward.\nAnd, again, with respect to pre-enactment\noffenders that were in prison at the time that SORNA was\nenacted, it wanted to make sure to get them on the\nregistry rolls before they left prison, before they\nentered the community.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I guess my problem is\nthat you make an assumption, you continue to make an\nassumption that if the Attorney General hadn't acted -\nthat the Attorney General was incapable of acting\nquickly.\nI mean, if the Attorney General had, within\na few months, done what he ultimately did a year later\nor whatever time period after, had come out and said it\napplies; this is what you do; briefly, you register\nwherever you were convicted or -- et cetera, if you move\nor change your name -- then Congress would have\naccomplished the goal it wanted.\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: If the -- if Congress had\nwanted the Attorney General to act and to act quickly,\npresumably Congress would have told the Attorney General\nthat he had to do something. Again, that's something\nCongress did in many other provisions of SORNA.\nCongress wasn't shy about -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, why did -- the\nAttorney General did try to act very swiftly, and if the\nAttorney General thought that SORNA applied from day\none, why did the Attorney General try to rush through\nregulation that said nothing more than SORNA applies?\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: Because when the Attorney\nGeneral issued the interim rule, what he said was that\nreading it on the face, I do think it applies to\neverybody, but I recognize the defendants are making an\nalternative argument. And I think it's incredibly\nimportant that it apply to everybody, and that it apply\nto everyone quickly, because we're talking about\nprotecting our communities; we're talking about\nprotecting the public and protecting our children from\nsex offenders. And having this uncertainty out there is\n-- is not only not good for protecting the public, but\nit's not good for sex offenders; it's not good for\njurisdictions that are trying to work towards\nsubstantial implementation of SORNA.\nAnd so, I think you could look at it one of\ntwo ways. If the idea is, well, Congress left it to the\nAttorney General, but the Attorney General could have\nacted very quickly, I think that suggests that there\nprobably wasn't that much for the Attorney General to do\nin the first place, and there's little reason that\nCongress would not have made that decision on its own.\nTo the extent you think there was a whole\nbunch of things for the Attorney General to do, which,\nagain, we disagree with, presumably that's something\nthat would take some time. And during the interim,\nperiod those 100,000 sex offenders would remain missing;\nadditional sex offenders would be added to that number;\nand the community and the public would continue to be at\nrisk going forward.\nIf there -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if -- what if\nwe think the reason Congress left it to the Attorney\nGeneral is because they just didn't want to decide? Or\nsome people were saying this is fine but not\nretroactive, and others were saying it should be\nretroactive. Do you see any constitutional issues with\nCongress delegating that authority to the Attorney\nGeneral, the authority to make a criminal statute\napplicable on a retroactive basis?\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: We don't see any\nconstitutional difficulty with it. Of course, we don't\nthink that's what Congress did. But we do -- we do\nthink that the notion that Congress would delegate such\na fundamental issue to the Attorney General in such\nsubtle and opaque terms that the Attorney General didn't\nthink he needed to do anything is quite significant when\nyou look to see what -- what Congress was intending.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, it would\nstrengthen your case if you would at least acknowledge\nthat it would be constitutionally doubtful. You\nwouldn't have to say it's bad, but if you said it's\ndoubtful -\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: That is -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- it would strengthen your\ncase, wouldn't it?\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: That -- that might\nstrengthen our case here -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But it would also work\nagainst your own interpretation, because your own\ninterpretation allows you to exempt anybody that you\nwant from the statute; isn't that right?\nMS. ARBUS SHERRY: It does, but we do think\nthere's a different starting point, and the difference\nin starting point is a fundamental difference, as Your\nHonor noted. Our argument looks like a lot like\nprosecutorial discretion; whereas, the other starting\npoint is that Congress decided nothing and left it all\nto the Attorney General.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMs. Cain, you have 3 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CANDACE CAIN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. CAIN: I'd like to address one point the\nGovernment made, that there's no need to re-register -\nsomeone in Mr. Reynolds's position -- once they've been\nregistered under State law. They acknowledge the\nopposite themselves in footnote 12, where they say\nthat -- that a government or a State will have been\ndeemed to substantially implement SORNA if it registers\npre-enactment and pre-implementation sex offenders who\nremain in the system as registrants, as well as other\npeople. So, it's clear that the Government\nbelieves that -- acknowledges that people who are\nalready registered must re-register under SORNA.\nThe most important thing is that this -- the\nSORNA statute -- the obligation under SORNA begins with\ninitial registration and does not begin with a State\nregistration. And enactment -- Congress knew that\ncertain people would be unable to register under\nsubsection (b), and that is why they enacted subsection\n(d).\nWe ask the Court to remand to the district\ncourt and to allow Mr. Reynolds to pursue his claim.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
