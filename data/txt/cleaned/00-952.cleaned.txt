CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument
first this morning in Number 00-952, the Wisconsin
Department of Health and Human Services v. Irene Blumer.
Ms. Flanagan.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN M. FLANAGAN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. FLANAGAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
In 1988, Congress enacted the spousal
impoverishment protections of the Federal Medicaid Act, 42
U.S. Code section 1396r-5, to accomplish two competing
purposes. First, Congress sought to protect spouses
living at home from impoverishment when the other spouse
is institutionalized and requires long-term nursing home
care. Secondly, Congress sought to ensure that married
couples seeking medicaid bear a fair share of the cost of
such care.
This case concerns whether States have the
discretion to achieve those competing goals by taking into
account at the time medicaid eligibility is determined
available income which the nursing home spouse is
permitted to use after eligibility to support the at-home
spouse.
When the nursing home spouse applies for
medicaid, section 1396r-5 permits the community spouse to
retain certain income and resources to meet his own
monthly maintenance needs. The statute permits an
increase in the standard resource allowance, however, if
the at-home spouse can show at a fair hearing that the
allowance will be inadequate to provide him with income at
the State-protected level once the nursing home spouse
qualifies for medicaid.
When making this determination, Wisconsin, like
more than 30 other States, first considers whether income
available to the at-home spouse from the nursing home
spouse will be sufficient to ensure the protected level of
income once medicaid eligibility occurs. This method of
determining whether to increase or to substitute the
standard resource allowance is called the income-first
rule.
QUESTION: And what do the other States do?
MS. FLANAGAN: The remaining States use a
methodology called resource first, in which they look
first to the additional resources above the standard
resource allowance. These cases only arise where the
couple has resources above the standard allowance.
In this case --
QUESTION: It would be very helpful to me if,
right at this point, you pointed the statutory -- pointed
out the statutory provision that authorizes the State to
transfer income at this stage.
MS. FLANAGAN: The statutory provision, I think,
specifically is found in 42 U.S. Code 1396a(a)(17), which
deals with State standards for eligibility and the
Secretary's authority to set standards for determining
availability.
QUESTION: Do you have a handy reference in the
brief somewhere to the, where we can see that?
MS. FLANAGAN: It's in the Attorney -- the
Solicitor General's appendix at -- the first thing in
their appendix is the codified statute, 30 -- 1396r-5, the
one we are discussing primarily, and -- no, I'm sorry,
1396a is in -- the first thing in the Solicitor General's
appendix.
QUESTION: Page 1a?
MS. FLANAGAN: Yes, and (a)(17) --
QUESTION: That's 8a.
QUESTION: 8a?
QUESTION: It looks like 7 --
MS. FLANAGAN: Yes, Your Honor, it is. I'm
sorry. It is correct.
QUESTION: Then where in number (17) is the
language that you're answering Justice Stevens with?
MS. FLANAGAN: Okay, a(a)(17) provides that the
Secretary shall include reasonable standards, and then you
skip the one parenthetical, for determining eligibility
for and the extent of medical assistance under the State
plan, and then under (b), provide for taking into account
only such income and resources as are -- as determined in
accordance with standards prescribed by the Secretary
available to the applicant or recipient, et cetera.
QUESTION: Well, and let me ask you a question
on this point, if I may. There is a section, 5(b)(1), r-
5(b)(1) of section 1396 that says that pre-eligibility,
none of the income of the community spouse shall be deemed
available to the institutionalized spouse, right?
MS. FLANAGAN: That's right.
QUESTION: And you're talking now about post
eligibility?
MS. FLANAGAN: We're talking about a
determination made at the point of eligibility, but which
concerns income available post eligibility.
QUESTION: Well, it says pre-eligibility none of
the income of the community spouse shall be deemed
available to the institutionalized spouse.
MS. FLANAGAN: That's right. That's right.
QUESTION: And that provision wouldn't make
sense if income of the community spouse itself included
income of the institutionalized spouse.
MS. FLANAGAN: Well, I think, Your Honor, the --
QUESTION: Would it? It wouldn't make any
sense?
MS. FLANAGAN: I think you have to take into
account that you're talking about income being calculated
at different points in the temporal spectrum for different
purposes.
QUESTION: Well, you're -- you seem to be
arguing that the phrase, community spouse's income in
(c) -- in (e)(2)(c) includes income from the
institutionalized spouse --
MS. FLANAGAN: I think --
QUESTION: -- and yet it can't under that
section I read, I think. I don't understand how you get
there.
MS. FLANAGAN: No, that particular section
(b)(1) refers only to prohibiting income of the community
spouse from being deemed available to the nursing home --
QUESTION: Right, but Justice O'Connor's point
is undoubtedly correct that income of the community spouse
there means income of the community spouse alone, not any
attributed income from the institutionalized spouse,
right? Isn't that right? It has to mean only the income
of the community spouse.
MS. FLANAGAN: I think you have to look at --
QUESTION: In that section
MS. FLANAGAN: -- what's available at that
point.
QUESTION: I understand. Do you have any other
section in the act in which the phrase, income of the
community spouse, means not just the income of the
community spouse alone, but also income that has been
attributed from the institutionalized spouse?
MS. FLANAGAN: Under the definition of community
spouse, income maintenance allowance, I believe -- which
is under subsection (d)2(B) --
QUESTION: (d)2 what?
MS. FLANAGAN: (d)2(B), refers --
QUESTION: Can you tell us where in the SG's
appendix that is?
QUESTION: It's on 59a of your cert petition.
QUESTION: 18a?
QUESTION: 59a.
MS. FLANAGAN: At any rate, that particular
section refers to monthly income otherwise available to
the community spouse, and the -- our position is that this
evidences a recognition of the fact, as medicaid has long
recognized, that spouses are required to support one
another, and that this is a background rule.
QUESTION: Ms. Flanagan, it might help if -- I
think one of the main features of this legislation was
that income from the community spouse was never to be
attributed to the institutionalized spouse, but vice
versa, there is no such prohibition.
MS. FLANAGAN: That's right, and that's --
QUESTION: None of this makes sense unless you
appreciate that that was an absolute prohibition. Now,
tell us where that is in this statute, that says, income
from the community spouse is not to be attributed to the
institutionalized spouse.
MS. FLANAGAN: It's in subsection (b)(1), 1396r-
5(b)(1), and that was referred to --
QUESTION: That was the section I read to you --
MS. FLANAGAN: Right.
QUESTION: -- in my question.
MS. FLANAGAN: Yes.
QUESTION: Could I have an answer to my
question? The section you just referred me to is still
not another section other than the one at issue here in
which the simple phrase, income of the community spouse,
is used in a sense that means the community spouse's own
income plus any income attributed to the community spouse
from the institutionalized spouse.
You say that that's the way it's used in the
provision at issue here. My question is, where else in
the entire statute is it used in that fashion?
MS. FLANAGAN: I don't believe it's used
anywhere else. That's why the difficulty in this case
arose, is to try to figure out what that means.
QUESTION: Well, no, I think that rather solves
the difficulty, frankly.
MS. FLANAGAN: I --
QUESTION: I would normally think that income of
the community spouse means income of the community spouse,
and you say it means no, the community spouse's income
plus attributed income. I don't know anywhere else in the
statute that it's used in that fashion, just in this one
section where you say we should interpret it that way.
There are other sections where it clearly means only the
community spouse's income.
MS. FLANAGAN: With respect, Your Honor, the
medicaid statute has long considered available income as
part of the income of the person to which it's referring,
and we --
QUESTION: I mean, where it does that, that's
all I'm asking for. If it's long done that, just give me
another section where income of the community spouse means
what you say it means here. The phrase is used a lot, I'm
sure.
MS. FLANAGAN: That particular phrase is not
used frequently in this statute. That's part of the
problem. It's only used --
QUESTION: And isn't it true that the situation
you're talking about we're deeming in the other direction,
where they deem the community spouse income to be
attributable to the institutionalized spouse, not vice
versa?
MS. FLANAGAN: Well, Your Honor, Justice
Stevens, the background rule which I referred to which
this Court clearly articulated in Gray Panthers case is
that spouses are expected to support one another. That's
a two-way street.
QUESTION: That was for purposes of determining
how much of the community spouse's income should be deemed
to belong to the institutionalized spouse.
MS. FLANAGAN: That's right. I'm just saying
that spousal support obligations are a two-way street, and
the Court clearly recognized that.
QUESTION: In this case, we have the unusual
circumstance where Congress sought to provide additional
protection to the community spouse to reverse the prior
deeming rule which permitted States to take income from
the community spouse and require it to be used for the
cost of care.
In this case, in the spousal impoverishment
provisions and this provision specifically, Congress is
trying to protect the community spouse by making available
to the at-home spouse income that is specifically
contemplated to be made available as soon as eligibility
occurs.
QUESTION: But it is clear, is it not, that the
resource-first rule gives greater protection to the
community spouse than the income-first rule?
MS. FLANAGAN: The result is that it permits
the -- in general it frequently permits the at-home spouse
to retain a greater share of the couple's joint resources
than would be the case under the State-defined standard
resource allowance, and in that sense, yes, that's
definitely correct.
QUESTION: Ms. Flanagan, am I right in thinking
that the, neither the act we're talking about nor the SSI
actually define community spouse's income?
MS. FLANAGAN: No, it doesn't. That's the exact
problem in this case. There is no definition, and our
position is that community spouse's income means income
possessed by the community spouse, income that the spouse
has a right to, and income that is available to the spouse
at the particular point when it's being considered.
QUESTION: Was the income-first rule in
Wisconsin adopted by the legislature, or by a State
agency?
MS. FLANAGAN: It was initially adopted as a
matter of policy by the State agency immediately after
passage of the statute. Then in 1993 the legislature
amended the statute to have an express income-first
requirement.
QUESTION: So then your State court, I take it,
under prevailing Wisconsin rules, could not ignore the
legislature's determination unless it found that the
Federal statute was unambiguous.
MS. FLANAGAN: That -- well, that is what they
did, yes, Your Honor. They interpreted the Federal
statute as being unambiguous. They concluded that the
State law conflicted with the plain terms of the Federal
statute and therefore could not be enforced.
QUESTION: Ms. Flanagan, as I understand it,
there's a provision -- and these have been referred to
this morning, but there's a provision that forbids
attribution from the community spouse to the
institutionalized spouse, period, no qualifications on
that.
MS. FLANAGAN: During institutionalization.
QUESTION: That's right, yes.
There's also a provision which recognizes the
possibility of transferring income from the
institutionalized spouse to the community spouse after
eligibility has been determined, but does not require any
such transfer. It simply in effect says how you do it, is
that basically correct?
MS. FLANAGAN: It doesn't explicitly require the
transfer. There are, however, powerful incentives in the
statute to basically require them to do it.
QUESTION: But it doesn't, that latter provision
doesn't make any reference to the period before
eligibility, and I guess my question is, why don't we
infer some kind of a negative inference -- when the
provision refers totally to the post eligibility period,
why don't we find some negative implication that it was
not expected in the pre-eligibility period?
MS. FLANAGAN: Well, the fact is that the
calculation that the hearing officers ask to be made here
concerns the post eligibility period. The question is, is
the at-home spouse going to have sufficient income in the
post eligibility period, or does the resource allowance
need to be jacked up in order to provide that additional
income, so in that context, the hearing officer is looking
at the same period of time when the standard resource
allowance goes into effect, the same period of time when
the transfer provisions go into effect --
QUESTION: So basically the answer is, the fair
hearing has got to take place before eligibility is
determined, and that's in effect the answer to my
question.
MS. FLANAGAN: That's right. If the calculation
is looking ahead, if there are no --
QUESTION: Ms. -- I have one further question.
MS. FLANAGAN: Okay.
QUESTION: And if you can't give me an answer
right away, maybe you can when you come back. It's sort
of the flip side of the question I asked earlier. Do --
can you give us at least some other portions of the
statute where income of the institutionalized spouse is
clearly used to mean the institutionalized spouse's own
income plus -- plus income attributed to the
institutionalized spouse from the community spouse?
MS. FLANAGAN: Well, that really doesn't arise
because of subsection (b)(1), which expressly precludes
that.
QUESTION: Okay.
QUESTION: Thank you.
MS. FLANAGAN: Thank you, Your Honor.
QUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Flanagan. We'll hear
from you, Mr. Lamken.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. LAMKEN
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
QUESTION: Mr. Lamken, you've heard the
questions, and it is difficult, looking at the text of the
statute, to figure out what supports the petitioner's
view, although, as I understand it, that is also the view
of the Federal Government here. That income-first rule is
okay.
MR. LAMKEN: Yes, Your Honor. It's our --
QUESTION: Now, are there proposed regulations
of HHS that would allow either resource-first or income-
first rules?
MR. LAMKEN: Yes, Your Honor. There's currently
a pending rulemaking before HHS, and the Secretary in the
notice of proposed rulemaking has determined that States
should be permitted to decide whether to use the income-
first methodology or the resource-first --
QUESTION: How far along is that process? When
is that going to be adopted?
MR. LAMKEN: The comment period closed on
November 6. There's been a little bit of a delay because
there's concern that many comments might have been
quarantined in the Brentwood facility. However, we are
hoping the Secretary can proceed and complete that process
with all due speed.
QUESTION: Can I ask what authority the
Secretary has to say that the statute is ambiguous, so it
can mean either one? We don't even let Federal agencies
do that under Chevron. I mean, we didn't say in Chevron
that a Federal agency can either say that a bubble means
this, or say that a bubble means the other, willy nilly.
We said, since it can mean one or the other, we'll go
along with whichever one the Federal agency says it means,
but here we have a Federal agency that says, we have
ambiguous language, so hey, do whatever you like. I mean,
it may be ambiguous, but surely it was intended to mean
one thing or the other. How can the Secretary come off
just telling the States, it's ambiguous, you know, do it
either way, we don't care?
MR. LAMKEN: Justice Scalia, I think the answer
comes in two parts. The first is, one doesn't have to
think that the statute means two different things at once
in order to accept the Secretary's view. Community
spouse's income can have a meaning, but there may be
different methodologies, all of which are reasonable, for
determining and calculating what is the community spouse's
income.
In addition, this Court has -- and the States
have liberties in order to decide to choose among those
reasonable methodologies, because under section 17 on page
8a of our, of the appendix to our brief they are to
establish reasonable methodologies consistent with the
Secretary's regulations.
In addition --
QUESTION: You could say that about every
ambiguity, I mean, that there are two different
methodologies. You could have said the same thing with
Chevron. Now, could the Secretary in Chevron have --
there are two different methodologies of deciding
what's -- what is it, point of emission, or -- point
source, yes, point source of emission.
MR. LAMKEN: In fact, Justice Scalia, this Court
has upheld precisely that type of regulation issued by the
Secretary. In a case called Batterton v. Francis, and
again in a case called Lukar v. Reed, in which you wrote
the opinion for the Court, when the statute did not
clearly preclude one methodology or another, the
Secretary, because the Secretary has quasi-legislative
authority to set standards in this area, may adopt
standards that permit variations from State to State.
In Batterton v. Francis, it was under AFDC, and
the question is, what was unemployment? Did it include
striking workers, or did it not, and the Secretary said,
States, you may determine that based on your own State
law. In Lukar v. Reed, the question was whether or not a
tort judgment would be considered income or resources.
The Secretary threw guidance to all the States that they
had the option of choosing it as income or resources
because both are reasonable.
This Court in Lukar v. Reed again held that
decision, so in this particular area, where States have
the principal responsibility of establishing standards,
the Secretary may establish the boundaries, the reasonable
boundaries within which those standards may be
established, but unless the, and so long as the standards
established by the State are not contradicted by the
statute, are not contradicted by the Secretary's
regulations, and are reasonable --
QUESTION: But Mr. Lamken, isn't this a little
different, because in this statute, if I understand it
correctly, there is express statutory authorization for
the resource-first method, whereas the income-first method
is drawn by inference from what you consider ambiguities?
MR. LAMKEN: No, Your Honor. I believe that
neither methodology is particularly compelled or expressly
authorized by the statute. The statute simply does not
speak to the issue of whether when a spouse, a community
spouse is going to have a shortfall in income you make
that up first by paying additional money to the person in
the nursing home so that she may support the spouse at
home, which is the income-first methodology, or whether
first you raise the resource allowance so that she may --
so that the person at home has additional income from
resources.
I think I should probably go back and answer
Justice O'Connor's and Justice Scalia's question about the
meaning of community spouse's income in section (b)(1),
because there has been a suggestion about necessarily
includes only the income paid directly to the community
spouse. It is in our view a subtle legal tradition that
the community spouse's income, or one spouse's income may
include income from another spouse that is deemed to be
income of the community spouse in contemplation of law,
and so in (b)(1) community spouse's income could include
income from the institutionalized spouse that the
institutionalized spouse can make available. That's
consistent with the presumption of spousal support, and
it's consistent with, for example, existing regulations
such as those in --
QUESTION: Would you go over that a little more
slowly for me?
MR. LAMKEN: I'm -- I apologize.
QUESTION: How do you read (b)(1) --
MR. LAMKEN: (b)(1) says --
QUESTION: -- to cover reverse deeming as well
as deeming?
MR. LAMKEN: Right. All it says is that income
of the community spouse shall be -- shall not be deemed
available to the institutionalized spouse.
QUESTION: Correct.
MR. LAMKEN: The inference to be drawn from that
is that there is no prohibition in deeming income of the
institutionalized spouse --
QUESTION: But even if there's no prohibition,
where is your authorization for doing this? That's what I
don't find in the statute.
MR. LAMKEN: Your Honor, it was -- it's a --
QUESTION: If you start from a background rule
with the name on the check as a background rule for the
whole SSI program, how can you change that rule without
authorization?
MR. LAMKEN: That's the mistake, Justice --
QUESTION: Pardon me?
MR. LAMKEN: That's the mistake, Justice
Stevens. You don't start with the presumption of the
name-on-the-check rule. You start from the presumption
that the income of one spouse may be deemed the income of
another spouse because the general rule is that spouses
may be expected to support --
QUESTION: Where in the statute does it say
that?
MR. LAMKEN: The statute doesn't but Congress
said it when it enacted the Medicaid Act in the first
instance, and that was the established rule under the
Secretary's policies at the time that this statute was
enacted. If you look at the Secretary's regulations that
existed when Congress enacted this, it said the income --
QUESTION: That was deeming, not reverse
deeming.
MR. LAMKEN: I'm sorry.
QUESTION: That was deeming, not reverse
deeming.
MR. LAMKEN: No, Your Honor. In fact, deeming
did occur -- reverse deeming did occur, or could occur
under the prior policies, particularly in section 209(b)
States. Now, in most situations -- well, first for post
eligibility determinations, States did set aside a certain
amount of money of the institutionalized spouse's income
for the support of the community spouse, and they treated
that money as unavailable to the spouse in the nursing
home so that it could be available to the spouse at home.
That is this situation which you have called reverse
deeming.
Second, even at the eligibility stage,
particularly in section 209(b) States, it would be
permissible to deem the income of the institutionalized
spouse to be income of the community spouse.
Now, it might not often come up, but it would
come up when, for example, both were applicants, in which
case that would be permissible, so the settled background
principle that existed at the time Congress acted is that
spouses support each other mutually, and Congress
eliminated one of those presumptions on a going forward
basis in (b)(1) and said, no, the community spouse's
income shall not be deemed available to institutionalized
spouses, but left in place the background principle that
an institutionalized spouse, if they have the funds, can
support the spouse --
QUESTION: You can leave that background
principle in place, and we can all concede that it's in
place, without thereby coming to the belief that when you
say income of the community spouse, you mean, income of
the community spouse plus whatever is deemed attributable
to the community spouse.
I mean, I don't contest the principle, but
don't -- that's just not a reasonable way to use language.
I agree it can be deemed, but you should say -- it would
have been very easy to say, income of the community spouse
including any attributed income.
MR. LAMKEN: Your Honor, it would be the
Secretary's -- or the regulations that existed at this
time, when they discussed what we count as your income, as
your applicant for SSI, for example, it said, we count as
your income your income plus income from other people, so
that it treated it as the individual's income, and that is
consistent with the background principle that each
spouse's income is income to the other spouse, and when
States may establish reasonable standards --
QUESTION: I'm sorry, what did it mean, income
from other people?
MR. LAMKEN: The --
QUESTION: Money given you by your children on a
regular basis, and things of that sort?
MR. LAMKEN: Well, actually attributed income,
Justice Scalia, actual income that's passed over you don't
need a deeming rule, because that's actually --
QUESTION: Right. Right. Right, you don't mean
that.
MR. LAMKEN: But for responsible individuals
there were categories, such as spouses, such as parents,
such as -- there is another category I can't remember the
name of, but where somebody had the responsibility for
supporting you, their income was deemed to be your income
for determining your eligibility.
QUESTION: But I take it the only thing that
you've got express in the record anywhere to indicate that
really is what Congress had in mind is the statement in
the legislative history that is quoted in the briefs that
refers to other income attributed, is that right? That's
the only thing in black and white.
MR. LAMKEN: That is the only thing in black and
white, other than the fact that the settled background
principles the Secretary operated under before the
enactment would treat the income of one spouse as
available to the other. It was not merely deeming from
the to community spouse to the institutionalized spouse,
but deeming in the other direction occurred.
QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Lamken.
Mr. Hagopian, we'll hear from you.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MITCHELL HAGOPIAN
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
QUESTION: Counsel, would you mind telling us
why it matters which rule is followed by a State, resource
first or income first, not just in an individual case, but
overall? Who saves what in terms of money if you do one
thing or the other?
MR. HAGOPIAN: Yes, Justice O'Connor. Under the
resource-first rule the applicant, the community spouse of
the applicant, of the institutionalized spouse, is the
person who gets the money, and they get the money in the
form of an expanded community spouse resource allowance
that then generates income that brings the monthly -- the
community spouse's actual income up to or as close to the
monthly need amount that's set by the State.
Under income first, the income is fictionally
imputed from the institutionalized spouse to the community
spouse, but it doesn't actually go to the community
spouse. That would not ever happen until after
eligibility had actually been determined.
So in the aggregate, the resource-first rule
allows community spouses who would not adequately be
protected by the formula community spouse resource
allowance, because that does not generate income up to the
monthly need amount and because they have no other income,
or not enough income to bring them up to that level, it
allows them to actually have resources that will generate
that income and protect them even after the
institutionalized spouse passes away.
QUESTION: Doesn't it also make possible the
payments, the actual payments start earlier? I mean, the
reason this was of such concern is that the
institutionalized spouse would not be eligible monthly for
checks, so that the immediate effect was she could pay
down more rapidly what was her excess resources before she
qualified. Isn't that the primary effect? It's that the
payments under medicaid start earlier?
MR. HAGOPIAN: Yes. If I understand your
question correctly, Justice Ginsburg, the income-first
rule requires that those assets be spent down. Is that
the answer to your question?
QUESTION: Yes, so that -- Justice O'Connor
asked you what the effect of --
MR. HAGOPIAN: Yes.
QUESTION: And I think the immediate effect of,
she starts to collect medicaid sooner and doesn't use the
spousal resources.
MR. HAGOPIAN: Oh, now I understand your
question. No, that's not true. Under income first, the
institutionalized spouse does not become eligible. Only
under resource first does the institutionalized spouse
become eligible, and then that allows the payments post
eligibility to actually occur to the community spouse.
QUESTION: Maybe I am not making myself clear.
I thought the principle of that is to the couple, of using
your resource rather than the income first -- resource
first, is that the institutionalized spouse, it pays down
quicker, and is therefore eligible for medicaid money
sooner. That's what your position achieves, is that not
so?
MR. HAGOPIAN: Yes, that's correct.
QUESTION: Yes.
QUESTION: But doesn't that assume your case and
not the more typical case, the more typical case, given
statistical projections, is that the husband will be the
institutionalized person, and so in the typical case it
will not work to the advantage of the couple?
MR. HAGOPIAN: Well, I would agree with you,
Justice Kennedy, that the typical case is statistically
that is the husband that goes into the nursing home first,
and we don't have that case here today, but I believe I
disagree with you as to the effect that this has. First
of all the sex of the spouses doesn't necessarily matter,
as is indicated by this case. It's possible for a male
spouse to be the community spouse and have exactly what
happened here happen.
QUESTION: Mr. -- I'm sorry. Are you finished
with that? I didn't want to cut off your answer.
MR. HAGOPIAN: I don't think I answered your
question, Justice Kennedy.
But the institutionalized spouse, if it is
the -- are you asking me whether, if the institutionalized
spouse has a higher income, that what happened here won't
happen? Is that the question, or --
QUESTION: Yes. I assume in many cases the
husband is the first to be hospitalized, and he is the one
with the greater income.
MR. HAGOPIAN: That's correct, so in many cases
the income first rule will have a worse effect when the
husband is the one that goes in first. Because his income
will be higher, there will be more income that will be
attributed to the community spouse in this pre-eligibility
determination, and that will prevent her from having
income of her own that would raise her to the minimum
monthly needs allowance. If resource-first was used in
that case, she would be able to retain assets that would
generate actual income to her that would meet the monthly
need allowance.
QUESTION: Mr. Hagopian --
QUESTION: Well, if States cannot follow this
income-first rule, maybe they would just respond by
reducing the minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance
and adjust it that way.
MR. HAGOPIAN: Yes.
QUESTION: Or adjust downward the resources
protectable for the community spouse.
MR. HAGOPIAN: Yes. Yes, Justice O'Connor, that
could happen. That is where the flexibility in the
spousal impoverishment provisions exists for the States.
QUESTION: How many States are using income
first?
MR. HAGOPIAN: We don't exactly know.
According, I believe, to the petition, the State estimated
that it's in the neighborhood of 30 to 35 States.
QUESTION: Of course, I suppose a really hard-
nosed State could do both, right, could use the income-
first rule plus adjust downward the other -- I mean, the
two don't go with each other.
MR. HAGOPIAN: That's correct.
QUESTION: You either adjust downward or use the
income first.
I have this question. You maintain that the
statute is not ambiguous, if they --
MR. HAGOPIAN: That's correct, Your Honor.
QUESTION: -- do it this way. What is your
burden if it is ambiguous? If it is ambiguous, do you
lose, do you acknowledge that you lose?
MR. HAGOPIAN: Oh, absolutely not, Justice
Scalia.
QUESTION: Do you think the ambiguity has to be
resolved, or can the Secretary just leave the ambiguity
floating out there?
MR. HAGOPIAN: Well, that's essentially what
they've decided to do in the proposed rule --
QUESTION: Right.
MR. HAGOPIAN: -- is to leave it floating. I
don't think that's the proper method to do it.
QUESTION: By proper, you mean lawful?
MR. HAGOPIAN: Lawful, that's correct.
QUESTION: They are not permitted to do that?
MR. HAGOPIAN: That's right. I agree, actually,
with the way you framed it in your questions to the
petitioner, and that is that it just is illogical to
assume that Congress, when they enacted this particular
protection, which we believe is a fail-safe protection for
those few couples who would not adequately be protected by
the formula resource allowance, that to have these two
wildly divergent interpretations spring from the exact
same language seems totally unreasonable.
QUESTION: Well, what did it do with a case like
Batterton v. Francis, then?
MR. HAGOPIAN: Well, Your Honor, I believe that
in a case like Batterton v. Francis, we have a different
set of rules here. First of all, I believe that was an
AFDC case.
QUESTION: Well, but you know, it's still the
general same ball park.
MR. HAGOPIAN: Well, we believe that the
enactment in the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of the
no-more-restrictive rule under SSI resolved that whole
issue for us, and that is that with 1396a(r), which is
found at the appendix to our brief -- it's the only page
in the appendix -- that the question is actually resolved
by the application of the SSI methodologies.
QUESTION: Well, you say the question is
resolved. Do you mean by that that the Secretary does not
have any discretion to decide that a State is free to
follow either (a) or (b)?
MR. HAGOPIAN: Yes, Your Honor.
QUESTION: And how does that follow?
MR. HAGOPIAN: Well, there's a couple of --
first of all, the authority that the Secretary has relied
on to issue its proposed rule and apparently from which
its authority to develop the rule at all is
1396a(a)(17)(B).
Now, it is our position initially that that --
that 1396a(a)(17) was actually superseded by operation of
1396r-5(a)(1).
QUESTION: This is very difficult to take in
aurally.
MR. HAGOPIAN: I believe that.
(Laughter.)
QUESTION: But go ahead anyway.
(Laughter.)
MR. HAGOPIAN: It's almost as difficult to say
it.
But the spousal impoverishment provisions, one
of the main things that they did was supersede the
authority that the State and the United States have relied
upon to issue the rule and to engage in this so-called
reverse deeming, so -- and at the same time that they
superseded that rule, they also enacted 1396a(r).
Now, this rule -- what this rule did, and this
rule was actually -- I want to back up. Another provision
of the spousal impoverishment enactment was 1396r-5(1)(C),
and this provision retained the SSI methodologies, or any
existing methodologies that were not specifically
overridden by the spousal impoverishment enactments.
Now, the one thing that was left untouched by
these spousal impoverishment provisions was the way that
income was determined for eligibility purposes. Now, that
brings us to 1396a(r), and that provision is the provision
of the Medicaid Act mandates that the SSI methodologies
apply to income and resource determinations for all the
eligibility groups that were relevant in these cases, and
that statute does allow States and HCFA, or CMS or the
Secretary to issue rules that deviate from those SSI
methodologies, but those rules, if they're going to do a
rule that deviates from that methodology, the rule has to
have the effect of making more people eligible for
medicaid, not fewer people, and this rule, the income-
first rule, fails that test.
What it does is -- because under the SSI
program, if the SSI methodologies were strictly applied,
the income of the two spouses is separated and is never
commingled, and so because under SSI this would not
happen, a rule which allows it to happen in medicaid is
considered to be no more restrictive and not -- I'm sorry,
more restrictive than the SSI methodologies, and is not
permitted by that statute.
QUESTION: May I ask you a question? I know a
case is easier if you don't look at the legislative
history, and so it's probably easier for my colleague than
for me.
(Laughter.)
QUESTION: But would you explain to me how you
interpret the parenthetical phrase that's quoted on page
18 of the Government's brief, and the -- it says taking
into account any other income attributable to the
community spouse. I find that kind of a puzzling
parenthetical. How do you read that?
MR. HAGOPIAN: Well, I've two responses to that,
Justice Stevens. First, within the spousal impoverishment
enactment, the term, attribute, or attributable is used in
two different fashions. When it's used in -- to describe
resources, it has the effect of commingling the resources
and pooling them. When it's used in conjunction with the
term, income, it has the effect of separating the income
between the two spouses.
So it's my initial position that income
attributable to the other -- other income attributable to
the community spouse merely confirms the way it was done
SSI statutes, and that is consistent with the way it is
done, where income is talked about at all, in the spousal
impoverishment provisions, and I think there is actually a
reason for that to be in there, and that is that it would
be possible in some cases for a community spouse to
attempt to get an expanded resource allowance by coming
into the hearing and saying, I have income, and it's in my
name right now.
Typical would be, maybe it's from employment,
and at this date when I'm trying to establish eligibility,
or my institutionalized spouse is trying to establish
eligibility, I have that income, but I don't believe you
should count that income to me because it's going to end
next month when my job ends.
So I think that is what they were talking about,
trying to foreclose that type of argument at a hearing,
and so I believe that the real effect of that
parenthetical phrase is to confirm the separate treatment
of the income. The reason it isn't in the statute and
it's in the legislative history is because the SSI mandate
under 1396(a)(R) accomplished that purpose precisely.
Every other part of that legislative history essentially
becomes 1396r-5(e)(2)(C). That phrase is missing.
QUESTION: In that particular provision, to
retain an adequate amount of resources, all that any other
income attributable to the community spouse need mean is
income attributable to him from sources other than
interest on his resources. I mean, that phrase could
include his actual wages, couldn't it?
MR. HAGOPIAN: The institutionalized spouse's
wages, or the --
QUESTION: The community spouse's wages.
MR. HAGOPIAN: Oh, yes, absolutely. It would --
I think it does.
QUESTION: I mean --
MR. HAGOPIAN: Yes, I believe that it does --
QUESTION: -- resource allowance is the
resources that provide income, which means, you know,
stocks or whatever, and all that phrase there may mean is
something, any other income attributable to him from
something other than his stocks.
MR. HAGOPIAN: Right.
QUESTION: Such as his wages, right?
MR. HAGOPIAN: Exactly.
QUESTION: You -- your argument in the event
that we find ambiguity I guess boils down simply to the
fact that for a variety of reasons it would frustrate the
congressional policy behind the act itself if we held
against you, and yet in a way, haven't you provided an
answer to that, a counter to that argument in your answer
to the question a few moments ago?
You said, and I think have to say, that if the
States lose on the particular issue before us here, the
States as a practical matter can get to the same kind of
rough dollar and sense results simply by adjusting the
amount of resources, that is the baseline amount for the
community spouse to retain and the amount of income which
is thought to be necessary for the community spouse to
live decently, so it almost seems as though it doesn't
very much matter, necessarily, to the enactment of
whatever policy Congress had, whether the flexibility
comes in income versus resource first, or whether it comes
in setting the allowances for income and assets. What's
your answer to that?
MR. HAGOPIAN: Well, I think that the answer to
that is that the resource-first allowance, resource-first
rule was placed in a provision that is what we call the
fail safe provision. This was a provision that was
supposed to be applicable to all the States and allow
those few couples -- and I want to stress that this is not
going to affect a lot of people.
A few couples would not be adequately protected
by those formula allowances, and so -- because the policy
of the statute was to defeat spousal impoverishment. That
was certainly one of the primary purposes behind it, and
the vast majority of cases the formula resource allowance
was going to adequately serve that interest, but in --
QUESTION: So you're saying this is kind of an
exceptional case kind of mechanism, regardless of how you
set income and resources.
MR. HAGOPIAN: Absolutely.
QUESTION: And as an exceptional case mechanism,
it's only going to work if it works the way you say, on a
resource-first basis?
MR. HAGOPIAN: That's right, and to stress the
exceptional case component of it, you have to remember how
you get one of these hearings. This is not an easy
matter. This is not something that s accomplished by the
local agency for every single applicant who walks through
the door. You have to have - know that you re in excess -
have resources in excess of this formula resource
allowance. You have to go to your local welfare office.
You have to apply for benefits knowing that your
application is going to be denied. You get denied, and
then you have to request a hearing, go to the hearing,
prove up the need with all sorts of mathematical
calculations for this.
This is not something that people -- the faint
of heart are going to be doing on purpose, so it is an
exceptional procedure.
QUESTION: Have you read the notice of the
proposed rulemaking?
MR. HAGOPIAN: Yes, I have, Justice Ginsburg.
QUESTION: And I suppose your argument is to the
effect that that's just not a permissible interpretation
of the statute?
MR. HAGOPIAN: Yes, that's certainly one of our
arguments against it. We also believe, though, that the
statutory authority that the Secretary is using for
promulgating it, which is 1396a(a)(17)(B) has been
superseded in spousal impoverishment, so the rule itself
is probably promulgated pursuant to invalid authority.
QUESTION: Do we owe any deference to the agency
here in its interpretation?
MR. HAGOPIAN: Well, because our position is
that the position they are taking is totally unreasonable,
no, you don't owe any deference to the agency.
QUESTION: Does the income-first rule mean that
at the end of the day less Federal money is spent on
medicaid care?
MR. HAGOPIAN: Not necessarily. In the
immediate -- the effect of denying an application based on
income first would at that moment prevent someone from
being eligible for medicaid, but -- and so therefore would
save Federal dollars, no question about that, but you have
to remember that the resources that the couple is required
to spend in order to become eligible, there's no
requirement that those resources be spent on the nursing
home, and so it's possible that those resources could be
spent for some other purpose, and then the person could
immediately become eligible for medicaid, you know, within
a short time after the initial application was denied.
And the important thing about that point is
that, if that happens, if those resources are gone, and
the income that's generated from them is gone, then when
you get to the post eligibility determination, the less of
the institutionalized spouse's income is going to be able
to be used to defray the cost to the medicaid program,
because more of it is going to have to be used to increase
the allowance to the institu -- or, the community spouse,
so in the short run it may be -- save the Federal
Government. In the long run, it does not.
QUESTION: Would you comment on one of the
questions I asked Mr. Lamken, whether the background rule
is the name-on-the-check rule, or as he puts it, the
better view is the background rule is one of deeming, and
so that we should start from the premise that it's okay to
treat one spouse's income as part of the other spouse.
MR. HAGOPIAN: Well, I beg to differ with Mr.
Lamken's presentation of the background rule. I don't
believe that there is any precedent for the reverse
deeming that he's talking about in any of the background
rules. The deeming that was permitted was strictly from
the nonapplicant spouse to the applicant spouse, and it
was for the purpose of denying that person eligibility.
The one rule he talked about where there was
some reverse deeming was, was also -- was a post
eligibility rule. Under the old rules pre-MCCA, the
nursing home spouse could allocate a small amount of money
to the community spouse, usually just enough to bring that
community spouse above the local welfare threshold so that
they wouldn't have to support that person on welfare, but
that was a post eligibility deeming, it was not an
eligibility, and in the SSI program, which is what -- we
believe where the methodologies occur that dictate how
income is to be determined, there is no deeming from the
applicant spouse back to the nonapplicant spouse.
QUESTION: Well, even under this program, as I
understand it, in the post eligibility determination
income can be transferred from the institutionalized
spouse to the community spouse.
MR. HAGOPIAN: Yes.
QUESTION: Yes.
QUESTION: I might ask one question. Examples
help a lot for me in these cases. I couldn't understand
them without them, and the amicus briefs were filled with
them, which was helpful, but the example I'm carrying
around in my head is that we have, say, a woman in an
institution who has about $200,000 or $300,000 in assets,
and maybe a small pension of $8,000 or $10,000, and her
husband's at home, and he has a pension coming in, maybe
of $10,000 to $12,000, and so he's lacking about $6,000 or
$7,000 or $8,000 or $9,000 or $10,000 to bring himself up
to the $24,000 level.
Now, if you're right, what we'll do is, we'll
take the $300,000 the wife has, and we give it to the
husband. It generates about, I don't know, $10,000,
$12,000, and eventually that $300,000 goes to the
children, and if you're right, she doesn't have to spend
it down, and if you're wrong, by the way, if that money
goes to the husband, later on, when her pension comes in,
and there's about 8 or $10,000 coming in, that money goes
right to the institution to pay for the health care. She
doesn't get to keep it. So that's one way.
Now, the other way is that she keeps -- she
spends down the $300,000. She has to spend down the
$300,000, maybe that money goes to the institution, maybe
it goes to fix the roof, but then when the income comes
in, it goes right to the husband.
So I don't know, you know, I mean, it's sort of
what -- the Government seems to think that it's better off
financially by making her spend the money down, but I
guess that depends on whether the alternative is to pay
the $300,000 to the doctors or pay it to get the roof
fixed, so when I end up thinking that, I haven't a clue.
(Laughter.)
QUESTION: And so therefore I'd say, well, if I
were writing this statute, I guess I'd leave it up to the
Secretary, and if the Secretary wants to leave it up to
the States, that's his business, so I look at the
language, and the language there seems not to solve the
problem, and -- okay, what's the response?
(Laughter.)
MR. HAGOPIAN: That was a question?
QUESTION: I was putting the thing because --
MR. HAGOPIAN: Yes, I --
QUESTION: -- I want you to see that at the
moment I think, well, I can't figure it out, but I'm
working with those examples, and since I can't, I say,
leave it up to the Secretary, leave it up to a State,
leave it up to somebody else, as long as the statute
allows that.
I wanted to expose that to you, because I want
you to have a chance to say no, you're wrong, your example
is wrong, your reasoning's wrong, everything's wrong, so
go ahead.
(Laughter.)
MR. HAGOPIAN: I concur with everything you just
said, Justice Breyer.
(Laughter.)
MR. HAGOPIAN: I think your first example was
the wrong one, the one that oddly enough is bad for me,
and that's because I think you're assuming that the
resources that are going to be protected for the care of
the spouse will be transferred on death to the children.
That's possible, but if the community spouse outlives the
nursing home spouse, that resource pool, because for
whatever reason there isn't an independent stream of
income available to that community spouse, it's going to
be that resource fund that creates the income stream for
that community spouse.
If it's protected, and not have to be spent down
to medicaid eligibility, that community spouse is much
more likely to retain it, not spend it on things that he
doesn't need in order to preserve that income stream so
that he can take care of himself, hopefully, not in a
nursing home but perhaps in some sort of noninstitutional
setting that he would prefer over that.
So that's my response to your question.
QUESTION: You make a big point of that. What
happens if you lose and the institutionalized spouse dies,
and that is a problem. I don't know why the Government
doesn't, as a matter of policy, make a pretty strong case,
but the -- I guess the response will be, well, you know,
everybody knows this.
Everybody, no matter how well-educated or badly
educated, or -- they all know, when they get that pension
choice, that if you either take it all for yourself, or
you say, when I die I want my spouse to get some, and
so -- they've all made that conscious choice, and if they
make it to protect the spouse, that's up to them, and they
probably will. I mean, that will be the response,
think, to that argument.
MR. HAGOPIAN: It would be. The problem, when
you -- my understanding -- I'm not a pension expert by any
means, but when you exercise an option that protects the
surviving spouse, you so deflate the value of the pension
that it's economically a poor decision to make.
QUESTION: I would have thought that your
response would be the statutory language requires the
result you're urging, but you don't make that argument,
apparently.
MR. HAGOPIAN: No, no, we do make that
argument --
QUESTION: Oh, you do --
MR. HAGOPIAN: -- Justice O'Connor.
QUESTION: Okay.
MR. HAGOPIAN: Yes. The statutory language
definitely does require --
QUESTION: I just didn't hear that in response
to the question.
(Laughter.)
MR. HAGOPIAN: Well, it was in the opening that
I didn't get a chance to make, so --
(Laughter.)
QUESTION: In your response to Justice Breyer,
isn't it so, or am I -- counsel, am I --
MR. HAGOPIAN: Pardon me.
QUESTION: -- wrong in thinking that under ERISA
there is a requirement to provide for the surviving
spouse, it isn't the option of the insured individual?
MR. HAGOPIAN: Well, I'm no expert on ERISA, but
I believe that there is a notice requirement and a sign-
off requirement in ERISA. If the community spouse does
sign off for her rights, then it doesn't necessarily
happen. It's not a mandated -- it can't be overcome by
activity by the surviving spouse.
QUESTION: But it's not the insured's election
in the first place. Of course, if the surviving -- if the
spouse wants to cooperate and says, I don't want
anything --
MR. HAGOPIAN: Right.
QUESTION: But it isn't the wageearner's
choice --
MR. HAGOPIAN: No.
QUESTION: -- to say, I don't want, usually her,
to be any part of it.
MR. HAGOPIAN: That's right, but I think those
decisions are made at a time when long-term care is not
necessarily in the immediate offing, and maybe -- usually
at age 65 or thereabouts, long before nursing home stays
may be inevitable, and so the couple is making an informed
choice about how best to maximize their income stream.
I mean, nobody is ready for nursing home stays,
and to plan for that, you know, based at the time that you
make your pension election would be counter to, I think,
human nature.
QUESTION: Mr. Hagopian, I want to come back to
the snippet from legislative history that is referred to
on page 18 of the Government's brief. I guess if you
believe that legislative history, then it would have to be
done the way the Government says it need only may be done.
I mean, if you believe the Government's interpretation of
that legislative history, it certainly doesn't say the
Secretary has the option. It either says what you think
it means, or it requires the Secretary to use the income-
first method, no?
MR. HAGOPIAN: I think I frankly agree with you,
Justice Scalia.
Thank you.
QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Hagopian.
Ms. Flanagan, you have 3 minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN M. FLANAGAN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. FLANAGAN: Thank you, Your Honor. I would
like to talk about the impact of what the resource-first
rule is. I think there have been questions on that.
The impact of the resource-first rule is to
devote limited medical assistance funds to couples who
have resources substantially above the Federal maximum set
levels and that, in turn, necessarily means, since we have
limited pots of income, that that deprives States of money
needed to serve --
QUESTION: Why is that? I mean, he just said on
that that -- and it certainly was in the briefs, that if
you say they have to spend down the $300,000, they're not
going to give it to the doctors in the institution.
They'll fix the roof, they'll pay off the mortgage,
they'll figure out one of 50 other things, so the State
will actually end up with less money, because they won't
get that $300,000 as a set-off and, moreover, they lose
the income coming in later as a set-off.
MS. FLANAGAN: Well, neither of us have any
statistics on that. I'm sure that people do pay off their
long-term financial obligations, but they also have to
pay for the nursing home, and that bill doesn't go away
every month, so if they're not eligible, they're going to
have to be providing for that in some way, so while the
statute doesn't force them to devote their resources to
that, there are powerful practical reasons why people are
going to do that.
Another part of the impact that I'm concerned
about is touched on by Mr. Hagopian, who says that States
can just lower their resource standards and lower their
income maintenance standards. Well, what that says is,
States, you should serve fewer people. You should serve
fewer elderly so that you can have the money to serve
people who happen to have resources in excess, and in many
cases substantially in excess of the standard resource
limits.
The Cleary case, which is cited in the briefs,
is a good example of that kind of potential situation.
That was a situation in which the nursing home spouse had
something in the neighborhood of a $1/4 million of excess
resources, but because of the income of the -- set-up of
the spouses it would have taken that -- those resources to
make up that income, even though that particular spouse,
as I recall, also would have had money.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Ms.
Flanagan. The case is submitted.
