JOHNSON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. JOHNSON: May it -- Mr. Chief Justice,\nmay it please the Court:\nIn this case -- it doesn't matter what my\nclient was convicted of in 1978, in the State of\nCalifornia. What's important for the Armed Career\nCriminal Act is what he's convicted of. And as we all\nknow, when you're -- to be convicted of a crime,\nelements have to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt or\nagreed to by a defendant after waiving his\nconstitutional rights.\nIn California, burglary -- unlawful entry as\ndefined by the Court in Taylor on what a generic\nburglary consists of, is not an element of California\nburglary. Any entry with the intent to commit a crime,\na theft, or a felony will do. A California jury is\nnever required to actually find unlawful entry in the\nTaylor sense.\nRegardless of the defendant's conduct, a\nCalifornia burglary conviction is not, by its elements,\nTaylor burglary for Armed Career Criminal Act.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You don't take issue, do\nyou, with the argument that in -- in determining what\nthe State law is you can take account not only of the\nwords of the statute, but how the State Supreme Court\ninterprets those words?\nMR. JOHNSON: I -- I don't take issue with\nthat, Your Honor. I think if the State's -- State\ncourts clearly state something is an element of a crime,\nI -- you know, I agree with that.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, the California Supreme\nCourt has said that an element of the burglary statute\nis the violation of some possessory interest. Now, I\nknow there is some disagreement between you and the\ngovernment about that. But assuming for the sake of\nargument that that is an element, one way for the\nCalifornia court to express that is to say simply, as it\nhas, that an element is the violation of the possessory\ninterest.\nAnother way of saying exactly the same thing\nwould be to say that the term \"enters\" under the\nCalifornia burglary statute means either breaking into a\nstructure or the violation of the possessory interest in\nsome other way.\nMR. JOHNSON: Okay.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Those are exactly\nequivalent. Now, if they were to say the latter, would\na conviction under this statute potentially qualify\nunder the Armed Career Criminal Act?\nMR. JOHNSON: Well, I don't believe it\nwould, because I don't believe possessory interest\nequates to Taylor definition.\nJUSTICE ALITO: No, but they -- they set out\nalternative elements, either breaking into the structure\nor the violation of the possessory interest in some\nother way.\nMR. JOHNSON: Well, if -- if the elements\nare shown, and if that's the definition, then yes. But\nI don't think California possessory interest is the same\nthing.\nJUSTICE ALITO: No, but they have said -- do\nyou dispute the fact that saying A, an element is the\nviolation of the possessory interest, and B, the\nelements are breaking or the violation of the possessory\ninterest in some other way, are exactly the same\nsubstantively?\nMR. JOHNSON: I -- I don't, Your Honor,\nbecause in the Taylor sense you have to have an --\nunlawful -- trespass, actually a trespass, or an\ninvasion of a person's -- well, unlawful trespass. In\nCalifornia you don't have to have a trespass. And as\nthe Court indicated in the Taylor decision, it talked\nabout shoplifting in the State of California. So is a\nshoplifter someone who should be subject to an Armed\nCareer Criminal Act enhancement?\nJUSTICE ALITO: I thought your argument was\nthat if the terms of the statute set out alternative\nways of satisfying an element, you have alternative\nelements in essence, that then, even if some of those\nalternatives don't fall within generic burglary, if one\ndoes, then a conviction under that statute potentially\ncan qualify.\nMR. JOHNSON: Well, I --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Isn't that -- do you not --\nMR. JOHNSON: -- I have no argument with\nthat.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Okay.\nMR. JOHNSON: That's the modified\ncategorical approach, I believe.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Alright. Now, what if the\nState Supreme Court says exactly the same thing? Your\nanswer to Justice Ginsburg was it doesn't matter whether\nthe elements are set out in the statute or whether they\nare defined by the State court.\nMR. JOHNSON: Well, I -- as I said, if -- if\nthe element is set forth and it's an element that meets\nthe definition of the generic definition in Taylor, then\nI agree with you. But I don't believe California\nburglary does that, because the entry with intent to\ncommit a crime is burglary in California.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, I'll ask the question\none more time. Is there a difference -- what the\nCalifornia court has said is that an element is the\nviolation of a possessory interest. Assuming for the\nsake of argument that is correct, that is a correct\nstatement of California law, is there any substantive\ndifference between saying that and saying the element is\nbreaking or, in the alternative, the violation of a\npossessory interest in some other way? Is there some\nsubstantive difference between those two things?\nMR. JOHNSON: Well, there may not be a\nsubstantive difference, but in California breaking is\nnot required at any time. It's not an element of the\ncrime.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Johnson, can I try what\nJustice Alito is getting at maybe in a slightly a\ndifferent way? And it's really the argument that the\nNinth Circuit made, which is that you can take any\nindivisible statute -- indivisible statute, and you can\nreimagine it as a statute with divisible elements, and\nJustice Alito gave one example of that. And the\nquestion that the Ninth Circuit says, is, once we've said\nthat we can look to Shepard documents when we have a\ndivisible statute, why not apply the same reasoning when\nwe have an indivisible statute, given that any\nindivisible statute can kind of be reframed in our heads\nas a divisible one?\nMR. JOHNSON: Well, because in -- in that\ncase, the jury -- if a statute is made where the\nquestion is, is a weapon involved, and you can commit\nthat with an ax, a gun, or a knife, but the element is\nweapon, the jury is only required to find weapon. And\nif gun is -- is the fact that needs to be shown for an\nactive -- predicate, you don't get there.\nAgain, you go back to the element, what's\nthe person convicted of. They'd be convicted of a\nweapon violation, not a gun violation. And so, I -- I\nsuggest it's the same thing here.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But I thought our cases\nheld that when you have a conviction for a weapons\nviolation, you can look to the Shepard materials to\ndecide whether, in fact, the weapon violation was a gun,\na knife or an ax, can't you? No?\nMR. JOHNSON: If the State's statute sets\noff those as an alternative element, I would agree with\nthat. If they are not set out in an alternative\nelement, then I don't think they are -- I think they are\na manner and means of committing the crime. I don't\nthink they are an element of the crime.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Or if -- you acknowledge if\nthe State supreme court says \"weapon\" could mean a -- a\ngun, a knife or a hatchet, that would -- that would\nsuffice, right? But if the supreme court doesn't say\nthat, we cannot imagine it?\nMR. JOHNSON: Well, I -- if it's spelled out\nas an element, I think you can, but if it's not an\nelement --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's not spelled out as an\nelement, but the State supreme court says, our statute\nsays weapon. Of course, a weapon could be a gun, a\nknife, or a hatchet, and then we look to the Shepard\ndocuments and we find that this conviction of a weapon\nviolation was in fact based on the possession of a gun.\nMR. JOHNSON: Again, I think it would go\nback to the element of -- of weapon --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The problem is there's no\nway. This is purely conceptual. A State supreme\ncourt that says the word \"weapon\" in the statute means\nknife, ax, or gun. Now, are those three ways of\ncommitting the crime? Or are they three crimes, each\nwith a separate element? That is -- we'd need not only\nSt. Thomas Aquinas, but I mean, we'd need those angels\ndancing on the head of a pin.\nThere is no difference that I can imagine.\nAnd therefore you are saying, look to the point of this\nstatute; it is not to look to the individual way in\nwhich it was committed, and therefore go to the statute\nto see whether you have a single crime or separate\ncrimes, okay? That's that's what I think your argument\nis.\nMR. JOHNSON: It -- it is.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Do you think I understand\nyour argument?\nMR. JOHNSON: I think you do.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Fine. If I understand your\nargument -- it's not as friendly a question as you might\nhope--\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- because what I want to\ndo next is say, why are we debating this point, because\nthe only difference I can see under the California\nstatute is shoplifting and even that one is sort of\ndebatable. And the very next clause of this statute\nsays \"or otherwise,\" \"or otherwise involves conduct that\npresents a serious potential risk of physical injury.\"\nSo, why not forget about this metaphysical point\nand say, look, even if you are totally right, you've\nstill got a statute that for 430,000 convictions and as far\nas we can tell there must have been fewer than 500 that\ninvolved shoplifting, so this is so much like burglary,\nthat whatever risks were presented by burglary are\nsurely present here. So let's forget the metaphysics\nand just go on to clause 2. Now, why hasn't anybody\ndone that? It's a mystery to me, because you haven't\nand they haven't. So why not?\nMR. JOHNSON: Well, it's not my burden to do\nthat. And -- I expected that question, but I think even\nunder -- under the residual clause we win the case.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why?\nMR. JOHNSON: Because in California a\nshoplifter is not -- but I would think --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no, no. But I mean,\nwhat I would do -- I've said this and nobody pays any\nattention. I think Justice Scalia's said it; nobody\npays any attention. I think Justice Posner said it. He\nsaid, look, under clause 2, these are really empirical\nquestions, is this dangerous or not. Let's do a little\nsampling and what we'll do is we'll sample the kinds of\npeople that this particular State statute X get\nconvicted under and where a whole lot of them are\ndangerous it's a dangerous statute; and where not, not.\nAnd so nobody's done that sampling, but we do have some\nnumbers here and the numbers here suggest that this is\nreally a burglary statute.\nMR. JOHNSON: Well, there's -- there's other\nways other than just shoplifting. There -- for example,\na mortgage broker going into a home with an invitation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, you could. I just\ndon't think there are that many people who burgle their\nown homes or who go into the home of somebody else with\nan invitation and then sneak into the cupboard and stay\novernight and burgle everything. I mean, there are some\nsuch, but --\nMR. JOHNSON: Doesn't it come back to the\ntest that this Court thought Congress meant when you\nmade the ruling in Taylor that we're not going to look\nto the manner and means of commission, we're going to\nlook at the elements --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no, no. It doesn't\nhave to do with that. It has to do with the crime and\nthe crime is the crime that the statute defines. And\nthe question is, is that crime otherwise -- present a\nserious potential risk of physical injury? And if 4,000\nmanifestations of that crime it does, and 3\nmanifestations of that crime it doesn't, you would say\nthe overall judgment here is this is a crime that does\npresent that dangerous risk. That's because in almost\nall cases it's there.\nMR. JOHNSON: Well, if the Taylor definition\n-- after the Court worked that through, I think the\nTaylor went with the categorical elements approach. I\nthink what you're talking, Your Honor, is -- is a\ndifferent approach.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. It's exactly pure\ncategorical. You have a crime in a statute. You don't\nknow how dangerous it is. It is not burglary, arson or\nexplosives. So to find out if it presents the same kind\nof danger you do a little empirical research. That's\nall I'm saying. It has nothing to do with categorical.\nMR. JOHNSON: But then why do we have the\n\"is burglary\" language and the other sentences? Don't\nthey get eaten up by that?\nJUSTICE BREYER: \"Is burglary or otherwise,\"\n\"or otherwise,\" \"burglary or otherwise,\" and the reason\nwe have \"or otherwise\" is because Congress does know\nthat the number of State statutes that are sort of like\nsomething, but not completely like something is in the\nthousands. And so that's why they put in \"or\notherwise.\"\nMR. JOHNSON: I think in this case one of\nthe -- one of the considerations that drives our\nargument is that if you get into that fact-finding mode\nof manner and means in order to establish an element\nthat is not in the State statute, which is in the case\nwe're looking at here, I think you got an Apprendi\nproblem, and I think under the Sixth Amendment my client\nshould have had a right to a jury trial and proof beyond\na reasonable doubt.\nHe went from a max 10 to a max of life and a\nmandatory min of 15 years, based on what I -- we contend\nis fact-finding in violation of Apprendi.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the Court were to\nsay, we now hold that the modified categorical approach\napplies to this statute and to these facts. Would the\nplea colloquy suffice to show that under the modified\ncategorical approach the defendant necessarily was\nconvicted of a crime that's equivalent to the generic\ncrime of burglary?\nMR. JOHNSON: Well, I think the breaking\nunder the -- under the California statute is a manner\nand means of committing the crime. It's not an element\nof the crime, because you don't have to --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But if he necessarily --\nMR. JOHNSON: -- do that.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- the defendant\nnecessarily was convicted of an offense that had the\nelements of a generic crime, if he necessarily was\nconvicted of that, would that suffice? And if it would,\ndoes the -- plea colloquy suffice to show that?\nMR. JOHNSON: That's kind of a two-part\nquestion.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It is a two-part question.\nI hope I can get an answer to each.\nMR. JOHNSON: Well, the first question is,\nbecause the breaking is not part of California\nrequirement, a jury's never required to find that as an\nelement. Nor does a judge when he's taking a plea have\nto -- to find that having taken place.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But if under the modified\ncategorical approach we -- we insist that in the\nparticular case before us the generic components of the\ncrime must necessarily have been found by the jury, and\nif we say that that's the rule, that's inconsistent with\nyour view of what the law ought to be?\nMR. JOHNSON: I think -- I think it would\nbe, because I think unless it -- unless it -- there are\nalternatives in the statute, some of which constitute\nthe generic crime and some of which don't, I don't think\nyou can use a modified categorical approach.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I think what you're saying\nis, it -- it could necessarily have been found by the\njury, but he would nevertheless not have been convicted\nof that particular crime.\nMR. JOHNSON: That's obviously a more --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The jury in finding him\nguilty of the generic offense could only have found that\nthis mode of committing the offense was what he used.\nNonetheless, he has not been convicted of using that\nmode; he has been convicted of the generic offense.\nIsn't that your point.\nMR. JOHNSON: Exactly true. Just like for\nan example would be in a plea bargain context the\nprosecutor charges a person with delivery of a\ncontrolled substance, maybe there is a problem with the\nsearch or something and they come up with a plea bargain\nof possession of a controlled substance. Are we going\nto 30 years later go back and say, well, the colloquy\nsays this person did do a delivery, so we are going to\npunish him as if he did?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But under the modified\ncategorical approach the whole point is that we do look\nto the plea colloquy.\nMR. JOHNSON: You look to the plea\ncolloquy --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course, which is why\nyou say you don't think the modified categorical\napproach should apply. But I'm saying suppose we say\nthat it does and we look at the plea colloquy. What do\nyou want us to conclude from that?\nMR. JOHNSON: Even if you say it does, it\nstill doesn't -- it's not an element of the crime.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you simplify that?\nCould you simplify that? What do you think the elements\nof -- just going back to what Justice Scalia said, as I\nunderstand your position the elements of a burglary in\nCalifornia law is being in a place with the intent to\ncommit a crime. Whether you got there with permission\nor without permission, unlawfully or not, is irrelevant.\nSo what you are saying is what he pled guilty to was\nbeing in that garage with the intent to commit a crime,\ncorrect?\nMR. JOHNSON: Yes. In California you --\njust entry with intent is all you need, with intent to\ncommit.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But the unlawfulness is\nnot necessary.\nMR. JOHNSON: It's not necessary and that's\nthe point --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No matter what he said,\nhe wasn't convicted of a generic crime because all he\nwas convicted of under California law was entering\nand --\nMR. JOHNSON: Exactly.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- with intent. That's\nyour point.\nMR. JOHNSON: And the manner and means of --\nof committing it isn't the point. It's what are you\nconvicted of. And again, I think unless the Court\ndecides to change that approach, I think we're going to\nhave an Apprendi problem.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But your argument comes back\nto how the elements are defined. It comes back -- so in\nyour view, what is critical is in a case of a broad\nstatute -- whether the statute simply sets out a broad\ncategory or whether it sets out lots of subcategories,\nthat's what your argument comes down to.\nIf the court says -- if the California\nlegislature or the California court says, the element is\nentry, period, that's one thing. If they say the\nelement is breaking or entering in some other way,\nthat's something entirely different. It all comes down\nto that, in your view.\nMR. JOHNSON: Well, it may -- it may come\ndown to what -- what the Court thinks California means\nby invasion of a possessory interest. But again, I just\n-- I don't see invasion of a possessory interest as the\nequivalent of Taylor entry.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because it's like the old\njoke. I mean, it's in the statute, you are looking back\nto see whether he was charged with possession of a gun,\nwhich is one word in the statute, or an ax, or a knife.\nThat's what we're looking for under the categorical --\nmodified categorical. But if all it says in the statute\nis weapon, even if the supreme court says it's a gun, a\nknife, or an ax, you still have nothing to look for.\nBecause the charge to the jury could have been, did he\nhave a gun, a knife, or an ax, and the answer to that\nquestion, when the jury comes back, would be yes. You\nsee?\nAll they have to say is yes. They don't\nhave to say which. And therefore, Apprendi would be\nviolated, in your view.\nMR. JOHNSON: That's correct. I think that\nsums it up.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, if that's your\nargument, then you're really asking for us to modify our\nprior cases. Because I thought it was clear, that if\nthe element -- if the statute requires -- if to qualify\nunder ACCA, you have to have a gun. And the statute\nsays that you have to have a weapon, and a weapon is\ndefined as a gun, a knife, or a hatchet, that would be\nokay. Is that wrong? Isn't that your -- don't you\nagree with that?\nMR. JOHNSON: If the predicate element is\nincluded in the -- in the statute or the decision, I\nagree with that. But again, I don't think I have to --\nJUSTICE ALITO: So your answer to\nJustice Breyer was not yes; it was no.\nMR. JOHNSON: Maybe I misunderstood the\nquestion. But I think the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You didn't.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Let's -- let's get back\nto this case. I think what you're saying about the plea\ncolloquy is, even if he had said to the judge, yes, I\nbroke and entered the Metro Mart, even if he had said\nthat, the conviction still would not be for burglary.\nMR. JOHNSON: The conviction is for just\nentry, and for the entry with intent, which again isn't\nhow this Court defined burglary in Taylor. And so --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And your principal\nargument isn't that -- is that what we've said in the\nmodified categorical cases is that you look to these\nShepard documents to help you define the element of the\noffense. So if you're not sure which offense the person\nhas been convicted of, you look to the Shepard documents\nto do that. But you don't look to the Shepard documents\nfor a different purpose, which is, we know what the\nelements of the offense are, but we want to know whether\nthis person also committed the generic offense.\nMR. JOHNSON: Yes. Yes. I agree with that.\nAnd -- but the government wants you to use the Shepard\ndocuments to go beyond that.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Yes, but -- here's, I\nguess, the rub, which is -- you know, I take the point\nthat what the Ninth Circuit has said does not seem very\ncategorical. It doesn't seem categorical, it doesn't\nseem modified categorical. But there is something a\nlittle bit insane about your position. I don't see --\nyou take the most populous State in the country and\neverybody who's convicted of burglary, in the most\npopulous State in the country, is not going to have\ncommitted an ACCA offense, even though, as Justice\nBreyer suggested, 98 percent of them really have.\nMR. JOHNSON: There's an -- there's an easy\nway to fix that. A State legislature can change their\nlaw, if they want to. The Congress can change the\napproach they want to take, and that would -- that would\nsolve that problem. But I don't think it's up to the\nCourt to change 22 years of jurisprudence to do that.\nCalifornia has known this for over 22 years. These\nproblems have been -- have been around and percolating,\nand the right to a jury on -- on issues of fact --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it's not\nCalifornia's problem, right? We're talking about\nFederal legislation and how that operates.\nMR. JOHNSON: I agree. So Congress can\namend the statute if they wish, as many members of the\nCourt have talked to the Court and asked the Court to\ndo. But in light of how I believe this Court interprets\nthe law, and the categorical approach, and the idea was\nthat using the modified categorical approach would only\napply in a narrow set of circumstances, the\nCalifornia -- or the Ninth Circuit's version is not a\nnarrow set of circumstances.\nArguably, it's just about any crime that\ncomes in -- later on, sometimes decades later, they're\ngoing to be doing fact-finding on issues, some of the\nparticipants might have passed away. I mean, all kinds\nof things like that. It's not fair to the -- to a\ndefendant under those circumstances that that kind of\nfact-finding is going to take place and result in the\negregious extra penalties he's looking at unless he has\na jury trial.\nThose aren't facts of the conviction. They\nare facts about the conviction. I think that's the\ndifference between the Ninth Circuit's approach and what\nall the other circuits have. I think the other circuits\nget it. They get the idea modified categorical should\nbe narrow.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There's -- there's\nprobably an obvious answer to this, but the Taylor\ndefinition of generic burglary is unlawful entry into or\nremaining in a building with intent to commit a crime.\nWhy doesn't this, the crime of which the defendant was\nconvicted, satisfy the remaining, the remaining in the\nbuilding with intent to commit a crime?\nMR. JOHNSON: Well, California burglary\nis -- I believe, in my reading of the case law, it's --\nthe -- the intent is formed as you enter the premises.\nAnd that's when the burglary's been committed. If --\nfor example, that's the way I read the case law.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That -- that intent would\ncontinue while the person remains in the building.\nMR. JOHNSON: Well, except the -- again, is\nit the intent in the generic sense, or is it the intent\nin the California sense? And I suggest there's a\ndifference, because again, I don't believe -- invading a\npossessory interest, I think that came up when someone\nwas convicted, or they tried to convict them of\nburglarizing their own home, and the person had a\npossessory interest so they said oh, you can't be guilty\nof that. I just -- I don't think possessory interest\nequates to the generic Taylor element.\nAnd I would like to reserve my time, if I\nmight.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Horwich.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN J. HORWICH\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. HORWICH: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nI would like to start maybe at a point in a\ncolloquy that my friend was having with Justice Breyer,\nwhich brought out the point that Petitioner's position\nhere is that there's a difference between alternative\nelements in State crimes and alternative means; and from\nthe point of view of a guilty plea, which is what we're\ndealing with here, I don't see how you're going to make\nthat sort of distinction.\nIt's an unworkable distinction, because,\nfrom -- from the point of view of the defendant pleading\nguilty, whether it's an alternative element or an\nalternative means, it's just an alternative way of\noffering the factual basis for the crime. And the\nsentencing court ought to look, as the Court, as this\nCourt said in Shepard, to the factual basis that's\noffered for pleading guilty.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But you're not -- but\nyou're not looking at the factual basis for the purpose\nof deciding the manner in which the defendant committed\nthe crime. You're looking to the factual basis or you\nlook to these other documents in order to decide which\ncrime it was that the offender committed.\nAnd the reason that you have to sometimes do\nthat is because there are many State statutes which\nunder a single section number list several different\ncrimes, where \"crime\" here does not refer to a thing\nthat happened at a particular day at a particular time,\nbut refers to the kind of thing that a statute defines;\ni.e., a general category.\nNow, every case that we've written it seems\nto me says that or is consistent with that. And that is\ncertainly consistent with the idea of the crimes being\nburglary, arson, explosives, or other dangerous crimes.\nSo the guilty plea is beside the point. It may just\nsay, guilty of 828 376 Section 42-BC, end of the matter.\nAnd we don't know which of those three\nthings: House, car, boat, which are there in that\nsection, was the crime committed. And he's saying\nthat's the end of that. And so he says, then, look,\nthis is a California State statute and it isn't divided\ninto three parts. It just has one part. And that one\npart is not the equivalent --\nMR. HORWICH: I think that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- of Federal burglary as\ndefined by Justice Blackmun and the Court in this case,\nend of matter, QED.\nMR. HORWICH: I -- I do think you've\naccurately described what Petitioner -- the dividing\nline the Petitioner would advocate is. But I would urge\nthe Court to look at the experience of the court of\nappeals with trying to apply that dividing line, and\nthat will reveal to the Court very clearly why it\nbecomes unworkable. Because we've got several courts of\nappeals -- as the Court's aware there's a division of\nauthority on this -- that have said, well, look, we want\nto look for statutes that are phrased in the disjunctive\nor that have these separately numbered subsection\nheadings or something.\nNow, setting aside whether that's really\nprincipled or not to focus on the text versus the\njudicial decision, let's accept for the sake of argument\nthat that's the line. The problem is that then the next\ncase that those courts confront, that applying that rule\nrigidly produces really strange results.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's exactly right. So\ntherefore, that was my question basically.\nMR. HORWICH: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And of course Congress knew\nthat there are hundreds or thousands of State statutes\nwith several different words and they -- you know,\ndifferent ways of getting at the same thing, and\ntherefore they wrote the next phrase of their Federal\nstatute, which is it's burglary, arson, explosives or\notherwise, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a\nserious potential risk of physical injury.\nAnd so if you have a slight variation on the\nburglary theme, it doesn't fit within generic burglary,\nbut it's pretty hard to imagine it wouldn't otherwise\npresent the same risks, at least if it's only a slight\nvariation.\nMR. HORWICH: Well, I -- the parties have\nnot briefed here and I wouldn't want to speculate\non what the Court would --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I know and that was my\nquestion. Why not?\nMR. HORWICH: Well, this case has been\nargued as -- because this is a conviction under\nCalifornia burglary, it's been argued under the -- the\npremise that it should be classified as generic\nburglary. But let me offer --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe -- maybe they haven't\nargued it because there's some serious constitutional\ndoubt about whether the statute which makes it a crime\nto engage in conduct which creates a serious risk of\nphysical injury is constitutional. That's such a vague\nstandard, you go to prison for 30 years if you engage in\nconduct, quote, \"that creates a serious risk of physical\ninjury.\" I'm not about to buy into that one.\nMR. HORWICH: That -- that's -- I understand\nYour Honor's view on that, on that subject.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Horwich --\nMR. HORWICH: If I can try to --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I'm going to ask you about\nan argument you did make.\nMR. HORWICH: Yes.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: As I understand your\nargument, your argument is not the Ninth Circuit's\nargument, because you very carefully distinguish what\nare what you call missing elements cases from this case.\nMR. HORWICH: Yes.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So do you reject the Ninth\nCircuit's view that the categorical approach should\napply even where there is a missing element, as you --\nas you call it?\nMR. HORWICH: Well, I want to be very\ncareful that we're talking about the same thing, when we\nsay \"missing element.\" And so maybe I can give -- give\nan example of what I think is a missing element case and\none to which we do not think the modified categorical\napproach can be applied.\nAnd -- and the good way to think about the\nexercise that we think a sentencing court should be\nengaged in here is to say, imagine there's a set of\nboxes on one side that correspond to the elements of the\ngeneric offense -- excuse me -- of the State offense,\nand then on the other side a set of boxes that\ncorrespond to the elements et of the generic offense.\nAnd the exercise is to go through the\nShepard materials and figure out what goes into those\nboxes or what went into those boxes on the State side to\nestablish a basis for the previous conviction. And then\nyou take whatever was put in those boxes, be it specific\nor general or whatever it is, and then see if those\nthings give you enough to fill in the elements of the\ngeneric offense.\nNow, in a case that we would call a missing\nelement case, let's take, for example, because we're\ntalking about burglary, let's talk about criminal\ntrespass. So criminal trespass let's assume is defined\nas the unlawful entry of a building or structure,\nperiod. And there's no provision that you have to have\nintent to commit a crime. Now, it doesn't matter what's\nin the Shepard materials for someone who pleads guilty\nto criminal trespass, because there's no way you're ever\ngoing to get something in one of those boxes about\nunlawful entry or structure that's going to let you fill\nin the generic box.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Let me give you a -- let me\ngive you a different kind of example. Let's suppose you\nhave a statute that's made it illegal to interfere with\na law enforcement investigation. And you're prosecuting\nsomebody, maybe the person is pleading, maybe he goes to\ntrial; it doesn't matter. The theory of the case is\nthat the defendant violated this statute, interference\nwith a law enforcement investigation, by assaulting a\npolice officer, okay? Is that a missing elements case\nor is that what you think is going on here, which is\njust -- it's just an overbroad statute?\nMR. HORWICH: Well, we would need to know --\nI guess I would need to know in your hypothetical\nwhat -- what we're trying to classify that conviction\nas, because --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: The conviction is\ninterference with a law enforcement investigation.\nThat's the statute. But interference with a law\nenforcement investigation can be done in extremely -- it\ncan be done in an extremely violent way, which would be\nan ACCA offense or not.\nMR. HORWICH: Well --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And it's overbroad. There\nare ACCA offenses in it, but there are also non-ACCA\noffenses in it.\nMR. HORWICH: Well, I'm sorry. I guess\nmy -- my -- my concern is -- is that I would need to\nknow what generic enumerated crime we're trying to fit\nthat into, because although perhaps that could be\nclassified under the residual clause --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Sure.\nMR. HORWICH: Well, that might raise a -- I\nthink that raises a different set of questions. I want\nto be clear that our argument here at this point is only\nthat the Court should accept this for purposes of\ndealing with the enumerated -- with enumerated offenses.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, why would there be any\ndifference between those two? Why would you take your\nargument differently from the residual clause than in\nthe enumerated crimes?\nMR. HORWICH: Well, I think because the way\nthis Court's residual clause jurisprudence has evolved, it\nrequires the Court to make some assessment of the degree\nof risk of some set of conduct that's not too much more\nserious than what the defendant engaged in, but not too\nmuch less serious and so I don't know what that\nreference point is. I mean, there's something of that,\nI think in -- in -- in Your Honor's disagreement with\nthe majority in the Sykes case, I think of, trying to\nfigure out what the right frame of reference to draw is.\nSo I think residual clause cases are a very\ndifficult context in which to -- to talk about\nhypotheticals here, and for that reason, I -- I would --\nI would -- I think it's more productive to try to assign\nthem to burglary or one of the other generic offenses.\nIf I can give an example --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Okay. Well, let me -- let's\ntalk about this case, then. I mean, I'm not sure I\nunderstand that quite. But let's talk about the\nburglary. Suppose that there was a State that just said\nentry. In other words, this State says unlawful entry\nand you say that's overbroad, but we're still in sort of\nthe same universe of an element. Suppose the State just\nsaid entry. Would we be in a missing element world or\nin an overbroad world?\nMR. HORWICH: If the State statute provided\nthat all entries qualified, which is what I understand\nyour hypothetical to be, then I think that probably\namounts to a missing elements situation, because -- and\nI'm taking the Court's test from Shepard here. The\nquestion is what did the defendant necessarily admit in\nthe plea colloquy. And there may be -- I want to be\nclear -- there may be any number of things that are in\nthe Shepard materials that are noted in the plea\ncolloquy, but if they are not offered as the legal basis\nfor the defendant's conviction, then they don't make it\ninto those boxes that I was talking about and they don't\nmake it into being a basis for the generic offense.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that's my problem,\nwhich is you say that, but how to define a missing\nelement from an alternative element is -- overbroad\nelement, doesn't make any sense to me. As I read the\nCalifornia statute, all it says is you have to enter a\nnumber of defined things with the intent to commit a\ncrime. It doesn't talk about whether the entry itself\nis unlawful. That's your colleague's -- your opponent's\nargument. But you're trying to read into the method of\nentering that it could be legal or illegal, and so you\nlook at the documents to add that.\nMR. HORWICH: Well, I don't think -- no, I\ndon't think we're trying to add that. I agree that\nif -- if -- if, for example, the California Supreme\nCourt's decision in Gauze had come out the other way and\nsaid, yep, it's your own home -- you know, so what. As\nlong as you're entering, the statute literally says\n\"entry,\" there's no -- there's nothing further we need\nto examine, then I agree this would be -- you could call\nit a missing element case.\nBut the problem with Petitioner's position\nabout California law is that that's not California law.\nPetitioner says -- I wrote this down, any -- he says,\n\"Any entry with intent to commit a crime will do.\" That\nis not true. You can enter your own house with the\nintent to commit a crime. That is not burglary in\nCalifornia. You can enter somebody else's house with\nthe intent to commit a crime and that's not burglary if\nthey know you intend to do that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: True. But what they said\nin Gauze is that the entry must invade a possessory\nright in a building. And that cuts in your favor,\nbecause that's not having different ways of committing a\ncrime, that's what the word in the statute means.\nMR. HORWICH: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. So now you're ahead.\nBut the difficulty I think is, as I understand it, that\ninvading a possessory interest includes -- includes\ngoing into a shop with an intent to steal something, a\nshoplifter. Now, you could go back to the Blackmun\nopinion and you can say, ah, that falls right within it,\nbecause generic burglary is defined in part there to\ninclude generic, an unprivileged remaining in the\nbuilding. And you say, you see, these are the same.\nWere it not for two facts. The first fact\nis in Shepard it seems as if the Court says shoplifting\nis not burglary. And then you look to the treatise that\nthey cite for that, which is LaFave, and LaFave makes\nthat even more clear. And says, no, when you talk about\nremaining, what we're thinking of is hiding in a bank\nand not going into what used to be Jordan Marsh and\nstaying overnight, or not even staying overnight, but\njust putting a few toothbrushes in there.\nMR. HORWICH: We certainly agree that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So that's where the problem\nis.\nMR. HORWICH: We absolutely agree that --\nthat the shoplifting basis for California burglary does\nnot correspond to generic burglary. But by the same\ntoken we also agree that the burglary of an automobile\nversion of California burglary --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Ah. But now, once you\nconflate those you are back to Justice Sotomayor's\nproblem.\nMR. HORWICH: Well, I don't think we're\nback to -- I don't think we're back to -- I don't think\nwe're back to any real problem here, because the -- the\nCourt should not be seeking a rule here that turns on\nsome idiosyncrasy of how State law is phrased or\nannounced. The Court should be looking --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So how do you take that\nposition and advocate the answer you're giving here?\nBecause you are asking us to determine or to have courts\nbelow determine what are or are not definitions that the\njudiciary is applying to means versus mode, et cetera?\nMR. HORWICH: Well, we're not asking the\nCourt to draw any distinctions among those. I guess\nwhat -- what I'm saying is the government's test is --\nis that in applying the modified categorical approach to\na conviction entered upon a guilty plea, the Court\nshould be looking at what the -- what the legal basis\nfor the prior conviction was, which is, in the words of\nShepard, \"the matters\" -- \"the factual matters the\ndefendant necessarily admitted.\" That's -- that's what\nShepard says. And Shepard -- Shepard draws an\nanalogy --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Your approach creates its\nown idiosyncrasies. I mean, suppose the same plea\ncolloquy had taken place and the prosecutor, instead of\nsaying -- you know, the defendant broke and entered, he\nhad said, the defendant unlawfully entered, right?\nCompletely different result under your theory; isn't\nthat right?\nMR. HORWICH: Yes, it is a different result.\nBut let me explain why that is -- that's not actually\ngermane to the dispute that we're having here, because\nthe prosecutor equally could have said, he broke and\nentered one of the places enumerated in the statute.\nAnd that too would have been vague and that wouldn't\nhave allowed the sentencing court to classify it as\ngeneric burglary.\nThat -- the possibility that the Shepard\nrecords are insufficiently precise or they're too opaque\nor that they just don't exist because they've been lost\nis something that can frustrate the application of the\nmodified categorical approach regardless of whether we\nare talking about cars versus --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I think it's -- I think it's\na deeper problem than that, because the defendant is\nstanding there and he doesn't care at all whether the\nprosecutor says unlawfully entered or broke and entered.\nIt doesn't matter a whit to him. And so -- and so\nsomething is -- is --\nMR. HORWICH: But --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: -- the difference between an\nenhanced sentence and not an enhanced sentence that is\nnot likely to be thought about, let alone adjudicated.\nMR. HORWICH: Well, by the same token, the\ndefendant would not care a whit whether it really was a\ngrocery store or it was a car, because those two would\nalso cause him to be convicted of the same -- of the\nsame burglary offense under California. But they would\nlead to different results for classifying the prior\nconviction. The point --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The point would\nexpand -- this would expand the problem that you've\nidentified, that the Shepard approach, the existence of\nthe documents, how carefully they've been developed, it\nwould expand that fortuity to a far greater number of\ncases.\nMR. HORWICH: I guess I am not prepared to\nmake a confident prediction about the relative number of\ncases. It certainly would be more cases, but I think\nthat we would be expanding it that way in an effort to\nassure greater sentencing equity. It seems very strange\nto me that you could have had someone engage in exactly\nthe conduct the Petitioner did, but in another State,\ncome into court, have exactly the same guilty plea\ncolloquy, be convicted of that State's version of\nburglary, and then it does count, but it doesn't count\nin California. For some reason -- for a reason that it\nhas --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The -- I'm not sure\nthat it achieves greater sentencing equity when you have\ntwo defendants who have done exactly the same thing in\nCalifornia, and because of the fortuity of what the plea\ncolloquy looked like in one case as opposed to another,\nwhen it really didn't matter one way or another in that\nsituation, one person qualifies under ACCA and the other\ndoesn't.\nMR. HORWICH: That -- that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And presumably I\nagree that you don't have -- you don't have empirical\nevidence. But given how -- it does seem to me that it's\na broad expansion of the category of cases to which you\nwould apply the modified categorical approach under your\nposition.\nMR. HORWICH: Well, in part I'm not -- well,\nin part I'm not even sure of that. If I can return to\nthe experience of the courts of appeals in this and give\nsome examples where the courts of appeals that might\nhave preferred to stick to these rules about looking for\nthe word \"or\" in the statute or looking for separately\nnumbered subsections and then they confront cases like\nthe statutory rape example in our brief, where the State\nstatute of conviction provides that the victim of a\nstatutory rape has to be under the age of 18, but maybe\nthe generic offense says that the victim has to be under\nthe age of 16.\nNow, that element of age isn't phrased in\nthe disjunctive, but it seems very strange that if the\ndefendant admits to his victim being under -- age 14,\nthat we wouldn't recognize that.\nOr you have the situation in the Seventh\nCircuit, that just about a year after it decides the\nWoods case in which --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It seems strange to me at\nall. He hasn't been convicted of raping or having\nintercourse with somebody under -- under 14 or under 15.\nMR. HORWICH: Well, the question --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He's only been convicted of\nhaving that with someone under 18.\nMR. HORWICH: Well, let's imagine for the\nmoment that his case had been tried to a jury. Now, the\ninstructions might have said, do you find that the\nvictim is under the age 18 -- under the age of 18? But\nlet's for the sake of argument say that the instructions\n-- the instructions provided: Was the victim age -- do\nyou find that the victim was age 14?\nThose would be perfectly valid instructions,\nand if that was what the jury found then we would say in\nthe Taylor sense that that was what the jury was\nactually required to find.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not everything the jury\nfinds constitutes a conviction. They have to find\nsomething that is an element of the charged offense.\nMR. HORWICH: Well, the text --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If being -- being under 16\nis not -- or 14, whatever it is, is not an element of\nthe charged offense, I don't care what the jury finds.\nMR. HORWICH: Well, with respect, Your\nHonor, the text of the statute in this part of it does\nnot refer to elements. There is a part that refers to\nhas as an element the use of force or that sort of\nthing. But here the relevant text of the statute asks\nthe Court to determine does the defendant have a\nprevious conviction for a crime that is burglary. Here\nthe defendant has a previous conviction for breaking and\nentering a grocery store, that's the basis on which he\nwas convicted, and breaking and entering a grocery\nstore is generic burglary.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But breaking and\nentering -- in your brief as I understand it you are not\nrelying on the prosecutor's charge that there was\nbreaking and entering. You're relying entirely on the\nplea colloquy. And in this plea colloquy, the\nprosecutor said, he broke and entered a grocery store.\nHe says nothing. In the typical Rule 11 setting, when\nthe judge goes through the series of questions, the\njudge doesn't take the defendant's silence. The\ndefendant has to positively affirm. And here we have a\nplea colloquy where the prosecutor says something and\nthe defendant doesn't respond.\nWhy is that any kind of a necessary\nadmission when he said nothing, which he might have done\nunder the impression that it didn't matter because he\nhad the intent to commit a crime?\nMR. HORWICH: Well, the -- the defendant's\nstatement -- well, in the context of this plea, it is\ntrue that the words didn't come out of the defendant's\nmouth. Of course, at a proceeding like this one can\nfairly understand, as the Ninth Circuit has and other\ncircuits do, understand that those factual bases are\nadopted by the Court precisely because the defendant\ndoes not say anything contrary to -- and of course --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why should it be\ndifferent than in the Rule 11 colloquy? Why shouldn't\nthere be -- if -- if this is going to determine whether\nthere's a crime qualifying under ACCA, why should it be\nenough that the prosecutor said something? Why\nshouldn't the defendant have to say, yes, I broke and\nentered the grocery store?\nMR. HORWICH: Because we can treat --\nbecause we can treat the proceeding in this colloquy as\nthe defendant adopting that factual basis offered by the\nprosecutor, accepted by the court.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Qui tacet consentire\nvidetur. Why don't you quote the maxim?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. HORWICH: Because your Latin is better\nthan mine. But, I expect --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He who remains silent\nappears to consent.\nMR. HORWICH: Yes. This is at the most --\nthis is -- this of course is at -- at one of the most\nimportant moments in the criminal process here. This is\nessentially the defendant confessing his guilt and\naccepting punishment from the court. So it -- it seems\nthat it's fair to accept that when a basis is offered\nfor his conviction -- and he is silent --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: I guess it depends on\nwhether the basis has any relevance to the punishment\nhe's going to receive, which in this case it doesn't,\nbut put that aside.\nHere's one thing that strikes me as odd\nabout your position. You said before in response to a\nquestion -- you said if the California Supreme Court had\nnot decided Gauze, then you would not be up here arguing\nwhat you're arguing.\nMR. HORWICH: Well, at least if it was\ndifferent, yes.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Yes, if there were -- if\nthere were no unlawful entry that counted under\nCalifornia law --\nMR. HORWICH: Yes.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: -- but -- you know, the fact\nthat there is a strange Gauze case which says that you\ncan't burglarize your own home -- right -- the fact that\nthe Court happens to come across that case and happens\nto decide -- it seems completely irrelevant as to this\nmatter whether or not the California court once decided\nthat you can't burglarize your own home. What does that\nhave to do with anything in this case?\nMR. HORWICH: Here's -- here's the relevance\nof it. It's because at common law, of course, there was\na strict breaking requirement, and as this Court\nrecognized in Taylor, and in going back to the LaFave\ntreatise in -- in Taylor, that requirement had over the\nyears and into modern statutes been relaxed to include\nnot only strict breakings, but also entries by fraud,\nentries by threat and so forth.\nGauze -- and the reasoning in Gauze explains\nthat the California legislature's codification of\nburglary simply does that relaxation a little bit\nbetter, by adding essentially one more category of\nGauze -- taken with subsequent decisions about\nshoplifting and such -- explains California just did\nthat one better by adding another category, which is\nentries that exceed the implied consent to enter public\nplaces for lawful purposes.\nSo what you're left with here is, this case\nexists at the -- the common law core that both\nCalifornia and generic burglary retain, which is an\nentry by break -- an entry by breaking. And it is true\nthat both generic burglary is dispensed with that\nrequirement, in the sense that it allows other things to\nqualify, and so, too, California has dispensed with that\nrequirement, but it hasn't completely eliminated the\nrelevance entirely of the lawfulness of the entry.\nThere's still a question there. It's simply easier to\nsatisfy it --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Let me quickly ask you this\nthen, you say look at Gauze for this reason, it makes\nclear that in these words of the California statute,\nthere must be an interference with a possessory interest.\nNow, go back and read the Blackmun opinion, and it\nsays the element of generic burglary includes an\nunprivileged entry or remaining into a building. You\nsay now, between those two forms of words, there is\nvirtually no difference.\nMR. HORWICH: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The one possible difference\nis shoplifting.\nMR. HORWICH: Exactly.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And as to shoplifting, here\nis what I would like to say. This is you, okay? Not\nme.\nShoplifting just is not a factor under\nCalifornia code section 459. Now, you have not added\nthose last words; and therefore, I begin to think maybe\nit is a factor. And if it is a factor, then I'm afraid\nI'm then leaning in favor of saying there is a big\ndifference in the California statute in generic\nburglary.\nBut if you could tell me, no, there are\nother shoplifting statutes, this is never or hardly ever\nused for shoplifting, then maybe I would feel\ndifferently about it, and say, oh, it's close enough.\nMR. HORWICH: Well, I can't --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You see why I turn back to\nthe empirical question and keep wondering, why is it not\npossible to get, say, a law professor; they have spare\ntime -- get the sentencing committee, get someone to\nlook and see what are the real behaviors that are\nconvicted under section 459.\nMR. HORWICH: I can --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And then advise defendants\nwho -- who anticipate committing these crimes, so that\nthey will know which crimes carry another 30 years.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well --\nMR. HORWICH: Well -- Justice Breyer, I\ndon't think I can give you a statistical survey. The\nonly thing I can offer, and I offer it with some\nhesitation, is my conversations with California\nprosecutors suggest that they are, at least today,\ngenerally disinclined to charge shoplifting as burglary,\nbecause it's a lot easier, and effectively gets them the\nsame result in those cases, to charge it as larceny.\nNow --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that --\nMR. HORWICH: -- but that's -- that's\nanecdotal, at best. I don't have anything better.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- to charge it as what?\nWhat's shoplifting?\nMR. HORWICH: To charge it as larceny,\nbecause very often, it will be the completed shoplifting\nis very hard to prove they had the intent when they went\ninto the store.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it -- but it does\ncome under this section 459.\nMR. HORWICH: It does, but it -- in exactly\nthe same way that automobile burglaries come under this\nstatute. The statute is broader as to the place\nburgled, it's broader as to the types -- types of\nunlawfulness of entry.\nThat's not a reason not to recognize that\nwhen the defendant, as Petitioner did here, says my\ncrime was breaking and entering -- to recognize it as\nbreaking and entering, which is all we think Shepard\nasks for.\nAnd I want to be clear that you wouldn't go\nbeyond that. We're not saying that a defendant who's\npleading guilty to criminal trespass who says it was\nbreaking and entering and I intended to go steal\nsomething in there, you can't then call that burglary,\nbecause the additional admission to intent is not\ngermane to the conviction for criminal trespass. So you\ncan't use that and turn that into generic burglary.\nThat answers the hypothetical that was\nraised about someone who enters a plea bargain to\npossession of controlled substances instead of\ndistribution. That -- that answers a great many of the\nparade of horribles that Petitioner is offering. And\nthat's --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you tell me what\nthe difference is between entering the garage with\npermission and taking a wrench and walking out, and\nentering a store with permission and taking an article\nof clothing. Are they both shoplifting?\nMR. HORWICH: I -- if in your hypothetical\nthe garage is a -- is not your own garage and you don't\nhave the consent of the garage's owner to -- who knows\nthat you're going to take the wrench, no, they are the\nsame. Those are the same thing.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They are the same thing.\nSo in answer to Justice Breyer's question, you do admit\nthat under the California definition of burglary,\nshoplifting could be charged.\nMR. HORWICH: Shoplifting could be charged,\nand someone could plead guilty to shoplifting, and that\nwouldn't count. The problem here is that --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I think your adversary\ncan speak for himself, and his brief did point to some\nconvictions for shoplifting under the statute.\nMR. HORWICH: Yes, we agree.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There are some.\nMR. HORWICH: Absolutely. You can be\nconvicted of shoplifting. We don't disagree with that.\nBut what we're saying is that the approach that Taylor\nand Shepard suggests is one that focuses on what the\ndefendant necessarily admitted in offering the legal\nbasis for his conviction rather than on hypotheticals\nabout other conduct he might have committed that would\nhave resulted in the same conviction.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What seems to me perhaps\nclearest about this case and others is that this\nmodified categorical approach has turned out to be\nextremely complicated, and occasionally produces results\nthat seem to make no sense whatsoever. Was this\ninevitable? Is this really what Congress intended, or\ndid the Court create this problem by the way it has\ninterpreted ACCA?\nMR. HORWICH: If I may, briefly.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can.\nMR. HORWICH: My sense -- my sense is that\nthis problem is largely the product of lower courts\ntrying to draw very fine formalized\nangels-on-the-head-of-a-pin distinctions about the\nstatutes, rather than simply focusing on the conduct\nthat was necessarily admitted. And if they would do\nthat, I actually think this would go significantly more\nsmoothly.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Johnson, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAN B. JOHNSON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. JOHNSON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nOne thing I would like to point. There is a\nlot of discussion about shoplifting, as if that's one of\nthe only problem areas we have. On page 9 of our reply\nmemorandum, footnote 5 contains a number of examples of\nother -- California burglaries. And I don't -- it's\npage 9 of the reply memorandum, footnote 5.\nCalifornia burglary, it's -- those examples\nare just a few examples how burglary is consensual\nentry into homes. That is not an unprivileged entry,\nand it's not a trespass.\nI think -- I think that -- limiting it to\njust saying that -- that shoplifting is the only problem\nwe have, I don't believe that's the case.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Johnson, the last\nanswer by Mr. Horwich to the last question was, it would\nbe simpler if we hadn't done the modified categorical\napproach; but the reality is we have a statute. The\nactive statute that defines violent felony not with\nrespect to a felony that involved dangerous conduct, but\nas any crime punishable by imprisonment that has an\nelement that threatened use of physical force. So it's\nnot what the Court created, it's what the statute\ncreated.\nMR. JOHNSON: I agree with that, and I think\nthat -- I -- I don't think anything has changed in --\nsince -- in the last 22 years for the Court to step away\nfrom Taylor. In fact, I think the recent developments\nand constitutional law six memo rights to trials on\nfact-finding.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, does the offense of\nburglary have the element of using force or threatening\nto use of force?\nMR. JOHNSON: I don't believe it does. I\nthink the theory is that --\nJUSTICE ALITO: So the element doesn't --\nthe element language doesn't apply to burglary.\nMR. JOHNSON: I think it does.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you don't have to\nprove -- I mean, burglary is specifically named. It's\nnot -- it's not the residual --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Clause.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's not the residual.\nThe -- the use or threatened use of force is the\nresidual. If you're convicted of burglary, it doesn't\nmatter whether -- whether you threaten force, right?\nMR. JOHNSON: Well, again, I think if we get\ninto the residual, it's going to require the evaluations\nthe Court have done on that. But modified -- if you --\nif you look --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think only -- only\nthose burglaries that -- that threaten force are covered\nby the statute? Certainly not. It's all burglaries, as\nlong as you meet the generic definition of burglary,\nright?\nMR. JOHNSON: I agree with that. Unless\nthere's other questions, I'd yield the rest of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
