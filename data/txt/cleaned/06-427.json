MAHONEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIf this Court adheres to its State action\nruling, it should now hold that the TSSAA has broad\ndiscretion to adopt and to enforcement contractual\nrestrictions on athletic recruiting as a condition of\nmembership. Under this Court's cases, Brentwood cannot\nescape the contractual bargain it's made under the First\nAmendment, because the association offered it a\nreasonable choice as measured by the three criteria that\nthis Court has used to identify unconstitutional\nconditions.\nFirst, participation in the state\ntournaments is entirely voluntary. Second, the\nrestrictions at issue here are germane to the legitimate\ngoals of the association. And third, enforcement of the\nrule here imposed only a minimal burden on speech of\nprivate concerns.\nI would like to turn first to the issue of\nvoluntariness, because that's a core issue in every case\ninvolving allegedly unconstitutional conditions.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask you a\npreliminary question, Ms. Mahoney?\nAnd that is, we are told that at the time\nthis issue arose, the practice itself was all right, and\nit was all right for one school to invite students from\nanother school to join the invitee school's practice.\nAnd now I take it that it's no longer permissible, that\none school's, one school's practice, is reserved for its\nown students and not -- others are not invited. But if\nit was permissible under the association's rules to\ninvite students from other schools, then why is it\nimpermissible to talk it up? I mean, you can do it, but\nyou can't talk about it?\nMS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, actually the\nrecord indicates that it would be permissible to give\nthe information about the date for the spring practice\nto the students who had signed an enrollment contract.\nAnd that's at CAJA-705. It could have been sent in an\nenrollment packet, for instance. It could have been\nsent just as a schedule.\nBut instead the problem here was that it was\nsent from the coach in a personal solicitation to the\nstudents that really subtly pressured them to come to\npractice. This was a form of recruiting. Under\nquestion 3, which is the interpretive guidance for the\nrecruiting rule, it very expressly says that\ncoach-initiated contact with students who are enrolled\nat another school is not supposed to occur. And so this\nfell within the terms of the rule. As the Sixth Circuit\nsaid, it would strain credulity to say that Brentwood\ndidn't know that it shouldn't have sent this letter.\nAnd their own headmaster acknowledged that it certainly\nshould have been t kind of thing that they would have\ncalled about before doing it, and he was surprised that\nCoach Flatt had not done so.\nSo I think, Your Honor, that the first point\nis that, yes, this information could have been\ncommunicated to the students, but not in this way. And\ncertainly the association could recognize that this was\nstill a form of recruiting.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So in speech terms, there\nwere alternative means to get the message out.\nMS. MAHONEY: Absolutely. This was speech\nof private concern. It was about the time for football\npractice. And there were other ways that that\ninformation could be communicated. But the association\nhas an interest in having prophylactic rules that\nprevent coaches from initiating communications with\nstudents before they started school, because even though\nthey --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I think the briefs are --\nI think it's fair to characterize the Respondent's brief\nthis way, or fair to concentrate on Pickering. It seems\nto me that Pickering is the key here, and I took away\nthat impression from your brief.\nIf we said that it's commercial speech, I\nthink that's a little far off the mark. If we said it's\nan unconstitutional condition, I'm not sure that helps\neither side that much, either.\nMS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, I think Pickering\nis really an example of an unconstitutional conditions\nanalysis just in the employment context. What the Court\nreally says in a broad group of cases where the\ngovernment or the State actor is not exercising\nsovereign power, if it's offering a benefit, if it's\nusing funding to encourage activity, if it is engaging\nin a contractual relationship as it does in Umbehr, that\nwhat this court has said in Umbehr very explicitly is\nthat when the government uses contractual power the\nconstitutional concerns are not as great.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In Umbehr we said, the\nCourt said, that in the independent contractor cases the\ninterests of either party, the government or the\ncontractor, are not quite so intense as they are with a\npublic employee. I thought that made sense when I read\nit. I'm not so sure it does any more.\nMS. MAHONEY: Well, and in fact this Court\nsaid in Umbehr that, even though the interests were what\ndifferent, the standards that had been applied in\nConnick and Pickering could easily accommodate the\ncircumstances of dealing with --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I suppose we could\nconstruct a hypothetical where we could say there's a\nvery strong interest in the contractor. So I'm not sure\nthat that works as a general theorem.\nMS. MAHONEY: But I think that the key from\nall the cases, whether we look at Cornelius, which\ninvolves your access to the charitable campaign, or if\nwe look at or if we look at Lusk and American Library,\nwhich involved access to funding, or Grove, access to\nfunding, that the strain across these cases is that\nyou're really looking at is the restriction germane.\nWhat kind of a burden --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about if, what\nif the association had a rule that members, school\nofficials, shall not criticize the decisions of the\nassociation?\nMS. MAHONEY: I think then it would be --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's germane. In\nother words, you can criticize other things, but if\nyou're going to join this group we think it's important\nfor their public stature not to be criticized by\nmembers.\nMS. MAHONEY: I think that would probably be\nviewed as speech of public concern, and at that point\nunder Connick balancing you'd have --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There's no more\npublic concern about when spring practice is. If you\nthink there should be, you know, two playoff tiers\nrather than three and you criticize the association for\nthat and they say well, you're suspended for a year and\nall that.\nMS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, in Connick this\nCourt said that in assessing whether something is a\nissue of public concern you look at not just the topic,\nbut also the way in which that topic is discussed. And\nif what happened was the association decided that it was\ngoing to penalize a member or have a broad rule that\nsays it would tolerate no criticism and even if\nBrentwood had taken an ad out in the paper to talk about\nhow terrible the association's policies were, I think\nthis Court could readily find that that was not a\nreasonable choice because it would impact --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about\ncriticizing officials?\nMS. MAHONEY: On the field, Your Honor? I\nthink that the interests in essentially controlling that\nkind of speech would always outweigh the interests of an\nathlete or a coach in engaging in any kind of speech on\nthe field.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I mean three\ndays later, you know, the school -- the coach writes an\neditorial saying there were lousy calls in the game last\nweek.\nMS. MAHONEY: I think that would probably be\ntreated as speech of public concern, which would then\ngive rise to Connick balancing.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And how would you balance\nit?\nMS. MAHONEY: What Connick says is you look\nat how core is the speech, what's it about?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And how would you\ncommence?\nMS. MAHONEY: Probably find that that not be\na reasonable restriction, that it's probably not germane\nto the important educational goals of the association.\nBut it could -- I mean, I think that what we have here\nis the recruiting rule has been applied to speech that's\na private concern that can be delivered in another way;\nand the choice to join is entirely voluntary.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Ms. Mahoney, on that point,\ncan I just take you back to square one for a second?\nI'm with you in your explanation that the speech at\nissue here probably was fairly understood as being for,\nyou know, the communication here as being a violation of\nthe rule. Could you, though, tell me, would it have\nbeen -- I guess I have two questions.\nWould it have been a violation of the rule\nif the coach had sent the letter to eighth grade\nstudents in the school itself, those who were already\nformally enrolled and who might be going out for\nfootball the next fall? And number two, what is exactly\nthe interest in preventing recruiting, as you describe\nit, when the letters are aimed at people who have\nalready signed, I think you referred to it as, an\nenrollment contract? So there's every reason to believe\nthey're going to be in that school next year.\nWhat is the interest? And would that\ninterest have supported a ban on letters to the already\nenrolled eighth grade kids?\nMS. MAHONEY: First, I think that this\nletter, which was not sent to Brentwood's own eighth\ngrade middle school students, probably could have been,\nbecause under the rule those students were not enrolled\nat another school. And what is really restricted is\ncoach-initiated contact with students enrolled at\nanother school.\nThis letter was instead sent to student\nwhose were still enrolled at another school. And the\ninterest I would --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, so they had signed\nup to go to Brentwood. So where does the recruiting\ncome in?\nMS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, the contracts\nweren't binding. We have the contracts in the record at\nCAJA-1889. But more importantly, whether it was or not,\nthe record demonstrates that some student do sign\nmultiple contracts. Some students do not come. And so\nefforts to get, of the coach, to get them to come to\npractice, to be with him, to entice them, to give them\nhis personal home phone number, that's still a form of\nrecruiting.\nIn fact, one of the top basketball athletes\nin the eighth grade in the city of Nashville in the 1997\nwas named Jack West Curry. He signed one of these\ncontracts. He did not ultimately come to Brentwood.\nAnd yet he was exactly the kind of person that still\ncould have been subject to recruiting if during that\nperiod --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So it boils down to saying\nthat when they've signed the enrollment contract that's\nnot the end of the, in effect, the issue.\nMS. MAHONEY: No.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And there is a sensible\npractical way in which recruiting goes on even among\nthose who have signed up. Okay.\nMS. MAHONEY: It certainly could, and so\nthere's an interest in stopping that. This Court\ncertainly has said that even in the commercial speech\narea, in Ohralik instance, that it's fineto have\nprophylactic rules as long as the rule continues to\nadvance the interest. The fact that the interest may be\nless strong at the point when they sign an enrollment\ncontract doesn't mean there is still no legitimate\ninterest.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And what is the\ninterest behind the anti-recruiting rule?\nMS. MAHONEY: Several, Your Honor. This is\na group of individuals involved in an educational\nactivity in the State of Tennessee, and they have\ndetermined that athletic recruiting is harmful to young\nadults, that it puts too much emphasis on athletics,\nthat it also --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They could have\ndetermined that it's particularly harmful to the public\nschools who don't have the option of recruiting while\nthe private schools do?\nMS. MAHONEY: Well, Your Honor, in 1997\nthere were five violations, five penalties for\nviolations of the recruiting rule, and four of them were\nagainst public schools, one against a private school.\nThat's at the transcript at 2705. Public schools have\nto bear the burden of these rules because they do try to\nrecruit.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Could the association bar\nBrentwood from contacting public school students\naltogether?\nMS. MAHONEY: About anything? I think again\n--\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: About enrollment. About\nenrollment.\nMS. MAHONEY: I think, Your Honor, that it\nwould be hard to say that that is germane, and it would\nalso put a very large burden on speech if they imposed a\nflat contact. They've done nothing of the kind. There\nhave been --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, like if Brentwood,\nlet's assume -- I think it's true -- is rather\nwell-known in the State, and if they send you a\nsolicitation form to enroll, everybody knows they've got\na great athletic program, so we say you can't solicit\nany high school students.\nMS. MAHONEY: I think that they haven't done\nit. It would certainly be far less reasonable. I\ndon't -- I think that that would be much more of a\nburden on speech.\nHere it's undisputed -- I shouldn't say it's\nundisputed, but the record certainly establishes, that\nacademic targeting is not prohibited -- that's in the\ntranscript at 2202 -- that if Brentwood Academy or any\nother school wants to initiate contact for the purpose\nof trying to persuade them to come for academics, it's\nentirely free to do so. This rule is not designed to in\nany way stifle those kinds of communications.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I haven't kept track of\nyour time, but if we're going to rule for you we have to\nreach the due process problem. And at some point after\nyou finish discussing what you wish to on free speech, I\nactually find that a somewhat more difficult issue.\nMS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, if I could just --\none thing I do want to make clear about the\nvoluntariness of the choice and then I'll turn to due\nprocess, is that, as we set out in our brief, one of the\nthings that Brentwood and some of its amici have tried\nto say is that there simply is no ability to play\nscholastic sports in Tennessee if you're not a member of\nthis association. And it's important to emphasize that\nfor regular season play, for instance, members of TSSAA\nare free to play any non-member schools they want.\nIt used to be that the association required\napproval, which was routinely granted. But in 2005 they\nactually changed the rule. It's in the handbook at page\n23 on their website.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But then that's part of\nthe trophy, whatever it is when you win at the end of\nthe year.\nMS. MAHONEY: That's right, Your Honor. You\ncould have -- all that TSSAA does is give the\nopportunity to engage in its State tournaments,\npost-season competition.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there any other?\nMS. MAHONEY: Yes, Your Honor. There is a\nChristian Athletic League that has 26 private schools,\nthat also conducts State tournaments. There are also\nState tournaments in other sports, including lacrosse,\nswimming, that are not run by TSSAA. And there's\nnothing to stop Brentwood, for instance, from trying\nform its own league, which is what independent schools\nhave done in many other States. They also could have\nregular season play with TSSAA member schools and have\ninvitationals. There's no bar on schools attending\nthose.\nIf I could quickly turn to Justice Kennedy's\nquestion with respect to the issue of due process. I\nthink that the analysis is really quite similar. What\noccurred here is a contractual agreement to provide\ncertain kinds of process which actually satisfy the\nstandards in Laudermill, but in addition Brentwood would\nhave been able to bring a beach of contract action under\nState law if it wanted to allege that it didn't get the\nnotice that the contract required. And this Court held\nin Lujan that you have to take into account the\navailability of a State breach of contract action before\njumping to the conclusion that due process rights have\nbeen violated. Yet the Sixth Circuit did not take that\ninto account.\nIf I could save the remainder of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMs. Mahoney.\nMr. Himmelfarb?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAN HIMMELFARB\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nThe position of the United States is that\nthe court of appeals applied the wrong standard in\ndeciding Brentwood's First Amendment claim. This\nCourt's decisions establish that when the government\noffers a benefit that a citizen is free to reject, it\nhas much greater leeway in regulating speech than when\nit exercises its coercive sovereign power. As in cases\nwhere the Government acts as an employer, a contractor,\na property owner, a service provider or a benefactor,\nthe TSSAA offers a benefit, access to organized athletic\ncompetition, that a school may decline by choosing not\nto become a member of the association.\nBrentwood's First Amendment challenge to\nthe TSSAA recruiting rule, therefore, is subject to\ndeferential review. Deferential First Amendment review\nis appropriate in these contexts because the Government\noccupies a middle ground when it is not exercising its\nsovereign authority. On the one hand the Government\nremains the Government no matter what authority it's\nexercising -- so it is subject to the restrictions of\nthe First Amendment.\nOn the other hand, when the Government acts\nin a non-sovereign capacity, its position is comparable\nto that of private sector entities and it has to be able\nto make the same sorts of decisions that they make. It\nhas to be able to decide what conduct is acceptable in\nits workplace, what activities may take place on its\nproperty, and the uses to which its grant money may be\nput.\nSo the First Amendment can't apply with the\nsame force as when the Government acts in its sovereign\ncapacity. For example, a government agency can tell its\nemployees not to use offensive language with co-workers\nor customers, as Justice O'Connor pointed out in her\nplurality opinion in Waters versus Churchill, and that\nprohibition would not be subject to heightened First\nAmendment scrutiny. So, too, an athletic association\ncan tell the students at its member schools that they\ncan't use offensive language in dealing with opposing\nplayers or referees, as indeed the TSSAA bylaws in fact\ndo. This is at page 202 of the joint appendix. And\nthat prohibition should not be subject to heightened\nFirst Amendment scrutiny either. The same is true of\nother rules that govern membership in and define the\ncharacter of a voluntary athletic association.\nAs applied to TSSAA's recruiting rule, the\ndeferential standard of review is easily satisfied.\nProhibiting the use of undue influence in recruiting or\nattempting to secure or retain high school athletes we\nthink is self-evidently reasonable in light of the\npurposes underlying the rule, which include preventing\nthe exploitation of children and ensuring that sports\nremains subordinate to academics.\nProhibiting coaches from contacting students\nwho have not enrolled at the coach's school is likewise\nreasonable. Either because that prohibition can\nreasonably be reviewed as an instance of undue influence\nitself, or because it is a reasonable prophylactic\nmeasure to prevent the exertion of undue influence.\nAnd finally defining enrollment in the\ncontext of the prohibition on coaches contacting\nstudents to exclude the situation where a student has\nsomehow announced its intention -- announced his\nintention to attend its school, for example, as in this\ncase by signing an enrollment contract, is reasonable as\nwell for the reasons Ms. Mahoney mentioned in responding\nto Justice Souter's question. Somebody who signs an\nenrollment contract may not decide -- may ultimately\ndecide to attend a different school, and there is\nevidence in the record that students sometimes sign\nmultiple enrollment contracts and sometimes decide to\nattend a different school after signing one. This is at\npage 240 of the joint appendix and there are additional\ncitations to the record on page 6 of the reply brief.\nIn short, while the First Amendment has a\nrole to play in this case and cases like it, it is a\nvery limited role. And the recruiting rule easily\nsatisfies what we think is the appropriately deferential\nstandard of review that applies in circumstances of this\ntype. The judgment of the court of appeals should be\nreversed.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this, what is\nyour response to the, one of your earlier questions.\nSuppose they sent out a general brochure to all the\ngraduating grammar school students to -- advertising\nthat they come up to Brentwood and so forth and so on,\nand the rule prohibited that? Would that rule be valid?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: I think that would be close\nto the line, Justice Stevens. The -- the prohibition on\ncoach contact we think is an easy case. There are, in\nfact, ways that schools can communicate --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But isn't the coach\nrecruiting just a subcategory of a broader --\nMR. HIMMELFARB: No. If it is a brochure\nsent out by the school generally and it doesn't target\nspecific students and it went out to schools generally,\nand there was a prohibition on that type of thing, I\nthink that might very well be a reasonable restriction\non speech. As I say, I think this that's close --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry; you think\nit might be a reasonable or unreasonable?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: It might be -- well, I\nthink it's close enough to the line that it could go\neither way.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's a close call\nwhether a school can send a brochure to 8th graders that\nis not limited to athletics telling them about their\nschool?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Well, the -- in that\nsituation, I think -- I think it probably would be\nunreasonable, Mr. Chief Justice.\nThe, the -- the methods of -- the\nalternative methods of speech here are not all that\ndifferent -- that are allowed by the rule here -- are\nnot all that different from Justice Stevens'\nhypothetical. There are a number of ways in which\nschools can communicate with prospective students and\ntheir families about athletics at the school, but it's\nusually done through intermediaries. And I think as I\nsay, Justice Stevens' hypothetical is not --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if the mailing\nwas limited to people who had signed contracts with --\nstudents, not just football players but everyone who\nelse had signed enrollment contracts with the school?\nGeneral brochure listing all the things you can do at\nthe school including athletics, including -- you know,\nother extracurricular activities? Is that all right?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: I think --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Or would it be\nunreasonable for the TSSAA to prohibit that?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: I think that would be much\nmore problematic. And I don't -- I don't think that\nthis rule prohibits that. And I don't think it\nprohibits Justice Stevens' example.\nWhat the rule allows is for schools to send\nout information about their athletic programs to other\nschools to distribute to their students, for example.\nIt also allows them to send it out to real estate\nbrokers, to athletic leagues that aren't associated with\nthe school, to advertise. It allows it to respond to\ndirect inquiries from students.\nBut I think Justice Stevens' hypothetical\nand your hypothetical, Mr. Chief Justice, are pretty\nclose to the sorts of things that are allowed by this\nrecruiting rule. And I do agree with you that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'm not asking you about\nthe school for the rule. I'm trying to figure out\nwhat's the scope of the First Amendment protection.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Right. I -- I -- I think\nthat if the, if the -- if the recruiting rule -- if\nthere were a recruiting rule that prohibited those types\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You do agree at some point\nthe First Amendment would prohibit some kind of rule.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Of course. There is, we\nthink there is a reasonableness or germaneness\nlimitation. The justifications for the rule are mainly\npreventing the exploitation of students and ensuring\nthat academics -- that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is that permissible, in\nweighing the -- both sides of the equation to consider\nthe advantages -- I mean the justifications for the\nspeech?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Sure. Under -- under a\nreasonableness standard, I think it is appropriate to\nlook at the justifications for the rule and ask whether\nif the -- the rule reasonably furthers those interests.\nAnd, and in making that determination --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- justification for the\nrule in this case and the justification for the rule\nthat would prohibit the general solicitation I\ndescribed.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is it the same\njustification, but the justification is a little\nstronger in one hypo than the other?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Right. I think you, if you\n-- if you offered those justifications for banning the\ntype of speech you suggested, it might very well be that\nit would be appropriate to conclude that the rule isn't\nreasonably related to those justifications because it\nburdens too much speech.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me that,\nturning to the state action for a moment, one of the\njustifications for finding state action that is there is\nno other real choice, that they have, other than to --\nif they want to play athletics in Tennessee other than\nto join this association.\nAnd yet at the opening of your argument, you\nsaid oh, well it's voluntary. So It seems to me that\nyour speech argument is inconsistent with one of the\njustifications for finding state action to begin with.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Well, no, I don't think so,\nJustice Kennedy. In the types of cases that I mentioned\nat the outset, employment cases, funding cases,\nproperty, ownership cases, I mean there's no dispute\nthat in those cases the Government is a state actor.\nWhen the Government employs people it is a state actor\nsubject to the First Amendment, but deferential review\nis applied to First Amendment challenges because there\nis a choice.\nAnd so too here there is a choice for the\nreasons mentioned by Ms. Mahoney. There are other\nathletic associations that schools can join.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's somewhat\ninconsistent with one of the most forceful arguments for\nfinding state action to begin it, i.e., that you have to\njoin the school if you really want to compete with most\nof the schools. You have to join the association.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Well, I think -- I'm not\nsure that's true, Justice Kennedy. But I think it's\nclear that in this Court's decisions in various areas\napplying deferential First Amendment review, when\nthere's a voluntary relationship between the Government\nand the citizen, that is precisely the reason that the\nCourt applies deferential review.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Himmelfarb.\nMr. Blumstein?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES B. BLUMSTEIN,\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nI represent Brentwood Academy in this civil\nrights case.\nIt's about the regulatory overreaching of\nthe Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association,\nwhat we call the TSSAA. The case involves the First\nAmendment's interest of the school, its students, its\nparents, and the procedural due process interests.\nBrentwood was severely punished, and the\npunishment is listed in footnote 5 of our brief, for\ncommunicating with its own incoming male students,\ninforming them of an opportunity, spring football\npractice, that the students were authorized to attend\nunder the TSSAA rules.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Did it serve the\nsuspension or has that been stayed? Was it suspended\nfrom competition for two years? That was the penalty.\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Did it -- did that take\neffect?\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: The first year it did take\neffect --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: One year --\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: And the second year did not\ntake effect, Justice Kennedy.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And the fine has not been\npaid. The fine.\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: Not yet. But we've\nrecognized that if this turns out to be -- if the TSSAA\nposition turns out to be vindicated, the school will be\nobliged to pay the fine.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Blumstein, there's\none feature of this that I find puzzling. You're making\nthis a First Amendment case. But you joined an\nassociation that has such, certain rules and when one\njoins, one agrees to abide by the rules.\nNothing in the world stops Brentwood from\nsaying this anti-recruiting rule is a really bad rule,\nit is unfair to us; you could have written op ed pieces\nabout it, the school could have talked about it, the\nschool could have urged the board of education to drop\nit. Nothing stopped you from attacking this rule that\nyou don't like. But when you signed on, the First\nAmendment doesn't give you license not to follow the\nrules that you disagree with.\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: Justice Ginsburg, let me say\nthat there's a finding, a stipulation that the school\nthought it was abiding by the rule. It has no intent to\nviolate the rule. Intent is not a requirement.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But isn't part of what\nyou agree to is a organization that has a certain\ngovernance structure, the people in the organization\ndecide, and then make public to all the members of the\nassociation what the rules are and how they're going to\nbe interpreted?\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: Well, Your Honor, let me\nfirst address, in -- in the appendix to our brief is a\ntwo page -- a two-sentence letter from Joe Marley to\nBrentwood Academy. This was in the same year in which\nthis alleged violation occurred; and in the two-sentence\nletter, Ray Marley, the student's father, said it is our\nattention for Ray to attend Brentwood Academy in\n1997-98, Ray has my consent to participate in the speed\nand strength program at Brentwood Academy.\nThe Association then informed the school\nthat it was able to allow this young man to come and\nlift weights at the school based upon that letter. So\nwhen the school wrote a letter and had contact with the\nstudent, based upon an enrollment contract, they thought\nit was an a fortiori circumstance that if they could\nhave Ray Marley lift weights and be there and contact\nthe coach, that a much more elaborate contractual\nenrollment form with signing of a contract and paying a\n$300 deposit would allow them to, in fact, have contact\nwith the coach.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Blumstein, am I not\ncorrect for purposes of our decision, if you're claiming\nconstitutional protection, you're claiming that you'd be\nconstitutionally protected even if you knew in advance\nthat this particular communication would violate the\nrule and even if you did it deliberately? That's what\nyour constitutional position is, is it not?\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: Well, our -- Your Honor, the\nsignificance of the voluntariness --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is it or is it not?\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It is.\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: Yes. I'm sorry. Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So that what really,\nyou're -- it is sort of a side issue as to whether they\nreally had adequate notice and so forth, insofar as\nwe're talking about the First Amendment?\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: Yes, Your Honor. The\nrelevance of the signing up and the voluntary\ninvolvement is ultimately whether there's a waiver; and\nwe don't believe that the requirements of waiver have\neither been pled, which is an obligation, it's an\naffirmative defense, has not been pled. This has never\nbeen treated as a waiver case. It was not in the very\nbeginning.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What if the state set up two\nathletic leagues and one had an anti-recruiting rule and\nthe other didn't, and they were equally strong, and you\nchose to join the one that had the anti-recruiting\nleague. Would it be a violation of the First Amendment\nin your opinion?\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: And both are governmental?\nBoth are governmental, Justice Alito?\nJUSTICE ALITO: Yes, both are governmental.\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: Well, I think if a private\nparty subjects itself voluntary, voluntarily to a\nregulatory program run by the government or which is\nattributable to the government, then under cases like\nIbanez, which we emphasize in our brief, that there is\nan obligation on the part of the government to apply the\nrules fairly, unless there is a waiver of some kind, the\nwaiver standard is the one that makes a difference. But\nI believe in terms of voluntariness, the only difference\nis whether there is some kind of a waiver.\nIn Ibanez where the lawyer, who was also an\naccountant, submitted herself to the jurisdiction of the\naccounting board, there was nothing requiring her to\nsubmit herself to that jurisdiction.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But your claim here is not\nthat they didn't apply the rules fairly, your claim is\nthat they applied the rules.\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: Unconstitutionally.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's right. Fairly.\nFairly as they were written. But you say even if they\ndid apply them fairly, that's no good.\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: That's correct,\nJustice Scalia. That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I just wanted to be clear\non that.\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: But I think perhaps --\nJUSTICE ALITO: And even if was purely\nvoluntary and even if you had two choices but you chose\nthe -- you chose to join the association with the\nanti-recruiting rule, there would be a First Amendment\nproblem?\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: Yes, Your Honor. If the\ngovernment has a regulatory program providing an\nimprimatur, certification, accreditation, and you as an\nindividual or an entity, private entity, seek that\ngovernmental imprimatur, it's available and you seek\nthat, then the government must respect your First\nAmendment rights.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So what if you\ndecided to offer bonuses to 8th graders, a thousand\ndollars -- and of course that's, I assume that's against\nthe rules in Tennessee -- would you have -- would that\nbe covered by your First Amendment right?\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: No, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why not?\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: That would be conduct, Your\nHonor. And I think that, again, the problem that we\nhave here is that the TSSAA has not --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's not the\nline that we draw elsewhere in the First Amendment.\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: Between money as an\ninducing, an inducement, we would view an inducement or\nan incentive as conduct, as opposed to speech,\ncommunication. Here there was no evidence that any\ninducement or emolument or promise of future activity\nwas elicited from the school. The only thing that was\ndone was sending them a letter informing them about an\nactivity that was an approved activity.\nAnd I think that for our purposes in\ndrafting and implementing the undue influence rule, the\nassociation has never recognized the difference between\nits authority to regulate speech and its authority to\nregulate conduct. And as a result, they've never gone\nthrough a process of figuring out how can they\naccommodate their legitimate interest.\nWe -- our school strongly supports a\nrecruiting rule that's aimed at barring these kinds of\nconducts, Chief Justice, as you've just described. The\nproblem is that the association, by not recognizing that\nthe First Amendment enters into the analysis, that they\nhave not -- never gone through a process of calculating\nthe cost on speech, as this Court's decisions in cases\nlike the Lorillard case or the Fox case require that\nthey do, that they consider the impact on speech. If\nyou don't agree that there's any difference between\nspeech and conduct, you don't have to engage in that\nkind of a process.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Blumstein, you're\nmaking that distinction. Is there -- if the association\nsays no school in this association can invite students\nenrolled in other schools to its practice, that's okay?\nBecause that's conduct, right? If this is your\nstatement, there's nothing to recruit for, because we\ndon't allow it period.\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: Yes, Justice Ginsburg.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That would be okay.\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: That's correct. We have no\nproblem with the revised rules that the association has\nadopted that does not permit spring practice --\nnon-matriculated students to participate in spring\npractice. That's a regulation of conduct and it doesn't\nfall within speech. We think that was the right\nsolution, not punishing the school in what --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It's a little odd, isn't\nit, that they could do -- they could take the stronger\nmeasure but not the lesser measure of saying it's\navailable but we don't want you to broadcast it?\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: Well, under the First\nAmendment, it is a core principle that speech about\nlawful or permitted conduct cannot be punished just\nbecause of the speech. We have a finding of the\ndistrict court that the speech was actually beneficial,\nit was welcomed by the families and by the children who\nreceived the information. And in fact, it was\neffective. The very thing the TSSAA --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But not beneficial to the\nsystem. That's why the organization didn't like it.\nAnd I wanted to come back to something you said just a\nminute ago, that there's an obligation under the First\nAmendment to weigh the effects of speech. Is there? I\nmean, suppose a government organization simply comes out\nwith a rule that is perfectly fair, and that happens to\ngive due weight to the fact that it's restricting\nspeech, but the government organization has frankly\nnever considered it. They didn't sit down around a\ntable and say now, look, this is going affect speech,\nlet's be careful here. They didn't do that. They just\npromulgated a perfectly reasonable rule.\nWouldn't we uphold that?\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: Well, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They don't have to consider\nthe matter, do they? They just have to get it right,\nwhether they considered it or not.\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: I believe that under the\nLorillard case and under this Court's decision in the\nFox case, that there is an obligation to engage in what\nis called the careful calculation of cause and benefits.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Certainly. We have to do\nthat. Certainly we have to do it in assessing whether,\nwhat the government has done is okay. But you're saying\nit's invalid unless the government gathers together a\ngroup of people just to shoot the breeze about -- I\ndon't know of any of our cases that require that.\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: Well, Your Honor, there was\nin the Lorillard case, the tobacco regulation case, the\nCourt was specifically critical that the attorney\ngeneral of Massachusetts did not consider the cost of\nspeech, particularly with respect to --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I mean, you may\ncriticize them when they get it -- when it comes out\nwrong. Then you can say, when the result is wrong, they\nshould have considered it. But when it comes out right?\nDo you have any case where it comes out right and it's\nperfectly reasonable, we say tsk, tsk, oh, but even\nthough it came out right, they didn't consider speech?\nWe've never said anything like that.\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: But Justice Scalia, in your\nopinion in the Fox case, one of the safeguards that was\narticulated for speech protection was the need to have a\nprocedural safeguard. And one of those safeguards was\nthe development of a careful calculation of benefits and\ncosts with respect to freedom of speech.\nThat was the -- that was the case involving\nthe Tupperware parties on the State University campus of\nNew York. And one of the protections that was built\ninto the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's where you had an\napproval system where one party would be approved and\nanother one wouldn't. Of course, in that situation, you\nhave to engage case by case in making the weighing. But\nthis is not an approval situation. It's the issuance of\na rule that applies to everybody.\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: Well, in addition, there is\nan obligation under this Court's decision in the\nThompson case for the government to consider non-speech\nalternatives, where to restrict -- and to achieve its\nobjectives by not regulating speech at all. In the\nThompson case --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Blumstein, it seems to\nme that Ms. Mahoney addressed that in response to a\nquestion from me.\nI said, in effect, that once a student has\nsigned an enrollment contract, where is there any\nrecruiting going on? And she said there is recruiting,\nand hence there is an interest in regulating recruiting,\nbecause not everybody who signs these contracts, or on\nbehalf of whom those contracts are signed, end up going\nto the school. So that in fact, there is room for\nrecruiting right up to the moment that the kid arrives\nin the fall and signs on the dotted line.\nWhat is your response to her response?\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: Well, the district court\nfound that the constitutional balance tipped at that\npoint because the evidence suggested that while that\ndoes happen, it's not a normal occurrence, fewer than 5\npercent of cases.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, how many cases have\nthere got to be before you would recognize the\nsufficiency of the asserted state interest?\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: Well, I think that once a\nfamily has -- and the evidence in this case established\nthat all these families had made their educational\nchoice.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, we know that.\nThey've signed the contract. So that's where we start.\nAnd you're saying, well, only about 5\npercent of them weasel out of it later on and go to some\nother school. But why is 5 percent insufficient?\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: Well, in this case, the\nassociation allows the underlying practice itself. It\npermits the underlying practice.\nAnd so if there's a concern about\nrecruiting --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So that if the kid comes\nand says, look, I'm going to Brentwood next fall and I'd\nlike to tag along to a spring practice, they say okay.\nBut that's not recruiting. The school hasn't initiated\nit. In this case, the school has initiated it by the\nletter. And it does sound like recruiting if you accept\nthe proposition that the students aren't bound to go to\nthe school even though their parents signed up and some\nof them don't.\nSo I come back to my question. If taking\nyour figure -- let's assume that only 5 percent, in\nfact, change their minds. Why doesn't -- why isn't\nthere a legitimate interest in preventing recruiting\nwithin the 5 percent?\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: But there's the whole cited\nQuestion 3, Justice Souter.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah, but would you answer\nmy question? Why isn't that enough?\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: Well, I think, again, as\nlong as the association permits this activity and says\nthere is a risk of recruiting at that activity if the\nstudents are not firmly committed, irrevocably committed\nto a place, and that they allow that conduct, then to\nallow the -- to bar the -- the school from talking about\nor at least mentioning the -- the activity as an\nopportunity, then at that point the association if it\nwants to protect its interests must act to prohibit the\nconduct, not the speech.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. It certainly can do\nthat. There's no question about it. But it seems to me\nthat the line that is being drawn is a line between\ncontact which is initiated by the prospective student\nand proselytizing which is initiated by the school. Why\nisn't that a reasonable line?\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: Well, because -- Ms. Mahoney\ncited an example that does not require initiated school\ncontact. Question 3 prohibits all contact, whether it's\ninitiated by the school or initiated by the student.\nIn joint appendix 181 --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That's not what we've got\nbefore us.\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: Yes, we do. She cited\nQuestion 3, and what it says is, no coach -- no. \"A\ncoach may not contact a student or his or her parents\nprior to -- \"\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. We're still talking\nabout athletic contact.\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: Yes, but not necessarily\ninitiated by the coach. It would be, in fact,\nimpermissible. Under their interpretation of their own\nrules, it would be impermissible for the coach to speak\nto people at this practice.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. Maybe that would\npresent a different kind of problem, but that's not what\nwe've got here. What we've got here is contact through\nspeech that was initiated by the coach.\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And I am saying that if the\nrule generally -- maybe quite imprecisely -- but if it\ngenerally distinguishes between that kind of\nproselytizing by a coach, and on the other hand contact\nthat a kid initiates in the first place, isn't that\nroughly a fair line?\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: Well, I don't think so,\nJustice Souter, because once the association determines\nthat this activity is legitimate, and authorizes this\nwith respect to the feeder pattern, so that all public\nschools can be --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The activity being tagging\nalong to spring practice?\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: Participating in spring\npractice. And all the kind of activity that the\nassociation objects to would be permitted if there were\na feeder pattern. And in this case, the kind of\nactivity that they say they want to isolate the students\nfrom, what you were describing as coach-initiated\ncontact, all of that is permitted in the feeder pattern.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But the answer to that is,\nthey're not trying to prevent people, at least under\nthis rule, they're not trying to prevent 8th grade kids\nfrom going to spring practice. They're trying to\nprevent coaches from proselytizing kids, and that's the\ndistinction. Why isn't it a reasonable distinction?\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: Well, the proselytization\nhere was found to be a harmless letter sent just\ninforming the kids that they had an opportunity. So I\nguess it depends on how one characterizes what the\ncommunication is.\nWe would characterize --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It was a letter from coach.\nIt was a letter from coach. I mean, that to a young\nkid, that is recruiting. That is showing an interest on\nthe part of the person who's going to decide who plays,\nan interest in you.\nI think it's entirely reasonable to consider\nthat recruiting.\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: But the letter,\nJustice Scalia, went to all students, not just the\nathletes. It was not targeted to any particular person.\nAll 12 students who -- male students who were admitted,\nwere incoming students, all of those students got the\nletter. It wasn't targeted in any type of recruiting\nmode. Every student who was admitted and signed the\ncontract received the letter.\nAnd a 13th student who was admitted but who\ndid not sign the enrollment contract did not receive the\nletter. So that the school was very careful, so that\nthey --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it fair to say \"your\ncoach\"? The letter was signed by your coach, not just\ncoach.\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: Well, these were incoming\nstudents, Justice Ginsburg, and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And did it say, by the way,\neverybody got this letter? Did it say that at the\nbottom?\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: Again we think if the\npractice itself was problematic, was educationally\nunsound, if there was a risk of any of the interests\nthat were involved, then the association could and did\nprohibit participation in that activity.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Weren't all these things\nthat are being discussed before the factfinder, or was\nthere some ex parte contact later which was the only\nevidence for what we're talking about now? I'm getting\ninto the due process point.\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: The information that was\nbefore the factfinder had to do with, on the due process\npoint, had to do with a person who was not related to\nthe school but who had been, it turns out falsely,\naccused of offering inducements to students to attend\nthe school.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I mean, all of these\nmatters were discussed and there was an opportunity to\nreply to all of these matters that we've just been\ntalking about, correct?\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: Yes. There was a procedure\nin which there was an exchange of letters between the\nassociation and the school, in which the association had\nsome investigation and then the school had an\nopportunity to respond. Yes, Judge Kennedy.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It doesn't seem to me like\nthere's a strong case for a flawed hearing for a due\nprocess violation.\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: The problem was that the\ndistrict court made two findings in this regard that\nwere very important: That the association misled the\nschool as to what issues were still open and available;\nand that ultimately a matter involving this Bart King\nwas discussed at the closed after-hearing session,\nexecutive session, and the school had been told that the\nBart King allegations were no longer on the table.\nNow, the school did put forward evidence\nabout one youngster named Jacques Curry who was alleged\nto have been recruited by Bart King. Again, Bart King\nhad no status with the school at all. And they put\nJacques Curry before the hearing panel and the hearing\npanel wound up restoring his eligibility.\nBut it turns out that they, at the trial,\nthat the association members, or the board of control,\nadmitted that they considered the Bart King allegations\nto enhance the penalty. So it must have been something\nbeyond Jacques Curry and that the school was never\ninformed that the Bart King's involvement beyond Jacques\nCurry had anything to did with the proceedings.\nSo the district court found there was\nmisleading of the school and that they -- the school\nnever had a chance to respond to the evidence that was\npresented by these investigators for the association.\nAnd so therefore they did not have evidence, they were\nnot aware of evidence, and they didn't have a chance to\nrespond or to reply to that evidence.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What was the evidence?\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE BREYER: What was the evidence?\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: We don't know what the\nevidence was.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, at this late date,\nyou've had trials. You're saying -- did you ask? With\nall these people under oath, haven't you had trials and\neverything?\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: Well, the evidence suggested\nthat --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Did you ever ask the people\nwho were at the meeting, what was the evidence you\nconsidered that we haven't had a chance to see?\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: And --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Did you or not?\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And then, and what did they\nsay?\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: The evidence was the notes\nthat was presented were the notes taken by the\ninvestigators.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So there were\nsome notes taken by investigators, which did they have\nanything new in them you hadn't seen before?\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: We hadn't seen, we hadn't\nseen them before the hearing.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What was in there that you\nhad not seen before in the notes?\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: Well, again I think that\nwhat was -- what was available to the association was --\nexcuse me --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm asking you: What was\nin the notes that were presented to the decisionmaker\nthat you had not previously seen and therefore had no\nopportunity to rebut? What particularly and\nspecifically? And it's surprising to me that you\nhesitate at this very late date if this is a serious\nissue.\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: Well, we did not know that\nthose issues were even on the table. The executive\ndirector testified at trial that the issue of Bart King\nwas no longer on the table, and the notes were not\npresented to the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What did it say in the\nnotes that you, a factual matter or some other, that you\ndid not have a chance to reply to specifically?\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: Well, we learned that the\ninvestigators had not spoken to Mr. King.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What you learned was the\ninvestigators had not spoken to Mr. King, and you\npreviously did not know that, and if you had known that\nyou would have said to the decisionmaker: The\ninvestigators did not speak to Mr. King. And if you had\nsaid that, how would this case be different?\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: What we would have been in a\nposition to say, Your Honor, was that we want to\nunderstand what your perception, your, the\ninvestigators' perception, is of what Bart King's\nrelationship to Brentwood Academy is and how -- and what\nhe is alleged to have done.\nWe have no control, we had no knowledge, of\nanything that Mr. King did, and if any of those\nallegations were true the school wanted an opportunity\nto disassociate itself.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And the other side says,\nMr. Bart King was part of the school and had something\nto do with this?\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: No --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is that right.\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: I don't believe that they've\ntaken that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well then, I don't\nunderstand what the relevance of this is.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I thought your claim was\nthat you had a witness available to testify, but you\ndidn't put him on because you didn't think they were\ngoing into this issue. That's all.\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: This was Mr. King himself\nwas availability. And he -- and we put him up, offered\nhim for --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But I don't understand what\nMr. King has to do with this if the other side is not\nclaiming that Mr. King is part of your operation.\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: But the association, the\nassociation association witnesses testified at trial,\nJustice Breyer, that in fact they -- that they\nconsidered the King allegations. We don't know exactly\nwhat that meant at the trial.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Who considered it?\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: That the board of control,\nthe TSSAA board.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Did you ask the people on\nthe board of control, what role did Mr. King play in\nyour decision?\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: And the answer that was\ngiven at trial, and the trial judge found this, was that\nhe played a role, not in the liable but in the penalty.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So that they might have\nreduced it ed it from $3,000 to less had they not been\nunder the mistaken impression that Mr. King had\nsomething to do with you when he did it.\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: And specifically to mention\nthe terms, the length of the probation, is what they\nsaid, the probation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And the probation was --\nand the probation, which was for four years?\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And have you served the\nfour years.\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: Well, I believe one year has\nbeen served at this point.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So there is three more\nyears? So if in fact you are correct that they were\nunder a misapprehension on this matter, then the thing\nto do would to be find out if that extra three years had\nsomething to do with this erroneous thing of Mr. King?\nIt's surprising to me all of this is coming up now, but\nthere we are. So but that's your specific claim.\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: The concern was that the\nassociation had told us, and the district court found\nthis, that the King allegations were not on the table.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I thought it was a\ndifferent claim. I thought you were claiming there was\na violation of due process because an investigator spoke\nwithout you present to the board.\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And that I would think was\nnot a violation of the Constitution since it happens\nevery day of the week in administrative agencies. But\nif you want to claim it is, I'll be happy to listen.\nAnd I think in that you're saying the\nAdministrative Procedures Act is unconstitutional, which\nwould be a surprising claim to me.\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: No, but that we -- that the\ndisclosure of evidence as a basis of decision and an\nopportunity to respond to that evidence in a\ndisciplinary hearing this Court has held as recently as\nthe Hamdi case and certainly in Laudermill that that is\nan important procedural protection of due process, and\nthat's what we're seeking in this case as well, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Thank you.\nMR. BLUMSTEIN: Again, we think that the\nFirst Amendment framework that exists for regulatory\ncases fits this case well. The only difference is\nwhether or not there's a waiver. We think there's not a\nwaiver. The Government has claimed that they can define\naway First Amendment rights. In our brief we address\nthat claim. We don't believe that the Government can\ndefine away First Amendment rights, and there is not a\ncase that they have cited really that supports the\nposition that the First Amendment should apply\ndifferently in this context, where the Government is\nregulating just because it is, the source of authority\nis a different source of authority, a non-sovereign\nsource of authority.\nThe Southeastern Promotions case, the Ibanez\ncase, those cases, the Barnett case, and the Fox case,\nJustice Scalia's opinion in the Fox case, make it clear\nthat the source of authority, in that case universities,\nis not determinative. The Fox case discussed the\nelements of commercial speech and that arose in a\nuniversity context, but it's been applied across the\nboard in all commercial speech cases, regulatory cases,\nwhether there was sovereign power or, as in the case of\nFox, it was not sovereign power at all.\nSo we think that the First Amendment\ndoctrine, the rubric that we've described in our brief,\nis the proper one that should be applied in this\ncircumstance and that there's not a need to carve out a\nspecial exception, which is what the Government is\nasking for and what the TSSAA is asking for, to\ngenerally applicable First Amendment doctrine.\nThis is a case of content-based regulation.\nThe time, place, and manner defense therefore cannot\nwork as a defense, and we think therefore, the TSSAA\ncase collapses under First Amendment.\nThank you very much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMs. Mahoney, you have four minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN MAHONEY\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. MAHONEY: Thank you.\nIf I could respond to the due process\nissues, this is still a very important claim because if\nin fact the association has violated civil rights by\nfailing to give due process Brentwood would still be\nentitled to an award of attorney's fees. And I think\nit's critical that when an association enters into a\ncontract and agrees upon procedures, that if those\nprocedures can -- are not followed, a member of the\nassociation can bring a breach of contract action in\nState court.\nBut Brentwood did not do that. Instead it\ntried to constitutionalize this contract dispute and\nassert rights under Section 1983.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I thought it had some\nState claims as pendant claims.\nMS. MAHONEY: The only State claim they had\nas a pendant claim was arbitrary action under State law,\nand the district court dismissed that because it found\nthat the questions were sufficiently novel that he\ndidn't feel that he should entertain jurisdiction over\nit. But they did not assert a breach of contract claim.\nAnd it's important to note that the bylaws\nactually provide that a member must be given, quote,\n\"notice of the charges and an opportunity to present its\ncase at a hearing.\" So if they actually did not get\nnotice of the charges involving Bart King, it would have\nbeen a breach of contract. So that's the first problem,\nis that the court of appeals didn't even look at the\nfact that they had a contract remedy, just like the\ncontractor had in Lujan, and they simply weren't taking\nadvantage of it.\nSecond, the suggestion that they were not\nactually given notice is contradicted by the record.\nAnd it's not issues of credibility. This is just an\nultimate conclusion about whether they had sufficient\nnotice. And if you look at the record, the exchange of\nletters, at JA-205 is the letter that starts by\ndisclosing the charges, and it specifically discloses\nthat the association investigators have talked to a\nnumber of middle school students, have talked to a\nnumber of middle school coaches, and details precisely\nwhat those witnesses have said about Bart King.\nNow they say, well, we didn't know that Bart\nKing was still involved by the time we got to the last\nhearing. But look in fact what they did. They came to\nthe hearing. They submitted the affidavit of Bart King.\nOne of their live witnesses was Jacques Curry and the\nonly thing he testified about was his relationship with\nBart King.\nAnd then they ran out of time. They ran out\nof time. They had Bart King there. They were thinking\nabout putting him on live. They had had an allotted\nperiod of time. They used it all up without putting --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Was there anything at the\ntrial that came out that the investigator when they were\nin the private session said a fact about Bart King of\nsupreme importance that they didn't know about?\nMS. MAHONEY: Absolutely not, Your Honor.\nThere was absolutely nothing they've said that they\ndidn't know about.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, didn't one of the\ndecisionmakers testify that they relied on this --\nMS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, most of them\nactually testified that they did not.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, but one did.\nMS. MAHONEY: There was one who had\ntestified --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And did not the district\ncourt find that his testimony was credible?\nMS. MAHONEY: He did, Your Honor, and -- but\neven if that's true, even if the board did rely on\nevidence about Bart King in deciding what penalty ought\nto be, how much probation, whatever, that still does not\nestablish that there was a due process violation because\nthey had notice that the Bart King issues could be\nconsidered at this trial. They actually submitted\nevidence. They submitted Bart King's affidavit and the\nrecord shows that the board said they considered all the\nevidence that had been submitted.\nAnd when they -- and the reason they didn't\nput him on, they say: \"It was our intention to put him\non, but I don't know if you are all interested in\nextending for five minutes to hear from Bart King or\nnot. He's here if you want him.\" Carter responds \"No.\"\nHe doesn't say: The King issues aren't on the table.\nThank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nWe're not going to extend for five minutes.\n"
