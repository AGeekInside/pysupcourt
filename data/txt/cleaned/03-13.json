COOPER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. COOPER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nLandgraf and its progeny provide the basis for a\ndecision in this case. In enacting the FSIA, Congress did\nnot direct that it apply retrospectively to events that\noccurred prior to its enactment. Moreover, application of\nthe 1976 expropriation exception to alleged conduct that\noccurred in and before 1948 would change the legal\nconsequences of that conduct, and therefore be impermissibly\nretroactive.\nQUESTION: What -- why would it change the legal\nconsequences? It -- wouldn't it just change where you can,\nwhere you can sue?\nMR. COOPER: No, in fundamental terms it would\nchange the legal consequences. Prior to 1976, there was\ncomplete immunity in this country for claims of\nexpropriation. Foreign sovereigns had an expectation that\nthey would not be hailed into our courts to answer for the\ninternal exercise of their sovereign activities, and that is\nthe fundamental aspect of -\nQUESTION: Did the Tate letter have any coverage\nprior to '76, the so-called Tate letter from the State\nDepartment?\nMR. COOPER: The so-called Tate letter changed the\nState Department's position with respect to commercial\nactivities as of 1952. This conduct all preceded 1952 and\nconcerned what has always been recognized as essentially\npublic acts, that is, acts of expropriation.\nBut to finish the answer to Justice Scalia, the -\nthe issue that underlies the whole concept of foreign\nsovereign immunity at its very basis is the question of\njurisdiction, will exercise jurisdiction to question past\njudgment on the sovereign conduct of foreign states acting\nin their own -- within their own borders with respect to\nproperty within their own country in this case. And that's\nsomething that as a matter of comity and as a matter of\ninternational concepts of orderly relationships between\nsovereigns that we don't tolerate.\nQUESTION: But I thought that -- well, first, I\nthink you recognize that this suit could be brought inside\nAustria, and then one of the countries that don't follow the\n-- the absolute rule. Then it seems to me that Justice\nScalia is right, it's a question of where you can sue. You\n-- your argument is the United States has been self-denying,\nbut countries like Austria itself that don't follow that\nabsolute rule could be a proper forum.\nMR. COOPER: With respect, Justice Ginsburg, the -\nthis issue of the adoption of the restrictive theory by any\ncountry is really a red herring here. The expropriation\nexception concerns itself with what has always been\nrecognized as a public act, and that is that the act of\nexpropriation, something that can only be done by a\ngovernmental entity through the exercise of its governmental\nauthority.\nQUESTION: But I -- as I understand this claim,\nit's not the original ex parte -- expropriation is when\nAustria isn't even a country, because this happened in the\nNazi period, right?\nMR. COOPER: No, Your Honor. The United States'\nposition throughout World War II and thereafter has been\nthat Austria retained its sovereignty, that it was an\noccupied state by the Nazi regime. The United States\nimmediately recognized -\nQUESTION: Then why was there a second republic?\nMR. COOPER: The second republic was the\nreconstituted government of the state of Austria, but the\nUnited States' position, and it is the executive's position\nthat has binding authority with respect to the sovereign\nstatus, the executive's position was that Austria was always\na state.\nMore importantly, Your Honor -\nQUESTION: But may I continue, because I thought\nthat this claim, whatever you say about Austria's status in\nthe, at the time of the Anschluss, that it's not necessarily\nabout the stealing of the goods, it's about the retention of\nthe goods.\nMR. COOPER: We don't believe that that's a correct\nreading of section 1603 -- 1605(a)(3). 1605(a)(3) concerns\nitself with the expropriation of property. The Congress -\nI articulated the power for the enactment of the\nexpropriation exception as the power to define and punish\nviolations of the laws of nations, and it is not even\narguably the case that a possession of expropriated\nproperty, especially as it's been argued by the respondent,\nnot necessarily even having been expropriated by the\ndefendant country, is a violation of international law.\nQUESTION: So if you know that you've taken from an\nexpropriator, that's all right under international law?\nMR. COOPER: It's not a question of whether it's\nall right. It's a question of whether Congress decided that\nit was a basis for an exception to the long-standing and\ngeneral rule of law in this country, that is, sovereign\nimmunity. So in other words, has -- has Congress determined\nthat one of the narrow and specified exceptions to foreign\nsovereign immunity is the mere possession of property?\nQUESTION: Is it sovereign immunity or is it the\nact of state doctrine?\nMR. COOPER: It's sovereign immunity, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Well, but, I mean, even -- there -\nthere are two things that happen here. The sovereign can be\nbrought into court, but more than that, the sovereign can be\nheld to account for the act of the sovereign on its own\nterritory. The latter, it seems to me, can be described as\nsubstantive law, the former, just allowing the sovereign to\ncome into your -- or allowing your court to entertain a suit\nagainst the sovereign is -- is just -- just where suit goes.\nIt has nothing to do with the outcome of the suit.\nMR. COOPER: This Court determined -\nQUESTION: So I -- I wish you could tell me that it\ndid have to do with the act of state doctrine, because that\nwould be -- that would be a substantive change and that\nshould not be retroactive.\nMR. COOPER: The -- the active state doctrine is an\nindependent doctrine that is not before the Court today.\nThe sovereign immunity doctrine is before the Court today.\nSovereign immunity, this Court decided in Verlinden, is a\nmatter of substantive Federal law. This Court made that\ndecision after careful consideration and with specific\nreference to the FSIA and Congress' power to enact it, and\nconcluded that it was more than a jurisdictional statute.\nMoreover, in the Hughes case, this Court\ndetermined that merely articulating a statute's terms in\nterms of jurisdiction does not remove it from the\nretroactivity analysis we urge is the rule of law that -\nthat determines the outcome of this case. Quite the\ncontrary. Hughes made it clear that in circumstances very\nmuch like these, where a cause of action was not previously\nallowed, and here the immunity kept a -- an action for\nexpropriation from being adjudicated in American courts\nunder those circumstances. As of 1976, there was a\nfundamental change in the law with respect to foreign\nsovereigns.\nQUESTION: Well, in Hughes -- in Hughes there were\n-- there were other changes besides the -- besides the\njurisdictional one. There -- there were defenses that were\neliminated. I don't think Hughes is a very good -- good\ncase for you, but Verlinden, it seems to me, is -- is -- is\ncloser, but we were determining there whether it was a\nsubstantive law or not for a very different purpose, for the\nexistence of -- of power on the part of the Federal\nGovernment to -- to enact the statute. That's a -- that's a\nbit different from the purpose for which we're determining\nwhether it's a substantive law here.\nMR. COOPER: The interest of the United States,\nYour Honor, in the -- the administration of cases against\nforeign sovereigns has long been recognized by this Court as\nbeing a -- a matter of great national interest. The\nquestion of when we decide to exercise jurisdiction over\nforeign sovereigns is an essential component of the way this\ncountry interacts with other countries. It's an area in\nwhich the Constitution conferred responsibility on the\npolitical branches. The executive exercised that\nresponsibility for the vast portion of this country's\nhistory and then submitted to Congress an act, the Foreign\nSovereign Immunity Act, which Congress then enacted, and\ncreated -\nQUESTION: But none of that's in question.\nMR. COOPER: -- very narrow exceptions to the\ndoctrine.\nQUESTION: None of that's in question. The only\nthing that's in question is when Congress enacted this, did\nthey intend it to have the effect of -- of -- what should I\nsay -- de-immunizing, if you want to put it that way, prior\nacts or not.\nMR. COOPER: And it -\nQUESTION: We're -- we're not questioning the\nauthority of the executive or the authority of the\nlegislature or the importance of this matter. Essentially,\nthe issue is, what did Congress mean by this statute?\nMR. COOPER: And Congress in this Court has clearly\narticulated in -- in Landgraf and in the -- the several\ncases that followed it, exactly how we determined what it\nwas that Congress did as it relates to the retroactive\naspects of those changes in law.\nQUESTION: And in -- in our domestic jurisprudence,\nwe are cautious about retroactivity because it destroys\nsubtle expectations. Is that same rationale applicable when\nwe're talking about foreign sovereign immunity, or are there\nother considerations such as the dignity or -- of the\nforeign state?\nMR. COOPER: We think when the issue of a concept\nof basic fairness so close to the root of our understanding\nof what constitutes fair treatment of any individual, that\nno less standard -\nQUESTION: Well, that's why -\nMR. COOPER: -- no less rigorous standard than\nLandgraf should apply.\nQUESTION: That leads to my -- my next question.\nIf we're talking about expectations, my understanding -\ncorrect me if I'm wrong -- is that in 1948 Austria was -\nand all countries -- were on notice that immunity would be\njudged later on by acts of the executive, or in this case,\nby an act of Congress. Wasn't the expectation here that\nthere would be a later determination of whether there was\nimmunity?\nMR. COOPER: The expectation was that, based on the\ngeneral concepts of international law and general concepts\nof comity, which are not just a question of whim or\ncourtesy, but rather a question of fair treatment of one\nsovereign by another with the expectation that the sovereign\nwho is declining jurisdiction would be fairly treated in the\ncourts of other countries.\nQUESTION: But still whether or not there would be\nimmunity, Austria and all other countries knew, would be a\nlater determination, so that the expectation they had was to\nthat extent necessarily, it seems to me, diminished -\nMR. COOPER: The expect -\nQUESTION: -- or qualified.\nMR. COOPER: Expectations are only one of a number\nof factors that the Court has referred to in Landgraf.\nQUESTION: So it's -- so there are additional\nfactors other than expect. What are the additional factors?\nMR. COOPER: Well, certainly. Landgraf quoted\nJustice Story in his 1814 articulation of what was relevant,\nbut the factors are expectations, changed circumstances, and\nchanged considerations for the parties. In any case that\nincreases liability, for instance, for a particular act is\nconsidered to be -\nQUESTION: Let's just stick -- stick with\nexpectations -\nMR. COOPER: -- part of common sense -\nQUESTION: -- for the moment. Let's -- before you\nget off of expectations, I don't know that we protect\nexpectations of the sort that -- that you're talking about.\nLet's assume that a state which has not -- not previously\nallowed a tort action by -- by two out-of-state people,\nbetween two out-of-state people, to be brought within that\nstate. Let's assume they change their law and they say, you\nknow, in the future, you -- you can bring a tort action.\nDo you think that -- that we would say, you're -\nyou're disrupting people's expectations if you allow those\npersons who are -- who are the parties to a tort in another\nstate before this statute was passed to sue in the new\nstate?\nMR. COOPER: Our concepts of -\nQUESTION: What expectation, you know? I expected\nnot to be able to be sued in Virginia. As it turns out, I\ncan -- I can be sued in Virginia. Did that really affect my\naction in -- in this case? I can't believe that Austria\nwhen it took this action had in mind, oh, I -- I know that I\n-- that I can't be sued for this in the United States, I may\nbe sueable a lot of other places.\nMR. COOPER: Reliance -\nQUESTION: I'm sueable here, but I'm not sueable in\nthe United States. Who cares?\nMR. COOPER: That kind of particularized reliance\nanalysis has never been a part of this Court's retroactivity\nanalysis. It -- the Court doesn't look for purposes of\ncivil or criminal cases, can we find evidence that the\nindividual, when that individual acted, or the party, when\nthat party acted, had in mind the current state of law. The\nquestion has been as a matter of common sense understanding,\nis the new law a change in the consequences for past\nconduct? And -\nQUESTION: So you're -- you're distinguishing\nreliance and expectation? An expectation is relevant even\nthough there may be no reliance. Is -- do I understand you\ncorrectly?\nMR. COOPER: We are focused on the changed legal\nconsequences, not the subjective intention of the party in\nany respect.\nQUESTION: But is -- do -- do you articulate that\nin terms of the country's expectation, even though the\ncountry may not have relied upon that expectation when it\nacted?\nMR. COOPER: Not -\nQUESTION: Are you drawing that distinction?\nMR. COOPER: Not solely. We are not focused on the\nexpectation component of the test. We are focused\nprimarily, although I think expectations could be a factor,\nwe think that the more important aspect of the analysis is\nthe changed legal circumstances. That's -- that's the core\nof what the -\nQUESTION: And the changed legal circumstance that\nI understand you're emphasizing here is that, at least prior\nto 1976, this particular possession of expropriated\nproperty, as well as the expropriation itself, would not\nhave been cognizable in the court of any country unless\npossibly the country itself, which as an act of grace later,\ndecided to -- to make its own reparations. But subject to\nthat section -- that exception -- it would not be -- would\nnot have been cognizable anywhere?\nMR. COOPER: That's absolutely correct.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. COOPER: If there are no further questions at\nthis point, I'd like to reserve time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. McCoy -- rather, Mr.\nCooper. Mr. Hungar, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. HUNGAR\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMR. HUNGAR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nThe position of the United States has always been\nthat sovereign immunity bars U.S. courts from adjudicating\npre-1976 expropriation claims against foreign sovereigns.\nAs this Court recognized in Dames and Moore, claims by\nnationals of one country against the government of another\nare frequently sources of friction between the two\nsovereigns.\nSince 19 -- prior to 1976, therefore, and absent a\nwaiver of sovereign immunity, expropriation claims against\nforeign sovereigns have always been addressed through\ndiplomatic negotiations and foreign claims processes, and\nnot in U.S. courts. And the United States has entered into\nnumerous agreements with foreign countries regarding such\nclaims, always against and with a background understanding\nprior to 1976 that such claims could not be adjudicated in\nU.S. courts.\nQUESTION: Is -- is the friction that's feared in\npart based on changed expectations, or is that just\nirrelevant to the analysis?\nMR. HUNGAR: Changed expectations are relevant in,\nin the general sense, not the particular -- particularized\nexpectations of a particular state, but that it is a general\nrule and understanding of international laws set forth in\nthe Vienna Convention on Treaties and elsewhere that changes\nin international law, including changes in sovereign\nimmunity law, are not retroactively applied. And there are\nnumerous examples of the latter point cited in our brief at\nfootnote 14, and -- and it was an absolute rule in 1948 and\nbefore.\nQUESTION: Is the absolute rule based on the act of\nstate doctrine or on sovereign immunity? The distinction -\nMR. HUNGAR: Sovereign immunity. Sovereign -- it\nwas an absolute rule of sovereign immunity -\nQUESTION: But as you stated the proposition,\nyou're limited to appropriation claims.\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, that's what we're addressing\nhere. This -- the absolute doctrine, the doctrine of\nabsolute immunity was applicable to all claims. There is no\n-- there is not a single instance of any case or State\nDepartment determination prior to 1952 in which a suit was\npermitted to proceed against a foreign sovereign -\nQUESTION: And then that was the Tate letter, the\n-\nMR. HUNGAR: The Tate letter changed -\nQUESTION: In '52.\nMR. HUNGAR: With respect to commercial activity,\nbut, of course, this is not a commercial -- it's not even\nalleged the -- within the commercial activity exception.\nWe're not talking about commercial activity.\nQUESTION: Why is it that retroactivity -\nretroactivity causes more friction? Because -\nMR. HUNGAR: Because it would be inconsistent with\nthe understandings with which the United States and these\nforeign governments operated under with claims resolution\nagreements with numerous countries, not merely arising out\nof World War II, but out of communist government\nexpropriations and numerous agreements regarding these types\nof -\nQUESTION: But I thought part of the baseline of\nimmunity law was that other -- foreign countries such as\nAustria knew that from time to time we would confer immunity\nor not confer immunity depending on the decision of the\nexecutive.\nexpectation or this other reliance is.\nMR. HUNGAR: The -- the case that -- the doctrine\nof absolute sovereign immunity, there were no -- there are\nno exceptions. There could not possibly have been any\nexpectation or reason to believe that the executive of this\ncountry would deny immunity in an expropriation case because\nthat had never happened in the history of the absolute\ndoctrine, immunity doctrine, for 150 years. No suit, again,\nno suit in the United States has been permitted, was\npermitted to proceed on any theory against a foreign\nsovereign in personam. It was -- it would be absolutely\nunprecedented for such a suit to have been permitted prior\nto 1976, in fact, in the expropriation context. And so -\nQUESTION: Would that be true of -- would that be\ntrue of Austria itself if the tables were turned?\nMR. HUNGAR: It's unclear whether a -- a court\naction could have been brought, at least we're not familiar\nwith anything in the record that indicates whether a court\naction could have been brought in 1948, under, for example,\nthe restitution law that Austria passed in 1947.\nQUESTION: I think there was -\nMR. HUNGAR: But that's irrelevant because it can't\nbe -- the retroactivity analysis has to be a term -\ndetermined on a section-by-section, or -- or provision-by-\nprovision basis. It can't be a case-by-case, country-by-\ncountry rule.\nQUESTION: Well, it was relevant to something that\nMr. Cooper said. He said this was a matter of fairness and\nwe want others to be treated -- treat others -- treat others\nwell so that they will treat us well. That sounded to me\nlike he was speaking in reciprocity terms.\nMR. HUNGAR: Reciprocity is also an important\nconsideration, Your Honor. If this law were to be applied\nretroactively, it could open the United States to reciprocal\nclaims brought in foreign courts, which would further\ncomplicate our foreign relations.\nQUESTION: Well, how -- how does it work if in fact\nyou treat the statute as purely jurisdictional? You have\nto, one, establish jurisdiction, they have it under 1330.\nYou have to have venue, they established that. And then you\nlook to see if it's wiped out by sovereign immunity, and\n(a)(3) says this is a case in which rights and property\ntaken in violation of international law are an issue.\nRight.\nSo suppose you said, yes, that is such a case,\neven though the expropriation took place in '48 or earlier\nperhaps. Then the State Department could come in and say,\nwell, you don't win if you wanted to. You'd say, after all,\nthere first is the act of state doctrine, and this was not\nclearly in violation of international law in 1948, or you\ncould file, what is it called, it's a -- an information, or\nwhat is it, it's a suggestion of something or other -- it's\na -\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, prior to -\nQUESTION: -- statement of interest. And you say\nit's the -- there's a -- there's a foreign policy interest\nhere, and so that way the State Department's in control, and\nif it feels that it would hurt foreign affairs to have the\nsuit go ahead, it says either act of state if it's not clear\nor a statement of interest, and a -- which is a kind of\npolitical question, I guess.\nAnd so, what -- how does that, in other words,\nwhere am I wrong in thinking there's no real foreign policy\nconcern here in respect to the application of this statute\nas a purely jurisdictional matter?\nMR. HUNGAR: We believe that the -- as we said in\nour briefs, and part of the reason we're here today is that\nthere are foreign policy concerns implicated -\nQUESTION: I know, and what I want to know is, what\nwas wrong with what I just said? You see, as I was saying\nit -- did you follow it? One -\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, I'm not -- understand. We are\nhere today saying the United States has an interest in not\nhaving this expropriation exception applied retroactively\nbecause it would undermine the background assumption -\nQUESTION: I understand that and I'm trying to get\nto the reasoning. And my thought was, I don't see why it\naffects foreign affairs. You can explain why. I understand\nyou believe it does and I'm sure you're right, but I just\nwant to know why, and the reason I find it difficult to see\nwhy is because it seems to me you still, even assuming\njurisdiction, can come in and say this was an act of state,\nthis seizure in 1948, or you can file a statement of\ninterest, which I take it is saying there's a big foreign\npolicy matter here and we're working it out in other forums\nand you courts stay out of it. Now -- now am I wrong about\nthat? I'm sure you're going to say I am wrong and I want to\nknow why.\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, we don't perceive a meaningful\ndifference between an amicus brief expressing foreign policy\nconcerns, which is what we have filed, and a statement of\ninterest expressing foreign policy concerns.\nQUESTION: Ah. Well, then the correct result in\nthis case is to say yes, this statute applies, it applies to\n1948 seizures, because they were in violation of\ninternational law. Now, the State Department files a\nstatement of interest saying to the court, there is a valid\nforeign policy reason for not going ahead in this case.\nMR. HUNGAR: But the -\nQUESTION: I take it, by the way, you promised you\nwouldn't in this case, but nonetheless, all right. So -- so\nif -- that would be just up to you, so if you do it, then\nthe court will not go ahead and adjudicate this case even\nthough there is jurisdiction under the FSIA.\nMR. HUNGAR: Justice Breyer -\nQUESTION: I'm missing something, so you explain it\nto me.\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, several things. First of all,\nit's not true that we promised not to express a view -\nQUESTION: I'm sorry I brought that up. Take that\nout.\nMR. HUNGAR: That has to do with a particular\nagreement entered into in 2001 and it is certainly our\nposition that that agreement does not cover this case and\nthat was the position we took. But again, with respect to\nthe -- we are expressing the foreign policy concerns that\nI've identified, which are generalizing, go through the\nretroactive application of this statute generally. We're\nnot talking just about Austria here. There are claims and\npotential claims against countless foreign countries, many\nof whom -- many of which would involve claims that were\npreviously addressed -\nQUESTION: Some of them do not involve the act of\nstate doctrine and you want us to hold that -- that -- that\nthis would be a retroactive application of this\njurisdictional statute no matter -- no matter what claim is\nmade, whether it's an act of state claim or not. If -- if\nyou were limiting them to act of state, I could understand\nit, because that's a substantive -- a substantive matter,\nbut you want us to say no -- no suits can be brought that -\nout of actions that -- that arose before this.\nMR. HUNGAR: In principles of retroactivity, the\npresumption against retroactivity require -\nQUESTION: It's not -\nMR. HUNGAR: This is not a sub -\nQUESTION: It begs -- it begs the question whether\nit is retroactive or not.\nMR. HUNGAR: This is not purely -- no, Your Honor,\nthis is not purely jurisdictional. The fact that a -- if\nit's true that a similar type claim could have been brought\nin Austria at the time, that cannot change the retroactivity\nanalysis, because otherwise retroactivity would be\ndetermined country by country, and that fact that -- that a\nstate by -- by an exercise of grace has chosen to allow\nclaims that somehow deprive it would change the rules, which\ncan't be -\nQUESTION: Give me an example. I only have one\nquestion in this case and I've just said it and I want to be\nsure I get the best answer I can. So give me an example of\nan instance where it would hurt the foreign affairs\ninterests of the United States if the law said you proceed\nas I outlined.\nMR. HUNGAR: We have -\nQUESTION: There is jurisdiction but you are free\nto file act of state or -\nQUESTION: Wind it up.\nQUESTION: -- statement of interest.\nMR. HUNGAR: May I answer, Your Honor?\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. HUNGAR: The -- we -- there are currently cases\npending against countries such as Japan and Poland, with\nwhich -- which this country previously entered into\nagreements which both sides thought had resolved the issue\nentirely, and to now retroactively apply a substantive\nprovision that this Court recognized in Ex parte Peru is a\nsubstantive, not merely jurisdictional, but a substantive\nlegal defense, to apply that retroactively would be to\nchange settled expectations, change the rules, and it should\nnot be done.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Hungar.\nMr. Schoenberg, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF E. RANDOL SCHOENBERG\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. SCHOENBERG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nWe believe there are four independent grounds for\naffirming the lower court in this case. First, as the Court\nhas just discussed, the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act\nregulates the exercise of jurisdiction, not the underlying\nprimary conduct of the parties. Therefore, the Act does not\noperate retrospectively.\nQUESTION: Well, why doesn't it retro -- why -- why\nisn't it just as easy to say that it does operate\nretrospectively, because the question is, when should it\nexercise jurisdiction for a particular purpose? And on the\none hand there's no point in exercising jurisdiction now if\nit's not going to adjudicate later, so so far as the court\nis concerned, presumably it's going to adjudicate on a\nsubstantive issue.\nThat being the purpose, why can you -- why really\ndoes it make sense to draw that neat line?\nMR. SCHOENBERG: Well, I'm -- I'm not sure that I\nunderstand the question.\nQUESTION: Why -- why -- why isolate jurisdiction\nwhen we all know that the purpose of exercising the\njurisdiction is to exercise it for the purpose of\nadjudicating a particular kind of case and to apply a\nparticular substantive law to it?\nMR. SCHOENBERG: Because the -- the operative\nevent, the event that's being regulated by a jurisdictional\nstatute, as the Court has said, is that exercise of the\nCourt's power, regardless of when the underlying acts took\nplace, the Court has differentiated between the primary\nconduct of the parties and the secondary conduct, which is\nthe exercise of the Court's power.\nFor example, just last term in the Dole Food case,\nthe Court found that the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act is\nnot intended to chill the conduct of the foreign state.\nRather, it's there to decide whether now presently it would\nembarrass the conduct of foreign relations, and the -- 25\nyears ago, over 25 years ago, Congress decided that cases\nsuch as these should be allowed to go forward.\nQUESTION: Well, the Government of the United\nStates has just said you're going to embarrass foreign\nrelations whether the United States' position with respect\nto a consideration in interpreting this act is raised now or\nwhether it's raised after jurisdiction is assumed and you\nget to the next stage. Why not -- why not get into it now\nand consider it in interpreting the -- the scope of the act,\nin particular its retroactivity.\nMR. SCHOENBERG: This would be a much different\ncase if the foreign government had ever said that the\nprosecution of this case would interfere with foreign\nrelations, as it has in all of these other cases. But it\nhasn't in this case, it hasn't filed a suggestion of\nimmunity, it hasn't filed a statement of interest. A matter\nof fact, it required Austria to withdraw the act of state\ndoctrine defense when it was asserted below. This case\nitself -\nQUESTION: But I thought it just told us that it\nwould be an interference three minutes ago.\nMR. SCHOENBERG: The concern, as I understand the\nGovernment's concern, is that in other cases that are\npending against Japan and Mexico, et cetera, there might be\nforeign relation issues.\nQUESTION: Well, why -- why should we look further?\nIf the Government says that, I mean, isn't that conclusive\nin a case like this?\nMR. SCHOENBERG: I don't -- I don't think so. I\nthink there are two responses. First, the amount of\ndeference that is given to the Government's litigation\nposition under Bowen v. Georgetown and also INS v. St. Cyr.\nQUESTION: Well, those are not cases involving\nforeign relations.\nMR. SCHOENBERG: That -- that's correct, and that's\nwhy the second issue is very important. I believe it was\nJustice Powell who said in the First National City Bank case\nthat -- that jurisdiction is not the same as justiciability.\nAnd what the Government is talking about is a justiciability\nquestion. Does the act of state doctrine, for example,\nprevent this case from going forward?\nI'll give you another example, Your Honor. In -\nthe same district court judge who handled our case and\ngranted jurisdiction in our case, Judge Cooper, also was\ngiven a class action case asserting World War II era claims\nagainst Austria, this is the Anderman case. And just last\nApril, she threw out that entire class action, because the\nGovernment had come in and filed a statement of interest and\nasserted its interest in the -- in the case, and she found\nvery similar to the Court's holding in Garamendi last term\nthat the political question doctrine was implicated when the\nGovernment comes in and says that the prosecution of this\nparticular case will interfere with foreign relations.\nBut I've never heard any -- in any other case the\nGovernment say that a case that does not implicate foreign\nrelations, as this one does, should be dismissed on\njurisdiction grounds merely because we have justiciability\nconcerns with other cases.\nQUESTION: What -- what is it if -- what do you\nreply to their, what I take is their argument, that if we\nsay there is jurisdiction here, so that this covers pre-1952\nexpropriations, think of all the eastern European bloc, what\nused to be, millions of pieces of real estate, et cetera,\nand Japan, Peru, all over the world, South America, there\nhave been expropriations, and suddenly our Court becomes -\nbecome places where you litigate who owns property all over\nthe world, at least if you trace an interest to an American\ncitizen, for expropriations that may have taken under\nMaximilian of Mexico. I mean, see -- you see that kind of\nproblem I think is what they're trying to raise.\nMR. SCHOENBERG: Right. We're very -\nQUESTION: What's the answer to that?\nMR. SCHOENBERG: We're very sensitive to the\nGovernment's concern, the can of worms argument here. And I\nthink the answer to it is that all of those cases present\nmuch more difficult problems than this one does in terms of,\nfor example, the statute of limitations. Your Honor, the\nstatute of limitations is designed to get rid of old claims.\nIn our case, because of Austria's post-war conduct\nof concealment -\nQUESTION: All right, statute of limitations.\nLet's go on, let's list a few other things, because -\nMR. SCHOENBERG: There -\nQUESTION: -- there might be instances where the\nstatute hasn't run for all kinds -\nMR. SCHOENBERG: Right.\nQUESTION: -- of local reasons.\nMR. SCHOENBERG: There's -\nQUESTION: I don't know what the statute of\nlimitations rule is in Peru and et cetera.\nMR. SCHOENBERG: I can think of at least five\nproblems that cases, old cases, would have. One would be\nstatute of limitations. Form non-convenience may be a\nproblem. It wasn't in this case. The act of state doctrine\nwe've mentioned is also a serious problem in many of these\ncases. You have interference with treaties, which is also\nnot this case. And you have interference with executive\nagreements, which is also not this case.\nQUESTION: Can they come in and file a letter, in\nyour opinion, assume you have jurisdiction to say, look,\nJudge, we don't want you to litigate this case, it\ninterferes with our foreign affairs, period?\nMR. SCHOENBERG: Yes.\nQUESTION: They can?\nMR. SCHOENBERG: They can file that. I think it\nwould have to be considered by the -\nQUESTION: And they give a good reason, they give a\ngood reason.\nMR. SCHOENBERG: If there were a good reason why\nAustria's ownership of paintings would interfere with\nforeign policy -\nQUESTION: But that's for a court to judge rather\nthan the executive?\nMR. SCHOENBERG: Well, there's a certain amount of\ndeference that would have to be given to -\nQUESTION: But no, but you're saying that the\nexecutive could say and have -- give a good reason, and the\ncourt could say, no, we don't -- we don't approve of that?\nMR. SCHOENBERG: I think under -- under this\nCourt's doctrine in foreign affair and policy -- foreign\naffairs policy -- there is an automatic deference given to\nthe Government's suggestion that a particular case will\ninterfere with foreign policy, but in most cases I think it\nwould be quite clear. This case -\nQUESTION: Well, what -- what case is it that says\nthat the court should decide rather than the executive in a\ncase like this?\nMR. SCHOENBERG: Well, I believe, for example, in\n- in Sabbatino, the Court did not immediately accept the\nGovernment's position as to whether a case should or should\nnot go forward and said that it was -- now, I don't know\nwhether that, whether Sabbatino, in that part of Sabbatino,\nit would still be good law today. I don't think that's been\nconsidered.\nQUESTION: It -- we -- it wasn't the Court opinion,\nwas it?\nMR. SCHOENBERG: Right. It was a plurality\nopinion. But there is a suggestion, it may not be an\nanswered question, Your Honor. I'm not sure I can point to\nagain, we're talking about not our situation, because the\nGovernment has not filed any suggestion of immunity or -- or\nstatement of interest suggesting that this case would\ninterfere with foreign policy.\nQUESTION: Could -- could I ask about the act of\nstate doctrine? I mean, even -- why isn't that in play\nhere? I mean, even if giving -- holding Austria here would\nnot be acting retroactively insofar as the exercise of\njurisdiction is concerned, why wouldn't holding Austria\nliable for an act of state which previously would not be a\nbasis for -- for challenge in this country, why wouldn't\nthat be acting retroactively?\nMR. SCHOENBERG: Well, we haven't addressed the act\nof state because it hasn't been raised and it was an\nargument that was dropped. I -- I can answer the question\nthough. The act of state doctrine, as I understand it, is\ndesigned to prevent courts from entering into situations\nwhere there is no settled basis for deciding the case. In\nother words, in the Cuban cases where there's a regime that\nhas a completely different property system than ours, it\nwould be unwise for the courts to venture into this\npolitical dispute over whether communism or capitalism is\nthe appropriate way to adjudicate these cases.\nIn our case, we have a treaty, article 26 of the\nAustrian State Treaty says Austria must return property\ntaken from Jewish families during the Nazi era. So there's\nno dispute between the two countries as to whether or what\ntype of law would apply in this case. And under Sabbatino,\nit's very much qualified by the absence of a treaty\ngoverning the rule of decision.\nSo I -- I don't think this case could ever pose an\nact of state problem. Other cases do though. That -- and\nthat's -- that's really the point. These cases against\nMexico, against Japan, against Poland could potentially pose\nserious act of state problems. This particular case\ndoesn't. We'd be happy to litigate it.\nQUESTION: Whether it poses a problem or not, the\nsuit is -- is resting upon -- is challenging an act of the\nstate of -- of Austria that -- that occurred in Austria.\nMR. SCHOENBERG: That -- that's correct. Every\nsuit against a foreign sovereign that's authorized under the\nForeign Sovereign Immunities Act has the potential of\ninterfering with foreign relations to the extent that it\nconcerns the actual foreign country.\nQUESTION: Right. So the issue would be, should\nthat be given retroactive application?\nMR. SCHOENBERG: In the act of state context.\nQUESTION: Yeah.\nMR. SCHOENBERG: Well, I -- I don't think -\nmean, that's what's going on here.\nMR. SCHOENBERG: The act of state doctrine is a\nchoice of law doctrine, as I understand it, and -- and so\nit, again, is not something that really operates\nretroactively, I think. I don't think to -- to echo what\nwas said before that any country could have an expectation\nin how the act of state doctrine will apply in the\nparticular case.\nQUESTION: How about the public acts?\nMR. SCHOENBERG: I'm sorry?\nQUESTION: This is a public act.\nMR. SCHOENBERG: Well, whether it's a public or\nprivate act to collect paintings, I'm not sure is so clear.\nQUESTION: Let's assume it's a public act. Does it\nhave an expectation that -- that that will be adjudicated\nunder the then-prevailing norms?\nMR. SCHOENBERG: I -- well, yes and no. Yes in the\nsense that we do have to establish that -- that this\nproperty was taken in violation of international law, and I\nthink that part of the statute clearly expects that the\ntaking be adjudicated according to the state of\ninternational law at the time. So to that degree I think\nyes. But whether -- whether it's a public or private act I\nthink doesn't determine the -- the retroactivity question.\ncountry such acts were never adjudicated in foreign courts.\nMR. SCHOENBERG: I -- I understood that to be the\nGovernment's position. I don't know how the Government\nexplains The Santissima Trinidad case, which is a case\nconcerning private property on a ship where not one, but\nseveral, sovereigns claimed an ownership interest, and\nJustice Story said that our courts, of course, have to\nadjudicate the ownership of that private property,\nregardless of whether it was taken as part of a public act.\nIn the Santissima Trinidad, it's a confusing case,\nand I'm not sure, even having read it many times, how the\nship came to be in its final location, but as I understand\nit, it went through many different, many different hands.\nAnd the question at the end was, because the sovereigns were\nclaiming the ship, which was potentially a ship of war, does\nthat mean that the Court could not adjudicate the ownership\nof cargo on the ship? And Justice Story said no.\nQUESTION: No, but he -- isn't the -- the concern\nabout the applicability of that case to this one is\nprecisely the reason you said. It was -- it was a suit\nbetween sovereigns and we're talking here about the\nsovereign immunity defense in a suit by an individual, and\nit's rather a stretch to take that as -- as the basis for\nyour law in this case.\nthat the act of state doctrine, which is what we were\ntalking about, would -- would be implicated even more\nstrongly in a -- in a suit involving multiple sovereigns\nthan it would with regard to just an individual against a\nsovereign. And I -- I -- the Government makes the position\nI think for the first time today that the expropriation\nclause sort of appeared from nowhere, but I don't think\nthat's the case. The first section of 1605(a)(3) very\nclearly is the Santissima Trinidad case. That's the\nproperty is inside the United States in connection with the\ncommercial activity.\nThe second clause I believe arises out of the\nCuban expropriation cases and the Government's experience in\nthose cases, and it was the intention of the Government in\n1976 when the executive branch proposed this law and when\nthe Congress enacted it to allow our courts to adjudicate\nthese types of claims.\nQUESTION: Well, what -- what I'm looking for, I'm\nbeginning to understand his answer better -- I think there\nshould be a way, not in your case necessarily, but in\ngeneral, for the Government to say, court, stay out of this\ncase, because of the international implications. And what I\nwas thinking is if we -- if this is jurisdictional, follow\nJustice Powell's distinction, that won't be a problem\nbecause there'll be other ways for them to do it. You're\ngradually closing those doors.\nOne way I had thought of was act of state, but you\ncorrectly point out that the act of state doctrine does not\nbar anything when the claim rests upon a treaty or other\nunambiguous agreement, and your quoting the '55 treaty might\nnot help you because it's post-'48, but a -- but 1907 might\nhelp you, so you're there with a treaty.\nAnd so they say, well, we can't use that one, and\nthere'll be a lot of cases when we can't. So then I had\nmentioned this thing called a statement of interest, which I\nwas looking for an explanation because I don't know what it\nis. And there's a third thing that you mentioned, which is\ncalled a letter about immunity. Well, that won't help them\nbecause that's what this statute is.\nSee, so that now we're back to the statement of\ninterest. Now, can -- what is this thing, a statement of\ninterest? Can -- in other words, is the statement of\ninterest sufficient to achieve the objective that I was\nthinking was important, that not necessarily your case, but\nin many other cases there has to be a way for the executive\nto stop the judge from deciding the matter where it really\ndoes interfere with foreign relations.\nNow, what's -- do you see where I'm --\nMR. SCHOENBERG: I -\nQUESTION: Do you see that that is the thing that\nhas been floating in my mind -\nMR. SCHOENBERG: I understand -\nQUESTION: -- and I'm trying to settle on.\nMR. SCHOENBERG: I understand. It's, of course,\ndifficult for us to talk about it because there is no\nstatement of interest in this case, but -\nQUESTION: But you can explain to me what a\nstatement of interest is.\nMR. SCHOENBERG: Right.\nQUESTION: And whether a statement of interest is a\nsufficient legal route to achieve the end that I think is\nnecessary and that they're arguing for.\nMR. SCHOENBERG: I believe if -- if the Government\nwere to file a statement of interest saying that the\nprosecution of this particular lawsuit would interfere with\nthe foreign relations of the Government, I think a court\nwould be proper in abstaining from adjudicating the case\nunder the political question doctrine, very similar to this\nCourt's holding last term in Garamendi, I think.\nQUESTION: But it wouldn't have to, in your view?\nMR. SCHOENBERG: I would say it would -- it would\nbe very -- it would almost always have to. I think -- I\nthink the Court should still be allowed to determine whether\n-- whether there is really a basis for the Government's\nposition. I -- I wouldn't say that our courts necessarily\nhave to bend always to the Government's position with regard\nto a statement of interest. I think that's the -- the\nimport of the first National City Bank case and -- and -\nand the -- the Sabbatino case and Alfred Dunhill also.\nQUESTION: But I -- I take it that in no case, in\nno instance would you concede the appropriateness of -- of\nthe statement of interest being considered at the\njurisdictional as opposed to the justiciability of -\nMR. SCHOENBERG: That's -- that's absolutely\ncorrect. We're talking today only about the jurisdiction\nquestion. There hasn't been a statement of interest filed\nand there couldn't be a suggestion of immunity. I'm sorry,\nYour Honor.\nQUESTION: No, I'm sorry. What do you do about\nVerlinden?\nMR. SCHOENBERG: Verlinden actually is a great case\nfor us as I realized in reviewing it. Verlinden is -- is a\nretroactive application of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities\nAct. In that case it was a foreign company against a\nforeign state, something for which there was no jurisdiction\nin the United States prior to the enactment of the Foreign\nSovereign Immunities Act. That action arose in 1975 and yet\nwhen it was brought under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities\nAct several years later, this Court directed the lower court\nto adjudicate jurisdiction under the Foreign Sovereign\nImmunities Act.\nSo that case is exactly a -- if -- if anything is\nretroactive, that's a retroactive application of the Foreign\nSovereign Immunities Act. But again, it goes back to this\nCourt's statements in Landgraf that jurisdictional statute\nwhich confers or ousts jurisdiction is not impermissibly\nretroactive and that -\nQUESTION: Did -- Verlinden didn't expressly\ndiscuss the right to retroactivity?\nMR. SCHOENBERG: It absolutely did not discuss\nretroactivity. It maybe never occurred to any of the\nJustices or the parties at that time that a jurisdictional\nstatute like the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act could be\nin any way -\nQUESTION: No, but they -- but we did say that it\nwasn't just a jurisdictional statute. That's what we said.\nMR. SCHOENBERG: The -- the Court said that it was\nsubstantive in Republic of Mexico v. Hoffman in 1945. The\nCourt refers to sovereign immunity as substantive law. But\nI think as this Court has said, whether you label the -- the\nlaw substantive or procedural really isn't the question.\nThe question is, on what activity is -- is the statute\noperating? And here it's operating on the claim to immunity\nand how that is adjudicated by our courts in deciding\nwhether the court has the jurisdiction -\nQUESTION: But that -- that has a bearing on the\nLandgraf exception too. If a statute is more than\njurisdictional, you know, it isn't so easily disposed of\nunder Landgraf.\nMR. SCHOENBERG: It's correct, but I think this\ncase presents a much better case than the two cases cited in\nLandgraf, the Andrus case and U.S. v. Alabama, although U.S.\nv. Alabama you could distinguish as something seeking only\ninjunctive relief and therefore prospective. In Andrus,\nthis is a case brought against the U.S. Government after the\nU.S. Government -- or while the case was pending, I think,\nthe statute is changed to take away the amount in\ncontroversy requirement. So, in other words, very clearly\nbefore the suit could not proceed, now the statute's been\nchanged without any suggestion of retroactivity in the\nenactment. And the Court says -- this is 1978, I think -\nit's of no moment that this jurisdictional statute has been\nchanged now to allow a suit against in -- in a sovereign\nentity, the United States.\nSo I think this case presents actually a much\nbetter -- much better case, because here, and these are\nother points that I wanted to raise, I believe the text of\nthe Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act demonstrates that it\nwas intended to apply to all claims to immunity, regardless\nof when the acts took place, the underlying acts took place.\nOur -- our third point -\nQUESTION: May I just ask you on that, I mean,\nisn't the objection to that that the -- that the subject\nmatter we're concerned with here is a subject matter which\nis defined in terms of property and the history of that\nproperty, and the history of that property as expropriated\nnecessarily raises the time question? And if the time is\nprior to the -- the enactment of the statute, we\nnecessarily, by the definition of present subject matter,\nget into an issue of retroactivity. What -- what's the\nanswer to that?\nMR. SCHOENBERG: Well, the answer is, again, in\nLandgraf that not every statute which affects prior events\nis impermissibly retroactive, and my point was -\nQUESTION: But it's not impermissibly retroactive,\nbut it raises the question about the permissibility of a\nretroactive application.\nMR. SCHOENBERG: Well, I -- my view is that the\nForeign Sovereign Immunities Act is -- is a statute that is\ndesigned to take away the immunity decision from the State\nDepartment and place it in the hands of judges, and the\npurpose of the statute was that henceforth all claims to\nimmunity should be adjudicated under this procedure, not the\nold procedure. In other words, the U.S. Government's\nposition should -\nQUESTION: Yeah, but even -- even that, with\nrespect, it seems to me that that begs the question. The\ncourt is going to adjudicate. The question is whether in\nadjudicating them it is going to draw a line based on -- on\n-- on this temporal consideration. That still leaves it in\nthe hands of the court. But the question is whether in the\nhands of the court retroactivity ought to be a basis for\nmaking the jurisdictional decision.\nMR. SCHOENBERG: I -- I don't -- I don't see -- I\ndon't think that it is with regard to the text of this\nstatute. I -- even though the statute does refer to events\nthat could take place prior to the enactment, the purpose of\nthe statute, which is what I think the analysis requires\nthat we consider, is to change the forum of the adjudication\nfrom the old State Department procedure to the -- to the\ncourt procedure under these specific rules.\nQUESTION: How does your -- the discussion about\nthe statement of interest then fit in? It seems to me what\nyou just said is, they meant to take it away from the State\nDepartment and put it in the hands of the court.\nMR. SCHOENBERG: The -- the immunity consideration,\nyes, but I think the statute, the Foreign Sovereign\nImmunities Act, was not intended to change the rules, for\nexample, with the act of state doctrine or with the statute\nof the limitations or with any of the other doctrines that\nmight bar an older claim from -- from entering court.\nOur third point, this I don't want to spend too\nmuch time on, but it's our view that the Foreign Sovereign\nImmunities Act merely codified the common law of sovereign\nimmunity, and therefore, it did not substantially change the\nlaw. And this is not only my opinion. If one looks at the\nState Department circular that was sent out in 1976 to\nforeign states, it says, this enactment will not\nsubstantially alter the rules for deciding sovereign\nimmunity questions in U.S. courts. So it was the position\nof the State Department at the time that they proposed this\nlegislation that it merely codified what the State\nDepartment then considered to be the rules of sovereign\nimmunity.\nAnd we have an interesting situation, I think an\nunprecedented situation, because the common law itself\ndepended on the views of the State Department, so we have a\nlittle bit of a reflexive situation. The way I look at it,\nlet us suppose, for example, that the -- that instead of\nenacting the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act they issued\nanother Tate letter, another letter that merely said,\nhenceforth we want the courts to adjudicate things under\nthis -- under this regime. So it's not a new statute, it's\njust a suggestion to the courts on how to decide cases.\nUnder this Court's ruling with regard to common\nlaw, non-statutory law, of course that -- that approach\nwould have to be applied retroactively, and I don't think\nit's any less retroactive just because the executive branch\nsent it over to Congress and said, we want you to pass the\nstatute also. Our last -\nQUESTION: Any -- any more retroactive?\nMR. SCHOENBERG: Any more retroactive. Our last -\nour last point is really the basis for the Ninth Circuit's\ndecision, and that is, as to these parties in this case,\nthere is no impermissibly retroactive effect, because\nAustria could never have had any expectation of immunity\nwith regard to Mrs. Altmann's claims.\nQUESTION: That would be a pretty good nightmare,\nwouldn't it, if we had to have judges trying to work out on\na case-by-case basis, country by country, whether Turkey in\n1921 when it was an enemy, had a -- didn't have an\nexpectation of being treated as a sovereign, but Hungary in\n1962 had a different expectation, et cetera. I mean, that\n- that -- I think their point on that's a pretty good one,\nisn't it?\nMR. SCHOENBERG: Well, it -- it's -- but it's not a\npoint about retroactivity, Your Honor. The -\nQUESTION: Well, it is because they're saying that\nunless you treat these things as a whole, you won't\nunderstand the problem. And even if in your case the\ncountry had no expectation, there are so many countries that\ndid that -- and going into it case by case is so difficult\nthat it would better to have an absolute rule. That's their\narguments.\nMR. SCHOENBERG: It would be better, but that's not\nreally how the Court's retroactivity analysis has gone over\nthe last 10 years, and that's -- that's why I certainly\nfavor some of the earlier arguments. I think it's easier to\ndecide the case on those, rather than the way the Ninth\nCircuit did in evaluating the expectations, but if one\ndoesn't decide in our favor on all of those other arguments,\nthat the statute itself is jurisdictional, that Congress\nintended it to apply, that there's really no change in the\nlaw because it's the same as the common law of sovereign\nimmunity, then really under Hughes one has to look at\nwhether, as to the parties of this case, there is any\nretroactive effect, and that -- that's -- that's what the\nHughes holding is. It's a statute phrased jurisdictionally,\nbut let's look at what happened here. You have a new\nplaintiff with new incentives and a defense, substantive\ndefense taken away. That's the Hughes case.\nAnd so it requires you to look outside the four\ncorners of the statute to look at what was -- what are you\ncomparing the statute to, when -- when in Hughes the Court\nsaid if it determines whether a cause of action can proceed\nand not where, the where question, of course, implies that\nyou have to look and see if there are other jurisdictions\nwhere the case could be brought.\nAnd in this case, as we've made very clear,\nAustria could always have been sued, at least since it was\nre-established after World War II for these acts, and as a\nmatter of fact, Austria was required by the United States to\nenact restitution laws that were designed to afford people\nlike Mrs. Altmann relief. They have never asserted\nsovereign immunity in these claims in their own courts and\nthey would not have been allowed to by the U.S. Government,\nand that sentiment, of course, is echoed in the subsequent\ntreaty in 1955 and it's echoed in the Bernstein letter in\n1948 that as to expropriations, as to property taken from\nJewish families in violation of international law, this\ncountry does not recognize sovereign immunity anywhere, not\nin the states where -- where -- that were involved, and not\nin the United States, and that -- that's -- that's our last\npoint and that's the Ninth Circuit's position.\nIf the Court has no further questions -\nQUESTION: Is it -- is it correct that -- that we\nwould be out of step with all other countries if we -- if we\nallowed this suit to proceed?\nMR. SCHOENBERG: Well, certainly not as a matter of\n-- of the statute.\nQUESTION: No, no. I mean -- I mean, have -- have\nall other countries, when they've changed to the new modern\nnotion of limited sovereign immunity, have they all declined\nto -- to apply it in a manner that the Government here would\ncall retroactive?\nMR. SCHOENBERG: Right. I -- I don't know how all\nstates have done it. I know that, for example, in Austria\nwe cited the Dralle case, which concerned a post-war\ncommunist expropriation of a -- of a subsidiary company in\nCzechoslovakia, and a German company was allowed to sue\nCzechoslovakia in Austria concerning the trademarks and -\nand the expropriation, and have an Austrian court rule\nwhether that expropriation violated international law.\nSo I would say as to Austria, the argument is, and\nI think we cited also in our brief a statement by an\nAustrian professor, Seidl-Hohenveldern, who said that the\ncourts -- there's nothing in international law that prevents\ncourts from adjudicating the rights and property taken in\nviolation of international law.\nThank you very much.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Schoenberg.\nMr. Cooper, you have five minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT P. COOPER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. COOPER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Just on\nthat last point, the Dralle case, which is one that we\naddress in our reply brief, does not stand for the\nproposition that Czechoslovakia's expropriation could be\nsecond-guessed in Austria. Quite the contrary. Austria\ndetermined that the legality of Czechoslovakia's activities\nin their own -- in its own country were not subject to\nreconsideration in Austria. Austria concerned itself only\nwith whether, given its own neutrality as between\nCzechoslovakia and Germany, whether Austria could give\neffect to an expropriation as an act of war. And it\ndetermined that it could not with respect to property\nlocated in Austria. That issue has nothing to do with\nwhat's before the Court today.\nSovereign immunity isn't merely a form selection\nrule. It confers on the foreign state the right to choose\nwhether and where to be sued. That's a substantive right.\nIt's a right this country has always understood as a right\nin a sovereign. Austria's choice, if it did so choose, the\ncircumstances under which it would provide remedies in its\nown country, either by statute or in its own courts, doesn't\nconstitute a waiver of the sovereignty to which it had been\naccorded in this country throughout the current period up to\n1976.\nSo this country has always recognized the\ndifference between a sovereign's right to create a remedy,\nand this country has done so in its own instances with\nrespect to events that were claimed to be the subject of\nreparations, and by doing so it has never suggested that it\nthought it was subjecting itself to the jurisdiction of a\nforeign court for individual claims to be able to look for\nmore than the statute of the United States provided for.\nIn addition, with respect to the law immediately\nprior to the enactment of the FSIA, I think the suggestion\nwas that somehow the United States had -- had eroded the\nexpropriation rule or that Congress thought that it was\nadopting the -- codifying the law of the land with respect\nto expropriation in the FSIA, and that plainly is not true.\nThe legislative history, and more importantly the statements\nof the State Department, in particular the -- the digest by\nJohn Boyd with respect to State Department decisions from\n1952 to 1976 cited in our brief make it clear that the State\nDepartment considered this to be a fundamental change in the\nlaw.\nThe conduct being regulated here is expropriation\nor at the very least possession that goes back to events in\n1948 alleged in the complaint. It is not the mere question\nof the exercise of jurisdiction here or, worse yet, this\nmere substitution of another tribunal. This is something\nthat Congress focused on in each of the expropriation\nexceptions. It identified the conduct that it thought the\nforeign sovereign had engaged in that justified one of our\nnarrow exceptions to the general concept of foreign\nsovereign immunity.\nWhether that was an express waiver under (a)(1),\nwhether that was the exercise of commercial conduct that any\nprivate party could engage in under (a)(2) or the -- or the\nexpropriation of property in violation of international law\nin (a)(3), Congress identified the conduct that it thought\njustified the lifting of the generally applicable foreign\nsovereign immunity and decided that's the conduct we want to\nregulate. And that's what we think justifies the variance\nfrom our general rule with respect to sovereigns, and that\nis a change in the law that requires application of the\nretroactivity analysis to treat those sovereigns fairly.\nIf there are no further questions, I have nothing.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Cooper.\n"
