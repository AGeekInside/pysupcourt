Young v. the United\nStates.\nMr. Clark.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GRENVILLE CLARK, III\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. CLARK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nThis is a case about discharging taxes in a\nbankruptcy proceeding.\nThe Bankruptcy Code provides that income taxes\nthat are more than 3 years old are discharged in a\nbankruptcy proceeding. In the petitioner's case, the\nYoungs filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceeding in March of\n1997, some 3 years, 5 months after they had filed their\n1992 income tax return in October of 1993. The Bankruptcy\nCode provides, on this simple set of facts, that the\nYoungs' 1992 income tax obligation is discharged. The\noperative code sections are 727, 523, and 507, which I set\nout at pages 10 and 11 of my brief.\nQUESTION: Well, they also filed an earlier\nbankruptcy petition, didn't they?\nMR. CLARK: They did indeed, Your Honor. That\nwas filed in May of 1996. It was a Chapter 13 proceeding.\nIt lasted just short of 6 months, and the -- the argument\nthat the IRS has tendered in this case and below is that\nyou subtract out the 6 months they are in the prior\nproceeding from the calculation of the 3 years, 5 months,\nand when you do that, you come out with the Youngs ending\nup with being only 2 years 11 months away from the 3-year\nmark --\nQUESTION: Well, why was the first Chapter 13\npetition dismissed?\nMR. CLARK: It was dismissed at the behest of\nthe Youngs for a variety of reasons that did not appear in\nthe record. During the Chapter 13 proceeding, they had\nsucceeded in selling their house and paying off mortgages\non the house that had -- they had placed on there. Later\non in the proceeding, they had gone through the trouble of\nengaging special counsel, an attorney Noreen Farr, to do\nsomething which does not appear in the record. But they\nfinally decided that they would dismiss the case rather\nthan go forward with it. The reasons that they did not --\ndo not appear in the record.\nThey dismissed the case about 3 weeks before\nthey would have gotten to confirmation of their plan,\nwhich they had submitted earlier in the case.\nQUESTION: But there was also the fact that they\n-- in addition to dismissing the Chapter 13, the day\nbefore that order was entered granting the dismissal at\ntheir request, they started a new bankruptcy proceeding.\nThey started a Chapter 7 proceeding, and that way they\nwere able to stretch out the stay of any effort the\nGovernment might have made to collect the tax.\nMR. CLARK: The -- the bankruptcy -- the Chapter\n13 bankruptcy proceeding was dismissed. The final closing\norder in the case was entered in March of 1997. The\nmotion that -- or the request, I think, that the Youngs\nhad filed was in October of 1996, October 23, 1996. It is\nour position that the automatic stay expired as soon as\nthe case was dismissed and not later when the case was\nclosed a number of months later. And I think that is\nsignificant because in our view the IRS was entitled to\nrestart their enforced collection efforts against the\nYoungs --\nQUESTION: Do you have authority for that, for\nsaying that -- that it's not the date that the bankruptcy\nwas closed, but some -- the earlier date when they -- when\nthey made that motion?\nMR. CLARK: Yes. It's in the Bankruptcy Code\nitself, section 320 -- yes -- I'll have to get the --\nQUESTION: Is the filing of the notice of\ndismissal, which was October 23?\nMR. CLARK: Yes. It's the filing of the notice\nof dismissal, and that we contend is the dismissal.\nWhat happened subsequent to the -- the filing of\nthat notice is the Chapter 13 trustee held some funds that\nhad been paid in. He sought to apply for an\nadministrative expense, and that was put on for a hearing\nand eventually it was granted. And then thereafter the\nclerk's office closed the case in March of 1997.\nQUESTION: Did anyone object to the notice of\ndismissal?\nMR. CLARK: Not in a -- not in a Chapter 13\nwhere the debtor seeks dismissal. The debtor has the\nabsolute right to seek dismissal of his Chapter 13 case\nbecause it's a voluntary proceeding.\nQUESTION: You used the term seek dismissal,\nmove to dismiss in October, and then the proceeding was\nactually dismissed in March. Are you saying that your\nsimple motion to dismiss is the same thing as having it\ndismissed?\nMR. CLARK: Yes, I am in this situation, Mr.\nChief Justice, because of -- the bankruptcy rules are a\nlittle -- were a little vague at that point in time.\nWhether you seek a dismissal by simply filing a, quote,\nrequest or moving for a dismissal, the rule says that upon\na request for dismissal, the judge shall dismiss it. In\nthis particular case, the judge did not actually enter an\norder of dismissal. It simply accepted the dismissal as\nentered or requested in October of 1996.\nQUESTION: Well, this whole sequence of events\nseems a bit gimmicky.\nMR. CLARK: Well, if -- if there are gimmicks,\nif somebody is trying to manipulate the system, to game\nthe system, certainly the Government -- any party in\ninterest who was affected by the gaming, the manipulation\n-- can object, can take -- can move to dismiss -- to\nconvert the case, for example, which --\nQUESTION: I thought there was a finding of good\nfaith here, wasn't there?\nMR. CLARK: Yes, there was, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Was it a finding of good faith or --\nor a finding that he was making no finding of bad faith?\nMR. CLARK: No. The -- the judge below, Judge\nVaughn in the Bankruptcy Court, found in favor of the\nGovernment, suggesting that there was a potential, in\nsimilar cases such as this, for abuse or manipulation by\ndebtors in general. But in this case, Judge Vaughn had\nfound that he attributes no bad faith to the Youngs in\nthis particular situation, and I think that's an important\nfact.\nThe Government, when it objected to --\nQUESTION: Is it bad faith to look for a tax\nloophole? I think thought that's what all the tax\nattorneys always did.\nMR. CLARK: It's certainly not in our view bad\nfaith to look for a tax -- for a way to get a grant of a\ndischarge of an obligation that you formerly owed.\nQUESTION: Do you think that that's what the\njudge meant -- meant by not attributing bad faith? He\ndidn't even think that your client was legitimately trying\nto take advantage of a tax loophole? That -- that's what\nI took it to mean.\nMR. CLARK: The case -- Justice Scalia, the case\ncame before the court, before the Bankruptcy Court, on a\nmotion for summary judgment by the motion -- by the\nGovernment. The -- there was no findings of fact as such\nother than those that were on summary judgment. The --\nwhat the -- I see Judge Vaughn has -- as finding is that\nhe sees no evidence before the court from which he would\ninfer any manipulative or abusive scheme.\nQUESTION: Well, would it be manipulative or\nabusive just to take advantage of the provision of the\nstatute?\nMR. CLARK: No, Your Honor, it would not be.\nQUESTION: So, the finding doesn't make any\ndifference one way or the other, does it?\nMR. CLARK: When bankruptcy -- bankruptcy\ndebtors take advantage --\nQUESTION: You're just saying you have a\nstatutory right to do what you did.\nMR. CLARK: That's exactly right, Justice --\nQUESTION: Why should we read the statute\nregardless, when it's good faith or bad faith, as allowing\nthe following? We look back 3 years to see how much money\na bankrupt filer owes the Government. He's going to have\nto pay it. Let's say it's $100,000. He dismisses that\nafter a number of years, the first bankruptcy, then brings\nthe second bankruptcy proceeding and says, well, if we\nlook back 3 years from the second one, this $100,000 I\nowned -- I owed falls outside that period. It's simply a\nwindfall to him because he brought two bankruptcy\nproceedings rather than one, and it's a loss to the\nGovernment for no reason other than his having brought two\nbankruptcy proceedings rather than one. It serves no\npurpose whatsoever that I can fathom in the bankruptcy\nstatute, and what purpose is there in reading the statute\nto permit such a result?\nMR. CLARK: Justice Breyer, you would have to\nlook at what happened in the prior bankruptcy I think to\nsee why the debtor was able to stay in bankruptcy for the\nlength of time that the debtor did and thereby supposedly\nprevent the Government from collecting taxes from the\ndebtor.\nA chapter -- usually the prior bankruptcy is a\nreorganization bankruptcy, a Chapter 13, possibly a\nChapter 11. During the Chapter 13 proceeding, that had --\nhad a long life, the debtor had to propose a plan that had\nto pay the taxes that the debtor owed in full over the\nlife of a plan, whether that be 3 years, 4 years, 5 years,\nwhatever it was. The plan has to go to confirmation. If\nthe plan is confirmed, all the plan payments that have\naccumulated to that point are now paid out to the\nGovernment and to other creditors in accordance with the\nplan. Plan payments that follow on still go to the\nGovernment and to other creditors as designated in the\nplan. The Government is getting money here during the --\nduring the prior bankruptcy proceeding.\nYes, a person can file for bankruptcy, submit a\nplan. It might be a 5-year plan. They get the plan\nconfirmed. They make payments for 3 years and then they\nelect to dismiss. That is their right to -- to dismiss.\nQUESTION: Do they get the payments back if\nthey --\nMR. CLARK: No. No, Your Honor, they do not.\nThe -- the plan payments have been paid to the Government\nall throughout the 3-year period. They have a confirmed\nplan. Once you have confirmation, the confirmation order\nreleases the money to the -- the payees, the creditors,\nincluding the Government.\nQUESTION: How much of the -- how much of the\ntax liability did the Government receive during the course\nof the first bankruptcy?\nMR. CLARK: In the Youngs' case, the Government\ndid not receive any payments whatsoever. The Youngs'\nChapter 13 lasted about -- just short of 6 months. They\nhad not filed that tax case, that Chapter 13 until 2 and a\nhalf years after they had filed their tax return. They --\nbut they did not receive any payment because we did not\nget to confirmation in the Youngs' case.\nQUESTION: Did you -- did you seek confirmation?\nMR. CLARK: The confirmation hearing had been\nset by the court at the outset of the case, and it was\nscheduled for November 15 of --\nQUESTION: But it was -- it was the debtors'\nvoluntary action that stopped the Government from getting\nany payments under that plan.\nMR. CLARK: It was -- in this particular case,\nyes, Your Honor --\nQUESTION: Could the judge --\nMR. CLARK: -- for the -- because they had not\ngotten to confirmation.\nQUESTION: When the debtor asked to have the\nChapter 13 dismissed, could the judge have said, I will\nenter the dismissal order, the closure order, but only on\ncondition that you do not attempt to assert a time bar,\nshould you -- as everybody knew was -- that was going to\nhappen, go into a successive bankruptcy proceeding? Did\n-- would the judge have any authority to do that?\nMR. CLARK: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. Under, I\nthink it's section 349 of the Bankruptcy Code which\ngoverns dismissals, the judge certainly has the authority\nto put conditions upon the issuance of the dismissal.\nQUESTION: Well, then why is the dismissal\nautomatic, which is what we talked about at the very\nfirst?\nMR. CLARK: Well, because the debtor -- I think\nthe procedural problem here is because the request -- the\nrules, at least at the point of this request for dismissal\nwas -- was made, were a little vague as to how you request\nor move for a dismissal.\nQUESTION: All right.\nMR. CLARK: But the debtor has the absolute\nright to request the dismissal.\nThe effect of the dismissal the judge can impose\na condition on to say, well, yes, we're going to dismiss\nthe case, but we're going to enter an order that says you\ncannot count the 6 months that the Youngs were in\nbankruptcy.\nQUESTION: Well, the debtor -- the debtor has a\nright to reject that condition and say, if that's the\ncondition, I don't want to dismiss, I assume. And if\nthat's so, then the dismissal is not automatic. I mean,\nyou can't have it both ways.\nMR. CLARK: I don't -- I think the --\nQUESTION: If he has a right to reject that\ncondition, then once you say the judge may impose a\ncondition, you have to say that -- that dismissal does not\noccur automatically once you request it.\nMR. CLARK: I think in that --\nQUESTION: You can't have it both ways.\nMR. CLARK: I -- I'm not saying it's -- I think\nwhat I'm saying is that the court has the ability to put a\ncondition on it. If the judge -- if the debtor doesn't\nwish to accept it, it's going to have to withdraw the\nmotion to dismiss.\nQUESTION: Right, and we don't know, until the\njudge enters an order of dismissal, whether he's going to\nput a condition on it. So, how can you say the dismissal\nis automatic as soon as you request it?\nMR. CLARK: I'm saying it's -- Justice Scalia,\nI'm saying it's automatic in the sense that the -- the\ndebtor has an absolute right, quote/unquote -- and that's\nnot an absolutely absolute, but the debtor has a right\nunder Chapter 13 to have his case dismissed.\nQUESTION: No, but -- no, but you say he doesn't\nbecause the judge can say, I'll let you dismiss it if.\nWhereupon, the debtor can say no -- no deal. So, it's not\nan absolute right.\nMR. CLARK: Well, it's -- I think it is an\nabsolute right or nearly so. I don't think that putting a\ncondition on it makes it less of -- of an absolute right\nto dismiss.\nQUESTION: But it doesn't mean that you can't\nequate the date that you file the motion to dismiss with\nthe termination of the Chapter 13. It can't be. If the\njudge could put a condition on it, then the -- the 13\nproceeding doesn't terminate until the closure order is\nentered.\nMR. CLARK: I think the -- well, I don't know\nthat the judge could withhold or -- or delay the entry of\na dismissal order. It could put a condition on it that\nthe time in Chapter 13 won't count against the --\nQUESTION: Let's say we disagree with you and we\nfind --\nQUESTION: Have you cited any cases in which\nthis kind of condition was imposed?\nMR. CLARK: I do not know of any cases where, in\na Chapter 13, a condition has been imposed.\nQUESTION: So, this is totally speculative,\nreally, I think. I would assume if the -- if this problem\nhas occurred as many times as the Government says it has,\nand if the solution that you suggest is available, I would\nhave thought some judge would have thought of it.\nMR. CLARK: Well, I think no -- no judge is\ngoing to impose the condition I think under section 349\nunless the IRS comes in and makes a motion or brings it to\nthe attention of the court that --\nQUESTION: But then the lawyers have never had\nenough sense to do this, as I understand it.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. CLARK: Well, they've gone a -- the\nGovernment I think has gone on a different track on -- on\nthis issue.\nQUESTION: The answer is no.\nMR. CLARK: The answer is no, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: In -- in all events, let's assume\nthat we think that the dismissal occurs in -- it would be\nMarch 13. Does the difference between October and March\nmake a difference in this case?\nMR. CLARK: No, it does not, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: All right. So, it doesn't make any\ndifference.\nMR. CLARK: This -- we got into this in the\ncourt of appeals a little bit, but it really makes no\ndifference whatsoever in the computation.\nQUESTION: Mr. Clark, can I get your\nunderstanding of what you think would be manipulation?\nBecause it may have something to do with my view of -- of\nthis case. You don't assert that -- that somebody can go\ninto a Chapter 13 proceeding with the -- with the avowed\nintent of not carrying it through to completion and of\ndismissing it in order to get the benefit of -- of the --\nthe shorter lookback.\nSuppose -- suppose I open a 13 proceeding and I\nhave no intention -- I propose a plan. I have no\nintention of completing that plan. I ask the court to\napprove it. From the beginning, I have no intention of --\nof going through to the end of it. Isn't that a fraud on\nthe court?\nMR. CLARK: I would -- I would never -- I would\n-- I agree with you, Judge Scalia. It would be a -- an\nabuse of the bankruptcy process.\nQUESTION: And if that were shown, I suppose\nthere's no doubt that the -- that the Bankruptcy Court in\nthe later proceeding could disallow the -- the shortening\nof the lookback period because of that fraud.\nMR. CLARK: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Okay. So, we're talking here only\nabout cases in which someone in good faith, at least as\nfar as the IRS can approve, commences a 13 proceeding, and\nthen for -- for some -- some plausible, good reason,\nbefore it is concluded, dismisses. Is that how you --\nMR. CLARK: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- understand the situation?\nMR. CLARK: Yes, it is.\nQUESTION: Whose burden is it to show that there\nwas some reason other than just getting advantage of the\nautomatic stay? Do you have to put in any evidence to\nshow that? I mean, you're suggesting -- I guess Justice\nScalia's question -- that there should be a fact question\nin every case as just what was the motivation of the\npetitioner who file the Chapter 13 proceeding.\nMR. CLARK: I think there has to be -- if -- if\nsomebody is charging that there is an abuse, there has to\nbe some factual determination that there's an abuse. The\n-- under section 105, even the bankruptcy judge himself,\nsua sponte, can look at this and enter orders if he\ndetects abuse. And bankruptcy judges happen to be rather\ngood at this. They -- they see cases that emit an odor,\nif you will, and they are not reluctant to get involved in\nthat.\nQUESTION: So, suppose the bankruptcy proceeding\nis commenced with the intent ultimately of getting the\ndischarge, but there's also the intent to do it in two\nsteps. You say, I'm going to -- I want -- I want to get\nChapter 13 or Chapter 13 -- 11, but I'm just going to do\nit in two steps. Is -- is that -- that abuse of process?\nMR. CLARK: No, I don't believe so, Justice\nKennedy. Here's what happened --\nQUESTION: I don't understand the question.\nQUESTION: The hypothetical is I -- the bankrupt\nintends to get a bankruptcy discharge, but he also intends\nto do it in two steps. He intends to have a Chapter 13,\nwait for 3 years, and then after a very short interval,\nrefile under 7. And then hypo two is under 13.\nI take it you can do it under 13? Couldn't you\nhave two successive 13?\nMR. CLARK: You could have -- you could have --\nQUESTION: And your argument would be the same.\nMR. CLARK: Yes, Your Honor, it would --\nQUESTION: In either of those cases, would that\n-- would that be abuse of process in your view?\nMR. CLARK: Not in my view, Justice Kennedy, and\nhere -- here is why. If you're going to go -- if you're\ngoing to go into Chapter 13 and stay there for 3 years,\nyou're going to get a plan confirmed during the course of\nthose 3 years. You better, sure as heck, get a plan\nconfirmed during those 3 years. And you will be -- once\nthe plan is confirmed, payments are going to be made to\nthe IRS for those 3 years. It may or may not pay off the\ndebt to the IRS in full during the 3 years, but it is the\ndebtor's best effort, according to the Chapter 13, to be\npaying those dollars. So, it's not as though the IRS is\ngetting nothing in this -- in that hypothetical situation.\nQUESTION: But if -- if taxes had been paid\nduring the Chapter 13 proceeding, wouldn't they have to\nhave been returned on the dismissal of that proceeding?\nMR. CLARK: If there -- Justice O'Connor, if\nthere were no confirmation order entered prior to the\ndismissal --\nQUESTION: Right, as was the case here.\nMR. CLARK: -- which was the Youngs' case. Yes.\nQUESTION: As was the case here. So, presumably\neven if something had been paid in for the taxes, they\nwould have been given back on the dismissal.\nMR. CLARK: Yes. The magic moment in Chapter 13\nis the entry of the confirmation order, and once the\nconfirmation order is entered, whatever plan payments the\ntrustee has already accumulated, because the --\nQUESTION: Well, why -- why do you think it's\nimproper to equitably toll that lookback period for this\nsituation?\nMR. CLARK: I -- I do not think it is proper at\nall to -- I -- there are several reasons why I think it's\nimproper.\nFirst of all, the language of the statute itself\nis very plain and straightforward and has no provision for\nequitable tolling or any tolling.\nQUESTION: We have held that equitable tolling\napplies in similar statutes which have no provision for\nequitable tolling.\nMR. CLARK: Yes, I'm -- I -- I know that the --\nI know that you have, Mr. Chief Justice.\nQUESTION: Well, I -- I thought your point is --\none of your points was that statutes of limitations are\ndifferent from this, that this is not a statute of\nlimitations.\nMR. CLARK: It's -- my point is that it is --\nthis is a part of the definition of which taxes can be\ndischarged in bankruptcy. There are several time elements\nto defining which taxes can be discharged in bankruptcy.\nThere is this 3-year lookback period. There is a 2-year\nperiod where a taxpayer has filed a return late and then\nwe go to a 2-year lookback. And then there's a third 240-\nday period that the taxpayer/debtor must satisfy and that\nis 240 days from the date of assessment. Now, the debtor\nmust meet all three of these to be able to discharge the\ntaxes.\nIn the Youngs' case, the taxes were assessed\npromptly, about 2 and a half months after they filed their\ntax return. They clearly met that one. The -- they did\nnot file a late return because they got extensions to file\ntheir return in October of 1993. So, they -- that one\ndoesn't apply. And the only one in question in this\nparticular case then is the 3-year, and how do you measure\n3 years and do you toll the 3 years for the period of the\nprior Chapter 13.\nQUESTION: Mr. Clark, is the Government correct\nin -- in pointing out that the debtor here could, instead\nof seeking dismissal of the 13 and starting a 7, simply\nhave moved to convert the 13 into a 7? Is that correct?\nMR. CLARK: That is correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: If -- if the debtor had done that,\nthe 3-year period would continue to have been calculated\nas it originally was under the Chapter 13 proceeding.\nMR. CLARK: Yes, Justice Souter, that is\ncorrect.\nQUESTION: Would -- would it have been error if\n-- if the judge or any judge in a case like this, when --\nwhen confronted with a motion or a request to dismiss,\nsimply questioned the debtor whether it was the debtor's\nintent to start a Chapter 7 proceeding, and if the answer\nwas yes, for the judge simply to say, well, I will treat\nyour motion as a motion for a conversion and we'll grant\nthat? Would that have been error on the judge's part?\nMR. CLARK: I think it would be error for a\njudge to take a motion to dismiss a Chapter 13 and make it\na chapter -- and say, we are going to make it instead a\nChapter 7 case.\nQUESTION: Even when the debtor says, yes, my\nplan, my intent is to -- is to initiate Chapter 7\nproceedings.\nMR. CLARK: Yes. Justice Souter --\nQUESTION: The -- I take it the only harm to the\ndebtor in that case would simply be the -- the argument\nabout the 3-year lookback because the debtor would be\ngetting exactly otherwise exactly what the debtor wanted,\ni.e., a Chapter 7 filing.\nMR. CLARK: Yes, Justice Souter. But keep in\nmind in the -- in the case of either dismissal or\nconversion, in the example in the Government's brief, the\n-- it does not do any good to seek conversion -- I'm sorry\n-- to dismiss and then refile unless you're toward the end\nof the 3-year period in any event. So that when the case\nis dismissed, now the 3-year period has expired, and now\nyou go the next day and you file your Chapter 7, saying,\nwell, I've been -- it's been now more than 3 years since\nthe filing of the return.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. CLARK: But in the meantime, of course, the\nplan payments are being made, hopefully, to the Government\nand to other creditors for the 2 years and however many\nmonths.\nQUESTION: Well, that -- that's so. But, I\nmean, even in the case in which there has been a\nconfirmation under -- under the Chapter 13 and plan\npayments have been made, it may very well be that the\namount of tax liability that has actually been paid could\nbe minuscule, so that it would be very much in the\ndebtor's interest to -- to start a new Chapter 7 and save\nwhatever the balance due is on the taxes.\nMR. CLARK: Well, except that, Justice Souter,\nthe problem is that the tax payments are not going to be\nminuscule during the Chapter 13.\nQUESTION: Well, whether they're minuscule or\nnot, if they're not 100 percent, the debtor still gains\nsomething by going -- so far as the Federal taxes are\nconcerned, by dismissing and starting a Chapter 7 because\nwhatever the balance due is, in -- on the facts of a case\nlike this, the -- the debtor is going to -- going to\nobtain.\nMR. CLARK: That is correct, Justice Souter.\nBut again, I would point to the fact that the Government\nis getting something. It may not get the whole amount.\nAnd in tax collection in general, apart from bankruptcy,\neven when bankruptcy is not in the picture at all, the way\nthe Government is trying to collect taxes is through\ninstallment payments as the Youngs --\nQUESTION: Well, that's right. But I think the\nGovernment's answer to that is unless we, in fact, make a\ncompromise agreement, we're entitled to 100 cents on the\ndollar. And the -- the fact that -- that the Government\nmay get 50 cents on the dollar before you go from 13 to 7\nI -- I don't think really disparages the Government's\nargument any.\nQUESTION: Or it can be, as it was here, the\nGovernment got nothing.\nQUESTION: The Government got nothing.\nMR. CLARK: The Government did get nothing in\nthis situation, Justice Ginsburg, for the 6 months.\nQUESTION: And would there -- in -- in this very\ncase where the Chapter 7 was started the day before the\nChapter 13 was closed, was there any advantage, other than\nwiping out the lookback period, to instituting two\nproceedings rather than having the 13 converted to a 7?\nMR. CLARK: Well, the reason the Chapter 7 was\nfiled was because I think other creditors were descending\nupon the Youngs. They had dismissed their Chapter 13 back\nin October, and that, of course, put everybody back into\nthe status quo ante, except with respect to the sale of\ntheir house, of course. But the creditors now were free,\nonce the case has been dismissed, to come forward again.\nQUESTION: Well, we're getting into filing\nversus dismissal.\nMR. CLARK: Yes.\nQUESTION: But if -- if we take the order of the\ncourt as what counts, there wouldn't have been any period\nin which other creditors could have jumped in because the\nChapter 13 hadn't yet been closed.\nSo, from the point of view of the debtors here,\nwas there any advantage that they gained other than wiping\nout the lookback period?\nMR. CLARK: With -- with the filing of the\nChapter 13, they obviously gained the advantage also of\neliminating their other debts.\nQUESTION: I mean, when they got to the point of\nsaying we're not going to make it under this plan, so\nwe're going to have to quit the 13, at that point they\ncould have done -- either asked for conversion to 7 or\nstarted a new proceeding. Is there any difference from\ntheir viewpoint other than they'd get the benefit under a\nreading of the statute of putting the Government out of\nthe picture because the 3-year lookback has run?\nMR. CLARK: I'm not quite sure I understand the\nquestion, that they -- Justice Ginsburg. I think they --\nthey get the -- when they -- when they dismiss and then\nrefile, they obviously get the benefit of discharging\ntheir other taxes in -- their other debts, non-tax debts.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Clark.\nMs. Millett, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES\nMS. MILLETT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI would like to address first the -- there's\nbeen some discussion about protections that maybe or maybe\ncould not occur in a Chapter 13 proceeding to prevent the\n-- the Government from losing its claim. And in fact,\nthat rarely, if ever, is capable of happening because we\ndon't know -- debtors don't telegraph to us at the time\nthey're in Chapter 13 or dismissing their Chapter 13 --\nthat they plan to file a second bankruptcy. And if you\ndon't know that's going to happen, you can't prove bad\nfaith. You can't ask for conditions, or it would be\nvirtually impossible to do that.\nQUESTION: Well, sure you can. You can ask the\nbankruptcy judge to inquire and -- and say if -- if that\nis the plan, Your Honor, we -- we request that it not be\ndismissed but rather converted.\nMS. MILLETT: I think --\nQUESTION: Or that that be a condition of -- of\nthe dismissal that you not -- that you not refile.\nMS. MILLETT: I think there's two difficulties\nwith that approach, and the first that it would be an\nenormous burden in every Chapter 13 case that is filed and\nthen sought to be dismissed -- and an awful lot -- the\nvast majority are -- to have that inquiry undertaken.\nAnd secondly, there is -- there is no authority\nunder the code that we're aware of that allows a court to\ncondition -- a voluntary dismissal, which they have as of\nright, on willingness to forego a discharge in a future\nbankruptcy proceeding.\nQUESTION: But, I mean, let's assume someone has\nin all good faith commenced a Chapter 13 and has in all\ngood faith dismissed it because, part the way through it,\nsaid, you know, I think I can make it on my own now, and\n-- and then, you know, sometime after that, decides, no, I\ncan't make it and -- and files another bankruptcy\nproceeding under 7. No bad faith. You would still want\nto alter the 3-year lookback in the statute to make it --\nto make it what? 5 years or whatever.\nMS. MILLETT: We would -- we would want the\n3-year lookback period to tolled during the time the\nautomatic stay prevented us --\nQUESTION: That's not what the statute says.\nThere's no fraud here. There's -- there's nothing going\non. You're just saying here's a loophole in the tax law\nor the bankruptcy law, that aspect of the bankruptcy law\ndealing with taxes. I'll call it a tax loophole. And\nyou're saying, you know, courts, repair this loophole.\nThat's not what courts normally do.\nMS. MILLETT: Well, as the Chief --\nQUESTION: I mean, that's the fun of practicing\ntax law.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Bankruptcy law.\nQUESTION: You take all the joy out of it.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. MILLETT: That's what we do.\nAs the Chief -- as the Chief Justice pointed\nout, in fact, equitable tolling -- in virtually every case\nthat I'm aware of, equitable tolling is applied when the\nstatute is silent, and in fact when it may provide\nspecifically for tolling in other circumstances, as\noccurred in Bowen v. City of New York and American\nPipefitters v. Utah. And equitable tolling has not --\nnever been held to turn upon the existence of bad faith.\nQUESTION: This is not equitable tolling in --\nin the statute of limitations sense. What is involved\nhere is not the termination period for bringing a cause of\naction, but rather the quite different question of when\ntaxes will be discharged and when they don't. Congress\nprovided for, you know, a 3-year lookback. In some\ncircumstances, they get the benefit of -- of less than\nthat if -- if they brought the two -- but at least, where\nthere's been no fraud, at least where you haven't been\nable to show that -- that they were gaming the system\nintentionally, I don't see why equity should -- should\ncome -- there is legislation pending to close this gap,\nisn't there?\nMS. MILLETT: There is and there has been for a\nnumber of --\nQUESTION: Well, I don't know why we don't leave\nit to Congress.\nMS. MILLETT: Well, Your Honor, there's --\nthere's a number of responses to that. And the first is\nwe would respectfully disagree that this is not\nsufficiently analogous or akin to a statute of limitations\nthat the First Circuit described in this case to merit\nequitable tolling. A time period does not have to be a\nstatute of limitations to be tolled. In Zipes v. TWA, in\nHonda v. Clark, this Court has applied equitable tolling\nto other types of time limitations, and within the\nbankruptcy context, which is a specialized context, this\nlookback period has the same operation and effect as a\ntraditional statute of limitations. It prevents the\nassertion of stale claims, stale claims defined as ones\nthat the Government has allowed to linger. It -- it\nextinguishes a claim if the period does lapse as\neffectively as a bar on the time limitations.\nQUESTION: It doesn't extinguish it. The -- the\nGovernment is just thrown in with the other -- with the\nother creditors, isn't it? I mean --\nMS. MILLETT: Well, this --\nQUESTION: -- they may come out without any\nmoney, but it's just -- the -- the question is whether the\nGovernment is going to have the preferred position of not\nhaving its debt discharged. It will be thrown in with the\nother general creditors.\nMS. MILLETT: That's not entirely correct,\nJustice Scalia, for -- for -- in two ways. First of all,\nthere are two -- there are two aspects to the priority.\nThere's a priority as against other creditors, but what is\nat issue here, and again what is at issue in virtually all\nof these Chapter 7 cases, or these no -- no-asset Chapter\n7 cases, is the discharge. That's what's at issue here,\nand the discharge is -- does extinguish a claim as much as\na bar on -- on filing.\nQUESTION: Well, I know, but it -- but it\ndischarges the Government's claim just the way it\ndischarges the general creditors' claims. The Government\nis thrown into that pot instead of having the preferred\nposition that you can pay off everybody else 3 cents on\nthe dollar, but not the Government. All that happens is\nthe Government goes in with the other creditors. Isn't\nthat --\nMS. MILLETT: Taxes have always been different.\nAnd the -- the treatment of this is simply a 3-year --\n3-year period that -- that the debtor has to run out, and\nit doesn't afford the Government any capacity to enforce\nthe claim would be, I think, an extraordinary assumption\non the part of Congress.\nQUESTION: Well, what is your -- what is your\nmain argument? Is it to ask us to apply the principle of\nequitable tolling to this section 105 lookback provision?\nMS. MILLETT: Section 507.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMS. MILLETT: Yes, that is -- that is our --\nthat is our submission. The Congress --\nQUESTION: And what's your best case for that?\nMS. MILLETT: The body of equitable tolling\ncases, but the most analogous one I think is Honda v.\nClark -- Clark and Burnett v. New York Central Railroad,\nboth of which are cited in our brief. Honda v. Clark\ninvolved not a traditional statute of limitations, but the\ntime for filing proofs of claim under the Trading with the\nEnemy Act, which was specifically modeled on the\nBankruptcy Act. And there -- there the Court held that it\nwould be equitably -- equitably -- the time period would\nbe equitably tolled --\nQUESTION: Why isn't that a traditional statute\nof limitations?\nMS. MILLETT: I'm sorry?\nQUESTION: Why isn't that a traditional statute\nof limitations? Your claim is invalid unless you file it\nwithin a certain period.\nMS. MILLETT: Well, within the bankruptcy\ncontext, in fact a claim can still be paid as long as it's\non the schedules. The filing of a proof of claim does\nnot --\nQUESTION: No, I'm not talking about this case.\nI'm talking about the case you're citing us as -- as being\nanalogous to this one. You said it didn't involve a\ntraditional statute of limitations. Why did that not\ninvolve a traditional --\nMS. MILLETT: The -- the reasoning of the Court\nin Honda v. Clark was -- was that Congress modeled -- the\nproof of claim there may have been closer to an actual\nstatute of limitations, but the rationale the Court\napplied was looking to the treatment of proofs of claim in\nthe Bankruptcy Code, and that was the analogy that\nCongress was drawing at the time it enacted the Trading\nwith the Enemy statute, and that those proofs of claim --\nit was in the bankruptcy context --\nQUESTION: Maybe, but Trading with the Enemy\nstatute itself contained what was a statute of\nlimitations, and in the case at hand, we were equitably\ntolling what was effectively a statute of limitations.\nWhat's your other best case?\nMS. MILLETT: And Nassau Smelting v. Refining\nWorks, which is discussed in Honda v. Clark, was a\nbankruptcy case where the proof of claim was not filed\nuntil a year after the deadline and the Court allowed\nparticipation nonetheless. And again, it's the nature of\nthe proof of claim that's --\nQUESTION: Those are also -- the difficult issue\nI think in this case is exactly what Justice Scalia has\nbeen saying, that this isn't a traditional statute of\nlimitations. You have to do one of two things. You\neither have to say the word 3 years shall be read 3 years\nplus days tolled. That's one thing you could do. Or the\nsecond thing you could do is you could look to 105(a) and\nyou could say that the order that can be issued is an\norder pay money -- this is in the section 7 -- pay money\nas if this were the section 13 that hadn't been dismissed.\nNow, both of those, the question would be, does\n-- does the judge have the authority to do that? And\nlooking simply to statute of limitations provisions\ndoesn't answer that question. It -- it provokes the\nquestion. It proves you might be right, but -- but the\nworrying thing is whether you can just stick those words\nin, either plus days tolled, or read 105(a) in so broad a\nmanner.\nSo, those are the -- I'd like to know what\nshould we do and what's the authority for that.\nMS. MILLETT: To take the first -- the first --\nfirst scenario first, the proposition for reading the\n3-year lookback period as 3 years plus --\nQUESTION: Plus days tolled.\nMS. MILLETT: 3 years plus. In deciding what\nthe character of the lookback period is, whether it's akin\nto the statute of --\nQUESTION: Could you speak up a little bit, Ms.\nMillett?\nMS. MILLETT: In deciding what the -- the\ncharacter of the lookback period is, equitable tolling\ndoes apply in Zipes in filing a proof of -- filing of a\nclaim with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\nThere the Court described it as similar to a statute of\nlimitations, but it was not a statute of limitations. So,\nequitable tolling does not require --\nQUESTION: Which case was that?\nMS. MILLETT: Zipes v. TW -- Trans World\nAirlines.\nThat does not require the presence in the actual\nstatute of limitations. It has to be a time limit. If\nthe question is whether Congress would have intended that\ntype of time limit to be subject to tolling principles.\nAnd the -- we can either assume the lookback period would\nhave for many of the policy reasons that have been\ndiscussed -- the -- the conclusion that results if we\ndecide that it is not something that Congress would have\nintended to be subject to equitable tolling is that the\n3-year lookback period is an empty gesture as far as\nprotecting the Government. The Congress --\nQUESTION: You have no problem convincing me\nabout what I'd call the equitable merits of your side.\nThe problem you have, as far as I'm concerned, is how to\nwork, which route do we take and what's the authority for\ndoing it, just what I asked in the first place.\nMS. MILLETT: And that is I think -- and it's\nboth prongs of your -- of your question. It is -- we\nthink that the nature of the time limitation is\nsufficiently similar within the bankruptcy context. This\nis how you enforce claims within the bankruptcy context.\nQUESTION: Well, I don't think it is similar. I\n-- I -- I mean, the only thing -- the only respect in\nwhich it's similar is that it involves time, but all of\nthe other cases that -- that you refer us to, the statute\nof limitations proper, Zipes, they're all cases in which\naction by the party seeking to enforce something is\nlimited by a period of time. He has to do it within a\ncertain time or else it's no good. Now, whether you call\nit proof of claim or anything else, that's -- that's the\nscenario.\nIn this case, it's -- it's not a matter of\nwhether the Government has filed in time at all. This\nlookback is quite a -- quite a different animal. It's how\nfar back you -- you can go in -- in deciding which claims\ncannot be discharged in bankruptcy.\nNow, it involves time. I guess, if you think\nthat's enough of a commonality, then -- then I'd agree,\nbut gee, I -- I don't think that's enough to -- to make me\nthink that we have the -- the authority by long tradition\nto rewrite a statute so that where it says 3 months, it's\ngoing to be 3 months -- 3 years, it's going to be on our\nauthority 3 years plus some other period of time.\nMS. MILLETT: I think this is exactly the\nsituation that you described. It's like a typical statute\nof limitations, and that is unless the Government takes\naction within 3 years to enforce its claim, unless it acts\nwithin those 3 years, it will, for all intents and\npurposes and all practical purposes, within the unique\ncontext of bankruptcy proceedings, have no claim left. It\nwill be discharged. There's nothing --\nQUESTION: But it's not a limitation on the\nGovernment's action within 3 -- it doesn't say the\nGovernment has to act within 3 years. It says when you\nhave a bankruptcy proceeding, you look back only 3 years.\nIt has nothing to do with how soon the Government has to\ncome forward. The Government has absolutely no control\nover that lookback.\nQUESTION: If the Government comes forward after\n3 years, it loses.\nMS. MILLETT: That's right. It eliminates --\nand the legislative history describes this quite -- from\nCongress' vantage point that this was an enforcement\nperiod, a collection time, and that -- that if the -- it\nwould eliminate stale claims, which this Court said in\nZipes is one of the purposes of a statute of limitations.\nIt would -- it would extinguish liability if the\nGovernment doesn't act within the particular period of\ntime, which again is akin to a traditional statute of\nlimitations. The --\nQUESTION: I have one -- one technical question.\nI should know the answer. Suppose before the Chapter 13\nproceeding is commenced, the Government says, oh, we've\ngot a lot of taxes here and this debtor may file Chapter\n13. Can you file a lien against his property which\nsomehow protects you?\nMS. MILLETT: If we -- if we have assessed the\ntaxes, which in itself requires a 90-day period as a\nmatter of law, but if we have assessed the taxes, which we\nhad here, we can go file a notice of federal tax lien\nwhich would protect us.\nWhat happened in this case --\nQUESTION: And that would protect you.\nMS. MILLETT: That would protect us, but it's\nimportant to keep in mind how tax collection works. The\nIRS, as a matter of policy and as a matter of some\nstatutory provisions, tends not to descend immediately\nupon taxpayers the second there's a liability.\nIn this case, we had been working with the\nYoungs, and they had been making some payments. And it's\nroutine for us to try voluntary compliance. It's good\npolicy and that's what we do, and it wasn't -- we tried\nto --\nQUESTION: If you -- if you imposed a lien,\ncould you still work with the taxpayer? The lien doesn't\nprohibit you from trying to work it out, does it?\nMS. MILLETT: We -- we could have, but it\ncertainly has some consequences for -- for the taxpayer.\nAnd -- and again we -- we try -- we try to work these\nthings out without going to that sort of adversarial level\nof proceedings. And there had been payments being made\nhere.\nBut if I could get back to Justice Breyer's --\nQUESTION: And just -- just so I get the\ntechnical --\nMS. MILLETT: Sure.\nQUESTION: But once the Chapter 13 proceeding\ncommences, you --\nMS. MILLETT: We cannot impose --\nQUESTION: -- cannot impose a lien.\nMS. MILLETT: Absolutely not. That's part of\nthe automatic stay.\nIf I could get back to Justice Breyer's\nquestion. What we think is important here is -- is the --\nthe combination of the two factors that you discussed is\nthat this is sufficiently like a statute of limitations,\nand Congress intended it to operate like a statute of\nlimitations, and it does operate like a statute of\nlimitations within the bankruptcy context. And we've\ncombined that with the unique equitable powers the\nbankruptcy courts have and the unique operation of\nequitable principles within the bankruptcy context. So,\nit's not an either/or. I think the combination of those\nis a sufficient reason as to why tolling of this lookback\nperiod would be appropriate.\nQUESTION: Ms. Millett, Mr. Clark said in his\nbrief that, well, if you're going to do this for taxes,\nthe same logic would apply to wage claims that have a\npriority. What else did he say? Employee benefit claims.\nIs that -- is that so?\nMS. MILLETT: Those are the only two nontax\nprovisions that have these type of --\nQUESTION: So, could you --\nMS. MILLETT: -- lookback periods. And I -- I'm\nassuming that it would, in fact, apply. I -- I haven't\nanalyzed -- the same analysis would apply and assuming\nthat the same congressional purpose would be shown and the\nconsistency of congressional purpose to apply equitable\ntolling -- it would apply there.\nIt doesn't actually happen to be a problem in\nthat area because those -- for two reasons. Those types\nof -- those two claims involve very, very short time\nlimits, 90 and 180 days, not 3 years. And so, in order to\navail themselves of this procedural roundabout, they would\nhave to file two bankruptcy proceedings very closely on\ntop of each other, and that just doesn't happen.\nQUESTION: Well, as they did here.\nMS. MILLETT: No. I mean, they would have to\nfile their first one, and then within 3 months to get out\nof the 90 days, you'd have to file another one. This --\nthe first one lasted I guess approximately 6 months.\nQUESTION: Ms. Millett, there is legislation\npending to do what? How is it drafted?\nMS. MILLETT: It -- it is drafted to provide for\ntolling of the lookback period during the pendency of --\nduring the time an automatic stay in a prior bankruptcy\ncase.\nQUESTION: As an amendment to section 105 or\nwhat?\nMS. MILLETT: I think it's to section 507, which\nis -- 507(a)(8), which is what provides the lookback\nperiod itself. But that legislation --\nQUESTION: Is it part of the overall Bankruptcy\nCode revision?\nMS. MILLETT: It is. It has not been --\nQUESTION: You know, the big bill.\nMS. MILLETT: The big bill.\nQUESTION: Which may or may not go anywhere.\nMS. MILLETT: Which may or may not go. There\nare -- there is -- there are, you know, different bills\nbefore Congress. They've both been passed. Conferees\nhave been appointed. They aren't fighting over this\nprovision, but there are lots of other provisions that\nthey are in disagreement over.\nI also think it's important to keep in mind what\n-- what we would have to assume Congress intended were we\nto read the lookback period as something not subject to\ntolling. Now, there have been some suggestions that\npeople like to avail themselves of tax loopholes. That's\nusually done to decide how much taxes you owe.\nWhat we're talking about here is an admitted\nacknowledged tax liability that they want to get out of\npaying and that -- that we want to hold that -- that\ndebtor --\nQUESTION: Well, if you were the lawyer for the\nGovernment faced with a taxpayer that had a big tax\nliability and it looked like bankruptcy might be looming,\nwhat would you advise the Government to do?\nMS. MILLETT: Depending on this Court's holding,\nthere -- I have to say in all candor the volume -- the\nsheer volume of cases that the IRS handles in bankruptcy\nmakes much -- and it's handled often at the initial\nstages, as it was here, not by lawyers, but by special\nagents in the bankruptcy proceeding. I think we would\nhave to go to a system where we would go to the tax liens\nimmediately, but that's not what --\nQUESTION: No doubt, but absence that, what is\nthe best way for the Government to protect itself, do you\nthink?\nMS. MILLETT: To immediately as soon -- as soon\nas they assess, immediately file a tax lien. And -- and\nthat's -- normally we go -- there are administrative --\nother administrative means of collection. We try to work\nthings out. We have offers in compromise, and there's no\nreason that Congress would have intended our tax system to\ngo that way and to be driven by these bankruptcy\nprocedures.\nAgain, to get back, we're talking about whether\nthe lookback period --\nQUESTION: Well, that's how they wrote it. I --\nI mean, you say -- Congress often does not enact perfect\nstatutes. It -- it leaves some holes that it should have\nthought about and -- and we don't normally think it's our\njob to patch it up. I -- I agree with you. I -- I find\nit unlikely that Congress intended this to work this way,\nbut it is just one of the eventualities that they didn't\nhave in mind, and that's why we have things called\nstatutory amendments. We -- we don't run to the courts\nand ask the courts to fix them.\nAnd -- and I'm just very leery of extending our\n-- our powers, the equitable powers that we've used in the\npast, for extending statute of limitations, tolling\nstatute of limitations to this quite different situation\nof a lookback. I -- and there are other lookbacks in the\nInternal Revenue Code and there are other time provisions,\nand I -- I'm not willing to say whenever there's a time\nprovision, it's an invitation to us, if -- if Congress\nhasn't foreseen every problem, to adjust it.\nMS. MILLETT: I think -- I think that given the\nequitable powers of bankruptcy courts, most of those --\nmany of those time limits are in fact considered to be\nsubject to equitable tolling that are in the Bankruptcy\nCode, although I don't know that this Court, other than\nthe proof of claim context, has ruled on the question.\nBut in deciding -- Congress legislated against\nbackdrop principles of equitable tolling. In deciding\nwhether this is the type of thing that should be subjected\nto equitable tolling, this Court made clear in American\nPipe & Construction v. Utah that it's a question of -- of\ncongressional intent, not whether you think the provision\nis substantive or procedural.\nAnd we think congressional intent drawn from the\nstructure of the statute, the network of tolling\nprovisions, limitations on filings, conversion rules, to\nthink that all of those were put in by Congress not to\nprotect the Government's enforcement period but simply to\nchannel debtors into one particular procedural route for\nnot paying taxes is a highly unlikely assumption.\nAnd to think that Congress would -- to read the\nlookback period as intentionally empowering debtors not to\nfight about how much taxes they owe, but to take an\nadmitted tax liability and say that because of what we do\nin bankruptcy, not because of anything the Government did\nin becoming a creditor or in enforcing its claim, we get\nto decide that you will not have prioritized status. You\nwill have, in some cases, not a minute of enforcement\nactivity, and we don't have to pay our taxes. That makes\nthe Government not like other creditors at all, not at the\nsame level, but in the -- the States and Federal\nGovernments will be in the worst position of anyone in\nbankruptcy. We don't get to choose our debtors. We don't\nget to seek the security in advance, and we will have no\ncapacity to enforce, other than at the mercy of the debtor\nwho initiates these proceedings.\nAnd I think -- I understand this isn't a perfect\nfit with the statute of limitations, but I think taking\nthose considerations and the -- the consequences of\naccepting the alternative view of the lookback period, the\nimplausible assumptions that would assume Congress made\nand the implausibility of this operation of the statute as\na whole combined with the traditional equitable powers of\nBankruptcy Court and the role of equity in these\nproceedings, all of that packaged together is sufficient\nto allow this Court to toll a lookback period and\neffectuate Congress' intent, which -- which is --\nQUESTION: May I ask you a question about your\nview of the automatic tolling statute? As I understand\nthis case, the notice of dismissal of the Chapter 13\nproceeding was filed in October, and the actual dismissal\nwas not until March 13 of the following year. And it was\nthe day before that that they filed the Chapter 7 so there\n--\nMS. MILLETT: That's right.\nQUESTION: -- was the base of their changing\ntheir mind or something like that.\nIs it your view that the automatic stay was in\neffect between October and March?\nMS. MILLETT: Absolutely, and --\nQUESTION: Because I think your opponent seemed\nto suggest maybe that wasn't so.\nMS. MILLETT: Right. In 1307(b), which is the\nprovision that allows automatic -- it's 11 U.S.C. -- that\nallows voluntary dismissal by the debtor, provides that\nthe -- that the debtor may -- may ask the court, but that\nthe court shall dismiss the case. And so, until a case\nhas been dismissed or closed, neither of which would have\nhappened under this provision until March, or a discharge\nhas been granted, which obviously did not happen in this\ncase, the automatic stay remains in effect. And we were\nunable to do any -- take any steps to enforce our claim.\nQUESTION: And is it true that in this case\nthere was some kind of report filed on February 2? So,\nthere was activity in the case.\nMS. MILLETT: There was. A trustee had filed a\nreport, and there had been -- the court set time when it\ngot the -- the notice, it set the time for the hearing on\nthis or time for action on this. So, it was in fact --\nand again, if -- if we're going to suppose that courts can\nimpose conditions on these dismissals, that would again\nrequire -- assume that the case is alive and is still\nbefore the court.\nBut I think the statute is quite clear that it\n-- that the debtor doese not dismiss the case; the court\ndoes. And that didn't happen until March.\nAnd again --\nQUESTION: Are you aware of any cases of this\nkind in which the court has imposed a condition relating\nto this problem?\nMS. MILLETT: No, and again because I think the\nstatute doesn't --\nQUESTION: Doesn't authorize.\nMS. MILLETT: I don't want to say it doesn't in\ncase we get to some situation where we might want to try,\nbut it doesn't seem to -- clearly to allow that and I\nthink it would be extraordinary reading of the Bankruptcy\nCode to think that a court can impose, as a condition on a\nvoluntary dismissal that's entirely within the discretion\nof the debtor to seek.\nQUESTION: Well, that --\nMS. MILLETT: We do not accept --\nQUESTION: That -- that brings me to this\nquestion. Suppose I thought that section 105(a) was the\nbest basis for an authority for a tolling rule under the\nabuse of process. Would it follow that the tolling rule\nhas to be on a case-by-case basis to determine if they're\ngood faith, or can I say because of abuse of process,\nwe're going to have a general tolling rule?\nMS. MILLETT: The Court has the authority to\nimpose uniform rules of equitable tolling. It did that in\nthe Burnett v. New York transportation case. That was a\nFederal employer liability action --\nQUESTION: But is that consistent with my\nassumed approach of just hinging the rule on the abuse of\nprocess?\nMS. MILLETT: I think what it would be\nconsistent -- equitable tolling as -- equitable estoppel\ntends on the behavior of bad faith of the person who's --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMS. MILLETT: -- here the -- the debtor.\nEquitable tolling turns upon the legal disabilities\nimposed on the person who wants to enforce their claim.\nAnd that isn't going to change from case to case, as in\nBowen v. City of New York where this Court again applied a\nclass-wide rule of tolling because the Government's\nactions with the Social Security plaintiffs in that case\nhad been the same.\nQUESTION: Your argument doesn't hinge on bad\nfaith, anyway, as I understand it.\nMS. MILLETT: No. No, it doesn't.\nQUESTION: You -- you assert that -- that\nwithout the tolling, we would frustrate Congress' intent\neven where there has been no bad faith, that Congress\nwould not have intended where there's good faith to give\nthe person an added -- an added couple of years of -- of\nno taxes.\nMS. MILLETT: Of no taxes or to get out of\npaying their taxes or to relegate the Government to this\nlowest subsidiary position within the bankruptcy process.\nBut uniform rules have been applied by this\nCourt when that circumstance doesn't change, and in this\ncase for purposes of equitable tolling, what's not going\nto change is that the Government hasn't had the time\nCongress gave it in the statute. That's going to be the\nsame.\nBeyond that, amount of tax liability shouldn't\nmatter. That's a judgment for -- for Congress and the\nGovernment to take. It's not -- it shouldn't -- equitable\ntolling shouldn't turn upon that, and the bad faith or\ngood faith of the taxpayer wouldn't be determinative.\nAnd in that regard, I think it's important to\nkeep in mind that if we had a test where we had to show\nbad faith in every one of these cases, again we're talking\nabout an enormous volume of bankruptcy cases. And -- and\nshowing -- in those -- in those circuits where they have\napplied this sort of case-by-case equitable tolling, the\nGovernment has had to be very selective in which cases it\ndecides to make that showing, giving a lot of people a\npass on taxes. And those proceedings can take 9 to 12\nmonths. You have to have discovery and full-blown\nhearings on people's faith and intentions and that really\nis not what the purpose of the Bankruptcy Code is for.\nQUESTION: Ms. Millett, would you remind me? I\nthink that Congress wanted the Government to have 3 years,\nand that was a cutting back on what the Government had\nbefore. Right?\nMS. MILLETT: Absolutely.\nQUESTION: They said, we gave you too much.\nWe're now giving you 3 years.\nMS. MILLETT: Absolutely, and that's why I think\nit -- it's extraordinary to think that Congress --\nCongress went to the steps that you would have to decide,\nif you decide this is not a collection period and akin to\na statute of limitations, because prior to 1966, these tax\nclaims, regardless of age, were all entitled to priority\nand were all nondischargeable. And what Congress did in\n1966 was decide it was going to balance competing\ninterests within the bankruptcy process and condition the\nGovernment's entitlement to that special status on its\ndiligent enforcement of those tax claims. And that is why\nit's like a statute of limitations.\nBut to hold otherwise is to say that what\nCongress went to in 1966 was a situation where everything\nwas protected to where nothing is protected except at the\nsole discretion and choice of the debtor proceeding in\nbankruptcy. The Government will be left with no capacity.\nWe can't choose our -- we can't choose our debtors, and we\nwill -- and they have the entire authority to prevent any\nenforcement. And we're not just talking about enforcement\nof claims that arose before they filed bankruptcy. If you\nhave bankruptcy proceedings that go on for more than 3\nyears, as many do, this -- this rule would apply to tax\nclaims that arose while the case was in bankruptcy and the\n3 years ran.\nAnd that in fact is what has happened in a case\nwe have pending in the Fifth Circuit. If they can\ndischarge not just the things that you may have had a few\nmonths before -- or a year before the bankruptcy was\nfiled, tax claims that we have never had a millisecond\noutside the freedom of the automatic stay to enforce will\nbe extinguished, not because of anything the Government\ndid or did not do, but solely because of the procedural\nsteps taken by the debtor in Bankruptcy Court.\nAnd we think it's extraordinary to think that\nthat's what Congress did and intended to do in 1966. The\n-- it went for that transformation. And statutes aren't\nto be construed to assume that Congress would imperil\nState or Federal revenues.\nQUESTION: Of course, I don't think anybody\nsuggests that Congress intended the result. The question\nreally is whether -- assume we know exactly what Congress\nintended. Do we have the authority to fill a gap in the\nstatute anyway without, you know, the express text?\nMS. MILLETT: And I think equitable tolling,\nparticularly in the context of traditional equity courts\nlike bankruptcy and traditional equity proceedings, is\nappropriate. Again, in American Pipe, this -- thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Ms.\nMillett.\n"
