MONAHAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. MONAHAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nPetitioners Keith Smith and Shirley\nSperlazza were not named plaintiffs in the prior Federal\nproceeding litigated by George McCollins. They never\nreceived notice of that prior proceeding; they never\nreceived an opportunity to appear and be heard; they\nnever received an opportunity to opt out; and they never\nreceived an opportunity to appeal the decision denying\nclass certification.\nNo precedent of this Court would justify\ntreating -- treating people as parties under preclusion\nprinciples under these circumstances. Recently, in\nTaylor v. Sturgell, this Court addressed the rule\nagainst nonparty preclusion and discussed the recognized\nexceptions. The Court in that case discussed a properly\nconducted class action as being one of the exceptions.\nThe Court, in discussing these preclusion\nrules, noted that they are limited by due process\nconcerns, and the Court noted that the properly\nconducted class action is an exception due to the due\nprocess protections incorporated into Rule 23.\nObviously, this Court has discussed the due\nprocess protections with class actions in prior cases,\nparticularly those dealing with 23(b)(3) classes in\ncases such as Eisen and Shutts. The Court has noted\nthat whenever a class is certified notice must be\nprovided; the right to -- notice must be provided; they\nmust have the right to appear and be heard in person or\nby counsel; they must have the right to opt out as well\nas protection of adequate representations.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, suppose a class action\nbased on diversity is filed in one of the Federal\ndistricts in West Virginia, and the district court\ndenies class certification. The same plaintiff, the\nsame plaintiff's attorney, takes the old complaint,\nwrites in the name of the new named party, files exactly\nthe same complaint in another Federal -- in the other\nFederal district in West Virginia. Would your argument\nbe the same? That can go forward, get another shot at\nclass certification?\nMR. MONAHAN: Your Honor, under the -- yes,\nunder those circumstances, as outlined by -- by Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: All you have to do is get\na new named plaintiff?\nMR. MONAHAN: Yes, as long as it's not the\nsame party. If it's a different party -- and that -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And it could be the same\nattorney?\nMR. MONAHAN: Yes, it could be the same\nattorney. This Court noted that in Taylor v. Sturgell,\nin South -- South Central Bell v. Alabama, and also as\ndiscussed in the Richards case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Would the -- would the\ndecision that's saying -- saying Rule 23 standards have\nnot been met, the individual issues predominate over the\ncommon issue -- doesn't that deserve some measure of\nrespect when the same thing is tried again?\nMR. MONAHAN: Yes, Your Honor, but that\nwould be under stare decisis principles, we believe, and\nthat's the situation, since it is a different party,\nsince it's not the same party itself. And, certainly,\nthe district courts in West Virginia would look to other\ndistrict courts' opinions and would likely render them\npersuasive -- or consider them persuasive under those\ncircumstances.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But they have no obligation\nto follow another district court opinion, do they?\nMR. MONAHAN: Technically, no, Your Honor.\nIf the Fourth Circuit, for instance, had spoken on the\nmatter, though, and it was something that was decided by\nthe Fourth Circuit, or of course by this Court, then\nclearly they would. And the -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And this one was\ndetermined by the multidistrict panel, right?\nMR. MONAHAN: Yes. Yes, a district judge in\nMinnesota. Yes, Your Honor.\nInterestingly, in Taylor, this Court noted\nthat adopting a broad theory of virtual representation\nbased upon an identity of interests, adequate\nrepresentation, and a close relationship would -- would,\nin essence, be equivalent to adopting a de facto class\naction or recognizing a common law class action without\nany of the procedural due process protections provided\nby Rule 23.\nObviously, in dealing with these cases, the\nmain reason a certification is -- the main reason the\ndue process protection is provided upon certification is\nto go ahead and justify binding the class members to any\njudgment issued by the court at that point. Until you\nhave that, unless you have the certification and the due\nprocess protections for a Rule 23(b)(3) class, until you\nhave those, the absent class members remain strangers to\nthe proceeding.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the absent class\nmembers retain their individual right. I mean, they are\nnot being precluded as to their individual claim. It's\nonly they can't be a class representative.\nMR. MONAHAN: That's -- that's true, Your\nHonor. We submit, however, that any procedural rights\nwhich have been recognized and adopted -- those\nprocedural rights, just as the substantive claim itself,\nhave to be adjudicated consistent with due process. And\nWest Virginia itself has adopted Rule 23 of the West\nVirginia Rules of Civil Procedure, and that State has\nthe right to apply and interpret that rule as it sees\nfit to manage its own docket and administrate its own\ndocket as it sees fit.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Am I right to read the\nsupplemental brief as saying that now the West Virginia\nSupreme Court agrees with the multidistrict panel on\nwhat the content of West Virginia law is?\nMR. MONAHAN: That's not correct, Your\nHonor. All of the issues raised in our petition for\ncert remain just as they were. At worst -- if White v.\nWyeth withstands petition for rehearing, at worst we\nlose our CCPA claim. That certainly is a valuable claim\nto us. I will not dispute that. But we also have a\ncommon law fraud claim. We also have breach of warranty\nclaims, and those are still in existence.\nAnd the critical fact of this case in that\nregard is the question of whether or not a class may be\ncertified under West Virginia Rules of Civil Procedure\nhas never been litigated, has never been decided by any\ncourt.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Monahan, do you\nmean by that that you would have a blanket rule that a\ndecision on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 can never\nbe preclusive as to a State Rule of Civil Procedure 23?\nMR. MONAHAN: Your Honor, I believe it would\ndepend upon whether or not that State has said that not\nonly are we going to look at these Federal decisions as\nbeing persuasive, but we're going to consider ourself\nbound by the decisions of the Fourth District or the\nUnited States District Court for the Southern District\nof West Virginia.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, suppose the State\nsays: We will not consider ourselves bound; we do have\nour own law with respect to Rule 23, but sometimes we'll\ngo along with the Federal rule and sometimes we won't.\nIs it then up to the courts to actually try to determine\nwhether the -- the West Virginia court in this case\nwould have gone along, would have interpreted its own\nrule of civil procedure the same way that the Federal\ncourt interpreted the Federal rule?\nMR. MONAHAN: Well, for instance, what Your\nHonor suggested is essentially what the West Virginia\nSupreme Court of Appeals does. I mean, they will -\nthey will consider them to be persuasive. They will\nconsider them -- but in their In re Rezulin case, the\ncourt noted -- the court actually criticized the circuit\njudge for relying exclusively on Federal decisions\ndenying class certification in medical device or\nprescription drug cases. And the court noted that, you\nknow, although we will look at those rules and they may\nbe persuasive, they are not binding or controlling on\nus, and that's because we do not want our legal analysis\nto be nothing more than a mere Pavlovian response to\nFederal decisional rules.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What is -- what is the\ndifference between the Federal law and the West Virginia\nlaw on the class certification issue? Not the\napplication to this particular complaint, but as to the\n-- the standard. What do you see as the difference\nbetween the Federal standard and the West Virginia\nstandard?\nMR. MONAHAN: The main difference, Justice\nAlito, is that our court has -- and they cite this in\nIn re Rezulin, for instance. They cite Newberg on Class\nActions as one of the authorities to support this\nprinciple, but they note that in -- in our court that\nnormally challenges based upon reliance, causation, and\ndamages will not bar certification on a predominance\nbasis, because those go to the right of the individual\nto recover, but not to the overall liability issues of\nthe defendant, which it believes can be addressed as\ncommon issues in many cases and save the court an\nextreme amount of time addressing those common issues.\nNow, the court indicates that if individual\ntrials need to be conducted later on, on any of those\nissues, if there are truly individual issues that need\nto be resolved concerning those claims, individual\ntrials can be accomplished.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: On the ground that the\ncourt here, the Federal court, decided that there\nweren't predominant issues based mostly on the fact\nthat, like the Virginia court has now, it's decided that\nthere is no economic loss, what were the differences?\nWhat were the differences here? How would\nthe difference in standard play out here?\nMR. MONAHAN: Well, for instance -- and this\nis an interesting aspect of this case -- that the\ncourt's not only trying to bind us on the procedural\nruling but is also trying to bind us in a substantive\nruling as to what the elements of the claims in West\nVirginia are and as to what's needed to prove those\nclaims.\nFor instance, the Eighth Circuit has -- has\nheld that, in looking at the district court's opinion,\nthat it has held that an actual physical injury is\nrequired, that economic loss alone is not enough.\nClearly, that's not consistent with West Virginia law.\nAn economic loss alone can be sufficient. In West -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The -- I'm sorry. I\ndon't mean to cut you off. But you're really arguing\nthat due process requires the same treatment,\nessentially, of notice and an opportunity to be heard\nthat we are giving to a substantive decision that blocks\na future member from pursuing his or her claim, correct?\nMR. MONAHAN: Yes, very similar, Your Honor.\nI mean, in this circumstance -- I mean, these rights are\nprovided. These procedural rights, once they are\ncreated, are being provided, and they can't be taken\naway without due process. West Virginia has recognized\nthe right to -- to proceed in our court under our rule,\nand not -- you don't have a guarantee --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're almost treating\nit as a property right, and -- and you're basically\nsaying we're equating it with, essentially, a property\nright.\nMR. MONAHAN: Well, I think -- I think what\nI'm trying to say, Your Honor, is that these type of\nprocedural rights -- whenever you have a substantive\nclaim which is a property right, and you seek to\nlitigate them, you shall have available to you all the\nRules of Civil Procedure which have been adopted and\nrecognized, and those procedural elements of the claim\nshould be treated or adjudicated just the same as a\nsubstantive claim, consistent with due process.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If we disagree with you,\nbecause there is a difference of some sort between\nprocedure and substantive rights, then what would\ncommand the due process violation in a situation in\nwhich the Federal litigation has applied essentially the\nsame standard that the State has and there has been\nadequate representation on the procedural question,\nwhere no substantive right of a plaintiff has been\nextinguished?\nThat's a lot of conditions, but those are\nthe three conditions of this case. So, what in due\nprocess requires that outcome, your outcome?\nMR. MONAHAN: Well, I believe that the\nbasic -- because we are not the same party, we believe\nthe basic elements of just the notice and the right to\nbe heard, which our party has never had. May I -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're extinguishing a\nsubstantive right. If I return to my question of what\nmakes a procedural right substantive -\nMR. MONAHAN: Well, this particular\nprocedural right is very closely connected -- I mean,\none of the main purposes of a class action is to level\nthe economic playing field and to enable people with\nsmall individual claims to aggregate them in order to\nseek justice. Without those -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Actually not true. The\nplaintiff here received the same thing. The issue is\nhow much money the lawyers are going to receive,\nreally -\nMR. MONAHAN: Well -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- because plaintiff\ngets their attorney's fees, gets a statutory violation\namount, which is going to be the same whether it's in a\nclass action or an individual action, so it's really not\nthe plaintiff who stands to win.\nMR. MONAHAN: No, Your Honor, what -\nwhat -- the assumptions you just made I don't believe\nare correct in this -- in this particular case, because,\none, obviously if we lose the CCPA claim in light of the\nWhite case, there would be no statutory attorney fees.\nAnd even if we had the CCPA claim, it's -- the court has\ndiscretion. It may award them. There's no requirement\nthat it do so, no requirement whatsoever.\nAnd how can anybody bring -- any lawyer\ntrying to bring one of these small damage claims -- if\nthe damages are only $100, $200 per plaintiff, for\ninstance, how could any lawyer justify facing a\ndefendant such as Bayer in a complex product liability\naction? Just the cost alone of having experts, of doing\ndiscovery -- all those matters would greatly exceed the\nvalue of the claim itself. So the class action is the\nonly way in which to aggregate the claims and level the\neconomic playing field for everybody.\nThe other thing, I would note for the common\nlaw fraud claim, West Virginia does have a bad-faith\nexception for attorney fees, but that depends on the\ndegree of fraud that the court finds, and that -- that,\nin and of itself, is discretionary.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if -- how far\ndoes your procedural right extend? Let's say in the\nsecond action, the court says, look, we've been through\nall this before; we have had a million pages of\ndiscovery from the prior action, no protective order at\nall. So while, if you were the first person here,\nyou're entitled to, you know, 10 interrogatories,\nbecause we've been through this before, I'm going to say\nyou can look at all the discovery that's there, but you\nonly get 5 interrogatories.\nNow, do you say no, no, no, I'm entitled to\nthe same procedural rights I'd have if I were here\nfirst? Is that right?\nMR. MONAHAN: Your Honor, I think the court\ndoes have some flexibility, depending upon the\nprocedural rule at issue. And -- and, in essence, the\ncourt is applying almost essentially the stare decisis\ntype of principles there. We have resolved this exact\ndiscovery issue before, the exact arguments -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So now it's not only\nthat you're entitled to your day in court substantively;\nyou're -- you're entitled to your day in court\nprocedurally as to some procedural aspects but not\nothers?\nMR. MONAHAN: Well, I certainly think the\nCourt needs to examine the procedural aspect and its\nimportance, and the part that it plays. I mean, for\ninstance, one of the problems we have in this situation\nis that normally res judicata and collateral estoppel do\nnot normally apply to mere procedural rulings. They're\nnot normally used for that purpose.\nMost cases where they are used for that\npurpose are cases where a dismissal has occurred based\nupon a procedural ruling or a procedural failing. And\nwhenever they apply collateral estoppel and res\njudicata, it's almost -- every case I've seen deals with\nthe exact same party in another proceeding. And there\nthey preclude them. But here is a totally different\nparty. And the issue under West Virginia law has never\nbeen litigated by any court.\nJUSTICE BREYER: A totally different\nparty -- if a person, say an intervenor, joins a\nlitigation late, and there have been a lot of procedural\nrulings, I guess that that intervenor takes the case as\nhe finds it. Now, he could go to the judge and say:\nJudge, I want you to reconsider your procedural ruling\nin light of the fact I'm here.\nHow does the situation I've just sketched\ndiffer from this one? I mean, you have a client who's\ncoming to the litigation late. He's separate from the\nlitigation, I know, but he could send a representative\nto the judge and say: Judge, I want you to reconsider\nin light of the fact I'm joining. Now, I know I'm not\njoining; in fact, I'm bringing a different case.\nBut I'm thinking of the -- of the Chief\nJustice's hypo, here and I'm -- and I'm trying to apply\nit. And is your client analogous to that person who\njoins litigation late?\nMR. MONAHAN: No, Your Honor, because -- I\nmean, for instance, this Court has noted -- and they\nnoted it, I believe in the -- you noted it in the\nRichards case. The Chase National Bank v. Norwalk and\nMartin v. Wilks has noted that a stranger to litigation\nhas no duty to seek to intervene in the case; however,\nthey can; they can seek to intervene if they have\nnotice, if they so choose.\nIf you take that affirmative step to\nintervene, knowing what has happened in that case, you\nobviously have notice of the case because you're\nchoosing to intervene. And if you seek to intervene\nhaving that notice, then you take it as you find it.\nNow, you can certainly ask the court to\nreconsider because you want to raise new arguments, but\nthere would be no obligation to do so.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Here you have a different\nforum. You pick up a different plaintiff, and you go to\na different forum. How -- and I guess your answer is\nthat you could go on and on and on until -- until maybe\nyou find a judge who will certify this class.\nMR. MONAHAN: Your Honor, I don't -- I don't\nbelieve so. I don't believe that's the case because\nthere are limitations to that. One would be, I think,\nif you filed at another Federal court, for instance,\nRule 23 would be the same legal standard. Federal Rule\n23 is the same legal standard in all Federal courts.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But we have a new\nplaintiff, so that plaintiff wouldn't have had notice\nand an opportunity to be -- to be heard.\nMR. MONAHAN: For preclusion purposes,\nthat's correct. But I think the Federal court certainly\nwould look at those cases for stare decisis purposes in\nlooking as to whether or not the class should be\ncertified under the same legal standard.\nNow, here we do have a different forum. We\nhave the State of West Virginia, as a separate\nsovereign, has its own rights to do this. But, once -\nonce -- if a class would be denied in West Virginia at\none time, I believe that the chances of having another\none succeed are very low, because courts will look to\nthose stare decisis principles.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but there are 50\nStates.\nMR. MONAHAN: I'm sorry, Your Honor?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There are 50 States. And\nif -- and if the plaintiff was asking for a nationwide\nclass action.\nMR. MONAHAN: Yes, Your Honor, and the issue\nwith that, though, is this Court has -- in Taylor v.\nSturgell, for instance, which Your Honor authored, the\nGovernment argued in that case that, you know, we should\nadopt this virtual representation theory because of\nrepetitive litigation. We had this FOIA request. Any\nperson out there can file asking the government for\nthese documents, and the government may have to go on\nthousands of times, millions of times, conceivably, to\ndo this.\nAnd this Court note -- noted that the threat\nof repetitive litigation is not sufficient to justify\nadopting a new exception to the rule against nonparty\npreclusion.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What kind of notice do you\nthink due process would require? If the court in which\nthe case was first filed thought, I'm not going waste --\nI don't want to waste my time on this class\ncertification issue if it's just going to be re\nlitigated over and over and over again, so I want to\nprovide sufficient notice so that the members of a class\nwill be bound by my -- by my class certification issue,\nwhat -- what would have to be done? Would they all have\nto be given individual notice and asked to opt out?\nMR. MONAHAN: Your Honor, I -- I believe so.\nI believe -- I mean, consistent with Shutts, this\nCourt's ruling in Shutts and Eisen, I think they would,\nbecause once they had the notice and that they would\ndecide not to opt out, then they would be bound by any\nruling that the -- that the court issues there. But\nif -- if they don't have that opportunity, especially\nwhenever -- and this case also involves the\nAnti-Injunction Act, of course, the principles of\nfederalism and comity, and any question under the\nAnti-Injunction Act, any doubt, should go against\nissuing injunctions.\nAnd the -- the exceptions to that Act are\nnarrowly construed in light of principles of federalism,\nand because we do have a separate State here and we're\ntrying to apply or seek State relief and seek the State\nrules and follow the State rules, I do believe you would\nneed the same notice that we have in Shutts, the notice,\nthe opportunity to appear, and the opportunity to opt\nout.\nNow, certainly, other issues -- if we're\ntalking about policy concerns, another thing that I\nwould note is that in CAFA recently -- whenever Congress\nadopted CAFA, certainly if they believe that basing\none -- using one class denial in Federal court as a\nbasis to preclude all other similar classes seeking -\nseeking certification, if they thought that was\nconsistent with due process, certainly they could have\nconsidered adopting that as part of CAFA. But they\nchose to deal with it in a very different way, a very\ndifferent manner, and that was to go ahead and change\nthe jurisdictional status in diversity cases, make\nminimal diversity and allow removal with certain -- you\nknow, certain exceptions for certain discretionary ones,\nstay at home and local controversy exceptions, but they\ndidn't -- I mean, that's how they chose to deal with it.\nNow, certainly, we would admit that since\nCAFA has been enacted, the chance -- certainly, there's\nnot nearly as many of these cases which will occur where\nthis would -- where this will be an issue, because many\nlarge classes now will get removed. And -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: When -- when Congress\nenacted CAFA, did Congress think about this precise\nissue, the issue that Justice Ginsburg is raising about\na lawyer going from State to State with a different\nnamed plaintiff? Was that -- was that part of what\nCongress was reacting to?\nMR. MONAHAN: Yes, Justice Kagan, it's my\nunderstanding that that was something they were\nconcerned about. And they were concerned about, again,\nsome States being too permissive in granting class\ncertifications, and they were worried about some of\nthose same factors.\nBut, you know, one of the primary concerns\non all -- in CAFA itself, though, was protecting the\nabsent class members' rights, and this Court's noted\nthose same rights in Amchem and Ortiz. In many of its\ncases, your cases, you've noted that that's a principal\nconcern. And this Court has heightened the standard in\nthose class -- class settlement certifications for the\ncourt to make sure that each and every element and\nrequirement is met, to ensure that -- that the\nsettlement itself is fair to all class members,\nincluding the absent class members, and that, you\nknow -- and that the attorney fees are fair.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Wouldn't it be a violation\n-- wouldn't it be a violation of due process if Congress\nenacted a statute or if there were a rule adopted that\nsaid that the first ruling on class certification by a\nFederal court binds all members of the class in any\nother Federal litigation? Would that be a -- then they\nwould retain their individual claims, but there could\nnot be another -- another class action -- another class\naction filed. Would that be a due process violation?\nMR. MONAHAN: In all other Federal cases, I\nbelieve that that might survive a due process challenge,\nbecause you're limiting it to the same legal standard in\nthose cases. Certainly, I think you could -- because -\nbecause it would be applying, though, to absent class\nmembers who were not truly parties, I believe some of\nthose due process concerns could be raised.\nBut you certainly would not have the\nelements of the federalism; you would not have the\ndifferent legal standard that we have with State courts\napplying their own rules.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, is there a due process\nright to have class action?\nMR. MONAHAN: Your Honor, this Court has\nnoted a procedural right to seek class certification.\nThere is no right to have one. We have to meet the\nrequirements in order to -\nJUSTICE ALITO: But what if Congress just\ndecided to get rid of class actions altogether? Would\nthat be unconstitutional?\nMR. MONAHAN: Your Honor, I -- I certainly\nwould hope that they would provide notice and an\nopportunity for people to come and make their arguments\nand to argue both sides of the question. But, no, I\ndon't believe so.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Did it ever happen -- did\nyou ever come across an instance before where in a\nFederal court a judge in the district court says, no,\nyou can't have a certification, no; and then a different\nplaintiff went to a different Federal court in a\ndifferent part of the country and asked for a similar\ncertification? Have you ever found anything like that\nin precedent, that it's in two Federal courts rather\nthan the State/Federal?\nMR. MONAHAN: Yes, Your Honor. I believe\nthat maybe Thorogood, the recent Thorogood case out of\nthe Seventh Circuit, might involve something similar to\nthat.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And did they say -- did\nthey say in -- in that case that the second judge is\nbound as a matter of stare decisis, or is he bound as a\nmatter of collateral estoppel?\nMR. MONAHAN: Based on a collateral estoppel\npreclusion principles, Your Honor, which -\nJUSTICE BREYER: So it's the same issue as\nhere?\nMR. MONAHAN: Well, it's even somewhat\nworse, in my opinion, because not only did they have a\ndifferent party, but they went from a nationwide class\nto a statewide class, and that itself is -- you know,\nthat's -- even Bridgestone that would be all right\nunder.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, you -- you would\nsay that the subsequent plaintiff is not bound if he was\nnot given notice and an opportunity to opt out, even if\nhe came back to the same court, right?\nIt would be a stupid thing to do.\nMR. MONAHAN: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And he's probably going to\nlose, but you'd say he's not bound, right?\nMR. MONAHAN: Yes. Yes, that's because he's\nnot the same party, but the legal standard would be the\nsame, and it would not be a wise move.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Beck.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILIP S. BECK\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. BECK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe core issue here is whether absent class\nmembers can be bound by a denial of class certification\nwhere there was adequate representation on that issue\nbut not notice and opportunity to be heard.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: When you say \"on that\nissue,\" Mr. Beck, on what issue? Because I think that\nthere is an argument in this case that the West Virginia\napproach to class certification is different from the\nEighth Circuit's approach, that Rezulin would not have\nbeen the way that the Eighth Circuit would have\napproached the class certification question.\nMR. BECK: The issue that was decided and\npreclusive was the issue of predominance, Your Honor,\nand what happened there is that Judge Davis, the judge\nwho was supervising the multidistrict litigation, he\nmade a determination under West Virginia law as to\nwhat's required to make out an economic loss claim, and\nhe concluded that what is required is individual proof\nof injury as well as individual proof of causation. And\nthen he went on to describe what kind of evidence would\nbe necessary to do that.\nSo he made a legal determination, and then\nhe went -- and then after looking at what kind of\nevidence would be required -- excuse me -- made a -- I\nthink a mixed law and fact determination that, given\nthat, individual issues would predominate over common\nissues. His -- his interpretation of West Virginia law\nwas later vindicated by the West Virginia Supreme Court\nin White, where they held that -- that there is a\nrequirement of individual proof of injury, which had\nbeen contested by Petitioners, and it's clear that it's\ngoing to require the same exact kind of inquiry.\nSo what we have is that there's no\nsuggestion in Rezulin or anywhere else that the\npredominance requirement under the West Virginia version\nof Rule 23, which is essentially identical to the\nFederal version, has any other content that's different\nfrom the Federal version.\nIn Rezulin, there's a suggestion that when\n-- that the West Virginia courts would treat differences\nin -- in damages or reliance as less significant than\nsome Federal courts, but nothing at all that suggests in\nany way that if the underlying cause of action requires\nindividual proof of injury and causation, that somehow\nthat common questions are going to predominate over\nindividual questions. There's no suggestion of that.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: We couldn't know. We\ncouldn't -- when they went to the West Virginia Supreme\nCourt, that was before this White v. Wyeth. They were\narguing a question of substantive law: What do we have\nto show in order to get damages, when we say we weren't\nhurt by the drug? We're saying -- we're not saying we\ndidn't get any benefit from it; we're just saying we\npaid more money for it than we should because it wasn't\nof the quality that it was represented to be.\nWhen the Federal judge said, having to make\na determination of West Virginia law, no, it's not the\nlaw; you have to show causation, some harm to you. But\nthen when they -- when these plaintiffs went to the West\nVirginia court, that was still an open question of West\nVirginia law, and the West Virginia courts might have\ndecided it differently than the Federal court, right?\nMR. BECK: Yes. Well, yes -- when the\nFederal district judge made the determination, it was in\nMr. McCollins's case, and he's called upon to resolve\nquestions of State law just like courts are every day in\ndiversity actions. And he resolved the question of\nState law, what's required by the West Virginia Consumer\nCredit and Protection Act.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But sometimes Federal\njudges -- they try their best, but they're not the last\nword on what the State law is.\nMR. BECK: And some -- and, Your Honor, if\n-- if for example, Judge Davis had found as he did in\nMcCollins, and then he had issued the same injunction,\nand then the White case had come down the other way,\nthat -- that says that there is no requirement of\ninjury, then conceivably the Petitioners could have gone\nback to Judge Davis and asked for relief from his\ninjunction. And then we'd have an interesting\nquestion --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Not these Petitioners.\nThey weren't parties to the case before -\nMR. BECK: No, but they were -- they were\nparties to the injunction proceeding. They were the\ndefendants in the injunction proceeding. So they're\nsubject to an injunction, and then -- then the law\nchanges, or the law is declared differently by the West\nVirginia Supreme Court.\nNothing would have precluded them from\ncoming back in front of Judge Davis and said:\nRespectfully, sir, you -- you were wrong in your\nprediction, and we'd like to be relieved from the\ninjunction.\nAnd then we'd have a very interesting\nquestion about whether being correct or incorrect is -\nis something that can eliminate the law of preclusion,\nbecause normally if -- if a party is precluded, they're\nnot allowed to say I shouldn't be precluded because I\nthink the judge made a mistake on the law. But we don't\nhave that here because, in fact, Judge Davis was\nvindicated on the content of West Virginia law.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Beck, I'm -- I'm not\nsure that White answers the question that I asked,\nbecause White decided a matter of substantive liability,\nand the question I asked was whether the approach to\nclass certification was different in the Eighth Circuit\nand in West Virginia.\nMR. BECK: Yes.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: If you look at Rezulin, if\nyou compare to it some Eighth Circuit cases, there seems\nto be a difference in at least tone, shall we say, about\nthe extent to which a finding is required that common\nissues predominate.\nMR. BECK: I think that, actually, Judge\nDavis took into account the difference in tone, and he\nlooked very carefully at Rezulin, and he said that what\nRezulin was focusing on was individual questions of\ndamages, which defendants often argue is enough so that\nindividual questions predominate, individual questions\nof reliance, which we also often argue mean that\nindividual questions predominate.\nBut he said this is different, because this\nis -- in order to prove liability, they've got to\nestablish individual injury, which means, on a\nperson-by-person basis, either that they were harmed by\nthe drug or that the drug didn't work to lower their\ncholesterol as -- as it was supposed to, and they have\nto show that whatever the violation of the Consumer\nFraud Act was is causally linked there.\nAnd he said that's a different animal from\nquestions of reliance and damages. And -- and I've\nheard or read no conceivable explanation about how,\nunder any standard of predominance, you could have\ncommon questions predominating when every single member\nof the class is going to have to examine the medical\nrecords to see whether their cholesterol came down,\nwhether they suffered any side effects, and -- and if\ntheir cholesterol didn't come down and they did suffer\nside effects, how that could be linked to a violation of\nthe Consumer Fraud Act.\nSo what Judge -- Judge Davis didn't depart\nfrom Rezulin at all. Judge Davis said: This goes to\ncore questions of liability, and as I interpret the West\nVirginia statute, in order to establish liability,\nthey're going to have to show that on an\nindividual-by-individual basis.\nAnd the relevance of White is that he's\ncorrect. Of course, White even goes further and says,\nbecause of that, there's no cause of action under the\nWest Virginia Consumer Credit and Protection Act.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How do you answer that\nthey have claims that do not involve the consumer,\nwhatever it is; that they have fraud claims and some\nother kind of claims?\nMR. BECK: A warranty claim, Your Honor.\nThere was also a warranty claim in the McCollins case,\nthe original Federal case. Their warranty claim is no\ndifferent, and the requirements of a warranty claim are\nno different.\nFraud, obviously, requires individual proof\nof injury and causation. The fraud is -- I mean, the\nConsumer Fraud Act is -- is an effort to make it easier\nfor plaintiffs to make out a cause of action. If you\ncan't make out a cause of action under the Consumer\nFraud Act, it certainly can't be made out under fraud.\nAnd in terms of preclusion law, what the\nEighth Circuit observed was that when there's the -- the\nsame core set of facts that make out a cause of action,\nadding another label to it doesn't change the preclusion\nanalysis.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Beck, if you're right\nabout issue preclusion, then if Bayer had gone into the\nWest Virginia court and said, West Virginia court, Judge\nDavis has decided this case in Minnesota Federal\nDistrict Court -- issue preclusion -- that's one thing,\nbut what was used here was quite a heavy gun, and that\nis the -- an empty suit injunction, which seems to say:\nWe're not going to trust the West Virginia court to\napply issue preclusion. We're going to stop that court\nfrom proceeding altogether.\nAnd the anti-suit injunction is -- it's a\nvery strong weapon, and even though it's the -- the\nclients who are being precluded, it's really saying to\nanother court: We're not even going to let you get to\nthis question; we're going to stop you.\nSo maybe you could be right about preclusion\nbut wrong about use of the anti-suit injunction.\nMR. BECK: Well, Your Honor, the -- any time\nthat someone invokes the re-litigation exception to the\nAnti-Injunction Act, by definition, an alternative would\nbe to go into the second court and -- and just simply\nplead preclusion. That would always be available. And\nif that were sufficient, then there would be no\nre-litigation exception to the Anti-Injunction Act.\nHere's a reason why it's very important in a\ncase like this: Under their theory, they -- they could\nnot only file a class action in one county in West\nVirginia, and then if we couldn't get an injunction but\nwe pled preclusion, and if -- and if we prevailed, they\ncould file one in another county. And in West Virginia,\ncounty judges don't look to judges from other counties\nas stare decisis.\nAnd so they could go, under their approach,\nto another county, and that judge might agree with us.\nAnd then they go to another county, and eventually\nthey're pretty confident that they'd find one judge in\none county in West Virginia who would reject our\npreclusion analysis and allow the case to go forward.\nAnd in West Virginia, we have no right to have an appeal\nheard. There is no intermediate appellate court, and\nthere's no appeal of right to the West Virginia Supreme\nCourt.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, of course, you're\narguing the principle. What would have happened if the\nclass had gone -- those who wanted to be in the class\nhad gone first to the West Virginia court, and the West\nVirginia court had denied class certification? Would\nthat preclude a later Federal court from granting class\ncertification?\nMR. BECK: If the -- if the West Virginia\ncourt had denied class certification on an issue that is\npresent in Rule 23, then it would be preclusive under\nRule 23. It would be under the full faith and credit\nstatute, where Federal courts have to give full faith\nand credit to State judgments to the same extent that -\nthat a State would.\nIf, however, Your Honor, the court said in\nWest Virginia, well, they meet all of the requirements\nof our Rule 23, but under West Virginia law, we have\ndiscretion to deny a class even if they meet all the\nrequirements of Rule 23, then that would be an\ninteresting question, because under Federal procedure,\nunder this Court's opinions, if someone meets all the\nrequirements of Rule 23, then class certification is\nappropriate.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Beck, the re-litigation\nexception of the Anti-Injunction Act speaks in terms of\njudgments. Why is the denial of class certification a\njudgment?\nMR. BECK: I'm not sure that it would be\nin -- in the mine-run case, but we don't have it. We -\none of the reasons that this case is unusual is that we\nactually have a real-life final judgment that\nincorporates the denial of class certification.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But the judgment, if I\nunderstood it correctly -- there was just a\ncontemporaneous summary judgment motion, and the court\ngranted summary judgment as well. But the denial of\nclass certification isn't responsible for the judge's\ndismissal of the suit.\nMR. BECK: Well, but it is -- it is merged\ninto the judgment. It's explicitly a part of the\njudgment. It's in the judgment itself. I think it's\nour Joint Appendix 83, is it?\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So that sounds like a very\ncontingent answer to my question. If that were not the\ncase, if it -- if it was the denial of a class\ncertification, but then the action proceeds as a\nnon-class litigation, you think that there would be no\njudgment, and so the Anti-Injunction Act would not\napply?\nMR. BECK: No, Your Honor. I think that\nwould be a tougher question. It's posed in some of the\nother cases percolating up, the Thorogood case, for\nexample, or some of them out of the Seventh Circuit.\nI think that, under normal preclusion\nanalysis, decisions that have not reached the point\nwhere there's a formal final judgment can still be given\npreclusive effect if they're sufficiently final, that a\ncourt says it's exceedingly unlikely that we could\nreconsider. There's another -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's true about -\nthat's true about preclusion, but -- and so that you\nmight go into the West Virginia court and say this\nsecond plaintiff should be precluded, but as Justice\nKagan pointed out, you're dealing with the\nanti-injunction statute -\nMR. BECK: And I -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that talks about\njudgment.\nMR. BECK: And I was about to say, Your\nHonor, that -- that under the Anti-Injunction Act, it\nmight actually be a different analysis, and because the\nissue isn't present here, we haven't briefed it, but I\ncould see under the -- looking at the statutory language\nof the re-litigation exception that talks about\njudgments and also looking to the federalism concerns\nthat -- that inform the -- the Anti-Injunction Act, one\ncould argue, in an appropriate case, that whatever the\nlaw is as to preclusion generally, when it comes to the\nAnti-Injunction Act, we're going to require more in the\nform of a -- of a formal judgment that -- that\nincorporates the particular ruling. As I said, that's\nnot our case, but I could -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Oh, but why isn't it really,\nbecause here what happened was that there was a denial\nof class certification and there was a granting of a\nsummary judgment motion at one and the same time? But\nthe thing that was responsible for getting the case out\nof court was the granting of the summary judgment\nmotion, not the denial of class certification. That was\nextraneous to the judgment that the case was dismissed.\nMR. BECK: Well, I think it's actually -\nwhile -- while it was collateral to the summary judgment\nmotion on Mr. McCollins's individual claim, it's\nactually essential to the judgment in -- in terms of\nincluding it, in terms of who's bound by -- by -- by the\njudgment. If class certification had been -- we -- we\nneed to know once the judge has ruled on class\ncertification, whether he's granted it or denied it, in\norder to know who's affected by the judgment on the\nmerits and otherwise.\nAnd if he had granted the motion to certify\nthe class, then there would be one set of effects coming\nout of a final judgment. If he denies the motion to\ncertify the class, there's a different set of effects\nthat come out of that judgment.\nSo, it is essential to the judgment, in our\nmind, and, incidentally, the essential-to-the-judgment\npoint under preclusion law is not one that -- that the\nPetitioners have ever raised below. It's not one that\nis in their questions presented or their cert petition\nor their brief. So this isn't an issue that -- that\nthey've preserved or argued, but we do believe, quite\nclearly, that the class certification denial was an\nintegral part of the final judgment, and -- and,\nobviously, it's in there on its terms.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, under the\nAnti-Injunction Act, would it permit a blanket\ninjunction that says, against all future State court\nclass proceedings across the United States? Could a\ncourt just order a re-litigation bar?\nMR. BECK: I don't believe so, Your Honor.\nI think that -- I think that in this Court's Chick Kam\nChoo decision, there was an emphasis that under the\nAnti-Injunction Act you have to have, you know, the same\nissue litigated, and there was a concern about whether\nthere was a significant difference in standards.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's my question to\nyou.\nMR. BECK: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So articulate what we're\ncomparing when we're saying that the re-litigation bar\ncan apply to a procedural ruling.\nMR. BECK: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We started a little bit\non the question. Is there any requirement that that\nissue have been fully and fairly adjudicated in the\nprior proceedings?\nMR. BECK: Oh, I think -- I think that for\nthe -- for -- for preclusion to apply, even before one\ngets to the Anti-Injunction Act, there's a requirement\nthat the issue be fully and fairly litigated. I think\nthat -- I think the focus would be, as Judge Davis's\nwas, is there a difference in -- in the class\ncertification procedures that would -- that would result\nin a -- in a different outcome, given the particular\nissue that's been decided. So that -- so that there -\nyou know, I could conceive of issues that would be\ndispositive in a Federal court on class certification\nthat would have nothing to do with -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. Let's\ntake -\nMR. BECK: -- with certification in State\ncourt.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You talked about\ndifferent standards. Your adversary said that, in this\nState, reliance doesn't need to be proven. Let's assume\nthat fact. And the district court's ruling here was\nbased on a reliance requirement and said no predominance\nbecause each individual plaintiff will have to prove\nreliance. Does that become the same -- a different\nstandard or not?\nMR. BECK: Judge Davis's opinion was not\nbased in any way on reliance.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- I -- I'm posing it\nas a hypothetical.\nMR. BECK: Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: As a hypothetical.\nMR. BECK: If -- if a State court had said\nthat this thing, that -- that reliance, or whatever,\nthat is talked about so much in Federal courts, we don't\ncare about that, that's not part of our standard,\nthen -- then that would be -- and that was the basis of\nthe Federal court's decision, then I think you would be\napplying different standards, and under Chick Kam Choo,\nthere wouldn't be preclusion.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You see, the problem is\nthat I don't know how you get and when you get to the\nquestion of whether reliance needs to be proven or not,\nif you're going to bar the State court from reaching\nthat -- that substantive question, not that substantive\nissue, but that substantive question -\nMR. BECK: The -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- which is not very\ndifferent from here, which is, what does economic loss\nrequire in terms of proof?\nMR. BECK: Well, we're -- we're moving now\nfrom what is in Rule 23 in Federal and State\njurisprudence to what is the underlying cause of action\nwhen we -- when -- you know, whether reliance is a part\nof the claim. We keep saying \"reliance\" and -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, I'm shifting them\nonly to try to get -\nMR. BECK: Okay.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- a sense of what\ndifferent standards mean -\nMR. BECK: Okay. And -- and -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- to you, and how we\narticulate that rule in a way that doesn't preclude -\ndoesn't permit the barring -\nMR. BECK: I think -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- of claims when\nthere's a different standard.\nMR. BECK: I think -- I think, Justice\nSotomayor, that you have to distinguish between Rule 23\nand the underlying State law that's the subject of the\nlawsuit. And any time a -- a Federal court is looking\nat whether a class action can be certified for a\nviolation of State law, it has to make a determination\nof whether -- of what State law is in terms of how you\nprove a violation, what the elements are. And that's\nwhat -- that's just -- you have to do that every single\nday.\nAnd you make that kind of determination, and\nthen you move to the next step of whether that should be\npreclusive, which is when Rule 23 comes into play. And\nI think that's the point where you say, are the State\nstandards under Rule 23 different from the Federal\nstandards?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm -- I'm the -- I'm the\nparty trying to bring the later class action, and you\ntell me I can't do it because somebody else sought a\nclass action, and -- and it -- and it was denied. And I\nsay: Well, I don't care. I -- you know, that's\nsomebody else. That was not me. I was not -- and not\nonly was I not a party to that case, I think that person\nhad a lousy lawyer, and had I chosen the lawyer, we\nwouldn't have lost that point.\nWhat's your response to that? You cannot\neven say, as you can where the class has been certified,\nwell, at least there was a determination by some judge\nthat the absent parties were adequately represented.\nThere hasn't been even that determination.\nMR. BECK: Well, Your Honor, there was that\ndetermination in this case at the injunction stage.\nThey did claim -- they -- they said, well, was this -\nwas this lawyer from West Virginia who made exactly the\nsame arguments that they made, was he -- did he\nadequately represent our interests?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you do that ex post.\nMR. BECK: Well, I think, under the -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You want to litigate this\nlater, and -\nMR. BECK: Well, adequacy, of course, is\npart of Rule 23 analysis, but it's also independently a\npart of preclusion law analysis, where in order to be\nprecluded -- for a nonparty to be precluded, then you\nhave to do the analysis that's called for in Taylor v.\nSturgell, where you have to say in order to preclude a\nnonparty, does it meet the two-part test of Taylor v.\nSturgell?\nThe first part: Were their interests\naligned? Here their interests were perfectly aligned.\nAnd then the second part is an either/or: Did the party\nin the first action understand herself -- in this case\nhimself -- to be acting in a representative capacity, or\ndid the court take care to protect the interests of the\nnonparties?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's a very\nsubjective decision whether the lawyer is -- right here.\nMR. BECK: I'm sorry.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- whether the -\nthe lawyer is adequate or not. People have different\nviews about what kind of lawyer they want, and I can see\nsomebody who doesn't even know that this action is going\non saying: Well, I don't care if you think the lawyer\nis adequate. I don't think he is. Besides I wanted my,\nyou know, brother-in-law to be the lawyer.\nMR. BECK: Well -- and in every preclusion\ncase there's a -- there's a question about adequacy, and\nit focuses not on whether someone likes the lawyer or\nthey've got a brother-in-law who is a lawyer. It\nfocuses on whether the parties' interests are aligned,\nand McCollins's interests were identical to Mr. Smith's\nand Ms. Sperlazza's. And it -- and it points to whether\nMr. McCollins understood that he was acting in a\nrepresentative capacity and to whether Judge Davis took\ncare to protect the interests of nonparties.\nSo it doesn't say that everybody gets to\npick their own lawyer. If that were the rule, there\nwould be no law of preclusion because nobody would ever\npick the same lawyers.\nMy -- one other point I want to make -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But it -- I'm sorry.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I was just going to\nsay -- it's odd to say you're precluded. The whole\npoint is the basic principle that you're entitled to\nyour day in court. And you're saying, well, you're not\nentitled to your day in court if somebody else had a day\nin court and they had a good lawyer.\nMR. BECK: And -- and that is exactly the\nquestion that's posed by the law of nonparty preclusion,\nand -- and as this Court's opinion in Taylor v. Sturgell\nsaid, there are circumstances where a nonparty can be\nprecluded based on litigation from someone else, and\nI -- I referenced the test, and the first point I wanted\nto make -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How can you -- how can you\npossibly find that in the first action the lawyer\nunderstood that he was acting in a representative\ncapacity?\nMR. BECK: Well, it's the -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He tried to act in a -- but\n-- but his representation was denied.\nMR. BECK: It's the party rather than the\nlawyer, and -- and it's when -- when he commenced that\nlitigation and when he litigated the issue that we're\ntalking about, of class certification, there's no doubt\nin the world that he is -- that he understood himself to\nbe acting on behalf of a class. That -- that's why he\nwas litigating class certification.\nAnd -- and, Your Honor, what we -- we have\nhere also, because we're -- we're kind of verging into\nthe due process analysis, you have to start with the\nquestion of what is the interest that's at stake here.\nThe injunction doesn't forbid any -- any plaintiff from\npursuing their individual claim or arguing anything they\nwant about underlying West Virginia law. It only\nprecludes them from going forward in a class action, and\nthat is -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's -- that's\noften theoretical because on these small claims, it's\nclass action or nothing. Nobody's going to pay a lawyer\nto go to court with a $100 case.\nMR. BECK: These I don't think fall in that\ncategory, Your Honor. There's -- it's $200 statutory\npenalty per violation, which means per prescription\nrefill. There's -- there's attorney's fees on top of\nthat; there's punitive damages on top of that. The\nMcCollins case in Federal court was that kind of case,\nand he pled that he satisfied the jurisdictional amount\nof $75,000. But even if it's a small claim, the -- that\ndoesn't mean that the opportunity to litigate it in a\nclass action and join other parties is a property\ninterest that implicates due process protections. That\nis -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nThank you.\nMr. Monahan, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD A. MONAHAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. MONAHAN: In this case, the MDL court\ndid not seek to bind any parties. The decision was deny\nclass certification; the decision was not to bind any\nabsent class members.\nMoreover, in cases talking about adequate\nrepresentation, such as Hansberry v. Lee and the\nRichards case, one of the things this Court noted was\nthat normally you have a judgment that indicates who it\npurports to bind. There's nothing in the district\ncourt's initial judgment indicating that the absent\nclass members are bound by the denial of class\ncertification, nothing whatsoever.\nIn Devlin v. Scardelletti, which they say\nsupports their opinion, clearly it supports our\nposition, because that was a case dealing with a\ncertified class settlement, where there was objections.\nAnd because the objections were made and overruled, this\nCourt noted that those people could appeal directly\nwithout having to intervene in that case. And -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, you have to -- I\nthink you would concede that the Seventh Circuit's now\ntwo decisions, one in Bridgestone and then the other in\nThorogood -- the Seventh Circuit thinks it can do this.\nMR. MONAHAN: Yes, Your Honor, and the\nSeventh Circuit, for instance, in Bridgestone, which -\nwhich the Eighth Circuit relied on in this case,\nindicated that adequate representation was one of the\nfactors, our right to appeal was one of the factors, and\nthen our individual claims still existing, consisted\nsufficient due process. But, one, we had no notice, so\nhow can we appeal anything if we don't know it exists?\nAnd this Court has noted that in many cases, in Mullane\nand Richards and throughout, that if you have no notice\nof a matter, how can you ever have an opportunity to be\nheard, because you don't know about it?\nNow, as to adequate representation, that was\nsomething I wanted to turn to -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But just on notice, does\nthe record show when the client first came to the\nattorney?\nMR. MONAHAN: Your Honor, our case was filed\nin September 2001. The McCollins case was filed in\nAugust 2001, and nobody knew about the other one at all.\nI mean, these cases were filed almost the same time,\nless -- less than a month apart in different counties,\ndifferent attorneys, different named plaintiffs.\nI did want to note in Devlin v.\nScardelletti, Justice Scalia noted in his dissent that\nnot even petitioners were advancing \"the novel and\nsurely erroneous argument\" that absent class members\nwere considered parties before class certification.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Do we know that in the\nrecord, that the attorneys didn't even know about each\nother's cases? Is that borne out? I mean, is that an\nissue?\nMR. MONAHAN: Your Honor, we've argued that\nthroughout. We knew nothing about it. And see, the MDL\nproceeding -- we had, like, one or two cases that were\nfiled, individual actions where the plaintiffs did not\nwant to seek class action status, and those got removed\nto Federal court and transferred. The MDL court\nprovides notice of the orders affecting all cases in\ngeneral and then provides you with orders in your own\ncase. You do not get orders about other individual\ncases. So we never knew about McCollins when it was\nseeking class certification.\nI would note that the White case here in no\n-- no way vindicates the district court. The White case\ndid say that reliance did not have to be proven if you\nhave fraudulent concealment or suppression. Rather, the\nstandard is all you have to do is you have to show:\nWould an objectively reasonable person have bought the\nproduct had they known all of the information that was\nconcealed and suppressed? And, clearly, that can be\ndealt with on a common basis.\nBut a confusing aspect here, it seems like\nmany people try to argue that for class actions that you\nhave to have all common issues or else you can't have\none. And that's unfortunate because I'm not aware of\nany class action where you don't have at least -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Can I just go back to\nwhat you said before? I thought the West Virginia\nSupreme Court said you can't have actions for drugs\nunder the consumer whatever.\nMR. MONAHAN: Yes, they added -- they added\na syllabus point 6, the last paragraph of the opinion, a\nparagraph that says that, from now on, the -\nprescription drug purchasers cannot have such a claim.\nAnd that was unknown to anybody. It was not raised as\npart of a certified question and had not been litigated\nor argued. So that's part of the petition for\nrehearing, is my understanding.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel,\ncounsel.\n"
