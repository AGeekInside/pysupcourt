HUNGAR\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. HUNGAR: Thank you, Justice Scalia, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThe Federal Circuit's clear and convincing\nevidence standard ensures the enforcement of invalid\npatents, even though this Court recognized in KSR that\ninvalid patents stifle rather than promote the progress\nof liberal arts. Under this Court's decisions Grogan\nand Huddleston, the default preponderance standard\nshould govern in all cases because section 282 does not\nspecify a heightened standard of proof.\nAnd as this Court suggested in KSR, it makes\nno sense to have a heightened standard of proof when the\nrelevant prior art evidence was never even considered by\nPTO. Under any view, it was error to require clear and\nconvincing proof of invalidity in this case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It would be hard to\nargue, Mr. Hungar, that it makes no sense, but it made\nsense to Cardozo and Judge Rich.\nMR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, Justice Cardozo was\nnot addressing a case in which the evidence at issue had\nnot been considered by the Patent Office. To the\ncontrary, the Court made clear -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you can't keep\nshifting horses, now. Are you going to argue for all\nthe time, in which case, you can appeal to the general\nrule that we always apply, or are you going to say, oh,\nyes, we won't apply it normally but only when the prior\nart hadn't been considered? I mean, you -- you can't\nride both horses. They're going in different\ndirections.\nMR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, our position and\nour view of the correct interpretation of the statute is\nthat Grogan and Huddleston approach. The statute does\nnot specify a heightened standard; therefore,\npreponderance, the default standard; applies.\nI was attempting to answer Justice\nGinsburg's question about the RCA case. And the RCA\ncase didn't address the question that was discussed in\nKSR, but we believe, as I said, that the -- that the\npreponderance standard should govern across the board.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, you're contradicting\nCardozo?\nMR. HUNGAR: To the extent that -- that\nJustice Cardozo was discussing a heightened standard in\nthe limited context of priority inventions, we think\nthat that's not consistent with section 282, which, of\ncourse, came later. Moreover, I would note that the\nconcerns that undergirded the Court's heightened\nstandard in priority of invention cases, where -- those\nconcerns were addressed to the -- the problem of\nprimarily oral testimony being offered to substantiate\npriority of invention claims.\nThe Federal Circuit has separately addressed\nthat issue by means of its corroboration requirement,\nwhich operates separate and independent of the clear and\nconvincing evidence standard, so the concerns that\nundergirded RCA are -- are completely taken care of by\nthat as well.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But Justice Cardozo\ncertainly didn't limit his holding in the way you\nsuggest. The language of that opinion is extremely\nbroad. And if you read that opinion, no one would\ngather from that opinion the kinds of limits that you're\nsuggesting on it.\nMR. HUNGAR: Actually, Your Honor, I agree\nthat there is some grand language used in dictum in that\ncase. Certainly, the holding doesn't extend beyond\nthe -- what was presented before the Court. But,\nactually, if you read the language carefully, you'll see\nagain and again he refers to the fact that it's a\nquestion of -- of prior invention. He says when the\ndefense is a prior invention, and then he quotes the\nheightened standard on page 7. Again, on page 8, he\ntalks about the defense of invention by another.\nSo he -- and every single one of the cases\nthat he cites there, without exception in that\ndiscussion on pages 7 to 8, is a priority of invention\ncase, The Barbed Wire Patent case being the leading\nexample which had explained this rationale for a\nheightened concern in that specific context. But you\ndon't have cases applying -- Supreme Court cases\napplying the heightened standard in other contexts.\nAnd, indeed, you have many cases decided after RCA that\ndon't mention any heightened standard in viewing\ninvalidity questions.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But just taking RCA\nitself, Cardozo said through all the verbal variances\nthere runs this common core of thought and truth, that\none otherwise an infringer who assails the validity of a\npatent bears -- upon its face, bears a heavy burden of\npersuasion and fails unless his evidence has more than a\ndubious preponderance.\nMR. HUNGAR: Yes, Your Honor. And read -\ntaken out of context, that could have broad\nimplications, but the sentences before and after clearly\nmake -- indicate that he's talking about priority of\ninvention. He talks about the title of the true\ninventor and so forth. So -- so, again, that's what\nthose cases said, and that's what a fair reading of RCA\nsays.\nBut, regardless of the best reading of RCA,\nwe -- the -- the question here is what did Congress do\nin 1952? And we know that Congress in 1952 could not\npossibly have understood the law to be an\nacross-the-board clear and convincing evidence standard.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then you -- then you have\nto be saying that Judge Rich got it wrong because he\ndoes deal with the -\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, certainly -- yes, Your\nHonor, certainly we think American Hoist is wrong,\nalthough I would note that Judge Rich, in American Hoist\ndecision, says that the cases prior to 1952 were all\nover the map.\nBut -- but the relevant question is what\nwould Congress have thought the state of the law was in\n1952. If you think that there's any merit at all to the\njudicial codification argument, it's perfectly clear\nthat Congress could not have thought in 1952 that the\nlaw was an across-the-board heightened standard, because\ncase after case after case rejected the proposition that\nthere is a heightened standard or that the presumption\nwas unaffected when the evidence was not considered by\nthe Patent Office.\nThe -- we've cited numerous cases in our\nbrief at pages 34 through 36. The -- and we also in the\nreply brief at footnote 3 reference a list of over 200\ncases, some from before 1952 and some from after 1952,\nall recognizing that the presumption of validity was\nweakened or eliminated when the prior art evidence was\nnot considered by the Patent Office. So, you just -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Hungar, it seems\nto me that RCA would matter, even under your view of the\nworld, because if you think that Congress did not codify\nthe existing state of the law as to the standard of\nproof and you think that Congress -- that -- that\nsection 282 was essentially silent as to the standard of\nproof, then the question is, what do we do? And one\nanswer to that question is we go with our prior\nprecedent, which is RCA.\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, first of all, again,\nbecause RCA in context was a case where there was a\npriority of invention dispute that had been adjudicated\nin the Patent Office on the same evidence previously\nresolved by the Court, a priority of defense dispute,\nwhere the heightened standard cases had some\napplication, it clearly wouldn't affect the standards in\nthis case. But, more fundamentally, that's not what\nCongress thought in 1952, and when you don't have a\nclear rule to be codified, the default rules of\nstatutory construction apply. The default rule of\nstatutory construction in a -- on this question, in\nGrogan and Huddleston, the preponderance standard\napplies.\nAnd, moreover, while the statute does not\nspecify a heightened standard, it does actually speak to\nand -- and preclude the argument that i4i makes, because\nthe first sentence refers to patents being presumed\nvalid under this Court's precedent, a presumption shifts\nthe burden of going forward, and the second sentence of\nthe original statute refers to the burden of proof.\nUnder their interpretation, presumption does all the\nwork. The first sentence not only shifts the burden of\ngoing forward, also shifts the burden of proof, and does\nso under a heightened standard, which has never been how\npresumption is interpreted generally in the law, and it\nrenders the second sentence entirely superfluous.\nThere's no need for it.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It's -- it -- it is true\nthat the Federal Circuit has been consistent now since\nalmost the beginning, since that court came on the\nscene, and it does have a monopoly on appeal in patent\ncases since 1984. Because the -- the Federal Circuit\nhas consistently taken this position, one would have\nexpected that there would have been bills proposed to\nchange it. Were there any?\nMR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor, not that I'm\naware of. But I would note that this is, I think, i4i's\ncongressional acquiescence argument, if you will, and\nthat argument fails for numerous reasons.\nFirst of all, if there could be any\nacquiescence, and we don't think that the -- this\nCourt's extremely high requirements for such a claim\nhave been satisfied here, but if there could be any\nacquiescence at all, the first 30 years after enactment\nof the statute would be the most relevant consideration\nin determining what Congress had acquiesced in, and it's\nperfectly clear that the regional circuits all rejected\nthe across-the-board heightened standard that i4i is\narguing for.\nSo if Congress acquiesced in anything, it\nwas not an across-the-board heightened standard.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I -- I -\nhaving read some of those cases that you've cited that\nyou claim weakened or eliminated the burden of proof\nstandard, most of them didn't quite eliminate it.\nVirtually all of them added an instruction to the jury\nof some sort that said that the application of the\nstandard should take into account the fact that the PTO\ndid not consider evidence -- did not consider the prior\nart relied upon in the invalidity challenge.\nYou didn't ask for such an instruction in\nthis case; is that correct? And if you didn't, why\nisn't that adequate to convey the point that you're\ntrying to convey, that a jury should, in fact, consider\nthat the PTO never got to see that prior art?\nMR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, if I understand\nthe -- the question correctly, first of all, I would\ndisagree with the characterization of the cases, but\nwith respect to the preservation issue, we objected to\nthe clear and convincing evidence instruction, and we\nalso said that if -- if any instruction on the\nheightened standard is going to be given, it needs to\nreflect that -- the fact that, at least with respect to\nprior art combinations that were not considered by the\nPatent Office, the standard should be a preponderance.\nAnd, indeed, that's true of all of the prior art\ncombinations that were at issue in the case.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But other judges give a\nslightly different standard. They give a clear and\nconvincing standard, and they add a separate instruction\nthat tells the jury, in applying that standard, you\nshould consider the fact that the PTO did not see this\nevidence. You didn't ask for that?\nMR. HUNGAR: We didn't ask -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You just asked for the\npreponderance of the evidence charge?\nMR. HUNGAR: But, Your Honor, we did object\nto the clear and convincing evidence instruction, and so\nif -- we don't think that's the right answer, the more\neasily satisfied instruction, if that's what Your Honor\nis referring to. But if that were the court's\nconclusion, that that is in fact what the law requires,\nthen our objection to the clear and -- the unmodified\nclear and convincing evidence instruction would justify\na new trial here. But more fundamentally, even the\nFederal Circuit -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why?\nMR. HUNGAR: Because that in effect -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I mean, you said to the\njudge below: All you have to charge is preponderance of\nthe evidence. You never told him: Please explain to\nthe jury that under clear and convincing they can take\ninto account -\nMR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, that construction\nwould not solve the fundamental problem, which is that\nwhen the Patent Office didn't even consider the\nevidence, it makes absolutely no sense, as the KRSR\ncourt indicated, to have this heightened deference. The\nstatute requires a degree of deference by shifting the\nburden of proof and the burden of going forward, but for\ni4i to say that we need to go beyond what the\npresumption is, the normal default standard of\npreponderance, you need some heightened reason for that.\nThere's absolutely none, particularly when the Patent\nOffice didn't consider the evidence, didn't make a\ndecision, there was no decision and no evidence\nconsidered going to the relevant question. That's\nnot -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I have one question here I\nwould like to get your view on. I'll assume that the\nlanguage is open enough in the history so that we could\nmake what would be a change, I think it would be a\nchange. The reasons as I get from the brief for doing\nthat are because there are two types of errors: It's a\nbad thing not to give protection to an invention that\ndeserves it; and it is just as bad a thing to give\nprotection to an invention that doesn't deserve it.\nBoth can seriously harm the economy.\nAnd you are also saying that the Patent\nOffice is out of control, not through its own fault, but\nthere are too few people and too many inventions. And\ntherefore type two error is a real risk.\nSo I'm turning you to and say: Well, what\nshould we do about it? I know your proposal. But we\nhave also seen in these briefs the following proposal:\nOne, somebody who thinks there is a type two error, go\nback to the Patent Office and ask for reconsideration.\nThat's pretty good. We get the experts to look at it\nagain.\nAnd then that's coupled with: Tell the\ndistrict judges to stick very closely to their job,\nallow the clear and convincing standard to apply to\nfacts, and by that we mean brute facts, and let them\ndecide the brute facts, but let the judge decide whether\nthat amounts to obviousness, novelty, or any of the\nother prerequisites.\nNow, I've gotten that out of the amicus\nbriefs, some of which say they support you but they\nreally don't. So I would like -- I would like your\nviews on those two suggestions as being sufficient to\ncure the problem that you point to.\nMR. HUNGAR: Yes, Your Honor. First of all,\nwith respect to re-exam, re-exam is not a solution to\nthe problem or an answer to the absence of justification\nfor a heightened standard, for several reasons. First\nof all, re-exam is limited in scope. It can only\nconsider certain types of prior art evidence and issues.\nIt couldn't, for example -- it was not available for the\nissue that we're talking about here, the on-sale bar.\nThere are various issues, the section 112 issues, such\nas written description and best mode and the like, are\nnot susceptible of re-examination. Statutory subject\nmatter is not susceptible of re-examination. Many kinds\nof prior art, anything other than actual patents or\npublications, cannot be referenced in the examination.\nSo it is a limited mode of inquiry that does\nnot address many types of prior art that come up in many\ntypes of important cases, technology cases in\nparticular. So that's one reason why the re-exam\nsolution is not a problem, and of course it can't\npossibly be used to infer some intent on the part of\nCongress.\nI4i and the government try to suggest that\nthis was part of the scheme of Congress and this is why\nclear and convincing makes sense. But re-exam was\nenacted in 1980, long after the '52 act, so it doesn't\nshed light on Congress's intent in enacting section 282.\nAnd it was enacted before the Federal Circuit had\ncreated its heightened standard, so it can't possibly\nhave been an attempt to address the problems created by\nan across-the-board heightened standard that did not\nexist at the time. In 1980 the law was clear that a\npreponderance standard governed in most or all cases and\na preponderance standard, of course, governs in re-exam\nas well. So re-exam is not a solution. The more easily\nsatisfied instruction or that type of approach. If\nthat's what I understand -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm getting that out of the\nAmerican Intellectual Property Law Association. I don't\nblame them for my phrasing of it, but that is what\nstruck the thought in my mind that careful instructions\nlimiting the juries to brute facts and giving the judge\nthe notion, the job of characterizing that -- you heard\nwhat I said -- that that will go a long way towards\ncuring the problem you're worried about.\nMR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, I don't think it\naddresses the problem because the fundamental problem is\nimposing this heightened standard on the jury that has\nno moorings in the statute and no moorings in common\nsense, particularly in a case like this one where the\nrelevant evidence was not only not considered by the\nPatent Office but withheld from the Patent Office.\nUnder those circumstances -\nJUSTICE BREYER: It might not in your\nsituation. But the problem is in principle as it's put\nto us that the office and the Federal Circuit emerge\ngiving protection to things that aren't really novel,\nthat aren't really advances on the prior art, et cetera.\nNow, if that's the problem, and you carefully instruct\nthe jury, the bad fake patents will go away because the\njudge will say: Look, this metal case called a battery\nleakproof is not really novel.\nMR. HUNGAR: But, Your Honor, if that were\n-- the judge can't give an instruction like that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. The judge says: I\nwant you to find if this metal container is leak proof.\nJury: Yes. Now it's up to the judge.\nMR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, I think in many of\nthese cases it would be extremely difficult or\nimpossible for judge to fashion at that level of\nspecificity the factual issues to be considered by the\njury. But more fundamentally, if you're getting into\nthat level of detail and addressing questions that the\nPatent Office didn't even consider or certainly did not\nhave an opportunity to consider with the full array of\nprocedural advantages that litigation and discovery\noffer, it just makes no sense to impose a heightened\nstandard. As one of Your Honor's earlier questions\npointed out, the fundamental problem here is that the\ninterests on the i4i side of the equation, the policy\ninterests, are outweighed if anything by this Court's\nrepeated recognition that invalid patents stifle\ninnovation and competition and are very harmful.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Hungar, could we go\nback to the statute that was enacted in 1952. Before\nthat the burden of proof on the issue of validity of the\npatent or the effect of the patent, that was on the\nchallenger. So when Congress added a presumption of\nvalidity, it must have had in mind something more than\nthe defendant would have the burden of proof and the\nnormal standard is preponderance. So by adding a\npresumption of validity, must Congress have intended to\ndo something more than simply repeat that the defendant\nhas the burden of proof?\nMR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor. The law\nactually before 1952 was quite unsettled on that\nquestion, as we noted in our brief and as Judge Rich, I\nbelieve, noted in the American Hoist case, there were\nactually cases prior to 1952 saying that the burden was\non the patent HOLDER to establish a validity. So what\nCongress -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Burden of going forward or\nburden of persuasion?\nMR. HUNGAR: I believe -- you know, the\ncases aren't crystal-clear on that. I think certainly\nthey were talking about the burden of persuasion and\npresumably also the burden of going forward. But I\ndon't think -- I don't recall that they speak to that\nlevel of specificity.\nBut certainly there are cases saying the\nburden is on the patent holder. Congress overturned\nthose cases by imposing -- by stating in the second\nsentence that the burden of proof would be on the\ndefendant. But it only makes sense, as I indicated\nearlier, for Congress to have added that sentence if it\ndidn't view the presumption sentence as shifting the\nburden of proof to the defendant, let alone shifting it\nunder a heightened standard, so -\nJUSTICE ALITO: If the challenger has the\nburden of persuasion, wouldn't it almost go without\nsaying that the challenger would also have the burden of\nproduction on the issue of invalidity? So what would be\nadded then by -- what role is played then by that\nsentence, a patent shall be presumed valid?\nMR. HUNGAR: I think that's unclear, Your\nHonor. Certainly there are circumstances in which the\nparty with the ultimate burden of proof does not bear -\ndoes not have the burden of persuasion at every stage.\nAnd Congress -- there were also cases prior to 1952\nsuggesting that the presumption had gone away, that\nthere was no longer a presumption of validity or that\nthe presumption went the other way.\nAnd so again, Congress wanted to be clear;\nit was saying there is a presumption which shifts the\nburden of going forward under this Court's precedence,\nand there is a burden of proof on the defendant, and\nthat's all it did. To infer that it did something much\nmore, much more than the pre-1952 cases authorized -\nthere are literally dozens of pre-1952 cases cited in\nthat list of 200 cases referenced at footnote 3 of our\nbrief, from prior to 1952, rejecting the notion that\nthere's an across-the-board heightened presumption of\nvalidity; saying, no, if the evidence was not considered\nby the Patent Office or in some -- the Western Auto\ncase, for example, from the Sixth Circuit says well,\nthere's this -- the exception for oral testimony of\nprior invention, that's the RCA case; but everything\nelse is preponderance. So there's no -- there's no\nheightened presumption of validity in any other\ncircumstances.\nSo I think the law was clear, and the\ntreatises we cite at page 9 of our reply brief also make\nclear the treatise writers understood, there was no\nacross-the-board heightened presumption that it was\nweakened or eliminated when the evidence was not before\nthe Patent Office. And some of the cases said -\nactually RCA itself cites with approval two court of\nappeals cases that we note in our reply brief, the\nStudie case and the Wilson case, which rejected the\nnotion of a heightened standard across the board. They\nsaid well, that's true when the issue was adjudicated\nbefore the Patent Office, but here where the Patent\nOffice did not adjudicate the issue that doesn't apply.\nSo again you just can't get out of the pre-1952 case law\n-- the rule that i4i is urging.\nIf the Court has no further questions, I\nwould like to reserve my time.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. WAXMAN: Justice Scalia, and may it\nplease the Court.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Waxman.\nMR. WAXMAN: The long-settled, clear and\nconvincing evidence standard is correct, one, as a\nmatter of statutory interpretation, two, as a matter of\nstare decisis in a field in which stability is\nparticularly important, and, three, as a matter of first\nprinciples.\nAs to one, in 1952 Congress codified a long,\nuniform line of decisions from this Court holding that\nthe presumption of validity imposes a heightened burden\nof proof, a burden of proof that this Court in RCA\nunanimously described as, quote, \"clear and cogent\nevidence.\" And for the past 28 years Congress has\nactively acquiesced in the Federal Circuit's consistent\nholding expressly drawn from RCA that the standard is\n\"clear and convincing.\"\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How actively do we\nacquiesce?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, I would like that\nnotion of active acquiescence.\nMR. WAXMAN: I thought that might get a rise\nout of you.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. WAXMAN: I hope I'll get a chance to go\nto first principles, but having made that provocative\nstatement, the point is -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's like passive activity,\nright?\nMR. WAXMAN: I may want to submit a\nsupplemental brief on that point.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. WAXMAN: What I mean to say is that this\nis not a statute that Congress enacted and then forgot\nabout. This is a statute in which beginning in 1980,\neven before the Federal Circuit was created, Congress\nstarted amending the law to address the problem of\nlow-quality patents, with the first re-examination\nprocedure in 1980, any number of amendments, including\nto section 282, the creation of interparties\nre-examination in 1999, and the current consideration of\na post-grant review process.\nSo Congress has been very, very active in\nthis field, and what I mean by active acquiescence is it\nhas been very active in this field, it is well aware of\nthe clear and convincing evidence standard, and it has\ndone nothing whatsoever to change it, even make any\neffort to consider making such a sweeping change in\nlong-standing doctrine.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Waxman -\nJUSTICE ALITO: If I could take you back to\nfirst principles, which is where you started, I have\nthree problems in seeing your interpretation in the\nlanguage of section 282.\nFirst, the statute says the burden of\nestablishing invalidity of a patent, et cetera, et\ncetera, shall rest on the parties asserting such\ninvalidity. If Congress wanted to impose a clear and\nconvincing burden, why in the world would they not have\nsaid that expressly in that sentence?\nNumber two, if the first sentence, \"a patent\nshall be presumed valid,\" means that -- is talking about\nthe burden, then it's superfluous, because that's dealt\nwith in the second sentence.\nAnd, third, the phrase \"shall be presumed\nvalid\" doesn't seem to me at all to suggest clear and\nconvincing evidence. A presumption normally doesn't\nhave anything to do with clear and convincing evidence.\nMost presumptions can be disproved by much less than\nclear and convincing evidence. So how do you read that\nin -- your -- your position into the language of the\nstatute?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, as to presumptions\ngenerally, I found particularly persuasive your opinion\nfor the Third Circuit in GI Holding. But more -\nJUSTICE ALITO: I've gotten a lot smarter\nsince then.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. WAXMAN: More directly to the point, and\nwith all due deference to the sensibilities of the\npresiding Justice for this argument, when Congress\nenacted section 282 in 1952, the revisers note the House\nCommittee report, the Senate committee report said that\nthey were, quote, \"codifying the existing presumption of\npatent validity,\" and this Court had unanimously said -\nand this is language from RCA that Microsoft does not\naddress -- on page 2 of its opinion says, quote, \"even\nfor the purpose of a controversy of -- with strangers\nthere is a presumption of validity, a presumption not to\nbe overthrown except by clear and cogent evidence.\nNow, to be sure, that was dicta in the sense\nthat the case in itself involves a priority issue. But\nit was the holding of the Court 3 years later in Smith\nv. Hall; it was repeated on the very same day in Mumm,\nand it was -- the Court spent an entire page, I think\npage 7, the better part of page 7 and 8 of its opinion,\nexplaining that -- enunciating a general principle of\nthe law, and it would be a cruel joke on Congress to\nhave said, we are, when it said we are codifying the\nexisting presumption, that that presumption was not\nexactly what the Supreme -- the Supreme Court\nunanimously had said, which is a presumption not to be\noverthrown by clear and convincing evidence.\nNow, that's -- it's not that the first\nsentence uses the word presumption. It uses the word\nessentially presumption of patent validity, which is a\nfeature, a uniform feature of the Supreme Court's\njurisprudence since the Court first started addressing\nthis issue in 1873, and indeed when Justice Story first\ndecided the Washburn v. Gould case, there is -- their\nargument is the standard is a preponderance.\nThere is not one opinion, there is not one\nsentence, there is not one phrase in any of this Court's\nline of decisions that supports that proposition -- and\nwhen Judge Rich said in 19 -- shortly after 1952 that\nthere was some disarray in the courts' opinions, he\nwas -- and you can look at his opinion in context. He\nwas talking about lower court decisions that had either\nignored or misinterpreted this Court's very clear\nholdings -- holdings which, by the way, refute not only\ntheir argument for a universal standard, preponderance\nstandard, but directly refute their argument that there\nsomehow is some other standard of proof that applies\nwith respect to evidence that assertedly was not before\nthe Patent Office.\nThat was true of most of this Court's cases\ndecided before RCA, and for that matter after RCA.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Would you agree, looking\nto Judge Rich's opinions, that it would have been in\norder for the judge to instruct, if the judge had been\nasked to do so, that the evidence would carry more\nweight if it hadn't been presented, defendant's evidence\nwould carry more weight if it hadn't been presented to\nthe Patent Office?\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes, and the Federal Circuit\nhas said that over and over and over again. I mean, I'm\ngoing to quibble with the word \"would\" because I think\nthe actual language of the instruction can't invade the\nprovince of the jury. But you could -- certainly could\nsay that the defendant contends that the patent is\ninvalid because the law presumes that a patent issued by\nthe PTO is valid, the defendant bears the burden of\nproving invalidity by clear and convincing evidence, and\nin deciding whether the defendant has met that burden,\nyou may find it more easily met with evidence that you\nconclude the Patent Office did not consider in\nevaluating patentability.\nThat is the long-standing established rule\nof the Federal Circuit. It was stated, as was\nrecognized in American Hoist, in 1984, and the\nexplanation for it, Judge Rich's explanation is exactly\nthe same in cite that this Court's statement's in KSR\nis, which is that there -- there are -- there are\nreasons independent of deference to a particular PTO\ndecision that warrant a clear and convincing evidence\nstandard, and -- and this is key -- there is no case\nfrom this Court, to my knowledge, in Anglo-American\njurisprudence, that creates or sanctions a regime in\nwhich there are different standards of proof with\nrespect to a particular issue that a jury has to decide.\nThe question -- when there is -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, there are case -\nthere are cases in which the presumption disappears?\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, there -- are you\nreferring to cases of this Court?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. Well, I mean,\nthere -- there -- there are instances in which a\npresumption disappears and then the -- the parties begin\nagain with burden of persuasion, et cetera.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, okay. I'm -- I'm talking\nhere about -- the argument here is about the standard of\nproof, that is, a jury has to be instructed is it beyond\na reasonable doubt, is it preponderance, is it clear and\nconvincing? I'm not aware of any instance in\nAnglo-American jurisprudence, and certainly Microsoft\nand its amici have not cited one in which the jury is\ntold that depending on the weight you ascribe to the\nevidence you heard, you should apply a different\nstandard of proof.\nThe issue goes to the weight of the\nevidence. I mean, imagine a case in -- a regime in\nwhich you said, well, you've heard eyewitness testimony.\nIf you, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, find that the\neyewitness really had an unimpeded view, the standard is\npreponderance, but if you think that the view was\nimpeded or obscured, the standard is clear and\nconvincing evidence.\nThe -- the assertion that there was evidence\nthat the jury -- that the PTO didn't hear, and as the\nbriefs point out it is far from black and white what the\nPTO does or doesn't consider. And in addition the -\nit's far from clear whether the unconsidered evidence\nis, quote, more pertinent than evidence that was\nconsidered. Even assuming that, the jury is told, for\nreasons of first principles, that I will articulate in a\nmoment if left to my own devices, that the burden of\nproof is clear and convincing evidence, but you may find\nthat burden more easily met if you find that there was,\nin fact, evidence relating to validity that was not, in\nfact, considered by the PTO when it issued this property\nright.\nNow, the first -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn't there a lower\ncourt that has ruled that that standard, in the manner\nthat you've articulated, could confuse a jury as to what\nclear and convincing evidence means?\nMR. WAXMAN: The -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In fact, it's not clear\nand convincing evidence if you phrase it that way, that\nit's something less than that.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, I mean, a lot -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And so, the amici here\nhave suggested alternatives to that language that you're\nendorsing -\nMR. WAXMAN: There -- there are -- there are\nany number of formulations that trial courts have given.\nI think the one that would be clearest would be one that\nsays in deciding whether the defendant has met his\nburden, you may give added weight to evidence that you\nfind the PTO didn't consider in deciding validity.\nThe case I think you're referring to was\nMicrosoft's earlier case involving z4, where unlike this\ncase, Microsoft did ask for an instruction but it was\nrejected by the court -- it was -- it was rejected by\nthe court and found not to be an abuse of discretion.\nThe key point with respect to that instruction goes to\nthe articulation that was suggested earlier, because in\nthat case the instruction said you -- you make -- I\ninstruct -- I don't have it in front of me, but it was\nessentially a mandatory instruction to give greater\nweight or that the burden would be more easily met.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course the instruction\nthat you've proposed to the jury, like your adversary's\nproposition, would require determining what it was that\nthe Patent Office considered. So you -- you haven't\navoided the -- the -- the problem of litigating an -- an\nissue that -- that would better be avoided.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You have to do it for your\ninstruction just as -- as he will have to do it for his.\nMR. WAXMAN: There is a -- there is a great\ndifference, Justice Scalia, between telling individual\njurors what amount of weight they may or may not give to\ncertain evidence in creating a dual standard of proof\nwhich would, for reasons that -- that Microsoft's own\namici point out, requires -- would require the jury\nfirst to determine whether this evidence was or wasn't\nconsidered and was or wasn't more pertinent -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but your -- but your\ninstruction requires that, too. You're inviting the\nparties to litigate that issue so that the jury can be\ninstructed. If you -- if you find that it wasn't\nconsidered, you can give it -\nMR. WAXMAN: Justice Scalia, as -- as I\nthink all the parties agree, and we reflect the -- we\nreflect the -- the research, I believe, on footnote 12\nof our brief, the -- this point is argued in many, many,\nmany cases. That is -- and it was true in this case.\nEvidence is put on that the jury -- that the PTO didn't\nconsider this particular prior art, although, you know,\nin this case the file wrapper shows that there were five\nprior art rejections based on other art before the\npatent was allowed, and counsel argue it to and fro to\nthe jury, as the Allison and Lemley article points out,\nthe statistics bear out the common sense, which is that\njuries are, in fact, very influenced by the fact that\nthere was art going to or questioning validity that was\nnot considered by the PTO.\nIn other words, the instruction, whether the\ninstruction is necessary or not, juries get it, and\njuries apply it. What they're not required to do is\napply two different standards of proof following all\nsorts of predicate determinations that they would have\nto make.\nMay I simply list the first -- the first -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But -- but why -- why -\nwhy not, Mr. Waxman? If the whole reason for this extra\ndeference, for this clear and convincing standard is a\nPatent Office is expert and so we defer juries similarly\nto defer to their judgment, but if they haven't judged\nanything, what is the justification for continuing to\nhave the clear and convincing standard?\nMR. WAXMAN: There -- here are four\nindependent principles that justify the clear and\nconvincing evidence standard across the board regardless\nof what the jury considered.\nNumber one, an infringer's validity\nchallenge is a collateral attack on a government\ndecision that has already been made, quite unlike Grogan\nand Huddleston, that bestows property rights by written\ninstrument.\nNumber two, the harm from an erroneous\ndetermination is hugely asymmetrical. A single holding\nof invalidity by a single lay jury vitiates for all time\nthe patent and all of the reliance interest by the\ninventor and the investors and the licensees who have\nrelied upon that ex ante.\nThird, this grant of property rights not\nonly induces reliance, which lack, like the land patent\ncases induce reliance, this is a grant of a property\nright that under the Constitution is specifically\ndesigned to induce reliance in exchange for the\ninventor's honoring her half of the patent bargain, that\nis public disclosure of her intellectual property for\nthe public benefit, and the commitment of capital by\ninvestors and licensees that's necessary to bring into\nfruition for the public benefit.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Isn't there a limited amount\nof reliance that any patent holder can have, given the\nre-exam system?\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes, and the fact -- yes, the\nre-examine system -- I think your point actually, I wish\nI had thought to make this point myself. Re-examine is\noften invoked by the patent holder. That is, because\nre-exam is done by the expert agency and allows the\npatent -- allows the agency not to have a binary choice\nof yes, the patent's fine or no, it's invalid for all\ntime, but can narrow the scope of the patent in re-exam,\nmany re-exams are requested by the patent holder.\nAnd more -- and also, when you request\nre-examination or when the PTO makes a re-exam decision,\nthat decision is good for all time, whichever way it\ngoes, unlike the stark asymmetry in trial court\nlitigation where the patent holder has to win 100\npercent of the time. If the patent holder loses once,\nthe patent under nonmutual offensive collateral\nestoppel, Blonder-Tongue, the patent is out. And I\nshould point out that this Court's opinion in\nBlonder-Tongue, which of course was a case about patent\nvalidity -\nJUSTICE BREYER: All those first principles\nare along the lines of how important patents are and\nwhat a disaster is it is to the person once they're\ninvalidated. Okay. I think the other side will say:\nIn today's world, where nobody really understands this\ntechnology very well, a worse disaster for the country\nis to have protection given to things that don't deserve\nit because they act as a block on trade, they act as\nmonopolies, and they will tie the country up in\nindividual monopolies that will raise prices to\nconsumers, et cetera. You can imagine my spelling out\nthis argument.\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So I can't work out in my\nown mind whether in today's world these first principles\ncut for the patentee or cut for the challenger to the\npatent.\nMR. WAXMAN: Those are policy arguments that\nhave -\nJUSTICE BREYER: And the first are not?\nMR. WAXMAN: Excuse me? No, the fact that\n-- the fact that it's a collateral challenge on a\ngovernment decision bestowing property rights by written\ninstrument, no. The fact that the harm from an\nerroneous decision is totally asymmetrical, no. The\nfact that what Congress intended was that this grant of\nproperty rights actually induced reliance, and\nfinally -- and this is my final first principle, I\nsuppose -- that changing this long-standing standard\nwould marginalize the PTO, the expert agency that we\nknow Congress created to superintend the issuance and\nre-examination of patents, and to the extent that there\nare significant policy concerns which I agree with -\nmay I finish my sentence?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Finish your sentence.\nMR. WAXMAN: - which I agree with: A,\nCongress is on the job; and, B, there is -- those policy\nreasons say nothing about what Congress thought about\nthe Patent Office in 1952 when it applied this Court's\nunanimous presumption.\nThank you.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Thank you, Mr. Waxman.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Stewart, we'll hear\nfrom you now.\nMR. STEWART: Justice Scalia, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI would like to begin by addressing briefly\nthis Court's decision in RCA, because I think it's\nimportant to notice not only that Justice Cardozo used\nfulsome and extensive language that was intended to\nsweep broadly and that was intended to announce a\ncategorical rule; the other thing is the discussion in\nRCA was intended and was set forward as a recapitulation\nof prior doctrine. That is, Justice Scalia -- Justice\nCardozo did not purport to announce for the first time a\nrule as to the weight that should be given a prior\npatenting decision. He explained that this is what the\nCourt had done since the latter part of the 19th century\nand in fact it had been done by Justice Story riding\ncircuit in the early part of the 19th century.\nAnd the court in RCA said a patent is\npresumed to be valid until the presumption has been\novercome by convincing evidence of error. The\nrequirement of heightened proof was part and parcel of\nthe presumption itself in the same way that I think most\nlawyers in this country would say that the requirement\nof proof beyond a reasonable doubt is part and parcel of\nthe presumption of innocence in criminal cases. If a\nnew criminal statute were enacted saying that the\ndefendant is presumed innocent, but the presumption can\nbe overcome by a preponderance of the evidence, that\nmight be a presumption of innocence, but it wouldn't be\nthe presumption of innocence as it's historically been\nunderstood in our country.\nThe second thing I would say about\nCongress's presumed intent when it acted in 1952 was\nthat, at least when this Court's precedents are clear,\nCongress when it uses words that come right from those\ncases should be presumed to have codified this Court's\nholdings, not the decisions of lower courts that may\nhave deviated from this Court's instructions. And I\nthink the presumption that Congress acts against the\nbackground of existing law, it's less a prediction or an\nassessment of what percentage of the legislature were\nactually aware of the details of RCA. It's more a\nmethod of making the system work, by telling\nconscientious legislators: If you do read up, if you do\nunderstand the contours of Supreme Court's decisions,\nyou can be confident that your words will be -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, the problem\nwith your argument, assuming its validity, is why do you\nneed the second sentence? If Congress was intending to\nsweep up in the use of the word \"presumption\" the need\nto overturn it by clear and convincing evidence, why did\nyou need the second sentence saying that the other side\nnow bore the burden of persuasion?\nMR. STEWART: I think there is a belt and\nsuspenders quality to the statute, no matter how you\nparse it, but I think that Microsoft has essentially the\nsame problem, because they have constructed a theory\nunder which the second sentence does something that the\nfirst has not, does not, but they haven't constructed\nany theory as to why the first sentence is not\nsuperfluous. That is, given the second sentence to the\neffect that the burden of establishing invalidity is on\nthe challenger, there's no more work to be done by the\nfirst sentence.\nThe other thing I would say in response to\nJustice Alito's question, which also goes to the natural\nmeaning of the statute, Justice Alito asked, I think,\nbasically, if these precedents were not on the book and\nwe were just looking fresh at the language, what would\nwe assume the standard to be? And I think we would say,\nlet's look at what the defendant is asking the judge or\njury to do. The defendant is asking the judge or jury\nto set aside a decision that has been made by then the\nPatent Office, now the PTO, and we would ask what sort\nof standard of proof ordinarily applies when a litigant\nasks a court to set aside an administrative decision.\nIn a sense, this court had a variant of that\nproblem a few years ago in Dickinson v. Zurko, which\ndealt with direct court of appeals review of a denial by\nthe PTO of a patent applicant's application, and the\nstatute clearly authorized judicial review in the\nFederal Circuit, but said nothing about what standard\nwould apply. And the Court said in the absence of a\nconflicting standard imposed by the statute, we will\nlook to background principles and administrative law,\nand the standard will be substantial evidence. And\nthat's basically what this Court said back in 1894 in\nMorgan v. Daniels. It said the reason that we apply a\nheightened standard when an individual attacks the\nvalidity of an issued patent is that that litigant is\nasking the Court to set aside a decision made by the\nappropriate executive branch agency.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But that ground doesn't\ncarry very much weight when the matter was never\nconsidered by the PTO.\nMR. STEWART: I think you are correct that\nif Congress had focused specifically on the category of\ncases in which the only evidence brought forward to show\ninvalidity had not been considered by the PTO, it might\nhave addressed that separately. In our view there are\nthree independent reasons that it makes sense to apply a\nheightened standard even in that category of cases. The\nfirst two have to do with the interests of the patent\napplicant, the third has to do with the interests of the\nPTO.\nThe first one is that the patent -- the\ngrant of a patent has historically been understood to\nreflect a quid pro quo between the applicant and the\ngovernment, and the applicant's part of the bargain was\ndisclose that which might otherwise be maintained as a\ntrade secret, and the government's part of the bargain\nwas give a period of exclusivity.\nAnd I think there is a thread in this\nCourt's cases, especially in the barbed wire patent\ncases, to the effect that once the patent applicant has\nhonored his part of the bargain a court should be\nhesitant to essentially deprive him of the benefit for\nwhich he contracted unless the evidence is clear. The\ncourt in the barbed wire patent cases said that whatever\ndoubts there may be as to whether the patentee was\nactually the first inventor should be resolved in the\npatentee's favor because without question he was the one\nwho first disclosed the information to the public, made\nit available to the public through the patent\napplication process itself.\nThe second is related to the patentee's\nreliance interests, but is more instrumental. That is,\nindependent of our concerns for fairness to the patent\napplicant, Congress could reasonably determine that\nthere are enough uncertainties along the way to getting\na patent, to having it overturned on various other\ngrounds that in an invalidity suit the patent -- the\npatentee should have reasonable confidence that it won't\nbe overturned unless the evidence is clear.\nAnd I would like to respond briefly to Your\nHonor's question, Justice Kagan, about why isn't that\ndiminished by the re-examination process. I think it is\ndiminished somewhat. Re-examination is different both\nbecause it's done by the expert agency and because it's\nmore nuanced. There is. The option to narrow the\nclaims to revise the language. It's not a blunderbuss\ntool, like setting it aside. But I would still\nacknowledge the force of your observation that to some\nextent, the patent holder's confidence would be greater\nif there were no re-examination process at all. And I\nguess I would say this is just one aspect of the patent\nlaw's balancing of competing interests in a way that\ndoesn't serve either to the exclusion of the other; and\nto use an obvious analogy, the current term of patent\nprotection is 20 years from the -- the date of the\napplication. Obviously Congress thought 20 years was\nbetter than 10 and presumably that was because 20 years\ngives greater incentive to innovation. If somebody\nasked -\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why is -- why is\nre-examination sufficient to answer the concerns that\nJustice Breyer mentioned, when re-examination can't\nconsider certain issues, and a case such as this doesn't\nnecessarily have to be stayed while re-examination takes\nplace?\nMR. STEWART: It's not fully sufficient to\nresolve all challenges to the -- the validity of an\nissued patent. Now Congress now has it before it\nlegislative proposals, one of which has passed the\nSenate, one of which has been voted out of committee in\n-- in the House, and is currently pending before the\ncourt -- the full -- full House of Representatives, that\nwould expand the availability of post, what we now call\npost-grant review proceedings, where for a limited\nwindow of time after a patent is issued, people who\noppose the issuance of the patent can come in and object\non any ground. And that wouldn't be limited to the -\nthe grounds that are specified in the current\nre-examination proceeding.\nSo this would -- it reflects Congress's\nunderstanding that there is a problem with patents that\nshould not have been issued, but its desire to create\nadditional mechanisms for the PTO to address that\nproblem, rather than to have it be done through\nlitigation. But that -- the point I was going to make\nabout the 20 and the 10 years is somebody could ask,\nwell if 20 years is better than 10, why wouldn't 30 be\nbetter than 20? And the only answer is 30 presumably\nwould give the patentee even more -- or the potential\npatentee even more incentive to invent, but at a certain\npoint Congress decides that countervailing\nconsiderations require an end.\nAnd it has essentially done something of the\nsame thing with re-examination. It said we're not going\nto go so far in the direction of protecting patent\nholders' reliance interests as to preclude the PTO from\nreassessing what it's done, but that doesn't mean that\nreliance interests aren't important.\nAnd the third thing I would say is even when\na defendant in an infringement suit comes forward with\nprior art that was not itself considered by the PTO,\nthere's always the possibility that that prior art will\nbe substantively equivalent to prior art that the PTO\ndid consider; and so in cases like this, in form the\ndefendant would be asking the jury to make a\ndetermination that the PTO had never made, but in\nsubstance, what the defendant would be asking the jury\nto do is conclude that what the PTO thought was a\npatentable advance really was not so.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Thank you, Mr. Stewart.\nMr. Hungar, you have 8 minutes for rebuttal.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. HUNGAR\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. HUNGAR: Thank you, Justice Scalia. A\nfew points that I would like to make.\nFirst of all, with respect to the suggestion\nthat the jury should be instructed on the weight to be\ngiven various forms of evidence, I note that in the z4\ncase that's been discussed, the Federal Circuit rejected\nthe very, quote, \"more easily carried,\" closed quote,\ninstruction that i4i suggests as the solution, and it\ndid so because it would confuse the jury about what the\nstandard is.\nHaving effectively three standards of proof\nin patent cases rather than two is hardly a solution to\nthe problem; but more fundamentally, whatever\ninstructions might or might not be appropriate regarding\nthe particular evidence before the jury, there has to be\na justification for departing from this default\npreponderance standard, and no sufficient justification\nhas been offered.\nThe statute doesn't provide for it, the\nlegislative history doesn't reference it, the pre-1952\ncase law can't reasonably be read in that way. That the\n-- i4i and its amici do not point to a single case in\nthe -- in the years leading up to 1952, the 15 or so\nyears prior where a court of appeals or any court or any\ncommentator said that the rule is clear and convincing\nevidence across the board. No one understood that to be\nthe rule. No one read RCA that way. Congress would not\nhave done so, either, so you can't get there under\ncodification. You certainly can't get there under\nprinciples of administrative deference. Even the\ngovernment admits those that principles don't justify a\nheightened standard.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What about the rule where\n-- I'm trying this on, I don't buy it necessarily -- the\n-- the heightened standard exists where the Patent\nOffice did consider it or could have considered it had\nthe infringer asked for reconsideration?\nIn other words, put the burden on the\ninfringing party to use this procedure, and if he does\nuse it, it's going to get a heightened burden if he\nloses -\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, first -\nJUSTICE BREYER: And if he doesn't use it,\nit should get a heightened burden because he should have\nused it.\nMR. HUNGAR: First of all, Your Honor, I\ndon't see that any way you can get that out of the\nstatute. But it also wouldn't work, because re-exams -\nJUSTICE BREYER: The statute itself doesn't\n-- we're all going on history here, I mean, and history\nbrought up to date with the words of the statute I don't\nthink cover it either way. They talk about presumption,\nbut put that to the side.\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, there -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I wanted your opinion on\nthat as the validity or a useful instruction for juries.\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, Congress certainly\ncouldn't have intended that in 1952 because it hadn't\nyet created re-examination.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm not asking that\nquestion. I'm asking the question of whether in your\nexperience as a patent lawyer or -- would -- what we're\ntrying to do is we're trying to get a better tool, if\npossible, to separate the sheep from the goats. That's\nwhat we're after, I think, and so what is that better\ntool?\nMR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, as you know,\nre-exam is not available for many of the types of\ninvalidity issues that arise. But in any event, if -\nif -- if the Court had such a rule, the problem is,\nre-exam takes a long time, patents plaintiffs generally\noppose stays of litigation for re-examination, because\nthey want to get to the jury because they know that\njuries are much more likely to uphold patents than\neither judges or the Patent Office on re-exam. So they\nwant to get the case litigated as quickly as possible so\nyou get through the court system before the re-exam has\nbeen completed.\nSo to the -- in fact if it were true, as\nsome of the amici argue, that a patent applicant -\npatent holders are afraid of juries and want the experts\nat PTO to resolve the questions, which we don't think as\na -- as a factual matter is accurate, but if that were\ntrue, the patent applicant, the patent holder has the\nabsolute right to initiate re-exam themselves, and they\ncould certainly go to the court and say please stay\nproceedings pending re-examination. Normally when -\ncourts refuse to stay proceedings, because they don't\nwant to prejudice the plaintiff, who is opposing a stay,\nbut if the plaintiff is asking for a stay, there's not\ngoing to be any problem.\nSo the system already permits patent holders\nto -- to -- to follow that procedure and get\nre-examination if they want it. The problem is they\nusually don't. And in fact a preponderance standard\nwould encourage that.\nWith respect to the reliance arguments, the\nre-examination problem we think addresses that. The\nfact that this is a procedural rule under this Court's\nprecedence makes clear that reliance interests are\nlessened. In any event, the reliance interests aren't\nnearly as strong as the same arguments made by many of\nthe same parties in KSR, and MedImmune and eBay where\nthis Court was not persuaded. It should not be\npersuaded here, either.\nWith respect to the legislative history that\nthey rely on, if you're going to look at the legislative\nhistory, what it actually says is that Congress is\nreferring to the presumption as stated by the courts,\nplural -- not the Supreme Court, courts plural -- so if\nyou're going to look at legislative history it actually\nmakes clear that Congress was not looking only at the\nRCA case which is not even referenced in the legislative\nhistory, but was looking at rule as it was understood to\nexist in 1952, which is not the rule that i4i urges.\nWith respect to the -- the presumption\npoint, the presumption clearly does serve a purpose, the\npresumption language in the statute, by overturning the\ncourts -- the prior to 1952 decisions that had rejected\nthe presumption, and by making clear that the burden of\ngoing forward is on the defendant, so the plaintiff\ndoesn't have the burden that it would otherwise have of\npleading and putting forward evidence at trial of\nvalidity.\nFor all these reasons, we ask that the\njudgment of the court of appeals be reversed.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Thank you, Mr. Hungar.\n"
