GOLDSTEIN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nWhen the Texas courts in this case\nreinstated the Petitioner's direct appeal, the Texas\nCourt of Appeals decided that appeal like it would\ndecide any other case on direct review. We filed a\npetition for discretionary review in the Texas Court of\nCriminal Appeals, which was denied, and it was\nconsidered like any other appeal would be.\nThe question presented by this case is\nwhether the final judgment that indisputably results\nfrom those rulings triggers the one-year statute of\nlimitations to file a Federal habeas corpus application.\nThe statute that governs that question is reproduced in\nthe blue brief at page 1.\nSection 2244(d)(1)(A) prescribes \"a 1-year\nperiod of limitation that shall apply to an application\nfor a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody\npursuant to the judgment of the State court. The\nlimitation period shall run from the latest of -- and it\nidentifies four dates, the first of which is \"the date\non which the judgment became final by the conclusion of\ndirect review or the expiration of time for seeking such\nreview.\"\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And you don't think you\nneed to go beyond (A) to resolve the case?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: That's right, Justice\nKennedy. Subsection (A) resolves this case by its plain\nterms.\nNow, the Fifth Circuit decided this case --\nthis issue, I'm sorry -- in 2004 in a case called\nSalinas, and it thought that the factual scenario of the\ncase was more logically covered by subsection (d)(2) of\nthe statute, which is on page 2 of the blue brief. And\nthat provision is the tolling provision, and it says:\n\"The time during which a properly filed application for\nState post-conviction or other collateral review with\nrespect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending\nshall not be counted toward any period of limitation\nunder the subsection.\"\nAnd the Fifth Circuit's view in that Salinas\ncase was that the better way of looking at this is that\nwhen the State post-conviction court awarded relief of\nfurther direct review, all of that should be regarded as\npart of the post-conviction process. But four years\nafter -- three years after the Fifth Circuit decided\nSalinas, this Court decided Lawrence v. Florida, and\nLawrence disposes of the Fifth Circuit's logic in\nSalinas, because Lawrence says that when the\npost-conviction court, here the Texas Court of Criminal\nAppeals, issues its mandate the application for\npost-conviction review is no longer pending. And so\nthere isn't any reason to believe that Congress thought\nthis factual scenario was covered by the tolling\nprovisions of (d)(2).\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, does your\nposition depend upon the proposition that we are not\nfree to consider sort of a second direct appeal as part\nof the collateral review process?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: It doesn't depend on it,\nMr. Chief Justice. We don't have to reach that question\nbecause, as I have said in answer to Justice Kennedy's\nquestion, you can resolve this under (d)(1). But I was\njust trying to explain why the Fifth Circuit, which\nstruggled with how to handle this scenario, was wrong in\nthinking it was governed by the tolling provision.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess it\ndoesn't -- or does it really make a difference? I mean,\nif you view the direct appeal that is the result of the\ncollateral review process as part of the collateral\nreview process, that time is tolled. And if you take\nyour view and regard it as not final to trigger the\nprocess until you have another final decision, it kind\nof leads to the same result, doesn't it?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: In many cases, but not all,\nincluding this one. The difference is that if you\nregard this as governed by tolling, that the second --\nwhat we will call for purposes of the argument, just so\nwe know, the second appeal, so the appeal that's granted\nby the post-conviction report, if you regard the proper\nway of reading 2244 to be you have to regard that as\nbeing tolled and the start date is the dismissal of the\noriginal appeal, if the State Petitioner seeks\npost-conviction review more than one year after the\ndismissal of the first appeal, his Federal time is done.\nSo, this --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But does that really\nmatter? I mean, the whole purpose of the Federal\nstatute of limitations is to make sure these things get\ndone within one year. And if he waits a year before\nfiling, then he's out of time under AEDPA.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: It is -- it is the case that\nCongress wanted it done within one year. The question\npresented by this case is one year of what?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: So, there are four different\npossible start dates. We know that the Fifth Circuit\nwas wrong in the Salinas case when it said that Congress\nenvisioned only a linear time period stopped only by\ntolling that would run from the first disposition of the\ncase, because 2244(d)(1)(B), (C), and (D) are all\nprovisions under which the time can expire and then be\nrestarted.\nSo, what we think Congress wanted when it\nwas picking start dates and the start date in (d)(1)(A),\nthe one that usually applies, is it wanted the State\ncourts on direct review to be done with the case, finish\nit off. Then the State petitioner will have one year to\nstart the State post-conviction process and when that's\ndone go on to Federal court.\nThe reason we think Congress wanted to\ninclude the second appeal, the conclusion of the second\nappeal, as the trigger is that what's going on in the\nFederal district court is you are trying to decide if\nthe State court's disposition of the case is contrary to\nclearly established law as established by this Court.\nAnd you won't know that, you won't even know what the\nFederal district court is supposed to be reviewing,\nuntil the conclusion of the second appeal.\nIf I could just illustrate that, in the\njoint appendix at page 43, is the State court opinion in\nthis case. The Texas Court of Appeals decided this case\nand resolved his, the Petitioner's, Federal\nconstitutional claims. And it only did that in the\nsecond appeal. And that's what Congress was concerned\nwith the Federal district court's reviewing. It's --\nwhen this opinion is issued and then the Texas Court of\nCriminal Appeals, which is their highest court in\ncriminal cases, denies review, then it's logical for the\ntime period to start.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In the background of this\ncase, Mr. Goldstein, is that in fact he didn't know the\nfirst time that his appeal had been dismissed. He\ndidn't know that his lawyer had filed an Anders brief.\nBut when he found that out, he waited some four and a\nhalf years.\nSo why isn't the -- Texas right\nwhen it says look at (B) and (D), they would have fit\nhis case? He could have used those to get time starting\nfrom the date that he found out. It wouldn't give him\nfour and a half years. But why -- you say we, all we\nhave to consider is (A); you said that in answer to\nJustice Kennedy. But why shouldn't we say that either\n(B) or (D) fits his case?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay, can I answer that\nquestion, Justice Ginsburg, in two parts?\nFirst most directly, I want to explain our\nposition with respect to (B) and (D) and then I want to\ndiscuss the broad thematic concern that's raised by our\ncase. Here's the troubling fact by our case, and that\nis the prospect that multiple State defendants will take\nmore than a year, and I would like to deal with that\nthematic point and explain why I don't think that's a\nconcern.\nBut to start directly with your point, (B)\nand (D), assuming that they apply for a moment, will\nonly accomplish the following -- and then I want to\nexplain why I don't think they would apply. But even if\nthey apply, what they would do is defer the start date\nof the one year. So on the facts in this case, one year\nafter -- 11 months or so after the Texas Court of\nAppeals erroneously dismissed the Petitioner's first\ndirect appeal without giving him the opportunity to file\na pro se brief, he found out.\nOn the State's view, the one-year Federal\nhabeas corpus time would be deferred for 11 months, and\nthat is a very generous defendant-favoring position for\nTexas to take in this Court. If it then starts, it\ndoesn't -- that reading does not accomplish what\nCongress wanted in 2244, because the State prisoner,\nthough the time will have been deferred for a year, will\nstill have to file for Federal habeas corpus within a\nyear, notwithstanding the fact that he will get a second\ndirect appeal.\nSo he will be proceeding in both courts.\nHis start date will have been deferred for 11 months,\nbut he nonetheless one year later must appear in a\nFederal district court in Texas, even though on\npost-conviction review in the State courts he is sent\nback to direct review.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, but is that\nright? I mean unless you count, as I gather your\nfriends on the other side would do, the period of direct\nappeal as part of the collateral review process?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: That's correct. And that's\nthe argument about Lawrence. That argument is not\nsustainable in light of Lawrence. Just to say that you\nhave their argument exactly right, Mr. Chief Justice,\nthe State's position is, as the Fifth Circuit held in\nthe Salinas case, that when you get relief on\npost-conviction review and you are sent back to the\nState system, (d)(2) continues to apply, but that is not\ncorrect. The tolling stops, and that is because, as\nLawrence held, the application which is his\npost-conviction application in the State court, saying\nthat I was deprived of my right to appeal, is no longer\npending. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has issued\nits mandate. So that's why this anomaly arises under\nthe application of (B) or (D) that we don't think\nCongress could have intended.\nNow, Justice Ginsburg, there is a second\npart to my answer, and that is the specific point about\nwhether (B) and (D) do by their terms apply; and here we\nare in the anomalous position that if, again, Texas is\narguing very defendant-favoring readings of (B) and (D)\nand I, representing the habeas Petitioner, am in the\nunusual role of questioning whether these later start\ndates apply.\nBut here our -- the lower courts I think it\nis clear would say that (B) and (D) don't apply. To\ntake you to the textual -- the text of the statute,\nagain, (B) appears at the bottom of page 1 of the blue\nbrief; and that has a start date of the date on which\nthe impediment for filing an application created by\nState action in violation of the Constitution or laws of\nthe United States is removed, if the applicant was\nprevented from filing by such State action. And the\nlower courts, as we explained in our brief, pretty\nuniformly conclude that the failure to give a defendant\nnotice that his appeal has been dismissed is not an\nimpediment created by State action to him filing a\nFederal habeas corpus application. And so their attempt\nto grapple with our unusual facts has -- would\nsubstantially broaden the application of subsection (B).\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about the State\nconvicting, penalizing the defendant despite the fact\nthat his constitutional right to competent counsel\nwas -- he lost that right because of the failure of\nnotification?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: It's just -- it's not\nregarded as an impediment. The -- the courts -- the\nlower courts take quite literally that there has to be\nan impediment. The lower court decisions grappling with\nwhat an impediment is deal with the situation where a\nprison warden, for example, does not allow you access to\nthe prison mails or somehow access to the legal\nresources you in order to be able to file it. He won't\ndeliver the habeas corpus application.\n(D) is even easier, I think, and that is the\ndeadline starts from the date on which the factual\npredicate of the claim or claims presented could have\nbeen discovered through the exercise of due diligence.\nAnd the reason the State is not right about that\nprovision and does not even really seriously argue it is\nthat the claims referenced in (D) are the claims that\nare presented in the Federal habeas corpus application.\nHere that's the claim that he had ineffective assistance\nof trial counsel and that the judge was biased against\nhim. They are not the claim that he received -- that he\nwas denied the right to an appeal. And so it just --\nthere is no textual basis to say that the later start\ndate would apply under (D).\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is this just a\ndispute about the label? Because Texas chooses to call\nthe proceeding that you get if you are successful on\ncollateral review a second direct appeal, you would\ncount finality one way; if they just switch the label\nand say that is the collateral review appeal process,\nthen you would agree with them?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: No, sir. We think that you\nhave to look at substance. As -- the language that we\nuse in a footnote in our reply brief addressing this is\nwhether the proceeding has the hallmarks of direct\nreview. There are two States that do have a procedure,\nSouth Carolina and Delaware, in which you can raise your\nclaim on post-conviction review that you were deprived\nof your right to a direct appeal. And the\npost-conviction court has the power to decide that on\npost-conviction review.\nWe haven't found a case in which they actual\nexercised the power, but it appears that 48 of the 50\nStates deal with this problem the way Texas does, and\nthat is the relief that you get is that you are sent\nback into the direct review system. And then we think\nit's covered quite plainly by the text of (d)(1). When\nthat direct review is over, direct review concludes by\nits plain terms.\nNow, Justice Ginsburg, I had said that I\nwanted to come back and deal with the thematic problem\nthat might concern the Court about our case, and that is\nthe prospect that we will have defendants filing State\npost-conviction applications more than a year late,\nwhich could trouble the Court. As the Chief Justice\nindicated, Congress had a concern with moving this\nprocess along.\nIn addition just to the plain text of the\nstatute which we think is controlling, there are I think\nthree points. The first is there are State limitations\nprinciples that get these State prisoners to file their\napplications in a timely way. Now, in the great\nmajority of States that's set by a number of years. In\nsome States like Texas it's applied by the principle of\nlaches. And the important point and the reason we are\nhere today is that Texas, for whatever reason -- and the\ntime limitations are intended to protect Texas here --\ndecided not to assert that his State post-conviction\napplication was untimely. It didn't object to the\ngranting of relief to the Petitioner at all.\nThe second reason, in addition to the\nState's own limitations period, is that the AEDPA\none-year limitations period has real force. In the\ngreat majority of cases in which a State defendant is\ngoing to allege that he was deprived of his right to an\nappeal and raise that claim on State post-conviction\nreview, he's going to lose that claim. The -- the\nStates don't give this stuff out like candy, and the\nTexas Court of Criminal Appeals is not, you know,\nconstantly reinstating defendant's appeals. And\ndefendants know that.\nAnd unless you prevail on this claim, you\nare stuck with the one-year AEDPA time that runs from\nthe dismissal of your first appeal. And so you have\nevery incentive in the world to get into State court\nquickly.\nAnd the third is just the general notion\nthat defendants in non-capital cases don't have a real\nincentive to just delay before instituting a State\npost-conviction review. And --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose it is denied by --\nby the State court. And suppose it's denied by the\nState court more -- more than a year after the\nconclusion of the original proceeding. What -- what is\nthe consequence then?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I -- can I just ask one\npoint of clarification? If he instituted it more than a\nyear after the dismissal of the first proceeding, he is\nout of time, because there is only one final judgment,\nand that is the original dismissal.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose he institutes it,\nhowever, within the year.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay. If he instituted\nit -- can I just say six months? So six months' after\nthe first dismissal, the Petitioner appears in the Texas\npost-conviction court. At that point (d)(2) starts to\napply, because he has a properly filed application for\nState post-conviction relief. The State court -- the\nState post-conviction court takes three months to\ndispose of it, a year to dispose of it; it doesn't\nmatter. When the State post-conviction court is done\nand in your hypothetical denies him relief, he has six\nmonths left to go to federal district court. (d)(2)\noperates as it should. While the case is sitting in the\nState post-conviction court --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And he can't go to Federal\ncourt until that is resolved?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: That is correct, because he\nhas not exhausted his claim. When the claim is that you\nwere denied your right to a direct appeal, the only\nplace that you can raise that claim is State\npost-conviction review. Federal habeas corpus requires\nyou to exhaust your available State remedies. Your\navailable State remedy for that is State post-conviction\nreview. He may not appear in Federal district court.\nThe district court I think would abuse its discretion in\nstaying a plainly unexhausted claim. That wouldn't be\ngood cause, as this Court has said, for it.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If you do prevail, it is\nrather dramatic, because your client was stunningly\nnegligent. He does nothing for four and-a-half years,\nthen strolls over to the State court.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, Justice Kennedy, the\nState, as I said, did not raise this argument in the\nplace where we think it's appropriate, and that no\nrecord was built on laches. It does -- it does have\nthat feel.\nI do think that the Court's opinion could\nmake clear that this anomaly arises from the fact that,\ndespite the fact that the Texas courts have made clear\nthat there are laches principles and limitations --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask if laches is\nsomething that the Texas court could bring up on its\nown, or is it for the State to raise or not as it\nchooses?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: It is for the State to\nraise, and we cite our Texas authority for that in our\nreply brief, Justice Ginsburg.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is the State statute that\nallows the early conviction to be set aside and the\nappeal reinstated -- do we have that statute?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Kennedy, that is\nsection 11 -- article 11.07.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I thought I had it. Do we\nhave it in --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I do not believe you do.\nAnd the reason is that article 11.07 is just the general\nTexas post-conviction regime. The procedure that is\nused for reinstating direct appeals is developed through\ncaselaw, not by statute.\nJustice Scalia, there was a final point that\nI was about to make when I said, look, defendants in\nnon-capital cases have every incentive, if they want to\nget relief, to move their cases along. The Court may be\nconcerned about capital cases where there is the\nopposite concern, that defendants will try and keep\ntheir cases alive, if you will. And Texas recognizes\nthis point and has a deadline by statute that is quite\nshort for instituting post-conviction relief in capital\ncases.\nThey simply recognize that laches is the way\nto handle the prospect of delay in non-capital cases.\nWe don't think there is any reason for this Court to\noverride that determination, to second guess the\njudgment of the Texas court that the judgment is not\nfinal until the reinstated appeal concludes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What happens -- just out of\ncuriosity, a prisoner's lawyer doesn't take the appeal,\nthe time expires, bong, the year begins to run. Within\nthat year he files federal habeas. Then he discovers\nthat he had a right to a state appeal. So he goes, just\nlike this man, goes back and, sure enough, he gets his\ndirect appeal, and three years later or a year later\nthey finish the direct appeal. Bong, he can file again.\nIs that his first habeas or his second\nhabeas?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I have to ask one question,\nsir, because the answer is it depends.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: The question is, when he\nfiles for Federal habeas corpus the first time in your\nhypothetical, I take it he doesn't raise the claim --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: He raises a substantive\nclaim, like the judge was biased against him and the\nlike?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: That is regarded as a first\nhabeas application, because the claim did not -- I think\nthe judgment did not arise until later. I don't believe\na case like that has arisen. I think --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I doubt that one -- I mean,\none may never arise but --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: The strange thing is that it\nis an exhausted set of claims. So it is a proper\nFederal habeas corpus application, because he went to --\nJUSTICE BREYER: The first one is proper and\non your view so is the second one proper. So they are\nboth proper, and there are two of them. And --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: It's proper in terms of it\nbeing exhausted. It would be dismissed, to be clear.\nSo his appeal was denied, right? He doesn't file an\nappeal in the hypothetical. So when he shows up in\nFederal district court, it's an exhausted -- it is -- he\nwould be dismissed for failure to exhaust, in fact,\nbecause he didn't pursue his --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, nobody knows about\nthis.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: But he -- but he was --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, but nobody knows that\nthe State made a mistake in not giving him a direct\nreview.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Your hypothetical, Justice\nBreyer, I took it to be --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, forget my hypothetical.\nThey're never going to come up.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I think, though, I can tell\nyou this with some confidence. The way that this thing\nhappened in Texas is the way that it happens in the\nStates, and the way it happens in Federal courts as well\nunder 2255. You file a post-conviction application.\nYou say: I was denied entirely my right of appeal by\nsomething the court did or something my lawyer did, and\nthen you get to pursue your appeal.\nAnd that's what Congress wanted the Federal\ndistrict court on habeas corpus to review. So\nlogically, the one year begins to run after that's done.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, except that\nyou kind of elide the point that Congress and AEDPA\nquite clearly wanted these federal claims to be brought\nwithin a year. This seems to allow the State processes\nto trump the one-year requirement.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, in many cases,\nMr. Chief Justice, of course, the State appeals can take\n20 years to go up and down and back and forth from State\npost-conviction review. We also have the rather\ncommonplace case in which a defendant doesn't file a\nnotice of appeal at all, as in Justice Breyer's\nhypothetical, but the court of appeal says, you know,\nfor good cause we are going to let you file this appeal\nlate.\nAnd it's quite clear in that scenario, so\nyour appeal is reinstated there, too, because you were\n20 days late, 30 days late on the filing deadline. It's\nquite clear and I think agreed in all of those\nsituations that, while Congress did want you to move\nexpeditiously, the question is move expeditiously from\nwhen. And it's from the State court's direct review,\nfinishing the conclusion of direct review.\nAnd we know that Congress recognized that\nthat wouldn't always be one year from the end of the\ncase the first time around from the structure of (B),\n(C), and (D); and the fact that if there were a\ntie-breaker at all, it is that the statute shall -- the\nlimitation period shall run from the latest of several\ndays. So Congress quite clearly contemplated that there\nwould be multiple possible start dates.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You said that it's\nunusual for the Texas State to grant these. But\npresumably you could challenge the determination five,\nten, 15 years later by the Texas court not to grant you\na direct appeal.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I'm not sure I understand\nthe -- the hypothetical, Mr. Chief Justice. If -- if\nyou lose your post-conviction application for it?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah. Let's say\nthis fellow -- the State court says, well, you know\nwhat, we are not going to give you another direct\nappeal. And he says, well, that decision was made in\nviolation of my federal constitutional rights. What\nhappens then with respect to federal habeas?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, he is challenging his\noriginal -- Federal habeas corpus is reviewing the\njudgment in his case. He has, since there was only one\nconclusion of direct review in his case, one year\nmeasured from the first dismissal, tolled only during\nthe period of pending post-conviction application.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But is he\nchallenging the first conviction, or is he challenging\nthe failure of the State court to give him another\ndirect appeal?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: He is challenging the fact\nthat he was denied a direct appeal, which is a challenge\nto his actual conviction. That is a constitutional flaw\nin his conviction. And so it runs from the conclusion\nof the direct review, not from anything related to\npost-conviction review.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's I\ngather if he is granted the collateral -- the direct --\nsecond direct appeal. What if the Court says no, we\ndon't agree that you were denied your right to a direct\nappeal; we think you had it so you don't get another\none. And he says that determination has been made in\nviolation of the Federal Constitution.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: The fact that the State\npost-conviction court did not remedy a violation of his\nconstitutional rights on direct review does not create a\nnew constitutional violation. The constitutional\nviolation in your hypothetical arises on direct review.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, doesn't it\ndepend upon the allegation he wishes to make? Say he\ncomes in in one of these proceedings four and a half\nyears later and says, you should give me another direct\nreview, I didn't have it. And the court says, well, no,\nwe're not going to give you one. And he says, well, you\ngive it to all the white criminal defendants and you are\nnot giving it to me, so that violates equal protection?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I don't think so. And if I\ncould just explain -- give an analogy. Say he could\nmake the same allegation about ineffective assistance of\ntrial counsel. You can always try and recharacterize\nyour claim as the post-conviction court violated my\nconstitutional rights by not vindicating my original\nconstitutional rights, my right to constitutionally\neffective counsel at trial or on appeal. And the\nFederal habeas courts uniformly reject those efforts to\nrecharacterize. The constitutional violation arises in\nthe original criminal case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess my\nhypothetical supposes a new constitutional violation.\nAnd I am just suggesting that the fact that Texas\ndoesn't grant this relief freely doesn't mean that\nthat's a sufficient answer with respect to the abuse of\nfederal habeas.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I understand,\nMr. Chief Justice. I think that body of cases is\nrelatively narrow as it arises, and it also isn't\nimplicated here.\nIf the Court has no further questions, I\nwill reserve the remainder of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Jordan.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SEAN D. JORDAN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. JORDAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nCongress's commitment to preventing\nunnecessary delays in the filing of Federal habeas\nclaims is reflected in section 2244(d)(1)'s strict\none-year limitations period. And it did not intend that\ninmates who wait for years before seeking\npost-conviction review would obtain a new Federal\nlimitation start date when an out-of-time appeal is\nawarded.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, why should that be,\ngiven the fact that the day it is going to run from is\nthe day that -- which the State of Texas is willing to\ntake action. And if Texas is willing to let the matter\nride as long as it rode here, why shouldn't the one-year\nstatute apply?\nIn other words, I guess what I'm saying is\nthe -- the decision about what is appropriate, that,\nin effect, would start this period running, is Texas's\nAnd as long as Texas is -- is satisfied with it, why\ndoes AEDPA have an independent concern?\nMR. JORDAN: Your Honor, the reason is that\nin (d)(1)(A) Congress set a uniform Federal rule for\nfinality. And that finality date is either when the --\nthe period of direct review ends by the conclusion of\ndirect review or the expiration of the time for seeking\ndirect review.\nSo when that happens, by statute, Congress\nhas said that the (d)(1)(A) finality date is attached.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but that -- in effect,\nI think that begs the question, because if -- if Texas\nsays: Okay, we are going to -- we are going to\nrecognize a direct appeal starting -- or a direct-appeal\nright exercisable now, then (d)(1)(A) applies by its own\nterms exactly at the -- at the conclusion of the process\nwhich Texas has at this date chosen to allow.\nTexas doesn't have any gripe. It decided it\nought to act, and -- and, undoubtedly, it should have.\nAs long as the -- as long as the State is\nprotected, why is there an independent interest in\nenforcing AEDPA, or enforcing the shortest possible rule\nunder AEDPA?\nMR. JORDAN: Justice Souter, there is an\nindependent Federal interest that the Court has\nrecognized consistently in avoiding abusive and\nunnecessary delay in the filing of Federal habeas\nclaims.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah, but we are -- we are\nconcerned about State interests, aren't we?\nMR. JORDAN: Certainly, Justice Souter, and\ncomity and finality are important purposes of AEDPA.\nBut another recognized and important purpose of AEDPA is\nto avoid, you know, abusive and unnecessary delays in\nthe filing of Federal habeas claims. So even if a State\ncourt would allow stale claims years later to be heard,\nthat doesn't mean that Federal courts need to hear those\nclaims 10, 15 or 20 years later.\nBut there is a second point, Justice Souter,\nthat -- that is a problem with interpreting (d)(1)(A) in\nthe manner the Petitioner suggests, which is that it\nwill make it far more difficult for Federal courts to\nadminister that statute. Because if the Court\ninterprets \"direct review\" to bring in Texas and all the\n50 States various remedies for ineffective assistance of\ncounsel on appeal, then what that means is you are no\nlonger going to have a uniform Federal rule for finality\nin any of these cases.\nWhat you are going to have is a patchwork of\n-- of various dates, and the -- the reality is --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you have got a -- in\na sense, you have got a patchwork now. I mean not --\nnot every State rule for the commencement of a direct\nappeal in the normal course is -- is identical. So we\n-- we start with a patchwork.\nMR. JORDAN: But the difference is stark,\nJustice Souter, because the -- the dates that the States\nuse for deadlines on initial direct appeal, the vast\nmajority, are within a short timeframe, 20 days to\n90 days, the vast majority. Whereas, these remedies for\nout-of-time appeals are genuinely varied, and they vary\nover time in the States.\nAnd if I could give you a couple of examples\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But aren't they -- and I\nwill -- you know, I will take the examples, but I mean,\naren't they varied because the -- the circumstances of\nerror which led to these late appeals vary, too? And\nisn't that exactly the way it ought to be?\nMR. JORDAN: Well, it is correct, Justice\nSouter, that some States -- the remedy varies with the\ntype of ineffective assistance of counsel, for example,\nthe difference between not filing a notice of appeal or\nnot filing a brief.\nBut my point is that those remedies -- the\nPetitioner's brief -- opening brief at pages 29 to 32\nsays: This is going to be easy for Federal courts to\napply, because what they can do is look at these six\ndifferent aspects of the nature of the remedy in each\nState, and they can determine from that whether --\nwhen -- whether it should be a new start date or just\ntolling. The --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can't we leave\nthat -- and you suggest that it is a Federal rule. I am\nnot sure that's right. Why don't we just leave that up\nto the States? I am not -- if I don't accept your\nfriend's determination that this is a matter of\nsubstance rather than form, States have it -- excuse\nme -- within their control. Here -- your State calls it\nanother direct appeal.\nWhy don't we just take them at their word?\nAnd if they don't want to get into the business of\nhaving a Federal review of a second direct appeal that\nthey choose to allow, they just call it something else.\nCall it a -- you know, the collateral review of a\nsuccessful claim of ineffective assistance of counsel\nand file whatever. And then, you know, under AEDPA that\nwouldn't count as a new final judgment.\nMR. JORDAN: Well, it's -- it's true, Your\nHonor, that the -- that States can fashion whatever\nremedy they want. And in terms of the comity and\nfinality interests, it is going to be a responsibility\nof the States if they want to change their law. But\nbecause in -- in these out-of-time appeals -- and most\nof the States' remedies look somewhat like in --\nsomewhat like Texas in the sense that they are coming\nthrough post-conviction review and they -- they are\nawarding another, if you will, chance for the inmate to\nassert his claims. There is not a reason for the court\nto strain the interpretation of (d)(1)(A) to protect the\nState's interest --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why -- why is it a strain?\nI mean suppose that Texas decided to give every criminal\ndefendant convicted one thousand years to appeal. You\nknow, if they did, I guess they would have one more year\nafter that to go to Federal habeas, right?\nMR. JORDAN: That's true, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Then what's the\ndifference between that, giving them a thousand years,\nwhich I doubt they will do, and what they have said\nhere? They said for purposes of the Texas rules all\ntime limits shall be calculated as if the sentence had\nbeen imposed on the date that the mandate of this court\nissues.\nThere they are. The Texas Supreme Court\ngave him all that time, it's whatever it was, and said\nthat's the time you have. How, how is that different\nfrom the legislature decides to give him one\nthousand years?\nMR. JORDAN: It's true, Your Honor, that the\n-- that the -- the Texas court made a decision to give a\nremedy to this inmate that was meant to duplicate the\ntype of claims he could have raised on direct appeal.\nOur position is that does not change the finality date\nunder (d)(1)(A), because by statute, Congress has said\nthat that date attaches at the -- at the expiration of\ndirect review. And -- and the natural reading of that\nlanguage --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I -- I was\njust going to stop you there. It doesn't say that\nstarts to run at the expiration of direct review. It\nsays on the date the judgment became final.\nMR. JORDAN: That's correct, Your Honor, and\nit says, it became final by --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- by the conclusion\nof direct review.\nMR. JORDAN: Or the expiration of the time\nfor seeking such review. And the importance there, Your\nHonor, is that it -- it anticipates one of two events\noccurring. In other words, the natural reading is\nCongress understood that in some cases there wasn't\ngoing to be a conclusion of direct review. There was\ngoing to be an expiration of time for seeking review.\nAnd at that point finality would attach.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Even though, as in this\ncase, it turned out he found out within a year. But\nsuppose he didn't find out for more than a year; that\nis, he didn't find out that -- that the appeal had been\nfiled, and he didn't find out about the dismissal? So\nbecause either his counsel or the State blundered, he is\nout in the cold, and he can never present his direct-\nappeal claim.\nMR. JORDAN: Not necessarily, Justice\nGinsburg, and that's the reason why Congress already\nprovided exceptions in the statute in the form of\nsubsections (b) through (d) that provide later start\ndates for extenuating circumstances beyond the inmate's\ncontrol.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Goldstein just\nexplained to us why those two provisions, the (b) and\n(d) would not work. That this --\nMR. JORDAN: I understand, Your Honor. And,\nrespectfully, I disagree -- I disagree with that, and\nhere is the reason why (d)(1)(B) applies. And (d)(1)(B)\napplies because in -- for example, in this case you had\nthe -- a finding that there was constitutionally\nineffective assistance of counsel to the extent of\nabandoning the inmate on appeal.\nAnd this Court's precedent has said that\nwhen there is -- in the trial or on direct appeal, when\nthere is ineffectiveness of counsel that amounts to\nabandonment, that winds up being imputed to the State\nbecause it means that the State got or -- or kept a\nconviction by the violation of the inmate's due-process\nrights.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you have a case\nto cite for that? Because I understood your friend to\nsay the opposite: That wouldn't count as an impediment.\nMR. JORDAN: I do --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How do I resolve\nthat dispute?\nMR. JORDAN: I do, Your Honor. You -- you\nneed -- need to look no longer than the case that is\ncited in both briefs. It is Evitts versus Lucey, and it\nis cited in the Petitioner's brief at pages 27 and 37,\nand it is cited in our brief at pages 36 and 37.\nIt is also in another case not cited in the\nbrief, but it is also noted in Coleman versus Thompson.\nIn other words, the Court has consistently said that\nwhere there is constructive denial of counsel that\namounts to no assistance at all and the State thereby\nobtains and retains a conviction, there -- that will be\nimputed to the State. Now, the difficult part in\ngetting (d)(1)(B), a later date under (d)(1)(B), is that\nyou also need the causal connection, because you can't\njust have the ineffective assistance of counsel. It\nalso has to have caused the inmate not to be able to\nfile his -- his timely Federal habeas. That happened in\nthis case because the ineffective assistance of counsel\nresulted in the inmate having a lack of notice. The\nattorney did not serve the Anders brief on the inmate\nand he gave the wrong address to the court. So the\ncourt wound up sending the judgment to the wrong address\nand the inmate didn't know.\nThat's why we say in those circumstances\n(d)(1)(B) is implicated. But it's worth noting that\neven if we measure the date from September of 1997 or we\ngive him a new date under (d)(1)(B), then that's the\ndate that he admits, he acknowledges, he knew his State\nappeal had failed. From that date, he waited four and a\nhalf years to seek any type of post-conviction review.\nAnd then -- and the importance of that is that Congress\nintended to give a year, a strict one-year period. This\ninmate could have invoked (d)(1)(B) and he did not and\nhe waited four and a half years from the date he could\nhave had.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And Texas could -- and\nTexas could have gone into the State court and said:\nDon't give him the direct review; he waited four and a\nhalf years after he -- but the State didn't ask for\nthat.\nMR. JORDAN: That's correct, Your Honor.\nThe State did not assert a laches defense, but I have --\nthere is two points on that: One is that the only case\n-- there is one case and it's cited in the brief, Ex\nparte Carrio. It's cited in the Petitioner's brief.\nThere's one case in the last 150 years of Texas\njurisprudence where laches has actual been asserted and\nan appeal has been -- I'm sorry -- habeas has been\ndenied based on that.\nAnd we are not talking about -- we are not\nasserting laches here. We are talking about the running\nof his Federal limitations period under a Federal\nstatute. And what we are saying is this inmate was\nclearly not diligent, and this inmate could have had a\nlater start date, but even from that later start date\nhe would -- he would -- the Federal period would have\nexpired.\nI would like to address quickly the (d)(2)\npoint because I think it's important. The reference was\nmade that (d)(2) doesn't work, In other words (d)(2)\ntolling won't work in this case because of the Court's\ndecision in Lawrence. And that's -- that's not true,\nbecause the situation in Lawrence was different.\nIn Lawrence, the Court's decision said that\ninmate had exhausted all of his post-conviction review\nin the Florida courts. He had gone all the way to the\ntop court. There was no State court left for him to go\nto. And the question was, when he then came to this\nCourt with a cert petition, could that cert petition\ncount as tolling time of review for the State\npost-conviction review? The Court said no.\nThat's not the case here. This is more like\nthe Court's decision in Carey versus Saffold, where in,\nCarey, the Court said -- the Court acknowledged that\nunder California law where inmates can, if they lose\ntheir habeas in a lower court, they can then file an\noriginal writ in a higher court. The Court said that,\nwhile the inmate is going through that process, the\ncollateral review of the underlying judgment remained\npending, it remained in continuance.\nAnd that's what's happening here. If you\nlook at what happened in the Texas court, when the\ninmate files his habeas petition, the habeas petition\nitself is not reviewing the pertinent judgment. That's\nthe language of (d)(2), \"reviewing the pertinent\njudgment.\" That habeas petition asks for a second\nproceeding to review the pertinent judgment. It says,\ncan you give me another proceeding, the out-of-time\nappeal, to review the pertinent judgment? And so, when\nthe inmate receives that, when he -- if he gets the\nout-of-time appeal, then the next step, the out-of-time\nappeal, is where the judgment is reviewed.\nSo, the Court's rationale in Carey is\napplicable with even greater force here because the\nState courts have told him: File another -- you know,\ncontinue your proceeding so you can get review of the\nunderlying judgment. And it anticipates a two-step\nprocess. So you might say that the out-of-time appeal\nis the remedy portion of the habeas proceeding in Texas.\nAnd that's why the (d)(2) tolling does work and Lawrence\ndoes not defeat that. And in this case, that means that\nthe inmate, if he had acted timely, he could have filed\nhis State post-conviction petition. If he had obtained\nan out-of-time appeal, he could -- the tolling would\nhave gone on while -- throughout the out-of-time appeal.\nAnd then if he had lost that, he could have then gone to\nFederal court. And so --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you're saying that\n(2) has a negative implication.\nMR. JORDAN: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You are saying that (2)\nhad a negative implication. In other words, the time\nshall not be counted while it's pending and that it\nshould be counted if it's not pending and you are not\ndiligent.\nMR. JORDAN: That's -- well, that's correct,\nYour Honor, in the sense that if the State -- some\ncollateral review in State court has to be pending for\ntolling to be going on. And what we are saying is that\nfor the out-of-time appeal process in Texas, it does\nremain pending. The reason it remains pending is that\nthat first habeas petition is asking for, and if the\ninmate gets it is receiving, further collateral review\nof that judgment because --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When you say \"the\nfirst habeas petition\" you mean the first State habeas\npetition?\nMR. JORDAN: That's correct, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. I'm sorry.\nMR. JORDAN: And that first State habeas\npetition -- if you look -- if you look in the record,\nyou will see the State habeas petition doesn't challenge\nanything about the underlying judgment. It doesn't say,\ngive me relief on any particular claim. What it says\nis, give me an out-of-time appeal proceeding so that I\ncan challenge the underlying judgment. And so, when the\ninmate obtains that out-of-time appeal to -- to get\nreview of the underlying judgment, (d)(2) tolling still\napplies. And that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. What do\nyou mean, \"(d)(2) tolling still applies\"? That the\ndirect appeal time does not count against his one year?\nMR. JORDAN: That's correct. The\nout-of-time appeal time, Your Honor, won't count. So\nwhat we'll go on is that if his habeas was granted and\nhe was allowed the out-of-time appeal, he could pursue\nthe out-of-time appeal. The tolling of the Federal\nlimitations period under (d)(2) would remain during that\nentire time, if he then loses his out-of-time appeal and\nhe comes out of the other side of the process.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's assuming that he\nfiles the appeal within one year, right?\nMR. JORDAN: That's -- I mean, if he does,\nthat's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What if he doesn't?\nMR. JORDAN: If he doesn't file his State\nhabeas within one year?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. JORDAN: Your Honor, if he doesn't file\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The game is over.\nMR. JORDAN: Well, it would be, Your Honor,\nunless he fell into one of the exceptions provided by\nCongress in (B), (C), or (D).\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What if he doesn't find out\nabout the fact that notice, proper notice, wasn't given\nto his counsel, so he doesn't find out about the\ngravamen for the appeal until after a year?\nMR. JORDAN: Your Honor, two points in\nresponse. The first is that -- is that I'm assuming, in\nyour hypothetical, that it is an inmate who has\nattempted to be diligent, has attempted to contact the\ncourt.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right. Right.\nMR. JORDAN: And if he has attempted to\ncontact the court and he still had not found out, the\ncircumstances -- I mean, we've looked at a lot of these\ncases and there is just very few out there where an\ninmate who is being diligent is not going to be able to\nfind out one way or the other. So, it may be that if he\nwasn't able to, he might fall under (d)(1)(B). But if\nhe didn't, Your Honor, and it was an unusual -- and it\nwould have to be a very unusual circumstance -- it might\nbe that equitable tolling could apply. But this Court\nhas recognized, in Dodd v. United States, in\ninterpreting the similar provisions in the counterpart\nto 2244(d)(1)(C), in the context of when the Court\nrecognizes a retroactively applicable --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think (d)(1)(B)\ndoes. It requires an impediment to have been removed.\nThere is no impediment being removed. He just didn't\nfind out the facts.\nMR. JORDAN: Well, presumably, Your Honor,\nthe reason that he didn't would have -- if he was being\ndiligent, if he was -- because he needs to be diligent.\nHe can't just sit in his cell --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right. Right.\nMR. JORDAN: -- and say, \"I'm not going to\ndo anything.\" If he is being diligent and if he is\nreally attempting to find out what happened to his case,\nthen probably something has happened, either, you know,\nthrough the State system or through the attorney. But\nif it has not -- you know, again, we've looked at a lot\nof these cases. We haven't seen cases like that, but --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I just made one up. I\nmean, it's a hypothetical.\nMR. JORDAN: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But it works. Your system,\nI think, works in that instance, as I understand it.\nDon't tell me I'm right if I'm wrong, please. But the\n-- as you understand it, he finishes -- he doesn't get\nhis appeal, you know, and time passes; doesn't take it.\nThen, five years later, he learns for the first time and\nthe first time he could have learned that his lawyer\ntore up the notification. At that point, (1)(B) comes\ninto play. So the year begins to run.\nThen, in your idea, he has -- he has a year\nto go to Federal court. But wait, it's tolled while he\ngoes to State court. So he goes to State court having\njust learned it. And now he's under (2) and he files a\nhabeas in State. Now the remedy of the State habeas is\nto reopen the direct appeal. But we should count that,\nsince it's a remedy of a habeas, as if it were a\ncontinuation of the habeas and therefore it would fall\nwithin (2). That's your argument.\nMR. JORDAN: Exactly.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And it's -- correct? I do\nnot think there is any case ever considered that to my\nknowledge.\nMR. JORDAN: No --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- and the only difficulty\nof it is that you have to take a sort of leap of faith\nof some kind in attaching what everybody's calling the\ndirect appeal as if it were actually part of the State\nhabeas proceeding. That's I think the hardest part of\nyour argument.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There is more of a problem\nthan that, as the other side just said. (1)(B), which\nis the gimmick you are using to get out of this, doesn't\nspeak of not being able to find out in time; it speaks\nof the date on which the impediment to file an\napplication --\nJUSTICE BREYER: (D).\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- is removed.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's not (B), it's (D).\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, you said (D), not (B).\nJUSTICE BREYER: (D).\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I thought,\nCounsel, that your response to that was when you have a\nfailure of counsel, that that is imputed to the State.\nSo it is a removal of an impediment created by the\nState.\nMR. JORDAN: That's -- that's correct,\nMr. Chief Justice. That's -- under the Court's decision\nis cases like Evitts v Lucey, if there has been a\nconstructive denial of counsel, an abandonment of\ncounsel to the degree where there was effectively no\nappeal, then that could be imputed to the State. The\nreasoning has been that it's because the State was able\nto get or keep a conviction without the inmate having\ndue process. That would be -- the inmate would still\nhave to have the fact that that impediment actually\ncaused him to -- and this case is a good example.\nEven though this inmate -- you know, there\nwas ineffectiveness of counsel -- if the court had the\nright address, and court had sent him the judgment, then\nthere would not have been the causal connection; he\nwouldn't have been able to get the (d)(1)(D) date.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The problem with (1)(D) is\nthat the claim or claims presented that is referred to\nin (D) is not the denial of the appeal. It's the claim\nor claims that he wants to bring in his Federal habeas.\nThat's why (1)(D) doesn't work, you have to go back to\n(1)(B).\nI'm talking to you.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: But I think it's a good\npoint.\nMR. JORDAN: Well, you are exactly right,\nJustice Scalia, that (d)(1)(D), in this case, because it\nis claim-specific it only does apply to the ineffective\nassistance of counsel on appeal. We noted in our brief\nthat it was implicated, but because he got relief on\nthat claim in the State court, there was no reason for\nhim to -- so he wouldn't have -- the (D) was implicated\nbut didn't need to be asserted.\nWe are that saying (d)(1)(B) --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: (B).\nMR. JORDAN: -- is -- is -- in play in the\ncase because of the unique circumstances of this -- of\nthis --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Between your response to\nthe Chief Justice and Justice Scalia, I stand\nenlightened.\nMR. JORDAN: It's the interplay of these two\n-- of these two provisions, because both of them in any\nparticular case could be in play. If the -- - if, for\nexample, this inmate had not gotten relief in the State\ncourt for his ineffectiveness of counsel on appeal, then\nthe (d)(1)(D) could have provided a later start date for\nthat claim. It's (d)(1)(B) that applies to the other\nclaims. And the -- you know, the bottom line notion for\nour position is that it cannot be that Congress intended\nin this -- this statute to be interpreted such that a\nnon-diligent inmate who waits four and a half years\nafter he knows his appeal has failed to seek any sort of\npost-conviction relief will obtain a new start date.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that's your fault.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Justice could have -- not\nonly, that don't some States have a limitation period\nwhen -- when he finds out that his appeal has been\ndismissed, without notice to him, aren't there some\nStates, criminal justice systems, that say from the date\nthat you had knowledge, you have X days to file?\nMR. JORDAN: Yes, Your Honor. There are a\nnumber of States that have -- if we are talking about\nremedies for ineffective assistance of counsel on\nappeal, there are a number of States that have\ndeadlines; but there are at least 19 States that provide\nremedies for ineffectiveness of counsel on appeal with\nno statute of limitations.\nAnd in -- and in those States and in many\ncases what that means is that the inmate, like this\ninmate, could come five years later, ten years later,\nand make those claims.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, do I understand\ncorrectly that, based on your answers and your friend's\nanswers, there is no difference between the way you two\nin substance read these provisions? He relies on\n(d)(1)(A); you rely on the combination of (d)(2) and\n(d)(1)(B) and (d); except in the situation where you\nhave a non-diligent prisoner, and in that case, his\ntheory leads to a different result than yours.\nHe excuses the non-diligence because the\nState chooses to label the second opportunity as final.\nYou do not excuse the non-diligence because in the\nabsence of diligence, (d)(1)(B) and (d)(1)(D) do not\napply.\nMR. JORDAN: That's correct, Mr. Chief\nJustice. And I'd like to address a point that's made in\nthe reply brief, about --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Then it comes down\n-- it does come down to his, where he began his\nargument, which is he said that this is an unusual case\nwhere Texas is being overly generous to convicts,\nbecause you choose to label it as direct appeal and\ntherefore that means someone that the States allow to\nhave another direct appeal, even though they have been\nnon-diligent, get the benefit of the -- of a new\nfinality date.\nMR. JORDAN: That's correct, Your Honor, and\nour position is that Texas -- not Texas or any State can\nrewrite the -- this Federal statute and a finality date\nin this Federal statute. But I want to address quickly\nthe point that's made in a reply brief that the Court\nnot worry about this because there is no incentive for\nnon-capital inmates to -- to sit on their rights. And I\nhave two points I want to make on that.\nThe first is Congress has already made that\ndecision. Obviously Congress was concerned that even\nnon-capital inmates could sit on their rights because\nthey imposed this strict one-year limitation on\nnon-capital inmates. But the second point is that as a\npractical matter this happens in many, many cases.\nThese cases provide the example. In this case the\ninmate waited five years. The Frasch v Peguese case\nthat is coming out of the Fourth Circuit on an\nout-of-time appeal, the inmate -- a non-capital inmate\nwaited ten years to seek post-conviction review. And so\nthese are cases that we think are representative of many\ncase that would come through the district courts, and\nthat in fact non-capital inmates, whatever their\nincentives may be, do as a practical matter sometimes\nsit on their rights.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Convicted felons don't\nalways make intelligent decisions, you are saying.\nMR. JORDAN: That's correct. And the\nproblem is that when -- when for whatever reason they\nsit on their rights ten or 15 years, our point is that\nthat doesn't mean they can come back in and have Federal\ncourts hearing stale claims that should have been\nbrought, if the inmate was being diligent, years\nearlier.\nAnd there's -- and this case is a case in\npoint. This inmate has -- has provided no reason why --\nno legitimate reason why he waited four and a half\nyears. The only reason he provided was I am a pro se\ninmate and I -- I don't know what the law S. And you\ncan his data in the joint appendix pages 109 to 112, and\nthose are directly rejected by the court in the Johnson\ncase, Johnson v United States. The court said in that\ncase --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Am I correct that on the\nunderlying merits of the basic claims, that each -- his\nlawyer filed an Anders brief?\nMR. JORDAN: That's correct, Justice --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: He's probably not a very\n-- he's not -- has the greatest in the world of\nsucceeding, I wouldn't suppose.\nIsn't this characteristic of this category\nof cases, that really most of them heard are pretty\nfrivolous?\nMR. JORDAN: Your Honor, a lot of them are.\nA lot of them are, and in fact there were two Anders\nbriefs filed in this case. To show how -- how weak his\nclaims were, when he got the out-of-time appeal, he was\nappointed a new attorney and she filed an Anders brief.\nSo you had two attorneys in this case who said --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What strikes me about the\ncase is we are fighting about the limitations and\nwhether it applies and so forth; you probably could have\ndisposed of the whole litigation a lot faster by just\nlooking at the merits for about ten minutes.\nMR. JORDAN: I think that is exactly right,\nJustice Stevens. But the procedural questions remain --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: This is all -- this is a\nproduct of Congress trying to save us all time.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. JORDAN: Indeed. This case, the\nunderlying merits are, there basically are no merits to\nhis underlying claims is a point we have fully briefed\nand I won't address here unless there are questions from\nthe Court. And unless there are further questions,\nI'm --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you Mr.\nJordan.\nMr. Goldstein, you have four minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Thank you, sir. A few short\npoints.\nJustice Stevens, if later on you have an\nopportunity to look at footnote 15 on page 42 of the\nblue brief, we cite eight cases, and there are more, in\nwhich these out-of-time appeals really did find\nmeritorious claims. And I -- so I don't want the Court\nto be left with the impression that this is much ado\nabout nothing. The rule of law will actually be quite\nsignificant.\nTwo small corrections to things my friend\ninadvertently said or impressions he may have\ninadvertently left. He says there are 19 States that\nhave no statute of limitations, but that omits the very\nmany of those States that apply laches, and the fact\nthat the State of Texas here did not assert the\nuntimeliness of the State post-conviction proceeding is\npretty much I think why we are ultimately here.\nHe also said that there is only one State\nopinion finding laches, as if, I think, to create the\nimpression that Texas courts don't take laches\nseriously. Most of these are disposed of without\nopinions. But the more relevant important is that there\naren't Texas State opinions rejecting claims of laches.\nWhat the Texas courts have made is that the Texas A.G.'s\noffice has to assert the defense of laches, as is true\neverywhere and is true in this Court's jurisprudence as\nwell.\nThe final two points I wanted to make are\nabout (d)(1)(B) and (d)(2), all of which, I think\nhonestly reduced to Justice Kennedy's point, is that the\nrelevant provision is (d)(1), whatever else is going on\nin the case. But Justice Scalia and the Chief Justice\ncame back to the point about whether this is an\nimpediment, and my friend kept answering it is State\naction, and the Court would say, but is it an\nimpediment?\nAnd at page 20 of our reply brief we must\ncite eight or ten cases, three of which notably are from\nTexas; there were litigated by the Texas Attorney\nGeneral's office, that make it clear that the failure to\ngive the notice of the opinion is not an impediment to\nfiling post-conviction review, and the Court would be\nrewriting a lot of habeas corpus law to rule for the\nState of Texas here.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about -- he\ncited most prominently the Evitts case.\nMR. JORDAN: That's a State action, but as\nthe Court's questioning indication, the question is, is\nState action that is an impediment to filing a Federal\nhabeas petition, and all of our cases answered that\nquestion.\nThe final point is about (d)(2) and my\nfriend says that this isn't like Lawrence v Florida,\nbecause here there is more proceedings. But the Court's\nholding was this, and it was unambiguous: When the\npost-conviction court enters its mandate, so that the\ntime to seek cert starts to run, that's when the\npost-conviction application is no longer pending; and\nwhen the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals decided the\nPetitioner's claim and said he had an out-of-time\nappeal, it issued its mandate and the mandate is in the\njoint appendix. And somebody -- the State could have\nsought cert in that case, and the post-conviction\napplication was no longer pending.\nAnd Mr. Chief Justice, you're right, you can\nthe case on the basis of label or substance, but it is\nunambiguous that this is not post-conviction review in\nwhat we have been calling the second appeal. Teague\nretroactivity does not apply; all the constitutional\nrights that are announced in the meantime apply; you\nhave a right to a counsel; the usual standards of\npost-conviction relief in terms of having us show an\nextra layer of prejudice don't apply.\nThis is just like any other appeal the Texas\nCourt of Appeals and the courts of criminal appeal would\ndecide and that makes it a (d)(1) case.\nThank you very much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
