GANSLER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. GANSLER: Mr. Chief Justice and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis case is here from the Maryland Court of\nAppeals. In that case, the court of appeals suppressed\na statement that was given by Respondent following what\nthe trial court found to be a valid waiver of his\nMiranda rights and following a free and voluntary\nconfession.\nThe reason why the court did so is because,\ntwo years and seven months prior to that, the defendant\nwas in a different custodial interrogation and at that\ntime invoked his right to counsel. We ask that this\nCourt reverse the Maryland Court of Appeals.\nIt is our position that a break in custody\nfrom custodial interrogation should be the bright line\nthat this Court adopts in order to end the irrebuttable\npresumption that this Court created in the Edwards case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Without regard to\nthe time? A break in custody of one day, do you think\nthat should be enough?\nMR. GANSLER: Your Honor, we do think one\nday should be enough, as long as it is not in the\npretrial detention category. Obviously, the three cases\nthat have come before this Court, Edwards, Minnick and,\nRoberson, all -- two of them were three days, and one of\nthem was one day, but those defendants were in the\npretrial detention status.\nSo if in fact a defendant is brought in,\nquestioned, and then released back to his or her daily\nroutine, and away from the isolation of the custodial\ninterrogation, we feel that that should be the bright\nline for a break in custody.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So what if it's\nrepeatedly done? You know, you -- you bring him in, you\ngive him his Miranda rights. He says, I don't want to\ntalk. You let him go. You bring him in, give him his\nMiranda rights. He says, I don't want to talk. You\nknow, just sort of catch and release, until he finally\nbreaks down and says, All right, I'll talk.\nMR. GANSLER: There is parade of horribles\nof catch and release and Your Honor just went through\none of them, and there are obviously a number of\nhypotheticals that one could posit. We would suggest\nthat the break of custody would be the end of the\nEdwards irrebuttable presumption. However, there are\nstill three responses to that. The first would be the\ndefendant could still say that his or her Miranda rights\nwere not given voluntarily and willfully. Secondly, the\ndue process jurisprudence that this Court had prior to\nMiranda still is in existence, and therefore the\ndefendant could argue that that confession was given in\nan overborne way, that his will was overborne.\nBut finally and I think most relevant,\nbecause this is sort of the other side of this case, is\nthat there has been -- since 1982 eight Federal circuits\nand over 20 States have had the break of custody rule in\neffect. And in fact this Court in the McNeil case,\nalbeit in dicta and parenthetically, assumed a break in\ncustody as the rule. There has not been one published\nopinion, at least that we could find, that has this --\nthat has that scenario --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is the rationale for the\nbreak in custody that there is a likelihood of\nnon-coercion? Is that the reason that you offer for the\nrule?\nMR. GANSLER: Your Honor, it goes to --\nyes, this Court has said, most recently again in\nMontejo, that the reason for Edwards is that we want to\nprevent badgering.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. But this\nperson was in custody in the sense he was in prison and\nthe brief said, oh, he was released to the general\npopulation. But the possibilities for coercion or\npressure are very substantial in the prison. The warden\ncomes in and says: Oh, your cell doesn't have a window.\nI mine, there's countless way in which a prisoner in the\ngeneral prison population would consider that he is --\nthat there has been no break in custody. I think that's\na very difficult rule that you are proposing.\nMR. GANSLER: Well, the courts -- the lower\ncourts have shown that there is a difference between\npolice interrogational custody and correctional custody.\nWhat we are suggesting is once the person -- in our\ncase, for example, in the second interview, the\ndefendant was in what's called -- what's called a\nmaintenance room in the room, with a metal table and the\ntwo chairs. It was clearly an interrogation context.\nWhen that person is released from that, some people are\nhabitual criminals and they're put back into the general\npopulation amongst -- that's where they live for that\ntime period. Other people go home. But the break in\ncustody for Edwards purposes ought to end at the end of\nthe interrogation.\nNow, could there be an interrogational\nsituation while the person's in prison? Absolutely.\nYou can envision a correctional officer coming to the\ncafeteria when there's, the public is there, the public\nbeing other inmates, and that would not be deemed to be\nan interrogation atmosphere. If, however, they cleared\nthe cafeteria and had officers standing by the doors and\nblocking the doors and saying no one's allowed to come\nin here, that could then become interrogation custody.\nAnd this Court and other courts, the courts\nall the time, have to decide in the Edwards context\nwhether or not the defendant was in custody when the\nstatement was given.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But if the defendant goes\nhome, he can contact a lawyer. In prison he can't do\nthat. So, if the whole idea is to protect his right to\ncounsel, then it makes a big difference whether he's at\nhome or in prison.\nMR. GANSLER: Your Honor -- well, first of\nall, the defendant while they're in prison can contact a\nlawyer in some circumstances. For example, during the\ntwo years and seven months between these two\ninterrogations he could have written, he could have\ncalled.\nBut let's say that that was unavailable to\nthat particular defendant. It's our position that what\nEdwards does, Miranda, Edwards, Roberson, Minnick, it\nprovides the opportunity to consult counsel. But the --\nwhat we are talking about here is the custodial\ninterrogation situation. In other words, the police\ndon't have to get somebody a lawyer. Whether or not\nsomebody has the opportunity to consult a lawyer or not,\nas long as they are provided with their Miranda rights,\nthe Miranda rights themselves are the protection that\nthe defendant has.\nWe know, for example, in this case --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do we know exactly what\nthe Miranda warning in this case was?\nMR. GANSLER: The Miranda warnings in this\ncase the judge, the trial judge, found exactly comported\nwith the Miranda warning --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But what did it tell the\nperson in prison he could do about a lawyer?\nMR. GANSLER: That he had the right to a\nlawyer and --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Did it tell him how he\ncould get a lawyer?\nMR. GANSLER: It didn't --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If you're in prison and\nthey give you the Miranda warnings, what would that tell\nthe average prisoner with respect to access to a lawyer?\nMR. GANSLER: It would tell them they have a\nright to counsel and if they couldn't get one one would\nbe provided to them.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And would they have\nprovided a lawyer to him right away if they had -- he\nhad asked for it?\nMR. GANSLER: Well, had he asked for one,\nwhich he did the first time, what they did there --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: When he is in prison, I\nmean.\nMR. GANSLER: Yes. It's unclear from the\nrecord whether they would have or not. That would be\nconjecture. What they do what the bright line of\nEdwards says is they have to stop asking questions.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, I understand that.\nMR. GANSLER: Right.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'm just wondering if he\nthinks, well, I'd like a lawyer, what can he do?\nMR. GANSLER: He could -- during those two\nyears and seven months in this case, he could have tried\nto get a lawyer through -- either his own lawyer in the\ncase.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Right on the spot, when he\nis in the room there and they give him the Miranda\nwarnings and he says, that sounds like a good idea, what\nwould happen?\nMR. GANSLER: He would not be given a lawyer\nby the police at that time. There's not a lawyer sort\nof waiting outside.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So the Miranda warning is\na little misleading, isn't it, in that context?\nMR. GANSLER: Well, I would argue that it is\nnot, because he is given the right. He is said, if you\nwant a lawyer before talking to us, that's fine; you\nhave to invoke your right to counsel. He invokes the\nright to counsel, they stop talking to him. What he\ncan--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do they also say it will\nbe provided to you?\nMR. GANSLER: Yes, but he can -- there's a\nnumber of --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And it's not going to be\nprovided to him.\nMR. GANSLER: Well, it would be, Your Honor,\nif, for example, the lawyer in his underlying case came,\nhe could say, look, I need a lawyer, they're asking me\nquestions about this other case; can you represent me on\nthat case?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What if asks for a\nlawyer. He said: I don't want to talk to you without a\nlawyer, correct?\nMR. GANSLER: In 2003, yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And the State doesn't\nprovide him with a lawyer, correct?\nMR. GANSLER: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So what\ngives him an understanding that one will be provided the\nnext time he's questioned?\nMR. GANSLER: Well, what he does understand\nfrom the first time he is questioned -- and he\nunderstood the rights because he himself invoked that\nright to counsel. So he knew that he could say \"I want\na lawyer,\" and he did. What he understands is the\npolice will stop questioning him at that point.\nThere is no, as far as I can tell from the\njurisprudence and this Court's holdings, there is no\nobligation for the police to actually go out, nor would\nI suggest that you want to have that rule, to go out and\nactually ascertain, get a lawyer.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, because we tell the\npolice they have to stop.\nMR. GANSLER: Right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So presumably they\nwouldn't re- engage until the lawyer is present,\ncorrect? That's what Edwards tells them not to do.\nMR. GANSLER: Well, Edwards tells them to\nstop questioning. Minnick says that if they have the\nopportunity to consult with a lawyer they still can't\nstart without the lawyer being there. But that is a\ndifferent analysis than that because had they asked him\non the second time, after they read his rights and he\nsaid, I want a lawyer, they couldn't keep going until\nthere was a lawyer present. He chose during that two\nyears and seven months when he had a mental reset that\nhe didn't need a lawyer.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, this is a\ndifferent part of your argument. This is not the\ncustody or break in custody. This is the time and the\nfact that such a prolonged period of time has minimized\nany coercive effect, correct?\nMR. GANSLER: No, Your Honor. We would\nstill argue that -- in this case, obviously both exist.\nThe Court could fashion a bright line rule. This Court\nhas shown an interest in bright line rules in this area.\nAnd this Court could adopt a bright line rule of a\nparticular time period. We are arguing the better\nbright line rule would be a break in custody. Obviously\na break in custody plus --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Catch and release then\nno longer -- catch and release is unimportant to you?\nThere is no meaning to Edwards in that situation,\nbecause every prisoner, because he is a captive, is\nquestioned in a place and then told to go back to his\nroom. His room happens to be a locked cell. So he\ndoesn't have the freedom to leave and he doesn't have\nthe freedom necessarily to make calls to discuss his\nchoice with anyone.\nMR. GANSLER: Well, in this case --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: This is a very different\nsituation then someone who is free to go home.\nMR. GANSLER: I'm not sure -- the question\nsort of posits two different scenarios. One scenario is\nwhen the defendant is arrested, they are questioned and\nthen they are put into a cell. That is a different\nscenario. That would be a pretrial detention analysis,\nwhich in Minnick, Roberson and Edwards extended up to\nthree days, which we would argue is sort of the end of\nthe time line right as it exists today.\nThe different scenario, which is in this\ncase, is, yes, he is locked up in the general\npopulation, he comes in for the interrogation, he is\nthen released back to his daily routine. And at that\npoint our view is that the rebuttable presumption of\nEdwards ends. And you know --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because he is not in\ncustody, when he is in jail.\nMR. GANSLER: He is not --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: When he can't leave --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: True, we have to reach out\nand find some arbitrary number, but after all, Edwards\nis an arbitrary rule.\nMR. GANSLER: The reason why I think break\nin custody is not as problematic, and this goes to the\nJustice's earlier question as well, is because literally\nthe year after Edwards, 1982, was the first of the eight\nFederal circuits that found the break in custody rule.\nAnd there is no -- they have been able to work with\nthis.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What -- there is no\nsmall --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In those cases, was there\na considerable interval between --\nMR. GANSLER: Not --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It was just the break in\ncustody? A week --\nMR. GANSLER: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- was enough?\nMR. GANSLER: Yes, Your Honor. Obviously,\nin different cases there's different lengths of time.\nBut if -- in Justice Kennedy's question, if we were\ngoing to adopt a time limit, I -- we would suggest,\nlike, for example, a seven-day time limit. The Court\nsuggests that is arbitrary. The reason why I would pick\nseven days is, right now the rule is three days, and you\ncannot envision the situation, at least I can't, where\nsomebody would be held without being presented for more\nthan three or four days, so --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why do you say the rule is\nthree days? What rule is that?\nMR. GANSLER: Because right now, if you look\nat Edwards being the next day, Minnick and Roberson\nbeing three days, that that is the only cases from this\nCourt which says when the Edwards presumption goes. So\nwe don't have -- whether -- what Respondent's rule would\ndo is, in our view, extend it right now from the\nthree-day limit -- now, many have suggested that's in\nperpetuity.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah, but you -- you are\nnot arguing for a seven-day limit no matter what, even\nif he is held in jail, are you?\nMR. GANSLER: If he is held in jail on his\nown case -- see, the most difficult scenario, in our\nview, is one that we don't think the Court needs to\nreach here, which is actually the Green case from the\nDistrict of Columbia, where he is held on his own case\nin a pretrial detention --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. GANSLER: -- scenario, because then he\ndoes have different incentives to cooperate or not\ncooperate with the police and then the question would\nbe, well, does that -- is the break of custody there at\nconviction or at sentencing? And we can quibble about\nthat.\nWe don't need to get to that in this case.\nBut if he is held in jail on another case, that's where\nhe lives. He is there for 10, 15, 20 years, and he is\nbrought in, away from the life that he is accustomed to,\nand put there with different officers in a metal room --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose it's the same\nofficer. Does -- you said in your brief and just now it\nwas a different officer. Suppose it was the same\nofficer?\nMR. GANSLER: Well, I actually think for --\nin this case, with Detective Blankenship and Detective\nHoover, the Court should assume it's one and the same.\nIn fact, Roberson said just that, that within the same\ndepartment -- but it is instructive in this sense. In\nRespondent's -- if Respondent's rule were to be adopted,\nthere is no way that one police department can know what\nhappened in front of another police department, in front\nof another police department, while that person is being\ndetained --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, you could limit it\nto the same police department, the same investigation,\nso you are not covering the waterfront of every\ninterrogation about any crime, any place.\nMR. GANSLER: Except for right now, we live\nin a world of Roberson, where we do. So in other words,\nif a defendant invokes in California for a shoplifting\ncase and then is transported to Iowa and then to\nMaryland, the Maryland authorities have no idea whether\nhe invoked in one of the other two.\nWhat is worse is right now, since we don't\nhave a break in custody rule, this defendant, Shatzer\nhimself, could have invoked counsel 20, 25 years ago in\nsome other State. We have no way of knowing that.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, the\nhypothetical you are positing is an investigation about\nunrelated crimes. We are talking about, and I think\nit's what Justice Ginsburg was pointing to, it was an\ninvocation on this crime, on this criminal activity, not\none in another State or another police department. And\nso that's a substantially different question.\nMR. GANSLER: It is, though he is not being\nheld on -- on that crime. He is being held on a\ncompletely unrelated sexual abuse case. I mean, it's\nrelated in the sense it's the same crime, but it's a\ndifferent case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So I thought\nRoberson told us it's not a different question, that\nit's the same question. Roberson did not draw a\ndistinction between what crime he was being questioned\non the second time.\nMR. GANSLER: That's exactly right, and\nthat's what creates the problem that if defendant -- if\nwe don't have a break in custody rule, a defendant who\ninvokes anywhere at any time is forever immune from\nbeing questioned by the police, regardless of what would\nbe a sort of a wholly irrational view and an absurd\nresult, which I think is where we live right now.\nAnd it becomes, obviously, greater in a\nworld where we have DNA. Obviously, there was no DNA in\n1981, but with these cold cases coming back 15, 20, 25\nyears later --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, I wonder if you're\nright about that premise. Supposing the prison had a\nrule that the inmate does not have to see visitors and\nthey say that: Somebody here wants to talk to you. And\nhe says: I don't want to talk to him. And if he\nrefused to talk, then if he did talk, it would be\nvoluntary, rather than the situation you described. Do\nI make myself clear?\nMR. GANSLER: Yes, Your Honor, and I don't\nknow sort of what the protocol of each of the prisons\nwould be, but I would think that if a prisoner did not\nwant to speak with the officers that came to see him\nabout a crime, the prisoner would be able to say so and\nhas. And this defendant has -- has actually been able\nto invoke that himself. If there's --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What is the shortest\ntime period that any circuit court has found a break in\ncustody in a similar situation?\nMR. GANSLER: A break in custody that --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Between the invocation\nof counsel and a requestioning. You said a number of\ncircuit courts have recognized this break in custody\ntheory.\nMR. GANSLER: Actually, all -- eight Federal\ncircuits. I don't know what the shortest is. But there\nare cases that are weeks rather than years that they\nhave --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Which are days?\nMR. GANSLER: What's that?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Any are days?\nMR. GANSLER: Not that I am aware of, Your\nHonor.\nAnd with that, I will reserve -- if there\nare no further questions, I will reserve the remainder\nof my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Heytens.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF TOBY J. HEYTENS\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. HEYTENS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis Court has repeatedly made clear that\nEdwards v. Arizona is a prophylactic rule designed to\nimplement the protections of Miranda v. Arizona, and it\ndoes so by operating as an anti-badgering rule. On the\nfacts of this case, I don't think there is any colorable\nargument that Mr. Shatzer was badgered into waiving his\nSixth Amendment rights.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, I know that you're\ngoing to go into the question of how we shape a rule,\nand I would like you, and perhaps on rebuttal your other\ncounsel, to comment on the following: I don't see -- as\nJustice Kennedy had a problem, so do I have a problem\nwith anything that just says break in custody, and\ntaking time seems fairly arbitrary.\nSuppose you -- could you try to shape a rule\non the civil situation, the codes of ethics, where you\nare not supposed to talk to a client who is represented\nby a lawyer? That's where my mind is going. And the\nbest I could do at the moment is you would say: When,\ndue to a breach in custody and the passage of time, the\nquestioner did not and would not reasonably believe that\nthe suspect was looking for or was represented by\ncounsel?\nWhat I've tried to do is take the purpose of\nthe civil rule, the ordinary ethical rule, and then use\nit to shape a standard. So I would appreciate any\ncomments on that thought.\nMR. HEYTENS: Justice Breyer, I think there\nis a few problems with that approach. First of all,\nthis case is not about the Sixth Amendment right to the\nassistance of counsel. It's about the Fifth Amendment\nright against compulsory self-incrimination, and this\nCourt has said several times that rules of legal ethics\nare not relevant to the Fifth Amendment\nself-incrimination rule. It says that in the Burbine\ncase, for example. That is the case where, although the\nquestioner knew that the suspect had an attorney who was\ntrying to reach him, the Court said that is not a Fifth\nAmendment self-incrimination problem, because we have to\nlook at things from the perspective of the suspect.\nThe question is whether the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Quite a lot of what I read\nwas about the problems of counsel. Counsel has nothing\nto do with this, nothing at all?\nMR. HEYTENS: Counsel has something to do\nwith it, but the Court has made clear going back to\nMiranda that when we're we are talking about the Fifth\nAmendment right to counsel, the only reason that counsel\nmatters is to help to make sure that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: If -- are we interested in\ncounsel or not? If we are interested in whether he's\nrepresented by counsel, and Miranda covers both, then I\nwould repeat my question.\nMR. HEYTENS: We are not --\nJUSTICE BREYER: If we are not interested in\nrepresentation by counsel, then I would withdraw my\nquestion and you don't have to answer it.\nMR. HEYTENS: We have -- in the Fifth\nAmendment context, we are interested in counsel only as\na derivative of his right not to be forced to\nincriminate himself. It is in this context a purely\nderivative right, and we need to look at it from his\nperspective.\nI think the reason that this case matters in\nan intensely practical way is, there are approximately a\nmillion and a half prison inmates in this country right\nnow, many of whom are serving extremely long sentences.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, couldn't we say that\nin -- in the situation where there is a change from\npretrial status to post-conviction status, the Edwards\nrule is no longer an irrebuttable presumption, but it's\nsimply a rebuttable presumption? And that there -- that\nthe rule would not apply if the prosecution could show\nthat under the circumstances the reason for the rule,\nthe concern about law enforcement badgering, was not\npresent?\nMR. HEYTENS: That would certainly be open\nto the Court to say that, Justice Alito. Ultimately,\nthis is a -- a second-order --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Would it be a good idea to\nsay that?\nMR. HEYTENS: I don't think it would be a\ngood idea.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought we liked clear\nlines in this. I mean, the police won't know what to\ndo.\nMR. HEYTENS: And, Justice Scalia, that's --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But carrying -- carrying\nthat analysis one step further, if you are just talking\nabout people who were inmates pursuant to prior\nconviction, why wouldn't the better rule be that if the\ninmate is given the opportunity to say no, I don't want\na visitor today, and then if he accepts the visitor, you\nwould say he is no longer in custody? But if he says, I\ndon't want to, then he -- then he is in custody and you\npreserves the presumption.\nMR. HEYTENS: Well, Justice Stevens, I\nsuspect that's what the police would do, if you ruled\nagainst the State in this case. But I think the reason\nthat you shouldn't do that is you have to ask yourself\nwhat is the benefit that such a rule is trying to\naccomplish. The Court has made clear again --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, that -- such a rule\nwould accomplish the benefit when he really wants --\nwilling to talk, he would say: I would be glad to talk\nto the officer.\nMR. HEYTENS: Well, Justice Stevens --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If he doesn't want to, he\nshould just say no.\nMR. HEYTENS: Justice Stevens, if he didn't\nwant to talk to the officer, there was nothing to\nprevent him from invoking his Fifth Amendment right to\ncounsel.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But it is a little\ndifferent when the man first comes, says, will you talk\nto officer. He can very clearly say no. But if he is\nin the room with two or three people around in a\ndifferent setting, then he is still in custody.\nMR. HEYTENS: He is in custody, Justice\nStevens, but the premise of Miranda is that a person who\nis given the Miranda warnings can choose to decide\nwhether to talk or not to talk.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If the change --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You started to tell us why\nthis case was important. Would you -- would you finish\nthat? You said there were --\nMR. HEYTENS: Certainly. The reason this\ncase is important, Justice Scalia, is that because under\nthe Maryland Court of Appeals decision no police\nofficer, no corrections official, can approach any\nprisoner without first attempting to determine if at\nsome point, to someone, at some place, during the period\nof continuous incarceration he has ever invoked his\nFifth Amendment right to counsel.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That's not true, because\nmy hypothetical, if you told him you don't have to talk\nto the officer, and you could produce something, they\ncould question every -- everybody in jail all over the\ncountry.\nMR. HEYTENS: Well, they can't approach him\nfor questioning.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: They can't force him to\nattend the questioning. But if they give him an\nopportunity to say, I -- I'm a prisoner, I just want to\nstay in the prison population and not go to an\ninterrogation room. And if he is willing to go, you\ncould question him. You do not have the example of no\npossibility.\nMR. HEYTENS: Justice Stevens, the problem\nin that situation, again, though, is that ultimately the\nonly basis for applying this presumption at all is if\nit's appropriate to apply an irrebuttable presumption\nthat, even though we gave him the Miranda warnings and\neven though he said, I am happy to talk to you, we\nshould presume that when he said that, that wasn't the\ntruth.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I thought that you\ncouldn't approach him. I thought that once he's invoked\nhis right to counsel, you can't approach him and say,\nwould you like to talk now? Right? Isn't that -- isn't\nthat the rule?\nMR. HEYTENS: Well, under Rhode Island v.\nEnnis, you are entitled to -- to update him on the\nstatus of the interrogation, but you are not entitled to\nresume custodial interrogation unless there has been a\nbreak in custody or something has terminated Edwards.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, if the incarceration\nis a continuation of custodial custody, to be redundant,\nif it is a continuation of the custody, then why\nwouldn't asking him whether he would like to see\nvisitors who want to ask him about a particular crime,\nwhy wouldn't that be a violation of Edwards?\nMR. HEYTENS: I think defendants may well\nargue that it was --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm sure they would.\nMR. HEYTENS: -- Justice Scalia, and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So the -- the -- the scheme\nthat Justice Stevens proposes wouldn't work. You would\nbe violating Edwards when you asked him if he wanted to\nsee interrogators.\nMR. HEYTENS: I think there would be a risk\nof that happening. I think the other reason is --\nagain, this is a second order prophylactic rule that the\nCourt has adopted solely in order to prevent people from\nbeing coerced, coerced into incriminating themselves\nwhen they don't want to.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You join counsel for the\nState in just not wanting to argue for a time rule,\nwhich seems to me the only thing that would work.\nMR. HEYTENS: We -- we -- think the break in\ncustody approach is the more appropriate one that will\nlead to fewer line-drawing problems. It is certainly\nopen to --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That's become apparent,\nand I'm indicating that I think the time rule might have\nsome benefits.\nMR. HEYTENS: Well, we certainly don't\noppose the Court adopting a time rule in the event that\nit rejects our primary submission. In United States v.\nGreen, the government argued for a raw passage of time\napproach, and we think, ultimately, this is the Court's\nrule, it's a second order prophylaxis rule that is\ndesigned to implement the Fifth Amendment, and it would\ncertainly be open to the Court if it thought necessary\nto --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But you don't give us\nany -- any suggestions. As -- you know, the State opens\nthe bidding with seven days.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But the Speedy Trial Act,\nwith many exceptions, requires that you go to trial\nwithin 70 days. Would that be a benchmark?\nMR. HEYTENS: Well, I think as a practical\nmatter, though, there are so -- as you point out,\nJustice Kennedy, there are so many exceptions to that.\nWe think that would be far longer than would be\nnecessary or appropriate under the circumstances. I\nmean --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In this -- in this case\nit's two years and seven months. Why should the Court\ntake that -- a period of that length and say, well, we\nare going to now rule for all future cases it should be,\nsay, six months.\nMR. HEYTENS: Well, I think that is another\npotential defect in adopting a pure passage of time\napproach, though I think this case is particularly easy.\nAnd I think the fact that the Maryland Court\nof Appeals in this case concluded that two years and\nseven months is covered by an anti-badgering rule just\nshows at some point how far this has departed from the\noriginal purposes of Edwards in the first place.\nSo, I do think -- I mean, the Court could\nsimply say this case is too long, though at that point\nthe Court isn't providing a great deal of guidance to\nthe lower courts that have to deal with these problems\non a day-to-day basis.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Or to the police who have\nto decide whether they can interrogate or not.\nMR. HEYTENS: Absolutely. It would also not\nprovide very much guidance to the police to just say two\nyears and seven months is too long. And that's again\nwhy we think an approach that is either -- either\ntethered to the break in custody, which as I think I\nhave said, we think better maps on to the concern that\nmotivated Edwards --\nLet me address for a moment the catch and\nrelease situation.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't want to\ninterrupt that, but there were two aspects to Edwards.\nOne was the coercion, but the other was the respect for\nthe advisement of counsel. And so the test that you are\nproposing only addresses the coercion prong of it, not\nthe respect for the invocation of counsel.\nMR. HEYTENS: The Court has mentioned\nrespect in the choice. I think, with respect,\nultimately though, that can't be the basis for the\nEdwards rule. The Court has made clear repeatedly that\nthe Fifth Amendment prohibits only compelling someone to\nbe a witness against himself.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMs. Davis.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CELIA A. DAVIS\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. DAVIS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nCreating exceptions to the rule of Edwards\nmeans a clear rule is lost. It introduces uncertainty\ninto the determinations of what constitutes custody and\nwhat length of time might be adequate to excuse the\nprotection.\nJUSTICE ALITO: This is an area where it is\nvery difficult to draw lines, at least I find it\ndifficult to draw lines. So let me start you out with\nan extreme hypothetical, and I would like you tell me\nwhether you think the Edwards rule reaches this far.\nAnd if it doesn't, then I would like you to tell me why\nit doesn't. And what limitations, if any, on the rule\nyou would be willing to defend as consistent with the\nrationale for the rule.\nSomeone is taken into custody in Maryland in\n1999 and questioned for joy riding, released from\ncustody, and then in 2009 is taken into custody and\nquestioned for murder in Montana.\nNow, at the time of the first questioning,\nthe -- the suspect invokes the Fifth Amendment right to\ncounsel. Now, does the Edwards rule apply to the second\ninterrogation?\nMS. DAVIS: Yes, it does, Justice Alito.\nThe Edwards rule provides two ending points as it stands\nright now.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And you don't think that's a\nridiculous application of the rule? First of all, how\nare the authorities in Montana possibly going to know\nwhether this person was interrogated previously on a\ncrime for which the person was never convicted in\nMaryland, and that invoked the right not to be\nquestioned without -- without an attorney? And you\nthink there is badgering in that situation?\nMS. DAVIS: Yes, Justice Alito, because\nbadgering in this context has become a term of art. It\nis used in quotation marks in the Montejo opinion.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't mean badgering.\nMS. DAVIS: It means an attempt by --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We ought to get another\nterm for it then.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Questioning?\nMS. DAVIS: I think it means returning in an\nattempt to get a suspect to change his or her mind. And\nin this case, the suspect said when first questioned --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There was no attempt in\nthis hypothetical to get him to change his mind. They\ndidn't know he had made up his mind.\nMS. DAVIS: Well, first of all, I didn't\nanswer the question properly. But the police, I think,\ncan run a rap sheet and find out from prior arrests if a\nperson has been taken into custody. And that would\nalert a police officer that that person may have invoked\ntheir right and they should do more to find out. And\nsecond --\nJUSTICE ALITO: So all right, they run the\nrap sheet and they find out, if they do, that the person\nwas arrested ten years earlier in Maryland and then\nwhat? They try to find the detective that questioned\nthe -- the suspect in 1999 in Maryland? And they find\nout that the detective is retired and is now, you know,\nfishing down in the Florida Keys, and they have to track\nthis person down and say, now do you recall whether this\nperson -- that's the rule you are arguing for?\nMS. DAVIS: Well, the police officer should\nattempt to do so. But I understand that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry to\ninterrupt you -- interrupt there, and I will let you get\nback to the answer. They should attempt to do so. The\nrule here does not allow the police to approach that\nperson, a murder suspect. And you are saying he cannot\neven be approached to see if he would waive his rights\nten years later because he was -- invoked the right in\nconnection with joy riding?\nMS. DAVIS: Yes. Because --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.\nMS. DAVIS: -- if they have invoked the\nright, then the second approach means an attempt to\npersuade the person to change their mind about having\ncounsel. And where they haven't done so in the interim,\nthat amounts to --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Let me pose you my\nhypothetical again, the same joy riding questioning, and\nthen 40 years later after the person has gotten a law\ndegree and become an entrepreneur and made $20 million,\nhe's taken into custody and questioned by the Federal\nauthorities for stock fraud. Forever, you know, this\nright that was invoked back in adolescence continues\nforever.\nMS. DAVIS: It should. But let's look at\nthis case, Your Honor, because here this suspect was\nquestioned about the same allegations by detectives from\nthe same police department and while he was in custody\ncontinuously. And under those circumstances Edwards and\nthe rationale of Edwards should apply strongly.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Just in case -- just in\ncase we don't -- we want to put a time limit on it,\nwhich I know you don't want us to do. I'm now thinking\nand I would like your comment, if you want, of a\ncombination of what Justice Alito said and what I said,\nthat is, that there are two parts to the Edwards thing.\nOne is the lawyer part, and the other is the\nincriminating self part.\nNow the lawyer part would be handled by\nshaping a rule based on the rules of evidence, along the\nlines I suggested. And that would give you a time. And\nthen the Miranda part could be handled by saying: but\nthe suspect retains the right to show that this\nquestioning is badgering without the question marks. In\nother words what they are really up to is to try to get\nhim to change his mind. Now would that work?\nMS. DAVIS: I -- I believe the Court could\nadopt a type of rebuttable presumption under these\ncircumstances but it shows the difficulty that courts\nwould have and police officers, too, in measuring\ndegrees, degrees of coercion or degrees of custody. I\nthink the foregoing discussion has illustrated that\nprisoners may be under different types of coercion in\ntheir prison context. I just --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I ask something?\nWhat does that have to do with the hypothetical Justice\nAlito gave you, which is the person is not in custody,\nright?\nMS. DAVIS: Well--\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: He is arrested for joy\nriding; he is let go; and you are saying that for 20,\n40 years he is now immunized from being reapproached by\nthe police under the Edwards rule?\nMS. DAVIS: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you are advocating\nthat no break in custody ever stops the Edwards clock.\nMS. DAVIS: Right. The problems with the\nbreak in custody are a break will exist in almost every\ncase, and even in Edwards there was a change in\ncustody --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but not --\nMS. DAVIS: -- between the police to a State\nor county jail. So there is a change in -- a break in\ncustody right there. The prisoner was removed from the\npolice department and taken to the county jail.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It was one day. He\nsaid he wanted the --\nMS. DAVIS: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- to remain silent\nin the evening, and at 9:00 the next morning they were\nback.\nMS. DAVIS: But a -- a release from custody\ndoes not signal that a person who has asked for counsel\nhas changed.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you are now -- you\nare now accepting your adversary's point that somehow a\n-- a change from a locked room in a prison to a\ndifferent locked room is a release from custody.\nMS. DAVIS: No, I don't --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If we don't -- if we\ndon't accept that proposition, isn't there a clear break\nwhen someone is let to go home? When someone is\nreleased and permitted to go home?\nMS. DAVIS: There is more of a break,\nJustice Sotomayor, but it doesn't say anything about\nthat person's choice to proceed with counsel, and if\ncounsel is not provided then the attorney is excluded\nfrom the adversary system of Federal justice.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you about a\ndifferent approach? We are dealing in this case with\nsomebody who was constantly in custody but for a\ndifferent reason than the during the pretrial situation.\nHe is in the general prison population. What -- what\nwould be wrong with the rule that said that a person in\nthat situation should be advised that somebody wants to\nquestion him, and he has a right to say I do or do not\nwant to talk to the visitor? And if he is willing to\ntalk to the visitor, then you have to give him new\nMiranda warnings and you start from scratch.\nBut have the -- have the focus on whether he\nis in custody at the time of the questioning, and say\nthat an inability to refuse to go to the interrogation\nroom would be not treated as custody. It would be\ntreated as in the general prison population. What would\nbe wrong with such a rule?\nMS. DAVIS: I don't think anything's wrong\nand I don't think a new rule is needed to cover that\nsituation, because it is conceivable that a person, even\nin a prison environment, if they have control, if they\nwere to telephone out or to be free to refuse visitors,\nmight not be considered in custody.\nBut in this case Michael Shatzer lived in a\nprison environment. He was not free to --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But the record doesn't\ntell us whether he was given an opportunity to say \"I\ndon't want any visitors today.\"\nMS. DAVIS: No, it does not, but I think the\nState has the burden to show. The circumstances --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, it's a question who\nhas the burden of showing he's in custody or is he free\nto live leave. If he has the burden, he didn't carry\nthe burden in this case.\nMS. DAVIS: Well, the record does show that\nhe lived in a maximum security prison --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Correct.\nMS. DAVIS: -- and does not show that he\nwould be free to refuse.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But you can still live in\na maximum security prison and say I don't want any\nvisitors.\nMS. DAVIS: We don't know that he could have\nrefused under the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: As far as the records\nshow.\nMS. DAVIS: Right, we don't know that. But\nJustice Stevens --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do -- do we have to ask\nhim, you know, what visitors? I mean, is that the\nquestion?\nMS. DAVIS: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you want to have any\nvisitors today?\nMS. DAVIS: This shows --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He says, I don't know. Is\nit my mother?\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Or -- or do you ask him,\nare you willing to speak to investigators about a crime?\nAnd he says what crime? I mean, how specific does --\ndoes the request for permission to have visitors have to\nbe?\nMS. DAVIS: Well, I think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- for this rule to cut in?\nMS. DAVIS: This discussion shows the\nproblems with allowing such a determination in the first\nplace. Our position is the definition of custody for\nMiranda purposes must be the same for Edwards purposes,\nfor a prisoner lives within confined space under\nconstant surveillance, and with no freedoms and limited\nexpectation of privacy.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So then I don't\nunderstand why your answer to Justice Alito's\nhypothetical was what it was, because that person\nobvious was not in custody.\nMS. DAVIS: It -- all I'm saying is that if\nwe were to adopt the language that this Court in Montejo\nutilized, if a person is in control, if a person is not\nin custody, they are in control and can shut the door or\nwalk away. If that's an operable definition, then it\ndid not apply in this case, because Michael Shatzer did\nnot have such freedom of --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, if you're -- if you\nare going to use the Edwards, which I think is a good\nidea, as counsel part, which I think is a good starting\nplace, you and every other member of the bar deals with\nthis problem every day of the week. Not every day of\nthe week, but very often. You know somebody's\nrepresented in a case, and you know you are supposed to\ntalk to the lawyer. But eventually time passes, and\nthen you are probably free to talk to him, because the\nwhole thing's gone away.\nNow that's a pretty vague rule. You could\nmake it more specific, but the -- the bar has lived with\nthat kind of situation, I guess for years.\nMS. DAVIS: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So why can't we here?\nMS. DAVIS: We -- I think we should. The\npolice officers have lived with the Edwards decision\nwhich says --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no, that's not what I\nmean. I mean that the obligation to deal with counsel,\nyou don't have, after enough time passes, that it's no\nlonger reasonable to think that that individual either\nhas or wants counsel.\nMS. DAVIS: Well, in this case there is no\nreason to think that this suspect changed his mind.\nWhen first given his --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me, what is the\nethical rule about counsel? I thought if -- if there's\ncounsel in a particular case and you want to approach\nthe client about that case, you can't do it without\ngoing to counsel.\nMS. DAVIS: I think, though --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But when there is an\nentirely different case, there is totally different\nlitigation, you can't approach the fellow without going\nback to the counsel whom he hired for a different case?\nI don't think that's the ethical rule. But that's the\neffect of Edwards. Even if it's a different crime, you\nhave to go back to the counsel whom he hired for a\ndifferent prosecution? That bears no relationship to\nthe ethical rules of -- of counsel.\nMS. DAVIS: Well this Court could adopt a\nrule that the Edwards protection -- an alternative that\nwas raised in United States v. Green -- that the Edwards\nprotection extends to the same case for which the police\ninitially questioned the suspect and for which he asked\nfor counsel. That's one alternative and I submit that\nwould be more clear than --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It would make a\ndifference? Does it make a difference? If -- we can\nlimit it to the same case. But here, the reason that\nthe police came back is that they had additional\nevidence, and so they wanted to ask him, confront him\nwith the new evidence. It's not the same situation that\nit was when he was initially questioned.\nMS. DAVIS: Well, I think from the suspect's\npoint of view it is the same situation. He was in the\nsame position, facing the police in 2003 as he was in\n2006, in that he was accused of committing crime and in\nthe interim he had no access to counsel and I think that\nthis is significant in this case, because it's not clear\nthat even if he had been able to call out of the prison\nhe would have had representation, because the public\ndefender's office was under no constitutional or\nstatutory duty to provide counsel for a person who's not\npresently being questioned and who has not yet been\ncharged.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What if -- what if we\nlimited Edwards to the same crime? That would -- that\nwould really make it much easier form the police to --\nMS. DAVIS: I agree.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- to know whether this\nperson in fact invoked the right to counsel.\nMS. DAVIS: It would be easier, yes; and it\nwould apply to this case because it was the same crime.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So that would --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Would that require us to\noverrule Roberson?\nMS. DAVIS: Well, it does present some\ntensions with Roberson. However, in this case, since it\nis limited to the same crime, does it extend as far as\nRoberson does? And I would like to answer Justice\nStevens' question.\nIn this case, the suspect was told -- he was\nadvised of his rights and said, \"I have the right to\ntalk to a lawyer and have him present with me while I'm\nbeing questioned. If I cannot afford to hire a lawyer,\none will be appointed to resent -- represent me before\nany questioning, if I wish.\"\nThose rights were never fulfilled in the two\nyears and seven months they've had.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but the\nMiranda Rights do not require the police to provide\ncounsel. They have to mean -- mean you have to stop\nquestioning, until the person has right to counsel.\nMS. DAVIS: Yes. They have to.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And the one thing\nthis person knew from the prior Miranda situation -- was\n2003?\nMS. DAVIS: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that, if he said,\n\"I don't want to talk without counsel,\" the one thing he\nknew is that the police would stop questioning because\nthat's what they did.\nMS. DAVIS: But that's not the same, Chief\nJustice Roberts, as having the counsel present during\nquestioning.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, Miranda\ndoesn't --\nMS. DAVIS: If your Miranda advice --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Go ahead.\nMS. DAVIS: -- says that you have the right\nto have a counsel present during questioning, and all\nthat advice means, after time, is, We will stop\nquestioning you, then the right has been diminished over\ntime.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why is there a greater risk\nof badgering when the questioning is about a different\noffense?\nMS. DAVIS: I think the risk is the same.\nThe risk --\nJUSTICE ALITO: I thought you just said we\ncould -- you were suggesting an -- as an alternative,\nthat -- that Edwards be limited to situations where the\nquestioning is about the same offense.\nMS. DAVIS: Well, that's possible -- well,\nthe rationale that was extended in the Greene case is\nthat, if questioning is about a different time, the\nperception, from the suspect's point of view, that the\npolice are badgering him, would be less.\nJUSTICE ALITO: I mean, this isn't fanciful.\nWe just were asked to take a case involving a statute of\nlimitations issue for a murder that was committed like\n30 years ago, and it said suppose somebody is questioned\nby State authorities for a murder and taken into custody\nand then released and then, 30 years later, taken into\ncustody by Federal authorities and questioned for a\ncivil rights violation, based on the same underlying\ntransaction.\nYou would say the Edwards rule applies in\nthat situation?\nMS. DAVIS: Yes. It does. Now, a police\nofficer in that situation, really, has three\nalternatives. One, they could wait until counsel was\npresent, to be sure of obtaining a statement admissible\nin the State's case-in-chief.\nNumber 2, they could take a chance, as\nhappened in this case, where Detective Hoover never\nopened a case file and didn't know that the suspect had\never invoked his right, take a statement anyway, and run\nthe risk that it may have to be excluded. Or, three --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you are being very\nunrealistic. Have you ever known defense counsel who\nsays, \"Oh, yes,\" to submit to the interrogation? I\nmean -- you know, once they are lawyered up, they are\nnot going to talk. You know that.\nMS. DAVIS: Yes. I know that, but that --\nthis Court, in Miranda, was concerned with the limits\nthat society must impose, consistent with the\nConstitution, in prosecuting crimes, and I think Edwards\nstrikes the balance between the individual faced in\ncaptivity questioned by interrogators and the State.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you say, \"in\ncaptivity,\" but you think the rule applies, whether they\nare in captivity or not. In -- in Justice Alito's\nhypothetical, the person was free for 40 years, so\ncaptivity is not a limitation on your -- your proposed\nrule.\nMS. DAVIS: Well, a person is going to be in\ncustody in each Edwards scenario at the time they are\nquestioned, so the question is the intervening time\nperiod. I want to say --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, you agreed that, if\nhe is questioned and he is not in custody when he is\nbeing questioned. If he stopped on the street or in his\nliving room, they can question him there. That's the --\nMS. DAVIS: Yes, because Edwards only\napplies to custodial interrogation, and, under these\ncircumstances, Edwards strikes a balance in a familiar\nand predictable way. The fact that these case -- this\ncase does not -- does not --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, we --\nMS. DAVIS: -- permit an exception.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We don't have a case.\nNone of the cases in this area, where we have applied\nEdwards, has dealt with a situation with -- where a\nprisoner has been released from custody, in any sense of\nthat word, i.e., sent home.\nIn all of the three situations that I am\naware of, in which the Edwards rule has applied, the\nprisoner has stayed in jail -- some form of jail.\nCorrect?\nMS. DAVIS: Yes, some form of jail. But\nthere is -- you know, Chief Justice Roberts referred to\nthe difference between the -- the police station and the\nprison.\nThere are also pretrial detention centers,\nand there is a range of custodial scenarios that -- that\npolice officers might encounter. And advancing an\nexception to the rule for a break in custody presents\npractical problems.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I suppose, if\nthey are in a pretrial detention center, they know they\nare still being looked at for the crime as to which they\nhave invoked the Miranda warnings.\nMS. DAVIS: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you wouldn't call\nthat -- and I don't understand the other side to argue\nthat that is -- there is a break in custody there.\nMS. DAVIS: But a transfer within -- look.\nIf it doesn't, then -- then it doesn't, but there should\nnot be a break there. Otherwise, there would have been\na break in Edwards and in many --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. No. I agree\nwith you. There shouldn't be a break there, but, here,\nthe situation is quite different. There is a break\nbetween jail for questioning and prison for 15 years --\nor whatever your sentence is.\nMS. DAVIS: But, from the suspect's point of\nview, the only thing that changed is the State agents\nwho temporarily held him in a room for questioning. He\nwas still --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but -- but wouldn't\nit make sense to treat the -- the change from a pretrial\ndetention to a general prison population as, by itself,\na no longer custody, provided he is told that he doesn't\nhave to talk to people who want to pay him a visit.\nHe could say -- they could have a rule, say\nthat the prisoner does not have to talk to everybody who\ncomes -- comes around, and then you could treat that as\nthe functional equivalent of not being in custody.\nWouldn't that be a sensible rule?\nMS. DAVIS: It's -- it's one possibility,\nbut I don't think it's a workable rule. The\ncircumstances of custody within an institution can\nchange dramatically.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: They can, but, if you say,\nas a condition to -- to questioning, he just has to know\nthat he doesn't have to see visitors he doesn't want to\nsee, which doesn't seem, to me, a very hard rule to\nadminister.\nMS. DAVIS: It doesn't, Justice Stevens, but\nI think the problem is it's a hard rule for police\nofficers to know. If they go to an institution to\nquestion someone, how do they know if that rule is\napplicable to that prisoner?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Doesn't -- but doesn't the\nbeginning of the Miranda warning tell him that he\ndoesn't have to --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: They have the prisoner\nthere, and he shows up, and then -- that's the end of\nit.\nMS. DAVIS: I still think it presents\ndifficulties.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could I have a\nclarification of the facts for a moment?\nIn 2003, he was in one State facility, a\nsentenced prisoner. Correct?\nMS. DAVIS: Correct.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And he was just moved\nfrom one State prison to another. He wasn't in pretrial\ndetention in either of these timeframes. Correct?\nMS. DAVIS: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We are just talking\nabout a change in facility, not in status?\nMS. DAVIS: Exactly. And, Justice\nSotomayor, I wanted to answer your question about the\ntime period, where the circuit courts have sanctioned a\nbreak in custody. One is cited in the Respondent's\nbrief, at page 27, is Holman versus Kemna, and a one-day\nbreak was -- was authorized in that case. That's a very\nshort time period.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What were the\ncircumstances? I don't recall the case.\nMS. DAVIS: Well, that was the case that is\nnot entirely analogous, but it's close, where the\nquestion was whether a statement was tainted by an\nEdwards' violation. It also involved the Sixth\nAmendment, I believe, so --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Was the prisoner in a\nprison the entire 24 hours? Or was the individual\nreleased home, that sort of --\nMS. DAVIS: I think it was a release home.\nIf I recall correctly, I would have to double-check, but\nthere was a one-day period that the Court recognized.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do I misunderstand Miranda\nwarnings? Isn't he told, at the very outset of the\nMiranda warning, that he doesn't have to talk, if he\ndoesn't want to talk?\nIs that -- is that any less strong than --\nthan asking him whether he wants to receive visitors, in\ngeneral? Or, in particular, a visitor who wants to ask\nhim about a particular crime?\nI mean, he is -- he is told that with the\nMiranda warning, which he is given the second time. If\nyou don't want to talk, you don't have to. If you want\na lawyer to be present, you are entitled to a lawyer,\nor -- and -- and or, else, we terminate.\nI don't know why that isn't enough.\nMS. DAVIS: It isn't enough, Justice Scalia,\nbecause -- and I think this came out of Arizona versus\nRoberson. Merely repeating advice, when the right to\ncounsel has not been fulfilled, is not enough because\nthe person, over time, might lose hope of ever seeing an\nattorney, and, certainly, a prisoner has less means than\nsomeone on the street to hire an attorney.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He doesn't care whether he\ngets an attorney, so long as he doesn't have to talk to\ninvestigators. That's the issue, whether he must talk\nto these investigators, and he is told, right up-front,\nYou don't have to do it, and if -- if you want an\nattorney for it, we will get you an attorney.\nOtherwise, we -- we will terminate the interview.\nMS. DAVIS: But, if he has asked for an\nattorney in the past and, over two years and seven\nmonths, has never seen the right fulfilled, I think that\nthe -- that the pressure to cooperate with interrogators\nhas increased.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That is a -- isn't\nthat a Sixth Amendment question? That's not a Miranda\nquestion, if he has not been provided a lawyer.\nMS. DAVIS: Well, in this case, Chief\nJustice Roberts, the Sixth Amendment never attached\nbecause this suspect had never been charged.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. Right. And\nit's the Fifth Amendment we are worried about, and that\nis directed to coercion --\nMS. DAVIS: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- and that is\naddressed, if you stop questioning him. You don't even\nstart questioning him, if he says, Look, I don't want to\ntalk without a lawyer.\nMS. DAVIS: But I think --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Talking stopped, as\nit did the very -- the first time he was approached.\nMS. DAVIS: It did, but for a prisoner in\ncustody questioned about the same offense, the coercive\npressures that were present in Miranda are present for\nhim as well. That's why we think the core holding, the\ncore rationale, of Edwards applies very strongly in this\ncase.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why wouldn't he think, I\ninvoked my right to remain silent without a lawyer two\nyears and seven months ago, I will do it again; they\nwill have to stop questioning? Why wouldn't that be the\nmost likely mindset of the defendant? He knew that it\nworked the first time. Why should it not work the\nsecond time?\nMS. DAVIS: I think it's -- it's possible.\nBut in this case, where the right to counsel went\nunfulfilled for that period of time, a person might lose\nhope that that advice that he asked for help would ever\nbe fulfilled.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if he says -- I'm\nsorry --\nMS. DAVIS: Go ahead.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are you done\nanswering?\nSo if he said, instead of I want to talk to\na lawyer, if he said, I want to remain silent, your case\ncomes out differently? He doesn't say anything about a\nlawyer. He says, Look, I don't want to talk to you.\nMS. DAVIS: I think it would come out the\nsame way.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but all your\narguments about he hasn't been provided a lawyer, there\nis an ethical obligation to provide a lawyer. Those --\nthose are off the table.\nMS. DAVIS: Well, what's different is in\nthis Court, I think may be clear in Michigan v. Mosley:\nAsking for help from an attorney is materially different\nthan saying, I choose to remain silent. And the reason\nis a person who invokes the right to silence while\nquestioned in custody is in control and chooses to stop\nthe questioning.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He doesn't ask for an\nattorney. He just says, I don't want to talk without an\nattorney. That's what he says. He doesn't demand an\nattorney. He says, I don't want to talk without an\nattorney. And the investigators say, Okay, in that\ncase, we won't talk to you.\nMS. DAVIS: Well, and they treated it as a\nclear invocation of the right to counsel by documenting\nit in two places and putting that in the case file.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The right to counsel in the\ncourse of interrogation.\nMS. DAVIS: Yes. I -- I think what he said\nwas, \"I won't speak to you without an attorney,\" is the\nsame as asking for an attorney.\nJUSTICE ALITO: I can think of -- I can\nthink of at least one situation in which the Court has\nheld that there is a time limit in which something has\nto be done in order to comply with a Constitutional\nrequirement. If we were to choose a time period here,\nwhat would -- what would you propose?\nMS. DAVIS: Oh, anything over two years and\nseven months.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE ALITO: What would be --\nMS. DAVIS: That still doesn't solve the\nproblem.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What would be a serious --\nwhat would be a serious answer to that question?\nMS. DAVIS: We've argued that Edwards\ncontinues to the end, and the reason is --\nJUSTICE ALITO: All or nothing.\nMS. DAVIS: It's all or nothing, Justice\nAlito, because -- because this Court has already said in\nEdwards, We will allow the police to come back if the\nsuspect changes his or her mind or if an attorney is\npresent. And those two -- those two alternatives are\navailable every day and they are easy for the police to\nascertain.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Your adversary says that\nthey -- he can't change his mind. It has to be a\nspontaneous, you know, somehow they have to be in a room\ntogether that wasn't planned and he has to come up and\nsay, I am confessing out of the kindness of my heart.\nThe police can't even approach him, according to you,\nonce he has invoked counsel, to ask him whether he wants\nto change his mind.\nMS. DAVIS: That's right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's the point.\nMS. DAVIS: That is the badgering. That is\nthe specter of coercion that is inconsistent with the\nConstitutional right related to Miranda to have counsel\npresent. And that is the reason why --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So there is no\ntermination point, really?\nMS. DAVIS: It is not confined to time,\nJustice Sotomayor, but the termination point is,\nespecially for a prisoner, it's easy for the prisoner to\ncontact the police. Just tell the jail guard that you'd\nlike to talk to the police about that investigation.\nThey will make arrangements quickly for that to happen,\nI'm quite sure, or counsel could be present and\nquestioning can proceed in that instance, and those are\nthe reasons I would ask this Court to affirm the\njudgment of the Court of Appeals of Maryland.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMs. Davis.\nGeneral Gansler, you have two minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. DOUGLAS F. GANSLER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. GANSLER: In response to Justice\nBreyer's question, the ethics rules do not apply to the\npolice, only to lawyers, and I think Justice Scalia hit\nit right, exactly right, where this -- he's actually --\nin this case, he is not represented at all. He is in\ncustody because his case has been concluded.\nJUSTICE BREYER: My thought is, can you use\nthe rule for lawyers, which has worked, to help shape a\nrule that would work here?\nMR. GANSLER: Yes, and I will get to that in\none second. And I agree -- and that's exactly right.\nThe visitors in jail theory that Justice Stevens brought\nup: The defendant could say, \"I told them I don't want\nto talk to any visitors, no matter what. I don't want\nto talk to any visitors. They dragged me up there, made\nme go into this room and answer questions.\" Then you\nhave -- while Edwards, in our view, would have already\nbeen terminated, you have still the argument that my --\nmy Miranda warnings were not waived voluntarily and\nfreely, and moreover, I was denied due process.\nIn terms of the time limits of the cases, in\nThe State of Maine, Stafiali was six hours, and the\nfollowing day, Dunkins v. Thigpen in the Eleventh\nCircuit was the next day, following a break in custody.\nNow, those cases, the guy basically went home in those\nscenarios.\nThe confusion seems to be, in a lot of the\nquestions, regarding what is custody? We will not -- we\ndon't argue -- we are talking about interrogational\npolice custody, which is different than being in jail,\nlying on your cot, watching cable television. We --\nthis is -- in our scenario, the three days that now\nexist, whereas no one questions in the Roberson,\nMinnick, and Edwards cases, those three days were\npretrial police custody situations. There is no break\nin custody --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But -- but there was no\ndifference in those cases, as I understand it. Each of\nthe prisoners was in a particular room being questioned,\nand then he was released into a more general room later.\nMR. GANSLER: My understanding of this case\n--\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And brought back.\nMR. GANSLER: My understanding of this case,\nthey were in the -- sort of the box, as we call it, and\nthen they were put into a holding cell, a cell, and then\nbrought back to the box. Very different --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There is no difference\nbetween that and a holding cell, a maintenance room, and\nbeing put back into general prison to go sleep.\nMR. GANSLER: The latter -- the latter\nscenario is very different, because that's where they\nlive. That's their daily routine. Through no part of\nthe state, they are habitual offenders. They live in\nthe general population of a jail, in this case it is\nmedium security, not maximum security, and they were put\n-- there were people around. They have recess, they\nhave television, they have a cafeteria, and so forth.\nFinally, going to Justice Alito's question\nregarding the time limit, where you do it. This Court\nhas the County of Riverside -- obviously, there's\n48 hours from presentment is the time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\n"
