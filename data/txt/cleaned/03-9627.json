        "content": "(11:04 a.m.)\nJUSTICE STEVENS: We'll hear argument in Pace\nagainst the -- the warden.\nMr. Wycoff.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID WYCOFF\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. WYCOFF: Justice Stevens, and may it please\nthe Court:\nMr. Pace, at age 17, was sentenced to life\nwithout possibility of parole after being misled by his\nlawyer and the court.\nHis right to Federal habeas review depends\nentirely upon whether his State post-conviction\nproceedings tolled the AEDPA statute of limitations. This\nCourt should --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, he -- he had a prior\nround of hearings at the State level on these same claims,\ndid he not?\nMR. WYCOFF: On different claims, Your Honor.\nHe had a first, a -- under what was called the PCHA in\nPennsylvania. The tolling question here is whether the\nPCRA petition --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: I know, but the substance of\nit, saying it isn't fair to give me life without parole\nbecause of what happened, I didn't understand the plea --\nhe raised that in State court before.\nMR. WYCOFF: He raised it in the first\nproceeding an ineffective --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes.\nMR. WYCOFF: -- assistance of counsel claim --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes.\nMR. WYCOFF: -- related to that and some other\nclaims related to that --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Right.\nMR. WYCOFF: -- in the second proceeding.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: And he -- he essentially\nwants to relitigate the substance of those previous\nclaims.\nMR. WYCOFF: No, Your Honor. He actually -- the\nfirst petition raised only an ineffectiveness claim. The\nsecond petition raised a due process challenge to the\ncolloquy, which was not exhausted in the first, raised new\nevidence to support the claim which Pennsylvania law\nallowed him to do, and raised a constitutional and State\nlaw challenge to the legality of his sentence. There were\nnew claims in the second proceeding.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- of both claims was,\nhowever he dressed it up in -- in due process, that I\nwasn't told at the time of my sentencing that life meant\nlife without parole. That was the essence, the core of\nhis complaint the first time around, wasn't it?\nMR. WYCOFF: Yes, that his lawyer misled him was\nthe first claim, that by telling him he'd be out in 10 to\n15 years.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the -- but the essence of\nit was I wasn't told that life meant I would never get out\nof prison.\nMR. WYCOFF: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Both times.\nMR. WYCOFF: In -- in the second he raised that\nplus that the colloquy itself was defective and that the\nsentence, the life without parole sentence, was illegal\nand unconstitutional, apart from the misinformation\naspect. So they were different claims.\nLet me start with statutory tolling. Section\n2244(d)(2) of AEDPA provides tolling during properly filed\napplications for State post-conviction review. Under this\nCourt's unanimous decision in Artuz, Mr. Pace's PCRA\npetition was properly filed. In fact, the PCRA time bar\nfunctions in all material ways like the New York State\nprocedural bar rules at issue in Artuz.\nNow, Artuz also identified some types of rules\nthat would prevent an application from being properly\nfiled, for example, the AEDPA successive bar which makes\nyou go to the court of appeals first and get permission\nbefore you can actually file in the district court, and it\nhas a screening mechanism to make sure that only petitions\nwith a prima facie chance get filed.\nThe PCRA time bar is nothing like that at all.\nIt's like the State court procedural bar rules in Artuz.\nThere's no condition to filing. You can go and file at\nany time. The court, as a matter of law, has to take your\npetition, has to give it judicial review -- yes, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Wycoff, are you taking\nthe position that this -- that Artuz -- I thought,\nfrankly, that Artuz had classified within properly filed\ntimely filed and then had a footnote, and it says that\nthere might be some exceptions to a timely filing rule --\nMR. WYCOFF: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- rule. And they're not\ntaking a position about that. But you quickly said this\ntime limitation falls under the procedural bar label.\nMR. WYCOFF: I'm sorry, Your Honor. Yes. This\n-- Artuz said that a time limit without exception, say, in\n30 days you must file in 30 days, no exception, or in 1\nyear, no exceptions -- that's what Artuz called a\ncondition to filing and that you're either in or you're\nout in that rule.\nAnd Artuz, though, reserved the question\npresented here of whether a time bar with exceptions, like\nthe PCRA time bar -- whether that could be properly filed.\nAnd so obviously, Artuz reserved the exact question here.\nBut what -- the analysis of Artuz controls here and shows\nthat this petition was properly filed.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it depends on what the\nexceptions are. If -- if -- as -- here I understand there\nare three exceptions.\nMR. WYCOFF: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And they're all spelled out in\nthe statute.\nMR. WYCOFF: They're similar to the AEDPA\nexceptions.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. And -- and if you do not\nplead any of those exceptions when you -- when you file,\nit seems to me it's not properly filed.\nMR. WYCOFF: Well, there are a couple of\nresponses to that, Your Honor. First of all, in -- in\nterms of Mr. Pace, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has said\nit wasn't at all clear before, roughly, December of 1999\nthat you actually need to plead those exceptions in your\npetition. Now they say you should plead them in your\npetition, but at the time it wasn't clear. Certainly the\n-- the form that the prison provides --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't care what the\nPennsylvania law is. I mean, it -- it seems to me if you\nhave a statute that says it's untimely unless one of these\nthree exceptions apply, and -- and you -- you simply file\nand you don't say -- and it's clearly out of time without\none of the exceptions, and you simply file and don't say\nbut this exception applies, it seems to me that's not\nproperly filed, whatever the rule in -- in Pennsylvania\nwas.\nMR. WYCOFF: If -- in terms of -- to go to\nArtuz' analysis, you would have to look at each -- the\nexceptions are -- go claim by claim. You would have to\nlook at each claim and see did you plead the exception for\nthis claim, yes or no; this claim, yes or no. So again --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you haven't pleaded any of\nthem, none at all. You just file it --\nMR. WYCOFF: In that case --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- several years out of time.\nYou -- you make no assertion that any one of the -- of the\nthree specific exceptions applies. I don't see how that\ncould possibly be considered properly filed.\nMR. WYCOFF: Because the court still accepts it,\nreviews it to see if any of the exceptions apply.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Ah, that -- that's your theory\nthat -- that --\nMR. WYCOFF: And -- I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Unless it can be rejected by\nthe clerk --\nMR. WYCOFF: Not at all, Your Honor. It's not\nthat -- that theory at all. In -- in Pennsylvania, the\ncourt accepts it and gives it judicial review and reviews\nit claim by claim to see if any of the exceptions apply.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you haven't made the claim.\nMR. WYCOFF: Well, that's what the court would\ndetermine. And presumably in a case like that, the court\nwould be able to dispose of it quickly and --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what does the\nPennsylvania court -- law now say with respect to claim-\nby-claim pleading of the exceptions?\nMR. WYCOFF: The Pennsylvania Supreme Court now\nhas said you should plead in the PCRA petition the\nexceptions.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Claim by claim?\nMR. WYCOFF: For each -- any claim that you're\nraising, yes. It goes claim by claim.\nJUSTICE BREYER: This problem couldn't arise\nagain in Pennsylvania, couldn't it, because they have a 1-\nyear statute of limitations? So there would be no way\nthat you could be untimely filing within the 1 year that\nyou have to go to Federal court.\nMR. WYCOFF: It -- it can arise again, Your\nHonor, and that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It can? How could it --\nMR. WYCOFF: Yes, it can arise again and -- and\nwill many times arise again because consider someone who's\nalready had his or her AEDPA year pass and then discovers,\nsay, a Brady claim and wants to go back and litigate that.\nUnder AEDPA, you would have a year to get back into court\nwith that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You do. I thought AEDPA you\nhad to file within a year.\nMR. WYCOFF: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And then if you miss the year,\nyou're out of luck. Period.\nMR. WYCOFF: That's -- yes, but under State law,\nyou only have 60 days to get that. So someone in\nPennsylvania who finds a Brady claim, say, has to get back\ninto State court within 60 days of discovering that. So\nhis -- he -- he could go into State court --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I see. So in other words, he\n-- his conviction is final.\nMR. WYCOFF: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: 60 days runs after his final\nconviction and then between the 60th day and the 365th\nday, he has discovered his Brady claim and has not got\ninto court within 60 days.\nMR. WYCOFF: Or he finds it in what he thinks is\nwithin 60 days of when he should have found it. He files\nhis State post-conviction application. After years of\nlitigation, the court says, you know, you really should\nhave found it 59 days ago, not 60.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And Justice Scalia's question\n-- I'm interested in this. It couldn't arise. That is, a\nperson who files his State collateral petition more than\n365 days after the finality of the State court direct\nreview, that person is out of luck under anybody's\ninterpretation because more than a year has passed since\nit became final, i.e., the State direct review. Am I\nright or wrong about that? That's what's puzzling me.\nMR. WYCOFF: It -- it depends on if there's a\nnew -- if -- if there has not been a new triggering date,\nother than the finality for the AEDPA date, then you will\nbe out of time for AEDPA.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But AEDPA -- it doesn't say 1\nyear and that's it. AEDPA has exceptions.\nMR. WYCOFF: Yes, it does, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The exemptions still could be\nthe problem.\nMR. WYCOFF: Yes. And in fact, everyone now who\nhas, say, a Brady claim is going to have -- under Third\nCircuit law as it is now, is going to have to come into\nFederal court and file a protective habeas petition\nbecause the odds are very likely that more than a -- the\nAEDPA year is going to run while they litigate this.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. We would have to breathe\nlife back into the stay and abey --\nMR. WYCOFF: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But let me ask you this.\nReturning to our earlier discussion about pleading a\nspecific exemption --\nMR. WYCOFF: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- are there States, do you\nknow, where that is not required and the State court will\ngo through the exceptions even if you haven't pled them?\nMR. WYCOFF: Well, Pennsylvania actually does\nthat and certainly did it at the time Mr. Pace was\nlitigating.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but I thought you said\nPennsylvania law had changed now.\nMR. WYCOFF: They have said now you should plead\nthem at the petition -- in the petition.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But my -- my question is do\nyou know if there are other States where they say, we\ndon't care if you plead these --\nMR. WYCOFF: I --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- exemptions specifically or\nnot? We're going to look through it and find it for\nourselves.\nMR. WYCOFF: I -- I don't know the answer to\nthat. I know that was the practice. In -- in fact,\nPennsylvania courts still do that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you say that if that's the\ncase, you can file a -- a State -- a State claim that is\nplainly no good and until the State court finally gets\naround to -- to telling you that it's no good, your --\nyour AEDPA claim is tolled.\nMR. WYCOFF: Yes, while you're -- and the State\ncould easily prevent that by setting up some kind of\nprefiling requirement for --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's, in -- in effect,\nsaying that there is no -- that the properly filed, given\nthe Pennsylvania procedure, does not include timely filed.\nMR. WYCOFF: The -- the question of whether it\nwas timely or not is not actually determined until the end\nof the litigation.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But -- but you have just said\nthat the -- the court will look on its own to see if there\nare these exceptions.\nMR. WYCOFF: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So that there would be no\ncase of an untimely filing in this period when the court\nwas -- even if you raised no exception, was going through\nthem.\nMR. WYCOFF: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There would be no case in\nwhich an untimely filing would be included in properly\nfiled because the very fact that the court itself would go\nthrough the petition to look for exceptions would take it\nout of the category.\nMR. WYCOFF: Yes, Your Honor, and exactly the\nsame could be said about Artuz, the procedural bar rules\nin Artuz, whether someone pled --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the -- the difference was\nthat Artuz ranked timely filing as an ingredient of\nproperly filed, and you say but not in Pennsylvania the\nway it's set up. Timely filing is not an ingredient of\nproperly filed.\nMR. WYCOFF: Because the State court lets you\nfile it and gives it judicial review and applies it claim\nby claim.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But don't -- don't you have a\n-- a -- sort of a second prong to -- to your response?\nAnd I -- I wanted to get into this. You -- you have said\nPennsylvania will let you file even though ultimately it,\nyou know, may well determine that you -- you were out of\ntime and you don't fall within any of the exceptions.\nWell, that's -- that's an answer. I'm not sure it's a\nstrong enough answer to respond to Artuz.\nBut I thought you had a second part to the\nanswer, and I thought your second part to the answer was\nin that kind of situation, the Third Circuit practice, the\nThird Circuit rule is that unless we go through the\nPennsylvania process, even if we know from day one that\nwe're out of time, we think we have a -- an excuse, but\neven though we -- we think from day one we're out of time,\nunless we exhaust the Pennsylvania process, they will\nthrow us out for nonexhaustion. And the reason they will\nthrow us out from nonexhaustion, as opposed to going\ndirectly to the question whether there is an excuse for\nnonexhaustion, is because Pennsylvania will actually let\nus litigate this --\nMR. WYCOFF: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- and not determine it as a\nthreshold matter.\nSo -- so your answer, as I understand it, is\nPennsylvania let's you litigate it, and the Third Circuit\nrequires you to litigate it so that the only reasonable\nthing for us to do is to litigate it even if you may say\nin the abstract it's a purely threshold time question.\nAnd for that reason, there should be tolling. Isn't that\nyour argument?\nMR. WYCOFF: Yes, Your Honor. And it's -- it's\nconnected to the statutory language. AEDPA says we'll\ntoll for properly filed applications. That -- AEDPA is\nkeyed to how much process the State post-conviction courts\nwill give you. In a -- in a State where they say anyone\nwho comes after a year, we won't give you any review and\nyou're just out of court, AEDPA says when -- that's not --\nwe're not going to consider that properly filed. We won't\ntoll, but --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This is putting such a -- I\nmean, the system is not going to work. It -- it's a rare\nState system that has an absolute statute of limitation\nwith no exceptions. You're almost going to have to\ninquire into exceptions. So you're saying this is a way\nto avoid -- avoid AEDPA endlessly, just keep filing claims\nthat are out of time, and until the court finally gets\naround to saying it's out of time, your -- your AEDPA time\nis tolled --\nMR. WYCOFF: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- by which time you file\nanother one that's clearly out of time. And until that\none is resolved -- I -- this couldn't be what AEDPA was --\nwas meant to establish.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and if you're tempted\nto answer, well, people want to get out so they're not\ngoing to sit around forever, then we'd ask you what about\nthe death cases.\nMR. WYCOFF: Okay, and that was what I was\ntempted to answer, and since you said it, I'll go straight\nto the death cases.\nIn Pennsylvania, certainly there's no -- a\ndeath-sentence prisoner can get nowhere by filing what he\nknows to be an untimely PCRA petition because Pennsylvania\nlaw requires the Governor to sign warrants when the\nconviction is final and then at every break in the\nlitigation basically after that. And the PCRA courts\ncannot grant a stay of execution until after they find\nthat the petition is both timely and meritorious. So it's\nnot --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm not sure that would apply\nto other States.\nMR. WYCOFF: That's true. And I mean, each\nState can set up a system to -- to satisfy its needs.\nPennsylvania could set up a system like the AEDPA\nsuccessor bar to say you're not going to be filed at all\nuntil we give you permission.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Under your rule that filing is\nsufficient, are there any instances of -- of frivolous\npetition where your rule would not apply?\nMR. WYCOFF: Well, I think all the courts of\nappeal that have -- have talked about that have thought --\nhave said that you really shouldn't start figuring out\nwhether it was a frivolous assertion or meritorious --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then Justice Scalia's\nprediction is -- is right. You just keep filing and\nfiling.\nMR. WYCOFF: Presumably you could and if there's\nsomeone who wants to do that, which is going to be a\nrare --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose you lost on that one.\nSuppose that you wanted some kind of a -- suppose that the\nmajority wanted a standard that would prevent absolutely\nfrivolous filings on the basis of -- of statute of\nlimitations. Would you -- what standard would -- what --\nwhat's our choice of standards there? Could we -- one,\nobviously, that the prisoner has to be in good faith.\nAnother could be he has to be in good faith and there has\nto be a reasonable argument that it hasn't run. Maybe\nthere are others that you've thought of.\nMR. WYCOFF: I think that going down that path\nis going to open up just a nightmare of -- of litigation\nin Federal court about -- if you start talking about good\nfaith and are you -- if the State courts deny it, can you\nstill say it was nonfrivolous? I think all the courts\njust across the board have tried to avoid that type of\nthing.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Try -- try this simple rule.\nWhere you're dealing with a statute of limitations that\nhas exceptions, it's not properly filed if you do not\nassert the existence of one of those exceptions.\nMR. WYCOFF: Two -- I have two things to say\nabout that. One is it creates a problem with Artuz\nbecause that type of rule -- assuming the exceptions are\nlike the PCRA exceptions which go claim by claim, that's a\nclaim-by-claim rule which would then create the anomaly\nthat Artuz shied away from, that you look to whether it\nwas a properly filed application, not to whether it was an\napplication with properly filed claims.\nThe second point is that -- is that for Mr.\nPace, whatever the merits of that rule may be going\nforward, it -- it can't be used against Mr. Pace because\nthere was no such requirement in Pennsylvania. I mean,\npresumably the -- I assume the Federal courts are not\ngoing to make up this rule, that it's going to be up to\nthe State courts to say what their filing --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why not? We make up a\nlot of stuff.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. WYCOFF: Well, Artuz talks about you look to\nthe State's procedural filing requirements. This is a\nFederal statute and properly filed is given a Federal\nmeaning, but you presumably look to the State filing\nrequirements, as you did in Artuz, to determine what that\nmeans.\nNow, all of these concerns about delay and so on\nare the exact same concerns, where there in Artuz someone\ncould file successive petition after successive petition\nin New York if they want to delay. It's just not -- it's\nnot a -- it's certainly not a problem for noncapital\ncases.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought the whole purpose of\nAEDPA was -- was to prevent delay. I mean, that's --\nthat's what's -- it seems to me counter-intuitive about\nthe position you're -- you're urging upon us. Here is a\nstatute that was meant to stop these things from dragging\non endlessly.\nMR. WYCOFF: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you tell us don't worry\nabout these things dragging on endlessly.\nMR. WYCOFF: I'm not -- I'm saying AEDPA says\ncome to Federal court within a year. We'll toll when\nyou're in State court if it's properly filed. Properly\nfiled, if the States let you file a lot of stuff, we're\ngoing to -- comity requires to allow that, and we'll toll.\nIf the States don't --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's unrealistic if the\nStates allow you to file a lot of stuff. You're -- you're\nsaying the only way the States can stop this thing from\ngoing on and on and on is to adopt an absolute rigid\nstatute of limitations, no exceptions.\nMR. WYCOFF: That's one way or a prefiling\nrequirement.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Give me another way.\nMR. WYCOFF: The AEDPA prefiling requirement\nwhere you go to the court and you say, I'd like to file\nthis petition, tell me if I can, and the court says, 30\ndays later, yes or no. That's --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Oh, but if it takes a year a\nlater, then we --\nMR. WYCOFF: Well, yes. If -- the AEDPA --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Then you just repeat the\nprocess one step backward.\nMR. WYCOFF: No, Your Honor. I think the courts\nare -- are -- the Federal courts are capable of telling\nthe difference between an application for State post-\nconviction relief on the one hand and a motion for leave\nto file an application on the other hand. In fact, the\nSeventh Circuit in -- in the Smith v. Walls case and the\nTinker v. Ward case that we cited in our brief had exactly\nthat distinction between an Indiana rule which had a\nprefiling requirement and an Illinois rule --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What about a -- a rule\nrequiring good faith or reasonable argument in death\ncases? In all the other cases, there's no incentive to do\nthis endless filing, and in death cases, there is. So in\nthose death cases, we would insist that it is not properly\nfiled if it's out of time unless the prisoner in good\nfaith and with a plausible argument, a reasonable argument\nthought it was in time.\nMR. WYCOFF: I suppose that -- I mean, that\ncould be a construction of the statute as long as you let\npeople -- people are going to come to Federal court first\nand get -- for stay abeyance if you do that. If you don't\nknow until the outcome years later whether you were\ntolling or not, that's going to cause everyone to file\nprotective filings.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think that's a\nreasonable interpretation of properly filed and -- and\nwhat I proposed to you is not a reasonable interpretation\nof properly filed?\nMR. WYCOFF: Well, I was just --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How can you -- how can you\ntease that elaborate system out of -- out of the words\nproperly filed but you cannot tease out of it --\nMR. WYCOFF: The --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- simply showing on its face\nthat there's either an absolute statute or that one of the\nexceptions to the statute exists?\nMR. WYCOFF: The problem with that in terms --\nis that it conflicts with Artuz' idea that the -- any rule\nthat's a condition to filing has to go to the application\nas a whole.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I don't think it actually\n-- I mean, in -- I think they're about equal, aren't they,\nin respect to language? And the argument against the\nother one is that prisoners are going to get mixed up\nabout it. They -- they don't know exactly what they're\nsupposed to put. The argument against the one I proposed\nis it adds complexity of decision-making. Sort of between\nthe two, it's rather hard to see.\nMR. WYCOFF: Just --\nJUSTICE BREYER: They each have their problems.\nMR. WYCOFF: Just in terms of -- of policy, I\nthink any rule you adopt that's not mechanical and doesn't\nlet people know on the front end whether they're tolling\nor not, there's going to be floods of protective filings.\nNow, the -- the rule like -- a rule which is --\nwhich -- where they know going in and whether they're\ngoing to be tolled or not, then they can say plead --\nlitigate in State court becoming -- before coming to\nFederal court. And Duncan v. Walker was very clear that\nthe court doesn't want lots of people filing prematurely.\nIf I could, I'd like to turn to equitable\ntolling.\nAs Chief District Judge Giles found, that it\nwould be an extraordinary deprivation of rights and\npatently unfair to deny tolling in Federal review here, he\nfound -- Judge Giles found that if Mr. Pace had filed a\nFederal habeas petition instead of his PCRA petition,\nJudge Giles would have dismissed it and required him to do\nexactly what he did, which is to seek State remedies under\nthe PCRA. As Judge Giles found, Mr. Pace acted diligently\nand appropriately under the circumstances.\nIt seems this is a clear case for equitable\ntolling. This is a case where --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The circumstances included the\nfact that he sat on this thing for 3 years. He could have\nbrought it 3 years earlier, couldn't he?\nMR. WYCOFF: You're talking about the time from\nthe first PCRA --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The claim, yes, that's right.\nMR. WYCOFF: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So -- when -- when you -- when\nyou fold that into the circumstances, it doesn't seem to\nme an overwhelming case for equitable tolling.\nMR. WYCOFF: I have, I think, four responses to\nthat.\nFirst, Mr. Pace was not sitting on his hands for\nthese 4 years. This is a man who entered prison at age\n17, barely educated, barely literate, drug-addled. This\nis not someone who was prepared to litigate on his own\nwhen he came into prison. This is someone who -- whose\nlegal papers were destroyed by the prison. This is\nsomeone who was without counsel for that entire time that\nyou're talking about. This is someone who had very\nlimited access to a law library throughout that time. Mr.\nPace spent those years teaching himself how to do law\nwhich he --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- take a whole lot to figure\nout that you have a claim where your lawyer told you --\nyou weren't going up for life and it turned out you were\nsent up for life.\nMR. WYCOFF: In fact --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, what does it take if --\ncan a 17-year-old figure that something has gone wrong\nhere?\nMR. WYCOFF: Well, in fact, that -- that claim\nwas litigated -- litigated in the first petition, and in\nfact, he didn't think of that. If you look at his pro se\nPCHA petition, he didn't know that was a claim. It's a --\nit's a form that he filled out and handed in and appointed\ncounsel came up with that claim in the first post-\nconviction proceeding.\nThis is much more complex than that. If you\nlook at his briefs, which are in the joint appendix,\nPennsylvania had a very complex system of law here where\nthey had statutory bar rules but they had judicial\nexceptions to those rules. And it's not an easy matter\nfor someone to figure that out.\nMr. Pace educated himself. Just compare the pro\nse pleading filed in 1992 to what he filed in 1996, and\nyou can see what he did during these 4 years.\nThe other -- the other -- just -- my light is\non, but just the other things I'd like to mention about\nthat are that keep in mind, during this time there were no\ntime limits on filing in either State or Federal court.\nThe commonwealth has never alleged any prejudice from this\ntime, and there's never been any allegation that Mr. Pace\nacted in bad faith and with any -- any intent to delay.\nIn fact, this is someone who wanted to get his claims\nheard, wanted to figure out how to do it right, and did\nfigure out how to do it right in the end.\nI would like to reserve the rest of my time.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You may.\nMR. WYCOFF: Thank you.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Eisenberg.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD EISENBERG\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. EISENBERG: Justice Stevens, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI'd like to address the structure of the\nPennsylvania filing deadlines for post-conviction review\nbecause I think they shed some light and need some\ndiscussion here.\nWhat Pennsylvania did was to establish a 1-\nyear, flat time limit that applies to everybody. 1 year\nfrom conviction. It's automatic. It doesn't matter what\nthe nature of your claims are. It doesn't matter when you\ndiscovered your claim. In order to comply with that time\nlimit, all you have to do is file a post-conviction\npetition within 1 year of finality.\nThe rest of the statute is essentially a\nseparate set of filing deadlines for petitioners, for\nsuccessive petitioners, for people who either have already\nhad one round of post-conviction review or who haven't\nbothered to pursue it. Those people, said the\nlegislature, are only going to be entitled to further\npost-conviction review, to additional rounds of post-\nconviction review if they fall into a particular class of\nclaim that couldn't have been raised earlier. And -- and\nthe legislature identified three classes that mirror the\nthree provisions in the Federal statute of limitations.\nAnd if the petitioner falls within any of those classes,\nhe then has 60 days from the time that that claim arose in\norder to come into court.\nNow, if a petitioner files a post-conviction\npetition and he's within a year of finality, those so-\ncalled exceptions don't come into play. They don't apply.\nHe doesn't need to meet them. Those are for the second\npetitioner.\nSo what Pennsylvania really has is a two-level\nsystem of statutes of -- of filing limitations. And of\ncourse, in order for the court to determine whether the\npetitioner has met the filing deadline, he has to look at\nthese three classes for someone who has passed 1 year from\nfinality. That's not an exception in the way I think that\nthe petitioner and some of the lower courts have used the\nterm at all. These are simply different kinds of filing\nlimits. And of course, the court has to look at the\nstatute and the nature of the claims to see whether review\nis available and to see whether the petitioner has sought\nreview within the proper time.\nNothing about that system makes those so-called\nexceptions not time limits. They're still time limits,\nand if you don't file in time and come within one of those\nclasses, then the second petition, successive petition\ntime limits don't apply to you and you're out of time.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but if we accept your\nposition, it seems to me that State prisoners are going\nto have to go but once to Federal court and then they're\n-- they're going to run into an exhaustion requirement.\nMR. EISENBERG: Well, they're not going to run\ninto an exhaustion requirement, Your Honor, because if\nthey've already been through one round of State post-\nconviction review, then they are unlikely to be able to\nexhaust more claims because there's a -- there's a --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, we're --\nMR. EISENBERG: -- 1-year time limit.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- we're assuming a late-\ndiscovered claim that's within AEDPA.\nMR. EISENBERG: That's right. And so the\nquestion is whether -- and what petitioner is really\nsaying is that the AEDPA 1-year time limit should be\nsuspended essentially indefinitely as long as the\npetitioner wants to argue that he may have some late-\ndiscovered claim in State court.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It -- it's my -- I still have a\nfeeling that this is a limited universe. Now, my reason\nfor thinking that is that the Federal statute says you\nhave to file within a year of -- and then it lists four\ndates. And the middle two are special new cases, unusual\nprobably. The first one and the fourth one are the\nimportant ones. The first one is final in the State\ncourts, your first round, and the fourth one is newly\ndiscovered evidence.\nNow, my guess is most States also allow you for\ncollateral -- to file collateral relief in those two\ncircumstances. And in most States probably you get nearly\na year from the same kind of event. So if you go after\nthe year, you're out of luck in Federal court. If you're\nwithin the year, you're probably okay for the State. But\nthere are a few States that have -- maybe Pennsylvania --\njust 60 days from one of the events, newly discovered\nevidence, but a year for the Federal. So we're talking\nabout people who file between 2 and 12 months. That --\nthat must be a pretty limited class.\nMR. EISENBERG: It's -- it's not, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's not?\nMR. EISENBERG: And -- and the reason that it's\nnot --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But have I got it right? Have\nI got this complicated thing right?\nMR. EISENBERG: Only -- it's -- that is true\nonly for successive petitioners. For people who aren't\nsatisfied with the round of direct appeal and a round of\nfirst -- of post-conviction review in State court. And so\nthe question is whether the Federal statute should be\ninterpreted in a way that essentially writes off the\nState's time requirements for the successive petitioner so\nthat we can make sure that the successive petitioner can\nexhaust whatever new claims he wants to come up with in\nState court before he comes to Federal Circuit.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, let's --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What do I do it in a State\nwhere there is a plausible close question of whether or\nnot the successive petition is barred in the State court?\nAnd I interrupted Justice Breyer, but I -- I think it's\nalong the same line.\nMR. EISENBERG: The -- the general rule -- and\nthis is implicit I think in the fact that Congress passed\na statute of limitations. The general rule is that the\npetitioner is entitled to whatever he automatically gets\nin State court in order to exhaust a universe of claims,\nnot all possible claims, but whatever claims can be\nexhausted within those guaranteed rounds of review. At\nthat point, he should go to Federal court.\nIf new claims arise after that, then Congress\nspecifically provided for them in the second and\nsuccessive petition procedure that it has in the Federal\nstatute.\nThe way that would interact --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But no -- there's still an\nexhaustion requirement.\nMR. EISENBERG: The way that would interact with\n-- for exhaustion purposes with a State like Pennsylvania\nis this. The petitioner finishes his direct review. He\nfinishes his post-conviction review. He has a set of\nclearly exhausted claims. He files a fully exhausted\npetition in Federal court. No Rose v. Lundy problem. If\na new claim arises at that point, then he has to go to\nState court and try to exhaust that claim in State court.\nHe can do that while a Federal petition is pending or even\nafter a first Federal petition has already been disposed\nof. In fact, he may have to because the claim may not\narise before the end of litigation in Federal court.\nWhen he gets to State court, he's either going\nto be deemed timely or not. Actually the fact that we\nhave a 60-day time limit as opposed to a whole year helps\nhim because it helps make it clear to him that he's got to\ncome to State court at a point where he's really got a\nlong time left to deal with Federal court because he's\ngoing to --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But isn't there a wrinkle to\nthis? Isn't the wrinkle that even in cases in which you\nand I might say patently he's going to be out of time if\nhe goes back to Federal court, the Third Circuit is\nrequiring him to go there anyway, go through the formality\nof formal exhaustion, if you will, before they'll consider\nit? And isn't that a basis at least for equitable\ntolling?\nMR. EISENBERG: With respect to your argument,\nthe answer is absolutely not. First of all, as you have\njust observed, that's really an argument that goes to\nequitable tolling. Even petitioner doesn't bring in the\nThird Circuit law with respect to statutory tolling,\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Right.\nMR> EISENBERG: with respect to understanding\nthe -- the language of the statute.\nAs to equitable tolling, however, the factual\npremise is wrong. It's not true that the Third Circuit\nforces the defendant to go back to State court no matter\nwhat. In fact --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. Help me -- help me out\nhere because I -- I just don't remember well enough. I\nthought that's what Judge Giles was getting at when he\nsaid, you know, he would have been thrown if he hadn't\ngone through the State procedure. So help me out. Is\nthat what he was getting at or not?\nMR. EISENBERG: That is what he was getting at\nbut at a limited point in time, and the whole question for\nequitable tolling purposes was at what point in time.\nNobody argues that the Third Circuit still is making\neverybody go back and do it no matter what.\nWhat the petitioner argued was that the Third\nCircuit case law, as of 1997 when he was first starting\nhis second round of post-conviction review in State court,\nas of that time, he says, the Third Circuit case law said\nyou have to go back no matter what even though\nPennsylvania has a -- this new statute of limitations.\nThat's not what the Third Circuit says, though.\nAnd all the cases that the petitioner relies on primarily\n-- he cites a -- a case called Doctor, a case called\nBanks, a case called Lambert. All of those cases were\ndecided before the Pennsylvania courts began applying the\nnew jurisdictional time bar in State court.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If that means the petitioner\nwas wrong, doesn't it also mean that Judge Giles is wrong,\nand if Judge Giles can't figure it out, isn't there a\npretty good argument that the petitioner ought to get\nequitable tolling?\nMR. EISENBERG: Well, there are a number of\nproblems with the equitable tolling, Your Honor. But even\ntaking that main one, that the petitioner made a mistake\nof law, that he didn't figure out correctly whether he was\nsupposed to go back to State court, even on that point,\nYour Honor, that's not grounds for equitable tolling. You\ntake a risk when you make a legal argument that it will\nfail. This legal argument was controlled entirely by\nState law, and what the Third Circuit, as opposed to Judge\nGiles who was reversed by the Third Circuit said, is that\nyou have to look back to State law.\nWhat the Third Circuit has said -- and the --\none of the cases cited in our brief at page 49 is Walker\nv. Frank. Chief Judge Becker said no, we're not going to\ngive equitable tolling to these defendants because at the\nvery latest -- at the very latest -- they had to know by\nDecember of 1997 that they were going to be time-barred in\nState court. This petitioner filed --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But -- but Judge Giles didn't\nunderstand it either.\nMR. EISENBERG: Judge Giles didn't say that --\nthat the State law would never in the future be applied to\nthese defendants. He said at this early time it was still\nunclear whether it would be applied.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So far as this case is\nconcerned, yes. And -- and so if Judge Giles got it\nwrong, isn't there a pretty good argument for equitable\ntolling when the petitioner gets it wrong?\nMR. EISENBERG: What there is is an argument\nthat he had an argument to make in Federal court that he\nwas not -- that he was still going to have the opportunity\nto go back to State court.\nBut the problem is that Federal courts can't\ndecide for the States how their time bars are going to be\napplied. And if instead they said --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But -- but this argument is not\ntrying to decide for the States. This argument basically\nis if nobody can figure it out, including a Federal\ndistrict judge, at least give me the benefit of the doubt\nwith equitable tolling.\nMR. EISENBERG: It's not true that nobody could\nfigure it out, Your Honor. In fact, all the cases that\nthe petitioner cites in his brief from Federal district\ncourt judges who were sending defendants back to State\ncourt during this period because they said, well, maybe\nyou'll get exhaustion anyway, maybe you'll be able to\nexhaust claims, of those cases that are cited in the\nbrief, most of them are from the same one judge who kept\nsaying the same thing over and over. Several of the other\ncases didn't even talk about the State time bar, and at\nthat same period of time, there were other district judges\nwho weren't sending defendants back, who were saying\nthere's a new State time bar, you're barred in State\ncourt, and therefore, if you want to raise this claim in\nFederal court, you can, but you face procedural default.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But if he had gone into the\nFederal court he went into, and he had not gone through\nthis State procedure, he would have been turfed out.\nMR. EISENBERG: You can't get equitable tolling,\nYour Honor, our position would be --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, answer that question --\nMR. EISENBERG: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- before you tell me what the\nconsequence is.\nMR. EISENBERG: No. That's what Judge Giles\nsaid many years after the fact. Do we know that's what\nJudge Giles would have ruled at the time? Perhaps. But\nthere are other judges, Federal judges, who were ruling\notherwise at the time, and the Third Circuit --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I mean, don't -- don't we\nhave to take Judge Giles' statement as being a statement\nin good faith unless there is a pretty darned good reason\nnot to?\nMR. EISENBERG: The point is, Your Honor, that\nthat's not the test for equitable tolling. There are all\nsorts of arguments that a defendant can make about why the\nlaw is unclear. It wouldn't have had to depend on the\nFederal court's understanding of this particular State\nlaw. A defendant could come along and he could say, well,\nI'm unclear about the application of (d)(2). I've got\ncircuits like the Ninth Circuit who tell me that even if\nmy petition is blatantly untimely in State court, it still\ntolls. I filed, knowing I was untimely in State court,\nbecause the Ninth Circuit tells me that I'm still going to\nget tolling, and now you tell me I'm not going to get\ntolling?\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Let's suppose to\nget away from it -- can I go -- are you finished with\nequitable tolling because I want to go back to --\nMR. EISENBERG: Well, I -- I have -- there are\nsome -- really some -- some threshold problems with\nequitable tolling that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I -- I have a general question\nwhich is not Pennsylvania. I've looked up or got a rough\nidea of the statute of limitations for a first petition in\nmany States, and most of them are a year or more. So\nthere's no problem. But 11 have less than a year, and in\nparticular, Oklahoma has 3 months apparently. And\nOklahoma is -- a lot of death cases come out of Oklahoma.\nSo what rule would -- where I have to have -- I focus on\nOklahoma for the reason that I think this has bite only in\ndeath cases because I don't see why anybody would want to\nabuse the system except in a death case. But there are a\nlot there.\nNow, am I supposed to say in Oklahoma which has\nthe 90 days but exceptions, that where somebody has filed\na petition in State court, let's say, on the 180th day,\nand he thinks an exception applies, is he supposed to also\nrun to Federal court and file a protective petition which\ncould well have been dismissed on exhaustion grounds?\nWhat's he supposed to do and how is he supposed to know\nwhat to do?\nAnd one system that might work is Justice\nScalia's idea.\nMR. EISENBERG: Well, it's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Another that might work is --\nis requiring in death cases that it be a -- a plausible\nground or something like that. I want to know your\nopinion of how to deal with that circumstance.\nMR. EISENBERG: It certainly shouldn't be a\nplausible ground test, and even the petitioner agrees with\nthat position, Your Honor.\nAnd it certainly would work if we adopted, as I\nthink Congress did, a system like the one that Justice\nScalia spelled out because then the defendant knows.\nAnd I'd like to get back, as I was discussing\nwith Justice Kennedy, to what the defendant knows. He\nknows that if he's outside the time that he's guaranteed\nautomatic review, whether direct appeal or State review,\nState post-conviction review, that his chances of\nexhausting more claims in State court --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Actually most prisoners are not\nrepresented, I don't think, at this stage. They -- they\nhaven't a clue about the word exhaustion, and they haven't\na clue about the statute of limitations. So they file a\n-- a paper in -- in the State court, and they say this\nroughly is what my problem is. Is that what happens, or\nare they all quite educated?\nMR. EISENBERG: Your Honor, the -- the Congress\nthat passed this statute of limitations is the same\nCongress that made the decision about whether habeas\npetitioners would be appointed counsel or not. So to say\nthat we can't really apply the statute of limitations\nbecause it would be unfair as to those petitioners who are\nunrepresented would be essentially to undercut the statute\nof limitations --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm trying to get from you what\nis your opinion of a practical approach to this problem in\nOklahoma, say.\nMR. EISENBERG: The practical approach to the\nproblem is to look at the statute that says you have a\nyear. If you file your petition within that year,\nwhatever you've got at the end of that year, you can take\nto Federal court and be confident that it's exhausted. If\nyou want to do something after that year, you can't be\nconfident anymore. All you have to do is -- is count a\nyear.\nNow, if something comes up after that time,\nyou're supposed to go to State court first, even if you've\ngot something in Federal court. This statute of\nlimitations isn't supposed to be interpreted in order to\nmake the Federal successive petitions standard moot and\nunnecessary. It exists for a reason. So if a -- if a\nclaim arises at a later point, after you have finished\nyour guaranteed review in State court, go back to State\ncourt, whether or not you've got something pending in\nFederal court. Don't put that new claim in with your old\nclaims in Federal court because then you have a mixed\npetition. If you get exhaustion in State court, whether\nyou're timely or untimely, you're going to exhaust. You\ncan then go back to Federal court with a request for a\nsuccessive petition. It -- that's what you have to do and\nthat's appropriate because that's how Congress set up the\nstatute, with the 1-year filing deadline and -- and a\nprovision for successive petitions.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask how you would handle\na case that is a successive petition, a late -- a recently\nfound claim, and the -- filed beyond the statute of\nlimitations but the State has three exceptions to the\nstatute, but it does not require that the -- the\npetitioner identify the exception in the petition? It\njust allows it for the judge to decide. Would there be\ntolling during the period in which the judge decided\nwhether or not the petition was timely in your view?\nMR. EISENBERG: No, Your Honor, because all the\ncourt is doing is deciding whether the time bar applies,\nand in order -- in a State that has those kind of\ncategories, what the court is, in effect, doing is\ndeciding what kind of time limit applies to this\nparticular petition.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And even if it takes a year or\nso to make that decision, you'd say no tolling.\nMR. EISENBERG: Your Honor, that's really true\nof every kind of statute of limitations issue that can\ncome up. Take away those three exceptions. Just have the\n1-year flat time bar. Does that mean that the State court\nisn't going to have to take some time to look at it and\ndecide? What if there's a prisoner mailbox question?\nWhat if there's an amendment question of the type that\nthis Court just granted cert on last month in Mayle v.\nFelix? What if there's a question about how to compute --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And in all of those questions,\nyou'd say there would be no tolling in order to find out\nwhether it was timely or not.\nMR. EISENBERG: That's right because during that\ntime, the State court is deciding on timeliness, and if\nit's untimely, it was untimely as of the point of filing.\nThat's what makes it a filing requirement. You take your\nclaim and you file it --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But what about the reasoning\nin Artuz that the application was -- if it turns out later\nit was timely, it would have been properly filed?\nMR. EISENBERG: I'm sorry. I -- I think I\nunderstand Artuz to have said that if the application was\nuntimely, then it was not properly filed and it was not\nproperly filed from the get-go, Your Honor.\nThe question that was reserved in Artuz is\nwhether something about exceptions changes that statement\nin Artuz. And my response is that certainly nothing about\nthe kind of exceptions that were present in this case\nchanged the response.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, but if I understand you\ncorrectly, you're saying that even if it takes the judge 6\nmonths to decide whether it was timely, if he ends up with\nthe conclusion that it was not timely, there would be no\ntolling for that 6-month period.\nMR. EISENBERG: That's correct, Your Honor.\nNow, in Pennsylvania, of course, all you have to\ndo to be timely is file within the 1 year. And whatever\nyou've exhausted is done.\nThat -- I'd like to go from that into expanding\nmore on the equitable tolling because I think that that\nplays in here. This defendant had two rounds. The first\nround was 4 years, not even just 3, but I believe closer\nto 4 years before there was a filing deadline in either\nState court or Federal court. Now, when you decide to\nwait -- he didn't have a filing deadline, but when you\ndecide to wait, you take your chances. There's a rule\nthat's even more immutable than time limits or\njurisdiction, and it is that things change. When you\nwait, you take the risk that your evidence may change, the\nfacts may change, the law may change. That's what\nhappened to this defendant while he sat and did nothing.\nHe says he was learning the law during that\nperiod. Well, then would it -- is it just 4 years? What\nif it had taken him 8 years or 12 years to learn the law?\nHe had the filing deadline that came up. He never claimed\nthat he didn't understand what it was. He could have\nbeaten any of those filing deadlines in State or Federal\ncourt. He says, I have no incentive for delay. I'm not a\ncapital defendant. All I wanted was a speedy resolution\nof my claims. But in that case, he didn't need a filing\ndeadline to make himself come to court.\nThe fact is that there are thousands of cases in\nwhich noncapital defendants file these kinds of late\npetitions, and the State courts are trying to deal with\nthem. And this is the way that Pennsylvania chose to try\nto deal with the problem in State court, in its State\ncourts, not just for capital cases, but for noncapital\ncases.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why are there thousands\nof cases in which noncapital defendants file this type of\ncase? What -- what incentives do noncapital defendants\nhave to drag it on?\nMR. EISENBERG: The incentive that they have to\ndrag it on is that they may come up with a new legal\ntheory that attracts a -- a court that they didn't present\nbefore, that new facts may come up, may arise that they\ntry to argue. That's what this defendant did, although\nthey weren't really new. They were facts that were\navailable to him as of the -- the day of his guilty plea\nin 1986. He claimed that they were new. And if there's\nno cost to doing that, if in fact there may be a benefit\nto doing that, then why not? If --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems -- it seems intuitive\nalso that the prosecution's witnesses will be difficult to\nlocate and so forth. Has -- has there been anything\nwritten about that, about prejudice to the prosecution\nfrom -- from delay, or is it just something we --\nMR. EISENBERG: Well, it's certainly something\nthat --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- we take judicial notice of?\nMR. EISENBERG: It's certainly something that\nany prosecutor would tell you, Your Honor.\nThis -- this crime occurred 20 years ago in\n1985. And this was a relatively simple case. A police\nofficer came on to the scene while the defendant was\nbashing the head of the victim with a nightstick. But\neven in a simple case, you're going to have problems of\nproof, and the party with the primary problems of proof is\nthe party with the burden of proof, and that's the\nprosecution. So, of course, there's going to be a problem\nfor the prosecution, and that's why we adopt -- one of the\nreasons that we adopt this kind time limit.\nEven once the petitioner did come back to State\ncourt, though, Your Honor -- and this gets back to the\nquestions that Justice O'Connor was raising initially --\nhe raised essentially the same claims. He says, well,\nthis time around, I put them in a different guise,\ndifferent facts in support of my claim about my guilty\nplea, different legal labels. Yes, but all in the context\nof -- of ineffective assistance because the only way he\ncould get into court a second time for a second round of\npost-conviction review in Pennsylvania was to say that my\nlawyer at my first round of State post-conviction review\nwas ineffective. He didn't attach these affidavits from\nmy mother and father. He didn't call it due process\ninstead of whatever else he called it.\nNow, petitioner could make those --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, he also raised an -- an\nentirely different claim, didn't he? I mean, it goes to\nultimately the same point, but he raised the claim that\nthe court had not engaged in an adequate colloquy --\nMR. EISENBERG: The reason the colloquy wasn't\nadequate is precisely for the same reason that he was\nattacking his lawyers, in the petitioner's view, that it\ndidn't explain to him the meaning of a life sentence.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Right. But that -- the -- I\nmean, it's a different claim. The judge has an\nindependent responsibility. It's not the lawyer's\nresponsibility.\nMR. EISENBERG: Your Honor, that's a claim that\nwas waived if it was not presented in the first --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That -- that may be, but it is\na different claim.\nMR. EISENBERG: But -- but --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It is not the claim of\nineffective assistance.\nMR. EISENBERG: But the only way that the\npetitioner could exhaust that claim in State court on a\nsecond round of post-conviction review would be to put it\nin terms of ineffective assistance of first post-\nconviction counsel. And, of course, he can't then take\nthat claim and come to Federal court because claims of the\nineffectiveness of post-conviction counsel are not\ncognizable on Federal habeas review.\nSo not only did he wait 4 years when he had no\nfiling deadline impediments to come to court, but he then\nraised in State court claims that he couldn't have turned\ninto exhausted Federal claims anyway in order to add to\nwhat was available to him, to the universe of claims that\nwere available to him after his initial round of State\npost-conviction review.\nAnd we're talking about equitable tolling for\nsomebody who only has a problem because of his own\ninaction for 4 years and who even then spent another 3\nyears in State court on claims that he couldn't bring to\nState court, and even then, in the face of developing\nState law about the time bar, refused to look at it. So\nnot only did we have a statute that says you're in\ntrouble, you're time-barred now --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Just as a matter of curiosity,\nis the transcript of the plea colloquy still available?\nMR. EISENBERG: Yes, Your Honor. It's in the\nappendix. And what the judge --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And was there the\nconstitutional violation he alleges?\nMR. EISENBERG: What the judge said three times\nis, you understand that your sentence will be life, and\nthe petitioner said yes each time.\nNow, his claim later on -- and he's right. He\ndidn't think that was his claim when he filed his first\npost-conviction review petition in 1986. He just thought\nhis claim was that his plea was involuntary. Once he got\ncounsel appointed, it turned out that his claim was, oh,\nmy lawyer didn't specifically -- neither my lawyer nor the\njudge specifically told me that by life they meant life as\nopposed to something less than life.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The irony of this whole\nproceeding is it seems to me it would be a lot easier to\ndecide the merits of that claim if the transcript is\navailable than to get into all these issues --\nMR. EISENBERG: Well, but, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- we have today.\nMR. EISENBERG: I'm sorry.\nThat's what happened. That claim was litigated\non the first round of post-conviction review and the State\ncourts rejected it because of the transcript of the\ncolloquy. The defendant could have taken that claim to\nFederal court in 1992. He just didn't. Now --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, he's a 17-year-old\nwithout any learning in the law. He probably didn't\nrealize there's any requirement that these things have to\nappear in the transcript. I mean, that's understandable.\nMR. EISENBERG: He -- he knew it appeared in the\ntranscript. That was the basis of his claim in -- on\nState post-conviction review. He had not one but two\nlawyers appointed for that review and he litigated it on\nup through the State highest court.\nBut even when he came back in 1996, he knew the\nstatute was there. He's never claimed he was confused by\nthe new time bar. He says, I thought I would get some\nexceptions to it. But then the State court came and said,\nno, it's jurisdictional, no exceptions. Defendant didn't\ndo anything. It was 1997, still 2 years before he filed\nin Federal court. Didn't take note of that State -- he\ntook note of it. He acknowledges in his pleadings that he\nknew about it, but he decided not to go to Federal court\nanyway.\nMore -- more cases come out from the State\ncourts, even the decision in his own court -- in his own\ncase from the State's highest court. Even when we get to\nJuly of 1999 and the State supreme court denies review on\nthe timeliness question in his own case, the petitioner\nsays, even then how was I supposed to know that I wasn't\ngoing to get some kind of exception to the State time bar?\nI didn't know that until the next month when another case\ncame out from the State supreme court. This was the third\nor the fourth from the State supreme court in somebody\nelse's case. Only then in August of 1999 did I finally\nknow that I was time-barred, meaning I knew then that I\nhad never been getting any tolling, that for the last 3\nyears, I didn't have 1 day of tolling on my Federal\nclaims.\nAnd at that point did he then go to Federal\ncourt? Even then he didn't. Even in August 1999 when the\npetitioner says, finally I know that I've been out of luck\nfor the last 3 years, that I'm 3 years late to Federal\ncourt, does he rush in then? No. He waits another 5\nmonths after August of 1999 to finally come to Federal\ncourt and say here's my petition, here's the claims that\nI've been working on and that I have litigated in State\ncourt.\nThat's not equitable tolling, Your Honor. It's\nnot equitable tolling under the circumstances of the\nspecific circumstances of this case, and it's not\nequitable tolling in general when a petitioner claims\nessentially I have a mistake of law, I thought that I\nwould win, I knew there were arguments against me, I knew\nI might lose those arguments, but I really thought I could\nwin, and therefore you should give me equitable tolling\nwhile I pursue them.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Eisenberg.\nMR. EISENBERG: Thank you very much.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Wycoff, you have about 4\nminutes left.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID WYCOFF\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. WYCOFF: Several things. First of all, the\nrespondent said that in the second petition Mr. Pace only\npresented State law, ineffective assistance of post-\nconviction claims, which are not Federal claims. That's\nabsolutely not true. He presented the ineffective\nassistance of post-conviction counsel as a waiver-\novercoming mechanism not as a substantive claim for\nrelief. The substantive claims were due process claim,\nineffective assistance of counsel, and new facts which\nneeded to be exhausted under Third Circuit exhaustion law.\nSecond, respondent suggested and -- and the\nThird Circuit also suggested that State law somehow became\nclear in mid-December 1997 when the Superior Court, which\nis Pennsylvania's intermediate court, decided a case\ncalled Alcorn. Alcorn was the first case to apply the\ntime bar. But the Third Circuit itself, after Alcorn in\nthe Lambert case, held that the -- the statutory language\nof the time bar is not dispositive and you have to exhaust\neven if you don't meet one of the statutory exceptions\nbecause the court may fashion judicial exceptions just\nlike they did for all the other procedural bar rules.\nIn fact, Pennsylvania in the Lambert case, in\ntheir opposition to the certiorari petition in May of\n1998, said that that's a correct statement of Pennsylvania\nlaw, that there are judicially created exceptions,\nincluding the miscarriage of justice exception which will\nprobably apply to the time bar, just like they applied to\nthe other statutory bars.\nSo Alcorn did not, even if it could have, since\nit's an intermediate court, it did not clear up the state\nof the law. The law did not become clear as to the\nspecific things that Mr. Pace alleged, which is the\nmiscarriage of justice exception under Pennsylvania law\nand the illegal sentence exception, judicially created\nexceptions to bar, were not rejected by the Pennsylvania\nSupreme Court until July of -- I'm sorry -- August of\n1999, which is -- by that time Mr. Pace was already out of\nState court so those -- the law became clear in State\ncourt after he was already done litigating.\nThe Third Circuit did not actually find the\nstatutory language of the PCRA time bar dispositive of the\nexhaustion question until March of 2000. The district\ncourts, not just Judge Giles, Chief Judge Giles' 20 years\nexperience on the bench, not just him, lots of district\ncourts send people back to exhaust during this same time\nperiod.\nState law was unclear. State law appeared to\nprovide remedies and possible merits review. Because the\nState law was unclear, Third Circuit exhaustion law\nrequired petitioners like Mr. Pace to go back and exhaust.\nAnd he did exactly what the circuit law required of him.\nAnd as a matter of equity, the court cannot punish someone.\nA Federal court can't say, do X, and then after that person\ndoes it, say, sorry, you're out of court. It's not fair\nand it shouldn't happen here.\nAs to statutory tolling, I just want to -- the\n-- the Court I think can just easily decide this case just\nby reaffirming the central holding of Artuz which is when\na State court allows you to file, gives your filing\njudicial review, applies a bar rule on a claim-by-claim\nbasis, that was a condition to obtaining relief on claims\nin the petition. It's not a condition to filing the\npetition itself. And if the State court eventually holds\nall your claims are barred, as they did in Artuz, the\npetition is, nevertheless, properly filed and should toll\nAEDPA's statutory -- under AEDPA's statutory tolling\nprovisions.\nIf there are no further questions.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Wycoff.\n"
