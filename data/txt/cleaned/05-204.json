Perry, and the consolidated cases.\nMr. Smith.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. SMITH\nON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS IN NO. 05-276\nMR. SMITH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Texas legislature passed a new\ncongressional districting map in 2003 for only one\nreason: maximizing the number of Republicans who would\nrepresent the State of Texas in Congress. Even though\nthe existing lawful map already had 20 of 32 districts\nwhich strongly favored the Republicans, lawmakers went\nto extraordinary lengths to lock in control of 22\ndistricts, moving around 8 million people into new\ndistricts, abandoning concerns about compactness,\nwherever necessary, and most importantly, segregating\nthe population by race and by politics into 32\ndistricts which are extremely noncompetitive.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your -- your\nstatement that it was for one reason only means it\nwasn't for any discriminatory reason on the grounds of\nrace or ethnicity?\nMR. SMITH: Your Honor, the finding of the\ndistrict court, which we're relying on here, was that\nit was purely for discrimination based on partisanship\nrather than on the basis of race.\nNow, they started out by trying to engineer\nthe defeat in the -- in the legislative process,\nengineer the defeat of the six Democratic Congressmen\nwho had managed to be elected in Republican-leaning\ndistricts because they were moderate to conservative\nand they were, as the district court put it, able to\nappeal to voters to split their tickets and vote for\nthem in 2002.\nBy the end of the legislative process, they\nwent further and decided to take the risk of\neliminating one of only four districts in the State in\nwhich African Americans had an opportunity to elect\ncandidates of their choice and also to eliminate one of\nthe Hispanic opportunity districts in south Texas.\nNow, in the latter case, they did try to replace that\nwith another Hispanic opportunity district, but that\nwas the one that we've called the land bridge district,\nDistrict 25, which spans 300 miles, linking up urban\nconcentrations of Latinos in Austin and in McAllen down\non the Mexican border.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You think that's no good.\nMR. SMITH: Your Honor, we --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Not -- not even to prevent\nretrogression, which would violate section 5.\nMR. SMITH: Your Honor, the retrogression\nproblem was created by the fact that they had gotten\nrid of a much more natural -- naturally occurring --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that was done for\npolitical reasons, not racial reasons.\nMR. SMITH: Exactly, Your Honor, and that's\nthe argument that was made and rejected expressly by\nthis Court in Bush v. Vera, that we had to make an ugly\nminority district rather than a compact minority\ndistrict because if we did it the other way, a nearby\nincumbent would lose his seat. That was precisely the\nargument that was made there, that it was really\nincumbency protection, and we had to make it this ugly\ndistrict to send that excessive racial message in order\nto protect other nearby incumbents, an argument which\nis mirrored here exactly and -- and as to which I\nnotice the -- the State of Texas offers no response.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But what -- what is your\nproposal? What -- what is -- what is a State to do if\n-- assuming there is a political motivation in drawing\nits districts, perfectly valid political motivation\nlet's assume, and the result of that redrawing is that\nit would eliminate a majority minority district, what\n-- what is the State supposed to do?\nMR. SMITH: I think the State has to stay\nwithin the constitutional confines of the Shaw v. Reno\ndoctrine which would require it not to go so far in the\npursuit of its political agenda that it creates a\ndistrict -- has to -- has to create a minority\nopportunity district somewhere that would otherwise\nviolate Shaw.\nNow --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But what's the -- I'm -- as\nJustice Scalia, I'm interested in the section 25\nproblem. The briefs --\nMR. SMITH: District.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- for your co-counsel\ndon't talk much about it, and it's -- it's a problem\nfor me.\nJustice Scalia's point was let's assume --\nand I have some doubt about it. Let's assume that\nthere's a valid reason for redoing section 23. That\nmeans you need another district to avoid retrogression.\nWhat is -- what is your position as to district 25 on\nthat assumption, based on that assumption?\nMR. SMITH: I don't think that it makes a\nconstitutional difference under this Court's cases\nwhether or not the reason they decided to place the\ndistrict there and give it that configuration was\nbecause they had a political agenda somewhere else.\nThe -- the fact of the matter is they -- they were\ndeliberately trying to create an Hispanic majority\ndistrict there, and to do it, they had to go all the\nway up to Austin and grab 300,000 Latinos and link them\nup with --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Surely, that's not what\nmakes it bad. Even if they created a compact district\nbut with the -- with the intent of creating a majority\nminority district, that would be a district created for\na racial reason. The mere fact that this one happens\nto be not compact doesn't eliminate the motivation, and\n-- and I don't see how you can avoid that motivation\nunless you're going to abandon the -- the prohibition\nagainst regression.\nMR. SMITH: Our point, Your Honor, is that in\nthis situation, doing it this way, the -- the\nmotivation predominates over the other legitimate\ndistricting criteria, which I think under Bush and\nunder --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Which -- which\nmotivation?\nMR. SMITH: Well, the -- the racial\nmotivation to create a district -- to -- to reach out\nas far as they did to capture --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, can the -- can the\nState by its action with one district, i.e., 23, in\neffect bootstrap itself in a position where it's\nentitled to use race where -- in a -- in a predominant\nand I -- I think insulting way and -- and then have a\ndefense?\nMR. SMITH: Our submission is that they\ncannot, Your Honor.\nNow, if I could turn to the partisanship\nissue, our --\nJUSTICE BREYER: May I just clarify one thing\non that?\nMR. SMITH: Sure.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I take it your reason was\nthat in Bush v. Vera, the Court said, of course, they\ncan use race to prevent retrogression. Of course, they\ncan, but if they do, they have to create a compact\nmajority minority district, not an elongated majority\n--\nMR. SMITH: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's the -- that's the\nargument. I have to go back and look at Bush v. Vera.\nMR. SMITH: Yes, Your Honor, and that they\ncan't say we have to create it in a non-compact way\nwhere the race predominates over the other values\nbecause we have a political agenda of protecting some\nother incumbent in a non-minority district.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How -- how does that\nmake any sense to say that what you're objecting to is\nthe consideration of race in one situation, but if it's\ncompact and the predominant motive was the\nconsideration of race, that doesn't bother you? That\nseems to me to be a back-door way to get into a more\nextensive judicial review of the compactness and based\non racial considerations that are, under your view, the\npredominant factor in each case.\nMR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, I think there's\na question of what you mean by the word predominance.\nAnd I as understand the Court's cases, there are times\nwhen the shape and the extra efforts that are made to\n-- to kind of gather up minority voters as, for\nexample, in Miller v. Johnson where we had a very\nsimilar district, where race is said to predominate in\na different sense than it does when you simply are\ncreating a minority district to avoid retrogression or\nto -- to stay in compliance with the Voting Rights Act.\nClearly, the Voting Rights Act requires you\nto create minority districts. It should require that\nit makes sense that people make efforts to do that.\nWe're not saying you shouldn't do any of those things.\nWe're just saying in this instance, under this Court's\ncases, you shouldn't be able to use your political\nagenda to allow you and justify you to do it in a\ndifferent way which sends this extra message of\nexcessive racial consideration.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And that's a --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you can take race\ninto account if it's compact as a predominant motive.\nYou can't take race into account if it's not compact.\nMR. SMITH: I think, Your Honor, you\ncertainly can --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: As a dominant motive.\nMR. SMITH: You certainly can intentionally\ncreate a minority district under section 2 of the\nVoting Rights Act. I don't know how you could comply\nwith section 2 of the Voting Rights Act if you don't do\nthat in situations where, under the Gingles criteria,\nthat's what you're supposed to do.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask? I'm a little\npuzzled by the -- the questioning. Doesn't everyone\nagree that the predominant motive in all the districts\nwas political? You agree to that, don't you?\nMR. SMITH: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And you don't agree that\nthat necessarily makes it valid, that that's\nnecessarily a defense to section 2.\nMR. SMITH: No, I actually don't agree with\nthat, Your Honor, and you're right.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And -- and the problem with\nsection -- with district 23, under section 2 of the\nVoting Rights Act, is not the motivation. It's the\nresults that have changed. Isn't that correct?\nMR. SMITH: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And the question under the\ndistrict court's opinion is whether the political\nmotive was an adequate defense to what would otherwise\nbe a violation of section 2. Is that correct?\nMR. SMITH: That's correct, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, isn't it\ncorrect, though, that a result is -- focus on results\nis not sufficient if the challenge is an equal\nprotection one and not a section 2 one?\nMR. SMITH: Right, but -- but our challenge\nunder the Equal Protection Clause --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm talking about\ndistrict 25.\nMR. SMITH: It's a little hard to keep all\nthe different arguments straight, but yes. Our\nargument is based on intent there, yes, Your Honor.\nAnd -- and the argument is that the intent went too far\nbecause they had to --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's why I\nasked earlier that your -- your statement that all of\nthis was done with a political motive -- I wondered how\nthat satisfied the equal protection requirement, not\nthe section 2 requirement.\nMR. SMITH: Well, I think there are\nsituations in which you have a political motive\noverarching the entire map, and that -- but at the same\ntime, that pushes you to do some things which could\nviolate the Fourteenth Amendment in terms of racial\nconduct. And that's what this -- that's what our\nargument is --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But you don't think that's\na defense. It seems to me the State creates the very\nproblem that it claims that it must use race to settle.\nMR. SMITH: That's correct, Your Honor, yes.\nWe don't think it's a defense in this instance.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Now, with respect to section\n2, what is -- what is your position on the relationship\nbetween the predominant political motivation and the\nexistence and nonexistence of a section 2 violation?\nMR. SMITH: Your Honor, if I understand the\nquestion, I -- if the question is is it permissible to\nhave --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If -- let me put it another\nway.\nMR. SMITH: Okay.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If -- if you otherwise\ndemonstrate a section 2 violation, is the political\nmotivation a defense?\nMR. SMITH: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No.\nMR. SMITH: Certainly not.\nNow, we have a -- an argument about that too,\nwhich has to do with the district in the Dallas-Fort\nWorth area, and I think the political defense there\ndoesn't have anything to do with it.\nNow, if -- if I could, I think that the whole\nmap -- the decision to redraw the whole map violates\nthe Equal Protection Clause for a wholly different\nreason, which was that it was wholly lacking in any\nrational, legitimate public purpose. At the time,\nthere was a lawful map in place that had the right\nnumber of districts, and the district court found as\nfact that the only reason that this law was even\nconsidered, let alone passed, was to help one political\nparty gain more seats in the Congress at the expense of\nthe other.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about having a --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wow. That's a surprise.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about having a -- a\nplan that was put in place by the legislature instead\nof a temporary plan put in effect by a court?\nMR. SMITH: The --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't there -- isn't it --\nyou -- you seem to treat this as a redone redistricting\ninstead of as the very first redistricting done by a\nlegislature.\nMR. SMITH: It was the first one done by the\nlegislature because they violated the Constitution\nintentionally when they had an obligation to -- to draw\na map 2 years earlier. Our submission is that the\nexistence of some power that the legislature may have\nto -- to alter the remedial map -- and they may well\nhave that power. We don't -- we don't question that --\ndoesn't justify the map. They still have to, in\nexercising that power, point to some constitutional\nbasis for which they're acting.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Which -- but it's a\nperfectly constitutional basis to alter the map because\nwe don't think it allocates the seats in the fashion\nthat our political power enables us to -- to provide\nfor. Legislatures redraw the maps all the time for\npolitical reasons. I mean, to say that this is, you\nknow, something horrible is ridiculous. You\nacknowledge that political motivation is fine.\nMR. SMITH: Your Honor, we --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Don't you?\nMR. SMITH: -- we acknowledge that we\ntolerate political motivation in the context of map-\ndrawing when there's other legitimate public purposes\nbeing served, which is to say at the beginning of the\ndecade when they have to redraw the map anyway.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I see.\nMR. SMITH: But our position is when it's\npurely for partisan motivation, which is -- only occurs\nin mid-decade --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Even -- even when the map is\nso distorted -- you -- you acknowledge that the map that came\nout, after this -- this realignment of districts, had\nless of a divergence between the voting strength of the\nRepublican Party and the number of Republican seats\nthan had existed under the previous allocation by the\nDemocrats.\nMR. SMITH: That -- that is not, we believe,\na justification for two reasons, Your Honor. This\nnotion that you can have compensatory gerrymandering\nand that that can be your justification -- I think it's\nwrong as a matter of law because all it amounts to is\nanother way of saying we like -- we don't like the\npartisan composition of the delegation that the people\nvoted for and we're going to change it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm saying less. Less.\nIt -- there's less of a divergence under the new map\nthan there was under the old one. The only difference\nis this divergence is in favor of the majority.\nMR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, as the district\ncourt found -- and this is on page 85 of our\njurisdictional statement appendix -- it wasn't that\nthere was bias in the map that the court drew. It was\nthat there were 20 of 32 districts that strongly\nfavored the Republicans in the court-drawn map. It\njust so happened that the voters in those districts, in\nsix of those Republican-leaning districts, happened to\nlike voting for moderate to conservative Democrats who\nthey were comfortable with. Now, if you tell me -- I\n-- I find difficulty -- I find it difficult to\nunderstand how anyone could say the legislature can, as\na matter of -- use the machinery of government to\ndecide that those voters should not have that\nopportunity to do that again, that that was a mistake.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, counsel, just\ntake it in -- in an abstract way. If you think that\nthe prior system has been gerrymandered by the party in\npower, are you saying that when that shift in power in\nthe statewide offices changes, that the new party in\npower cannot redress the gerrymandering of its\npredecessor?\nMR. SMITH: My -- my answers to that are\ntwofold. I think as a matter of law that the Court\nshould hold that -- if that's the only justification,\nyou ought to wait until you have other public purposes\nfor redrawing the lines.\nBut even if that were -- even if the Court is\ngoing to allow that kind of justification for mid-decade\nredistricting, it shouldn't allow it here because it\nwas just factually untrue, as the district court found.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but let's get back to\nthe -- to the principle without just talking about\nthese -- these factfindings. It -- it seems to me\nvery odd for you to be telling us that partisan\ngerrymandering is -- is improper when that's the sole\nor substantial, predominant motivation, but then saying\nthat we can't correct it when it's happened.\nLet's assume that the 1990 legislative plan\nwas one that was done with -- without a wholly partisan\nintent, but over the years, it -- it now freezes in the\nDemocrats or party X to having a much greater advantage\nthan the general registration would give it. And if it\nleaves it in for a particularly partisan purpose, why\n-- why can't it be redone?\nMR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, I think that if\nthe Court --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I just don't understand\nthat argument.\nMR. SMITH: I think it's a dangerous thing to\ndo, to say to the legislatures of the country you can't\nredistrict for partisan gain, but if you can recouch it\nas partisan compensation, that's okay.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Let me give you\nanother parallel. Let's suppose that districts have\nbeen gerrymandered for racially discriminatory purposes\nfor years. Can you take race into account in drawing\nnew districts to remedy that racial discrimination?\nMR. SMITH: I think if a map is illegal, Your\nHonor, then -- then certainly it is within the power of\n-- of the legislature to --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Oh, well, that's -- but now,\nin fairness, I think to the red brief argument --\nyou've read the red briefs.\nMR. SMITH: I have, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. They are filled with\nfactual information that in their opinion shows that\npreviously the Democrats had gerrymandered this much\nworse, and that what -- this was an effort to create a\nbalance. That's what their view is. Now, I want to\nknow really precisely what is your response to that\nargument.\nMR. SMITH: My response is -- is -- factual\nresponse is that by the time we got to 2002, the\ndistrict court's drawn map had 20 of 32 districts,\nwhich voted overwhelmingly Republican for every other\noffice, in the range of 60 to 70 percent, so that\nwhatever bias was introduced into the map in 1991, if\nthere was one, had been eradicated because all of these\nDemocrats in those districts had become more\nRepublican. And so the map was not biased. There was\nnothing wrong with the lines.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, what do I look to in\nthe record to verify what you just said?\nMR. SMITH: You look to the court's finding\non page 85 which said that 20 of 32 districts favored\nthe Republicans. And you look at the expert reports\nfiled by both sides at the trial that preceded that\nfinding, and the experts for both sides said that the\ncourt-drawn map was a pro-Republican map that favored\nthe Republicans or, at minimum, was fair, and that with\nthe kind of voting patterns that existed in Texas at\nthe time, one would expect the Republicans to carry 20\ndistricts in most of the elections.\nNow, they also said -- and -- and this is a\nreason why the State didn't actually put their expert\non the stand -- that the map that the legislature had\ndrawn instead was wildly biased in favor of the\nRepublicans in that at 52 percent of the vote, they\nwould still get 22 districts, and at 50 percent of the\nvote, they'd still get 20 districts.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but what percentage did\nthey have? I -- I thought that -- you say that they\nshould have gotten 20 districts, and how many districts\ndid the plan give them?\nMR. SMITH: The plan gave them 20 districts\nin which they had a strong Republican majority. Now,\nwhat that means is that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you say that's what they\nshould have had, given -- given the voting in the\nState.\nMR. SMITH: I say they -- that given that\nopportunity to have 20 districts elect Congressmen,\nthat's -- that's all that anybody could reasonably ask\nfor. That's the only kind of justification that I can\neven imagine justifying purely partisan redistricting\nin mid-decade.\nThe fact of the matter is the large majority\nof the Members of Congress who went to Washington after\nthe 2002 election were elected by Republicans in\nRepublican districts. That's what the facts are. Now,\nthey say, well, vestiges of the past gerrymander are\nstill around, but what does that mean? The fact is the\ndistricts are by now overwhelmingly Republican in the\nlarge majority of cases.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you have any -- any\nauthority either in the text of the Constitution or in\na -- a case for the proposition that the only reason a\nlegislature can reapportion its districts is because\nthere's been a census?\nMR. SMITH: Our -- our position is slightly\ndifferent.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but that's your\nposition when you said mid-decade redistricting is bad\nbecause your -- your position is the only reason is the\ncensus is -- has -- has caused there to be less than --\nthan one man/one vote.\nMR. SMITH: There may be cases where you\ncould do mid-decade redistricting for neutral,\nlegitimate public purposes. I submit they'll be quite\nrare in -- in practice, but there certainly could be.\nOur position is you can't redraw the lines\npurely for partisan gain, and the case I would point to\nthat I think most strongly speaks to that is Cox v.\nLarios. In that case, the district court found that\npopulation deviations, sufficiently small that they\nweren't even usually requiring justifications, didn't\npass the rational basis test because the only\nexplanation you could offer for those deviations was\nthat they were systematically attempting to help the\nDemocrats at the expense of the Republicans.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But -- but are you saying --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if you say that mid-\ndecennial districting is suspect or subject to some\nspecial rules, then it seems to me that you're --\nyou're taking away a very important deterrent that\nworks on legislatures when they do decennial\ndistricting. If you know as a legislature, when you do\na decennial districting, that your program is going to\nbe presumptively valid or not subject to partisan\ngerrymandering, then -- then you're -- then you're\nliable to overreach. And it -- it seems to me very\ndangerous for this Court to take away that control\nmechanism that exists so that legislatures know that\nthere's a possibility that if they overreach, they can\nbe corrected.\nMR. SMITH: That -- that might be a concern,\nYour Honor. I don't think the -- the historical\npractice supports it because the fact is that while\nthere's been a fair amount of partisan redistricting,\nwhatever one wants to call it, in the last several\ndecades, there have been precious few, if any, examples\nof anybody trying to convene the legislature before the\nnext census to try to fix it. It is extraordinarily\nrare. And the reason for it is we -- there's a general\ntradition we've established in this country that\nwhatever happens when those lines get drawn, even if\nit's done by a court, you leave it alone until the next\ntime --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, there was no --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That -- that little -- even\nif it's done by the court. I like the way you slipped\nthat in. I mean, even if you had a general rule that\nyou cannot redistrict except after a decennial census,\nsurely there ought to be an exception unless -- which\n-- which would read, unless the districting you're\nliving under was never decreed by the legislature, but\nwas decreed by a court. And that was the situation\nhere. Surely, that's a good reason, even if you\nadopted your general proposition.\nMR. SMITH: The -- the reason I -- I slipped\nit in is that in my description of what I think is the\ncurrent tradition, Your Honor, is we went and looked\nand found how many court-drawn congressional district\nmaps have there been in this country in the last 40\nyears, and how many times were they redrawn by the\nlegislature. And the answer is that if you go back\nbetween 1970 and 2000, there were 36 of them, and only\ntwo of them were redrawn in very small, technical ways,\none in Hawaii where they only have two districts and\nthen the one in Texas, which was changed in Dallas.\nIt's not --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I'd say that's a shame\nfor the democratic process. I -- I don't like the idea\nthat -- that there are a lot of districts out there\nthat have never been drawn by the people, which is what\nthe Constitution envisions.\nMR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, the other thing\nI think about this -- this argument about that we have\nthis -- this need to have a legislative plan is you\ninvite an abuse of a different kind. If you -- if you\nsay to the legislature, you can sit on your hands at\nthe time when you have an undisputed constitutional\nobligation to redraw the lines at the beginning of --\nof the decade, as long -- and you'll know that what\nthat will do is it will give you the right to come\nalong anytime you feel like it when you get your\npolitical ducks --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that the reason\nthese lines were not redrawn at the beginning of the\ndecade, because the majority party sat on its hands?\nMR. SMITH: That's absolutely what happened\nhere, Your Honor. They didn't make any serious efforts\nto redo it. The only person --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought there was --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- I thought there -- the\nhouses were divided. One party, one -- had one house;\nthe other, the other. And so they were at loggerheads\nand they --\nMR. SMITH: The reality is -- and the record\n-- there was discussion of this at trial by Senator\nRatliffe -- there was not very serious effort to do\nthis at the time. The only person who can call a\nspecial session -- and it does take special sessions in\nTexas to get these lines drawn historically -- is the\nGovernor. He declined to call any special sessions\nwhen they -- when they had a divided legislature. Of\ncourse, 2 years later, when they had unilateral control\nof the whole legislature, we were calling special\nsessions like mad to get the job done. So --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the court -- even from\nthe court's perspective, was it the same three judges\nthat did the -- that did the plan, the court-ordered\nplan? And I thought that the -- the judge who presided\ntold us in his latest opinion that they never\nanticipated that as being a permanent plan, and indeed,\nthey tried to stay as close as they could to the then-\nexisting plan.\nMR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, there was some\nlanguage to that effect. If you go back, though, and\nread the opinion that the -- the judges wrote in -- in\n2001 when they actually were describing in meticulous\ndetail their process of drawing the map, he\nspecifically said then that they didn't follow the old\nlines, that they used neutral criteria like compactness\nand following political subdivisions, and that they --\nthis was not an effort to -- to come up with a map that\nmatched the old map.\nThe only thing that I think really fairly can\nbe said about the court-drawn map is it did give a\nseparate district to all of the incumbents, which is\nwhat you'd expect a court to do. They're not going to\nsit around and decide mutual incumbents ought to have\nto run against each other. And so it did have that\neffect, I think, of allowing some incumbency advantage\nto continue on.\nBut it is -- it is not true that the -- that\nthe court tried to keep some pattern in the map beyond\nthat. The court specifically said otherwise in 2001\nwhen it drew the map, and then it said in --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, we're not -- we're\nnot trying the court for a bad intent. We're looking\nat the effect of what it's done, and if the effect of\nwhat it's done is to leave in place something that's\nslanted based on -- on statewide registration in favor\nof the Democrats, then -- then, it seems to me, there's\n-- there's a ground for the new legislature to act.\nAnd -- and one -- one reason legislatures may\nnot have redrawn plans often is because they always\nprotect incumbents.\nMR. SMITH: But, Your Honor, the facts are\nthat it wasn't slanted. The facts are the experts both\ntestified from both sides at the trial that the map was\nfair to both parties and that it contained 20\nRepublican districts. And that's what the court found\ntoo in 2004. Then we have an appeal and we go back\ndown on remand, and suddenly we're starting to hear\nabout vestiges of gerrymanders. But the court didn't\nwithdraw its finding of fact that there were 20\nRepublican districts in its own map.\nThat's true. I mean, look at the way the\nvotes were cast in 2002. There were 20 Republican\ndistricts in the map. The six districts that these\nDemocrats represented who they -- who they -- the\nmoderate Democrats that they were targeting -- the\naverage vote for statewide office in that district was\nsomething like 65 percent -- 55 to 65 percent for the\nRepublican candidate.\nI -- I looked, for example, yesterday at the\n-- there was an election for the Attorney General in\nTexas in 2002. It was an open seat, two -- two non-\nincumbents running against each other, two people from\nAustin. And the average vote for the Republican\nAttorney General candidate, Mr. Cruz's boss, in that\nelection in those six districts was 62 percent for him\nand 38 percent for the -- the Democrat. So these were\nnot Democratic districts. This was not a gerrymander\nin any rational use of the word.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Smith, may -- may I ask\nyou to comment on -- on one problem that I have with\nyour position that has nothing whatever to do with the\n-- with the fact that there was a -- a judicial\nredrawing in the first place here?\nIf I understand your argument, you're saying\nthat a -- a districting that takes place prior to the\nreport of a new decennial census, which is done for\npurely political reasons, maximizing political\nadvantage, is invalid for that reason, I guess under\nthe Equal Protection Clause.\nMR. SMITH: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And yet, I take it it's also\nyour position that if the districting is done in\nresponse to the new decennial figures so that there's a\nneed to do something to conform to one person/one vote,\nthat there is nothing illegitimate about political\nmotivation, at least up to some point --\nMR. SMITH: Right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- in -- in drawing the\nlines at that time.\nHow can we in principle say that the\nmotivation which is legitimate in 1991 is somehow\nconstitutionally illegitimate and dispositive in 1995?\nMR. SMITH: It seems to me that one is not\nsaying that it's legitimate in 1991. One is saying\nthat in redistricting, which is a messy process, we\ntolerate a lot of mixed motives. We tolerate some\nconsideration of race. We -- we ask for some\nconsideration of race. We tolerate some consideration\nof politics. But that is dramatically different under\nthe rational basis test from a law that is passed\nsolely for political reasons because it doesn't have\nthe other kinds of interests that are being promoted\nand protected in -- at the beginning of the decade.\nAnd so there's a drastic difference, it seems to me,\nunder the rational basis analysis between a law which\nserves a lot of purposes, some governmental and public,\nsome of them private, and -- and not legitimate bases\nfor governmental action.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But you're making the\nassumption that a mid-decennial districting is not\ninterested in compactness, it's not interested in\ncounties, it's not interested in keeping a university\nwithin one -- within one district. That's -- that's\njust simply not true.\nMR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, the -- the fact\nhere is that the only reason they decided to change was\nfor partisanship. That's what the district court found\nas a matter of fact.\nNow, the other legal requirements of -- of\nthe map that are -- give you the -- the legitimate\nbases for redrawing the lines at the beginning of the\ndecade were already satisfied because such a map\nalready existed. And as this Court said in -- in\nGrowe, the -- the court-drawn map, in some sense,\nchanges the status quo. You have to say what are the\nadditional governmental interests that are -- that\nexist and justify going through this process again and\nchanging that map, which already is fully lawful, has\nbeen affirmed by this -- this Court as lawful.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But your answer, both to the\nJustice Kennedy and -- and to me, ultimately comes\ndown, I guess, to saying that political partisanship\nalone, undiluted, unadulterated by any other\nmotivations, is per se wrong.\nMR. SMITH: It's -- it's not a basis that can\njustify public conduct, State action. If -- if it was,\nthen it would be perfectly okay, I suppose, to have\ngovernment subsidies for some parties and not for\nothers, or to have -- let some people use public\nfacilities and not others.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All right. Let's -- let's\nassume that the -- that the partisans who do the mid-\nterm redistricting candidly say, we are doing this for\npartisan reasons, but we recognize limits on what we\ncan do. And the limits are the traditional ones,\ncompactness, et cetera. Let us assume that there is,\nin fact, evidence of a good faith effort at least to\nconform to those districting principles. Under those\ncircumstances, is the mid-term redistricting equally\nillegitimate?\nMR. SMITH: The question I think you need to\npose is what is the justification for doing anything,\nnot -- not for any particular line --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that may be, but how\nabout the question that I posed?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SMITH: Well, it seems to me, Your Honor,\nthat if -- if the -- I was trying to get to an answer.\nI really was.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. SMITH: It seems to me that if -- if you\ncan -- if they can legitimately and -- and plausibly\nsay, we are -- we -- we decided to redraw the old map\nbecause it was so departed -- it's so departed from\nthese important principles and values like compactness\nand respect for subdivision -- so if that's our reason\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No. I'm -- in a way, I'm\nmaking it easy for you. I'm saying, look, they're --\nthey're saying we think we can get a better deal for\nour party, but we are respecting these districting\nprinciples. Equally illegitimate?\nMR. SMITH: I think so, Your Honor. If all\nthey're saying is we -- we didn't go as crazy as we\ncould have, but the only reason we did anything is\nbecause we want more seats, but we could have done even\nworse, that seems to me not a -- not a justification\nfor action, but merely a -- a decision not to -- to be\nmore political than purely political.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The difficulty I have with\nthat is that it is -- it is impossible -- I think you\nwould agree. It is impossible -- and may, indeed --\nlet's assume undesirable -- to take partisanship out of\na political process. And -- and if partisanship pure\nand simple, even though subject to the discipline of\ndistricting principles, is -- is illegitimate, then I\ndon't see why that does not imply the illegitimacy of\nany districting at any time.\nMR. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, our -- our\nsubmission is it makes a difference when it's pure\nrather than merely one of the many things that is going\non.\nIf I could take a few minutes just to talk\nabout our section 2 argument with respect to the\nAfrican American --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Before you do that, may I\njust ask one short question?\nMR. SMITH: Sure.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You've mainly attacked the\nplan as a whole in your briefs. And I'm wondering. I\noften look at particular districts, as you may know.\nAre there residents of districts 23, district 24 that\nare plaintiffs?\nMR. SMITH: We have plaintiffs in every\ndistrict, I think, on the whole map, certainly any\ndistrict that would raise a concern under --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But they're not identified\neasily --\nMR. SMITH: Yes, Your Honor, but -- but I\nthink that there -- there was a -- in the complaint\nthere's allegations about where each of these people\nlive, and I think that -- that we were very careful to\nmake sure anything we were talking about specifically,\nsuch as, for example, district 24 in Dallas, we had --\nwe had plaintiffs. The -- the list is quite long. So\nthere is standing, I think, for all of those arguments.\nNow, on -- on district 24, our submission is\nthat under section 2, there ought to be protection for\ndistricts where the minority group does not have an\nabsolute majority but where the evidence shows that it\ncan effectively elect a candidate of its choice in --\nin concert with a -- a predictable group of Anglo or\nsometimes Hispanic crossover voters, and that we think\non the facts of this case, this was such a district\nbecause the African Americans in every case were a\nlarge majority of the voters in the Democratic primary\nand the Democratic nominee, in virtually every case, is\nelected in this district regardless of what -- what\nrace that person may be.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What was the\npercentage of the African American voters in the\ndistrict as a whole?\nMR. SMITH: Citizen voting age population is\n26 percent, Your Honor. The --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but if -- if your --\nif your test is that section 2 ought to be opened up to\nany racial group that could influence an -- an election,\nI don't see the limits on your principle.\nMR. SMITH: That's not our -- our test, Your\nHonor. Our test is they -- they have to control the\nelection, and --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that if you had a\nsituation where it's 40 percent one group, 40 percent\nanother group, and 20 percent where the 20 percent\ncontrolled who was elected by siding with one group or\nthe other group, then you would say that that was an\ninfluence district for that small -- the smallest group\nin the district?\nMR. SMITH: Your Honor, I don't think that\nwould work because I think the way we -- we view what\nyou have -- you -- the group has to be able to decide\nwho's going to be on the ballot, and then you want to\nsee whether there's enough crossover voting to --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No. Suppose there's a\nprimary where it works that they can get on the ballot.\nSuppose we're looking at the general election.\nMR. SMITH: If -- if that group gets to\ndecide who gets on the ballot --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Accept the hypothetical.\nMR. SMITH: Yes. If that group has -- has\npicked who gets on the ballot and their choice always\nwins the general election, I think that's not an\ninfluence district. That's -- that's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is the answer? I mean,\nyou've read the briefs. The obvious reply to that is\nthere are many, many districts in the United States\nwhere African American voters have a big influence on\nthe Democratic primary.\nMR. SMITH: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: A lot. And there are a lot\nwhere the Democrat wins. So if your principle is\naccepted, says the other side, that means that any\ndistrict that's drawn here to favor the Democrats can't\nbe changed, but all the ones that favor the Republicans\ncan be changed. Now, if that argument is right, it's\nhard for me to accept, but that's a neutral principle\nof constitutional law. So I want to see what -- what\nyour response is to that.\nMR. SMITH: I think there are a number of\nlimiting principles that apply here that -- that\nsuggest we're not just coming in here and asking for\nthe Voting Rights Act to become the -- the pro-\nDemocratic act --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Obviously you're not.\nThat's why I would like --\nMR. SMITH: And -- and --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- you to say what\nspecifically the answer to that argument is.\nMR. SMITH: The -- the -- first of all, there\nare not that many districts in which African Americans\ncontrol the Democratic primary and then have\npredictable ability to see that person elected in -- in\nthe general election. Where that is the truth, they\nthen have representation of the kind that I think is\nvaluable under section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.\nNow, of course, there are going to be limits.\nOne of them is De Grandy. They -- they only have\nrights up to a proportional level of their proportion\nof the population. And by not respecting -- not\nprotecting this kind of district, what you do is, in\nfact, condemn the people, the African Americans in\nTexas, to less than proportional representation because\nthere is no other way to give them a district in which\nthey have any possibility of -- of participation in the\nprocess and electing a candidate of their choice. This\nis the only place in Texas where it can be done.\nThey're -- they are more than an eighth of the\npopulation, citizen voting age population, and they're\nonly getting 3 districts out of 32 because the State of\nTexas chose to eliminate this district.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: This would be at -- least\nyour criterion, whether we accept it or not, would --\nwould be more administrable if we're dealing with the\nelimination of a district than if we were dealing with\nthe question of creating one. Do you take the position\nthat the NAAC brief does that there really should be\ndistinct criteria, depending on whether you're asking\nto create something new or preserve something which has\nbeen in place?\nMR. SMITH: I -- I perhaps have more faith in\nthe ability of courts to predict the future than -- than\nthat brief does, but -- but I certainly can imagine a\nrule where the court says, we're going to require that\nthere be experience, not simply predictions by experts,\nin order to create a district below the majority level.\nThat would be an administrable rule which would give\n-- at least give some protection in situations of the\nkind that we -- we face here.\nIf I could reserve the balance of my time,\nYour Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Smith.\nMs. Perales.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF NINA PERALES\nON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS IN NO. 05-439\nMS. PERALES: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI will begin by arguing that Texas violated\nthe Equal Protection Clause by making excessive use of\nrace in its changes to district 23. After removing\n100,000 Latinos from district 23, the State used race\nto craft a razor-thin Latino majority. Abandoning\npolitical data, the State used census block\nredistricting to achieve 50.9 percent Latino voting age\npopulation.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In 23.\nMS. PERALES: In district 23, Your Honor.\nThus, the State used race, as we contend, not\nonly to protect an incumbent, but to give the false\nimpression of Latino support for that incumbent.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Focus for a minute just on\nthe -- what we can call the removal, the drawing of the\nlines to exclude some Latino voters. Just focus on\nthat, not the later justification. The district court\nfound that this was for political reasons, not racial\nreasons, even though it was a largely racial group that\nwas removed. Do you attack that finding as clearly\nerroneous?\nMS. PERALES: Yes, Justice Kennedy, we do\nattack that finding as clearly erroneous. This case is\nreally the flip side of Easley v. Cromartie because in\nthis case Latino voters supported Republican and\nDemocratic candidates. As the State asserts\nvigorously, Latino voters voted significantly and\nsubstantially --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I interrupt you just\nwith one -- one question on district 23? Regardless of\nwhat the intent of the parties was, I'm just wondering\nwhy is the district court's finding on intent relevant\nto the section 2 issue when the test under section 2 is\nresults?\nMS. PERALES: Yes, Justice Stevens. The --\nthe test under section 2 is results, and that goes --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So that even if the intent\nwas primarily political, it would still violate section\n2.\nMS. PERALES: Yes, and we argue in our brief\nexactly that. But we hope today to focus in oral\nargument at least first on the Fourteenth Amendment\nviolation, which is the intentional use of race both as\nintentional vote dilution, as well as the analytically\ndistinct claim under Shaw v. Miller.\nWith respect to the question whether Latino\nvoters voted with such a high correlation -- and that's\nthe phrase used from Easley v. Cromartie -- whether\nthere was such a high correlation between Latino voters\nand Democratic voters, particularly in district 23, to\njustify removing them because of their race and then\nsaying that they were Democrats, that nexus simply\ndoesn't exist under the facts of this case.\nBesides the State's arguments and -- and the\nmany assertions that it makes with respect to Latino\nvoting support for Republican candidates and especially\nCongressman Bonilla, we also have Latino voting for\nBonilla that rises and falls. If Latinos were close\nadherents to the Democratic ticket, you wouldn't see\nfluctuating support for Congressman Bonilla. You would\nsee low and steady support if Latinos were Democratic\nvoters. Instead, we see something very different,\nwhich is Congressman Bonilla gaining support in the\nLatino community within his district up until 1996\nwhere the peak is 30 percent Latino support and then a\nsteady decline over a series of elections, ending in\n2002 with only 8 percent, as the district court found,\nLatino support for Congressman Bonilla. This is not --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does that undermine\nthe assumption that there's -- they're voting as a\nbloc? 30 percent of the group is voting for one\ncandidate. Is that sufficient to establish a voting\nbloc?\nMS. PERALES: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. Under\nsection 2's question with respect to racially polarized\nvoting, we would contend that voting as a bloc 70\npercent or subsequently higher than 70 percent to 90-92\npercent is enough under section 2 to satisfy the test\nwhether Latinos are voting cohesively. Congressman\nBonilla has never been able to garner a majority of\nLatino support, not more than 30 percent.\nBut with respect to a somewhat different\nquestion, which is whether partisanship and race\ncorrelate so highly in district 23, that you can remove\nLatinos and in the hopes of being able to take the\nDemocratic index down, we say that that kind of voting\nis not tight enough. In Easley v. Cromartie, of\ncourse, the Court found that African American voters\nvoted 95 to 97 percent for Democratic candidates across\nelections.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand. Does\nthis go to motive or result? I mean, what if I'm --\nI'm stupid and I think there's the correlation and I\nremove it for that reason? I'm not removing them for\nracial reasons. I'm removing them because I want to\nremove Democrats. And you're saying that if I have\nmade a mistake about how solidly they vote Democratic,\nthat turns my validly non-racial decision into a racial\ndecision?\nMS. PERALES: This Court made clear in Bush\nv. Vera that the State may not make exactly the kind of\nassumption, Justice Scalia, that you described. The --\nthe Court held in Bush v. Vera that you cannot use race\nas a proxy for partisanship. You cannot make that\nassumption. So if the State --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but -- but that was\nbecause it was deliberate in that case, and that's not\nthe hypothetical that Justice Scalia has posed.\nMS. PERALES: In this case, we contend that\nthe State removed Latino voters from district 23\nbecause they were Latino and that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's not the\nhypothetical that was posed to you by the Justice.\nMS. PERALES: That if the State --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm assuming --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: As I -- as I understood it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- they're removing them\nbecause they're Democrats, but I'm wrong about that.\nMS. PERALES: Then it is still wrong to take\nout 100,000 Latinos using that assumption. I mean, the\n-- the act that was done was to slice through the most\nLatino county in the United States, 95 percent Latino.\nThe people were not removed anywhere else. Clearly,\nthe State removed Latinos from this district and then\nsaid, well, we did it because we were aiming for\nDemocrats.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But is it -- is it wrong\nunder the Equal Protection Clause or is it wrong under\nsection 2?\nMS. PERALES: It's wrong under both, we would\nargue in our brief.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No. But on Justice --\nJustice Scalia's hypothesis, there is no intention to\nremove Latinos as Latinos. And maybe the answer to\nthat is if you're removing Latinos, it does not matter\nwhether your motivation is invidious or not. I don't\nknow whether that's your position. But it -- if that's\nnot your position, then I think there's got to be a\ndifference between the -- the Equal Protection Clause\nanalysis and the section 2 analysis.\nMS. PERALES: We contend that in this case\nthe removal is invidious because it was Latinos that\nwere identified and taken out and then -- for\nincumbency protection, similar to what --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, is that because there\nwere no other Democrats who could have been identified\nand taken out?\nMS. PERALES: There's no testimony that the\nState considered ever taking out anybody else but the\npeople in Webb County.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you said that the\ncounty was 92 percent Latino or something like that.\nMS. PERALES: Yes, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, how can you -- how can\nyou possibly take out any substantial number of\nDemocrats without taking out Latinos?\nMS. PERALES: That's exactly our point, that\nthe State removed --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's my point too.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. PERALES: Moving to what I -- the point\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I -- can I -- I\ndon't understand -- I think your argument is at cross\npurposes. I mean, the one point -- and you're making\nthe point that the Democrats do not vote overwhelmingly\nfor the Democratic candidate. They voted as much as 30\npercent for Bonilla. But the Voting Rights Act is\nconcerned with whether or not a group voting ethnically\nas a bloc can vote for candidates of its choice. Well,\nif they're 30/70, it's not -- it's hard to think of\nthem as having a clear candidate of choice. So what\ndoes it matter whether they're in or out?\nMS. PERALES: I agree, Mr. Chief Justice, but\nunder the facts of this case, what had happened by 2002\nwas something very, very different. After 1996, when\nMr. Bonilla garnered the high of 30 percent among\nLatino voters, not -- not in his district but among\nthat group --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, the percentage\ngoes up, the percentage goes down.\nMS. PERALES: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It depends on who's\nrunning against him. At the low point, there was a\npopular Hispanic candidate running against him in some\nof those elections.\nBut it seems to me that the predicate for\ncoverage under the Voting Rights Act that a particular\ngroup is being denied the opportunity to elect a\ncandidate of its choice doesn't even come into play if\nyou're right that the -- the vote is split over time,\ndepending on the circumstances in a particular\nelection.\nMS. PERALES: No, Mr. Chief Justice, because\nthis is bloc voting at rates of 70 percent or higher,\nand after 1996, that 70 percent bloc went to 80 percent\nand then it went to 90 percent. And as the voters\nbecame increasingly disenchanted, I suppose, with the\nincumbent, that decline was steady. It didn't\nfluctuate up and down. It was going down and it went\ndown even farther. Mr. Bonilla was always opposed by a\nLatino candidate in each of his general elections that\nhe's had since he's been elected. So that hasn't\nreally been a factor for the voters. But as they\nbecame more cohesive and they reached 55 percent of the\n-- the registration in the district, they were poised\nto elect their candidate of choice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then -- well,\nbut then -- and this is why I say it's an argument at\ncross purposes. If you're right about that, then the\nassumption that the Hispanic voters are going to be\nvoting Democratic is not one that was unfounded, which\nI thought was your -- your first point.\nMS. PERALES: We would contend, Mr. Chief\nJustice, that voting against Congressman Bonilla\ndoesn't make you a Democrat. And it, in fact,\nhighlights that the State was seeking voters, Latino\nvoters, who had withdrawn their support for Congressman\nBonilla as opposed to just seeking Democrats because you\ncan vote against Congressman Bonilla and still vote\nRepublican in other races, as Latinos did. And you\ncould have been a former supporter of Congressman\nBonilla. It doesn't make you a Democrat in that sense\nthat race and partisanship are completely\ninterchangeable so that the State can scoop in and grab\n100,000 people of the same race and then say later,\nwell, we were taking out Democrats.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not just the\nState that's saying it, though. You have a district\ncourt finding that ethnicity was not the predominant\nfactor, that politics was the predominant factor.\nMaybe -- as Justice Scalia suggests, maybe they were\nright, maybe they were wrong, but the point was that it\nwas being done for political purposes not for ethnic\npurposes.\nMS. PERALES: We agree, Mr. Chief Justice,\nthat the end goal was political in the sense of\nincumbency protection, but a State may not use race as\nthe means to the end of protecting an incumbent. What\nhappened here was that the only group of voters who had\nshifted their support away from Congressman Bonilla\nwere Latino. Democrats had never voted for Congressman\nBonilla. The problem inside this district was not a\nproblem of Democratic voters. It was Latino voters who\nhad supported him and withdrawn.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, can -- can the State\nuse race as the means to an end of electing a new\ncandidate that the race wants? And what should be the\ndifference?\nMS. PERALES: It should turn on the candidate\nof choice --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, it sounds like\nyou're going to say race cannot be used as this basis,\nbut how can race be used not to protect an incumbent\nbut to allow the group to choose the representative of\nits choice and then reelect him every year?\nMS. PERALES: Well, district 23 was created\nby the Balderas court pursuant to a finding under\nsection 2. So it was a remedial district under section\n2 when it was created in 2001. And in 2002, when it\nwas used as a remedial district, it -- it elected a\nLatino-preferred candidate in 13 out of 15 elections,\naccording to the State's expert, and came very close to\nunseating Congressman Bonilla. The State's response\nwas essentially to punish Latino voters for voting\nagainst Congressman Bonilla by slicing them out of the\ndistrict. So the State used race to achieve its end of\n-- of incumbency protection.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, if the -- if the\nobjective is just to get rid of voters who vote\nagainst Congressman Bonilla, why is that an equal\nprotection violation? It's not done for -- for race or\nethnicity, but just to get rid of voters who vote against\nhim.\nMS. PERALES: Because the group of voters who\nhad withdrawn their support were Latino voters. The\ndistrict court discusses the -- the interrelationship\nof these phenomenon in its opinion at jurisdictional\nstatement appendix 128 when it says, the State acted to\nshore up the incumbency of Congressman Bonilla, and the\nnext sentence is, his support among Latino voters had\ndropped to 8 percent. It was, in fact, the -- the\nvoting behavior of Latinos as opposed to anybody else\nwho had caused the incumbency crisis, and it was\nLatinos as Latinos who were removed from the district.\nAt the same time, however, the redistricters\nsat down and figured out exactly how many Latinos they\nwanted to leave inside this district to achieve a bare,\nrazor-thin Latino voting age majority population, and\nthat was done to give the impression of Latino support\nfor the incumbent. The chief redistricter --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that -- and what\nrelevance does that have? What provision of the\nConstitution prevents you from leaving a majority of\none group in a district to create the impression that\nthe district supports a particular candidate?\nMS. PERALES: The Fourteenth Amendment, Mr.\nChief Justice, race may --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's what the\nFourteenth Amendment was passed for, to avoid creating\nthe impression that a particular group supports a\nparticular candidate?\nMS. PERALES: This Court has held that race\nmay not be used for its own sake in redistricting, and\nhere race was used most gratuitously and cynically to\nmake sure that the State could say a majority of\nLatinos in district 23 support Congressman Bonilla.\nThe chief redistricter in the House, Representative\nPhil King, testified -- and this is expressed motivation\n-- that they sought to maintain a 50 percent Latino\nvoting age majority in the district while making it\nsafer for Congressman Bonilla, which involved pulling\n100,000 Latinos out.\nSimilarly --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And how many -- what\npercentage would they have shifted from making it look\nlike a Hispanic opportunity district with about 51\npercent to when it would actually be one? What\npercentage does it shift from being looking like one to\nbeing one, both above a majority?\nMS. PERALES: Oh, yes, Mr. Chief Justice, but\n-- but quite a distance. The -- as the Balderas court\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But what's the\nnumber?\nMS. PERALES: The voting age population for\ndistrict 23, as created by the Balderas court, Your\nHonor, was a great deal higher. It was 63 percent, and\nthat was what was able to give the 55 percent voter\nregistration --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that your number?\nIt has to -- anything short of 63, it's just looking\nlike it? I mean, really, you're asking us to draw a\nvery fine line between a -- in each case a majority\nHispanic voting age district, but in one case, it's a\nconstitutional violation and in the other case, it's --\nit's required by the Voting Rights Act. So what is the\nmagic number between 51 and 63?\nMS. PERALES: We would argue that race cannot\nbe used for its own sake, that if you're going to put\npeople together into a Latino majority district, it\nshould be to meet a purpose, for example, to create an\nopportunity district under the Voting Rights Act.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What's the number?\nMS. PERALES: That would be -- well,\ndepending on how many people it takes in that\nparticular district to elect a candidate of choice. In\nthis case it was 63 percent. It might be a different\nnumber for a different district. But your --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if this district\nwere drawn with 60 percent, you would say that's just\nto make it look like a Hispanic district?\nMS. PERALES: No, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. So what's the\nnumber? It's -- it's somewhat more than 51 percent\nbecause you're saying that's a constitutional\nviolation, and I want to know how many more it takes\nbefore it becomes what's required under the Voting\nRights Act.\nMS. PERALES: Maybe I can answer the question\nby going around to the court's finding, which was that\ndistrict 23 was created not as a Latino opportunity\ndistrict, that it would not operate to offer the\nopportunity to elect the Latino preferred candidate.\nAnd the -- and the district court found this on page\n145-146 of our appendix to the jurisdictional statement.\nAnd in that same paragraph, they said, but it has a\npolitical nuance that Congressman Bonilla will be elected\nfrom a Latino majority district.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm just trying to\nget a number. If you're asking us to rule on a\nconstitutional violation, I'm asking to find out what\nthe number is that changes it from a political nuance\nto a Hispanic opportunity.\nMS. PERALES: That number would be the number\nthat shows Latinos have the opportunity to elect their\ncandidate of choice. It will be a different number for\neach district, but it would always be in the evidence\nof the case because the analysis is done on different\ndistricts.\nHere, all of the experts agreed that district\n23 had been created so that it would not elect a Latino\ncandidate of choice, but that the State testified that\nit wanted to keep it voting age majority, that they did\nso because they wanted Henry Bonilla to run from a\nLatino majority district. The State abandoned\ntraditional redistricting criteria to do so,\nredistricting at the bloc level and splitting 6\nelection precincts out of 51 in Webb County, which is\nwholly unnecessary even to equalize population in\neither district. There is no reason for the State --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would it have been\nbetter --\nMS. PERALES: -- to have done that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- would it have been\nbetter in your view if they had excluded more Hispanics\nso it didn't look like a Hispanic opportunity district?\nMS. PERALES: Well, the State certainly could\nhave moved Webb County whole out of the district. It\ndepends on how they would have done the overall --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And -- and that would\nhave been preferable. It would have been preferable to\nyou if it was, say, 45 percent Hispanic rather than\n50.8, or whatever it was.\nMS. PERALES: Mr. Chief Justice, it -- it\njust doesn't hang on a particular number. It -- it\nturns on whether or not the district is an opportunity\ndistrict, and if it isn't an opportunity district, why\nis the State sitting down and using race for its own\nsake to be able to say we got 50.9 percent Latino\nvoting age population? We managed to zigzag that\nboundary through the streets and -- and through the\nneighborhoods of the City of Laredo so that we could\nsay it was a Latino majority district.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, isn't -- isn't one\nanswer that we were doing it, number one, because we\nwanted to protect the incumbent and we also had to use\nrace to avoid a section 5 problem and a section 2\nclaim? You've got to use race for those purposes.\nMS. PERALES: Well, under section 5, the\nState went ahead and created district 25 as the offset\nbecause it seemed fairly clear that district 23 had\nbeen dismantled to such a degree it was no longer going\nto be able to be used for section 5 purposes.\nSimilarly, under section 2, the State saw\nthat it was terribly vulnerable and so again tried to\nmake an offset district which caused its own problems.\nSo the use of race here to achieve the 50.9\npercent voting age majority was not to satisfy the\nVoting Rights Act, either section 5 or section 2.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So you could have used that\nreasoning to create a district in the first place, but\nyou cannot use that reasoning to create an offset\ndistrict in the second place at the same time that\nyou're trying to protect an incumbent. I think that's\nwhat you're saying.\nMS. PERALES: To create a district with 50.9\npercent voting age population here in this part of the\nState, it would be obvious that you weren't going to\nyield an opportunity district.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: In other words, you're\nsaying that would be implausible as a section 2/section\n5 justification, regardless of when you're doing it.\nIs that --\nMS. PERALES: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nMS. PERALES: Yes, most certainly.\nThis case represents an egregious use of race\nin redistricting. Without the Equal Protection Clause\nto protect minority voters, States will have free rein\nto use race to manipulate not only electoral outcomes,\nas it did here, but also the complexion of a district\nin order to be able to express some kind of symbolic --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But, of course, you want\nthem to use race to manipulate outcomes. It's just\nsometimes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You may answer.\nMS. PERALES: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nTo serve a compelling State interest, to\ncomply with the Voting Rights Act, yes, Justice Scalia,\nit is appropriate. It was not appropriate here.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms.\nPerales.\nMr. Cruz.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF R. TED CRUZ\nON BEHALF OF APPELLEES\nMR. CRUZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe central issue in resolving these various\nchallenges to mid-decade redistricting is determining\nwhich institution is constitutionally vested with the\nprimary responsibility for redistricting. Elected\nlegislatures or Federal courts.\nIn Texas, for the first time in 12 years, the\nlegislature acted to adopt a congressional\nredistricting map. That map, in turn, replaced one of\nthe most profoundly anti-majoritarian congressional\nmaps in the country with a map that reflects the\ndemonstrated preferences --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But may I ask, General\nCruz, are you talking about replacing the court-ordered\nmap or the preceding Democrat gerrymandered map?\nMR. CRUZ: The legislature replaced the\ncourt-ordered map, but the court found as a factual\nmatter that the court-ordered map, in the court's\nwords, quote, perpetuated the 1991 Democratic Party\ngerrymander, and that was the court characterizing its\nown map with the same judges.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but you don't think it\nreally perpetuated the same degree of gerrymandering\nthat was present in the earlier map, do you?\nMR. CRUZ: Well, the court's map, under the\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'm asking you.\nMR. CRUZ: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think it did? Do\nyou think --\nMR. CRUZ: Yes, we do.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- the court-ordered map is\njust as bad as the Democratic map?\nMR. CRUZ: The district court found that it\nhad blunted some of the most egregious lines, but under\nthe district court's map, 28 of 28 incumbents were\nreelected. So the identical outcome was yielded.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But is your opponent\ncorrect in saying that in six of those districts, the\nDemocrat won even though the district was majority\nRepublican?\nMR. CRUZ: That -- that is correct, and then\nthe district court --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Does that sound like a\ngerrymander?\nMR. CRUZ: It -- it depends. The districts\nwere drawn such that the Democrats who were running\nwere incumbency. And the reality of congressional\nelections is that incumbency is a tremendous advantage,\nand in the face of incumbency --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No. I was going to say I --\nif I were gerrymandering, I would absolutely want to\nleave majority other party districts in which the\npeople from the other party were voting for a candidate\nfrom my party with some regularity. I'd want to do\nthat. That's exactly what I'd want a gerrymander to\ndo.\nMR. CRUZ: And that's exactly right. These\ndistricts were drawn to protect incumbents.\nIt is notable that if one looks on a national\nlevel, the 2001 map drawn by the court led to the most\nanti-majoritarian results of any of the 50 States in\nthe Union. There were only two other States with more\nthan five Members of Congress that saw a minority of\nvoters electing a majority of the delegation, and those\nwere Illinois and Tennessee. In each of those, 49\npercent in Illinois elected one extra seat to Congress;\nin Tennessee, 48 percent. In Texas, by contrast, 45\npercent of the two-party vote and 41 percent of the\noverall State vote elected not just a one-seat\nmajority, but a two-seat majority. And so on any\nnational level, the prior map was the most profoundly\nanti-majoritarian.\nNow, this Court resolved in -- in Vieth that\nmajoritarianism is not a constitutional mandate, but\nthat being said, as Mr. Smith characterized in Vieth,\nhe characterized the fundamental principle of democracy\n-- and this is Mr. Smith's characterization -- is the\nprinciple that a majority can elect a majority of the\ndelegation.\nAnd as this Court concluded in Gaffney v.\nCummings, achieving political fairness, achieving a\nrough sense of proportionality, such that a majority\ncan elect a majority of the delegation, is not only\nlegitimate, it is salutary. It is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So I -- I wrote\nan opinion, as you know, where I was agreeing with you\non that, and I wonder if -- if then the thing to do\nwould be to say, yes, indeed, a legislature can redraw\na map to prevent a minority of the voters electing a\nmajority of the congressional delegation. But when\nthey do that, there has to be some reasonable assurance\nthat it works the same way for both parties. I mean as\na standard. I thought my standard worked before. I\nguess there wasn't that much agreement, but -- but --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- from the point of view of\n-- of taking that standard, which you agree with, I'm\nglad to say, apparently, and modifying it to be sure it\nworks out the same way for both.\nMR. CRUZ: Justice Breyer, under the standard\narticulated in your opinion in Vieth, in our judgment\nthe result would be a straightforward affirmance here\nbecause the map that was adopted is precisely what was\nadvocated in Vieth of a majority of the population\nelecting a majority of the delegation.\nThat being said, the question here is not\nwhether that is required. Indeed, it is ironic. In\n1992 the Republicans in Texas brought a political\ngerrymandering challenge to the predecessor map here,\nand that map was rejected -- that challenge was\nrejected under Bandemer, and the district court in 1992\ntold the Republican plaintiffs -- said even though this\nmay be tilted against you, there is nothing to prevent\nyou, over the ensuing decade, from running candidates,\nfrom building support, and from eventually taking\ncontrol by electing your candidates to the machinery of\ngovernment and adopting a map you deem fair.\nThat -- those words of the district court\nprove prescient because that is precisely what happened\nover the ensuing decade, and it is equally true today.\nThere is nothing in Texas to prevent the Democratic\nParty from doing the exact same thing over the ensuing\ndecade if they can command a majority of votes at the\npolls.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you this\nquestion? Assume you're correct that as a whole the\nplan is well-justified and makes gains and so forth.\nDoes that necessarily mean that every district within\nthe -- the plan is immune from constitutional attack?\nMR. CRUZ: Of course, it does not, and there\nare a variety of district-specific attacks. The\nplaintiffs have framed their partisan gerrymandering\nattack as one that focuses on the map as a whole. And\n-- and the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I understand.\nMR. CRUZ: -- and the reason for that is that\nin the Vieth decision, Justice Kennedy's concurrence\nwas the controlling concurrence, and it set out a\nstandard for subsequent partisan gerrymandering cases\nthat litigants should find a, quote, substantive\ndefinition of fairness in districting that commands\ngeneral assent.\nRather than attempt to meet that challenge,\nthe plaintiffs have refused to discuss effects at all,\nand that's not by accident because any assessment of\neffects would yield that the current plan is more fair\nthan the predecessor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And the -- the next\nquestion I wanted to ask you is that if it is possible\nthere can be a single-district challenge, what is the\njustification for the -- the cracking of district 24,\nwhich was a majority Democratic district before, into\nfive different districts, none of which would elect a\nDemocrat.\nMR. CRUZ: The legislature made a policy\njudgment, and under the decision --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But is it -- is it defended\nby anything other than political motivation?\nMR. CRUZ: There were a host of --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I mean in district 24.\nMR. CRUZ: There were a host of judgments\nabout the multiple districts that district 24 was\nbroken into, and the district court found, for example,\nthat Representative Grusendorf wanted the City of\nArlington contained in one single district. There were\na whole host of specific motivations about the\nsurrounding districts that were drawn.\nIndeed, the district court said on remand\nthat appellants' argument ignores, as it must, the\nreality that the lines are infused with the myriad\nmixtures of local politics and accommodations, often\ninconsistent with overall objectives of partisan gains.\nThat was the district court's finding on remand, that\nthere are a host of decisions here that have nothing to\ndo with partisan gain, that have to do with drawing a\nmap that are the constitutional responsibility of a\nlegislature in drawing a redistricting map.\nAppellants frame their basic challenge on\npartisan gerrymandering because they cannot look at\neffects, because any examination of substantive effects\nyields the conclusion that the current map is much more\nfair than the prior. They disavow any examination of\neffects. Instead, they frame it as solely partisan\nintent, which has never been the standard under this\nCourt's precedents. But even under that standard, they\nbase it on a simple syllogism that is found nowhere in\nthe Court's precedents, a syllogism that says because\nthere was an extant legal map in place, the\nredistricting was unnecessary. And so anytime there is\na court map, it is unnecessary redistricting.\nThe problem is appellants raise a false\ndichotomy because every legislative redistricting is\nvoluntary. Whether it is Texas in 2003 or Pennsylvania\nin 2001, the legislatures face a binary choice. They\ncan act and adopt their legislative policy preferences,\nor they can not act, in which case they know with an\nabsolute certainty that a court-drawn map will govern\nthe election that follows. In Pennsylvania, to be\nsure, it was a map that would be drawn subsequently,\nbut the decision is the same. Does the legislature act\nto embody its preferences or does it allow a court-\ndrawn map to govern the elections in the States?\nAnd I would note the consequence of the rule\nthat appellants are urging is that it would create an\nenormous incentive for the minority party in every\nState to attempt to deadlock the system, to shut down\nat the beginning of the decade any effort to adopt a\nmap because if they're able to deadlock the system, if\nthey are able, as happened in Texas, to flee the State\nand no map passes, the consequence of that -- they\nwould know for certain under appellants' rule -- is a\ncourt will draw the map. And under the Upham standard,\nthe court map will reflect the preexisting policy\njudgments of the predecessor legislature. So any\nminority party has an incentive. If they can stop it\nfrom happening at the beginning of the decade, they\nhave an incentive to seek a better map.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: A -- a minority who was a\nmajority.\nMR. CRUZ: Indeed, yes. That -- that is\npredicated upon a preference for a decade ago rather\nthan what would be adopted now.\nThe Framers chose political checks for the\nproblem of partisan gerrymandering. They assigned\nprincipal responsibility to elected State legislatures\nwhom they certainly knew would care a great deal about\npolitics, and they assigned supervisory authority to\nanother elected legislature, Congress.\nThe appellants point to a host of perceived\npolicy problems about the specter of seriatim\nredistricting of legislatures coming back every 2 years\nand tweaking the line here and tweaking the line there.\nTo the extent that is a problem, Congress is the\ninstitution constitutionally authorized to address it,\nand there is no indication that there is a looming\nthreat of seriatim redistricting. It didn't happen\nhere. It was the first time in 12 years the\nlegislature had acted.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: General Cruz, could I ask\nyou another district-specific question? Because I want\nto get it on the table and let you explain it to me.\nFocusing on district 23 for a moment, assuming for the\nmoment -- and I -- I know you probably disagree with\nthis but -- that the results of the redrawing of\ndistrict 23 violated section 2, would you say that it\nwould be a defense to that violation that the\nmotivation was actually non-racial but purely\npolitical?\nMR. CRUZ: As the hypothetical is -- is\nasked, the answer would be no. But -- but the\ndifficulty is if the motivation -- if there's a\nviolation of section 2, a political motivation does not\nexcuse it.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Not a defense.\nAnd the second question for me is that if\nthere were a violation in district 23 of section 2,\ncould it be cured by creating a district -- the\ndistrict farther to the east. I forget the number. 25\nI guess it was. Would that be a cure in your -- in\nyour judgment?\nMR. CRUZ: The Court has concluded before --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Given what the Court said\nin Shaw II.\nMR. CRUZ: Right, right, that -- that a -- a\nsection 2 violation in one area cannot be corrected\nwith a discrete change in a different area.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Right.\nMR. CRUZ: However, in De Grandy, the Court\nalso said that the assessment is the totality of\ncircumstances in the region under assessment. And in\nthe totality of circumstances, the district court made\nfactual findings against the plaintiffs that they\ncannot demonstrate were clearly erroneous. Indeed,\nthat -- that is the problem with all of the district-\nspecific claims that all of the sets of plaintiffs have\nbrought is that this was tried in a full trial. The\ndistrict court took testimony, made credibility\ndeterminations --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Except for the fact the\ndistrict court really didn't find a violation in\nsection 2. They didn't quite, as I'm suggesting, say,\nwell, given a violation on section 2, can we cure it\nand have a defense by what we do in -- in district 25.\nAnd I don't think De Grandy is an answer to that, and\nI'm not quite sure whether you said yes or no on my\nquestion.\nMR. CRUZ: If they are wholly different areas\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMR. CRUZ: -- the Court has concluded no.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMR. CRUZ: If they are --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So the argument -- the\nquestion then would be whether district 25 is a wholly\ndifferent area from district 23.\nMR. CRUZ: That's correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And what do we look\nat to determine that? I know what we said in De\nGrandy, but I mean how -- I mean, you talk about the\nsouth and west Texas. I mean, on the other hand, 23\nand 25 are actually not that close together. So how do\nwe know that we should be looking at all the way from\nEl Paso to the Gulf, as opposed to a narrower area?\nMR. CRUZ: They are not that relatively close\ntogether, but -- but that is because this region of\nTexas is -- is vast and -- and relatively lightly\npopulated. And so district 23, for example, runs 800\nmiles in length because you've got miles and miles of\n-- of desert land and open ranch land with very low\npopulation.\nThe way the Court did it in De Grandy, which\nis also the way the Court should do so here, is to look\nat what the parties agreed to and how they litigated\nthe case.\nIn this case, everyone litigated the district\n23 section 2 claim with a focus on south and west\nTexas. Indeed, what speaks volumes is that if one\nexamines the demonstration map that the GI Forum\nappellants introduced, which is at their -- their\nappendix to their jurisdictional statement, page 241,\nthat map only covered south and west Texas. They\nproposed no districts for the rest of the State. They\nwere focused --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I didn't\nunderstand Ms. Perales' argument to concern section --\ndistrict 25 at all.\nMR. CRUZ: It did not, and -- and, indeed,\nshe has never joined in the racial gerrymandering claim\nthat has been brought by the -- by the Jackson\nplaintiffs. Her claim has focused on -- as -- as it\nconcerns racial gerrymandering, not that the\nlegislature did too much of it, but -- but in a sense\nthat it should have done more. It should have been\nmore aggressive in seeking to create majority minority\ndistricts. And -- and the district court has factual\nfindings that rule against those claims.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Would a -- I'd like you to\nelaborate a little because, as I understood your claim,\nparticularly in response to Justice Stevens, you agree\nthat if 23 violated section 2, they can't make up for\nit somewhere else. You agree they can't make up for it\nparticularly when their only way is for political\nreasons. But your argument is they never violated --\nthat 23 as redrawn didn't violate section 2.\nMR. CRUZ: That's correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And the reason that it\ndidn't violate section 2, I want to know, is what?\nBecause you have the three preconditions which seem to\nbe met, and then you have some kind of -- it doesn't\nviolate section 2 from De Grandy if, despite the\npreconditions, there is some kind of overall\nproportionality. But all that is rather unclear in my\nmind, and I want to know what your view of it is.\nMR. CRUZ: There are multiple reasons,\nJustice Breyer. As an initial matter, the district\ncourt found on page 131a of the Jackson appendix to\ntheir jurisdictional statement that CD 23 was not an\neffective minority opportunity district. So that's a\ndirect finding that the -- that the old CD 23 was not\nan effective minority opportunity district.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And why was that?\nMR. CRUZ: Because the -- the data\ndemonstrated that a majority of Hispanic voters were\nnot able to elect their candidate of choice. Although\nCongressman Bonilla consistently commanded a\nsignificant percentage of Hispanic votes, he did not\ncommand a majority, and the candidate for whom a\nmajority voted did not prevail in the congressional\nelection.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But isn't that somewhat\ninconsistent with the decision to reshape the district?\nWhy did they do it then?\nMR. CRUZ: What the legislature did -- the\nlegislature's express intention was to shore up\nCongressman Bonilla's electoral chances, and -- and it\nwas explicitly because Congressman Bonilla is a valued\nmember of the delegation and the legislature made a\njudgment that they wanted to increase his margin of\nvictory. If one --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and in your view,\nthat justification allows the creation of district 25,\nwhich has, as far as Latino population, people of quite\ndifferent economic backgrounds and so forth, you know,\nthe -- the two-ended -- the district on the two ends.\nMR. CRUZ: We did not --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That -- that to me was --\nwas not discussed much in your brief, but it's a\nserious Shaw violation. And -- and the two are really\nlinked, 23 and 25, in this respect because it was by\nvirtue of what it did in 23, that the State claims a\nright to do what it did in 25.\nMR. CRUZ: We did not place our principal\nemphasis, with respect to 25, on the Voting Rights\nAct's concerns potentially raised by the alterations in\n23. That was a motivation, but it's not our principal\nmotivation. Our principal argument on 25 is that there\nare a series of factual findings the district court\nmade that are not clearly erroneous and, indeed, we\nwould submit, are -- are completely supported by the\nrecord to --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you have a -- a\nsection 5 argument with respect to district 25 as\nopposed to a section 2 argument involving district 23?\nMR. CRUZ: The legislature was certainly\nconcerned about section 5, and with respect to the\nadjustment in -- in district 23, it was possible that\nthe Department of Justice might deem the alteration of\ndistrict 23 to be something that would be retrogressive\nand, accordingly, having a district that was -- a\nperforming Hispanic opportunity district would increase\nthe chances of preclearance. So -- so that was a\nfactor in the consideration, was a desire to comply\nwith section 5 and also to comply with section 2,\nalthough section 5 was the -- the principal focus of\nthe legislative discussion.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is it permissible for\na legislature concerned with section 5 to take race and\nethnicity in account -- into account in drawing a\ndistrict?\nMR. CRUZ: This Court has never squarely\nresolved that. This Court has assumed in the racial\ngerrymandering cases, assumed without deciding, that\ncompliance with the Voting Rights Act is a compelling\ninterest. And the -- the districts that have been\nstruck down have been struck down as not being narrowly\ntailored. Although we advance that argument, we don't\nhave to prevail on that argument for district 25 to\nsurvive the racial gerrymandering claim.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And as to 23, do you want\nthis Court to say that it's constitutionally\npermissible to take away a number of minority voters\nfrom the district, but leave just enough so that it\nlooks like a minority? Is that a permissible use of\nrace? It -- it seems to me that's an affront and an\ninsult.\nMR. CRUZ: Except the district court found as\na factual matter that what happened in district 23 was\nwholly political. It was not racial, so that the\nvoters were not removed because of race. They were\nremoved because of politics.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but -- but the\nadditional finding is that 50 percent were kept to make\nit -- to make it look good.\nMR. CRUZ: The -- the legislature was aware\nof -- as this Court has said, the legislature will\nalways be aware of the racial composition of a\ndistrict. But the legislature specifically -- for\nexample, unlike Bush v. Vera, there are no bloc-level\ncuts based on race. Indeed, in district 23, what the\nlegislature did, by and large, is go straight down\nInterstate 35 which cuts right in the middle of Webb\nCounty. Now, if one considers Webb County, there --\nthere are two halves of it. There is the half that\nmoved into new district 28. Now, those voters\npresumably cannot complain about being disenfranchised\nin that. At least the Hispanic voters there are now in\na unquestionably performing Hispanic opportunity\ndistrict that elects an Hispanic Democrat to Congress.\nThe remaining voters in Webb County -- in 2004,\nCongressman Bonilla carried a majority of Webb County,\nand so it is difficult to see who is being\ndisenfranchised, given that both halves of Webb County\nare electing a Congressman for whom a majority of their\nvoters are voting.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why -- in -- in --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Go ahead. I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: In -- in contrast to that,\nhowever, you could not make that argument or -- or that\nresponse with respect to -- to district 24, the\ndistrict in which the -- the Black vote was -- was\ncracked. And in response to earlier questions from\nJustice Stevens, you -- you mentioned there were a\nnumber of motivations for dividing it up the way it\ndid, and -- and yet, as you also acknowledge, those\ndiffering motivations don't answer a -- a section 2\nargument. What is your answer to the section 2 claim?\nMR. CRUZ: Well, as you know, Justice Souter,\npurpose under the '82 amendment is irrelevant to\nsection 2. It is an effects-only test, and -- and the\ndistrict court had a series of factual findings, most\nof which appellants did not even challenge until their\nreply brief, each of which is independently sufficient\nto defeat their claim. The -- the district court found\nagainst them on all three prongs of Gingles, and those\nfindings were fully supported by the record.\nAs an initial matter, the appellants\nattempted to frame this as debating the legal question\nover whether 50 percent is an absolute barrier. The\ndistrict court concluded that it needn't resolve that\nquestion because the facts here presented no\nopportunity to determine if there might be some\ntolerable deviation below 50 percent. In this case,\nAfrican American voters in old district 24 comprise\nless than 22 percent of the voting age population.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But -- but following Georgia\nand Ashcroft, isn't -- isn't that a possibility that we\nshould consider as a satisfaction of what has come to\nbe known as the -- you know, the first of -- of the\nGingles factors?\nMR. CRUZ: In our judgment, Georgia against\nAshcroft expanded the flexibility for States to\ndetermine how to comply with the Voting Rights Act.\nGeorgia against Ashcroft obviously was a section 5\ncase, and it determined that in considering\nretrogression, that opportunity districts and influence\ndistricts should both be considered. It surely did not\nmean that there was a cause of action now for any\nplaintiff to argue that any conceivable influence\ndistrict must be drawn. That goes entirely against the\ncentral theme of Georgia against Ashcroft, which is\nthat States have flexibility in choosing a\nrepresentational model for voters in that State.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But it -- it is not\ninconsistent with Georgia and Ashcroft to say that for\n-- for much the same reason, States have less\nflexibility in cracking influence districts once they\nhave been established.\nMR. CRUZ: That might perhaps be true if the\nplaintiffs could demonstrate the other Gingles prongs,\nbut on the second and third prong, the district court\nfound that African American voter cohesion was far from\nclear and there was absolutely no cohesion between\nAfrican Americans and Hispanics in district 24.\nIndeed, they voted in an almost completely polar manner\nin Democratic primaries.\nAnd third, the district court found that\nthere was not Anglo bloc voting.\nAnd so all three of the prongs -- what the\ndistrict court found as a factual matter is that\ndistrict 24 functioned as an Anglo Democratic district.\nAnd indeed, this case is unusual in that there were\nsome extraordinary direct testimony that the way\ndistrict 24 operates is not accidental, that in 1991,\nit was explicitly drawn by Anglo Democrats for the\nspecific purpose of electing Anglo Democrats and only\nAnglo Democrats. And that was testimony not from a\nState witness but from Congresswoman Eddie Bernice\nJohnson, a Democratic African American incumbent from\nthe adjoining district who was in the State legislature\nin 1991, and she said the African American population\nthere was deliberately split up to create a district\nthat would be -- elect white Democrats. That direct\ntestimony is extraordinary and it shows that what the\ndata demonstrate, which is that white Democrats control\nthe district -- and that's what the district court\nfound as a factual matter -- is not an accident. It\nwas precisely the intended effect of the map-drawers.\nIndeed, if one looks to the three races that\nthe appellants' experts examined that were African\nAmerican versus Anglo in the primaries, of those three\nraces, an African American candidate of choice who was\nBlack prevailed in only one.\nOf the 20 races appellants' experts examined,\nof those 20, only one Black candidate prevailed, and\nthat case, the district court found, was aberrational\nbecause that candidate was Ron Kirk. He was a former\nmayor of the City of Dallas. He was a very popular,\nlocal politician with a strong friends and neighbors\neffect.\nIf you take that aberrational case out, the\ntwo other cases appellants' experts looked to both\nshowed that the African American candidate, one of whom\nwas supported by 76 percent of African American voters,\nlost. And indeed, what happened was the Anglos and the\nHispanics voted in virtual unison against the African\nAmerican candidate.\nThat data -- if one looks to the endogenous\nraces, there had never been an African American\nopponent to Martin Frost, or the exogenous races, those\nthree we talked about -- the data demonstrate quite\npersuasively that African Americans were drawn into a\ndistrict where they did not have an equal opportunity\nto elect their candidate of choice because they lacked\nthe ability to elect a Black candidate. Now, they\ncould choose to do otherwise, but in this district,\nthey could not choose to elect a Black candidate. And\nthat was the district court's finding and that's what\nthe data demonstrated.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, can I move\nyou south and west again, back to district 23? How do\nwe tell -- as redrawn, it had what? 50.8 percent. And\nI gather that that's not considered a Hispanic\nopportunity district because of lower voting turnout,\nregistration, participation? How do we tell when\nsomething is being done to make it look like a Hispanic\ndistrict and, instead, when it's being done for the\nopportunity of providing a Hispanic opportunity\ndistrict if voter turnout and registration are\nincreased?\nMR. CRUZ: The district court made a finding\nthat the reason district 23 was altered was to increase\nthe chances of Congressman Bonilla prevailing. And in\nparticular, if one looks to Webb County, which is the\ncounty that was split, Webb County centers on the City\nof Laredo. And in 2002 -- the race that the GI Forum\nappellants focus on principally -- the candidate that\nran against Congressman Bonilla was Henry Cuellar, a\npopular, local politician from Laredo, and he had a\nvery strong following in Laredo. And as a consequence,\nMr. Cuellar did very well in that election, came within\nslightly under 4 points of beating Mr. Bonilla and Mr.\nBonilla's percentage of the -- of the Latino vote\ndropped to its lowest historic point.\nThat, as the district court found, was also\naberrational because of Mr. Cuellar's very strong local\nsupport, and the clearest evidence of that is under the\nnew map, when half of Webb County was placed in the\nadjoining district, district 28, Mr. Cuellar ran\nagainst the incumbent Democratic Congressman, Ciro\nRodriguez, and beat him in the primary, which\ndemonstrates that his success was because the -- the\nvoters in Laredo are supporters of Mr. Cuellar and,\naccordingly, voted for him against either opponent,\nHenry Bonilla or Mr. Rodriguez.\nAnd so, when the legislature was determining\nwhich section of voters to remove for political\nreasons, the region that voted heavily against Mr.\nBonilla in the preceding election, Laredo, Webb County,\nwas a natural place to move voters who had in the last\nelection demonstrated they would vote for his opponent.\nUnder any assessment of 23, the prior map had\nfive districts that were indisputably Hispanic\nopportunity districts, plus district 23 that elected\nCongressman Bonilla, an Hispanic Republican. The\ncurrent map has six districts that are indisputably\nHispanic opportunity districts, plus district 23 which\nelects Henry Bonilla. So the result is the same in\ndistrict 23, and there is an additional Hispanic\nopportunity district in district 25.\nIf I may turn to district 25 and return to\nJustice Kennedy's questions earlier about racial\ngerrymandering with respect to that district.\nThe first indicium this Court has looked to\nin racial gerrymandering case -- cases is unusual or\nbizarre shape, and on that indicium, this district does\nnot fall anywhere near the districts this Court has\nstruck down as racial gerrymanders.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, of course, the reason\nthe lines are straight is nobody is there.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. CRUZ: But those counties have to be\nplaced in some district. And -- and so the appellants\ncall a series of seven whole contiguous counties a land\nbridge, but those are very sparsely populated counties.\nIn whatever district they're in, they're going to have\nto connect with a population zone. And what the\ndistrict court found as a factual matter is that the\nelongated nature -- the relatively elongated nature of\ndistrict 25 was a function of the geography and the\nfact that you have population along the border and then\nyou have a large space of relatively low population,\nand then you have to get back up to population. So\nTexas historically has run north-south districts to get\nenough population to form a congressional district\nunder this Court's one person/one vote precedents.\nDistrict 25, if one examines -- the district\ncourt expressly found that the plaintiffs failed to\nprove purposeful discrimination. The State defendants\nintroduced at trial a Cromartie analysis that was\nprecisely drawn from this Court's first Cromartie\ndecision, Hunt v. Cromartie, and it's found on pages\n331 and 332 of the joint appendix. And what that\nanalysis did is precisely what this Court found in\nCromartie I was sufficient on summary judgment to\ndefeat a claim of racial gerrymandering.\nIt assessed the lines in Travis County, the\nnorthern part of district 25, and it asked are the cuts\nthe legislature made driven by politics or driven by\nrace. And so what the State's expert did is drew a map\nthat would be based on race that would maximize the\nHispanics in district 25 on the northern end of Travis\nCounty. He then compared that map to the map that the\nlegislature had drawn and said what are the differences\nbetween what it would look like if the legislature was\nattempting to maximize race as compared to what it\nwould look like if it was attempting to maximize party.\nAnd what the State's expert found is there was on the\norder of a 1 percent differential which is you're\ntalking between 24 and 25 percent. So it was about 4\npercent differential of fewer Hispanics in the State's\nmap and more Democrats in the State's map. And so what\nthe State's expert found is precisely along the lines\nas the evidence in Cromartie I that the legislature had\ndrawn the map looking for Democrats rather than looking\nfor Hispanics.\nIn addition, if one examines the two\nnumerical measures of compactness, smallest circle and\nperimeter to area, smallest circle this map measured\n8.5, which is smaller than North Carolina's\nreconfigured district 12 upheld in Cromartie, which was\n8.6 Its perimeter-to-area score, 9.5, is terribly low.\nAs a -- as a means of comparison, districts 18, 29,\nand 30 that this Court struck down in Vera had\nperimeter-to-area scores of 106, 144, and 69, as\ncompared to district 25's score of 9.5.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: General Cruz, if you've\nfinished your answer -- I didn't want to interrupt you,\nbut that makes -- reminds me of a question I wanted to\nanswer you because -- ask you, rather, because you make\na very persuasive argument in your brief, which I found\nvery helpful, that the -- a State should be able to\ncorrect a prior gerrymander by -- for -- with political\nmotivations.\nI would like you to comment on this\nsuggestion. Supposing we said they have an absolute\nright to do that with one caveat, that any new district\nhas to be more compact -- no more -- no less compact\nthan its predecessor, wouldn't that avoid all sorts of\nproblems?\nMR. CRUZ: That could be a salutary policy\ngoal, and -- and Congress could certainly enact that.\nBut I -- I see no -- no source in the Constitution\nplacing that requirement upon States particularly --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: We have -- we have quite a\nhistory, as you just identified in your response to\nJustice Kennedy, of being concerned about particularly\ngrotesque shapes, and that's why they developed these\ntests of compactness for use in this very litigation.\nAnd the fact that the lawyers have come up with this\napproach to it makes me think maybe it does have some\nrelevance to the whole problem we're trying to\nconfront.\nMR. CRUZ: At an extreme level, lack of\ncompactness can indicate something was going on. If\none looks at the districts this Court has struck down,\nif you look at Bush v. Vera -- and we have in the joint\nappendix the silhouettes of those districts that were\n-- you know, had fingers going out in every direction.\nThere's plainly something questionable going on.\nThese districts are nothing like that.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: When I -- when I was\nthinking about this problem, I looked at district 24.\nThe thing that was interesting to me is that most of\nthe neutral justifications that you describe -- and\nthey're certainly in the -- in the five new districts\nthat replaced it, but in the key part of the population\nthat was moved, it becomes much less compact than it\nwas before.\nMR. CRUZ: The -- the new map --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Which it seems to me quite\nsignificant.\nMR. CRUZ: The -- the new map was somewhat\nless compact than the prior map, but it does --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And its particularly --\nparticular reference to the targeted group that was\nmoved out of the district.\nMR. CRUZ: But lack of compactness does not\n-- no one has brought a racial gerrymandering claim\nwith respect to districts other than 25 and, to some\nextent, 23, although the 23 challenge is not a typical\nracial gerrymandering claim.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'm suggesting the\nchallenge to 24 should be a political gerrymandering\nchallenge.\nMR. CRUZ: I understand that, although a\nmajority of the Court in Vieth concluded that in order\nfor a political gerrymandering claim to succeed, that\nthere must be a substantive standard for fairness to\nmeasure the map against some baseline.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, Justice Stevens --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And that's the standard I'm\nsuggesting. Right. That's exactly the point.\nMR. CRUZ: But --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The compactness standard.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMR. CRUZ: But the Court had before it --\nappellants urged in Vieth compactness, principles of\ncracking, principles of packing. One of the dissenting\nJustices advocated that standard, and yet, a majority\nof the Court -- the plurality explicitly rejected it.\nAnd Justice Kennedy's concurrence explicitly rejected\nthe standards discussed in the dissents, including a\nstandard looking to compactness.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure that Justice\nStevens is suggesting that as a standard. He's\nsuggesting it as a disqualifier. If it's not as\ncompact, it's no good, but if it is as compact, he's --\nI -- I don't think he's suggesting it's okay. So we\nstill don't have a standard.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No. I was suggesting that\nwould be a safe harbor, and -- and it would just --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: A safe harbor from an\nunknown standard.\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Jump in whenever you\nwant.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. CRUZ: Under any standard that looks to\nthe substantive lines on the map, anything that -- and\nwe have spent hours racking our brains trying to think\nof a standard for litigation purposes that would yield\nthe old map being more fair than the new one. We're\nnot aware of any coherent standard that looks to\nsubstance.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Let -- let me ask you this.\nSuppose you have a court that's required to\nredistrict, and the court has two experts. Expert\nnumber one says, here is a plan. It's totally partisan\nin its orientation, but it balances the Democratic and\nthe Republican registration. It gives them exactly\nproportional representation. Plan number two gives\nminimal consideration to this, but it's compact. It\ntakes into account geography, communities of interest,\nand so forth. Would the district court be in error if\nit adopted the first plan?\nMR. CRUZ: Well, that -- that question\nactually was litigated in this case, the first time in\n2001, as part of the litigation over how to draw the\nnew map. One of the arguments that was presented to\nthe district court was that the old map was no longer\nconsistent with how Texas voters were voting. And the\ndistrict court concluded that under the Upham case, it\nlacked the authority to take that into account and to\nchange the demonstrated policy preferences of the last\nlegislative map. And that's why, on remand in this\ncase, the district court found although it didn't\nintend to work partisan bias, that that was the effect\nof its map.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but my hypothetical\nis designed to suggest that partisanship, political\nlines should be certainly a secondary consideration to\na valid principled scheme and that perhaps in the\nhypothetical case, you could reverse a district court\nfor abuse of discretion in -- in overemphasizing\npolitical considerations. And then if that's true, it\nmeans that there is some standard lurking out there\nindicating that political considerations should be of\nat least secondary importance.\nMR. CRUZ: In this case, the district court\nwas presented with maps that would be more fair on --\non pretty much any measure of partisanship, and what\nthe district court concluded is it didn't have the\nability -- that making that judgment was a political\njudgment, and it was the legislature's job to do it.\nAnd so it drew in the districts it was required to draw\nbecause Texas had two new districts. It drew in what\nit believed the Voting Rights Act required, and beyond\nthat, it made as few changes as possible.\nAnd so the district court recognized that the\nconsequence of that map-drawing technique is whatever\npartisan bias was there before is reflected in its own\nmap that just neutrally carries over the preexisting\nbias. And that's why the district court found it was\nperpetuating the prior bias, not because it intended to\ndo so, but because it was consciously restraining\nitself from doing anything to alter the partisan\ncomposition other than to carry over what was already\nthere.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What -- district 24. I take\nit -- it's a long walking stick is what it looks like.\nAnd the -- I take it you're saying when I go back to\nthe record here, I'll discover a finding that the\ndistrict court made. They said this was not an effort\nto use race to district. Is that right?\nAnd one of the reasons that you think that is\nbecause, although it's not a circle, it's not\nabsolutely terrible. That -- that is a supporter of\nthe ultimate conclusion they did not use race. Is that\nright?\nMR. CRUZ: Justice Breyer, that's -- that's\nexactly correct --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then -- then if I -- if I --\nso I have to go back, look at the record, and see what\nit says.\nNow, suppose I came to a different\nconclusion. Then you might still win on this point if\nthe rationale for using race to district was because we\nwant to avoid a section 2 violation. And there, you\nwould lose, however, because you can't use that\nrationale unless, according to Bush v. Vera, the\ndistrict that you draw is, in their words, reasonably\ncompact. So, again, you'd have to say that this\ndistrict that looks like a walking stick is reasonably\ncompact for that other purpose. Is that right?\nMR. CRUZ: Well, although we would submit\nthis district is reasonably compact.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, so I understand that.\nBut -- but if -- if I -- you have two bites at this\napple with your reasonably compactness. One, you want\nto say it wasn't -- you think this proves it wasn't to\nuse race in the first place, but if I'm wrong on that,\nit's still a legitimate use of race because it's a\nreasonably compact effort to conform with section 2.\nMR. CRUZ: Justice Breyer, you're correct\nthat if the Court concludes this district is not\nreasonably compact, then under its precedents, it\nwouldn't be a narrowly tailored way to satisfy a voting\nrights violation, but --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And is there anything I can\nlook to to decide what reasonably compact means in that\nsecond --\nMR. CRUZ: Well, the district court's finding\nwas that Texas geography and population dispersion\nlimit the availability of district compactness in\nsouthern and western regions of the State, and that was\nat the Jackson jurisdictional statement, page 154a. So\nthat's -- there's -- there's a challenge in Texas\nbecause you've got these --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're talking about\ndistrict 25. Right?\nMR. CRUZ: 25, yes. Yes, we're talking about\n25.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, 25.\nMR. CRUZ: 25 has seven whole counties and\nonly two county splits, which is unusual. Most of the\ncases that this Court has struck down what it's\nperceived to be racial gerrymanders have been a number\nof county splits. In this case, the county splits --\nthose were mandated to -- because we have achieve\nperfect equipopulosity, so we had to get exactly,\nwithin one person, precise lines. But within -- in\nbetween the two, they are whole contiguous counties\nthat are longstanding geographic units.\nThe testimony is clear that the -- the\nlegislature made no effort to avoid Anglo voters. It's\nnot like they snaked around. And even the lean of it\nis a simple fact that the Gulf of Mexico leans like\nthis, and it follows the geographic boundaries of the\nState, so that if one examines this district next to\nthe other districts, it follows historic lines that\nhave been used in Texas.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: General Cruz, why wouldn't\nit be a -- at least a helpful guide to what is\nreasonably compact to compare with the preceding\ndistrict? Now, that fits 24 but not necessarily 25 I\nunderstand. Wouldn't that make -- make sense if the\nreasonable compactness is -- is one of the tests?\nMR. CRUZ: One could certainly compare the\npreceding district, and with respect to the preceding\ndistrict, the differential is -- is not great. It is\nsomewhat more compact.\nBut there were other policy agendas the\ndistrict court --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: When you're carved out of a\ncouple of preceding districts, which is the preceding\ndistrict? I mean, isn't -- isn't that a problem with\nthat test?\nMR. CRUZ: That -- that is a certainly a\nchallenge.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I suppose if you have a\nplaintiff suing, it would be the one he lives in.\nMR. CRUZ: You know, if you compare, for\nexample, district 25's perimeter-to-area score is 9.6.\nYou know, if -- if one looks at, for example, the plan\n1385 submitted by GI Forum, that has one plan, district\n-- one district, district 28, with a higher perimeter-\nto-area score of -- of 10.0. And indeed, the district\ncourt found as a factual matter that the demonstration\nplan submitted by the GI Forum appellants was -- was\nless compact and critically would not perform.\nGoing back to the section 2 question about\ndistrict 23, the district court found that one district\nin the demonstration plan, district 28, had only a bare\nmajority of citizen voting population, 50.3 percent,\nand there was undisputed testimony that for a district\nto perform in this region, it had to have --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why did they have --\nwhy did have just 50.3 percent?\nMR. CRUZ: Because the Hispanic population is\ndispersed enough that one can't -- one can't draw --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They're doing that to\nmake it look like whoever was elected had Hispanic\nsupport in that district? Is that --\nMR. CRUZ: We did not ascribe motives to\nthem. They -- they drew it to demonstrate that -- that\nyou could draw a district with a bare majority of\ncitizen voting population, although their experts also\ntestified that a bare majority will not elect in this\nregion because of lower voter -- voter turnout.\nJUSTICE BREYER: On the -- either it is\nreasonably compact or it isn't. If it is reasonably\ncompact, we never get into Bush v. Vera, whatever, the\nVera case in the first place. And if it isn't, you\ncan't get out of it by saying it's an effort to cure a\nsection 2 violation.\nMR. CRUZ: Correct, but with respect to the\nquestion of racial gerrymandering, this Court's\nquestion is, is race the predominant motivation?\nThere's a direct factual finding by the district court\nthat it was not. Indeed, the district court said that\nthe -- that the measures of compactness, examined in\nrelationship to the geography and population, reflect\nthe sheer size and population distribution of this\narea, rather than a calculated stretch to find voters\nof a particular ethnic makeup.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You mean 25 -- the -- the\nLatino makeup of 25 is accidental?\nMR. CRUZ: It is a function of the population\nin south and west Texas.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's accidental.\nMR. CRUZ: The -- it is not accidental in the\nsense that the legislature was unaware of it, and as this\nCourt has said, whenever a legislature is districting,\nit is aware of the -- the racial distribution. But it\nwas drawing an additional district there, and the\ndistrict court found that in drawing those lines, it\ndid not reach out to segregate voters on either side\nbased on race, that that was not its intent and that\nwas not the effect of what it in fact drew.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What -- what do you say to\nMs. Perales' argument that the -- the numbers are just\ntoo precise to have been reflective of anything but a\nracial motivation, and that, therefore, the -- the\ndistrict court's finding was clearly erroneous?\nMR. CRUZ: Well, that -- that concerns\ndistrict 23, and -- and --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Aren't they equally precise\nhere?\nMR. CRUZ: No. District 25 is -- has a -- a\nlarge majority on Hispanic voting age population and\nalso citizen voting age population.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I -- I misspoke. Okay.\nMR. CRUZ: With respect to district 23,\nthere's an unusual aspect to the GI Forum appellants'\nargument in that it's unlike a typical racial\ngerrymandering claim where they say you're -- you're\nseeking to draw lines based on race. She's arguing\nthey should have been more aggressive drawing lines on\n-- based on race, which is -- which is not an argument\nthat sounds in the Shaw line of cases. What the\ndistrict court found is that it was purely a political\nmotivation that drew that decision, and if one is\nlooking to the Voting Rights Act, under any assessment,\nthe district is performing identically as it did\nbefore.\nAnd on the totality of circumstances, either\nbased on the region, in which case their argument --\nargument is one for maximization -- they have six of\nseven districts. They're arguing they're entitled to\nseven of seven districts -- or on a statewide basis,\nthe district court found totality of the circumstances\nwas met.\nWith respect to district 24, the findings --\nthe -- two of the three findings, with respect to Anglo\nbloc voting and cohesion, the appellants have made no\nattempt to get around other than in their reply brief,\nthey have -- have briefly challenged them. But it was\ntheir own expert who provided the information that the\ndistrict court found credible, that there was no\ncohesion, that African Americans couldn't elect their\ncandidate of choice. And it is undisputed that in new\ndistrict 9, African Americans can elect their candidate\nof choice. And so from a statewide -- from a totality\nof circumstances perspective, the ability to elect a\ncandidate of choice for African Americans in the State\nis higher under this map than it was in the preceding\nmap.\nIn sum, the basic question here is whether\ncourts or legislatures are the principal decision-\nmakers. If appellants' proffered rule is adopted, it\nremoves the safety valve that the Constitution\nprovided. It is rarely employed because it is rare\nthat one finds a plan so out of step with the\ndemonstrated preferences of voters for a decade. We\nare aware of no other plan that allowed a minority of\nvoters who never crossed the 44 percent threshold to\ncontrol the majority of the delegation. We're aware of\nno other map in the country.\nAnd so if there is a standard that this is\nimpermissible, that consequence would either elevate\ncourts above legislatures, contrary to the\nconstitutional text and to 4 decades of this Court's\nprecedents, or if it looks to substance, it would call\ninto question the districts in a host of other\ndistricts because on any objective measure, the\ndistricts in Texas are fair as a partisan matter,\ncompared to the other States, compared to the\npredecessor map, compared to any metric that one\napplies. Indeed, the social scientists say, based on\nthe seats/votes curve, that given that Republican\nvoters are currently voting at roughly 60 percent for\nRepublican candidates, one would expect a higher\npercentage of Republican candidates elected than --\nthan what this map is yielding. And so on any coherent\nmeasure of a substantive measure of fairness, this map\nshould survive.\nIf there are no further questions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Cruz.\nMr. Garre.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING APPELLEES\nMR. GARRE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThe United States' participation in this case\nis addressed to the Voting Rights Act issues, and our\nposition is that the district court properly concluded\nthat the 2003 plan does not unlawfully dilute minority\nvoting strength in either the Dallas/Fort Worth area or\nthe south and west region of the State. The district\ncourt based that conclusion on factual findings that\nare entitled to great respect on appeal and that\npreclude appellants' section 2 claims under this\nCourt's decisions.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you if you agree\nwith General Cruz, that if the results of the 20 --\nsection -- district 23 violated section 2, it would not\nbe a defense that was politically motivated?\nMR. GARRE: I -- I think that's right,\nJustice Stevens, insofar as --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And would you also agree\nwith the second question I asked as to whether if it\nwere a violation -- I understand you don't think it was\n-- it would not be a defense that they were able to\ncreate a district -- a Hispanic district in another\npart of the State.\nMR. GARRE: Well, that's true in the context\nthat the Court said it in the Shaw II case, but we\ndon't think that the principle of Shaw II would apply\nto the section 2 claim in the south and west part of\nTexas in this case. And that's because in Shaw II, the\nCourt found a violation in the southern part of the\nState and considered the question as to whether a\ncreation of a district in a completely different part\nof the State, the middle of the State with no\nconnection, would remedy the section 2 violation, and\nthe Court said no.\nThis case deals with a section 2 claim which\nis addressed to a particular region of the State, a\nregion that's marked by its high concentration of\nHispanic citizen voting age population, as well as\ncommon geography and other factors. And we know that\nthe claim is addressed to that particular region of the\nState because that -- that region is the focus of the\nplaintiffs' demonstration plan. Mr. Cruz referred to\nit. It's at page 241 of the GI Forum jurisdictional\nstatement. That's the plan that they claim they're\nentitled to under section 2 of the Voting Rights Act,\nand it's addressed to the entire part of the State.\nSo in that situation where you've got a claim\nwhere you have a -- a Voting Rights Act section 2 claim\naddressed to a particular region of the State, we don't\nthink that the Shaw II principle would come into a play.\nHere, we don't think there's any section 2 violation\nwith respect to the elimination of --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is that based on the\npremise that section -- that district 25 and district\n23 are in the same part of the State?\nMR. GARRE: Yes, not just the same part of\nthe State, but a part of the State that falls within\nthe section 2 -- within the focus of the plaintiffs'\nsection 2 claim, and a part of the State that's marked\nby its high concentration of minority citizen voting\nage population.\nIn -- in the De Grandy case, this Court\nconfronted a very similar problem where you had one\npart of the State, the Miami-Dade area of Florida,\nwhich had a high concentration of Hispanic citizen\nvoting age population, and the State was drawing\nvarious districts in that part of the State. And the\nCourt looked to those districts and considered whether\nthere was a proportional representation of the minority\ngroup in that area and -- and found that, under the\ntotality of the circumstances, there was, and\ntherefore, there was no violation of section 2.\nHere, you have a situation where the district\ncourt found that the citizen voting age population in\nthe south and west part of the State was 58 percent,\nand that under the State's plan, Hispanics enjoyed 85\npercent majority minority districts in that area, which\nis to say, six of the seven districts under the State's\nplans were districts in which Hispanics enjoyed a\nmajority of citizen voting age population.\nThe decision within that area of where to\ndraw district lines is a decision that section 2 and\nthis Court's precedents leaves up to the States. And,\nin fact, in the De Grandy case, this Court in -- in\nparticular considered the situation where a district\nline ran through a minority neighborhood and split up\nthat neighborhood. The Court discussed it on page 1015\nof its decision. And it said that the fact that the\ndistrict line went through that neighborhood and had an\neffect on minority voters, in terms of which district\nthey went into, didn't in itself establish a section 2\nviolation.\nAnd we think the same principle would apply\nhere, where the fact that the district lines separating\ndistrict 23 and 28 in the southern part of the State\nnear Laredo splits a Hispanic neighborhood, which is,\nafter all, not -- not surprising given that the large\npercentage of the population in that part of the State\nis Hispanic, doesn't in itself establish a section 2\nviolation.\nThe plaintiffs' section 2 claim in that part\nof the State really sounds very much in a section 5\nretrogression or dismantling claim, and this Court made\nclear in the Holder v. Hall case that retrogression\nprinciples of section 5 are not applicable in section 2\ncases. And we certainly think that that principle\nholds here and that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there cases that --\nthat we've issued from this Court that address what\nhappens in a case like this where the economic\ncircumstances and many other circumstances of the two\nLatino populations are very different? The border\nHispanics and the Hispanics in Austin have very -- very\nlittle in common other than -- than the Latino\nbackground. Are there -- are there cases that address\nwhether or not these populations can be combined in --\nin order to satisfy the -- the Voting Rights Act\nrequirements?\nMR. GARRE: Well, I don't know of a --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Have we talked about that?\nMR. GARRE: -- specific case that has\naddressed that concern. I suppose it would go perhaps\nto the cohesiveness analysis under the Gingles factors.\nI mean, what -- what is clear under this\nCourt's cases and the text of section 2(b) is that the\nCourt has to take into account the totality of the\ncircumstances in the area, not just the rough\nproportion -- the existence of proportionality between\nthe Hispanic population and the number of districts in\nwhich they enjoy a majority, but all the circumstances\nthat could bear on the region.\nAnd the district court in this case conducted\nthat analysis and it found, under the totality of the\ncircumstances, that there was an -- that there was not\na section 2 violation in the south and west region of\nthe State. And we certainly think that that finding is\nentitled to respect under the clearly erroneous\nstandard that this Court applies in reviewing findings of\n-- ultimate findings of vote dilution. The Court has\n-- has said repeatedly that it will not disturb such a\nfactual finding unless it is left with the definite and\nfirm conviction that a mistake has been made, and we\ndon't think the record in this case would support such\na conclusion with respect to either the section 2 claim\nin the south and west or the section 2 claim in the\nDallas/Fort Worth area.\nAs we have explained in our brief, that claim\n-- and I'm now turning to the Dallas/Fort Worth claim\n-- fails because of the district court's finding that\nAfrican American voters in old congressional district\n24 lacked the ability to elect candidates of choice in\nthat district in the sense that they would be unable,\nin a contested election, to put their candidate, the\nAfrican American candidate, into office. That finding\ntoo is supported by ample record evidence and we think\ncould not be set aside under the standard that this\nCourt applies.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is it possible it violates\nsection 2, the following? We look at the map as it's\ndrawn. We ask the question, is there a way to redraw\nthis map so that, say, the minority group has a more\nsignificant influence for their bloc voting, et cetera,\net cetera? Gingles. Answer: Of course, there is.\nIt's the old way. And you say, well, why didn't you do\nit the old way? Well, the only reason you didn't do it\nthe old way was pure politics and that that isn't a\nsufficient justification.\nMR. GARRE: Well, I don't think that would\nbear on the typical section 2 analysis this Court\nwould apply. The -- the plaintiffs bear the burden of\ncoming in in a section 2 case, which is, after all, a\nclaim that the State is forced to draw a district in a\nparticular way, to show the demonstration district in\nwhich the three Gingles factors can be met. And this\ncase is a little bit unusual in that instead of coming\nup with a -- a new district, they've just pointed to\nthe old district, which in itself is -- is similar to\nmore of a section 5 claim.\nBut with respect to that district, the\ndistrict court failed -- failed to -- the district\ncourt found that plaintiffs failed to meet the first\nGingles precondition, which is that they could not show\nin that district that they had the ability to elect the\ncandidate of their choice because African Americans\nwere 22 percent of the population in that district, the\nthird largest racial group, and because other evidence,\nincluding the past elections in that district and\ndirect testimony of politicians with intimate\nfamiliarity of that district, supported the logical\nconclusion that a group that comprises only 22 percent\nof the electorate --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I was thinking of district\n23.\nMR. GARRE: Oh, I'm sorry. With respect to\ndistrict 23, again I -- I think the -- the framework\nfor the plaintiffs' challenge to section 23 is the\nsouth and west region of the State in a claim that they\nwere entitled to a seventh -- a seventh effective\nmajority district in that part of the State. The\nState's plan, 2003 plan, gives them six majority\nminority districts. The plaintiffs, GI Forum --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's not -- not\nincluding 23.\nMR. GARRE: Not including 23. That's right,\nMr. Chief Justice.\nThey claim that they're entitled to a seventh\nmajority minority district. The district court\nrejected that claim because it found that they had\nfailed to show that the seventh district that they drew\nwould be an effective district because it only had 50.3\npercent citizen voting age population --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When you say they\ndrew, you mean the GI Forum proposal?\nMR. GARRE: The GI Forum drew. That's right.\nAnd again, that's at page 241 of the GI Forum\njurisdictional statement.\nIt found that that district was not effective\nbecause it only had a 50.3 percent citizen voting age\npopulation, and the district court found, based on the\ntestimony that showed that Hispanics have a\ncomparatively low turnout rate in elections, that a\n50.3 percentage wouldn't do the trick to give them the\npotential to elect.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Garre.\nMR. GARRE: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Smith, you have 4\nminutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. SMITH\nON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS IN NO. 05-276\nMR. SMITH: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nAs I understand the State's argument, it is\nthat the rational, legitimate governmental purpose that\nwas served in passing a new map in 2003 was to\neliminate an anti-majoritarian map drawn by the Federal\ndistrict court in 2001. I submit to you that's an odd\nuse of the word in a couple of different senses.\nFirst of all, as the experts for both sides\nfound and as the court itself found, that -- the court-\ndrawn map was not unfair or biased in any way. It did\nnot in any way maldistribute voters in a way that --\nthat hurt -- hurt Republicans' chances to elect Members\nof Congress. So when Mr. Cruz says that the problem\nwith the old map was that a minority of voters were\ncontrolling the delegation, that is factually untrue.\nWhat happened was that Republican districts\nchose to elect moderate to conservative Members of\nCongress who happened to be affiliated with the\nDemocratic Party rather than the Republican Party, but\nthat does not mean that Democrats were controlling the\ndelegation.\nThe anti-majoritarian name is odd in another\nway because the map that replaced it, of course, is\nterribly anti-majoritarian, as the experts for both\nsides agreed. It totally flunks any -- any kind of\nstandard analysis about bias in a map to the point\nwhere it locks in 22 to 10 regardless, essentially, of\nhow anybody votes in the State of Texas, and it's going\nto produce majorities that are going to average about\n-- margins of victory that are about 40 percent in --\nfor the rest of the decade, even if the Democrats gain\nvotes over time.\nNow, it's a dangerous road we're going down,\nI submit to you, if we start authorizing this kind of\npartisan festival every couple of years adjusting the\nlines. Now, we've had three States redo their\ncongressional districts already in this decade, and if\nthis Court were to uphold this one, I think we'll start\nseeing lots and lots of other ones tit for tat around\nthe country.\nThere's another particular aspect of this\nthat I think is potentially dangerous, which is as you\nget further into the decade, the census numbers get\nolder and older and more and more out-of-date. And\nwhat the line-drawers then do is they've got the census\nnumbers over here, they know where the real people are\nover here, and they can exploit that differential using\nthe old census numbers. So it seems to me that even if\nyou're going to say there's a legitimate public purpose\nfor redrawing the lines through the decade, we ought to\nrequire the States to come up with fresh numbers. The\npopulation -- one person/one vote requirements are so\nincredibly strict in the congressional area. Simply to\nsort of assume that these people can use the old\nnumbers when they're redrawing the lines 5 years after\nthe census seems -- seems mistaken to me and it does\ninvite terrible abuse. There -- and there are\nmechanisms for getting new census numbers if the States\nreally feel it's important to do so.\nLet me then turn, if I might, quickly to\nrespond, I think, to Justice Stevens' question about\nwhat the record shows about the intent for taking the\n-- the African American community in Fort Worth and\nsending it up to Oklahoma, so to speak. That intent is\nset forth in pages 87 to 88 of the jurisdictional\nstatement appendix where the map-drawer himself -- his\ntestimony is quoted, and he explained that we had to\nfind a Republican district in the -- in the\nneighborhood that we could -- we could tack them onto\nthat could sort -- that could, quote, handle that\nparticular component of the current county population,\nwhich is to say a district sufficiently Republican that\nthey would be completely disempowered for the rest of\nthe decade.\nNow, there was -- there was a comment from\nMr. Cruz about how the district 24 was created for a\nAnglo -- Anglo Democrat to win. The district that --\nthat was talked about in the testimony was the district\ndrawn in 1991. What Mr. Cruz didn't point out was that\nin 1996, that district was completely changed by a\nFederal district court in Bush v. Vera. The old\ndistrict went way down into the southeast into the\ncountryside. The new district, which is the one you\nsee in the maps before you, was drawn by the Federal\ndistrict court. It wasn't drawn by anybody seeking to\nuphold any Anglo Democrats' opportunities.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Who was the -- who\nwas the -- the candidate in that district after the\ndistrict court plan?\nMR. SMITH: Mr. Frost continued to run in\nthat district, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, didn't the\ndistrict court say one of its criteria was preserving\nincumbency?\nMR. SMITH: That's a different Federal\ndistrict court. I was talking about the -- the Bush v.\nVera court was the one that redrew it, Your Honor, not\nthe -- not the one that's in 2001.\nThank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Smith.\n(Whereupon, at 3:00 p.m., the case in the\nabove-entitled matter was submitted.)\n"
