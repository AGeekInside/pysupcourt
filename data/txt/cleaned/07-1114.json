GOLDSTEIN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\nAs this case comes to the Court, two things\nI think are uncontested. The first is that at this\ntrial, the prosecution suppressed all of the evidence in\nits files that went to the single most important\ncontested issue of the case, and that's whether the\ndefendant was a drug addict and committed the crimes in\nan amphetamine psychosis.\nAnd the second is that as soon as the\nPetitioner found out about the suppression, he presented\nhis Brady claim to the State courts. In this --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There is also a\nthird thing that's uncontested, which is there is no\nBrady claim on the merits. That's not at all included\nin your question presented. The district court and the\ncourt of appeals concluded that there was no Brady\nviolation on the merits. I don't know what would happen\nif we sent this case back. They would conclude it\nagain.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, Mr. Chief Justice,\nthere are a couple issues that you've raised. Can I\nfirst address the question of whether it's encompassed\nwithin the question presented on the merits, because the\nquestion is, well, is this all just an academic exercise\nbecause the procedural default holding wouldn't change\nthe ultimate outcome in the case?\nThe answer is that it is, we think, fairly\nencompassed within the question presented, and I can\nexplain why, including with respect to the text of the\nquestion presented.\nThe court of appeals in this case disavowed\ndeciding the merits of the Brady claim. And let me take\nyou to the petition appendix, and that is at page 22a\nand again at 24a. So I'm just trying to walk you\nthrough what the court of appeals said at the very top\nof 22a: \"We, therefore, will not disturb our decision\nthat Cone's Brady claims are procedurally defaulted and\nnot before this court.\"\nAnd then on 24a, at the bottom of the first\nfull paragraph, the last sentence: \"We again find that\nCone's claims are procedurally defaulted and we reject\nCone's request to reconsider his Brady claims.\"\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but don't stop\nthere. On page 25a, they've been talking about those\nfederalism issues. They say: \"We need not be delayed\nby these interesting questions of federalism, however,\nbecause in all events the documents discussed in the\ndissenting opinion that were allegedly withheld are not\nBrady material.\"\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. I\nwas not going to stop, and I was going to just point out\nthe dilemma that I faced when I wrote the cert petition.\nSo, on the one hand, they disavowed deciding\nit, and then quite clearly there are some -- there are a\ncouple paragraphs there, you've start -- you've stated\none, the next paragraph says the same thing -- talking\nabout the merits of the Brady claim. So here's the\ndilemma that I faced in writing the cert petition. They\nsay they're not deciding the Brady claim, but then they\ntalk quite clearly about it. So I expressed --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but don't --\nyou've resolved your dilemma by not raising anything at\nall about the merits in the question presented?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, I\ndisagree, and let me explain why. If you go to the cert\npetition, of course, which you have in front of you,\nstarting on page 26 --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, let's start on\npage Roman xi, where the questions presented are.\nThere's nothing in there about the merits of the Brady\nclaim. It's all about the procedural objections that\nyou have.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and I --\nthe document, of course -- let's -- let's talk about the\ntext of the question presented, and then I'll give my\nexplanation. So, the question presented it says is\n\"Whether Petitioner is entitled to Federal habeas review\nof his claim that the State suppressed material evidence\nin violation of Brady v. Maryland?\" We thought --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I -- I guess what I\nwould say is you've got - habeas review of that claim\nbecause the district court decided it on the merits and\nthe court of appeals decided it on the merits.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I\nhave explained why it is, and if I can then take you to\nthe rest of the body of the cert petition. The doctrine\nthat I'm going to rely on is the question -- the issue\nis, is it fairly encompassed within the question\npresented? So the dilemma I have described to you is\nthe one I faced. The court of appeals said it wasn't\ndeciding the Brady claim, then it talked about it.\nThen -- so, in the body of the cert\npetition, which you all looked to in my experience in\ndetermining what's fairly encompassed, there are two\nheadings for the reasons for granting the writ. The one\nis the procedural one. Then starting on page 26, we\npresent the merits question of the merits of the Brady\nclaim.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. It seems to\nme you either did not raise the question or you did.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If you did not, then\nwe don't address the procedural issues that you raised.\nIf you did, then also we have to resolve the question on\nthe merits, a very fact-specific Brady claim that we\nwould not normally take without reaching those\nprocedural issues. So, I don't see why the procedural\nissues are before us.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, can\nI -- can I answer the -- finish answering my question\nabout the body of the cert petition and then come to\nthis? I'm glad to do it in whichever order. I do have\na couple of important points to make on your very\nunderstandable question about what's fairly encompassed\nwithin the question presented.\nThe particular place that I want to point\nthe Court to, so starting on 26, we lay out our argument\nabout the merits, and then footnote 6 explains quite\nclearly to the Court -- the Court sometimes has a\nconcern that parties are smuggling questions into the\ncase in front of it, and that's clearly what did not\nhappen here. We explain our dilemma about the Sixth\nCircuit saying it wasn't deciding the merits, and then\nfootnote 6, because the panel -- this is on page --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Where am I going to find\nfootnote 6?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Footnote 6 at page 30 of the\ncert petition, sir.\n\"Because the panel disavowed deciding the\nmerits of Petitioner's Brady claim in the language that\nI quoted you to, and discussed the question only in\ndictum, Petitioner's counsel have concluded that it\nwould not be permissible to state that issue as a\ndistinct question presented.\"\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Our -- our cases\nclearly hold that when you have alternate holdings,\nneither one is dicta.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Sir, the -- but it was\ndisavowing it, I think, as an alternate holding. The\ncourt of appeals opinion is not clear. It disclaims the\npower even to decide the Brady claim.\nAnd if I can just finish the footnote, it\nreally is only two sentences long: \"This Court could,\nof course, reach the issue either by directing the\nparties to brief it or by recognizing that it is fairly\nencompassed within the question as described in the\npetition.\"\nThen the brief in opposition to cert is only\nabout the merits of the claim, and our reply brief on\ncert, if you go to page 4 of the cert reply brief, then\nclearly identifies this question for the Court again.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's fair\nfor the Respondents to say, look, there's no reason to\ntake this procedural -- complicated procedural issue,\nbecause we win on the merits. And the court, as their\nview articulates, the court decided that question.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, I agree it was\nperfectly fair for them. But the question that I'm\ntrying to address, and I apologize if I've misunderstood\nthe question, is did we sufficiently identify for you\nall in the question that we presented the Court what the\nissues were, and so that you were agreeing to decide the\nprocedural question, the merits question, and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How -- how long has this\ncase been going on? When -- when was -- when was the\ncrime?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: In 1980, August of 1980.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The crime was committed in\n1980, 28 years ago.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And when was the -- when\nwas the conviction and the sentence of death pronounced?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Very soon thereafter, within\na couple of years. This -- let me answer that and make\nsure that I've resolved --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you want to go back\ndown again, for another --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How old is this -- is this\ndefendant?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: He's around 50 years old\nnow.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And when -- when did the\ncourt indicate in -- in Tennessee that you had access to\nthe file?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. In the Woodall case,\n12 years after the crime, Justice Scalia, so all the\nevidence was suppressed.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Oh, I thought that was\n2000 -- when was that?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: In 1992.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: 1992.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: In 1992 he was granted\naccess to the files. He immediately stated, right away\n- it's uncontested -- his Brady claim. And then Justice\nScalia, the case went on --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And the Brady claim has\nbeen pending in the Federal courts but just not decided\nsince about 2001?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, sir. So there's no\nquestion about timeliness. Justice Scalia, your\nfrustration about how long in this case is perfectly\nunderstandable, how long they take. But let me just be\nclear that this --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it was -- it was\ndecided. It was decided -- wasn't it decided the first\ntime around? I mean, the Chief Justice calls your\nattention to page 25a. The reason the court said\nthey're not Brady material -- we said it before, we said\nit the last time the case was before the court.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, I took Justice\nKennedy's question to be that this has been in the case\nall along and hasn't been finally resolved, there isn't\na final judgment. You're quite right that, as the Chief\nJustice pointed out, there is language in the court of\nappeals' very first opinion in the case. There is\nunfortunately only one sentence, but to be fair there is\na sentence in the first opinion saying that it's not --\nthat Brady evidence is not material.\nBut I -- I did want to come back to why this\nhas been in the courts for so long. When he presented\nit immediately, Justice Kennedy, to the State courts,\nthe State told the State courts that it had been\npreviously determined. It -- it no longer defends that.\nIt just wasn't true. And that caused the whole thing to\ngo off the rails, because we have been trying ever since\nthe day that we got access to the materials to get one\nfull adjudication of the claim.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess it's -- my\nquestions and the questions and the points --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- that was raised\nabout the time are related, because one reason these\nthings drag on interminably is that you are -- exactly\nwhy you're raising this issue here, it's a procedural\nnicety or a procedural difficulty that arose some time\nago in the State courts. But since then the Federal\ncourts, both the district court and the court of appeals\nhave addressed it, and -- and that that's a good\njurisprudential approach to say, particularly in a\ncomplicated case like this that is 26 years old, here's\nour answer on this, but so that we don't have to go\nthrough this again, if we're reversed on that, here's\nour -- our alternative holding; and they said right\nafter the sentence I quoted, we said this before, and we\nnow say it again: This is not Brady material.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Right. So, Mr. Chief\nJustice, it seems to me, though you and I might disagree\non what's fairly encompassed, we might have one piece of\ncommon ground, and that is it's time to bring this all\nto a close; that there really isn't a big benefit to\nhaving Cone 4 and 5, and that's actually what we have\nasked the Court to do. Now we are not --\nJUSTICE ALITO: I thought what you asked us\nto do was to reverse on the procedural default issue and\nremand the case.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: We -- we do do that. We\nalso say, however, that if the Court believes that the\nSixth Circuit has reached the merits, then this Court\nshould address what are the undefended -- the -- what\nthe Sixth -- the State does not contest are legal errors\nin its assessment of the merits. The Kyles --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That would -- that\nwould then depend on us agreeing to review a very\nfact-bound, necessarily fact-bound, Brady question when\nthe questions presented focused on a procedural issue.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, first of all, Mr.\nChief Justice, there -- we have two different sets of\nerrors that we think exist with respect to the Brady\nclaim. I'm not avoiding the question of whether it's\nencompassed, and I'll come back to it. But to your\nfirst point, we do identify what we think are clear\nlegal mistakes by the lower courts in -- whether it's a\nholding or dictum, not to get into -- enter into that\ndebate, we explain that the Sixth Circuit avowedly split\nthe evidence into sort of four different silos or\ncategories, and we think inconsistently with Kyles v\nWhitley, and we think the lower courts were wrong not to\nhold an evidentiary hearing.\nNow, those aren't fact-bound points; those\nare questions of law, so we believe that it would be\nperfectly appropriate for this Court to decide the\nprocedural question. The procedural holding of the\nSixth Circuit is not defended here, the idea that\nprevious determination amounts to a procedural default.\nAnd then on the question of the merits, the Court could\ndecide those two limited legal questions and leave it to\nthe lower courts to decide the more fact-bound\nquestions.\nBut we do think that the Court -- it is\nactually quite sensible for this Court to not justify\nthe procedural question, given that it's a very weak --\ncall it holding, call it dictum -- the Sixth Circuit has\nsent strong signals about what it views regarding the\nmerits of the Brady claim.\nJUSTICE ALITO: That seems to me to be\ndirectly contrary to what you say in your brief. The\nlast sentence of your brief: \"This case can accordingly\nbe properly resolved more narrowly by remanding the case\nto the district court for consideration of the merits of\nthe Brady claim in the first instance.\"\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, sir, that -- that is\nsomething that the Court can do. We explained in the\npreceding pages what would happen in the district court,\nand that is we think that there needs to be an\nevidentiary hearing and that the -- the Court should\npoint out the Kyles error. But in all events, that\nwould still be a sufficient ground for reversal. But I\nthink we could all agree --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Can I ask you a question\nabout -- on the procedural default issue?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Could you -- could you put\nyourself in the position of the Tennessee Court of\nCriminal Appeals? In light of the briefing that they\nreceived, if you had been on that court, would you have\nunderstood that Petitioner was asserting that he had a\nvalid reason for not raising the Brady claim earlier,\nbecause he had not -- at the time when he could have, at\nthe time of the prior proceedings, he had not had access\nto the State records? Would you have understood that\nfrom the briefing that they got?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I would have, although I\nwould have -- I understand your concern about whether it\nwas fully elaborated and sufficiently so. This of\ncourse was not the procedural default theory that has\nbeen argued in this case before now.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Was that mentioned in -- in\neither the principal brief or the -- or the reply brief,\nthe reason why it wasn't raised earlier?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Insofar as the defendant,\nMr. Cone, told the court of appeals as to paragraph 35\nand 41, the court of appeals should look at the\naffidavit. It did not say what the contents of the\naffidavit was as to the Brady claim.\nNow, I will point you to one particular\npoint, Justice Alito, on the question of whether we\nfairly preserved this in the State Court of Criminal\nAppeals -- I guess two points that hopefully will give\nyou some comfort there.\nThe first is that in the entire long course\nof this litigation, the State has never before made this\nargument; and the second is in the Tennessee Supreme\nCourt -- the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals decides\nthe case. We take the Brady claim up to the Tennessee\nSupreme Court. And even there the State doesn't say\nthat it was insufficiently preserved. They file a\nresponse to our application and they address it as to\nits substance.\nThey never made this argument even in the\nState courts. So I think it -- it could have been\nbetter briefed. The reason -- by the way, let me just\nexplain to you why --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How many claims were -- was\nthis a case where there, what, 81 separate claim counts?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: The -- it -- I don't think\nthere were --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, I can understand\ngiving a lick and a promise to -- to each one if you\ncome up with 81.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: 52.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: 52. Close enough. I'll\nsay the same for 52.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: The -- but when we got to my\npoint in the Tennessee Supreme Court, there was much\nless action in the case. The Brady claim was point\nthree, there was a lot less that was presented in the\ncase.\nLook, I don't think -- my point is not to\nsay that the State, you know, inexplicably behaved\nhorribly here. There could have been better briefing on\nboth sides of this thing. What I'm saying here, though,\nis that the Petitioner right away presented what is a\nvery serious Brady claim to the State courts. He didn't\nabandon it; he fully presented it; and what he wants is\none shot.\nThere is a footnote in the district court's\nopinion. There are two, three sentences in the second\nopinion and one sentence in the first opinion of the\nSixth Circuit. But nobody has sat down and done this\nand disposed of the merits of this claim as anything\nother than a -- an aside, and it is a very serious\nclaim.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If it is --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you tell me what --\ncan you tell me what is this -- let's suppose that --\nthat you have -- had an initial Brady claim that there\nwas one part of the file that you were entitled to see\nthat said that there is some evidence that he's a drug\naddict -- user. And you take that Brady claim up.\nLater you find out -- you have access to a\nnew file and you find cumulative information plus the\ninformation that he was dazed or something, which may\nnot be very -- what's our test to determine whether the\nBrady claim has been exhausted?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Uh --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Or have we talked about\nthat?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, this is, I think,\nsimilar to the Bell v. Kelly question, the case that the\nCourt did on when you present a Brady claim and the\nState courts evaluate the merits of that Brady claim,\nand then you find out other material later, and the\nquestion becomes, how much deference you owe to the\nState courts the first go-around.\nThis is a very different case. The -- all\nof this evidence in the file appeared at one time.\nThere weren't -- it wasn't split, and the only time a\nBrady claim was disposed of was at the time this Brady\nclaim was disposed of. After the Woodall files that you\nmentioned became available to the Petitioner, right then\nand there, he added -- there was paragraph 35 and\nparagraph 41 of his post-conviction application that\nwere added within a couple months of each other. The\nState court right away, at the urging of the State,\nsaid, oh, that's been previously determined, and I won't\nconsider the merits.\nSo this is not a case in which the State\ncourt has assessed a Brady claim and said we don't think\nthere's any Brady issue here.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But your proposal would\nbe that they would never do it because you want to send\nit back to the Federal district court, and it's -- and\nif the State was laboring under misapprehension, it\nthought that, because he brought up the issue twice, he\nhad somehow been defaulted, everyone can agree that that\ndidn't make sense.\nBut now you're proposing that the State\ncourt will not be the one to look at these materials;\ninstead it will be the Federal court. I think there was\nsomething that Judge Merritt said in his dissent that\nindicated he thought that the State court ought to be\nthe one to do this close examination. Didn't -- didn't\nhe propose a stay of the Brady claim in the Federal\ncourt pending exhaustion of that claim in the State\ncourt?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I don't know that he made a\nconcrete proposal. I think he would prefer -- I think\nthe court system would prefer it, and I think everyone\nwould prefer it. The dilemma is that it can't happen.\nAs we explain in footnote 3 at page 26 of our reply\nbrief, there is no window of opportunity to send the\nState -- the case back to the State. It's been\ndismissed there. The statute of limitations has run.\nAnd in a case called Harris v. State, the Tennessee\nSupreme Court said that you couldn't reopen it.\nAnd so we -- we're not saying we want a\nFederal judge rather than a State judge. We're just\nsaying we want a judge, and our problem is that,\nunderstanding that there has been some discussion of the\nmerits, it has been very thin --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I didn't look,\ncounsel, at your -- I don't know if it's yours or your\npredecessor counsel's brief in the -- appealing from the\ndistrict court here to the court of appeals. Did that\nraise a discussion of the Brady claim on the merits,\nsaying that the district court was wrong?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, it did. And so we have\n-- we did try to present it to the Sixth Circuit. The\nSixth Circuit accepted a finding of procedural default\nthat is undefended in this court, and I did want to -- I\nhad just started to get to this --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That was -- that was\nnot a friendly question. My point is that you argued\nthe merits of the Brady claim not only in the district\ncourt but specifically on appeal as well.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: It wasn't a friendly\nquestion --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So this wasn't sort\nof sua sponte addressing --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- the Brady claim\nas kind of a safety net on the procedural --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: It wasn't a friendly\nquestion, but it was an honest answer.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: And we did present the\nquestion to the court of appeals. We think when it said\nwe don't have the power, it was disavowing it. But even\n-- Mr. Chief Justice, even assuming that the court of\nappeals had a whole section in its opinion saying, we're\ndeciding the merits of the Brady claim, my constraint\nwas, in framing the question presented, as I explained\nin that footnote in the cert petition -- and I would\nalso encourage you to read, I didn't get to the language\nin it, in our reply brief. We have a whole paragraph\nthat explains -- this is at page 4 -- \"First, even if\nthis Court were to conclude that the court of appeals\nhad reached the merits of Petitioner's Brady claim,\nnotwithstanding the Sixth Circuit's own repeated\ndisavowals of doing so, then the merits of that Brady\nclaim ruling would be properly before this Court, not\nimmunized from review. Indeed, the Brady issue, as\nencompassed within the questions presented, would be\nproperly briefed by the parties if certiorari were\ngranted.\"\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. No, my -- my\nconcern is not that you didn't brief the Brady claim; it\nis that -- whatever the non-pejorative synonym for\n\"smuggled\" it in -- is you smuggled it in on a case that\npurportedly presented a procedural objection and a\nconflict on a procedural issue.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: It's -- I don't think,\npejorative or not, that it's fair to accuse us of\nsmuggling it. There's a big section in the cert\npetition about it. It's not -- it was not hidden from\n-- I don't -- I don't purport to tell the Court what it\nwas thinking when it granted cert in this case, but I\ntried to be as clear as absolutely possible.\nI was turning to the question of whether we\nhave a serious Brady claim and so the Court should have\nsome concerns here, and I really do think that we do and\nthat the passing observations about the lower courts\ndon't fulfill the duty to assess the merits of the Brady\nclaim fairly. There was one -- the action in this case,\nthe whole reason that there was effectively a trial, was\nthe question of whether the defendant committed these\nacts in an amphetamine psychosis. He had two experts\nthat explained, because of his post-traumatic stress\ndisorder and his very heavy drug issue, that he did not\nunderstand the consequences of his action. He was\ncompletely paranoid.\nAnd the State went after those experts by\nsaying he is not a drug user at all; he's a drug dealer;\nwhen all the while in their files, there were -- Justice\nKennedy, to distinguish the hypothetical you gave -- FBI\nteletypes, police reports, witness statements from\nbefore the day of the robbery, soon thereafter in\nFlorida, explaining that he was not just a heavy drug\nuser, but was acting -- the witness was asked, Did he\nact like he was on drugs? And the witness said, yes, he\ndid. That that really would have made a difference in\nat the very least the sentencing phase in this case to\nat least --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Where is that colloquy?\nI remember witnesses saying he looked weird, he looked\nwild-eyed. Where was the answer that he looked --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Ginsburg, this is in\nthe yellow brief, our merits reply brief. It starts at\nthe very bottom of 21, but you can just start at the top\nof 22.\nAnd as to this question -- so we're talking\nhere about the evidence, not just that he was a drug\nuser, which, I think, would have been relevant to the\njury, but that he actually was on drugs in August of\n1980 at the time all this was happening. There's a\nrobbery -- there are two robberies here that precede\nthese killings, and there's a -- the first one, there's\na statement about the robbery right before the murders\nconfirming that the Petitioner -- he was asked, Did he\nappear to be drunk or high? And the witness said, yes,\nhe did because \"he acted real weird.\"\nThe next one is that the day of the -- at\nthe jewelry store robbery that immediately preceded the\nkillings, that the Petitioner looked wild-eyed, and then\nsoon thereafter a police officer reports in Florida that\nhe looks \"agitated\" and \"looking about in a frenzied\nmanner.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you know, I'll give\nyou the first, that he appeared drunk or high. That's\npretty clear, but I think you tend to look wild-eyed\nafter you're running out after a jewelry store robbery,\nand I think you're -- you're certainly inclined to look\n\"agitated\" and \"looking about in a frenzied manner\" when\nyou've just committed two brutal murders. I don't think\nthat's evidence of drug addiction at all, of being under\nthe influence of drugs.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, I don't doubt for a\nsecond that that's exactly the argument that the\nprosecution would have made. The question is whether a\njuror, in the context of the expert testimony and the\nevidence about drug addiction, could have also found\nthat it was consistent with the idea that he was high on\ndrugs, whether you can have confidence in saying now --\nparticularly if you'll give me the first statement. And\nall the FBI teletypes and the police reports that said\n-- remember this is not just a case about suppression of\nevidence. This is a case where the prosecution, with\nall this stuff in its files, goes after the experts and\nargues to the jury that he's a drug dealer, not a drug\nuser.\nJUSTICE ALITO: This is a very complicated\nfactual question, isn't it? We're dealing with numerous\ndocuments, isn't that right, that you claim are --\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: There are key witness\nstatements, and there are a series of police reports and\nFBI --\nJUSTICE ALITO: And so you would have to\nevaluate all of those and evaluate the prejudice against\nwhat was in the record, and you're suggesting now that\nthis is something we should decide?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Two points, Justice Alito.\nThe first is that we say at the very least the Court\nshould make the Kyles point and the evidentiary hearing\npoint. And the second is, I think to be fair to us,\ngiven your point about this is so complicated, there is\na lot of evidence here, one ought to compare that in\nfairness to what the Sixth Circuit did, and the one\nfootnote that the Chief Justice has talked about with\nthe district court and whether they really did take a\nhard look at the claim. I think it would be fair to us\nto say, look, there are some legal errors here that this\nCourt can correct, and then the district court would be\nthe proper place, if it decides to have an evidentiary\nhearing, to resolve the remainder of the claim.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask just one quick\nquestion: Is it your view that the evidence was\ndeliberately suppressed or negligently suppressed?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Deliberately suppressed,\nalthough it doesn't matter under Brady. There was --\nthey turned over almost nothing, and this was the heart\nof our case. They knew that we were conceding that the\nacts had been committed, and our defense was one of\ninsanity, and it was our only argument in mitigation of\nthe death penalty.\nIf I could --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You recognize that a -- a\ndefense like this, that the defendant was high on drugs,\nthat isn't ambivalent? I mean, a jury, just like it\nmight react adversely to the defendant if he says I was\ndrunk on alcohol, that they might say this is a person\nwho put himself in this condition where his will could\nbe overpowered, this is a voluntary act, why should we\nconsider it, why should we consider it mitigating, we --\nwe could just as well consider it aggravating?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: It -- it could, and that's\nwhy I think it's very important that our defense was\namphetamine psychosis brought on by post traumatic\nstress disorder from honorable service in Vietnam, not\njust that he was a target.\nIf I could reserve the remainder of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMs. Smith.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JENNIFER L. SMITH\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. SMITH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nAs the Court has alluded in a number of\nquestions, both the district court and the Sixth Circuit\nnow twice have resolved -- have rejected Cone's Brady\nclaim on the merits, and we believe correctly so in\nlight of Cone's actions in the day surrounding the\nmurder, his statements about what he did and why he did\nit, and more importantly the lower court's recognition\nthat additional evidence --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask -- let me get\nsomething on the table. Do you agree that the evidence\nshows that this evidence was deliberately suppressed?\nMS. SMITH: Your Honor, I don't think\nthere's been any -- any finding about the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But is there any\nexplanation for -- was there any explanation for it\nother than the tactical explanation?\nMS. SMITH: There's no explanation in the\nrecord, there has been no finding about whether the\nevidence has been suppressed at all in this case because\nboth the district court and the Sixth Circuit decided as\na matter of law that the materials --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to be relevant\nbecause if it was suppressed for tactical reasons, it\nseems to me hard to say that the prosecution thought it\ndidn't make any difference.\nMS. SMITH: Well, again, there has --\nthere's been no finding on that, because each court, and\nI think more than just in a passing statement, each\ncourt that looked at it, both the district court and the\nSixth Circuit, have looked point by point, especially in\nthe district court --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What they -- one of the\nfirst questions always troubles me in a Brady case is\nthe conduct of the prosecutor and the ethics of the\nprofession, the whole -- whole importance of the rule is\nto be sure prosecutors perform their public function.\nAnd I'm just wondering if there is any -- if this was a\ncase of just an honest mistake, it would be one thing,\nbut if it appears to have been a tactical decision and a\ntactical program, it seems to me very difficult to\nassume that the prosecutor thought it was really not\nimportant evidence.\nMS. SMITH: Your Honor, I certainly\nunderstand the Court's concern, and I'll just -- and\nagain reiterate, there has not been any finding on that,\nbut there is at least a suggestion in the record that\nsome of the evidence on which the Petitioner is relying\nat this point actually wasn't suppressed. And we noted\nthis in our brief, specifically as to the witness Ilene\nBlankman.\nAll of the individual items on which the\nPetitioner is traveling now were the subject of\ncross-examination, so that at least raises the question\nabout whether --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Blankman, that isn't the\nconcern. The concern is simply this: If they're\ncorrect, that this whole trial revolves around whether\nthis individual is suffering post traumatic stress\ndisorder with these amphetamines.\nThey have two expert witnesses who say that\nhe's in very bad shape, everything the defense wanted\nthem to say; that's it. That's their evidence.\nOn cross, the prosecutor gets both of them\nto admit that they're basing their testimony on what the\ndefendant told them about his drug use. At which point\nthe prosecutor says, let's talk to Mr. Roby, who is the\narresting officer, did you see he was on -- when you\narrested him, was he on -- did he look like he was on\ndrugs? No.\nLet's talk to Mr. Flynn. When you processed\nhim, did he look like he was on drugs? No. And then\nlet's talk to Ms. Blankman, okay?\nSo, now the case is submitted, and at that\npoint the prosecutor says, there is no evidence that he\nwas on drugs. He said that. Two, those two expert\nwitnesses, and it's baloney. There's your case.\nNow, in fact in the files is evidence that\nMr. Roby, that very day of the crime and the next day,\nsent out all-points bulletins saying he was a dangerous\ndrug user. There is evidence in the files that Mr. --\nthat the FBI man sent out similar all-point bulletins.\nThere are three witnesses who have described the\nbehavior of the day as frenzied, and we have heard the\ndescriptions.\nAnd you're saying that the lawyer, the\ntrained lawyer for the government, who knew this\ninformation and knew the defense just what? Just\noverlooked it by accident? Just what?\nMS. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, I can't speak\nfor the prosecutor's state of mind at the time, but I\nwill -- will state that the central question in the case\nwas not whether the Petitioner used drugs. There was\nevidence in the record from his mother, there was\nevidence in the record from his own mouth --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He was conceded that he was\na drug user.\nMS. SMITH: That's exactly right. It came\nthrough the State's own --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that he was dangerous\nbecause he admitted the murders.\nMS. SMITH: It came -- some of that came\nthrough the State's own witnesses. And -- and the\nargument the State made about him being a drug user\nversus a drug seller was not the only argument the State\nmade. The State specifically said look at -- to the\njury, look at what he did on the day of the murders,\nlook at what he did on Saturday and Sunday to go to his\nstate of mind. And the State focused on the -- the goal\noriented, the purposeful behavior and the very direct\nbehavior --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you think that the\nmaterial described by Justice Breyer would have been\nexcluded by the trial court as irrelevant if it had been\nintroduced, or cumulative as --\nMS. SMITH: I don't think it would have been\nexcluded. I think it could have been used to attempt to\ncross-examine certainly Agent Roby. But Agent Roby's\ntestimony didn't -- didn't state that Mr. Cone was not a\ndrug user. Mr. Roby -- Agent Roby's testimony was that\nat the time that he observed him, four days after the\nmurders, he didn't appear to be on -- under the\ninfluence of drugs, and when he saw him eight days after\nthe murder, he examined his body and there were no\nneedle marks.\nThe testimony was very specific as to his\nobservations on the four-day point and the eight-day\npoint as to the murders.\nSame with Agent Flynn --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you think the\nprosecutor had an ethical duty to turn over this\nmaterial?\nMS. SMITH: I think that the material -- if\nthe material -- if the subject was immaterial --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It's a simple question,\nyes or no?\nMS. SMITH: I think that as a legal matter\nthere was no -- no need to turn it over because it was\nimmaterial.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That's not my question.\nCan you answer my question? Did he have an ethical duty\nto turn this material over?\nMS. SMITH: I'm unaware of any ethical\nrequirement that he turn it over, and I don't think\nthat -- and certainly under Brady if it's not material,\nwe don't think it was material, then it's certainly not\nrequired as a constitutional matter. And the reason is\nnot --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You believe that the\nmateriality judgment is yours to make, the State's to\nmake as sort of a gate keeping measure? Isn't the\nmateriality an issue for the fact finder?\nMS. SMITH: Well, I think it's -- it's --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You exclude -- do you\nbelieve that you can, in effect, suppress any piece of\nevidence on -- on -- on the State's judgment that it\nwill not prove to be material in the context of the\nwhole case?\nMS. SMITH: I think prosecutors make those\nkind of judgment calls all the time.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Do you think that's a\nproper judgment for the prosecution to make?\nMS. SMITH: Well, I think that probably a\nprudent prosecutor would err on the side of turning over\nmatters that --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Right. And --\nMS. SMITH: -- have some relevance.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Wouldn't -- wouldn't he err\non the side of turning over the matters because Brady\nleaves the materiality judgment, like all materiality\njudgments, ultimately, to the fact finder?\nMS. SMITH: Certainly ultimately it's left\nto the fact finder, but the prosecutor is --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, initially Brady\nleaves the judgment for, furthering Justice Souter's\npoint, to the attorney for the defense. You're saying\nthat the prosecutor can preempt the role of the attorney\nfor the defense in deciding what to offer to the court\nas material? And if -- and if -- and if -- even if the\nevidence is in a gray area, that's for the defense\nattorney to decide under -- under our Brady\njurisprudence, as I understand it. Correct me if that's\nwrong.\nMS. SMITH: Well, I think -- yes, I think\nthe defense ultimately would make the decision how to\nuse the evidence that comes into his possession. But\nobviously, the prosecutor has to make an initial\njudgment call about whether or not the evidence is going\nto be material, given what he knows about -- about the\ndefense.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't the prosecutor's\nobligation to make an initial assessment as to whether\nthe evidence tends to be mitigating evidence or\nfavorable to the defendant? Isn't that the prosecutor's\njudgment?\nMS. SMITH: I think that -- that falls\nwithin that -- the prosecutor's judgment. But I think\nif we look -- look at the evidence in --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't this evidence clearly\nof a mitigating character?\nMS. SMITH: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You don't think -- you\ndon't think it would be favorable to the defendant\ngetting the evidence that Justice Breyer summarized a\nmoment ago?\nMS. SMITH: No, sir, I do not. There was\nalready evidence before the jury that the defendant was\na drug addict, that he was a drug user, that he was\nchanged after Vietnam. This Court's own opinion in 2002\nnoted that he was a drug addict.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Maybe I'm being -- but\nJustice Breyer made the point, and made it, I think very\nclearly, that although that evidence was in, the\nargument here -- the argument that was made before the\njury in this case is that the witnesses upon whom the\ndefense was specifically relying, were witnesses whose\naccount of the defendant's drug use came solely from the\ndefendant himself.\nGiven that fact, wouldn't it have been\nmitigating evidence to learn that other people, at times\nrelatively close to the events in question, without\nbeing coached by the defendant, had concluded that he\nwas a drug user? Wouldn't that have been mitigating\nevidence?\nMS. SMITH: I don't think that it would have\nbeen material to --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: We are not asking about\nmateriality at this point. We are asking about the\nmitigating character of the evidence. Would it have\nbeen favorable to the defendant? Would that have been\nits tendency?\nMS. SMITH: I think it added no more than --\nthan what was already before the jury.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That was not my question.\nWas it favorable evidence? Did it have a tendency to\nfavor the defendant?\nMS. SMITH: No, not under his theory, and\nthe reason is --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then I will be candid with\nyou that I simply cannot follow your argument because I\nbelieve you have just made a statement to me that is\nutterly irrational.\nMS. SMITH: Well, let me explain if I -- if\nI may, and the reason I say that it is not mitigating is\nbecause the -- the entire question in the defense and\nfor mitigation purposes is the defendant's state of mind\nat the time of the murder.\nThere was already evidence that there was --\nthat he was a drug user. The fact that he was a drug\nuser doesn't say anything more -- or additional evidence\nof drug use says nothing more about his state of mind at\nthe time of the crime than what was already presented.\nThe question is not whether he was a drug user. The\nrecord showed it. It came out of the mouths of the\nState's own witness.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But what about the\nprosecutor who said \"baloney.\" He said the prosecutor\n-- the prosecutor says: The defendant tells you he was\na drug user. Baloney, he was a drug dealer.\nThe prosecutor deliberately tried to paint\nthis man as somebody who had a huge quantity of drugs,\nwhich he did, and he was dealing in them. I mean the --\nthe prosecutor tried to portray a man who was a cold-\nblooded killer, who didn't have any blurred vision.\nAnd that line to the jury, \"baloney\" -- he\nsays he was a drug user -- that, it seems to me, is\nexactly what the prosecutor wanted to do, which is to\ntell this jury this guy's a dealer; he's not a drug\nabuser.\nMS. SMITH: I think that the prosecutor\noverstated in that portion of his argument, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You also had cross-examined\nthe two expert witnesses in order to show that they\ndidn't really know that this man was a drug user,\nbecause their only basis for that was he told them. So\nas I've read these briefs, I've come away concluding\nyours with a strong impression that this was a relevant\nissue. That the prosecution did not concede that he was\non drugs at the time of the murder. Indeed, that that\nwas all that was at issue.\nAnd so I just don't see, like Justice\nSouter, how you can say that this wouldn't at least be\nuseful information if -- even for cross-examination, and\nI think more than that since you have three direct\nwitnesses.\nBut leaving that aside, there's another part\nof this case that equally bothers me. It seems to me\nthere was a lawyer for the State here that twice told\nthe courts that this matter had never been raised. Is\nthat so? Or maybe he said that the courts had decided\nit because the State has taken absolutely inconsistent\npositions, first saying that the trial courts decided\nit, and they did decide it, but by accident. They\nthought that paragraph 41 referred to this claim when it\nreferred to an earlier claim.\nSo first they tell the courts -- and you\nwouldn't know that unless you are pretty familiar\nbecause there were a lot of words written. They tell\nthe courts: It's been decided, judge. Don't worry.\nThey decided it: Adequate State ground. And next they\nwake up to the fact that it wasn't decided, and then\nthey announce: Oh, he waived it, despite the fact that\nthere's a case called Swanson in Tennessee that says\nthat you can raise a later claim if you have grounds for\nnot knowing of it in the first place. And he didn't\nknow of it until 1993.\nSo I see the State taking opposite\npositions, and -- and what seems from the briefs\ninconsistent with the State law, and I'm confused. What\nis it that happened in this case?\nMS. SMITH: Well, I -- I want to answer your\nquestion, and I will answer your question, Your Honor,\nif I could just say one thing about the Brady. We don't\ndispute that the material in question is relevant to the\ndefense and is relevant to the sentence.\nWe dispute that it's material. We don't\nthink it's material in every court where the district\ncourt and the sixth circuit have found it immaterial.\nBut on the -- on the -- the -- what has happened in\nterms of the procedural defense, we have confessed that\nthere was an error by the State in the -- in the post-\nconviction court.\nWe agree that Tennessee law does allow -- it\ncertainly at -- at this time did allow a petitioner to\nraise -- to -- to file successive petitions if that\npetitioner could establish cause. Now, the prosecutor\nin the course of responding to some 80 claims, both\nparts and subparts, made a mistake and read paragraph 35\nas being similar to -- to a claim that had been raised\non direct appeal and argued that it appeared to be the\nsame. That was an error.\nLikewise, the trial court erroneously ruled\nthat both paragraph 35 and paragraph 41, both Brady\nclaims, had been previously determined on direct appeal\nor post-conviction. That was an error. We have\nconfessed that in our brief and -- and do at this point.\nNow, in the appeal the petitioner doesn't\nagain raise the Brady claim. In his principal brief he\nnever mentions the Brady claim. He never even reaches\n--\nJUSTICE ALITO: If we read the -- can I ask\nyou this: If we read the decision of the Court of\nCriminal Appeals as having ratified the -- the district\ncourt's -- the -- the lower court's treatment of the\nprocedural default issues, having rejected it on the\nground that it was previously decided, that would be an\ninstance in which a State court applied a procedural\ndefault rule based on an undisputed error of fact.\nIn that situation, would it not -- wouldn't\nit be clear that there was not an adequate, independent\nState ground for the decision; and, therefore, no\nprocedural default? And if we were to find that,\nwouldn't the appropriate step be on this very factual\nBrady issue to send it back to the lower federal courts?\nMS. SMITH: In answer to your first\nquestion, yes, we don't disagree with the proposition\nthat if a trial -- that if a State court refuses to\nconsider a claim on the basis that that claim has been\ndetermined previously, that that would not be an\nadequate basis for a procedural default in Federal\nCourt.\nBut we don't -- I don't think that this case\npresents that scenario, and every court that has looked\nat the Court of Criminal Appeals's decision has read\nthat decision as applying a waiver. The District Court\nread that decision as applying a waiver. If you look at\n-- at page 112-A of the petition appendix, not only does\nthe District Court read it as a waiver, but the\nPetitioner read it as a applying a waiver. Because as\nyou note in that first sentence, as to the Brady claim\nto the district court, Cone also attempts to argue that\nthose claims were improperly held waived by the court.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, \"waiver,\" my\ngoodness. First, I don't think it's impossible to say\n\"waiver\" since he wrote the words in paragraph 41 that\nmake absolutely clear that they aren't waiving it. He\nis raising it.\nThen, aside from that, the paragraph of the\ndistrict -- of the court of appeals's opinion says they\nwere already decided or waived. So it's ambiguous, at\nbest, for you.\nSo let's go back and see what the State\ndistrict court held, and I think that the State district\ncourt held that it had been decided, not that it had\nbeen waived. Am I right?\nMS. SMITH: The trial court --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMS. SMITH: -- held that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So there the cases\nin this Court would say if a State appeals court writes\na matter -- something -- a sentence that is ambiguous so\nyou don't know whether it was decided: For example,\nthey mean it was waived or mean that it was decided,\nthen the next best thing to do, which makes sense, is\nlook to the lower court to see what they actually did.\nSo we follow that rule, and we get to\nexactly what justice Alito said: That what they did was\nthey were holding that this has already been decided.\nMS. SMITH: I think that rule holds if the\npetitioner has made the argument to the appellate court.\nHere the Petitioner didn't make the argument to the\nappellate court.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Don't you think at this\npoint the Petitioner is saying in -- in his briefs:\nI've been getting the runaround. First, they tell me\nit's one thing; then they tell me another. All I can\ntell you is this: No one has ever passed on the merits\nof this Brady claim, which is a substantial claim.\nMS. SMITH: Well, I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So you choose the\nprocedures, but be sure that that's the outcome.\nMS. SMITH: Well, first of all, Your Honor,\nI don't think the Petitioner has been getting the\nrunaround. The Petitioner has always throughout this\nlitigation proceeded on the premise that the CCA -- the\nCourt of Criminal Appeals's decision in Tennessee was\nbased on a waiver. All of his briefs in the lower court\nand in the -- the sixth circuit reflect that.\nThe District Court proceeded as if that\nruling was a waiver. The sixth circuit in its 2001\ndecision, if you look at page 62-A and 62 -- 63-A at the\nbottom, the -- the sixth circuit specifically said the\nTennessee waiver rule is plainly applicable to the Brady\nclaim. And the Tennessee courts explicitly relied on\nthe waiver rule.\nIt wasn't until the 2007 opinion that the --\nthe sixth circuit even discussed this notion of previous\ndetermination, and only then in response to what I think\nwas a red herring injected by the dissenting opinion\nthat somehow the -- the Court of Criminal Appeals's\ndecision stood for something different than what the\nparties and the courts had been reading it all along.\nThe Court of Criminal Appeals --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Could the explanation of\nthis language in the opinion be due to the fact that the\nState first argued that it had already been decided;\nthen in later courts the State changed its theory and\nannounced that it had been waived?\nMS. SMITH: The State --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Isn't that why they're\nwriting about waiver?\nMS. SMITH: No, Your Honor. The State has\nconsistently maintained throughout the habeas that the\n-- that the Brady claim was either defaulted or waived.\nIn the answer to the petition, the State presented the\nvery argument that they're presenting today, that the\nCourt of Criminal Appeals relied on a waiver. In the --\nin the brief to the Sixth Circuit --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Spell out the waiver in\nlight of what he said. The first time he learns that\nthese -- cases, other cases cited and he has access to\nthe district attorney's file, he then files a habeas,\nState habeas petition in which he said that the facts on\nwhich his Brady claim rests have been revealed through\ndisclosure of the State's files which occurred after the\nfirst conviction proceeding. Those words are in the\naffidavit -- right -- that came with the second\npetition. So how could he possibly have waived this\nwhen he has explained it wasn't available to him?\nMS. SMITH: Well, I think to understand how\nthis -- how this could happen, the bottom line is that\nhe failed to demonstrate to the State courts why he\nshould -- he was properly before the court to begin\nwith; and when you -- when you raise a claim -- he\nburied his claim among a hundred other parts and\nsubparts. If --if he had a legitimate claim, he\ncertainly didn't highlight it as such, and then he -- he\nburied even further his explanation for a waiver in a\n41-page affidavit filed six days before the State\ncourt's ruling in this case.\nIt was the first time in the entire case\nthat he mentioned anything at all about access to the\nprosecutor's files. Then when he got an adverse\njudgment in the trial court he never even made the\nargument in the Court of Criminal Appeals. He took a\ncompletely different theory about waiver, said that\nwaiver was personal, and should be -- should be judged\non a subjective standard rather than objective -- never\nmentioned to the Court of Criminal Appeals any argument\nwhatsoever about access to the prosecutor's files.\nIt was on the basis of that argument that\nthe Court of Criminal Appeals held that the Petitioner\nhad failed to rebut the presumption of waiver as a\nmatter of law as to all claims that had not been\npreviously determined.\nSo that holding is an overarching holding,\nit applies to every claim that was raised in the first\nterm and in the successive habeas position, and we think\njustified the district -- it certainly was the basis of\nthe district court's default and as well, in 2001 was\nthe basis of the Sixth Circuit's decision.\nNow, regarding the 2007 decision, we concede\nthat that decision could be read as presenting the\nquestion 1, where this Court relies on a finding of\nprevious determination, but we don't think that's what\nthe court did in 2007. In 2007 the court specifically\nruled that it was not revisiting the Brady claim. That\nwas a decision based on law of the case principles, and\nto the extent that it discussed previous determination,\nwe don't think it in any way intended to modify its\nearlier holding.\nIn 2001 the Sixth Circuit clearly relied on\nthe waiver bar, and that's very evident on pages 62 and\n63a in the petition appendix, and that's the basis of\nthe waiver. So we don't even think that the -- that the\nsituation in question 1 is even presented, although\nif -- to answer a question, in response to Justice\nAlito's question, I think it would be -- would be an\nabsurd result that something that has been previously\ndetermined is defaulted, but that's not the situation\nhere. The record shows it's not previously determined.\nThe Petitioner has never argued that it's previously\ndetermined, and no court until this point has ever even\nread the Court of Criminal Appeals decision as making a\nprevious determination finding. Everyone has accepted\nthe fact that that holding was a waiver holding.\nSo on that -- that's the basis of the\ndefault, and the reason that he has defaulted is that he\nfailed to make that argument when he had -- when he the\nopportunity to make it. He could have made it, and he\ndidn't make it. He buried all his good arguments, even\non his waiver argument, he was making inconsistent\narguments. On the one hand, he was saying the claim was\nnovel, the claim that my post-conviction counsel didn't\ndiscuss it with me. On the other hand, he says that I'm\njust now finding out about it. Those are completely\ninconsistent theories, and the theory that he actually\npresented in the Court of Criminal Appeals bears no\nresemblance to the argument that he is making now or\nthat he made in the district court.\nBut all of this aside, it really is -- is\nbeside the point because at the end of the day, the\ndistrict court very clearly addressed -- and\nspecifically, not just in passing, but specifically at\nvarious points in its -- in its opinion, the materiality\nof each and every item of evidence.\nHe went through in detail a discussion of\nthe police teletypes, stating that -- that the jury\nalready was aware that he was a drug user. It really\nwasn't any question whether he was a drug user; the\nevidence clearly showed that he was. The question was\nwhat was his State of mind at the time evidence was what\nwas his state of mind at the time of the murders.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What -- what do you say to\nthe argument on the other side, that these various items\nof -- of Brady material were averted to and were\ndiscussed on a purely isolated basis; they were not\ndiscussed in terms of their cumulative effect, which\nKyles v Whitley says is the standard. What's your\nresponse to that?\nMS. SMITH: Well, I think if you look at the\n-- at the district court's opinion, I could that\nargument could be made based upon the way the district\ncourt treated the items. The district court certainly\ndid look at them in categories and separated them; but I\nthink if you look at the Sixth Circuit's opinion,\ncertainly in 2007 where the court -- the court looked at\nit in more detail, I think that it is clear that the\ncourt cumulated the items and said as a whole that the\nBrady materials don't undermine -- do not undermine\nconfidence in the verdict. So I disagree that -- that\nthe Sixth Circuit treated them incorrectly, and -- and I\nwould note --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do -- do you agree the\nprosecutor was arguing, when he said that he's a drug\ndealer, that he was not a drug user? Was it -- was it\nconceded that he was a drug user? I suspect it was not.\nI said earlier it was, and it seems that it\nwas not, because he introduced one witness to say that\nthere were no -- no needle marks on his body, which\nwould suggest that he's trying to make the point to the\njury that this person doesn't even use drugs.\nMS. SMITH: Your Honor, I -- I think I've\nnoted earlier, I think that the prosecutor overstated\nhis case on that point, no question about it; but I\nthink there was ample evidence in the record indicating\nthat he was a drug user. This Court even noted that,\neven noted there was proof of the fact that he was a\ndrug addict, that he was a drug user, that the evidence\nwas strong that he was -- that he was under the\ninfluence of an amphetamine psychosis. There were two\nexperts that testified to that. On the other hand,\nthere were two experts for the State that said that that\n-- that defense couldn't be supported.\nSo the question of whether he was a drug\nuser or not a drug user was really beside the point. I\nthink the prosecutor eventually got around to that in\nhis argument. When you look at the argument of the\nwhole, the bottom line of the argument was, and we\nquoted it in our brief, \"look at what he did, look at\nhis actions around this murder, and let that go to his\nstate of mind,\" because that was the best evidence. Not\nonly is that -- he said, he specifically said he went\ninto this individual's home with the purpose of getting\nfed, getting cleaned up and getting out of town, and\nwhen the Todds ceased to cooperate with him, he had to\ncontrol them physically. That's code I suppose for\nbeating them to death because that's exactly what he\ndid.\nHe explained what he did and why he did it.\nHis actions are very calculated from -- from beginning\nto end. So whether he used drugs or didn't use drugs,\nthe question is what was going on at the time of this\nmurder, and by his own admission the reason that the\nTodds are -- are not with us today is because they\nceased to cooperate; they became frightened; and he had\nto control them physically. I think that's the best\nevidence of his state of mind at the time. Those are\nwords out of his own mouth, and I think that that\ncertainly supports the finding of both the district\ncourt and the Sixth Circuit on materiality.\nI agree with the Chief Justice's assessment;\nwe do not think that the Brady claim is fairly included\nwithin the question. The merits issue is not a\npredicate to the default question. I certainly\nunderstand Petitioner's dilemma in this case, but I\nthink faced with that dilemma, he should have squarely\npresented that question among the questions presented\nand not dropped it in a footnote in argument 2. We\ndon't think it's fairly presented; but -- but in any\nevent, it certainly justifies affirmance of the judgment\nor at a minimum the dismissal of the appeal.\nAnd for all these reasons, if there are no\nfurther questions, we ask this Court to affirm the\njudgment of the district court -- of the Sixth Circuit.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's outside the record\nand not really relevant to the case. Has he been on\ndeath row since 1984 or so? And if so, is that solitary\nconfinement? Is he not allowed -- if you know?\nMS. SMITH: I don't know. I'm not aware\nthat he's in any sort of heightened level of security.\nI would assume he's just at a standard level. I don't\nknow his security level, but he has been on death row\nfor the entire period, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Goldstein, you have three minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice.\nJustice Kennedy, he has been on death row;\nhe is not in solitary confinement.\nHere's the dilemma I think about how the\nCourt needs to dispose of the case. On the one hand, we\nhave the State, which is unapologetic about having\nsuppressed a whole bunch of evidence and about having\nmisstated the procedural history to the State court and\nthen to the Sixth Circuit. On the other hand, the\nCourt's business is usually not to get into the weeds,\nthings like fact-bound Brady claims, and I think that\nthe Court can accommodate both the concern of the signal\nthat it would send in affirming the judgment in this\ncase and also the -- the bad precedent it might set by\ngetting into the Johnson pitfalls of this witness\nstatement and that witness statement, by resolving the\ncase as follows:\nOn page 22 and 24a of the petition appendix,\nthe court of appeals says the claim was procedurally\ndefaulted because it was previously determined. That's\nwrong. That is the argument that was passed upon by the\ncourt of appeals, and that should be reversed on\nprocedural grounds.\nOn the Brady claim, it seems to me that the\ncourt of appeals, when it did discuss the claim, made a\ncouple of big mistakes the Court could identify and send\nthe case back. The first is, when it talked about the\nmerits, it said we don't think this evidence would have\nmattered because there was a lot of evidence at trial\nthat he was a drug user. But as has been discussed, I\nthink in detail, the court of appeals, because its\nassessment was kind of passing here, misunderstood that\nwhen the experts said that, when the prosecutor turned\naround and completely discredited that. And so I think\nthat colors the Sixth Circuit's assessment incorrectly.\nThe second is the Kyles point, and the third\nis the possibility that we're entitled to an evidentiary\nhearing.\nAnd so I think an opinion of this Court that\nsimply dealt with the undefended procedural default\nruling and then went to the merits and only made those\nthree points and then left it to the lower courts to\nresolve the Brady claim ultimately would balance the\nconcern about the Court's institutional interests in not\nsending a signal of affirming this judgment in light of\nwhat the State has done here and not getting into the\nweeds of the claim.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there anything in\nthe court of appeals' treatment of the Brady claim on\nthe merits that suggests it also treated them separately\nin the different silos, as you put it?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. We\npoint out that the court of appeals twice said, \"We\nconsider the four different categories of Brady evidence\nseparately.\" And then when it did discuss them -- it's\nvery hard to tell, its discussion is so passing here --\nbut it does go through this kind of evidence, say, the\nFBI files or the police teletypes from Agent Roby, and\nit says that wouldn't have been persuasive, and then it\nturns to the witness statements. But I would also say\nthat its overarching point --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where do they say\nthat they're only considering the categories separately?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: On page 57a. \"We take\" --\n\"We will take up each category of documents separately\nand discuss whether they are\" --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's the 2001\nopinion. Do they do that in the 2007 opinion?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: No. The -- in the 2007\nopinion, that discussion happens at 25a, and here is\ntheir explanation. It goes to my first point. And they\ndo sort of then turn around and treat them more\ngenerally. \"It would not have been news to the jurors\nthat Cone was a drug user. They had already heard\nsubstantial direct evidence that he was a drug user,\nincluding the opinion of the two expert witnesses,\nCone's mother, the drugs found in Cone's car, and\nphotographic evidence.\" And that's our point, that that\nwas discredited because it came out of his mouth.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What was the photographic\nevidence?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: There was one photo. It\nactually points in the opposite direction. The State\ncites it in its merit brief. They have a picture of\nCone as not having any needle marks, to your point,\nJustice Scalia, that they tried to prove he wasn't a\ndrug user at all.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Thank you very much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nI'm sorry, Mr. Goldstein, one moment.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Did you raise --\ncite Kyles in your petition for cert?\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: I can tell that you quickly,\nMr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, I see it. Yes.\nPages 30 and 32. Okay.\nMR. GOLDSTEIN: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
