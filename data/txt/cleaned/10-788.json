PINCUS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. PINCUS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThis Court has twice held, in Malley and in\nKalina, that a complaining witness who sets a criminal\nprosecution in motion by submitting a false affidavit is\nentitled to qualified immunity, but not absolute\nimmunity, in an action under section 1983. The Court\nrested that conclusion on its determination that\ncomplaining witnesses were subject to damages liability\nat common law when -- in 1871 when section 1983 was\nenacted.\nThe question in this case is whether the\nrule of Malley and Kalina also applies to a complaining\nwitness who sets a prosecution in motion by testifying\nbefore a grand jury. Again, the common law provides the\nanswer. The law is clear that in 1871 damages liability\ncould be based on false grand jury testimony.\nJUSTICE ALITO: The problem I have with your\nargument is that I don't really know what a complaining\nwitness is in the grand jury context. Let's take the\nFederal grand jury as an example. Do you think there\nare complaining witnesses before Federal grand juries?\nMR. PINCUS: I think there -- there can be.\nIt depends obviously on the -- the circumstances, Your\nHonor, but -- but there certainly can be.\nJUSTICE ALITO: A complaining witness, I\nwould think, is a person who files a complaint, who\ncauses -- so, under the Federal system, it would be\nsomeone who files a complaint and attests to it under\nRule 5. That person is asking that charges be brought.\nThat's what it means to be a complaining witness, filing\na complaint.\nNobody -- no witness before a Federal grand\njury asks that an indictment be returned. They provide\ntestimony, and they may want an indictment to be\nreturned, but it's the prosecutor who asks for the\nindictment to be returned. So, I don't see how there is\na complaining witness in that sense in the traditional\ngrand jury context.\nMR. PINCUS: Well, Your Honor, the common\nlaw confronted precisely the same situation, and after\npublic prosecutors came into being and when grand juries\nwere empaneled by them, the common law has concluded\nthat, both in 1871 and in the present, that there can be\na person who is the motivating force behind the\nprosecution, who --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: A person? What --\nwhat if you have three elements to a crime, and you have\none witness for each one. You see somebody sees the guy\ntrying to get into a car. Well, maybe he left it --\nmaybe he locked his keys in. Another sees the guy\nwalking around with a television. It might be his. A\nthird sees the guy selling the television to somebody\nelse. There's nothing wrong with that. Each one\ntestifies before the grand jury. Who is the complaining\nwitness?\nMR. PINCUS: Well, Your Honor, at common\nlaw, the complaining witness was more than just someone\nwho gave evidence that was necessary for the warrant or\nthe indictment to issue. It was someone who was pushing\nfor the prosecution to be brought. All of these\nproblems, of course, occurred at common law, and they\nalso occur in connection with the circumstances that the\nCourt addressed in Malley and Kalina.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, let me give you\nanother example that I think happens with some\nfrequency. You have a Federal grand jury, and you have\ntestimony by an FBI or a DEA case agent, the person who\nhas been working on the case, and that witness provides\na lot of information supporting the charges that the\nprosecutor wants returned. You also have a cooperating\nwitness, someone who has entered into a plea bargain\nand, in exchange for that, is providing a lot of\nincriminating testimony. Now, is there a complaining\nwitness in that situation?\nMR. PINCUS: Well, again, Your Honor, there\ncan be. It -- it depends --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Which one is it?\nMR. PINCUS: It could be both.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Both?\nMR. PINCUS: It could be one or -- it could\nbe -- it could be one or the other. I think these --\nthese circumstances, again, are not unknown to the\ncommon law in the States. They --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Pincus, you said -- I\nthink you used the words \"the one who motivated the\ncharge\" or something to that effect. And I'm looking at\nthe complaint that was filed in this case, and it\nsays -- and this is on page 28 of the joint appendix.\nIt says Mr. Hodges -- that's the prosecutor -- knew or\nshould have known there was no probable cause. \"He,\"\nMr. Hodges, \"directed Mr. Paulk to appear before the\ngrand jury and attest to the truth of such charges.\"\nSo, if anyone was the instigator, it was the\nprosecutor, not his aide. But the prosecutor gets\nabsolute immunity.\nMR. PINCUS: Well, Your Honor, I -- I don't\nthink we know, because the complaint also alleges that\nMr. Paulk knew that his testimony was false and -- and\nmade it -- and gave his testimony anyway. And\ncertainly, his --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But if he did it -- if he\ndid at the prosecutor's bidding, then he is not the\nprime mover.\nMR. PINCUS: Well, the -- the complaint also\nalleges that they were conspiring together to bring this\ncomplaint. And so, again, I think the facts will be\ndeveloped. But the -- the first indictment in fact\nlisted Mr. Paulk as the complainant. So, in many\nsituations, the concerns that Justice Alito was pointing\nto won't be present because there will be a clear\ncomplainant, as there was in this case.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But do you --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose an important\nwitness is reluctant to testify but is issued a subpoena\nby the United States attorney to appear before the grand\njury, and then with reluctance he comes forward but,\nunder oath, provides all of the key testimony necessary\nto indict? Is he a complaining witness?\nMR. PINCUS: I think some lower courts have\nsaid no, Your Honor. Some lower courts have said all\nthat --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what's the test\nwe're supposed to use to decide?\nMR. PINCUS: Well, the -- the test that this\nCourt has set forth is whether the complaining witness\nis someone who sets the prosecution in motion. That's\n-- that's the phrase that this Court has used, and\nthat's a phrase that's -- that is reflected in the\ncommon law, based on the common law. And the lower\ncourts have not had a problem applying that case. There\nare seven circuits that now have adopted the rule\nthat --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In the hypothetical I\ngave, what's the answer?\nMR. PINCUS: I would say in the hypothetical\nyou gave, Your Honor, that that person is not a\ncomplaining witness, because he did nothing other than\ncome forward when he was subpoenaed. If someone comes\nforward to the prosecutor, urges an indictment, urges a\nprosecution, and then subsequently is subpoenaed, that\nmight be a different case because you have --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Urges -- urges a\nprosecution. One area that causes me concern here are\nthe domestic violence cases, where someone may well\nreport an episode but, by the time it gets to whatever\nthe indictment procedure is, a grand jury or otherwise,\nis unwilling to -- to testify and pursue it. And yet,\nthat person may be the one who started the prosecution\nin motion. Is that individual a complaining witness?\nMR. PINCUS: That -- that person may be a\ncomplaining witness. You know, at common law, the\ncomplaining witness also has to be --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, he says -- he or\nshe says at the time, I -- I don't want prosecution to\ngo forward. I -- you know, I would prefer that it not\ngo forward.\nMR. PINCUS: Then that fact would obviously\nmitigate against her being a complaining witness. But\n-- but these --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mitigating? Come on.\nMR. PINCUS: Yes. She would not be --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Does it make her not a\ncomplaining witness?\nMR. PINCUS: Yes, she would not be a\ncomplaining witness, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nMR. PINCUS: But I -- just to step back --\nJUSTICE ALITO: The holding that you're\nasking for isn't going to do very much good if the -- if\nthe mere issuance of the grand jury subpoena renders the\nperson not a complaining witness.\nMR. PINCUS: I don't think --\nJUSTICE ALITO: In that situation, then why\nnot subpoena everybody?\nMR. PINCUS: I don't think the mere issuance\nof the subpoena does negate things that might -- take\nthe hypothetical where there is someone who goes to the\nprosecutor, says there should be a prosecution here,\nmaybe does the things that the hospital is alleged to\nhave done in this case, and then subsequently is\nsubpoenaed. I don't think the subpoena negates that\nprior activity. I don't think you can say, oh, now that\nyou're subpoenaed, we wipe away everything that you have\ndone to set the prosecution in motion.\nBut I think in the hypothetical that you\npropounded, where there's -- the sole fact is someone\ndoesn't do anything, they're subpoenaed to come before\nthe grand jury and they give their evidence, that\nwouldn't meet the test. But --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: In a case where the\nprosecutor is the prime mover, can there ever be a\ncomplaining witness? Where the prosecutor is making the\ndecisions, can there ever be a complaining witness?\nMR. PINCUS: I think there can be, Your\nHonor. And, in fact, what this Court has indicated in\nother cases is that the fact that the prosecutor\nultimately decides to seek the charge does not negate\nwhat's happened before.\nIn the Hartman case, which dealt with a\nretaliatory prosecution under -- a First Amendment\nretaliation prosecution, the Court said the postal\ninspectors, who in that case were alleged to have been\nthe motivating force behind the retaliatory prosecution,\ncould be held liable if there also was no probable\ncause.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is the prosecutor a\ncomplaining witness?\nMR. PINCUS: The prosecutor can't be a\ncomplaining witness because the complaining witness is\nthe person who provides the impetus to go forward.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Who instigates the\nprosecutor.\nMR. PINCUS: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. What about the\nperson who instigates the instigator?\nMR. PINCUS: I'm not -- I'm not sure of\nthe --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, somebody who comes up\nto somebody and says: You know, you ought to -- you\nought to --\nMR. PINCUS: At common law --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- try to start a\nprosecution against this person. They say: Yeah,\nthat's a good idea. So, that person goes and -- and\ngets a prosecution started.\nMR. PINCUS: And at common law that person\ncould be -- could be liable for malicious prosecution\nbecause --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The person who\ninstigates the instigator?\nMR. PINCUS: The person who in testimony --\na complaining witness, as Your Honor pointed out in --\nin your opinion in Kalina, a complaining witness does\nnot have to actually participate in the judicial\nproceedings. To be a complaining witness at common law,\nyou could be a person who outside the judicial process\npushed forward and was the mover behind the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, the instigator of the\ninstigator is -- is a complaining witness or can be?\nMR. PINCUS: Can be.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you know what the next\nquestion's going to be, right?\nMR. PINCUS: But tort law -- I mean --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The instigator of the\ninstigator of the instigator. I mean, does this go back\nforever?\nMR. PINCUS: I think that's right, Your\nHonor. But I don't think the Court is writing on a\nblank slate here. Tort law has addressed these issues.\nThere has been a malicious prosecution tort for hundreds\nof years. There certainly was in 1871, and tort law has\ndealt and continues to deal with the questions of\ncausation and proximate cause and all of the questions\nthat arise in these kinds of cases. So, it's not as if\nthe Court here would be writing on a blank slate.\nAnd I think the critical thing is -- the\nquestion here is whether or not there was an absolute\nimmunity rule in 1871 for persons in the situation of\nthe Respondent. That is the critical question that the\nCourt has framed.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: He -- the instigator,\nwhat you call the complaining witness, would have\nbeen immune if he gave the identical testimony at the\ntrial itself, right?\nMR. PINCUS: Yes, trial -- because --\nbecause -- well, the trial testimony could not be the\nbasis for finding the person a complaining witness\nbecause by that point, the prosecution has gotten\nrolling. The question is, what conduct can be used to\nprove that this is the person who was the instigator,\nthe prime mover behind the prosecution?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It's only -- it's only\nwhat you call the complaining witness that gets this\nspecial treatment? All the other witnesses before the\ngrand jury would be absolutely immune?\nMR. PINCUS: Yes, Your Honor. That's what\nthe common law rule was, and that's what Congress\nconfronted when it enacted section 1983 in 1871.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Could I make sure I\nunderstand what you just said, Mr. Pincus? When you\nsaid it can't be the testimony alone, is that right,\nthat there have to be other acts exclusive of the\ntestimony that make somebody a complaining witness?\nMR. PINCUS: No, Your Honor, it could be the\ntestimony alone. I didn't mean to say that. I think\nwhat I meant to say, maybe in response to\nJustice Alito's question, was the fact of testifying\nunder subpoena doesn't negate other evidence that's\nthere. But the testimony alone can be enough, and there\ncertainly are cases, common law cases, from the 1800s in\nwhich courts rely on testimony.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Rely on testimony, but rely\non testimony exclusively; do you have any cases that do\nthat?\nMR. PINCUS: Well, the cases are -- the\ncases are a little bit obscure, Your Honor, about what\nthe facts are that they are relying on. So, I don't\nwant to say that absolutely positively there's one --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand.\nMR. PINCUS: But I think, as a matter of\nlogic --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I really don't understand\nthis. You have one witness in the grand jury\nproceedings. That's the only witness. Can that witness\nfall within your rule and be the complaining witness?\nMR. PINCUS: Absolutely, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Just on the basis of the\ntestimony alone?\nMR. PINCUS: Yes. But there could be --\nthere could be other evidence as well. I think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, it's pretty risky to\ntestify in a grand jury proceeding, then, right?\nMR. PINCUS: Well, the same --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Because even though you\nhaven't -- you don't care whether it comes out that way\nor not. You're subpoenaed, and even though you're\nsubpoenaed, you're going to hold me as a complaining\nwitness.\nMR. PINCUS: It's the same risk that the\naffiants bore in Kalina and Malley, and it's the same\nrisk that the common law imposes on complaining\nwitnesses.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, the affiants came\nforward. I mean, that -- that's a different situation,\nisn't it? They, indeed, were self-starting. But the\nperson who is subpoenaed to testify at a grand jury is\nnot self-starting. And you're saying that that person's\nmere presence and the mere fact of that person's\ntestifying is enough to hold him to be the complaining\nwitness.\nMR. PINCUS: Your Honor, maybe I've confused\nthe hypotheticals. I think we have one situation where\nthere's someone -- all they've done is they've been\nsubpoenaed and they've come forward and they've given\ntheir evidence.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. PINCUS: I think it would be very hard\nfor that person to be labeled a complaining witness.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Hard or impossible?\nMR. PINCUS: Impossible. Then you have a\nperson --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Hard or impossible?\nMR. PINCUS: I think it would be impossible,\nbecause I don't think there's any evidence that that\nperson is the motivating force.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. That's a different\nword. Thank you. So, the testimony alone cannot be the\nbasis?\nMR. PINCUS: Compelled testimony alone. A\nperson who testifies --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nMR. PINCUS: -- voluntarily before the grand\njury I think is a different situation.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But you said that the\nissuance of a subpoena in itself is not sufficient to\nmake somebody not a complaining witness. So, if you are\nissued a subpoena, you still might be a complaining\nwitness if you really didn't need to get a subpoena. If\nyou could have been persuaded to go without a subpoena,\nthen maybe you're -- you could be a complaining witness.\nMR. PINCUS: No, Your Honor. I think I was\nresponding to a third -- a third situation. So, we have\none situation where all someone does is testify under\nsubpoena. We have another situation where someone\ntestifies, that person not a complaining witness,\nsomeone who testifies voluntarily; that voluntary\ntestimony certainly could be used as evidence that\nperson --\nJUSTICE ALITO: I mean, somebody gets\nmugged --\nMR. PINCUS: And then the third situation --\nexcuse me, Your Honor. I was just -- the third\nsituation is where there's pre-testimony evidence, and\nthere's also the fact that that person testified under\nsubpoena. I don't think the fact that that person\ntestified under subpoena negates the fact that there is\nother evidence that that person may have been the person\nwho pushed the prosecution forward. So, that's the\ndistinction that I was trying to draw.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But what is the reason why,\nif we give absolute immunity to the witness at a trial,\nwe give absolute immunity to the prosecutors and\ngovernment officials at the trial, and a grand jury is\nsort of like a trial, at least it's testimony under\noath. And in addition there's this special thing about\ngrand juries being secret, which, if you allow people\nwho are annoyed -- and they'd be quite rightly angry.\nThey've been acquitted. They had to go through this\nprocess. They want to sue somebody. If we let them\nsue, you'll wreck the secrecy in a lot of cases. So, I\nsee a reason for treating the grand jury even more\nstrictly. What's the reason for treating it less\nstrictly?\nMR. PINCUS: Well, I think there are two\nreasons, Your Honor. The first reason is that what this\nCourt has said is that immunity decisions are based on\nthe common law as --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose I don't accept\nthat. Suppose I say, yes, I accept that, there's a\nrelationship, but exactly what happened in 1871 is not\nprecisely always the convincing feature for me. So, I\nread what the situation is today, and it is, I think, as\nI described it. So, given the situation today, my\nquestion remains.\nMR. PINCUS: Well, one -- one brief\ndisagreement with your question, Your Honor. I think\nthe situation today at common law is what it was.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You can't disagree with my\nquestion.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. PINCUS: But --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I would like an answer to\nmy question.\nMR. PINCUS: The answer is several-fold.\nThe Court has given absolute immunity to witnesses in\nBriscoe. The policy reason -- the principal reason was\nthe common law rule. The policy reasons that the Court\ngave were (a) we don't want to deter people from coming\nforward; and (b) the testimony will be put through the\nadversary process and is public, and those are\nprotections against false testimony.\nIn the -- in the grand jury situation, those\nprotections are not present, neither transparency nor an\nadversary process. And what the Court said in Malley\nabout people coming forward I think applies in the grand\njury context as well to complaining witnesses. The\nCourt in Malley said we want people who are setting the\nprosecution in motion, the special category of\ncomplaining witnesses -- we want them to think twice.\nThat's not a bad thing when they are the motivating\nforce behind the prosecution.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I thought the\nwhole point of the grand jury was to protect citizens\nfrom unwarranted prosecutions. The grand jury initiates\nthe prosecution. So, why do we look back beyond that?\nThat's where the prosecution is initiated. You're not\nsubject to prosecution until the grand jury returns the\nindictment. So, why do we talk about complaining\nwitnesses initiating the prosecution?\nMR. PINCUS: I think -- well, we talk about\nthem, I think, because of the reality that there are\ncases, and the common law recognized that there were\ncases where the reason the prosecution got rolling was\nbecause either a private person or a government person\nwas the person who was pushing it along.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, somebody's is\nnot --\nMR. PINCUS: It's true that the grand jury\n-- I'm sorry.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, go ahead.\nMR. PINCUS: The grand jury's decision is a\nstep in the chain, but the Court has not said that, for\nexample, the judge's decision in Kalina and Malley to\nissue the warrant broke the causal link between the\nfalse testimony in the affidavits in those case. Even\nthough the judge was making an independent decision, the\nCourt recognized, as the common law recognized, that\nthere could be a causal chain back to the false\ntestimony which essentially tainted the decisionmaker,\nthe judge's decision, just as it taints the grand jury's\ndecision.\nAnd, in fact, what lower courts have said is\nthat it is only when there is an allegation of false\ntestimony or other impropriety in the grand jury that\nlooking back is possible. But, of course, that's the\nvery situation in this case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The question is, where do\nyou locate the grand jury? We have on the one side, you\nrecited Malley. That was an arrest warrant, testimony\nin support of an arrest warrant. Then we have the\ntrial, where everybody gets absolute immunity. And\ngrand jury is in between those two. So, why should we\nbracket it with the arrest warrant rather than with the\ntrial? The -- the arrest warrant is certainly\npre-prosecution.\nMR. PINCUS: Well, the first reason, Your\nHonor, is because that's what the common law did. And\nwhat the Court's -- the Court's inquiry here is to look\nat the common law and decide what Congress, when it\nenacted the statute in 1871, confronted. And when\nCongress enacted the statute in 1871, there were -- the\nrule was that complaining witnesses who testified before\ngrand -- that grand jury testimony of people who were\ncomplaining witnesses was not immunized as a basis for\nmalicious prosecution liability.\nWhat the Respondent is seeking here is to\nsay my grand jury testimony is immunized as a basis of\nsection 1983 liability. But at common law, that simply\nwasn't the rule. So, the first --\nJUSTICE ALITO: And at common law, did any\ngrand jury witnesses have absolute immunity from a claim\nfor malicious prosecution?\nMR. PINCUS: Well, the common law -- at\ncommon law -- at common law, it wasn't a question of\nimmunity. There was no defamation liability for any\nwitness.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, could there be --\nMR. PINCUS: The only liability was for\nmalicious prosecution.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And could there be malicious\nprosecution liability for a witness before a grand jury\nwho was not a, quote/unquote, \"complaining witness\"?\nMR. PINCUS: No, and that's the source of\nthe distinction that the Court drew in Malley and\nKalina.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So, you're not really asking\nus to adopt the common law rule, are you? You're asking\nfor a variation of the common law rule that's limited to\ncomplaining witnesses. Or are you going further? Are\nyou saying that no witness before a grand jury should\nhave absolute immunity from a so-called 1983 malicious\nprosecution claim?\nMR. PINCUS: No, Your Honor, we're not.\nWe're asking for exactly the rule that was at common\nlaw. What the Court has said in Kalina and Malley is --\nthe rule that the Court adopted there was based on\nprecisely the same distinction that we rely on here.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So, if I understand your\nanswer, that you're not -- it's -- this whole business\nabout complaining witness is irrelevant. It's any -- no\nwitness before a grand jury has absolute immunity.\nMR. PINCUS: No, Your Honor, it's\ncomplaining witnesses. The distinction that the common\nlaw drew -- all witnesses were immune from defamation.\nOnly -- the only people who could be subject to\nliability based on their testimony were people who\nqualified as complaining witnesses. That is why the\ncourt in Malley and Kalina drew the line it did. It\nsaid these people -- you were acting as a complaining\nwitness. The function you're performing by submitting\nthis affidavit is being a complaining witness. At\ncommon law, that function -- true, it wasn't technically\nimmune, but it was subject to liability. Liability\ncould be premised on those statements.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Any witness could -- who\nwould satisfy the elements of the malicious prosecution\ntort could be liable?\nMR. PINCUS: Yes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: All right. That's a little\ndifferent, isn't it?\nMR. PINCUS: Well, what the Court has\nsaid -- it said in Malley and Kalina, and what we're\nrelying on here -- is that those -- those people also --\nCongress would have recognized in 1871 that there could\nbe liability for people who fell into this category, and\nso --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you're saying that\nthe only people who would be subject to suit for the\nmalicious prosecution tort were complaining witnesses?\nMR. PINCUS: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Pincus, you -- in\nanswer to one of Justice Kagan's questions, you noted\nthat you really can't find a case where a court relied\nexclusively on the grand jury testimony. In most of the\ncases that I've reviewed, there's a discussion that both\nnon-grand jury and grand jury testimony was being relied\nupon; is that accurate?\nMR. PINCUS: I think that's right, Your\nHonor. It's awfully hard to tell, but I wouldn't want\nto represent there's one.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you tell me\nwhat -- the United States as amica is supporting vacatur\nand remand on the ground that there might be adequate\nindependent evidence from the grand jury testimony in\nthis case to sustain a cause of action. Do you agree\nwith their recommendation? And if you don't agree,\nassume that we were to adopt the United States'\nposition. What would be the independent evidence that\nyou have that would support a malicious prosecution\nclaim?\nMR. PINCUS: Well, there -- there is\nindependent evidence in this case, Your Honor, of --\nbefore the Respondent testified before the grand jury\nthere were -- there are allegations that he conspired\nwith the district attorney and others to fabricate the\nevidence that he gave. And that obviously --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now, the court below\ntook that into account and said: You're only relying on\nthe grand jury testimony to prove the conspiracy, and\nthat's not enough.\nMR. PINCUS: Well, Your Honor, I think that\nwhat the Eleventh Circuit said was because this was all\ndirected to the grand jury testimony, we're not going to\nseparate -- uphold -- hold that there could be liability\nbased on that alone.\nI think that's wrong for two reasons. First\nof all, our principal submission, of course, is there\ncan be liability premised on the grand jury testimony\nand that there's no basis in the common law for a\ndifferent rule.\nAnd our second position would be, even if\nyou, the Court, thought that grand jury testimony for\nsome reason was off limits but became permissible as a\nbasis for finding liability if there was other evidence,\nthen that's true in this case as well.\nI want to return to Justice Breyer's\nquestion for 1 minute, because there was the third\npolicy reason that I wanted to provide, which is, as we\nexplain in our brief, in the States many prosecutors can\nproceed by information or indictment, and we think it\nwould be a peculiar situation if liability could be\npremised when a proceeding is initiated by information,\nwhich Malley and Kalina make clear, but that if the\nproceeding is by grand jury, it would be wholly off\nlimits. That doesn't make much sense, and it's totally\ninconsistent with the common law rule.\nI'd like to reserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Jones.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN C. JONES\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. JONES: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe way the Respondent sees it is the\nextension of Briscoe into the absolute immunity for all\nwitnesses in the grand jury with no distinction with\nrespect to whether they are the complaining witness or\notherwise.\nAs this Court has said in Briscoe, that the\n-- you look at the purpose of protecting the witnesses,\nboth at the grand jury proceeding and at trial, and you\nwant to preserve every man's evidence and you want to\nkeep the court from harassment --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You would acknowledge that\nif someone instigates the grand jury proceeding but does\nnot testify, that person could be sued if indeed the\ninstigation was malicious?\nMR. JONES: If it's outside of the grand\njury -- and I go for the but-for test, unlike the Van de\nKamp --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, now, just answer my\nquestion. I've given you a hypothetical. He -- no\ndoubt he instigated the grand jury proceeding. He got\nthe -- the U.S. attorney to bring the proceeding, but he\ndidn't testify. Could that person be sued?\nMR. JONES: Yes, that person could be sued\nunder the but-for standard.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. So, all he has to do\nto get himself off the hook is, after instigating it, he\nshould testify, right? His testimony bathes him clean;\nis that it?\nMR. JONES: No, that isn't, because --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: All right. So, then it --\nso, all you're arguing, then, is that there has to be\nsome evidence other than the mere testimony; is that\nyour point?\nMR. JONES: That is my point.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nMR. JONES: That there has to be some\nevidence other than the mere testimony. And if there is\nevidence other than the mere testimony, indeed you can\ngo forward with a 1983 claim.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then you agree with the\n-- with the position that the United States took, which\nis you can -- if there were -- there was evidence\noutside the grand jury proceeding that this person was\nthe instigator, that that could be the basis for a\nmalicious prosecution 1983 claim? I thought the United\nStates' position was: We're not going to use the\ntestimony before the grand jury, but if this person did\nthings outside the grand jury to instigate the\nprosecution, that's -- that could --\nMR. JONES: The way I understand the\nSolicitor General's position was that if the only way\nthat you could prove the allegation was to use the grand\njury testimony, then indeed you could not bring a suit\nunder 1983. But I think as Justice Scalia's question\nwas proffered is that it was an independent act that in\nand of itself created a constitutional violation,\nindependent, and actually caused the prosecution. Then\nindeed --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Jones, you --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, do you agree that we\nshould vacate and remand according to the suggestion of\nthe Solicitor General?\nMR. JONES: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And why is that?\nMR. JONES: Well --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it just because of your\nview of the evidence, that there's no evidence to\njustify the remand?\nMR. JONES: Well, that's certainly one of\nthe issues. But nothing like this was -- what the\nSolicitor General is recommending, none of those issues\nwere raised below, none of those issues were raised in\nthe court of appeals in the Eleventh Circuit, and in\nthis --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you're saying that\nthis was waived and was just not in the case? Because\nusually if the issue wasn't discussed, that's the reason\nwe remand.\nMR. JONES: That's correct. It was waived,\nand it's -- and it's not before the Court, and that's\nnot why cert was granted.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand how it's\nwaived. I don't understand that. How was it waived?\nMR. JONES: It was never presented by any\nside at any -- to any place in the court below.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but if -- if there\nis -- if there is a theory of liability and we find that\nthere is -- that that theory is baseless, we don't\ngenerally dismiss the complaint if there are other\nallegations in the complaint that could support\nliability on another theory.\nMR. JONES: Well, certainly, I mean, this\ncase has to be -- it's going back to the district court\nanyway, as Your Honor is well aware. And perhaps it can\nbe raised again at that time with an amendment. But at\nthe present time, it's not in the case.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Jones, could I\nunderstand your responses to these questions? Because\nyou said to Justice Scalia the fact that there's been\ntestimony at the grand jury does not, if you will,\nimmunize the person from suit based on other acts. Can\nyou go further? In a suit based on other acts, could\nthe grand jury testimony come in as evidence?\nMR. JONES: If you look at common law,\nthat's exactly what happened. At common law, and as\nJustice Scalia mentioned in -- in his concurrence in\nKalina, what you had is two separate acts when you had a\nmalicious prosecution at common law. The first act was\nactually complaining and making a complaint to -- to get\na warrant; in other words, swearing at that point in\ntime. But there, again, the person that complained\nactually didn't have to be a witness.\nBut when he was a witness or when he or she\nbecame a witness at court, that testimony could then be\nused to show malice for the prosecution or for actually\nbringing the case.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So, all you're saying is\nthat there's absolute immunity for a suit based\nexclusively on grand jury testimony, and if the suit is\nbased on something else, the grand jury testimony can\ncome in.\nMR. JONES: That is correct, if indeed it's\nan independent cause of action outside of the court,\nyes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't know what an\nindependent cause of action could be, because it is the\ngrand jury proceeding that initiates the action. So,\nwhy would the common law permit it unless it recognized\nthat a complaining witness has to do something to get\nthe grand jury up and running --\nMR. JONES: Well --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- and go in and testify\nto something false to be liable for malicious\nprosecution? But the point I'm making is I don't see\nhow your position differs from the Government's at all,\nand I'm not sure what -- how you could have independent\nguilt proven that requires anything more than proof,\nthan the proof they proffered below, which was that this\npolice officer issued subpoenas and took other steps to\nstart the grand jury's process. And then you use their\ntestimony at the grand jury to figure out whether it was\nfalse or not.\nMR. JONES: First of all, to respond, one,\nour position with respect to the Solicitor General on\nthat issue, I don't see it as any different. What I was\nsuggesting, what I understood Justice Scalia to say, is\nwhen you have something independent that forms a cause\nof action, for example, if you take and plant evidence\nin of a crime, for example cocaine or something of that\nnature, that is a separate and distinct cause of action,\nand that would cause -- that action by an investigator\nmight very well cause the -- the prosecution or the\ndistrict attorney to act when indeed you would have --\nthey would find something --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is it different from -- I\nmean, I find the Solicitor General -- it's my fault, I'm\nsure -- I don't understand the position they're taking.\nI mean, I think in every case there's some evidence\nabout what goes on outside the courtroom or the grand\njury room, and then there is some evidence about what\nwent on inside. And I don't know when you're supposed\nto introduce what.\nSo, I'm guessing that -- that whatever the\nrule is about when you can use what parts of what, that\nif you win, the rule about when you should use or when\nyou still can use the testimony that's given in the\ngrand jury room is the same as the rule that says when\nyou can use the testimony of a witness at trial.\nSee, I would have thought that immunity\nmeans you can't use that testimony, but I'm told I'm\nwrong about that. You sometimes can use it. So, then I\ndon't know when you can use it and when you can't.\nMaybe you know. You've studied this case. I admit I\nhaven't studied it as thoroughly as I hope you have.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. JONES: I hope I have as well.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. JONES: At least as I understand with\nrespect to -- first of all, if you look at Briscoe,\neverything that's in Briscoe, as you know, is absolutely\nimmune from civil damage litigation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: When you say absolutely\nimmune, I'm thinking of a typical case as follows:\nSmith says to his friend: I hate that rat Jones. I am\ngoing to go and lie and say he stole my horse.\nNext step, he goes to the grand jury or\nsomeone and says: Jones stole my horse.\nThird step, he's in the grand jury room\nsaying: Jones stole my horse.\nFourth, he's at trial. Okay?\nSo, what comes in and what doesn't? And can\nyou bring a case in the first place?\nMR. JONES: Well, I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm at sea. Whatever you\ncan help me with, I'd be happy.\nMR. JONES: First of all -- and it might be\na difficult time. But the -- when you have a grand\njury, you have something different from just bringing a\ncause of action. What you have in a grand jury is you\nhave evidence presented to the prosecutor, typically a\ndistrict attorney, and then the district attorney makes\nan independent evaluation as to what to bring to the\ngrand jury and who to indict or whether to indict\nanybody whatsoever.\nThat testimony in that grand jury -- if you\nbring a cause of action, for example if a cause of\naction is brought for malicious prosecution, which\nthey're trying to do here, what this Court has said in\nthe Van de Kamp case is that the only time that you can\nuse that testimony is if there is something else outside\nof the grand jury --\nJUSTICE BREYER: There's always something\nelse. He didn't think of this thing for the first time\nin the grand jury room. The defendant thought of this\nthing outside the grand jury room before he even got to\nthe grand jury, and he probably told somebody about it,\nor he could have, or at least there's the evidence he\nwalked to the grand jury room. Okay? So, there's\nalways something outside the grand jury.\nMR. JONES: Sure. Sure. But the case law\nsays that if the prosecutor would not have taken the\ncase or would not have done the case but for the conduct\nof that individual, then indeed you cannot bring the\ncause of action.\nJUSTICE ALITO: I have the same -- I have\nthe same concern as Justice Breyer. And let me try to\nask the question in a different way.\nCan you give me an example of a case in\nwhich someone would qualify as a complaining witness\nunder Mr. Pincus's definition and yet would not have\ndone something outside of the grand jury that would be\nsufficient to make out a claim of malicious prosecution?\nIf that situation doesn't exist, then I don't see any\ndifference between your position and Mr. Pincus's\nposition.\nMR. JONES: It does exist, because typically\nwhen you have an investigation in any type of district\nattorney's office, what you have is investigators going\nout and investigating a case, bringing the material to\nthe district attorney, then the district attorney looks\nat the material, and then the district attorney is the\none that makes an independent decision.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, let's go back one\nstage. Let's go back to an arrest warrant. The\nwitness -- and the concern that the affidavit in support\nof the warrant is filled with lies. The affidavit is\npresented to a judge. And I would think that's better\nthan a prosecutor. And yet, there is no absolute\nimmunity for someone who lies in order to get a warrant,\neven though the judge makes the judgment whether the\nwarrant should issue.\nMR. JONES: The distinction in Malley is --\nis this: First of all, the -- in Malley and when you go\napply for a warrant, the -- the -- at that point in time\nthe investigator is -- he is determining, he or she is\ndetermining, the time, place, and manner in which to go\nto the judge, and also possibly he can, he or she can,\nselect the judge that the person wants to go for. And\nthen what has happened is that person who presents that\nevidence is presenting the evidence that he or she has\ngathered and is going to present it in a light most\nfavorable to the investigation. That person won't\nnecessarily present the bad part. They might present\njust only the -- exclusively the good part. And also\nthat person isn't under the subpoena power.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose -- suppose we\nhad, instead of a grand jury proceeding and an\nindictment, an accusation to begin the prosecution and a\nsupporting affidavit in connection with the accusation.\nWould there be -- would there be absolute immunity then\nfor the affidavit that supports the accusation which\nwill begin the prosecution?\nMR. JONES: If I understand your question,\nand I'm not sure I heard it exactly, are you saying if\nthere's an affidavit that went before the grand jury?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: No. We take the grand\njury out of it. We're going to begin the case, the\nprosecution, by an information, or I think the Georgia\nlaw refers to something called an accusation. If -- if\nwe're not before a grand jury and the prosecution is\ninstituted by an information and there is an affidavit\nsupporting that information, is there absolute immunity\nfor the false affidavit in support of the information?\nMR. JONES: Once again, that's a scenario\nessentially in Malley and Kalina, where you had those\nindividuals coming before -- they were not subpoenaed.\nThose individuals -- whether it's affidavit or\ntestimony, I think either one is testimony.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you -- you cited a\nprovision of the Georgia Code that seems to equate\nwhat's called an accusation with an indictment. It's on\nthe bottom of page 22: \"All legal proceedings by which\na person's liability for a crime is determined,\ncommencing with the return of the indictment or the\nfiling of the accusation.\"\nSo, if the Georgia Code equates those two,\nthe return of the indictment or the filing of the\naccusation, why shouldn't the immunity rule be the same\nfor the two? And you told me that Malley would cover\nthe filing of the accusation. So, why shouldn't it be\nthe same for the return of the indictment?\nMR. JONES: And -- and I'm not positive I\nunderstand the question, but as I understand it, what\nyou have in a Malley situation is, again, you have\nsomebody that is merely coming before the judge in the\nhope of getting a warrant to issue. That person\ndoesn't -- isn't under the constraint of a prosecutor,\nan independent prosecutor, in the meantime. Actually,\nthe person asking the questions, asking and actually\nsubpoenaing a witness for like a grand jury, that person\nis actually -- and what the Court has said is\npotentially wasting judicial resources by bringing a\nnot-so-good case, just like in Malley, to the court.\nAnd so, to protect the court and to protect\nthe judicial process, the Court has said that person\nonly has qualified immunity so as to make him think and\nmake the process think before it happens, before they go\nto the judge.\nBut in the grand jury scenario you have an\nindependent individual, in this case the prosecutor,\nreceiving the evidence and the prosecutor deciding what\ncases to bring.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, explain to me\nagain -- over here, Mr. Jones.\nExplain to me again why the act of sitting\ndown with the prosecutor in his office and telling him a\nfalsehood that leads the prosecutor to convene the grand\njury and call you as a witness, why that act of meeting\nwith the prosecutor and stating the false statement is\nnot actionable independently?\nOr is it your position that that would be?\nMR. JONES: It is the position that it can\nbe, and -- and I hate to say -- equivocate there. But I\nwill state this: If indeed that district attorney or\nthe prosecutor in a case would not have proceeded but\nfor that testimony or that statements before him, in\nother words, he would not have done anything there,\nlike, as I stated earlier, like the planting of the\ncocaine or the finding of the cocaine --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, no, no, no. He sat\ndown, told the prosecutor exactly what he was later\ngoing to say in the grand jury. I rarely called a\nwitness to a grand jury when I was a prosecutor who I\nhadn't spoken to before. Occasionally, I had to because\nof circumstances, but the vast majority you sit down and\ntalk to and find out what their story is. Identical\nstory before and after during the grand jury. Is the\nstory before an independent act sufficient to bring a\nmalicious prosecution claim?\nMR. JONES: Under that scenario, no, because\nthe only way that that act can be proven, the only way\nthat the malicious prosecution claim can be proven,\nwould be to get the grand jury testimony before -- to\nactually utilize that grand jury testimony, and that\ntestimony is absolutely protected under Briscoe.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You have a time sheet\nthat shows that the prosecutor met with --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- the investigator?\nMR. JONES: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You have a time sheet.\nYou mean, you need a witness to say they met together?\nYou need someone to say that they talked before the\ngrand jury? Assuming you have that much evidence, you\nthink that's enough?\nMR. JONES: I mean, do you need a witness to\ncome and testify as to whether they had a communication?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Yes, exactly. Is that\nwhat you're requiring?\nMR. JONES: It -- it would appear that that\nwould certainly be an element that you would have to\nestablish. Now, whether you would need a witness or you\ncan get one of those two to testify is another issue.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you regard the grand\njury as a judicial proceeding?\nMR. JONES: Yes, I do. And this Court has\nso stated, not only in -- well, the Court has stated\nfirst of all in Burns v. Reed; it talks about how you\nhave prosecutorial immunity. And in Malley, it also\nstates it's the first stage of the criminal proceeding.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But -- but there's no\njudge. And it seems to me odd to say -- there's no\npresiding judge, there's no cross-examination. And the\nindictment has the same function as an information. So,\nwhy should it rank as a judicial proceeding?\nMR. JONES: Well, it has many more of the\ntrappings of a trial than, say, coming before a judge\nlike in the Malley scenario. First of all, you're\nsubject to compulsory process. The person is placed\nunder oath. The person may indeed not even want to come\nand testify. I think that was earlier mentioned by\nJustice Scalia. The person might not even want to be\nthere, and yet he's subpoenaed and he's forced to be\nthere.\nThe -- also in that situation, the district\nattorney, he or she, is the one that's controlling the\nevidence, one that's controlling what is before the\ncourt, and that person is also determining which person\nis going to be indicted and the evidence to be\npresented.\nSo, the distinction between the two is, as I\nsee it, significant. And one, the grand jury, is much\nmore akin to a judicial proceeding and a trial than the\nscenario you have in Malley.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is the prosecutor immune?\nI know the prosecutor is not immune or the complaining\nwitness is not when they get an arrest warrant. Is the\nprosecutor immune when he is taking the step of getting\nan information or indictment?\nMR. JONES: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: He is immune?\nMR. JONES: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So, this is\nequivalent to doing that. That's a prosecutorial\nfunction. The prosecution would be immune.\nMR. JONES: That is correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Of course, this isn't a\nprosecutor; this is a subordinate. The person here is\nthe defendant who is not the prosecutor --\nMR. JONES: No, the person here is the\ninvestigator who's employed by the prosecutor. And I\nthink, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, the prosecutor\nhimself in this situation directed the investigator to\nappear before the grand jury, and directed him as to\nwhat to testify to at the grand jury. So -- and as Your\nHonor pointed out, the -- who is absolutely immune, in\nthe grand jury setting the prosecutor is immune, the\ngrand jurors are immune. In trial, the prosecutor is\nalso immune, any of the witnesses testifying is immune.\nIt makes logical sense that anybody that comes before\nthe grand jury is likewise immune.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is there any subordinate\ngovernment official involved when a prosecutor gets an\ninformation, files an information or -- the way you get\nsomebody indicted is you have an indictment, which is a\ngrand jury, I guess.\nMR. JONES: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Or an information.\nMR. JONES: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. When you get\nthe information, is it just somebody from the district\nattorney's office or the prosecutor's office, or is\nthere somebody else there? Is there a policeman there\nthat gives any --\nMR. JONES: There can be.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can be, okay. If there is,\nhas he ever been held immune or not? The prosecutor is\nimmune. Now he's there with an assistant, the policeman\nto back him up. Is there any law on that, whether the\npoliceman is immune?\nMR. JONES: Just if he's asking for an\narrest warrant; is that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, the arrest warrant,\nhe's not immune. We know he's not that. It's just he\nfiles the information.\nMR. JONES: He files the information, and\nit's not in a grand jury setting? No.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No.\nMR. JONES: Then indeed, I would suggest\nit's very similar to the Malley scenario, where he would\nhave a qualified immunity.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And that would go for the\nprosecutor, too, right?\nJUSTICE BREYER: No.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: For the information? If\nyou -- if you bracket it with Malley, the -- the\nprosecutor who lies to the magistrate is not going to\nhave absolute immunity at the arrest warrant stage. Is\nthe prosecutor absolutely immune for making out an\ninformation that's packed with lies?\nMR. JONES: Yes. Because that is -- that is\nwhat this Court has decided is intimately associated\nwith the judicial phase of the criminal process. And\nany of the conduct that is intimately associated under\nImbler, under Kalina, under various things,\nBurns v. Reed are intimately -- anything that's\nintimately associated is absolutely immune.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why isn't -- why isn't an\narrest warrant intimately associated?\nMR. JONES: Well, an arrest warrant in the\n-- like in a Kalina and a Malley situation, you didn't\nhave a prosecutor going before them. That was an\nindependent action by an investigator who went before a\njudge to seek a warrant and present any evidence that\nthat person had.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Paragraph 29 of the\ncomplaint alleges Mr. Paulk and Mr. Hodges, acting under\ncolor of law, in retaliation and wrongfully influenced\nand instigated the prosecutorial decision to bring\ncharges against Mr. Rehberg.\nWhy isn't that sufficient to support a claim\nof so-called malicious prosecution without regard to the\nevidentiary -- without regard to the grand jury\ntestimony?\nMR. JONES: Because -- just because they\nallegedly conspired together to do this doesn't mean the\nact was completed until after, in this case, Mr. Hodges\n-- and it was actually Kelly Burke -- actually performed\nwhat they did. Now -- and -- and if the prosecutor\nknows about it at that point and they allegedly\nconspire, now who is taking the act? It really is not\nanymore Mr. Paulk; it is the district attorney who is\nacting at that point, and it is the district attorney\nthat is now proceeding in the grand jury. And as -- as\nI pointed out earlier, if -- anything that's intimately\nassociated with the judicial phase, and he's absolutely\nimmune for his conduct. But even -- just because the\ndistrict attorney knows about it and so does the\ninvestigator know about it, it is the conduct and the\nindependent act now of the prosecutor to get the\nindictment.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Jones, I feel as\nthough now we're just arguing about facts. It seems to\nme that you have accepted a good deal of Mr. Pincus's\ncase. You've said that you can bring an action against\nsomebody based on acts outside of court, that the grand\njury testimony can come in as evidence in that action,\nand all you're saying is that there's -- there's no way\nto bring this action in this case because your client\ndidn't in fact do anything.\nMR. JONES: No. And perhaps that's not my\nposition. First of all, I'm not saying that they're --\nwhat I'm saying with respect to bringing a malicious\nprosecution claim is that -- I think Justice Scalia\nasked me if there is a completely independent act, but\nif -- in the scenario that you paint, just the fact that\nthey've talked outside the grand jury, that does not\nauthorize an independent cause of action for a malicious\nprosecution claim.\nWhat you have to have is an independent act,\njust like what you had at common law where you had two\ndistinct acts: one, where you actually filed a\ncomplaint; now you become the complainant or, as the\ncommon law said, you became the complaining witness even\nthough you didn't have to be a witness. But then if you\nwere a witness, indeed, that testimony that you gave in\nthe -- in the grand jury or in the trial could be used\nas to -- to prove your malicious intent in bringing the\ncharge initially.\nAnd that -- that doesn't equate to what we\nhave here in this -- in this scenario. What we have\nhere is there may have been a discussion outside of the\ncourt or outside of the grand jury, but that discussion\nnow ended, and now you have an independent act by the\nprosecutor to bring the cause of action. So, completely\ndistinct, as I see it, completely distinct scenarios.\nIf there are no further questions, thank you\nvery much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Pincus, you have 4 minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. PINCUS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. PINCUS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nA couple of points. First of all, the --\nthe question about whether there -- it's an appropriate\nrule that a finding of complaining witness can be based\non evidence outside of the grand jury, but it can't be\nbased on grand jury testimony, that certainly wasn't the\ncommon law rule. And I note Justice Sotomayor asked\nwhether there were any common law cases that relied\nsolely on grand jury testimony. And although the cases\nare hard to parse, I would point the Court to the\nAnderson and the Moulton cases that we cite on page 3 of\nour reply brief. In those cases, in the Anderson case,\nthe Court is talking about the charge to the jury, and\nwhat it says the evidence was is the fact that the\ndefendant was listed as the complainant on the\nindictment and that he testified before the grand jury.\nAnd then in the Moulton case, the allegations of the\ncomplaint are set forth in the reporting of the case,\nand the only allegations are -- relate to the testimony\nbefore the grand jury.\nSo, I think it's very hard to find any basis\nin the common law, which as the Court said -- has said\nis the controlling principle here, for ruling the grand\njury testimony either entirely out of bounds as a basis\nfor liability or for saying it's only in bounds if there\nis some other extrinsic evidence. There's just no\nsupport for that in the common law, and I think it\ndoesn't really make sense -- if this case had proceeded\nby information and Mr. Paulk's grand jury testimony had\nsimply been placed in an affidavit and submitted in\norder to obtain the arrest warrant, Malley and Kalina\nwould control, and it would be clear that there would be\nliability --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, suppose this was a\njurisdiction that didn't have grand juries but returned\nfelony indictments by means of a preliminary hearing.\nWould a witness at a preliminary hearing have absolute\nimmunity? There's a judge presiding there.\nMR. PINCUS: A -- a complaining witness, I\ndon't think -- if that is the proceeding that sets\nthe -- that determines whether or not there's going to\nbe a prosecution, I think an ordinary witness would be\nabsolutely immune, but a complaining witness would not\nbe.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Are there States that have\n-- or are there any jurisdictions where they don't give\nimmunity to grand jury testimony for complaining\nwitnesses or others?\nMR. PINCUS: Yes, there are. There are.\nThere are both at the common law and today, Your Honor;\nthere are --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Today are there a lot?\nMR. PINCUS: There are -- I don't know the\nnumber.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But, I mean, is there any\nway to find out what's happened? Have they been -- have\nthe grand juries been undermined? Have they not been\nundermined? I mean, what has actually happened in those\nplaces?\nMR. PINCUS: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can you give me an example\nof one or two States that allow these actions?\nMR. PINCUS: Well, I can -- I can't give you\nan example of States. I can give you the example of\nseven circuits that -- that have adopted the rule that\nwe contend for. I don't think --\nJUSTICE BREYER: For how long have they had\nthat?\nMR. PINCUS: Excuse me?\nJUSTICE BREYER: For how long?\nMR. PINCUS: For -- some of them since\nMalley, certainly since Kalina, about 10 years.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And -- and have there been\nmany such grand jury actions?\nMR. PINCUS: There have been some cases. No\none has said that the grand jury process has been upset.\nCourts have -- have looked into whether or not there's a\ncomplaining witness. Some courts say, in order to get\ngrand jury testimony, you have to -- you have to meet\nsome kind of a threshold. Often, these cases are proven\nup by deposing the defendant and asking him what he\ntestified about before the grand jury without intruding\non the grand jury at all. But I think those seven\ncircuits, there has been no indication of some kind of\ndisruption of the process.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Are those -- are those cases\ninvolving grand jury proceedings like the one here,\nwhich does look somewhat like the complaint situation?\nOr are they more traditional grand jury settings?\nMR. PINCUS: I don't -- I don't want to -- I\ndon't know, Your Honor. We'd be happy to file something\nfurther, if the Court would like.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: To me, Mr. Pincus, the\noddest thing about your case is the notion of being able\nto sue the investigator when you can't sue the\nprosecutor for whom he works. So that even if there\nis -- are some set of people that you -- that you could\nsue for actions in the grand jury context, the notion\nthat you can sue an employee of a prosecutor when you\ncan't sue the prosecutor seems an odd rule.\nMR. PINCUS: Well, Your Honor, I think the\nquestion here would be a factual one, as you pointed\nout. Is Mr. Paulk the person who set this in motion?\nIf the testimony is -- may I finish?\nIf the testimony is that Mr. Paulk was just\ntold what to do by the prosecutor and didn't have any\nadditional anything, then perhaps he won't be found\nliable anyway.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
