GARRE\nON BEHALF OF PETE GEREN,\nSECRETARY OF THE ARMY, ET AL.\nMR. GARRE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nUnder this Court's precedents and universal\ninternational law norms, the government of Iraq, like\nall sovereign nations, has a sovereign right and\njurisdiction to try and punish individuals, including\nAmerican citizens, who voluntarily enter its borders,\ncommit crimes in its country, and remain there. In two\nindependent respects, the court of appeals in the Omar\ncase lost sight of that principle and departed from this\nCourt's precedents: First by exercising habeas\njurisdiction at all; and second by sustaining an\ninjunction that the court of appeals itself recognized\nprevented the government of Iraq from trying and\npunishing Mr. Omar for any crimes that he committed in\nIraq.\nAs to the jurisdictional question, we\nbelieve that this Court's decision Hirota versus\nMacArthur points to the conclusion that habeas\njurisdiction is lacking over these cases because the\nhabeas petitioners are being held under international\nauthority pursuant to determinations made by an\ninternational Multinational Force acting and carrying\nout a United Nations mandate, and in Mr. Munaf's case\npursuant to an order of the Iraqi courts that he remain\nin custody while proceedings go forward in the trial\ncourt.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't the problem with the\nargument that Hirota did not at any point in the per\ncuriam opinion saying -- say, we're coming to the\nconclusion that we come to of no jurisdiction because\nthere's an international force? I mean, Hirota said,\nyou know, there's this, that, and the other thing, and\nunder all these circumstances we don't think there's\njurisdiction. Well, one of the things that's different\nhere is you had Japanese soldiers in Hirota and you've\ngot American citizens here.\nMR. GARRE: Well, that is the difference,\nJustice Souter. And I think, to be clear, if this Court\ndoes find jurisdiction in these cases, we think that\ncitizenship would be a basis -- would have to be the\nbasis for jurisdiction, and we urge this Court to limit\nits decision to that ruling, because that would have\nprofound practical consequences.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There's another\ndifference, too. There was a conviction and a sentence\nin Hirota, here in Omar's case he has not yet been as\nfar as we know even investigated by the Iraqi courts,\ncertainly no conviction; and in Munaf's case the\nconviction has been quashed.\nMR. GARRE: That's true, and let me explain\nwhy we think that Hirota does govern the circumstances\nin this case, notwithstanding that this case involves\ncitizens and notwithstanding that the Petitioners in\nHirota had been the subject of an international\nconviction. First of all, we don't think that Hirota\nwould have come out differently if the habeas\npetitioners had filed suit earlier and sought to enjoin\nthe international proceeding in Hirota and sought an\ninjunction that would have prevented the conviction from\ntaking case.\nSecondly, we do think that, although one\nobviously has to take a careful look at the Court's\ndecision in Hirota, we think that what the Court did say\npoints to the conclusion that it was the international\nauthority that was key to the Court's finding that there\nwas no jurisdiction. I think there's at least a couple\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If it is, there's\nsomething -- the implication of that I think is what is\nbothersome, because in effect it means, if that rule is\napplied to this case, it means that the president acting\nalone can make an agreement for an international force\nor a cooperative force and that agreement of the\nexecutive alone in effect eliminates habeas jurisdiction\nover an American citizen. And that obviously is in\ntension, if not inconsistent, with the suspension clause\nand it's a little scary.\nMR. GARRE: Well, obviously the Court\nreached that conclusion in Hirota as to aliens. With\nrespect to citizens, I think that the key for the\njurisdictional question under the habeas statute is\nwhether or not these individuals are in custody under\nand by color of United States authority. Just as the\nCourt presumably concluded in Hirota that the\npetitioners in Hirota were not under custody under color\nof United States authority, we think that the\nPetitioners here are not. And so we think --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but in real world terms\nisn't it the case that they are under United States\nauthority? You've got an American commander, you've\nstraight-line authority right through, and -- and one\nknows -- to be realistic, one knows perfectly well that\nif any order were given to the American military\ninvolved, they would not hand them over, i.e., they\nwould obey the order, international -- agreement for\ninternational cooperation or not.\nMR. GARRE: If I can make --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Go ahead.\nMR. GARRE: -- two points in response to\nthat. First, ultimately the United Nations controls the\nstrings and the source and the scope of international\nauthority. The -- the current Security Council\nresolutions are set to expire in December. It could --\nit could eliminate those resolutions today and that\nsource of international authority would exist and we\nwouldn't be here arguing that these individuals are\nbeing held pursuant to international mandate.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Garre, just to\nclarify one point. The -- at the time of the briefing,\nthe U.N. resolution was due to expire in December of\n2007. Has it been renewed.\nMR. GARRE: There has been a subsequent\nresolution. It's Resolution 1790, and that resolution\nis set to expire this December. And the -- the\ngovernment of Iraq and the other parties have indicated\nthat this will be the last extension. Obviously,\nthey'll have to assess the situation in December. But\nthe international authority that existed at the time of\nthe briefing continues to exist.\nThe other point I was going to make,\nJustice Souter, is your point about American domination\nor influence over the Multinational Force was equally\ntrue with respect to the force in Hirota. You had --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I think -- I think you're\nright.\nMR. GARRE: So I don't think that that's a\nbasis for distinguishing Hirota. The --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It may be -- I mean, Hirota\nwas a literally, I think, a two- or three-day per curiam\nopinion. It occupied less than a page, and it had this\nkind of whole ball of wax sort of reasoning involved in\nit.\nAnd as precedential authority, if this case\nturned on the question of whether we look to the theory\nof international authority rather than, I think, the\nrealistic fact of American domination, I don't think\nHirota is a very strong precedent against our at least\ntaking the realistic view of it.\nMR. GARRE: Well, again, I think that Hirota\n-- the amount of influence that the United States forces\nhave over the international force isn't a basis for\ndistinguishing Hirota.\nBut to get to your point about citizenship,\nI guess we would say a few things. One, we that think\nthe Justice Douglas in his concurring opinion in Hirota\nand the court of appeals below recognized that the\ntheory of the Court's decision in Hirota doesn't lend\nitself to a citizenship exception. The habeas statute,\nas this Court emphasized in the Rasul case, doesn't have\na citizenship -- doesn't distinguish between citizens\nand aliens, and it has since 1789 contained the\nrequirement that the person be in custody under or by\ncolor of United States' authority. So --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So once again you're\nrelying on a concurring opinion by Justice Douglas?\nMR. GARRE: Not the concurring opinion.\nWe're relying on the Court's decision in Hirota, but we\nlook at the concurring opinion; we've looked at the\nbriefs. We've tried to discern the best principle of\nlaw from that decision. And the principle that we think\nit stands for is that where individuals are held under\ninternational authority by the judgment of several\nnations, not the law of any single nation, this Court\nlacks jurisdiction to review the custody of such\nindividuals.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Garre, it is at least\nequally plausible, I think, because it's the only factor\nthat Hirota mentions more than once, that the Court was\ngoing on its lack of power \"to review, to affirm, set\naside, or annul the judgments and sentences imposed\"\nthere. And here we have no judgment or sentence.\nSo I don't think you can pick one of these\nstrands, citizenship, and say, oh, that's it and it\nisn't the judgment and sentence. So I think we know\nyour position. This is an opinion that says \"under the\nforegoing circumstances.\" I don't think you can take it\nmuch further than saying citizenship was one of those\ncircumstances.\nMR. GARRE: If I can make a couple of\npoints. One, the parties in Hirota, the habeas\npetitioners, made very clear that they weren't asking\nthis Court to review the international conviction. They\nmade very clear that they were asking this Court to\nreview the actions of American officers under United\nStates law. They made that clear on page 14 of their\nmerits brief, where they said -- and I'm quoting here --\n\"We are not asking this Court to review the decision of\ninternational court\" -- end quote. And quoting again:\n\"All the questions deal solely with official actions\ntaken by General MacArthur as citizen and U.S. Army\nofficer.\" -- end quote. And again on page 15, quote:\n\"We repeat again that we bring into question only\nunlawful action taken by General MacArthur for us.\"\nThe other point that I would make is these\nindividuals -- they haven't been convicted pursuant to a\ntrial, like the individuals in Hirota, but these\nindividuals are being held pursuant to determinations\nmade by the Multinational Force carrying out the\ninternational mandate.\nIn Mr. Omar's case, he not only received a\nthree-judge tribunal shortly after his detention and\ncapture, but he also received a determination before a\nnine-officer combined review release board, consisting\nof six Iraqi officials and three Multinational Force\nofficials, who determined that he was a security\ninternee who should be detained in accordance with the\nUnited Nations mandate.\nNow, Mr. Munaf's case did proceed before the\nIraqi criminal court because an injunction was not\nentered against those proceedings. The Iraqi court\ninitially did enter a conviction. That conviction was\nreversed on appeal by the court of cassation. We think\nthat -- that the recent decision is significant in a\ncouple of respects. I think, one, it underscores there\nis an Iraqi legal system, that that system is capable of\nprocessing these cases and hearing from these\nindividuals, and is capable of granting relief where\nappropriate action isn't taken.\nAnd, two, the Iraqi court order setting\naside the conviction, much like an appellate order in\nthis country would, remanded the case for further\nproceedings but directed that Mr. Munaf and his\ncodefendant --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If it's in the materials,\nthen perhaps I should have known, but did the -- I take\nit Munaf was present and was represented by counsel?\nMR. GARRE: Yes, both.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But how did that work?\nWas he present in American custody and then he goes to\nthe Iraqi court?\nMR. GARRE: The individuals are detained by\nthe Multinational Force while there are proceedings\nbefore the Iraqi court --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So then he just goes every\nday to the Iraqi court and then he comes back at night\nto U.S. custody?\nMR. GARRE: Yes. In Mr. Munaf's case, there\nwere four investigative hearings and a trial, after\nwhich he was convicted.\nIn Mr. Omar's case, if he were -- if the\nproceedings were allowed to go forward, he would remain\nin MNF-I custody during the course of the Iraqi\nproceedings. And then, if there is a conviction and\nthat conviction is sustained on appeal, the Iraqi\ngovernment issues an order, a transfer order, to the\nMultinational Force. The Multinational Force makes a\ndetermination to carry out that order.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There are --\nMR. GARRE: And, again --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There are in the U.S.\ncustody a number of non-citizens. Is that -- how many\npeople are being held in the custody of\nthe Multinational Force that the United States controls?\nMR. GARRE: There are 24,000 people\ncurrently being held by the Multinational Force, the\nvast majority of whom obviously are aliens. Two\nthousand individuals held by the Multinational Force\nhave been transferred to Iraqi custody. Many if not\nmost of those individuals have undergone court\nproceedings because the Multinational Force is obviously\nworking in close coordination with the Iraqi government\nto bring to justice people who have committed crimes in\nIraq.\nAnd if I could turn to the second question,\nbecause we think that there is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: One more -- I'd like -- on\nthe first question, in reading through this, my\nimpression was that the government -- and the green\nbriefs, you know, the dark green briefs against you from\nthe Military Justice Institute and the national security\nspecialists really don't disagree. That is that\neverybody seems to agree, to use the words General Casey\nsaid, that U.S. soldiers in Iraq are subject to the\nauthority, direction, and control of the commander of\nthe U.S. Central Command. And you say in your brief\nthat really this multilateral force operates subject to\na unified American command, and the chain of command\nultimately runs to the President. So as a practical\nmatter it's the President and the Pentagon, the\nSecretary of Defense, and the American commanders that\ncontrol what our American soldiers do.\nI take it there's agreement on that point,\nbut where there's disagreement is that you say, well,\nthe same was true with that tribunal at issue in Hirota.\nAm I right about that?\nMR. GARRE: We say the same is true with\nrespect to the allied forces --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. So we're not -- we're\nnot -- I take its you say that, as a practical matter\nand as a matter of the chain of command, it runs through\nAmerican officers to American commanders to the\nSecretary of Defense to the President of the United\nStates. There is no disagreement about that, or is\nthere?\nMR. GARRE: There is not, Justice Breyer.\nAn American --\nJUSTICE BREYER: There is not.\nMR. GARRE: -- official has the supreme\ncommand --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Okay. Then if there\nis not -- if there is not, am I right in thinking the\nissue is whether, because the words -- there's some\nconnection with foreign governments, absolutely.\nThere's some, but it doesn't interfere with that chain\nof command. And now your point is: But the same was\ntrue with the tribunal at issue in Hirota.\nMR. GARRE: The same was true with respect\nnot only to the tribunal, but the allied forces --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, yes.\nMR. GARRE: -- in Hirota.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The same was true. It was\nGeneral MacArthur.\nMR. GARRE: That's correct. And ultimately\nthe key point, we think, is that those forces were\nacting under international mandate. The Far Eastern\nCommission in Hirota ultimately had say over what the\nforce could do --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well --\nMR. GARRE: -- whereas the United Nations\nhere ultimately has.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But that's because the\nPresident, I take it, would follow what the UN says, not\nbecause the chain of command would change.\nMR. GARRE: Well, I think that that's true,\nbut the point I wanted to make is that the United\nNations today could repeal the resolutions authorizing\nthis international force and the specific mission.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And if that happened, these\npeople would be released?\nMR. GARRE: They would be under the\nauthority of the United States. We wouldn't be here\narguing that this Court didn't have jurisdiction. So,\nultimately, an international body distinct from the\nUnited States is controlling the strings --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But the relevance of that\nis General MacArthur was an agent of several allied\npowers.\nMR. GARRE: As is, in our view, General\nPetraeus. He is sharing now the authority --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then, to me, it's a matter\nof Hirota at the moment, and the only distinction you\nhaven't addressed is at that time, I think in 1946, the\nbasic habeas rule was that you wouldn't question a\njudgment of a tribunal, at least not a foreign tribunal.\nAnd it was just beginning in the issue -- to question\njudgments in American tribunals. And, therefore, the\nobvious question is: Well, doesn't that explain Hirota?\nMR. GARRE: I don't think it does, for the\nreasons that I have already indicated to\nJustice Ginsburg. That wasn't the argument the parties\nwere making in Hirota. They went out of their way to\nsay that they weren't challenging the international\nconviction, that they were challenging the actions of\nthe American officers acting under international law.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the Court certainly\nlisted it as a circumstance; and, as I said before, it's\nthe only thing that's repeated in the opinion. But I\nthink that we've come to a standoff on that.\nMR. GARRE: It did. And if I could turn now\nto the second issue, because we do think there is a --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask just one\nquestion. Would your argument be the same if the place\nof detention was in the United States?\nMR. GARRE: Analytically, it would be the\nsame, Justice Stevens. As a practical matter, United\nStates forces don't act under international authority;\nand, thank goodness, Multinational Forces don't act in\nthe United States.\nIt would make a difference as to the second\nquestion, which is to say if the individuals were\ndetained in the United States and there was a question\nof transferring back to Iraq, that would be a classic\nextradition situation. And we'd have a whole different\nbody of case law governing these individuals --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And I suppose if he\nwere -- it would make a huge difference whether such an\nindividual were released in the United States as opposed\nto being released in Iraq.\nMR. GARRE: Absolutely. In Iraq it's\nundisputed that if the Multinational Force were to\nrelease them, the Iraqi authorities could arrest them,\ntake them into their custody. The injunction that we\nface today is one preventing the Iraqi courts from going\nforward with any proceedings against Mr. Omar,\npreventing the Multinational Force from sharing\ninformation with Iraqi authorities about the\ncircumstances of his release, and directly preventing\nthe Multinational Force from transferring these\nindividuals to Iraqi custody if they are convicted.\nThe laws of this Court -- we go back to Reid\nversus Covert, The Schooner Exchange -- makes clear that\nwhen American citizens go abroad voluntarily into other\ncountries, commit crimes in those countries, and remain\nin those countries, they cannot come back to this\ncountry and complain about the offenses they committed,\nnor complain about the modes of trial and punishment\navailable in those countries.\nThe Court made that express in the Neely\nversus Henkel case. And at least on the second\nquestion, we think that that principle establishes that\nthe U.S. force, even assuming it has habeas jurisdiction\nto review their detention by the MNF-I, shouldn't be in\na position of directly thwarting Iraq's sovereign right\nand jurisdiction to try these individuals and, if they\nfind that they committed offenses, punish them for\noffenses committed in Iraq. American citizens --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there a limit to\nyour proposition? In other words, let's stipulate that\nthe individuals are going to be released in a situation\nwhere you know that they won't receive anything\nresembling due process and will be subject to abuse.\nWhat happens in that case?\nMR. GARRE: I think we would maintain that\nAmerican citizens, when they go abroad, they have to\ntake what they get. I think there is some suggestion --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, could they be\nreleased to a lynch mob?\nMR. GARRE: What -- I think what this Court\nsaid in Neely versus Henkel -- and I'm quoting from page\n122, and I think it partially answers your question,\nJustice Kennedy: \"The Suspension Clause has no relation\nto crimes committed without the jurisdiction of the\nUnited States and against the laws of a foreign\ncountry.\"\nIf this Court thinks that it would be\ndifferent if there were no system of fairness or\nprocess, then it could reserve that question for another\ncase.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But habeas corpus is\nconcerned with the safety of the prisoner to the extent\nthat it's controlled by our authorities. And if you're\nin the United States, could an officer release a\nprisoner knowing that a lynch mob was outside? I should\nthink not.\nMR. GARRE: No. And here, Justice Kennedy,\nthe Iraqi courts are functioning under principles that\nrequire fundamental standards and --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course, this is just a\nhypothetical question.\nMR. GARRE: Right.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course.\nMR. GARRE: Right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And do you agree\nthat -- do you concede that habeas is concerned with the\nsafety of the individual as opposed to his custody?\nMR. GARRE: Habeas, as this Court has made\nclear, is concerned with the fact or duration of\ncustody. I think if we're talking about things that\ncould happen to people that would be a different type of\naction. American courts might be open in that extreme\nsituation. I don't think that would be an exercise\nthat's ever been available in habeas.\nI think that the closest analog of this\nCourt's cases to this situation is perhaps Wilson versus\nGirard, where you had an American serviceman stationed\nin Japan who committed alleged offenses in Japan, and\nthe Japanese authorities made a request that they take\njurisdiction of that person to prosecute him for\noffenses in Japan, and this Court considered the\nquestion. There was an injunction against the transfer\nof that individual to Japanese authorities. This Court\nset the injunction aside because it found no affirmative\nbar on the exercise of that discretion, recognizing the\nsovereign right and jurisdiction of the Government of\nJapan to prosecute individuals, including American --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There's an important\ndistinction, I think. At least in this case it has been\nalleged that if these people are released to Iraqi\ncustody, there is a high risk that they will be subject\nto torture and other abuse.\nYou know the brief that was filed on behalf\nof the NGOs where there is a quotation from Iraq's\ndeputy justice minister: \"We cannot control the\nprisons. It's as simple as that. Our jails are\ninfiltrated by the militias from top to bottom, from\nGaza to Baghdad.\"\nMR. GARRE: Let me make a practical and a\nlegal point on that, Justice Ginsburg. First, as a\npractical matter, it is important to keep in mind that\nreports of torture and abuses in the Iraqi system all\ndeal with the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry\nof Defense. We point that out --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: This is a quotation from\nthe deputy justice minister.\nMR. GARRE: And I don't believe he was\npointing to any reports of systematic abuses within the\ndepartment, the Ministry of Justice. And that's what\nour -- our own State Department concluded in its most\nrecent reports on this. And if you look at all the\nreports, including the most recent report that came out\na couple weeks ago from the United Nations Assistance\nMission in Iraq, they point to alleged abuses within the\nMinistry of Interior and Defense. These individuals\nwould be going to the justice system. We don't have\nreports of systematic --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Doesn't that -- doesn't\nthat issue that you raise at least deserve litigation\nbefore the court?\nMR. GARRE: No, and that was the legal point\nthat I was going to make. Even in the extradition\ncontext, where everyone agrees that there would be\nhabeas jurisdiction to review a transfer for some\nreason, the courts have not entertained allegations of\ntorture, recognizing that those considerations are\nuniquely for the executive, except when --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why shouldn't they? I\nmean, if a -- if a court may consider the imminence of\nlynch-mob action either sanctioned by the requesting\ngovernment or tolerated by it, why cannot the same point\nbe made about a claim of torture if there is at least\nenough color in the claim to say there's something to\ninquire into?\nMR. GARRE: I think because for centuries,\nJustice Souter, the courts have recognized that these\nare matters for the executive to assess, because --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then why don't you have --\nwhy isn't your answer different in the lynch-mob case?\nMR. GARRE: Well, I think there we weren't\ntalking about habeas. I think if -- and my answer was\nif the Court is concerned about that situation, this\nisn't it. It can reserve it for a different case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: A lynch mob doesn't require\ninvestigation by American courts of the internal\nworkings of a foreign government.\nMR. GARRE: Well, that's true,\nJustice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, but I think it would be\nquite extraordinary to investigate the Government of\nIraq. That's a matter that the executive can take into\naccount.\nMR. GARRE: That's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But It would be a strange\nthing for an American court to do.\nMR. GARRE: That's what the district court,\nthe court of appeals, and maybe this Court would have to\ndo if it were going to entertain allegations of --\nJUSTICE ALITO: In answer to a previous\nquestion, I understood you to say that if the\nindividuals here were tried by an Iraqi tribunal they\nwould remain in the custody of the Multinational Force\nduring the course of the trial. Is that correct? Does\nthat mean that they would simply be transported to court\nand then brought back to the custody where they are at\nthe present time during the course of those proceedings?\nMR. GARRE: That's right, and General Garner\nexplained that on page 48 of the appendix.\nThe other thing I want to make on torture --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, just to follow up on\nthat, at what point during that, during the trial, would\nthere be any potential for torture by Iraqi authorities.\nMR. GARRE: There would be none,\nJustice Alito. And these individuals are represented by\nIraqi counsel, by American counsel. They have access to\nIraqi ombudsmen. They can make reports. They can make\nreports, as some detainees have, to the Iraqi\ninvestigative judges of alleged mistreatment; not\ntorture, but Iraqi investigative judges have directed\nthat mistreatment not occur.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Sure, but once they're\nturned over to the prison authorities they're in the\nsituation that the NGO brief describes. I mean, that's\nit seems to me ultimately what the concern is.\nMR. GARRE: It's not the situation that the\nNGO brief described, because all of those reports are\nfocused on Ministry of Interior and Defense, where these\nindividuals are not going to -- U.S. court, even in the\nextradition context, don't review these allegations --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I guess that just\ngets me back to my earlier question. Isn't that\nsomething that ought to be explored as an evidentiary\nmatter in determining whether there should be a\npermanent injunction?\nMR. GARRE: I don't think so. Respect for\nthe prerogative of the executive in making its\ndeterminations, respect for the sovereignty of the Iraqi\ncourts. You have a habeas court having discovery and\nwho knows what types of proceedings as to what is going\non in Iraqi's criminal justice system. I think this\nCourt would give respect to the justice systems of other\nsovereign nations. This is a system which, as we say in\nour brief, is founded on principles of fairness.\nIf I could reserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Garre.\nMr. Margulies?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH MARGULIES\nON BEHALF OF MUNAF, ET AL.\nAND OMAR, ET AL.\nMR. MARGULIES: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nTo resolve any confusion about the habeas\nPetitioners' claims, I'd like to focus on two points\nthis morning. The first is we believe the\njurisdictional question is governed by the following\nrule: When a United States citizen is detained abroad\nby United States military officials who have effective\nauthority and control over his continued detention, as\nMr. Garre concedes is the case today, the United States\ndistrict court has jurisdiction over that citizen's\nhabeas petition.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Did General\nMacArthur have effective jurisdiction and control in\nJapan?\nMR. MARGULIES: Frankly, Your Honor, the\nrecord in that regard is unclear. As we point out in\nour, brief, Solicitor General Pearlman argued precisely\nthe opposite. But let us concede for the moment that he\nwould, that Justice Douglas had the better of that\nposition, which the Court in Hirota did not resolve.\nOur position, Your Honor, is that it is\nirrelevant to this question, because the problems that\ndoomed the habeas applications in Hirota had nothing to\ndo with MacArthur's status in the chain of command. The\nproblems with Hirota were these:\nNothing in General MacArthur's status as an\nAmerican officer would have transformed those\npetitioners from enemy aliens to American citizens.\nNothing in General MacArthur's status would have\ntransformed their complaint as something other than an\nattack on the judgment and sentences of an international\ntribunal imposed upon them. That, in fact, is exactly\nwhat the Court said in its nine sentences in Hirota,\nthat it was an attack on the judgment and sentences\nimposed upon them by an international tribunal.\nAnd lastly, vis a vis the narrow question\nbefore the Court in Hirota, nothing in General\nMacArthur's status would have made this anything other\nthan an improper attempt to invoke the original and\nappellate jurisdiction of this Court.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Does your case -- does\nyour case depend entirely on the fact that these are\nAmerican citizens?\nMR. MARGULIES: It is a sufficient ground,\nYour Honor, but it does not --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If they were not American\ncitizens, would there be jurisdiction?\nMR. MARGULIES: We believe there would be\njurisdiction, Your Honor, but no basis to proceed --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So then citizenship is\nirrelevant on the jurisdictional issue?\nMR. MARGULIES: Only vis a vis jurisdiction,\nYour Honor, but I would stress we disagree very\nvigorously with Mister -- with the government that if\njurisdiction were to extend here to foreign nationals, a\nposition on which we take no issue -- that it would\nbe --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I don't know how you can\navoid taking that question. That what bothers me. How\ncan you avoid addressing that question?\nMR. MARGULIES: Frankly, Your Honor, we are\ninclined to agree with Justice Scalia's position in --\nmy interpretation of the habeas statute accords with\nJustice Scalia's view of the interpretation of the\nstatute giving a right to citizens --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Are you aware of any cases\nin which we have held that habeas jurisdiction is\navailable to a citizen where it would be not available\nto a non-citizen?\nMR. MARGULIES: No, Your Honor.\nAnd as I say, what we know from -- certainly\nwith made explicit in Eisentrager, where the Court\ndescribed citizenship as a head of jurisdiction and then\nreaffirmed for people detained abroad, some detained\npursuant to international authority, like Toth v.\nQuarles, Burns v. Wilson, Wilson v. Girard, Ex parte\nHayes, Gualiardo --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this second\nquestion: Do you think the place of detention has any\nrelevance to the issue?\nMR. MARGULIES: No, Your Honor. And one of\nthe worrisome positions --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think whether or\nnot it's a -- there are ongoing hostilities would have\nany relationship to the issue?\nMR. MARGULIES: We think that that question\nis answered in Hamdi, Your Honor. We do not challenge\nthe zone of military discretion that exists at the\nmoment of capture.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But you say that does not\nexist in Iraq today?\nMR. MARGULIES: Oh, no, we do accept that it\nexists in Iraq today, Your Honor. And we are not\nchallenging -- Your Honor, in this case we did not file\nthe habeas petition until Mr. Omar had been in custody\nfor -- in United States custody, for more than a year.\nWe did not file in Munaf until Mr. Munaf had been in\nUnited States custody for more than a year.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But the place of detention\nhas always been Iraq?\nMR. MARGULIES: I'm sorry, Your Honor?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The place of detention has\nalways been Iraq?\nMR. MARGULIES: Yes, Your Honor. The United\nStates has made the decision to retain these people --\nthey have moved them around within Iraq, but they have\nmade the decision to keep them in Iraq.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Would the legal issue be\nthe same if there were violent ongoing hostilities in\nIraq?\nMR. MARGULIES: Your Honor, we accept that\nthere are violent ongoing hostilities in Iraq, but the\nUnited States government takes the position that the\nGeneva Conventions, with which they are complying\nhere -- in this case the conflict is governed by Geneva\nConvention 4 -- obligates the United States to move\nprisoners to a safe location, and they have done that by\ntaking these prisoners to Camp Cropper. I have been to\nCamp Cropper and I agree with the United States that\nthey are complying with the Geneva Conventions in that\nregard.\nAnd upon moving the Petitioners to Camp\nCropper, at that moment the case becomes functionally\nlitigable just as Hamdi would have been. That is, the\ngovernment will assemble its proof to defend the\ndetentions and present it in a district court. The only\ndifference is that Mr. Munaf and Mr. Omar won't appear\npersonally.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I really wanted to get\nyour answer to Justice Stevens's first question\nstraight. You think citizenship is not relevant?\nMR. MARGULIES: Oh, no, Your Honor, I think\nit's extraordinarily relevant, and I think that we\nare entitled --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I thought you were not\nbasing your case on the citizenship?\nMR. MARGULIES: No, Your Honor. I apologize\nif I misspoke. We are basing it on citizenship --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I might have --\nMR. MARGULIES: -- but it is only one of the\ngrounds upon which we would distinguish this case from\nHirota.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Let me ask you about\nthat, because if your basic point is that here is an\nofficer of the United States that has someone in\ncustody --\nMR. MARGULIES: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- someone who is in\njeopardy, among other things, of being tortured --\nMR. MARGULIES: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that United States\nofficial has to safeguard a citizen?\nMR. MARGULIES: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But can throw a\nnon-citizen into the lion's den? Is that the\ninstruction that the United States gives to its\nofficers, take care of our citizens, but the rest of the\nworld, we don't care?\nMR. MARGULIES: Frankly, Your Honor, I do\nnot believe the United States makes that instruction to\nits uniformed officers.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you're making this\ndistinction now. Justice Kennedy asked you does -- does\nyour case turn on citizenship, and you said citizenship\nis very important.\nMR. MARGULIES: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There are thousands of\nnoncitizens that are being held in the very same\ncircumstance.\nMR. MARGULIES: Your Honor, there are\nimportant reasons embedded in the laws of war that\nauthorize the United States in this context to transfer\nforeign nationals back -- in this case the overwhelming\nnumber of which are Iraqis -- back to the custody of the\nIraqi government, that the laws of war do not allow\nfor -- with U.S. citizens. That is a distinction.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Margulies, the prologue\nto the Constitution does say \"to preserve the blessings\nof liberty to ourselves and our posterity.\" There is\nsomething to the notion, isn't there, that the\nConstitution provides constitutional rights, including\nthe right to the writ of habeas corpus, to Americans or\nto anyone who is in America; but to say that the whole\nworld has rights under the Constitution is extravagant.\nMR. MARGULIES: I take no position on\nwhether it's extravagant, Your Honor, but I certainly\ntake the position that that's not what we argue. And\nthere are grounds -- there are grounds predicated on the\nlaws of war, on the terms of the extradition treaty, on\nthe possible application of the Fifth Amendment, that\nsimply make differentiation between citizens and\nnon-citizens.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So a habeas court\nhere has to look at all those different factors and come\nto a determination of whether it has jurisdiction?\nThere's no bright line? It has to look at whether\nhostilities have ceased or haven't ceased? It's got to\nlook at how far the prisoners have been removed from the\nzone of hostility?\nMR. GARRE: No. No, emphatically not, Your\nHonor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So what is the\nbright line that determines whether there's habeas\njurisdiction or not?\nMR. MARGULIES: Control. That is what\nhabeas turns on, Your Honor. And the bright-line test\nthat we propose, which is the one that has been followed\nby this Court --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the control in\nthe middle of a zone of hostilities of a foreign\nnational allows -- creates habeas jurisdiction? That's\nyour bright line?\nMR. MARGULIES: No, I'm sorry, Your Honor.\nWhat I mean to suggest, the rule that I propose -- the\nrule that I propose is that when a U.S. citizen is\ndetained abroad by U.S. military officials who have\neffective authority and control over his continued\ndetention, that citizen can invoke the jurisdiction of\nthe United States district court.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then it's not\njust control. It looks to citizenship, which brings up\nthe questions Justice Stevens was raising.\nMR. MARGULIES: Yes, Your Honor, and I\napologize. What I said at the outset is that this is a\ntest which turns on the jurisdictional facts that I have\nidentified, which is when a citizen is detained by the\nU.S. military abroad and the military has effective\ncontrol.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do we have any -- any\nprecedent in our cases for saying that that test would\napply during an active combat in a zone of hostilities?\nMR. MARGULIES: Toth v. Quarles, of course,\nYour Honor, involved a person who was brought from the\nUnited States to Korea when there was still hostilities\nongoing.\nBut Your Honor, again I would suggest that\nwhat the Court will have to inquire into has been\naddressed already by Hamdi, because we will not look at\nthe period of time --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It's a very different\nplace of detention.\nMR. MARGULIES: Oh, absolutely, Your Honor.\nBut we are not focusing on the moment of capture. The\nUnited States already has --\nJUSTICE ALITO: I still don't -- I don't\nunderstand what you're saying about citizenship. You\nsaid earlier it wasn't necessary, and it make as big\ndifference. There are thousands of non-U.S. citizens\nbeing held Iraq. Your argument with respect to your\nclients is that they have -- they can file habeas\npetitions in the District of Columbia and they can't be\nturned over except pursuant to the extradition treaty\nbetween the United States and Iraq; is that correct?\nMR. MARGULIES: Not quite, Your Honor. Our\nposition is -- and I want to come back --\nJUSTICE ALITO: If I could just then finish\nthe question. Pursuant to the extradition treaty or\nsome other authorization; if citizenship isn't\nimportant, then why can't all of those thousands of\nnon-citizens -- or can all of those thousands of\nnon-citizens -- who are being held in Iraq file habeas\npetitions in the District of Columbia and argue that\nthey can't be turned over except pursuant to the\nextradition treaty or some other authorization?\nMR. MARGULIES: For several reasons, Your\nHonor. First of all, as the Court knows, the habeas\nstatute itself has been amended in a way that excludes\naccess for foreign nationals outside the country. The\nCourt -- or rather Congress, very carefully did not\nexclude it for U.S. citizens. Second, there may be\nlimitations on whether foreign nationals can invoke the\nprotections of the Fifth Amendment.\nThird, as I pointed out, the extradition\ntreaty bars the transfer of citizens, but does not bar\nthe transfer of non-citizens. And fourth, the laws of\nwar allow the United States to transfer Iraqis, but\ncontemplate the continued application of extradition\nprinciples that were in place prior to the start of the\nconflict.\nSo there are four brakes, if you will, on\nthe slippery slope. There is no floodgates problem in\nthis case. So far as we are aware --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But you have only the --\nthe citizenship to stop the floodgate. What I'm\nwondering is -- when I read the briefs, I put in my mind\na spectrum and on one side is the military occupation of\nJapan, where there is basically peace but it's a\nmilitary occupation. On the other side, it's a hot war\nor a guerilla war where the U.S. forces are rounding up\ntroops, nightly perhaps, and rounding up guerillas. And\nI had put this case quite close to the military\noccupation in my mind because of the nature of these\nparticular individuals' offense and treatment. But was\nI wrong to do that? Should I assimilate this case to\neither a hot war or at least a guerilla warfare, where\ntroops are actively engaged in rounding up those who\nwant to shoot them?\nMR. MARGULIES: You should definitely not\nassimilate this case to the latter category, Your Honor.\nThat is not what this case is about. And let me turn\nthen --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: In answering that question,\nwould you go back, please, and clarify something that\nI'm not too clear on in your answers to comparable\nquestions from Justice Kennedy and Justice Stevens? And\nthat is, you say we do not claim that there would be\njurisdiction within the zone of hostilities. Is it your\npoint -- and you then go on to say, well, they've been\nmoved to this camp. Is your point the simple point that\nthe camp gets them out of the zone of hostilities? And\nis that the reason that you answered Justice Breyer's\nquestion by saying this is comparable to an occupation\nrather than a war zone? Is that the simple point?\nMR. MARGULIES: No, Your Honor. What I am\n-- what I am seizing upon is the conclusion in Hamdi\nthat there is a zone of military discretion within which\nthe judiciary ought not intrude. And that has both\nspatial and temporal qualities.\nThis is a person who has been moved from\nthat place, and the detention has been made, a decision\nhas been made to continue detention long after --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So you're saying within\nwhat is technically a zone of hostility, there are\nplaces, physical places, I take it, within which the\nmilitary has a degree of discretion; and that discretion\nis what makes this situation comparable to an\noccupation?\nI mean, I'm just not following how you're\ngetting from A to B. That's -- that's my problem.\nMR. MARGULIES: Your Honor, what we are\nsuggesting is that we recognize that there are\nhostilities going on inside Iraq. But the United States\nhas made a decision to move the person, as required by\nthe Geneva Conventions, to a safe location.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So are you saying then\nthat the zone of hostilities does not include all of\nIraq?\nMR. MARGULIES: Absolutely. That is --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So what if we thought\notherwise?\nMR. MARGULIES: I'm sorry, Your Honor?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What if we thought\notherwise? What if we thought all -- all of Iraq is a\nzone of hostilities? Would we have a different result?\nMR. MARGULIES: We would not, Your Honor.\nWe would not have a different result either\njurisdictionally or on the merits. If the United States\nGovernment has custody and control of a United States\ncitizen, there is habeas jurisdiction.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then you've got to say that\nthere is habeas jurisdiction within the zone of\nhostility. I thought you said the opposite.\nMR. MARGULIES: No, Your Honor. I do say --\nour position is that the habeas statute would give\njurisdiction, but there may be a period in which it\nwould be inappropriate, unwise, just as in Hamdi, for\nthe Court to intrude. And that may be --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: An abstention kind of\ndoctrine then is what you are getting at?\nMR. MARGULIES: Yes. It is abstention upon\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that's pretty far\nremoved from the bright line. I mean, now you've got to\ndecide whether it's in the zone of hostilities or not.\nYou've got to decide if this is within the time period\nthat the Court should not exercise jurisdiction or not.\nAnd what's going to happen, of course, is that the\ndistrict court is going to look at this and say, I can't\ndecide all of that right away. Let's enter an\ninjunction, a preliminary injunction such as at issue\nhere, while I decide these questions. And that's going\nto have the effect of intruding quite extensively on the\nexercise of executive authority.\nMR. MARGULIES: I -- we think not, Your\nHonor.\nFirst of all, it does not alter in the\nslightest the jurisdictional rule. The jurisdictional\nrule given to us by the habeas statute is still a\nbright-line rule. There may be some cases where the\npetitioner is asking to -- the Court to inquire into the\nlawfulness of -- the two inquiries in this case, the --\nboth of them governed by the Due Process Clause -- the\nlawfulness of the detention for security threats, and\nthe lawfulness of the proposed transfer. Those are two\ndifferent inquiries. Those are the two inquiries.\nThere may be some instance where that\nrequest is made fairly shortly after the decision was\nmade to continue to detain.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Margulies, could I ask\na few questions about the Multinational Force involved\nhere? Do you acknowledge that in theory, at least, the\nUnited States in its capacity here is subject to the\ncontrol of the United Nations?\nMR. MARGULIES: No.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You do not?\nMR. MARGULIES: We do not. It is\nemphatically not the case. The resolutions which bring\nthe Multinational Force into existence say that it will\noperate under the unified command of the United States\nmilitary, which is precisely the position that the\ngovernment pressed in its brief, on page 2 of its brief.\nGeneral Casey when he testified said that the MNF is a\nsubordinate command to the United States military.\nThere is nothing in the record which suggests that the\nMNF could, if it wanted to, give an order that the\nUnited States could not countermand. There is nothing\nthat gives this anything other than -- and we do not --\nwe do not denigrate or diminish the significance of any\nother country's participation. But the buck stops with\nthe United States Government when it comes to these\ndetentions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Let me try and move\nyou to the merits.\nMR. MARGULIES: Please.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I had thought that\nthe historic purpose of the Great Writ was to challenge\ncustody. And it seems to me that the last thing your\nclients want in this case is to be released.\nMR. MARGULIES: That is incorrect, Your\nHonor, and let me make it clear. There is some question\nthat emerged in the earlier argument on the potential\nequivalence between release and transfer. So let me\naddress that directly.\nWith respect to transfer -- again that's a\nseparate question from detention simpliciter -- with\nrespect to transfer, there are two questions: The\ntransfer will either be lawful or it will not; Iraq will\neither want him or it will not.\nThat obviously produces four different\npossible outcomes, a matrix with four boxes. It is too\nearly to ascertain which of those boxes we will be in,\nbut let me give an illustration.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, but in the cases --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't want the\ndistrict court to say you win, you can be released\ntomorrow at noon.\nMR. MARGULIES: Yes, we do. In fact, Your\nHonor --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I thought you\nwanted to block the transfer. I mean, the Iraqi\nauthorities can pick him up at the gate.\nMR. MARGULIES: Your Honor, let's say we\nhad -- my understanding of the evidence in Munaf leads\nme to believe that on remand this is where we -- this is\nwhere the state of play will go: The transfer will be\nunlawful, and the Iraqi government will not want him.\nTransfer unlawful. Iraqi government won't\nwant him. He can be released to his home --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But he -- he is still\nwithin the Iraqi criminal justice system. He wasn't --\nhis case wasn't dismissed. It was sent back for further\ninvestigation.\nMR. MARGULIES: Correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So what's happening in\nhis case is he's undergoing a criminal process in Iraq;\nand we are holding him during that process. So if\nyou're not objecting to our holding him while the\nprocess is going on, what is -- what is he seeking\nthrough habeas?\nHe -- he can't get out from under the Iraqi\ncriminal justice system. He is alleged to have\ncommitted crimes within Iraq. We are holding him safe\nwhile that process is going on. So what is the basis of\nhis petition?\nMR. MARGULIES: Your Honor, his petition,\nlike Mr. Omar's petition, seeks his release. The only\ncomplexity arises in one of the possible boxes; that is,\nthe Court concludes that the transfer is unlawful, but\nthere is no -- but the Iraqi government wants him. The\ntransfer is unlawful, but the Iraqi government wants\nhim.\nIn that situation, in order to give effect\nto the legal conclusion that the transfer is unlawful --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't get up to\ntransfer. This man is now under investigation in the\nIraqi system.\nMR. MARGULIES: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Now, we -- transfer isn't\nan issue.\nWhat do you want done with him while he's\nsubject to the criminal process in Iraq?\nMR. MARGULIES: Your Honor, you are correct\nthat we do not object to the idea that, while the\ndistrict court is determining whether it is lawful to\ndetain a U.S. citizen in this circumstances or transfer\na U.S. citizen in those circumstances -- those two\ninquiries -- it is okay to detain Mr. Munaf for the\nbenefit of the Iraqi government.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought the relief\nthat was awarded by the district court also enjoined\nprosecution.\nMR. MARGULIES: It does not, Your Honor, and\nto the extent that the D.C. Circuit in Omar interprets\nthat, we do not -- we disavow that. There -- as the\ncourt pointed out, the -- first of all, they can try a\nprisoner in absentia. All we object to is that -- a\nphysical transfer of Mr. Omar or Mr. Munaf, while the\nlawfulness of that transfer is being determined. And\nthat is all we sought.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The question is, look,\nsuppose the government comes in tomorrow, or in the\ndistrict court, you're back there. And the government\nsays you want us to release him. At noon tomorrow, we\nwill take him to the front gate and release him. Do you\nwant us to do it? Yes or no?\nMR. MARGULIES: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes?\nMR. MARGULIES: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You want -- I'm\nsorry. I just want to make sure I understand. You want\nthe relief in both of these cases to be, okay, we will\nrelease him tomorrow at noon? And by the way, we're\ngoing to notify the Iraqi authorities because we think\nwe're releasing a dangerous criminal and want to make\nsure they have the opportunity to do whatever they want?\nMR. MARGULIES: There is -- there is no\nquestion that we do not challenge any right of\nsovereignance in Iraq to share information. The only\ncircumstance in which it potentially arises is one in\nwhich release has the effect of being transfer and there\nis a prior determination by a United States district\ncourt that the transfer would be unlawful. So that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, why didn't you\nanswer Justice Breyer -- and we've interrupted you a\ncouple of times. You have the box. He's going to be\nreleased. They want him. I don't see then why you\ndidn't answer Justice Breyer's question differently.\nMR. MARGULIES: Because what I understood\nthe hypothetical to mean is that there had not been a\nprior determination that the transfer would be unlawful.\nIn other words, if they just released him tomorrow --\nthey said, we have lost interest in him; we're releasing\nhim tomorrow -- there is no prior determination that the\ntransfer is unlawful.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what we're doing --\nMR. MARGULIES: So you're not --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What we're doing is we're\ntesting the authority and the propriety of the district\njudge to proceed.\nMR. MARGULIES: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And that's why we are\nasking if, at the end of the day, the order is a\nrelease, is there a problem? And I should think you'd\nyes.\nMR. MARGULIES: No. Your Honor, if the\nconclusion is that the transfer would be unlawful, then\nyou cannot release him in a way that effects the\ntransfer.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Who says? I mean, a\ntransfer is one thing and saying you're free to go and\nthe Iraqi government picks him up is something else.\nWhy -- why do you equate the two?\nMR. MARGULIES: Because, Your Honor, we\nthink that the district court can order, under 28 U.S.C.\n2243, as law and justice requires, a release -- or\nrather, relief that gives effect to the contours of the\nright.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But -- of course it can.\nMR. MARGULIES: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It can, but --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me that you're\nbegging -- you're begging a question -- you're inserting\na premise that we have to decide, whether the release is\nunlawful. We're asking, that's part of the equation.\nI'm the district judge. Can I say, I've looked at all\nthis, I want this prisoner released tomorrow morning;\nand if the Iraqis pick him up, fine with me? Can I say\nthat?\nMR. MARGULIES: Yes, you can.\nBut if there is a determination that the\ntransfer would be unlawful, then you need to release the\nperson in a manner -- for instance, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All right. Let's get to\nthat. What manner? Tell me exactly what should such an\norder would look like.\nMR. MARGULIES: It -- we would ask the\ndistrict court to order precisely what the military\nalready does, which is to remove a person to a safe\nplace. When United States citizens are released from\nCamp Cropper, they are brought from --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So Releasing at place A,\nnot place B.\nMR. MARGULIES: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Don't push him out the\ngates; take him somewhere else, and then release him.\nThat's the order?\nMR. MARGULIES: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And don't tell --\nMR. MARGULIES: That's the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And don't tell the\nIraqis where that's going to be?\nMR. MARGULIES: They don't do that now, Your\nHonor. When -- when United States citizens are released\nfrom Iraq, what they do is they put them in a car out of\nCamp Cropper, the same thing when I left Camp Cropper.\nThey put them in a car from Camp Cropper. They drive\nthem to the American --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's within\nthe executive's discretion. I want to know if you are\nsaying that the district court in this case can require\nthe custodian not simply to release the person, but to\nrelease them somewhere else and to keep the point at\nwhich they're going to release someone whose been\ndetermined by the MNF-I tribunal to be a dangerous\ncriminal, to keep the point of his release secret from\nthe Iraqi government.\nMR. MARGULIES: If the determination has\nalready been made that the transfer would be unlawful,\nyes, we think that in law and equity they can do that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. Now the\ndetermination that the transfer would be unlawful, I --\nagain, I get back -- maybe I'm repeating myself. I have\nalways understood habeas to be concerned with custody,\nrather than this broad range of determinations about\nwhat's lawful and unlawful, other than as are necessary\nto rule on the question of custody.\nIn other words, of course, if there's been a\nFourth Amendment violation, you bring a habeas action,\nyou determine whether the custody is lawful or not.\nHere you want a determination whether the transfer is\nunlawful or not.\nMR. MARGULIES: Yes. Because the United\nStates Government simply lacks the power under the Due\nProcess Clause to surrender a citizen to the custody of\nanother sovereign. That -- it just lacks that power.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Whether it does or\ndoes not, I just question whether habeas is an\nappropriate remedy in that situation, again because it's\nnot concerned with the legality of transfer; it's\nconcerned with the legality of custody.\nMR. MARGULIES: Habeas has long been used to\ntest the lawfulness, under the Fifth Amendment, of a\nproposed transfer.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: How can you say that the\nUnited States lacks the power to transfer? Suppose this\nfellow had been arrested in the street by a sergeant in\nthe Army and he says, what will I do with him? I'll\ntake him to the Iraqis and turn him over. Would that be\nan illegal transfer?\nMR. MARGULIES: It -- once the United States\nhas the authority to --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: A sergeant caught this\nguy, and he wants to turn him over to the Iraqis. Does\nhe -- is there some law that prevents him from doing\nthat?\nMR. MARGULIES: It may be the Constitution\nand the habeas statute could combine to prevent that.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That applies to the\nsergeant in the city of --\nMR. MARGULIES: As I said before, Your\nHonor -- as I tried to say, and I apologize if I'm not\nbeing clear -- there is a zone of military discretion\nwhere it may not be appropriate --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Why isn't all of this\nwithin the zone of military discretion?\nMR. MARGULIES: Because we filed this\napplication more than a year after the United States\nmade a decision to continue the detention. Think about\nit this way, Your Honor: If Hamdi -- exact same facts\n-- had simply been kept in Afghanistan, instead of\nbrought to Charleston, South Carolina, we think there\nstill would have habeas jurisdiction. The court would\nhave undertaken the exact same inquiry.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if you had filed\nit -- if you had filed it six months rather than a year\nafter, would there be habeas jurisdiction.\nMR. MARGULIES: We think in six months, yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You see where I'm\ngoing. Three months?\nMR. MARGULIES: There may be some cases that\nbecome difficult, Your Honor. In this case, for\ninstance --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The bright line is\ngetting awfully fuzzy, as far as I'm concerned.\nMR. MARGULIES: Your Honor, in this case --\nin both cases, after two months they made the\ndetermination to continue to hold them in the MNF-I\ntribunals. So at the very least, at that point we're\ncovered.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But it seems to me your\nstatement is wildly overbroad: That there is a\ndue-process restriction on release by the United States\nGovernment to another sovereign?\nMR. MARGULIES: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If we have an undercover\nagent in Japan who finds a drug dealer, he gives him to\nthe Japanese police.\nMR. MARGULIES: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't understand that.\nThat's a sweeping statement. That just can't be right.\nMR. MARGULIES: Your Honor, with all due\nrespect, it has been the law for over a century in this\ncountry. It ordinarily arises in the classic\nextradition context. But even when a person is already\noverseas and the United States wants to transfer them to\nthe custody of another sovereign --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You're talking about a\ntransfer in what I assume you said was a zone of\nhostilities.\nMR. MARGULIES: I'm sorry, Your Honor?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I thought you were talking\nabout a transfer in an area that you say was engaged in\nactive hostilities.\nMR. MARGULIES: Your Honor, we --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Does that affect the\ndecision at all?\nMR. MARGULIES: It does not affect a\ncitizen's due-process entitlement. In the metes and\nbounds, the way we would analyze it under Matthews\nversus Aldridge, it may affect what inquiry the\ngovernment has to make in order to justify it. But it\ndoes not affect the citizen's right, the citizen's\nconstitutional entitlement, to challenge the lawfulness\nof a transfer at the hands of his government to another\nsovereign.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But you've just said that\nit's unlawful. You said that an American law\nenforcement officer working in another country who takes\ncustody of a wanted criminal cannot turn him over to the\ngovernment of that country. That's just got to be\nwrong.\nMR. MARGULIES: Your Honor, just to finish\nthe answer, the transfer may take place, but it may only\ntake place as authorized by law. That is, they have to\nshow a legal and factual basis. The legal basis is they\nhave to show a treaty or a statutory authority; and the\nfactual basis is they have to show that the person comes\nwithin it.\nSo, of course, they can pass a person.\nThose -- those transfers take place all the time, but it\nmust take place consistent with the requirements of the\nlaw.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Margulies, let\nme make sure there are no other questions.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You need all that to win\nthis case. That is, as I started the case I thought\nthis involved an American being held by the military for\nover a year pending the resolution of criminal charges\nin Iraq, which are charges of kidnapping in respect to\nwhich whatever hot war is going on over there has very\nlittle to do with his being held.\nMR. MARGULIES: Correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, you've been arguing\nfor all sorts of things that seem far broader than that.\nSo I'd like to focus you for a second on that matter.\nMR. MARGULIES: Your Honor, we -- all of\nthese other matters we do not need in order to prevail.\nThe district court, examining two claims under the\ndue-process clause, will examine whether there is legal\nauthority to detain a person, to detain these prisoners\nas security internees or security threats. That is a\nclassic Hamdi inquiry. And they will examine under the\ndue-process clause whether it is lawful to transfer\nthem.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why do you say it has\nnothing to do with the war, then? They are holding them\nas security detainees. Aren't they -- aren't they\nworried that if they just let them go, they'll go right\nback to killing Americans and Iraqis?\nMR. MARGULIES: Your Honor, this is what\ncame up in Hamdi. In Hamdi, you had a conflict, boots\non the ground. They captured a United States citizen in\na battlefield situation. And this Court made a\ndecision, made a determination, that that person can\nchallenge the lawfulness of his -- of his detention.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not arguing that. I'm\njust questioning your statement that it's irrelevant\nthat this is occurring in a war zone. It is not at all\nirrelevant.\nOne of the -- the reason they're being\ndetained is precisely because this is a war zone.\nMR. MARGULIES: Your Honor, we think that\npoint is answered by the suggestion in Hamdi that you\ndon't want to create a perverse incentive to keep people\nthere. They have made a decision to keep them there.\nThe inquiry that the district court will undertake is\nthe same in Hamdi as in this case. There is nothing\nthat -- there is nothing about that inquiry that is\naltered by the United States' determination to move them\nto a safe --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: One distinct difference\nin Munaf's case: He is undergoing a criminal process in\nIraq, and Omar has also -- it is alleged that he has\ncommitted offenses in Iraq.\nHas no prosecution, no investigation been\nstarted with respect to Omar?\nMR. MARGULIES: That is correct, Your Honor.\nWhat the district court did in its preliminary\ninjunction, the Rosetta Stone of the preliminary\ninjunction appears on page 143 of the joint appendix.\nAnd there you have an e-mail from the United\nStates Government, from opposing counsel to us,\nindicating to us on February 2, 2006, that a decision\nhad been made to refer Mr. Omar to proceedings in the\nCCCI, but telling us in the second-to-the-last sentence\nof that page that we would not receive notice of when\nthat referral took place.\nAnd it pointedly -- they did not say that\nMr. Omar would remain in U.S. custody once the referral\ntook place.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Margulies.\nMR. MARGULIES: Thank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Garre, seven\nminutes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Garre, would you\naddress this question at some point? Assuming -- assume\nan officer in the national government arrests somebody\nunlawfully in Portland, Oregon, and transfers the person\nacross the country to Portland, Maine. The person files\nfor habeas in the district court in Maine, and the\ndistrict court says: Yes, you are right. You are being\nheld unlawfully.\nDoes the court have the authority to tell\nthe United States to take him back to Portland, Oregon,\nand then release him?\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY GARRE\nON BEHALF OF PETE GEREN,\nSECRETARY OF THE ARMY, ET AL.\nMR. GARRE: I think this court confronted a\nsimilar situation in the Padilla case a couple of years\nago. And what it -- it -- there was a habeas petition\nfiled in New York, and it -- the court held that that\nhabeas petition was improperly filed and a different\npetition should be filed in South Carolina.\nAnd it didn't get into the question of the\ntransfer. And we certainly -- we don't think that\ntransfer --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Do you have a position on\nthe answer to my question?\nMR. GARRE: Whether the habeas court could\ndirect that he be brought back to Portland?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nMR. GARRE: I think the habeas court would\n--\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The habeas court says,\nlook, it is not complete relief just to put him out on\nthe street in Portland -- in Maine. He's broke, and\nhe's 3,000 miles from home. Take him back to Portland,\nOregon.\nDoes the habeas court have the authority to\ndo that?\nMR. GARRE: I would say probably not,\nJustice Souter. I mean there are transfers all the time\nwhere habeas petitions are filed, and people are going\nfrom State authority to Federal authority. And the rule\nis that those transfers, of course, can take place. The\nhabeas proceedings can continue. The habeas has\ntraditionally been used to block transfers.\nHere -- and I think it is important to focus\non the injunction that the court of appeals sustained.\nIt is an injunction against allowing the Iraqi\nprosecutions to proceed because the court enjoined\nAmerican officials from presenting Mr. Omar to the Iraqi\ncourts. Now, Mr. Margulies said that they didn't enjoin\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I didn't see that in the\njunction, itself. It just -- the injunction was very\nspare.\nMR. GARRE: What the injunction says -- and\nit is on page 59a -- is that it bars -- of the petition\nappendix in the Omar petition, the gray petition, and I\nam quoting now: \"Shall not remove the Petitioner from\nthe United States or MNF-I custody, or take any other\naction inconsistent with this court's memorandum\nopinion.\"\n\"Any other action inconsistent with this\ncourt's memorandum opinion\" is allowing the prosecution\nto proceed, and the Court of Appeals makes this express\non page 25a of the petition appendix where the Court of\nAppeals majority says, quote, \"we agree with the dissent\nthat the injunction prohibits the military from\npresenting Omar to the CCCI for trial.\"\nNow, Mr. Margulies said that the proceedings\ncan go forward just without his client's presence,\nbut that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If one could go agree --\nlet's say one could agree that was overbroad. Does that\nmean that the whole injunction falls? Let's say, take\ntwo pieces out of it: No information sharing; that's\nbeyond the pale. And you can't make an order that a\nforeign court shouldn't hear a case. Take those two\nout.\nMR. GARRE: That would be a vast improvement\nover the injunction that was held by the court of\nappeals.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But how about the rest of\nit?\nMR. GARRE: And then you are dealt -- you\nare left with the transfer, the injunction on the\ntransfer to the Iraqi authorities in the event that\nMr. Omar is convicted.\nAnd on that, I confess to being not -- not\nbeing entirely clear as to what my friend's position is.\nHe says that we can release him because, of course, that\nis the office of the Writ of Habeas Corpus.\nBut then he goes on to say: But we can't\nrelease him in a way that would affect a transfer. I'm\nnot sure what that means because I thought he also\nsaid that we --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I think it means the\nsame thing that the point of my question was.\nHe is saying you can't release him at point\nA, which would be tantamount to transfer; you've got to\ntake him to point B, somewhere where his release will\nnot result in the automatic arrest. And that's why I\nasked my question.\nMR. GARRE: Just to underscore the affront\nto the Iraqi sovereignty on this, his clients\nacknowledge that they can be arrested by Iraqi officials\nfor crimes they allegedly committed in Iraq if they were\nreleased. But the injunction that they're asking this\nCourt to sustain is an injunction that prevents the\nMulti-National Force in Iraq from telling Iraqi\nauthorities: We are going to release these Petitioners\nat 12:00 o'clock tomorrow. In effect, they're asking\nfor an eight-hour head start so that these individuals\nwhom the Multi-National Force has determined pose\nthreats to the security of Iraq, who Iraq has determined\npose threats to the security of Iraq, that an American\ncourt is enjoining the Multi-National Force from\nconveying that information to the Iraqi authorities so\nthat these individuals who went to Iraq voluntarily can\nbe held to account in he Iraqi system for crimes that\nthey committed.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think an eight-hour\nlead is enough? I don't know.\nMR. GARRE: Well, I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It would make a good movie.\nMR. GARRE: Yes.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So we have a basic\nquestion: Is there habeas jurisdiction; and, as I\nunderstand the posture of this case, the Federal courts\ndid not examine the merits of the habeas petition. They\nwere just hung up on the bare jurisdictional question.\nMR. GARRE: That's true. But we think that\nit is quite clear from this Court's decisions that if\nthey don't have the authority to enter the preliminary\ninjunctive relief that they did at the end of the day\nthey have no authority to enter it as a preliminary\nmatter.\nI think on the jurisdictional point, the one\npoint I wanted to stress is that if this Court does find\njurisdiction we think it has to be because of a reading\nof the habeas statute informed by the Constitution\nthat's limited to citizens. Extending jurisdiction to\neveryone in Iraq would be an extraordinary expansion of\nthis Court's decision in Rasul. Just to be clear, Camp\nCropper in Iraq bears none of the characteristics of the\nGuantanamo Bay that this Court discussed in its opinion\nin Rasul and that Justice Kennedy emphasized in his\nconcurrence. So any jurisdictional ruling by this\nCourt, we would urge it to rule only to the\ncircumstances here of the fact of citizenship.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The the 20,000-plus\npeople being retained, are they all in connection with\nsecurity threats? Or do they involve what I guess we\ncould call common criminals?\nMR. GARRE: I think there are both. This\nhave been 2,000 transfers of individuals from\nMultinational Force to Iraqi custody, most in connection\nwith criminal proceedings. The other individuals are\nheld because they're a security threat. A lot of\nindividuals come in and out of detention.\nObviously the Multinational Force tries to\nlimit the detentions as much as possible. Here the\nreason why these people have been subsidy contained so\nlong is because the American courts have stood in the\nway of the Iraqi criminal proceedings where the Iraqi\ncourts have sought to bring justice to these people\nunder Iraqi law.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Garre, is it the\nposition of the government that this is a war zone?\nMR. GARRE: It's -- we don't take the\nposition this is like a battlefield situation. The\noccupation --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think any part of\nIraq is like a battlefield situation?\nMR. GARRE: Certainly there are active\nhostilities in parts of Iraq.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Why isn't it a war zone?\nMR. GARRE: Well, the occupation has ended.\nI think there are active hostilities in part of it. We\nhave not argued that there is no habeas jurisdiction\nbecause of the hostilities there. We've argued that\nthere is no habeas jurisdiction because they're being\nheld under --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That means you haven't\nmade your strongest argument.\nMR. GARRE: Well, if the Court believes that\nthat's our strongest argument, certainly we don't have\nany objection to having you address it.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: But am I right to assume\nthe underlying situation to be that of Hirota?\nMR. GARRE: That's jurisdictional.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but you see what I\nmean by that? I mean, these issues of the war zone and\nso forth are not really there in this case; that we're\ntalking here about a person whose being held in a manner\nthat's comparable for habeas purposes to the Japanese or\naliens who were held in Hirota. They're being held by\nthe Army, which is in part, which is in relevant part\nserving as an occupying force, to be turned over to a\ndifferent tribunal.\nMR. GARRE: That's correct, Justice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay, thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Garre.\n"
