PETRO\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. PETRO: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nThe purpose of any hearing process is to get a\nbetter answer. If the question is what happened in the\npast, an adversarial fact-finding can help provide the\nanswers. If, however, the question seeks to look forward\nand predict future behavior, then a slightly more limited\nprocedure will serve to expedite and arrive at the best\npossible answer to this predictive question.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: General Petro, before you get\ninto the details of why -- why you think the process here\nwas all that was due, I'm -- I'm more concerned about the\npreliminary question of whether there was a liberty\ninterest here. I -- I know you haven't challenged the\nexistence of it, but I'm not sure that lets me off the\nhook.\nWe -- we had a case some years ago in which both\nsides apparently wanted the statute in existence and they\nconceded in the -- in the court of appeals that the\nstatute existed and wanted us to say what this\npresumptively existing statute said. And we held, since\nthere was serious doubt about whether the statute had been\nproperly enacted, we had to reach that question first\nbecause we were not going to speculate on what a, you\nknow, hypothetical statute said.\nAnd I think you're asking us to do sort of the\nsame thing here. You're -- if -- you know, without even\nconceding or -- the Government doesn't concede anyway.\nThe United States doesn't.\nMR. PETRO: No they don't.\nJUSTICE SCAIA: You're asking us to hold that\nif this is covered by the Due Process Clause, what you've\ngiven here is enough. But I don't -- I don't like to\nspeculate on -- on hypothetical questions like that.\nAnd it -- it really seems to me that to say that\nthere's a liberty interest here flies in the face of our\nmore reasoned opinions in this area, especially Sandin\nwhich -- which has some language that's -- that's almost\n-- almost right on point. We note also that this -- where\nis it? Conner's confinement did not exceed similar but\ntotally discretionary confinement in either duration or\ndegree of restriction.\nI -- I don't understand how this person has a\nliberty interest in not -- in not being put in a maximum\nsecurity facility. Presumably you could put all your\nprisoners in maximum security. I mean, you don't pull\ntheir fingernails or anything, do you?\nMR. PETRO: No -- no, we don't, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So there's -- there's no Eighth\nAmendment problem.\nMR. PETRO: No.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So if you wanted to, you could\nput all of your prisoners in maximum security. Right?\nMR. PETRO: Yes, I agree, Your Honor, that we\ncould.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So where is the liberty\ninterest here? I don't understand.\nMR. PETRO: We -- we made a decision in\npetitioning the Court that the liberty interest issue was\nsomething that we would not raise. We raised it on appeal\nthrough the district court and through the circuit court.\nWe chose not to raise it here to focus on the due process\nissue.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I understand, but I feel\nlike something of a fool being asked, you know, Justice\nScalia, if -- if there were a liberty interest here, would\nthese procedures be enough to secure it. That's not the\nkind of work I usually do. I -- you know, I usually ask\n-- answer real questions.\nMR. PETRO: The -- the circuit court made a\nfactual determination that there was a significant and\natypical deprivation. We would respectfully disagree with\nthat determination, but because it was a factual\ndetermination, we chose to confine our appeal to the issue\nof law.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, but there is a -- there\nis a question of law involved as to whether there's a\nliberty interest.\nMR. PETRO: Yes.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: In the Sandin case in 1995,\nthis Court said that prisoners have a State-created\nliberty interest only where the deprivation or restraint\nimposes atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in\nrelation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.\nNow, I guess to be categorized in category 5 in\nyour State, it does involve putting someone in solitary\nconfinement, reducing their time for exercise, and\nreducing their options for parole. Is that correct?\nMR. PETRO: That is correct. But when people\nare moved to level 5, Your Honor, typically they're being\nmoved from level 4, at least more than 90 percent of the\ntime, and level 4 has a similar area of restriction. In\nreality, I would argue -- and I would concur with Justice\nScalia -- that this is not a significant or atypical\ndeprivation --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, do you take the -- why\ndon't you simplify it by telling us whether you take the\nposition today that there is or is not a liberty interest\nhere?\nMR. PETRO: Your Honor, we chose not to --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: I know you did.\nMR. PETRO: -- petition on that.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: I'm asking you your opinion.\nMR. PETRO: Your Honor, I would be most pleased\nto argue that there is no liberty interest in this\ninstance under Sandin. The Court made it very clear that\nwhere there is a mandatory State-created interest, that\ninterest would have to involve a significant and atypical\ndeprivation. In this instance, we do not believe that\nmoving an inmate to level 5 classification is a\nsignificant or atypical deprivation.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What if he were moved from\nlevel 1 to level 5?\nMR. PETRO: Your Honor, that has not occurred in\nreality. There have been several inmates that have moved\nfrom admission to level 5.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But why isn't the comparison\nthe entire prison population rather than just 5 versus 4?\nMR. PETRO: Your Honor, it's just typically what\noccurs, and so there are some circumstances where a level\n3 inmate may be moved to 5, but in any event, that inmate\nwould have been moved to 4. The classification jump is,\nin a practical standpoint --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, is it -- is it your view\nthat we should consider it the normal practice in the Ohio\nsystem to keep people in solitary for 23 hours a day?\nMR. PETRO: Your Honor, that's not the normal\npractice. In fact, it involves --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, then isn't that the\nstandard of reference that we should use?\nMR. PETRO: Your Honor, it involves a small\nnumber of inmates, and those inmates have been determined\nthrough a very predictive determination that -- that in\nfact they do pose a threat --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So we're -- we're dealing with\na small number of inmates out of a very large population,\nbut isn't the frame of reference for telling whether it's\na liberty interest a comparison to the large population?\nMR. PETRO: Your Honor, the -- the deprivation\nis -- is perhaps marginally greater, but I would suggest\nthat it is marginal, and therefore --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you say it's marginally\ngreater than 4. It's not marginally greater than 1 or 2\ncertainly.\nMR. PETRO: Your Honor, I would submit that it\nis -- it is more -- it is much greater than 4. But\nwhether it represents something that is unexpected by the\ninmate, in reality the inmate has an expectation of having\nhis liberty essentially extremely limited in this\ninstance --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, but the -- the point of\nthe case is that the inmate does not expect to be put in\nsolitary confinement for 23 or 23 and a half hours a day\nfor a period of 1, 2, or more years without some process\nto do it because that is so extraordinarily onerous and so\ndifferent from the general run of incarceration practice.\nMR. PETRO: And -- and, Your Honor, we initiated\na process. It is our New Policy 111-07, which the\ndistrict court and then the circuit court ultimately ruled\non, where we made --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That -- but that's what --\nthat's what you wanted to talk about, but we're on, first,\nthe preliminary question.\nMR. PETRO: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And is -- I think you started\nto say that you regarded atypical and significant as a\nfact-finding which was made against you --\nMR. PETRO: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- based on the extreme\nconditions of this kind of confinement where you don't see\nanother human.\nMR. PETRO: Yet, Your Honor, we would -- I would\ncontinue to -- to argue that it is not -- if it is\nsignificant and atypical, it is marginally significant and\natypical.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wasn't solitary confinement\ninvolved in Sandin?\nMR. PETRO: Yes, it was.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Didn't we say in Sandin that\nsolitary confinement was -- was not enough to -- to\ncreate --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: For how long?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: 30 -- for 30 days I believe,\nwasn't it?\nMR. PETRO: Yes, it was, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Not 1 year, 2 years, 3 years.\nMR. PETRO: No. And in this case the -- but --\nbut level 5 as a classification is a limited confinement.\nIt is reserved for those very dangerous inmates not\ndissimilar to Sandin.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But -- but typically it has\nbeen represented maybe -- maybe wrongly -- typically it\nhas been represented that they tend to be in there for a\nyear or 2-year periods.\nMR. PETRO: Your Honor, they are reviewed from a\nclassification standpoint on an annual basis. They are\nreviewed from a privilege standpoint -- and there's\ndifferent levels within 5 -- on a quarterly basis and\nso --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But in -- but in fact, they\ntend to be in there for the extended periods of time.\nIsn't that --\nMR. PETRO: That -- that's correct, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Mr. -- General Petro,\nI for one would like to hear what you have to say about\nthe question presented in your petition for certiorari.\nMR. PETRO: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. PETRO: In this instance, the process due,\nas provided by Ohio, was outlined in New Policy 111-07.\nThat policy was adopted and ultimately then reviewed by\nthe district court. The district court held it to be\nunconstitutional and added a number of other procedures.\nThe process that was contained in New Policy\n111-07 was a predictive policy, and it understood --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: May -- may I just ask you a\nquestion about that? I realize that there is a predictive\nelement. I don't think anyone disputes that. One of the\npoints of contention here, as I understand it, is that\neven the new policy did not give a -- an -- an inmate a\nstatement of the charge or reason for the -- for the\nreclassification to 5. Is -- is that correct?\nMR. PETRO: Your Honor, it gave notice, 48 hours\nin advance, under the new policy --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Notice of what?\nMR. PETRO: Notice of the fact that there would\nbe a reclassification.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But did it give notice of the\nreason for the reclassification? You did such and such.\nYou are such and such kind of person, a gang member. Does\nit tell him anything?\nMR. PETRO: It doesn't spell out -- in New\nPolicy 111-07, it doesn't spell out all the evidence, but\nit gives a basic --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, not the evidence, just the\nreason.\nMR. PETRO: It gives a basic statement that\nyou're being considered for reclassification.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I -- I know that, but does it\nsay you're being reconsidered for -- considered for\nreclassification because you hit somebody over the head or\nbecause you've shown that you're a member of a gang or\nsome other reason?\nMR. PETRO: It -- it as a general rule does not\nhave to do that, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What about -- I mean, the\nperson, if he reads the regulation, would see that it says\nthat to classify him, the State has to show that through\nrepetitive and seriously disruptive behavior, he has\ndemonstrated a chronic inability to adjust as evidenced by\nrepeated class 2 rule violations.\nMR. PETRO: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So I guess he would like to\nknow give me at least a vague idea of what behavior you're\ntalking about and which class 2 rule violations you're\ntalking about. Now, does the notice tell him those two\nthings?\nMR. PETRO: The notice is very general in its\nnature. At the time that the hearing actually commences,\nthere's an opportunity to sit down and actually discuss\nwith the inmate, and the inmate can respond in writing or\nin presence at the -- at the hearing --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you say he has the\nopportunity. Do you actually tell him you are about to be\nreclassified or our proposal is to reclassify you because\nyou violated this particular regulation by this particular\nconduct?\nMR. PETRO: There is -- what initiates the\nreclassification is a report form that would identify to\nthe inmate --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I'm asking you what you tell\nthe inmate, not what initiates your process. Now, please\nanswer my question.\nMR. PETRO: The inmate, Your Honor, has access\nto the report form that says specifically what's\ninitiated.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: At which point does he get --\nat which point does he get access?\nMR. PETRO: At the point of notice.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So -- so this -- I mean, that's\nwhat I don't understand what this case is about because I\n-- I'm amazed that -- I think it is too detailed what\nthey're requiring of you, by far.\nBut the elements are I have to know. I'm an\ninmate. I want to know what is this about. Suppose I\nthink they're wrong. I need to know how to tell them\nthey're wrong. And the other thing I think I'd need to\nknow is after the committee or the warden decides against\nme, what are his reasons. I'm not asking for a book. All\nI want to know are the basic reasons.\nNow, those things I can't work out from the\nbriefs, quite honestly, whether the new policy gives him\nthose new things, those two things, or doesn't.\nMR. PETRO: The new policy gives him the basic\ninformation that we are asserting that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, already you say that, but\nI would think the basic information includes some idea of\nwhat my disruptive behavior was and some idea of what the\nclass 2 violations that I was convicted of were. And now,\nI've heard you both say that he does get it and that he\ndoesn't get it. I'm sure that's my fault, but I want to\nknow, does he get this information before the hearing, or\ndoes he not?\nMR. PETRO: Your Honor, he gets the basic reason\nfor the classification and that's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now -- you heard what I said.\nMR. PETRO: Yes, I did, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Does he get what I just said?\nMR. PETRO: Yes, he does.\nJUSTICE BREYER: He does.\nMR. PETRO: He gets the basic information. He\ndoesn't get a list of any evidence.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what does he -- can you\n-- can you describe it for us what -- he gets 48 hours\nnotice.\nMR. PETRO: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Notice that's there's going to\nbe a hearing. What else does he get? Does he get a\nsummary of the written report? Does he get a -- a\nstatement of -- of the reasons? What --\nMR. PETRO: At the close of the hearing, he --\nthere is --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No. Before the hearing\nstarts, he gets 48 hours notice, but is he -- is he just\ntold there's going to be a hearing in 48 hours and that's\nit?\nMR. PETRO: There's going to be a hearing and\nit's for reclassification, and here is -- here is the --\nthe actual report that actually identifies what has\ntriggered this activity for reclassification.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So he does get the report.\nMR. PETRO: So he gets --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: 48 hours --\nMR. PETRO: But it's a very bare bones report\nand it doesn't identify the specific evidence involved\nwhich --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, I don't care that he\ndoesn't have evidence.\nMR. PETRO: Okay.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I want to know that he thinks\nhe's being sent to this prison because his roommate, Rat\nFink, has made up a bunch of stories about him. All\nright? So he needs to know whether -- what it is that --\nthat this board is considering before he can come in and\nexplain what it isn't true. He doesn't have to have all\nthe evidence. He has to know what the point is, what the\ncharge is, what the claim is. And you're saying he gets\nit because he has the report.\nIs there an example in the record of a report?\nMR. PETRO: There's an example of the report\nform that is filled out by the prison officials at the\ntime that a reclassification is going to occur, and the\ninmate does have access to that report form at the time of\nnotice.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Perhaps we can be concrete.\nIf he -- suppose the charge is he is a gang leader. Will\nhe get notice that says you are being considered for\nreclassification because you are a gang leader?\nMR. PETRO: Yes, Your Honor, he does get that\nnotice. He gets that basic form that basically says he's\nbeing reclassified.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Not that he's been\nreclassified, but is the reason -- the reason that you are\nbeing reclassified is that you are a gang leader. Those\n-- those words, you are a gang leader. Will he get those?\nMR. PETRO: He gets the -- the accusation. He\nknows the accusation is made from the report form that is\nprepared by the prison officials. So he knows --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I --\nMR. PETRO: -- that one of those criteria has\nbeen asserted --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you this question?\nMR. PETRO: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'm just -- is the procedure\nyou're describing the procedure that was reviewed by the\ndistrict court?\nMR. PETRO: The procedure. Yes, it is. New\nPolicy 111-07 is what the district court reviewed and then\nwhat was further reviewed by the circuit court.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So the evidence in the record\nbefore the district court describes exactly what you're\ndescribing.\nMR. PETRO: The evidence that's in the record\nwas the procedure in place prior to the enactment of New\nPolicy 111-07, and the court choose -- chose to review for\nprocedural purposes Policy 111-07 and then make its\ndecision based on New Policy 111-07. So the evidence\nthat's in the record, the testimony at the -- during the\ntrial, really is not relevant to this policy. It's\nrelevant to the former policy.\nIf -- if --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: General Petro, I -- I don't --\nI'm going to ask you a very tendentious question, but it's\nsomething I don't want to make a mistake on. Going back\nto your answer to Justice Ginsburg's question, when he is\ngiven what you described as the bare bones report at the\nbeginning of the proceedings, when he gets the 48-hour\nnotice, will in her example the bare bones report say you\nare being reconsidered for reclassification because you\nare believed to be a gang leader? Does he get the gang\nleader information?\nMR. PETRO: Yes, he does generally. It doesn't\ngive any evidence. It simply is --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No. I'm not --\nMR. PETRO: Okay.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I'm not worried about evidence.\nMR. PETRO: I understand.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Just I want to know the charge.\nWill he always get the charge?\nMR. PETRO: He will get the -- there is a form\nthat is completed, a long form that is completed by the\nprison officials that basically stipulates the predicate\nact or the predicate acts that really result in the\nreclassification action.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So that in the gang leader\nexample, he will be told that it's because he is accused\nof being a gang leader that this is occurring.\nMR. PETRO: Yes, because that is part of the\nform.\nWith the Court's permission --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And the form -- and the form\nis in the record, I take it.\nMR. PETRO: Yes, it is.\nWith the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Where?\nMR. PETRO: With the Court's permission, I'd\nlike to reserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, General\nPetro.\nMs. Maynard, we'll hear from you.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Maynard, before you start,\nmaybe you could answer the question I tried to ask at the\nend of his argument. Where in the record is the report?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DEANNE E. MAYNARD\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMS. MAYNARD: JA-58 is the form, and if you look\nat that, you'll see that it has a line that says, you are\nbeing considered for a transfer for the following reasons,\ncolon, and there's a blank to be filled in.\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:\nThe procedures that Ohio provides for placement\ninto its supermax prison facility are more than ample to\nsatisfy due process.\nAs the Federal Government has argued in its\nbrief, the Bureau of Prisons believes there is no liberty\ninterest implicated here. But even if one assumes that\nthere is, the type of decision at issue is inherently a\npredictive one that turns on the holistic judgment of\nprison officials.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why is it a predictive\njudgment that a person is a gang leader? The ultimate\ndecision, given the facts and circumstances, we predict\nthat this person is among the worst of the worst, but the\nfindings that have to be made along the way are not\nnecessarily predictive. I mean, it -- it would be nice if\nthe -- if the issues came simply divided what happened in\nthe past, what might happen in the future, but the\njudgment that's made to classify someone as 5 inevitably\ninvolves some, well, what happened in the past on the\nbasis of which we can project what might happen in the\nfuture.\nMS. MAYNARD: That's true, Justice Ginsburg. We\nwould have three responses to that.\nOne is first in Ohio, as in the Federal Bureau\nof Prisons, in the large majority of instances, most of\nthe facts upon which a predictive assessment would turn\nhave already been subject to some more formal type --\ntrial-type procedure. For example, in the Bureau of\nPrisons, the vast majority of prisoners who are placed in\none of our two more restrictive facilities have committed\nsome violent act in prison for which they have been found\nto be guilty pursuant to formal Wolff-type, trial-type\nprocedures.\nSecondly, with respect to facts that might be\ntaken into consideration for which there hasn't yet been\nsuch a formal trial-type proceeding, this Court has made\nclear that when you're talking about the types of\npredictive risk assessments that are at issue here, it is\nappropriate for prison officials, using their expertise\nand judgment and knowledge of the prison conditions in\ntheir prison and in the prison system as a whole, to take\ninto account things that are rumor, innuendo, and other\nimponderables that may not have been proven in any fact-\ntype proceeding.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that would be -- that\nwould be a what happened question, not what might happen.\nWhat happened, the determination might be made on the\nbasis of rumor or innuendo. My only point is that\nquestions don't come labeled so simply, predictive versus\nwhat happened in the past.\nMS. MAYNARD: That's true. I agree with that.\nBut again, I believe that most of the -- the facts upon\nwhich these decisions are based and -- and Ohio asserts in\nits brief that that's the case in their case too, that\npeople who are placed in level 5 have either been subject\nof a rule board's infraction hearing or have committed a\ncrime for which they've been convicted while in prison.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And suppose neither of those\nare -- are so.\nMS. MAYNARD: Well, I -- as I say, I think in\nthe vast majority of cases, in both the Federal system and\nOhio, that is the case. But even so, the consideration at\nissue takes into a broader spectrum of consideration than\njust the individual inmate. Having the type of formal\nfact-finding retrospective proceeding that the court below\nrequired here is going to focus the decision-maker in the\nwrong direction and on a more narrow set of facts than\nideally we want the prison administrators to focus upon.\nWe want them to be looking at, just like in Hewitt, the\nrelationship of this inmate to other inmates, of inmates\nwithin the prison generally, of inmates to this inmate,\nand the safety of others. So there's more of them at\nstake. There are other private interests at stake besides\nthose of the individual who may be moved in the prison\nadministration's --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, those two, it seems to\nme, are all questions of -- of fact. I mean, ultimately\nyour position may be correct, but I -- I just can't place\na lot of store in this predictive versus nonpredictive\njudgment, and it's contrary to your own argument. You\nsay, well, in almost all the cases, it's because he's been\nconvicted of a crime in prison and so forth. Well, that\n-- that undercuts, it seems to me, the -- the basic\nargument that you're trying to make that established this\nline between predictive and nonpredictive judgment.\nI -- I suppose you would say even in cases where\nit is a matter of past effect, these procedures are -- are\nadequate. Or would you?\nMS. MAYNARD: Yes. We believe that the\nprocedures that Ohio provides are -- are more than\nadequate because it gives the prisoner notice of the\ncharges and an opportunity to contest the placement\ndecision. In fact, we believe that the -- the process\nthat Ohio provides is more than is necessary to satisfy\ndue process.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Maynard, this is a class\naction, isn't it?\nMS. MAYNARD: Yes, it is, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What if -- what if for some of\nthe prisoners, maybe a majority of the prisoners, this --\nthis reality of having a prior factual hearing exists, but\nfor some of it, it doesn't? What -- what disposition\nwould this Court then make of the case?\nMS. MAYNARD: There's -- still, the appropriate\nanalysis, when you're talking about -- basically what we\nhave at bottom --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But I mean, suppose I think\nthat a -- a trial-type proceeding is necessary, and in\nfact, it's been given for most of the people in this class\naction, but not for the rest. What happens to the case?\nMS. MAYNARD: It seems to me that you hold that\n-- that the procedures here are adequate because -- under\nthe Due Process Clause because in the broad range of\ncases, you're going to have sufficient notice and an\nopportunity to contest.\nAgain, I think it's really important to\nunderstand the nature of the decision issued here. It's\nreally a gestalt judgment of prison officials exercising\ntheir expertise in an area that this Court has repeatedly\nsaid prison officials get a wide range of deference.\nAgain, I would like to make a point about the\nFederal Bureau of Prisons because the respondents have\npointed to our control unit procedures which are more\ntrial-like. And I just want to let the Court know that\nthose procedures were imposed upon the Federal Government\nand the Bureau of Prisons pursuant to a court order in\n1978 before this Court issued its decision in cases such\nas Hewitt where the Court made clear this distinction\nabout prison placement and issues involving the judgment\nand predictive decisions of prison administrators. When\nthe Bureau of Prisons has been --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Did you ask for -- did the\nGovernment move for modification of a decree? I -- I\nassume that it was not a decision of this Court. You said\nthis -- what you do in the supermax at the Federal level\nhas been imposed by a court. Which court?\nMS. MAYNARD: Let me clarify one thing. What --\nit would be -- this relates only to the control unit,\nwhich is now at -- at -- in -- in part of the ADX Florence\nfacility. It does not apply to the general populations of\nthe ADX Florence facility and the Marion facility.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, you talked about\nsomething being imposed.\nMS. MAYNARD: Right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And so I want to know what\nwas imposed, first, by whom, by which court, and what --\nwhat the order was.\nMS. MAYNARD: The injunction was entered by the\nEastern District of Illinois and was affirmed by the\nSeventh Circuit in a case called Bono v. Saxby. And the\nFederal court -- the -- the Bureau of Prisons adopted the\nregulations pointed to by the respondents in the C.F.R. as\nit -- in -- in -- to comply with that injunction. We have\nnot yet sought to have that injunction set aside, but\nthose procedures apply to a very small number of Federal\nprisoners.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But even so, I mean, you were\nsaying this was forced on -- on the -- effectively on the\nGovernment. Well, it seems to me if that were the case,\nyou would, after this Court rendered the decisions it did\nin Hewitt and Sandin, say, Seventh Circuit, please\nreconsider. It sounds to me as though you haven't done\nthat so you probably think it's okay.\nMS. MAYNARD: We don't think it's\nconstitutionally required, Justice Ginsburg. It hasn't --\nwe haven't moved to set it aside because it hasn't caused\nan administrative burden. There are currently only 49\ninmates in the control unit at Florence. In the last\ndecade, we have only placed 118 inmates there, and so we\nwere able to cope with these burdensome procedures with\nrespect to those numbers.\nBut it's important to note that what we do when\nwe -- what the Bureau of Prisons does when it was free to\ndecide its own process is detailed at pages 26 to 28 of\nour brief, and that applies to a large number of\nprisoners, 550 who are in the general populations of -- in\nvery similar conditions to those in the Ohio State\npenitentiary. And there we have adopted a much less\nformal process even than the one that Ohio does, and we\nbelieve that is also constitutionally sufficient.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, is -- is the population\nwith respect to which you have adopted the far more\nlenient process a -- the population of the control unit,\nwhich I understand is comparable to the unit we're talking\nabout in Ohio, or is it with respect to the general\nmaximum security population which is housed in conditions\nless onerous than the control unit?\nMS. MAYNARD: It is -- applies to the general\nconditions in ADX -- the general populations in ADX\nFlorence and USP Marion.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, and --\nMS. MAYNARD: But those conditions, Your Honor,\nare similar to the Ohio State penitentiary. The\ndifference between -- may I finish, Justice -- Mr. Chief\nJustice?\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Yes.\nMS. MAYNARD: The -- the difference in the\ngeneral population, the prisoners are out 10 to 12 hours a\nweek for recreation, and in the control unit, they are out\n7 hours a week.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Ms.\nMaynard.\nMr. Lobel, we'll hear from you.\nWould you tell us what happened in Mr. Austin's\ncase? I mean, did he get a notice and that sort of thing?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JULES LOBEL\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. LOBEL: Yes. Yes, Your Honor. May -- Mr.\nChief Justice, and may it please the Court:\nIn many of the cases -- and I -- I will try to\n-- in Mr. Austin's case and many of the other cases,\npeople didn't get a notice. I'd like to try to explain\nwhat they get and what they don't get.\nFirst, they do not get a final decision which\ngives them reasons.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, could you answer\nmy question first? What kind of notice, if any, did Mr.\nAustin get?\nMR. LOBEL: I think Mr. Austin got no notice.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Perhaps you can take us\nthrough this chronologically. You -- you began at the\nend.\nMR. LOBEL: Okay. The notice they get at the\nbeginning is an -- a notice which sometimes includes the\nreasons, sometimes it doesn't include the reasons. What\nthe requirement in this policy is and what was found at\ntrial was that often they would get very vague reasons\nlike you're a gang member or a gang leader. Now --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then can you just explain that?\nBecause the policy says that he shall get notice and\nattached to the notice will be a committee report. Then\nthey have a copy of the form that the report is supposed\nto fill out on page 58 to about page 78 and it's about the\nmost detailed thing I've ever seen. So --\nMR. LOBEL: Yes, that they don't get. That they\ndo not get.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Even though -- you mean even\nthough it says that the policy says you should be noticed\nand you're -- it says, attached to the notice will be a\ncopy of the -- I'm sorry. I'm looking -- am I looking at\nthe wrong place?\nMR. LOBEL: I think you're reading in the wrong\nplace. But it -- there -- they do attach something, but\nit's not that long form. That long form is what was never\ngiven to the prisoners which would tell them what it is\nthat they were said to have done.\nFor example, if --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: May I -- may I -- I just want\nto make sure. There is then a direct disagreement of fact\nbetween you and the Attorney General. I understood him to\nsay they got the form that starts at JA-58, and I\nunderstand you to be saying they don't.\nMR. LOBEL: They do not. The form that starts\nat JA-58 they get, but the form that starts at JA-58 is\nonly one page. It's JA-58. They get that form. That\nform says you'll tell them the reasons.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nMR. LOBEL: So at this -- at -- at -- during the\ntrial, often they didn't get the -- they didn't get any\nnotice.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. LOBEL: But now they should get a notice.\nIt should tell them some reason.\nThe problem at trial was that --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: You mean a trial\nbefore all the -- before they were about to be committed\nor the hearing at which it was determined whether they\nwould be or not?\nMR. LOBEL: At the hearing and -- they got a\nnotice. The notice said you're a gang leader. How is a\nman supposed to respond to a vague notice that I'm a gang\nleader when he doesn't know what it is that they are\nsaying is their -- is the reason that he's a gang leader?\nAll he could say -- this isn't like a trial. It's not a\ntrial-type procedure. What happens in reality --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, do you think it should\nbe?\nMR. LOBEL: No.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: I mean, this is a prison\nclassification, for goodness sakes.\nMR. LOBEL: No. We're not --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: He's been found guilty and\nsentenced to prison.\nMR. LOBEL: Right, and we're not --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: The question is what\nprocedures are required. And we've given a lot of\ndiscretion in prison administration.\nMR. LOBEL: And -- and we are not asking for\ntrial-type procedures. All we're asking for is very\nminimal due process, which is that the person comes before\na committee of three correction officials, and they say,\nwhat do you have to say for yourself? They don't present\nany evidence. They don't present witnesses. They say,\nyou're a gang leader. What do you have to say for\nyourself?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Here is the exact words I -- I\nthink. It's -- tell me. This certainly seems to be\nright. The inmate shall be served with notice at least 48\nhours prior to the commencement of a hearing. The notice\nshall include all of the reasons for the proposed\nplacement --\nMR. LOBEL: No.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- and a summary of the\nevidence relied on. Now, I'm just reading that. What is\nit I'm reading?\nMR. LOBEL: That's -- that's the district\ncourt's order. That's not what they -- that's the revised\npolicy under the district court's order.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Where is -- where\nis --\nMR. LOBEL: Where is theirs?\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm sorry. You go ahead.\nMR. LOBEL: Their policy is, I believe, on page\nJA-23. That tells you what they -- they say. He is to be\nserved with a notice of hearing form 48 hours prior to the\nhearing.\nThat will -- that -- there were problems with\nthis. One is very vague notice. You're a gang leader.\nThey have evidence for why he's a gang leader. In Mr.\nRoe's case, who's one of the plaintiffs, the evidence\nwhich -- which was never told to the prisoner -- the\ncommittee didn't even know the evidence. The evidence was\nthat he was hit over the head with a spatula while he was\nwaiting on line at the maximum security lunch line, and he\nwent to the hospital, and he never fought back. And from\nthis, somebody determined that he was a gang leader\nbecause the people who were being targeted at that time\nwere gang leaders.\nNow, if you take a man and say, come before a\ncommittee, we're not going to tell you what this is about,\njust that you're a gang leader, what do you have say for\nyourself --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, what's -- what's\nwrong with that?\nMR. LOBEL: Because --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: I mean, if he can --\nif he's not a gang leader, he can tell them why he isn't.\nMR. LOBEL: He'll say I'm not a gang leader.\nBut if they know and the reason is because he was involved\nin this fight, which -- in which he didn't fight back, he\nshould be able to then say, well, this guy -- you're\nwrong. This guy beat me up because I insulted him, or\nhe's been an enemy of mine. He has something to respond.\nOtherwise, he can just say I'm not a gang leader.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: You -- you want a\ntrial-type proceeding.\nMR. LOBEL: This is a far cry from a trial. A\ntrial -- the State would have to put on witnesses. They'd\nhave to prove something. All you're doing here is saying\nto the man, we're going to give you an opportunity to\nrespond. And the question is, do you have to give them\nnotice detailed enough? And that's all the district court\nrequired was some summary so that it's detailed enough so\nthat he can respond. And really, all they have to do is\ntake that form that they print up, Justice Breyer, which\nyou were looking at, that long form, and copy it and\nappend it to the notice.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, there is -- isn't there\nthe problem -- at least Ohio suggested that there is --\nthat if this person is indeed a gang leader and the form\nsays so-and-so and so-and-so effectively ratted on you,\nthose persons who came forward might not live to see\nanother day?\nMR. LOBEL: And the district court ordered what\nOhio does in all its disciplinary proceedings, what the\nFederal Government does in its disciplinary proceedings,\nwhich is if it's confidential information, you don't have\nto turn it over because they understand that, Justice\nGinsburg. The district court understood that.\nBut in Mr. Roe's case, it wasn't confidential\nthat he was hit over the head. Or in Mr. Thompson's case,\nit wasn't confidential that they said to him, you were\npresent at some fight and they didn't tell who he was\nfighting and they never were -- they never gave him any of\nthe -- the details so -- to be able to respond.\nIf it's confidential, they don't have to turn it\nover. The district court --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But was -- was this under the\nold policy that you're talking about what occurred?\nMR. LOBEL: Yes, Your Honor. It was under --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes. And I thought that we\nhad to address this facial challenge insofar as it affects\nthe new policy. And if the State complied with the new\npolicy, what is your complaint with that?\nMR. LOBEL: The -- the new policy, which really\nwas in all honesty, Your Honor, a tweaked policy or a\nmodified policy -- they took the old policy and they made\nsome changes to it. The question before the Court is\nwhether that new policy fixed the problems. We saw the\nproblems --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Which was never -- never in\neffect, right? The new policy --\nMR. LOBEL: Never went into effect.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So all -- the evidence\nrelates to the old policy which I think Ohio recognizes\nwas not adequate. And then there's -- Ohio has this new\npolicy, and you, just on the basis of the written\nstatement of the policy, made the judgment that it's not\ngood enough.\nMR. LOBEL: It doesn't on -- just on the face of\nit, it doesn't fix the problem that the district court\nfound. Vague notice. The other thing they would do is\nthey would give the person notice of one reason --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, let -- you keep talking\nabout what happened in the past, and I'm -- I find some\ndifficulty with that because we're being asked to review a\nnew policy. And I would like you to look at the new\npolicy, show us where to find it in the record, and tell\nus specifically what's wrong with it.\nMR. LOBEL: I'll give you a very specific --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Could -- could you refer to\nsomething?\nMR. LOBEL: Page -- look at page 22 and -- 23\nand 33 of the new policy. Look at 23.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Where -- where is that?\nMR. LOBEL: JA-23. Look at JA-23 and look at\nJA-33.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: All right. I'm on 23. What\nare we --\nMR. LOBEL: On 23, you look at the final\ndecision-maker -- the Bureau of Classification -- the\nbottom line of the next-to-the-last paragraph -- will\nreview the recommendation and any objections filed and\nmake a final decision.\nNow, here's what was happening, and I --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Is this happening\nunder the new policy?\nMR. LOBEL: That's the new policy.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: But now, you just were\ngoing to say here's what was happening. Do you mean under\nthe new policy?\nMR. LOBEL: No. The question is whether this\npage 23 fixes what was happening in the past. This is\ntheir new policy.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, why -- why is\nthat the question? If the new policy meets constitutional\nstandards, why does it have to fix something else?\nMR. LOBEL: Your Honor, it doesn't meet\nconstitutional standards because it only says the chief\nhas to make a final decision. The chief doesn't have to\ngive any reasons for it, and I don't know of any case in\nthis Court in predictive decisions, in punitive decisions\nwhere a -- a decision-maker can send somebody to solitary\nconfinement long-term. And Justice Souter, it's for at\nleast 2 years. Over 200 people there were for more than 3\nyears, which was really the -- the -- only limited by how\nlong the building was open -- and say, I'm putting you in\nthere and I'm not telling you why. And this policy lets\nthem do it, and that's what they were doing.\nAnd there's nothing in this policy to change\nthat. And what was happening --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So I think I've got your point.\nTell me if I -- I mean, I've now looked at -- this is very\nconfusing to me. I'm sure it's my fault. But I take it,\nif you look at page 22, that's the new policy.\nMR. LOBEL: Exactly.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And what the new policy says\nis, committee, you must give the prisoner some\ninformation. Then it refers to form 2598. Form 2598 is\nthe form on page 58.\nMR. LOBEL: Exactly.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What that tells him is nothing\nabout the facts. That tells him he's been charged.\nPeriod.\nMR. LOBEL: He's been charged for being a gang\nleader.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, the new policy goes on to\nsay, the classification committee shall document\ninformation presented by staff and the inmate which is\nform 2627 and 2628. And I don't know where 2698 fits in,\nbut 2698 are all those pages with the information.\nMR. LOBEL: And they don't have to give that to\nanybody.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And it just doesn't say\nanything about them at all.\nMR. LOBEL: And all the district court was\nsaying --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So your point is in the past,\nthey didn't give them the information.\nMR. LOBEL: They didn't give them the\ninformation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then they promulgated a new\npolicy and the new policy says nothing about it.\nMR. LOBEL: Exactly. And that is why it's\nfacially invalid. But if you look at what was happening,\nyou could --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: But form 58 -- I'm -- I'm\nlooking at page 58 -- says that the prisoner will be given\nthis form that says you were referred to the\nclassification committee for the following reasons. And\nthat leaves space to be filled out. What's the matter\nwith that?\nMR. LOBEL: And -- two problems with that. It\ncould either say you're a gang leader, and second, it\ncould say which --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: This is a facial attack.\nWhat in the world is the matter with that, saying you were\nreferred for the following reasons and leaving space to\nhave it filled out? Is that defective under the Due\nProcess Clause?\nMR. LOBEL: Because you -- at trial we showed\nwhat the practice was.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: You showed what happened in\nthe past.\nMR. LOBEL: And the question is, does this fix\nit? And what happened in the past was they gave, for\nexample, a prisoner, and it said, here are the reasons.\nThe reason is you stabbed somebody. The committee said,\nyou stabbed somebody. It wasn't very bad. We recommend\nthat you not be put in the place. In over 50 percent of\nthe cases of those committee recommendations on retention,\nthe chief rendered a decision, without giving a final --\nany real reasons, and used evidence and reasons which were\nnever given to the inmate.\nIn Ohio's brief, they say we could still do\nthat. We only have to give them some reason. For\nexample, we have to say you're a gang member. If it turns\nout that you're -- turns out you're not a gang member, the\nchief can say later on, well, you were dealing drugs.\nThat's -- that's not adequate. Facially it's not adequate\nto give the person some reason and then switch the reason\nin the middle of the game. And that's what was happening.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, I can understand that\nyou could come on behalf of a prisoner on an as-applied\nchallenge, but to look at this form and tell us it is\nfacially invalid is difficult for me to understand. If --\nif there are specific incidents where something was\ndefective, then challenge it, but what's the matter with\nthe form?\nMR. LOBEL: Well -- well, the first thing that's\nmatter with the form is it doesn't require reasons for the\ndecision.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: It's --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, why does the Due\nProcess Clause require reasons?\nMR. LOBEL: Even in Salerno, the -- the -- this\nCourt held that in a preventive case, the bail -- the bail\nreform statute still requires, as a basic modicum of due\nprocess, that you give the person the reason --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: That -- that was a\nstatute.\nMR. LOBEL: That was a statute, and the Court\nrelied on that for why the statute was constitutional.\nEven in Greenholtz, the parole case, the -- this\nCourt said over and over again that in the -- in the\nparole decision, which is much more predictive than here,\nthe parole board gave its reasons for why it --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: This form says, state the\nreasons, and leaves blank space to do that.\nMR. LOBEL: But that's --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: So what's the matter?\nMR. LOBEL: That's in the notice. It's not in\n-- it's not in the decision.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, what it says about --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It -- it seems to me that the\n-- the facial attack objection would -- would not be --\ncarry much weight if what happened was this. There was a\ntrial. The policies were found deficient, and the court\nsaid, you devise some new forms. At that point, it seems\nto me that the facial attack would -- objection would --\nwould not be relevant. And -- and your point would be\nright. You say, you know, they -- they haven't -- this\ndoesn't -- is not going to cure the -- the deficiency.\nBut what happened here was that, as I understand\nit, midway in the litigation there was a new policy, and\nit -- it seems -- so we have sort of a moving target that\nwe're working with.\nMR. LOBEL: Yes. Your Honor, it depends --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Could you comment on that?\nMR. LOBEL: It depends on what you mean by\nmidway. On the eve of trial, as we approached the trial\ncourt for trial, they promulgated the new policy which was\nnot supposed to be implemented until several months after\ntrial. And it seems in that situation perfectly\nreasonable for a district court to say, here are the\nproblems that I've uncovered. I'm going to look at the\nnew policy and see if this new policy fixes it.\nThe -- the problems were not moot, Justice\nO'Connor. These were ongoing problems. There were 200\nprisoners who were there under a deficient policy. The\nquestion then was, were they entitled to something better?\nAnd did this new policy give them something better?\nAnd the -- the district court found, I think\nquite correctly, that it gave them a little better. It\nwas tweaked. It was modified. But on some of the basic\nquestions of whether or not you can bait and switch the\nreasons, whether you could tell somebody you're in here\nfor drugs and then the classification chief could -- could\nput him in for something else, or whether you had to give\nthem some reason that he can respond to -- in a situation\nwhere you're not having a trial, Mr. Chief Justice, where\n-- where the State does not have to come forward with any\nevidence. The only evidence the person is getting of what\nis his problem is this notice.\nAnd the question is, when that is the only\nevidence -- it's not like a trial like in the Federal\ncourts where you have to present witnesses, you have to\nmeet a standard of proof. It's not even in the -- like a\ndisciplinary trial where you have to meet a certain\nstandard of proof and present witnesses. The committee\nsits there. The guy comes in and they say to him, tell us\nwhy you're not a gang leader. And he says, well, tell me\nwhy you think I am a gang leader. And they should be\nforced to tell him that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, what's wrong\nwith giving him the opportunity to say why he's not a gang\nleader?\nMR. LOBEL: How is Mr. Roe going to say I'm not\na gang leader because I wasn't hit over the head with a\nspatula because I'm a gang leader, I was hit over the head\nwith a spatula because the guy doesn't like me, unless he\nknows that that's why they think he is a gang leader? How\ncould he respond to that? All he could say is I don't\nknow what you're talking about.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But why can't you do that in an\nas-applied challenge? I mean, it may be that there was\nall this -- suppose we wrote an opinion hypothetically.\nSuppose -- and it said, look, I've read through this new\npolicy. I assume it will be administered in accordance\nwith the elements of due process, the basic elements being\nsome kind of notice basically what -- what the factual\npart is, some kind of opportunity to present proofs in\nevidence that's a reasonable one, and some kind of\ndecision by a neutral decision-maker.\nCertainly the language of the new policy permits\nsuch an interpretation. It doesn't -- and -- and suppose\nwe were to say, well, we assume it will have the basic\nelements, and it's so complex, so detailed that -- that if\nthey don't, then the individual who suffers could bring a\nclaim and say it was administered unfairly in my case.\nMR. LOBEL: Your Honor, I think as a facial\nmatter, when you're putting somebody in long-term solitary\nconfinement for years and years in a small cell with no\npossibility of parole, you're -- I think you should give\nthem notice of the reasons in sufficient --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, I'm not disagreeing with\nyou.\nMR. LOBEL: -- in sufficient detail.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But you see -- yes. I'm -- I'm\nnot disagreeing with you. I'm saying I read their new\npolicy, now having gotten to it the third time through all\nthis detail, and it seems to me that they do give a\nnotice, and Justice O'Connor just pointed out where\nthere's a place for reasons. And as I read what happens\nafter the committee decides, it says, it shall make a\ndecision -- a recommendation accordingly -- according to\nthis very long, detailed form.\nMR. LOBEL: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And it doesn't say they won't\ntell the prisoner. It doesn't say whether they'll tell\nthe prisoner.\nMR. LOBEL: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So why can't I assume they will\ntell him so he'll know what's going on? And then if they\ndon't, you'd have an as-applied challenge.\nMR. LOBEL: Even if, as an abstract matter, you\ncould assume it, when you've had a 1-week trial with\nwitness after witness, and the witnesses say they're not\ndoing this --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That was before the new policy.\nMR. LOBEL: But the new policy is introduced at\ntrial. And the -- the question is -- really what you're\nsaying, Justice Breyer, is the mere introduction of the\nnew policy renders the whole case -- case moot.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What I'm now saying is I can\nunderstand exactly why you might feel the way you do. But\nour job is to not necessarily take that feeling. But\nshouldn't we presume that the State will administer words\nthat comport with the basic elements, not every detail as\nyou want, but they will administer this new policy in\naccord with those basic elements of fairness? Isn't that\ngiving a -- sort of like a deference to the State, which\nmaybe we should?\nMR. LOBEL: Maybe you should in an ordinary\ncase. Where there's been a trial and it's a clear pattern\nand practice that they're not, then I think that Friends\nof the Earth v. Laidlaw says that you have to show that\nthe new policy is going to cure the problems.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Are you -- are you saying that\nwhat we have before us is this, a trial which showed that\nthe pre-new policy procedures were deficient and the trial\njudge and you and a court of appeals interpreted the new\npolicies as remedies for past wrongs that were\nestablished? And the question is the adequacy of that\nremedy. That's one way to look at the case.\nMR. LOBEL: That's certainly one way.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Another way to look at the\ncase is to say that Ohio admitted that there were some\nimproprieties, showed its new policy, and the case turned\non the adequacy of the new policies. Now, those are two\ndifferent things. Which is this case?\nMR. LOBEL: But to look at it the second way,\nyou have to show that the problems proved at trial were\nmoot. If the problems are ongoing, then the plaintiffs\nare entitled to a remedy. You can't say that there are\nproblems that are ongoing, which there were -- they were\nall --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: But how can you know\nwhether the problems are ongoing if the new rules haven't\nbeen implemented?\nMR. LOBEL: Well, they are ongoing at trial.\nWhen the trial judge renders his decision, they're\nongoing. The question then is looking at this abstractly,\nit's not a question of in the abstract is it okay, but in\nthe abstract will it cure the problems.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Why -- why isn't it a\nquestion of as facially in the abstract is it okay?\nMR. LOBEL: Yes. Well, as I said, facially in\nthe abstract, I think it's not okay because I think they\nshould have final decision with reasons and notice with\nsufficient detail for reasons.\nBut even if you don't agree with me on that, I\nthink that this case, when you have an -- when you have a\ntrial and there's a pattern and practice of -- of\nproblems, I don't think that it's proper to simply assume\nthat a piece of paper which says we'll give reasons is\nadequate when the reasons that they're giving and that the\ntrial shows they're giving are inadequate. They're vague.\nThey're -- they're shifting the ball on people. And I --\nand I think --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question, Mr.\nLobel? Putting aside for a second which policy we look at\nand so forth, were there findings that particular inmates\nwere improperly sent to this facility?\nMR. LOBEL: There -- there were findings that --\nthat there were -- particular inmates who were improperly\n-- were sent with no evidence against them.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: All right, and was there any\n-- any order saying that inmate should get out and go to a\ndifferent facility?\nMR. LOBEL: No. The district court simply\nordered that since there was a widespread showing of\narbitrary and capricious placement and -- and that there\nwas a showing that they built the prison for 500 -- with\n500 cells and they didn't need 500 cells and they were\nputting people in there who didn't need -- who didn't meet\nthe criteria that they set forward -- there was a\nwidespread showing of that. The district court said you\nshould give them new hearings following a procedure which\nwould be sufficient to meet the constitutional Due Process\nClause.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And so the State then came\nback and said we're putting in this new policy, we will\ngive them new hearings under the new policy?\nMR. LOBEL: No. The -- the State never\nimplemented the new policy. The court said what you\nshould do is give them hearings, which give them notice\nsufficient to explain what's going on, render a final\ndecision which explains what's going on, give them a\nchance to produce witnesses if they have a -- if they have\nwitnesses, and they gave them hearings --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So that even though -- if I\nunderstand it correctly, even though there had findings\nthat some inmates have been improperly -- had had\ninadequate procedure as a predicate to going into the new\nfacility, they can just stay there until the litigation is\nover.\nMR. LOBEL: That's right because the district\ncourt didn't move any particular prisoner. But what\nhappened was when you --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Where do -- where do\nwe find those findings? Where in the record do we find\nthe findings about individual people?\nMR. LOBEL: They're -- they're all through the\ndistrict court's opinion. If you want to look at Mr. Roe,\nit's at 73 to 76. Mr. Thompson is at 77 to 79. All of\nthese were cases where the district court found people are\nbeing put in here on no evidence or essentially no\nevidence.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And as -- and as to those\nprisoners, was there a requirement that the -- that the\ncourt's procedures be made applicable and so there would\nhave to be a retroactive hearing as to those prisoners?\nMR. LOBEL: For all the prisoners. Several --\nseveral months later, there were new hearings. And what\nhappened then was that the amount of prisoners at this\nprison went from 330 to where it is right now, which is\n48, the same in the Federal control -- as in the Federal\ncontrol unit.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can you just give me 1 minute\non the other issue?\nMR. LOBEL: We're talking about 48 prisoners.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you tell us on -- on the\nliberty interest where we started with the --\nMR. LOBEL: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- with the Attorney General,\nis there a liberty interest in not being transferred from\nprison 1 -- level 1 to level 2 --\nMR. LOBEL: No.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- level 2, that sort of\nthing?\nWhy is it that there's a liberty interest in\nbeing transferred -- I guess being transferred from 4 to\n5?\nMR. LOBEL: We argued here that this was an\natypical, significant hardship compared not to level 1, 2,\n3, or 4, but compared to the segregation units, any other\nprison in Ohio, even the segregation units, and for three\nreasons, all of which in combination the court of -- the\ndistrict court held required a finding of liberty\ninterest.\nOne, it's long-term, indefinite. There were\nover 200 people here who were there for almost as long as\nthe building was open, and there was no reason to believe\nthat they were ever going to get out. It was indefinite.\nThat's very different than Sandin's 30-day disciplinary\nconfinement.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I thought there -- there was at\nleast annual review. Isn't -- wasn't there an annual --\nMR. LOBEL: There was an annual review, but the\ncommittee that they set up to review it, made up not of\nlaw professors, but made up of correctional officials,\nsaid --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And a good thing too.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. LOBEL: And a good thing, I agree. I would\n-- I would hate to be doing this.\nBut made up of wardens and deputy wardens, said\nMr. Roe, there's no reason you should be here, you should\nget out. And then based on reasons and evidence, which\nMr. Roe never knew, which the committee never knew -- the\ncommittee thought Mr. Roe was in there for one reason, and\nit turned out on trial he was in there for another reason.\nThe classification chief says to him -- says, you're going\nto stay here another year.\nMr. Roe goes back, has a perfect record, does\nevery program he can do. He comes back to the committee.\nThe committee says, Mr. Roe, you should get out of here\nagain. And the classification chief again says, I'm\nsorry, for no reason I'm just going to keep you here. And\nat that point you say, well, Mr. Roe, you may be here for\nthe rest of your life, and there's no -- this is not\ndefinite like in the control unit where --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What does the new policy say\nabout this?\nMR. LOBEL: Nothing.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Nothing about --\nMR. LOBEL: Nothing.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- about the annual review.\nMR. LOBEL: It says you get an annual review.\nThey got an annual review. The new policy doesn't say.\nAnd what the district court ordered was\ndraconian, that the classification chief, after he does\nthis, without hearing from the inmate, without giving him\nreasons, has to write a final decision, which gives him\nsome of the reasons that Mr. Roe is being kept there, and\nthat they have to tell him, like they told the prisoners\nin -- in Greenholtz, what you have to do to get out. What\n-- and that doesn't seem to me unreasonable. And all you\nhave to do is give a one-paragraph reason. Now, that's\nthe first reason, but that's not the only reason.\nThe State officials testified that this was\nqualitatively different than any other prisoner, that the\nlevel of restriction, the no outdoor recreation for many\nyears, that people have not been outside for years, the\nsmall cell with solid steel doors so that they could not\nhardly talk to anybody or see anybody, that these were\nconditions --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Did they have reading\nmaterials? I --\nMR. LOBEL: They had reading materials, yes,\nYour Honor, and they had televisions so they could watch\ntheir favorite programs.\nBut they had nobody to talk to. And we -- the\nexperiment that was done with long-term solitary\nconfinement, which this Court itself in the 1890's found\ncaused people to go crazy -- if you have to give people\nthe process that was required here to send the prisoner to\na mental institution, you should have to give them at\nleast that process to send them into a situation which is\ngoing to send them to the mental institution.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. LOBEL: And that's what's involved here.\nIt's a qualitatively different type of experience. And\nthe Seventh Circuit in U.S. v. Johnson said you cannot\nsentence somebody to -- into solitary confinement for the\nterm of their sentence because it's a qualitatively\ndifferent type of experience. It's not the 30 days in\nSandin. It's not the 7 weeks in Ewing. This is\nqualitatively different.\nAnd to top it off, the third reason is because\nthese people were automatically deemed ineligible for\nparole. And Justice Scalia, in Sandin, the Court said in\nthis case it's not -- the -- the prisoner isn't being\ndenied parole. Well, here we have evidence that there are\nprisoners who were -- the parole board said we will\nrelease you on parole. All you have to do is get out of\nthe supermax. The committee says -- a correctional\nofficials says, you're ready to go.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's not the whole class,\nthough.\nMR. LOBEL: Not --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You have a class action. It's\njust a few of them. In fact, there's -- there's no more\nparole in Ohio, as I understand it.\nMR. LOBEL: Yes, but a -- the vast -- I believe\nit's over 90 percent of the people who were in this prison\nwere sentenced under the old rules, under the old parole\nrules. And in addition, every prisoner who got sent to\nthis prison was delayed parole for the 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10\nyears that they were going to spend at this prison. So\nevery prisoner it affected.\nThank you very much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: General Petro, you\nhave 3 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES M. PETRO\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. PETRO: Thank you, Your Honor.\nIt has been pointed out that -- that inmates\nstay in the prison for many years, but in reality, over\n600 inmates since the opening of -- of Ohio State\npenitentiary in 1998 -- over 600 inmates have gone into\nlevel 5 and over 550 inmates have left level 5. And so\nthe classification process is an ongoing process.\nIt is now established under an order of the\ndistrict court, but we submit, Your Honors, that the new\npolicy that was presented in 2002 at the time this case\nwas pending trial, was a policy that provided a process\nwhich was the best type of process for a predictive\ndecision. This Court has often deferred to the decision-\nmaking of -- of prison officials in seeking to protect the\nsafety and security of the prison.\nAnd in this instance, the policy that was put in\nplace and the hearing process, without actually having\nessentially a fact-finding process, which is what the\ncourt has imposed on this process, was the kind of process\nthat allows for prison officials to review a whole variety\nof additional information even beyond what might be\nevidentiary.\nWhen we think about the conditions in the prison\nwhere the inmate is currently housed, if they're at the\nLucasville penitentiary in level 4 -- and the conditions\nthere are particularly volatile -- the prison officials\nneed to have the flexibility to make a decision on\nplacement in level 5 not only to protect this inmate but\nto protect the institution itself and the safety of the\ninmates and the safety, of course, of -- of the personnel\nthat work at the facility.\nIn the Mathews test, which was applied both by\nthe district court and by the court of appeals, there is\nclearly an acknowledgement that the interest of the\ngovernment is very strong. But in the second step of the\nMathews test, there's a recognition that additional\nprocedures really add no value to the decision-making\nprocess.\nHere the -- the government needs to have the\ncapacity and the -- the ability to make the best possible\ndecision looking at a whole variety of factors, and to\nhave a procedure put in place by the court that requires a\nfull display of all the evidence that will be presented at\nthe time of hearing, as incorporated in the notice to the\ninmate that a hearing will be held, and then an\nacknowledgement that there's -- only this evidence is the\nevidence that -- that is being relied upon really presents\nessentially a fact-finding hearing where the hearing\nprocess that is set forth in New Policy 111-07 is more\nthan just fact-finding. It's kind of an analysis. It\ngets an opportunity -- provides an opportunity to really\nassess the attitude of the inmate, the -- the risks that\nare involved in -- in placement in a -- in a different\nlevel in a different penitentiary. It is directed at\nprotecting the safety and the security of the inmates and,\nobviously, of protecting the -- the safety of the\npersonnel. And it is fully consistent with this Court's\nprecedents.\nIn applying the Mathews test --\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, General\nPetro.\nMR. PETRO: Thank you.\n"
