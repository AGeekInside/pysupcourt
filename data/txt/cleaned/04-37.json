        "content": "(11:02 a.m.)\nJUSTICE STEVENS: We'll now hear argument in\nClingman against Beaver.\nMr. Poe, as soon as you're ready, we'll hear\nfrom you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF WELLON B. POE, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. POE: Mr. Justice Stevens, and may it please\nthe Court:\nThis case today involves a conflict between\nOklahoma's semi-closed primary law and a rule adopted by\nthe Libertarian Party of Oklahoma which, contrary to that\nState law, would allow the Libertarian Party to open its\nprimary elections not just to independent voters, but also\nvoters registered as members of other political parties.\nThe Oklahoma primary system simply requires that\na person who is registered as a member of that party may\nonly vote in that political party's primaries. If the\nvoter desires to vote in another party's primary, all that\nvoter must do is, within a reasonable time before the\nelections, primary elections, approximately 7 to 8 weeks,\nis disaffiliate from that first party and then reaffiliate\nas a member of that second party, or if the parties so\nchose to allow independents, he may registered as an\nindependent in order to vote in that primary.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, of course, I guess from\nthe standpoint of the Libertarian Party, it's kind of a\nproblem because a voter who wants to disaffiliate under\nOklahoma law with their -- their prior registration have\nto do it basically 8 weeks ahead, at which time they don't\nknow if the Libertarian Party will even qualify for having\na primary. I mean, it just gives them a very impossibly\nshort window. If the time were reasonable, that might be\na different picture, but isn't that kind of burdensome?\nMR. POE: Well, Your Honor, the practicality of\nthat matter is -- is that generally the parties are\nnotified 10 days/2 weeks in advance of the registration\ndeadline that they are being -- if -- being recognized as\na political party. Of course -- and that's if that party\nhas waited until the very last minute by statute in which\nto turn in their petitions and try to get recognized. Of\ncourse, those petitions could be turned in earlier, which\nwould allow them more time to do so. But the practicality\nof the -- of --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If they're turned in earlier,\nwill they -- will they be ruled on earlier?\nMR. POE: Yes, Your Honor. The Oklahoma statute\nrequires that the election board take a -- has 30 days, a\nmaximum of 30 days, in which to review the petitions,\nverify the number of signatures and the authenticity of\nthose signatures, and then make a decision on whether to\nrecognize or not recognize the political party.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I guess there's a difference\nhere between the interest of a small party and a large\none. A small party would like, if there is a deadline, to\nbe as close to the election as possible so voters have a\nchance to get fed up with the two big parties.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's their chance. A big\nparty would like it to be further away because then they\ncan plan how their election campaign is going to be.\nHas any of this been litigated below?\nMR. POE: No, Your Honor. The -- the only\nquestion that has really been litigated below is whether\nsection 1-104, which is the semi-closed primary law, is\nburdensome on the association rights of the Libertarians.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In line -- in line with\nJustice Breyer's question, does the State of Oklahoma have\nan interest in insulating major parties from competition\nfor members?\nMR. POE: Not from insulating them from\ncompetition, Your Honor, but the State of Oklahoma does\nhave -- it has a closed primary system. It has -- it has\nan interest. And this Court has found that interest, as\nrecently as in Timmons, that it does have an interest in a\nstable political system, which may be a two-party system.\nAs long as --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So you have a -- the State has\nan interest in protecting major parties from losing their\nmembers and thereby weakening the two-party system by\nbenefiting a third party. I thought that's contrary to\nthe whole thrust of our holding in cases such as Anderson\nand Celebreeze where third parties are entitled to special\nprotection under the First Amendment.\nMR. POE: Well, Your Honor, since that time in\nAnderson and as Timmons and other cases cite, if the\nregulation is a neutral, nondiscriminatory regulation,\nthen it is a proper regulation as far as it is applied to\nall the parties.\nIn regards to the requirement of registration,\nchange of voter registration, all of those are applied\nequally across any -- any party, whether it be the\nLibertarian Party, the Democratic Party, Republican Party,\nor any other party which may be recognized at that time in\nthe State of Oklahoma.\nAnd back to Justice Breyer's comments, the\nperiod of 7 to 8 weeks prior to a voting -- to a primary\nelection is actually a very short time as compared, for\nexample, to Rosario which this Court --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, even in presidential\nelections, most people don't get interested until 4 or 5\nweeks before the election. Everybody knows that.\nMR. POE: Well, Your Honor, we -- this is not\nthe presidential primaries of which we're talking about.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm saying even in a\npresidential primary. If they're local races, it -- it\ntakes longer. The public just tunes out until the last --\nlast couple weeks.\nMR. POE: Well, the statutes in this -- or the\nsites or the -- the elections themselves are close in\ntime, and -- and the statutes involving the petitioning\nhave all been looked at as -- as courts and have been\nfound that this is a close enough connection to the time\nof the elections, that that time frame of petitioning and\ngetting the requirements for -- for petitions and the\nState recognizing the political party all fit comfortably\nwithin the confines of -- of constitutionality.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Poe, the -- the district\ncourt in this case rejected all grounds except one. It\nrejected the raiding and swamping. It said that's what\nthe Libertarians want to expose themselves to. It's not\nfor a State to be paternalistic to protect them against\ntheir own bad choices. But it said this request is\ndamaging to the majority parties, to the major parties,\nbecause it poaches on their members. But there is not in\nthis litigation any major party that's complaining about\nthat. So if that is the rationale that the district court\nwent on, can this Court possibly uphold it when there is\nnobody, as far as we know -- they haven't even come into\nthis case at this level, filing a friend of the Court\nbrief.\nMR. POE: Yes, Your Honor. This Court can find\n-- first of all, that the local Democratic and Republican\nParties were not named in -- in the action, and as to why\nthey were not in the action in lower courts I do not know.\nBut the State has its interests and has to protect those\ninterests whether those parties are involved in litigation\nor not.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, when you -- would you\nsay that the rationale on which the district court\nrejected the Libertarian Party's claim was unsatisfactory?\nMR. POE: No, Your Honor. Under Monroe before\nthis Court, I think the Court was looking to the\npotential, the possibility, of course. And as to the fact\npattern we had at the trial court, it was a very minor\nparty wanting to -- or effectively poach voters from the\ntwo major parties.\nBut you have to look at the entire statutory\nscheme and not just how it would apply. It could be\napplied by the Democrats or the Republicans.\nBut also more importantly, in Monroe this Court\nclearly stated that a State does not have to wait until it\nsees actual damage to its political or electoral system to\nmake reasonable decisions. In fact, this Court says the\nStates should have the foresight to make those reasonable\ndeterminations in an effort to prevent those -- those\npotential evils from occurring if the likelihood of -- of\nthat is there.\nAnd the district court made very --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Poe, I -- I -- here I am.\nMR. POE: Excuse me, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I suppose that if -- if I were\nthe party chairman of the Republican or Democratic Party,\nI'm -- I might have defended your -- your State system if\nI had been named as a party, but if I were not named as a\nparty, I'm not sure that I wouldn't -- I wouldn't decline\nto come in as an amicus, even though I'm interested in the\noutcome simply because I don't want to alienate my\nRepublican members by depriving them of the freedom, if\nthey want to do it, to go vote. You know, it makes you\nlook sort of parsimonious, doesn't it, when you tell your\nRepublican members, I don't want you to vote in the\nLibertarian primaries? I -- I don't think we can say that\nit doesn't hurt the Republican Party or the -- or the\nDemocratic Party simply because they hadn't filed an\namicus brief.\nMR. POE: I would agree, Your Honor. I -- I\nthink the -- the fact that they're not there -- here the\nCourt --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They are, after all,\npoliticians, aren't they?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. POE: And they do like to keep their party\nmembers as happy as they can.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Poe, may I just focus in\non exactly what the injury is? Is the injury that they\nvote with the Libertarians or that they don't vote with\ntheir own party?\nMR. POE: The -- the injury is twofold, Your\nHonor. And -- and first, it is the fact that by them not\nvoting in the primary to which they have associated -- and\nthat is registering as a Republican or a Democrat -- if\nthey go to the polling place and at the last minute decide\nto go and vote in the Libertarian Party primary, their\ndecision not to vote in the Republican primaries, when\ncandidates have been trying to -- to use voter lists\ntrying to get to their party members to vote --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But wouldn't it be precisely\nthe same injury if they just didn't like the Republican\ncandidate in that particular election, decided to stay\nhome?\nMR. POE: Well, if they had already made the\ndecision to stay home, then they would not be voting for\nthe candidate, but they would also not be voting in\nanother party's primary.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: How -- how are they hurt by\nthe fact that rather than staying home, they decide to\ncast a vote for a minority party candidate?\nMR. POE: Well, the party is here because it has\nthe -- the possibility, for those who are not voting, of\nchanging the elections of the candidates. And I think\nalso by --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it's very unlikely if\nit's a party that is -- gets the small vote that this\nparty gets. But you -- no matter how small the vote is,\nyou still find the injury to the major parties because\nthey voted for the Libertarians or because they didn't\nvote at all?\nMR. POE: Well, because they voted either way of\nvoting -- or for voting in the Libertarians and -- and not\nvoting, they have changed and possibly have changed,\nespecially when they went to the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is there any evidence on the\nquestion whether the -- the support for the major party\ncandidate is any smaller than it would have been if there\nhad been no Libertarian Party at all?\nMR. POE: There -- there's nothing in the record\nthat supports any of that.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And -- and a very similar\nquestion. Is there anything in the record that indicates\nthat those who would vote in the Libertarian primary are\nthe stay-at-home Republicans or the Republicans who would\notherwise have voted in the Republican primary?\nMR. POE: There -- there is nothing in the\nrecord. There was no type of polling. There was some --\nsome expert testimony as to the potential reasons for\npeople voting in a Libertarian primary such as purposeful\nintent to do harm to Libertarians or walking in intending\nto vote --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But that -- I mean, the\nLibertarians are happy to have -- take that risk.\nMR. POE: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It seems to me if we don't know\nwhether the -- the Republicans who are going to migrate to\nthe primary are stay-at-homes or Republican voters, the\nState has no basis even to say whether in fact the harm\nit's trying to prevent is going to be affected one way or\nthe other by its rule.\nMR. POE: Well, I -- I think, Your Honor, there\n-- there is a context or -- there is belief that it will\nharm. And there's been no polling in this action, and\nthere's no -- there was only one other State that has a\nopen -- what we have termed in this litigation as a -- a\nsemi-open primary. And there's no data that has\neffectively come out of their one primary that says why\npeople are not voting, why they're voting in one primary\nor not or the effects of that. I can give you --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Poe, I -- I -- why do you\nrely only upon the damage to the Republican and Democratic\nParties? I frankly don't care much about that, but I\nmight care a whole lot about damage to -- to Oklahoma's\nsystem of election.\nWhy do you allow party designations? I suppose\nit is because you want people to know that there are\ncandidates who are associated with particular political\nviews. And to allow a party to, in effect, come in and\nsay, we don't have any particular political views, we --\nwe just want to nominate, you know, whoever the most\npeople want to nominate, that just destroys the whole\npurpose of -- of your system of allowing people to run\nunder a party label. What's the use of a party label?\nMR. POE: And -- and, Your Honor, we -- we\nprovided that information and those interests to -- to the\ndistrict court. And those are interests the State has.\nIt is if a party is running as a party and if the State --\nthere -- there may be an interest in it. I'm not sure --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It -- if it's running as a\nparty, it should run somebody who -- who shares the views\nof the people in that party, which is somebody who is\nnominated by -- by the people in that party, or at least\nthose people, joined by others who are not affiliated with\nanother party. That seems to me to make a lot of sense.\nAnd it seems to me to destroy that system if --\nif you say, hey, we're -- you know, we -- we're going to\nallow the Libertarian Party to say, you know, we don't\nhave any real views. We're just going to -- we want to\nnominate somebody that most people like. So let the\nRepublicans come in, the Democrats come in. The only\nthing we want is to win. We don't really care.\nMR. POE: That -- that is the premise, of\ncourse, of the voter registration.\nAnd -- and that goes back to another -- an\nadverse effect on the State and the State's political\nsystem is this Court has recognized -- it recognized it as\nrecently as Jones and it has recognized in other cases --\nthat there is a -- a party labeling or a party\nidentification that voters use in a general election. And\nif the poaching of members have changed the -- any of\nthose party -- those messages from that party, then the\nreliance is going to be misplaced by those party members\nwhen they go. They go to vote for a Democrat. They see\nthe D or the R or the L.\nAnd more importantly, in this case we're not\ntalking just about the Libertarian Party, the effect of\nthe Libertarian Party. It could very well the effects on\nall of the political parties. In fact, that effect could\nhappen if the Democrats wanted to open theirs up and run\nthat effect on the Libertarian Party.\nAnother reason, especially that is specific to\nOklahoma, to help prevent party factionalism and party\nsplintering. In Oklahoma, when a new party is recognized,\na -- a potential candidate has the opportunity within 15\ndays of the party being recognized of changing his voter\nregistration. That can even be outside the parameters of\nsection 4-119.\nIn that instance, there is the potential and I\nthink the probability of this occurring is that -- let's\nsay there are four or five candidates who have announced\nfor the Republican nomination if they want to get their\nnomination, and one of them decides I don't want to\ncompete against those others. A new party comes in. He\nis excused from the 6-month disaffiliation requirement.\nWithin those 15 days, he can change to the Libertarian\nParty in hopes of getting that nomination, get the party\nsupport and the party structure. By that happening, you\nthen incur -- by allowing this party-option primary, you\nthen -- that would promote party splintering, party\nfactionalism. And the manner of that individual going to\nthe Libertarian Party the day of the election without any\nprior registration -- those Republicans who may have\nsupported him leave the Republican Party and start to\nchoose that. That's splintering that this Court has\nspecifically said is not only a legitimate, important\nState interest but is also a compelling State interest to\neffect.\nPoaching has the same effect as raiding. It is\na little different how it gets there, but it has the same\neffect. And raiding has been determined to be even a\ncompelling State interest in this Court.\nI would like to reserve the rest of my time.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That's fine.\nMr. Schaerr.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GENE C. SCHAERR\nON BEHALF OF SOUTH DAKOTA, ET AL.,\nAS AMICI CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMR. SCHAERR: Justice Stevens, and may it please\nthe Court:\nIn the decision below, the Tenth Circuit stuck\n-- struck down an election rule that has been adopted by\nnearly half the States pursuant to their authority under\nArticle I, section 4 to prescribe the manner of holding\nelections. In so doing, the Tenth Circuit in our view\nmade three fundamental errors that I'd like to address\nbriefly.\nThe first was the Tenth Circuit's per se\napproach to determining whether the alleged burdens here\nare severe. That's an extremely important issue, of\ncourse, because to our knowledge, this Court has never\ninvalidated a State election regulation under the First\nAmendment without first finding that the burden at issue\nwas severe. But instead of looking at that issue closely,\nthe Tenth Circuit, at page 15 of its decision, simply\nassumed that a severe burden necessarily arises from any\nregulation that, quote, restricts the options of parties\nseeking to define the scope of their associational rights.\nNow, one would have thought that it's for courts\nto determine the scope of a -- of a party's associational\nrights rather than -- than the party itself. But in all\nevents, that was the sum total of the Tenth Circuit's\nanalysis on the -- on the question of severe burden.\nNow, the respondents cite that finding, but they\n-- they make no attempt to defend that approach. They\nargue instead that the burden here is severe because, at\nbottom, Oklahoma requires a Republican or Democrat,\nwishing to vote in the LPO primary, to -- to disaffiliate\nfrom the party 2 months in advance. But that burden is no\nmore severe than others that this Court has found\nconstitutionally acceptable.\nThe burden on voters, for example, is less\nsevere than the burden this found -- this Court found\nacceptable in Rosario, which was a -- a requirement, as\nMr. Poe mentioned, that voters, wishing to vote in a -- in\na party's primary, register as a member of that party some\n8 to 11 months in advance.\nThe burden on the party is also less severe than\na burden that this Court found acceptable in Burdick which\nis that a party wishing to qualify for a primary ballot\ngather the necessary signatures, in that case 1 percent of\nthe voting population, 5 months before the primary. It's\n2 months here.\nAnd it's also similar to a burden that all the\nmembers of this Court found acceptable in Burdick, which\nwas -- which was a requirement that a candidate wishing to\nrun on a nonpartisan primary ballot collect the necessary\nsignatures about 2 months before the primary.\nAnd the message of these decisions -- and I\nthink it's fair to say the holding in Burdick -- is that\nrequiring participants in elections to take action a few\nmonths sooner or a few weeks sooner than they might prefer\ndoes not amount to a severe burden. And that's the only\nreal burden here. The LPO has to --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, I guess the one other\nconcern would be the timing in Oklahoma is such that the\n-- the Republican or Democrat who wants to disaffiliate in\norder to vote with the Libertarians has to do so at a time\nbefore the State has decided whether to allow the\nLibertarian Party on the ballot. So, you know, it\nprobably isn't burdensome to -- in principle, to have some\ndisaffiliation requirement, but does the State have to\nallow enough time so that the decision can be made with\nknowledge of whether the Libertarians are going to be on\nthe ballot?\nMR. SCHAERR: Justice O'Connor, I -- I think\nthat's really up to the party. And I -- and I think that\ngets back to my point about Burdick. Yes, there is a\ndeadline and if the LPO --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: It just seemed to me that it\nmight be more burdensome on the voter in that situation.\nMR. SCHAERR: Yes, I -- I think that's true, but\nagain, the burden on the voter depends on what the LPO\ndoes. If the LPO marshals its resources, gets -- gets its\nmessage out, determines who its candidates are going to be\nor who its potential candidates are going to be in advance\nof the filing deadline and in advance of the deadline for\nfiling a petition to become a recognized party, then the\nvoter will have ample time to make a decision. It's\nreally only if the LPO procrastinates that the voter is\nput in that position. It's not really a function of the\n-- of the State law.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Let me just ask you to look at\nthe other side of the equation. However we assess the\nburden, we're assessing it in relation to the State's\ninterest. What is your best statement of the State's\ninterest here that you think is defensible?\nMR. SCHAERR: Well, I think -- I think the\nState's interest is what the district court found it to\nbe, and I think the -- the district court actually found\ntwo interests, not just one. It found an interest in\navoiding poaching and an interest in promoting party\nloyalty along the lines that Justice Scalia mentioned\nearlier.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Do -- do you think the -- the\npoaching argument stands up on any -- any empirical basis?\nMR. SCHAERR: I do. And in fact, the -- the\ndistrict court at -- at page 49 --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: May -- let me just add quickly.\nI -- I realize, of course, there's going to be some\nmovement of voters, but do we have any idea whether the\nvoters who are moving are the ones who would otherwise\nhave stayed at home anyway and done nothing, merely\nnominal Republicans as opposed to active Republicans?\nMR. SCHAERR: Yes. We -- we do have answer to\nthat. That is implicit, first of all, in the district\ncourt's finding that poaching would, in fact, made -- make\na difference in the -- in the outcomes of the elections.\nHe -- he made that finding very clearly on -- on page\n49 --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, he found that the numbers\nare such that they could, but did he find -- and I'm not\nsure of this. Did he find that the actual people who\nmigrated would otherwise have voted differently so that in\nfact it made a difference?\nMR. SCHAERR: That is implicit in his finding.\nHe said the institution -- this is again on page 49. The\ninstitution of a party-option open primary format in\nOklahoma, as sought by the plaintiffs, would likely affect\nthe outcome of some primary elections. That -- implicit\nin that is the view that there -- there would be some\nvoting Republicans and voting Democrats that would be\nmoving to the LPO, not just the nonvoting Democrats and\nRepublicans.\nNow --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Was there a basis in the\nrecord for making that finding?\nMR. SCHAERR: Yes. Mr. Darcy's testimony, which\nI believe appears at -- at page 63 of the joint appendix,\nin that -- in that general area, anyway.\nNow, poaching -- poaching is a concern and --\nand a legitimate and important concern to the States for\nthree important reasons. I -- I might mention that in\nTashjian this Court mentioned in footnote 13 that a --\nthat an open primary could have disorganization effects on\nthe other parties, and poaching is one of those, as the\ndistrict court found. And -- and it's a concern for three\nindependent reasons.\nFirst of all, the State has an interest in\npreventing poaching because that helps protect parties\nfrom spurned candidate candidacies which was one of the --\nthe Court in Tashjian identified Storer and Rosario as\nexamples of that. And -- and the -- the semi-closed\nprimary protects parties against that. For example, if a\ncandidate for the Democratic nomination felt that she\nwasn't getting enough support from the party leadership\nbefore the primary, she might form or join another party\nand then try to take -- take her supporters with her into\nthat other party. And although Oklahoma allows the\ncandidate to switch parties in that circumstance, the --\nthe semi-closed primary and the 7-week period or 7- or 8-\nweek period, standoff period, if you will -- that period\nprotects the party from having its voters poached as a\nresult of a -- of a spurned candidate joining another\nparty.\nThe second reason that poaching is a significant\nconcern is that -- is that it can lead to efforts,\nstrategic efforts by -- by other parties to influence the\noutcome of another party's primary. For example, suppose\nwe're in California in 2002 a few days before the\ngubernatorial primaries there. The Democrats have already\ndecided that their incumbent, Governor Davis, will be\nnominated, so they're looking ahead to the general\nelection. And they see two possible Republican\ncandidates, Reardon and Simon, to pull two names out of a\nhat. And they conclude that -- that they have a better\nchance of beating Simon than they have of beating Reardon.\nWell, what can they do to affect the -- the outcome of the\nRepublican race?\nOne possibility, if the Republican primary is\nopen, is to raid it by having some Democrat switch\nregistration and go vote for Simon. And of course, the\nCourt has said repeatedly that States have an important\ninterest in -- in preventing that kind of behavior.\nThe other possibility is for the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And that's not permitted in\nOklahoma, is it? That kind of behavior is not permitted\nin Oklahoma.\nMR. SCHAERR: That's correct.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMR. SCHAERR: That's correct.\nAnd the other possibility, though, is for the\nDemocrats to open their primary and to lure some of the --\nsome of the Reardon voters out of the Republican primary\nthrough targeted advertising or direct appeals from the\ncandidate or something like that.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, neither of the major\nparties has done that in Oklahoma, has it?\nMR. SCHAERR: Not that I'm aware of, but -- but\nit is -- but it is a plausible concern that a legislature\nwould have. And as Justice Scalia said, these --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But the question is whether\nwhen a minor party like the Libertarians do it, is -- is\nit going to have that effect.\nMR. SCHAERR: Well, there -- there's another\nscenario for -- in the California example, for example.\nTake -- assume that the Democrats, instead of opening up\ntheir own primary to Republicans, they strike a deal with\nthe Green Party such that the Green Party makes an effort\nto peel off the Reardon voters out of the Republican\nprimary voting pool in California. That --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But the cost of that deal\nwould -- they'd also run the risk the Democrats would --\nwould migrate also if they made that deal.\nMR. SCHAERR: It depends on how they ran -- ran\nthe campaign.\nIn all events, it's a -- it's a plausible\nscenario and -- and one that the State is entitled to\nrespond to before it -- before it actually happens.\nNow, the -- the third reason that poaching is a\nproblem is that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I apologize for taking your\ntime with a question, but I'm afraid your time is up.\nMR. SCHAERR: Thank you.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMr. Linger.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES C. LINGER\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. LINGER: Justice Stevens, may it please the\nCourt:\nThe integrity of a political party should be\ndefined by the political party and not by the State.\nThe State interest that they have asserted here\nand alleged is to prevent against draining, and draining\nthe State has defined as the inverse of raiding. Now,\nraiding, of course, is the State preventing and keeping\nout of a political party disloyal voters of another party\ncoming in for a purpose to hurt that party. Now, if\ndraining is inverse raiding, then the State is saying that\nit has an interest in keeping in to a political party\ndisloyal voters. So the State is asserting and is at\ncross purposes that it has an interest to both keep out\ndisloyal voters from a political party's primary and at\nthe same time keep in disloyal voters.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why is that inconsistent?\nBecause I mean, you're -- you're basically advocating that\nthe Constitution requires Alaska's rule, and I thought\nthat -- we got briefs on that, I think, in -- in the\nprevious case and a lot of other parties thought Alaska's\nrule was not a wise rule, though that's up to Alaska. But\nto think that the Constitution requires that is\nsurprising.\nThe interest they assert is just the one you\nsaid --\nMR. LINGER: And --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- that the Republicans, in\norder to have their party work, have to be able to plan a\ncampaign for a stable group of voters. They have to know,\nroughly, who is in their party, let's say, a week before\nor 2 weeks before, some period of time before. And that's\nthe interest that Oklahoma is asserting. It has nothing\nto do with you. It has do with -- and it has zero to do\nwith you if you had a rule for minor parties, frankly.\nBut if you can't get a rule for minor parties, special,\nthen you have to take it seriously I think.\nMR. LINGER: Most States --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What's your answer? What do\nyou respond --\nMR. LINGER: Justice Breyer, most States have a\nrule for minor parties. They don't treat, like Oklahoma\ndoes, you're either a party or you're a nothing.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The States do but to say that\nthe Constitution -- and I'm asking. You see, I'm not --\nbut I -- if I could figure out how in the Constitution you\nhad a special rule for minor parties, the interest that\nthey're asserting has very little to do with it. But I\ndon't see how you can have a constitutional rule that\nwould forbid -- allow you to open and drain, but wouldn't\nallow the Dems to do the same as they've done in Alaska.\nMR. LINGER: I think in -- in Alaska, of course,\nright now there is a party option where all the parties\nbut the Republicans have opened the primary. They have a\nblanket primary. The Republicans haven't and the\nRepublicans, of course, in Alaska happen to be the\ndominant party. There seems to be a pattern in these\ncases --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, because they say -- what\nthey're thinking, I take it -- I don't know what they're\nreally thinking, but I imagine they could be thinking, no,\nwe don't want to open our primary. We'll run the risk\nthat our voters go over and vote for the Dems and like it\nthere and stay. We'll run that risk, but we don't want\nthem coming and raiding us. We think that's the bigger\nrisk.\nMR. LINGER: And -- and that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And how can the Constitution\ntell them that they can't make that judgment? That's\nwhat's bothering me.\nMR. LINGER: I don't think the -- I think the\nConstitution -- and the Court has recognized that it is\nlegitimate to protect against raiding because we can all\nsuppose how disloyal voters coming into a party could hurt\nit. But how about disloyal voters leaving a party?\nBecause these voters that would come in and vote in the\nLibertarian --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Go back to my interest, the one\nI asserted --\nMR. LINGER: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- which isn't that. It is the\ninterest in the Republican Party in Alaska saying to\nitself we do not want our voters to go leave and vote for\nthe Democrats because we want a stable body of people 3 or\n4 weeks before the election for whom we can plan. We\ndon't want to open ours because we don't want the raiding.\nWe want to keep --\nMR. LINGER: And, Justice Breyer, that sort of\nFirst Amendment view of your voters shows that the party\nthinks that they own the voters. We hear this language\nwhere the party is contributing voters or they're being\npoached or it's a donor party. That shows a certain view\nof the party and what they --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. It's not an ownership,\nbut you have a period of time. So you focus on the period\nof time. They're saying, of course, up to X period of\ntime, they take their choice. Is this a fake thing, a\nfake reason, the need to have a stable group of people for\nwhom you plan your campaigns? Now, is that a hoax or is\nit flimsy or is it serious? What do you think?\nMR. LINGER: I -- I think it is flimsy and I'll\ntell you why because I think paternalistically the State\nof Oklahoma is way off or the Republican Party, if they\nthought that way in Alaska, would be off. If you really\nthink about it, a party, particularly at the general\nelection, wants its loyal voters to get to the poll.\nActually this would be a benefit to the Republican and\nDemocratic Parties in Oklahoma or the Republican Party in\nAlaska because it allow them to find out which of their\nvoters had voted in their primary and which had defected\nto another party. When they're sending out mailers or\ndoing phone banks or driving people to the polls, they're\ngoing to want to take their loyal voters. So this will\nactually serve to help them to identify some of their\nvoters who aren't loyal, and they won't want to bring them\nin. So I'm saying that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The -- the State -- the State\nof Oklahoma doesn't want your party raided. And -- and\nyou say we don't care if we're raided. Come raid us. All\nwe want to do is win. It seems to me it -- it -- you\ncannot apply the -- the maxim, volenti non fit injuria.\nOklahoma is saying to your party, you can't\nwelcome raiding. We don't want your party to be raided\nwhether you like it or not because that's what a party\nsystem is. We've set up these elections that -- that have\nparty primaries and party systems on the assumption that\neach party is going to have a certain -- a certain belief,\na certain philosophy, and to allow your candidate to be\nelected by everybody simply destroys that system. Why is\nthat -- why is that so unreasonable that it's\nunconstitutional?\nMR. LINGER: Because it's -- it's not practical\non what happens. As Justice O'Connor pointed out in her\nquestions, there is such a limited time. The\nLibertarians, as shown in the record in this case, have\nnever and continually do not have the time to build up a\nvoter pool. They have their supporters spread out among a\nnumber of political affiliations because there's such a\nlittle amount of time that you can register as a\nLibertarian, unlike the vast majority of States.\nI don't think anyone has ever accused the\nLibertarian Party of not having a set philosophy on what\nthey stand for.\nBut the fact of the matter, this Court itself\nhas expressed skepticism about whether even party raiding\never exists. People don't go out generally to vote\nbecause they want to pick someone who's a bad candidate.\nThey want to vote for someone they feel proud of who\nexpresses their views. The people that the Libertarians\nwould appeal to would be Republicans and Democrats who\neither weren't going to vote in their primary or those who\nwere very Libertarian oriented or people who would be\nLibertarians if they had more opportunity under the law to\nregister as Libertarians. They're, in effect, marooned --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Weren't those --\nMR. LINGER: -- over these other affiliations.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- weren't those who would like\nto nominate the Libertarian candidate who would attract\nthe most people from the other large party? Right?\nMR. LINGER: Who would they attract? They would\nattract Libertarian-oriented people who would be drawn by\ntheir philosophy because the Libertarian Party, as with\nmost minor parties, is an ideological party. They take\npositions oftentimes ignored by the major parties, and\nthat is one of the reasons that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, but -- but the candidate\nmostly to attract people from one of the major parties is\nthe candidate that is -- is more likely to water down the\npure Libertarian message and be closer to the message of\nthe Democratic Party or the Republican Party. And --\nand --\nMR. LINGER: If you can tell --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- people who come into your\nprimary may want to elect such a candidate so that the\nLibertarian Party will be strengthened and draw votes away\nfrom the other majority --\nMR. LINGER: Of course, this Court, I think, has\nrecognized that raiding is not a legitimate concern for\nthe State that overcomes a party that would open up. And\nthat's what the district court so held. We go into the\ninverse of draining and talk about the effect it would\nhave on the Republicans and Democratic Parties. I think\nthe -- the district court said several times in its\nopinion that the results would be highly speculative. But\nI say that the results would probably be to the benefit\nbecause it would ensure major parties that they got a\nnominee who was picked by loyal supporters of the party,\nand what would be drained off would be disloyal supporters\nwho would rather be doing something else.\nAnd that, of course, is the essence of\ncompetition. We should not be worrying about protecting\nthe major parties from competition for ideals. This is --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do I understand your brief to\nsay that this constitutional rule that you are seeking\nwould be just for the minority party? I think you said in\nyour brief it doesn't follow like the night the day that\nbecause the Libertarians must be allowed to do this by the\nConstitution, therefore the Democrats and Republicans must\nalso have the option to invite anyone into their\nprimaries.\nMR. LINGER: The finding of the Tenth Circuit\nwas, of course, that it applied to these plaintiffs under\nthese particular facts. And I think that's one thing to\nremember, how cautious and conservative this Court and the\nFirst Circuit in Cool Moose were. They didn't make a\nbroad-based rule, and I don't interpret this decision and\nI don't interpret the teaching of this Court in footnote\n13 in Tashjian is that we should come down and make some\nbright line rule that's always going to say we have to\nhave a party-option open primary or not. We need to look\nat the factors. I think there are very few States that\nthis would even apply to because, as we know, 21 States\ndon't even have political primary registration.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What facts? We -- we have to\nevaluate it on the basis of each election? What is a\nState legislator supposed to do when he votes for a -- an\nelection system? He's going to flip a coin trying to\nfigure out what the fact situation will be when this --\nwhen this system finally gets before a court? Surely that\n-- that can't be the test.\nMR. LINGER: I do -- I do ask that the State\nlegislatures think about what they're doing. And as I\ndemonstrated --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But you -- you want them\nto think and you want to leave the door open to their\nmaking a distinction for these purposes between the major\nparties and the minor parties, and I can't think of\nanything more intrusive into the political process than\nthat. Coming from a Libertarian, I -- I get a sense that\nI must misunderstand you, but I don't know where it is.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. LINGER: I'm saying that I -- I don't -- I\ndon't think courts should ever go out and look for cases\nin advance. We look at the case that is --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but we are -- we have got\nto look around the corner.\nMR. LINGER: -- about the effects.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And -- and if you're issuing\nthe invitation to come up with a different rule for\nRepublicans and Democrats and Libertarians, I think you're\nasking for trouble and we would be asking for trouble if\nwe accepted that invitation.\nMR. LINGER: No. I'm -- and as I said before, I\nthink the political party should be the one that defines\nits integrity --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then -- then if you say that --\nI want you to just respond in detail to the questions that\nI think Justice Scalia and Justice Souter were asking, as\nI understand it, putting it dramatically, that if you win\nthis case, Alaska's system becomes the Constitution of the\nUnited States. Now, that I know you think is not so, and\nI want to know why.\nMR. LINGER: Because, number one, first, let's\neliminate the 21 States that do not have political party\nregistration. They would not -- in fact, the -- the\nproblem that we're worried about here, draining, and --\nand the problem is going to happen simply because people\nin those States, like President Bush's Texas, are free\nfrom election to election to go to any primary they\nwant to --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's the same as election\nsystem -- that's the same as Alaska's system. Right? I\nmean, it boils down to the same thing. It boils down to\nan open primary, doesn't it?\nMR. LINGER: Justice Scalia, I respectfully\ndisagree because Alaska, unlike Texas, has political party\nregistration. Also, they have a party option. And most\nStates that have political party registration, in fact,\nhave a sort of two-tier system where they recognize it\nwould be discriminatory to treat major parties and small\npolitical parties the same. Most of them like, for\nexample, the amici States here of New Mexico, Maryland,\nthey have political conventions for their -- they\nrecognize that that is something that shouldn't be applied\nto the smaller parties.\nBut Oklahoma, of course, mandates primaries.\nThe Libertarians of Oklahoma are forced to have primaries.\nThey're forced to live under what is the most restrictive\nballot access and ballot retention laws, which limits the\namount of time they could be on the ballot.\nThe voter registration laws, as was cited in the\nrecord of this case, as the trial judge found, of the 29\nStates that have political party registration, essentially\n26 of them have -- they have free and open registration.\nThere are very few that limit things across the board like\nOklahoma does, and that's what makes this case unique.\nAnd I think the footnote 13 in Tashjian talked\nabout looking at the particular facts and circumstances.\nI think this case gives the Court an opportunity to fully\nexpand on that footnote, the full footnote, of course, as\nI cited in the brief for the respondents, and that is to\nsay that all these are factors when you're analyzing any\nState. Is -- does it have political party registration?\nDoes it mandate primaries for even the little parties?\nHow much time is available to change your registration as\nnew parties come up?\nThe New -- State of New Hampshire, of course,\nhas found a way to deal with this problem, which Oklahoma\nhasn't, which is that they allow new parties that are just\nrecognized. Where many voters didn't have the opportunity\nto register in that party, they have an open primary.\nThat's one way to deal with it.\nBut the point is Oklahoma didn't even think\nabout that. As we pointed out in our brief, the sore\nloser provision where you have to be affiliated with a\nparty for 6 months -- the legislature -- when the first\ntime the Libertarians got on the ballot 25 years ago, they\ndidn't even realize that there was no way you could be\naffiliated with a party for 6 months because you couldn't\nregister with it.\nAnd the law and the workings of all these\nregistration laws in Oklahoma, because they are so\nrestrictive, prevent the Libertarian Party to get in the\nposition that the major parties have because they simply\ncan't get their people registered and stay registered with\nthe Libertarian Party because they're constantly being\npurged and they're -- the people are frustrated.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Would there be a way --\nsuppose, for hypothetical purposes, the Court were to say\n-- you got a ruling that said there is no rule in the\nConstitution that forbids a State, as a general matter, to\nforbid this cross registration, this jumping, for a\nreasonable time. But a reasonable time has to take into\naccount the interests of minor as well as major parties.\nNow are you foreclosed because of the circumstances of\nthis case from litigating whether 8 weeks is a reasonable\ntime and whether the disjunct between the period where you\nbecome a party and that 8 weeks is unreasonable in the\ncircumstances or other specific things that you say work\nto the disadvantage of the Libertarians?\nMR. LINGER: I think that's something\nreasonable, but in this case it is unreasonable because\nyou simply don't have the opportunity to register.\nRemember this --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought your case was you\nwant to appeal to people who don't want to register as\nLibertarians and don't even want to be independent. You\nwant to appeal to people who are and want to be members of\nthe Republican or Democratic Party but have Libertarian\nleanings, but they don't want to give up their party\naffiliation.\nMR. LINGER: That -- that is part of the appeal.\nThere are obviously some people simply because of family\ntradition or it may help them with their job or because\nthe Libertarians are controversial, some people may want\nto keep it quiet and don't formally affiliate other than\nthey might wish to vote. But our appeal and request was\nnot simply those people but to many people, the vast\nmajority of Oklahomans who never vote --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The last category could --\ncould register as independents. I mean, if they're\nashamed of -- of the L word, they -- they could just\nregister as independents. Right?\nMR. LINGER: A person can do that, yes. And, of\ncourse, independents are growing. I think, as you know --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but that you could do\nright now, and you say that's not enough. We want people\nwho are members of other parties and don't want to change\ntheir party affiliation.\nMR. LINGER: We would like -- first, when you\nhave competition in ideals and in politics, it's always a\ncontinuing process, and they're hoping to win all these\npeople over. They don't want these people to stay in\nother political parties, but they are opening it up\nbecause they have such a limited period of time in\nOklahoma when people can formally affiliate with the\nLibertarian Party or, for that matter, any newly\nrecognized party.\nThink of it this way. When counsel was talking\nabout the Rosario case where you -- the -- the State was\nallowed to have 8 to 11 months and the Court found that\nwas acceptable to change your registration or the older\ncase of Kusper v. Pontikes where the Court found that 23\nmonths in -- in advance to change your affiliation was too\nmuch, in Oklahoma, whether it's 23 months before the newly\naffiliate party gets recognized or 8 to 11 months, you\ncan't register with that party. So if it was unreasonable\nin Kusper v. Pontikes but was reasonable in Rosario, the\npoint is under either of those time periods, in Oklahoma\nyou can't register with a newly recognized political\nparty. So how can that be reasonable?\nThe Libertarians do not have the opportunity.\nNewly recognized parties under Oklahoma law do not have\nthe opportunity to get their people in in time, to the\nextent they could, as demonstrated in the record by States\nof similar population like Kansas and Arizona and, as I\nnoted in the brief, Oregon where there are substantially\nmore --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What did -- what did you seek\nin this action? What did you seek in this action? Did --\ndid you seek just more time to -- to register? I -- I\nthought you -- you sought to overturn the -- the system\nentirely and -- I mean, maybe you asked for too much.\nMR. LINGER: As -- as to the Libertarians, we\nasked that we have a party-option open primary, which I\nthink is acceptable, and it's what New Hampshire does.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So more -- more time might be\n-- might be a good idea, but that wouldn't satisfy your --\nyour complaint here.\nMR. LINGER: If you go -- if you go --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Your -- your complaint is no\nmatter how much time you're given --\nMR. LINGER: The -- the legislature -- if -- if\nthe law is overturned and the Tenth Circuit is affirmed,\nthe legislature might go back in then and address the\nproblem and they might come up with some solution as they\ndid back in 1980 when it became apparent to them that they\nhad set up a system where Libertarian candidates couldn't\nbe candidates for State office because they couldn't be\naffiliated with a party with 6 -- for 6 months. They made\nthe change that is set forth in the statute that allows 15\ndays after the party is recognized.\nIt might very well be that a possibility the\nlegislature could pursue that could solve this problem, a\nproblem created by the State of Oklahoma, would be to\nallow a period of time after a party is recognized for\nvoters, not just candidates, but for people who just want\nto vote in the primary to change. That might be one\nsolution.\nOr it might be, as in the State of New\nHampshire, where they allow that if it's a newly\nrecognized party and we recognize that all these people in\nthe State never had the opportunity to register in this\nparty, then they will have an open primary there.\nSo I don't think there's one solution for this\nproblem, and I think when the law, hopefully, is held to\nbe unconstitutional as it applies to Libertarians, then\nthe Oklahoma legislature can come in and perhaps remedy\nthe situation then.\nNow, this -- this case is one in which there are\nsome other factors that have to be considered, and that is\nthe importance that is put on First Amendment rights to\npolitical association. The State of Oklahoma, contrary to\nthe brief of the petitioners, has not been overburdened\nwith minor political parties. It is a State in which only\nin presidential elections, by petitioning, have parties\neven been able to gain ballot status.\nThe State has also a very severe -- the trial\njudge in this case found that the retention requirement of\n10 percent for every general election for the top of the\nticket was very difficult. The finding was that the\nregistration here was among -- very limited and among the\nmost difficult.\nAnd finally, the State has imposed, I think\nunwisely, primaries on these small political parties.\nBut other than the Libertarians and the Reform\nParty, there have been no other minor parties on the\nOklahoma ballot. In this situation, we have to say to\nourselves, as the trial judge in fact commented on, is\nwhether or not the law is simply the result of the\nconcerns of the major parties. I do not think that the\nState legislature in Oklahoma went out of its way to try\nto interfere with the rights of Libertarians. I just\nthink that they never really considered them, and that is\nwhy this Court has said on a number of occasions that when\nthe rights of independent voters and small parties are\nimpacted by legislation, that this Court should exercise\nmore strict and careful scrutiny there because --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But how does that square with\nTimmons where this Court turned away a party that says,\nwe've got this candidate and she's running on a major\nparty ticket and she's happy to be on ours too? And the\nCourt there said the State can legitimately eliminate --\nlimit the candidate to one party affiliation. So if it\ncan limit the candidate to one party affiliation, why not\nthe voter?\nMR. LINGER: Because that was a candidacy right,\nwhat the candidate was going to do, and in that particular\ncase, this Court noted that the candidate of the\nDemocratic-Farmer-Labor Party had a choice. That\ncandidate could have chosen to be the candidate of the\nnew party or that he could stay, as he did, with the\nDemocratic-Farmer-Labor Party.\nWe don't have the choice here. They wanted to\nhave him be the candidate of both parties at the same\ntime. We recognize that the State may properly limit each\nvoter to a single nominating act, to a single vote, and\nwe're not asking that. We're not asking that the State\nnot be allowed to set reasonable times to let them know\nabout what we're going to do.\nBut in Timmons -- and I think Timmons is what\nled the district court astray here was what was not\nrecognized was that there was a choice allowed in Timmons,\nand there's not a choice here. If -- if this had been in\nOklahoma, in -- in that regard, there would have been no\nway for -- there's no way for a voter who's in the\nRepublican or Democratic Parties who wants to vote in the\nLibertarian Party because of the unreasonable deadlines to\nchange and because of the lack of opportunity, there's no\nway that they can register. So they don't have the choice\nto register as a Libertarian, as the candidate of the\nDemocratic-Farmer-Labor Party did in Timmons, to change if\nhe wanted to. He chose to stay in the major party. But\nthat is one significant difference with Timmons.\nAnd also, of course, I couldn't -- I would also\nwant to mention that Minnesota is a State that has no\npolitical party registration. So once again, the problem\nand issues we're confronted with here could not occur in\nMinnesota. But I think that's significant.\nAnd there was -- there was nothing on any voter\nthat would have kept them from being able to vote for that\nparticular candidate in the general election. They were\ngoing to be -- he was going to be on the ballot in the\ngeneral election. In this case, the voters that don't\nhave the choice that that candidate did in Timmons, they\nare not going to be able to express their opinion on a\nparty that they would like to express an opinion in -- in\ntheir primary. And I think that is a very important\ndistinction.\nI think that oftentimes in the standard that the\ncourt uses, that there is a difference, sometimes\ndepending on which particular judge writes the decision on\nhow a standard is explained. But in this case, it is, as\nthe Tenth Circuit said and as the district court\nrecognized, something that lies between this Court's\ndecision in Tashjian and this Court's decision in\nCalifornia Democratic Party v. Jones. But in both those\ncases, the Court recognized and called for exacting\nscrutiny when a law was impacting a party's choice as to\nhow it wishes to choose its nominees. I do not think that\nthe rationale come up by the State, this thing about\ndraining, taking -- keeping the disloyal voters in the\nRepublican and Democratic Party and not letting them come\nover, whether they wouldn't have voted at all, or whether\nthey didn't have the chance to register as Libertarians,\nor whether they simply are inspired by the particular\ncandidates, I don't think in that situation that that is\neither a compelling interest by the State and I certainly\ndon't think it is rational. And in fact, as far as being\npaternalistic, I think the State is totally wrong there\nbecause I think this would actually benefit the major\nparties.\nBut I am saying to you that this is limited,\nunder the Tenth Circuit's decision, to the facts in\nOklahoma. And in other States, what the States can say\nthere, if it comes up, is what is a difference between us\nand Oklahoma on ballot access and ballot retention, on\nvoter registration laws, on requirements. Do we allow,\nlike a number of the amici States, to have our minor\nparties select by political party convention? But all of\nthis --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What are the mici States? You\nsaid this a couple -- what are mici States? Mici States\ndid you say?\nMR. LINGER: The amici, amicus --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, the --\nMR. LINGER: -- amici.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. I thought you were\nsaying mici.\nMR. LINGER: Amici. Okay.\nIn any event, we ask that the Court, when it\nfully considers this, under the particular facts and\ncircumstances in this case and the record, that the Court\nwill affirm the decision of the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Tenth Circuit.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Linger.\nMr. Poe, you have about 3 minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WELLON B. POE, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. POE: I will try and be brief, Your Honor.\nThe important thing to remember, in regards to\nmost of respondents' argument today and in their brief, is\nthat the events and the hurdles they are challenging now\nwere -- have never been raised at any time prior to this\nbriefing and this hearing. The district court did not\nmake findings as to the difficulty of the ballot access or\nthe ballot qualifications. He merely set forth what those\nwere. The Tenth Circuit never even addressed anything in\nregards to ballot access or ballot qualifications and in\nrelation to the need to open up a primary. And in the\ncomplaint, at the joint appendix page 22, the specific\nrelief sought by the respondents is to have section 1-\n104, which is the semi-closed primary section -- have it\ndeclared unconstitutional. There's no mention of any\nother relief sought. No other section, the election\nprimary scheme, or anything else mentioned in their\ncomplaint. It's never been raised before and it's never\nbeen addressed by any court and -- and should not be\naddressed by this Court at this point in time. There are\nno findings for this Court to rely on to review the\nallegations that have been made today.\nWhere the district court -- or where the Tenth\nCircuit did error specifically is they found, as a matter of\nfact or as a matter of law, based on Jones and Tashjian,\nthat any infringement upon a party's ability to associate\nis a compelling -- must -- is subject to strict scrutiny\nand requires a compelling State interest. Jones\nspecifically says that is not the case. Tashjian implies\nthat that is not the case. And the cases since Tashjian's\ntime say a compelling State interest is not always the\nappropriate test. You look to the injury and then you\nlook to the burdens.\nIn this case, the appropriate burden -- or the\nappropriate injury is not severe. They are reasonable\nrestrictions placed on Oklahoma to maintain the integrity\nof its political system and its election system. With\nthat, the restrictions on -- in the Oklahoma statutes are\nreasonable restrictions that govern and control and\nsupport important State interests.\nFor that reason, the Tenth Circuit was\nincorrect. The district court was correct in its\nanalysis, and we would ask that this Court reverse that\ndecision and find that those statutes are constitutional.\nThank you.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Poe.\n"
