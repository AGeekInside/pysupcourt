VERRILLI, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. VERRILLI: Mr. Chief Justice and may it\nplease the Court:\nKentucky's lethal injection procedures pose\na danger of cruelly inhumane executions. If the first\ndrug in the three-drug sequence, the anesthetic\nthiopental, is not effectively administered to the\nexecuted inmate, then the second drug, pancuronium, will\ninduce a terrifying conscious paralysis and suffocation\nand the third drug, potassium chloride, will inflict an\nexcruciating burning pain as it courses through the\nveins.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Verrilli, your\nargument is based on improper administration of the\nprotocol. You agree that if the protocol is properly\nfollowed there is no risk of pain?\nMR. VERRILLI: I disagree with that\nrespectfully, Mr. Chief Justice. The protocol simply\ndoes not address several key steps where risks can arise\nand, beyond that, the protocol's -- and I think this is\ncritically important -- the protocol's procedures for\nmonitoring to assure that the inmate is adequately\nanesthetized are practically nonexistent.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought your\nexpert -- I'm looking at page 493 to 494 of the joint\nappendix -- agreed that if the two grams of sodium\npentothal is properly administered, the way he put it,\nin virtually every case there would be a humane death.\nMR. VERRILLI: That is true, but there can\nbe no guarantee that it will be properly administered\nand that is because even in clinical settings there are\nalways -- there is always the potential for difficulty\nwhich manifests itself in actual problems, for example\nin the setting of an IV.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if it were properly\nadministered, would you have a case here? Let's assume\n100 percent of cases are properly administered.\nMR. VERRILLI: If there were a way to\nguarantee that the procedure worked every time, then we\nwouldn't have substantial risk.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, my question --\nMR. VERRILLI: But --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Let's assume\nhypothetically, and we know this isn't true, that 100\npercent of the time it's properly administered. Then do\nyou have an argument to present to the Court?\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, if the \"if\" is, I\napologize for this, but for clarity -- the \"if\" is that\n100 percent of the time the dose of anesthetic is\nproperly administered into the condemned inmate, then we\ndon't have a significant risk. Of course that is not\nwhat the record in this case establishes. The record\nestablishes the contrary. There is -- you cannot assure\nthat there is going to be a guarantee of -- of\nsuccessful administration of the anesthetic. And that\nis why the monitoring part of the process is so\ncritical.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But would you -- would\nthe monitoring suffice? In other words, you started out\nby saying there is no way that it could be administered\nand assure 100 percent against risk, so it would be\nhelpful if you clarified: Yes, there is a way of\nmonitoring adequately and tell us what that would be, or\nno, there is no way.\nMR. VERRILLI: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. I\nthink we have tried to suggest in our brief that there\nis a way to monitor effectively even with the three-drug\nprotocol. It's challenging. The key component of that\nis that one needs a person trained in monitoring\nanesthetic death to participate in the process.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Who would be a medical\ndoctor -- and medical doctors, according to the Code of\nEthics of the American Medical Association, can't\nparticipate.\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, Your Honor, of course,\nthat's why there is another practical alternative here,\nwhich solves that problem, which is the single dose of\nbarbituate, which does not require the participation of\na medically trained professional.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, that seems to be a big\npart your argument, but it doesn't appear that that\nargument was raised at all in the Kentucky courts, and\nit seems that there is virtually nothing in the record\nof this case that shows that that's practical or that\nit's preferable to the three-drug protocol. It may well\nbe, but without anything in the record of this case, how\ncould we hold that the three drug protocol is\nunconstitutional?\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, if I may Justice Alito,\nI do think and I'd like to provide the references where\nit is raised and then the evidentiary references that\nsupport the argument --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Where was it raised? The\ncitations in the brief that was submitted by your\nco-counsel are inaccurate to show that it was raised in\nthe Kentucky courts.\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, at page 684 of the\njoint appendix, the -- this is the trial brief, the\nbrief raised in the trial court -- one assertion made\nthere is that an alternative chemical or combination of\nchemicals that poses less risk of unnecessary pain and\nsuffering during an execution is --\nJUSTICE ALITO: No, that's -- that's the\ntrial court, and you think that just the word an\n\"alternative chemical poses less risk\" is sufficient to\nraise the argument that the three-drug protocol is\nunconstitutional, because a single drug protocol\ninvolving thiopental is preferable. That one word?\nMR. VERRILLI: And then -- and then, no.\nAnd then later, on page 701, the brief argues that there\nare nonpainful ways of stopping the heart.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What are they? That is, I\nwas -- I can't find -- what should I read? Because I've\nread the studies. I've read that Lancet study, which\nseemed to me the only referee for it said it wasn't any\ngood. And I've read the Zimmer study and I found in\nthere an amazing sentence to me which says that The\nNetherlands Information Task Force concluded it is not\npossible to administer so much of it that a lethal\neffect is guaranteed. They're talking about thiopental.\nSo I'm left at sea. I understand your contention. You\nclaim that this is somehow more painful than some other\nmethod. But which? And what's the evidence for that?\nWhat do I read to find it?\nMR. VERRILLI: The thiopental is a\nbarbiturate and by definition will inflict death\npainlessly. The record in this case establishes -- each\nexpert, the Petitioner s expert and Respondents' expert,\ntestified that it is guaranteed at the three gram dose\nto cause death.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But that's what they're --\nthey're giving a three gram dose, I take it, and if --\nor two grams or three grams; I thought it was three\ngrams here. And I ended up thinking of course there is\na risk of human error. There is a risk of human error\ngenerally where you're talking about the death penalty,\nand this may be one extra problem, one serious\nadditional problem. But the question here is can we say\nthat there is a more serious problem here than with\nother execution methods? I've read the studies. What\nelse should I read?\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, I think the record\nreferences, which I think the record pretty clearly\nestablishes, Your Honor, that death is certain to occur\nthrough the use of thiopental at the three gram dose.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What do we do with the\neuthanasia -- instead of talking -- I looked; I found it\nmore important to look at what they do with euthanasia\nthan to look at what they do with animals, frankly, and\nI was therefore taken aback with the sentence I just\nread to you. What am I supposed to do about that?\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, I think to refer\ninstead to the expert testimony in this case which says\nthat death is certain to occur, and in addition, that\nmedical testimony in this case that it is certain to\noccur in a very few minutes. Those are the transcript\nreferences that we provided at page 18 of the reply\nbrief.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That method has\nnever been tried, correct.\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, it has never been tried\non humans. That is correct. It is --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do we know whether\nthere are risks of pain accompanying that method?\nMR. VERRILLI: I think you do, Mr. Chief\nJustice, because by definition, barbituates cannot\ninflict pain and do not inflict pain.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The record\nestablishes that the second drug that's used here is\nused to prevent involuntary muscle contractions. That\nwould not be -- there wouldn't be a safeguard against\nthat under one drug protocol, I take it.\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, yes there would,\nMr. Chief Justice, because the reality is that\nthiopental and other barbituates are anti-convulsives.\nTheir point is to -- among other things to suppress any\ninvoluntary muscle --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can you -- do you\nagree that that is an appropriate problem to be\naddressed by the execution protocol, that they should\ntry to reduce the likelihood of involuntary muscle\ncontractions?\nMR. VERRILLI: No, because to the extent\nthat the reason that they are offering to do it, is\nbecause of the potential for discomfort that it may\ncause the audience given the risk that the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think that their\n-- one of their reasons was that it would enhance the\ndignity, not only of the procedure as a whole, but also\nto the condemned.\nMR. VERRILLI: I understand that, Mr. Chief\nJustice, but given the extent to which it increases the\nrisk that there can be ineffective anesthesia, and it\ncan go undetected, it doesn't seem to us to be an\nargument of sufficient force to justify using it despite\nthat risk particularly when it seems to us that the\nissue of dignity can be addressed by communication with\nthe audience.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What do we do with\nthe -- if you prevail here, and the next case is brought\nby someone subject to the single drug protocol and their\nclaim is: Look this has never been tried. We do know\nthat there's a chance that it would cause muscle\ncontractions that would make my death undignified. It\nwill certainly extend how long it takes to die, so I'm\nsubject to a lingering death and the more humane\nprotocol would be the three drug protocol?\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, I think with respect to\nthe lingering death point, I think it would, this\nCourt's cases are talking about is the consciousness of\nlingering death and the torture that that imposes, which\nyou wouldn't have of course in this situation. I don't\nthink there is a credible argument that the use of a\nbarbituate alone could inflict pain. They do not\ninflict any pain. Now, of course there are\npossibilities of maladministration, but not\nmaladministration of a one drug protocol that results in\nany pain, and therefore there is just not a credible\nEight Amendment argument. It seems to me that it\ncouldn't be cruel and unusual punishment, because there\nis no pain.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Verrilli, I think\nthat your main argument in this case, I mean, there's --\nbarbituate only seems to have come up rather late in the\nday, as Justice Alito pointed out, but your main\narguments seem to be that the controls were inadequate.\nSo you were beginning to say what controls would be\nnecessary to render this procedure constitutional, and\none that you said -- trained personnel to monitor the\nflow.\nMR. VERRILLI: The monitor for anesthetic.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.\nMR. VERRILLI: To ensure that anesthetic\ndepth has been achieved and maintained.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And what is --\nMR. VERRILLI: That is correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Two questions: Who would\nthe trained personnel be? And, the second question,\nwhat would be the measures that they would employ?\nMR. VERRILLI: The trained personnel could\nbe a physician, a nurse or anyone trained by them\nadequately in this process.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, what do we do about\nthe point -- the point that the doctors or the nurses\nsay it's unethical to help with an execution? I mean,\nif we are going to talk about the constitutionality of\nthe death penalty per se, that isn't raised in this\ncase. And what the other side says is, well, you're\njust trying to do this by the back door, insist upon a\nprocedure that can't be used.\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, I think the one point\nof the one-drug protocol, of course, is to demonstrate\nthat we are not doing that. Beyond that, it seems to me\nthat the State can't have it both ways with respect to\nthe -- the issue of the participation of medically\ntrained personnel. On the one hand, they cannot say\nthat we have qualified medically able personnel\nparticipating in this process and that's our guarantee\nof its efficacy, and on the other hand say a requirement\nof having trained qualified personnel participate is\nimpossible. And they do say that. For example the EMTs\nthat participate in Kentucky are under the same ethical\nset of issues as doctors are.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Could you use those EMTs?\nWould they be qualified? Would the team that inserts\nthe IV, would that team be qualified?\nMR. VERRILLI: With additional training they\ncould be qualified. They aren't qualified by virtue of\ntheir training to become EMTs. They would have to be\nadditionally trained.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Verrilli, are we in the\ndifficult position in hearing your answers that, in\neffect, we're being asked to make findings of fact about\nthe availability of medical personnel and the\nfeasibility of training and so on that the trial court\nnever made because it didn't think it had to make a\ncomparative analysis here, so that if, in fact, the\ncomparative analysis is crucial to the case, we should\nsend the thing back for factfinding by a trial judge\nrather than trying to do it here. Should we remand if\nwe accept your argument?\nMR. VERRILLI: It is true Justice Souter\nthat the trial court did not make factual findings on a\nwhole range of issues with respect to the difficulties\nof constituting the proper dose, the risk of catheter\nplacement, the risk of blowouts, the risk of mixing up\nsyringes, and the adequacy of the monitoring. And I\nagree, Your Honor, that it did so because it didn't\nbelieve that that was particularly relevant to the issue\nbefore it. And that's the -- the basis of our\ndisagreement with respect to the legal test.\nNow, it is -- it is our position that the\nrecord is sufficiently clear and sufficiently\nuncontradicted on the key points with particular respect\nto monitoring that the Court would not have to remand\nbut it certainly would be a reasonable thing to do in\nview of the deficiencies in the actual findings.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You were interrupted, and\nyou gave Justice Ginsburg -- you said you have two\nproblems for monitoring. She asked you who would do\nthis and what measures would they use.\nMR. VERRILLI: Right.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And you were never able to\nget to the second.\nMR. VERRILLI: With respect to the second,\nit's a combination. They would use the available\nequipment, EKG and blood pressure cuff which is the\nstandard practice used for monitoring for\nunconsciousness, but in addition, as the expert\ntestimony in the case established, you have to have\nclose -- close visual observation by the trained person.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, as to the cuff, I\nthought the record was rather clear that it is just not\nused at these low blood pressure levels.\nMR. VERRILLI: No, I don't think so, Justice\nKennedy. There was some question about whether the\nthird device that this monitor is used but the blood --\nthe tracking of blood pressure is a critical way of\nmonitoring for unconsciousness as is the EKG and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Verrilli, this is an\nexecution, not surgery. The other side contends that\nyou need to monitor the depth of the unconsciousness.\nWhen you expect to bring the person back and do not want\nharm to occur to the person. But they assert that to\nknow whether the person is unconscious or not all it\ntakes is a slap in the face and shaking the person.\nMR. VERRILLI: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's their contention.\nMR. VERRILLI: There is no slap in the face.\nThere is no shaking the person. There's no testing of\nthat kind whatsoever under the Kentucky protocol. So\neven under that understanding, which we don't think is\ncorrect, that -- we don't have that here and that's one\nof the problems. All there is, is visual observation by\nan untrained warden and an untrained deputy warden who\nhad testified in this case that they don't know what to\nlook for to determine whether somebody is conscious or\nunconscious.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: With regard to the trial\ncourt's failure to make findings about the availability\nof people to do this and about the possibility of --\npractical possibility of more effective and less painful\ndrugs, was that a failure to ignore evidence that you\nproduced?\nMR. VERRILLI: Yes. It --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Did you introduce evidence\nto show that indeed medically trained personnel were\nreadily available to do the things you say?\nMR. VERRILLI: I don't think we introduced\nevidence that medically trained personnel were ready\navailable, but we did introduce evidence about what\nneeded to be done and, of course, as I said, Kentucky\nlike the other states had their ability to bring\nmedically qualified personnel to bear to run this\nprocess. And so I do think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm very reluctant to send\nit back to the trial court so we can have a nationwide\ncessation of all executions while the trial court\nfinishes its work and then it goes to another appeal to\nthe State supreme court and ultimately, well, it could\ntake years.\nMR. VERRILLI: I understand that, Your\nHonor, and that's why I suggest --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You wouldn't want that to\nhappen.\nMR. VERRILLI: That's why I suggested that\nthere is -- that this case can be decided on the basis\nof the record here because the undisputed expert\ntestimony on these key issues shows the deficiencies in\nthe protocol.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: May I ask you another\nquestion?\nMR. VERILLI: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: May I ask another question\nabout the state of the evidence. It really goes to an\nunderstanding of your position that was discussed a\nlittle bit earlier about the preferability of simply\nbarbiturate dose as opposed to the three-drug\ncombination. You said a moment ago that the evidence\nwas -- and I think it was undisputed evidence -- that\nthree grams of the barbiturate actually used would be\nsufficient to cause death; is that correct.\nMR. VERRILLI: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And that was undisputed?\nMR. VERRILLI: Each side's expert testified\nto precisely the same thing.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. VERRILLI: Three grams was certain to\ncause death.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So that if the current\nthree-gram dosage were used and the second and third\ndrugs were not administered, death would occur based on\nthe undisputed evidence in this case.\nMR. VERRILLI: The record establishes that\ndeath is certain.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Secondly, my understanding,\nmy recollection, is that in a couple of places in your\nbrief, one at least, you referred to the preferability\nof administering a, and I think the term was, massive\ndose of barbiturate, which I took to mean more than the\nthree grams. Is that what you meant?\nMR. VERRILLI: No. Three grams is a massive\ndose.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: That is the massive dose.\nMR. VERRILLI: But if one had any doubt\nabout the certainty of the effect of causing death, one\ncould always just increase the dose. But the record\nhere is that three grams --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is there any evidence in\nthe record about what the enhanced dose would\nappropriately be if you decided or if a protocol author\ndecided that there would be no chance whatsoever that\ndeath would not occur, and the amount should be greater\nthan three grams? Was there any evidence in the record\nabout how much there ought to be if you were going to go\nabove three grams?\nMR. VERRILLI: I'm not sure there's anything\nin the record, Your Honor. There is discussion in the\namicus briefs about some other jurisdictions that have\ngone as high as five grams.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And the government has\ntold us they do.\nMR. VERRILLI: Right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In the Federal response.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You have objections\nthat would apply even to your single drug protocol. You\ntell us that one reason this challenged protocol doesn't\nwork is because people will mix the drugs in the wrong\nway, including the sodium pentathol. That objection\nwould still be there if we adopted your alternative,\nwouldn't it?\nMR. VERRILLI: No, Mr. Chief Justice,\nbecause, as I've tried to say earlier, even if there is\nmaladministration --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm focusing\nspecifically on the mixing of the drugs. The mixing of\nthe sodium pentathol would be undertaken under the\nKentucky procedure and under your proposed alternative,\ncorrect?\nMR. VERRILLI: That's correct. But the\ndifference is if there's an error at that stage in the\nprocess and the execution proceeds, there may be a\nproblem that needs to be fixed, but it will not be a\nproblem that causes any pain, and that's the critical\ndifference because if it doesn't cause pain it can't be\na cruel and unusual punishment.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We have been discussing\nthis as though that is a constitutional requirement.\nWhere does that come from, that you must find the method\nof execution that causes the least pain? We have\napproved electrocution, we have approved death by firing\nsquad. I expect both of those have more possibilities\nof painful death than the protocol here. Where does\nthis come from that in the, in the execution of a person\nwho has been convicted of killing people we must choose\nthe least painful method possible? Is that somewhere in\nour Constitution.\nMR. VERRILLI: We don't make the argument\nthat States are required to choose the least painful\nmethod possible. Our standard is grounded on three, I\nthink, extremely solid, well- established points of\nEighth Amendment doctrine.\nThe first one is this: The core concern of\nthe Eighth Amendment at the time of its founding, of\ncourse, was precisely the question of whether the\ncarrying out of death sentences would inflict torturous\ndeaths. So we're at the core of the historical concern.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, I don't agree with\nthat. The concern was with torture, which is the\nintentional infliction of pain. Now, these States, the\nthree-quarters of the States that have the death\npenalty, all except one of whom use this method of\nexecution, they haven't set out to inflict pain. To the\ncontrary, they have introduced it presumably because\nthey, indeed, think it's a more humane way, although not\none that is free of all risk.\nMR. VERRILLI: That's the second principle,\nYour Honor, is that this Court's cases, including the\nones that Your Honor averted to, have said that the\nstandard is whether the means of execution inflicts\nunnecessary pain.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No --\nMR. VERRILLI: And --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Unnecessary and wanton,\nunnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, the -- with all due\nrespect, Wilkerson and Kemmler say \"unnecessary pain.\"\nResweber says \"unnecessary pain and\" --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then, you're changing\nyour position. You said -- you just said earlier that we\ndidn't have to find the least painful way.\nMR. VERRILLI: No, that's correct, because\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But if you're not using the\nleast painful way, you are inflicting unnecessary pain,\naren't you?\nMR. VERRILLI: No.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can you rectify that?\nMR. VERRILLI: Yes, because, Justice Scalia,\nour position is that the pain that is inflicted here\nwhen this goes wrong is torturous, excruciating pain\nunder any definition. We're not talking about a slight\nincrement different. We're talking about the infliction\nof torturous pain.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Isn't your position that\nevery form of execution that has ever been used in the\nUnited States, if it were to be used today, would\nviolate the Eighth Amendment?\nMR. VERRILLI: No.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, which form that's been\nused at some time in an execution would not violate?\nMR. VERRILLI: We would have to suggest it\nto the test that we are advocating, which it would --\nwhether there is a risk of torturous pain.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Hanging certainly would,\nright?\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, it would have to be\nsubjected to the test.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is that a hard question?\nIs that a hard question, whether hanging would, whether\nyou had experts who understood the dropweight, you know,\nthat was enough that it would break the neck?\nMR. VERRILLI: If there is a risk of\ntorturous pain and if there are readily available\nalternatives that could obviate the risk, then any\nsignificant risk --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Hanging's no good. What\nabout electrocution?\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, it would depend. The\nargument about electrocution, Justice Scalia, is whether\nor not it is painless, and that was its point when it\nwas enacted, that it would be a painless form of death.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It has to be, it has to be\npainless?\nMR. VERRILLI: It does not, but that was its\npoint, and I think one would have to subject it to the\ntest to see whether it inflicts severe pain that is\nreadily avoidable by an alternative.\nJUSTICE ALITO: You have no doubt that the\nthree judge protocol that Kentucky is using violates the\nEighth Amendment, but you really cannot express a\njudgment about any of the other methods that has ever\nbeen used?\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, electrocution may well.\nBut it would depend again, Your Honor. If it could be\nestablished that it was painless, that there wasn't a\nrisk that it could go wrong in a way that inflicts\nexcruciating pain then it would be upheld. If it\ncouldn't, it wouldn't. That does seem a serious\nquestion. Obviously, the Court granted certiorari to\nconsider it a few terms ago. But that would be the\ntest, the mode of analysis here, and I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I would think you'd have to\nshow it's unusual, not painless. I mean, cruel and\nunusual is what we're talking about. There's no\npainless requirement in there.\nMR. VERRILLI: There is an unnecessary pain\nrequirement. There is also, Justice Scalia --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where does this unnecessary\npain requirement come from?\nMR. VERRILLI: From this Court's cases.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Dictum in our cases, right?\nMR. VERRILLI: Yes, it comes from this\nCourt's cases.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Dictum in our cases.\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, it seems to me it's\nmore than that. And Pinetti is one case that shows it,\nbecause there's a case in which the Eighth Amendment\nforbid the execution of a person who was insane at the\ntime of execution. In that situation there is no intent\non the part of the people carrying out the execution to\ninflict cruel and unusual punishment. This Court didn't\nrequire intent in Pinetti. In fact, it said something\nquite different, really the polar opposite. It said\nthat the States have to have in place procedures to\nensure that there wasn't an arbitrary infliction of the\ndeath penalty in that circumstance, without any\nrequirement of intent.\nThe Gregg-Woodson-Lockett cases don't have a\nrequirement of intent, and the Kemmler and Wilkinson\ncases don't have a requirement of intent in them either.\nWith respect to the \"unusual\" character of it, just\ndrawing from the dictionary definitions that Your Honor\nposed in the Harmline case, this is unusual in precisely\nthat way in that it is, if Your Honor will just bear me,\nit is such that does not occur in ordinary practice. So\nI do think it's unusual in that sense.\nAnd I'd like to reserve the balance of my\ntime if I may.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Verrilli. Mr. Englert?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ROY T. ENGLERT, JR.,\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS\nMR. ENGLERT: Mr. Chief Justice and may it\nplease the Court:\nMr. Verrilli and I agree that if the first\ndrug is properly administered there will be a painless\ndeath. It is only if the first drug is not properly\nadministered that there is any possible constitutional\nargument in this, in this case.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But do you also agree with\nthe counter- proposition that if it is not properly\nadministered there is some risk of excruciating pain?\nMR. ENGLERT: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And do you agree that if\nthat risk, say, occurred in every case, that it would\nviolate the Eighth Amendment?\nMR. ENGLERT: Yes.\nBecause the administration of the first drug\nis so important, it is important to focus on the\nsafeguards Kentucky has in place to make sure that the\nfirst drug is properly administered. Contrary to what\nMr. Verrilli has suggested, Kentucky has excellent\nsafeguards in place. Let me start with who, who puts in\nthe IV line, which is the most critical step of the\nprocess. Kentucky uses what is probably literally the\nbest qualified human being in the Commonwealth of\nKentucky to place the IV line. It uses a phlebotomist\nwho in her daily job works with the prison population.\nThe problems the prison population --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I take it this is obvious,\nbut I wondered when I went through the brief. I assume\nthis phlebotomist is not an MD?\nMR. ENGLERT: Correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What is the training? I\nmean, \"phlebotomist\" is somebody who works with veins, I\ntake it. What is the training?\nMR. ENGLERT: The training is a certain\namount of learning followed by on-the-job experience.\nThis person places 30 needles a day in the prison\npopulation and at page 273 of the joint appendix it\npoints out that she works in her daily job with the\nprison population. So what she is used to from many\nyears of working with the prison population is the kind\nof problems of compromised veins we have in the inmate\npopulation specifically.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So it's somebody like the\nRed Cross worker who puts in the needle when somebody\ndonates blood.\nMR. ENGLERT: No, Your Honor. It's someone\nlike the person who inserts an IV in a hospital. The\nexperts in this case all agreed that in a hospital\nsetting IVs are not inserted by medical doctors, they\nare inserted by phlebotomists. That's what they do.\nThey teach medical residents how to insert IVs because\ndoctors in training don't know how to do this. And it's\nwhat's somewhat derisively referred to as scut work in\nthe hospital setting.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Englert, I thought\nthat there wasn't a serious question about who inserts\nthe IV, that those are trained people, but the point\nthat was highlighted was that the people who control the\nflow into the IV connection, that those people have no\ntraining, the ones that are called executioners, the\nones who operate the, what is it, the syringe.\nMR. ENGLERT: Your Honor, Kentucky has\nsafeguards in place to make sure that the inmate is\nasleep before the second and third drugs are given.\nNow, with respect to those people's training, it's not\naccurate that they have no training. Kentucky has had\none execution since 1998, since it adopted lethal\ninjection, one execution altogether by lethal injection.\nIt's had 100 practice sessions. Kentucky requires\nmonthly practice sessions every month by the execution\nteam because it is very concerned to get it right.\nNow, with respect to pushing the IV, those\nare people whose training is participation in the\npractice sessions, but to make sure that the first drug\nhas had its intended effect, the warden and the deputy\nwarden are in the execution chamber. They are literally\nright on top of the inmate. It's suggested in the\nbriefs that they're feet away. That's not accurate.\nThe record reflects they are inches away.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But they also are not\ntrained people. I think what seems puzzling to me is\nthe State has made an effort to make sure that the\npeople on the team that inserts the IV, that those are\nwell-trained professional people, but then apparently\nthey leave the room, so that once the IV is inserted\nthere is no professional person that has any further\npart.\nMR. ENGLERT: That's -- to say they leave\nthe room is accurate, but the suggestion that they have\nno further part is misleading. They go into the next\nroom. They watch through a one-way mirror, carefully\nwatching to make sure nothing has gone wrong. They're\nin close proximity to the inmate and they are watching\nnow with respect to the warden and deputy warden it's\nbeen suggested they don't know what to look for. That's\nfalse. The record shows otherwise. The main problem in\nthe excuses that have gone wrong the main problem is an\nIV goes into tissue instead of the vein. If that\nhappens, Dr. Dershowitz testified, pages 600 to 601 of\nthe joint appendix the inmate would be awake and\nscreaming. The warden and the deputy warden know how to\ntell the difference between sun whose eye haves closed\nand who seems to have gone to sleep and someone who is\nawake and screaming. It's not just Dr. Dershowitz, it's\nDr. Haas and Dr. Highland, pages 353 and 386 of the\njoint appendix also testified that this would be clear.\nNow, Mr. Verrilli says use a blood\npressure monitor as a safeguard. Justice Kennedy said\ndoesn't the record show that that's not of any use at\nvery low blood pressures, and Justice Kennedy is exactly\ncorrect, at page 578 of the joint appendix.\nDr. Dershowitz testified that the blood pressure cuff\nsimply would have no usefulness in monitoring at this\nlevel of introduction of the barbituate.\nMr. Verrilli has mentioned the one drug\nprotocol at some length this morning and has said it is\ncertain to cause death if three grams of sodium\nthiopental are administered. His expert, Dr. Heath,\npage 499 of the joint appendix, was asked let's assume\nthat you don't take any other measures and gave a\nthree-gram dose of sodium thiopental, what would you\nexpect to happen? I would expect the blood pressure to\ndrop. Would that kill them? No, I wouldn't expect it\nto cause death.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but isn't it clear\nthat a five gram administration of that drug would be\nfatal?\nMR. ENGLERT: No, Your Honor. There is\nnothing in this record --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It's not in the record,\nbut it's in this document that we received the last few\ndays, this long deposition of Dr. Dershowitz.\nMR. ENGLERT: Justice Stevens, let me be\nvery precise in this answer, if I can. What is clear is\nthat a rapidly administered three or five gram dose of a\nbarbituate would cause death in normal circumstances.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And if it doesn't, if you\njust administerED more of the drug, then what?\nMR. ENGLERT: That's problematic actually.\nThis is all way outside the record.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I understand.\nMR. ENGLERT: My understanding is that the\nhuman body can't take more than a certain amount of the\nbarbituates, so it actually becomes problematic to go\npast five grams, which is why nobody comes goes higher\nthan five grams.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Would you contend that the\nsecond drug in the three-drug protocol is necessary in\norder to make the execution effective?\nMR. ENGLERT: No, not effective.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Particularly the one that\nthe Chief Justice described.\nMR. ENGLERT: Correct.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You don't want to have\nunpleasant appearance of death at the time.\nMR. ENGLERT: Well, it's more than\nunpleasant appearance of death, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What is the justification\nfor the second drug when it does, that is the drug that\ncreates the risk of excruciating pain?\nMR. ENGLERT: That's the drug that creates\nthe risk of excruciating if and only if the first drug\nis improperly administered.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Right. I understand that.\nMR. ENGLERT: And the justification is many\nsafeguards are in place to make sure the first drug is\nproperly administered so it doesn't create any real\nrisk.\nAnd second, it does bring about a more\ndignified death, dignified for the inmate, dignified for\nthe witnesses. It's not just --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The dignity of the process\noutweighs the risk of excruciating pain?\nMR. ENGLERT: No, Your Honor. No.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But then the risk of\nexcruciating pain outweigh the risk of an undignified\ndeath?\nMR. ENGLERT: A substantial risk of\nexcruciating pain, a substantial risk of excruciating\npain --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Even a minimal risk.\nEveryone who goes through the process knows there is\nsome risk of excruciating pain that could be avoided by\na single-drug protocol. Would he prefer to say, I want\nto die in a dignified way?\nMR. ENGLERT: Your Honor, if I may answer\nyour question a little bit indirectly. That risk cannot\nbe -- the risk of pain can be avoided by single drug\nprotocol, but there's not a certain death with one drug\nprotocol. It's also a very -- it takes a very long time\nto die with one drug protocol.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, what's \"very long?\n10 minutes?\nMR. ENGLERT: Again, your Honor, this is way\noutside the record. What Dr. Dershowitz --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: They use a single drug\nprotocol for animals because it's more humane than the\nthree drug protocol.\nMR. ENGLERT: No, no. They use a single\ndrug with animals because that is the tradition the\nAmerican Veterinary Medical Association has come up\nwith, using somewhat different considerations. That's\nwhat they've come up with --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, isn't it required by\nKentucky law?\nMR. ENGLERT: The use of pancuronium bromide\nor any neuromuscular blocking agent, any paralytic, is\nbarred by Kentucky law -\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, so something more is\ninvolved than merely veterinary practice.\nMR. ENGLERT: In the veterinary setting\nsomeone, some appropriate policymaker has made the\ndecision that what they perceive as risks outweigh the\nbenefits.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Right. But in the setting\nof Kentucky law the legislature of Kentucky has said we\nare going to make this a legal requirement and I assume\nthey had some reason for it other than the fact that\nvets do it that way.\nMR. ENGLERT: Well --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does the Kentucky\nlaw do anything other than adopt the AVMA guidelines.\nMR. ENGLERT: All the Kentucky law does is\nforbid the use of a neuro muscular blocking agent\neuthanizing animals and that's there is no record of\nthis but presumably that's because veterinarians told\nthe state let slate our that was a good idea.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why was that necessary to\npass a law if the standard veterinary practice was not\nto use T I'm obviously trying to get to what evidence we\nhave here for a finding somewhere that we can take into\nconsideration that there is a comparative benefit under\nthe, under the veterinary practice as distinct from the\nprotocol which has been devised so isn't it reasonable\nto suppose that the Kentucky legislature needs some kind\nof a finding came to some kind of a conclusion that in\nfact there was /SEUG deleterious about using the second\ndrug.\nMR. ENGLERT: That much is reasonable.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. ENGLERT: What's deleterious about using\nthe second drug we all agree is if the first drug is\nmall administered it can cause main. If the first drug\nis not mall add /STEUPBer inned no pain, no pain in\nhumans, no pain in an the mas the judgment was weighed\nnot to use the second drug.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The only cost correct me if\nI'm wrong but the only cost that you have identified in\nusing the one drug only are number one, the appearance\ncost which you equated with dignity in your response to\nJustice Stevens and number two, the possibility and I\ndon't know how strong a possibility but the possibility\nthat the one drug would not work. Is there any other\ncost? In using one drug.\nMR. ENGLERT: Yes. The length of time it\ntakes to die.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And I take it you don't\nhave a figure for that Justice Stevens said 10 minutes\nand I don't think you had a clear answer one way or the\nother as to whether there was likely to be more.\nMR. ENGLERT: If you go outside the record\nof this case in which the record wasn't allowed go into\nthe Harbison record the logic I believe Dr. Dershowitz\ntestified he would expect it to take 30 minutes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And 30 minutes is against\nsome risk of excruciating pain is, that in effect is it\nreasonable to say 30 minutes is too long.\nMR. ENGLERT: Depends on how large the risk\nof excruciating pain S here there is very little\nevidence risk of excruciating pain.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is your point that there is\nsimply no quantification of what that risk is.\nMR. ENGLERT: No. That is one of my points\nbut that's not my whole point Justice Souter.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay what's your.\nMR. ENGLERT: Take a look at speaking\nrhetorically, one can take a look at the so-called\nbotched executions in this country the death penalty\ninform ace center website. The is called botched\nexecutions aren't excuses in which there was pain. They\nare excuses in which in the overwhelming majority one of\nthree things happened. It took a long time Poretto find\na vein and that's the only reason they say it was\nbotched or the inmate showed muscle movements the exact\nsame thing the poem poem poem prevents and with no\nevidence whatsoever there was no pain a/K-PLG those\n/PHOUFPLTs the experts on the other side suggest those\nare botched excuses or somebody made a human error and\ndidn't get the /SRAEUB properly. You don't need medical\ntraining to tell when the guy says it's not working that\nit hasn't gone into the vein.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So the nub of your argument\nreally is they have not made a case or they do not have\na record case for any significant likelihood of\nexcruciating pain is this.\nMR. ENGLERT: That's correct. Beyond the\nabsolute bare minimum likelihood that is inherent in any\nprocess that involves human beings. They agriculture\nmixing of the drugs is a problem. There is a finding of\nfact to the contrary by the district court well\nsupported by evidence. They argue that the placing of\nthe IVs is a problem Kentucky really doesn't have the\nbest qualified person in the state to place the IVs,\nthey argue that there is a risk because the people\nwatching don't know what to look for. All they need to\nlook for is swelling, whether the person is awake,\nthat's noticeable to a lay observer. They argue that\nthe personnel monitoring the execution are not\nsufficiently close which is false. The warden is itch\nmuches away. That's the testimony --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It's still unclear why\nthey should make such an effort to get trained personnel\nin the first instance and then even if they are in the\nnext room, why isn't, why did they deliberately pick\nnonprofessional people to both administer the drugs and\nto check the inmate for consciousness.\nMR. ENGLERT: There are reasons for that\nJustice Ginsburg.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What are the reasons.\nMR. ENGLERT: Okay. To administer the drugs\nthe only trained personnel, the only so-called trained\npersonnel are the people who are barred by the AMA\nethics requirements and by Kentucky law from\nadministering the drugs. Doctors and nurses. As to --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But have you that expert\nteam and it seems that they would be preferable to\nexecutioner who have no professional qualifications.\nMR. ENGLERT: The expert team the people who\nhave had 100 practice sessions since the last execution\nare administering the drugs.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I mean the people who\nadminister the -- who place the IV lines.\nMR. VERRILLI: They have -- they have zero\nexpertise in pushing drugs. They have expertise in\nplacing the line. They have expertise in finding a\nvein. They have no more experience pushing drugs than\nthe person who pushes the drugs.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Englert, can I ask you\na rather basic question? Do you think the\nconstitutionality of the three-drug protocol itself is\nat issue in this case or merely the question whether\nKentucky has done an adequate job of using that\nprotocol?\nMR. ENGLERT: Well, I think what's properly\nbefore the Court is only the latter question. But\nobviously --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So if we just decide this\non the ground -- and the record is very persuasive in\nyour favor, I have to acknowledge -- but if we decide\nthe fact that Kentucky is doing an adequate job of\nadministering this protocol, that would leave open the\nquestion whether the basic use of this second drug,\nwhich does nothing but avoid unpleasantness of the\nvisitors, is itself constitutional?\nMR. ENGLERT: Well --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do we have to wait for\nanother case to decide that rule?\nMR. ENGLERT: I -- the Court could write an\nopinion either way, obviously. There is a good reason\nto hold that the use of the second drug is permissible.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Because I -- to be very\nhonest with you, I think that you're -- you make a very\nstrong case on the administration in Kentucky on the\nrecord in this case, but I'm terribly troubled by the\nfact that the second drug is what seems to cause all the\nrisk of excruciating pain, and seems to be almost\ntotally unnecessary in terms of any rational basis for a\nrequirement.\nMR. ENGLERT: Well, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But that we're not going\nto be able to decide today.\nMR. ENGLERT: Petitioner's own brief\nacknowledges that the three-drug protocol can be applied\nconstitutionally. Judge Fogel in the Morales case --\nCalifornia --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It may have been in this\nvery case, it may be. But that leaves often a whole\nother area of litigation, is what troubles me.\nMR. ENGLERT: Every State that has publicly\nsaid what it uses, uses the three-drug protocol. It\nwould be very strange to hold that that is cruel and\npunishment.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But no legislature has\never required it, as I understand it.\nMR. ENGLERT: No, no. 14 legislatures have\nrequired it.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The three-drug protocol?\nMR. ENGLERT: The three-drug protocol.\nJustice Ginsburg, back to your question.\nThere is a reason why the IV team members leave the\nroom. The curtains are opened after the IVs are placed,\nand the people in the room can be seen by the victim's\nfamilies, by the inmate's families and by the media.\nProtecting the anonymity of the execution team is\nextremely important. They are subject to all kinds of\npressures if their anonymity is not protected. So\ninstead of staying in the room, they go again behind a\none-way mirror in an adjacent room where they have an\nextremely good line of sight to the IVs. This is\nactually covered in the trial record in this case, that\nthey do have a good line of sight. And it's not --\nnothing really changes because they go into another\nroom. Pages 210 and 286 to 287 of the joint appendix is\nwhere there is testimony that the people in the adjacent\nroom do have a good view of the IV line.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And the executioners are\nalso not visible to the public?\nMR. ENGLERT: Correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There was a finding that\nthe second drug serves no therapeutic purpose.\nMR. ENGLERT: That's correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's --\nMR. ENGLERT: We don't quarrel with that.\nThe purpose it serves is the purpose of dignifying the\nprocess for the benefit of the inmate and for the\nbenefit of the witnesses.\nThe Chief Justice said, isn't there going to\nbe litigation against another protocol as soon as it's\nadopted, and yes, Mr. Verrilli will say that's silly, to\nprotect the dignity of the inmate, that argument will\nfail. But the history of death penalty litigation\nsuggests that the next advocate who comes along\nrepresenting an inmate will say, the one drug protocol\nis no good because it doesn't do enough to protect the\ndignity, or the two drug protocol is no good because it\ndoesn't do enough to protect dignity.\nWith respect to the time it takes to carry\nout an execution and whether that's a legitimate\nconsideration, I actually invite the Court's attention\nto one of the briefs, amicus briefs, filed in support of\nPetitioners, the Human Rights Watch brief, which in turn\ncites the decision of the UN Human Rights Committee in\nthe NG case.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But if we held that that\njustification was insufficient to justify this protocol,\nit's hardly likely we would hold that it's so serious\nand make the whole procedure unconstitutional.\nMR. ENGLERT: I'm not sure I follow the\nquestion.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: The interest in protecting\nthe dignity of the inmate and of the observers is the\njustification for the second drug.\nMR. ENGLERT: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If we held that that --\nthat that justification is insufficient to justify the\nprotocol, how could we ever hold that that justification\nis so serious as to make the whole procedure\nunconstitutional.\nMR. ENGLERT: I'll tell you frankly how you\ncould hold that. What will happen in the next case is\nthey will say: This issue wasn't raised in the trial\ncourt in Kentucky, therefore the Supreme Court decided\nthis case on an inadequate factual record, and therefore\nthe Court should take a new look at it because life and\ndeath are at stake.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And presumably it\nwould depend upon whatever new alternative the plaintiff\nin that case proposed.\nMR. ENGLERT: Correct. If the standard is\ntruly eliminating all unnecessary risk of pain than\nanything that is not the single optimal standard is\nunconstitutional, and the States cannot do what they\nhave done for the last 220 years, which is to use\ndifferent protocols at different times and work to\nimprove their protocols. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Englert. Mr. Garre?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE,\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. GARRE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nPetitioners ask this Court to invalidate a\nmethod of execution that everyone agrees is entirely\npain free when followed and to order the State of\nKentucky to adopt a method that has never been used in\nany execution and is out of step with the laws and\npractice in every death penalty jurisdiction in the\nUnited States. The proposed constitutional standard\nthat Petitioners say requires this extraordinary result\nhas several fundamental flaws.\nFirst, it is at odds with this Court's\nprecedence establishing a substantial risk threshold for\nclaims of future injury in the Eighth Amendment context\nand this Court's cases holding that the added anguish\ncaused by the negligent, accidental or inadvertent\ninfliction of pain is not the unnecessary infliction of\npain prescribed by the Eighth Amendment. Justice\nMarshall wrote that for the Court in the Estelle v.\nGamble opinion on page 105, and this Court has\nreiterated the principle that negligent, accidental or\ninadvertent infliction of pain, however strong or\nanguishing, is not proscribed by the Eighth Amendment.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What do you say to the\nresponse which I think was in the briefs that the\nsubstantiality requirement has been derived in the\ncourse of conditions of confinement -- sort of\nlitigation -- and we really should regard execution as\nsort of a -- a separate subject for purposes of coming\nup with a standard. What do you say to that?\nMR. GARRE: A few things. We are here today\nin this Section 1983 action, because this Court and the\nHill case and the Nelson case analogized methods of\nexecution claims to conditions of confinement claims\ninsofar as these claims are not directed to the\npunishment itself, but to the manner in which punishment\nis implemented or carried out. So this Court itself\nunder the Hill and Nelson case put these types of cases\ninto the conditions of confinement.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, we did for purposes\nof making a habeas 1983 distinction, but I -- is the\ndistinction supportable when we come down to the\nquestion whether there should be a standard specific to\nexecution as opposed to other conditions?\nMR. GARRE: I don't think it is, Justice\nSouter. The substantial risk standard that the Court\nhas applied in the Farmer v. Brennan case and the Hiland\nv. McKinney case -- applied to conditions of\nconfinement claims -- where inmates faced the risk of an\nexcruciating pain or even death. If the risk -- if the\nstandard that the Court applies to someone who is forced\nto spend -- to live with a five pack a day smoker is\nsubstantial risk, even though that person faces the risk\nof developing lung cancer, which everybody would agree\nis excruciatingingly painful death they're not sure why\nthe Constitution would place any different standard with\nrespect to the types of claims at issue in this case.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Is there any comparative\nelement in the substantial risk standard, if it were\nclearly established, undisputed that there was an\nalternative method that was much less risky, would there\nbe an Eighth Amendment problem with the State or the\nFederal government nevertheless persisted in using a\nmethod that was inferior?\nMR. GARRE: We think that that could be part\nof the analysis -- that you would look to other feasible\navailable alternatives. Although I would say that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If that's part of the\nanalysis, this never ends.\nMR. GARRE: Well, Justice --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If that's part of the\nanalysis, there will always be some claim that there is\nsome new method that's been devised, and once again\nexecutions are stayed throughout the country.\nMR. GARRE: And we agree with that, and\nthat's why we think that Petitioner's claim is wrong.\nIt's going to lead to endless litigation and a regime in\nwhich there is no finality. The other point I wanted to\nmake, in response to Justice Alito, is that as a\nthreshold matter, this court case is establishing that\nyou have to show with respect to the method you're\nchallenging, a risk that is more than the risk of\nnegligence or accident in the method that is being\ncarried out. And again, Estelle v. Gamble establishes\nthat, Farmer v. Brennan reiterates that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So you're standard is that\nthere has -- well, don't let me misphrase it for you,\nbut there have to be other obvious available\nalternatives.\nMR. GARRE: Well, the way that we've\ndescribed it, Justice Kennedy, is you that have to show\na substantial risk that the method you're challenging\nwould impose a considerably greater degree of pain than\nother available feasible alternatives. But to get into\nthat kind of comparative inquiry, we do think that you\nhave to get over the first threshold established by this\nCourt's cases -- that you're arguing about something\nother than the accidental or negligent infliction of\npain, and we don't think Petitioners in this case have\neven gotten over that hurdle.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So your safeguard one is\nthe only -- you have against Justice Scalia, endless\nlitigation, or does your threshold two do the same\nthing.\nMR. GARRE: Well, threshold two would as\nwell because once you're into that kind of comparative\ninquiry you would still have to take a look at the\nfeasible other alternative and no one has ever tried the\none drug alternative. Justice Breyer you're right we\ndon't know whether it's going to work in practice.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Those who oppose capital\npunishment entirely across the board are quite willing\nto take a careful look at everything. They are quite\nwilling to take a look at other alternatives. That's\nthe problem we come up with a decision that requires a\ncareful look in every case whenever there is a newly\ndeveloped method of execution the problem will always be\nbefore us and executions will always be impermissible.\nWe agree with those concerns, Justice Scalia, I want to\nbe clear. Our standard is not a least risk --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You have to, I mean, I\ncan't, I don't know if \"substantial\" is the right word\nto capture it. Perhaps the right word is is there a\nsignificant risk that can be easily averted and what I'm\nworried about here is do we or do we not send it back,\nI'm quite honestly disturbed by the fact that in this --\nI can't report they both recommend pancuronium and that\nthe sodium thiopental doesn't work not even in grams of\nthree doses in all cases but they think the contrary and\nif there is uncertainty here should we send it back for\nconsideration of all these things in a more full hearing\nunder a standard that does allow comparisons with other\nmethods not to find a comparison not too fine a\ncomparison but at least a practical comparison.\nMR. GARRE: And the answer is no. First and\nforemost they had an opportunity to develop the one drug\nalternative below. They made no effort to present any\nevidence on that. The record is completely undeveloped\nand typically this court doesn't allow people to go back\nand relitigate a case again.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes but if we don't do\nsomething like that in this case Mr. Garre another case\nis going to come along and we are going to be right back\nhere a year from now or 18 months from now and wouldn't\nit be better to get one case litigated thoroughly and\nget the issue decided rather than simply wait here for\nanother one to wind its way.\nMR. GARRE: We think that this court should\ndecide the issue. We think it should decide it by\nsaying Petitioners have not established a\nconstitutionally significant.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Sure but if we decide it on\nthis basis the next Petitioner is going to say I'm\ncoming into court with evidence these people did not\npresent and therefore we are going to have a new case\nand new round of litigation and I think what's\ndisturbing Justice Breyer what's disturbing me and\nothers is we want some kind of a decision here, and it\nseems to me that the most expeditious way of getting it\nif comparison analysis is appropriate and I will be\ncandid to say I think it is is to send this case back\nand say okay do a comparative analysis, make the\nfindings and we will then have a case that will in\neffect resolve the issue as much as one case can ever\ndo.\nMR. GARRE: Let me make two responses to\nthat if I could again we don't think Petitioners have\nshown anything close to a substantially of risk and\nsecond a virtue in allowing there is a virtue in not\ngoing further in this case and allowing the states\nthemselves to continue to assess this matter. The\nstates have continuously reassessed and repeated\nmodifications to their lethal injection protocols three\nstates within the last years have taken major internal\nreviews of the three drug protocol California Tennessee\nand Florida they have all concluded that additional\nsafeguards were warranted but that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You say that substantial,\nthat comparison with other possibilities is not\nnecessary so long as the only risk that is coming is a\nrisk of negligence or improper execution of what, of\nwhat the protocol requires right?\nMR. GARRE: That would be --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You would say that so long,\nso long as the only risk comes from negligent\napplication of the protocol, no comparison is required?\nMR. GARRE: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And if we decided that, if\nwe decided that if this protocol is properly executed,\nit does not create a substantial risk that would be the\nend of the matter wouldn't it.\nMR. GARRE: That would be the end of the\nmatter.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And we would not have\nanother case in front of us next year.\nMR. GARRE: That's probably true. There is\nno shortage of imagination on the death penalty\nadvocates that have brought those kinds of claims but a\ndecision along those lines would go a great way to\nproviding greater clarity and certainly in this area.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Garre would you\nexplain to me I can't the Federal Government has picked\nfive grams instead of flee.\nMR. GARRE: May I answer the question.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.\nMR. GARRE: Yes Your Honor. The Federal\nGovernment concluded that that was an appropriate dosage\nto ensure a deep consciousness among the condemned\ninmate. Other jurisdictions have picked three grams and\nI would say that the Federal Government is currently\nconsidering whether five or three is the correct dosage.\nBut the Federal Government --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Did you mean to say\nunconsciousness.\nMR. GARRE: Unconsciousness, yes to render\nthe inmate deeply unconscious for a number of hours\nthat's established by the record thank you very much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you Mr. Garre.\nMr. Verrilli, you have three minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.,\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. VERRILLI: Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.\nThe risk here is real that is why in the State of\nKentucky it's unlawful to euthanize animals in the way\nthat carries out its executions that's true not only\nwith the use of pancuronium one cannot use potassium\nunless someone trained in ensuring effective anesthesia\nis participating in the process and what that is is a\nmarker that this is a real danger sufficiently real that\nit's not tolerated with animals.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the anesthesia\nconcern of course is you don't want to kill the person\nwhen you're administering just anesthesia in a surgery\nso you would want somebody trained there that you could\nbring them back if anything went wrong that concern is\nnot present here.\nMR. VERRILLI: Nor is it present with\nrespect to euthanizing animals and never the -- it's the\ndanger of the anesthesia going wrong there can be a\ntorturous pain inflicted that has led veterinarians to\nsay you have to have somebody in the process who is\ntrained in monitoring anesthetic death and Justice\nBreyer if I could refer back to your Netherlands point\nmy understanding is that in the Netherlands there is a\ndoctor present who is trained in anesthesiology who\nadministers this whole process and so the risk is\ndramatically different in a situation where you have\nthat trained person there than the situation we have in\nKentucky now with respect to the other states and the\nother so-called botched executions that my friend\nMr. Englert referred to is just not right to say that\nthey were all about cut downs and small problems. The\nrecord finds a fact in the Morales case without respect\nto the 11 lethal injection studies there six out of the\nseven were inadequately -- the experts in that case\nadmitted it was likely that one was not likely an at the\ntime -- at the time that the pancuronium and potassium\nwere put in the system similarly in the case in North\nCarolina the evidence credited by the court was that\nwith respect to four of them the condemned inmate was on\nthe -- any gasping struggling not the kind of\ninvoluntary twitching that Mr. Englert is worried about\nbut clear that the anesthetics are not working with\nrespect to the lethality of thiopental at page 42 of the\njoint appendix Dr. Heath says that thiopental will be\nlethal by itself three grams at page 494 he says indeed\nit will be lethal by itself in virtually every case at\ntwo grams. At page, at page forgive me I don't have the\npage number reference handy but Dr. Dershowitz the\nstate's expert says the same thing now the reference\nthat Mr. Englert referred to at page 499 is where\nDr. Heath is being a asked a question of whether would\nyou expect death to occur when three grams are\nadministered but he is being asked a series of questions\nabout administration in a surgical procedure which are\nusing ventilators and other procedures to keep the\nperson alive and he said in that setting the answer is\nno so that's just not a fair representation of the\nrecord at all now with respect to the question of\nwhether we ought to analogize this to the deliberate\nindifference standard and convictions of confinement\ncases it seems to me there is a fundamental difference\nhere which is that the Commonwealth of Kentucky is\nmaking a deliberate choice here.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Finish your\nsentence.\nMR. VERRILLI: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nA deliberate choice here to use chemicals that create\nthis danger and given that it has done so it ought to\nhave the commensurate obligation to take the reasonable\nsteps necessary to on vote the risk.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you counsel.\n"
