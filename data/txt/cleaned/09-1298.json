United States.\nMr. Phillips.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThe proposition that Petitioners are here\nchallenging is the one adopted or embraced by the\nFederal Circuit that says that the United States\nGovernment can declare that certain of its government\ncontracting partners have operated in default and, under\nthose circumstances, can reach into the government\ncontractor's pocket, withdraw at the time $1.35 billion\nof moneys that were spent by the United States, but for\nservices that were rendered, without question, pursuant\nto the contract, pursuant to the instructions of the\nUnited States Government, and that when the contractor\nseeks to defend against the claim that it has engaged in\nsome kind of default conduct, that the government can\nassert the state-secrets privilege and, in so doing,\ndeprive the contractor of the ability effectively to\nrespond to the government's conclusion.\nUnder those circumstances, it seems to me\nthat the statement in this Court's decision in United\nStates v. Reynolds, which is that the government is\ncertainly free to assert the state-secrets privilege,\nbut when it does so, it has to assume certain\nresponsibilities that come from it, at least in the\ncircumstances where the United States is the moving\nparty.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Phillips, when the\ncontractors -- when they failed to deliver the first\naircraft at the time specified by the contract, their\nreason was that its costs would far outrun the contract\nprice, and so it sought to reformulate the contract.\nAt that time -- correct me if I'm wrong, but\nI think at that time the contractors said nothing at all\nabout superior knowledge and the government's obligation\nto share information that it hadn't shared.\nMR. PHILLIPS: There was nothing specific\nwith respect to that, Justice Ginsburg. The first time\nthe contractors identified the superior knowledge\nproblem arose, obviously, when the government took the\nextraordinary step of issuing a cure notice, because up\nuntil that point, obviously, the parties are attempting\nto negotiate and work to a final resolution of this\nproject, as you would hope any contracting entities\nwould, to bring the contract to a happy resolution,\nso -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you would expect them\nto say, if they -- if that was the impediment to going\nforward on this contract, to at least mention it. And\nto -\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, yes, I think you have\nto put it in context, Justice Ginsburg, because during\nthis period of time, obviously, there were consistent\nefforts and requests being made to get access to both\nthe B-2 and the A-117 stealth technologies, and there\nwere discussions that went back and forth, and the\ndistrict court -- or the Court of Federal Claims\nspecifically held -- eventually, the information was\nforthcoming, but it was, candidly, too little and too\nlate in order to effectively allow the contract to\nproceed as -- as planned.\nSo I think -- I mean, I agree, you know, in\na perfect world, maybe you would have identified this.\nBut in this situation, the parties are simply trying to\ncome to some kind of a resolution that allows both sides\nto be satisfied by the final -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Phillips --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- disposition.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- why wasn't the need\nto share that technology a part of this contract or a\ncondition to the contract? I've gone through the\ncontract -- or, not all of it; enough of it. I haven't\nfound anywhere in the contract that it requires the U.S.\nto share information with you. Does that have anything\nto do with what due process would require? Meaning -\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, I think -- I think,\nJustice -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -\nMR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm going to pose a\nhypothetical. Let's assume the contract required the\nsharing of state secrets, and the government then\ninvokes its privilege. Is that a different case than\nthis one in terms of due process? Wouldn't the -\nwouldn't the former situation, where it's been made a\ncondition of the contract, require a different treatment\nthan this situation where the government's just saying,\nif you want to raise a defense that's not part of the\ncontract, then you do what every other litigant with a\nprivilege does -- who a privilege has been invoked\nagainst; you proceed with whatever evidence you have.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, you have to --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's usually what\nhappens with other privileges.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. And we would have\nbeen perfectly content to proceed with the evidence we\nhad. But the ultimate decision by the Court of Federal\nClaims was that it was impossible to ultimately be in a\nposition to resolve it.\nBut I want to answer your more fundamental\nquestion, Your Honor, as to the -- you know, the basic\npoint is, is that the background principle of law, the\nsuperior knowledge defense, is the understanding of the\nparties when they enter into an agreement. I mean, that\nwould have been true just as much in the Helene Curtis\ncase and the other cases where the Federal Circuit has\nacknowledged the superior knowledge defense. That's\nbeen around for a long time. It's a-- it's an\nunderstood basis on which the parties enter into an\nagreement. That's the first answer.\nThe second answer is that you're asking us\nto put into a contract something about information that\nwe don't know anything about. We -- I mean, we have\nsome sense about the B-2 and the A-117, but we don't\nknow anything about the other programs that are\nidentified here.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Wait a minute. Where's\nthe obligation of the government to tell you build it\nthis way using the technology we already have? I\nthought your claim was that you were promised this\ninformation, and you structured the contract based on\nthat promise.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, our claim -- we have\nseparate -- we have a series of distinct claims.\nOur first claim is that we never would have\nentered into the contract in the first place if the\ngovernment had provided us with information based on its\nsuperior knowledge that the -- for instance, the weight\nspecifics that we were being asked to provide or to\nsupply were literally impossible to comply with based on\nwhat the government already knew. If we had been just\ntold that much, just given a warning, we wouldn't be in\nthe situation where we are here -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There's a factual\ndispute about that. I think somewhere I read that there\nis a claim that they told you your weight estimates\nweren't right.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well -- I mean, that may be a\nfactual dispute, but I'd be -- and I'd be happy to\nlitigate that issue if -- if we can get to that point\nwhere we're in fact allowed to litigate any aspects of\nour particular defense. But the bottom line here is --\nand again to state the proposition as starkly as it -\nas it is, because this is the way it comes to the Court\nfrom the Federal Circuit: They're saying that the\ngovernment can assert a claim for $1.35 billion dollars\nagainst us and tell us that we cannot defend against\nthat claim even though the reason why we were unable to\ncomply with the contract is because of the fact that the\ngovernment didn't provide us information either at the\noutset or as we went along.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The two questions I'd have\nis, first of all -- Justice Sotomayor, sorry; I did not\n-- I did have her question, because what that suggests\nis, in this case, it's not unfair to hold your client in\nthis case. And you just read the two circuit court\nopinions here, and you think this is a defense coming\nout of long in the past that doesn't have much substance\nto it. That was her question, I think, as I understood\nit.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Can I answer -\nJUSTICE BREYER: In other words, it's not\nunfair. But let me give you the other question because,\nsometime in your argument, I'd like you to get to that.\nAnd that is, if we accept as a principle of law what was\nsaid in Reynolds, a criminal case or whatever, and apply\nit to government contracting, where sophisticated\ncontractors are perfectly capable of negotiating their\nown contract, we are not just throwing a monkey wrench\ninto the gears of government contracting; we're throwing\nthe whole monkey. That's my second question.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I don't -\nJUSTICE BREYER: One, that this isn't a case\nthat calls for it; and, two, the threat to government\ncontracting by changing from Reynolds to here is\noverwhelming. Now, I'd like your views on both of\nthose.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. Well, it seems to me\nclearly that this is the precise situation where\nReynolds is saying if you cannot bring forward a\nlegitimate defense -- I mean, part of the problem is we\ndon't know precisely what information we didn't have and\nwere never entitled to. So it's very difficult to say\nhow strong is our defense under these circumstances.\nWhat we do know is that the Court of Federal\nClaims judge looked very carefully at this and said that\nwe had made an impressive showing without regard to any\nof the confidential or privileged information of a prima\nfacie defense in these circumstances. So our position\nis we had a very valid defense. This is not pretextual.\nWe're not throwing this in simply as a mechanism to\nforce the government to assert its state secrets. It's\na fairly contrived approach to litigation and, frankly,\nnot something that I could imagine any circumstance in\nwhich we would do that.\nTwo, I don't see how this throws a monkey\nwrench into this process whatsoever, much less throws\nout the monkey, because -- because the basic\nunderstanding here is that the government is not\nentitled to force its contractor down along this course.\nIf the government has information available to it, then\nit has to make that information -- has to be forthcoming\nwith the information with the contractor, either at the\noutset, which would have been the best of all\ncircumstances here, or as matters go along.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, the Petitioners as a\nformal matter were the moving party; isn't that right?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, not -- I mean, \"moving\nparty\" I think is -- is not a self-defined concept,\nJustice Alito. The Petitioners are the plaintiffs.\nJUSTICE ALITO: They were the plaintiffs.\nAnd the review scheme that you outlined was known to\nthem beforehand. So why do we need to look beyond that?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, because the review\nscheme also says that the very -- in 1986, in the\nAssurance case, the Federal Circuit said -- which was\nbefore this contract was entered into, the Federal\nCircuit said the filing -- the mere filing of a\ncomplaint immediately vacates the contracting officer's\nrule.\nSo our understanding at the time we entered\ninto this agreement is that if there were a problem with\nthe way the contracting officer operated, we would be\nallowed to file a claim and immediately take the\ncontracting officer's rule off the table. Under those\ncircumstances, it seems to me all we're asking for is to\ngo back to the status quo ante in that situation, which\nmeans there's no contracting officer decision, there's\nno basis on which the government can make a claim for\n1.35 billion, now $3 billion.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you explain that -\nyou've referred to it several times now. I thought that\nthat was not a progress payment based on completed work.\nThe government says that that money was advanced; you\nhad not complied with what was necessary to comply with\nto get that 1.35 million. They distinguished the $1.35\nmillion that you legitimately received as a progress\npayment, but this next, they say, you have not fulfilled\nwhat you needed to do to get that.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, what had not happened\nis that the final -- there had not been a final sign-off\nby the contracting officer approving it and thereby\nreducing it to a liquidated claim. But that's a vastly\ndifferent statement than to say -- and, indeed, we have\nan argument that, at least with respect to half of that,\nthat it had already effectively been approved through a\nmechanism independent of the contracting officer.\nBut the bottom line here is these were\nservices rendered, actually rendered. This was not some\nkind of a prepayment for services to be rendered in the\nfuture. That's not the nature of this contract. These\nwere -- this was for work we had done, for which we had\nsubmitted specific claims, and for which the contracting\nofficer had pending before him at the time. And so, you\nknow, what the government says is that -- is that it was\na payment and they didn't ultimately get the airplanes\nthat were the ultimate desire of the contract under\nthese circumstances, and that's obviously true because\nthey terminated the contract a year before the airplanes\nwere due to be provided to them.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you are here seeking\nto -- to emerge as a total winner, that is to get from\nthis contract what you would have gotten if it had been\nsuccessfully completed, including any profit -\nMR. PHILLIPS: No. No, Justice Ginsburg,\nthat's not true. All we are asking for is -- are the\nremedies that are fully available if you were to convert\nthis from a termination for default into a termination\nfor convenience. And under those circumstances, what -\nyou know, that -- the government has a wonderful\nmechanism there. It protects it against the kinds of\nlost profits damages that might otherwise be available\nin a situation where you have a more traditional breach\nof contract.\nSo all we're -- all we're asking for is the\nactual amount of money that we expended, that the -\nfrankly, the Court of Federal Claims explicitly found,\nand at this stage it's unchallenged, although presumably\nit might be litigable at some point, but that these were\nall reasonable, allowable, and fairly allocable costs to\nthese -- to this particular contract.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, why shouldn't we view\nthis as if it were a dispute between two private\ncontracting parties? And if we did that, perhaps one\nparty would be the moving party with respect to some of\nthe claims and the other party would be the moving party\nwith respect to the remaining claims.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Justice Alito, I think that\nis precisely how you ought to look at it, and -- and\nwe'd be very comfortable with that, because it's quite\nclear to me that, except in the hyper-technical way\nthat -- that you articulate because of -- because of the\nway the Contracts Disputes Act plays out, that the\ngovernment is unquestionably the moving party, the party\nseeking affirmative relief to be able to take 1.35\nbillion -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I would -- I think it's\nquestionable, Mr. Phillips, for this reason: You say\nthat it's an implied term of this contract that the\ngovernment has a duty to share certain information, and\nyou are seeking to enforce that implied term of the\ncontract. So it seems to me, as to that alleged duty,\nyou are the moving party. You're saying: Court, please\nenforce this implied term of the contract.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, not -- I mean, you\ncould -- that's one way to articulate it. I think the\nother way to articulate it, which -- which is much more\nconsistent with the reality of what's going on here, is\nthat the government is making a claim for $1.35 billion\nfor which -- on the basis that we did not act in a\ntimely fashion. And that's the only basis that exists\nin this litigation anymore, is just the time of the\nactions that we took.\nAnd our answer to that claim is to say: No,\nwe -- we are not at fault for the delays because you did\nnot provide us the information or you did not spare us\nthe burden of having to go down this path in the first\ninstance.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but then you go on to\nsay: Moreover, give us -- give us the payment for the\nadditional money beyond the 1.35 that you've already\ngiven us -\nMR. PHILLIPS: But -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- plus this additional\nmoney that we've expended.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. But that just goes to\nJustice Alito's question about is there some way to\nevaluate those claims separately, and the answer is,\nyes, they should be evaluated separately. And -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why shouldn't we? I\nmean, it -- it seems to me if -- if, indeed, you say the\ngovernment has come up with a defense that makes it\nimpossible to decide who's in the right here -\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- why don't we just -- you\nknow, I think the usual course taken by courts would be\nto leave the parties where they are. The matter can't\nbe litigated. That would mean you would keep your $1.35\nbillion, but you wouldn't be entitled to sue for the\nadditional amount. If -- if you were that worried, you\nshould have -- you -- you should have had more frequent\nprogress payments or something.\nWhy don't we just leave you where you are,\nboth you and the government, assuming we agree with you\non all the rest?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean, to be sure, we\nwould be much more comfortable in the world you just\narticulated, Justice Scalia, than we are in the Federal\nCircuit.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, you would be 1.35\nbillion -\n(Laughter.)\nMR. PHILLIPS: With interest.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: With interest. I forgot\nthe interest.\nMR. PHILLIPS: That's starting to add up,\nYour Honor.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. PHILLIPS: But -- and -- certainly we\nthink that's -- that is the minimum that we should be\nentitled to, and maybe to some extent you could say\nwe're sort of being a little greedy. But the -- the\nreality is that the standard rule is that if you take a\ncontract and you say you cannot make a determination\nthat the contractor has been guilty of default, then\nthat contract should be, in the -- kind of the basic\ncontract law and it's also in this -- in this agreement,\nthat you -- you convert it to a termination for\nconvenience.\nAnd then the question simply is, what rights\nflow from having declared this to be a termination for\nconvenience?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You mentioned the 1.3 -\nthat you get to keep the 1.35 million, but there was\nalso another figure -- 1.2 million that you would get on\ntop of that.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. And that -- that -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So that certainly\nwouldn't be leaving you where you were.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, no. I mean, actually,\nwhat -- what the $1.2 billion was, was the additional\namounts of money that were actually expended by the\ncontractors that were reasonable, allocable, and\nallowable, by and according to the Court of Federal\nClaims, on this agreement. So, there -- and it would be\nthe standard operating procedure. If you have a\ntermination for convenience, where the government says,\nlook, we've decided we just don't want to have this -\nthese -- we don't want these airplanes anymore, so let's\njust call it off, which the government has the right to\ndo, then the question is, what are the reasonable costs\nthat are, you know, sort of reallocated as a consequence\nof that? And the Court of Federal Claims -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But the government didn't\ndo that. I mean, you're making it up. The government\ndidn't terminate for convenience. The government\nclaimed you're in default. Why would -- why should we\nforce that down the government's throat when we can no\nmore say that the government's wrong than we can say\nthat you're wrong?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, it seems to me the -- I\nmean, the question is was the default -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me you call the\ngame off.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, and the question is, if\nyou call the game off, what -- what flows from that?\nAnd it seems to me that it -- you can say we'll let the\ngovernment call it a default, I suppose, or you could\njust as easily say -- and obviously the position we\nwould take is you say the government cannot call it a\ndefault because, in order to get some kind of a\ndetermination along those lines, somebody is going to\nhave to make a judgment that's not an honest assessment\nof the -- of the -- of the facts of this case.\nAnd so, if you say it's not a default\ntermination, then there's just a certain amount of --\ncertain consequences that flow from converting it, and\nit automatically converts at that point to a termination\nfor convenience. And in a termination for convenience\nsituation, then you reallocate the costs in precisely\nthe way that the Court of Federal Claims has done this\nat this point.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Phillips -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- the fallacy is we're\nnot -- assuming we agree with you on the rest, we're not\nsaying that it's not a default termination. We're\nsaying we don't know.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. And the question\nis -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We're saying we don't know.\nWe don't know what the state-secrets thing is. The\ngovernment is entitled to -- to make that determination,\nso we don't know who's in the right here.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I -- I -- the\nproblem -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So why force the government\nto -- to go to a termination for convenience?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. Well, I would think\nthat the -- that the more appropriate way to proceed\nunder those circumstances, given that a default\ntermination carries with it a lot of collateral\nconsequences, it exposes you to subsequent problems in\nthe contracting context, it creates the possibility of\ndebarment in -- in future proceedings, that rather than\nallow a finding that no one can comfortably conclude is\nthe right finding to stay in place and have those\ncollateral consequences flow from it, the more\nappropriate way to proceed would be to say: Look, I\ncan't make a determination in this case that there\nshould be a termination for default.\nAnd under those -- and so, therefore, the -\nthe -- under the contract, under the government\ncontracting principles generally, it automatically\nconverts over to a termination for convenience. And\nonce that happens, then you go down the road of -- of\nevaluating those costs. And, again, the government's\ngot arguments about those costs, I'm sure, and we can -\nand we can debate those out, although, you know, I would\ncommend the Court to the -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Phillips, give us a\nway, a reasoned way, to reach the result Justice Scalia\nis suggesting, because you are being greedy. You\nadmitted it. The termination -\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, I -- I said -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The termination for --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- I could be characterized\nthat way.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: A termination for\nconvenience carries its own automatic consequences that\nappear unfair in light of the fact that the litigation\nof the default termination has been invoked because\nthere is a risk to the United States. So, is there a\nreasoned way to do it -\nMR. PHILLIPS: Now, are you -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- to not -- to not\nimpose that unfairness on the government? And if\nthere's not, then explain to me why it's unfair, given\nthat you're two sophisticated contracting parties, to\nsay you entered a contract knowing the government could\ninvoke state secrets, it has, and so you bear the risk\nof that. I mean, you always knew the government could\ndo this.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right, but -- well, I don't\nknow whether you want me to answer the second part\nfirst -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It goes back to my\noriginal question, is -\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- or go back to the original\nquestion.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- you could have\ncontracted around it.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Sure, and so could the\ngovernment. I mean, the reality is that the background\nprinciple here is United States v. Reynolds. And United\nStates v. Reynolds says that if somebody is the moving\nparty, that is the party seeking affirmative relief,\nthat's the party who's going to bear the burden to -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Phillips, could I ask\nyou whether that principle makes any sense in this\ncontracting situation, because both parties have argued\nit as though the question of who is the moving party is\ndeterminative of this case, but in a contract situation\nthe question of who's the moving party is very often\narbitrary or fortuitous.\nIf you think about it in a private setting,\nyou have one contract -- one contractor who fails to\nperform or -- or provides some deficient product,\nanother who decides it's not going to pay, and the\nquestion of who the plaintiff is, is often just a matter\nof fortuity, who gets to the courthouse first -\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: -- what the payment schedule\nhas been like, so whether somebody is demanding their\nmoney back or simply refusing to pay it at all.\nSo, why in this contract situation is the\nquestion of who's the plaintiff or who's the moving\nparty -- why does -- why does that make such a\ndifference?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I -- I think that\nactually the Court in Reynolds, to the extent it would\nhave envisioned any of these circumstances decades ago,\nused the language \"moving party\" rather than \"plaintiff\"\nor \"defendant\" precisely for that reason, because I\nthink what the Court had in mind is the party who was\nseeking affirmative relief. And -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It was thinking of a\ntort. It wasn't thinking of -- Reynolds is a tort\naction.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Oh, no. To be sure, that -\nthat's the specific context, although the Court's\nlanguage is broader than that. It just didn't talk\nabout itself as a defendant in a tort action.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But it can't possibly be the\ncase that the question is what the payment schedule is.\nIf I've paid you already and then I find your product\ndeficient, then I'm going to go to court and demand my\nmoney back. If I find your product deficient before I\npay you, then you're going to go to court and say you\nhave to pay me.\nSo why should that difference make a\ndifference with respect to the constitutional question\nbefore us?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, because in the one\nsituation I have $1.35 billion in my pocket for services\nthat were unquestionably rendered and which, in our\njudgment, you know, satisfied our portion of the\nobligation under this contract.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Both party has a claim here.\nOne says you provided deficient performance; the other\nsays you were obligated to pay me. The question of who\nhas the claim and who has the affirmative defense -- it\ncan be structured in either way.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I don't disagree with that,\nJustice Kagan. I think the bottom line, though, is, you\nknow, what -- what -- what are -- what do principles of\nfundamental fairness tell you to do in this case?\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's exactly my problem,\nbecause when I looked at Reynolds, Reynolds doesn't hold\nanything in your favor. It holds the opposite way. It\nsays to you -- in a criminal case, we said it was\nunconscionable for the government both to prosecute and\nnot to -- not to tell them a secret, okay? And it says\nsuch a rationale has no application in a civil forum\nwhere the government is not the moving party. It\ndoesn't say anything about where the government is the\nmoving party.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right, but -\nJUSTICE BREYER: And Exhibit A that it is\nnot unconscionable here consists of the two opinions of\nthe Federal Circuit. I mean -- now, what do you want me\nto read to get over that impression?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean, the very fact\nthat the court says and limits its ruling to where the\ngovernment is not the moving party -- I mean, if the\ngovernment really -- if the court -\nJUSTICE BREYER: It didn't limit it. It\nsaid the rationale is unconscionable. Now, I don't even\nhave to go that far. I can go to \"fundamentally\nunfair.\" All I want to know is what should I read to\nget over my unfortunate impression, which I got out of\nthe two opinions that I did read, that there was nothing\nunfair? Okay?\nWhat do you want me to read to get over that\nimpression -\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well -\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- which I think you do\nwant me to read something.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I think -- right. Well, no,\nyou should clearly read the Court of Federal Claims\nopinion that gave rise to this in the first place, where\n-- where the judge says we have made -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay.\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- an impressive prima facie\nshowing of a defense. And -- and the Federal Circuit's\nview is: We don't care; we're not going to let you go\ndown that path, period.\nAnd all we're saying is that in that\nsituation, where we've made that kind of showing, the\ndefault rule should be the government cannot reach into\nour pocket and -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Just before we get\nthere, that showing was based on the court's in camera\nreview of quite a bit of already confidential\ninformation, correct?\nMR. PHILLIPS: And the non-privileged\ninformation that it had available to it.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And the non-privileged\ninformation. So it made this judgment on the basis of a\ngreat deal of information, and yet it couldn't conclude\nthat you were right as a matter of law, correct?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, it recognized that it\nterminated the discovery early. And, actually, it did\n-- it terminated discovery very early, and -- and there\nare whole programs that we know nothing about. We know\nabout the B-2 and the A-15. What we don't know are the\nother programs, and there's nothing in this record on\nany of that, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nPhillips.\nGeneral.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GENERAL NEAL KUMAR KATYAL\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nGENERAL KATYAL: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\nTwo basic things decide this case. First,\nthe government is not affirmatively invoking the power\nof the Federal court; only the plaintiffs are. It was\nMr. Phillips's clients who 20 years ago walked into the\nFederal court and asked that court to set aside the\ndecision of the contracting officer and to award them\nover a billion dollars in damages. The government, by\ncontrast, simply asked the court to dismiss the Federal\nlawsuit.\nAnd, second, Reynolds makes clear that the\nstate-secrets privilege will be used to bar a claim at\nmost only when the party that is relying on secret\ninformation is trying to use the Federal court to alter\nthe legal status quo. And -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We have -- we've\ngotten to this point in the dispute because you say\nthey're at fault; they say you're at fault. Under the\nstate-secrets doctrine, we can't resolve that question.\nWhy don't we call the whole thing off? Nobody's at\nfault; that means it's terminated not for fault, but for\nconvenience, and that's it.\nGENERAL KATYAL: Well, for several reasons.\nOne is that is the affirmative use of the Federal courts\nto alter the legal status quo. I think the principle of\nReynolds is that -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, only because\nyou altered the legal status quo -- the legal status quo\nis they're going along with their contract, and you\naltered it by holding them in default.\nGENERAL KATYAL: I disagree, Mr. Chief\nJustice. I think that the contract itself specifies\nthat the contracting officer will decide whether or not\nthere's a default termination, and once there is that,\nthey owe -- once the contracting officer so decides,\nthen they owe the unliquidated payments that have -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't that -- isn't\nthat the affirmative step with the contracting officer\nsaying there's a default?\nGENERAL KATYAL: Well, it's certainly an\naffirmative step under the terms of the contract, but it\nis not an affirmative step of the Federal court. Our\ncentral proposition -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's an affirmative\nstep of the Federal Government. He works for you, and\nhe's the one changing the status quo.\nGENERAL KATYAL: Undoubtedly the case, and\nthose are the terms under the contract to which they\nagreed. Our central proposition is that in a world in\nwhich the Federal court doesn't know, as Justice Scalia\nsaid, who is right and who is wrong on a particular\nclaim, it should stay its hand entirely and get out of\nthe business altogether. It should follow the\nHippocratic principle of doing no harm.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Am I correct to interpret\nwhat you've just said to mean that you think this case\nshould be decided under the basic principle of Reynolds,\nthat the party that seeks the affirmative relief -\nseeks affirmative relief from the court is the -- is the\nparty that bears the burden involving the invocation of\nthe state-secrets privilege? You're not asking us to\nadopt a new test applicable in the contracts situation?\nGENERAL KATYAL: Absolutely. I don't think\nwe need to go there. I do think that there are special\narguments available in this case because it is a\ncontract, as Justice Breyer said, with sophisticated\nparties who ex ante will decide who bears the burden of\ncoming into court and -- and so on. But here I think\nthis is a simple principle that, in a world in which the\ncourt doesn't know who is right and wrong in the\nsuperior knowledge defense -- and that's the answer to\nthe question that Justice Sotomayor asked to Mr.\nPhillips a moment ago about what did the Court of\nFederal Claims ultimately decide. They didn't decide\nthere was a prima facie case. They said at page 245a of\nthe 2001 opinion: We can't know one way or the other.\nAnd so -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could I -- could I --\nI'm interrupting Justice Alito because you answered his\nquestion very quickly. It's your position that if we\ndetermine you're the moving party, you lose?\nGENERAL KATYAL: Oh, no. I think -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is that what your answer\nto him -\nGENERAL KATYAL: No, we -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- which is that -- he\nasked you whether we apply Reynolds; you didn't say\nwhich part of Reynolds. Are you conceding that if we\napply Reynolds and we find you're the moving party, you\nlose?\nGENERAL KATYAL: Oh, absolutely not, Justice\nSotomayor. I don't think Reynolds says that if the\ngovernment is the moving party, it's an automatic loss.\nI think that's a back-up argument that we have advanced\nin our brief that I think there is no reason whatsoever\nfor the Court to give its view -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Let's talk about \"moving\nparty.\" I -- I don't -- I don't know that \"moving\nparty\" means who comes into court first. I would -- I\nwould -- in the -- in the context of a contract dispute,\nI would say the moving party is the party who is trying\nto use principles of law to change the contract, and\nthat's the government here. The government -- the\ngovernment is blowing the whistle; it is the government\nwhich is saying you are in default, and under the law,\nsince you're in default, we can walk away, and indeed we\ncan claim the money we've already paid you.\nGENERAL KATYAL: Justice -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That seems to me the moving\nparty in the -- in the context of a contract.\nGENERAL KATYAL: Justice Scalia, I think\nit's important to add to your definition \"using legal\nprinciples in a Federal court,\" because that's I think\nwhat Reynolds is talking about. There's not some\nabstract moving -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Reynolds was talking about\nthat because that was the fact situation in Reynolds.\nBut I'm saying that the logic of the matter -- the logic\nof the matter when applied to a contract situation such\nas this ought to be the party who is blowing the\nwhistle, who is trying to use the law, the one -- the\none who is asserting that -- that the law requires this\nresult. And then we say, well, we can't tell whether\nthe law requires this result or not. That, it seems to\nme, ought to be the moment of truth.\nGENERAL KATYAL: I -- I don't think,\nJustice, that's what either Reynolds is getting at or\nwhat this Court's subsequent decisions about a state of\nuncertainty in the law and what the role of the Federal\ncourts is getting at. I think, rather, what all of\nthese decisions say together is if you don't know one\nway or another, you should return; you should wind the\nclock back to the status quo ante before the lawsuit was\nfiled. And at that status quo ante, there was undoubted\na right of the government to have $1.35 billion.\nNow, I understand some of you have\nsuggested, well, maybe we should just cut it even and\nthey get to keep the $1.35 billion and we get to keep -\nand we don't have to pay the $1.2 billion. I suggest\nthere's no principled way to do that, which is what I\nthink Mr. Phillips's answer -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It wasn't the undoubted\nright of the government before the lawsuit was filed.\nIt was the undoubted right of the lawsuit only if the\ncontracting officer was correct that there had been a\ndefault. If he was wrong about that, it was not the\nright of the government.\nGENERAL KATYAL: Justice Scalia, let me read\nto you the contract to which they agreed. It's at Joint\nAppendix, page 120 to '21: \"If the contract is\nterminated under the default clause, the contractor\nshall, on demand, repay to the government the amount of\nunliquidated progress payments.\"\nAnd then, what happened, as a result of that\ndemand letter that we sent right after the -- after the\ntermination for default, was they came to us, hat in\nhand, and said: Please don't take this money from us\nright now, our banks are going to complain, and so on.\nAnd so we entered into a deferment agreement -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought -\nGENERAL KATYAL: -- which is at page -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. Do you\nwant to give the cite?\nGENERAL KATYAL: Joint Appendix page 342.\nAnd it seems to me a very odd notion of due\nprocess to say that somehow the fact that we agreed to\ntheir deferment creates some entitlement for them to\nkeep the $1.35 billion.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I have this -- this\nquestion about due process: The components of the due\nprocess analysis, it seems to me, are what is\nreasonable, what's necessary in the case, what's\nunconscionable. That it seems to me is just an\nextrapolation of what Reynolds said, and I don't know\nwhy we don't have that just as a law of -- of -- the\nFederal common law of contracts. I don't know why we\nneed to elevate this to a due process analysis.\nGENERAL KATYAL: I guess I would say two\nthings. One is, if you look -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Assuming that we're -- we\napply Reynolds, which -\nGENERAL KATYAL: Right. And I think if you\n-- if you were to look to that background common law\ncontract principle, you would look not just to Reynolds\nbut to Tenet -- or excuse me, Totten, which I think\nmakes clear that, at the time they signed their\ncontract, they were on notice that highly classified\ninformation that is the subject of -- of litigation is\nsomething that generally can't be litigated in the\nFederal court.\nAnd then, if you wanted to think about due\nprocess and the overlay of unconscionability or whatever\nwith respect to Federal contracts, you would ordinarily\nassume that the contract itself from highly\nsophisticated parties would work that out ahead of time.\nAnd so if they were concerned about this situation\nunfolding, they could have written into the contract\nthat they should get certain information and that if the\ngovernment invoked the state-secrets privilege, it would\nautomatically terminate the contract's default and\nconvert a default termination into a termination for\nconvenience.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So you're -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That just restates the\nquestion of what -- what do you do if you apply the\nReynolds principle to this case, and they would say,\nwell, you could have put it in your contract, too, and I\nthink that's almost a wash.\nGENERAL KATYAL: Well, I don't think it\ncomes out as a wash, Justice Kennedy, because I think\nthe contract is undoubtedly clear that, in order to\nchallenge the -- the decision of the contracting officer\nabout a default termination, they have to come into\nFederal court and invoke affirmatively, seek affirmative\njudicial relief from the Federal court, to change the\nworld. We don't have to do that.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Am I -- am I right that\nthis contract did specify certain information that the\ngovernment agreed to give the Petitioner?\nGENERAL KATYAL: That is correct. Some of\nthat is at Joint Appendix 137 to 140.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Phillips said the\nreason they couldn't specify this information is they\ndidn't know what it was.\nGENERAL KATYAL: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: They -- they didn't know\nwhat -- it was secret information. They didn't know -\nwouldn't even know what to ask for.\nGENERAL KATYAL: I have to say, it is a very\nodd thing to bid on a highly -- a multi-billion-dollar\ncontract on the assumption that they're going to get\nsome technology that they haven't even specified. I\nmean, this -- we're bidding for their research and\ndevelopment. They brought in Lockheed, who -- which had\nbuilt low-technology -- low-observability planes -\nprecisely for the reason that they said they'd have the\ntechnology. At Joint Appendix page 1087, you see their\nbid, their offer, and I don't think anyone held a gun to\ntheir back to say: Enter into this.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, but they -- they claim\nthat you knew that it was impossible to do what they\ncontracted with you to do at the weight of plane which\nthey promised to come across with. They say that you\nknew that because of -- of other contracts that you had\nhad, and yet didn't -- didn't tell them about it.\nGENERAL KATYAL: Justice Scalia, let me say\ntwo things. First, the impossibility of -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know whether that's\ntrue or not, and we're never going to know it's true,\nbecause you came in and blew the whistle and said:\nState-secrets privilege.\nGENERAL KATYAL: Two things. One is that\nimpossibility claim was separately litigated before the\nCourt of Federal Claims, along with 18 other claims of\ntheirs in defense to the 1.35 billion and this rest that\nwe've been talking about. They've had massive\nopportunities to litigate almost all of their\nchallenges, with the one exception being the superior\nknowledge aspect of this case, and much of that has\ntaken place in a highly classified environment. The\ntrial has taken place in -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Are you saying it was not\nimpossible to do it at that weight?\nGENERAL KATYAL: I'm saying -- well, at the\ninitial weight, we thought it was impossible and warned\nthem as such, and that's -- those are the citations in\nthe government's brief. But -- so -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: At the weight contracted\nfor?\nGENERAL KATYAL: And then we -- at the\nweight contracted for, we had warned them that it\nwasn't, and then later we relaxed to that weight\nspecification. So I'm not sure that is really present\none way or the other.\nBut our central submission to you, Justice\nScalia, is: If you're not sure, as you were saying to\nme -- you don't know who is right and who is wrong -\nthen the Federal court shouldn't be complicit in the\nprocess of siding and picking winners and losers in that\ncircumstance -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are you ever the -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: General, what would\nhappen -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are you ever the\nmoving party in the Court of Claims?\nGENERAL KATYAL: Sure. I could imagine that\nwe could be on a counterclaim, for example.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, on a\ncounterclaim, but that obviously means somebody else is\nthe moving party. They've raised the claim.\nGENERAL KATYAL: That's correct. The -- the\njurisdiction of the CFC -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If somebody wants to\nget money -- if somebody wants to get money from the\nFederal Government, they have to go to the Court of\nClaims, right?\nGENERAL KATYAL: That's correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: How do you -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So this is a pretty\nconvenient rule for you, right?\n(Laughter.)\nGENERAL KATYAL: Well, it's a convenient\nrule, Mr. Chief Justice, that they agreed to when they\nsigned the contract. The CDA was on the books. They\nknew the deal going in, which is if they wanted to\nchallenge the decision of the contracting officer, they\nwould have to come in.\nNow, you could have structured it very\ndifferently. You could have said we -- you know, that\nthere would have to be -- that -- that if there were a\ntermination for default, it would automatically change\ninto a termination for convenience -\nJUSTICE ALITO: But you have the burden\nof -- you had the burden of proof on the issue of\ndefault. That was known, too, wasn't it?\nGENERAL KATYAL: We have the burden of proof\non default, but not on superior knowledge, the precise\nquestion here. In their rule, if you -- if you follow\ntheir rule, they're asking the court to proceed\ncounterfactually and say that they are entitled to not\njust the 1.35, but the 1.2 billion on top of that, as if\nthey had proved their superior knowledge claim. And -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: General, what would -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you agree that -- do\nyou agree that there is nothing between -- I think\nJustice Scalia was asking Mr. Phillips, why can't we\njust say let's -- all bets are off, everybody go home\nwith what they have. But Mr. Phillips says there are\nonly these two things; there's either default\ntermination or termination for convenience, and nothing\nin between.\nDo you agree that that's the world that\nwe're dealing with, those two choices and nothing else?\nGENERAL KATYAL: I do agree that that is -\nthat's the way the contract is written. It\ndistinguished between those two and distinguished\nbetween liquidated payments -- as to which the\ngovernment has no right in the event of a default\ntermination, and we're not seeking that -- and\nunliquidated payments, as to which the government has an\nabsolute right at the moment the contracting officer\ndecides there has been a default termination.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't care how the\ncontract's written. I mean, if we're going to -- if\nwe're going to say that there's been a broken play, that\nwe're not going to try to apply the contract because we\ncan't tell who's in the right and who's in the wrong,\nit's totally irrelevant what the contract says. You\njust leave the parties where they are.\nGENERAL KATYAL: Justice Scalia, I am saying\nleave the parties where they are under the terms of the\ncontract. And -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're -\nGENERAL KATYAL: Well, that -- Justice\nScalia, I don't think that the Federal court should be\nin the business of micromanaging under the Due Process\nClause in a contractual situation with parties that can\nprotect themselves ex ante very easily. I mean, they\nsay -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: We can -- we can do it as\na member -- as a matter of the law of contracts. And\nwhen we look at the law of contracts in Reynolds,\nReynolds talked about the moving party, and I'm not --\nI'm not sure that that phrase either had or has really\ndefinable content in our law. It seems to me it's just\na question of the burden of persuasion.\nAt one point, the contractor has to proceed.\nHe makes -- it makes a certain showing, and the\ngovernment has to go back and forth. And if at some\npoint, the person with the burden of persuasion invokes\nthe privilege, then we have to ask whether it's\nfundamentally fair as a matter of the Federal law of\ncontracts.\nGENERAL KATYAL: So even if you followed\nthat reasoning -- and I don't think you should, for a\nreason I'll explain in a moment -- but they would still\nlose, because they still bear the burden of proof and\npersuasion on superior knowledge, the -- the excuse\nthat's at issue in this case.\nNow, I don't think that would be the rule,\nthat that's an appropriate rule, Justice Kennedy,\nbecause I think underlying Reynolds is this central\nproposition that a court shouldn't be involved,\nshouldn't be picking winning -- winners and losers\neither way, when the state of knowledge is unknowable.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So just to make sure I\nunderstand your argument, suppose that state secrets had\nprevented you from being able to prove your default\nclaim, that you were unable to make that showing because\nof state secrets. What would happen then?\nGENERAL KATYAL: Unable to make the showing\nin -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: That the -- that the -\nGENERAL KATYAL: -- in Federal court?\nJUSTICE KAGAN: That's right, that the\nsecrets that you were -- that you wanted to protect were\nactually the -- the key to your proving that there was a\ndefault.\nGENERAL KATYAL: Right. Well, in that\ncircumstance, again, the -- I think the case would be\ndismissed, because they would be coming in and seeking\naffirmative judicial relief to void the contracting\nofficer's decision and to get whatever damages they want\nand -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Let me make sure I\nunderstand, because that really does sound like a tails\nyou win, heads you win, whatever.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE KAGAN: You're saying that if the\nstate secrets prevented you from making your affirmative\ncase, you should win that one, too?\nGENERAL KATYAL: I think -- I think that\nthat would be -- the general proposition is if the\nFederal court can't know one way or another who's right\nand who's wrong, it shouldn't grant affirmative relief\nto a party, and that's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: To a moving party, and you\nare never the moving party.\n(Laughter.)\nGENERAL KATYAL: Well, again, Justice\nScalia, that's the contract they've signed. They could\nhave signed a different contract with different results.\nThey say -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, you seem -\nGENERAL KATYAL: -- we didn't have the\nability -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Did the contract -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, you can't ever\ngive -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice Kennedy -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Did the contract contain\nthe term \"moving party\"?\nGENERAL KATYAL: The contract didn't say\n\"moving party,\" but it did say who had to come into\nFederal court in order to challenge the decision of the\ncontracting officer. And that is a -- that -- that -\nand it puts that burden on them.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And now Justice\nSotomayor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's what I don't\nunderstand. Yes, the default provision is decided by\nthe contracting officer, but by law you can't collect on\nthat judgment once they file a complaint. So you can't\ndo anything until you get the court to affirm your\ndefault. You are asking for a legal declaration of\nbeing right, that they defaulted. That's -- you're the\none seeking -\nGENERAL KATYAL: Justice Sotomayor, this is\na very important question, and I think that that's the\nimpression left by their briefs and it's wrong. So the\nfiling of their claim -- their claim in the Court of\nFederal Claims they say vacated the contracting\nofficer's decision. That's wrong under the statute;\n605(b) in the -- in the Contracting Disputes Act says\nthat a clause can be put into the contract to continue\nit in effect and require performance even if there's an\nappeal to the Court of Federal Claims, and that\nprovision exists in this very contract. So -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. You're going\ntoo fast for me, and I don't think I remember this in\nyour reply brief.\nGENERAL KATYAL: Well, I think it is. It's\nin a footnote of our reply brief, and it cites to\n605(b). And our claim is that -- that that provision\nrequires -- right now we have an absolute entitlement to\nthe $1.35 billion. That is what the contract says.\nThat is what even the deferment agreement says that\nwe've entered into.\nSo we're not asking, Justice Sotomayor, for\nany affirmative judicial relief at all. We don't need\n-- we want the Court, as it does in state-secret cases\nsuch as Tenet, to stay out entirely and say -- to deny\nan audience to this case on the merits. And if you do\nwhat Mr. Phillips says or if you do what Justice Scalia\nsuggested, the kind of compromise option, that is\naffirmatively using the power of the Federal court,\ngranting him relief on a claim that he has not proven,\nand that is something I see -- I see zero precedent\nfor -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's granting nobody\nrelief. We're leaving you where you are. \"Get out of\nhere,\" is what we're saying.\n(Laughter.)\nGENERAL KATYAL: Justice Scalia, we have\nno -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We don't know what the\nanswer is, so go away; we leave you where you are.\n(Laughter.)\nGENERAL KATYAL: Justice -- Justice Scalia,\nwe have no problem with a go-away rule. And if you did\nthat and you returned to the status quo ante, we would\nhave that $1.35 billion. That is what the contract\nsays. That is what their own filing in September 16,\n1991, said before the Court of Federal Claims, when they\ncalled that $1.35 billion, quote, \"money presently due\nand owing.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That assumes that the\ncontracting officer's termination for default was valid.\nAnd we don't know that it was valid, and we don't want\nto have to inquire whether it was valid. So to say \"go\naway\" means everybody keeps the money he has.\nGENERAL KATYAL: Justice Scalia, that seems\nto me -- that is affirmatively using the power of the\nCourt to set aside the contracting officer's decision,\nwhich is what I think is forbidden by Reynolds. And it\nwould be an odd rule, because it's basically a\nhappenstance. If we had just simply insisted on our\n$1.35 billion at the moment that it was owed to us in\nFebruary of 1991, we wouldn't even be having this\nconversation right now. The only reason we're having it\nis because we acceded to their own request to not take\nthe $1.35 billion right away.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How would you write\n-- you keep saying these are sophisticated parties.\nWhat would the contractual term look like that would\navoid this problem?\nGENERAL KATYAL: Oh, I think it would be\nvery simple. You could say: In the event the\ngovernment invokes the state-secrets privilege, any\ntermination for default automatically becomes a\ntermination for convenience. That's one of many.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think your\nclient would ever agree to something like that?\nGENERAL KATYAL: Do I think the government\nwould?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.\nGENERAL KATYAL: Well, I think if they\ndon't, Mr. Chief Justice, that underscores the problem\nwith their argument, because they are saying: Read the\ncontract precisely this way, to eliminate terminations\nfor default and convert them all into terminations for\nconvenience when the state-secrets privilege is being\ninvoked. And I agree with you. I think that would be a\nvery unusual contract for the government to get into.\nThat is what they're demanding here, and that's\nstrictly -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So how do they write\nthe contract? If they -- your answer can't be the only\nway they can write it is a way that you'd never accept.\nSo how -- how do you contract around this problem?\nGENERAL KATYAL: Well -- well, I think there\nare other ways. There's the possibility that they may\ndemand extra money in exchange for greater risk. There\nmay be that there may be some alternative dispute\nresolution mechanisms available. I don't know, but I\nwould -- I would -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This wouldn't be a\nproblem in an alternative dispute resolution because\nthat's not a court?\nGENERAL KATYAL: Well, it might depend on -\nyou might have it within the military, you know, the\nequivalent of that -- in the Tenet v. Doe, you might\nhave panels like the Helms panel. I'm not sure what the\nprecise contractual arrangements would be. I do think\nthat the need for this Court to be involved is a lot\nlower than, say, in the criminal context of Reynolds,\nbecause the government here is a repeat player with\nthese contractors. They're not in the business, as our\ndeferment agreement, I think, underscores of trying to\nwilly-nilly advance the state-secrets privilege to\nundermine and take their money away.\nIndeed, I think since the 2003 Federal\nCircuit decision, there have only been a couple of\ninstances, at most, in which -- that I'm aware of in\nwhich the government has invoked the state-secrets\nprivilege in any sort of contracting action, and nothing\nlike this superior knowledge thing. And since 2009, the\ngovernment, all together in civil court, has invoked the\nstate-secrets privilege a whopping two times, to -- to\nmy knowledge.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So it isn't -- it isn't a\nbig practical problem. All right. Let me ask then, I\nwas -- misimpression. Would you go back to Justice\nKennedy's question for a minute? I'm -- I -- I don't\nquite see -- if you would discuss it a little bit -- how\nyou do this as a matter of constitutional law, because\nthe Due Process Clause is tied to fundamental\nunfairness, and I think the answer has to be in this\nkind of circumstance, secret block or not, it depends.\nIt depends on many things.\nSo, would you write this as a matter of\nconstitutional law? Would it -- shouldn't it be written\nas a matter of Federal common law of contracts?\nShouldn't it be written as an exposition of the superior\nknowledge doctrine, which seems totally open to it?\nAnd -- or shouldn't it be written as a matter of\ndiscovery law, which is what the district judge who\nended up thinking -- the Court of Claims judge says,\ngee, I don't really know.\nI mean, that's how I read it. How would you\n-- would you speak about this for a minute?\nGENERAL KATYAL: Sure. Justice Breyer, I\nthink that due process is an ill-fitting concept in this\ncontractual dispute for a couple of reasons. Not just\ncan the sophisticated parties agree ahead of time to\nother things, but also the whole notion of due process\nin contracts is odd, because the government has waived\nits sovereign immunity only since 1855. They don't have\nany freestanding right to come in ab initio and claim\nfundamental fairness on contracts. I think that is\nimplicit in the Constitution itself, that they don't\nhave that right.\nAnd so, the question becomes, is there some\nextra protection the courts should give here akin to the\none in Reynolds about criminal defendants in the\ngovernment using state-secrets information? And I think\nthe answer to that is \"no,\" because parties can work\nthat out themselves ex ante.\nAnd so, my answer to you is -- I think it\nwas option B -- to use the contract as the -- and\ncontractual interpretation as the basic rule for a\ndecision here. The contract itself specified -- and it\nwas done under the shadow of Reynolds and under the\nshadow of -- of Totten that specified that they would\nhave to be the moving party. They would have to come in\nand challenge the decision of the contracting officer --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, in a whole law of\ncontracts, you could say, oh, the contracting parties\ncould have put this down, anticipatory breach, we don't\nneed to have rules on that, that the parties could have\nnegotiated that. That's not the way the contract law\nworks.\nGENERAL KATYAL: Well, I do think that with\nrespect to this, in this -- you know,\nthousands-and-thousands-of-page contract, I think that\nthis specific set of issues could have been worked out\nin advance and, I do think, was worked out in advance.\nThey knew, going in, that they bore the burden of\nwalking into court, paying their attorneys, and\neverything else, to challenge the decision of the\ncontracting officer. And they also knew at that moment\nthe government had an undoubted right to the\nunliquidated progress payments.\nThe contract they signed distinguished\nbetween liquidated progress payments, as to which the\ngovernment has no right, and unliquidated payments, as\nto which default termination automatically gave that to\nthe government. And the argument they're advancing here\nis, well, let's collapse those two; let's keep the $1.35\nbillion, because the government hasn't given it to us\nyet.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why is that unliquidated?\nI didn't get the distinction between -- why is the 1.35\nunliquidated?\nGENERAL KATYAL: Because the contract\nspecified two payment streams. One is the work that\nthey had reviewed and understood and said -- the\ngovernment had said this is good work, we're going to\npay you for it; and other work which are claims that\nthey have made but they haven't actually been approved\nby the government. And I think Mr. Phillips -- I don't\nthink that there's any sort of evidence that -- or\ncertainly nothing that the courts below found that says\nthat the -- that they had a right to the\nunliquidated progress payments.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What's the other? What's\nthe -- what's the other 1.25 billion -\nGENERAL KATYAL: The 1.2 -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that he's also asking\nfor?\nGENERAL KATYAL: The 1.2 billion that he's\nseeking on top of -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nGENERAL KATYAL: -- keeping 1.35 billion, as\nI understand it, is costs -- is extra costs incurred\nunder the contract above and beyond the $4.8 billion\nthat was in the initial contract.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: General, do you have the\ncitation to that footnote you referred to in the -- the\n605(b)? I can find it later, but -\nGENERAL KATYAL: It's page 32, and I'd also\nrefer the Court to the court of appeals appendix page\n19567, which is the page of the contract itself that\nincorporates the provision. The provision is\nFAR 52.233-1(h), and it says that -- it mandates\nperformance and compliance with the contract even when\nthere -- in the contracting officer's decision, even\nwhen a decision is under appeal.\nSo it is not the case whatsoever that their\nfiling of this claim somehow vacated the contracting\nofficer's decision. The only way that will happen is if\nthis Federal Court reverses the Federal Circuit -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So your view is that -\nGENERAL KATYAL: -- and grants them\naffirmative -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- that the complaint\ndid not stay their obligation to pay you; that provision\nrequired them to pay you -\nGENERAL KATYAL: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- the -- the\nunliquidated sums?\nGENERAL KATYAL: That's right. At that\nmoment they had to pay. They knew that, and they in\nfact sent a bank letter and so on -- this is Joint\nAppendix 329 -- saying please don't do that. And then\nwe entered into a deferment agreement, but we have an\nabsolute right to that money right now regardless of\nwhat -- we don't need an affirmative decision from this\nCourt in order to get that money. We're asking the\nCourt to simply stay its hand and follow the Hippocratic\nprinciple of doing no harm in a world in which the -\nthe Court can't decide who's right and who's wrong.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If that -- if you're\nright about that, the government's absolute right, could\nyou withhold it from other contracts of these\ncontractors?\nGENERAL KATYAL: That's absolutely right.\nThe -- the Federal rules and the Contract Disputes Act\nprovide us an offset so that we could -- we don't have\nto actually seek the 1.35 billion from their coffers, as\nhe colorfully called it, \"reaching into\"; we can just\noffset it against future contracts, and the Federal\ncourts would be out of the business altogether about\nthat 1.35 billion.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you get the extra\nmoney without having to go to court because then they'd\nhave to go to court and challenge your offset?\nGENERAL KATYAL: And, again, Mr. Chief\nJustice, that's the contract to which they signed.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.\nMr. Phillips, you have 3 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nJustice Kennedy, I think the answer to your\nquestion is that this case can properly be decided on\nFederal common law principles, and indeed I would ask\nthe Court to apply those same -- those contract\nprinciples in this context to -- it's just on the Joint\nAppendix on page 209.\nGeneral Katyal focuses on what happens when\nthe contracting officer takes some action. What he\nleaves out is the following sentence: The contractor\nshall have the right of appeal under the disputes clause\nfrom any determination by the contracting officer.\nAnd while the General spends an awful lot of\ntime talking about what do you do in the Article III\ncontext, the Contracting Disputes Act specifically\nallows to us go to a board of contract appeals, which is\nnot an Article III institution. And I guarantee you\nthat the government would be making exactly the same\nargument if we had taken that particular route.\nIt seems to me the case ought not to be\ndecided on the basis of this kind of a technical\nassessment. The case ought to be decided on the basis\nof sort of where the rights are and what's the\nfundamental change and who's making the shift in one\ndirection or the other.\nAnd if you do that -- and Justice Ginsburg,\nyou specifically asked the question, am I asking for all\nor nothing? No. I think there's no question you can\ncome up with a principled basis to adopt precisely the\nprinciple that Justice Scalia pointed out, which is to\nsay we will stay our hand, we'll -- we will not uphold\nthe -- the contracting officer's decision, and therefore\nwe're not going to say there's a default -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you say -\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- but we're not going to go\nthe extra mile and say it's a termination for\nconvenience. The Court can certainly do that.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So you are saying there\nis another way? There's a middle way?\nMR. PHILLIPS: There is a middle way.\nThere's no question about it. All I was saying in\nresponse to Justice Scalia's question was, you know --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: On what principle of\nlaw?\nMR. PHILLIPS: On the principle of law that\nif you don't have a contract for default, then there's\nno basis for -- and we're not going to do any more than\nthat; we can't decide who's right and who's wrong, and\ntherefore we're not going to enforce the contracting\nofficer's decision, or we're not going to do anything\nmore than this. We're going to leave the status quo\nante, which means before the contracting officer\ndeclared that there was a default under these\ncircumstances.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's the \"go away\"\nprinciple of our jurisprudence, right?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. PHILLIPS: I actually get that a lot,\nJustice Scalia.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Phillips, I understood\nyour papers as making only a constitutional claim.\nMR. PHILLIPS: No. I don't read that,\nJustice Kagan. I mean, we -- we certainly have a due\nprocess argument in there, but embedded in there as well\nis -- are a number of references to Federal common law\nprinciples as a -- as a -- obviously nonconstitutional\nbasis on which to rule in our favor.\nAnd I -- I mean, I think the Court ought to\nbe informed in -- in making its determination about how\nto interpret the contracting arrangement by the question\nof whether this is fundamentally unfair and\nunconscionable, obviously, but you would probably do\nthat as a matter of Federal common law principles in\ntrying to decide on the -- on contracting principles or\nnot.\nAt the end of the day, Your Honors, this has\nbeen fundamentally unfair, and we would ask for the\nCourt to reverse.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nPhillips, General.\n"
