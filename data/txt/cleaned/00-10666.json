INGRAM\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. INGRAM: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe petitioner in this case is asking the Court\nto rule that the brandish clause of 18 United States Code,\nSection 924(c) is an element to be charged and proved\nbeyond a reasonable doubt and not merely a sentencing\nenhancement, based on two separate and independent bases.\nThe first is the statutory analysis under Jones v. United\nStates, and the second basis is the constitutional\nanalysis under Apprendi v. New Jersey. And I will address\nthe Jones argument first.\nThe carjacking statute in Jones v. United States\nhad, as additional elements, serious injury and death,\nwhich the Court held to be additional elements after the\nstatutory analysis was completed. And the carjacking\nstatute in that case and 18 United States Code, section\n924(c) in this case are virtually mirror images of each\nother structurally and grammatically.\nThe Court looked at the text of the statute, the\nlegislative history behind those facts, and how\nlegislatures historically had treated those facts in\ndetermining that serious injury and death were, in fact,\nelements to be proved and not merely sentencing\nenhancements.\nLikewise, we contend that brandish, based on the\n-- the text of the statute, the -- how legislatures have\ntypically treated that fact and the fact that it involves\na mens rea element -- that is, brandish is -- is defined\nas displaying or making the presence known of a firearm in\norder to intimidate and -- and mens rea has traditionally\nbeen an element -- and then based on the legislative\nhistory that those statutes would lead the Court to\nconclude, based on the statutory analysis, that brandish\nis in fact an element to be proved and not merely a\nsentencing enhancement.\nQUESTION: But it's not so -- it seems to me\nthat -- I understand your argument, but it's not so clear\nas it was in Jones. I mean, the difference between use\nand brandish is -- is a -- is a smaller difference in\ndegree. The difference in the penalties are smaller\ndifferences. It's just a couple of years, the difference\nbetween 5 and -- and 7, for example. And -- and I\nunderstand how you can make the argument, but I don't see\nthe argument as being sort of a slam dunk in the case.\nMR. INGRAM: Your Honor, if I may address each\nof those concerns. The -- first of all, the -- the fact\nthat the increase under the brandish statute goes from a\nmandatory minimum of 5 to a mandatory minimum of -- of 7\nnot being a steep increase, first of all, it does take the\ndefendant 40 percent higher for brandishing from 5 to 7,\nand -- and it doubles the penalty 100 percent higher for\ndischarging the firearm, which cannot be divorced from the\nbrandishing element.\nThere are cases from this Court in the context\nof ex post facto challenges to application of sentences\nthat were enacted after the defendant committed the crime,\nmost particularly Miller v. Florida, the leading case\nwhich we cite in our brief, where the Court held that an\nincrease in a sentence of anywhere from two to two and a\nhalf years substantially disadvantaged the defendant and\nforeclosed the defendant from asking for a lower sentence.\nLikewise, in the case of Glover v. United\nStates, which we do not cite in our brief -- that is at\n531 U.S. 198 -- the Court held, in the context of a\nchallenge of ineffective assistance of counsel, that an\nadditional guideline sentence under the Federal sentencing\nguidelines of anywhere from 6 to 21 months meets the\nsubstantial prejudice prong of the ineffective assistance\nof counsel claim. So, we contend that the increase from 5\nto 7 years is in fact a -- a substantial difference.\nThe elements in question, comparing serious\nbodily injury and death to brandishing, are somewhat\ndifferent in that the serious bodily injury and death are\nresults, whereas brandish and discharge are conduct of the\ndefendant. But we contend that the brandish and discharge\nbeing treated more seriously are seeking to address the\nsame possible results; that is, if a defendant merely\ncarries a firearm or possesses a firearm, it is far less\nlikely that serious bodily injury or death will result\nthan if the defendant brandishes or discharge --\ndischarges --\nQUESTION: Can I -- can I go to Apprendi?\nBecause the -- I want to just focus you a little bit,\nassuming you lose on this argument. I want to know -- and\nthis is hard for me because I dissented in Apprendi. I\nwant to know how you, as a person living with the case,\nunderstands it.\nImagine two statutes. I just want to know if\nyou think Apprendi applies to the second of the two\nstatutes. The first statute says the sentence is up to 10\nyears for robbery, but if a gun is discharged, up to 15.\nThere's no question that Apprendi applies to that second.\nDoesn't it?\nMR. INGRAM: I agree with that.\nQUESTION: That's what Apprendi is about.\nNow, suppose I take that same statute and I just\nrewrite the words as follows. The maximum for this crime\nof robbery is 15, but unless a gun is discharged, you\nshall not sentence to more than 10. Now, is that second\nstatute treated identically to the first in your\nunderstanding and the understanding of the bar? That's\nwhat I'm trying to get at.\nMR. INGRAM: Yes. My understanding is that\nApprendi would cover the --\nQUESTION: Both.\nMR. INGRAM: -- latter statute that you have\ndescribed.\nQUESTION: Both. So, the wording of it doesn't\nmatter.\nMR. INGRAM: No. I contend that it -- it does\nnot.\nQUESTION: All right. Now, if that's the case,\nI'd also like -- and this is my other -- only other\nquestion. I'd -- I'd like to get your understanding. The\ndefense bar, I understand, of which you're an important\npart, wants this extended, and my question is why.\nAnd this is my, why -- what I have trouble\nseeing in this. It seems to me as a practical matter\nwhat's likely to happen is the prosecutor will come in,\nand it's primarily about drug cases. And they'll say,\nfine, we'll go to the jury. You want a trial? Fine. You\nsay you were in Chicago? Fine. We say that there were\ntwo kilos of drugs, and then you have to get in front of\nthe jury and argue my client was in Chicago, but just in\ncase he happened to be around, there was only one kilo.\nNow, that's impossible for you to argue.\nNow, given that kind of problem, why does the\ndefense bar, why do you, and why does everyone else -- why\nare they so anxious to extend this case?\nMR. INGRAM: Your Honor, that is not a problem\nthat the defense bar does not already face. In -- in the\ncontext that you described in a drug case, in Federal\ncourt now the evidence presented at trial will involve\nboth possession with intent to distribute evidence, as\nwell as quantity evidence.\nQUESTION: Yes, but still under the present law,\nif you have a good claim as to whether it's one kilo or\ntwo and the evidence is in dispute, you find the guilty\nverdict come in. At that point, you go to the judge and\nyou say, now, judge, we want -- we want to go into the\nevidence here about how much drug there really was. You\ncan't do that if you have to do it all at the same time in\nfront of the jury.\nMR. INGRAM: As a practical matter, in Federal\ncourt, the -- the Federal judges at sentencing rely on the\ntrial evidence. So, a defense attorney knows during trial\nthat I am hearing evidence about quantity that I want to\ndispute because I know it's going to come up later in a\nsentencing hearing, but I don't dare do that here because\nI am telling the jury that there was no possession at all.\nSo, it is a dilemma that we face now and -- and faces\nattorneys, for example, in cases where you admit my client\ndid kill someone, but not with malice aforethought. Quite\noften you do have to negate additional elements, and you\ndo have that dilemma already. This would not create any\nnew dilemma for us.\nQUESTION: Well, let me rephrase Justice\nBreyer's question slightly or -- or make the point that I\nthink underlies part of his question.\nApprendi is not a -- true or false? Apprendi is\nnot an unmixed blessing for the defense bar.\nMR. INGRAM: I think it can create some\nproblems, as we just described, but they're not problems\nthat we don't face in other areas and on other --\nQUESTION: Well, given Apprendi, of course, you\nface the problem. But looking at Apprendi as an original\nmatter, which we cannot -- which I think we're unlikely to\ndo, it -- it has -- it imposes some real disadvantages on\ndefendants, does it not?\nMR. INGRAM: I do not think they're real\ndisadvantages. I think they're just -- they're just some\n-- some difficulties that defense attorneys face all the\ntime.\nQUESTION: Well, but the case Justice Breyer\nputs to you shows a very real difficulty.\nMR. INGRAM: And as I've described, that is a\ndifficulty that we face already. And -- and the\nimportant --\nQUESTION: Because of Apprendi.\nMR. INGRAM: No, Your Honor. Before Apprendi.\nThat problem faced defense attorneys in -- in a number of\ncontexts. And -- and we're really more concerned here not\nso much with the problems it creates, because they're not\nnew problems, but with -- with the fact that mandatory\nminimums add additional deprivations of liberty that\nshould be addressed by the jury and found beyond a\nreasonable doubt and not -- not left to the discretion of\ntrial judges, based on the case law of this Court,\nincluding Apprendi itself.\nWe are relying on the constitutional rule\nannounced in Apprendi. Prior to Apprendi, in -- in\nMcMillan and Patterson, the Court had acknowledged that\nthere were some limits, some constitutional limits to what\na legislature could do in defining the elements of a\ncrime. But it -- the Court had never announced exactly\nwhat those limits are.\nNow, it is true that Apprendi was limited to an\nincrease in statutory maximums because that is what the\ncase was about. Those were the facts of the case. But\nthe constitutional rule that was the underpinning of the\nApprendi holding was that as -- as stated by the majority\nin endorsing the concurring opinions in Jones as follows,\nit is unconstitutional for a legislature to remove from\nthe jury the assessment of facts that increase the\nprescribed range of penalties to which a criminal\ndefendant is exposed, and equally clear that they must be\nproved beyond a reasonable doubt.\nSo, the constitutional rule of Apprendi was any\nfact that increases the range, either the floor or the\nceiling, of the prescribed penalties are constitutionally\nelements that must be alleged by the defendant -- by the\nprosecution in the charging document and must be proved.\nQUESTION: What about things like the Federal\nSentencing Guidelines which also have the effect of\nincreasing the range of the penalty within certain limits?\nThere are lots of factors there that under the guidelines\nthe judge would still decide. Under your argument,\nApprendi would throw all those out. It has to go to the\njury.\nMR. INGRAM: I disagree, Your Honor, and --\nQUESTION: Why?\nMR. INGRAM: -- and I do agree with your\nstatement that there are lots of things that the\nguidelines allow the judges to consider.\nFirst of all, mandatory minimums are just that.\nThey are mandatory. They do not allow a judge to consider\nany mitigating factor, however strongly the judge may --\nmay believe in those mitigating factors, to go below. The\nsentencing guidelines, first of all, expressly allow the\njudge to consider a number of aggravating and mitigating\nfactors.\nQUESTION: But they may be unconstitutional\nunder your theory.\nMR. INGRAM: They are not because we contend\nthat the guidelines, unlike mandatory minimums, still\nleave the judge with lots of discretion. In Koon v.\nUnited States, this Court --\nQUESTION: The question is under your theory of\nApprendi, which imposes constitutional limits on\ndiscretion for judges, that can be given to judges, how\nmany of the sentencing factors are going to fall by the\nwayside?\nMR. INGRAM: I -- I submit that none of them\nwill because none of those factors mandate a particular\npenalty to the exclusion of any mitigating offense. For\nexample, under the drug guideline, if the defendant\npossessed a firearm, then in a sense a two-level increase\nis mandated or called for, but that nevertheless still\nallows the judge, without a Koon discretionary\ndeparture --\nQUESTION: Well, that's exactly the kind of\nthing that presumably under your argument would have to go\nto the jury, whether he possessed a firearm, or the\nquantity of drugs involved.\nMR. INGRAM: No, it is not, Your Honor, because\nthe judge in such a case would still have the ability to\ndepart, or first of all, to reduce the offense level for\nother mitigating facts in the case.\nQUESTION: You're -- you're saying that just the\nlevel is kind of inchoate until the sentence comes out\nbecause there are other factors that could be applied?\nMR. INGRAM: The -- the sentencing guideline\nrange, once established, is mandatory unless and until the\njudge determines that there is a legally permissible basis\nto depart downward or upward. And Koon recognized that\nthere are innumerable bases for allowing the judge to\nexercise that discretion.\nQUESTION: So long as -- so long as the upward\nor downward departure is there, you say Apprendi doesn't\ncover it.\nMR. INGRAM: That's correct.\nQUESTION: Or downward, anyway.\nQUESTION: Oh, I see now.\nQUESTION: Downward or upward? Or upward?\nQUESTION: I said upward or downward.\nQUESTION: I know. And he agreed.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: I'm surprised that he agrees. I -- I\nwould think you would -- you would say that -- that it's\nonly the downward that -- that saves the guidelines.\nMR. INGRAM: Well, I think it is in this case.\nThe -- the fact that the judge can depart downward --\nQUESTION: I mean, suppose a judge could not\ndepart downward under the guidelines, could only -- only\ndepart upward, you'd have a mandatory minimum, wouldn't\nyou?\nMR. INGRAM: You would have. But that --\nthat --\nQUESTION: Okay. So -- so, what you agree with\nis that so long as the judge, under the guidelines, has\nthe option of departing downward, you wouldn't -- this\ncase would not necessarily decide the guidelines.\nMR. INGRAM: That is correct.\nQUESTION: Suppose --\nQUESTION: How -- how does a judge have the\nopportunity to depart downward under the guideline if the\nguideline says if he had a gun, you're supposed to go up?\nI just don't understand your argument at all.\nMR. INGRAM: Because that --\nQUESTION: -- purpose is if he has a gun, you\nincrease it. Why isn't that an Apprendi thing under your\ntheory?\nMR. INGRAM: Because the judge still -- that --\nthat does not bind the judge at that level. The judge\nstill --\nQUESTION: Suppose -- suppose the judge says,\nnow, it's the policy in this court and in this\njurisdiction, counsel, that if you come in and your\ndefendant has a gun or has brandished a gun, I'm going to\ngo upward. I want you to know that. Then the case is\ndecided, and he said, you know, I would have given your\ncounsel -- your client six months if he hadn't brandished\nthe gun, but he brandished that gun: 5 years. And you\ncontend he didn't brandish the gun. Why shouldn't\nApprendi control that?\nMR. INGRAM: Because the -- the constitutional\nrule announced by the Court is that if a legislature\nmandates an increase in the prescribed range of penalties.\nIn the case you've described, Your Honor, the judge,\nalthough he says I would still -- I will always go up, he\n-- he still has the freedom to not go up.\nQUESTION: So --\nMR. INGRAM: And -- and he is subject to an\nabuse of discretion standard on appeal.\nQUESTION: So -- so, in your view, Apprendi\nstands for the proposition that legislatures cannot\ncontrol judges in the sentencing process.\nMR. INGRAM: No. My -- my -- in a sense that is\ntrue. My position is constitutionally that legislatures\nhave the power to determine what conduct they're going to\ncriminalize and to define the elements and the prescribed\npunishment for those elements as long as it is not cruel\nand unusual.\nQUESTION: Well, I -- I think Apprendi is\nclearly binding here, and -- and we have to decide how --\nhow it should be applied.\nI -- I do have some problems in -- in this case\nbecause of the fact that I think the statute is a little\nbit different than Jones. I -- I don't agree that it's\nstructurally the same. And I really don't see why this\nshouldn't apply where judges have discretion.\nMR. INGRAM: Is your question why would this --\nwhy would the Apprendi doctrine not apply where the judge\nhas discretion?\nQUESTION: That's part of my concern, yes.\nMR. INGRAM: Well, I think the answer to that is\nthat constitutionally the -- the rule announced in\nApprendi is that where a legislature mandates a particular\nmandatory minimum or maximum, then that is where the\nconstitutional demands that the -- those facts be tried by\nbeyond a reasonable doubt --\nQUESTION: Where -- where a judge has\ndiscretion, I suppose no single fact requires a certain\nsentence. Isn't that right?\nMR. INGRAM: That's correct.\nQUESTION: By definition, where the judge has\ndiscretion, no single fact requires a certain sentence.\nMR. INGRAM: That is correct.\nQUESTION: But as a practical matter, even in --\nin this, suppose this judge thought that the -- Harris\nshould not have gotten more than 5 years. So, he says,\nwell, the evidence of brandishing could go either way, so\nI want to give him 5 years. I'll find -- I won't find\nbrandishing. That kind of discretion you -- the\nprosecutor I suppose couldn't say anything about.\nA judge -- a judge has that discretion no matter what\nthe legislature rules are. He can say, it's a close\nquestion whether brandishing exists. Therefore, I will\nnot find brandishing. That will bring him down to the 5-\nyear level. Right?\nMR. INGRAM: That is true. If he -- if he --\nQUESTION: It's true? A judge -- a judge has\ndiscretion, when he's making factual findings, to say what\nis false? Even though he thinks one -- one fact is true,\nhe has discretion to say that it's not true?\nMR. INGRAM: No. Your Honor, I don't mean to\nsay that he has discretion to make fact finding. That --\nthat is always --\nQUESTION: That was the question. Does the\njudge have discretion to say, even though I know there was\nbrandishing, I'm going to say there wasn't brandishing.\nHe doesn't have the kind of discretion.\nMR. INGRAM: No, he does not, and I\nmisunderstood the question then.\nQUESTION: No. I didn't say that even if he\nknew. I said if the judge said, well, it's a -- it's a\ntough question, so I'm not going to -- I'm not going to\nmake up my mind on it.\nMR. INGRAM: Our position is once the judge does\nconclude, by a preponderance of the evidence, that\nbrandishing exists, he has no authority to give anything\nless than the mandatory minimum, no matter what other\nmitigating facts he may conclude may be present in the\ncase.\nQUESTION: What you're saying is he has to --\nMR. INGRAM: He is bound by that.\nQUESTION: What you're saying is he has to be\nhonest when he decides the brandishing issue.\nMR. INGRAM: Yes.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nQUESTION: And I suppose he has to confront the\nbrandishing issue. He can't say, it's a tough question,\nso you know, I'm not going to -- I'm not going to face it.\nThe law requires him to -- to decide whether there's been\nbrandishing or not, doesn't it?\nMR. INGRAM: Yes, it does, by a preponderance of\nthe evidence standard. And we contend where the -- under\nthe constitutional rule in Apprendi, that increasing the\nmandatory minimum makes that fact an element that must be\nfound not by a preponderance of the evidence, but by the\nfact finder at trial beyond a reasonable doubt. All the\nmore important, because in this case, the judge noted that\nit was a close case, and therefore the standard of review\nbecomes all the more important in -- as illustrated by\nthis case that --\nQUESTION: Close on brandishing. But he also\nsaid, I would have given this guy 7 years no matter what;\nApprendi, without Apprendi, 7 years is what I think is\nright for him. Isn't --\nMR. INGRAM: That is what -- that is what he at\nleast implied strongly. But he cannot do that -- if -- if\nwe prevail here and we go back for a resentencing, the\njudge is not going to be able to give more than 5 years.\nThat is the -- the guideline sentence. There's no\nguideline range for this. The guideline is the mandatory\nminimum sentence.\nThe judge will not be allowed to give more than 5\nyears unless he identifies a legally permissible basis for\nan upward departure. And in that case, he can increase\nabove the 5-year mandatory minimum.\nQUESTION: Suppose on -- on remand, if you\nprevail here, -- well, I guess there would have to be a\nnew -- a new trial on the sentencing point. But suppose\nthe judge says, you know, the jury has found there's no\nbrandishing because he displayed it but they didn't think\nthat was brandishing under my instructions. But he did\nhave a gun and he did show it, and even if that isn't\nbrandishing, I'm going to up it to 7 years. He can do\nthat?\nMR. INGRAM: If I understand Your Honor's\nquestion, then yes. If a jury concluded that the\ndefendant --\nQUESTION: No brandishing.\nMR. INGRAM: -- did not brandish -- that is, if\nit was considered to be an element and the jury determined\nthat he did not brandish -- then first of all, he would be\nnot guilty of the crime, because that would be an element\nthat must be proved, and any element that is not proved\nbeyond a reasonable doubt means that he would be not\nguilty of the crime.\nBut if there, for example, was some accompanying\ncharge that the defendant was found guilty of and not the\nbrandishing, then certainly the judge would have the\ndiscretion to consider whether the firearm was brandished\nor discharged.\nQUESTION: Are you saying that if he were\ncharged with this offense and charged specifically with\nbrandishing, and the jury found him not to have\nbrandished, he would have to be acquitted?\nMR. INGRAM: That is correct.\nQUESTION: Wouldn't -- wouldn't there be a\nlesser included offense of everything in the statute\nexcept brandishing?\nMR. INGRAM: Well, that is true. By saying he\nwould be acquitted and found not guilty, it would be of\nthe separate offense of brandishing the firearm.\nQUESTION: But -- but the prosecution would be\nentitled to a charge on a lesser included offense.\nMR. INGRAM: That is correct. That is correct.\nQUESTION: But -- but wait. But you would allow\nthe judge to increase his sentence on the basis of the\njudge's belief that he was brandishing?\nMR. INGRAM: Yes. That -- that is -- although I\ndo not agree with --\nQUESTION: Well --\nMR. INGRAM: -- with that policy, nevertheless\nthat is -- that is the case under the status of the law\nnow. Where a defendant is found not guilty, for example,\nof substantive drug offenses, at sentencing, the judge is\nallowed to conclude beyond -- by a preponderance of the\nevidence that those quantities were possessed and, in\nfact, should count against the defendant for sentencing\npurposes.\nQUESTION: Well, I'm quite surprised at that. I\n-- I tried to phrase my -- my question to get around that.\nI said the judge accepts the jury finding that there was\nno brandishing, but everybody agrees that he did at least\nhave a gun and so he's going to increase it for that.\nThat was my hypothetical. But in answer to Justice\nScalia, you said the judge could say I think there's\nbrandishing by a preponderance of the evidence. I'm\nsurprised at that.\nMR. INGRAM: We are suggesting that brandishing\nmust be proved --\nQUESTION: That's this Court's case I take it --\nQUESTION: That -- that -- I --\nQUESTION: -- which maybe we should reconsider.\nQUESTION: Why don't you let him answer? Answer\nJustice Kennedy's question.\nMR. INGRAM: By -- by saying that the brandish\nmust be an element to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt,\nwe are not contending that if the jury finds the defendant\nnot guilty on that particular element, that the judge\nmight not be able to consider, by a preponderance of the\nevidence, that fact, in -- in addition to any other number\nof mitigating and aggravating facts, in -- in determining\nthe appropriate sentence.\nQUESTION: I'm surprised at that.\nQUESTION: But the appropriate sentence within\nhis discretion.\nMR. INGRAM: That is correct. That is correct.\nHe could not --\nQUESTION: And -- and it is true that under the\nguidelines a judge can find something that the jury didn't\nfind because the standards are different, beyond a\nreasonable doubt in the one case, and the judge said,\nwell, I'm -- I would think, too, it wasn't proved beyond a\nreasonable doubt, but there is a preponderance of the\nevidence. Therefore, I find it, for purposes of my\nguideline calculation. That's -- that's quite common,\nisn't it?\nMR. INGRAM: It is -- it is quite common that\nthe judge finds by a preponderance of the evidence both\nconduct that was not even charged and conduct that was\ncharged and -- of which the defendant was found not\nguilty, because of the difference in the standard of\nproof.\nQUESTION: So -- so --\nMR. INGRAM: That is -- that is -- I'm not happy\nwith that either, but that is the case law and that is the\nlaw as -- as it stands.\nQUESTION: So, what have you accomplished if --\nif they just rewrite the guidelines to say you get 5 years\nfor brandishing?\nMR. INGRAM: What we will have accomplished --\nQUESTION: The consequence will be that even if\nthe jury finds no brandishing as an element of the crime,\nthe -- the judge may -- and indeed, under the guidelines,\nmust -- add 5 years for brandishing if he thinks, by a\npreponderance of the evidence, there was brandishing,\nwhich is the situation you're in now.\nQUESTION: And if I can pile onto Justice\nScalia's question, you now have the worst of both worlds\nbecause you have the disadvantages we referred to at\nfirst, and yet the judge can still go upward.\nMR. INGRAM: No, Your Honor, it does not. If\nthis is an element to be proved at trial, and the finder\nof fact determines beyond a reasonable doubt that the --\nthe Government has failed to find beyond a reasonable\ndoubt that he brandished, then he can only be sentenced\nfor the carry and use phase or possession of the statute.\nAnd -- and that only mandates a 5-year mandatory minimum.\nTherefore, brandish cannot under those\ncircumstances increase the range. It cannot increase the\nmandatory minimum. It cannot increase the maximum. The\njudge can still sentence within the mandatory 5 to life.\nHe simply cannot and is not bound by a determination that\nthe defendant brandished and therefore he must give a\nhigher sentence. He -- he can in considering that, along\nwith any other aggravating and mitigating factors.\nQUESTION: But the guidelines can require him to\ngive a higher sentence. If the same higher sentence of 5\nyears were mandated in the guidelines, you say that's\nokay. Right?\nMR. INGRAM: It would not be mandated in the\nsame sense. A mandatory minimum is just that. The judge\nhas no longer any discretion to go below. The -- the\ndefendant has no right to ask the judge to go below. The\nprosecution is empowered to insist that the judge give the\nhigher mandatory minimum sentence. The defendant is not\nprecluded under the guidelines from asking the Court to\ndepart downward on any number of legal bases for downward\ndepartures that take his case outside the heartland of\ncases under Koon v. United States.\nIf there are no further questions, I will\nreserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Ingram.\nMr. Dreeben, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThis Court's decision in McMillan v.\nPennsylvania forms the backdrop for both the statutory and\nthe constitutional questions in this case.\nAs a matter of statutory interpretation, the\namended section 924(c) creates one crime with a minimum of\n5 years and a maximum of life in prison and then gives the\nsentencing court additional guidance as to where the\npenalty shall be set within that 5-year-to-life range.\nThe increase in the mandatory minimums does not run afoul\nof the Apprendi rule and is, in fact, specifically\nendorsed by this Court's decision in McMillan.\nAnd on the constitutional question, this Court's\ndecision in McMillan 16 years ago established that it does\nnot violate the Constitution for a legislature to choose\none fact that has historically borne on the appropriate\npenalty to be assessed at sentencing and give the judge\nguidance as to what that sentence shall be.\nQUESTION: Well -- well, given the precedent of\nApprendi, suppose the judge says, now, you know, the jury\nfinds an enhancement because of harassment, and the judge\nsays, well, under -- let me begin again.\nUnder your theory of the case, the jury doesn't\n-- the judge said, you know, I would ordinarily give you 6\nmonths, but I -- I find there's a harassment here -- or\npardon me -- brandishing here, and so I'm going to give\nyou 5 to 7 years. True, it's a mandatory minimum. True,\nthat's different than Apprendi. But it certainly seems to\nme that the concerns Apprendi -- of Apprendi are fully\napplicable here.\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Kennedy, there are several\nsignificant differences between the issue in a case like\nthis and the issue in a case like Apprendi. In Apprendi,\nthe judge could not go above the jury's verdict based on\nthe Court's constitutional analysis. In other words, the\njury sets the outermost limit that the judge can do, and\nin the sense of protecting the jury trial right, the\nApprendi rule tracks onto what the jury must find.\nHere, regardless of what the jury finds, the\njudge has the discretion and the authority to sentence the\ndefendant between 5 years and life in prison. What the\nmandatory minimum takes away is not a jury trial right,\nbut a right to judicial discretion to give a lower\nsentence than the mandatory minimum calls for.\nBut Apprendi was not about protecting judicial\ndiscretion. Apprendi, in fact, limited judicial\ndiscretion and said that the judge cannot go above the\nmaximum that the jury's facts have determined. Here the\njudge is not doing anything that he could not do based on\nthe jury's verdict anyway. All that is happening is that\nhe is losing the discretionary power to give less, and\nthat judicial discretion interest is not the interest that\nwas at stake in Apprendi.\nThat's reinforced by the fact that the history\nthat this Court relied on, as one of its key determinants\nin the Apprendi decision, is not present in this case.\nThe history in Apprendi, the Court concluded, showed that\nit has been the rule down centuries into the common law\nthat the judge cannot give a higher sentence than based on\nthe facts that the jury has determined. But there is no\ncomparable historical rule that would support a preclusion\nof judicial discretion within the otherwise applicable\nrange.\nThe history of sentencing in this country shows\nthat within the maximum sentence established by the jury\nverdict, judges have been often given tremendous amounts\nof discretion on what sentence they should impose. But\nthe history of sentencing also reveals that legislatures\nhave frequently intervened in order to establish more\nprecise rules to govern that discretion. And the --\ntherefore, there is no broad historical rule that is\ncontradicted by a statute like the one in this case and\nthe one that was at issue in McMillan.\nQUESTION: But if that's so, do you -- do you\naccept what -- what your -- what the petitioner said in\nrespect to my second statute, if you remember it? The\nsecond statute is, Congress passes a law and it says the\nmaximum for robbery is 15 years, but if there is no\ninjury, then it's 7 or 5. Now, does Apprendi apply to\nthat?\nMR. DREEBEN: It --\nQUESTION: Or if there is -- if the gun isn't\ndischarged. Does Apprendi apply to that?\nMR. DREEBEN: It might, Justice Breyer. The\ncrucial question is whether that statute has created an\naffirmative defense.\nQUESTION: No, no, no. There is no doubt that\nthe statute I'm talking about intends the fact of\ndischarge to be a sentencing factor. There is no doubt.\nI mean, I can write it in such a way that that's clear.\nMR. DREEBEN: If it's --\nQUESTION: Now, at that point, Apprendi is a\nconstitutional rule, and therefore does the discharger\nnot have to be presented to the jury?\nMR. DREEBEN: As I understand Apprendi, it\nwould.\nQUESTION: All right. If that's so, then what\ndid you say in your first answer? You've had two parts.\nYou had a -- a purposive part and you had a historical\npart.\nAll right. Now, did you say anything, other\nthan saying eloquently and in several different ways, that\nApprendi concerned a maximum and this case concerns a\nminimum, which I am sure that the petitioners would\nconcede?\nMR. DREEBEN: The significance of it concerning\na minimum is that under this statute, once the jury\nreturns a verdict of guilty, using or carrying a firearm\nduring in relation to an underlying drug trafficking\noffense, the judge has the authority by virtue of that\njury verdict to sentence from 5 years to life in prison.\nThat's what the statute means.\nWhat the mandatory minimum provision does is\nsay, within that range, we want this defendant sentenced\nto not less than 7.\nQUESTION: All right. That's certainly true.\nBut what's bothering me about it is every factor in\nApprendi -- and I was against Apprendi. I dissented. But\nhaving that now being the law, it seems to me every\nfactor, other than the fact that this is a minimum and\nthat's a maximum, applies a fortiori in this case.\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, the two most significant\nfactors, as I've tried to say -- and I'll try one more\ntime -- is that in Apprendi, the defendant could not have\ngotten a sentence above 10 years based on the jury's\nverdict alone. It took an additional finding by the judge\nto send him into the realm where the maximum was now 20,\nand then he -- Apprendi got 12.\nIn this case, once the jury or, as it happens,\nthe judge -- the defendant waived a jury trial -- assigned\na finding of guilt to the defendant, the statute said,\nyour sentence, Mr. Harris, is between 5 years and life in\nprison. And the statute comes along and doesn't give the\njudge the authority to do something that he could not have\ndone before.\nQUESTION: So, Apprendi is just a draftsmanship\nproblem, really. So, I mean, it's bad if -- if the\nlegislature says, for this crime you get 20 years, but if\nyou brandish a weapon, you get another 5. That's bad.\nSo, the legislature, that's okay.\nI'm sorry. For -- for this crime you get 1 to\n20, but if you brandish, you get -- you get 25.\nSo, I say, okay, we'll revise it in light of\nApprendi. For this crime, you get -- you get 1 to 25, but\nif you brandish a weapon, it shall be 25. That's okay,\nalthough the other one wasn't okay. And -- and it's up to\nthe judge to find whether it's brandishing or not.\nMR. DREEBEN: The difference in that statute,\nJustice Scalia -- and I agree that that would not trigger\nthe rule that this Court announced in Apprendi -- is that\nas the Court's opinion in Apprendi notes, if Congress\nwrites the second kind of statute and says the range is 1\nto 25, it is exposing all defendants who are sentenced\nunder that statute to a possible sentence of 25 years.\nAnd the Court said that structural democratic constraints\nexist to deter legislatures from enacting statutes with\nmore draconian maximum penalties than they think are\nappropriate for the worst of the worst who are going to be\nsentenced under that statute.\nNow, here when Congress amended section 924(c),\nit went from a statute that had determinate sentences.\nPreviously whatever you did under 924(c), the judge had no\nsentencing discretion at all. It was just 5 years or 20\nyears or 30 years. Congress changed that and said this is\na more serious crime. This is a crime which, if you're\nconvicted of it, you're going to get at least 5 years with\nan implied maximum all the way up to life in prison.\nBy virtue of doing that, Congress envisioned\nthat there would a spectrum of offenders under section\n924(c), some of whom are going to be at the bottom of the\ntier and are just the least worst offenders under that\nstatute. They'll get 5 years. Others are going to be the\nworst of the worst. They are going to get a sentence that\nwill be closer to the top of the statute. Within that\nrange, Congress gave to the sentencing judge additional\nguide points of how to exercise that discretion. For\nsomeone who brandishes, that's a little worse than simply\nusing; he should get at least 7 years. For someone who\ndischarges -- that's an increment worse yet -- it's 10\nyears.\nBut there's still all of the head room up to\nlife in prison that Congress established for this offense.\nIt doesn't violate the Eighth Amendment for Congress to\nsay that someone who brings a gun into a drug or a violent\ncrime has committed a serious offense. We want the judge\nto have up to life in prison.\nQUESTION: So, if you tell the --\nQUESTION: May I ask you a question on -- on a\ndifferent topic? Because I think we understand your\nargument here and I -- Justice O'Connor asked your\nopponent, in essence, to what extent he thought the\nsentencing guidelines were implicated by this case. Would\nyou comment on that subject? Tell us what you think the\nimpact of this decision will have on the sentencing\nguidelines.\nMR. DREEBEN: Justice Stevens, it's unclear what\nimpact this decision will have on the sentencing\nguidelines, I assume on the assumption that the Court\nextends Apprendi to mandatory minimums.\nThe sentencing guidelines are like mandatory\nminimums in certain respects. They provide ranges, once\nthe judge has determined by a preponderance of the\nevidence, the defendant's conduct and criminal history,\nthat by statute the judge is to give a sentence within.\nBut they differ from mandatory minimums in that the\nstatute further says that the judge can depart from the\nguidelines sentence based on an aggravating or a\nmitigating fact that distinguishes the case from the kinds\nthat the guidelines' drafters had in mind.\nNow, the guidelines are -- are different\nprimarily in that there is a broader range of discretion\navailable for the judge to depart than there is under a\nmandatory minimum.\nI emphasize that this is a question of degree\nrather than one of kind because even these mandatory\nminimums under section 924(c) can be departed from. If\nthe Government makes a motion that says the defendant has\nrendered substantial assistance to the Government in the\nprosecution of others, that authorizes the judge to depart\nfrom what is otherwise a mandatory minimum. That same\nground for departure also exists within the guidelines,\nand it accounts for more than half of the departures that\nexist in the guidelines.\nNow, the guidelines do, of course, provide a\nfurther zone of less guided discretion to the judge in\nwhen he can depart. And if this Court rules against the\nGovernment in this case, we will be back saying that that\nzone of discretion distinguishes the guidelines. Whether\nthe Court agrees with that or not will be an open\nquestion.\nQUESTION: Right. I understand, but at least\nthe -- at least the argument that your opponent made would\nbe available to the Government. There's a difference\nbecause of the amount of discretion --\nMR. DREEBEN: That's correct.\nQUESTION: -- under the guideline.\nI did not understand. I want to be sure I don't\nmiss this point that you made in your answer. Do you\nargue that in this case it's really not a mandatory\nminimum because there is the discretion in -- in the\nprosecutor to ask for -- for a deviation from the statute?\nMR. DREEBEN: No, not in the sense that Your\nHonor is asking the question.\nBut I -- I do wish to underscore that there is\n-- there is a range of ways that Congress can draft\nstatutes and the States can draft statutes. Under the\ndrug statutes, for example, there's not only the\nsubstantial assistance departure that I've mentioned, but\nthere's also a departure for first-time offenders called\nthe safety valve. Now, that adds an additional amount of\ndiscretion to the judge.\nAnd any constitutional rule that this Court\ndevelops for mandatory minimums is going to have to be\nvery careful in articulating how much discretion is enough\nin order to make the mandatory minimum no longer mandatory\nand no longer minimum. It could be that the availability\nof the substantial assistance departure is enough to take\nit out of a rule that says never means never, and if -- if\nCongress says never, then the judge can't make the\nfinding.\nThat is precisely why we urge the Court to\nadhere to McMillan v. Pennsylvania which held 16 years ago\nthat it is permissible for -- for the legislature to\nprovide additional guidance. And the Court left open the\npossibility that particular statutes may fall under a\nconstitutional rule, but it didn't prescribe the sort of\nrigid rule that petitioner is advocating in this case.\nQUESTION: Mr. Dreeben, apart from one being\nwithin the jury zone and the other not, is there a\nrational distinction between saying, judge, you can't add\non 2 years at the top and saying you can't subtract 2\nyears at the bottom?\nMR. DREEBEN: The rational distinction, Justice\nGinsburg, is that in the former case, the defendant has a\nright to a jury trial that has to find him guilty on all\nthe facts that are going to determine the longest possible\ntime that he can spend in prison.\nUnder this statute, even if he does have a jury\ntrial right to brandishing -- just suppose that he did;\nsuppose that Congress gave it to him so we eliminate the\nconstitutional question -- the jury could find him not\nguilty. And the judge could still say, well, I think by a\npreponderance of the evidence, you did brandish, and\nexercising my discretion, I'm going to give you exactly\nthe same 7 years that the statute called for.\nThe fact that that can happen shows, I think,\nthat the right that's in play here is not a right to a\njury trial that will protect the defendant against the\npossibility of this increased punishment. It is the right\nto have a judge with unlimited discretion not to impose\nthe mandatory minimum even if he finds brandishing,\nbecause that is the distinction that I think both\npetitioner and I draw between the sentencing guidelines\nand this mandatory minimum. And the right to judicial\ndiscretion is simply not the Apprendi right. It's not a\nright that's been historically recognized.\nAnd if this Court were to accept respondent's --\nor petitioner's analysis of the constitutional rules that\ngovern here as being drawn from the ex post facto cases,\nwhich is essentially what he relied on in his reply brief\nand in this Court, the Court would have to fashion a far\nmore sweeping constitutional rule than would address\nmerely mandatory minimums, because the ex post facto cases\nare triggered by any substantial disadvantage to the\ndefendant. It doesn't have to be a substantial\ndisadvantage that can only be proved as an element of the\ncrime. The ex post facto cases apply to the withdrawal of\ngood-time credits. They apply to the sentencing\nguidelines, as the Court held in Miller v. Florida. They\nwould presumably apply to the withdrawal of an affirmative\ndefense after the defendant committed his crime.\nAnd petitioner, by relying on that test,\nessentially says, I want a rule that means that anytime I\nam substantially disadvantaged by one aspect or another of\nthe criminal laws of a State, the jury must find those\nfacts. All facts that are germane to my punishment --\nQUESTION: Is that the implication of Apprendi?\nMR. DREEBEN: That is the --\nQUESTION: Is that where we're headed, in your\nview?\nMR. DREEBEN: I hope not, Justice O'Connor,\nbecause I think that the Apprendi rule, as bounded by the\nhistory that the Court relied on and the explicit\nstatements of its holding, coupled with the Court's\nrecognition that, yes, legislatures can write statutes\nthat will achieve similar results to Apprendi but will do\nit in an acceptable form, all of those things suggest that\nthe Court did not have a broad ruling on it.\nQUESTION: Do you have a sense of how the\napplication of Apprendi is working out in the system now?\nI mean, how is it being applied? What's happening? What\nhas changed as a result?\nMR. DREEBEN: Well, retrospectively Apprendi has\ncaused a considerable amount of judicial chaos as courts\nhave attempted to sort out harmless error, plain error,\nand retroactivity considerations, one of which is before\nthe Court next month in the Cotton case.\nProspectively, the United States has responded\nto Apprendi by having facts that raise the -- the maximum\nbe submitted to the jury. And it does, as a matter of\npractice, cause some complications in particularly\nintricate conspiracy cases where the jury has to make\nseparate determinations as to each conspirator.\nIt also creates the kinds of issues that Justice\nBreyer was talking about for defendants who are hampered\nto some extent in their ability to present dual\nalternative defenses of the nature, I wasn't involved in\nthis conspiracy, but if I was, I'm only accountable for a\ncertain amount of drugs, because the jury is being asked\nto make that determination. Once the jury makes it\naffirmatively, the judge is not going to be in a position\nat sentencing to second guess that.\nSo, Apprendi does -- does restrict the -- the\ndefendant's ability to make a defense --\nQUESTION: -- defense bar complained about that,\nhave they?\nMR. DREEBEN: The defense bar has been --\nQUESTION: I'm -- I'm unaware that they are --\nare keen on getting rid of Apprendi.\nMR. DREEBEN: Their primary desire to date so\nfar, Justice Scalia, has been to get all of the old\nsentences in the pre-Apprendi regime overturned. And when\nthey've finished with that agenda, maybe they'll turn to\ntrying to get different proceedings at trial.\nQUESTION: But as far as you're concerned --\nQUESTION: To get it expanded.\nMR. DREEBEN: As cases like this reveal, there's\nbeen an effort to expand Apprendi to what could be viewed\nas its widest logical implications, because although I've\npresented a theory for why Apprendi should be read\nnarrowly to avoid disrupting the traditional ability of\nlegislatures to structure sentencing, there is obviously\nwithin the opinion the seeds of a much more fundamental\nchange in the --\nQUESTION: Yes, but those are extensions --\nextensions on the -- on the basis that you've said, which\nI now understand, is you say, well, there has to be a jury\nfinding for anything that will lead to a longer maximum\nterm, the highest possible term. And they say, yes, but\nif that's so, you also have to have a jury finding for the\nshortest mandatory term, because the shortest mandatory\nterm is far more important to any individual defendant\nthan the highest theoretical possible term. And I think\nthat's what their argument rests upon, and that sounds\nbasically true. And it doesn't lead you down the path\nyou're talking about.\nMR. DREEBEN: I don't think that it would be\ntrue for a defendant like the defendant in Jones who was\nconvicted by the jury of a crime that carried a 15-year\npenalty.\nQUESTION: No, there are some -- there are some\nexceptions, but they're saying in general. And -- but\nwhat's -- I want to be sure I -- I'm in a slight dilemma\nbecause I think Apprendi was not right. But still, there\nit is.\nAnd the -- but the -- the question -- I want to\nbe sure you finished Justice O'Connor's question. My\nunderstanding is prospectively a ruling against you here\nwould not give the Government a lot of trouble.\nProspectively what you would do is you would simply charge\nin the indictment every factor related to mandatory\nminimums and go and prove it. And that's not herculean.\nThat isn't some tremendously difficult thing to do, or\nnot?\nMR. DREEBEN: The Government could do that.\nQUESTION: They could do it.\nMR. DREEBEN: The States have a much wider range\nof mandatory minimum sentencing programs. They've filed\nan amicus brief in this case that itemizes the far greater\nnumber and wider range of State mandatory minimum\nprograms. I'm not in a position --\nQUESTION: Well, having read those, do you have\nany impression in respect to the practicalities of it?\nMR. DREEBEN: I think that the States will\nsuffer increased practical problems compared to the\nFederal Government because in the Federal Government, the\nmandatory minimums are in relatively specific areas and we\ncould, indeed, go forward and charge and prove them to a\njury.\nThe more fundamental implication of an extension\nof Apprendi within the maximum term is that it does raise\ngreater questions about the constitutionality of schemes\nsuch as the sentencing guidelines. Those are, of course,\nnot only on the Federal level but prevalent throughout the\nStates as well. And -- and the process of drawing lines\nbetween whether mandatory minimums are mandatory enough to\ntrigger any constitutional rule, versus sentencing\nguidelines not being, is going to require a process of\nadjudication, and there's no way to predict where that\nwill end up. It will largely depend on how broadly this\nCourt interprets the rule that it announced in Apprendi\nand then if it applies it here, how it applies it.\nIf there --\nQUESTION: May I ask you just a short -- so I\ndon't lose the point? In our discussion a little earlier,\nyou mentioned a statute that makes the mandatory minimum\nnot 100 percent mandatory because the Government may ask\nfor a -- a departure. What is the statutory authority for\nthe Government to make such a motion?\nMR. DREEBEN: Under 18 U.S.C., section 3553(e).\nQUESTION: 3553.\nMR. DREEBEN: Yes. The Government can file a\nmotion for substantial assistance of the defendant in the\nprosecution of others, and upon that motion, the judge can\ngo below. This Court analyzed that statute in Melendez v.\nUnited States several years ago, a case which I believe is\ncited in our brief.\nQUESTION: Mr. Dreeben, are you going to say\nanything before you get done about the statutory\nconstruction question? Because I'm -- if we said the\nstatute is like Jones, wouldn't that be the end of it?\nMR. DREEBEN: Correct. And, Justice Ginsburg, I\n-- I agree with the suggestion of Justice Souter earlier\nthat this statute is not identical to the Jones statute\nand shouldn't be construed identically to it.\nFirst and most fundamentally, in Jones and again\nunanimously in Castillo, the Court commented that a\nstatute that's written, as section 924(c) is written, has\nthe look of the creation of sentencing factors when you\nstart off looking at it. In Jones, the Court then went on\nto analyze a number of structural features that suggested\nthat the initial look was unreliable.\nHere the initial look is reliable. Unlike in\nJones where the additional factors, serious bodily injury\nand death, took the penalty from 15 years, first to 25\nyears, and then to life in prison, here the initial range\nof the statute is 5 years to life, and the mandatory\nminimums are fairly modest incremental increases in the\nminimum sentence of 5 years and 7 years.\nBut most importantly, what is different from the\nstatute in Jones, the carjacking statute and the statute\nhere, section 924(c), is in Jones the carjacking statute\nwas modeled on three Federal robbery statutes. Two of\nthose Federal robbery statutes contained serious bodily\ninjury or putting somebody in jeopardy of serious bodily\ninjury that were clearly offense elements, and the Court\ncommented that it could see no reason -- and the\nGovernment was unable to adduce a reason -- why Congress\nwould have departed from the explicit models on which it\nrelied in drafting the carjacking statute. So you had a\nfirmer basis for concluding in the carjacking statute that\nCongress probably intended an element.\nHere not only do you not have that feature,\nbecause there was no Federal antecedent for section\n924(c), but you have the very important consideration that\nthere's no constitutional doubt that should be applied to\nthe construction of section 924(c). Unlike in Jones where\nthe Court held that a series of cases over 25 years had\nraised constitutional questions about increasing the\nmaximum, here the relevant precedent, of which Congress is\npresumed to be aware, is McMillan v. Pennsylvania which\ngave the legislature fair warning that it could provide\nfor the kind of statute that it's provided here.\nAnd for those reasons, we think that the Fourth\nCircuit and every other court of appeals that's analyzed\nthe question is correct in concluding that Congress's\napproach in section 924(c) was a sentencing factor\napproach. The question then becomes whether that is a\nconstitutional approach.\nQUESTION: May I just ask another -- another\nquestion about the history and the length of the history?\nI particularly have in mind Justice Thomas's concurring\nopinion in Apprendi. Other than the McMillan case itself,\nare you aware of any long line of cases prior to McMillan\nreaching the same result?\nMR. DREEBEN: No, Justice Stevens. And the\nreason for that is that the history of sentencing in this\ncountry moved from early statutes which were wholly\ndeterminate.\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. DREEBEN: Then in the 19th century, the\nlegislatures and Congress and the State adopted a -- a\npolicy of having wide ranges and judicial discretion\nwithin them. Then later, legislatures moved to a system\nof parole boards and -- and indeterminate sentencing in\nmany States.\nAnd it was as a result of those processes that\nin the mid-20th century and late 20th century, a variety\nof commentators began to decide that this sentencing\nscheme that gives so much discretion to various actors in\nthe system was not acceptable because it produced\nunwarranted disparities against similarly situated\noffenders. And at that point, to promote transparency,\nmeaning we know what -- why the judge is doing what he's\ndoing, and uniformity, namely, similar offenders will get\nthe same sentence, schemes came along like mandatory\nminimums and guideline sentencing. But I believe that\nthey were understood to be directions to limit judicial\ndiscretion, not to wholly supplant it or to be the type of\nstatute that the Court invalidated in Apprendi.\nAnd it's really the petitioner's burden in this\ncase to show that these sentencing innovations are\nunconstitutional. In Apprendi, the defendant was able to\ncarry that burden by pointing to a long line of consistent\njudicial decisions. Here neither party can point to a\nlong line of consistent decisions. What each of us does\nis argue from the background baseline tradition.\nOur submission is that judges have always had a\nwide range of discretion. Defendants have never been able\nto rely on not getting a stiffer sentence within the\nmaximum authorized ranges. Legislatures have relied on\nthis Court's decision in McMillan, saying that it's\nconstitutional for the legislature to structure that\ndiscretion, and we believe that the Court should adhere to\nthat position today.\nThank you.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Dreeben.\nMr. Ingram, you have 3 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM C. INGRAM\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. INGRAM: Responding to the questions about\nthe effect that a ruling in our favor will have on the\nlower courts, first of all, as noted, there will be no\nprospective impact. The Government in the Federal context\nis already alleging drug amounts, is already alleging\nbrandish and discharge, and it's a very simple matter for\nthe Government and the prosecution, either the State or\nthe Federal courts, to allege and -- and prove these\nadditional facts.\nRetroactively, there will be some cases that\nwill be sent back. They will not be sent back to set\naside guilty verdicts or guilty pleas. They will simply\nbe sent back for resentencing, consistent with the opinion\nin this case, just like they were with Apprendi. There's\nnot nearly the flood of remands on Apprendi, and Bailey\nfor that matter, as the Government contends, but in any\nevent, however many there are, if the Constitution demands\nit, then so be it.\nThe Government is concerned that a ruling in our\nfavor will undermine legislatures' concerns about limiting\njudicial discretion in sentencing by enacting mandatory\nminimums. Those statutes, the statute in this case in\nparticular, and any statutes enacting mandatory minimums\nin -- in the State courts will not go away with a ruling\nin our favor. The only difference is that the Government\nwill simply have to allege and prove the additional fact,\nfurther limiting the judge's discretion, whereas currently\nthe judge has discretion to determine, by a preponderance\nof the evidence, whether or not a fact exists or not.\nOnce a jury finds beyond a reasonable doubt that it does,\nthe judge has no more discretion and must impose the\nmandatory minimum.\nAnd as has been pointed out and we point out in\nour brief and reply brief, we contend that mandatory\nminimums, as a practical matter, are far more important\nincreases at the bottom level than the possible increases\nat the top of a sentencing scheme would be.\nAnd finally, we are not asking the Court to\nextend the constitutional rule announced in Apprendi.\nApprendi was limited by its facts, but the constitutional\nrule announced was that it is unconstitutional for a\nlegislature to remove from the jury the assessment of\nfacts that increased the prescribed range of penalties. A\nmandatory minimum increases the prescribed range of\npenalties. We are simply asking the Court to apply the\nconstitutional rule announced in Apprendi to the facts of\nour case and -- and ask the Court to rule in our favor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Ingram.\n"
