The National Labor Relations Board.\nMr. Richie.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SHELDON E. RICHIE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. RICHIE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe issue in this case is whether the\nNational Labor Relations Board can continue to issue\nadjudicatory decisions when its membership falls to two.\nThe National Labor Relations Act clearly states that at\nall times, a quorum of the board will be not less than\nthree members. The board's interpretation -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is it your position that\nall of the actions of the board, including those taken\nby the regional offices and by the general counsel and\nby everybody else, is inoperative once -- once the\nmembership falls below three?\nMR. RICHIE: No, Justice Scalia,\nparticularly with respect to the general counsel, the\nstatute at 153(d) has a separate enumeration of -- of\nobligations and powers and authority, so we don't think\nthat that fails.\nWe also think that, with respect to certain\nadministrative type functions -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it has a separate -\na separate authorization for these three -- three-person\nadjudicatory panels as well, doesn't it?\nMR. RICHIE: It has -- it does,\nJustice Scalia. It does have a separate authorization\nfor panels of three or more members. It does not have,\nas in this case, a separate authorization for panels of\ntwo members.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. But that's a\ndifferent argument from the argument you were starting\noff with, which, as I understood it, was once the\nmembership of the board falls below the quorum of three,\nby reason of that, the three -- former three-member\npanels, of which there are now only two left, cannot\nact. Is that your argument?\nMR. RICHIE: It is our argument that the -\nthat once the membership falls below three, that the\nNational Labor -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The membership of the\nboard?\nMR. RICHIE: I'm sorry, Your Honor?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The membership of the\nboard?\nMR. RICHIE: When the membership of the\nboard falls below three. But we also believe that when\nthe membership of the group falls below three, that the\ndelegee group's authority to make adjudicatory decisions\nlapses.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I understood that argument\nand I thought that was the only one you were making.\nBut you are making a broader one, that it also happens\nwhenever the -- whenever the board's quorum disappears.\nMR. RICHIE: You are correct,\nJustice Scalia. We are making that argument. It's\nbecause of the first sentence of 153(b), which states\nthat the delegations have to be to members of three or\nmore members.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So the regional offices\ncan't function, of the NLRB?\nMR. RICHIE: Well, we believe they can\nfunction. They can receive, for example, unfair labor\npractices complaints. They can't make adjudicatory\ndecisions. And we think that that is exactly what -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can the board pay salaries?\nMR. RICHIE: We believe they can, because\nthere is probably a different statute that enumerates\nthat, Justice Scalia, other than this statute with\nrespect to the authority with respect to adjudicatory\ndecisions.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm really reluctant to\nrely upon this first argument that you are making,\nbecause I really don't know what it does to all of the\nfunctioning of the board.\nMR. RICHIE: Well, one of the --\nJustice Scalia, one of the things that we think is clear\nis that the remedy for fixing an undersized board is not\nfor the board to redefine itself and to read the\nstatute, but for Congress or the president to act. And\nthere are many ways in which the president and Congress\ncould -- could fix the problem of an undersized board.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But here the court of\nappeals said that the Act does two things. First, it\nsaid that the full board can delegate full powers to any\nthree-member group. That was step one, and that was\ndone here.\nAnd then it says there's this rule that a\nquorum is three, but then it said: Except as to one of\nthese three-member groups that has been designated,\nexcept, and there the quorum is two. So why doesn't the\nstatute answer the question that, yes, a quorum is\nthree, except when it's two?\nMR. RICHIE: Well, I think there is two\nanswers to that, Justice Ginsburg. One is here the\ngovernment -- the board takes the position, as they say\non page 29 in a footnote to their brief, that when a\ndelegate group possessed of all of the board's power\nacts, it is acting as the board and not as an agent of\nthe board.\nSo first, we would say that the second\nquorum provision isn't even applicable to this group\nthat was established -- of members Kirsanow, Liebman and\nSchaumber. And so we think the three-member quorum -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't understand that.\nWould you -- would you make that argument again?\nMR. RICHIE: Certainly, Justice Scalia. The\ngovernment -- I'm sorry, \"the government.\" The NLRB in\nits brief in footnote 21 on page 29, as well as in the\ndelegation, the minutes of the delegation in 2007, which\nare found in our brief in the appendix on -- I think\nit's pages 4a and 5a. Both say that when -- the NLRB\nsays in the footnote \"When the delegee group possessed\nof all of the board's powers,\" which is what we have\nhere, \"acts, it is acting as the board and not as an\nagent of the board. So our position is that when you\nbecome the board, as this group did, now you are subject\nto that minimum three-member delegee -- three member\nquorum requirement.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's not an agent of\nthe board because the three-member group that has a\nquorum of two has the full powers of the board. So the\nstatute doesn't say anything about a three-member group\nthat has a quorum of two being an agent of the board.\nMR. RICHIE: It's a -- it's a group that is\ndelegated authority, and therefore, whether it's a full\ndelegation or partial delegation, we believe that the\ncommon law principles of agency and principal make that\ndelegee group an agent.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But where does the\nstatute make that three-member group with a quorum of\ntwo, a quorum of two, an agent? It says they may be\ndesignated to exercise any and all powers?\nMR. RICHIE: Justice Ginsburg, it does not\nsay the word \"agent\" in it. But the delegation that\nit's referring to is at common law a principal-agency\nrelationship. So it's our position that once that\ndelegation occurs that the -- in a normal situation,\nbecause you could have a three-member group of four\nmembers, a board of four or a board of five, and you\ncould have a group with three members. When the\ndelegation is made, it's our position and we believe\nthat this is the position that the D.C. Circuit took as\nwell, that that's an agent of the board.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You should -- you should\nhave a very direct answer to this question.\nWere you finished, because I don't want to\ninterrupt that train of thought?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The D.C. Circuit I think\nwas the source of your opening argument because they\nsaid when the number drops below three there is no\nboard, and I guess that's what your opening argument was\nbased on.\nMR. RICHIE: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, it did\nsay that. But it also went on to say that it was\napplying the rules, the common law rules of principal\nand agency, and that when the board without three\nmembers lost its authority to act, that the delegee\ngroup to which the delegation was made also lost\nauthority to act. And in this case that's exactly what\nhappened. We had a three-member board -- we actually\nhad four delegate to three, and then two terms expired.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, just on this same\npoint before Justice Breyer I think moves to another\npoint. The statute does use the word \"quorum\" twice\nand, as Justice Ginsburg has pointed out, except that\ntwo members -- in its last phrase it uses the word\n\"quorum\" twice: \"Except that two members shall\nconstitute a quorum.\" It doesn't say two members may\nact.\nMR. RICHIE: Justice Kennedy -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It says shall constitute a\nquorum.\"\nMR. RICHIE: Justice Kennedy, I think we\nhave to start first -- and you are correct, there are\ntwo quorum provisions, but \"quorum\" is not defined\ndifferently. Quorum -- I think we agree within NLRB\nthat a quorum is the minimum number of members of a body\nnecessary to transact business. We have two different\nbodies defined in this statute. We have the board as\none body and we have the group as a different body. And\nso when the -- when the exception appears in the\nstatute, we agree again with the D.C. Circuit's\ninterpretation of that as simply defining two different\nnumbers of people necessary to fill out a quorum of\nthese two different bodies that are defined within the\nstatute.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can you -- can you -- if\nyou are right, it seems to me you should have a very\nclear, concise answer to the question that I'm just\ngoing to ask you. And this is the question: Imagine\nthat there was no delegation, none. Now we have five\nmembers; is that right? One of them dies. So there is\na vacancy. Now, can the remaining four exercise the\nboard's power?\nMR. RICHIE: Clearly.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Clearly. Okay. So what is\nthe difference between the situation I just described\nand this situation where the Board simply delegated its\npower to three people and one of them dies? What's the\ndifference? I can't find any difference in the\nlanguage. So what is the difference?\nMR. RICHIE: Justice Breyer, the difference\nis that in this statute there is a clear statement that\nat all times the board must have a three-member quorum.\nIn your hypothetical there were still four members.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Correct.\nMR. RICHIE: The board was still in place.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Except that two members\nshall constitute a quorum of any group designated\npursuant to the first sentence, which says \"The board is\nauthorized to delegate to any group of three all of the\npowers which it may itself exercise. \" So, what's the\ndifference?\nMR. RICHIE: Well, the difference is that\nonce the -- the difference between the hypothetical and\nthe situation we are in is that there were four members,\nand the statute -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I know that, but I'm\nasking why does that make a difference?\nMR. RICHIE: It makes a difference because\nthe statute requires that at all times the board shall\nhave a quorum of three members, a minimum quorum of\nthree members.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Except.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But isn't that tied to a\nquorum for the board as a whole to act? Once it's\ndelegated a responsibility to a three-member board, it's\nalready said, unless it takes another vote, that it's\ngoing to let those three people decide. It has -- I\nunderstand the word \"delegated\" to mean it's given over\nits power to a subgroup. If it wants to take it back,\nit needs a quorum to do that. That's what I understand.\nMR. RICHIE: Well, I think the problem is,\nJustice Sotomayor, that the delegation to a group of\nthree is indeed a valid delegation. We don't contest\nthat. But what we have here is a phantom group. And\nwhat the -- what the board said, because member\nKirsanow's term expired in December, about 11 days after\nthe delegation. And if you look at the minutes of the\nboard when they are delegating to the group, it says in\nthe minutes that they \"are continuing to be a two-member\nquorum of a three-member group,\" as if member Kirsanow\nis a phantom . It's a fiction. The group ceases to\nexist and the board -- it's not just that the board\nfalls below three and the board ceases to exist with all\ndelegated powers to this group. The group ceases to\nexist.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But that brings you back\nto Justice Breyer's hypothetical. There's five members\non the board. Clearly they can delegate under the\nstatute. Now there are only four members. Something\nhappens to the fifth. Under your theory, the entity\nthat originally delegated no longer exists and therefore\nthe group, the entity that received the delegation of\npowers, must cease, must cease to act.\nMR. RICHIE: Justice Kennedy, I -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If the quorum of three\nthat authorized two to act disappears and that means the\nprincipal is no longer there, so the agent can't\nexercise the authority, why isn't it the same when five\nbecome four?\nMR. RICHIE: Well, we believe that the\nreason that it isn't, Justice Kennedy, the same is -\nterrible sentence. It's not the same because the\nstatute contemplates vacancies on the board and multiple\nvacancies, so long as they don't go below three. The\nstatute -- the vacancy clause in the statute doesn't\napply to a group at all. So the delegating group in the\nhypothetical clearly is still in place as the board\nbecause it's the board that delegated. And the board\nstill exists.\nJUSTICE ALITO: As far as the interests of\nyour client are concerned, is there any functional\ndifference between what happened here and what could\nhappen very routinely even if the board had five\nmembers, namely that after the case was assigned to a\nthree-member panel one of the three members of the panel\nbecame unable to sit on that case, but the remaining two\nmembers were able to reach agreement so the case could\nbe decided?\nMR. RICHIE: Justice Alito, the difference\nis that here there was never a way to reconstitute this\nboard -- I'm sorry, the group -- as three members. When\nyou have five or you have four members of the board and\na member of a three-member group is unable to perform\nhis or her function -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't there another\ndifference? Is it not the case that the decisions of\nthese panels can be appealed to the full board? Are\nthey automatically final? Can the board not revise the\ndecision of one of its panels?\nMR. RICHIE: Well, I believe that the board\ncould revise the decision of one of its panels.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You've got to tell me more\nthan you believe it. What is the case?\nMR. RICHIE: The adjudication is final.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The adjudication is final.\nMR. RICHIE: Of the three-member group.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There is no appeal to the\nfull board?\nMR. RICHIE: That is correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then what is the reason --\nI now see. Your answer to my question is that the\nvacancy clause applies to the full board but not to the\ngroup.\nMR. RICHIE: That's correct, Justice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Now, got that\nanswer. And now I see how you could read the statute\nthat way. So, now I would like -- and that would be in\nyour favor.\nMR. RICHIE: That's true.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And -- and, therefore, I\nwould like to know, since you could also read it the\nother way, why should it be read your way? I mean, I\ncan think of a lot of reasons why not. One is something\nthat Justice Scalia was raising: It may work havoc as\nto what remains effective, what doesn't, what about the\nboard staff decisions, which are, which aren't. I can\nsee a lot of reasons for not doing it.\nBut what are your best reasons for reading\nthat vacancy clause the way you want me to read it?\nMR. RICHIE: Justice Breyer, we -- we\nbelieve that it is important to have a promote -- to\nhave a robust debate and an expression of -- a potential\nfor expression of dissent. And what you have here is\nyou have two members in a group and -- who have publicly\nannounced that on more than one occasion over the last 2\nyears plus 3 months when this board has sat with only 2\nmembers, that they have sometimes compromised their\nopinions in the interest of the institutional purposes,\nbasically to keep the doors open.\nAnd so you don't have a full and robust\ndebate. You don't have the potential for an expression\nof a dissenting view, and that's the -- that's the\ndistinction that we see.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But the problem is that\nthat exists whether we read your rule or not in the way\nyou want. You have -- you've conceded that a\nthree-member board could lose a member, a three-member\ngroup could lose a member and its acts still be binding,\nas long as you say there is -- there is three members on\nthe full board. But this lack of opportunity for\ndissent exists any time there is a vacancy. You just\ndon't like the system.\nMR. RICHIE: Justice Sotomayor, if we\nconsented that when there was an absence, a member who\ndies, retires, is incapacitated, that the two members of\na properly constituted three -- three-member group could\nstill function, I certainly did not mean to say that.\nWe do not consent to that or agree with that\nproposition. What -- what somebody -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. You are now\nsaying that the group always has to be three members?\nMR. RICHIE: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That somebody can't die,\nleave, recuse themselves from that group without\ninvalidating the actions of that subgroup. Where in the\nstatute do you read that limitation when it says a\nquorum of two is okay to act?\nMR. RICHIE: The definition of a quorum,\nJustice Sotomayor, is the minimum number of persons of a\nbody necessary to transact business. The body here is\ndefined as three or more people. So, when the -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, I am talking about\nthe group.\nMR. RICHIE: I am, too.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So the group is not\ndefined as three or more people. It's defined as three.\nThe board is defined as three or more. The group is\ndefined as three. So I'm -- I'm a little confused.\nMR. RICHIE: In the statute, the group is\ndefined as -- the board is authorized, and I'm reading\nfrom 153(b), Appendix 1a to our brief: \"The board is\nauthorized to delegate to any group of three or more\nmembers\" -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I see.\nMR. RICHIE: -- \"any or all\" -- that is\nwhere we find it necessary that the group must contain\nat least three members.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's -- that's a totally\ndifferent argument from the one that relies upon the\nsize of the board, right?\nMR. RICHIE: It is, and we think it's an\nadditional argument. We think there's multiple -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Even if the board were\nstill properly constituted and had a full five members,\nif one of the three members to a -- a board should die,\nit would no longer be a three-member board and could no\nlonger be, as your argument goes, the recipient of the\ndelegation, right?\nMR. RICHIE: That's correct, Justice Scalia.\nBut what's happened routinely for -- for 60 years since\n1947 when Taft-Hartley was passed, is that what the\nboard did was it reconstituted the panels any time a\nmember died or retired.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There have been\nsituations before where the board dwindled to two\nmembers. Is this the first time that the board has\ncontinued to adjudicate the cases that they can, or when\nthere were prior periods with only two did the board\ncontinue to adjudicate?\nMR. RICHIE: This is the first time, yes.\nFor over -- from 1947 through 19 -- up to 2007, any time\nthe board fell to two members -- as far as we know, any\ntime the board fell to two members, the board\nreconstituted -- I'm sorry. Any time a group fell to\ntwo members, the board reconstituted the group to a\nthree-member group.\nJUSTICE ALITO: There is a well-established\npractice on the court of appeals that when a three-judge\npanel for some reason loses one of the members due to a\ndeath or resignation or recusal, the panel can continue\nto decide the case if the remaining two judges can\nagree. And -- and do you see -- do you think the -- the\nsituation is different with the NLRB for some reason?\nOr do you think that that -- that those decisions on the\ncourts of appeals are unlawful as well?\nMR. RICHIE: Well, Justice Alito, I think\nit's a different statute. But we also -- I also think\nthe court of appeals, which is the delegating body that\nforms the -- the three-member courts, still is in\nexistence. And if we just -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you are shifting\narguments. You can't keep jumping back and forth\nbetween the two arguments. The one is that the\nappointing body has to still be fully constituted, or at\nleast have a quorum, and the other one, which I thought\nJustice Alito was addressing, is the quite separate\nargument that the recipient of the delegation has to be\nthree. And when it falls below three it's only two.\nAnd I don't know that you have a response\nto -- to -- to his point, with respect to the latter\nargument, except -- except that it's a different\nstatute.\nMR. RICHIE: Well, Justice Scalia, it's a\ndifferent statute but it's also a very temporary and\nlimited circumstance. You have a panel that was formed\nto hear a case. Here you have got a delegation of all\nthe authority, the board has -- the group has become the\nboard, and we effectively have a two-member National\nLabor Relations Board.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So I would have thought,\nbut this is only me -- other people don't necessarily go\nin for this kind of argument. But in thinking of the -\nthe -- the arguments in your favor, the one that sort of\nresonated a bit with me was that this is a very\nRepublican Congress in 1947 that passed Taft-Hartley,\nand one of the things they were really aiming at was to\nmove the board from three to five. And this is a way so\nthat that just doesn't happen.\nBut I assume from the briefs filed that\nthere is no supporting legislative history for that,\nwhat I've just said, so I better wipe it out of my mind.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If there is no legislative\nhistory, it could be true.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. RICHIE: Justice Breyer, the legislative\nhistory I think is -- there is no legislative history on\nwhat happens when the board falls below two members.\nBut it is clear that from 1935 to 1947, the board was\nmade up of three members, and the statute clearly said\nunder the Wagner Act two members could be a quorum of a\nthree-member board.\nIn 1947 when Taft-Hartley was passed,\nCongress intentionally increased the quorum and\nincreased the size of the board. If it had intended to\nhave only two members serve at any time as a two-member\nboard, they would not -- that would be a strange way to\ndo it, in a statute that not only increases the size of\nthe board, but changes the minimum quorum requirement\nfrom two to three.\nJUSTICE ALITO: I was surprised by your\nanswer to -- I was surprised by your answer to one of\nthe earlier questions, because one of your amici says\nthat any member of the board, regardless of whether he\nor she sits on the panel hearing a case, may request\nthat the case be heard by all five board members. Is\nthat -- is that not correct?\nMR. RICHIE: That is correct, but that's to\nhear it as opposed to overturn it once the decision is\nmade.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Heard an initial -- an\ninitial decision. But just -- the review of the panel\nis in the court of appeals, right?\nMR. RICHIE: That's correct,\nJustice Ginsburg.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So you could have\ninitially a panel of five, but that would not be\nreviewing the panel of three?\nMR. RICHIE: That's correct,\nJustice Ginsburg. The -- the -- the five-member board\nwould not review the three-member group's decision. But\nin response to Justice -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What's the use of having a\nfive-member board, then? I really don't understand\nwhat -- what has been accomplished -\nMR. RICHIE: What was -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- if you have a -- you are\nchanging, oh, we had a three-member board, that's no\ngood, we thought that's unfair. We are going to make to\nfive. But then we allow the five to convert themselves\nto three for finally deciding all the cases. What -\nwhat has been accomplished?\nMR. RICHIE: Multiple -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Nothing.\nMR. RICHIE: I'm sorry, Justice Scalia.\nMultiple members of three. And so before\nyou had a -- a -- without a delegation, you had a group\nof three members. They could -- that group could\nhear -- or board -\nJUSTICE ALITO: The amicus says that the\nmembers of the board not serving on a panel are given\nthe opportunity to review draft decisions, thus no case\nwill issue unless it reflects the majority opinion of\nthe full board.\nMR. RICHIE: It's a draft -\nJUSTICE ALITO: So that can be, in effect,\nthe opportunity for full board review before a draft\ndecision is issued in final form; is that the way it\nworks?\nMR. RICHIE: Yes, Justice Alito, it does.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Only -\nMR. RICHIE: That's not -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Only if a majority\nof the board wants to do that, right?\nMR. RICHIE: No, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One member of the\nfull board can overturn a group delegation, in other\nwords, and hear the initial decision?\nMR. RICHIE: No, Mr. Chief Justice. They\ncan agree to -- to review the decision and they can\nagree before the decision is made to join the panel,\nbasically is what they do.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if one board\nmember wants to do that and four don't? What happens?\nMR. RICHIE: One member wants to join the\npanel?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One member wants to\nreview the group's decision.\nMR. RICHIE: That member would review the\ngroup's decision. He wouldn't be able -- he or she\nwouldn't be able to overturn the group's decision.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What -- I am really\nconfused now.\nIs it or is it not the case that the full\nboard has the power to review a decision of one of these\npanels? Before you said no; before you said it's final.\nMR. RICHIE: The decision is final once it\nis rendered. They can review the decision in draft form\nbefore it is -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that is -- that is my\nquestion, whether they -- they can review it before it\nis rendered, is that what you are saying?\nMR. RICHIE: They can do that or they can\nask to be included on the -- on the panel.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They can review it before\nit is rendered. Okay.\nMR. RICHIE: But they can't overturn it.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is this different from\nthe practice that some courts of appeals follow of\ncirculating a panel decision to the full court some days\nbefore it's issued to the public? That doesn't put the\nnon-panel members on the panel. Is this practice that\nyou are describing the same or is it different?\nMR. RICHIE: I believe it's the same,\nJustice Ginsburg, that it's exactly the same. But -\nbut you have an additional opportunity -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's quite\ndifferent from the court of appeals sitting en banc.\nThe practice of circulating the opinion does not put all\nof the members of the court on the panel.\nMR. RICHIE: That is correct,\nJustice Ginsburg.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But it provides an\nopportunity for them to vote to hear the case en banc\nbefore it's ever issued.\nMR. RICHIE: That's correct, Justice Alito.\nIt does. And it -- and therefore you have what we don't\nhave here, is an opportunity for a robust debate.\nIf there are no other questions I would like\nto reserve the remainder of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Katyal.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. KATYAL: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nWe agree that the plain text controls this\ncase and there are three features to that text.\nFirst, section 153(b) permits delegation of\nany or all of the board's power to three or more\nmembers. Second, that section sets out a general quorum\nrule of three members. And third, as Justices Alito --\nJustices Alito, Kennedy and Ginsburg have pointed out,\nthere is the phrase \"except that\" in the rule, a special\nquorum provision that sets up panel quorums at two\nmembers.\nAnd in this case, faced with a vacancy\ncrisis, the board validly delegated its powers in\nDecember 2007 to a three-member panel, and Petitioners\nhave never contested otherwise. Rather, they argue that\nwhen the board dropped it down to two members -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Just before the third\nmember no longer became -- no longer was a member of the\nboard.\nMR. KATYAL: That's true.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So knowing when it gave it\nto this three member panel that it would shortly become\na two-member panel, and that thereby the board would be\nable to act with only two members instead of with three,\nwhich is what the quorum requirement for the board is.\nI must say that seems to be a very strange\nprocedure when you have a statute that says the board\nhas to -- has to have three for a quorum. When the\nboard sees, oh, God, we are about to lose our third\nmember, let's set up a three-member panel with this guy\nwho's about to go off. It will immediately become a\ntwo-member panel and then we can act with only two\nmembers. That's wonderful.\nIt doesn't seem to you like an evasion of\nthe whole purpose of the -- of the quorum requirement?\nMR. KATYAL: I don't think so. I think it's\nprecisely what was -- what the text allows, because it's\nnot, Justice Scalia, simply a three-member quorum\nrequirement. It's a three-member quorum requirement,\n\"except that.\"\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Except -- may I just\ninterrupt a bit, just on the \"except\" clause at the very\nbottom. When you are talking about individual cases\nit's easy. Sure, one member dies; the other two can\nfinish. But you are talking about long-run governance\nof the board. The two members -- two members shall\nconstitute a quorum of any group designated pursuant to\nthe first sentence.\nNow, 2 years later, after -- what is the\ngroup designated pursuant to the first sentence at the\ntime of the decision 2 years later?\nMR. KATYAL: It is the same group of people\nthat were -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But there is no such group\nexists at the time that that power is being exercised.\nMR. KATYAL: Well, Justice Stevens, the\nlanguage is written in the past tense. It's \"any\" -\nthe language in this is found in the government's brief\nat 10a.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, it's not the past\ntense. \"Two members shall constitute a quorum.\"\nMR. KATYAL: \"Of any group designated\npursuant to\" the first sentence.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But there is no group\naround at the time they're -- that this case is being\ndecided, that was designated before.\nMR. KATYAL: That group was designated on\nDecember 20, 2007, and that met the requirements of -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But your -- your inquiry\nis focusing on what happens 2 years later.\nMR. KATYAL: And -- and with respect to 2\nyears later, I submit to you that that penultimate\nsentence in 153(b) is met. That is a designated group\npursuant to the first sentence.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I don't know how you\ncould write the sentence without the \"ed\" unless you\nwant to say -- to make your point, if the statute had\nbeen written the other way, to any group continuously\nbeing designated.\nMR. KATYAL: Sure, I think you could say\nsomething like constitute a -- that two members shall\nconstitute a quorum of any group that continues to meet\nthe requirements of the first sentence thereof, or\nsomething like that.\nJUSTICE BREYER: To read -- you can read the\nlanguage the way you want, that -- because of the\nvacancy clause. You see, there is a sentence there that\nsays \"A vacancy shall not impair the right of the\nremaining members to exercise the power.\" That implies\nin the absence of that clause, five to four, they\ncouldn't. Okay?\nNow, you say that clause applies to the\nremaining members, i.e., to the three. And now we don't\nhave three. And since we don't have three, there are -\nand you have to have three. Because they're not -\nthere's not -- there are not the remaining members, you\nsee.\nMR. KATYAL: Right. So let me say a few\nthings about that. The first is -\nJUSTICE BREYER: As long as there was\nanother member, you could -- you could do it. But\nwithout that remaining member, you can't.\nMR. KATYAL: So the first thing to say about\nthat argument, Justice Breyer, and it's one that\nJustice Scalia brought up to my friend before -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. KATYAL: -- it is a totally different\nargument. It really does rest on the first sentence of\n153(b).\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Yes.\nMR. KATYAL: And my friend admitted, it's a\ntotally new, different argument.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. KATYAL: It's not in the question\npresented. It's not before the Court. But were the\nCourt interested in it, I do think that the language of\nthe quorum provision, \"quorum\" meaning a number\nsufficient to transact business, is the most relevant\nlanguage, and that suggests that two is enough so long\nas you have that initial delegation to a group of three\nand then one member drops off.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, don't -- don't you\nthink it is significant that the -- the vacancy clause\nthat you were discussing -- where is it? It's in (b).\n\"A vacancy in the board shall not impair the right of\nthe remaining members to exercise all of the powers of\nthe board.\" And it says nothing about a vacancy in the\ngroup not impairing the power of the group.\nMR. KATYAL: The -- the -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Which -- which buttresses,\nit seems to me, the argument that when the group is no\nlonger a group of three the delegation is no longer\neffective.\nMR. KATYAL: I don't think so. The -- the\nlanguage is \"A vacancy in the board -- in the board\nshall not impair the powers of the remaining members of\nthe board.\"\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of the board.\nMR. KATYAL: Of the board. And -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But it doesn't say that\nabout the group. That's my point.\nMR. KATYAL: Well, but by definition,\nJustice Scalia, the members that had been delegated this\npower on December 20th are members of the board. And\nthey are not -- they are not simply extraneous actors.\nAnd so the vacancy clause, I think -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No. The -- this whole\npassage distinguishes between the board and the group.\nI mean, it's -- it doesn't -- it doesn't mean the group\nwhen it says \"the board\" and the board when it says \"the\ngroup.\"\nMR. KATYAL: Well, I think it -- I don't\nknow that there is a distinction. I think that there\nwhen they say the board, it by definition includes the\ngroup, because that is part of the board. They aren't\nextraneous individuals.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, counsel, if I -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm sorry.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, go ahead;\nfinish.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The quorum for the group\nshould be three, then. Right?\nMR. KATYAL: The quorum -- well, except\nthat, Justice Scalia, it says -- it goes on to say that\nthe quorum is actually two.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Let -- let's say the\nboard delegates to a group the authority to act as the\nboard until December 31st, 2010. And on December 30th,\n2010, the group delegates to itself because it's acting\nas the board the authority to act until December 31,\n2011. Is that valid?\nMR. KATYAL: Well, if -- if the initial\ndelegation did give any and all of the powers to the -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All the powers of\nthe board until December 31st.\nMR. KATYAL: And then -- then I take it,\nyes, they could exercise that delegation.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So a delegee can\ndelegate to itself the full authority of the -- the\nmaster in the master -agent relationship?\nMR. KATYAL: Under the statute. Now, there\nmay be other problems with it. So 153(a), which is\nfound in our brief, in our government brief at page 10a,\nsets out, for example, removal for cause. And if some\nmembers of a group were somehow -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no; they are\njust -- you know, they make the distinction that the\nboard should continue to function.\nMR. KATYAL: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even though their\noriginal delegation was limited to 2010 -\nMR. KATYAL: Right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- they, acting as a\nboard, get to delegate to themselves as the group the\nauthority to go beyond that.\nMR. KATYAL: Right. I suppose that -- I\nmean, it's not presented here but yes, I suppose that\nwould be permissible.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now, what if the\nboard, consisting of five members -- let's say three\nDemocrats and two Republicans -- the three Democrats\ndelegate to a group the authority to act as a board.\nThey designate themselves as the members of the group.\nThey have at that point, authorized themselves to act as\nthe board with as little as two members, even though\nthey couldn't have done that as members of the board.\nMR. KATYAL: I think that's right,\nMr. Chief Justice, and it underscores that the statute\nitself can't control all of those problems and whether\nyou set the quorum at three or two, even if you have a\nfull board of five, you can have these machinations that\nare potentially -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even though the\nwhole -- even though the whole purpose of expanding from\nthree to five was to ensure that more than two are\nrequired for the board to act?\nMR. KATYAL: Well, I think that the purpose,\nas the legislative history reveals, and it's set out in\nour brief, was to increase efficiency and to have\noverlapping panels adjudicating cases. I do think that\nthere's a -- there's ways to prevent your situation from\nhappening; that, and they include not just removal for\ncause, which I think this would be the paradigmatic case\nif three members of the body were trying to cut out two\nmembers from doing their job.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not trying to, but\nsucceeding in doing so.\nMR. KATYAL: Succeeding, absolutely. And I\nthink -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I mean, it\ndepends upon who would remove them for cause.\nMR. KATYAL: Absolutely.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now, who would\nremove them?\nMR. KATYAL: It would be the president.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what if he's\nperfectly content to have two Democrats?\nMR. KATYAL: And then you would have\nother -- you would have other checks as well. If you\nhad one-party government and all of these factors\naligning in the way you are suggesting, you would have\nthe possibility that the circuit court's review under\n160(f) might come into play, I mean, because each board\ndecision can be potentially appealed to a circuit court.\nThere is budgetary processes and -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I just want to make\nsure there is nothing to constrain -- if you have three\nDemocrats, three -- or two Republicans or, of course,\nthe other way around, nothing to constrain them from\nacting fully as the board with only two -- two\nDemocrats?\nMR. KATYAL: I don't think the statute\nitself constrains it -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In the statute.\nMR. KATYAL: -- under either my friend's\nreading or mine. I think that rather, it is a matter of\netiquette, practice, tradition, and all sorts of\ninstitutional checks that are laced into the way in\nwhich the board -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is there any other legal -\nthis is what -- one thing, if I were thinking without\nthe language for a moment, and I -- the Taft-Hartley\nCongress did, I think, want to limit the powers in a\nnumber of ways of the board, maybe expand the membership\nto be sure there would be both parties in larger\nnumbers.\nIf you could limit this to adjudications,\nyou would say, well, then they can't set major policy\nwith just two members. But I don't see a way to do\nthat, particularly since the board has often set rules\nin adjudication which have broad application.\nSo am I right in thinking that we have to\ndecide either, it is okay for two members to set the\nmost major policies, or we have to say they can't even\nconduct adjudication, even the simplest adjudication,\neven the least significant?\nMR. KATYAL: I think -- I think, Justice\nBreyer, that the board traditionally doesn't engage in\nmuch rulemaking. It does make its decisions -\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. But that is a\nrule. They set a rule in the adjudication -\nMR. KATYAL: And I do agree that -- that at\nstake here is the potential to decide cases. Now, when\nyou mention the Taft-Hartley Act, I think that that\nlegislative history is important for a different reason,\nwhich is up in -- from 1935 to 1947, and this is set out\nin footnote 1 of our brief, that board decided over\n460 cases as a two-member body. There was a vacant\nthird position.\nAnd there were 2 years of debate,\ncontentious debate, as you alluded to before, about\nTaft-Hartley, and yet they left that piece intact. They\npermitted two-member bodies to decide these cases. And\nso to the extent legislative history is relevant for\nmembers of the Court, we suggest it strongly suggests\nthat what the board did here, faced with this vacancy\ncrisis, mirrors what happened between 1935 and -\nJUSTICE ALITO: It begs the question -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose -- suppose our\nfirst inquiry were agency law, and we concluded that\nunder agency law when the principal ceases to exist the\nagent may no longer function. Let's assume we conclude\nthat under agency law. Could you then cite us a case or\na rationale for saying that agency law should not apply\nto a government agency, to a problem of this type, and\nif so, what is your authority?\nMR. KATYAL: Sir, they are set out at page\n28 of our brief. They are United States v. Wyder, the\ntwo Donovan cases. I think it is a long-established\nprinciple that principal/agent relationships, which we\ndon't think necessarily apply to this case, but even did\nyou -- even were you to disagree, as the premise of your\nquestion suggested, that government delegations survive\nthe loss of that principal.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is your point that\nofficial acts done stay in effect even though the\nofficial is gone, until the official's successor in\noffice is appointed and that successor can remand the\ninstruction?\nMR. KATYAL: That's -- that's precisely\ncorrect.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But that is like the de\nfacto officer doctrine. It could be that, if the\nPetitioner prevails here, the de facto officer doctrine\nwould leave in place everything that has been done.\nMR. KATYAL: Justice Kennedy, those -\nthat's a different -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But it seems to me that's\nquite a different -- different point.\nMR. KATYAL: Absolutely. That's a different\npoint. What I'm saying and what these cases say is\nthat, for example, when an attorney general designates\ntheir power to -- the wiretap authority to a\nsubordinate, an assistant attorney general, and then\nthat attorney general leaves office, that wiretap\nauthority nonetheless continues in the subordinate until\nit is revoked by a successor.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But hasn't the situation\nthat has prevailed now for some time changed the -- the\ndecision-making process of the board in at least two\nimportant ways? First, there isn't any opportunity for\nfull board review of cases. But more important, if you\nhave only two members on the board and only two members\non the panel, the process is very different from a panel\nin which there were three members, or in which two\nmembers can be supplemented with an additional member if\nthey can't agree.\nWhat are the two to do? They have to -\nthey have to split the difference all the time. And\nthere have been decisions in which the members have -\nbasically have suggested that that's exactly what has\nhappened.\nMR. KATYAL: Justice Alito, I am not here\nsuggesting that the two-member board is ideal or\nequivalent or optimal to a -- an optimal thing.\nCongress set out five. But faced with a vacancy crisis\nand shutting down the board entirely, I think the board\ndid the prudent thing here by continuing to operate,\ncontinuing for these 800 or so days to decide these\ncases.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, not only is the\ntwo-member board not -- not ideal. Do you think it is\nreasonably possible that Congress back in 1947\ncontemplated this particular problem and would have\nsolved it the way you suggest?\nMR. KATYAL: I do think that Congress had\nbefore it a well -- it was well-known that over 460\ntimes the board had decided cases with only two members,\nwith the third being vacant. And I think that's what -\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But that's always when\nthere is -- there is in existence three people who could\nhave served. But the particular problem we've got now,\ngoing on for 2 or 3 years: All the decisions by two\nmembers. Do you think Congress would have authorized\nthis?\nMR. KATYAL: As opposed to shutting down the\nentire board, yes, Justice Stevens. I think that's the\npurpose of the -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It depends. I mean, if\nshutting down is the only way to put pressure on\nCongress to -- I mean, you may have a Congress that is\njust delighted to have only two Democratic members left\non the board and all the cases decided by two Democratic\nmembers. What possible incentive does that Congress\nhave to increase the board to -- to the level that it\nshould be? None.\nIf you want to solve the crisis that you are\nso worried about, the only way to solve it is to say:\nBoy, you know, there is -- it's Armageddon coming; we\nare going to not be able to act at all. That would\nsolve the crisis.\nMR. KATYAL: Well, I think the politics in\nArmageddon could cut different ways, depending -- I\nmean, these are nomination battles that are focused on\nindividual personalities. And, Justice Scalia, the only\nempirical evidence we have -- this is not the first time\nthe board has done this, contrary to my friend's\nsuggestion earlier.\nIn 2005, the board was faced with the exact\nsame situation. The board was going to go down to two\nmembers. They decided to do the exact same delegation\nand give -- give all the powers to a group of three, and\nfour days later, Congress fixed the problem with the\npresident.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm much more impressed\nby -- by your opponent's assertion, which I don't think\nyou have contradicted, that for many years whenever\nthere was a death in one of the three-member panels,\nthat panel was reconstituted. A new person was\nappointed, instead of just letting it continue to\noperate with only two. Doesn't that mean something?\nDoesn't that suggest that these panels were viewed by\nthe board as requiring three people?\nMR. KATYAL: No, it suggests that they\nthought three was optimal, where it was -- where they\ncould get three bodies. But here, when they only have\ntwo -- and again, faced with shutting down and not\ndeciding the lion's share of cases, which aren't the\ncontroversial ones that give rise to the disagreement,\nJustice Alito, that you were positing -- they've decided\nto go and do it -- and do their business and try and\nresolve these.\nAnd they have done, I think -- the corpus\nreveals a really remarkable job at reaching agreement in\na large number of cases on the basis of existing\nprecedent. Are these decisions -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How -- how has it -- how\nhas it worked? And I understand that they are not\ndealing with controversial decisions. How many\ndecisions are there now?\nMR. KATYAL: I believe that there is 586 or\nso decisions that they have rendered, and of those they\nhave set aside about approximately 70. It was 65 as of\na few days ago and it's gone up, because they involve\nquestions about overturning precedent or novel issues,\nand so they haven't reached agreement in those.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What actually\nhappens on -- on the ground? Somebody complains about\nan unfair labor practice to the board, and let's say the\npetitioner prevails and the board can't function. What\nhappens next? Is there -- I don't know if there would\nbe a review or not, but can you go to the court of\nappeals?\nMR. KATYAL: If -- if -- if the board is\ndisabled?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, assume there is\nno board. As you say, the -- the problem that would\nhappen if you don't prevail?\nMR. KATYAL: Well, if there is -- if there\nis no board, then I take it the cases would get stuck\nafter the ALJ. There is nothing to take exception to,\nand so I'm not sure they could go directly to the court\nof appeals, because the statute, 160(f), I think,\ndoesn't permit review from an ALJ decision directly up.\nIt permits review only of the board's decisions. And if\nthere is no board decision, then presumably these cases\nget stuck until we have a three-member quorum.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And is it -- is it correct\nnumerically that, in fact, under identical language\nexcept the word \"and\" changes to \"except for,\" the -\nfrom 1935 to 1947, there were two-member panels and they\ndecided about 400 cases, and then they took the same\nlanguage, and now since 1947, roughly, what are the\nfigures? How many cases? Has it only been this\ninstance where it has been two members or have there\nbeen other instances?\nMR. KATYAL: Well, the -- the board only\nwent down to two members as a whole starting in 1993.\nIt has happened four times: In 1993 for 2 months; in\n2001, I believe for 1 month; in 2005 for only a few\ndays.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is that when the 400 cases\nthat you are talking about were?\nMR. KATYAL: The 460 cases were between 1935\nand 1947.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And 1947. And how many\ncases were decided by two members about, I'm not asking\nfor -- during the times you are talking about before the\npresent two-member boards?\nMR. KATYAL: In -- in -- in 1993 and in\n2001, the board didn't do this, because those were short\nperiods of time. In 2005, they did do precisely what\nthey did here, but Congress resolved the situation, so\nthere are only about 6 cases decided in that 4-day\nperiod. And now from 2007 to now, approximately\n586 cases or so have been decided.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But they never did it when\nthey had a full board?\nMR. KATYAL: They never delegated -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Whenever there was a death\nof one of the members of a three-judge panel or a\nthree-member panel, they filled it and the panel did not\noperate with two?\nMR. KATYAL: Absolutely. We are not\nstanding -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Even though it could have,\neven though the quorum provision was just as it is here.\nMR. KATYAL: It could have, but it's not -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Those panels did not\noperate with two?\nMR. KATYAL: Absolutely. It's not optimal,\nJustice Scalia, to have two. But if -- if the choice is\nshutting down or going with two, the board made the\nchoice in this circumstance to go with more.\nAnd, Justice Breyer, you had mentioned\nbefore the change in the word \"except that,\" and I do\nthink that that is crucial language, because that is a\nsubordinating conjunction. And what it does is\nessentially modify that. The two-member quorum language\nmodifies what happens before, the \"at all times\" -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, you need the \"except\nthat\" once you have language. You need it because now\nyou have a bigger board and it says there is a\nthree-member quorum.\nMR. KATYAL: Precisely.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I thought they -- they\nsimply are taking the earlier phrase, the earlier\nstatutory phrase, and they are changing those words\nbecause grammatically you now need it?\nMR. KATYAL: Precisely correct. You need it\ngrammatically because otherwise if you didn't have\nsomething like that, it would suggest that the panel\nquorum would be three as well. But -- but the language\nis quite specific on this and, contrary to what the D.C.\nCircuit found, \"at all times\" is modified by that\nsubordinating conjunction in the phrase that follows.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what authority\ndoes an ALJ purport and in fact exercise? He's not\nacting or she's not acting for the board?\nMR. KATYAL: The -- the ALJ is appointed by\nthe board and they essentially write tentative decisions\nthat the board, as I understand it, can approve or\ndisapprove. Exceptions can be taken by litigants up to\nthe board.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Under the Petitioner's\ntheory, if there is no quorum would those appointments\nthen be invalidated, too?\nMR. KATYAL: Well, I -- and this goes to\nJustice Scalia's first question of the argument, I -- I\nthink that it's possible. I think that there is -- the\nD.C. Circuit's reasoning is -- potentially could be read\nso broadly as to say that the entire board goes poof and\neverything under it, including the salaries.\nI think if the Court were inclined to -- to\nwrite a decision like that, we would try to look to, as\nyou mentioned before, the de facto officer doctrine and\nthe specific language of the delegations to the ALJ's\nand the specific language to the general counsels, to\ntry to see if there is a way to preserve all of the\nboard's action in this circumstance.\nOf course, that isn't before the Court at\nthis point, but I understand that the dramatic\nconsequences, potentially dramatic consequences of the\nD.C. Circuit's ruling, may inform the judgment.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do -- do we have any notion\nwhen -- when the board will reduce to one?\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: When -- when -- when is one\nof the two's term over?\nMR. KATYAL: In the absence of any further\nconfirmations or other appointments, one of the members,\nMember Schaumber, will leave on August 27th of this\nyear.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of this year. At which\npoint there will be some pressure on Congress, I guess,\nright?\nMR. KATYAL: There will.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There are -- there are\ntwo nominees, are there not?\nMR. KATYAL: There are three nominees\npending right now.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Three?\nMR. KATYAL: Yes. And they have been\npending. They were named in July of last year. They\nwere voted out of committee in October. One of them had\na hold and had to be renominated. That renomination\ntook place. There was a failed quorum -- a failed\ncloture vote in February. And so all three nominations\nare pending. And I think that underscores the general\ncontentious nature of the appointment process with\nrespect to this set of issues.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And the recess\nappointment power doesn't work why?\nMR. KATYAL: The -- the recess appointment\npower can work in -- in a recess. I think our office\nhas opined the recess has to be longer than 3 days.\nAnd -- and so, it is potentially available to avert the\nfuture crisis that -- that could -- that could take\nplace with respect to the board.\nIf there are no other questions -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Richie, you have 3 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SHELDON E. RICHIE\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. RICHIE: First, let me address the -\nthe issue of what happens if we prevail, how will the\nproblem be fixed. There are two types of cases. There\nare representation cases, and then there are cases\ndealing with unfair labor practices.\nThe unfair labor practices,\nMr. Chief Justice, have a limitations period to them.\nThe -- the issues -- the issues with respect to\nrepresentation have no limitations. So in response to\nJustice Ginsburg's comment -- I believe it was\nJustice Ginsburg -- there's a -- when a successor comes\non board, these issues, if these -- if we prevail and\nour decision is vacated, those are -- can be reheard by\nthe board when a successor is in place.\nThe D.C. Circuit -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. Just the -\njust the representation cases, not the unfair labor\npractice cases?\nMR. RICHIE: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wouldn't the -\nMR. RICHIE: Well, except to the extent,\nJustice Scalia, that the statute of limitations has not\nrun on those unfair labor -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, I understand.\nMR. RICHIE: -- cases.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Wouldn't -- wouldn't\nthe statute of limitations at least be told during the\nperiod when they can't do anything? I suppose that's a\ndifferent case.\nMR. RICHIE: That's an argument. That's a\ndifferent case. I don't know the answer. And I'm sure\nthe litigants would argue that.\nWith respect to the issue of the -- whether\nit's three members that are required on both the board\nand the group, the D.C. Circuit didn't deal with that,\nbut they did deal with the exception issue. And they\nsaid -- I'm reading from the appendix page 89 of our\npetition: The board forum requirement therefore must be\nsatisfied regardless of whether the board's authority is\ndelegated to a group of its members.\nA modifying phrase such as -- as this,\ntalking about the \"at all times three members\" denotes\nthat there is no instance in which the board forum\nrequirement may be disregarded.\nAnd then the court said: \"It therefore\ndefies logic as well as the text of the statute to argue\nas the board does that a Congress which explicitly\nimposed a requirement for a three-member quorum at all\ntimes would in the same sentence allow the board to\nreduce its operative quorum to two without further\ncongressional authorization.\"\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Except that it said\n\"except.\"\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: At all times \"except.\"\nMR. RICHIE: And, Justice Ginsburg, that was\nwhat the D.C. Circuit was referring to was the \"except\nthat\" language, and saying in that same sentence, where\nthere is a requirement at all times of a three-member\nquorum of the board, that it is -- it defies logic that\nCongress would in that same sentence state except when\nthere is three that falls to two.\nAnd I think the other thing I would like to\nconclude is that the -- my time's up. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
