KNEEDLER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. KNEEDLER: Justice Stevens, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn 1987, the Secretary of the Interior, at the\nrequest of the Navajo Nation and Peabody Coal Company,\napproved a package of lease amendments to two outstanding\nleases between the parties. With respect to the lease\nprincipally at issue here, Lease number 8580, the\namendments increased the royalty to be paid by Peabody\nfrom 37-and-a-half cents per ton to 12-and-a-half percent\nof the value of the coal, a more than six-fold increase in\nthe amount of the royalty. That new royalty level was the\nsame as the standard royalty on Federal coal leases, and\nit was well in excess of the then regulatory minimum that\nthe Secretary had prescribed for what a tribe and a coal\ncompany could agree to, which was then only 10 cents per\nton.\nThe package of lease amendments also contained\nnumerous other provisions that were of benefit to the\ntribe, including amendments to the other lease, that\nmore -- that approximately doubled the amount of the\nroyalty and a substantial increase in payments for water\nuse at the mines.\nThe Secretary's approval of the lease package in\n1987 fully complied with the Mineral Leasing Act and the\nregulations that the Secretary has prescribed to govern\nher approval of lease agreements under that act.\nBecause there was no violation of any act of\nCongress or regulation of an executive department, much\nless one that could fairly be interpreted as mandating the\npayment of damages by the Government, there is no cause of\naction in this case under the Tucker Act.\nThe Court --\nQUESTION: Is there some other possible cause of\naction? Certainly it was unfortunate, to say the least,\nthat the Secretary of the Interior at the time apparently\nhad private conversations that -- with representatives of\nPeabody Coal to try to discourage the approval of the\n20-dollar rate.\nMR. KNEEDLER: It was unfortunate, Justice\nO'Connor.\nQUESTION: And is there any other remedy for the\ntribe potentially for this action?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I think there -- it -- first of\nall, I --\nQUESTION: Is there a lawsuit now pending --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Not -- not on that basis.\nQUESTION: -- to cover something else?\nMR. KNEEDLER: There's a -- there's a suit by\nthe tribe against Peabody, but -- but the -- as a remedy\nagainst the United States, the only suit would be\nconceivably an APA action.\nI -- I should point out that there was no\nregulation or statute that barred that communication at\nthe time.\nQUESTION: It's the APA action. I mean, is\nthis -- is this a proceeding -- was the proceeding\nsupposed to be a proceeding required by statute to be\ndecided on a record?\nMR. KNEEDLER: No. No, it was not.\nQUESTION: Well, then that's an informal\nadjudication.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right. I'm -- I'm not --\nQUESTION: Ex parte communications take place\nall the time in those situations. So what's unfortunate\nabout it? Maybe it was unfortunate politically, but I\nmean, legally --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right.\nQUESTION: -- is there any -- is there any rule,\nregulation, or anything in the APA that forbids an\nex parte communication --\nMR. KNEEDLER: There was not and there was --\nQUESTION: -- in this circumstance?\nMR. KNEEDLER: There was not and there was not\nin the Secretary's regulations at the time. I did not\nmean to imply --\nQUESTION: Would there be now?\nMR. KNEEDLER: No.\nQUESTION: I mean, I don't know any agency --\nMR. KNEEDLER: No. There's --\nQUESTION: -- that ever forbids of something\nlike that, but I might be wrong. I want to find out about\nit.\nMR. KNEEDLER: No. No, there's -- there's not.\nAnd -- and I didn't mean to imply that an APA suit would\nbe successful. All I meant to say is that that would be\nthe avenue in which to test that because an argument that\nthat was a -- that that was a violation would be\nessentially --\nQUESTION: Violation of what?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Of -- of some -- some standard of\nprocedure of fairness -- procedural fairness I suppose\nthat a court would impose. Again, we don't think that a\ncourt could do that. I -- I simply wanted to say that\nif --\nQUESTION: There are some D.C. Circuit cases\nthat suggest when there's a contest between a valuable\nprivilege, that ex parte communications are not -- not to\nbe permitted.\nMR. KNEEDLER: But that is -- that is not\nsomething, first of all, that -- that appears in a statute\nor regulation, and under Vermont Yankee, which I think\ncame after those D.C. Circuit decisions, it wouldn't be\nproper for a court to impose that on a -- onto an agency.\nIn any event, there was no restriction here.\nQUESTION: The D.C. Circuit used to create its\nown APA before -- before --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: -- before Vermont Yankee.\nMR. KNEEDLER: That's -- that's correct. And\nwe --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. KNEEDLER: We don't think there's any legal\nstandard, but even if there were, that sort of thing is\nnot something that would mandate the payment of -- of\ndamages for a violation.\nQUESTION: The APA suit that you're -- you're\nenvisioning as a potential -- that doesn't have any\ndollars attached to it. That would be for declaratory\ninjunction?\nMR. KNEEDLER: To -- or to set aside the -- the\nSecretary's subsequent approval of the lease or -- or\nsomething of that nature.\nQUESTION: Well, the lease is now expired, I\ntake it.\nMR. KNEEDLER: The lease --\nQUESTION: We're not still operating under that\nsame lease, or are we?\nMR. KNEEDLER: We -- we are. The -- the tribe\nand the -- and the Peabody are still operating under that\nsame lease. It was amended in 1987. This was 3 years\nafter the -- the communication that -- that you're\nreferring to.\nQUESTION: And there's been no application to\nset aside the lease.\nMR. KNEEDLER: There has not. And -- and as\nI -- as I pointed out, there are numerous aspects of the\nlease package that was approved in -- in 1987 that are\nadvantageous to the -- to the tribe.\nQUESTION: And since the events, has the tribe\nobtained the authority to impose taxes that was not\npreviously --\nMR. KNEEDLER: It -- well, the -- this Court in\n1985 in the Kerr-McGee case upheld the right of the Navajo\ntribe to impose taxes, but that's without the Secretary's\napproval. And these lease agreement -- the lease\namendments in 1987 were negotiated and arrived at in -- in\nthe context of that decision.\nNow, the -- the tribe has waived its right to\ncollect taxes with respect to coal that goes to the -- a\ngenerating station in -- in Arizona. The rest of the\ncoal, though, is subject to the -- to the tax. There's an\noverall cap on that.\nQUESTION: Mr. Kneedler, just -- could I just go\nback for a second to the Secretary's private\ncommunications with the -- the coal company? Is it your\nposition that did not breach any fiduciary obligation\nwhatsoever?\nMR. KNEEDLER: No --\nQUESTION: They did not have a fiduciary\nobligation to the tribes?\nMR. KNEEDLER: It did not -- it did not breach a\nlegal fiduciary obligation. There is a -- there is a\nsense in which everything that the Secretary of the\nInterior does or, for that matter, everything the United\nStates Government does with respect to Indians is -- is of\na fiduciary nature in a moral sense. In a political\nsense --\nQUESTION: So at least in that respect, it's\ndifferent from the Vermont Yankee situation.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, but -- but it's important\nto look at the context in which this communication\noccurred. The -- what -- what the -- what the Secretary\nwas being asked to do or -- or what -- what the Interior\nDepartment was being asked to do was to make an adjustment\nunder an existing -- a term of the existing lease that\nsaid that the royalty amount that was then prescribed,\nwhich was 37-and-a-half percent, was subject to a\nreasonable adjustment by the Secretary after the 20-year\nanniversary of the lease.\nQUESTION: Well, isn't it -- isn't it -- maybe I\nmisunderstand the facts. But wasn't it fairly clear that\nhad this conversation not taken place, that the adjustment\nwould have been put into effect that the tribe wanted?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I don't think that's clear at all\nbecause the -- Peabody Coal Company -- aside from this\ncommunication, Peabody Coal Company sent the letter to the\nSecretary of the Interior in early July of 1985 in -- in\nwhich the representative of Peabody said, it appears that\nthe tribe believes that there's an imminent decision in\nits favor on appeal from the local BIA area directors\nsetting the 20 percent rate.\nQUESTION: Which was true, wasn't it?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, yes. That was -- that was\ntrue. But that's a subordinate official in the Interior\nDepartment. The Secretary of the Interior -- as a matter\nof constitutional law, and as a matter of the regulations\nin effect at the time, the Secretary of the Interior had\nthe authority to take control of any matter that was then\npending in the Department.\nBut my important -- the important point is that\nin that letter, Peabody Coal Company requested the\nSecretary to assume jurisdiction over the matter, and to\neither rule in its favor or, failing that, to -- to send\nthe parties -- request the parties to negotiate further,\nwhich is exactly what happened.\nQUESTION: And that letter --\nMR. KNEEDLER:\na copy of that letter was sent to the Navajo Nation. And\nit -- it subsequently is clear that -- deposition\ntestimony of Mr. Nelson, which is in the joint appendix in\nthis case, makes it clear that he understood. He was --\nhe was a special assistant to the chairman of the Navajo\nNation at the time. It makes it clear that -- that the\nNavajo Nation had understood that the Secretary preferred\nfor them to go back to negotiate, which was a -- a\nperfectly reasonable response by the Secretary of the\nInterior in that situation.\nThe -- the increase of the royalty rate from --\nfrom approximately 1 percent or a little over 1 percent to\n20 percent was unilateral by the area director. It --\nthere was not a -- input by -- by Peabody at that time,\neven though the area director communicated with --\nQUESTION: Did both the tribe and Peabody\nunderstand what was being considered, the increase that\nhad been recommended by the junior people in the\nDepartment?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. That -- that -- the -- the\narea director's increase of -- to 20 percent, an\nadjustment of 20 percent, was appealed by -- was appealed\nby Peabody and the utilities that -- that are served by\nPeabody. And that appeal was briefed to the Assistant\nSecretary, and it was pending.\nthat was -- that area director's decision was in 1984.\nThe briefing was, I think, about 6 months later, and then\nin July of 1985, the -- is -- is when the Secretary\nrequested the Assistant Secretary to put off deciding this\nand have the parties negotiate. And they reached a\ntentative agreement within -- within a month. It was --\nQUESTION: If -- if Fritz, the Assistant\nSecretary, had signed off on the 20 percent, would there\nhave been a further -- further recourse by --\nMR. KNEEDLER: The -- the Secretary could have\noverruled that. The -- the Secretary under the -- under\nthe governing regulations that we quote in our brief the\nSecretary retained the authority to overrule any decision\nby -- by the Assistant Secretary.\nQUESTION: Mr. -- I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: There was -- you mentioned in your\nbrief another route, appellate route, that could have been\ntaken in this case which would have rendered a final\ndecision, one not subject to the Secretary's --\nMR. KNEEDLER: No. I believe that could have\nstill been subject to the Secretary's determination.\nWhat -- what the Navajo Nation could have done, if it did\nnot want to continue with negotiations, was to request\nthat the matter be transferred from this informal appeals\nprocess to the Assistant Secretary to a formal appeals\nprocess which goes to the Interior Board of Indian\nAppeals.\nQUESTION: Well, I think --\nMR. KNEEDLER: At that point the Secretary could\nhave assumed jurisdiction of the matter from the IBIA\nunder the same regulation I referred to. The Secretary\nalways had it within his power to -- to take -- take\ncognizance of a case and not leave it with the -- with the\nboard.\nQUESTION: Even if the court --\nMR. KNEEDLER: There was a prohibition against\nex parte contacts in that formal adjudication, but\notherwise the Secretary retained the authority to -- to\ntake the case.\nQUESTION: Mr. -- Mr. Kneedler, did the -- was\nthe Secretary's approval required on the contract that\nincluded, or the -- the revision that included the\n12-and-a-half percent royalty rate?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, there were two leases, and\nthe Secretary's approval was required. But the reason was\ndifferent for the two. In the -- under the lease\nprincipally at issue here, 8580 --\nQUESTION: Let's just take that one.\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- the -- the lease itself had a\nclause that said that the royalty was subject to a\nreasonable adjustment\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- by the Secretary.\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. KNEEDLER: As to that, we believe that there\ncould be no claim under the Tucker Act for the -- for the\nfundamental reason that that is not a -- a duty that is\nprescribed by an act of Congress, or a regulation under\nthe Tucker Act.\nQUESTION: No, no. I -- I understand. Wasn't\nthat also subject to the general statutory requirement\nthat these leases be approved by the Secretary? They --\nyou know, it would be negotiated by the tribes, but\nultimately didn't it require the Secretary's approval?\nMR. KNEEDLER: It -- it may well have and that\nwas not -- that was not addressed. The basis of the claim\nhere was --\nQUESTION: Well --\nMR. KNEEDLER: -- that the Secretary had -- had\na duty under the lease.\nQUESTION: -- let -- let me just assume and --\nand maybe I shouldn't do this, but you just briefly at\nleast assume that the Secretary's approval was required as\na -- a matter of statute. Would that approval\nresponsibility -- in your judgment -- carry any duty\ntoward the tribe, anything comparable to a fiduciary duty\ntoward the tribe not to approve an amendment if that\namendment was not as good as the -- in the Secretary's\njudgment, the tribe could have gotten?\nMR. KNEEDLER: No. There's -- in -- in our view\nthere is no duty under this statute to maximize returns to\nthe tribe.\nQUESTION: What -- Tell -- let me ask you --\nmaybe it would be easier if I asked you kind of the\nconverse question. What responsibility does the approval\nresponsibility include? In other words, is it merely\nministerial, or does it imply any duty at all toward the\ntribe?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I don't know that I would call it\nministerial, but -- but the statute is -- is rather bare\nin its terms. It just says that the -- that the tribe,\nthrough its council -- and this is -- this is a statute of\ngeneral application -- may -- with the approval of the\nSecretary -- lease its land for coal purposes. What\nthe -- what the preconditions for the Secretary to give\nhis approval are then and now is a matter for the\nSecretary to flesh out by regulations.\nQUESTION: So --\nQUESTION: Well, is -- does the United States,\nthough, have some general duty of trust to the tribe?\nMR. KNEEDLER: I think it would be fair to say\nthat -- that there is -- that there is a -- as I said, a\ngeneral moral and political duty.\nQUESTION: Sure. And so when the Secretary has\nto approve a lease, should that general duty be kept in\nmind as part of that process?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Surely. Surely, and again we're\nnot -- we're -- we quite agree that as -- that as a matter\nof what -- what judgment should -- should inform the\nSecretary in her approval of the lease.\nQUESTION: No. But suppose the Government has a\ngeneral moral and political duty to the entire citizenry\nnot to lease Government land at -- at bandit rates I\nassume.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well --\nQUESTION: But that -- but that doesn't --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes, but I meant --\nQUESTION: That doesn't give rise to a cause of\naction.\nMR. KNEEDLER: That -- that's true. Here there\nis --\nQUESTION: Nor -- nor is there any specific\nstatute, is there? I mean, I -- I think the -- the point\nthat Justice O'Connor is -- is raising is -- is my point.\nOnce you get a specific statutory obligation, assuming\nthat approval carries some obligation of care, inquiry,\nwhatever, doesn't that carry with it some of the duty that\nwe normally have in mind when we talk about the trust\nduty, and doesn't that take it out of the sphere of the\nmerely moral and the merely political into the legal?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, that -- let me answer it\nthis way. The Secretary -- as I said, I believe it's up\nto the Secretary to decide how to flesh out the regime for\nher approval of leases and she has done this in the\nregulations including, importantly, now and at the time\nthis lease was -- lease amendments were approved, a\nminimum royalty amount. At the time, it was just 10 cents\nper ton. Now, it's 12-and-a-half percent, which is the\nstandard rate of --\nQUESTION: But a minimum -- a minimum is a\nminimum.\nMR. KNEEDLER: No.\nQUESTION: So there's still something to argue\nabout there, I would --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, no. And it's important to\nunderstand why -- why I -- I think that's not correct the\nway the Secretary's regulations are written.\nThis act has a number of goals, one of which is\nrevenue for the tribe, but another is tribal self-\ndetermination, and this is clear from the legislative\nhistory of the Indian Mineral Leasing Act as described in\n1938 and described by this Court in its Cotton Petroleum\ndecision. So the -- the point is that it is up to the\ntribe to enter into agreements subject to approval by the\nSecretary.\nQUESTION: Well, then I -- I think the\nimplication of your argument is that the approval is\npurely ministerial. In other words, if the tribe is the\nresponsible party, then the Government is not.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, the -- the -- it's actually\nsomething of a hybrid I -- I believe. And what the\nSecretary has chosen to impose on herself, which is not\nthe same thing as to whether it's -- it's legally\nenforceable, is a set of regulations that would govern the\nway in which she approves a lease. And with respect to --\nagain, with respect to royalty, there is a specific\nregulation that says 12-and-a-half percent.\nWhat -- the way the Secretary has -- has\naccommodated these competing goals is that there is a -- a\nminimum set of standards to which any agreement between a\ntribe and a lessee enter into, any -- a set of standards\nthat must be satisfied. Beyond that -- beyond those --\nsatisfaction of those standards, it is up to the tribe and\nthe -- and the lessee --\nQUESTION: Well, all right. That's, I take it,\ntheir argument -- as I understand their argument, or part\nof it anyway, is that if you put -- we hold property in\ntrust for the tribe. That by itself doesn't do much for\nthem. That's Mitchell I.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right.\nQUESTION: But when you get a whole lot of very\ndetailed rules and regulations about how the Government\nneeds to behave, well, then, you find that there is a\nspecific duty for the Government even if it isn't quite in\nthose rules and regulations to behave like a trustee of a\ntrust, i.e., use prudent care, reasonable care, whatever\nthe standards are.\nSo they're saying whatever the details of the\nregs are here, there certainly was a highly detailed set\nof something that governed how the Government would behave\nin this particular lease complexity, a very complicated\nsituation. And therefore, regardless of what they said,\nthere was also, because of that complexity, an obligation\nfor the Government to use reasonable, prudent care no\nmatter what the regs said.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well --\nQUESTION: And that's what they didn't do here.\nYou see, it's just like Mitchell II.\nMR. KNEEDLER: But it's -- it's not just like\nMitchell II.\nQUESTION: All right. Now, what's your response\nto that?\nMR. KNEEDLER: And I -- and I think the\nimportant difference is in Mitchell II the Court recited a\nnumber of specific statutory duties -- statutory and\nregulatory duties that were directed at assuring a\nparticular amount of income for the tribe under the\ncircumstances. Fair market value for a right-of-way.\nSustained yield management of -- of timber harvest.\nSpecific statutory directives to take into account the\nfinancial needs of the beneficiaries whose allotments were\ngoing to be logged off.\nQUESTION: I see where you're going. I see\nwhere you're going with that. But that reads Mitchell II\nvery narrowly. And it is as if in that forest filled with\nGovernment foresters that the tribe members had to stay\nout of, one day a forester working for the Government\nintroduces some termites into the trees, and lo and\nbehold, there doesn't happen to be a particular anti-\ntermite regulation. I think you'd read Mitchell II as\neven though there's no anti-termite regulation, still\nthere was a duty of care there for the Government not to\nbehave that way.\nMR. KNEEDLER: I -- I -- I don't think so. I\nmean, again, there may be -- there may be a tort action.\nThe -- the Tucker Act does not cover the entire\nuniverse --\nQUESTION: So if I think --\nQUESTION: Termites are good for trees.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: You know, they're -- they're not good\nfor houses, but they're good for trees.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: No. These are bad anti-tree\ntermites.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. KNEEDLER: But the --\nQUESTION: If -- if I read Mitchell II somewhat\nmore broadly and thought that there was an obligation\nthere to behave like a trustee even if I couldn't pin it\nto a particular reg, this particular action, would I then\nhave to decide against you here?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, no, because we -- we think\nthat there was -- that the Secretary's approval of the --\nof the lease amendments in 1987 satisfied a duty of\nreasonable prudence. The standard that was articulated in\nthe documents presented to the Secretary for approval\nwas -- was whether the lease package could be regarded as\na reasonable exercise of -- of business judgment. This\nwas set forward --\nQUESTION: Well, but that -- that argument sort\nof takes the lease terms simply in the context of the --\nthe 12-and-a-half percent minimum that the Secretary had\ntaken. But it seems to me that they have a stronger\nargument and it is closer to the termite argument. And\nthe stronger argument is whatever your obligations as a\ntrustee may be under the approval responsibility, you at\nleast have an obligation not to skew the bargaining\nprocess in a way that hurts us when you know that is what\nit will do.\nAnd as I understand the argument about the\nex parte communication, it's not that the ex parte\ncommunication was per se unlawful. It -- it clearly\nwasn't. The argument is that the ex parte communication\nresulted in action by the Secretary that, in effect,\ninduced the tribe to take a different negotiating posture\nfrom the one it would have taken. And therefore, their\nargument is like the termite argument: You're not\nsupposed to introduce bad termites into the forest, and\nyou're not supposed to take action as a minimum that hurts\nus as negotiators.\nWhat is your response to that?\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, several things. The -- the\ntermite example is different, first of all, in that it has\nan immediate physical impact on the -- on the trees -- the\nsubstance of the trust. What you're describing is a\nprocedural -- is -- is at bottom a procedural --\nQUESTION: It makes trees less valuable. This\nmakes coal less valuable under the contract. They get\nhurt.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Well, the -- the -- secondly,\nthe -- there is no indication that the substance of the\ncommunications was any different from the -- from what the\ntribe knew anyway, which was that Peabody had requested\nthe Secretary not to act and to allow the parties to\nreturn to negotiations. But beyond that, when they --\nthen the -- this -- this -- these are all things that\nhappened in 1984 and 1985. That was superseded by the\nparties' lease agreement in 1987.\nIn 1987, as part of the lease agreement that was\nsubmitted to the Secretary and that the Navajo Nation\nrequested that the Secretary approve, the area director's\ndecision that initially established a 20 percent rate\nunilaterally was vacated and Peabody's appeal was\ndismissed. That wiped the slate clean for everything that\nhappened up until then.\nThe question then is what is -- was the 1987\nlease amendment package proper? And under Mitchell, as we\nsee it, unless there is a violation of a specific\nstatutory or regulatory provision in the approval of the\nlease, there cannot be a claim for money damages under the\nTucker Act. And --\nQUESTION: Mr. Kneedler, you had started to\nexplain that the -- the responsibility, or the authority\ncame out of the lease itself with respect to -- to the\nmain lease --\nMR. KNEEDLER: Right.\nQUESTION: -- that we're talking about. But\nthen you said that there was also Secretary approval\ninvolved in the one where it wasn't a term of the lease.\nI think you started to say that.\nMR. KNEEDLER: Yes. In -- in 1987, what the\nparties presented to the Secretary was not a proposal to\nadjust the royalty under the -- Article VI of the existing\nlease. It was a set of new amendments that, among other\nthings, superseded that clause of the lease and put in\nplace another dispute resolution mechanism for adjusting\nthe royalties in the future. As part of that, the -- the\ncontroversy with respect to the 1985 -- 1984 to 1985\nadjustment was -- was eliminated.\nBut that 1987 package provided well in excess of\nthe minimum royalty rate both for the 8580 lease and also\nthe other lease with -- for the Navajo with respect to\ncoal it owned jointly with the Hopi Tribe. And that\nsatisfied the specific regulatory standard that the\nSecretary had prescribed for deciding when she would\napprove lease agreements.\nQUESTION: What I can't quite understand with\nreference to your position as to the correct reading of\nMitchell II is this: It seems to me you say that even if\nthere's a breach of a fiduciary duty, there still has to\nbe some specific statute or regulation which we violate,\nand that specific statute or regulation must imply that\nthere is a cause of action for damages. That makes the\nfiduciary component quite irrelevant. Either there's a\nspecific statute, or there isn't.\nMR. KNEEDLER: No, I don't think it does because\nit -- the fiduciary -- the important discussion in\nMitchell II of the fiduciary responsibility had to do with\nwhether the specific statutory or regulatory duty -- which\nis prong one -- could in turn be fairly interpreted to\nrequirement -- require the payment of compensation.\nThat's where the fiduciary obligation comes in.\nBut this case fails at the first step because\nthere is no specific statutory or regulatory provision\nthat was violated. There's no need to get to the second\nstep in the analysis on that theory.\nAnd this specificity requirement was reflected\nin Testan and Sheehan, both of which were decided prior\nto -- to Mitchell.\ngranted with specificity.\nIt's also confirmed by things that have happened\nsince then. That's the way the Federal Circuit in the\nBrown and Pawnee decisions that we -- that were cited in\nthe decision below looked at Mitchell -- Mitchell II.\nThere had to be a specific provision that was violated.\nAnd that's also entirely consistent with last\nyear's decision in the Gonzaga case under -- under the\nvery parallel situation of 1983 where the Court said there\nhas to be a -- a right granted with specificity -- an\nentitlement granted with specificity -- where the question\nis whether a -- a -- another Federal statute gives rise to\na cause of action under a general cause of action creating\na statute, in that case 1983. But we think the analysis\nis directly parallel.\nIf I may, I'd like to reserve the balance of my\ntime for rebuttal.\nQUESTION: Mr. Frye.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL E. FRYE\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. FRYE: In listening -- Mr. -- Justice\nStevens, and may it please the Court:\nIn listening to the Government, it's clear that\nthe Government has not come to terms yet with the basic\nprinciple established in Mitchell II, that where Congress\ngives the Federal Government control of Indian property,\nthat control necessarily implicates trust duties. And\nviolations of trust duties, when the Government is\nexercising responsibilities, within the contours of those\nstatutes and regulations, gives rise to a claim for money\ndamages in the Court of Federal Claims. That's what's\nmissing.\nQUESTION: Mr. Frye, the Government has stressed\nthat this is not a control situation like Mitchell II.\nRather, like Mitchell I, one of the objectives of this\nlegislation of IMLA was to give the tribe the management\nand control authority, and the Government had just a\nsecondary role of approving at the end of the road. But\nunlike the -- the United States was running the timber\noperation. Here, it's the tribe that's negotiating the\nlease. It seems to me that's quite different.\nMR. FRYE: That's a two-part question. One,\nafter the Navajo tribe signed the coal lease in 1964, it\nhad absolutely no control over anything. I'd like to read\nyou one -- just one regulation, one operating regulation,\nthat the Secretary has. It empowers -- and this is at\npage 44 of our lodging. This is BLM's responsibility, not\neven BIA who has the principal responsibility. BLM has\nthe responsibility to, quote, oversee exploration,\ndevelopment, production, resource recovery and protection,\ndiligent development, continued operation, preparation,\nhandling, product verification, and abandonment\noperations.\nQUESTION: Oversee. What does oversee mean?\nDid it do that or oversee it? I mean --\nMR. FRYE: Oh, the Secretary doesn't mine coal\nanymore than the BIA cuts timber, but BIA sells timber to\nprivate timber companies to do the timber-cutting. The\nBIA oversees that timber production in the same way it\noversees the coal operation.\nQUESTION: I'm not sure that that's anything\nmore specific than the general trust responsibility that\nthe United States has. It has to oversee the disposition\nof all the lands that it holds in trust, but I'm not sure\nthat that's the kind of control that -- that we were\ntalking about in Mitchell II.\nMR. FRYE: Well, Mitchell II control is\nabsolutely parallel. The same --\nQUESTION: What -- what about --\nMR. FRYE: Yes, the second part of your\nquestion.\nQUESTION: The purpose of IMLA was to help the\nIndians exercise their own sovereignty.\nMR. FRYE: IMLA has come before this Court\nseveral times.\nin 1968, the Government looked at IMLA and said this\nstatute imposes trust responsibilities and trust duties on\nthe Government. It said that three times in that\ndecision.\nQUESTION: Does it waive sovereign immunity in\nthe statute for purposes of monetary damages against the\nGovernment? It doesn't do so expressly.\nMR. FRYE: It doesn't do so expressly just as\nthe -- the timber statutes didn't do so expressly in\nMitchell II. But it has that same overlay of\ncomprehensive Federal control and regulation.\nQUESTION: That's true, but -- but the\nGovernment had a good response to my question, which was\nthat if, in fact, I was agreeing with you for the purposes\nof interpreting Mitchell II hypothetically, they said, you\nknow, this is a procedure, and it's a procedure that\nyou're complaining was violated. And that's significant\nfor two reasons. First, it would read this trust\nresponsibility as creating procedures in identical\ncircumstances where a party is an Indian tribe that do not\nexist in respect to anyone else, and secondly, it would be\nfinding a -- money damages, $600 million in fact, for a\nviolation of this -- one of these procedural regulations.\nAnd I cannot even think -- though there may be\nsome, I cannot think of an instance where a private person\nwho really has been badly hurt can recover money damages\nfrom the Government where what the Government did was not\nfollow the right procedure. So it's new procedures, plus\nthe money damages, and you'd have to overcome all those\nhurdles.\nMR. FRYE: Okay. We are not complaining,\nJustice Breyer, about any procedural problem. What we are\ncomplaining is -- is about the Secretary colluding with\nPeabody Coal Company to swindle the Navajo Nation. That's\nwhat this case is all about.\nQUESTION: That's -- that's -- tell me a little\nbit less pejoratively and --\nMR. FRYE: I will tell you.\nQUESTION: -- more specifically. Yes.\nMR. FRYE: Yes. The -- the memorandum that\nSecretary Hodel hand-delivered to Fritz, every word of\nthat was penned by Peabody's lawyers in -- in the\nadministrative appeal, and that's shown in the joint\nappendix --\nQUESTION: Again, that's -- you know, in a\nparticular context, that might be terrible, but when\nyou're talking about administration, it's a very common\nthing for parties to submit proposed findings, et cetera.\nSo I don't know about this circumstance, but that -- that\nin and of itself is -- is not obviously it.\nMR. FRYE: That wasn't my entire answer.\nFollowing that, the Secretary of the Interior\nbasically instructed his subordinate to lie to the Navajo\nNation so it would not know what went on. The -- and that\nsubordinate was the last person that the Navajo Nation\nwould have expected to deceive it. That person had worked\nwith Navajo Chairman Peterson Zah on the reservation and\nhad named his son Peterson Zah Vollmann.\nAfter that, the negotiations were skewed, as\nJustice Souter mentioned. The Navajo Nation thought,\nbecause of these odd communications coming from\nWashington, that its trustee thought that the 20 percent\nfigure was vulnerable on the merits. We're talking about\na breach of trust. And the -- the question is whether\nthe --\nQUESTION: Maybe he did think it was vulnerable\non the merits. I mean, couldn't the Secretary think that?\nMR. FRYE: The record -- the record shows\nabsolutely no consideration by the Secretary. The\nstandard that was at play here --\nQUESTION: Well, isn't -- isn't that -- isn't\nthat was -- isn't that the representation that Peabody\nmade to the Secretary, that that was just an enormous\nincrease in the -- in the fee?\nMR. FRYE:\nPeabody wrote to Secretary Hodel that was mentioned by my\nbrother Kneedler actually didn't get to Hodel's office.\nThe record shows that that -- that that letter was routed\ndirectly to Fritz, code 200 on the document, and that\nFritz gave it to his solicitors who were working on his\nopinion, and those --\nQUESTION: No. I understand that. But -- but\ndon't you think in the ex parte -- the -- the oral\nex parte contact, the same point was made? What --\nMR. FRYE: We have no idea what was made.\nQUESTION: Well, what do you guess they made?\nI mean, why wouldn't they have made the same point that\nwas in their letter? My goodness, all of a sudden,\nyou're -- you're upping our -- our cost 20 times? I mean,\nyou know, that's incredible.\nMR. FRYE: That's -- that's not the context of\nthis discussion. The -- the royalty rate was upped to\n20 percent a year before. We had had extensive briefing,\nstudies done by the Department of the Interior, all of\nwhich said that 20 percent was the right number. The\nSecretary of the Interior had no basis for saying it was\nthe wrong number.\nQUESTION: What is the number today?\nMR. FRYE: The number today --\nQUESTION: Today.\nMR. FRYE: -- is less than the Federal minimum\nof 12-and-a-half percent. And we proved that, and that's\nin our proposed finding of fact number 315 that it was --\nQUESTION: What -- has the tribe asked to set\naside this lease?\nMR. FRYE: We have not. We didn't learn about\nthis until discovery in this case.\nQUESTION: Well, you know about it now. I mean,\ndoes the tribe want out from under this lease?\nMR. FRYE: We have sued Peabody, and there are\naspects of that that deal with reformation of the lease.\nBut we don't have any ability to get past damages from the\nGovernment for breach of trust for the time period for\nwhich this activity was concealed.\nQUESTION: I don't -- I don't understand what\nthe breach of trust consists of. Number one, it -- you --\nyou acknowledge it doesn't consist in the -- in the ex\nparte contract. I -- contact. I assume that any trustee\ndoes -- does not have an obligation to call in the -- the\ncestui que trust whenever -- whenever a lessee wants to\ntalk about something. I'm sure many trustees deal ex\nparte.\nMR. FRYE: No -- no trustee has the ability to\nbe disloyal, actively disloyal to the -- to the\nbeneficiary.\nQUESTION: I'm not -- I'm not talking about\nactively -- I'm just talking about the ex parte --\nreceiving ex parte presentations --\nMR. FRYE: The Secretary --\nQUESTION: -- from somebody who wants -- who\nwants a lease altered. Can -- can an ordinary trustee do\nthat?\nMR. FRYE: The -- the Secretary and any ordinary\ntrustee can receive all the communications he wants.\nQUESTION: Absolutely.\nMR. FRYE: If the question is what the Secretary\ndid in response to that --\nQUESTION: All right, and so -- so then you --\nyou're down to what the Secretary did in response. That\ndepends on what the Secretary's obligation is, I -- I\npresume.\nMR. FRYE: Yes.\nQUESTION: And as I read the statute and\nregulations, the Secretary's only obligation was to assure\nthat a very low minimum was -- was complied with. And\nafter that, the negotiation was up to the tribe. Is that\na fair representation of -- of what the statute and regs\nrequire?\nMR. FRYE: The statutes and regulations did\nrequire minimum royalty rates, and as this Court held --\nQUESTION: Which are very low.\nMR. FRYE: Very low. Absurdly low. I mean,\nthe -- the Government would say to this Court if we had\napproved -- if we had misled the Navajo Nation so badly\nthat it would have taken 11 cents a ton, we could approve\nthe 11 cents a ton because the minimum royalty rate was\n10 cents a ton even though we knew it was worth $4 a ton\nin royalty.\nQUESTION: Yes, but -- I'm actually having\nexactly the same problem.\nMR. FRYE: Okay.\nQUESTION: What precisely is it that breached\nthe trust, without any characterization?\nMR. FRYE: Yes.\nQUESTION: Who said -- what is the act that's\nsupposed to be the breach of the fiduciary duty? It's\nnot, you're saying now, the procedure of ex parte\ncommunication. It is -- and then you said there was a\nmisrepresentation. What was that? I mean, are there\nother things too?\nMR. FRYE: Yes. There are a variety of things\nthat led the tribe to accept Peabody's proposed package\nof -- of lease concessions from our standpoint, and the --\nthe breach --\nQUESTION:\nMR. FRYE: -- the culminating events of the\nbreach --\nQUESTION: Can I interrupt you, sir? Could --\ncould you specify what the variety is because I want to\nknow the same thing Justice Breyer wants to know.\nMR. FRYE: Yes. The culminating event was the\napproval of a lease for a less than 12-and-a-half percent\nroyalty rate where the tribe gives up -- has a negative\nbonus of $89 million in back --\nQUESTION: All right. But that's -- that's a\nlease that the -- that the tribe at that point had agreed\nto. Would you specify what the Government did or said,\nnumber one, that led the tribe to act differently from the\nway it would have acted otherwise?\nMR. FRYE: But for the Secretary's intervention,\n20 percent would have been slipped in as the new royalty\nrate.\nQUESTION: What intervention? Precisely what?\nMR. FRYE: The -- the memo that Peabody's\nlawyers wrote that Secretary Hodel signed telling the\ndeciding official to stop action.\nQUESTION: Well, now wait a minute. When --\nwhen the Secretary exercises his authority to approve\nleases, is it your -- is it your contention that the only\nobligation -- not to approve leases, but to -- but to --\nto give effect to that provision of the lease which allows\nhim to increase the lease rates -- that's what we're\ntalking about here. When he -- when he approaches that\nobligation, is it your contention that his only duty is to\nthe tribe?\nMR. FRYE: Yes. That -- that is the --\nQUESTION: He should raise it -- he should raise\nit 5,000 percent if he can get away with it?\nMR. FRYE: The --\nQUESTION: Surely --\nMR. FRYE: The key modifier is if he can get\naway with it.\nQUESTION: -- I just don't read it that way. It\nseems to me that no -- anybody would be crazy to enter\ninto a lease like that. One would expect that the -- that\nthe Secretary would act fairly. Sure, take into account\nwhat's fair for the tribe, but also what's fair for the\ncoal company that entered into a lease at a much lower\nrate earlier at arm's length. You think he -- you think\nthe Secretary couldn't take into account what's fair for\nthe coal company at all.\nMR. FRYE: What the Secretary had to take into\naccount is provided by the language of Article VI of the\nlease. The adjustment had to be reasonable. And to --\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. FRYE: And to find that out, the\nSecretary's --\nQUESTION: And reasonable doesn't mean whatever\nwill give the tribe the most money. It also certainly\nincludes what -- what's fair for the -- for the person\nwho -- on the other side of the lease who -- who is\nsuddenly getting socked with a 20-fold increase. I don't\nthink that's unreasonable at all for the Secretary to take\nthat into account.\nMR. FRYE: The Secretary can't doff his trust\nresponsibilities by donning the mantel of an\nadministrator. If it's reasonable, that means I think\nnecessarily that the Secretary can't set it so high as to\nbankrupt the operation and stop the coal mining.\nQUESTION: But that may be, but there must be a\nstatute -- there must be a statute that turned over to the\nSecretary or his office the job of interpreting that word\nreasonable in the lease. What -- what's that statute?\nMR. FRYE: That would be the Indian Mineral\nLeasing Act.\nQUESTION: And it gives the Secretary -- and\nyou're saying that that statute, when it gives the\nSecretary the power to decide what is or is not reasonable\nunder the lease, means that the Secretary must really just\ntake the Indians' point of view into account?\nMR. FRYE: Absolutely not. He needs to exercise\nindependent judgment to make sure that whatever the\nroyalty rate that he is going to substitute for the\noriginal one is reasonable.\nQUESTION: Is fair, in other words, to\neverybody.\nMR. FRYE: I think fair is not a bad\ncharacterization. Fair and reasonable.\nQUESTION: Okay. Then -- well, but then what's\nthe -- the breach here? He was doing apparently what he\nthought was fair, I guess. I mean, maybe it was -- maybe\nhe was wrong, but --\nMR. FRYE: The Secretary was not doing what he\nthought was fair. The -- Peabody sent his best friend in\nthere with his pocket full of Peabody's money and -- and\nit was -- and that's in the records. It's $13,000 for a\ncouple of hours of work. And he says, my clients have\nlearned that there is a decision coming down that's going\nto hurt them. Put a stop to it. And the Secretary did.\nThere was no independent judgment.\nQUESTION: That $13,000 didn't go to the\nSecretary, did it?\nMR. FRYE: Oh, there's no -- absolutely --\nQUESTION: That was -- that was for the\nlobbyist.\nMR. FRYE: It was for the lobbyist. And\nfrankly, he was underpaid for this -- this bit of\nskullduggery.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: I agree with you.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FRYE: I'd like to get back to Justice\nGinsburg's question about the second purpose of the\nstatute. Here, the Department of the Interior thwarted\nboth purposes of the statute. It thwarted our independent\nability to have a -- to exercise our self-determination in\nan informed way. It disinformed us so that we couldn't\nexercise informed self-determination. And -- and that's\nwhat the judge in the Court of Federal Claims said. He\nsaid, a negotiator's weapon is knowledge. And unaware of\nthese things, the Navajo Nation was without critical\nknowledge, and in fact, the record shows that the\nSecretary was giving this knowledge and more to the people\nwho were negotiating against us. So we didn't have that\nability --\nQUESTION: May I just interrupt? Mr. Kneedler\nsaid that this really was all contained in the letter that\nwas sent to the Secretary with copies to the tribe\nearlier.\nMR. FRYE:\nincluded in that letter, and -- and the tribe did get a\ncopy of that letter. But we didn't know that the\nSecretary had acted on Peabody's request. In fact, the\nSecretary told us the opposite.\nQUESTION: But didn't you know that at least --\ndidn't you know at least it was a possibility as long as\nthe letter was on the table?\nMR. FRYE: I guess that -- it certainly would be\na possibility.\nBut there -- there was sort of a law of the case\nthat developed in this administrative procedure. Peabody\nmade the same request of Secretary Clark, and\nSecretary Clark said to his Assistant Secretary Fritz,\nwhat should I do with this? So Fritz asked everybody, do\nyou want me to stay this so you can negotiate? The Navajo\nNation said no.\nFritz then wrote everybody saying, we've gotten\nyour letter. You wanted us to set aside this procedure so\nyou can negotiate. Not everyone wants to negotiate. So\nwe're going to continue. That was kind of the law of the\ncase here.\nGetting back to Justice Breyer's question, the\nculminating event was the approval of a lease at\nsub-12-and-a-half percent rates when every Federal study\nsaid the royalty rate ought to be 20 percent. There was\nno other Federal study. And that was a breach of the duty\nof care.\nThis Court has said in the Kerr-McGee case that\nthe basic purpose of the Indian Mineral Leasing Act --\nQUESTION: Excuse me.\nMR. FRYE: -- was to maximize revenues.\nQUESTION: It wasn't -- it -- more precisely it\nwasn't the approval of a lease. It was the approval of --\nof the -- the raise of the figure that was contained in a\nlease that had already been concluded.\nMR. FRYE: That is incorrect, sir.\nQUESTION: That is incorrect?\nMR. FRYE: Yes.\nQUESTION: Why?\nMR. FRYE: Volume II of the joint appendix in\nthis Court includes both the original lease and these coal\nlease amendments, and they're virtually totally different\ndocuments. There's new tax waivers. There's a new\ndedication of 90 million tons of coal. There's a -- for\nthe north lease and for the other lease another\n180 million tons of coal, all without a competitive bid.\nSo we not only didn't get the Federal minimum,\nwe certainly didn't get 20 percent. We didn't get the\nFederal minimum of 12-and-a-half percent, and we had to\npay a bonus to the companies of $89 million to get what we\ngot.\nQUESTION: But you got a severance tax as part\nof the package, and one of the things that the Government\nsuggested is if -- if you take the 12 percent and you add\nthe 8 percent, then you get up to the 20 percent, which\nwas your figure.\nMR. FRYE: Justice Ginsburg, we had the tax\nbefore all of this happened. And as -- as my brother\nKneedler mentioned to the Court, we can't tax 60 percent\nof the coal because it goes to the Navajo generating\nstation which has a tax waiver in the plant site lease.\nSo we're capped at the 12-and-a-half percent royalty level\nfor 60 percent of the coal. And before we entered into\nthese lease amendments, we were not restricted in the\namount of taxes that the Navajo Nation could impose.\nQUESTION: And as I understand it now, it's --\nwhat you're saying, it's just as if the trees in Mitchell\nwhere the money from the tree was supposed to go to the\nIndians, if the Government had cut it down and sold it for\na half a cent a tree.\nMR. FRYE: That's correct.\nQUESTION: All right. And all this other stuff\nwith the procedures is just evidentiary of what was going\nwrong. But what was going wrong is it's like selling the\ntrees at too low a price, if they were supposed to go to\nthe -- the tribe, if the proceeds had been. That's --\nthat's the -- basically the argument.\nMR. FRYE: I think that's right. The damage-\ncausing activity finally was the approval of these\ndamaging lease amendments.\nQUESTION: Was the price above the minimum that\nthe Secretary's regulations provided for?\nMR. FRYE: Yes.\nQUESTION: Well, it seems to me the problem then\nwas with the Secretary's regulation, not with what went on\nhere. That regulation was invalid as arbitrary,\ncapricious --\nMR. FRYE: No. The regulation only set a\nminimum royalty, and as this Court --\nQUESTION: But that's -- but that's the point,\nI mean, in order to leave full negotiating authority to\nthe tribe. And what you're saying is that minimum is so\nlow that it -- it produces, you know, highway robbery. It\nseems to me that the problem is -- is with the regulation\nand maybe you can get at it when the regulation is applied\nthis way. I don't know.\nMR. FRYE: The -- in Mitchell II, for example,\nthere was a claim -- the Mitchell II claims did not track,\nby the way, specific statutory and regulatory provisions.\nThere was a claim, for example, that was upheld for the\nfailure of the Department of the Interior to -- to develop\na system of roads and easements conducive to timber\nharvesting. There was no statute that required that.\nThere was no regulation that required that. That was part\nof the trust duty.\nAnd there was one other claim that was upheld in\nMitchell II, and a statute said, you -- if you're going to\ndeposit these monies into the Federal Treasury, the\nFederal Government has to get at least 4 percent. It was\na minimum 4 percent rate. And the allottees and tribe in\nthe Mitchell case said, just by turning around you could\nhave gotten 8 percent, and the court below said, yes, you\ncan't be satisfied as trustee with the minimum rate. You\nhave to at least strive for the ceiling. And that was\nupheld. That claim was upheld here.\nSo there were several claims in Mitchell II that\nwere not tracking any specific --\nQUESTION: There was not in Mitchell II a\nstatute that -- that sought to place the negotiating power\nin the hands of the Indians rather than in the hands of\nthe Government. I mean, that's what distinguishes this\ncase. You have here a scheme that is meant to -- meant to\nplace the tribe in -- in charge of its own fate, and --\nand it effectively tells the Secretary, we don't want you\nto negotiate these leases.\nMR. FRYE: Actually that's incorrect. The\nstatutory scheme in Mitchell II, section 406(a), said that\nthe -- the Indians could -- or could sell their timber\nwith the consent of the Secretary. It's the exact same\nstructure as we have here. What we have here is the\nIndians can lease their coal with the approval of the\nSecretary of the Interior. The approval has a real\nhistory.\nQUESTION: It's certainly not how -- how the\nCourt described it in Mitchell II because the Court spoke\nabout exclusive control, that the United States did all\nthe negotiating, that -- and it made all the arrangements.\nNow, whatever you -- you say, you have to deal with what\nis in that opinion, and it does stress the exclusive\ncontrol of the United States and distinguishes the prior\ncase on the ground that the other case was designed to\ngive the Indians autonomy to deal for themselves.\nMR. FRYE: The -- the Secretary certainly had\nexclusive control over whether to approve this\ntransaction, whether to allow the trust asset to be sold\nor not. He had exclusive control over that, and that is\nwithin the contours of the statutes and regulations.\nAnd I --\nQUESTION: I thought that the -- the authority\ncame from the lease from the term that the -- that the\ntribe agreed to, that the -- the authority to adjust the\nroyalty in this case comes from the lease, not from any\nstatute or regulation. Isn't that true?\nMR. FRYE: That's correct. Of course, that\nlease itself was approved by the Secretary of the Interior\nas trustee of these --\nQUESTION: Wait. I thought you said some of\nthese were new leases. I mean, that's what confuses me.\nWhen I was making that point earlier, you said no, some of\nthem were new leases. Now, the authority to adjust the\nrate for the new leases certainly didn't exist in the old\nlease, did it?\nMR. FRYE: That's not even at issue. There\nis -- there is no secretarial authority to adjust the rate\nin the new lease.\nQUESTION: Well, that -- that's right. So some\nof your complaint does not rest upon the provision in the\noriginal lease that gives the Secretary the power to\nadjust the rate.\nMR. FRYE: Yes. I -- I think in response to\nJustice Breyer, the -- the event that caused the damages\nhere was the improvident approval, without observation\nof --\nQUESTION: Of the new leases.\nMR. FRYE: Of the new leases. That is correct.\nQUESTION: So that -- and that -- that's --\nthere isn't a -- sort of like a statute that says,\nSecretary, give an approval or not. What there is is the\ntribe negotiates something. Then they have the\ndirector -- the area director, say, okay, that's all right\nbecause the tribe asked him to say. And then somebody\napprove -- appeals to the Department of the Interior under\na regulation of the Interior Department allowing any\naggrieved party to go appeal. And then the Secretary\nintervenes in that, and then they don't tell the tribe.\nAnd because they don't tell the tribe, the tribe enters\ninto a different lease. That's really what happened.\nMR. FRYE: Yes.\nQUESTION: And it's hard to fit that into the\nmodel of the Secretary charging a penny for a tree. The\nSecretary, in a sense, didn't charge anything for\nanything.\nMR. FRYE: The Secretary allowed this trust\nasset to be conveyed for what he knew to be about half of\nits value.\nNow, the approval requirement has a history,\ngoing back to the first administration of George\nWashington. In the Trade and Intercourse Acts, Congress\nfirst erected what this Court has called the strong shield\nof Federal law, to prevent Indians from being despoiled in\ntheir property. And Congress, when it legislates,\nlegislates against this rich history, this background in\nthe context of the approval requirement.\nIn the Anicker case in 1987, in a leasing\ncontext, the -- the Court said that the -- this strong\nshield of Federal -- of Federal law was designed to\nprotect the Indians from the designs of those who would\ntake their property for less than fair compensation.\nThat's the -- that's the meat of the approval --\nQUESTION: Okay. So you're saying the approval\nwas wrong for two reasons, I guess. Number one, the rate\napproved was less than half fair value.\nMR. FRYE: Correct.\nQUESTION: So that, in effect, every -- every\nlease that was approved at the 12-and-a-half percent was\nwrongly approved.\nMR. FRYE: No. This is extraordinarily valuable\ncoal. This is unusual coal.\nQUESTION: I see. Okay. I --\nMR. FRYE: This is 12,500 btu coal.\nQUESTION: I stand corrected.\nSo it was the -- the approval was wrong simply\nbecause the -- the particular value of this coal meant\nthat it was being conveyed away for -- for half what it\nwas worth.\nMR. FRYE: Yes.\nQUESTION: That's the substance.\nAnd then you're also making the argument that it\nwas wrong -- and I think I used the word, the -- the\nbargaining process was skewed, but you're -- you're making\nthat argument too?\nMR. FRYE: Yes. The Secretary should have known\nthat the end result was going to be unfair because he had\nskewed the bargaining.\nQUESTION: Okay. May -- may I ask you this\nquestion as to whether he really did skew it? As I\nunderstand what the skewing might be, it would be simply\nthe refusal of the Secretary to allow the administrative\nprocess to go forward, as a result of which the tribe\nended up negotiating when it might not otherwise have\nnegotiated. It might have held out.\nMy question is this. Didn't someone -- and I\nforget who it was now -- on behalf of the Secretary come\nright out and say to the tribe, the Secretary or the\nDepartment or the Bureau thinks it would be better if you\nresolved this by negotiating? And isn't it fair to say\nthat that is practically saying, look, we're not going to\ndecide this thing? You go out and decide it by\nnegotiating. And if that is true, didn't they, in effect,\ntell them in substance what they were doing?\nMR. FRYE: Well, the beneficiary of a trust\nshouldn't have to guess what his trustee is really telling\nhim. If that's what the trustee wanted to say, the\ntrustee should have said, I've met with Peabody. I like\ntheir lobbyist. I'm not going to do something that\nPeabody doesn't like, and -- and we're going to sit on\nthis thing, as his subordinate said, until hell freezes\nover until you agree that -- with something that Peabody\nlikes and you can live with. If we had been given that\ninformation, we would have taken a much different\napproach. I guarantee you.\nNow, I think Justice O'Connor made the point\nthat if all we have -- if -- if the trust duty only\napplies to specific statutory and regulatory violations,\nthen it's meaningless. The trust duty has to be something\ngreater than that. And this Court in the Varity\nCorporation case about 6 years ago said precisely that.\nThe trust duty has to be something greater than the sum of\nthese distinct parts.\nQUESTION: So -- so the mere designation of a\ntrustee in these cases is a waiver of sovereign immunity?\nMR. FRYE: I would say not, Your Honor. There\nhas to be this overlay of comprehensive Federal control\nand supervision.\nAnd I would note too in the Indian Tucker Act,\nit doesn't restrict Indian plaintiffs to the same rights\nand remedies. It gives people -- Indian tribes and Indian\npeople the same access to the court, and it uses a\ndifferent word. It uses the word laws in the -- in the\njurisdictional statute in the Indian Tucker Act. And we\nknow from Illinois versus City of Milwaukee and other\ncases that laws means Federal common law and the -- and if\nthere's anything that's grounded in the Federal common law\ntradition, it's the trust duty owed to Indian tribes. And\nthat's what we sue under, the Indian Tucker Act.\nOne month ago yesterday, President George Bush\nonce again issued a presidential proclamation, following\nthose of President Reagan and President Clinton, honoring\nthe Navajos and recognizing their special service to the\nUnited States in times of war. And as this Court\nindicated in the Shoshone case, the Navajo tribe was\nentitled to a fidelity at least as constant.\nWe respectfully urge affirmance.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Frye.\nMr. Kneedler, you have 4 minutes left.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. KNEEDLER: Thank you, Justice Stevens.\nFirst, with several factual points. The tribe\ndid know the substance of -- of what had happened with\nrespect to Secretary Hodel. As I pointed out earlier,\nMr. Nelson's deposition, which is excerpted in the joint\nappendix, makes clear that the tribe had learned, he said,\nfrom Washington that -- that it was requested there that\nthey go back to negotiations.\nAnd also I would call the Court's attention to\npage 2370 of the appendix, which are notes of the\nnegotiating session -- first negotiating session that\noccurred after that on August 30th, 1985. It's a note in\nwhich Chairman Zah of the Nation acknowledges that\nSecretary Hodel apparently wanted them to go back and try\nto reach an agreement. So it's clear that the parties\nentered into these negotiations with a full understanding\nof -- of what the Secretary's preferred course was.\nSecondly, I think it's -- it's completely not\ntrue that Secretary Hodel directed a subordinate to lie to\nthe Navajo Nation. The -- on page 117 of the joint\nappendix, there's a copy of the directive that -- or\nthe -- the memorandum that Secretary Hodel sent to the\nAssistant Secretary about this. And he makes four very\nsignificant points entirely reasonable under the\ncircumstances.\nHe -- he referred to the fact that affirming the\ndecision outright unilaterally might lead to prolonged\nlitigation, during which the -- Peabody might well put\nthe -- the royalties into escrow and the tribe wouldn't\nget them.\nIt would impair the future ongoing contractual\nrelationship between the parties. Peabody has a huge\npresence on the reservation, and it was obviously\nbeneficial for the parties to resolve this peaceably and\nnot just this isolated royalty increase under this one\nlease, but a whole host of issues that were -- that were\nfacing the two parties: taxation, payment for water,\nother -- other leases in which there was a significant\nincrease.\nAnd those other leases, by the way, did not have\nan adjustment clause. So the tribe here got the benefit\nnot only of an increase on this lease, but an increase on\na lease that did not have an adjustment clause.\nAnd Secretary Hodel then said it would be\npreferable to allow the parties to negotiate, and then\nimportantly at the end, he said, I haven't reached a final\ndecision on the merits of the appeal. I just think it\nwould be better if the parties went back and negotiated.\nAnd since, as Justice Scalia pointed out, this was a lease\nprovision that was -- protected both parties, what is\nreasonable for both parties, it was certainly an\nappropriate resolution of that for the Secretary to say --\nin the normal situation where you have a -- a\ndisagreement, or differing views under a lease, to send\nthe parties back and seek to have them negotiate.\nAlso, I would point out on page 125 of the joint\nappendix, there's a letter from Mr. Vollmann in which he\npoints out that the Secretary is aware of each party's\nconcerns about the settlement, again making it clear\nthat -- that the Department in Washington was aware of the\nstate of affairs out there.\nSo the only -- the only -- aside from all of\nthat, the claims about the negotiations that preceded the\n1987 lease amendments are essentially procedural or tort\nclaims, or claims about improper regulation of -- of a\nnegotiating process. They aren't the sort of money-\nmandating statutory or -- first of all, there's no\nclaim -- no -- no identification of a statutory or\nregulatory provision that -- that specifically regulates\nthis and was violated. But in any event, just like the\nDue Process Clause that this Court held in Testan is not\nmoney-mandating, the same is true here as well.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Kneedler.\n"
