PHILLIPS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nIn 1967, Congress enacted section 209(a) of the\nClean Air Act, which is reproduced in the petitioners'\nbrief at page 1.\nlocalities from adopting or attempting even to enforce,\nquote, any standard relating to the control of emissions\nfrom new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines.\nIn this case, a political subdivision of the\nState of California has adopted fleet rules that prohibit\nthe purchase by certain fleets of various classes of -- of\nvehicles that are otherwise certified for purchase in the\nState of California and, indeed, have essentially\nprecluded the purchase by those organizations of diesel-\nfueled vehicles in toto.\nQUESTION: Mr. Phillips, this is a facial\nchallenge?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes, Justice O'Connor, it is a\nfacial challenge.\nQUESTION: Claiming total preemption.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes, claiming total preemption.\nQUESTION: What if we were to think that at\nleast as applied to the district's own purchases of\nvehicles, that it could limit itself to what kinds of\nvehicles it wanted to purchase and therefore is valid at\nleast in part?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, the -- there are two\nanswers to that. One, the district doesn't need a statute\nin order to purchase its own vehicles. There is no basis\nfor adopting a standard that controls that particular\nsituation.\nQUESTION: Well, but let's suppose it wants to\nestablish a standard to apply now and in the future for\nitself and for any other jurisdiction, public\njurisdiction, within its area?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, if it goes beyond --\nQUESTION: If it's authorized to do that.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, if it goes beyond what it\nwants to purchase itself and imposes requirements on\nothers, then it seems to me that's a standard that falls\nwithin the ambit of the preemption.\nQUESTION: What if -- what if the State -- what\nif the State of California says that all of our officials,\nincluding the Governor, shall have a low emissions\nvehicle?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I think that -- that there is a\nserious question as to whether or not that would be\npreempted. I -- I don't think it's presented, obviously,\nby the particulars of this case. I mean, it still look --\nsounds like a --\nQUESTION: Well, but it seems -- it seems to me\nthat -- that it is from -- from the standpoint of -- of\ngovernmentally owned and operated vehicles.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think the answer to the\nquestion at the end of the day, Justice Kennedy, would be\nthat you would require a clearer statement from Congress\nthan what you have in section 209(a) to interfere with the\nkind of purchasing decisions that localities are -- are\nmaking in contrast to this.\nQUESTION: Right, but -- but it seems to me not\n-- not an answer to Justice O'Connor's concern to say that\nit goes beyond the particulars of this case because when\nyou make a facial challenge, you are going beyond the\nparticulars of this case.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I understand that, Justice\nScalia. Well, there are two answers to that, one that I\nwas trying to answer before which is I don't think that\nthis provision actually covers that particular situation\nbecause you don't need this provision in order to have\nauthority as a local jurisdiction to make purchases on\nyour own as to what you're going to buy. That's not, I\ndon't think, a standard within the meaning of the statute.\nBut second of all, I also don't think that the\n-- it must be unconstitutional in all respects as the\ncontrolling standard of law in this particular context\neither. It is clear that there is a significant component\nof this -- of these fleet rules that is preempted, and\nperhaps all of them are preempted. But we were dismissed\nout at the earliest stages of these proceedings without an\nopportunity to demonstrate the metes and bounds of the\nregulations as they would particularly apply at this -- at\n-- at this particular juncture.\nQUESTION: No, but we may --\nQUESTION: I'm still not sure -- sure where we\nare. It -- it seemed to me that the regulation talks\nabout some private vehicles, trash hauling and airport\nshuttles, but it also talks about exclusively\ngovernmentally owned vehicles. And it seemed to me that\nthe State can do whatever it has -- whatever standard it\nwants for its own vehicles.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, our -- our challenge is not\nintended, frankly, to interfere with the local\njurisdiction's ability to purchase their own vehicles on\ntheir own behalf.\nQUESTION: Local jurisdictions. I mean, you\nknow, what's that? Are you saying that it is a standard\nif the City of Los Angeles has a regulation through the\ncity council that applies to the purchasing of every\nlittle local area? Or suppose the State of California has\na general regulation respecting only governmental\npurchases. Are you saying right now that all those -- in\nother words, rules, regulations, standards, practices by\nthe State of California or some part thereof -- that does\nnothing more than control purchasing by governmental units\nof that State is fine? They can do that.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes. That's what we're saying.\nQUESTION: All right.\nMR. PHILLIPS: We don't -- we don't have any\nchallenge to that.\nQUESTION: In that case we're now down to the\npossibility that we're talking about some garbage trucks,\nI think, and some airport vehicles because I think all the\nrest of it did just involve the State.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, it's difficult to know\nprecisely what the metes and bounds of it is, but the\nportion of this that offends us and the portion that we\nthink does not require a clearer statement, which is that\nwhich goes directly to non-governmental entities. If --\nif you're talking about regulating the purchasing choices\nof pure governmental entities, then you expect Congress to\nspeak with a -- with a clearer voice.\nBut the purpose of these fleet rules is not\nsimply to restrict the purchases by governmental entities.\nIt is quite clear that the purpose of these fleet rules is\nto regulate the purchasing choices that are made with\nrespect to a much broader scope of purchasing entities,\nincluding private entities, and it is that portion of the\nregulation, frankly, that we are challenging and\nchallenging on its face.\nQUESTION:\nbeen adopted by the State of California rather than a\nregional district as its 246, in -- in lieu of the Federal\nplan, would that have been permissible?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Assuming, Justice Ginsburg, that\nyou -- that California took -- complied with all of the\nrequirements of section 246, and there are specific\nrequirements in order to get a -- in the -- in the State\naction plan that -- State implementation plan that need to\nbe satisfied. But to be sure, the Congress clearly\nenvisioned that for States with nonattainment problems,\nthat they would be able to use fleet restrictions as a\nmechanism for promoting their overall emissions quality.\nQUESTION: So your objection is to this on a\nregional basis. Statewide you say is permissible provided\nyou follow -- I guess you need EPA approval?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes, providing you comply with\nthe standards of section 246.\nQUESTION: But -- so -- but the substance of it\nwould be okay statewide. So -- so --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I don't know if the precise\nterms of this -- of these rules would qualify under\nsection 246 or not. Nobody has actually analyzed that\npoint, but the truth is it's clear that you could have\ncertain fleet rules implemented that are consistent with\nsection 246.\nBut realize, Justice Ginsburg, that what -- by\nsaying all our concern is is that every -- every one of\nthousands of jurisdictions can impose purchase and sale\nrequirements on vehicles --\nQUESTION: Well, it's not sale requirements.\nIt's a purchase requirement.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, under the respondents'\ntheory of this case which limits the term standards to\nproduction mandates imposed on manufacturers, then it\nseems to me that it clearly extends to all purchases and\nsales and whether it extends to fleets, it wouldn't --\nit's not limited to fleets at all. Under the respondents'\ntheory of this case, the field that has been preempted\nhere really is limited to the manufacturers. And to allow\nevery local jurisdiction to come in and bring forth\nadditional requirements is to make a hash out of a scheme\nthat was clearly designed to create a unitary market for\nthe manufacture, sale, purchase, and licensing of new\nmotor vehicles.\nQUESTION: Well, if -- if one local jurisdiction\naffects other governmental jurisdictions, but the latter\ndon't care, then it's just as if, as the hypothetical just\nposed, the State had the -- had -- had the rule.\nIs there sort of an ultra vires component to\nyour argument that this -- that this district here is\naffecting what other governmental entities can do and\nthat's the problem?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, this Court has long\nrecognized that you can't analyze a preemption case solely\non the basis of the single action by a single actor, that\nin fact you have to consider the possibility that all 50\nStates or, in this case, every local jurisdiction could\nfollow suit.\nAnd remember, it's not just follow suit with\nrespect to this kind of fleet rules under the respondents'\ntheory of this case, which is that all purchase and sale\nrestrictions --\nQUESTION: Well, I -- I had not understood your\nargument to be based on any conception that this\nparticular district would be treated differently than the\nState as a whole, but I -- I -- am I wrong in that?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, the State of California\nwould have certain prerogatives, obviously, under the\nentire scheme that are different, but even if California\nhad simply done what the district did here, which is to\njust announce a set of fleet rules, not made any effort to\ncomply with 246, not made any effort to comply with\nsection 209(b) --\nQUESTION: Well, what -- what does -- what does\n246 provide?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Section 246 provides that in\ncertain nonattainment States, one of the options they have\navailable in order to eliminate the overall -- or to -- to\nimprove the overall ambient air quality is to adopt\ncertain types of fleet rules. And the provision is very\nlengthy. It's very detailed about -- and you have to\ninclude that in your State implementation plan.\nWhat California did was it used the substitute\nroute and adopted its LEV rules saying that those would be\nequally effective.\nQUESTION: So it didn't comply in your view with\n246.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Oh, it clearly didn't comply. I\ndon't think there's any question that California has made\nno effort to satisfy the Clean Air Act with respect to\nthis. But this Court --\nQUESTION: Your -- your argument, as I\nunderstand it, going back to your answer to Justice\nGinsburg, is that although there is an avenue for the\nState, as it were, to get where -- where it might want to\ngo on a -- on a fleet policy under 246, the district\nsimply does not have that avenue open to it.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes, that's absolutely clear.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. PHILLIPS:\nthe way this entire scheme operates.\nQUESTION: But that gets me back to my question.\nIf we disagree with you, to the extent we think some\napplication of the district's fleet rules are not\npreempted, then how does that leave your challenge, which\nis a facial one?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I -- I think the answer is\nthat there are various components of the fleet rules, and\nI think unlike if you're -- if you're seeking pre-\nenforcement of a statute, where you'd have to find every\napplication of it, the question is are there subcomponents\nof these rules that are properly challengeable and\ntherefore properly enjoinable rather than being allowed to\ngo in. I don't -- I don't understand --\nQUESTION: That eliminates the doctrine\nentirely, I mean, the doctrine that facial challenge has\nto show the statute is -- is invalid in all its\napplications. You could always say, well, we're not\nchallenging all of its applications. We're -- we're just\nchallenging this particular set of applications. I mean,\nthat -- that --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, no, Justice Scalia, I think\nit's a little more complicated than that because what\nyou're really talking about is a -- is a host of rules.\nAnd if you look at the appendix to the respondents' brief\nwith all of the rules that are laid out there, there are\nliterally dozens of rules. And in order to challenge the,\nquote, fleet rules in the sense of recognizing that there\nare clearly areas of those rules that intrude into\npreempted Federal activities, it doesn't seem to me that\nyou have to challenge the entirety of the rules. You\nshould be entitled to pick those rules that you're going\nafter and a complaint and go forward. And that's --\nQUESTION: But --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- that's what we've done. I\nunderstand if you have a simple unitary statute that\nyou're challenging, the Salerno rule may suggest that the\nstatute has to be unconstitutional in all its respects,\nbut if you adopted a rule that if part A is good and part\nB is not good, you should be allowed to -- to challenge\npart B facially without worrying about part A.\nQUESTION: But I thought -- I thought this was\nthe case in -- in which part A applies both to the\ndistrict, as in Justice O'Connor's question, and to non-\ngovernmental entities so that it's not that A applies to\n-- to one kind of buyer and B to another. There's a --\nthere's a rule that applies to buyers. And Justice -- and\ncorrect me if I'm wrong. Justice O'Connor's question in\neffect says, if there is a substantial -- if there is an\napplication of that rule that in a substantial number of\ncases at least would not be preempted, then isn't that the\nend of the facial challenge?\nMR. PHILLIPS: And my answer to you is I don't\nthink that's the proper application of Salerno and I don't\n-- I mean, I recognize --\nQUESTION: I'm not applying Salerno. I'm -- I'm\napplying a substantial application rather than a one-\ninstance kind of rule. And -- and your answer to that\nwas, well, we don't have to challenge all rules. We could\nchallenge A but not B. And my response is the rule that\ncovers the governmental situation and the private\nsituation is the same rule, and if that rule has a\nsubstantial number of constitutional applications or -- or\nnon-preempted applications, doesn't that, in -- in effect,\ndefeat the facial challenge?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, except for the fact that if\n-- if we don't get past the ruling of the court below at\nthis stage, which is that none of this is preempted, that\n-- whether it's a facial challenge or a non-facial\nchallenge, we're going to have rules that are out there\nthat are being implemented at this stage and will be\nupheld as constitutional under the Ninth Circuit's ruling\nas the -- as the controlling rule of law, and we won't be\nin a position even to get at any portion of those rules\nthat are clearly unconstitutional because they --\nQUESTION: You can, can you not -- I'm just\ntrying to draw this back because it seems to me you're not\nchallenging the public part. So if you're not challenging\nthe public part, then -- I've looked at pages 7 and 8 of\nthe SG's brief where he's listed these rules.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nQUESTION: And I take it what you're challenging\nis rule 1194 insofar as it applies to private operators.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nQUESTION: Rule 1193, the same, and rule 1186.1,\nthe same, and nothing else.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I think that --\nQUESTION: In each of those rules, having looked\nat them, it does say at the beginning, these apply to\npublic and private. So I take it it's those two words,\nand private, written in the text of those rules that\nyou're challenging.\nMR. PHILLIPS: That -- that is our -- I mean,\nour primary concern. The -- the problem here is --\nQUESTION: Well, but that's what you're\nchallenging, nothing else.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. Well, I mean, the\nquestion is whether or not -- I mean, I'm not sure that is\nprecisely what we're challenging. It seems to me there is\na difference between a public entity deciding on its\nown --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- that it will make a certain\npurchasing decision as a purchasing decision. There is a\nfundamentally different proposition when another entity\ndemands that it must make a purchasing decision based on\nemissions control.\nQUESTION: What do you mean? Another public or\nprivate?\nMR. PHILLIPS: A public entity.\nQUESTION: Oh.\nMR. PHILLIPS: What I was saying is -- what --\nwhat I meant to answer your question earlier, Justice\nBreyer, was to say if you're asking me can public entities\nmake purchasing decisions free of the restrictions of the\nClean Air Act, I think the answer is yes because I don't\nthink Congress spoke to that.\nBut if what you're saying is can a -- can one\ngovernmental entity demand that another governmental\nentity make a decision for purely environmental reasons\nand not as a -- as a contracting matter, no. That seems\nto me is still a standard --\nQUESTION: Well, now just let's think --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- that controls emissions and is\nunconstitutional.\nQUESTION: -- of the complexity of State and\ncentral government in light of what you just said. You're\nsaying that the State of California board A couldn't say\nall the -- I mean, I don't know where to go with this. Do\nyou see -- do you see the problem?\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, but the -- the problem is\nmuch simpler than that, Justice Breyer, because there's a\nscheme in place where if you don't like the way the\nregulatory arrangements are worked out, you can take the\nissue to California and California can take it to the EPA.\nI mean, the whole purpose of this enterprise was\nto devise a unitary market and make it very simple. And\nthere's nothing in the -- in the suggestion that --\nQUESTION: -- the merits. My problem is to try\nto figure out what's being challenged.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, we're challenging the\neffort by the district to impose these kinds of\nrequirements, these standards which control emissions.\nQUESTION: On its --\nQUESTION: But if California --\nMR. PHILLIPS: On everyone.\nQUESTION: -- if California accepts that as a\nmatter of its domestic law, who are we to say otherwise?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, because that's what the\nClean Air Act is all about. California is free to do that\nif it complies with section 209(b) which says you can\nobtain a waiver. You can make these the Federal\nstandards. I mean, there's no question that these fleet\nrules could have been adopted by the State of California\nand be approved by the EPA and be operating completely\ntomorrow if they want to go through that process. That's\nthe specific process Congress had in mind, a process that\nthe district has abandoned. And all we're suggesting is\nthat's what they ought to do.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Mr. Phillips, I don't want to\nintrude into your time, but I -- I hope you have time to\ncomment on your adversary's argument that the word\nstandards just refers to numerical figures and so forth\nand that you -- you have a -- it means the same thing when\nthe government is -- Federal Government is implementing\nits own standards and it is in this provision. Do you --\ndo you have a response to that basic argument?\nMR. PHILLIPS: So there -- there are two answers\nto that. One, section 202 is not limited to production\nmandates, those kinds of numerical standards, even -- even\nwithin 202. And second, the language that -- that\nCongress used about standards relating to the control of\nemissions is inherently broader than 202 in any event, and\nif you expected 209 and 202 to be read in para materia,\nyou would have expected Congress to cross reference.\nQUESTION: Because they were enacted at\ndifferent times, I think, the two sections.\nMR. PHILLIPS: They were enacted at different\ntimes.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nQUESTION: What about the distinction between\nstandard and requirement?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, the use of requirement in\nthe second sentence is simply a recognition that there\ncould be standardless requirements imposed by States\nrequiring a certification or some other kind of\ndocumentation that don't have standards. So the first\nsentence deals with standards and the second one deals\nwith standardless obstacles to implementation.\nIf I could reserve the balance of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Phillips.\nGeneral Olson, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMR. OLSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nThe South Coast rules prohibit the purchase of\ncertain motor vehicles and require the purchase of others\nbased on explicit emission standards.\nreasoning, every other State and local government agency\nin the United States could adopt its own individual and\nunique blend of prohibited and permitted motor vehicles.\nBut --\nQUESTION: General Olson, does -- does the\nGovernment take the position that petitioner has just\ntaken, that these rules are invalid even insofar as they\napply to governmental subdivisions in California?\nMR. OLSON: I think the answer is -- is no, but\nlet me explain, that to the extent that agencies of\ngovernment, the State or subdivisions, are purchasing\ntheir own vehicles, we do not contend that that is\nunconstitutional. They can purchase --\nQUESTION: No, no. I'm not talking about\nwhether their doing of it is unconstitutional. Whether\nthe State's -- whether the State's prescribing that they\ndo it violates the statute.\nMR. OLSON: Our -- our position -- I don't --\nI'm not sure I know the answer to that because I don't\nknow what authority this agency has with respect to\nrequiring different units of -- of the government of the\nState of California to purchase or not purchase vehicles.\nAnd it hasn't -- it's not a subject that was briefed, if\nat all, extensively in the briefs.\nBut the -- the force -- the force of the\npreemption provision here is that Congress determined that\nthere should be a uniform standard with respect to\ncontrols on the emissions of motor vehicles. California\nwas given an exception provided that certain requirements\nwere met. This is in section 209(b) that these provisions\nbe submitted to the EPA and approved under a process\nthat's open and transparent and allows the national agency\nto make sure that there are uniform standards that can be\nmet that also comply with the requirement that the\nnational economy not be disrupted, so that there would be\ndifferent -- by different standards in every little\ncommunity of the United States. That's the thrust --\nQUESTION: Has it happened, General Olson? One\npier that you raise is if -- that -- if this district can\nhave these fleet rules, so can every district in the\ncountry, and these -- these rules have been in operation\nnow for some years. Have other districts in other States\ncopied what this one has done?\nMR. OLSON: Not that I know of. They've --\nthey've only been in existence since the year 2000. The\n-- the district was given the authority to adopt these\nrules in 1987, if I'm correct, did not adopt them until\nthe year 2000.\nThe arguments -- the principal arguments that\nare made by respondents that standards are production\nmandates finds no basis in the statute. The language of\nsection 202 or section 209 is not so limited. The -- what\n-- what section 202 and 209 do, talk about emission levels\nor emission standards.\nAnd there should be no mistake about it. These\nfleet rules are directly related to emission standards.\nOne of them, for example, rule 1194, uses the phrase,\nemission standards, 12 times and it requires all\npurchasers to be vehicles that meet certain emission\nstandards, adopting by reference the State of California\nCARB rules. It picked out a subset, as the respondents\nput it, of one in column A, two in column B, no diesel.\nThere must be some clean fuel. It's another -- it's a\ntotally different package.\nAnd Palm Beach County or -- or Waco -- the City\nof Waco could do something exactly like what the\nrespondents are contending because they say the controls\nwith respect to emissions don't apply if they're\npurchasing requirements.\nEPA, in fact, enforces the standards that it\nadopts under section 202 pursuant to the provisions of 203\nby restricting the sale or introduction into commerce of\nmotor vehicles and under section 219, under certain\ncircumstances, the purchasers of fleets, bus fleets. So\nthe implementation of the limitations that -- that -- the\nstandards that EPA adopts are through purchase\nrestrictions or purchasing restrictions. They're not\nproduction mandates. It's my understanding and I'm\ninformed that the EPA has never implemented the Clean Air\nAct with respect to production mandates. They say what\ncan be sold or what can be purchased.\nQUESTION: But -- but, Mr. Olson, why can't a\nlocal agency or community decide it's going to buy\nvehicles and will buy no diesel vehicles? And why is that\nthe imposition of a standard?\nMR. OLSON: Well, it is not -- we -- we are not\ncontending, Justice O'Connor -- I want to make it very\nclear that local agencies, San Francisco or Los Angeles,\ncan put for their own vehicles anything they want. This\ndistrict -- I -- the -- the --\nQUESTION: Well, does this district have the\nauthority to so provide for its own purchases?\nMR. OLSON: For its own purchases. If it -- I\ndon't know whether it does or not. This is a quality\ncontrol district. I don't know how many vehicles they\nhave.\nQUESTION: Does it have authority to -- to make\nthat requirement for cities within its jurisdiction?\nMR. OLSON: We don't think that it has the\nauthority to require other governmental agencies based\nupon emission standards to do something.\nQUESTION: Well, that's a matter of State law.\nMR. OLSON: That is a matter of State law, and\nit's -- and -- and what we're talking about here is the\nrequirement by particular agencies to pick out different\ntypes of motor vehicles that may or may not be sold.\nQUESTION: Well, I suppose the separate States\ncould do that for its own purchases.\nMR. OLSON: For their own -- for their own\npurchases, Justice Kennedy.\nQUESTION: All right.\nQUESTION: -- they can't --\nQUESTION: And could they also do that for all\ntheir governmental subdivisions? The State of Nebraska\nsays that the State and all of its subdivisions will have\nsome very strict standards --\nMR. OLSON: I agree with the -- with the way\nthat the Chief Justice put it, that that's their own\npurchasing decisions, and it's a matter of State law as to\nwhether they can -- but that is not what this case is\nabout.\nThis case is about whether the South Coast\ndistrict can impose those standards, including Federal\nGovernment vehicles, postal vehicles, FBI vehicles,\nprivate vehicles that go to the airports and so forth.\nAnd the justification that they say is that we can control\nthe sale of motor vehicles willy-nilly by -- by\ncontrolling the purchase. By controlling the purchase,\nyou control what can be sold and thus can what be\nmanufactured. They are claiming an authority in southern\nCalifornia that they -- that they claim the EPA doesn't\neven have.\nQUESTION: Maybe, but most of what it covers is\nsimply the -- the purchase by governmental units. If you\nacknowledge that the State can require its subdivisions to\n-- to purchase only certain kinds of vehicles, as you've\njust acknowledged, why can't the State create a district\nas here and allow that district to require --\nMR. OLSON: Justice --\nQUESTION: -- subdivisions to purchase only --\nMR. OLSON: From the standpoint of the United\nStates Government, we're not contending that the State or\nan individual can choose whatever vehicle he or she or it\nwants to purchase. What we're contending is that the\nwhole scheme of the EPA and the Clean Air Act and the --\nand the preemption provisions prevent different agencies\nby using the -- the mechanism.\nThe entire argument that respondents advanced\nhere, by using the word -- by -- by prescribing what can\nbe purchased, they can -- they can control what vehicles\nwill exist and what vehicles will be run. It isn't\nlimited. The authority that they're claiming isn't\nlimited to their own vehicles. This same authority --\nthey would make the same arguments if the South Coast\nDistrict said all persons or all persons that have more\nthan one vehicle or all persons that live in a certain\nportion of southern California. The authority that they\nclaim by using the word purchase, which is not in the\nstatute, is not in the preemption provision, and is an\nauthority that the -- the EPA specifically uses to a\ncertain extent under section 219 --\nQUESTION: General Olson, you mentioned that\nthere are Federal vehicles involved, postal vehicles, but\nyou also are stressing purchase. Suppose the Federal\nGovernment buys its vehicles that it's going to operate in\nCalifornia in Nevada. These rules wouldn't apply. So the\n-- the United States is not inhibited in any way in its\npurchases, is it?\nMR. OLSON: Well, A, I think that is an\ninhibition. B, I think the respondents will say that\nthese -- these purchasing requirements are imposed upon\nfleet owners that -- that requires them to make purchases\nof certain vehicles. So I think the premise of your\nquestion is not correct.\nIf southern California or if the State of\nCalifornia wishes to impose fleet requirements, there is a\nmechanism. It's a logical, consistent, transparent, open\nmechanism under -- that was thoughtfully put out by\nCongress. The whole mechanism is thoughtfully calibrated\nby Congress to allow the EPA to make judgments. Does this\nmake sense from a national standpoint? Will this make\nsense from other States' standpoints? Is it -- will it\nimpose a dislocation on the marketplace for motor\nvehicles?\nThe twin objectives of the Clean Air Act are,\none, to produce cleaner air, but two, to do it in a way\nthat does not disrupt the national economy and the\nmarketing of motor vehicles, which is an important part of\nthe economy of this Nation.\nQUESTION: Just so I have it clear, because it\n-- this is very important to me. It's your position that\nthe State may require municipalities only to buy certain\nkinds of cars.\nMR. OLSON: To the extent that -- yes. I'm --\nbecause I don't know the answer to the State law question\nthat the Chief Justice alluded to. Assuming that the\nState of California was one and the same and decided that\nit owned or had the authority under State law to purchase\nthose vehicles, the answer would be yes.\nQUESTION:\nMr. Waxman, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. WAXMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe question in this case is whether section\n209(a) of the Clean Air Act, which is reproduced at page\n36a of our brief, preempts very modest fleet purchase\nrules which apply only to vehicles that are already\ncommercially available, that is, that cannot have an\neffect on manufacture -- cannot require manufacturers to\nproduce or sell anything, and which were adopted by a\nunique airshed in which 90 percent of all toxic air\npollution derives from motor vehicles.\nAnd the answer to that question is no because\nthe text and the context of the Clean Air Act, title II of\nthe Clean Air Act that deals with motor vehicles, show\nthat Congress intended the word standard in section 209 to\nbe used in the same way that it is used in section 202\nand, indeed, throughout the entirety of title II -- title\nII. It's used 100 times, I'm told by an amicus, in\nsection 202 alone, and every single time that it is used\nthere, it is used to refer to an obligation placed on\nmanufacturers, that the vehicles they produce and sell\nmeet specified emissions characteristics. No one contends\nthat that definition, the way the word is used in section\n202, covers the rules in this case.\nNow, express preemption -- it requires\ndiscerning Congress' intent. It's not an exercise in\ndefinitional possibilities, this Court has reminded us\nmany times. Now, you can read every brief from our\nopponents. Every different brief offers up some other\ndefinition, and their briefs in related cases have done\nthe same. And we've heard no definition this morning.\nThey look to the dictionary definition of standard or\ncriteria or test, and they're reproduced in their briefs.\nBut they -- they concede that there is no dictionary\ndefinition that they offer that coincides with the rule\nthat they seek because they concede that Congress did not\nintend to cover incentive programs or tax programs even\nthough, like purchase rules, they operate through the\nmarket on manufacturers and not directly on manufacturers.\nQUESTION: Suppose that California passes a law\nand says no one can sell a diesel bus in California.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well --\nQUESTION: Clearly you'd have to go get\npermission if you want a rule like that. Right?\nMR. WAXMAN: A -- a rule that --\nQUESTION: The rule is exactly what I said: no\none can sell a diesel bus in California.\nMR. WAXMAN: A -- one could -- I believe that a\ngood argument could be made that that rule is preempted\nbecause it conflicts with the overall purposes of the\nClean Air Act. But --\nQUESTION: Yes. I mean, you'd have to go to\nEPA.\nMR. WAXMAN: But, Justice Breyer, please let me\nfinish.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. WAXMAN: This is a very important point.\nThe challenge here is that these rules are expressly\npreempted -- it's in the question presented in the\npetitioners' brief -- expressly preempted by the first\nsentence of section 209(a), and it is expressly preempted\nbecause these are standards. And our submission is --\nQUESTION: I'm -- for purposes of my question,\nI'm rejecting that argument. I'm trying to figure out\nwhat is the correct way of dealing with the statute.\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes, and --\nQUESTION: And where I was going, if you want to\nsee, I'll show you because then you -- it -- it seems to\nme clearly you'd have to ask question -- nobody can sell a\ndiesel bus in California. You have to get permission from\nEPA.\nSecond, they change it.\nbus. All right? It's the same.\nThird, they say no governmental unit can buy a\ndiesel bus, but it turns out that the only buses anyone\nhas ever bought or sold in California are diesel units.\nAnd it's at that third point that's bothering me because\nit seems to me whether it's preempted or not turns upon\nthe effects. Have you, in effect, required the\nmanufacturer to change its assembly line or not? And I\ndon't know where to go with that. That's what I'm posing.\nMR. WAXMAN: Here is my -- here is my first\neffort at an answer. The word standard, as it is used in\n202 and in the other provisions of title II that deal with\ndifferent types of standards, the standards with respect\nto fuel, standards with respect to buses, standards --\nstandards in section 243 that deal with the Federal clean\nfuel purchase program, are all obligations that are placed\ndirectly on manufacturers. The Congress and the EPA\nrecognized when section 246 was enacted, which is the\nFederal fleet purchase program --\nQUESTION: Mr. Waxman, can I interrupt you just\na moment? You say there are obligations that are placed\non the -- which is also true. But the word standard as\nused in the statute over and over again refers to things\nthat are express in terms of so many units per mile and so\nmany -- so forth and so on.\nto me, refers to the -- the numerical definitions rather\nthan to how they're enforced or implied.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well --\nQUESTION: I think it may well be they're -- and\n-- and we don't have to worry about the enforced or\nimplied in the terms that a statute because all it has to\nbe that -- the only prohibition is against anything\nrelating to a standard.\nMR. WAXMAN: No, it's --\nQUESTION: And if the standard is limited to the\nnumerical term -- I don't find in the text of the -- of\nany part of the statute here your -- your point about\nenforcement against. That's -- that's what -- what is\ndone with the standard. It's not what the standard itself\nis.\nMR. WAXMAN: Justice --\nQUESTION: I have the same problem, if I could\nsecond it. It seems to me the fact that you use standard\n99 times in discussing manufacturing standards doesn't\nmean that when you use it a 100th time to refer to some\nother aspect of the whole thing, it must refer to\nmanufacturing. It just doesn't follow.\nMR. WAXMAN: I'll try -- I'll be efficient and\ntry and answer two questions at once then.\nFirst of all, 209 doesn't refer -- doesn't\nprohibit anything relating to a standard. It prohibits\nstandards relating to motor vehicle emissions just as\nsection 202 in the very first sentence authorizes the\nFederal Government to promulgate standards applicable to\nthe emission of motor vehicles.\nNow, standards, as the word is used in 202 and\nthroughout title II, refers to emission characteristics or\nthe obligation of manufacturers to sell and produce cars.\nIf you look at section 202(g) or 202(h) and 202(i), for\nexample, those are instances of subsections where it is\nused not just to refer to the emissions characteristics\nthemselves, but also the obligation on manufacturers and\nsellers.\nAnd in fact, if you look at section 203 of the\nact, which is called Prohibited Acts -- it's the\nenforcement provisions -- it is directed at manufacturers\nand sellers.\nQUESTION: I agree with you completely that the\nstatute imposes these obligations on the manufacturers to\ncomply with the standards. But the word standard is -- is\na different concept from the obligation to comply with the\nstandard.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, I think the -- the word\nstandard -- I'll -- I'll say this one more time and then\nretreat to another -- another argument. The word\nstandard, as it is used, for example, in 202(g), is used\nboth to refer to the emissions characteristics, numerical\nor otherwise, and an obligation placed on manufacturers\nand sellers to do something about that.\nAnd the -- let me -- let me give you my second\nline of argument here --\nQUESTION: Excuse me. Now you say it's not just\nmanufacturers. It's manufacturers and sellers. I thought\nit was just manufacturers.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, there are provisions in\nsection 203, which is the Prohibited Acts, that it -- it\nis imposed on the people who make cars and requires them\nor limits them in what those people can make.\nQUESTION: I mean, it -- it's hard enough to say\nthat the word standards on its own is automatically\nlimited to manufacturers, but it's doubly hard to say it\nis limited not to just to manufacturers, but to\nmanufacturers and sellers, but not to manufacturers,\nsellers, and purchasers.\nMR. WAXMAN: It -- it is -- Justice Scalia,\nthere is a provision in section 203 of the act, the\nProhibited Acts, that deals with the instance in which a\nmanufacturer, for example, produces cars overseas and then\ntries to sell noncompliant cars through a distributor or\nsome other entity.\nBut when Congress considered in 1990 its own\nfleet purchase rules, we're talking here about very\nlimited fleet purchase rules that -- talking about my\nrules -- have a commercial availability exception. They\ndo not -- they cannot be read to require manufacturers to\nmake anything they don't make or sellers to sell anything\nthey don't sell.\nQUESTION: Yes, but as soon as there's -- as\nsoon as there's one commercial vehicle available, that's\ngoing to have effect on the manufacturing.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well, there may be -- the -- the\nvehicle has to be -- the rules make quite clear that the\nvehicles have to be available and able to be used by that\nuser in the locality, the fuel --\nQUESTION: And you -- and you have to get --\napply for an exemption which the petitioner says is very\ndifficult to get.\nMR. WAXMAN: There -- the petitioner does not\nsay it's very difficult to get, and that footnote 7 on\npage 8 of their brief is truly the 13th chime of the clock\nin their argument. The -- if we had to establish a\nfactual record in this case -- and there is none -- I am\ntold by my client that these exemptions are sought for\nsome of these rules never because the vehicles are -- are\nreadily available, for example, with respect to street\nsweepers, and on other vehicles, they are readily given.\nIf somebody --\nQUESTION: What's -- what's that 13th chime? I\nlost you. I thought you said --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. WAXMAN: The 13th chime of the clock is --\nQUESTION: Yes, I know. I know what it is.\nWhere is it? At page --\nMR. WAXMAN: It's on page 8, footnote 7 of their\nreply brief.\nQUESTION: The reply, all right.\nMR. WAXMAN: They say that, oh, well, about\ncommercial availability, it's just not true. The district\nthat promulgated these rules said it only applies when\nit's commercially available. The State that enacted a\nprovision that authorized these rules has filed a brief in\nthis case saying it applies only when it's commercially\navailable. No one in this case or any other case has ever\nargued that that commercial availability exemption doesn't\nexist until footnote 7 of their reply brief, and it is\nsimply wrong.\nBut my point generally about the -- the meaning\nof the word standard in the Federal act, title II, is in\n1990 Congress enacted its own fleet purchasing rules, and\nthey are codified in --\nQUESTION: When you say its own, you mean fleets\nthat were going to serve Congress?\nMR. WAXMAN: No, no. Congress put into --\namended the Clean Air Act to require certain States that\nhave nonattainment areas to include within their State\nimplementation plans either a fleet -- a set of fleet\npurchase rules or some alternative that they would propose\nthat would be equally efficacious in cleaning the air.\nQUESTION: Just to be clear on your position, do\nyou think that California as a State could enact a law\nsaying that no purchaser of a motor vehicle in California\ncan purchase a gasoline-powered vehicle?\nMR. WAXMAN: I --\nQUESTION: Is that -- is that preempted or not?\nMR. WAXMAN: It is not expressly preempted by\nsection 209(a). It would be subject to conflict\npreemption principles, as this Court went through in Geier\nv. American Honda, if it could be shown that --\nQUESTION: Well, by any theory. Is that\npreempted or not in your view?\nMR. WAXMAN: I think -- I think it may well be\npreempted by -- under conflict preemption principles, not\nexpress preemption, if it could be shown that this is\nreally a sales or production -- this is really an\nobligation that is masquerading as a purchase requirement.\nThat would be the analysis --\nQUESTION: Nobody can buy a gasoline-powered\nvehicle in California would require the manufacturers\ntotally to dramatically change the kinds of vehicles they\nproduce.\nMR. WAXMAN: To be sure --\nQUESTION: So why wouldn't it fall right within\nthe word standard relating to the control of emissions for\nmotor vehicles?\nMR. WAXMAN: Because standards, as I said --\nQUESTION: That isn't a standard? What it says\nis --\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes.\nQUESTION: It's not a standard?\nMR. WAXMAN: That is correct.\nQUESTION: Because?\nMR. WAXMAN: A standard is -- is a requirement\nthat is imposed on manufacturers and that distinction is\ndrawn throughout title II --\nQUESTION: Well, it is a -- what -- what do you\ndo with 209(b) which says -- it -- it authorizes EPA to\nwaive application of 209(a) in the case of, quote, any\nState which has adopted standards, other than crank case\nemission standards, for the control of emissions from new\nmotor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines?\nNow, most of the States do not have automobile\nmanufacturers located within the States. How could they\npossibly impose a requirement on automobile manufacturers?\nIt is obviously referring to State standards that deal\nwith the operators of -- of cars -- you have to go in and\n-- and have your -- your emissions checked -- or the -- or\nthe purchases of cars.\nMR. WAXMAN: Justice Scalia, it's -- I actually\nthink that 209(b) is important proof for our premise that\nsection 209(a), the word standard, has to be read -- it\nhas to be read to be used in the same way as section 202.\nAnd clearly the way that -- when I -- when we\ntalk about production mandates, I -- it's -- it's actually\nthe Congress in section 249(h) used the word production or\nsales mandates. The EPA in its rules and in its letter\nthat was submitted under a primary jurisdiction referral\nto the First Circuit talks about production requirements.\nIt's shorthand.\nBut I readily agree that when 209(b) or 209(a)\nor 202 apply -- when I'm talking about production\nmandates, I'm talking about an obligation that's placed on\nthe manufacturers about what they produce and can sell.\nIt's one and the same. There was a presumption that they\nwould try and sell what they produced and they would\nproduce the things that they want to sell.\nThe point is that in -- when Congress enacted\nthe Federal fleet purchase program, it drew a -- the same\ndistinction that is shot through title II between\nstandards, which has a very limited meaning, and\nrequirements. It's a distinction that exists in section\n116 of the act, which is on page 3a of our appendix, that\npreserves State authorities. And what Congress said and\nwhat the EPA said and what Senator Levin, who was very\nably representing the interests of Detroit in 1990, said\nis these fleet purchase rules, because they are directed\nat purchasers may very well have a tremendous impact on\nmanufacturers. They may cause a race to the top. But\nthey are different than production standards, production\nmandates, or requirements placed directly on\nmanufacturers.\nQUESTION: I -- I don't understand your response\nto my question. My question is -- you just said again,\nthat standards always refer to manufacturing standards.\nBut in 209(b), they clearly do not refer to manufacturing\nstandards. Any State which has adopted standards for the\ncontrol of emissions from new motor vehicles or new motor\nvehicle engines. Those standards are -- are just not\napplied to the manufacturer. Most States don't have\nmanufacturers that they can control.\nMR. WAXMAN: Justice --\nQUESTION: Those standards are imposed at the\npurchase -- or at the operations stage.\nMR. WAXMAN: They are imposed on the people who\nmake the cars when they sell them. That's because,\nJustice Scalia--\nQUESTION: Why don't you just say they are\nimposed upon the sellers? And that's the way they get\nimposed upon the manufacturers.\nMR. WAXMAN: I -- I wish that I could have said\nit that concisely, but that's the point that I'm making.\nQUESTION: They're not imposed upon the users?\nMR. WAXMAN: They are --\nQUESTION: Virginia cannot impose them upon the\nusers of cars in Virginia?\nMR. WAXMAN: My submission to the Court, Your\nHonor, is that standards, as the term is used throughout\ntitle II, refers to the supply side of motor vehicles, the\npeople who make them and the people who sell them, and\nthat when Congress wanted to make a rule that dealt with\npurchasers, which applies only indirectly against\nmanufacturers, it used the word requirement. And that's\nbecause --\nQUESTION: So that this provision in 209(b) does\nnot authorize a State to conduct emissions tests of old\nvehicles that have already been sold.\ndo with manufacturers, nothing to do with sellers at this\npoint. It has to do with whether the user is keeping the\nemissions system in -- in proper operation. You say that\nis not covered by 209(b) because 209(b) does -- does not\nsay requirements. It says standards.\nQUESTION: No. It's not --\nMR. WAXMAN: Both 209(a) --\nQUESTION: -- covered by 209(b) because 209(b)\nis a limitation on (a) and (a) only talks about new\nvehicles. So you could get around this whole thing if\nCalifornia adopted a rule that said any vehicle 6 years --\n6 months old has to meet certain standards. The whole\nstatute wouldn't apply.\nMR. WAXMAN: Look, section -- subsection (d) of\n209 applies to vehicles that are not new. 209(a) and\n209(b) apply to new vehicles. What -- 209(b) is the\npresumptive waiver for California alone of the preemption\nprovision in 209(a).\nI -- I don't want to be pedantic, but let's --\nwe -- we started talking about 1965 and 1967, and I think\nit's tremendously revealing, in terms of the purposes,\nwhat Congress intended by standard in 209, to understand\nthat in 1963 Congress enacted the first version of the\nClean Air Act. And it basically didn't authorize the\nFederal Government to do anything other than help States\ndo their part in cleaning up the air.\nThat didn't work very well, and in 1965 Congress\nenacted the provision that is now 202 that says we are\ngoing to take from the realm of a traditional State\nauthority this much for the Federal Government. They can\nand will set standards applicable to motor vehicle\nemissions.\nNow, for the intervening 2 years, the\nmanufacturers came to Congress and said this doesn't make\nthings better, it makes things worse because there are a\nnumber of States that are promulgating their own mandates\non how we build engines and what kind of equipment we\nhave.\nAnd in footnote 7 of our brief, we cite a report\nby HEW that categorizes what each State was doing. It's a\n1976 report. And what they were doing was not putting\nrequirements on purchasers. They were saying to\nmanufacturers, if you want to sell a car in our State,\nit's got to have a whiz-bang or a doodad, or it has to\nmeet the following characteristics. And the manufacturers\nsaid, we can only engineer and manufacture to one\nstandard.\nSo in 1967, Congress responded to that by\nenacting what is now section 209, and it compromised. It\nsaid, well, we're not going to make you manufacture and\nengineer only to one standard. We're going to make an\nexception for California, which was there before the\nFederal Government was there.\nBut other than California, which is subsection\n(b), no State can do what it is that the EPA is doing in\nsection 202. And there are a number of rules of statutory\ninterpretation, leaving aside the presumption against\npreemption in this area of historic police -- State police\npower, that require you to read for an express preemption\npoint, not a general, broad conflict preemption argument\nthat is not advanced here, that the word standard is to be\nread as narrowly as reasonable to preserve as much for the\nStates as possible.\nQUESTION: Is --\nMR. WAXMAN: And it has to be -- it's only\ncoherent if it means that the States are precluded from\ndoing what EPA was mandated to do, which is to tell\nmanufacturers, if you've got a vehicle over 6,000 pounds,\nit can't emit more than X, Y, and Z grams per mile.\nWhat the manufacturers cared about was that they\nnot have to make what is -- was subsequently called a\nthird car. They didn't want to have to build different\ncars and engines for different parts of the country. And\nthat's why a rule that is directed only at purchasers and\nhas built within it an exception for anything that is not\ncommercially available or can't be used for the purpose\nthat the user wants to use it for is not a standard.\nQUESTION: All right. Maybe that's --\nMR. WAXMAN: It's a difficult question that --\nQUESTION: -- Justice Breyer.\nMR. WAXMAN: I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: I want you to finish what you're\ndoing, but I want at some point to get back to this\neffectiveness -- the effect thing. I don't want to cut\nyou off.\nMR. WAXMAN: Well --\nQUESTION: Maybe I'll -- do it in the order you\nwant.\nMR. WAXMAN: I'm here to answer questions, and I\napologize.\nQUESTION: Do it in the order you want and you\ncan just that I've just been off base, and I'll put out\nthe three propositions that -- that I'm thinking. Now,\nyou'll see it in a second.\nI'm thinking, one, this case isn't a big deal\nbecause all California has to do is go ask EPA and EPA is\nalmost bound to approve whatever they want.\nTwo, that you can't do it on language, that you\nhave to figure out the purpose. The purpose is to stop\nthe manufacturers from having to make different cars, and\ntherefore, why don't you, in these circumstances, look to\nthe effect? And -- and if in fact the effect is that\nthey're going to have to make some different cars, it's no\ngood.\nBut all the examples you give in your brief, all\nthose things are fine. They don't -- they don't involve\nthis and -- and they're not commands. You have to go the\ncommand and have an effect. This is a command. And I\ndon't think it does have an effect, nor do you, but they\nthink it might.\nMR. WAXMAN: I think it's --\nQUESTION: Well, so try it out. That -- that's\n-- that's the kind of thing that's going through my mind.\nMR. WAXMAN: I --\nQUESTION: And now you've sort of said, no, no,\nyou're way off base, and I want to know why I'm way off\nbase.\nMR. WAXMAN: Justice Breyer, you are not way off\nbase.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. WAXMAN: You're slightly off base, but not\nway off.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: There, there, Justice Breyer.\nMR. WAXMAN:\nthree points, and I'll try and address them in turn.\nThey're -- the -- they're -- what they're saying\nis, look, there's no big deal because -- because this\nairshed, one of 33 in California, could take the concerns\nof its citizens -- even though it's mandated by the State\nto promulgate these rules, it could go to the bureaucracy\nin Sacramento and try and get that bureaucracy to include\nin its list of what it sends to the centralized command\nand control bureaucracy in Washington permission to enact\nrules that scientific studies show cause 9,000 premature\ndeaths in the district a year. Now, it's true, but it\nwould not avail, that is, particulate emissions from motor\n-- toxic emissions from motor vehicles and diesel\nvehicles.\nNow, what about Houston? Houston -- right now\nthe South Coast is the only extreme nonattainment zone in\nthe country, but Houston has been knocking at the door for\nseveral years. The -- the waiver provision that they're\nreferring to in 209(b) would not avail Houston. It\nwouldn't avail Phoenix which has its own unique airshed\nproblems with particulate emissions.\nAnd therefore, our submission is if it's a\nstandard, yes. If you say this is a standard, we will go\nto the State of California and say please sponsor this\nrule and please ask the EPA to give permission for us to\nbe able to impose these fleet purchasing rules.\nQUESTION: The district could not apply directly\nto EPA. It would have to go through Sacramento?\nMR. WAXMAN: I believe so. There is a provision\nin the California Health and Safety Code that says that\nthe California Air Resources Board is the relevant State\nagency for purposes of 209(b).\nBut more generally, if the -- the point here is\ndo you determine what Congress' purpose is by the effect.\nThat's fine.\nQUESTION: It's not determined what Congress'\npurpose is by the effect. You have things that you're\ntalking about, standards telling the -- the manufacturers\nwhat to do, and then you have close-to things, things not\nquite that, but close to that, selling, purchasing. So\nthere, where it's a command in this slightly different\nform, we look to see whether it really has the effect that\nthe statute is aimed at preventing. And if so, go to the\nEPA and ask them. If not, don't.\nMR. WAXMAN: No. If -- if it is a command to\nmanufacturers with respect to emissions characteristics of\nthe vehicles they make, it is a standard, as that term is\nused throughout title II. If it is directed at purchasers\nand, as Senator Levin and the EPA explained in 1990, only\naffect manufacturers and sellers through the marketplace,\neven though it may have a substantial effect, it is no\ndifferent than the many incentives and differential tax\nprograms that they say aren't covered.\nLook, California --\nQUESTION: Mr. Waxman, I think -- maybe I'm\nwrong, but I think the effect that Justice Breyer is\nthinking about is the effect of -- of being forced to\nmanufacture the third car.\nMR. WAXMAN: Yes, indeed.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. WAXMAN: And -- and these --\nQUESTION: And -- and I thought your answer to\nthat was because you don't have to buy anything that is\nnot commercially available, that nixes the third car\neffect argument, and therefore there isn't preemption.\nMR. WAXMAN: That is absolutely correct.\nQUESTION: No, but that's completely wrong in\nprinciple for the reason that the rules don't talk about\ncommercial availability but in averages.\nMR. WAXMAN: No.\nQUESTION: So, in fact, if they're only supposed\nto make three ZEV's -- see, they're only supposed to make\nthree ZEV's. ZEV is commercially available. But you\ncould have a rule say buy only ZEV's and that would be a\nmajor change in the EPA rule.\nMR. WAXMAN: With respect, Justice Breyer --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. WAXMAN: Here you are completely off base.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. WAXMAN: The rules each -- I'm not talking\nabout CARB's statewide standards, but the rules challenged\nhere have an exception for anytime somebody can show that\nthe vehicle they want is either not commercially available\nor can't be used.\nLook at page 50a of the joint appendix. The\nrules are all in the joint appendix. That happens to be\nthe rule that deals with the one that my book opened up\nto. It's buses. And it says on page 50 of the joint\nappendix that this -- an exception -- an exemption to\nthese fleet purchase rules where no alternative-fuel\nengine and chassis configuration is available commercially\nor could be used.\nAnd so this is the situation that -- our\nsubmission is that these things can't possibly have --\nimpose a mandate on manufacturers. And in fact, look --\nwe -- we discuss in our brief a little bit that California\nhas a program where it provides, I think, a 75 or 90\npercent rebate to school districts if they buy buses that\nare fueled by alternative-fuel vehicles. Now, is that\ngoing to have an effect on the kinds of buses that school\ndistricts buy? Of course. And is it going to have a big\neffect on manufacturers? Sure.\nAnd therefore, when we're talking about\nsomething that is mandatory, as opposed to something that\nis voluntary, they -- on page 7 of their reply brief, they\nmake a distinction between voluntary standards and\nmandatory standards. From the relevant perspective, that\nis the perspective of the manufacturer, they are the same,\nas Senator Levin and the EPA explained. They operate on\nthe manufacturers through the market.\nNow, to be sure, there -- you can come up and I\nthink Justice O'Connor came up with the extreme example of\nno one in our State can buy a diesel vehicle. And what\nI'm saying is that one could argue and one might make a\nvery good argument that if it is a mandate that's imposed\non manufacturers or sellers that is masquerading as a\npurchase rule, where it really has that effect, you may\nfind that substance will prevail over form, or you may\nfind -- I think it would be more appropriate -- that this\nsimply conflicts with the fundamental objective of the\nClean Air Act under the Hines v. Davidovitz test.\nBut that's not the challenge that was brought\nhere, and that's --\nQUESTION: It would be conflict preemption, not\nexpress preemption.\nMR. WAXMAN: Conflict preemption and not express\npreemption. And that will -- that analysis and that mode\nof analysis will allow the courts to deal with this parade\nof horribles that has never come true and may never come\ntrue if the political branches don't.\nBut if you look at the history of what was going\non in 1965 or 1967 -- this is Congress' purpose -- no one\nwas talking about -- no manufacturers were concerned about\npurchase rules. They were concerned about having to\nengineer and manufacture a third vehicle.\nQUESTION: But if you need -- if you need\nconflict preemption to answer such a basic hypothetical as\nthat put by Justice O'Connor, the statute doesn't mean\nvery much.\nMR. WAXMAN: Oh, I think -- no, no, no. With --\nwith respect, this -- this statute shut down cold, Justice\nKennedy, precisely what was going on in 1967.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Waxman.\nMR. WAXMAN: Thank you, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Mr. Phillips, you have 2 minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nLet me start with Justice O'Connor's\nhypothetical. We are told in language that I think a 6-\nyear-old would have a hard time understanding that a flat\nban on all gasoline-fueled engines in the State of\nCalifornia is not a standard relating to the control of\nemissions from new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle\nengines.\nJustice Kennedy is absolutely right. It has\nrendered the scope of preemption. There is no field of\npreemption. There is not even a divot of dirt of\npreemption that is created under that interpretation.\nIt's not consistent with the language of the word\nstandard. Standard means more than what manufacturers do.\nIt's not simply how it gets enforced. It's broader, and\nJustice Stevens is clearly correct in that regard.\nThe one provision that seems to have gotten lost\nin the -- in all of this, which I think is terribly\nimportant, is section 177 which states that State -- and\nthis is at the -- the respondents' brief's appendix at 4a\n-- 4a. The States are not authorized to prohibit or limit\ndirectly or indirectly the manufacture or sale of a new\nmotor vehicle or motor vehicle engine that is certified in\nCalifornia.\nThat is precisely what is being done here, is\nthat vehicles that are certified in California are\nprohibited by a subagency.\nwhich is why I submit the answer to your question, Justice\nScalia, is the State wouldn't have the authority to place\nthe kind of restriction on its own subentities without\nrunning afoul of section 177. And the only way California\ncould get approval for that would be to go to the EPA in\nthe way that Justice Breyer has already described.\nQUESTION: Mr. Carter, Mr. Waxman said in his\nbrief that the position he's taking is the position that\nEPA takes, and EPA is not with us this morning.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Oh, I believe EPA is very much\nwith us this morning because the Solicitor General speaks\nfor the United States, and EPA is clearly a part of the\nUnited States Government. And -- and the EPA has made it\nabsolutely clear, Justice Ginsburg --\nQUESTION: So you -- you say that's just wrong\nwhen --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Oh, absolutely that's just wrong.\nThere is no -- there is no way -- I have seen nothing to\njustify departing from what the Government's brief says.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nPhillips.\n"
