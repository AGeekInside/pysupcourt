        "content": "(11:05 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in Beard v. Banks.\nMr. Rovelli.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LOUIS J. ROVELLI\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. ROVELLI: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe policy challenged in this case applies to\na small class of dangerous, disruptive inmates, all\nconfined at level 2 of the Long Term Segregation Unit,\nwhich is the most restrictive custody in the\nPennsylvania prison system.\nThese central facts inform every aspect of\nthe Turner analysis which governs the outcome of this\ncase. The denial of periodicals and photographs, with\nthe opportunity to earn them back by improved behavior,\nis logically connected both to rehabilitation and\nsecurity. Level 2 inmates have a -- have failed every\nattempt at rehabilitation. Yet, nearly all of them\nwill be released from prison. The goal at level 2 is\nto turn these inmates around, to improve their behavior\nenough that they can be advanced safely to programs\nwith more opportunities for self-improvement. Until\nthat happens --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Rovelli, I -- I forget.\nHow big a class of -- of prisoners are we talking\nabout?\nMR. ROVELLI: Less than 40.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Less than 40? And does the\nrecord tell us how long they have been in level 2?\nMR. ROVELLI: Well, the duration of -- of\nconfinement at level 2 varies widely from one inmate to\nanother because it is affected by their improvement.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But is there any average or\nany -- is there -- does the record tell us how -- how\nlong most of them have been there?\nMR. ROVELLI: The record does not tell us how\nlong most of them have been there. At the time of the\ncase in the trial court, which was 2002, 25 percent of\nthem had been promoted to level 1 or had been released\nfrom the Long Term Segregation Unit altogether.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Does that mean that 75\npercent had not?\nMR. ROVELLI: At that time, yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And how long -- do we know\nwhat the average period of incarceration in level 2 is?\nIs it a matter of weeks, or is it a matter of years?\nMR. ROVELLI: Well, realistically it's in\nbetween. Again, the -- the unit had only been in\noperation for 2 years at the time that the record was made.\nSo there's very little --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'm trying to understand\nwhether typically they're there for a long period of\ntime on the one hand, or are they there sort of on\nprobation and are periodically reviewed and moved into\nanother system?\nMR. ROVELLI: They're -- they're moved when\ntheir behavior improves. The average over a long\nperiod of time has been in the range of a year or so.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I see.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Were there any prisoners,\nsince the inception to your program, that have been in\nthere for the whole 2 years?\nMR. ROVELLI: Through today? I'm sorry. Oh,\nfrom the time of its inception?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.\nMR. ROVELLI: Until the 2-year point. Yes,\nthere were. I don't know exactly how many there were,\nbut there definitely were.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Are -- do -- is -- is\nPennsylvania alone or nearly alone in imposing this\nrule, or is this typical of the restraints imposed in\n-- in this maximum restrictive confinement?\nMR. ROVELLI: There's a wide variation of\nprivilege grants and withdrawals even at the highest\nlevels of security. The ACLU's amicus brief points to\nthree other States that -- that have the same program\nas Pennsylvania, and frankly, I'm not even sure as to\nthose, that it's identical. But the Court has\nrecognized that -- that these sorts of variations,\nparticularly when we're talking about high security\nprisoners, are precisely what Turner contemplates.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is this one of the most\nsevere restrictions in the Nation with respect to\nreading material and photographs?\nMR. ROVELLI: I'm sure that it is.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What is the reason that --\nthat the State or the regulations allow paperbacks from\nthe library and not current events? I'm just -- that\n-- the rationality of -- of that line escapes me.\nMR. ROVELLI: Well, there's -- there is\ncertainly a security component to it. Paperback books,\nsmall, compact, much more difficult to use as weapons,\nand the experience of the prison staff that operate\nthis high security unit is that newspapers and\nmagazines are -- have been a -- a frequent source of\nmischief.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can we explain that? How\ndoes one use a newspaper as a weapon? I mean, you\nknow, maybe disciplining a dog or something.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. ROVELLI: Actually inmates, particularly\nthe worst of the worst, are quite clever at using\nnewspapers. A newspaper rolled tightly with toothpaste\nused as an adhesive can be compacted into very nearly\nthe equivalent of a nightstick.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But a paperback\nversion of War and Peace is less dangerous? It seems a\n--\nMR. ROVELLI: The experience of prison\nofficials is that, yes, it is, and -- and actually it's\nvery common in prison systems to distinguish, for\nexample, between hardback books and paperbacks. Yes,\nit's -- these are difficult lines to draw, and that's\nwhere the professional expertise of the people who deal\nwith the problems every day comes into play.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But if the concern is the\nsafety concern, then you would have an equal concern\nwith the Jewish Daily Forward, which is a newspaper\nformat, or -- and I don't know what the Watchtower\ncomes out in these days.\nMR. ROVELLI: Yes. Well, Justice Ginsburg,\nthe -- the experience of prison administrators is that\nprisoners are less likely to use religious and legal\nmaterials for mischief, and as to paperbacks as well,\nthey do supply an alternative means of receiving\ninformation from outside the prison. But again, if I\n-- if I allude frequently to the experience of prison\nadministrators, it's -- it's because that's what these\n-- this policy is guided by. Newspapers and magazines\nhave a high value to inmates.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's why I\nthought your answer would have focused on that rather\nthan the security concerns, is that you take away what\nit is they want the most because that's most likely to\nresult in them conforming their behavior so they can\nget it back.\nMR. ROVELLI: Yes, and that is -- is the\nprimary purpose of the policy overall, and --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So why -- let's see. They\ngo to the prison library what? Once every couple of\nweeks or what? Once a week?\nMR. ROVELLI: Actually --\nJUSTICE BREYER: One -- one visit per month.\nAnd -- and how often do they go to the prison library?\nMR. ROVELLI: Inmates at level 2 are not\npermitted to go to the prison library.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's ordered.\nMR. ROVELLI: They can order books from the\nlibrary. They are allowed to visit the -- the mini law\nlibrary that's proximate to the unit.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, what it says -- that's\nwhat -- it says, to review legal materials, one at a\ntime may be let out of his cell and is escorted to a\nmini law library in hand. All right.\nWhy couldn't you have a -- if he wants to see\nthe newspaper in that mini law library, why couldn't\nthere be a copy there, only the parts that are\nconsistent with the censorship policy, just like a news\nof the day.\nMR. ROVELLI: Having --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is there a security reason\nor is --\nMR. ROVELLI: There's definitely a security\nreason.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is there a security reason\nwhen he's there in leg irons looking at the books, the\nlaw books, in the mini law library?\nMR. ROVELLI: Allowing the -- the inmate to\nrequest to go to the mini law library for an additional\npurpose or for a separate purpose to read periodicals\nputs increased demand on going there, and moving these\ninmates is a -- a very demanding operation. It\nrequires two officers and physical restraints and going\nthrough layers of security. So it puts increased\ndemands on prison resources.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What does the -- what does\nthe inmate have to show in order to go to the law\nlibrary? That is, suppose the inmate's position is I\nwant to go there and I want to read Law Week and Legal\nTimes and other -- I want to see what's new, what's\nbreaking in the law so that maybe I'll have something I\ncan put in a petition, and that's why I want to go\nevery -- every chance I get to the law library. Could\nsuch an inmate go to the library?\nMR. ROVELLI: Yes. The inmate may go to the\nlaw library subject to the limitation of one inmate at\na time, subject to the sign-up list. The inmate may\nget --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that would mean that\nthe inmate could go and look at the legal newspapers,\nbut not -- not the Christian Science Monitor.\nMR. ROVELLI: The Christian Science Monitor\nis not available to him in the -- in the mini law\nlibrary, and -- and actually, if he wanted to\nsubscribe, he could receive a -- a legal periodical in\nhis cell.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So he could get Law Week,\nLegal Times, and --\nMR. ROVELLI: Subject --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the National Law\nJournal. All of those he could get.\nMR. ROVELLI: Subject to the content\nrestriction of religious and legal materials that would\nfit in one property box, he may.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Now, on -- on your theory of\n-- of behavior modification, would it, nonetheless, be\n-- be open to the State to say, no, you may not receive\nany more legal materials and you may not go to the\nlibrary to look at them? Because that's something you\nvery much want to do. And in order to do that, you've\ngot to shape up and -- and get moved down to a lesser\nlevel of security. Would that -- I'm not saying that\nthe State is -- is about to do that, but on your\ntheory, could the State do that?\nMR. ROVELLI: Yes. Yes, Justice Souter, the\nState could, as long as the overall Turner analysis is\nobserved. And, in particular, I think that would\nimplicate the availability -- the availability of\nalternative means of exercising the asserted right to\nreceive information from outside the prison.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, what would -- I mean,\nyou know, one of the arguments made on the other side\nis that if you accept the behavior modification theory\nas an adequate justification, the Turner categories\nessentially become incoherent.\nWhat, for example, would be the alternative\nmeans in this case if the State said, we realize that\nthe people in -- in -- at level 2 want to see legal\nmaterials very, very much because that is a source of\nhope for them, and we want them to have that source of\nhope only if they shape up and -- and get down to a\nreduced level of security, so we're going to stop it,\nperiod? What would be the alternatives within the --\nthe Turner analysis?\nMR. ROVELLI: The inmate would still have\nunlimited access to counsel visits and can still visit\nthe mini law library and do his own legal research,\neven if he's not allowed to subscribe to or -- or keep\nlegal materials, legal periodicals in his own cell.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What if the -- what if the\ninmate said, look, the -- the lawyers who come to see\nus are -- are great guys, but they're -- they're\noverworked. They don't have time to be thinking about\nnovel legal theories, which we would dream up perhaps\nif we could get to Legal Times and these periodicals?\nSo it's -- it's not an alternative.\nMR. ROVELLI: Ultimately any prisoner is --\nis free to challenge the adequacy of his ability to\naccess the courts in a -- in an as-applied challenge to\nhis own conditions.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So you're -- you're saying\nthere -- there's a separate value here, and that is the\nvalue of access to courts. And -- and that limits what\ncan be done for purposes of behavior modification.\nMR. ROVELLI: Definitely.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All right. What about the\nmarriage example? The -- the Court has said, yes, you\ncouldn't -- the -- the State can't prevent the inmate\nfrom -- from getting married. I don't see where the\nseparate source of -- of value is that would -- that --\nthat would affect that analysis. No right of access to\ncourt. The associational rights can be abridged and so\non.\nWhy, on your analysis, wouldn't -- wouldn't\nthe proper disposition of the earlier case have been to\nsay, yes, the State can preclude marriage too because\nthat's something they very much want and -- and the\nState can preclude that unless they shape up and -- and\nget down to a -- a lesser level of security?\nMR. ROVELLI: Well, the marriage ban, Justice\nSouter, of course, is subject to Turner analysis as\nwell, and I think that where Turner might bring up\nshort a ban on marriage for these high security inmates\nis in the -- the logical connection to the\nrehabilitative purpose in that there being so few\ninmates and marriage is going to be such an infrequent\noccasion, it's hard to see the marriage ban as\ninfluencing level 2 inmates generally to improve their\nbehavior.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So you're saying there just\nis not a logical connection there within --\nMR. ROVELLI: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- the meaning of the -- of\nthe case?\nMR. ROVELLI: That -- yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But there would be a logical\nconnection for those who want to get married.\nMR. ROVELLI: That -- that implicates --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You're -- you're saying it\nmight not make sense as a systemic policy --\nMR. ROVELLI: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- because it isn't a big\nenough problem. But for -- we're not talking about a\nwhole system here. We're talking about 40 people or\nless, and if some of those 40 people want to get\nmarried, why doesn't it make perfect sense to say no\nmarriage?\nMR. ROVELLI: Well, you could say that about\nall -- probably a range of things if you went so far as\nto query each inmate as to what it is that they value\nmost or what it is they're most interested in doing --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You can, and on -- on your\nanalysis, why isn't that sufficient?\nMR. ROVELLI: It would be an interesting\nprogram and I would defend it that you could query\ninmates on what is most valuable and then deprive them\nof it subject to --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but how do we get\naround the marriage case then?\nMR. ROVELLI: Well, I -- I don't think we\nneed to get around the marriage case in the sense that,\nparticularly as to high security inmates, prison\nofficials have very wide discretion to fashion policies\nthat serve the goals. And -- and to do it --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So as to these, the -- the\nmarriage could be banned, in effect, you're saying.\nMR. ROVELLI: It could be banned, but I do\nthink that it would be subject to a -- a pointed\nchallenge on the logical connection, but in theory,\nit's -- it is one of the instruments -- a privilege\nthat could be withdrawn for behavior modification\npurposes.\nThis case is -- is exceedingly similar to\nOverton where the Court directly observed that\nwithdrawing visitation privileges is a proper and even\nnecessary technique to -- to improve the behavior\nespecially of high-security prisoners who have few\nprivileges left -- left to lose, which is precisely the\nsame situation that we're presented with in this case.\nTurner too -- I'm sorry. Overton as well is\ninstructive on the subject of adequate alternatives.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But I thought there, there\nwas a genuine security concern, which I think you\npretty much said doesn't exist here when you consider\nwhat they can have in -- in the cell.\nMR. ROVELLI: I think that -- that in both\nOverton and this case, there were both behavior\nmodification and security concerns. And I'm not even\nsure that their weight -- they're weighted as between\nthe two altogether different between the two cases.\nActually all of the discussion in Overton was in the\ncontext of behavior modification, which is related both\nto security and to rehabilitation. But the -- the\ntenor of the discussion was actually, I would say, more\ndirected to rehabilitation.\nThe Court recognized in Overton, as adequate\nalternative means of exercising the right, letters and\nphone calls. The inmates in this case have the\nopportunity of unlimited correspondence, family,\nchaplain, and counsel visits, and as -- as we've talked\nabout, books from the prison library.\nQuickly addressing the last two Turner\nfactors, accommodating the asserted right would\naltogether defeat the goals of the policy. It would\nhave, as I alluded to when I did speak of security, a\nsignificant impact on guards and prison resources, and\nthere are no ready alternatives.\nIf I could reserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nRovelli.\nMr. Marcus.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN L. MARCUS\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. MARCUS: Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nPennsylvania's policy of prohibiting its most\ndangerous and recalcitrant prisoners from possessing\nnewspapers, magazines, and photos as an incentive to\nimprove their behavior does not violate their First\nAmendment rights.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where do you draw the\nline? I take it somewhere -- you couldn't deprive them\nof food, if that would get them to -- to conform.\nJustice Souter was asking about marriage. I mean, how\ndo we tell when -- when you can deprive someone of\nsomething they -- to modify their behavior and when it\ngoes too far?\nMR. MARCUS: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. This --\nI mean, this Court has already said that with respect\nto Eighth Amendment rights, the Turner analysis does\nnot apply. So with respect to basic -- basic\nnecessities, health care, food, and water, the -- the\nTurner analysis doesn't apply, and so you could not\nsort of create an incentive program to take away Eighth\nAmendment rights.\nAnd under -- with respect to the rights that\ncan be -- that can be limited in order to serve\nlegitimate penological interests, we think that -- that\nthe Turner approach would give a lot of deference to\nand a lot of flexibility to States to -- to use\nincentive programs --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But don't we -- don't we\nhave the same problem if we're -- if we're dealing with\nFirst Amendment interests that we do when we're dealing\nwith Eighth Amendment interests? In other words, if --\nif we don't say, well, they get outside of Turner\nanalysis because they require -- by virtue of being\nenumerated rights, they require an analysis specific to\nthem, is the abridgement of the right carried so far\nthat it is unreasonable? If we don't say that, then I\ndon't see, as your friends on the other side have\nargued, I don't see where the logical stopping point is\nif we accept the -- the behavior modification theory.\nMR. MARCUS: Well, I -- I think -- I mean, I\nthink there is -- I don't think it's a boundless\ntheory. I think you have to keep in mind that this\nprogram in Pennsylvania was -- it's implemented as a\nlast resort. I mean, the prisoners that this\nregulation applies to are a narrow class of 40\nprisoners who have been the most violent and most\ndisruptive --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, oh, I -- I realize that.\nI mean, they're -- they're making an in extremis kind\nof argument. I understand that. But if -- if we\naccept an in extremis kind of argument on the theory of\nbehavior modification, then I don't see why that\nargument does not, for example, cover the marriage\ncase, and maybe -- maybe it should. I don't know why\nthat argument would not allow for a total deprivation\nof all communication outside of, let's say, access to\ncounsel.\nAnd -- and so it seems to me that whether we\nadmit it or not, what's going on here, whether we call\nit Turner analysis or not, is we're making some kind of\na judgment as to whether they're carrying the\ndeprivation for behavior modification purposes in these\nextreme cases too far.\nMR. MARCUS: But --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And if that's what -- I'll\n-- I'll be quiet in a second.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If that's -- if that's what\nwe're doing, aren't we just as much outside the Turner\nanalysis when we're talking about the First Amendment\nor associational rights under the First Amendment as we\nare when we're talking about the Eighth Amendment? And\nshouldn't we say so?\nMR. MARCUS: I -- I don't think so, Justice\nSouter. I think there's still room under the Turner\nanalysis to apply the exaggerated response test, and\nthat's one of the things the Turner analysis does when\nyou go through the four factors, as -- as the\nGovernment did and the State has done in its brief,\nthat there could be a situation where you would find\nthat there's been an exaggerated response and that\ntheir withdrawal of the First Amendment right is\nactually an exaggerated response.\nFor example, maybe if -- if there was just\none minor disciplinary violation for, let's say, using\nobscene language, and then every -- all First Amendment\nrights to communication were -- were pulled out at that\npoint for the remainder of the time --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So -- so but at some point,\nthere's sort of a reasonableness limit then you're\nsaying.\nMR. MARCUS: There is a reasonableness limit,\nand we've -- we've --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do -- do you concede that\njust because a right is enumerated, it means it cannot\nbe entirely taken away in prison?\nMR. MARCUS: No. This Court --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, like, you know, try\nthe right to bear arms.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. MARCUS: That's right. No. I mean --\nno. This Court has drawn -- has drawn that\ndistinction. The distinction this Court has drawn is\nthat -- that most rights can be limited or even totally\nprohibited within prison, consistent with -- with\nlegitimate penological objectives, deterrence or\nrehabilitation. The exceptions this Court has\nidentified are for the Eighth Amendment and also for\naccess -- you know, access to the courts, that you\ncould -- that -- because that also implicates the\nintegrity of the criminal justice system.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Apart from those two,\naccess to the courts and cruel and unusual punishment,\nthen anything goes for this set of incorrigible\nprisoners? They can take away -- the First Amendment,\nin other words, is out the window. They have no First\nAmendment rights that the State needs to respect. Is\nthat --\nMR. MARCUS: Well, I think it would be --\nJustice Ginsburg, I think it would be a rare case where\nan incentive program like this could be struck down as\na -- you know, as a facial matter, as -- as this\nchallenge is. I think it would be a rare case. But I\nthink you do -- you do still go through all the -- all\nfour factors, and you would look at the fourth factor\nand see that, in fact, Pennsylvania does give prisoners\nthe opportunity to regain those privileges if they\nbehave well. As the State pointed out, at the time the\nrecord was made in this case --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But -- but for this -- for\nthis group, while they're in that situation,\nessentially there's no First Amendment rights. I think\nthat's what your -- your argument. They can regain\nthem, but that's the purpose of the behavioral\nmodification program. But the -- the only thing that\nthese prisoners get is the Eighth Amendment.\nMR. MARCUS: Well, we do think that -- that\nthe State can go -- can go quite far with respect to\nrestricting First Amendment rights, but this Court\nstill -- I mean, under prong two, this Court does look\nto alternative means to exercise the right. And here,\n99.9 percent of the prisoners in Pennsylvania, do get\nto possess newspapers, magazines, and photos. The LTSU\nprisoners who graduate get to, and on top of that,\nwhile they're in the LTSU, the prisoners get to possess\ntwo books. They --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Marcus, I was kind of\ninterested in your calling this an incentive program.\nIs there any -- there are no intermediate stages. It's\nan all-or-nothing incentive, isn't it?\nMR. MARCUS: Oh, not at all. There are many\n-- there are many intermediate stages. There are\nrestricted housing units and then there are SMUs and\n-- and special management units, and -- and --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, I mean, with respect to\nthe prisoners in this population.\nMR. MARCUS: There are incentive programs\nwithin each of those restricted units, and -- and the\nprisoners that end up at the LTSU -- the vast majority\nof them have already been through the SMU program and\nhaven't made it and have failed that program. So\nthey've tried numerous other incentives before getting\nto this point.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, I didn't understand\nthat the -- the prisoners in this particular part of\nthe prison had any intermediate incentive. They either\nget out after a year or 2 or they don't. Isn't that\nright? I mean, they either get to a different\nclassification.\nMR. MARCUS: Right, and that depends on their\nbehavior.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: There's no scoring. You've\ngot 25 points now, so you're pretty close to your goal\nor anything like -- it's not --\nMR. MARCUS: Well --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- not like most incentive\nprograms I've heard about.\nMR. MARCUS: Justice Stevens, they get a\nreview after 90 days and then every 30 days thereafter.\nThere's nothing in the record to suggest those reviews\nare an empty gesture.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And -- and does the review\ncorrelate it in any way with these particular\ndeprivations? I mean, what is the review -- how does\nthe review correlate with their inability to get\nreading materials?\nMR. MARCUS: Well, the -- the review\ncorrelates with their behavior, and to the extent they\nshow a positive adjustment in their behavior, their --\nthey graduate from level 2 to level 1 where they do\nhave access to newspapers and magazines and then they\ncan graduate all the way out. And my understanding is\na number of prisoners have done that within 1 year.\nAnd with respect to someone who never gets out, that\nperson might have an as-applied challenge if that\nperson could show that his behavior --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is there any evidence at\nall that the amount of reading that they do has any\ncorrelation to their opportunity for getting better\nassignments?\nMR. MARCUS: While they're in the LTSU?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes. That there's any\ncorrelation whatsoever between how much these people --\nthese prisoners read and when they get into the next\nlevel of the prison.\nMR. MARCUS: No, I don't think any such study\nis done. But again, the court of appeals was wrong to\nrequire the State to offer evidence. I mean, this\nCourt has emphasized in Turner that the connection\nbetween the regulation and the goals need merely be\nlogical.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So the legal issues would\nbe precisely the same if the State denied totally any\nreading material to the prisoners. We'd have the same\nissue.\nMR. MARCUS: Well, it would be a more\ndifficult case to defend under the second --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Why would it be more\ndifficult?\nMR. MARCUS: -- under the second prong of\nTurner because under the second prong of Turner, you\nlook to alternative means. We might still come in here\nand defend that program, but here they do provide\nalternative means to read and to see loved ones through\nvisitation and through correspondence and to have two\n-- they have two books in their cell so they can\ncontinue reading. So there -- that -- that does factor\ninto the balance, and we think it -- it's very clear\nthat Pennsylvania's program is reasonable, and it would\njust be a more difficult case if they totally\nprohibited --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I understood your argument\nto, in effect, contend that the behavior modification\nrationale will justify the program no matter what the\nbalancing process is.\nMR. MARCUS: No, that's -- that's not our\nposition. We think there is a balancing under Turner,\nand you do -- you do look at all four factors of the\ntest. And we think that Pennsylvania's just clearly\nsatisfies that test. And if you applied this across\nthe board to the general population, it wouldn't. It\nwouldn't pass the test. But -- but these are the --\nthese are the worst of the worst and they've gone\nthrough many other -- Pennsylvania has gone through\ncountless other measures to try to improve these\ninmates' behavior, and so I think it's wrong to\nconclude, as the court of appeals did, that this was an\nexaggerated response.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nMarcus.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JERE KRAKOFF\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. KRAKOFF: Mr. Chief Justice --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Krakoff.\nMR. KRAKOFF: -- may it please the Court:\nI'd like an opportunity to respond to several\nof the points that were made by my colleague.\nFirst, I find it interesting that and also of\nsome relevance in this case that the decision to deny\naccess to secular newspapers and magazines that this\npolicy of withdrawing access to these materials is not\na policy of the Federal Bureau of Prison with respect\nto its most maximum security inmates, those who are\nhoused in the control units.\nI also think it's important to note that\nwhile there's a 90-day minimum period that these\ninmates have to remain in the Long Term Segregation\nUnit on level 2 status where this -- when this policy\napplies, the policy also says that as long as an inmate\nis serving a disciplinary sentence within the prison,\nthat he's not eligible for promotion to level 1. And\nthe testimony from the department's designated witness,\nDeputy -- Superintendent Dickson, acknowledged that\nmost of the inmates in the unit are, indeed, serving\ndisciplinary time.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well -- well, it seems to\nme that that's an as-applied challenge. If -- if a\nparticular inmate -- the terms of -- the conditions of\nconfinement are particularly harsh and he -- he or she\nhas an unrealistic opportunity to get to a less\nrestrictive confinement, then -- then he can bring a\nsuit.\nMR. KRAKOFF: I was -- I was simply trying to\npoint out -- the -- the Court had asked how long are\ninmates generally in the Long Term Segregation Unit,\nand -- and the point that I made is that it's not\nunusual for inmates to remain on level 2 for periods in\nexcess of 1 year.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Krakoff, what --\nI take it you wouldn't have any objection to\nterminating of television rights, for example. If\nprisoners have the right to watch television, they\nmisbehave, the penalty is no television. Is that all\nright?\nMR. KRAKOFF: That is correct. Our position\nis that the choice of what vehicle the institution\nwants to permit through which inmates can gain access\nto what is occurring outside of the prison walls in\npolitical and other public matters, that's the\ninstitution's choice. And the reason these inmates\nsued for access to newspapers and magazines is because\nthe representative plaintiff, Mr. Banks, was allowed to\nreceive his Christian Science Monitor magazine because\nit was religious in nature, but was denied the\nopportunity to receive his Christian Science Monitor\nnewspaper under -- under this policy.\nThere's another very important --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What other\nalternatives would you have the prison administrators\nrely on? You have an incorrigible prisoner who's\nmisbehaving. He won't behave. They go through every\n-- he gets up to level -- level 2. What -- what should\nthey have done instead?\nMR. KRAKOFF: Okay. Bottom line under my\nreading of Turner and Safley is that there has to be\nfirst that logical connection under the first prong.\nBut that's not a -- an imperative --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. What\nshould they have done instead? Let's say he gets out\nof the prison 1 hour every other day. Should they have\ntaken that hour out? I mean, not out of the prison.\nOut of his cell. Should they have taken that hour\naway, or what -- what other options do they have?\nMR. KRAKOFF: Well, what their -- their\nargument is essentially that this policy was basically\na decision by default, not a decision that was reasoned\nby prison administrators. They -- they essentially\nsaid virtually everything has been taken away from\nthese prisoners.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right, and I want you\nto tell me --\nMR. KRAKOFF: And we have nothing left to\ntake away.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I would like you to\ntell me what else they should have done. Why is that\nwrong?\nMR. KRAKOFF: It's wrong because there is no\nlogical connection to taking something away under the\nfacts of this case when taking away an entire litany of\n-- or a very broad spectrum of things which -- in the\nspecial management units, where these inmates came\nfrom, they had had magazines taken away on their first\nphase in the special management units. They had been\noffered the incentive of earning access to magazines,\nof earning access to weekly visits with family members,\nof earning access to telephone calls, in fact, of\nearning access for release from their cells the 23\nhours a day to engage in -- in small group activities\nwith other inmates. And most spectacular was they had\nthe opportunity, while in the special management unit,\nto earn a 3- to 6-month probationary period in a\ngeneral population cell block.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And none of that\nworked. Right?\nMR. KRAKOFF: Absolutely. And my point is if\n-- if that didn't work, including magazines, which is\nthe equivalent of -- essentially of -- of newspapers,\nthey had no logical or --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your answer to my\nquestion is there's nothing else they could have done,\nbut they shouldn't have done this because this wasn't\ngoing to work either.\nMR. KRAKOFF: My answer is that you can't\ndeprive an inmate of his constitutional right of free\nspeech --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but consistent --\nMR. KRAKOFF: -- unless there's reason to do\nso.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Consistently with your\nanswer, it seems to me, you have to say they should\ngive the TV back, they should give the magazines back\nbecause none of those worked either. And those are\nFirst Amendment deprivations to some degree.\nMR. KRAKOFF: What they've done here is\nthey've removed all of the vehicles to --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No. But I mean, what's --\nwhat's your answer to my question? It seems to me that\nyour point to the Chief Justice was the courts have to\nreview the efficacy of these moves.\nMR. KRAKOFF: That's right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And if -- if there is no\nefficacy and there is an infringement of what, at least\nfor people on the outside, would be a protected right,\nthen they have no justification for taking those rights\naway. And if that's going to be the analysis, then on\n-- on the argument you just gave, they've got to give\nthe TV rights back, they've got to give the magazine\nrights back, and so on. Isn't that correct?\nMR. KRAKOFF: May I answer it this way? I\nknow I'm supposed to say yes or no and then --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. KRAKOFF: -- to give an explanation.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I sure would like that, but\n--\n(Laughter.)\nMR. KRAKOFF: I'll say no. My instinct is\nno, and I would also say the --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But then why? Why?\nMR. KRAKOFF: I've been reading Turner v.\nSafley and then more recently Overton because this is\nbasic in my practice to represent prisoners. And my\nreading of Overton is that you can't have a policy.\nThe prison officials cannot have a policy unless there\nis reason to believe that the policy is going to\nadvance a legitimate penological interest.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Right. And in -- in your\nargument, in your answer to the Chief Justice, you were\npointing out a situation in which taking away the TV\ndidn't work, taking away the magazines didn't work.\nMR. KRAKOFF: I think --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why then do they not, on\nyour theory, have to give TV and magazines back?\nMR. KRAKOFF: I -- I think that an\ninstitution can always make judgments about how\nextensive they want to allow inmates to --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All right. Then where does\nyour efficacy criterion go? You're saying they may\nmake judgments, and apparently they may -- may make\njudgments and maintain them even if those judgments do\nnot, in fact, advance their interests. Here, you're\nsaying they -- it's not going to advance their\ninterests, so they can't do it. In these cases, you're\nsaying they don't advance their interests, but they can\nas a matter of judgment. And I don't know how to draw\nthat line.\nMR. KRAKOFF: No. I'm -- I'm not saying they\ncan't as a matter of judgment. I -- I'm suggesting\nthat they can select among options -- we're\nspecifically speaking about access to information\noutside the prison walls. And what I'm suggesting is\nthat they can't eliminate every suitable way by which\ninmates can gain. And I think the word is of\nsufficient utility -- was the -- was the language that\nwas used in Overton. And I'm saying the bottom line is\nthey can't eliminate all means by which inmates can\naccess information.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but -- the whole\nrationale of your case -- if I were you writing your\nbrief, I would have this problem. This really matters\nto the inmates, but that's exactly the State's point.\nThat's the reason it's taken away. It really means\nsomething. And I -- I just -- I just don't know what\nto do with that conundrum.\nMR. KRAKOFF: I've had other --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and it seems to me\nit's the heart of your case and that it surfaces here\nin the answers you've attempted to give.\nMR. KRAKOFF: Obviously, this -- this did\nmatter enough to the prisoners to commence a lawsuit.\nI don't think that the standard by which a court --\nthis Court or any other Federal court should determine\nwhether or not there's a logical connection or a\nreasonable connection is whether or not inmates choose\nto file suit. That's establishing a litmus test --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But the whole basis\nfor the suit is that it matters to the prisoner, and\nthat's exactly why it's been taken away because there's\nnothing else left that we can do with these prisoners.\nMR. KRAKOFF: But I see a distinction. There\nare lots of things that matters to prisoners and lots\nof things that matter to us in the free world that\naren't going to change our behavior. There -- there\nare some things that are important to us --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What about changing other\npeople's behavior? Your -- your assertion that it does\nno good is based upon the fact that it has not altered\nthe behavior of these people who are in the unit. But\nwhat about other people who don't want to get thrown in\nthe unit? I mean, don't you have to look at the\ndeterrent effect? And -- and is it easy for you to say\nthat the -- that -- that the in terrorem effect of\nbeing deprived of -- of literature, television, or\nwhatever has not induced other people to shape up?\nMR. KRAKOFF: They made the argument that\nthis is part of an overarching deterrent program.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I think it is.\nMR. KRAKOFF: Well, but if you look --\nJustice Scalia, if -- if one looks at the record\ncarefully, you see that this policy which, by the way,\napplies to 40 inmates in one particular institution in\na -- in a prison system that has 23 adult institutions\nfor men, that this policy is essentially a classified\npolicy. The policy itself says this is not to be a\nmatter of public dissemination and is only to be given\nto personnel on an as-needed basis. The inmates who\nreceive the inmate manual in the Long Term Segregation\nUnit have to sign for it. They receive a number, and\nevery manual has to be returned.\nApart from the prison grapevine, which all of\nus know there is a prison grapevine, I submit that it's\n-- it's not great enough to tell inmates throughout the\nsystem that, in fact, if you get into the Long Term\nSegregation Unit, this very small unit, that you may\nlose newspapers and magazines. I don't think it is\nknown, and I think in order to deter, a policy has to\nbe publicized, as it was in Overton. Michigan made it\nvery clear to the prisoners, that if they got involved\ninto drug violations, that their visits for 2 years\nwould be suspended.\nAnd if I may --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So let's say if -- if the\nflaw is it doesn't deter other people because they\ndon't know about it, then if they -- if they broadcast\nit all over so everyone knows about it, then it's okay?\nMR. KRAKOFF: Well, I say that in order to\nmake a deterrence argument, at least an argument that\nmakes sense to me, that in order to deter somebody from\ndoing something, they have to know about that policy\nand they have to know what the consequences are. If\nthere were a secret policy in the State of Indiana that\nthey, you know, will execute persons committing first\ndegree murder, any argument that that's going to --\nthat the death penalty is going to act as a deterrent I\nthink --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But is there other -- are\nthere other bases? Because so far your argument is\nthey're so bad that you might as well give them\nwhatever they want because it won't matter.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, I'm parodying it, but\nyou understand why I don't think it's your strongest\nfor the reasons said.\nBut are there others which might be a little\n-- you had other arguments --\nMR. KRAKOFF: Yes, and -- and I -- I do want\nto say -- and I don't know how to say it more -- more\nclearly -- I understand it, but I'm obviously not\nframing this in a way that is getting my point across.\nI'm not suggesting that because people -- these are\nthe most incorrigible, recalcitrant inmates in the\nentire 38,000 inmate prison system, that that means\nthat they can get anything that they want.\nI'm suggesting that when you take away a very\nsignificant right -- and that is the ability to learn\nwhat is happening beyond the prison walls -- there has\nto be a reasonable basis for doing so.\nNow, if I've been reading Turner and O'Lone\nand Overton incorrectly, then I'm doing a disservice to\nmy clients.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. It has nothing to\ndo with the law. I understand your argument. Your\nargument that you have made is, at the very least, you\ncan't say that this deterrent effect is that big a\ndeal. I mean, now, there were other reasons justifying\nit. They said, for example, if one --\nMR. KRAKOFF: Security.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, and they made a big\ncase in this. It's on 188 in the appendix.\nMR. KRAKOFF: Exactly.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And they made a major point.\nThey said that with the newspapers, they set fires,\nthey throw feces. They use them as a spear, and then\nwhen asked, why couldn't you do the same with library\nbooks, or couldn't you do the same with paperbacks,\nthey said, yes, it's possible, but it's less likely\nbecause of the size of the document. And we don't have\nto forbid everything. We just forbid the things that\nwe think are particularly likely. Now, what about\nthat one?\nMR. KRAKOFF: Well, my -- my -- I suppose my\nmost straightforward answer would be that the Jewish\nForward can burn as quickly as the New York Times, that\nthe Christian Science Monitor --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then now you're\ngiving -- now you're making their situation worse\nbecause they tried to make your client's situation\nbetter. I mean, yes, they could -- maybe they could\nprohibit religious journals as well, but they -- for\nvarious reasons, they decided not to do that. Maybe\nthey could have eliminated legal materials as well, but\nagain, they decided not to do it. They take a more\ncircumscribed approach. So I'm not sure it's a very\neffective response to say, well, they let religious\nmaterials in and that can be used as well.\nMR. KRAKOFF: I think it's a realistic --\nwith all due respect, I think it's a realistic\nresponse. I'm not faulting them. I applaud them for\ndoing what was a reasonable thing.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought you were using\nthat to say that the security concern doesn't hold up\nbecause of the papers that they're allowed to have in\ntheir cells can be used similarly for fires, similarly\nto do other bad things.\nMR. KRAKOFF: Right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So I thought that's why\nyou were using that, just to say that the -- the\nsecurity concern is dubious because the materials that\nthey are allowed to have in their cells can -- could\nachieve exactly the same end.\nMR. KRAKOFF: Well, there are other things,\nJustice Ginsburg, that are routinely permitted in -- in\nthe cells and, in fact, that probably have to be in the\ncells that can be used. They're given -- they're\ngiving -- given writing paper, and the testimony of\nDeputy Dickson was that they -- they fling feces with\nwriting paper and they fling feces -- and by the way --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you know what kind of a\nfire you can make with the Sunday New York Times?\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Are you going to -- are you\ngoing to compare that to writing paper and -- and to --\nto the Jewish Advocate or whatever it is? I mean --\nMR. KRAKOFF: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- it seems to me a\nperfectly reasonable line.\nMR. KRAKOFF: The -- but it's not only --\nit's not only writing paper. It's -- and they have to\nhave blankets. The blankets are flammable. Their\nclothing is flammable. The bed sheets are flammable.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if visitors -- if\nthere's a security issue with visitors to the prisoner,\nyou're saying you can't prohibit visitors because if\nyou allow the lawyers to come in, because they're\nvisitors too?\nMR. KRAKOFF: No, I think that would be a\nspecious argument.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but it wouldn't\nundermine the security rationale just because you have\nsome exceptions where there are other countervailing\ninterests that might outweigh the security concern.\nMR. KRAKOFF: But if, in fact, their\nsuggestion is that -- if their suggestion is that the\ninmates are less likely to burn a Bible, for example,\nand assuming they're -- they're Christians rather than\nsomebody else who has the Bible, they're less likely to\nburn a -- the Bible or some book of scriptures, that\nmakes sense. But when you suggest that they're less\nlikely to burn a legal newspaper or a religious\nnewspaper, that doesn't make sense.\nAnd I'm suggesting this isn't a question of\nequities that if they're nice enough to permit these\nprisoners to read religious-based or legal-based\nnewspapers and magazines, that forecloses the inmates\nfrom saying -- does that make a lot of sense? I don't\n-- I don't think so.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is it that I should read\nthen in respect to what's actually bothering me? In\nTurner v. Safley --\nMR. KRAKOFF: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- the Court says we\nresolve, when a prison regulation impinges on an\ninmate's constitutional rights, which it does here, the\nregulation is valid if it is reasonably related to\nlegitimate penological interests. That standard is\nnecessary if prison administrators and not the courts\nare to make the difficult judgments concerning\ninstitutional operations. And that's where I think\nit's difficult to balance this case. If we were to\ndecide for you, are we going too far in interfering on\nwhat the prison administrators should be doing, or have\nthey gone too far?\nNow, if I'm supposed to look at this record\nand try and make up my mind, which I think is about\nthat question, what do you want me to look at?\nMR. KRAKOFF: I want you to read the entire\nbrief --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I'll read the briefs.\nI have no problem with the briefs --\nMR. KRAKOFF: No. I -- I suggest that our --\nmy brief might be more coherent than I today.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. KRAKOFF: And I think we make out a\nstrong case -- that we make out a strong case for why\nthe policy in question is not reasonably related to a\nlegitimate penological interest.\nI would suggest, looking at another aspect,\nJustice Breyer, that there was some comment about the\nadequacies of the -- the alternatives, the other\navenues, and that's an important consideration under\nthe second prong of -- of Turner. And I think it's --\nit's strange to suggest that the prison chaplain who\nvisits level 2 inmates for religious purposes and that\nattorneys, assuming that an inmate has an attorney,\ngenerally are going to come discuss either a section\n1983 action or a criminal case, and that relatives once\na month for an hour are going to discuss current\nevents, and that they're going to act as kind of a\nquasi wire service by summarizing--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you this\nquestion?\nMR. KRAKOFF: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You said that the prison\ngrapevine really doesn't tell the prisoners about this\nparticular lack of access to public materials. Does\nthe prison grapevine let them know that they're going\nto be in the cell for 23 hours a day and only be out 1\nhour a day?\nMR. KRAKOFF: They're actually, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If that is generally known,\nit would seem to me that that itself would be\nsufficient incentive to try and avoid this program,\nwhether or not you're going to be able to read the\nChristian Science Monitor or the New York Times. It\nseems to me that the -- the -- what we're fighting\nabout is trivial compared to the very obvious deterrent\nvalue of 23 hours in the same cell 7 days a week, 30\ndays a month, 365 days a year. I don't think I'd care\nabout this other stuff.\nMR. KRAKOFF: I agree with that point,\nobviously. But every inmate in disciplinary\nconfinement stays in what is referred to as -- as the\nrestricted housing unit, and they all know --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, I could say the\nsame thing about going to jail, I mean, at all.\nMR. KRAKOFF: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You know, I could say\nwhether I'm there 23 hours or all or not --\nMR. KRAKOFF: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- it's enough of an\nincentive that I -- that I don't want to go to jail.\nThere's -- there's incentives and there's incentives.\nMR. KRAKOFF: Yes, but I suggest that -- that\nliving in a cage and exercising in a cage in -- in\nseclusion, that's -- that's a prison within a prison.\nAnd those things deter normal people, people who --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And once you're in\nthat situation already, as these prisoners are, and\nthey're still not conforming their behavior to the\nprison rules, you have a limited number of options for\ntrying to get them to do that, and your response to my\nfirst line of questioning was that there's nothing else\nyou can think of that they could do.\nMR. KRAKOFF: At some point, the options\nexpire. They have taken so much away from these\nprisoners. Is that going to then justify? Say, well,\nwe've taken everything else and this is what we have\nleft. Is that the kind of situation where deference is\nsupposed to be high because they're making -- I don't\nsee that as a real choice. They're doing what they\nhave available.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your response is\nthey should just grin and bear it. They --\nMR. KRAKOFF: My -- my response is that they\nhave taken so much away from these inmates who are the\nmost incorrigible, recalcitrant inmates in the system.\nAnd they say in their -- in their policy that these\ninmates are either unwilling or incapable of charging\ntheir -- changing their behavior. I submit that some\nof these men probably are, and I think it's also\ninteresting that they --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I -- may I interrupt you --\nMR. KRAKOFF: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- with this question?\nAren't you really saying that when the deprivations get\nbeyond some point, some serious point, the issue is not\nproperly analyzed under Turner and Safley, can they do\none thing more? The issue really becomes one of cruel\nand unusual punishment. Is the totality that they have\ntaken away so great that it is cruel to maintain these\npeople under these circumstances? Is that the argument\nyou're really making?\nMR. KRAKOFF: It isn't. That's -- that's an\noption if one reaches the point where it truly is cruel\nand unusual. We didn't file an Eighth Amendment\nchallenge here based upon the facts that I knew.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, I know that wasn't --\nthat wasn't the claim that you made, but isn't that the\nargument that you're making?\nMR. KRAKOFF: No. And -- and I think that --\nI know in Overton there was a dissent by Justices\nThomas and Scalia that essentially said that that's\nwhat you have. You -- you have an Eighth Amendment\nargument if a policy rises to that level, but if a\npolicy doesn't constitute cruel and unusual punishment,\nthen you're out of luck. And that kind of swallows up\nthe First Amendment in my view and the other -- and\nother amendments as well.\nNow, what I'm suggesting is not that they've\nreached the point of cruel and unusual punishment. I'm\nsuggesting that there comes a time when you take away\nso many things from these prisoners, that you basically\n-- yes, you may have to give up and you may have to\nkeep them in segregation. And they do keep men in\nsegregation -- other forms -- for 10, 15 -- I\nrepresented a man who had been in segregation for 30\nyears. So it's not as though that's unusual. They do\ngive up on people in -- in the Pennsylvania prison\nsystem all of the time. That would not be unusual.\nI suggest that if we reach the point where\nthe law says that if you run out of options, you can do\nanything that you want as long as it doesn't rise to\ncruel and unusual punishment, that we may as well\nforget about --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but the State's\nposition is that it wants to avoid that ultimate\ndeterrent. It -- it wants to take away privileges for\na while to see if he can conform. You're depriving the\nState of the -- of the option to avoid the most extreme\ncircumstances of forgetting about him altogether\nforever.\nMR. KRAKOFF: Well, I -- I --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And it seems to me that --\nthat your -- your argument is -- is at cross ends with\nits own purpose.\nMR. KRAKOFF: Well, it -- unless there are\nother questions, I think I've reached --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Just let me just ask one --\none thing I am curious about. The argument -- it seems\nto me that there's kind of a flow of these. Some of\nthem get out of this system and some stay a long time.\nWhat does the record tell us about how often, if they\nconform to the regular rules without any violation for\n40 days or a year, do they -- do they get out of this\n-- this situation?\nMR. KRAKOFF: The -- the rules themselves say\nkind of in a preamble that -- that confinement is for a\nminimum of 90 days, but that often it's -- it's longer\nthan that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'm not posing what the\nrules say. Does the record tell us whether -- you\nknow, whether this system is just something we're\ntalking about or whether it really has an effect on\npeople moving from this classification to another\nclassification.\nMR. KRAKOFF: Well, there were -- there were\n10 inmates in the first 2 and half years of the\noperation, according to Deputy Dickson, who had moved\nout of -- out of the unit.\nThe record is silent as to whether any of\nthese inmates ordered subscriptions for newspapers or\nmagazines. So we don't know whether that even arguably\nwas a factor.\nI think that the -- that the State has\nacknowledged that there might be many reasons why\ninmates might leave the Long Term Segregation Unit that\ncould be unrelated to the -- the, quote, incentive of\nnewspapers and magazines. So we don't know whether any\nof them have left because they've simply gotten tired\nof being in segregation for 2 and a half additional\nyears, after flunking out of the special management\nunits, or whether there were other -- other factors.\nTwo -- what -- what is concerning is that two\ninmates left straight from the unit to the streets\nbecause their sentences expired. And so they were\nessentially people who -- you know, they -- they could\nread about the -- an ancient war in the Bible, but they\ncouldn't read about Iraq. So they were going to have\n-- I don't know if that's a healthy situation. That's\nnot from a constitutional perspective, --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What -- this --\nMR. KRAKOFF: -- but from a practical\nperspective.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What other than the\nperiodical, newspaper access differentiates this\ncustody from the next higher --\nMR. KRAKOFF: Special management unit?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.\nMR. KRAKOFF: Well, all -- the various\nincentives -- there's no possibility of earning access\nto radios or televisions in the Long Term Segregation\nUnit. The most there can be would be twice a -- twice\na month visits if they're promoted to level 1, as\nopposed to four time a month visits if they succeed in\nthe special management unit. There's no opportunity\nfor out-of-cell group activities while in the Long Term\nSegregation Unit. They lose that as an -- that's not an\nincentive. That is an incentive in the special\nmanagement unit. There's no probationary period where\nthey can be released to a general population cell block\nwhich, as the Court knows, a general population cell\nblock is -- offers many opportunities that segregated\ncell blocks don't. And that's not available.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. KRAKOFF: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Rovelli, you have\n2 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LOUIS J. ROVELLI\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. ROVELLI: Very briefly, if -- if I might\nturn myself to just the very first point that Mr.\nKrakoff made about inmates being compelled to stay in\nthe Long Term Segregation Unit until they complete\ntheir disciplinary custody. I would draw your\nattention to pages 40 and 41 of the joint appendix,\nwhich show that -- that the unit manager has the\nauthority to set aside disciplinary custody, and an\ninmate who graduates the Long Term Segregation Unit\ngets all of their disciplinary custody set aside\ncompletely. So in a sense, the -- the disciplinary\ncustody aspect is another incentive.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Rovelli, do the other\nprisoners know about this? I'd like you to respond to\nthe -- to the assertion that nobody knows about this\nanyway, so it doesn't deter anybody.\nMR. ROVELLI: The principal means by which\nother prisoners would know about it is the very\neffective prison grapevine, although it does appear in\nthe -- in a chart that's appended to the handbook for\nthe special management unit, and 75 percent of the\ninmates who wind up at level 2 come from the special\nmanagement unit.\nThe other thing I would point out about the\neffectiveness of this program, as opposed to the give-\nup-on-them proposition, is that even at -- even in\n2002, when the program was only 2 years old, 25 percent\nof the inmates who had been sent there had graduated.\nThe statistics on that are at pages 7 and 8 of our\nreply brief.\nFinally, if -- if the Court were to affirm\nthe court of appeals, then this case has to be sent\nback to trial and the burden is put on the prison\nsystem to demonstrate empirically that this regulation\ncan achieve its goals. In a sense, I've just\ndemonstrated that it has achieved its goals, but much\nmore importantly, the effect of that would be to\ntotally undermine, if not void, Turner and Overton.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
