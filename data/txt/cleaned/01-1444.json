ROBBINS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. ROBBINS: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThe Ninth Circuit held in this case that\npetitioner Ben Chavez could not assert a qualified\nimmunity defense to a section 1983 lawsuit alleging that\nhis interrogation of respondent violated the Fifth and\nFourteenth Amendments.\nmistaken.\nFirst, there was no constitutional violation at\nall on these facts. But second, if there was a\nconstitutional right implicated, that right was not\nclearly established in the particularized sense required\nby this Court's qualified immunity cases. Officer Chavez\ncould not reasonably have known that what he was doing\nviolated that right, and the judgment of the Ninth Circuit\nshould, therefore, be reversed.\nQUESTION: May I ask this question on that point\nthat you addressed before you get through? Supposing he\nthought at the time of the questioning that the\nmaterial -- the answers would be used in evidence later\non, and he knew that it would have been a violation of the\nConstitution to use those answers later on. Would he be\nentitled to qualified immunity then?\nMR. ROBBINS: Yes, because the Constitution --\nwell, because the first inquiry would be has the\nConstitution been violated. Whether he thought --\nQUESTION: But your -- I'm just directing my\nquestion at -- you sort of said even assuming a\nconstitutional violation, he nevertheless is entitled to\ngood faith immunity. And I'm saying, well, assume the --\nthe facts I've just granted, including an assumption that\nthe -- it would have been a constitutional violation to\nuse the evidence.\nMR. ROBBINS: Well, I think -- I think the --\nthe answer is that while -- while he might have believed\nthat the Constitution would in time be violated, because\nhe could not himself violate it, he couldn't -- he\ncouldn't be liable under section 1983 for committing a\nFifth Amendment violation. So the point is you don't even\nget to the question of clearly established if there's no\nestablished constitutional violation at all.\nQUESTION: But we -- we do somehow extend the\nFifth Amendment protection to the period before the actual\nintroduction of the evidence in a criminal trial. That is\nto say, we -- we permit a witness to refuse to answer\nunless the witness is given -- is given immunity from\nprosecution. Now, how do you explain that, unless somehow\nthe Fifth Amendment has some antecedent application before\nthe evidence is actually --\nMR. ROBBINS: Well --\nQUESTION: -- introduced at trial?\nMR. ROBBINS: I -- I think you've put it exactly\nright. It has some antecedent application. That is to\nsay, it applies prior to the moment at which it's actually\nviolated. The premise is we need to ensure against -- in\na way it's a prophylactic protection much like Miranda is.\nThat is to say, we will let you assert it in what is\nconcededly, for example, a civil litigation setting, a\nsimple deposition. No one would suggest that that is a\nuse in a criminal case. But we allow you to assert it\nbecause if we didn't, it would compromise your ability to\nensure that the right is protected later.\nQUESTION: Well, suppose in a civil case, the\njudge orders the witness confined to custody until he\ntestifies in violation of what we can say in common\nparlance is his Fifth Amendment right to self-\nincrimination. Is that not a violation then and there\nto -- to confine the -- the defendant until he testifies?\nMR. ROBBINS: I think it is consistent with a\nbody of well -- well-developed law that to penalize\nsomeone, particularly through that kind of a sanction, for\nthe assertion of a right is in the nature of a -- sort of\nan unconstitutional condition. And there's a well-\nestablished body of law that says --\nQUESTION: I -- I don't know that we usually\ntalk about a violation as an unconstitutional condition.\nWe -- we would say, Your Honor, I want my client released\nbecause you are violating his Fifth Amendment rights.\nMR. ROBBINS: But I -- I --\nQUESTION: And I think in a very realistic --\nreal sense you are.\nMR. ROBBINS: Yes.\nof case law that says that if you are punished for the\nassertion of a right, then under the Constitution you can\nbe relieved of that coercion.\nHowever -- but let me be clear -- the actual\nviolation of the Fifth Amendment is exactly what the text\nof the Fifth Amendment says. It says that your right is\nnot to be a witness against yourself in a criminal case.\nI suggest, Justice Kennedy, that the result -- that the\nholding in Murphy against the Waterfront Commission is\ninexplicable if you believe, as the Ninth Circuit does,\nthat it is sufficient simply to coerce an otherwise\nincriminating statement because in Murphy against the\nWaterfront Commission, the holding of that case is that\nthe State court was correct in requiring the witness to\ntestify even though there wasn't a statute that protected\nhim against incrimination because the Fifth Amendment\nitself provides the fail-safe that if you are coerced into\ngiving an otherwise incriminating statement, it cannot be\nused against you.\nAnd my central submission on the Fifth Amendment\npoint -- and of course, this is before we even get to the\nquestion whether Office Chavez could have -- you know, has\nqualified immunity. Our central submission on this is\nthat you don't even have to get to that point because the\nfail-safe of the Fifth Amendment ensures that\nMr. Martinez's statements could not be used against him in\na criminal case if they were indeed legally compelled --\nQUESTION: What -- what in your opinion in the\nConstitution prevents a policeman from going and beating\nup a witness?\nMR. ROBBINS: The Fourteenth Amendment.\nQUESTION: So, the Fourteenth Amendment means\nthat you could -- in other words, your -- your client\ncould have violated the Fourteenth Amendment if -- other\nthings being equal --\nMR. ROBBINS: Well --\nQUESTION: -- because he was a witness. He gets\nat least -- at least the suspect --\nMR. ROBBINS: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- gets the same pre-trial protection\nas a witness would, and the Fourteenth Amendment prevents\ncoercion being used against a witness who doesn't want to\ntestify.\nMR. ROBBINS: Well, let's be clear. It doesn't\nprevent all coercion. It prevents a subset of coercion\nthat shocks the conscience for purposes of the -- the\nsubstantive component of due process.\nQUESTION: The substantive due process.\nMR. ROBBINS: Yes, Justice O'Connor. That's\ncorrect.\nBut -- but I think it is important that we not\ntorture the language of the Fifth Amendment to accommodate\nthe worry that police officers will torture witnesses\nbecause that concern is completely -- can be completely\naccommodated, and routinely is in the courts of appeals,\nunder the aegis of the --\nQUESTION: You're not saying -- those things\nthat would violate the Fifth Amendment weren't introduced\ninto trial do violate the Fourteenth Amendment for the\nsimilar reasons.\nMR. ROBBINS: I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: Well, I mean, could you say --\nMR. ROBBINS: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- that those things -- you could say\nthat.\nMR. ROBBINS: Yes. You -- you could say --\nQUESTION: All right. Then why didn't he\nviolate the Fourteenth Amendment?\nMR. ROBBINS: Well, he -- well, again, let me --\nI -- I want to answer that, but I -- I -- because this is\na qualified immunity case, I always want to drop the\nfootnote that we have an extra layer of protection here\narising from the fact that none of these propositions\ncould have been -- none of the propositions adverse to us\ncould plausibly be said to be clearly established within\nthe right sense of the term.\nGetting to your question, Justice Breyer, he did\nnot violate the substantive component of the Due Process\nClause because that inquiry turns on a set of concerns,\nincluding did the acts shock the conscience. Were they\ncommitted with the intent to harm the witness in the sense\nrequired by Sacramento against Lewis?\nThe failure of the Ninth Circuit in this case\nwith respect to the substantive due process analysis was\nthat it thought that any interrogation which would render\na statement involuntary and therefore inadmissible at\ntrial must, therefore, give rise to a freestanding\nsubstantive due process claim, actionable and enforceable\nunder section 1983. That's just wrong.\nQUESTION: Mr. Robbins, going back to the Fifth\nAmendment self-incrimination privilege, I take it the\nthrust of your argument is that a police officer who fails\nto give Miranda warnings quite deliberately, doesn't say\nyou have a right to remain silent, doesn't say any of the\nrest of it, never commits a violation of 1983 unless and\nuntil there's attempt to use the information in court. So\nyou can say, police officer, you're not required to give\nMiranda warnings if we're not going to use this testimony\nin court.\nMR. ROBBINS:\nto that is yes. The -- the --\nQUESTION: So that the Miranda is -- is not an\nobligation of the police officer.\nMR. ROBBINS: I -- I respectfully beg to differ,\nand I -- I also think -- I must say, given the prominence\nof the Miranda discussion in the respondent's brief and in\nthe green -- green brief supporting respondent, I believe\nthe Miranda concerns in this case are an utter red\nherring, and let me say why.\nThe sanction for the violation of Miranda is, in\nfact, that the statements taken in violation of Miranda\ncannot be used in the direct case of the government.\nThat's the penalty for Miranda, and if that happens, you\nget the statement struck in the direct case for the\ngovernment.\nQUESTION: But there -- you're saying there is\nno 1983 penalty. The penalty is you can't --\nMR. ROBBINS: I -- I think there is no 1983\npenalty, but the suggestion that as a consequence, because\nyou don't have a freestanding section 1983 claim when the\nevidence never comes in, when the statement is never\noffered, the suggestion that that is therefore going to\nbe -- send a signal to police officers that they should\nviolate Miranda, you know, at their -- at their discretion\nI think is terribly mistaken, and for a very important\nreason and it's this: If you don't give Miranda warnings,\nyou run a serious risk that the failure to give those\nwarnings will be taken as part of the calculus under the\nFifth Amendment voluntariness inquiry. And a statement\nwhich is involuntary for Fifth Amendment purposes is\nunusable for any purpose at all, direct case, impeachment,\nderivative use. The government then has to put on a\nKastigar hearing to show that all of its evidence was\nindependently derived, which is, as the Court said in\nKastigar, a heavy burden for the government to meet.\nIt is a fool's errand I suggest, Justice\nGinsburg -- a fool's errand -- to go about deliberately\nviolating Miranda simply because the violation will not\ncause -- give rise to a section 1983 violation.\nQUESTION: I -- I just have to tell you, I -- I\ncan see your -- your point on Miranda. Miranda is an\nexclusionary rule. But I'm not sure that all of the Fifth\nAmendment is -- is treated in that way because of the\nquestions we've initially covered.\nMR. ROBBINS: Well --\nQUESTION: If -- if you beat the defendant to\nget the defendant -- to get the confession, it seems to me\nthere's a very strong argument that that is a Fifth\nAmendment violation --\nMR. ROBBINS: I think --\nQUESTION: -- A Self-incrimination Clause\nviolation.\nMR. ROBBINS: I think -- respectfully, Justice\nKennedy, I think there is a wealth of this Court -- this\nCourt's cases that cannot be reconciled with the\nproposition that coercing a statement is enough by itself\nto constitute a Fifth Amendment violation.\nQUESTION: All right. You -- I think you could\nsay after -- after 30 years or 50 years of -- of\njurisprudence, policemen know they're not supposed to beat\nup suspects or the -- the equivalent. And -- and you can\nsay, all right, at this point, I would think that does\nshock the conscience for a policeman to beat a confession\nout of somebody, and so I don't care if you call it\nFourteenth or Fifth.\nBut then the question here would be, why in\nheaven's name, when the person is undergoing serious pain,\nor he thinks he's dying, where the doctors are saying, get\nout of here, et cetera, whatever they're saying, and he\ncontinues to press and then says, well, you're going to\nget your treatment after you confess -- not confess --\nafter -- after you answer my question. What were you\ndoing? Then we'll treat you. He says, you want your\ntreatment, you'd better -- you better say something,\net cetera, et cetera.\nbeating somebody up?\nMR. ROBBINS: Well, let me attempt, if -- if I\nmight, Justice Breyer, to -- to very quickly answer\nJustice Kennedy's question. I -- I think the belief that\nthe Ninth Circuit held that it's enough under the Fifth\nAmendment simply to coerce a statement that would\notherwise be incriminating cannot be reconciled with\nMurphy and with the -- with Balsys, with the immunity\ncases, with all the cases that stand for the proposition\nthat so long as the use immunity has not been compromised,\nyou do not yet have a substantive Fifth Amendment\nviolation.\nTo turn, Justice Breyer, to your question, I\nacknowledge that there is coercion in this case. We\ndon't -- we don't blanch on that. There was coercion and\nthe facts of this case are tragic, but the -- but the\nreality is this. This officer was there to find out a\nvery important piece of information under extraordinarily\nexigent circumstances.\nQUESTION: Well, was this tried below with a\nFourteenth Amendment substantive due process claim?\nMR. ROBBINS: I don't know that it was\ndenominated substantive due process. I think --\nQUESTION: Is that in the case?\nMR. ROBBINS: I --\nQUESTION: I mean, is it open to resolution on\nthat basis?\nMR. ROBBINS: There's -- there's no question\nthat the Ninth Circuit decided a Fourteenth Amendment due\nprocess question. I don't think they -- they labeled it\nsubstantive versus procedure. And indeed, as we\nsuggest --\nQUESTION: Well, if --\nMR. ROBBINS: -- they conflated the two.\nQUESTION: -- if -- if we think the facts here\nshow sufficient coercion to rise to the level of a\nviolation of substantive due process under the Fourteenth\nAmendment, should the judgment be affirmed --\nMR. ROBBINS: No.\nQUESTION: -- but on a different basis?\nMR. ROBBINS: The judgment must be reversed,\nfirst, because there is not even a suggestion that the\nintent to harm requirement under Sacramento against Lewis\nhas been satisfied. And under this -- in this kind of a\ncase, you cannot have a substantive due -- due process\nviolation without that. No one before you today has\nargued that that Sacramento against Lewis --\nQUESTION: What is -- what is the source of the\nsubstantive -- of the intentional harm requirement?\nMR. ROBBINS:\nsuggest is the -- the principles this Court articulated in\nSacramento against Lewis for police conduct that's taken\nin enormous haste where -- where there is not the\nopportunity for a second chance.\nBut let me go -- there's a terribly important\nthing, Justice O'Connor, I have not yet gotten to say in\nanswer to your question. The further and perhaps most\nfundamental reason why it would be a mistake, I\nrespectfully suggest, to affirm this judgment, even on the\ndue process argument, is that this is a qualified immunity\ncase. So you must conclude not only that on balance this\nrises to the shock-the-conscience standard, but that it\ndoes so with such remarkable clarity that it must have\nbeen surely apparent to this officer that he was violating\nthat standard. You cannot find that on this record.\nThe Ninth Circuit thought so because of Mincey,\nwhich is a fair trial and admissibility of evidence case,\nnot a freestanding substantive due process case and which\nhad all manner of important differences from the facts of\nthis case, including an absence -- a total absence -- of\nexigency.\nWith the Court's permission --\nQUESTION: Exigency. May I ask you a question\nabout that? You said the man was dying. This was the\nonly -- only chance.\nto this entire thing. Why wasn't it enough for the\npolice, if they wanted some view other than the police\nofficers who engaged in the -- in the shooting, just to\ninterview Flores?\nMR. ROBBINS: Well, I -- I think the record\nsuggests that he was not a completely clear -- did not\nhave a completely clear view of the facts. But he's just\none witness. This is the man who was there.\nQUESTION: Wouldn't he be a lot clearer than a\nman who -- who is -- who has been blinded, who has -- was\nparalyzed, who's under heavy medication?\nMR. ROBBINS: Well, he -- he was the most\nimportant non-police witness to these events, and I\nsuggest that the officer would have been derelict not to\nhave found out what happened from him, which is what he\nwas trying to do.\nAnd with the Court's permission, I'd like to\nreserve the balance of my time.\nQUESTION: Yes, you may do so, Mr. Robbins.\nMr. Clement, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. CLEMENT: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThe Fifth Amendment privilege against self-\nincrimination safeguards the integrity of the criminal\ntrial process and ensures that an individual is not\nconvicted on the basis of a coerced confession.\nBut the privilege against self-incrimination is\nnot a direct limit on the primary conduct of the law\nenforcement officers. This is not to say that there are\nno substantive constitutional limits on what law officers\nmay do to obtain information or to secure a confession.\nBut those limits are to be found in the Fourth Amendment\nand in the law of substantive due process, not in the\nFifth Amendment self-incrimination privilege --\nQUESTION: So beating a prisoner to compel a --\na statement is not a Fifth Amendment violation.\nMR. CLEMENT: That's right, Justice Kennedy.\nIt's not a Fifth Amendment violation. It very well might\nbe --\nQUESTION: But it could be a Fourteenth\nAmendment violation.\nMR. CLEMENT: It very well -- Justice O'Connor,\nit very well could be a Fourteenth --\nQUESTION: And very likely would be.\nIs there some intent element in that for the\nshocks-the-conscience --\nMR. CLEMENT:\nas I understand this Court's decision in -- in Sacramento\nagainst Lewis, in these kind of executive action contexts\nwhere things are ongoing, I think there is some kind of\nintent element. I think that --\nQUESTION: It's not enough, you think, to find\nthat the officer should have known that you couldn't ask\nquestions in the manner that was done here under these\ncircumstances, and that to proceed gives rise to an\ninference of intent.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I'm not sure how intent\nwould need to be proven in any particular case, but I\nwould say the critical difference between the Fifth\nAmendment inquiry and the Fourteenth Amendment inquiry,\nwhen it's -- when it's done in the context of the\nadmissibility of a coerced confession, is in that context,\nwhat the courts are taking into account is the effect on\nthe integrity of the trial process of using a coerced\nconfession.\nIt's a different calculus, though, when you're\ntrying to regulate primary law enforcement conduct because\nit strikes me that not everything that a law enforcement\nofficer could do to coerce a confession -- there -- there\nmay be some acts that may be sufficiently problematic that\nyou'd certainly want to keep the confession out of the\ntrial.\nQUESTION: What about the order of a trial judge\nin a civil case who orders the witness held in contempt\nand confined unless he testifies, and -- and there's a\nvalid Fifth Amendment privilege that the judge is\noverlooking? No Fifth Amendment violation there?\nMR. CLEMENT: No. I don't think there's a Fifth\nAmendment -- I don't think there's a complete Fifth\nAmendment violation. The courts intervene there to\nprotect the privilege.\nQUESTION: So, if you go in and you want a writ\nof habeas corpus and you don't mention the Fifth\nAmendment.\nMR. CLEMENT: You mention the Fifth Amendment,\nbut I think the important thing is the Fifth Amendment in\nthis context works a -- a bit like the takings clause.\nAnd Justice Souter, for the opinion for the Court in\nBalsys, noted that the self-incrimination privilege is\nunusual because it's not purely and simply binding on the\ngovernment. It doesn't say that in all contexts, the\ngovernment cannot coerce confessions. What it says --\nQUESTION: Well, if there's a 1983 suit against\na judge in -- in this hypothetical case, what's -- what's\nthe violation?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, typically those cases have\nbeen dealt with on -- on habeas.\nis --\nQUESTION: Suppose it's a 1983 suit.\nMR. CLEMENT: If there's a 1983 suit in that\ncontext, I actually don't think a 1983 suit would lie in\nthat context.\nQUESTION: Why wouldn't there be a 1983 suit\nprovided that -- and I think this is the assumption of\nJustice Kennedy's question -- provided that the witness\nhad invoked the Fifth Amendment? There would be a 1983\naction there because that is one at least of two instances\nin which we allow the Fifth Amendment to have an\napplication in anticipation. We say if he raises it, and\nthey don't come forward with immunity, we're not going to\nlet this entire process go forward to no avail since\nnothing can ever be admitted in evidence anyway. The fact\nis we -- the -- the rule allowing it to be raised in\nanticipation I suppose would be the predicate for 1983\nliability here. That's not this case, but that -- that\nwould be true in the -- in the case of the -- the civil\nexample that Justice Kennedy gave, wouldn't it?\nMR. CLEMENT: I think that's a very good point,\nJustice Souter, and the Court has also treated in the\npenalty context --\nQUESTION: Well, is it good enough so that you\nconcede there would be 1983 liability there; i.e., that\nthere would be a violation of the Fifth Amendment in that\ncase?\nMR. CLEMENT: I don't think so, but I think it\nwould --\nQUESTION: Not that good.\nMR. CLEMENT: -- at least be a better case.\nBut as I was trying to say --\nQUESTION: Is there any violation in the case\nthat I put, any constitutional violation? I mean,\nthat's -- that's extraordinary.\nMR. CLEMENT: There is a -- there is a --\nthere -- what there is is there is an ongoing interference\nwith the Fifth Amendment right that the courts will\nvindicate, but there isn't a complete constitutional\nviolation. And I think the critical distinction is that,\nas -- as Justice Souter said for the Court in Balsys, the\nprivilege against self-incrimination is not purely and\nsimply binding on the government. The government can\ncompel testimony in exchange for a valid grant of\nimmunity. What it can't do is compel testimony and\nattempt to use it in a criminal case. And --\nQUESTION: Well, maybe the -- the point where it\nwould make a difference I guess -- nobody is talking about\nweakening or overruling Miranda. We have Miranda on the\nbooks, and Miranda set some technical requirements. You\nhave to give a warning. Now, a failure to give a warning,\npure and simple, is not going to hurt anybody if that's\nnever used in trial, so there isn't 1983 damages, unless\nyou beat the person up. Then there is. And that comes\nunder the Fourteenth.\nBut there are a set of cases where it will hurt\npeople. The set of cases where it will hurt people is\nwhere because they violated Miranda but didn't beat him\nup, and got a statement, they kept him in jail. That's\nrather like the case Justice Kennedy's thinking of. So\nthere he is in jail for a week or a month and he's been\nhurt, all right.\nAnd the question I guess is -- it's really not\nthis case, but the question is, is there going to be a\n1983 action in that kind of case? And if you say it comes\nunder the Fifth Amendment, the answer is going to be yes.\nAnd if you say it comes under the Fourteenth Amendment,\nthe answer is going to be no. I don't know if we\nshould -- it seems to me what we're going to decide in\nthis case is effectively going to decide that.\nMR. CLEMENT: No. I don't think that's true.\nI think that, for one thing, if the person is imprisoned\non some basis, that may raise an independent Fourth\nAmendment violation. There may be other --\nQUESTION:\nclaims he's wrongly seized and imprisoned because they got\nthis statement out of him in violation of the Fifth.\nThat's -- I mean, this is -- this is what's -- what's\nworrying me is not so much this case, but what we're going\nto write and the implications of it.\nMR. CLEMENT: And -- and I think that this Court\nhas already clarified in Balsys that what you need for a\nself-incrimination violation is both the coercion of the\ntestimony and the use of it in a criminal case.\nQUESTION: But may I just interrupt,\nMr. Clement? Supposing there's a witness, a reporter or\nsomebody, who claims a -- a privilege against divulging\ninformation, and that -- and the court holds him in\ncontempt and locks him up for 30 days or something, and he\nclaims he -- his Fifth Amendment right was violated, you'd\nsay there's no Fifth Amendment violation.\nMR. CLEMENT: I would say there's no -- there's\nno damages action. Of course, he could get --\nQUESTION: So how could he get out of jail then?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, he could get a habeas action\nto get out because the court would be granting relief --\nQUESTION: Well, I -- I think --\nMR. CLEMENT: -- to protect the Fifth\nAmendment --\nQUESTION:\nevading the point that there -- let's assume there's\ndamage. He's -- he's locked up, as Justice Breyer says,\nfor 5 days for not testifying, and you say there's no\nFifth Amendment violation. I can't understand that.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, in any event, let me just\nsay that the privilege works quite differently in the\ncustodial context. The reason that hypo even comes up is\nthat in the context of a civil trial, the individual has\nto raise the -- the Self-incrimination Clause themselves.\nAnd we have a different rule that operates in the context\nof police custodial interrogation. In that context, the\nprivilege is self-executing. The individual doesn't have\nto raise it.\nAnd -- as -- the other thing that's different\nabout the custodial context is that in the custodial\ncontext, this Court has not insisted on a pre-testimony\ngrant of immunity. They've always held that the\nexclusionary rules prevent a constitutional violation from\noccurring.\nAnd if I could resort to the analogy to the\ntakings clause. In that context, it's not enough for the\ngovernment to take property. It's only a constitutional\nviolation if the -- if the government simultaneously takes\nproperty and refuses to grant just compensation. In the\nsame way, there's no self --\nQUESTION: But are you saying that -- to go back\nto a question that was asked earlier, that if there -- if\nthe police just take somebody into custody and beat him up\nin order to get -- get him to talk with no intention of\nusing the evidence at all -- they're just trying to\ninvestigate a crime -- is there any constitutional\nprotection against that kind of conduct?\nMR. CLEMENT: Yes, and it's the substantive due\nprocess protection.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. CLEMENT: And I think to get back to that\npoint, what's important is in the context of trying to\nprotect the integrity of the criminal trial process, I\nwould think the courts would want to be quite careful\nabout what they let into evidence. But in the context of\nlaw enforcement officers, they're dealing with other\nobjectives than simply trying to get a confession to\nsecure a guilty verdict.\nQUESTION: Well, on the facts of this case,\nshould it be analyzed then under the Fourteenth Amendment\nfor coercion --\nMR. CLEMENT: It --\nQUESTION: -- an activity that might violate the\nFourteenth Amendment?\nMR. CLEMENT:\nO'Connor, and I would respectfully suggest that that's\nbest done on remand --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. CLEMENT: -- because, although there is a\ndue process argument in this case, it's nobody's fault\nthat in light of the -- the governing precedent in the\nNinth Circuit, the Cooper decision, that nobody thought\nthat they had to prove shocks-the-conscience, or any of\nthe factors relevant to a substantive due process inquiry.\nAgain, that's not the way respondents briefed the case,\nbut one can hardly blame them for briefing the case they\ndid, given that the Ninth Circuit had held under Cooper\nthat as long as the conduct was sufficiently egregious to\nhave the evidence be inadmissible, therefore you have a\nfull substantive due process violation. And I think\nit's --\nQUESTION: And you disagree with Mr. Robbins who\nsaid, but because of the qualified immunity, you wouldn't\nsend this back in any case.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I -- I don't really disagree\nwith him. I think this Court could reach the qualified\nimmunity issue if it wanted to, but I think perhaps the\npath of least resistance would be to just note that there\nis a substantive due process limit, and that's something\nthat's best to be resolved on -- on remand.\nI think the important -- oh, sorry.\nQUESTION: That's all right. You can make that\nsentence, if you want to.\nMR. CLEMENT: No.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. CLEMENT: Thank you very much.\nQUESTION: Mr. Paz.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD S. PAZ\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. PAZ: Justice Stevens, and if it pleases the\nCourt:\nI -- I would start with simply the simple\nobservation that the district court made a finding of fact\nin this case at page -- it's 28a and 29 of the petition\nfor writ of certiorari in the -- in the appendix. And it\ngoes directly to the issue of what we've been discussing\nand that is the -- the intent.\nAnd just if I can back up a little bit\nprocedurally, in argument today, for the first time I\nheard counsel say that they acknowledge there's no quarrel\nthat there was coercion in this case. In the district\ncourt, the entire argument was there was no coercion.\nAt the court of appeals, the entire argument was there was\nno coercion.\nAt the court of appeals and the district court,\nthe -- there was never a discussion or -- or even was the\ncase of Urquidez -- Verdugo Urquidez cited for the fact\nof -- that this was -- the Fifth and the Fourteenth\nAmendments were only a trial right. Those issues are\nbeing heard here for the first time. They were briefed\nfor the first time in the opening brief.\nCert was granted in this case on whether there\nwas a violation of the Fifth Amendment, not -- the\nFourteenth Amendment wasn't even discussed on cert.\nSo we've gone through this journey of ever-\nchanging theories of -- of liability in this case, but I\nthink we have to go back to the beginning.\nThe district court found at page 28, finally\ndefendants argued that Chavez was not attempting to\nabridge the right against self-incrimination to -- to\nexact -- extract self-inculpatory data or leads. And the\ncourt goes on to then describe what was argued by the\ndefense, that Mr. Chavez was there simply to find out what\nhappened.\nThe court directly rejected that.\nQUESTION: Mr. Paz, I'm sorry. I don't -- your\npage 28 in the cert petition?\nMR. PAZ: It's 28a in the appendix of the -- of\nthe petition for cert, yes, Justice Stevens.\nQUESTION: And where?\nit on that page.\nMR. PAZ: It starts at the -- at approximately\nthe -- the bottom of the page.\nQUESTION: \"Finally defendants argue --\"?\nMR. PAZ: Yes.\nQUESTION: Okay. I'm with you.\nMR. PAZ: Yes.\nSo the district court carefully looked at the\nevidence that had been presented, and the district court\ndecided the case really because the testimony of Chavez at\nthe time the tape recordings that he made on the day of\nthe incident and his deposition testimony -- he said\nsimply, I'm investigating the crime. I was there to\ninvestigate what -- the crime had been committed, the\ncrime of attempted murder on two police officers on the\ntheory that somehow or other this farm worker had taken\naway the officer's gun and was going to use it on the\nofficers when they shot him. That was the core of the\ncase. That was all of the evidence in the case.\nThe subsequent declarations that were submitted\nwere only submitted after -- after Mr. Martinez submitted\na motion for summary judgment that as a matter of law,\nusing all of the evidence provided by the defense and\ngiving them the benefit of the doubt on all the evidence,\nthat there was a violation of the Fifth and the Fourteenth\nAmendment.\nQUESTION: Mr. Paz, let me -- let me tell you\nwhy I have difficulty with the proposition which you're\nurging, which is that any coercion that would suffice to\nrequire the confession to be excluded from -- from trial\nis also a coercion that violates the Fifth Amendment,\nnot -- leaving substantive due process aside.\nSuppose you have a situation in which a --\na felon has taken a hostage and buried the hostage\nsomewhere, and suppose that it is possible for the police\nofficial to use a degree of coercion which would not shock\nthe conscience. It isn't beating the person with a rubber\nhose, but let's say failing to give a Miranda warning, or\nusing a -- a sort of trickery that -- that would amount to\ncoercion, threatening perhaps, you know, if you don't\nconfess, your brother will be prosecuted or something like\nthat. It would be sufficient to exclude the testimony\nfrom the confession from the trial, but the policeman\ndoesn't care about that. He wants to save the life of\nthe -- of the hostage who's been -- who's been buried.\nNow, you would say that that -- that policeman\nby extracting that confession has violated the Fifth\nAmendment.\nMR. PAZ: There may be a violation, and -- and I\nwould agree that most likely if -- if it was in violation\nof Miranda, there would be -- there would be no -- it\nwould not be admitted into a criminal case. Maybe -- it\nmay be under the Quarles exception.\nQUESTION: What -- you'd say that the person\nwould -- would have a -- a 1983 action against the\npoliceman?\nMR. PAZ: No. No, I think clearly that's the\nkind of a case in which qualified immunity was designed to\nprevent. Qualified immunity gives as -- as it did in --\nin --\nQUESTION: Only because of qualified immunity?\nQUESTION: Well -- well, let -- let's assume\nthat we decide the case, and then this happens a second\ntime.\nMR. PAZ: Then -- then clearly --\nQUESTION: You have to answer Justice Scalia's\nquestion. You can't get away on qualified immunity.\nMR. PAZ: Oh, no, no. I would say --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. PAZ: I -- I would say Quarles gives us the\ndirection. When there is an immediate danger, when\nthere's a danger to the public, then clearly there would\nbe no constitutional violation. The Court has already\nmade that decision. I -- I don't think that that's really\nan issue that we have to struggle with.\nQUESTION: You can violate the Fifth Amendment\nwhen there's a danger to the public?\nMR. PAZ: That's what Quarles, I believe, says.\nQuarles says that -- that the Miranda violation was not --\nwas not sufficient. And I -- as I -- as I recall in\nQuarles, the evidence was admitted against him. He -- he\nsaid, the gun is over there, and that evidence came in to\nprove the violation of -- of possession of a weapon. So I\nthink that the Court implicitly said that we're -- in this\nemergency situation, that there is no -- no Fifth\nAmendment --\nQUESTION: You -- you think this applies not\nonly to the -- the unique aspect of the Fifth Amendment\nthat -- that Miranda constitutes, but to all Fifth\nAmendment violations.\nMR. PAZ: No. What I -- I think once it becomes\ncoercive, once it becomes physical, once it becomes --\nthen I think that you would interfere with the core values\nof -- of the Fifth Amendment.\nQUESTION: Justice Scalia's hypothetical asked\nabout coercion. There was no coercion in Quarles. There\nwas just an absence of Miranda warning.\nForget Miranda. Let's just talk about coercion.\nIs there a Fifth Amendment violation in the case that he\nput where there was -- there's an element -- there's a --\nthere's a degree of coercion? There's no Miranda warning.\nThat's out of the case. There's no sovereign -- qualified\nimmunity. That's out of the case.\nQUESTION: Coercion to keep it out of trial.\nMR. PAZ: I -- I would say yes that there is a\nFifth Amendment violation. The question then would be,\nwhat is the remedy?\nUnder those --\nQUESTION: -- section 1983.\nMR. PAZ: No.\nQUESTION: I mean, if it's a Fifth Amendment\nviolation, you can sue the policeman.\nMR. PAZ: Under those circumstances --\nQUESTION: Well, this person who goes to prison\nfor -- for putting this person in a -- in a grave begins a\nsuit when he's in prison suing the -- suing the policeman.\nMR. PAZ: And I don't believe that's -- that\nwould be the conclusion because the remedy would not be\nappropriate because there had been, as we saw in -- in\nSaucier versus Katz, there's a situation in which the\npolice have to act, and so the police act if it's\nreasonable, even if it's a reasonable mistake, even if\nthey have the wrong guy and they try to coerce the wrong\nperson, it may be reasonable under an emergency\ncircumstance.\nQUESTION: I see. So let's assume somebody\nis -- you think he's going to blow up the World Trade\nCenter. I suppose if -- if we have this necessity -- this\nnecessity exception, you -- you could beat him with a\nrubber hose.\nMR. PAZ: I would hope not, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Oh, it's necessary.\nMR. PAZ: No. I think --\nQUESTION: Since when is -- is necessity a --\nyou know, a justification for ignoring the Fifth\nAmendment?\nMR. PAZ: Your Honor, only in the limited\nsituation. I think the first hypothetical you gave me --\ngave us was you simply were going to ask him questions\nrepeatedly. Now, I -- I don't think the rubber hose\nexample was before me.\nQUESTION: Do you know -- okay. Do you know any\nof our -- any of our cases that -- other than Miranda\nwhich, you know, is -- is in a field by itself, do you\nknow any of our cases that say that there is a necessity\nexception to the coercion prohibition of the Fifth\nAmendment?\nMR. PAZ: Not at all, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: So maybe the answer would be that --\nthat it's not -- the Fifth Amendment -- the -- the Miranda\nrules are methods of enforcing the Fifth Amendment so that\nif all is violated in -- in Justice Scalia's hypothetical\nis a Miranda rule and the person is not proceeded against\nin court and the person has not been physically injured in\nany way and has not suffered any real harm except not\nbeing read a right that didn't matter anyway, he would\nhave no damages.\nMR. PAZ: That would be correct.\nQUESTION: So he could bring his lawsuit, but\nhe'd gain nothing.\nMR. PAZ: I would agree with that analysis.\nQUESTION: Except that my hypothetical was not\nMiranda. My hypothetical was that he was coerced in some\nfashion other than the failure to give a Miranda warning,\nand short of beating with a rubber hose.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. PAZ: The distinct -- the distinct\ndifference in this case is -- and I understand that the\nexigence is -- the exigent -- the -- the terrorist\nsituation is a difficult one. It's not our case.\nMr. Martinez was riding a bicycle home.\nQUESTION: It's not your case. That's right.\nMR. PAZ: There was no call. There was no\ncrime. There was nothing that had happened except he was\nriding his bicycle home.\nthink that this is an appropriate vehicle. There may be\nsuch a case that will at some time --\nQUESTION: Well, maybe this is a Fourteenth\nAmendment case, not a Fifth Amendment case at all.\nMR. PAZ: I did -- I did consider that. And --\nand I think clearly it is a Fourteenth Amendment violation\nunder all the cases --\nQUESTION: Was it tried on that basis --\nMR. PAZ: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- presented on that basis?\nMR. PAZ: Yes, Justice O'Connor, it was. It\nwas -- it was -- that was the allegations from -- from the\nbeginning. But -- but --\nQUESTION: I don't see why the Fourteenth. I\nmean, the Fourteenth -- the Fifth applies to the States\nbecause it's incorporated in the Fourteenth.\nMR. PAZ: Correct.\nQUESTION: And -- and therefore, if in fact you\nviolate the Fifth in -- in a way that's significant, not\njust -- I mean, causes significant harm, not just you\ndidn't read a Miranda right, but you hurt somebody, then\nwhy wouldn't the Fourteenth carry that through to the --\nQUESTION: By way of the Fourth Amendment.\nMR. PAZ: Yes. I believe it does. I believe\nthe history -- and the history -- the early cases, the --\nthe Bram case in 1897 began with the concept of the -- of\nthe Fifth Amendment protecting all of the rights. And of\ncourse, Bram was a case in which -- it was against the\nUnited States.\nBut as -- as -- there's an evolution that\nI've -- I've seen through our cases that -- that show that\nthe Fourteenth Amendment, once it was incorporated, it\nactually incorporated the Fifth Amendment privileges. It\nactually -- the Fifth Amendment was really the -- the core\nvalues of what the Constitution meant to embody. It goes\nback to -- Bram cites the early -- early cases in England\nwhere, although the right against self-incrimination was\nan evidentiary rule, in Bram they -- they laud the fact\nthat it became a constitutional rule, that it became\nimmutable so that no act of Congress -- as we decided in\nDickerson not too long ago, no act of Congress could\nchange that. So --\nQUESTION: But isn't it clear by now in our\ncases that if a policeman uses excessive force that rises\nto the level of a Fourth Amendment violation, that we will\naddress it under that amendment, that the Fifth Amendment,\nthe language of it refers to use in trial of the\ntestimony? And -- and you don't have that limitation --\nMR. PAZ: I would --\nQUESTION:\nclaim.\nMR. PAZ: I would disagree with you on one\npoint, and that is the -- the language of the amendment\ntalks about a criminal case, and in our brief, we did talk\nabout the meaning, the distinction between a criminal\ntrial and a criminal case. And all of the -- all of the\nlanguage -- the most recent is in Hubbell. There's the\ndiscussion about the fact that the Fifth Amendment\ncovers -- the values of the Fifth Amendment covers\neverything from civil to administrative to bankruptcy\ncases. The Arnstein case in 1923 talked about the Fifth\nAmendment protecting a bankrupt person in a bankruptcy\nproceeding, not even involving a criminal proceeding at\nall. So the extension of the Fifth Amendment goes to\nreally the core values. We just don't force people to\ntalk, and the State can't do it. And --\nQUESTION: Excuse me. I -- you -- you mean --\nyou say it extends to a bankruptcy proceeding. You mean\nyou can refuse to provide testimony that can be used\nagainst you in a bankruptcy proceeding?\nMR. PAZ: That was the holding in Arnstein in --\nin 1923, and a bankrupt person who was under the\nbankruptcy proceeding simply said, I have a right to\nremain silent. I don't want to answer these questions.\nThe court upheld that right in the bankruptcy proceeding.\nSo early law certainly didn't -- didn't say it had --\nQUESTION: Simply because he didn't want to\nanswer the questions, or because --\nMR. PAZ: They may --\nQUESTION: -- the -- the questions would\nincriminate him --\nMR. PAZ: That's correct.\nQUESTION: -- in a criminal proceeding.\nMR. PAZ: That's correct.\nQUESTION: Well --\nMR. PAZ: But -- but there was no criminal\nproceeding --\nQUESTION: Well -- yes. There wasn't any yet\npending. I mean, I think we all understand that you --\nthat you acquire some pre-trial Fifth Amendment rights\nto -- to remain silent, but whether that means that there\nhas been a Fifth Amendment violation before the entrance\nis -- evidence is introduced in trial is -- is a separate\nquestion.\nMR. PAZ: I --\nQUESTION: Nobody questions that -- that there\nare some aspects of our Fifth Amendment law which -- which\nallow you to plead the Fifth Amendment before the evidence\nhas been introduced in trial.\nMR. PAZ:\nbeen given to the -- to the American people to plead the\nFifth Amendment in any pre-trial proceeding, including\nan -- an interrogation at -- after a -- after a shooting\nsuch as this, and after the person is the sole suspect of\na horrible crime, then obviously that is part of the\ncriminal case. That is part of the entire criminal\nprocess.\nIf we would say we only have a Fifth Amendment\nright to remain silent if we introduce it into a court --\ninto a court proceeding, then Mr. -- persons like\nMr. Martinez who were never charged with a crime would\nhave no remedy.\nQUESTION: But it doesn't have to be part of the\ncriminal case. I mean, as -- as your bankruptcy example\nindicates.\nMR. PAZ: I agree. I agree, Justice Scalia.\nI think it's important that we try to focus on\nwhat really are the bright lines here. We have three\nbright lines that were violated by -- by Sergeant Chavez\nin this case. The first is clearly coercion that goes\nback to -- to the early cases.\nThe second bright line is that there was --\nthere was an invocation in this case. Mr. Martinez twice\nsaid, I don't want to talk. Leave me alone until they\ngive me medical treatment.\nThere was invocations implicitly. When he first\nopened his mouth, he says, leave me alone. Leave me\nalone. I'm dying. Those are the first words out of his\nmouth. That's an invocation. No reasonable police\nofficer, no -- no basically trained police officer could\nbelieve that questioning a fellow in his condition was\npermissible.\nQUESTION: This -- this question is somewhat\nlike Justice Scalia's question. Suppose the same facts so\nfar as the hospital was concerned, but that the -- that\nthe incident involved a kidnapping and the injured person,\nyour client, was a witness to the kidnapping. We wanted\nto know what the kidnapper looked like so we could get the\nchild back.\nMR. PAZ: Then it's clearly -- he's not a\nsuspect. Clearly, it -- questioning is -- is obviously\nneeded. It's necessary. Of course. But -- but --\nQUESTION: Well, if -- if the questioning -- and\nsuppose he says, go away, I'm sick, I'm sick. And they\nsaid, no, no, we want your answer. Why is there coercion\nin -- no coercion in that case --\nMR. PAZ: Because he's --\nQUESTION: -- but coercion in your case?\nMR. PAZ: Because he's not a suspect. Because\nhe's -- he isn't the sole --\nQUESTION: But that's -- that's a Miranda\nquestion.\nMR. PAZ: I think not.\nQUESTION: And -- and it's a -- well, it's also\na basic Fifth Amendment question.\nMR. PAZ: It is.\nQUESTION: But why isn't -- why isn't the\nelement of coercion the same in each case?\nMR. PAZ: Because the -- the constitutional\nobligation. When the person is a suspect, the\nconstitutional obligation rises above. That's the\ndifference.\nQUESTION: Well, that -- for purposes of a\ndamage action, not for purposes of Miranda, or what's\nadmissible. But for purposes of a Miranda action, should\na suspect be in a better position than a totally innocent\nwitness insofar as the police beating him up is concerned?\nMR. PAZ: No, I would think not.\nQUESTION: No. All right. Well, if they're --\nif they're the same, then I -- I guess it would be --\nyou'd get to the same result. If they had beaten him up\nor been coercive, it should be the same problem whether\nhe's the witness or the suspect. And if they've gone past\nwhatever point is reasonable, I guess there should be\ndamages.\nbecause they want to stop an attack or something, well,\nthat's just the way it is. And -- and that's -- I'm\ntrying to figure out if that's what the law is and what\nthe right words are to get to that place and how you deal\nwith this mass of -- of constitutional rules, if -- if\nthat's the proper result.\nMR. PAZ: I think the proper result is -- is\ngiven -- given Justice Kennedy's hypothetical, the proper\nresult is if this is a -- a witness who has information\nabout some exigent circumstance, then there -- the Fifth\nAmendment doesn't attach at all. And obviously the\nofficer is not going to use leading questions, coercive\nquestions to get information. The basic concept of\ngetting information under those circumstances is you want\nit to be trustworthy. You don't want the officer putting\nwords into the person's mouth and brow-beating them to\ncome up with something that's a bad lead. So obviously we\nwant to have the kind of questioning that would be, in\nfact, seeking the truth as opposed to putting words into\nsomeone's mouth as what occurred in this case.\nThe -- I'd like to address a point that's been\nraised, and -- and it may not be totally necessary. I'd\njust like to make the distinction that the -- the basis,\nthe entire heart of the discussion that coercion is\nsomehow permissible unless the cases are introduced into a\ncriminal case or into a criminal trial are -- are the --\nthe immunity cases.\nIn the immunity cases, they -- they -- I believe\nthat the defense has -- or that the petitioners have\ntotally confused the grant of immunity and coercion in a\npublic trial after a grant of immunity where a person is\ntold, you must answer the questions. And -- and the\ndistinctions is one is an inquisitional situation where if\nthe officer has a person alone and they're forcing them to\nanswer questions, there is no public trial, there is no\njudge there to make sure that they're -- they're not\nbeing -- there is no overreaching, there is no brow-\nbeating. The person who was even under a grant of\nimmunity can say, I'm not going to talk, and face the\nconsequences of going to jail and sit in jail with dignity\nand say, I'm not going to talk. I believe that it's more\nimportant to assert my right not to speak than to be --\nthan -- than sitting in jail. Our law still doesn't allow\nthe court or the jailers to use coercion to extract their\nstatement. A person in this country still could have the\ndignity to say I don't want to speak and I'll take the\npunishment, and if it's just punishment, that it's been\ndone by a court, then that is not coercion, the kind of\ninquisitional coercion that this -- that this Court and\nthe United States has always said we don't tolerate.\nAre there any other questions?\nQUESTION: Going back to your earlier\ndistinction between the suspect and a witness, if someone\nis suspected of kidnapping a child, and that child is not\ngoing to live without some medication -- I believe this\nexample was brought up in one of the briefs -- and the\nsuspect, whatever answer, will certainly be incriminating,\nthe police may not exercise any coercion to get the\nsuspected kidnapper to tell where the child is so the\nchild could get life-saving medication?\nMR. PAZ: I believe that there can be some\nquestioning, and I think that the questioning has to be --\neven if it's forceful questioning, there must be limits.\nAnd it's -- certainly it's a balance because it has to\ntake into account what is the circumstance of this person.\nThe danger in saying I agree with that\nhypothetical, Your Honor, is that what if the person is\nthe wrong person. What if the suspect really isn't the\nperson who kidnapped the person? What if they're just\nwrong and they got the wrong person? That's the danger,\nand that's why we have to --\nQUESTION: And on the other side is -- is the\nlife of a child.\nMR. PAZ: That's correct. And it's -- it's\nalways a difficult choice, but we have -- we have to --\nQUESTION: -- it's difficult at all if they know\nthat this is the fellow that did the -- they have all\nsorts of evidence. They know this is the guy that -- that\nburied the child, or deprived the child of medication or\nwhatever. It's not a hard question at all.\nMR. PAZ: Then I think -- I think that there\nis -- we have to look at Quarles for guidance and, again,\nit has to be the degree of the -- the degree of coercion\nthat is permissible. It's difficult to say that any\ncoercion is permissible. But again, given -- with the\nlimited hypothetical and limited facts, it's -- it's\ndifficult to make a judgment at this point.\nQUESTION: Mr. Paz, what do you -- what do you\ndo with the Murphy case that's relied upon so extensively\nby -- by Mr. Robbins? As I understand that case, it was a\nState legislative commission which accorded immunity to\nthe witness under State law, but of course could not\naccord immunity under Federal law. And we held that the\nwitness, nonetheless, had to testify, and we said, of\ncourse, if the feds try to use the evidence, it will not\nbe admissible because it was -- it was obtained under\ncoercion. But we, nonetheless, allowed the State to\ncompel the testimony. Now, were we allowing a Fifth\nAmendment violation?\nMR. PAZ: No, Your Honor.\nI understood, that the -- the use immunity that was\ngranted in -- in Waterfront was extensive with the\nprivilege. It was allowed -- that is, as I understand the\nreading of the case, was that the privilege that -- that\nthe -- the immunity that was granted was sufficient to\ncover both any State prosecution as well as Federal\nprosecution.\nQUESTION: No, no, no. That wasn't the case.\nThat was the whole problem. The State could not grant\nimmunity from Federal prosecution. It -- it granted\nimmunity only from State prosecution. And we said,\nnonetheless, the State could -- could lock the person up\nuntil he testified. And the only consequence would be\nthat if he did testify, it would not be introducible in\nFederal trial because it -- it had been coerced.\nNow, I -- you know, it's a bizarre case, but it\ndoes seem to stand for the principle that Mr. Robbins\nasserts, which is that there's no Fifth Amendment\nviolation until the evidence is introduced.\nMR. PAZ: We all make mistakes, Your Honor.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: You think -- you think that was one\nof our mistakes.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION:\nin your -- in your research on this with anything that\nsuggests that -- that once the person is a suspect, and\nonce he's in custody of the police, that the criminal case\nhas begun?\nMR. PAZ: Yes.\nQUESTION: Or is it clear that that isn't? Is\nit clear that the criminal case that the Constitution\nrefers to is -- is not really begun until it's what we'd\ncall technically is a criminal case, the filing, you know,\nindictment, or -- et cetera?\nMR. PAZ: I -- I think there was good language\nin -- in Colorado versus Connelly. Justice O'Connor wrote\na concurring opinion I think that covers the point quite\nwell that said that -- and there was also the --\nQUESTION: It says that -- what? That the\ncriminal case had begun at the time he was in custody?\nMR. PAZ: As I recall, the -- the discussion was\nthat there had been an argument that the -- that Mosley's\nstatement -- that that by using Mosley's statement,\nbecause there had been no police coercion, that it was\npermissible because the purpose of the -- of the rights,\nthe Fifth Amendment, was to prevent police misconduct and\ncoercion. And -- and in that context there was a -- there\nwas a discussion about -- that the -- that the -- that\nthere was -- that because the rights protect outside of\nthe criminal case and outside of the trial, that there was\nno -- there would be no deterrence. There would be no\nreason to enforce it at that point.\nAlso there was Michigan versus Tucker. Both\nMichigan and -- and Colorado versus Colony -- Connelly\nboth discuss about a two-part inquiry. Should -- should\nwe -- and the Court indicates in both of those cases that\nthere's an analysis of whether the police officer conduct\nviolated the Fifth Amendment, and then secondly, what is\nthe remedy. So really, those two cases talk about the\ndifference between the right pre-trial in the custodial\ninterrogation setting, as well as -- as does Miranda, and\nthe difference between the remedies that the court\nconsidered.\nAny further questions?\nThank you.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Paz.\nMr. Robbins, you have, I think it's, 3 minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE S. ROBBINS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. ROBBINS: Thank you, Mr. -- Justice Stevens.\nLet me just quickly make a couple of points.\nIt seems to me that petitioner can win this case\nthe hard way or the easy way. The easy way is recognizing\nthat this body of law is, as one of the members said this\nmorning, a complex of constitutional issues with cross\ncurrents that cut in a variety of directions, that in\nlight of Verdugo Urquidez, in light of Sacramento against\nLewis, it cannot be said that any of these constitutional\nprinciples was sufficiently clearly established to warrant\nthe rejection of qualified immunity. But I want to win it\nthe hard way.\nFirst, because under Sacramento against Lewis,\nthe standard for substantive due process is intent to\nharm. That wasn't pled. That wasn't tried. There's no\nsuch argument before you today. No one thinks that if\nSacramento against Lewis applies, there can be a\nsubstantive due process claim at all. That's why it\nwasn't in the complaint. And no one here before you is\nsuggesting intent to harm.\nNow, on the Fifth Amendment, Justice Kennedy,\nI'd like to take one more crack at the concern that you've\narticulated because I think it is -- it is in fact\npossible to square those concerns with the holding in\nMurphy against Waterfront Commission which, as far as I\ncan tell, is perfectly good law and consistent with what\nthis Court said in footnote 8 of Balsys about the fail-\nsafe of use immunity provided directly by the Fifth\nAmendment. So long as the government has not compromised\nthe availability of use immunity under the Fifth\nAmendment, there hasn't been a Fifth Amendment violation.\nIn each of the penalty cases that are suggested\nby your hypothetical, that's what the government has done.\nThey have said to the witness, you may not have immunity.\nYou may not assert your Fifth Amendment. If you assert\nyour Fifth Amendment right, we're going to put you in\nlock-up right now. The Court has consistently said, you\nknow, if you forfeit the use immunity and actually put a\nguy in jail because he insists on it, that's as good as\nuse. That's a protection that stems from the Fifth\nAmendment itself.\nAnd that's -- that explains all of the so-called\npenalty cases. The police -- the Garrity case in New\nJersey, the two Lefkowitz cases out of New York. That\nexplains -- what is, in fact, going on there is someone is\nbeing punished or penalized for the assertion of a\nprivilege, including the right against use.\nBut as long as the fail-safe in the words --\nJustice Souter, that you used in -- in footnote 8 of\nBalsys, as long as the fail-safe of use immunity has not\nbeen compromised, as it has not been in this case, there\nis not yet a full Fifth Amendment violation, which can\nonly happen when there's a use in a criminal case.\nAnd that is exactly the point that this Court in\nVerdugo Urquidez said in the passage that the Ninth\nCircuit decided to call dictum and ignore. That was a big\nmistake. And on that ground alone, it's the Fifth\nAmendment portion of its decision --\nQUESTION: But, Mr. Robbins, why couldn't -- why\ncouldn't --\nMR. ROBBINS: -- that should be reversed at the\nfirst threshold.\nQUESTION: Why couldn't you view the continued\nquestioning under the circumstances of this case as\ntantamount to punishment when you have locked somebody up\nwho won't answer questions?\nMR. ROBBINS: Well, I -- I think because --\nwell, for one thing, the availability of use immunity is\nstill there. What you -- what I think it would -- what I\nthink -- what I think it would amount to is continued\ncoercion of a statement which arguably at some threshold,\nonce you cross it, does indeed become too coercive to\nrender the statement admissible. But that's when the\nFifth Amendment fail-safe steps in and says, you may not\nuse it. That would violate the Fifth Amendment. But\nbecause the fail-safe wasn't compromised in this case, as\nit was in the line of cases suggested by Justice Kennedy's\nhypothetical, there cannot be a Fifth Amendment, and we\ndon't even have to reach the question of qualified\nimmunity.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you very much,\nMr. Robbins.\n"
