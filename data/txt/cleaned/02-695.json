Racing\nAssociation of Central Iowa.\nGeneral Miller.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS J. MILLER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. MILLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Iowa Legislature, consistent with the Equal\nProtection Clause, can charge different tax rates for its\nriverboats and its racetracks for a number of legitimate\nState interest reasons, including and especially the one\nhighlighted by the district court judge here, the\npromotion of the development of river communities.\nIn 1983, Iowa broke ground and got more friendly\nwith gambling and allowed horse racing and dog racing in\nour State.\nQUESTION: It's called gaming if -- if you favor\nit.\nMR. MILLER: I -- is there a neutral term, Your\nHonor?\nIn -- in regard to gaming, one of the main\npurposes of having horse and dog racing was to develop a\nnew subset of our agricultural economy, the breeding,\ntraining, and raising of horses and dogs. And that\nsucceeded. It turned out to be about a $50 million\nindustry.\nSix years later, with visions of Mark Twain in\nthe background and the two incredible rivers in America\nsurrounding our State, the Mississippi and the Missouri,\nthe legislature authorized riverboat casinos, riverboat\ngambling. And one of the main purposes there was tourism,\neconomic development for the river communities and\nriverfront development. In a very short time, there were\n$17 million worth of investment along the various\nriverfronts.\nA few years later, though, neither gaming\nenterprise was -- was doing as well as they would like,\nindeed, not doing -- not doing well at law.\nIn regard to the riverboats, the problem was,\nwell, Iowa had this sort of, in a way, naivete maybe about\nbetting. They restricted the amount of bets on\nriverboats. It could only be a $5 bet and one couldn't\nlose more than -- more than $200 in one setting. Well,\nIllinois had a different view and had no limits and were\nstarting to succeed competitively.\nThe -- the situation with the racetracks was\nmore severe, that economically it just wouldn't work to\nhave racing, either horse racing or dog racing alone. So\nIowa became the first State in the Nation to allow the\nsort of the -- the golden goose of gambling, slot\nmachines, at racetracks.\nQUESTION: So now the bulk of the earnings are\nfrom slot machines rather than the races. Is that right?\nMR. MILLER: That -- that's right, Your Honor.\nIndeed, really the slot machines support the -- support\nthe racing.\nQUESTION: But under your scheme, I take it the\nhighest tax rate for slot machine income at racetracks is\n36 percent versus 20 percent for slot machines on\nriverboats.\nMR. MILLER: That -- that is correct, Your\nHonor.\nbasis. Actually in next year it's -- the 36 percent would\nbe -- would be reached.\nQUESTION: And you want to offer a rational\nbasis for that scheme?\nMR. MILLER: Yes. Yes, we do, Your Honor. And\nwhat -- what we say is that the development of the -- of\nthe riverboats could be rationally preferred by the -- by\nthe legislature because of riverboat development, because\nof economic development on the -- on the rivers.\nAdditionally, the -- the district court found\nthat the additional rational basis could be sort of\nsupporting the riverboat enterprises as a -- as an\nindustry, promoting riverboat history.\nAlso, we argue that there was a problem of\nriverboats leaving the State, that three out of six in the\nprevious -- previous to 1994, the legislation year, had --\nhad left the State.\nQUESTION: Well, because of that legislation,\nthe Delta King left the Sacramento River and it's gone up\nto the Mississippi.\nMR. MILLER: Well, that was the next purpose,\nYour Honor, to try and get other boats to -- to come to\nIowa, and apparently --\nQUESTION: They're -- they're saying -- and\nmaybe there's -- I take it from their brief that, look,\nthere's never been a tax scheme like this. Obviously, a\nState very often would -- would tax at a different rate a\nhandsaw and a screwdriver, but we've never heard of a\nState that said when you sell a screwdriver, you pay 5\npercent tax if you sell it in Des Moines and a 3 percent\ntax if you sell it in Dubuque, and if it's sold by one\nkind of a person, they sell 8 percent tax, and it's all\nthe same screwdriver. So they're saying there's never\nbeen a -- really a tax system like this anywhere, and --\nand they better have some pretty good reason or -- or\nsomething.\nI mean, now -- so is all that true, that there\nnever has been a system like that, saying the same\nscrewdriver, everything identical, all it is is it's sold\nin different parts of the State or by different people,\nand -- and you have to pay a different tax?\nMR. MILLER: Well, I think there's been many\ntimes where the -- the taxpayer has been -- been treated\ndifferently even if -- even if the transaction is the\nsame.\nQUESTION: Like what? Like what?\nMR. MILLER: Sort of the -- the enterprise\nzones, for instance. Communities are -- are given\nfavorable tax rates all the time for economic development\npurposes and that's what's here. And --\nQUESTION: Typical -- typical sales tax. You\nknow, the State may tax a barber's income at a different\nrate than a hairdresser's and yet they may use the same\nstuff.\nMR. MILLER: Yes. Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, that\n-- that would -- that would be another example.\nAnd, you know, the State has great latitude in\nthe taxation area and justifiably so because there are so\nmany complexities that -- that that be available to the\nState.\nQUESTION: Do -- do you agree, at least to the\nextent the respondents say, that there's no other State in\nwhich slot machines are taxed at a different rate\ndepending on their location, that this is unique to Iowa?\nMR. MILLER: I -- I think as far as I know,\nthat's -- that's the -- that's the case. Slot machines\ntypically are not in multiple purposes -- not multiple\nplaces like Iowa. Typically they're in -- they're in\ncasinos. So there's not -- not a lot of apt comparisons.\nBut you know, this is -- this is a -- a question\nfor the legislature. When there's no suspect category or\nfundamental right available, the legislature has -- has a\ngreat deal of -- of discretion. And the enterprise -- the\npurpose of the enterprise is different. The economic\ndevelopment as opposed to the agricultural, for instance.\nWhen that -- when that is the case, the -- the legislature\nreally has -- has a great deal --\nQUESTION: So I push their argument or am I\nimagining -- I'm trying to put it the strongest way.\nLook, cosmetologists and barbers do different things, and\nmoreover an enterprise zone is a special part of the State\nthat's not exactly the same. Something different is going\non there. Here it's slot machine income. Nothing\ndifferent is going on. Nothing.\nMR. MILLER: Well, there is difference --\nQUESTION: I -- I -- yes, go ahead.\nMR. MILLER: There is difference in -- in the\nenterprise. One has slot machines and table games. The\nother has slot machines and -- and racing. But here you\nhave a -- a series of communities in -- in eastern Iowa\nand then in western Iowa along the rivers that had\nsuffered loss of manufacturing jobs. This was -- this was\nan effort, a legitimate effort, on the part of the\nlegislature to advance a new industry, a tourism industry,\non the two rivers.\nQUESTION: As I understood it, didn't -- didn't\nthe tax on the -- the higher tax on the racetracks come\nlater?\nMR. MILLER: It was -- it was phased in, Your\nHonor. That --\nQUESTION: And I can't quite understand how\nimposing an extraordinarily high tax on racetracks is\nsuddenly going to provide a benefit for riverboats.\nMR. MILLER: Well, the legislature, of course,\nhad the -- had the discretion to -- to have them both at\n36 percent. The -- the benefit of the -- to the -- to the\nriverboats was that -- that they didn't go to the higher\nrate that -- that the -- that they did for the -- for the\nracetracks. It's sort of a chicken and egg problem, but\n-- but they're spared that -- that higher rate and -- and\nthat's -- and that's an appropriate benefit.\nQUESTION: It's across-the-board rate for\neverything that goes on at the riverboat, right? It's a\n20 percent rate, whether its roulette or card games or\ndice, it's all 20 percent.\nMR. MILLER: That's it. The --\nQUESTION: For the race, there's a great\ndisparity between the parimutuels. It's only what, about\n5, 6 percent?\nMR. MILLER: That's right, Your Honor. There's\na -- there's a very favorable rate for the -- for the\nracing at the -- at the racetrack. So it's a -- in a\nsense it's a -- it's a blend of rates between the two.\nAgain, understandably so --\nQUESTION:\nother gaming activities on the riverboats different from\nthe slot machines on the riverboats?\nMR. MILLER: No, Your Honor, it's not. It's --\nit's the same. It's the same rate. So you have -- you\nsort of have 20 percent there as opposed to, say, as was\njust pointed out, 4 or 5 percent for the racing at the --\nat the racetrack.\nQUESTION: So it's administratively easier to\ncalculate if you have all one rate for the riverboat?\nMR. MILLER: It would be -- it would be more\neasily to -- to calculate and more efficient.\nQUESTION: You say the riverboats, obviously,\nare located on the rivers which bound Iowa on the east and\non the west. How about the racetracks? Are they\nscattered throughout the State?\nMR. MILLER: They are scattered throughout the\nState. Two of them are on the -- turned out to be on the\nrivers. But the largest one, the premier one, Prairie\nMeadows, is in the Des Moines area in -- in central Iowa.\nQUESTION: Add that if we looked into this at\nany depth at all, we'd discover this originated from a\nlegislator who hated racetracks and loved riverboats and\nwas trying to kill the whole thing. And then they say\nthat besides that, there was a report of a committee that\nsaid all this enterprise zone -- we don't think that's so,\net cetera, et cetera.\nMR. MILLER: Well, I mean, shocking that -- that\na legislator on -- on -- in riverboat country would try\nand help the -- help the riverboats. I mean, that's, for\nbetter or worse, part of the -- part of the legislative\nprocess, always was and always will be. And -- and courts\ncan't be sort of cops to -- to make sure that -- that they\n-- that they do not do that.\nQUESTION: Well, under --\nQUESTION: If we ever look to the real reasons\nfor things, it would be a disaster, wouldn't it?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. MILLER: Yes. Well, it's, you know, the old\nadage about sausage, making sausage, that you shouldn't\nwatch it, that --\nQUESTION: But the Iowa -- the Iowa Supreme\nCourt seems to think it could look to what was the real\npurpose, not the purpose that we could conceive. Lots of\nnice purposes like the riverboat drifts away and the\nracetrack is --\nBut you said something in your reply brief that\n-- that really surprised me. It seems to me that if we\nsay -- if you're talking about Federal equal protection,\nthis is an area in which the leeway for the legislature is\nthe widest that there is.\nokay, we're just doing this under Iowa equal protection,\nand we can make that whatever we want? And for us, the\nreal purpose counts, not the conceivable purpose.\nMR. MILLER: Yes. The -- you know, the -- the\nlegislature -- the court could have said that they were\ndiverging from -- from the standards of this Court.\nQUESTION: But you said they couldn't do that on\nremand. On page 6 of your reply brief, you said that the\nIowa Supreme Court cannot reconsider the State court\ndecision in order to subsequently establish an adequate\nand independent State ground. Why couldn't it?\nMR. MILLER: Well, our argument is -- is, Your\nHonor -- and we know we're -- we're into sort of a little\nbit new territory here. But our argument is that -- that\nthe court has made a decision that the -- the analysis --\na clear decision that the analysis is the same under the\nFederal and the State constitutional provision. If that\nanalysis, judged by a higher court, is determined to be\nwrong, then that would -- would seem perhaps to settle it.\nBut more significantly, the -- the respondents\ndidn't argue below that there was a separate analysis,\nthat -- that they should look at it separately.\nQUESTION: But they could. I mean, nothing\nwould foreclose them on remand or the Iowa Supreme Court\nitself.\nMR. MILLER: Yes. It's -- it might not, but we\nargue that -- that they sort of waived that argument, that\nthey didn't argue that in -- in the first time through,\nthat they -- it was a different analysis. They conceded,\nlike everybody else, and assumed that it was the same\nanalysis.\nQUESTION: All our opinion would say, if we\nreverse the Supreme Court of Iowa, was remand it for\nfurther proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\nAnd so certainly, so far as our remand order is concerned,\nthe Supreme Court of Iowa is free to do whatever it wants\nso long as not -- as it's not inconsistent with our\nopinion.\nMR. MILLER: I understand, Mr. Chief Justice.\nMaybe I'm making my argument too soon and -- and will --\nQUESTION: I doubt if you'll have any better\nluck with it before the Supreme Court of Iowa.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. MILLER: Well, we -- we will -- we will try\nI -- I assume.\nWhat -- what we're saying here is that -- that\nthere are multiple legitimate State purposes available\nthat are well within the zone of Nordlinger and the\nrelated cases that have been before this Court, that --\nthat this is comfortably a legitimate State interest, a\nnumber of them, most specifically the development of the\n-- of -- of the river communities. And that's -- that's\nconsistent --\nQUESTION: Would it make any difference in your\nanalysis -- I don't know if this is true or not -- but if\nthe legislative history, if you had a complete record of\nall the debates and everything else, and it was perfectly\nclear that the hypothetical reasons you advance were\ndefinitely not the reasons that motivated the particular\ntax rates, that they did it just, say, to get even with\nthe racetracks because somebody was unhappy with something\nthey had done in the past or something like that, would\nthat make any difference?\nMR. MILLER: Well, I -- I don't think that\nthere's -- there would be sufficient legislative history\nto foreclose rational speculation.\nQUESTION: No, no. Take his hypothetical.\nThere is.\nQUESTION: I'm assuming that there is, that --\nthat there's a reason out there that -- that -- none of\nthe reasons that you advance were, in fact, considered by\nany of the legislators. In fact, they rejected them.\nThey thought, we really don't want to help the riverboats.\nWhat we want to do is do something to really penalize the\nracetracks because they're an immoral business, they're\neven worse than gambling on the rivers. But that's why\nthey're doing it.\nQUESTION: And they put that right in the\npreamble to the act.\nQUESTION: Would that make any difference in\nyour analysis?\nMR. MILLER: I -- I think that that kind of --\nkind of history would not, in a rational speculation case,\nthat -- that --\nQUESTION: I guess my question is, is it\nrational speculation when you know it's not true?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. MILLER: Well, I -- I suppose not.\nQUESTION: Well, it's usually not true. I mean,\nusually these things are done for the self-interest of --\nof legislators from various districts, and -- and as long\nas there could be a rational -- I -- I would have -- I'm\nsurprised it took you so long to answer that question.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. MILLER: I wanted to be thoughtful, Your\nHonor. But like -- we get back to -- to the -- the rough\nand tumble of the legislative process as -- as you\nsuggest, Your Honor, is such that the courts don't --\ndon't review that, don't -- don't --\nQUESTION:\nreally the point? The courts just don't review it. And\nunless you get to -- to some fact pattern that -- that\ngets you a -- a higher level of scrutiny, it's not so much\nthat we're engaging in rational basis scrutiny. We're\njust saying we can't touch the political process unless\nyou get yourself into a suspect class. Isn't that really\nwhat we're saying?\nMR. MILLER: That's -- that's pretty much --\npretty much what's -- what's being said here and -- and\nhow the cases have been interpreted. And is -- and it\nmakes -- makes a lot of sense because like you -- like you\nsuggest, Your Honor, when there's -- there's not a\nfundamental right or a suspect category, that's the pure\nlegislative authority and that's where democracy kicks in\nour -- in our country, for better or for worse, and the\nassumption is that if they make a mistake, democracy later\nwill -- will catch that mistake.\nYour Honor, I'd like to -- to now turn it over\nto -- this has been my first argument, so I refer to him\nas my safety net.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. MILLER: Kent Jones from the Solicitor\nGeneral's office, and reserve what time is remaining after\nhe is done.\nQUESTION:\nMr. Jones.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. JONES\nON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. JONES: I'd like to thank counsel. And Mr.\nChief Justice, and may it please the Court:\nTaxing decisions are like spending decisions\nbecause they affect the State's economy, as well as its\nbalance sheet. In recognizing that fact, this Court has\nconsistently upheld the -- the -- has consistently held\nthat a State's desire to promote or foster one type of\nbusiness over another or even to promote or foster one\nmode of doing a business over another is a rational basis\nthat supports taxing the one and exempting the other.\nFor example, in State Board v. Jackson in 1931,\nthis Court held -- upheld a tax differential, a different\ntax treatment, of chain stores versus single enterprise\nretail stores. Even though these businesses did\nessentially the same commerce, the Court held that in the\nState's exercise of its broad authority to govern the\neconomy of the State, it can prefer one mode of doing the\nsame business over another.\nAnd that same rationale has been applied by this\nCourt in numerous contexts involving tax distinctions\nbetween, for example, warehouses located near railroads\nand warehouses not located near railroads, between\nlaundries that are operated by hand and laundries that are\noperated by machine, and even between individuals and\ncorporations that are conducting identical businesses.\nQUESTION: What about -- what about slot\nmachines owned by Republicans versus slot machines owned\nby Democrats?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. JONES: Assuming that we're still talking\nabout State laws --\nQUESTION: No, that's exactly -- I'm serious\nabout --\nMR. JONES: Assuming we're still talking about\nState laws, I would have to ask myself what would be the\nrational basis. The rational basis --\nQUESTION: The rational basis is the Republicans\nhave a majority in the State legislature.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. JONES: Well, that might explain -- the\ndifference I think between your hypothetical and -- and\nwhere I'm trying to come from is that the rational basis\nhas to be related to a legitimate State purpose. There's\na -- a legitimate State purpose in fostering certain kinds\nof commerce and suppressing others.\nQUESTION:\nmachines owned by farmers and slot machines owned by city\ndwellers?\nMR. JONES: It's -- it's hypothetically\nconceivable and that's the question that this Court asked\nitself under -- under FCC v. Beach. Is there a\nconceivable State interest that would justify that\ndistinction? And obviously, that -- the fact that there\nhas to be one doesn't mean there always is one, and I'm\nnot standing here saying, well, every imaginable\ndistinction is justifiable. The distinction in this case\nis simply between -- is whether the State could\nconceivably have preferred riverboats over racetracks.\nQUESTION: What -- what have we held wasn't\njustified outside of a suspect category situation, such as\n-- I don't mean Republicans and Democrats. You're into\nFirst Amendment suspect categories I suppose. What --\nwhat have we ever held was -- was irrational that didn't\ninvolve race or -- or, you know, political discrimination\nor something like that?\nMR. JONES: The -- there's a case that Justice\nGinsburg could tell us about. She argued a case where\nthis Court -- I think it was called Weinberger v.\nWiesenfeld, a case -- not a tax case. It was a Social\nSecurity benefits case, and the Court held that the\ndistinct treatment of -- of the surviving spouse's\nability --\nQUESTION: It's a suspect category, and I mean,\nwe're into sex discrimination.\nMR. JONES: Well, it -- it was described by the\nCourt as -- as a rational scrutiny case, and it said there\nwas no legitimate State interest because in -- in the\ncontext between treating differently male and female\nsurviving spouses, in light of the objective of that\nstatute, which was to protect the -- the children of the\ncouple, there was no rational basis to prefer one rather\nthan the other.\nThat is -- that is the only case that I can cite\nto you where this Court has applied a rational basis test\nto strike down a Federal statute. There may well be\nothers.\nQUESTION: There are others, but it's -- it's\nthe -- it's quite interesting, is -- is there a -- there\nare two sets where they're struck down. One is what you\nmight call the heightened rational basis which are\nnormally not economic regulation, but there was the mental\n-- the mental -- the building, you know, the -- of the\nhome for the mentally disturbed or whatever. And then\nthere are the ones that are out-of-state, which are\nDormant Commerce Clause cases. But is there any which is\na pure rational basis in an economic area?\nanswer to that is no, and I can't think of one.\nMR. JONES: I -- I can't think of one, but it's\nnot because there is no rational basis test. It's because\nin applying this test, the Court is very deferential in\nrecognizing that States have intentionally been given this\nauthority over regulating State commerce, and that these\nkinds of choices are left to the legislative branch.\nQUESTION: Mr. Jones, when you talked about\nFederal tax, I thought you were going to say the one that\nyou have in your brief, Martz against Commissioner.\nMR. JONES: Well, I -- we understand that to\nhave been a case where the -- which you also argued I\nbelieve, unless I'm remembering the wrong case --\nQUESTION: That was -- that was -- you left out\nthat cert was denied.\nMR. JONES: Ah.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. JONES: I made another mistake in the brief\nthat I'll get to later if I have a chance. But that\nwas --\nQUESTION: These are all cases she won or lost?\nMR. JONES: I'm afraid --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: You didn't -- you didn't make the\nmistake of citing one that she lost, did you?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. JONES: No, I don't think so.\nQUESTION: There are no such cases.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Oh, yes, there is and it was a tax\ncase. It was a State tax case.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. JONES: But -- but the -- it was -- it was a\ntax case. But in that case, the Court -- you were -- the\nCourt was persuaded that the distinction was invidious.\nThe Court didn't say that a different treatment of\nunmarried men and unmarried women in this particular\ndeduction context was irrational. The Court said it was\ninvidious. So I believe that the only tax -- Federal tax\ncase that has -- well, I don't believe there is a Federal\ntax case that this Court has decided that violated --\nfailed to meet the rational basis test.\nThe -- the court below made -- the Iowa Supreme\nCourt -- where it went wrong was looking to only one of\nthe purposes of the statute. There were many purposes.\nThey looked to just the purpose of whether it aided\nracetracks, which just kind of strikes me as an\nunrealistic way to look at what the purpose of a\nlegislation that imposes a tax on racetracks would be.\nBut to answer a question that Justice Stevens\nraised earlier, when -- in applying the rational basis\ntest, the courts are to look to any plausible or\nconceivable theory. And -- and in FCC v. Beach, as well\nas other cases we've cited, in applying that test, the\nCourt has said that you don't look -- you're not bound by\nthe facts of the particular case. And indeed, you're not\nsupposed to make fact findings as to what these legitimate\ninterests might be. Instead, you're supposed to allow the\nState any rational legitimate interest that the Court\nmight -- might be able to perceive and -- and nail down\nthat point in that case by saying that -- and I'm quoting\n-- it is entirely irrelevant whether the conceived State\npurpose actually motivated the State's decision.\nSo you don't have -- the State doesn't have to\nshow that these rational, legitimate State interests, in\nfact, motivated the decision. It doesn't have to show\nthat they are, in fact, the basis for the decision because\nthis is a Federal constitutional question. This is not a\nquestion of interpreting the State law. If we wanted to\ninterpret the State law, we'd want to know what its\npurpose was, but that's not this task. In looking at the\nconstitutional limitation, it only -- it only takes effect\nif the State has no conceivable or plausible legitimate\ninterest in the classification.\nOne other point to mention briefly is they say\nAllegheny Pittsburgh points another direction. Allegheny\nPittsburgh was the rare case that this Court said in\nNordlinger -- was the rare case where there was a West\nVirginia State constitutional provision that said all\nassessment -- all property taxes will be levied based on\nmarket value. A local assessor in that State didn't like\nthat and he -- he assessed taxes based on acquisition,\nwhich is prices, which is the last sale price of each\nproperty, and that resulted in -- in a differential\ntreatment of each taxpayer. And what this Court held in\n-- in Allegheny Pittsburgh was that because the State\nconstitution prohibited any taxation other than market\nvalue, there was no legitimate State interest to justify\nthe -- the distinguishing tax rates.\nWell, that case doesn't have any application\nhere because there's no provision in the Iowa constitution\nthat says that the Iowa Legislature cannot, in regulating\ncommerce, prefer or promote riverboat traffic and\nriverboat --\nQUESTION: Do you read Allegheny as saying that\nthe -- if the State had enacted exactly the scheme that\nwas being administered there, that it would pass equal\nprotection review?\nMR. JONES: It -- well, in Nordlinger, the Court\n-- if I understand your question right, in Nordlinger, the\nCourt upheld an acquisition -- last sale price tax scheme\nI think in California where there was no constitutional\nprovision in California that required market value\ntaxation.\nQUESTION: Would the answer in this case be\ndifferent if the Iowa Supreme Court told us that the Iowa\nconstitution requires that all slot machines be taxed\nalike?\nMR. JONES: I think that you would make -- I\nthink in that -- in looking for a legitimate State\ninterest, you would make an inquiry into whether the Iowa\nconstitution prohibited preferring riverboats --\npreferring riverboat commerce because a legitimate State\ninterest for Federal purposes -- and the Court made this\nvery point in response to a dissent of yours in -- in the\nopinion by Justice Brennan in the Minnesota v. the Clover\nLeaf Creamery case.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Jones.\nMr. McCormick.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK McCORMICK\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. McCORMICK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI think the Iowa Supreme Court in this case, as\nthis Court will determine as it reviews the opinion,\naddressed two questions, not merely one question, in this\nequal protection challenge.\nThe first question the court addressed is what\ndid the legislature have in mind in enacting this\nlegislation. In doing so and in answering that question,\nthe State court was doing what State courts routinely do,\ninterpreting State law.\nOnce having determined the meaning of State law,\nas was its prerogative, the court then moved to the second\nquestion which is the only question that the State and the\nUnited States have argued here, really, which is the equal\nprotection issue.\nWe think the first question has to be answered\nbefore you jump to the second.\nQUESTION: Well, what about the -- our decision\nin FCC v. Beach, which was just referred to earlier, where\nit says it really doesn't make any difference what the\nactual facts were?\nMR. McCORMICK: The -- the decision in Beach, as\nI understand it, did require the establishment of a\nlegitimate State purpose under the FCC provision that was\nat issue. In fact, the court of appeals had sent the case\nback to the FCC: Tell us what you had in mind, and the\ncourt of appeal -- or the FCC said, we can't think of a\nbetter reason than was given by Judge Mikva in his\nconcurring opinion, and this Court accepted that as being\na plausible basis then for the distinction that was at\nissue in that case.\nQUESTION: But we have said that any conceivable\nrational basis is enough. We don't care what Iowa really\nhad in mind.\nMR. McCORMICK: I think you do, Your Honor, and\nI think the case that was mentioned earlier, the\nWeinberger case, is an illustration of how it makes a\ndifference. In that case, as the Court ultimately found,\nthere was gender discrimination which was inappropriate in\ndealing with the issue survivorship benefits as to\nspouses, and the argument that was being proffered by the\nGovernment in that case was, this is okay because this\nstatute was intended to take care of women who have\ntrouble, when they are widowed, getting by in the work\nplace.\nQUESTION: If you think gender discrimination\ncases aren't different, you're just wrong.\nMR. McCORMICK: No, Your Honor. I -- I am not\nsaying that the analysis was the same, but I am saying\nthat the Court looked to the actual intent as it was shown\nby legislative history.\nQUESTION: Some legislatures -- some\nlegislatures don't have legislative history. What is to\nbe done in those cases? What, do you -- you convene a\ntrial court to take testimony from legislators and others\nto find out what was the actual intent of the legislators?\nMR. McCORMICK: What is routinely done in Iowa\nis what we did in this case, which is -- and what courts\nroutinely do at the State level, at least what's done in\nIowa, is that the court looks at any available materials\nthat would bear on the concerns --\nQUESTION: There are no materials. I mean, some\nStates don't have legislative history. They just don't\nkeep it.\nMR. McCORMICK: That's right.\nQUESTION: What do you do in that case?\nMR. McCORMICK: I'm telling you.\nQUESTION: Do you call witnesses?\nMR. McCORMICK: We don't have -- we do not have\nrecords or transcripts of legislative debates at committee\nhearings.\nQUESTION: So were -- were -- was testimony\ntaken from legislators asking why did you vote for this\nbill?\nMR. McCORMICK: No, Your Honor, but --\nQUESTION: Why not?\nMR. McCORMICK: -- affidavits -- excuse me. But\naffidavits were obtained that explained what the concerns\nwere that were being addressed. We have a full record.\nThis was a summary judgment motion in which we put in\ninformation that was available to the legislature.\nQUESTION: Affidavits from legislators?\nMR. McCORMICK: Yes, Your Honor, but not saying\nwhy they voted as they did, but explaining the legislative\nhistory. And the Iowa court routinely, in dealing with\nthe meaning of State law, has accepted the kinds of\nmaterials that we put in the summary judgment record.\nQUESTION: Why didn't they explain why they\nvoted as they did? If, as you say, the -- the intent of\nthe legislature is the criterion, why didn't you ask them,\nwhy did you vote the way you did?\nMR. McCORMICK: Because Iowa, like this Court,\nsuggests that an individual legislator is incompetent to\nsay that, but Iowa, like this Court, will permit\nlegislators to explain legislative history, which is what\nwas done here. That's what we did with these legislator\naffidavits. The Iowa Court used the kinds of materials\nthat States use when they --\nQUESTION: The whole is the sum of its parts.\nIf you're really interested in why the legislature did it,\nyou ought to get affidavits from every legislator saying\nthis is why I voted for it, and if 51 percent voted for it\nfor a certain reason, that was the reason.\nMR. McCORMICK: In a State like Iowa, where we\ndon't have the kind of information that's available from\nCongress, what we do is we ask our court to determine what\nthe legislature intended as it must in many, many cases,\nincluding this kind of case, and offer the court the kind\nof information, the background information that's\navailable.\nQUESTION: If that's how it's done in Iowa, it\ncan be done that way. This Court, when it's dealing with\ntax cases, it doesn't do it that way. It doesn't look for\nthe actual purpose.\nAnd in -- and in the Wiesenfeld case, the whole\nthing was driven by it being a gender classification, and\nthe Government's argument was this was pure favor to\nwomen. And the argument is that, no, that was not the\nactual purpose.\nMR. McCORMICK: This Court has said in several\ncases -- it has said in the Nordlinger case and also in\nHeller against Doe -- that even in a rational basis case,\nto be plausible, a justification must not be precluded by\nthe record.\nAnd, for example, that is how Nordlinger\ndistinguished Allegheny Pittsburgh because Allegheny\nPittsburgh had determined that the West Virginia property\ntax scheme was a market value valuation or appraisal\nsystem. And in Nordlinger, the position was being\nadvocated, well, this case is governed by Allegheny\nPittsburgh. You can't have an acquisition value system\nlike California. The Court distinguished Allegheny\nPittsburgh by saying that the record in Allegheny\nPittsburgh precluded the legislative goal of having a\nmarket value -- excuse me -- having an acquisition value\ntax system. That's how the case was distinguished.\nQUESTION: But if you're looking at what -- what\nthe legislature did, they did one thing great for the\nracetracks. They gave them permission to have these slot\nmachines, which they didn't before, so they're preferring\nthe racetracks by giving them this, but they say not too\nmuch because we're going to let you make money from these\nslot machines, but not too much. We're going to take a\npiece of it.\nSo you like what they did, the permission to\nhave the slot machines, but then say, ah, but once -- they\nhave to give us as sweet a deal as they gave the\nriverboats. They didn't have to give you anything. They\ndidn't have to let you have the slot machines.\nMR. McCORMICK: Well, Your Honor, our argument\nabout that is that they -- they threw us a lifeline when\nwe were faced with economic disaster, just as they were\nthrowing a lifeline to the riverboats, but it had an\nanchor attached to it. What they did, of course, was have\na 2-year moratorium before the first escalation of tax\noccurred and they provided for a total of 10 years before\nthe 36 percent is effective. It will be effective next\nyear.\nQUESTION: But it was -- it all came in in the\nsame legislation, didn't it --\nMR. McCORMICK: That's correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: So they gave you something you never\nhad before and it was pretty good, but you didn't --\nMR. McCORMICK: The Iowa Supreme Court said what\nthey did by that legislation was put us in a class the\nsame as the riverboats with respect to slot machines,\nwhich was the main activity at both -- both venues, and\nthat they treated us differently by imposing this\ndraconian --\nQUESTION: Well, then to treat you the same, I\nthink that they would have to raise the parimutuel betting\nfrom 5 percent, whatever it was, to 20 percent.\nMR. McCORMICK: Your Honor, the record here\nshows that parimutuel betting has invariably been a losing\nproposition at the tracks, and the legislature, when it\npassed this statute, specifically and expressly required\nthat the riverboats use the revenue first to pay their\ndebt, because they were in terrible circumstances, but\nsecondly to subsidize the purses at the parimutuel betting\nand to promote the -- the horse industry. And such --\nthese are mandated goals which were -- which the\nlegislature required.\nQUESTION: That the riverboats do that or that\nthe tracks do that?\nMR. McCORMICK: No. That the racetracks do\nthat.\nQUESTION: Oh, okay. You said the riverboats.\nMR. McCORMICK: I'm sorry. I meant the\nracetracks are required by the statute to -- to do those\nthings. Parimutuel betting has -- has never been a source\nof net revenue in -- at least since the bankruptcy of the\nmain racetrack in 1992.\nQUESTION: As I understand, the riverboats\nwouldn't make money either if they didn't have the slot\nmachines.\nMR. McCORMICK: Well, that's certainly arguable.\nThey've had them since they were initiated. Their problem\nin 1994 was getting rid of the betting and loss limits.\nBut the -- the Iowa court -- and it's our\ncontention that this was a matter that was within the\nprerogative of the court -- in ascertaining the\nlegislative intent in this case, said it was not the\nintent of the Iowa Legislature to benefit riverboats at\nthe expense of the racetracks.\nQUESTION: So how does this work? I mean, I\nthought there was a distinction between your trying to\nshow in a case like this that the rational purposes that\nare advanced simply are not served -- that's a factual\nmatter. And I take it that's Allegheny. They showed that\nthe -- that this wasn't a way to bring about what they\nclaimed.\nMR. McCORMICK: Yes.\nQUESTION: All right. But it's not open to you\nto show that the legislature didn't really have that\nmotive for the reason that if the courts permitted you to\nshow it, there would be no end to that. People would be\narguing about legislative theories in State cases like\nthis forever.\nSo if that's right -- I -- I mean, you're not --\nI don't think you can show the first. Maybe you can.\nMR. McCORMICK: Well, our contention is that --\nQUESTION: Yes -- is you can.\nMR. McCORMICK: -- this Court left that open to\nus in Allegheny Pittsburgh.\nQUESTION: Yes. I think it did leave it open,\nbut you see, they come in with some rational purposes, and\nyou think you've showed here that -- that they don't --\nthat this -- this particular statute could not serve those\npurposes as a matter of the world of fact?\nI mean, one is, for example, they say if we\ndon't have a lower rate -- you've heard it -- they'll go\noff to some other place, and they have one that went to\nsome other place. And you don't deny they went to some\nother place.\nMR. McCORMICK: Well, the question is not only\nlegitimacy of the goal, but whether there is a rational\nrelationship and whether the classification involved is\nreasonably related to any differential treatment.\nAs in Allegheny Pittsburgh, our complaint here\nis a comparative one. It's the comparative treatment for\nthe same activity essentially in the same place because\nwe've got racetracks in two of the cities that -- that are\nthe cities where two of the three riverboats were in fact,\nand -- and on the same activity, which is what the Iowa\nSupreme Court found when it determined that for\nclassification purposes, it saw no difference except that\none was a facility that was fixed and the other floated.\nAnd then having -- having made that\ndetermination of the equal situation, the court looked at\ndifferential treatment too and said --\nQUESTION: But there was another factor that --\nthat was part of it, isn't it? There was a 20 percent\nrate across everything, all the kinds of games that they\nhave on the riverboat. So that's nice and\nadministratively convenient. You don't want to have one\nrate for the slot machines and another one for blackjack.\nMR. McCORMICK: Yes, Your Honor. And that rate\nwas in place in 1994. There wasn't any change in the tax\npaid by riverboats. The legislation imposed for the first\ntime, because it authorized for the first time, a tax on\nslot machine usage and activity at the racetracks.\nQUESTION: May -- may I address a -- a slightly\ndifferent argument that you were making, I think you were\nmaking a minute ago? And that is, now -- it had two\npremises.\nNumber one, you said our own cases show that a\n-- a conceivable rational basis cannot be relied upon when\nthe record indicates that in fact that was not the basis\nfor the legislation. So fact limits what is -- what can\nbe considered as conceivable.\nNumber two, you said a moment ago that the Iowa\nSupreme Court made a determination about the -- the\npurpose of the statute, and -- and at least they\ndetermined that the purpose of that statute was not to aid\nriverboat gambling.\nSo I take it your argument is you can't argue\nthat this differential treatment is rationally related to\nthe promotion of -- of riverboat development or river\ndevelopment because the Iowa Supreme Court has\ndefinitively determined that that was not the case. Is\nthat a fair statement?\nMR. McCORMICK: That's certainly part of our\nargument, yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: All right. My -- my question I guess\nis this. There is no question that the Iowa Supreme Court\nin the construction of the Iowa constitution can approach\nmatters that way. If this Court approaches matters that\nway, then in effect we're going to have two different\nmethodologies, one for Federal cases, I guess, and -- and\none for -- for State cases. And we're going to have to\ntake every State case subject to fact determinations made\nby the State courts, and that's going to limit the\napplication of this conceivable rational basis test.\nWhy would it not be wiser for us to say, just to\nkeep the systems running smoothly, look, we are not going\nto be bound by State court determinations of legislative\nintent or purpose? The State courts are perfectly free to\ndo that under their own constitutions, but when it gets to\nus, we will not accept, for example, the determination in\na case like this by Iowa that the purpose was not to aid\nriverboat gambling. Why wouldn't that be a sensible way\nfor us to -- to go, leaving the State courts to run their\nsystems any way they want to?\nMR. McCORMICK: We think, Your Honor, that the\nquestion of the meaning of State law has always been\nwithin the domain and prerogative of -- of the State\ncourts.\nQUESTION: But this isn't a question of State\nlaw. It's a question of State fact in applying a Federal\nlaw, i.e., the -- the rational basis scrutiny under the\nFederal -- the Equal Protection Clause.\nMR. McCORMICK: Yes, Your Honor. I'd invite\nyour attention to Metropolitan Life Insurance Company\nagainst Ward, which came out of Alabama, dealt with\nburdensome taxes placed on out-of-state insurers that\nwanted to do business in Alabama. That case, like this\none, involved a summary judgment proceeding where\ninformation was put into the State court record. The\nState in that case advanced, as I understand it, something\nlike 17 reasons as rational bases for that\ndifferentiation.\nNow, this Court reviewed two of them because the\nState court held that they were valid justifications under\nthat summary judgment record. This Court reversed,\nfinding that those justifications were not valid or\nsupportable. They were not rational. But this Court did\nnot go further than to look at the other proffered\njustifications by the State.\nfor completion of the summary judgment proceedings.\nAnd what was being done in that Alabama case is\nexactly what we did in this case by looking at the summary\njudgment record.\nQUESTION: I thought that was -- involved\ninterstate discrimination against out-of-state actors.\nMR. McCORMICK: That was the -- that -- that was\nthe issue that was being reviewed on equal protection --\nQUESTION: But here you have everybody internal\nin the same -- the same State. So I think that's a\ndifferent case.\nMR. McCORMICK: Excuse me, Your Honor?\nQUESTION: Well, you're not discriminating\nagainst out-of-staters, which is a Federal concern.\nMR. McCORMICK: Yes, Your Honor. I'm not\ntalking about the -- the equal protection issue there.\nI'm talking about the manner in which the record was\ndetermined and the State court was given the prerogative\nof telling this Court what it determined the purposes were\nof the law.\nQUESTION: But if you're -- if you're right\nabout how Iowa goes about doing things, then you go back\nand tell the Iowa court, the Supreme Court has this any\nconceivable purpose test. You have what's the real\npurpose test.\nof what equal protection is and -- and that's the end of\nit.\nMR. McCORMICK: We're going to say that we\nthought the -- this Court would say if the record showed,\nwhatever the record was, in this case our summary judgment\nrecord, that the rational speculation by the Government is\nnot supported by the realities of the situation, then that\nthe court -- that sort of justification is not plausible.\nWe thought that's what this Court's view was.\nWe certainly will argue to the Iowa court that\nit is within its prerogative initially first to decide\nwhat the legislative purposes were, as it does in many\ncases and as this Court has in many cases respected when\nit is doing Federal constitutional review where the\nmeaning of a State law is a threshold issue. We'll be\nthen inviting the Iowa court, if this Court remands the\ncase, to reconsider the case under the Iowa constitution.\nQUESTION: Mr. McCormick, why isn't there a\ncategorization problem in this case? I mean, there is no\nIowa law pertaining to slot machines in particular. There\nis a law taxing table games at -- the revenues from that,\nat 20 percent. Right?\nMR. McCORMICK: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Why isn't it perfectly reasonable to\nlook upon these laws this way:\nwhich has nothing but table games at 20 percent on all the\ntable games. It is taxing a business which has parimutuel\nbetting plus slot machines at 5 percent for the parimutuel\nbetting and 34 percent for the slot machines.\nI mean, you certainly wouldn't be complaining if\nthey taxed racetracks at a combined rate of 15 percent or\n-- or a combined rate of -- of 30 percent for that. Now\nyou -- you would have no complaint. So why does it make\nany difference if they simply, instead of picking one\npercentage, charge 5 percent on the parimutuel and 34\npercent on the slot machines? But they're two different\nbusinesses. One is just table games. The other one is\nhorse -- horse racing and slot machines. They're --\nthey're different businesses. They're taxed differently.\nMR. McCORMICK: Well, the -- at least the view\nof the Iowa court was that these two enterprises, the\nriverboats and racetracks, are engaged in the same\nbusiness. They are in the same class. And singling one\nof those taxpayers out for differential treatment violates\nequal protection in the view of our court.\nThe -- the --\nQUESTION: Your court is entitled to -- to view\nit that way from State law, but they were -- they've said\nthat State law mirrors Federal law, and just because they\nchoose to look at it that way, that doesn't mean I have to\nlook at it that way.\nMR. McCORMICK: No, Your Honor. That's --\nthat's certainly correct.\nBut in terms of the classification here, we\nthink that the State court was warranted in finding that\nthese two taxpayers are in the same class. Parimutuel\nrevenues have -- have not, from 1994 -- actually\nimmediately preceding that and subsequently, ever been a\nfactor in the revenues of racetracks except a negative\nfactor.\nThe table games -- that's an advantage that the\nriverboats have over racetracks, not a justification for\ndifferential treatment for putting a heavier tax on the\nsame activity at the racetracks.\nQUESTION: It's an odd position when you say\nthere was no obligation whatever for the State to allow\nslot machines at racetracks, but if they allow it, they\nhave to be as generous to the racetrack as they were to\nthe riverboats. What didn't come in as a discrete item\ncame in as part of the whole gambling operation. It is\nstrange to say not only -- once you give it to us, you\nhave to give us the best deal.\nMR. McCORMICK: We're not -- we're not really\nsaying that. We're saying that -- that any differential\ntreatment cannot be of the magnitude that exists here and\nbe consistent --\nQUESTION: But you'd have no equal protection\nargument at all if they didn't let you have the slot\nmachines.\nMR. McCORMICK: That's correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Iowa -- the Iowa court made the\nstatement, as I understand it, that the Iowa Equal\nProtection Clause and the national Equal Protection Clause\nhad identical requirements at least for the purposes of\nthis case.\nMR. McCORMICK: What they said was that they\napplied the same analysis as this Court.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nNow assume, for the sake of argument, that we\ndon't accept the analysis for purposes of Federal equal\nprotection. Do you understand the Iowa decision to be\nthat there is -- despite that finding on our part or that\nconclusion on our part, that there is no question that\nwhat they said in that opinion does reflect the Iowa Equal\nProtection Clause and the result that they reached will be\nand -- and can be found on the basis of this opinion to be\nthe result under the Iowa clause?\nMR. McCORMICK: Yes, Your Honor. We --\nQUESTION: So that what we do will make no\ndifference in the -- in the ultimate result in this case.\nMR. McCORMICK: If the Iowa Supreme Court, if\nthis case were remanded, determines through the use of the\nsame analysis, the same result --\nQUESTION: Unless they change their rationale,\nthere is no question, as I understand it, on the basis of\nthis opinion what the result will be. Is that correct?\nMR. McCORMICK: Well, it -- I sure hope so.\nQUESTION: I mean, you're going to -- yes. I\nmean, that's what I --\nQUESTION: They can't blame it on us.\nQUESTION: No, that's quite right.\nQUESTION: I mean, right now they're blaming it\non us, and if they want to take the blame themselves --\nhow -- how are they appointed? Are they appointed or\nelected?\nMR. McCORMICK: They're through a Missouri Plan\nappointed, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Missouri Plan appointed.\nQUESTION: Well, the Supreme Court of Iowa in --\nin its opinion in this case said that the Iowa Equal\nProtection Clause and the Federal clause were the same or\nsubject to the same analysis, didn't they?\nMR. McCORMICK: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And I suppose if we decide that it's\nwrong on the Federal section, it goes back to the Supreme\nCourt of Iowa, they could just as easily say, well, our --\nour State equal protection follows Federal equal\nprotection. If the Supreme Court of the United States\nsays the Federal is one, we're going to follow the\nFederal.\nMR. McCORMICK: We think that the court has --\nQUESTION: It's not foreordained what they will\ndo.\nMR. McCORMICK: No. You're -- you're right,\nYour Honor. I'm just --\nQUESTION: So you think -- you think that is\nopen to them --\nMR. McCORMICK: I think that --\nQUESTION: -- the way -- the way they wrote it.\nMR. McCORMICK: Oh, I think so. I think it\nwould be available to the Iowa court.\nQUESTION: Well, they'd have to eat their words.\nMR. McCORMICK: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: I mean, they'd have to say we're\nchanging our law.\nMR. McCORMICK: That's right.\nQUESTION: And I doubt that this is the first --\nis this the first case in which they've said we -- we\nfollow Federal law on equal protection?\nMR. McCORMICK: No, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: I didn't think so.\nMR. McCORMICK: In fact, there are cases where\nour court, in applying exactly the same analysis that this\nCourt has done, has reached different results. We have\nBierkamp against Rogers in our brief in which our court\ninvalidated the Iowa --\nQUESTION: Judges don't like to eat their words.\nMR. McCORMICK: We're hopeful.\nQUESTION: But as I understand it, they didn't\nsay, we follow the Feds. They said, they are identical.\nMR. McCORMICK: Well, what they said is the\nscope and the import of the two constitutional provisions\nare the same. Actually part of that -- if one looks at\nthe history in Iowa, there's an old case, 1911 case, State\nagainst Fairmont Creamery. The Iowa court for years in\ninterpreting the Iowa equal protection provision never\nmade any reference to Federal law. And that case, for the\nfirst time in 1911, cited a couple of cases from this\nCourt and said our decisions are in harmony with the\ndecisions of the United States Supreme Court.\nI believe the evolution shows and history shows\nthat what the court has done since then is for\nconvenience, because of the availability of the precedent\nof this Court, said we use the same analysis. And we --\nwe do the same thing in antitrust law.\nthing in civil rights law, even though we have some\nstatutory differences.\nBut the court is still free to arrive at a\ndifferent result under that analysis, and in this case\ncertainly the court arrived at the decision that it did\nnot only under the Federal Constitution but the State\nconstitution.\nQUESTION: It would mean they were wrong twice,\nboth in their interpretation of Federal law and also in\ntheir interpretation of Iowa law, right?\nMR. McCORMICK: I don't believe so, Your Honor,\nbecause I think what they have said is that they use the\nsame analysis. They don't say the same result is\nforeordained. This -- our court, for example, doesn't\nfollow the Lyon case on the issue of the good faith\nexception to the exclusionary rule. The court has been\nindependent, treated State grounds as being adequate and\nindependent in appropriate cases, even though generally,\nas it said here, it tracks with the Federal cases under\nsimilar provisions.\nOne thing I'd like to mention to you because I\nthink it is a little bit of a misinterpretation of reality\nto suggest that these riverboats were created in Iowa to\n-- to sit on our border rivers. The statute involved and\nthe implementing regulations will allow a riverboat in\nIowa on any river in Iowa, on any lake in Iowa, or on any\nreservoir. And -- and there is, in fact, as the record\nshows, a riverboat on a landlocked lake in southern Iowa\nsuch that for comparison purposes, comparing these\nracetracks, two of which are in river cities, and --\nactually all three of them in river cities, but two of\nthem in river cities where there were also riverboats at\nthe time of this --\nQUESTION: How do you get the boat to the\nlandlocked lake?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. McCORMICK: It's an interesting process.\nOne either builds it there or carries it with --\nQUESTION: Humphrey Bogart. Humphrey Bogart\ngets it there I think.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. McCORMICK: Yes. It's African Queen.\nAnd the notion that there is any particular\nnavigation or -- or sailing involved with these -- with\nthese methods of housing gambling activities is -- is more\nimaginary than real.\nI appreciate very much your attention. We\nbelieve that this Court in reviewing past State court\nequal protection decisions and more recently in the -- in\nthe tax area in Williams against Vermont and Hooper\nagainst Bernalillo County has -- has respected the -- the\ndeterminations that have been made by the State courts as\nto what legislative intent was, as we ask the Court to do\nin this case, and in those cases, and applying -- after\nthat threshold determination, applying equal protection\nanalysis, found the statutes under a rational basis\nanalysis did not comport with equal protection. We think\nthis is a case where the record will support this Court in\nfinding that the Iowa Supreme Court got it right and that\nthe State and Solicitor General have it wrong under this\nrecord.\nThank you.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. McCormick.\nMr. Miller -- General Miller, you have four --\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS J. MILLER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. MILLER: I would just point out that\nMinnesota v. Clover Leaf Creamery Company is the -- is the\ncase where this Court decided that in -- in a case before\nthis Court that comes from a State court, that the Federal\nprocess, the Federal analysis applies, and that the total\nwork, the total decisionmaking done by the State court is\nreviewable here, so much so that in that case they\nreversed a factual finding in -- in the court.\nI would emphasize too that -- that the Iowa\nSupreme Court has said that -- that the analysis is -- is\n-- always is the same between the State provision and --\nand the Federal provision, and has only departed, as a\nmatter of result, only one time, the Bierkamp case, in the\n130 years that the two provisions existed at the same\ntime.\nWith that, I would respond to any questions that\nyou might have or -- or conclude by asking you to uphold\nthe constitutionality of this -- of this act because there\nare multiple legitimate State interests developed by\nrational speculation to support the legislation. Thank\nyou.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, General\nMiller.\n"
