CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument

Cannabis Buyers.
General Underwood.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA D. UNDERWOOD
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
GENERAL UNDERWOOD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may
it please the Court:
The Controlled Substances Act prohibits the
distribution of marijuana outside federally authorized
research programs because Congress, the Attorney General
and the Secretary of Health and Human Services have each
determined that there is no currently accepted medical use
for the drug, and it has a high potential for abuse.
The statute also recognizes that new information
might come to light that would justify less restrictive
controls so it establishes administrative procedure for
changing the classification and the restrictions for
marijuana and other controlled substances.
That statutory scheme leaves no room for the
Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative to distribute
marijuana without the approval of the Attorney General
under a claim of medical necessity, and it leaves no room
for a court to consider such a claim as a basis for
refusing to enjoin the marijuana operations of the
cooperative.
The Ninth Circuit's ruling in effect authorizes
the operation of marijuana pharmacies outside the
safeguards and restrictions of the Act and undermines the
ability of the Act to protect the public from hazardous
drugs.
The common law defense of necessity can
sometimes authorize a person to violate the law in order
to avoid a more serious harm but it doesn't apply here for
three reasons. First, because the legislature has already
balanced the harms and come to a different conclusion.
Congress anticipated there would be claims of
medical uses for controlled substances and provided an
administrative procedure for evaluating them allowing
trial judges and juries to redetermine that balance in
individual cases would undermine the procedure established
by Congress.
Second, because the defense has no application
because the co-ops members and the co-op itself have
alternatives to violating the criminal law. They have
substantive alternatives, other lawful medications
including a synthetic form of the active ingredient of
marijuana.
QUESTION: May I ask one question on that
subject Ms. Underwood? You have a footnote in your brief,
footnote 11, that describes some of the situations there
that gives the impression that this whole case is a sham,
that it's really just a front for using marijuana and I'm
wondering if -- and your argument you're just making now
suggests there are always alternatives. Do you think we
should take the case on the assumption that there really
are some people for whom this is a medical necessity or
should we assume that there are no such people.
GENERAL UNDERWOOD: The -- on the assumption
that there are no such people because the Food and Drug
Administration charged with evaluating the medical -- the
scientific information and the DEA, that is the agency
that report to the Attorney General and the Secretary of
Health and Human Services having evaluated the claims of
medical use have found that there is no accepted medical
use, that some of the claims of medical use are simply
wrong.
QUESTION: General Underwood, may I just stop
you there because take one of the examples that was in the
brief, the one about the man who was constantly vomiting
and the only thing that calmed him down, he had a lymphoma
or something like that, that is not an uncommon experience
and what surprised me about this case was that that kind
of thing has been going on, individual doctor prescribing
marijuana just to prevent that kind of extreme suffering,
and that seemed to have gone without enforcement until
California passes this proposition and you get clinics
selling it, not individual doctor. Am I wrong in thinking
that there has been quite a bit of this going on in the
medical profession.
GENERAL UNDERWOOD: The record doesn't reflect
and I don't know how much of it has been going on. I
think there are two things to say in response to that
though, one is that the agencies charged with evaluating
the medical uses here have ongoing studies and have so far
concluded that there are -- that the particular use that
you're describing is best served -- there's now an extract
of marijuana that's been on the market -- been available
and been put on the lower schedule than schedule one for
15 or 16 years which is this Marinol and efforts are being
made to find other methods of administering the pure
substance and determining whether it has the effect that's
described.
QUESTION: Ms. Underwood, these judgments made
by the federal agencies, the FDA and the DEA, I think they
take into account the overall public interest, I mean,
they -- I'm not sure that they have come to the conclusion
that marijuana would never ever, ever be helpful to
someone who's in extreme pain. I think what they've
probably done is made the judgment that the chances of its
being that helpful and not being replaceable by something
else are so slim that in view of the abuses to which
general permission for its use would lead it's best that
it be proscribed, is that an inaccurate determination on
my part? Could you really say that there has been a
determination by the federal government that marijuana is
never medically useful.
GENERAL UNDERWOOD: Well the determination
that's been made is that the medical utility of it has not
been established which is a slightly different way of
putting it but there is a separate determination the FDA
makes determinations as it does with substances that
aren't on the controlled substances list, that is there
are new drugs that are proposed all the time which might
possibly be useful and aren't authorized for use until
after tests satisfy the FDA that the drug is safe and
effective for use and marijuana has not passed that
screen.
There is an additional screen for controlled
substances that is in addition to considering and the
scheduling decision takes into account not just medical
utility but also the potential for abuse, but the FDA's
role in it, the Health and Human Services role in it is
just to assess or it has a role in simply assessing the
medical evidence and has concluded that to date there is
insufficient reason to think that it is a safe and
effective drug although there are continuing research
projects going on to try and pursue the anecdotal
information that it is sometimes helpful or that
components of marijuana are sometimes helpful.
QUESTION: Ms. Underwood, it would help me,
General Underwood, if you would tell me why the word
preemption doesn't appear in the government's brief
because I took the simple-minded approach looking at this,
Congress says this is a schedule one drug and California
says you can have it if you've got a note from a doctor
that says you have a migraine headache. Why isn't the
federal law that says this is the schedule one drug
preemptive, it must have been with some thought that you
didn't use that word.
GENERAL UNDERWOOD: Well the California law
doesn't actually purport to authorize the distribution of
marijuana with a doctor's note, it provides a defense to
California law. Now it is true that an effort is being
made here to invoke the judgment behind that law as in
support of the claim of medical necessity, but California
didn't purport to create a defense to federal law as it
couldn't have if it had tried it would have been
presumably preemptive -- preempted. But it's perfectly
possible to comply with both California law and federal
law. There isn't that kind of conflict here.
QUESTION: Explain that to me because I thought
to comply with federal law you can't sell it.
GENERAL UNDERWOOD: Well that's right but
California law doesn't require you to sell it. It simply
says that you won't be -- California could remove the --
could eliminate --
QUESTION: All it says you'll be at the mercy of
the feds and we won't go after you.
GENERAL UNDERWOOD: That's correct. That's
correct. And I should say that the decision of the
federal agencies not to accept the kind of anecdotal
evidence that you're suggesting is a decision that the
federal -- the Food and Drug Administration has made again
not just in the controlled substance area but it has
concluded that the anecdotal reports of individuals are a
basis for research, a reason to conduct research and not a
basis for authorizing the use of a drug or changing its
scheduling.
QUESTION: General Underwood, there's some
indication in the trial court's observation, he had no
choice but to enter this injunction, that's something of
an over-reading, but suppose I were the district judge and
I said, you know, General Underwood, you want me to
basically supervise what's going to be a major effort to
prosecute people and you're doing this under my contempt
power, I don't want the court to get involved in this, you
have your own United States and assistant United States
attorneys, you have investigate these, bring these as
prosecutions and then we'll hear these cases and if
there's a necessity defense or something we can rule on
it, but you're basically asking me to issue an injunction
and in order to enforce it I'm going to have to make
prosecutorial decisions, I don't want to be bothered with
that because I think it intrudes upon a separation of
powers balance, it's making me more of a prosecutor than a
neutral judge. If he said that would he be abusing his
discretion.
GENERAL UNDERWOOD: Yes. There are grounds on
which a court can deny injunctive relief. For example, if
the court found that violations had stopped and are
unlikely to recur and an injunction wasn't necessary to
effectuate the purposes of the act, this Court noted that
in Hecht against Bowles, and there may be other grounds
but I would say that the judge who said what you just said
would be, in fact, intruding on Article II executive
prerogatives by insisting that when Congress has provided
both civil and criminal enforcement mechanisms as it often
does that the executive is not free to choose the
enforcement mechanism, the civil enforcement mechanism
that --
QUESTION: May I ask this question, does the
executive, the district attorney have prosecutorial
discretion not to bring a case if he thinks a particular
defendant really is a person that has this serious illness
and so forth.
GENERAL UNDERWOOD: There's always prosecutorial
discretion.
QUESTION: Why would a judge have less
discretion than a prosecutor?
GENERAL UNDERWOOD: The judge has different
discretion from a prosecutor, it is for the prosecutor to
decide whether a case merits prosecution or whether a
civil injunction is worth bringing.
QUESTION: If the judge reacts to precisely the
same reasons that motivate a prosecutor not to bring a
case, would that be an abuse of discretion?
GENERAL UNDERWOOD: Yes it would. The court's
role in the process is not the executive's role. The
court cannot deny an injunction on the grounds that the
executive should for instance have chosen the criminal
sanction or should not have brought the case at all. If
--
QUESTION: Suppose the judge has legitimate
concerns that given the resources of the court that it's
going to make him basically substitute for the United
States attorney in the Northern District of California,
he's going to have to decide who to prosecute for contempt
and it's going to be criminal contempt and so forth,
basically it seems to me that he's now being put in the
role of the supervising prosecutor just in order to
enforce his injunction.
GENERAL UNDERWOOD: Well no the contempt actions
of him would be brought by prosecutor and I'd like to
point out why civil --
QUESTION: I'm sure that he has or should have a
major say in how he's going to enforce his injunction, who
he's going to bring to court for the contempt action in
the first instance, what kind of examples he's going to
make, et cetera.
GENERAL UNDERWOOD: There's a reason why civil
injunctive enforcement is authorized and why it's
appropriate. I don't think it's for the court to
second-guess the prosecutor but there is a reason. The
civil injunctive remedy in this statute was patterned on a
similar provision in the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and
the purpose of that was to provide a way to resolve legal
disputes without the harshness of a criminal prosecution.
This is just that kind of dispute, open and ongoing
violations of the law designed to test its statute with
the California state law in the background, once --
there's no reason to think that once a court resolves the
question that -- holds, for instance, that there is no
medical necessity defense or holds that in any event
whatever medical necessity defense there might be doesn't
authorize the operations of marijuana pharmacies as in
this case, that the Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative
won't comply with the law.
QUESTION: Well, maybe it will, but isn't the
real concern, and I want to state a variant on Justice
Kennedy's question, isn't the real concern behind this
that with the passage of the California proposition and
the popularity within the California population that that
necessarily entails, it will be very, very difficult for
the government ever to get a criminal conviction in a jury
trial, and the reason, it seems to me, that the reason I
assumed this was being brought was to avoid hung juries in
criminal cases.
If the trial court in fact were to conclude that
that is the reason and that's why the injunctive remedy
was being invoked, would that be a good reason for the
court to say it is not certainly a necessary and maybe not
an appropriate use of equity to give the government an
alternative to six month or less sentences for criminal
contempt in order, in effect, to make a criminal statute
enforceable which in the normal criminal course is not.
Would that be an abuse of discretion?
GENERAL UNDERWOOD: Not if the statute
authorizes a civil injunctive remedy and -- but I would
like --
QUESTION: It would not be an abusive --
GENERAL UNDERWOOD: Excuse me. I misspoke.
That would not be --
QUESTION: You scared me there for a minute.
GENERAL UNDERWOOD: It would be an abuse of
discretion. It would not be an appropriate ground for
withholding injunctive relief but I would like to point
out that the statute, this statute, perhaps out of a
concern like that or perhaps for some other reason,
contains a jury trial requirement -- provides a jury trial
for a trial of the contempt of an injunction that is
obtained --
QUESTION: No matter what the lengths of
sentence requested?
GENERAL UNDERWOOD: Yes.
QUESTION: General Underwood, do you agree with
all of the premises of these questions? I mean is --
GENERAL UNDERWOOD: No.
QUESTION: Is it true that California juries
generally don't convict people of crimes that they don't
agree with? Is that the practice in -- I haven't lived in
California in quite a while but California juries only
enforce those criminal laws they like, is that the general
practice.
GENERAL UNDERWOOD: I have no information about
that but I would like to point --
QUESTION: Do we know whether this United States
attorney brought this as a civil -- as a civil matter
precisely because of the legal doubt or rather in order to
avoid a jury trial, do we have any idea which of the two
it is.
GENERAL UNDERWOOD: I was not -- I don't have
the answer to that question but I know --
QUESTION: And of course, this entire argument
would disappear if Congress eliminated the criminal
penalty and then presumably the U.S. attorney would be
free to get as many injunctions as he liked with the same
consequences.
GENERAL UNDERWOOD: I should think so. I would
just like to --
QUESTION: There's one aspect of this General
Underwood that Respondent says and this I think you might
know the answer to, Respondent says that overwhelmingly
this Act is enforced by a criminal prosecution rather than
civil injunction. And do you know that, what is the
enforcement practice with respect to the CSA.
GENERAL UNDERWOOD: I know that civil
injunctions have been used on other -- exactly on
occasions under this statute as well as under other
statutes where there is a business enterprise going on
that has a dispute with the government about whether what
they're doing is outside the statute. I don't think it's
--
QUESTION: Romero-Barcelo was a civil injunction
in connection with the EPA, wasn't it?
GENERAL UNDERWOOD: That's correct but -- and
under this statute in particular though the Controlled
Substances Act it is not customary to seek injunctions
against street dealers of narcotics but it is customary to
seek injunctions against, for instance, manufacturing
plants that are claiming that their use of particular
chemicals is -- what they're doing is within the Act or
without the Act, I mean, when there is essentially a
dispute with the business enterprise about the legality
and propriety of what they're doing and that is actually
not just under the Controlled Substances Act but under
many statutes, the kind of occasion when an injunction is
used to resolve the legal dispute on the assumption that
once that legal dispute is resolved it will not be
necessary to seek further enforcement but there will be --
QUESTION: Of course you can make the same
argument for bringing criminal prosecution, so presumably
you put somebody in jail, they'll stop doing it too.
GENERAL UNDERWOOD: Yes, but what Congress said
actually in authorizing injunctive relief is that when
there is this kind of dispute it is desirable to provide a
mechanism for resolving it without putting people at risk
of going to jail if -- and that's one --
QUESTION: You're referring to the legislative
history I presume, it doesn't say that in the statute,
does it?
GENERAL UNDERWOOD: No, it does not. I'm
referring to legislative history actually --
QUESTION: Some little piece of Congress said
that, right?
GENERAL UNDERWOOD: Well, I'm actually referring
to legislative history of the Food, Drug -- of the analog
provision in the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act simply to
suggest not that we know that that's what Congress voted
on but that that is a common widely-understood reason --
GENERAL UNDERWOOD: That is a common
widely-understood reason --
QUESTION: Yes but those are cases where there's
a legitimate difference of opinion on whether there was a
violation of law. Your view here that violation of law is
so obvious and clear that there isn't even any colorable
argument to the contrary.
GENERAL UNDERWOOD: That's our view but there is
a claim to the contrary and I don't think it requires that
we credit that claim to decide that an appropriate way to
resolve that dispute is in a civil enforcement action, and
that -- so that's the story about when we sometimes use
civil enforcement actions. Actually very often --
Respondent has suggested that it's hardly ever used
because there aren't reported opinions, the most common
occasion where civil enforcement actions are used they're
also settled. That is, the injunction -- the complaint is
filed and there's a civil settlement involving money and
agreements to change practices and make an agreement not
to deal in a particular drug, chemical for some period of
time. There are numerous examples of that.
QUESTION: What is the advantage the government
has from an injunction rather than a concerted effort of
discrete prosecutions by the United States attorney's
office?
GENERAL UNDERWOOD: For example, here, where we
are arguing where it is our position that there simply is
no medical-necessity defense at all and therefore that one
shouldn't be entertaining evidence and adjudicating the
appropriateness of a medical-necessity defense in a
particular case, the way to get that resolved systemically
is in a civil -- a civil proceeding that simply presents
that legal question.
QUESTION: Then you do want us to rule on the
issue that the Ninth Circuit -- you're ruling just as a
general matter that there's no medical-necessity defense.
GENERAL UNDERWOOD: It is a part of our argument
--
QUESTION: I'm concerned about using the courts
to answer questions so remote from specific disputes.
GENERAL UNDERWOOD: It isn't necessary to reach
that result but it is a part of our argument that the
reason the injunction -- the reason the Ninth Circuit was
wrong to suggest that the injunction might not issue or
might be limited that the court predicated that holding on
an error of law, I mean one -- there are many reasons why
a court might exercise its discretion but it is not a good
reason to exercise its discretion to rely on a mistake of
law and a mistaken view of the law and that mistake is
that the Controlled Substances Act authorizes,
contemplates or is consistent with a medical-necessity
defense.
QUESTION: Well, then you're very pleased with
what the Ninth Circuit did in one sense because now you
can get the issue resolved up here.
GENERAL UNDERWOOD: I would say that's the
result of what the Ninth Circuit --
QUESTION: But I just don't think that's a good
use of the federal district court's authority.
QUESTION: Out of evil cometh good, General
Underwood, isn't that wonderful.
GENERAL UNDERWOOD: Pardon me?
QUESTION: I just said out of evil cometh good
is your position on the Ninth Circuit.
GENERAL UNDERWOOD: Our initial position was not
that we wanted to bring this to the United States Supreme
Court but that the practice -- that the Oakland Cannabis
Buyers' Cooperative and similar cooperatives should be
enjoined from engaging in the open and notorious violation
of the Controlled Substances Act --
QUESTION: General Underwood, if you take it as
a criminal prosecution and it's an unsettled question of
law whether it is a medical-necessity defense, a typical
district trial judge is probably going to err on the side
of letting it in since you can't say one way or the other
and you may not get it resolved in a criminal prosecution.
GENERAL UNDERWOOD: That's correct.
QUESTION: General Underwood, what is the
penalty for violating an injunction?
GENERAL UNDERWOOD: The statute calls for
enforcement by contempt.
QUESTION: Would be criminal contempt?
GENERAL UNDERWOOD: Well there's a -- no, well,
there's a civil contempt in the statute.
QUESTION: What I'm getting to is would you be
entitled to a jury in the trial for contempt?
GENERAL UNDERWOOD: Yes, I said earlier the
defendant by statute is entitled to a jury.
QUESTION: Still it's civil so it wouldn't be
beyond a reasonable doubt, it would be I think it's clear
and convincing in this case; is that right?
GENERAL UNDERWOOD: It's not a criminal
proceeding it's a trial under Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure --
QUESTION: That would make a big difference to a
jury who doesn't want to convict this person. I mean, at
the end of the road there's a jury, which is going to let
you off if it wants to let you off, whatever the standard
of proof is so that if the U.S. attorney here were only
trying to avoid a jury, he ought to be replaced.
QUESTION: But the juries -- there can be a
criminal contempt proceeding if the injunction is violated
under the statute, correct? Something was said a minute
ago about its being just a civil jury. The U.S. attorney
could bring criminal contempt if someone violated it and I
thought your answer was under the statute even if it's
criminal contempt and the penalty would be -- the penalty
requested would be within the minor offense range, they'd
still get a jury trial and that was the answer to my
suggestion.
GENERAL UNDERWOOD: The statute's Section 882
says in case of an alleged violation of an injunction or a
restraining order issued under this Section, trial shall
upon demand of the accused be by a jury under the -- in
accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
That's what Congress contemplated and instructed.
QUESTION: I understood you before in answer to
the question about why the civil injunction to say that
you wouldn't do that with a street peddler but you want to
put this clinic out of business.
GENERAL UNDERWOOD: Want to stop it from
engaging in the unlawful distribution of marijuana, it
might have some other business, but I don't believe the
Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative at the moment is
engaged in other businesses, and as I've said, that's the
dispute that we have with the Oakland Cannabis Buyers'
Cooperative about whether what they're doing is lawful or
not is one that is ideally suited to resolution in a civil
-- in a civil litigation. I think I'll reserve the rest
of my time for rebuttal.
QUESTION: Very well General Underwood. Mr.
Uelmen, we'll hear from you.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GERALD F. UELMEN
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. UELMEN: Mr. Chief justice and may it please
the Court:
When the government initiated these proceedings,
it made a tactical choice to forego criminal prosecution
in favor of seeking injunctive relief pursuant to Section
882. That choice had serious consequences for the
Respondents because it deprived them of the full
opportunity to a jury trial.
QUESTION: Did your Respondents ask to be
prosecuted criminally, was that their preference?
MR. UELMEN: We had no choice in the matter,
Your Honor.
QUESTION: How did it deprive them, I mean, Ms.
Underwood's answer was they get a jury trial in any case.
MR. UELMEN: It's a jury trial in accordance
with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure which means that
the court can enter a summary judgment and the court does
not apply the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt
and that actually happened in this case.
QUESTION: You mean for a criminal contempt?
MR. UELMEN: For a civil contempt.
QUESTION: What about criminal?
MR. UELMEN: Well, they have not initiated a
criminal contempt prosecution. That would be a criminal
prosecution and we would have a right, full right to --
QUESTION: What's the sanction for finding of a
civil contempt violation? It can't be jail.
MR. UELMEN: No. I believe they could be fined.
QUESTION: In a civil contempt they say you have
the key to the jail in your own pocket because it's
enforced to cause to you do something, you can be jailed I
believe on civil contempt.
MR. UELMEN: If you refuse to --
QUESTION: Right.
MR. UELMEN: Yes, until you conform with the
order. And that happened here. I mean, these Respondents
were found in contempt of court without a jury trial.
QUESTION: Did they ask for a jury trial?
MR. UELMEN: Yes, but the court ruled that under
Section 882 the trial as conducted in accordance with the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Therefore a summary
judgment could be entered and the government succeeded in
obtaining a summary judgment.
QUESTION: And what was the penalty that was
being requested, was the penalty a fine or cumulative
incarceration?
MR. UELMEN: No fine was imposed.
QUESTION: What was requested when you went to
trial, did the government say, we forego any incarceration
as punishment we're going to ask for a fine as punishment,
did the government make any specification of that sort?
MR. UELMEN: No, the government asked that the
sheriff or the marshal seize the premises in which the
business was being operated and of course the Respondents
were at risk of incarceration if they remained in
contempt.
QUESTION: Well, that's just like a civil
nuisance action, it's just a nuisance action in the
federal court is all it amounts to.
MR. UELMEN: But the point is the defenses that
the Respondents wished to assert were never determined by
a jury.
QUESTION: But you're in effect saying that even
if it's purely civil contempt if they are found to
violated the injunction and they do not agree to abide by
the injunction in the future they can at least be jailed
coercively. Is that the point?
MR. UELMEN: Absolutely.
QUESTION: Okay.
MR. UELMEN: Yes. It would truly be ironic to
hold that federal prosecutors have full discretion to
decline prosecution but when they elect to come into a
federal court sitting as a court of equity, that court has
no discretion to decline to issue an injunction.
QUESTION: Just -- I take it that if I'm a trial
judge and I have someone who's violated my injunction, I
can't say, I'm going to put you in jail now until you sign
an agreement not to do this anymore. I can't do that.
It's a coercive action for something that's within the
power -- within your power to perform, to turnover some
goods, to unlock a locker to -- but that's not -- so there
can't be any -- there can't be incarceration --
MR. UELMEN: Clearly, you could incarcerate me
until I obey the court order. I mean, that's done all the
time with a witness who refuses to testify and is held in
contempt.
QUESTION: But these are all past acts, there's
nothing to incarcerate for or am I wrong? Am I missing
something, did the judge incarcerated these people? He
couldn't.
MR. UELMEN: He did not in this case because the
Respondents agreed to refrain from the conduct, the
contempt was purged ultimately, but if the -- if the
Respondents insisted on continuing their operation in
violation of the injunction, they could have been jailed.
QUESTION: Well, I disagree with that but we'll
leave it.
QUESTION: Right. I thought that this kind of
civil contempt where you have the key in your pocket is
only for the kind of contempt that's in the presence of
the court where you refuse to testify or disrupt
proceedings or something like that, I'm not sure that --
any way, we can look that up. Let me come to your
perception that it would be unthinkable that it could be
up to the U.S. attorney whether to bring a criminal action
or not, but a federal judge could not decide that he won't
issue an injunction using the same sort of discretion, why
is that so unthinkable? I mean, in a criminal case the
federal judge certainly can't say, you know, I don't think
this criminal case should have been brought at all.
MR. UELMEN: In a criminal case, Your Honor --
QUESTION: It's a stupid prosecution and I'm
going to ignore it. He can't do that, can he?
MR. UELMEN: In a criminal case a judge is
sitting as a court of law, what we're saying is when a
federal court is sitting as a court of equity it has the
traditional discretion to weigh the interests, to balance
the interests --
QUESTION: To say this civil action should not
have been brought, I disagree with the United States
attorney that this civil action which is authorized --
which he's authorized to bring under the statute should
have been brought and therefore I will nullify it, you
think a court has that power.
MR. UELMEN: What we're saying is that all the
statute says is if the court has jurisdiction to issue an
injunction surely they can come in and ask for an
injunction and we're saying the court has discretion to
say under these circumstances I'm not going to issue an
injunction.
QUESTION: What's your case authority for that
sort of a proposition because the cases you cite in your
brief strike me as quite far off the point, Hecht and
company and Romero-Barcelo. In those cases the person was
either in compliance by the time it got to court or else
the court said, look, I won't issue an injunction,
Romero-Barcelo, but you have to go get a permit. In no
case did the Court ever say well we think you've got a
defense to this act so we're not going to issue the
injunction.
MR. UELMEN: Well we believe that Hecht v.
Bowles and Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo are quite on point
because in both cases it was within contemplation that
future violations would occur and the Court still declined
to exercise its jurisdiction --
QUESTION: Because in one way it said, the
violations had been cured as promptly as they'd been
called the attention that Hecht's had put in a new staff
to try to do things. I mean, it's quite different from
your case where you say we're going to just go ahead and
do this.
MR. UELMEN: Well in Romero-Barcelo the Court,
in effect, said that the Navy can continue to drop its
bombs while it applies for a permit, so --
QUESTION: But there wasn't any failure to rule
on what the law is in both of those cases. The judge
adjudicated the case and said you did wrong, but I'm not
going to slap you with an injunction because in the Bowles
case it was inadvertent and I have ever reason to believe
you won't do it again. I didn't get from any of the cases
you cite authority that a judge would have to say, I'm
just not going to participate in the adjudication of this
case.
MR. UELMEN: Well, first of all, by declining to
enjoin, the court is not allowing the violations to
continue because the government still has the option of
initiating a criminal prosecution at any time and that's
--
QUESTION: It seems to me what happened here is
that it originally went to a federal district court judge
who granted an injunction and then it was appealed --
MR. UELMEN: That's correct.
QUESTION: -- at the Ninth Circuit and the Ninth
Circuit appeared at least to create some kind of a blanket
exception to the provisions of the Controlled Substances
Act and returned it to the district court which it
required to withdraw or to enter.
MR. UELMEN: What the Ninth Circuit held is that
the district court had discretion to allow this exemption
to the injunction for two reasons, first, because the
Respondents who came within this common law necessity
defense were not violating the Act so they should not be
enjoined because --
QUESTION: It was a kind of a blanket
medical-necessity defense that it recognized when I would
have thought that the initial trial judge did not abuse
his discretion at all and that the Ninth Circuit erred at
the point that it created this blanket defense.
MR. UELMEN: Well, it's not a blanket defense,
Your Honor, in is the sense that every Respondent who
wishes to take advantage of it is going to have to show
that they are suffering from a serious medical condition,
that they face imminent harm of death or blindness, that
cannabis will alleviate their condition and that they have
no reasonable alternative, that everybody alternative
available has been tried and found ineffective for them so
--
QUESTION: But the action is brought against the
clinic not against the individual sufferers, so you seem
to be putting together two things that don't mix, you're
saying that an individual might have a plea of medical
necessity, but the judge who is faced with a clinic that's
selling to all kinds of people, some of them don't fit
that description at all.
MR. UELMEN: Well, no, actually selling to
anyone other than the limited number of patients who come
within this exception is enjoined by the preliminary
injunction, all the court has done is to create a very
narrow exception for a very limited number of patients who
come within these four criteria.
QUESTION: It doesn't sound to me limited at
all, even with drugs that can be dispensed, doctors are
required, prescriptions are required, that wasn't any part
of this injunction as envisioned by the Ninth Circuit at
all.
MR. UELMEN: Well our contention is that --
QUESTION: Nonmedical people deciding the
so-called medical necessity. That's a huge rewriting of
the statute.
MR. UELMEN: Well, it's implicit in all of these
conditions that there is a medical decision being made.
That is, no patient qualifies under the California
initiative unless they have a physician's recommendation
or approval in meeting the criteria that all alternatives
have been tried and failed implicitly assumes some medical
supervision in that process. Our contention is that when
we come within this medical-necessity defense no
prescription is necessary. That we're dealing with highly
unusual circumstances that were not contemplated by
Congress when it required a prescription for the normal
use of any drug, when a physician issues a --
QUESTION: To say it wasn't contemplated by
Congress when Congress made a finding that there's no
known medical use for it doesn't make much sense, I think.
MR. UELMEN: Well, Your Honor, Congress never
made such a finding. They did not say there is no known
medical use for cannabis.
QUESTION: What is the definition of schedule
one in the Controlled Substances Act.
MR. UELMEN: The criteria for placement on
schedule one or movement off of schedule one when it's
done administratively by the DEA are set forth in Section
812 and those criteria do include no currently accepted
medical use, but Congress itself put cannabis on schedule
one, so it wasn't bound by those criteria.
QUESTION: But presumably if it did it itself,
it must have thought that it qualified for schedule one
under those criteria, it just didn't want to leave it up
to an administrative agency to make the decision.
MR. UELMEN: All it had to conclude in terms of
a rational basis test was that it wanted to impose the
most restrictive limitation and that is schedule one, no
use without a prescription, but we're saying even that
finding, that there's no use without a prescription, is
not a rejection that under limited circumstances where a
patient is facing imminent harm and has no reasonable
alternative, the drug cannot be used without a
prescription, it's a classic illustration of the
choice-of-evils defense.
QUESTION: If that's the case how could it be
that the patient wouldn't be able to get a prescription.
I mean, you're saying it's absolutely necessary for you to
stop the patient from dying or from vomiting or whatever.
MR. UELMEN: That's right.
QUESTION: There's not a doctor in California
who will say, you know, here I'll write you a
prescription.
MR. UELMEN: Not for cannabis, not for cannabis
because it is on schedule one, a physician cannot write a
prescription.
QUESTION: Okay, so it's not just a requirement
of a prescription that Congress is prescribing.
MR. UELMEN: Well, by putting it on schedule one
they're saying you can't -- you can't use it by
prescription, now when a doctor issues a prescription all
he's concluding is that this will help you, he's not
required to conclude that you have no other alternative.
He's not required to conclude you have a serious condition
and you may die or go blind if you don't have this
medicine, all he's got to say is, this will help you,
here's a prescription, go get it and take it. But the
medical-necessity defense requires much more. It requires
a conclusion that the patient is facing a serious medical
crisis.
QUESTION: Is there any other case in which this
Court has recognized the medical-necessity defense.
MR. UELMEN: Well, calling it medical necessity
--
QUESTION: Well, I asked you a question.
MR. UELMEN: No. Okay. But medical necessity
is just an example of the classic necessity defense
defined by the model penal code. In fact, one of the
examples --
QUESTION: That's based on common law, is it
not?
MR. UELMEN: Yes, it is.
QUESTION: What you have here is a statute that
Congress enacted that quite arguably simply ruled out the
sort of defense that you're urging.
MR. UELMEN: Well, Congress certainly didn't
explicitly rule it out. What the government is arguing is
that we can imply this limitation from the structure of
the Act and from its purpose, but a careful --
QUESTION: Or from its placement on schedule
one.
MR. UELMEN: Well, its placement on schedule one
involves this issue of currently accepted medical use
which is a term of art that does not address the question
of whether under particular circumstances of an individual
patient facing a medical crisis there might be medical
utility for the drug.
QUESTION: Do I understand you correctly Mr.
Uelmen from what you've argued about medical necessity,
the California initiative is essentially irrelevant
because you'd be making the same argument in any state; is
that correct.
MR. UELMEN: That is absolutely correct. This
defense should be available to any patient in any state
regardless of whether that state has approved under
broader conditions the general use of cannabis as
medication.
QUESTION: I guess would it be limited to
cannabis or would you have a similar exception to any of
the prohibitions.
MR. UELMEN: Well, if the conditions are met
that you face this imminent crisis and no other
alternative is available, yes, it should be available for
other medications as well.
QUESTION: It would be up to the individual who
wants it to take his chances and say I think there's
medical necessity and then try and prove that later --
MR. UELMEN: That's a risky venture because that
individual is going to have to prove in a court of law
that in fact he had -- he was facing this crisis and he
had no alternative.
QUESTION: Well, you know if he really thinks
he's going to die that's an easy gamble right, a jury
versus the grim reaper, I'll take the jury any day.
MR. UELMEN: Well, at least in the confines of
the modification of this injunction we're talking about
more than that, we're talking about a requirement that you
prove that you have tried all of the other alternatives
that might be available and they didn't help.
QUESTION: How serious does your medical
condition have to be? I mean, I gather cannabis is not a
life-saving drug. It alleviates great pain and
discomfort.
MR. UELMEN: Well, we believe it is a
life-saving drug. It's a life-saving drug for AIDS
patients who are not going to benefit from the new
medications available to keep them alive if they can't
keep their weight up, if they can't maintain their general
health.
QUESTION: So how serious -- how serious does a
case have to be before this medical-necessity defense
kicks in, in your view.
MR. UELMEN: Well, in the injunction we're
talking in terms of imminent harm, we believe that --
QUESTION: What sort of harm?
MR. UELMEN: Death, starvation, blindness.
QUESTION: Stomachache?
MR. UELMEN: No.
QUESTION: That's a harm, isn't it?
MR. UELMEN: We're talking about patients who
are going to lose their sight, who are going to forego
chemotherapy or radiation because they can't live with the
severe nausea.
QUESTION: You have to add some adjective to
just imminent harm, you want imminent life-threatening
harm, imminent what? You want to exclude a stomachache
and an earache maybe.
MR. UELMEN: No, I think we're talking about
much more serious harm, but we're talking about balancing
the choice of evils here.
QUESTION: Suppose Congress were to say we don't
want a medical -- we didn't -- we thought controlled
substance schedule one is prohibited. Now we're going to
make clear there's no medical-necessity defense then what
happens to your --
MR. UELMEN: Clearly Congress did not say that,
but if it did, we would contend that we then have a
serious constitutional problem in terms of a violation of
the substantive due process right to preserve your life,
then we can cite the Glucksberg case --
QUESTION: May I just ask you a question? I take
it there was no constitutional litigation below that
you're raising the constitutional issue here on the
constitutional avoidance rationale.
MR. UELMEN: Yes, the constitutional issue was
raised but in a different context.
QUESTION: Was it, I mean, did you put in
evidence on it or did you argue it or was it just one of
those things that you never got to?
MR. UELMEN: It was argued in the context of the
broader motion to dismiss, but with respect to the
medical-necessity issue that's before this Court, our
position is that if this statute is construed to preclude
a medical-necessity defense under these circumstances
where the patient faces loss of life or loss of sight
there would be a violation of a substantive due process
right --
QUESTION: Do you also raise the Commerce Clause
on constitutionality?
MR. UELMEN: We did, we did.
QUESTION: Did you press both of those in the
court of appeals when you were appealing from the original
junction.
MR. UELMEN: They were fully briefed in the
court of appeals in the context of the dismissal motion --
QUESTION: And the court of appeals didn't pass
on them I gather.
MR. UELMEN: No, they didn't, although they
didn't address it specifically in the context of the
medical-necessity defense.
QUESTION: But you're asking us to uphold that
this defense exists in broad general terms, it's a
sweeping proposition with no specific plaintiff in front
of us, with no specific symptoms or testimony from a
doctor as to this person, which --
MR. UELMEN: Well, it may be better.
QUESTION: Which led me to question that the
whole use of the injunctive power to begin with but so
long as we have the injunction, the statutory authority,
it seems to me you have to wait for a specific case to
raise this defense.
MR. UELMEN: Well, that's our position Justice
Kennedy that the availability of the medical-necessity
defense should await a criminal prosecution in which the
defense is asserted and evidence is presented and --
QUESTION: Well, but in the meantime it seems to
me that nuisance can be enjoined and if the defendant
wants to take his chances on a criminal contempt he can do
so.
MR. UELMEN: Well, our contention is that you
can decide this Court just based on the traditional
discretion that a court of equity has to allow this
exception to the injunction.
QUESTION: I think it was pointed out earlier
that the district court here whose discretion it is
originally granted the injunction just what the government
asked for, and it was the court of appeals who does not
have discretion which directed the district court to
exercise it in a different way.
MR. UELMEN: Well, the court of appeals was
saying that the district court misconceived the law when
the court was asked to modify the junction.
QUESTION: And what should we do if we decide
that the court of appeals misconceived the law? I mean,
what should we do with this case?
MR. UELMEN: Well, if you feel that the court of
appeals misconceived the law then of course you're going
to have to reverse the court of appeals, but our position
is the court of appeals was essentially correct on both
grounds, that the court does have discretion to decline to
enjoin and these -- this conduct doesn't violate the
statute because it comes within this medical necessity
defense.
QUESTION: Mr. Uelmen, let me talk about the
medical, I had understood medical-necessity defense, if it
existed, to be a defense on the part of the person who is
in medical necessity and who uses marijuana or any other
prohibited drug when he shouldn't. Now you would extend
this also to the person who provides it to any persons who
was in such needs.
MR. UELMEN: That's correct.
QUESTION: And you would extend it beyond that
to someone who opens up a business in order to provide
prohibited drugs to people who need them. That's a vast
expansion beyond any necessity defense that I've ever
heard of before.
MR. UELMEN: Well it's perfectly --
QUESTION: I've heard of necessity defense on
the part of defendant who used it or whatnot, but you're
saying by reason of a necessity defense you can open up a
business to provide for these necessities.
MR. UELMEN: If it's perfectly consistent with
the choice of evils concept of the necessity defense
because the person who provides the substance to the
patient is also faced with a choice of evils. The case of
United States versus Newcomb which we cite in our brief on
page 23 makes it very clear that this common law necessity
defense extends to the third-party provider as well.
QUESTION: Well, what choice of evils is the
provider faced with?
MR. UELMEN: Of letting someone die or violating
the law.
QUESTION: Well, of not being able to supply the
person. I mean it certainly isn't the provider's
responsibility to look after the individual.
MR. UELMEN: Well --
QUESTION: You say letting someone die.
MR. UELMEN: We're saying the necessity defense
permits or justifies this choice even by the provider as
well as the patient. Actually the choice of evils defense
as described in the model penal code offers this as an
example, a druggist may dispense a drug without the
requisite prescription to alleviate grave distress in an
emergency.
QUESTION: But is this is a regular druggist,
this is not a druggist who's in the business of providing
illegal drugs to people in necessity. I mean you're
making a business out of it. I can understand --
MR. UELMEN: It's a very limited business under
this injunction which can serve only patients who meet
these criteria, and I might point out it's a business in
which the government itself has been engaged. The
government provides cannabis at the present time to eight
patients who meet essentially the criteria of medical
necessity and --
QUESTION: I don't think your example from the
model penal code would envision a pharmacist filling a
prescription or filling an order for some drug that is on
schedule one which no prescription is good for.
MR. UELMEN: Well, we're saying the requirement
of a prescription is not a judgment with respect to the
availability of a necessity defense. Even a drug as to
which no prescription is permitted --
QUESTION: It's one thing to say that a state
law requiring a prescription for a bunch of drugs can be
violated in an emergency. It's another thing to say that
a schedule one law which says there's no useful medical
purpose for this drug shall be violated.
MR. UELMEN: Well the government's position
actually is that there is no necessity defense for any
drug under the Controlled Substances Act, and I think it's
very important that the court realize that the reason
we're here is because the government shut down the only
program that could accommodate these patients. For many
years they provided Cannabis and still do for eight
patients who come within this medical necessity criteria,
and they closed that program down in 1992 and they say in
their brief we can do it because we're the Federal
Government. You can't do it because you're a private
citizen.
Well, we're saying if you won't do it, we can do
it because the only justification you have to do it is the
same necessity defense that we're asserting and the way
the necessity defense works is if a patient comes in and
says I have to have this to live and the court says well,
the government has a program. They'll give it to you.
Therefore you have a reasonable alternative. You don't
have a necessity defense and that's exactly what happened
in United States versus Burton the sixth circuit case. A
patient with glaucoma comes into court, asserts a
necessity defense. The court says you have a reasonable
alternative and that patient then goes to the government
and they put him on the compassionate IND program and
provide him with cannabis. Well, now the government
decides we're not going to operate that program anymore
and we say if you're not going to do it then we can
because the only justification you had to do it was this
medical necessity concept.
There is no authorization within the Controlled
Substances Act for the government to give Cannabis as
medicine to patients and when this program was examined by
Congress, and I especially invite the Court to carefully
look at the hearings held by Congress on the therapeutic
uses of marijuana in schedule one drugs.
The way this program was explained to Congress
in 1980 was we are providing Cannabis for medical use by
these patients and the reason we're doing it is because of
compassion and because of the therapeutics. That was the
explanation given by Congress.
QUESTION: I thought it came out of a settlement
of a lawsuit.
MR. UELMEN: It came out of a settlement of a
lawsuit where the patient successfully asserted a medical
necessity defense and the federal authorities then stepped
in and said we will provide you with the Cannabis you need
to preserve your sight.
QUESTION: Successfully in what way did the
plaintiff get a judgment in that case? You said there was
a settlement.
MR. UELMEN: This was after he was acquitted he
brought a civil lawsuit and in settlement of that suit
this program was established.
QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Uelmen. General
Underwood, you have three minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA D. UNDERWOOD
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
GENERAL UNDERWOOD: A medical necessity defense
is foreclosed here not only by the fact that Congress
contemplated and rejected it and not only by the fact that
alternatives are available but also because any necessity
defense is a response to unusual and unforeseen
circumstances. It couldn't possibly, the common law
necessity defense couldn't possibly authorize an ongoing
enterprise designed to stand ready and provide supplies to
people who might show up with their own individual claims
of medical necessity.
There's no constitutional problem with the
statutory procedure for deciding when and if medical uses
for a drug exist where with -- and the court held in
Weinberger against Hynson that it's perfectly appropriate
for the FDA to reject anecdotal evidence and insist on
controlled studies. There's also no problem with
protecting sick people from charlatans or unsafe and
ineffective drugs as this Court held in Rutherford in
dealing with Laetrile the claim that there was a right to
use Laetrile.
Respondents in this case have never presented
their claims, the claims they're making here, to the FDA.
They've never sought review of the classification of
marijuana in schedule one, they've never sought access to,
at least so far as the record reflects, to the clinical
trials that are ongoing right now to deal with synthetic
manufacture of components of marijuana, and on the remedy
for contempt at the petition appendix at 25 A and again at
37 A it's perfectly clear that the government was not
seeking fines or incarceration, that the judge wasn't
contemplating fines or incarceration but just evicting and
padlocking, closing down this business.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you General
Underwood. The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 12:04 a.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.)
