BLATT\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMS. BLATT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThere are three reasons why section 340B\nentities do not have a cause of ation to enforce the\npharmaceutical pricing agreement between the Secretary\nand manufacturers.\nThe first reason is that this common law\nbreach of contract suit is indistinguishable from an\nimplied right of action to enforce the statute, a right\nRespondent concedes it does not have.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't understand that.\nA private contract is just that. Two parties go into\nthe contract. They set the terms of their deal. No one\nforced the manufacturers to enter into this deal. So\nwhy isn't the issue exactly what the circuit court said:\nWhat was the intent of the parties to the contract? You\nwant to make it Congress's intent, but this is a private\ndeal between you. And Congress may have specified some\nterms to include, but -\nMS. BLATT: Yes. And the -- what is being\nchallenged here is the contractual term that\nincorporates in haec verba the manufacturer's ceiling\nprice obligations under the Act, and a third-party\nbeneficiary's suit to enforce the contract asserts the\nsame right, seeks the same remedy, and causes all the\nsame disruptions as a right of action to enforce the\nstatute.\nAnd another way of saying that is, if the\ncase begins with the premise that Congress foreclosed\n340B entities from bringing an implied right of action\nthrough the front door, Congress did not leave the back\ndoor open to essentially the same suit.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How do you answer the\npoint that, if Congress wanted to make this a pure\nregulatory statute, it wouldn't have even required a\ncontract? It would have just passed a statute that says\nanyone who wants to -- to sell to the -- to the States\nor to the 340B entities -- you can't charge more than\nthis price.\nWhy do we even need a contract, unless\ninherent with it is some discretion in the agency who's\nadministering it?\nMS. BLATT: Right. Well -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Discretion that is\nconsistent with normal contract principles.\nMS. BLATT: Right. Well, our position is\nobviously that the parties had no discretion to confer\nArticle III power on courts to enforce an Act of\nCongress, and this is. But the -- the basic answer is\nthat there has always been a huge difference between the\nsettled rule that parties to a statutory contract are\nenforceable -- they have a cause of action to enforce\nthe contract, because Congress spoke with unambiguously\nclear language that the parties could sue. That's the\nway statutory contracts must work. They must be\nenforceable.\nBut your answer, sort of as a practical\nmatter, what's the difference, is this is a -- this is a\ncontract, and we do think that the Federal law of\ncontracts and contractual remedies flow between the\nparties to the contract. It's a bilateral agreement,\nit's not a regulation, and the Secretary made specific\nenforceable promises. And there's obviously no even\noperation of the statutory mandate without the contract.\nBut the reverse, in terms of the -- the\nlong-settled rule that parties must be able to sue to\nenforce a contract, there's an equally settled rule that\nbeneficiaries under a statute do not have the right to\nenforce it unless there's a cause of action.\nNow, the test that I think Respondent\nadvocates and that the Ninth Circuit applied is a test\nthis Court has long since discarded, which is: Well,\nI'm a beneficiary, and this is a good idea, and this is\nsensible. Even if you don't buy our test of you have to\nimply the implied right of action, these lawsuits are\nneither sensible nor a good idea and not what Congress\nintended. And here's why.\nAnd it is basically the second and third\nreasons. So no matter how you come at this case and the\nlens through which you look at this, I think everyone\nshould come out to the same place, which is that neither\nCongress nor the Secretary nor the manufacturers signed\nup to what is in essence -- would be over 14,000\nlawsuits against 500 manufacturers challenging the\npricing for over 35,000 medications under Medicaid.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Your adversary claims\nyou gave up your argument that the contract doesn't make\nthe manufacturers a third-party intended beneficiary.\nHave you given up that argument?\nMS. BLATT: No. I think that the -- that\nthe whole thrust of the petition -- and obviously the\nprimary argument is that this flouts the implied right\nof action jurisprudence and it -- it conflicts with\ncongressional intent in all events. But one of the\nharms, and sort of illustrating just how bad the\ndecision was, is this conferred rights that the parties\nnever imagined and that the Secretary did not -- did not\nintend.\nBut I -- I think that, in our view, even if\nthe Secretary had wanted to, it's not the Secretary's\ndecision nor was it the manufacturers' decision to go\ncontract by contract and say this multi-billion dollar\nhealth care program that incorporates another, even\nbigger multi-billion dollar health care program -- we're\ngoing to turn this over to Federal enforcement, when on\nthe face of the statute reflects a deliberate decision\nby Congress to withhold -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Private enforcement.\nMS. BLATT: Private enforcement -- to\nwithhold a private remedy in favor of 340B entities and,\ninstead, channel exclusive authority to the Secretary to\nenforce it. And those three specifics, in addition to\nthe disruption, are that Congress gave manufacturers,\nbut not 340B entities, a private reimbursement remedy\nand a private -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is it -- I'm not\nsure of the answer, but is it different in this case or\nunusual that the agreement is between the Federal\nGovernment and private entities, as opposed to what I\nthink is the more typical situation in which these cases\ncome up, where it's, say, an agreement between the\nFederal Government and a State?\nMS. BLATT: Well, all your Medicaid cases,\nobviously, under State plans -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.\nMS. BLATT: -- and a lot of your implied\nright of action jurisprudence is dealing with Spending\nClause legislation as to State entities. But there are\na number, a number -- the Rehabilitation Act, the\nDavis-Bacon Act, and a fair number of health care\nprograms -- where the government contracts with private\nparties as a public welfare mechanism to get to what I\nthink are conceded are beneficiaries.\nHere, there's a number of beneficiaries.\nIt's not just the 340B entities. It's the patient\npopulation that's being served and, obviously, the\nFederal fisc. So -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Blatt, would you\nexplain the function that the contract mechanism serves?\nI mean, you could just have this -- you could just have\nthe statute say: Thou shalt not charge more than the\nceiling price. Period.\nWhat -- what is accomplished by having the\ncontract reflecting the terms of the statute?\nMS. BLATT: Well, I don't think it's any\ndifferent than Mobil Oil or Jackson Transit, where\nCongress wants to specify the terms of the contract, and\nthe contract incorporates in haec verba the statutory\nterms. And if there's a breach of that, there are\ncontractual remedies that flow.\nBut I agree with you that there's not a\nwhole lot difference between our position and the\nGovernment, because the Government is absolutely correct\nthat it's in haec verba and identical, and the statutory\nobligation that we're talking about that's incorporated\ninto the contract is that a certain ceiling price must\nbe charged.\nBut the -- the other sort of practical\nfunction is only manufacturers who enter into this\ncontract are subject to these price controls. So if\nthey -- a pharmaceutical manufacturer doesn't want to\nparticipate in the program, they're not covered.\nAnd in a typical regulation and I think\ngeneral sort of Spending Clause analysis, someone who\naccepts Federal funding has considered sort of implicit\nconsent to the funding obligations because they're\ntaking the money. But here's there's an express\nmanifestation both by the Secretary who signed the\nagreement and the contractors, the pharmaceutical\ncompanies who signed the agreement.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Before the statute was\namended by I think the Patient Protection Act and there\nwas a breach of the agreement, did the government assess\npenalties?\nMS. BLATT: Well -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Because -- and the reason\nI'm asking this is that you indicate that the government\nhad a contract remedy. It seemed to me it had a\nregulatory remedy.\nMS. BLATT: It has got a lot of remedies.\nIt has -- but it -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What was the contract\nremedy that it had at the time this case arose, which\nwas before the -- these mechanisms.\nMS. BLATT: Yes. They're -- right. We are\nstill -- today is no different than yesterday, because\nnothing has happened to implement the 2010 health care\nreform except that there are now more civil monetary\npenalties than there were.\nBut the government has statutory penalties,\ncivil monetary penalties, a right of audit. It can\nbring suits under the False Claims Act and can terminate\nboth this agreement and the Medicaid rebate agreement.\nBut as a -- the government has contractual\nremedies, too. I mean, why Congress, I think -- a\nsensible inference for why Congress picked contracts is\nthat this is -- this piggybacks off the Medicaid rebate\nprogram, and that uses contracts. And that instead -\nthat in turn, rather, used contracts because the States\nhad negotiated rebate agreements with drug companies way\nbefore 1990. And so Congress continued the contract\nfeature.\nAnd then, since the pricing components under\nthis program are the same pricing components under the\nMedicaid rebate program, both programs are parallel and\nthat both use agreement, one is the Medicaid rebate\nagreement. In this case, it's the pharmaceutical -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Blatt, you said that\nthere's not a whole lot of difference between your\nposition and the Government's. What is the difference\nbetween your position and the Government's?\nMS. BLATT: Well, the Government says a\ncontract is not a contract even though it says it's a\ncontract. Our position is this a contract.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That doesn't make much\nsense, does it?\nMS. BLATT: The -- the Government sees this,\nI think, as just a unilateral -- that the manufacturers\nwalked in and said we're here and happy to be bound.\nBut the agreement on its face says the Secretary makes\nthe following agreement; the Secretary promises this.\nThe most important promise the Secretary\nmade to manufacturers is that the Secretary said that\nshe would not terminate the agreement without good\ncause, 60 days' notice, and certain conduct that the\nmanufacturer did would not constitute grounds for\ntermination.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What did the manufacturer\npromise in exchange for a contract? You do need\nconsideration. What did they promise that they weren't\nalready obliged to do by law?\nMS. BLATT: Well, the billions and billions\nin price discounts they were not obliged to do unless\nthey -- they signed the contract. But the contract goes\nthrough a ton of manufacturer responsibilities. The\nmanufacturer -- if the Secretary thinks that there is\nreimbursement that's owed, the Secretary can order\nreimbursement, and the manufacturer has -- it's a -\nit's a pretty substantial -\nJUSTICE BREYER: So what is Santa Clara\nCounty supposed do? They -- they think they're being\novercharged. And in your opinion, they -- the company\ndoesn't, but they do. So what are they supposed to do\nif they're right? How do they get the money?\nMS. BLATT: Well, the way they have been\ngetting the money, and for better or worse until 2010,\nthey have been at the mercy of the vastly larger\nMedicaid rebate program, which is run on behalf of the\nStates. And because this program is so small compared\nto that program, all the enforcement activity, which is\nall the False Claims Act settlements that Respondent\ncites in his brief, that's how, as a practical matter,\nit's been enforced.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm interested in\nprocedurally what are they supposed to do?\nMS. BLATT: Oh, pick up the phone and either\ncall the manufacturer, the prime vendor -\nJUSTICE BREYER: The manufacturer says:\nOkay, you're wrong. I'm not; I'm undercharging you.\nNow what happens.\nMS. BLATT: Ultimately, if they can't get\nthe Secretary to -\nJUSTICE BREYER: He's busy.\nMS. BLATT: If she's busy and won't return\nthe calls, Congress said you can't enforce it -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, Why can't they -- can\nthey, for example, file a claim with the -- with the\nSecretary and say we would like the Secretary to order\nthem to give us the money; they're violating this? They\ngo to an administrative law judge. Is there an\nadministrative remedy of some kind that would be\nreviewable in the courts for reasonableness?\nMS. BLATT: There's just -- right now,\nthere's just an informal, non-mandatory -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So why is it\nreasonable, then, to think that the Secretary would have\nentered into a contract which is going to benefit them\nand there's no remedy?\nMS. BLATT: Because the statute itself said:\nWe're going to go out of our way to give manufacturers\nremedies, make this confidential; manufacturers have\nrights of audit, but 340B entities don't. The Secretary\n-- here's a vast arsenal of things at your disposal, and\nit's channeled through that regulatory regime.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But normally under the law\nfrom Marbury v. Madison onward, where there's a wrong,\nthere's a remedy.\nMS. BLATT: But -\nJUSTICE BREYER: And the remedy could be\nadministrative, could be judicial, et cetera. But\nyou're saying there's none?\nMS. BLATT: No. I think 30 years have said\nthat we're not going down that road. I mean, in\nGonzaga, there was a breach of the statutory provision,\nand students presumably are harmed when private\ninformation gets disclosed. But every private right of\naction case where you've said no, the argument has\nbeen -\nJUSTICE BREYER: But in such cases, there\nvery often is an administrative remedy -\nMS. BLATT: That's true.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- and the person always -\nany individual in the United States can go ask any\nagency to do anything, and there is even review in\ninstances of a refusal to withhold -- a withholding of\naction.\nMS. BLATT: There's always an APA action\nagainst the Secretary. I just think -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is there here? You said\nthere was.\nMS. BLATT: Well, I think it would be hard\nto bring an APA action.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about a False\nClaims Act action?\nMS. BLATT: Yes. Yes. And False Claims\nActs are brought. There's a lot of them, and there's a\nmultitude of settlements that are outlined in the\nbriefs.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, to the extent that\nyou're objecting to the disruption of the Secretary,\nthere is disruption when it's a private party bringing a\nFalse Claims Act.\nMS. BLATT: Well, it's not a private party.\nIt's the private party who's assigned the claim. I\nmean, the case is brought in the name of, and it is a\ncase by the United States. And that's significant\nbecause the United States has complete and total control\nover that case. Here, the problem -- it's bad enough -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Even if the United States\ndoesn't take over the case, just lets the qui tam\nrelator -\nMS. BLATT: Right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- proceed?\nMS. BLATT: Yes, that's right. It's still\nbrought in the name of the United States with heightened\npleading requirements, and they actually have to allege\na knowing false statement.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You -- you emphasize\nthat the contract has the language in haec verba of the\nstatute. What if -- what if it doesn't?\nThe statute imposes certain provisions. The\npricing I guess is the key one. But in a private deal,\nwhen you're arranging for the delivery of, you know,\npharmaceuticals, you could have a lot of provisions.\nIt's got to be delivered by this much. You've got to\nhave this much inventory. You've got to -- whatever.\nI mean, what if the contract here included\nterms beyond those in the statute? Could those be\nenforced by the third-party beneficiaries?\nMS. BLATT: Yes. And there is -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes?\nMS. BLATT: If it's not enforced in the\nstatute -- only if -- and I think it's significant that\nplaintiffs always lose under a third-party beneficiary\nbecause the bar is so high. The government always\nenters into contracts on behalf of somebody, and the\ngovernment rarely intends to confer enforceable rights,\nand the parties rarely do it.\nBut if you had an express provision outside\nthe statute that said we intend to confer enforceable\nrights on third parties, and it's not an enforcement of\nthe statute at all, then all your jurisprudence for\ndetermining congressional intent aren't being subverted\nand aren't being undermined.\nI could give you an example. I mean, it\ncould be anywhere from something just completely outside\nthe statute. Together, the pharmaceutical companies\ncould say we hereby agree to make a contribution every\nyear to the clinic or hospital for a holiday gift. That\nwould be an odd contract. I don't see the Secretary\nentering into third-party beneficiary contracts. A much\nmore efficient way would just be to contract with the\nentity itself.\nBut I think this is just another way of\nsaying that a lot of the energy and breath in the court\nof appeals would be saved in going through why the\ncommon law doesn't confer it because congressional\nintent, by and large, is going to line up with the\nSecretary, the party's intent.\nBut when you're talking in haec verba, and\nthis could not be more precise because it's the exact -\nit's actually not even 340B. The allegation is it's a\nviolation of the Medicaid Rebate Act pricing reporting\nrequirements. It's -- congressional intent is all that\nmatters.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is this a contract with the\nSecretary or a contract with the United States executed\non behalf of the United States by the Secretary?\nMS. BLATT: It is a contract executed by\nHRSA, the administrator of -- an agency within, and he\nor she, whoever the administrator is at the time, enters\nit on behalf of the Secretary. So the -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: On behalf of the -\nMS. BLATT: So it's in the name of the\nSecretary.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's in the name of the\nSecretary?\nMS. BLATT: It says -- I mean, it's in the\nPet. App. starting at around 169. It says the\nSecretary. And you don't have the signature page, but\nI've seen them. They're all signed by the administrator\nof HRSA, which is the -- the organization within HHS,\nnot CMS but HHS, that runs the 340B program. But if I\ncould -- actually, I'll just save the remainder for\nrebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMs. Anders.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GINGER D. ANDERS\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMS. ANDERS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe pharmaceutical pricing agreement should\nnot be construed to permit 340B entities to bring suit\nto enforce drug manufacturers' price reporting\nrequirements for two reasons: First, the PPA is not an\nordinary contract, and it does not transform the 340B\nprogram from a regulatory scheme into a contractual one.\nLike a Medicare provider -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is it -- is it a\ncontract at all?\nMS. ANDERS: It's not an ordinary contract\nin that it doesn't give rise to contract rights in\nthe -- in the regulated entities. This is very similar\nto Medicare provider agreements, in which a health care\nprovider who wants to enter into the Medicare program\nand provide services agrees -- signs an agreement in\nwhich he agrees to abide by the statutes and regulations\nset forth in the Medicare program and, in return for\nthat agreement, is given the opportunity to participate\nin the Medicaid -- in the Medicare program.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, how do we distinguish\nbetween what you call an ordinary contract and this sort\nof a contract, if it's any kind of contract?\nMS. ANDERS: Well, I think when the statute\ndirects an agency to enter into an agreement for the\nsole purpose of memorializing the parties' opt-in to the\nregulatory scheme and directs -- directs what the terms\nshall be, so here provides statutorily what the\nreporting requirements will be, that's when the\ncontract is simply a regulatory mechanism.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, are you telling\nme you're taking -- then your -- then your co-counsel is\nright; you're agreeing with her totally. If Congress\nwrote the statute, said these are the terms we want to\ngive you in a contract, you figure out how to implement\nand enforce this, and the Secretary says I don't have\nthe resources to enforce this, I'm going to write a\ncontract that gives the 340B entities a private cause of\naction, the manufacturers can take it or leave it -\nyou're taking the position that the Secretary is without\nauthority to do this?\nMS. ANDERS: I think it would be a difficult\nquestion. I think it would be a difficult argument to\nsay that the Secretary was completely without authority.\nI think what has happened here is the Secretary has\nreasonably interpreted the statute in providing for an\nagreement between the Secretary and the manufacturers to\nsimply mark the opt-in.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that begs the\nquestion that Justice Alito asked you, which is: If we\ngo your route, which is, is this a regulatory or some\nsort of other contract, how do we tell the difference,\nand do we need to go that far? Isn't your position -- I\nthought half of your -- other half of your position was\nthat this is not a third-party intended beneficiary.\nAll the terms of the contract are between\nthe manufacturer and the Secretary and the obligations\nto the Secretary, not the obligations to the third\nparties.\nMS. ANDERS: That's exactly right. I\nthink -- to take the first part of your question, I\nthink the Court can tell when this is a regulatory\ncontract when the statute itself simply directs the\nagency to enter into an agreement that -- that contains\nthe terms that are set forth in the statute. And when\nyou look at the statutory scheme as a whole, it is a\nregulatory scheme.\nThe government is not acting as a\ncontracting party here. It's acting as a regulator. It\nhas the authority to impose administrative penalties\nwhich would be reviewed under the APA. There's no\ntransaction that's taking place with the government.\nThe only rules governing the conduct are statutory. So\nthat's why we think you can tell that this is not an\nordinary contract. It's a regulatory one.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is there a different -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You mean -- you mean\nthere's no negotiated element to it? It's what the\nstatute -- it's the same as Ms. Blatt said? It's -- the\ncontract repeats the words, the terms of the statute,\nand that's it; is that what you mean?\nMS. ANDERS: That's right. This isn't a\nnegotiated agreement. The Secretary has simply repeated\nthe terms of the statute in the agreement. That's\nexactly right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You could do this, I\nguess, by regulation, right?\nMS. ANDERS: I think that would be one way.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Issue a regulation\nsaying manufacturers who participate in this program\nagree to do, you know, whatever your contract says.\nMS. ANDERS: I think that would be one way\nto do it, yes. Throughout this area, though, Congress\nhas often used agreements to mark entry into the\nregulatory scheme, including in the Medicare provider\narea, where you do have these agreements with health\ncare providers. But it would be very odd, then, to say\nthat the -- the entire area is regulated by breach of\ncontract law rather than by the, you know, hundreds of\npages of regulations and statutory provisions that\ngovern the providers' rights there.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Could you tell us whether\nyou agree with the Petitioner's argument in part D of\nits brief that private suits would seriously disrupt the\ncomprehensive statutory scheme, in light of the position\nthat the Government has taken in other litigation\ninvolving actions brought by States, In re\nPharmaceutical Industry Average Wholesale Price\nLitigation in the District of Massachusetts?\nMS. ANDERS: We do agree with the\nPetitioners that -- that permitting third-party\nbeneficiary suits here, if you construe this as a\ncontract, would interfere with the government's ability\nto administer the statutory scheme. This is a national\npricing scheme that's put together by the Medicaid\nRebate Act, which has -- which is heavily regulated.\nAllowing 14,000 covered entities to bring individual\nsuits in different courts without HHS consultation,\nwithout the benefit of the government's input, could\nlead to substantial dis-uniformity despite the fact that\nthese are supposed to be national prices.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're walking away from\nyour position in the District of Massachusetts? The\nStates do not have, according to you, the right to\nenforce the rebate program?\nMS. ANDERS: No. That's actually an\nimportant point. I think in the Medicaid context the\nStates have a cooperative relationship with the Federal\nGovernment. And so they receive some of these funds\ndirectly, and they have -- in fact, in the Medicaid Act,\nit is contemplated that they have their own enforcement\nresponsibilities. So when States bring State law fraud\nsuits, State law FCA suits, they actually -- they\nconsult intensively with HHS. And so, in that respect,\nthose suits represent the government's -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: An implied cause of\naction? Is that what you're saying those State suits\nare?\nMS. ANDERS: Those are actually State law\nsuits that were involved in the Average Wholesale\nPrice -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How is that regulatory\nscheme any different than the one involving the PPA?\nMS. ANDERS: Well, the Medicaid Act itself\ngives States an enforcement responsibility and says that\nthey are to use their efforts to find fraud and the\nprosecute it. And so States actually have a whole body\nof State law, State law false claims act -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Suppose that the State of\nCalifornia says we'd like our counties to be able to\nenforce this. Then what happens?\nMS. ANDERS: Under the Medicaid Act, there\nwould be -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, suppose that\nCalifornia -- if California wants to say we could bring\nthis suit like Massachusetts did, you agree they could.\nAnd then they say, all right, but we don't have the\ntime; we want the counties to do it. Couldn't they do\nthat?\nMS. ANDERS: Well, we think it's very\ndifferent when you have covered entities -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, what's the difference\nbetween -\nMS. ANDERS: -- bringing even a fraud suit.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What's the difference\nbetween a State doing it itself through its attorney\ngeneral and the State saying we'd like the county to do\nit through its county attorney?\nMS. ANDERS: Well, there's consultation with\nthe Federal Government at the front end when the State\n-- when the State brings a suit. And so the government\nhas a chance to coordinate, to avoid dis-uniformity.\nBut when you have covered entities, you know, thousands\nof them, potentially bringing suit in different -\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. California\ncomes to you tomorrow and says the attorney general\nsays: You know, this is a problem. You don't have time\nto enforce this. There should be some enforcement, and\nwe want to enforce it. And, moreover, we'd like each\ncounty affected to enforce it.\nDo you have the authority? Is there any\nreason you wouldn't say go ahead?\nMS. ANDERS: Well, in that sort of\nsituation, you might be able to have a State law fraud\nsuit -\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm trying to analogize it\nto the Massachusetts one. You say they can just go\nahead and do it, and they say, you know, Santa Clara\nCounty is just as big as Rhode Island. And you say the\nAG of Rhode Island can bring the suit; am I right? And\nso why can't the -- why can't Santa Clara do it?\nMS. ANDERS: Well, in the covered entity\ncontext, the concern is that, because you have so many\nof them, if you -- if you start permitting covered\nentities to bring suit, you know, this is essentially a\npre-emption question, but you then have 50 different\nState regimes, State court regimes, put onto -- grafted\nonto, the Medicaid rebate requirements.\nThis is supposed to be a uniform pricing\nscheme. And so once the requirements become\ndis-uniform, it becomes very difficult for HHS to\nadminister the scheme in the way that it's supposed to.\nI think it's also important to point out\nthat the recently enacted Affordable Care Act will\nprovide the exclusive administrative remedy for claims\nexactly like Respondent's once HHS puts that into\neffect. So Congress, in looking at the scheme, to the\nextent it had concerns about enforcement by covered\nentities -- the way it reacted was not to create a\nprivate right of action or provide for breach of\ncontract enforcement but was simply to give the agency\nenhanced authority in order to adjudicate the claims\nitself.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It identified the\nproblem that the individual beneficiaries did not have a\nremedy? They -- or that courts had indicated that they\ndidn't and they thought there should be a remedy?\nMS. ANDERS: There were -- there were OIG\nreports raising concerns with oversight and enforcement\nat a general level, and the way Congress reacted to that\nwas to put in place this administrative remedy which\nwill allow covered entities to bring these claims and\nwill allow HHS to have the first opportunity to\ndetermine the meaning of the AMP and best price\nrequirements, and to take into account -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Blatt said nothing\nhas been done. It just went into effect on January 1st,\nbut are there -- are there plans to implement it?\nMS. ANDERS: Yes. The agency is moving\nahead with that. The agency has already issued an\nadvanced notice of proposed rulemaking back in the fall.\nAnd it has solicited comments about how the -- the\nadministrative scheme should look. That comment period\nhas closed, and so now the agency is in the process\nof -- of moving forward with the regulatory -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So I understand your\nposition clearly, in a regulatory contract situation\nlike this one the Secretary is without authority to\ndecide he or she can't enforce the statute and to confer\nexpressly by contract third-party beneficiary rights to\nthe -- to the people receiving the benefit? That's the\nposition you're taking?\nIf the Secretary had written a provision\ninto this contract telling 340B entities you can sue,\nthat would have been, according to you, ultra vires?\nMS. ANDERS: I think it would be difficult\nto say that the agency would have been totally without\nauthority to do that. It's not a question you have to\nanswer here, because I think the PPA clearly shouldn't\nbe construed to confer third-party beneficiary rights\nbecause that would be inconsistent with the statutory\nscheme.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Frederick.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. FREDERICK: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice.\nI'd like to start with Ms. Blatt's answer to\nyour question about whether a provision of the agreement\nhere could confer third-party beneficiary rights. She\nsaid yes, so long as the wording wasn't specifically\nprescribed by Congress. In so doing, she concedes that\nthis is a contract, that normal rules of contract law\napply, that the fact that the Secretary has entered into\nthe contract is of no moment, and that third-party\nbeneficiary rights are an inherent part of normal\ncontract principles.\nSo now we're left with the question, does it\nmatter that Congress wrote the particular words that the\nSecretary used in the agreement?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, wait. Is the -\nMR. FREDERICK: We submit that the answer is\nno.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Third-party beneficiary\nrights are part of normal contracts, but the third-party\nbeneficiary has rights under -- under the normal\ncontract only when the parties intend him to have\nrights. It's not that every -- every contract which -\nwhich has a benefit for some person allows that person\nto sue. There has to be an intent. And I -- I have\ntrouble finding that intent here, either on the -- on\nthe part of the Secretary -- would the Secretary have\nhad that intent when -- when Congress clearly did -- did\nnot have the intent to allow private individuals to sue?\nMR. FREDERICK: Justice Scalia, you find the\nintent in part II(a) of the agreement, which is set\nforth in the petition appendix. And in part II(a), the\nmanufacturer who agrees voluntarily to enter into this\nagreement agrees that the entity -- that the entity will\nbe charged only a set ceiling price.\nThat is a voluntary agreement of a duty by\nthe manufacturer that runs to the third-party\nbeneficiary covered entities -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, you didn't -- you\ndidn't hear my question.\nMR. FREDERICK: -- who are specified in the\nagreement.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: My question was the mere\nfact that there's a duty to a third party in the normal\ncontract does not give that third party the right to\nsue, only if the contracting parties intend the\nthird-party beneficiary to have a right to sue.\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, that's not the\nstandard, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I thought the -\nMR. FREDERICK: The standard for a\nthird-party beneficiary, as set forth in the Restatement\nand as recognized by this Court, is whether or not the\nparties objectively intended to create intended\nthird-party beneficiaries whose right to bring the suit\nwould enforce the contract. And that's precisely what\nwe have here.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Frederick -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can you tell me where -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- I thought when this\ncase went back to the -- to the district court, the -\nthe agency's position was this is a total surprise to\nus, 14,000 suits or whatever it is. No, we never -- we\nnever envisioned making the individual whatever you call\nthem -- the 430B -\nMR. FREDERICK: The 340B entities.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: We never envisioned\nmaking them the beneficiaries and -- and allowing them\nto sue. That would be quite disruptive of our program.\nThat, I thought, was the position the Government took.\nMR. FREDERICK: The Government cannot argue\nfor subjective intent of an agreement written 18 years\nago. This Court's decisions in contract have always\nheld that the objective intent as expressed by the words\nof the contract are what courts are to construe.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- I don't\nunderstand why what Justice Scalia said isn't the same\nas what you said. You said no, Justice Scalia,\nRestatement of Contracts. But what he said the question\nis whether or not did the parties intend -- and it's an\nobjective intent -- to confer these rights on a third\nperson. And -- and you said no, no, that's not it. But\nthen it seems to me that your answer that you gave was\njust what Justice Scalia said. I -- I missed something.\nMR. FREDERICK: Okay. Here's what I think I\nmisunderstood perhaps from Justice Scalia's question.\nFor third-party beneficiary rights to create an\nenforceable breach of contract claim, the parties to the\ncontract do not have to have a provision in the contract\nsaying \"and therefore the intended third parties get to\nbring a breach of contract claim.\" That's never been\nthe accepted law.\nThe law has always said if the parties\nintend to create third-party beneficiaries and bringing\nof that suit to enforce the contract would be within the\nobjective intent of the parties, such a suit is\npermissible.\nNow, I want to caution that what is\ndifferent about this suit from the kinds of implied\nrights of action suits that the drug companies here\nclaim to be so disruptive is that all we're arguing for\nis the bargain that the manufacturers agreed to\nundertake.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Could that be -- could there\nbe -\nMR. FREDERICK: That bargain was -- was the\ndiscount. It's the delta between what the counties paid\nand what they should have paid under the discount\nprogram ceiling price arrangement in the plain terms of\nthe agreement.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, could there be -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Third-party -- I'm\nsorry.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Could there be a\nthird-party -- a suit by an intended beneficiary and a\npurported intended beneficiary, if it is clear that\nCongress intended, to the extent it can intend\nsomething, for those beneficiaries to get the benefit of\nthe price but did not intend for them to be able to sue?\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So if there were -\nMR. FREDERICK: I think indirectly here,\nJustice Alito, that the patients here certainly are\nincidental beneficiaries, insofar as those who can't\nafford to pay for the drugs get them for free at the\ncounty's expense. This is county money that we're\ntalking about here. Or if they have some limited\ninsurance, they're able to get the drugs at a discount.\nSo they are certainly incidental\nbeneficiaries, but because they are not named and\nbecause the intent of the program is to provide the 340B\nentities with discounted drugs so they can extend scarce\ndollars farther, they have no right to sue.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If there were a provision in\nthe law saying expressly there is no private right of\naction under this statute, would you be able to make the\nsame argument?\nMR. FREDERICK: No. Our argument rests on\nthe silence of contract with respect to how enforcement\nwould concur. It has long been the case, though, that\nwhere the parties intend to displace a third-party\nbeneficiary's rights, the objective intent of the -- of\nthe agreement is what is understood.\nJUSTICE ALITO: There's -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel -- I'm sorry. I\ndon't understand the distinction that you're ignoring in\nthe law. I thought it was very clear that proof that\nyou merely received the benefit in a -- by a contract is\nnot proof that the parties intended to confer on you an\nenforceable right; is that correct? Is that the\nstatement of the common law?\nMR. FREDERICK: That is how the Restatement\nframes it. It's a -- it is a difficult line I think\nsometimes to understand the difference between an\nintended beneficiary and an incidental beneficiary.\nCertainly, the manufacturers here are incidental\nbeneficiaries -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No matter how -\nMR. FREDERICK: -- because they have access\nto this market.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No matter how you want\nto draw this line, if the issue is what's the objective\nintent about enforceability, if I look at the PPA, it\nmakes the manufacturer's obligation one-way to the\ngovernment to provide the pricing information. It gives\nonly the government the right to institute the informal\ndispute resolution system that the contract specifies.\nThis is not the new law. This is the PPA as it existed\nat the time. It gives only the Secretary other\nenforcement rights.\nWhat am I missing? Where in the contract is\nthere one provision, one sentence, one anything that\nrequires the manufacturers, other than the price\nbenefit, to do something that could be characterized as\nenforcement?\nMR. FREDERICK: But that is the key,\nJustice Sotomayor. The price discount is where all the\naction is in this program. These prices, between 1990\nand 1992, were being raised by the drug manufacturers as\nagainst these entities, and the whole point of Congress\nenacting this statute was to confer the same discounted\ndrug program to the covered entities as had been done\nthrough contracts to the State Medicaid rebate program.\nAnd that's why the provision in the\namendment -- sorry, in the agreement that says thou\nshalt not charge the covered entities more than the\nceiling price is exactly where you find the intended\nthird-party beneficiary rights, because that's their\nmoney that's being spent. It's not Federal -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's true -- that's\ntrue, you know, of -- I was thinking maximum resale\nprice maintenance. You could -- the distributor and the\nmanufacturer agree on the maximum resale price. Pretty\nunlikely that they intend the consumers who are intended\nto benefit to be able to have a lawsuit. And I think,\nwell, gee, I don't know. And what the Government is\narguing is, sure, the point you make favors you, but\nthey say there are two major points here that favor them\nabout background. I want to hear what your reply is.\nOne of them is Congress, in the statute that\nit incorporated here, didn't want a private person to be\nable to enforce it. And the second one is it's going to\ncreate a mess. All right? So they say those are two\nbackground features here that favor them.\nSo what's your response?\nMR. FREDERICK: Number one, there's no\nevidence that Congress intended there to be a departure\nfrom normal operating contract principles, and this\nCourt, in Winstar, in Mobil Oil, in Jackson Transit, in\nCentral Airlines -- all said that when Congress uses\ncontracts or agreements, it intends to incorporate the\nfull cluster of the common law rights as they've\nexisted. And third-party beneficiary rights have been\nrecognized for 350 years, even before the founding of\nthis republic.\nNow, as to the disruption, I think it's a\ncanard, because what we're talking about here is one\nprice that would govern all 14,500 covered entities. So\nif Santa Clara gets the discount price for Lipitor, say,\nthat is the best price, and it will be charged and\nchargeable to all of the 340B entities across the\nnation.\nSo in terms of administrability, one suit\nactually can solve the deficiencies in the government\nenforcement program, and the government can participate\nin this suit.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, which way does\nthat cut? That seems to me to put an awful lot of power\nand authority in the hands of one beneficiary and one\nlawyer saying -- all they have to do is filing a suit\nsaying, look, we get a hundred doses of Lipitor from\nthis program; we think we should get less.\nAnd if they win, the whole country's -- the\npricing of Lipitor under this program has changed.\nMR. FREDERICK: Well -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That strikes me as\nan argument in favor of leaving the enforcement with the\nSecretary.\nMR. FREDERICK: No, I think it's an argument\nthat may misunderstand some of the benefits that class\naction practice can provide, where there is a uniform\nway of analyzing the problem, because these prices,\nMr. Chief Justice -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It doesn't have to\nbe a class action, does it?\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, it doesn't. This was\nbrought as one for the efficiency purpose of obtaining\nexactly the effect that you are identifying, which\nis that if it is more efficient -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's why it was\nbrought as a class action?\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, it was brought as a\nclass action because the County of Santa Clara stands in\nexactly the same position as the other 57 counties of\nCalifornia and the other counties in the United States\nwho are overpaying for drugs that the manufacturers\nare -\nJUSTICE BREYER: What do you think\nabout -- is the -- I'm not sure I'm right at all here,\nbut as I understand the development of this argument\ntoday, it's open to you and the other 57 counties to go\nto the State AG, and you say you bring the lawsuit,\nokay? Or make us -- make me -- the lawyer says make me\nan assistant AG for this purpose. And I launch the\nlawsuit in the name of California, and then I can get to\nthe same place.\nWhat do you think of that?\nMR. FREDERICK: I don't know that the\nState -- because these are entities that are not defined\nin the agreement. The -- this is a different agreement\nthan under the Medicaid rebate agreement, which is set\nforth in the joint appendix, where the States are the\nthird-party beneficiaries of those agreements.\nI'm not sure that the State actually has\nstanding to bring these particular claims. That is not\nsomething that has been tested. But what I would say is\nthat if you reject our argument here, you are\nsubstantially undercutting the ability of the States to\nbring the same kinds of overcharging claims against drug\nmanufacturers under the Medicaid rebate program.\nThat's what the States' amicus brief here\nmakes clear. The SG has a very fuzzy footnote at the\nvery end of the Government's brief that does not set\nforth a clear standard that differentiates why 340B\nentities' third-party beneficiary rights are any\ndifferent from States' rights under the Medicaid rebate\nprogram.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought it was because\nthe States have been given a role in the statute itself,\nwhere the 340B entities have not. I thought that was\nthe -- the Government's position, that the States have a\nrole in the Medicaid program, and that's an entirely\ndifferent thing than this program, where these entities\nhave no statutory role, say the drug manufacturers and\nthen HHS.\nMR. FREDERICK: Justice Ginsburg, I don't\nthink that was the basis for Judge Saris's opinion in\nthe District of Massachusetts, which looked at the\nthird-party beneficiary theory of the States in giving\nthem a place at the table in bringing these kinds of\nclaims. And to the extent that that analysis bears out\nanything, it tends to cast doubt on the Government's\ntheory that these are somehow regulatory contracts that\nsuggest a blurring of the normal lines between\nregulation and contract.\nThat theory, the regulatory contract theory,\nhas been rejected by this Court in Winstar and in Mobil\nOil, where the Government tried to argue that because it\nwas implementing regulatory policy through contracts,\nsomehow normal contract principles don't apply, and this\nCourt rejected that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But the Government's\nfootnote doesn't -- doesn't rely on the contract. It\nsays that -- and it wasn't purporting to say the basis\nthat the court applied in the District of Massachusetts\ncase, but it was explaining why, in the Government's\nview, it's a different situation.\nAnd what it said, it's a different\nsituation, not because of a different contract, but\nbecause in that other situation, Medicaid -- the\nMedicaid rebate -- Medicaid generally is, quote, \"a\ncooperative Federal-State program.\"\nI mean, their point is that the States are\nexplicitly given authority for enforcement in that.\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, the -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And here the entities\nyou're representing are not.\nMR. FREDERICK: Justice Scalia, and that is\nwhy resort to the normal canons of construction that\nthis Court has long applied to government contracts is\nwhat is most pertinent here. The Government, I don't\nthink, can point to a specific provision of the\ncooperative federalism that empowers States to engage in\nany greater enforcement power than a normal third-party\nbeneficiary under this Court's normal cases, and back to\nCentral Airlines and American Surety, which, a hundred\nyears ago, recognized a third-party beneficiary's right\nto bring suit on a breach of contract and held that the\nabsence of a specific enforcement power in the statute\nwas not enough to deny the normal operation of law for\nthe breached party to sue for that breach.\nThat's common in the law.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The big -- the big\ndifference, it seems to me, Mr. Frederick, is that the\nStates are sovereign. They can enforce their own laws.\nThe entities at issue here are not sovereigns. They're\nnot enforcing their own laws. They are trying to\nenforce Federal law. But under the -- under the\nMedicaid program, the States, using their own fraud -\nfraud actions, whatever else, have a role to play.\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, Justice Scalia, I\nthink if you took that argument to its logical extreme,\nyou would have come to a different answer in the Arthur\nAndersen case, where, there, you recognized a\nthird-party beneficiary's right to invoke a statute to\nget an arbitration agreement upheld.\nAnd I think you would have come to a\ndifferent result in the Miree v. DeKalb County case, in\nwhich the Court said that just because there is an FAA\ncontract with a local airport authority does not deny a\nthird-party beneficiary right to sue if there is an\nadverse effect on adjoining land because you would have\nsaid that, because the adjoining land owner had no\nspecific enforcement authority, that person or entity\nwould be out of luck. I think the -- this Court's -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's Miree.\nThat's 1977. And a lot of your argument, it seems to\nme, is in the earlier world of implied right of action\njurisprudence that has changed dramatically in the last\n30 years.\nAnd what concerns me is when you are talking\nabout the same language, the mere fact that the\ngovernment has decided to go through a contractual\nmechanism to advance this program doesn't allow you to\nuse that to get an end run around all of the implied\nright of action jurisprudence of the last 30 years.\nYou're on stronger ground before that.\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, let me address that\ndirectly, Mr. Chief Justice, because Justice Rehnquist,\nwho was not any fan of implied rights of action, was the\nauthor for the Court's opinion in the Miree decision.\nAnd -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that was\npretty well -- that analysis was certainly consistent\nwith the established jurisprudence in this area then.\nBut it started changing very quickly thereafter -- I\nthink about 1980 -- and then consistently went in the\nother direction, to the point now where I think the\njurisprudence is pretty clear that we're not going to\nimply a private right of action at all.\nMR. FREDERICK: We're not asking you to\nimply a private right of action, Mr. Chief Justice.\nWe're asking you to honor contract principles that have\nlong -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The result is the same,\nMr. Frederick. And that's -- I mean, it was a central\npoint in this last brief. You can call it whatever you\nwant. It's -- Congress has not provided for a private\nright of action to enforce the terms of the statute.\nThe contract embodies the terms of statute. So it would\nbe passing strange if Congress, as we now read Congress,\nsaid we want private parties out of this; this is to be\nbetween the agency and the manufacturer to say. The\nsame exact result. The same aim can be achieved through\nthis third-party beneficiary route. And I think that\nsaid, that is the -- I mean, that is what stands out\nabout this case.\nAnd so how do you respond to that? What's\nthe difference between suing because the statute has\nbeen violated and suing because the contract has been\nviolated?\nMR. FREDERICK: A contract is a voluntary\nagreement entered into between the drug manufacturer and\nthe Secretary. The manufacturer can choose not to\nparticipate.\nSo in every one of the implied right of\naction cases that you have dealt with, a -- an outside\nentity has been forced to comply with a statute or law.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the statute wouldn't\napply to someone who doesn't want to be in the program.\nMR. FREDERICK: But the -- Justice Ginsburg,\nthose cases all involve the imposition of duties on the\npart of an entity or actor out in society.\nHere we're talking about voluntary action.\nThe drug manufacturers can decide not to participate and\nnot sign the agreement.\nAnd they have the right, under the\nprovisions allowing termination, to terminate the\nagreement at will with no reason whatsoever. But -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But so do the -\nit's the same situation with the States under Spending\nClause legislation. They don't have to sign up, but if\nthey do, then the issue is, is there an implied right of\naction on the beneficiaries? And our cases for the last\n25, 30 years have said no.\nMR. FREDERICK: But the remedy is different,\nMr. Chief Justice. And that is a key difference. All\nwe're talking about here as a remedy is the difference\nbetween what they promised to charge and what they\nactually charged. The remedies -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But we're told that\nwhatever you say -- that's all we're talking about. We\nare told that computing the price is a very intricate\nbusiness and that many of these disputes have been about\nwhat is -- what should the ceiling price be.\nMR. FREDERICK: There -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There would not -- the\nceiling price is out there, and there's no dispute about\nit. It's just a question of getting the manufacturers\nto charge that price and not a higher price. The\nquestion is: What is the ceiling price?\nMR. FREDERICK: And there are two ways to\ncalculate it. Under the more complicated formula that\nis designed to enhance the profits of the drug\ncompanies, it is a more complicated endeavor.\nAll of these cases, Justice Ginsburg, all of\nthem, have been with the simple formula, which is has\nthe drug company given its best price to some other\npurchaser in the market. That's where the False Claims\nAct cases that they acknowledge do not create such an\nintrusion into the program that somehow they can't be\nbrought -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's -- and then\nthey have control over them. And they don't have\ncontrol over these suits.\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, no, the difference in\na qui tam case, as your question earlier to my colleague\nearlier acknowledged, Justice Ginsburg, is the\ngovernment doesn't have to intervene in a False Claims\nAct case.\nWhat's different there is that there has to\nbe some inside whistleblower who can pass through the\nvery difficult hurdles of a False Claims Act case;\nwhereas here we're talking about benefit of the bargain.\nThe manufacturers agreed by contract they were only\ngoing to charge a ceiling price, and we assert, based\non, you know, quite extensive reports by officers of\nInspectorate General that they have not been charging\nthat price. They've been charging in excess of that\nprice, and all we're asking for is the delta.\nAnd the Government in its Massachusetts\nsubmissions has acknowledged that this type of best\nprice litigation is not so complicated because all one\nneeds to do is figure out did the drug companies sell\nthe particular drug to some other entity for a lower\nprice; and if that's so, that's the price you apply\nacross the board to all the 340B entities.\nThe argument about distraction and\nintrusion, Justice Ginsburg, I would respectfully\nsubmit, is a gross overstatement of what actually\nhappens in this type of litigation. And to the extent\nthat there are complexities, the complexities are\nintroduced by the drug companies for the sole purpose of\nmasking what price they are charging to the 340B\nentities. Because all these various mechanisms, the\nbundling of drugs, the use of kickbacks and payments to\npurchasers are all designed to mask what the true price\nof the drug is.\nAnd if Congress intended anything in the\nprogram, and in getting the Secretary to implement this\nprogram through statutes, it was that the 340B entities\nwho are providing drugs and medical service to the\npoorest of our citizens should be entitled to the\nbenefits of the collective market created by these 340B\ndrug purchases. And that's all that we're asking for\nhere.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you take the position\nthat nothing has changed as a result of the new\nlegislation? That is, Ms. Anders told us that this\nstatute is going into -- to become effective. There's\ngoing to be procedures, better procedures than there\nwere before. Is there still this third-party\nbeneficiary suit, despite the possibility of going to\nthe agency?\nMR. FREDERICK: We don't know, Justice\nGinsburg, is the simple and plainest answer I can give\nyou. And the reason we don't know is because the\nSecretary has already missed the first statutory\ndeadline for issuing implementing regulations.\nThere was no statement of rules in the\nnotice of proposed rulemaking, as is ordinarily the case\nfor agencies. The Secretary simply put out for comment\nthat we are going to develop procedures and rules. So\nwe don't know whether or not the Secretary will express\nsome further intent as to how these new rules are to\napply.\nBut I would submit that this Court's cases\nare very clear, that a later enactment of Congress is\nnot intent of what an earlier Congress has stated, and\nthe absence of any specific remedial provision coupled\nwith the use of agreements carries with it the ordinary\npresumption that Congress intended for that cluster of\ncommon law rights to be associated with the agreement.\nAnd that's certainly been the way this Court\nhas enforced contracts involving the government itself.\nIf there are no further questions, we'll\nsubmit.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nFrederick.\nMs. Blatt, you have 3 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMS. BLATT: Yes. If I could just talk about\nthe drug companies, Lipitor, and the common law. And if\nyou want, I can also talk about States.\nWe take, obviously, deep umbrage at the\nsuggestion that the drug companies are somehow against\nthese clinics. Any Internet search will show you that\nthe amount of discounts given under this program equals\nthe amount of free drugs that are given to these same\nclinics.\nAnd I'd also -- probably even a better\nresponse is you can look at any rebate release issued by\nthe Secretary of HHS or any page of their CFR, and if\nyou think it's simple, I would be shocked.\nOn Lipitor, it's not the case that the\nCentral District of California decides nationwide what\nthe price of Lipitor is. The -- under the other side's\nview, the Southern District of Texas, the Northern\nDistrict of New York, and the District in Alabama would\nall decide.\nAnd what's really bad -- it is bad enough to\nhave 14,000 suits over 35,000 drugs, but what he's\ntalking about, best price and average manufacturer price\nthat determines the State rebate program -- because the\nrebate program is a rebate, and the ceiling price\nprogram is a ceiling price, when one of the pricing\ncomponents goes up, such as average manufacturer price,\nthe States benefit. They get more money. But,\ngenerally, 340B entities -- their ceiling price goes up.\nSo what's good for the 340B company -- or entity is bad\nfor the States.\nAnd that's not disputed. He just says it's\nhypothetical. But he's asked for millions and millions\nand millions and millions and more millions of\ntransactions that go to that very pricing component.\nCommon law. On pages 9 to 11a of the\npetition appendix is a good three or four citations to\nthe third-party beneficiary Federal common law. And the\ncourts go out of their way to say it's not enough to be\na direct beneficiary. The analysis is exactly the same\nunder implied right of action. Is there clear and\nunambiguous intent to confer enforceable rights? It's\nthe same.\nWe just think because it's in haec verba\nwith the statute, it's congressional intent that's\ncontrolling, not the parties.\nI could talk about States if you want.\nOtherwise, I'm happy to just ask for the decision to be\nreversed.\nAll right. Then we would ask that the\ndecision be reversed.\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nCounsel.\n"
