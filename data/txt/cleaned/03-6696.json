        "content": "CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument\nfirst this morning in number 03-6696, Yaser Esam\nHamdi vs. Donald Rumsfeld. Mr. Dunham.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK W. DUNHAM, JR.\nON BEHALF OF PEITIONERS\nMR. DUNHAM: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nPetitioner Hamdi is a citizen who has been\nheld over two years in the United States with no\nopportunity to be heard as to the facts on which his\ndetention is based. Mr. Hamdi makes two claims.\nFirst, the Fourth Circuit wrongly prevented Hamdi in\nthis habeas proceeding from being heard as to the\nfacts of the case on grounds that allowing him to be\nheard would interfere with executive power.\nSecond, that the Fourth Circuit erred in\nfinding even on the one-sided record that's before\nthis Court that his detention is authorized by law.\nThe historical core of habeas corpus is to challenge\nextrajudicial executive detention. It cannot be a\nviolation of the separation of powers for an Article\nIII court to perform its judicial function of inquiry\ninto long-term, indefinite detention of a citizen in\na habeas corpus proceeding.\nQuoting from INS v. St. Cyr, at its\nhistorical core, the writ of habeas corpus has served\nas a means of reviewing the legality of executive\ndetention and it is in that context that its\nprotections have been strongest.\nQUESTION: Do we have precedents for\napplying the writ in wartime situations to enemy\ncombatants?\nMR. DUNHAM: For aliens, yes. And in\nQuirin --\nQUESTION: But for a citizen who turns out\nto be an enemy combatant?\nMR. DUNHAM: There are two --\nQUESTION: What precedents do we look to?\nMR. DUNHAM: There are only two precedents\nthat I'm aware of, Justice O'Connor. The first is\nthe treatment of the American citizen saboteur spy in\nEx parte Quirin, and the other is Mr. Territo, in In\nre Territo, which was a Ninth Circuit case. It is\nnot a case coming out of this Court.\nIn our view, first off, in Territo, the ,\n-- he was not an enemy combatant. He was called a\nprisoner of war in that case, but in Territo, there\nwas a full hearing by the district judge. Territo\nwas claiming that he was not a prisoner of war, that\nhe was forced to serve. That he was an American\ncitizen. That he had a right to have it determined\nthat he was not a voluntary combatant.\nQUESTION: That's not the complaint, or\nthe allegation here, is it?\nMR. DUNHAM: The allegation here is that,\nas I understand it, is that Mr. Hamdi is an enemy\ncombatant, whatever that means. We don't find it\ndefined in any case. We don't find it defined in any\nstatute, and it hasn't been defined by regulation or\nby anything that's been filed in this case.\nQUESTION: Well, it's an English word. It\nmeans somebody who is combatting.\nMR. DUNHAM: That's correct.\nQUESTION: I assume it means someone who\nis -- has taken up arms against the armed forces of\nthe United States. Isn't that -- really, do we have\nto quibble about that word?\nMR. DUNHAM: No. I mean, in its ordinary\nsense, Your Honor, you're absolutely right. And\nthat's what we would take it to mean. We would give\nit --\nQUESTION: Well, if the Government's\nright, he is an unlawful belligerent, I take it, if\nthe Government's right.\nMR. DUNHAM: Well, the Government hasn't\nclaimed in this, on the record in this case, which is\nlimited to the Mobbs Declaration, it doesn't say\nanywhere in the Mobbs Declaration that Mr. Hamdi is\nan unlawful combatant. The Fourth Circuit in this\ncase limited the district court's consideration to\nthat, to that affidavit, and said he could consider\nnothing else.\nNow, there is nothing in that declaration\nthat says that Mr. Hamdi was an unlawful combatant.\nAnd getting back to Justice Scalia's point, we do\naccord the words enemy combatant their ordinary\nEnglish meaning because we have nothing else to tie\nourselves to, and those words mean an enemy is -- an\nenemy is a member of a hostile power or force. And a\ncombatant is one taking part in combat.\nQUESTION: Well, it certainly is possible\nthat a U.S. citizen could end up fighting for the\nenemy in a war against our country. That's possible.\nMR. DUNHAM: That's happened.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nQUESTION: Happening.\nQUESTION: And so when that individual is\ncaptured then, by our country, the question is, to\nwhat extent does the habeas statute apply, and if it\ndoes, are the proceedings limited in some way?\nBecause of that status of being an enemy combatant?\nMR. DUNHAM: Well, Your Honor, I believe\nthat the -- his status is the thing that is the\nsubject of the habeas proceeding. I mean, if you\nstart from the premise that he is fighting against\nour country, that's one thing. But what we are\nsaying here is that that fact is in dispute, and that\nwe ought to --\nQUESTION: But you could say the same\nthing about, about noncitizen combatants. I mean,\nanyone captured in a war could say, you got the wrong\nman. I, in fact, was not taking up arms against the\nUnited States, and I insist upon a judicial\nproceeding to let me make that point.\nNow, you surely wouldn't allow every\ncaptured enemy in a war to go through a habeas\nproceeding because he wants to challenge the fact,\nwould you?\nMR. DUNHAM: Your Honor --\nQUESTION: Or would you? I don't know.\nMR. DUNHAM: No. I wouldn't allow every\nperson captured to go through a habeas proceeding,\nbut there is a different legal status of a U.S.\ncitizen from an enemy alien captured on a\nbattlefield. They have a different status.\nQUESTION: Well, I'm still not clear what\nyou do with Justice O'Connor's question and it's\nbasically the Quirin case. You are a citizen but you\nare an enemy combatant and you are captured. Are\nyour rights any different from that of a noncitizen\nin the same status? You haven't answered that.\nMR. DUNHAM: Well, yes. First off, in\nQuirin, we have to start with the premise that the\nQuirin proceeding was authorized by Congress. They\nwere proceeding --\nQUESTION: I'm asking you to distinguish\nbetween citizen and noncitizen in the hypothetical\ncase where each are combatants against the United\nStates and are captured. Any difference?\nMR. DUNHAM: Not in the Quirin case. No,\nYour Honor.\nQUESTION: Any difference in your view and\nunder your theory of the case that you're presenting\nhere?\nMR. DUNHAM: Yes.\nQUESTION: And what is that difference?\nMR. DUNHAM: That difference is that\nMr. Hamdi is a citizen. He is not entitled to\nbelligerent immunity. He is subject to prosecution\nunder our laws if he was, in fact, participating in\ntaking up arms against our forces. But that begs the\nquestion.\nQUESTION: You mentioned, you mentioned in\nconnection with Quirin that there was a statute, and\nI think one -- one of the defendants was alleged to\nbe a U.S. citizen. So I thought you were making what\n-- were there regimes in prior wars for entertaining\nthe claims of people who said, I was an innocent\nbystander, I was indeed captured by the enemy. In\nVietnam and World War II, were there means to\nentertain the claims of people who said, I wasn't an\nenemy?\nMR. DUNHAM: There were regimes then and\nthere are regimes now, but they haven't been used by\nthe military here. There are outstanding military\nregulations that provide for a hearing for someone\ncaptured on the battlefield to determine their status\nif there is any doubt as to their status.\nQUESTION: Would those military\nproceedings satisfy your claim? Your point is that\nHamdi has not had a chance to be heard on his claim\nthat this was a dreadful mistake, I wasn't an enemy.\nMR. DUNHAM: Those proceedings would go a\nlong way towards satisfying the process part of our\nclaim, Your Honor, but they don't really address the\nauthorization part of our claim, which we have two\nclaims here really.\nThe first is that he has never been -- had\nan opportunity to give, to assert a claim of\ninnocence. And those regulations, if they had been\nfollowed in this case, would certainly have given him\nthat opportunity. And then if he filed a habeas\ncorpus petition which would be his right, the\ndistrict judge would have had a record of a hearing\nlike he does on a -- on reviewing a state criminal\nconviction.\nQUESTION: But I don't think any\nproceeding, Mr. Dunham, conducted by the military at\nthis stage, is going to reveal much that's factual.\nHow are you going to get people, you know, if he was\nseized on the battlefield, what evidence are you\ngoing to get now from the, from those people who\nprobably don't even remember it? If the military\naccorded some process at that time, as I understand\nthey said they did, surely that is more reliable than\nanything that would come up now two years later.\nMR. DUNHAM: Your Honor, they did not\nprovide any process as contemplated by their\nregulations. In fact, the district judge offered to\nlet the military take this man and give him one of\nthose hearings. The very hearings their own\nregulations specify.\nQUESTION: What would you expect the\nmilitary to do? As I understand it, he wasn't even\ncaptured by our own forces. He was captured by\nallied forces and turned over to our forces.\nMR. DUNHAM: Well, that's certainly,\ncertainly part of the problem, Your Honor. We have a\nstrong --\nQUESTION: Well, you want them to run down\nthe members of the Afghan allies who captured this\nman and get them to testify in a proceeding? It's\njust putting unreasonable demands upon, upon a war\nsituation. I just --\nMR. DUNHAM: Your Honor, I don't -- my\nview is that it can never be an unreasonable demand\nto comply with habeas corpus and the Fifth Amendment.\nQUESTION: That is the question --\nQUESTION: Are you claiming --\nQUESTION: -- is what it means. And the\nChief Justice and Justice Scalia both indicated and\nit concerns me, too. What do you want to happen at\nthis hearing? You get your hearing. Are we supposed\nto send a Gulfstream over with 10 people who\nwitnessed the capture? How does this work?\nMR. DUNHAM: Well, the military's own\nregulations provide a good guide for how this hearing\nwould work. They allow testimony by affidavit when\nit can't, when it's not convenient to obtain it in\nany other way. And we are living in an age where we\nhave -- we are not living in the World War II age.\nWe have fax machines. We have phones that have\npictures. You can get depositions.\nQUESTION: What if they get a deposition\nfrom an American colonel who says this prisoner was\nturned over to me by allied forces, our Afghan allies\nin this combat, and I was assured by them that they\nhad captured him in a firefight? Now, is that going\nto satisfy our habeas corpus review?\nMR. DUNHAM: Your Honor, that would be a\nlot more than what we have now.\nQUESTION: Oh, it certainly would, but you\nwouldn't accept that, would you?\nMR. DUNHAM: Well, I wouldn't accept it\nwithout Mr. Hamdi --\nQUESTION: Of course you wouldn't.\nMR. DUNHAM: -- having an opportunity to be\nheard. Fundamental to --\nQUESTION: So your objection is not the\nhearsay rule, your objection is the right to make\nsome kind of response. That's your basic process\nclaim?\nMR. DUNHAM: That's correct, Your Honor.\nThat we have, we have never authorized detention of a\ncitizen in this country without giving him an\nopportunity to be heard, to say, hey, I am an\ninnocent person. We don't -- he hasn't even been\nable to say that yet. He hasn't been able to look at\nthe facts that have been alleged against him and give\nany kind of an explanation as to his side of the\nstory, which may well turn out to be true and may\nwell clear up some of the deficiencies in the Mobbs\nDeclaration.\nQUESTION: But if this -- I'm sorry. Go\non.\nQUESTION: At this stage of the game, I\ntake it, you have no per se objection to some form of\nmilitary process, so long as he could be heard?\nMR. DUNHAM: The only problem I would have\nwith that, Your Honor, and it's a small one, is that\nthe military has refused to give this process to him.\nQUESTION: No, I realize that. But\nthat's what you're -- you're asking us for something.\nAnd my suggestion is, if I understand your argument,\nthat if ultimately you were found, your client was\nfound to be entitled to some process, it might be,\nconsistently with your position, that military\nprocess with an opportunity to be heard in response\nwould satisfy your demand.\nMR. DUNHAM: Yes. That's correct, Your\nHonor.\nQUESTION: All right.\nMR. DUNHAM: The military procedure\nrequires the military to call witnesses and allows\nthe detainee an opportunity to give his own side of\nthe story and call his own witnesses.\nQUESTION: Do you still think that habeas\nis necessary in order to determine that that process\nhas been afforded him?\nMR. DUNHAM: Well, right now, habeas is\nnecessary to even get him that process.\nQUESTION: Let's assume the regime that\nJustice Souter suggested, it's in place. You are\nentitled to habeas in order to ensure that that has\ntaken place and have, have the Article III court\nsupervise that, or would affidavits that this, from\nthe Government that this procedure has been afforded\nbe satisfactory?\nMR. DUNHAM: That would be a separate\nhabeas proceeding, Your Honor, which might be filed\nafter the hearing was held by the military, and --\nQUESTION: I'm asking if you are entitled\nto file that as a matter of right.\nMR. DUNHAM: I believe that any U.S.\ncitizen has a right to file a habeas corpus petition\nat any time he is detained by the government. But I\ndon't know that the Article III court would need to\nsupervise the military hearing if that's what he got.\nHe would certainly have the right, when that hearing\nwas over, just like anybody does, to file a habeas\npetition saying that I'm detained by the government.\nAnd then the district judge could look at\nthe hearing, if there was a hearing by the military,\nhe could review it for fundamental fairness, if\nthat's what the detainee decided to do at that point.\nBut it wouldn't be --\nQUESTION: But it is reviewable on habeas?\nYou are not saying that it would be an adequate\ndefense in a subsequent habeas position simply to say\nthere was a hearing of the kind prescribed in the\nmilitary regulations, and after that hearing, he was\nfound to be an enemy combatant. That would not\nsatisfy you? You would allow the habeas court to\nre-examine the facts brought up in that hearing?\nMR. DUNHAM: I believe that the habeas\ncourt could always review the process to see that it\nwas fair. That's a habeas court's function.\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. DUNHAM: But it wouldn't be anything\nextensive. If there was a record from the military\nproceeding, the district judge would simply --\nQUESTION: Well, it depends on what you\nmean by fair, of course, and what, you know, what\ncommon law courts usually mean by fair, for example,\nis no hearsay testimony. And you apply that rule to\na wartime situation and everybody will get off.\nMR. DUNHAM: Well, Your Honor, the\nregulations, the military's own regulations say how\nthe hearing is to be held. The district judge would\nbe basically looking to see whether those regulations\nwere complied with.\nQUESTION: Oh, that's different. I\nthought you said that he would look to see whether\nthose regulations were fair.\nMR. DUNHAM: Oh, no, not the regulation --\nwhether the proceeding was fair, whether it complied\nwith fundamental due process. And that would --\nQUESTION: That's something quite\ndifferent from saying they followed the regulations.\nThe regulations might be something that a common law\njudge thinks does not comply with due process. In\nthat case, you would override the military judgment,\nright?\nMR. DUNHAM: Well, I believe the district\ncourt has that power, Your Honor. The Article III\ncourt has that power in a habeas proceeding.\nQUESTION: But I didn't understand your\nbasic answer. The basic question is, in the ordinary\ncase, not some unusual case, but in the ordinary\ncase, if they set up an ordinary military tribunal\naccording to Article I(6) and it worked and so forth,\nthen isn't that due process? I thought Justice\nScalia -- in response to Justice Scalia's question,\nyou said that wouldn't satisfy you, but my impression\nwas you were saying in the ordinary case, that would\nsatisfy you.\nMR. DUNHAM: That's correct.\nQUESTION: All right, it would satisfy\nyou. Fine.\nMR. DUNHAM: All I wanted to say was that\nyou haven't had that hearing.\nQUESTION: No, I understand that. That's\nthe second half of my question. They could satisfy\nyou, I take it, in one of two ways. A, that they\nhave the military tribunal that they've given in\nevery war and so forth, the ordinary procedure there,\na neutral decision maker and an opportunity to\npresent proofs and arguments, or B, they don't do\nthat.\nNow, if they refuse to do that, then what,\nin your opinion, should the habeas court do?\nMR. DUNHAM: Then the habeas court should\nhold a hearing that would be very similar to what the\nmilitary should have done. Judge Doumar here tried\nto send the case back to the military to have them\nhold the very hearing we're talking about, using\ntheir own officers to do it just as the military\nregulations require it.\nQUESTION: But that would be a different\napproach. I mean, it might be not that the habeas\ncourt has to hold the hearing that the military would\nhave held, but that the habeas court has to say to\nthe military, hold the hearing or let him go. You\nwould be satisfied, I take it, if the habeas court,\non Justice Breyer's hypothesis, said, hold the\nhearing.\nMR. DUNHAM: That would be satisfactory,\nYour Honor, but the question is what interferes with\nthe military more, for the district judge to hold a\nhearing that the military has previously refused to\ndo, or to order the military to follow their own\nrules?\nQUESTION: Was there a reason given --\nwhen the district judge suggested that solution, why\ndid the Government say, we don't want to use the\nprocedure that we used, say, in Vietnam?\nMR. DUNHAM: As I recall, the answer was\nwe're not required to and we don't choose to do so.\nQUESTION: Is that procedure -- does that\nhave -- did Congress have a part in that, the\nmilitary regulations that provided for how you treat\npeople in wartime situations who say, I'm innocent\nessentially?\nMR. DUNHAM: No, Congress has not passed\nthese rules.\nQUESTION: Well, Congress did pass\nsomething called the Authorization for Use of\nMilitary Force, did it not?\nMR. DUNHAM: Yes, it did, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And it affects this very\nconflict.\nMR. DUNHAM: Yes, it does, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Now, what application does that\nhave here? It appears to allow detention of people\ncaptured.\nMR. DUNHAM: The Authorization for Use of\nMilitary Force does not have the word detention\nanywhere in it. It talks about use of force and it\nis the equivalent, in our view, of a declaration of\nwar. Although it is not a formal declaration of war,\nit would have that same operative effect. And in our\nhistory, we have never had any substantive rights\nconveyed to the commander-in-chief by the mere act of\na declaration of war.\nQUESTION: He has them inherently. I mean,\ncertainly,\nyou know, when there is a declaration of war or a\nresolution such as this, surely the President has the\nright to kill foreign combatants, no?\nMR. DUNHAM: He certainly has the right to\nkill them and if they're aliens --\nQUESTION: Now, is it conceivable that he\nhas to kill them but not to detain them?\nMR. DUNHAM: He has the right to detain\nalien combatants, no question about it. But when it\ncomes to U.S. citizens, you don't simply detain them.\nYou prosecute them, like they did with John Walker\nLindh.\nQUESTION: You're saying that AMUF is\ninsufficient in this case to detain, because\ndeclarations of war and the AMUF historically have\nsimply authorized the President to use his judgment\nand his force and his capacities and his power\nwithout having an extensive list of the different\nthings that he can do. And you're asking for\nsomething quite different, it seems to me.\nMR. DUNHAM: Well, in the War of 1812,\nthere was a general declaration of war but Congress\nstill passed a list of specific things the President\ncould do. Obviously a declaration of war doesn't\ngive the President the power to appropriate funds to\nfight the war.\nQUESTION: No, but look, it does say in\nthis authorization, the President is authorized to\nuse all necessary and appropriate force against\npersons he determines planned, authorized, committed\nor aided the terrorist attacks.\nMR. DUNHAM: If that is interpreted to\nmean that he can impose indefinite executive\ndetention on anybody that he thinks is necessary in\norder to fulfill that command, we could have people\nlocked up all over the country tomorrow without any\ndue process, without any opportunity to be heard,\nbecause we know that this war that we're talking\nabout here is going on worldwide and it's going on\nwithin our own borders.\nCongress didn't intend to -- when it\npassed this Authorization for Use of Military Force\nto authorize widespread detentions of people with no\nopportunity to be heard, indefinite, solitary\nconfinement for as long as they might live. Congress\n-- there is no indication that Congress intended any\nsuch thing.\nQUESTION: Did Congress intend that the\nPresident has the authority and the right to use\nwhatever powers are necessary to suppress the\nterrorists and to prevent future attacks, consistent\nwith the traditions and the powers of that office?\nMR. DUNHAM: I believe they authorize it\nconsistent with our laws. I don't think Congress\nrepealed any laws when they wrote the Authorization\nfor Use of Military Force.\nQUESTION: Mr. Dunham, can I ask you sort\nof a preliminary question. We're talking about way\ndown the road now, but do you contest any of the\nfacts in the Mobbs Declaration?\nMR. DUNHAM: Well, I've only recently been\nallowed to talk to my client, Your Honor, and\neverything he has told me they tell me is classified,\nso I'm not allowed to convey it to the Court this\nmorning. But the best I can say is in an overall\ngeneral way, there is a substantial dispute.\nQUESTION: There is a substantial dispute,\nand have you had an opportunity, on behalf of the\nclient, to supplement or to contradict or supplement\nthe information in the Mobbs Declaration?\nMR. DUNHAM: No, because it's -- it's\nwhile the matter has been pending before this Court\nand there is no way to go before the Court at this\npoint, absent a remand, in order to do that. If the\nCourt remanded, I would be able to do that provided\nthat we had appropriate protective orders in place so\nthat I could convey classified information to the\nCourt.\nQUESTION: Mr. Dunham, one of the judges\non the Fourth Circuit in the en banc denial, Judge\nMotz, had a proposal that was similar to the one that\nJudge Mukasey proposed in New York. And that is,\ninitially, the Mobbs affidavit is taken as true but\nthat you have an opportunity to rebut it. Would that\nbe a satisfactory -- would that comport with due\nprocess? In your view?\nMR. DUNHAM: Your Honor, that is the way\nthe statutory habeas proceeding is supposed to\nunfold. The Government doesn't deny that we have a\nright to have a habeas proceeding. They've conceded\nit at three different points in their brief. So once\nwe're before the court on a petition for habeas\ncorpus, the question is what does that proceeding\nlook like. And I suggest it's spelled out in the\nU.S. code.\nWhen Congress passed the Authorization for\nUse of Military Force, it did not say we suspend\nhabeas. Habeas corpus statutes are still on the\nbooks and exactly what Your Honor is talking about is\nwhat should happen.\nQUESTION: So every United States citizen,\neven if captured on the field of combat, is\nentitled to a habeas hearing?\nMR. DUNHAM: That of course assumes he's\ncaptured on the field of combat, Your Honor, which we\ndon't concede.\nQUESTION: Well, that's right. He's\nentitled to a habeas hearing to determine whether in\nfact he was captured on the field of combat opposing\nthe United States, right?\nMR. DUNHAM: Well, if he files a petition\nfor habeas corpus, yes.\nQUESTION: And I presume that anybody who\nclaims to be an American citizen would be entitled to\na habeas hearing on the question of whether he is in\nfact an American citizen, and then the subsequent\nquestion of whether he was captured on the field of\ncombat while taking up arms against the\nUnited States, right?\nMR. DUNHAM: Well, the military --\nQUESTION: So every foreigner captured, if\nhe claims to be an American citizen, would be\nentitled to the kind of habeas hearing you're talking\nabout?\nMR. DUNHAM: Not necessarily on a mere\nclaim, Your Honor. The military is required to take\na long list of biographical data from anybody they\ncapture. And in this particular case, there is no\ndispute about the man's citizenship. There is a\nbirth certificate in the record. The military has\nnot -- they're the ones that determined he was a\ncitizen.\nQUESTION: I'm not talking about this\ncase. I'm talking about the principle that you're\nasking us to adopt and how it would apply. I mean,\nif there is a habeas corpus right for an American\ncitizen, there has to be, it seems to me, a habeas\ncorpus right for everyone who claims he is an\nAmerican citizen.\nMR. DUNHAM: Your Honor, that may be the\ncase but that doesn't justify taking away the habeas\ncorpus right from a citizen. That is a right that\nhas been there since this country was founded and it\ndoesn't justify taking away a citizen's right because\nsome sham claim might be made.\nQUESTION: Whether it's been there since\nthe country was founded when he is captured on the\nfield of battle is the very controverted question\nthat's up here. You can't say that with that\nassurance. I mean, that's why we have a case here.\nMR. DUNHAM: If it please the Court, I\nwould like to save the balance of my time for\nrebuttal.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Dunham.\nMr. Clement, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT BY PAUL D. CLEMENT\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS\nMR. CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice and may it\nplease the Court:\nPetitioners contend that the Government\ncategorically lacks the authority to hold Hamdi as an\nenemy combatant. But it has been well established\nand long established that the Government has the\nauthority to hold both unlawful enemy combatants and\nlawful prisoners of war captured on the battlefield\nin order to prevent them from returning to the\nbattle.\nOver 10,000 United States troops remain on\nthe field of battle in Afghanistan. No principle of\nlaw or logic requires the United States to release an\nindividual from detention so that he can rejoin the\nbattle against the United States.\nQUESTION: But the question of whether\nit's a criminal procedure or this detention without\n-- does the Government have any rhyme or rationale as\nto why some of these people -- I think Mr. Dunham\nmentioned Lindh, there is also Moussaoui, there is\nthis John -- they are also being kept away from\nreturning any place because there are criminal\ncharges against them.\nAnd then there is Hamdi and Padilla and\nal-Marri who are in this detention state with no\ncharges. What does the Government -- how does the\nGovernment justify some going through the criminal\nprocess and others just being held indefinitely?\nMR. CLEMENT: Justice Ginsburg, I think\nthat reflects a sound exercise of prosecutorial and\nexecutive discretion. There are some individuals who\nmay be captured in a situation where they do not\nhave any particular intelligence value, they have\nbeen handled in a way where there are no difficult\nevidentiary questions that would be raised in a\ncriminal prosecution and those individuals can be\ndealt with in the Article III system.\nBut there are plenty of individuals who\neither have a paramount intelligence value that\nputting them into the Article III system immediately\nand providing them with counsel whose first advice\nwould certainly be to not talk to the Government is a\ncounterproductive way to proceed in these cases.\nQUESTION: At the moment, nobody --\nQUESTION: I'm trying to find whether\nthere is any literature or commentary on how long the\ndetention is required before the intelligence value,\nthe interrogation value of the custody serves no\nfurther purpose. Can you give me any ideas of the\nouter bounds of how long the detention would take in\norder to get the value from the interrogation that\nyou want?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Kennedy, I'm\nnot sure I can give you the outer bounds, but what I\ncan say is that the case here before you today in\nHamdi, and the case in Padilla, suggests that the\namount of time that is necessary to allow for\ninterrogation without access to counsel in order to\nget intelligence is not an indefinite period of time.\nBoth these individuals now have access to\ncounsel because the military intelligence experts who\nmake these judgments have made the judgment that\naccess to counsel at this point does not interfere\nwith the intelligence gathering process.\nQUESTION: Would it be --\nQUESTION: Mr. Clement, how can you\nassume --\nQUESTION: Would it be a helpful line of\ninquiry for a district court, assuming that there is\nsome jurisdiction in the district court, which you\nwould contest, to have testimony as to how effective\ninterrogations are and how long it takes. And then\nwe could begin to get some understanding of this\nprocess?\nMR. CLEMENT: I suppose you could. One\nthing I would point you to, Justice Kennedy, is the\ndeclaration of Vice Admiral Jacoby, who is the director\nof the Defense Intelligence Agency. That's at page 75 of\nthe Joint Appendix in the Padilla case.\nAnd I think that -- there obviously are\nvarious ways the courts could approach this. A court\nin one proceeding could take evidence of the question\ngenerally. I suppose if there were a situation in\nwhich there was a habeas petition filed and there was\nan initial period where there was no access to\ncounsel, if a judge for some reason thought that that\nhad taken too long, I suppose that judge could make\nan inquiry of the Government, and in an ex parte\nproceeding, they could make some kind of filing\nexplaining to the judge why it is that further\ninterrogation without counsel is necessary.\nI think the important thing is twofold.\nOne, to recognize that there is a unique interest,\nespecially in the course of this conflict, where\nintelligence is at unprecedented value, to have some\nability with some detainees to deal with them in a\nway that allows us to get intelligence to prevent\nfuture terrorist attacks, and not be limited just to\ngoing after them retrospectively for past terrorist\nattacks.\nQUESTION: We can accept that, but what do\nyou, what do you make of Section 4001. I take it\nit's the Government's position that it has absolutely\nno application to the situation. That it simply\nrefers to the normal circumstances of the criminal\nlaw. Is that right?\nMR. CLEMENT: That's right, Justice\nSouter, but I would be quick to add that we -- I\nmean, all 4001(a) says is that an individual must be\ndetained pursuant to an act of Congress.\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. DUNHAM: If one needs an act of\nCongress, and we question whether this really has\nanything to do with the detention of enemy combatants\nby the military, but to the extent an act of Congress\nis necessary, as I think Justice O'Connor's questions\nindicated, the Authorization of Force provides more\nthan ample statutory --\nQUESTION: It certainly did -- may I just\nask one more question? I will concede certainly at\nleast for the sake of argument that it did in the, in\nthe early stages of the period starting with\nSeptember 11th. I will assume for the sake of\nargument that it did when it was passed.\nIt doesn't follow, however, that it is\nadequate for all time. The fact is, I will assume\nthat on September 12th, without any authorization\nfrom Congress at all, the President could have taken\naction in relation to this individual, I mean, if he\nhad been fighting on a battlefield that the President\ntook.\nBut it doesn't follow that the President's\nauthority to do that is indefinite for all time. And\nI guess the question I would be interested in and\nyour response to is this. Is it reasonable to think\nthat the, that the authorization was sufficient at\nthe time that it was passed, but that at some point,\nit is a Congressional responsibility, and ultimately\na constitutional right on this person's part, for\nCongress to assess the situation and either pass a\nmore specific continuing authorization or at least to\ncome up with the conclusion that its prior\nauthorization was good enough. Doesn't Congress at\nsome point have a responsibility to do more than pass\nthat resolution?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Souter, I\nwould say a couple of things. One is there may be\nsome difficult questions down the road, but if there\nis emphasis that 10,000 United States troops remain\non the battlefield in Afghanistan --\nQUESTION: Well, there are 10,000 troops\nthere, but it's two and a half years later. And it\nmay very well be that the, that the constitutional\nobligation and the constitutional demand that his\nclient can make is that the political branch take\na -- make a further assessment and a more specific\none. I'm not denying that there is a lot going on,\nbut there has also been time.\nMR. CLEMENT: I realize that, Justice\nSouter. Let me say one other thing. And then if I\nhave time, I'd come back to the 10,000 troops still\non the ground. What I would say is Congress has been\nopen with whatever appropriate recesses every day\nsince September 18th, 2001 when they passed the joint\nresolution.\nIf they were to pass some specific statute\nthat either provided for more finely reticulated\nprocedures for dealing with enemy combatants or tried\nto preclude the detention of certain individuals,\nthen I think one of two things would happen, either\nthe executive branch would follow those more\nreticulated provisions, or I suppose if there was a\njudgment by Congress that this authority was denied\nall together and the President thought that that\nauthority was absolutely necessary to the fighting of\nthe battle in Afghanistan, then you might have a\nsituation where we came to this Court in a situation\nthat Justice Jackson would say the executive's power\nis at its lowest ebb.\nBut here we come to the Court with that\nauthorization that the President relied on.\nQUESTION: You come with an authorization\nthat the President relied on and which I will assume\nhe quite rightly relied on at the time it was passed.\nBut my question is a timing question. Is it not\nreasonable to at least consider whether that\nresolution needs, at this point, to be supplemented\nand made more specific to authorize what you are\ndoing?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, again, Justice Souter,\nI can't imagine that the rule is that the executive\nsomehow suffers if Congress doesn't fill the breach.\nBecause the last word from Congress is that -- that\nall necessary and appropriate force is authorized.\nQUESTION: Yes, but when you say the\nexecutive suffers, I think your response is assuming that\nthe\nexecutive has the power. And it may very well be\nthat the executive has power in the early exigencies\nof an emergency. But that at some point in the\nindefinite future, the other political branch has got\nto act if that, if power is to continue.\nMR. CLEMENT: But Justice Souter, they\nhave authorized the use of force. They recognize, if\nyou took --\nQUESTION: Without any specific reference\nto this situation, without any specific reference to\nkeeping American citizens detained indefinitely. I\nmean, that's the problem.\nQUESTION: Mr. Clement, this Section 4001\ndoesn't relate to a hearing, it relates to the\nPresident's power to detain, doesn't it?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, absolutely.\nQUESTION: So if it expires after two and\na half years, it would just not mean you have to give\nthem counsel after two and a half years or give them\na hearing after two and a half years. It means you\nwould have to let them go back to Afghanistan after\ntwo and a half years, wouldn't it?\nMR. CLEMENT: It would, Justice Scalia --\nQUESTION: It would, but it uses --\nMR. CLEMENT: And that's why I find it so\nremarkable that we have to confront this question\nwhen our troops are still on the ground in\nAfghanistan.\nQUESTION: Wait. You're also -- the words\nare necessary and appropriate. And also the words in\nthe Constitution are due process of law. And also\nthe words in the Magna Carta were according to law.\nAnd whatever form of words in any of those documents\nthere are, it seemed to refer to one basic idea\nthat's minimum. That a person who contests something\nof importance is entitled to a neutral decision maker\nand an opportunity to present proofs and arguments.\nYou have heard, in the last hour, people\ntalking about the military itself recognizing that\nbasic principle with tribunals in what is called Army\nReg 190.8. Now, is there any reason why, when a\nperson says I am not a combatant, I was a relief\nworker, I wasn't even there, I was sold into this by\npeople who wanted a bounty, is there any reason why\nyou could not have that kind of proceeding, the kind\nof proceeding that was given in the Gulf War on the\nbattlefield in hundreds of instances, that was given\nin Iraq in hundreds of instances, the kind of\nproceeding that the military itself has given over\nand over and over.\nNow, is there any reason why that isn't\nnecessary and appropriate, or why that isn't in\naccordance with law or due process of law?\nMR. CLEMENT: Justice Breyer, let me say\nseveral things. One is that the regulations that are\nbeing bandied about are the regulations that the Army\nuses to comply with their obligations under Article V\nof the Geneva Convention.\nNow, Article V of the Geneva Convention\ndoes not apply here, and let me address why in a\nminute, but let me say very clearly that these\nindividuals have gotten military process. It might\nnot have been the exact process --\nQUESTION: That wasn't the question I\nasked. The question I asked, is there any reason why\nthe Army itself could not give a comparable basic\nproceeding where you have a neutral decision maker,\nand a practical, but fair opportunity to present\nproofs and arguments? Not some kind of thing on the\nbattlefield, something two years later, not some kind\nof thing where you haul in witnesses, but something\nthat's practical insofar as you get evidence that's\nreasonably available.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Breyer --\nQUESTION: I want a practical answer. I\ndon't want a -- yes.\nMR. CLEMENT: I understand that. But the\npractical answer that you are looking for assumes a\nprocess that's never been provided. There has never\nbeen a process that's removed from the battlefield.\nWhat Article V provides and what the military\nregulations provide is immediately adjunct to the\nbattlefield, you have three military officers who do\na very quick hearing, the purpose of which primarily\nis to figure out not whether somebody is completely\ninnocent, but to figure out whether they are properly\nclassified as a prisoner of war, as opposed to an\nunlawful enemy combatant.\nQUESTION: So you say the regulations in\nplace provide for that battlefield type review?\nMR. CLEMENT: They do, Justice O'Connor --\nQUESTION: Did this Petitioner have that\ntype of review?\nMR. CLEMENT: This Petitioner, Justice\nO'Connor, did not get that precise type of review,\nand the reason is because, based on a Presidential\ndetermination, the military officers understood that\nArticle V of the Geneva Convention has no application\nhere. Again, that provision, and I think it's worth\n--\nQUESTION: Well, perhaps not, but we are\nhere on habeas. Do you agree that, that he is\nentitled to bring a habeas action?\nMR. CLEMENT: We do agree that he is\nentitled to bring a --\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. CLEMENT: -- habeas action.\nQUESTION: So then we have to decide then\nto what is he entitled, and even that minimal review\nby the military, you think, is not required?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I don't think it's\nrequired, especially in a situation like this, where\nalthough Hamdi did not receive an Article V hearing\nbecause it was inapplicable, he did receive military\nprocess. When he was originally turned over to the\nUnited States forces by the Northern Alliance, our\nmilitary allies, there was a screening process on the\nground in Afghanistan. Now, that process screened\nout 10,000 individuals out of U.S. custody. So he\nreceived that process.\nNow, to be sure, it's a military process,\nbut it is the kind of process that prisoners of war\nand enemy combatants have always gotten. Now,\nbecause of the nature of this war, Hamdi got\nadditional process. And it's important to point out\nthat this Article V process that other prisoners of\nwar traditionally get is a one-shot deal. It's done\noff the battlefield and that's it. You are under\ndetention for the remainder of the battle. And\nthere's no reason for Congress to have to go in with\na new resolution. You are there for the remainder of\nthe war.\nNow, in this context, because we recognize\nthat there are some unusual aspects of this war, and\nalso because the United States military has no\ninterest in detaining any individual who is not an\nenemy combatant or who does not present a continuing\nthreat, when Hamdi got to Guantanamo, he was given\nadditional screening processes. That screened him in\nas well. Did not screen him out.\nThen it may not seem what you think of as\ntraditional due process in an Article III sense, but\nthe interrogation process itself provides an\nopportunity for an individual to explain that this\nhas all been a mistake. And as the affidavit that's\nin the record here shows --\nQUESTION: Do you say he had that\nopportunity?\nMR. CLEMENT: Absolutely, Justice\nO'Connor. And the affidavit that's filed here\nrepresents, by Mr. Mobbs, that the interrogation\nprocess, in that process, his story confirmed that he\nwas on the battlefield and surrendered with the\nTaliban military unit while armed.\nQUESTION: Do you concede that you have\nthe obligation to make the representation that you\nhave just made to the habeas court?\nMR. CLEMENT: Justice Kennedy, I'm not\npositive what the ultimate minimum that the habeas\nstatutes would require in this context, but we do\nthink that an appropriate balance of individual\nrights, the traditional role of habeas, that the\noverwhelming military imperatives of this situation\nare that the habeas corpus writ is available, first\nto make legal challenges to the detention along the\nlines of 4001(a) categorically precludes this, and\nthose challenges have been open.\nWe also think it appropriate for the\nUnited States to come in with a declaration that\nexplains the basis for the military's decision. And\nparticularly, I think what it does is it provides an\nexplanation that if believed, provides a basis for a\ncourt to police the line that separates Quirin on the\none hand from Milligan on the other.\nAnd obviously, a situation like this with\na battlefield detainee who surrendered while armed on\nthe battlefield is a classic case of an enemy\ncombatant.\nQUESTION: Is there any --\nQUESTION: In Quirin, in Quirin, the\ndefendants were heard, and that's -- the Mobbs\naffidavit is, I take it your position is, yes,\nhabeas, and yes, the Government has to come forward\nwith something. And the something they came forward\nwith is the Mobbs affidavit, which is hearsay,\nbecause Mobbs doesn't know what happened on the\nbattlefield either. And that there is no statement\nat any point from Hamdi, although the claim before us\nis that he would dispute what's in the Mobbs\naffidavit, but he doesn't have an opportunity to do\nthat.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I\nmean, there actually is, I mean, it would be\nsomething like double hearsay, but there is a\nstatement in the Mobbs declaration itself where Mobbs\nis summarizing that Hamdi himself --\nQUESTION: Yes, but that certainly is\ndouble hearsay.\nMR. CLEMENT: It certainly is, but this\nis --\nQUESTION: The person who is locked up,\ndoesn't he have a right to bring before some tribunal\nhimself his own words, rather than have a Government\nagent say what was told to him that somebody else\nsaid.\nMR. CLEMENT: With respect, Justice\nGinsburg, he has an opportunity to explain it in his\nown words. Now, it may not --\nQUESTION: During interrogation?\nMR. CLEMENT: During interrogation.\nQUESTION: I mean, is that your point?\nMR. CLEMENT: During interrogation.\nDuring the initial screening. During the screening\nin Guantanamo.\nQUESTION: How about to a neutral decision\nmaker of some kind, perhaps in the military? Is that\nso extreme that it should not be required?\nMR. CLEMENT: No, Justice O'Connor. And\nlet me say two things. One is when the initial\nscreening criteria are applied in the field, for all\nintents and purposes, that is a neutral decision\nmaker.\nI mean, as I said before, the Army is not\ninterested in holding people as enemy combatants that\ndon't qualify for that and don't pose a threat. The\nsecond thing I would say, though, is that as I\nunderstand it, the plan on a going-forward basis\nreflecting the unique situation of this battle is to\nprovide individuals like Hamdi, like Padilla, with\nthe equivalent of the annual review process that's\nlaid out in the briefs --\nQUESTION: Well, let's talk about that for\njust a moment. What is it that the Government is\nsaying will be provided?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice O'Connor,\nthose regulations are still in draft form.\nQUESTION: So we don't know?\nMR. CLEMENT: We don't know for sure. I\nthink what's envisioned is an opportunity to go\nbefore a neutral tribunal, some opportunity to\npresent --\nQUESTION: Yes, but Mr. Clement, you're\nassuming he has no right to counsel, aren't you?\nMR. CLEMENT: Justice Stevens, what we're\nassuming is that he has no right to counsel that is\nautomatic and as of right --\nQUESTION: If he could get his own\ncounsel, would he be entitled to consult with his\ncounsel during the preliminary stages of his\ndetention?\nMR. CLEMENT: Not at the preliminary\nstages if the Government has made a determination\nthat access to counsel would interfere with the\nintelligence gathering process.\nQUESTION: Are there any cases -- it\nsounds from your argument that the principle\ninterests that the Government wants to advance is the\nability to interrogate the person for a sufficient\nlength of time to determine whether they get valuable\ninformation out of them or not.\nAnd to deny him counsel during that\nperiod, because he may not be as willing to talk.\nNow, it seems to me there are two things about that I\nwanted to ask you about. One, have you considered\nthe possibility that perhaps a lawyer would have\nexplained to this man that if you do give some\ninformation, you won't have to stay here\nincommunicado for two or three years? That might be\na motivation to talk. That's one possibility.\nAnd the second thing I want to ask you\nabout, are there any cases in the international field\nor the law anywhere, explaining that the interest in\ndetaining a person incommunicado for a long period of\ntime for the purpose of obtaining information from\nthem is a legitimate justification?\nI understand for arresting on the\nbattlefield, that's perfectly clear. But is this\nprolonged detention for that purpose the subject of\njudicial writing anywhere that you know about?\nMR. CLEMENT: Let me answer both parts of\nyour question, Justice Stevens. Certainly it has\noccurred to us and we have considered the possibility\nthat in some circumstances with some individuals, the\nbest way to get them to cooperate and provide\ninformation is to give them a lawyer who will tell\nthem, boy, you know, it's in your best interest to\nplead to this relatively minor material support\ncharge or whatever and provide the Government with\neverything that you have.\nAnd that is part of the answer to\nJustice Ginsburg's earlier question, is why is it\nthat there is this pattern that you look at and some\npeople are used in the Article III system and other\npeople are prosecuted or dealt with in preventative\ndetention in the military system.\nAnd it reflects a judgment by people whose\njob it is to make these judgments that certain\npeople, the best way to get them to cooperate, or\nmaybe with certain individuals after you've gotten a\ncertain amount of information from them, but you feel\nthere is one other area you're not going to get\nunless the dynamic fundamentally changes, those\npeople may be best dealt with in the way that you\nenvisioned. Whereas other individuals, the only way\nthat the judgment of the intelligence experts had to\ndeal with them is to provide them without counsel and\nto use an interrogation.\nI think to get to your second part of the\nquestion, I don't know that there are any authorities\nthat I'm aware of that address exactly what you're\ntalking about, but I think there are two types of\nauthority that we would point to as being very\nimportant. First of all, it's long been recognized\nthat one of the major justifications for the\ndetention of enemy combatants or prisoners of war is\nto gather intelligence. And we cite some sources to\nthat effect in the brief.\nThe second thing, and I think this is\nimportant, is that it has never been the case that\nprisoners of war are entitled to counsel to challenge\ntheir capture or their detention. What has happened\nhistorically, and what the Geneva Convention\nprovides, is that if one of those enemy combatants is\ncharged with a specific war crime, then at that point\nthey're entitled to counsel. But if they are just\nbeing held in a preventative detention, then in that\ncircumstance, they are not entitled to counsel.\nQUESTION: But have we ever had a\nsituation like this where presumably this status --\nwar-like status could last for 25 years, 50 years,\nwhatever it is.\nMR. CLEMENT: A couple of responses,\nJustice O'Connor. First of all, in the midst of any\nwar, the detention may seem like it's indefinite\nbecause if you talk about a detainee in 1942, they're\nnot going to know how long World War II is going to\nlast. And their detention may seem indefinite but\nthose detentions have always been approved under the\nlaw of war.\nSecond, with respect to Al Qaeda and\nindividuals who are hard core Al Qaeda operatives,\nthe end of the war is a very difficult thing to\nperceive. But with respect to somebody who is\ncaptured on the battlefield with the Taliban, this\nwar may eventually -- the executive may make the\njudgment or Congress may help us make the judgment\nthat the war in Afghanistan is effectively over.\nAnd individuals who only really posed a\ndanger of rejoining the battle in Afghanistan would\nbe released. Now, there may be a few individuals\nwho, as I say, are hard core Al Qaeda operatives and\nthey're going to join the battle against the\nUnited States wherever it's waged. They're just in\nAfghanistan because that's where the action is.\nQUESTION: May I ask just one other\nquestion, I think it's just relevant. But do you\nthink there is anything in the law that curtails the\nmethod of interrogation that may be employed?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I think there is,\nJustice Stevens. I mean --\nQUESTION: And what is that?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, just to give one\nexample, I think that the United States is signatory\nto conventions that prohibit torture and that sort of\nthing. And the United States is going to honor its\ntreaty obligations. The other thing that's worth\nmentioning of course --\nQUESTION: But you said something about\nself-executing. In connection with the Geneva\nConvention, you said, well, it's not self-executing.\nWould you say the same thing about the torture\nconvention?\nMR. CLEMENT: Justice Ginsburg, I actually\nhave the sense that the torture victims -- you have\nthe Torture Victim Protection Act, of course, which I\nthink doesn't actually apply to the United States.\nSo I'm not sure that there would be any other basis\nfor bringing a private cause of action against the\nUnited States.\nBut as this Court noted in footnote 14 of\nthe Eisentrager opinion, the idea that a treaty is\ngoing to be enforced through means other than a\nprivate cause of action doesn't mean that it's not a\nbinding treaty, doesn't mean that it's not going to\nconstrain the actions of the executive branch.\nJust to finish up my answer to Justice\nStevens' question, I wouldn't want there to be any\nmisunderstanding about this. It's also the judgment\nof those involved in this process that the last thing\nyou want to do is torture somebody or try to do\nsomething along those lines.\nI mean, if there were an artificial -- if\nyou did that, you might get information more quickly,\nbut you would really wonder about the reliability of\nthe information you were getting. So the judgment of\nthe people who do this as their responsibility is\nthat the way you would get the best information from\nindividuals is that you interrogate them, you try to\ndevelop a relationship of trust.\nQUESTION: But doesn't the Court have some\nbusiness intervening at some point, if it's the\nHundred Years War or something?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Breyer, I\nmean, there may be a point where, depending on the\nnature of the war -- I mean, I'm not quite sure what\nyou have in mind that they would intervene on.\nQUESTION: At some point, if you're\nholding people without a lawyer, with the only\nneutral decision maker being an interrogator, with no\nopportunity to present proofs and evidence, with no\nopportunity to hear the other side, in your opinion,\nif that goes on and on, let's say it's the Hundred\nYears War, is there no opportunity for a court, in\nyour view, to say that this violates, for an American\ncitizen, the elementary due process that the\nConstitution guarantees?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, as I indicated\nearlier, Justice Breyer, the courts remain open. We\nrecognize the viability of the writ of habeas corpus.\nThere certainly is a challenge that can be brought to\nthe length of the detention at some point. And the\ncourts would be open to hear claims --\nQUESTION: But your answer to Justice\nO'Connor, I thought, was, we don't have to worry or a\ncourt should not be worrying about the indefiniteness\nof the time because it may well be that the President\nor Congress will at some point say the war in\nAfghanistan is no longer a matter of concern and,\ntherefore, we don't have to hold the Hamdis.\nI think that's the only answer that you\nhave given so far to Justice Breyer's question and\nJustice O'Connor's question. Am I wrong?\nMR. CLEMENT: Justice Souter, a couple of\npoints. One is, I don't think there is any\ncontradiction with that and my answer to Justice\nBreyer's question. I mean, you can imagine a\nsituation where the evidence in the Government's own\naffidavit shows that somebody is only detained with\nregard to war in Afghanistan. And then you can\nimagine that that has been signed, sealed and\ndelivered, it's over, the President says so, Congress\nsays so and there is an effort to continue to detain\nthat individual.\nQUESTION: I can imagine it and I can also\nimagine that the concern about Afghanistan will go on\nas long as there is concern about Al Qaeda, and there\nis no endpoint that we can see at this point to that.\nSo that it seems to me your answer boils down to\nsaying, don't worry about the timing question, we'll\ntell you when it's over.\nMR. CLEMENT: With respect, Justice\nSouter, I continue to think that there may be a role\nfor the courts in dealing with the timing question at\nsome point. I think that would be --\nQUESTION: I'm taking away from the\nargument the impression, and please correct me if I'm\nwrong, that you think there is a continuing role for\nthe courts to examine the reasonableness of the\nperiod of detention.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I wouldn't take that\naway, Justice Kennedy. What I'm saying is there is a\ncontinuing but modest role for the courts. The\nhabeas courts will remain open. I mean, the import\nof one of Justice Souter's questions is that it's\nalready too long and if somebody raised that claim,\nif there is another petition filed, a direct petition\nnow that Hamdi has counsel that's filed in this\nclaim, and that claim is raised, we would be in court\nvehemently saying there is no role for the habeas\ncourt there. There are troops still on the ground in\nAfghanistan. It makes no sense whatsoever to release\nan individual detained as an enemy combatant in\nAfghanistan while the troops are still on the ground\nin Afghanistan.\nQUESTION: But it may make every bit of\nsense to have an opportunity on the part of that\nindividual, before someone other than an\ninterrogator, to say, I am not the kind of person\nthat they claim I am on the basis of which they are\nholding me.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, again --\nQUESTION: The alternative is not give him\nsome kind of a hearing or release him.\nMR. CLEMENT: No, but the alternative is\nto provide a means of allowing for a military process\nto go forward. It's not just the interrogator. It's\nthe original screening team on the ground in\nAfghanistan that, as I said before, released 10,000\nindividuals out of U.S. custody. It's the screening\nteam in Guantanamo and then it is this annual review\nprocess that will go forward. Now that is a\ntremendous amount of process that the executive\nbranch is providing.\nQUESTION: That we don't have yet. It's\nstill on the drawing board, the annual review.\nMR. CLEMENT: That's quite correct,\nJustice Ginsburg, but I would say that for the time\nbeing, everything provided to date is more than\nsufficient.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Clement.\nMr. Dunham, you have four minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK W. DUNHAM, JR.\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS\nMR. DUNHAM: May it please the Court.\nMr. Clement is a worthy advocate and he can stand up\nhere and make the unreasonable sound reasonable. But\nwhen you take his argument at core, it is, \"Trust\nus.\" And who is saying trust us? The executive\nbranch. And why do we have the great writ? We have\nthe great writ because we didn't trust the executive\nbranch when we founded this Government. That's why\nthe Government is saying trust us is no excuse for\ntaking away and driving a truck through the right of\nhabeas corpus and the Fifth Amendment that no man\nshall be deprived of liberty except upon due process\nof law.\nWe have a small problem here. One\ncitizen. We're not talking about thousands. One\ncitizen caught up in a problem in Afghanistan. Is it\nbetter to give him rights or is it better to start a\nnew dawn of saying there are circumstances where you\ncan't file a writ of habeas corpus and there are\ncircumstances where you can't get due process. I\nthink not.\nI would urge the Court not to go down that\nroad. I would urge the Court to find that citizens\ncan only be detained by law. And here there is no\nlaw. If there is any law at all, it is the\nexecutive's own secret definition of whatever enemy\ncombatant is. And don't fool yourselves into\nthinking that that means somebody coming off a\nbattlefield because they've used it in Chicago,\nthey've used it in New York and they've used it in\nIndiana.\nThe Congress needs to act here. Justice\nSouter was on point when he was talking about the\nfact that we're two years into this thing and\nCongress leaves all the laws on the books that relate\nto habeas corpus and how a habeas corpus proceeding\nis supposed to go. They leave the 4001(a) on the\nbooks that says no executive detention. But we\nignore those laws, we don't enforce them. We don't\nrequire Congress to fill a gap.\nCongress tomorrow could take these\nmilitary regs and they could say, this is the law, we\nauthorize the executive to detain people and to give\nthem hearings the way the military says, and then it\nwould be lawful.\nBut Congress hasn't done that and I\nrespectfully submit, Your Honors, that until Congress\ndoes act, these detentions are not lawful. And I\nwould respectfully ask this Court to step up to the\nplate and say so.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Dunham. The\ncase is submitted.\n(Whereupon, at 11:19 a.m., the case in the\nabove-entitled matter was submitted.)\n"
