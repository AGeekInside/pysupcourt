LAMKEN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. LAMKEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nAs the Commissioner of Social Security has long\nconstrued the disability insurance program, there can be\nno finding of disability unless at least two conditions\nare met. First, the claimant's impairment must be of such\nseverity that she cannot -- she is unable to do her\nprevious work. Second, the impairments must be of such\nseverity that the claimant cannot, considering her age,\neducation, and experience, engage in any other kind of\nsubstantial, gainful work which exists in the national\neconomy.\nConstruing and applying those provisions for\nmore than 3 decades, the commissioner has consistently\nconcluded that if a claimant continues to function at a\nlevel sufficient to meet the demands of past work, then\nthe claimant is not disabled without the necessity of\ninquiring into whether that particular past job exists in\nsignificant numbers. That's the most natural reading of\nthe statutory text.\nQUESTION: Mr. Lamken, this case, I think,\ninvolves provisions of both title II and title XVI of the\nact, and there are regulations under each.\nMR. LAMKEN: That is correct. It is --\nQUESTION: Now, are there any relevant\ndifferences in the text of the two statutes or the regs on\nthis issue?\nMR. LAMKEN: No, Your Honor. We don't believe\nthat there are any relevant differences, that the\ncommissioner's regulations and the statutes themselves are\nall phrased in parallel if not identical language\nthroughout.\nThere is one difference in that for a disability\ninsurance, these title II provisions, you have to be\nsomeone who has paid into the program in order to be\neligible for benefits on the way out; whereas, title XVI\nis more of a welfare program where whether you've paid in\nin the past doesn't matter. But that simply means that\none who has paid into the title II program would get\nconsiderably more benefits than one who has not.\nQUESTION: But on the test.\nMR. LAMKEN: On the test, it is an identical\ntest.\nQUESTION: There's no difference.\nMR. LAMKEN: There is no test, Justice O'Connor.\nQUESTION: Thank you.\nMR. LAMKEN: That construction preserves the\ndistinction long recognized in the commissioner's\nregulations, in fact, recognizing the commissioner's\nregulations from the earliest days of administering this\nstatute. Between disability insurance, on the one hand,\nand insurance against other causes of unemployment, such\nas technological and economic change, on the other, an\nindividual who's doing a job who remains fully capable of\ndoing that job, but then loses the job because of economic\nchange or perhaps the job never existed in significant\nnumbers and the individual chooses to leave, is not unable\nto engage in that activity by reason of an impairment,\nwhich is the test under the statute for being entitled to\nbenefits.\nAnd it made sense for Congress to draw that line\nbecause if someone continues to function at a level\nsufficient to meet the demands of their previous work,\nit's virtually certain that they're capable of doing some\nwork whether or not that particular past job exists in\nsignificant numbers in the national economy. The point\nisn't that the person is expected to return to that\nparticular past job. Rather, it is their continued\nfunctioning at a level sufficient to meet the demands of\nthat job provides a highly accurate and administrable test\nof the fact that they continue to function at a level\nsufficient to meet the demands of work generally.\nIn a program that must resolve more than 2\nmillion claims a year, the need for that type of a highly\nadministrable test, that type of highly accurate test is\nparticularly acute. And this is precisely the type of\ntest one would have expected Congress to provide.\nA potentially large number of Americans today do\nnot work in jobs that exist in significant numbers in the\nnational economy. When those workers leave their jobs,\nwhether they quit, are fired for misconduct, or leave for\nother reasons which are good and sufficient, the court of\nappeals would preclude the commissioner from denying them\nbenefits based on their continued capacity to do that past\njob even if that job is still available to them, even if\nthe employer is on the phone begging them to return to the\njob. The commissioner reasonably construed the statute as\nnot compelling that result.\nIf there are no questions, I will reserve the\nremainder of my time for rebuttal.\nQUESTION: I have a -- a question about the\nconsistency of the argument you're now making with the --\nwith the commissioner's regulation concerning you don't go\nback more than 15 years. That seems to be a recognition\nthat even if a person can do the job that he or she did 15\nyears ago, yet there's a likelihood that maybe that kind\nof work isn't in abundant supply anymore.\nMR. LAMKEN: Justice O'Connor, the concern of\nthat 15-year --\nQUESTION: I'm Justice Ginsburg.\nMR. LAMKEN: Oh, Justice Ginsburg.\nThe concern of that regulation isn't whether or\nnot that particular past job exists in significant\nnumbers. It provides an administrable and in fact\nprophylactic test to make sure that the demands of that\njob are demands that are ones that are likely to be\nrelevant in the national economy.\nset of demands of a job would completely disappear from\nthe economy entirely during any one person's lifetime.\nBut to make assurance doubly sure, to make\nabsolutely certain, the commissioner has set forth an\nadministrable bright line, 15-year rule that says if the\njob is more than -- if you did the job more than 15 years\nago, we won't consider it out of that concern. But it is\nnot a consideration of whether the particular past job\nexists. It's a consideration to make sure that your\ncontinued ability to the demands of that job is an\nappropriate and accurate measure of your ability -- your\nlevel of functioning, and that your level of functioning\nis consistent with work generally.\nIf there are no further --\nQUESTION: May I ask this question just about\nthe facts of this case, Mr. Lamken? When this applicant\nsuffered her physical impairment -- I forget just what it\nwas now -- she was able to go out and find a job as a -- a\n-- an elevator operator. Right?\nMR. LAMKEN: That's correct. From -- if I\nremember correctly, from 1988 to 1995, she worked as an\nelevator operator.\nQUESTION: If the absence of elevator jobs had\noccurred earlier and she hadn't been able to find this\njob, she would clearly be disabled, wouldn't she?\nMR. LAMKEN: No, Justice Stevens, I'm not sure\nthat she would be found disabled. The commissioner would\nhave gone through the steps and -- and determined whether\nor not she had a severe --\nQUESTION: She would have made the fifth step.\nMR. LAMKEN: If you were not to consider the --\nthe previous work of an elevator operator and you only\napplied the fifth step, which is the other work step, in\nisolation, that's correct, that she would have been found\nnot able to do other work in the national economy. But\nthe fifth step is designed to work in conjunction with all\nthe other previous steps and, standing alone, does not\nnecessarily represent an accurate determination.\nCongress provided two conditions that must be\nmet, previous work and other work, precisely because the\nsomewhat abstract inquiry into other work that plaintiff\nhas -- the claimant has never done may not be a fully\naccurate or necessarily an easily administered mechanism\nfor determining the level of work that the claimant can\ndo.\nQUESTION: See, the thought that was running\nthrough my mind, just to put it on the table, is that in a\nsense perhaps the Government's position creates a\ndisincentive to look for other marginal jobs when you're\nin this position.\nlook.\nMR. LAMKEN: Justice Stevens, the commissioner's\nrules actually take into account incentives to look for\nwork through the unsuccessful work attempt regulations.\nAnd so that is something that has been dealt with. And\nthe same -- the same problem existed in the Walton case,\nfor example. It is unfortunate that sometimes people, by\nengaging in socially desirable conduct, going out and\nworking, will actually provide the evidence that shows\nthat they're capable of working, but that is just a\nnecessary consequence of a program that --\nQUESTION: Capable of working in a disappearing\nspecies of jobs.\nMR. LAMKEN: Well, Justice Stevens, the key\npoint about the court of appeals decision is not limited\nto cases of job obsolescence. It's any time somebody is\nworking in a job that may never have existed in\nsubstantial numbers. If they leave that job for whatever\nreason, if they quit or are fired for misconduct, under\nthe court of appeals rule, the commissioner cannot deny\nthem benefits based on their demonstrated ability to do\nthat job.\nQUESTION: Suppose in Justice Stevens'\nhypothetical the employer said, you know, you can operate\nthe elevator but it's just going to be going for 6 months.\nWe're rehabbing the building and after that -- it's just a\n6-month job.\nMR. LAMKEN: Right.\nQUESTION: Then -- then is she again barred\nunder step four?\nMR. LAMKEN: Justice Kennedy, that would -- it\nwould depend on whether or not that sort of a temporary\nposition would qualify as substantial, gainful work under\nthe commissioner's regulations. If it is a make-work\nposition or it's a position that does not represent\nfunctioning at a level -- it's a sheltered position or it\nis some other -- some other reason that it is not evidence\nof functioning --\nQUESTION: No, no. She can -- she can perform\nthe elevator job completely well.\nMR. LAMKEN: If this is something --\nQUESTION: Everybody knows it's a -- it's a job\nthat's soon to be obsolete, and she's told that.\nMR. LAMKEN: Justice Kennedy, I think --\nQUESTION: She'd be better off not taking that\njob.\nMR. LAMKEN: In terms of getting --\nQUESTION: Or suppose -- or -- or suppose she\ndidn't take that job. Would she then still be barred?\nMR. LAMKEN:\nJustice Kennedy, and the job represented functioning at a\nlevel that's consistent with work generally that is\nsubstantial, gainful work, she would be barred. And she\nperhaps might be better off not taking the -- taking a job\nlike that under the commissioner's regulations.\nHowever, the mere fact that somebody taking a\njob provides evidence that they function at a level that\nis consistent with past work doesn't mean that we should\ncome up with less accurate determinations by ignoring\ntheir demonstrated capacity to engage in their -- in their\npast work.\nIf there are no further questions.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. --\nQUESTION: One -- one -- just one further\nquestion. In -- in this case if she made it to step five,\nit wouldn't be just a question that the burden would be\nswitched to the Government, she would automatically\nprevail. Isn't that the case? Because of her age?\nMR. LAMKEN: That's correct, Justice Ginsburg.\nThe -- the way the commissioner's grids are set up, they\nmake various assumptions regarding the effects of age, the\nexertion levels demanded by particular jobs, and other\nmatters. And because it is a somewhat hypothetical\ninquiry to look into the many jobs somebody hasn't done in\nthe past, the step five inquiry sometimes will render --\nwill deem somebody not -- will deem somebody disabled even\nthough they actually can work.\nIt is precisely because of that reason that\nCongress provided two measures of capacity to work: a\nhighly empirical one, can the person do the jobs they\nactually have previously done in the past; and second,\nwhether or not the person can engage in the other jobs\nthat they haven't actually done in the past. And because\nthe two steps work more accurately together, that's why we\n-- one of the reasons we believe that Congress provided\nthose two steps.\nIn addition, it also preserves the line between\npeople who become unemployed because of their impairment,\nand ones who happen to be fully capable of doing their\npast jobs but lose those jobs for whatever reason, such as\neither technological obsolescence or they simply choose to\nleave those jobs voluntarily.\nIf there are no further questions.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Lamken.\nMr. Alter, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ABRAHAM S. ALTER\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. ALTER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nToday the commissioner argues against its own\ntheme of providing a remedy when someone is disabled.\nCongress did, indeed, intend to make a\ndifference, to separate step four, previous work, from\nstep five, or other work, but Congress told us what that\nseparation is.\nAt the fourth step, previous work, age is not a\nfactor, education is not a factor, and prior work\nexperience is not a factor. This is simply because if a\nperson wasn't too old to do his job or her job in 1995, we\nassume they weren't too old to do it in 1996. If a person\nhad the requisite education and skill level to perform the\npast job in 1995, then they have the same skill level and\neducation level in 1996. And of course, prior work\nexperience is irrelevant at step four because we're\ntalking about the actual job that she did.\nWhat Congress didn't intend was to pretend that\na job that doesn't exist can still be used to deny\nbenefits. Work has to be substantial. The commissioner\nconcedes that. It has to be gainful. The commissioner\nconcedes that. And it has to exist.\nQUESTION: But your -- no. It has to exist in\nsubstantial numbers in the national economy. What you're\n-- you're arguing that a job that does exist and that this\nparticular supposedly disabled person used to perform and\nwhich is offered to that supposedly disabled person but\nwhich that person turns down can, nonetheless, not count\nagainst the person's disability.\nMR. ALTER: That is correct, Justice Scalia.\nQUESTION: So it seems to me it's your position\nthat -- that presents a really extraordinary situation.\nLet's say I'm a juggler, and I become disabled. And --\nand the circus I was a juggler at comes and says, you\nknow, we -- we want you back. We can't find another\njuggler. There aren't that many because there are not\nthat many juggler jobs in the national economy. Okay?\nAnd I turn them down. I say, I'm tired of juggling. And\nyou say that I'm handicapped even though my -- my prior\njob is -- is right there waiting for me. That seems to me\nan extraordinary result.\nMR. ALTER: That is exactly what I'm saying,\nJudge Scalia -- Justice Scalia. I'm sorry. And the\nreason I say that is because a person is not disabled or\nnot disabled at any one step of the sequential evaluation.\nYour Honor's question focuses on the immediate reason for\nthe disengagement of the person from the workforce.\nThat's not the commissioner's position. That hasn't been\nthe commissioner's position. A person is not disabled or\nnot disabled because of Ringling Brothers calls them on\nthe phone and says, please, come back.\nby operation of the sequential evaluation.\nAnd the commissioner is the one who promulgated\nthe sequential evaluation. And the sequential evaluation\nis a recipe with alternating steps regarding medical and\nvocational factors. And --\nQUESTION: The commissioner has explained that\nit's -- using this test, can you perform your most recent\njob, as a proxy for instead of testing people to see the\nrange of light work that exists in the economy. They say,\nwe're just using this as a shorthand because it's\nadministratively convenient. And it's not using it to\nsay, this person can do this job that's obsolescing,\ntherefore she is not disabled. This particular job is a\nproxy for other jobs that require the same skill level.\nNow, what's wrong with taking that position\ninstead of subjecting people to a whole battery of tests?\nMR. ALTER: Justice Ginsburg, your rendition of\nthe commissioner's argument is exactly correct. If I were\npermitted to ask a question, I would ask myself a proxy\nfor what. It is a -- the job doesn't exist. So,\ntherefore, her ability to do the job --\nQUESTION: In substantial numbers in the\nnational economy.\nMR. ALTER: National economy.\nQUESTION:\nfor her to take.\nMR. ALTER: Correct, but in most cases it\nwouldn't be open for her to take. That's the extreme\nposition where -- and that's our position that happened in\nthis case. And that's a very extreme position. And it\nwould be an unintended consequence of the statute.\nBut Your Honor is absolutely correct that that\nis their position, that past work, even if it doesn't\nexist in substantial numbers, is a proxy for her ability\nto do other work. What other work?\nAt the fifth step, she's disabled because she\nwould not be able to make an adjustment to other work\nwhich exists in substantial numbers in the national\neconomy, according to the commissioner's statistics.\nQUESTION: Well, it's not according to the\ncommissioner. It's according to the statute.\nCan -- can we focus on the -- on the words of\nthe statute? It says that the mental impairments --\nphysical or mental impairments are of such severity that\nhe is not only unable to do -- not only unable to do his\nprevious work, but cannot, considering his age, education,\nand work experience, engage in any other kind of\nsubstantial, gainful work which exists in the national\neconomy.\nNow, you want to take that last phrase, which\nexists in the national economy, and attribute it to the\nearlier phrase, previous work. But if that's what\nCongress meant, why wouldn't they just have said that he\nis unable, considering his age, education, and work\nexperience, to engage in any substantial, gainful work\nwhich exists in the national economy?\nYou -- you want to effectively read the first\nphrase, is not only unable to do his previous work, right\nout of the statute. They may just as well have dropped\nit. We don't read statutes to contain words that are\ntotally superfluous, and you have made them totally\nsuperfluous.\nMR. ALTER: On the contrary, Your Honor. The\nwords, any other kind, would be superfluous. Congress,\nindeed, intended to make a difference between previous\nwork and any other kind of work, and that difference is,\nbesides age, education, and prior work experience, which\nare irrelevant at step five -- they wanted to have the\nburden on the claimant for disability to show at the first\nfour steps that she is disabled.\nAt the fifth step, it is the commissioner who\nmust show that she isn't disabled. And that's why the\nwords, which exist in the national economy, are in there\nto begin with because what they wanted to preclude was the\ncommissioner saying, well, you can't do your prior job,\nbut you can be a juggler.\nQUESTION: Well, you see -- can we go back for a\nsecond to Justice Ginsburg's question? Does this -- I\nmean, your reading of it is a possible reading, I -- I\nagree. But they're saying their reading makes\nadministrative sense.\nNow, this is my understanding of it. A person\nhas a bad back. Now, there are bad backs and bad backs,\nbut it's not a good thing to have. So she has a bad back,\nand we want to know how bad it is. And they're saying if\nit's very bad, she automatically is going to get the money\nbecause at step three they'll look and see and say, look,\nthis is a pretty bad back. It meets our criteria. That's\nthe end of it.\nBut if it's medium bad, then what they're going\nto say is, well, first question is can she still do her\nlast job as an elevator operator. And if the answer to\nthat question is yes, that's the end of it.\nAnd, therefore, if the answer, however, is no,\nthen we've to go and gear up our vocational experts. Are\nthere dolls' eyes' sewers? You know, they have a few odd\njobs they usually bring in here --\nMR. ALTER: I know.\nQUESTION: -- to show they exist in the national\neconomy.\nthat rigmarole.\nSo for a medium bad back, if you can still do\nyour previous work as an elevator operator, you're not\nthat handicapped. That's the end of it. Go to the\nunemployment office. Don't go to the -- the health\noffice.\nNow, what -- that to me makes sense. Now, what\nto you doesn't make sense?\nMR. ALTER: Oh, it doesn't make sense at all\nYour Honor, to me, obviously.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: No, no. Well, go ahead.\nMR. ALTER: Your Honor's question seems to make\nstep four, previous work, a gauge as to how severe the\nsevere impairment is.\nQUESTION: Exactly, and I think they suggest\nthat might be so.\nMR. ALTER: And -- but step four, previous work,\nis a remedy that the commissioner can use for their\nconvenience. Why look at every job in the national\neconomy? Let's start here and see if that medium bad back\nwould preclude her from her past job. But to what end?\nSo that she can resume that job. It seems to me, Your\nHonor, that once --\nQUESTION:\nend because it's the unemployment office that's concerned\nabout people who are out of work because you don't have\nelevator operators in the economy anymore. That -- it's\nnot the Social Security office, they say, which is\nconcerned about people who are physically hurt or mentally\nhurt.\nMR. ALTER: Number one, Your Honor, Pauline\nThomas could never collect unemployment insurance because\nthe first thing they would ask her, are you ready,\nwilling, and able to work? Do you have any medical\nproblems? Once she has a severe impairment, at step two\nthe unemployment argument, issue, or -- or controversy is\nover. Once she shows -- because that's the threshold.\nWhen the -- when the statute says, by reason of a\nmedically determinable impairment, it doesn't mean\nexclusively for medical reasons. But once she shows that\nmedical impairment, to who? To the satisfaction of the\ncommissioner. Once the commissioner says, yes, you have a\nsevere impairment, then vocational issues, such as, okay,\nyou can do a job, but does the job exist, become paramount\nbecause the -- the purpose of the statute, it seems to me,\nis to provide a remedy.\nNow, there are two remedies that are possible\nafter this sequential evaluation process. Remedy one,\nthere are no jobs existing in significant numbers in the\nnational economy that you can do. So here's your\nbenefits. Remedy two, you know what? There are jobs\nexisting, whether it's your job, whether it's another job.\nAnd therefore, we've done you a favor. We've told you\nthat the economy can accommodate you after your injury.\nTherefore, go get that job.\nQUESTION: Mr. Alter, if --if we think the\nstatute may have certain ambiguities in it, why don't we\nowe deference to the Secretary's regulations and\ninterpretation, which has been pretty consistent through\nthe years?\nMR. ALTER: There are three answers to that\nquestion, Your Honor. First of all, I'm -- I'm\ncrestfallen that -- that the Court would find that there's\nambiguity. But given that -- that they would --\nQUESTION: If we think there is.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: And if we're not crestfallen.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Pick up your crest and go on, Mr.\nAlter.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. ALTER: If the statute is ambiguous, the\ncommissioner's construction must still be reasonable.\nHere, I would say it is not reasonable. That's the first.\nBecause it -- it begs reality. The reality is this job\ndoesn't exist in substantial numbers. Or at least, we\nwant to be able to show that at an administrative hearing.\nQUESTION: Mr. Alter, how do you deal with the\nfact that a number of circuits and, indeed, three judges\non this en banc court thought exactly that, that this was\nan ambiguous regulation, that it had been applied\nconsistently by the Secretary, and that it was entirely\nreasonable, the -- the notion that your current work is a\nproxy for can you do light work, that that's a -- not a\nnecessary or inevitable one, but a reasonable one?\nMR. ALTER: Justice Ginsburg, first, let me take\nthe -- the last part of your sentence. Proxy to do light\nwork. She wins at light work at step five. So again,\nit's a proxy to do light work.\nQUESTION: No. Step five in her case we've\nestablished is an automatic. It's not that she's shown\nthat she can't do light work. The commissioner says,\nlook, when you get to be 55 years old, we're not going to\nmess with that. If you can't do your prior job, that's\nit.\nMR. ALTER: But it's the reason why, Your Honor,\nbecause she can't make an adjustment to any jobs. If a\nperson can do light work, that proxy issue, she can do her\npast job which is light, then she can do other light jobs.\nBut the commissioner tells us that she won't be able to\nadjust to other light jobs. And will she be able to\nadjust to her current job? There is no adjustment to a\ncurrent job, unless the job doesn't exist.\nBut to answer your question about the other\ncircuits, the other circuits -- circuits focused on the\nregulation, focused on the ruling, 82-61. That says,\nwell, it doesn't make a difference whether the job exists.\nIt's whether you can do that job. And most of the other\ncircuits said, well, the regulation says do your past job\n-- a strict reading of do your past job means the capacity\nrather than a reality standard. But they didn't focus on\nthe statute.\nAnd if I might answer Judge -- Justice\nO'Connor's question about ambiguity, if I haven't answered\nyour question.\nQUESTION: No, you haven't because there's\nanother piece of it. For the future, regulation that\ndoesn't apply in your case, the -- the commissioner has\nclarified that what we mean is can you do the physical\naspects of this job and we don't look to see whether it's\nan obsolescing job, a brand new regulation that doesn't\napply to your case.\nOn your argument, I take it -- you're going now\nback to the statute -- that new regulation is an\nimpermissible construction of the statute.\nMR. ALTER: That is exactly correct, Your Honor.\nMay I, Justice O'Connor, answer your question?\nThe deference owed to their -- the commissioner's\nconstruction of the statute is not much. It's Skidmore\ndeference.\nQUESTION: What?\nMR. ALTER: Skidmore deference, Skidmore v.\nSwift.\nQUESTION: Oh, I thought you said Skinmore.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. ALTER: Chevron, the -- the great case, the\nelephant in this room -- Chevron has a two-step policy.\nThe first one has been precluded by Your Honor's question,\nwhether the statute is ambiguous. The second part says,\nwell, it owes great deference to the commissioner's\nposition, but not, Your Honor, in a construction of a\nstatute. It is this Court's role to tell us what the law\nis and what the law means.\nQUESTION: Now, what does Chevron amount to? I\nmean, if -- if you're -- it struck me always that the --\nthe first step is is the statute ambiguous, and second, if\nit is, is -- is the construction reasonable. It is by\ndefinition a construction of the statute you're talking\nabout in the second step.\nMR. ALTER: Yes, Your Honor, but I believe under\nU.S. v. Mead the Court did make a distinction between a --\nan administrative policy --\nQUESTION: But Mead was -- but Mead was not a\nChevron case.\nMR. ALTER: Mead was a construction by an agency\ncase, and Mead says, I think -- my -- my reading is that\nif a -- an administrative policy is at issue, great\ndeference has to be given. But a construction of a\nstatute -- an agency does not have deference, great\ndeference, because of administrative --\nQUESTION: I -- I rather thought that's what\nChevron was all about. I'm interested that you don't\nthink so.\nMR. ALTER: Well, my reading, Your Honor, is\nthat Chevron deference will only apply to an agency's\nstatutory interpretation if it emerged from a formal\nadjudication.\nQUESTION: I certainly don't see that in Mead.\nI -- I mean, I understand that there have been views\naround taken from the dissent I think, that maybe that's\nwhat it says, but when I read it about 17 times now --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: -- it didn't seem to say that. I\nmean, it said that -- that certainly if they have formal\nproceedings, that would be a strong ground for thinking\nthat we would apply Chevron. And if they didn't, it\ndoesn't mean we won't. Did you get all the double\nnegatives?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. ALTER: I understand. All I can do is\nassert that if Chevron means that if we find some sort of\nambiguity in a Federal statute, we give pretty much carte\nblanche to the agency. That was my reading of Chevron.\nThat would be a disappointing reading of Chevron because I\nthink --\nQUESTION: If it's reasonable. If the agency\nhas given it a reasonable construction. And from former\nquestions this morning, the suggestion is that the\nregulatory approach is kind of an administrative shortcut\nfor finding out whether this employee is basically able to\ndo certain types of light work.\nMR. ALTER: I would argue, Your Honor, that it\nis not reasonable in any -- by any stretch of the word\nbecause may I remind, Your Honor, that we're talking about\na job which may not exist at all, and a finding that a\nperson is not disabled because they're capable of doing a\njob that doesn't exist can't be reasonable. If we take --\nI -- I say that --\nQUESTION: Why is that? What does -- what does\ndisabled have to do with doing a job? I mean, disabled is\na -- is a physical condition, and they say if you can do\nthe job you used to do, you're not disabled.\nMR. ALTER: Your Honor --\nQUESTION: The word is disabled, not unemployed.\nUnemployment insurance is something different. It's a\ndifferent program. This program is not meant to provide\nfor unemployment. It's meant to provide for disability.\nMR. ALTER: But what I meant --\nQUESTION: And all the -- all the Secretary is\nsaying is if you can do your prior job, you're not\ndisabled. That seems quite logical to me. I --\nMR. ALTER: Let me try to highlight the\nillogical parts of that then, Your Honor.\nUnemployment has nothing to do with this\nlitigation. The person has a severe impairment. As a\nmatter of fact, let's be precise. The person has cardiac\narrhythmias. The person had a heart attack and returned\nto work. The person had a -- a herniated disc and\ncervical radiculopathy. According to the commissioner's\nconstruction here, the only job in the world that she\ncould adjust to is a job which may not exist.\nOnce she has a severe impairment, Your Honor can\nbring up unemployment for the rest of the session, but\nunemployment is a red herring in this case because once\nyou have a severe impairment, we're not talking about\nunemployment anymore. We're talking about --\nQUESTION: Then she should -- we should have\nended it at step three, but the commissioner makes a\ndistinction. And her impairment, because it wasn't on the\nchart, doesn't make it. She is not at that point\ndisabled. You have to go on to the next step. If she\nwere disabled, that would be the end of it and we wouldn't\n-- but she isn't disabled under this formulation because\nshe's not within the conditions that that's the end of the\nexamination.\nMR. ALTER: Justice Ginsburg, your question and\nJustice Scalia's question seem to me to define disability\nin a vacuum. She is disabled -- she isn't disabled\nbecause she can do a job. Suppose she can be -- she be --\nshe can deliver ice. That job doesn't exist anymore\neither. Suppose she could be a court jester. Disability\nhas --\nQUESTION: You're the one that -- that is tying\ndisability to employment, not -- not Justice Ginsburg and\nI. And -- and yet, you keep saying that -- that\nunemployment insurance is a red herring. You're the one\nthat keeps bringing it in. You -- you say we can't tell\nwhether the person is disabled unless the person can get a\njob, but that's not the statutory requirement for\ndisability.\nMR. ALTER: Your Honor, I am not saying that a\nperson is disabled unless they can go get a job. What I'm\nsaying is that disability means that a medical impairment\nprevents you from adjusting to work which exists in the\nnational economy.\nQUESTION: And they are saying, to take your\nexample, if you're a former iceman and you're still strong\nenough to deliver ice, you're probably able to do other\njobs. What is unreasonable about that, even if there's no\nice delivery anymore?\nMR. ALTER: Because at step five, when the\ncommissioner says that you cannot adjust to other jobs, I\ntake them at their word. Statistically, according to the\ncommissioner's sequential evaluation, according to the\ncommissioner's vocational rules, there will not be an\nability to adjust to any other job which exists in the\nnational economy.\nQUESTION: And -- and at the point at which you\nget to step five, you've already found that the person\ncan't deliver ice anymore. So there has already been a\nfinding of some disability to some degree irrespective of\nthe capacity to go to a nonexistent job. I mean, the --\nthe proxy determination has already been made before you\nget to step five. Isn't that right?\nMR. ALTER: That is correct, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: That's what step four is there for.\nMR. ALTER: That -- that is correct, Your Honor,\nbut we keep getting back to that proxy, that word proxy.\nWell, even if your job doesn't exist, it's a proxy for\nyour ability to do other jobs. But what other jobs?\nQUESTION: Well, if you're an -- first of all, I\ndon't know why it doesn't exist. We have elevator\noperators in this building.\nMR. ALTER: Yes, Your Honor. I gave her my\ncard.\nQUESTION: All right. So -- so, I mean --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: It points out a certain unrealism. A\nperson who works in an elevator is a pleasant person, and\nthey sit down for some of the day and they're up --\nstanding up for some of the day. And they have to see\nthat people get on and off properly. It requires a degree\nof intelligence. It requires a degree of personality. It\nrequires a certain degree of skill. And so there -- you\nwould have thought there would have been a lot of other\njobs like that in the economy. And, I mean, even if there\naren't too many elevator operators, there are some.\nI mean, I'm trying to point out the realism that\nthey say exists behind their -- their assumption there.\nAnd it's pretty hard. We're talking about -- it's really\nhard to find an example that fits the category you want to\nsay this is in.\nMR. ALTER: Your Honor's question about the\nelevator operator is a -- a serious one because an\nelevator operator we have in this Court pushes buttons.\nYes, there's personality involved, but I -- I don't think\nthat one of these individuals would be denied this job if\nshe didn't have a sterling or -- or a wonderful\npersonality. She pushes buttons. That's not what my\nclient did. My client operated an elevator.\nThe reason we have elevator operators in this\nbuilding, I'm assuming, is to add to the majesty of the\nbuilding, for security purposes so I don't wander up and\ndown the halls where I'm not supposed to go. There are\nelevator operators in luxury buildings which really act as\nsecurity or helping people with parcels.\nThis person pushes a button, and she's here for\na reason, which really has nothing to do with what my\nclient was doing. She was opening a gate and opening a\ndoor, et cetera, and pushing the actual buttons, and\noperating -- well, you've -- everyone has seen an elevator\noperator from the old days.\nThe point is -- the point is that all we want to\ndo is show -- an opportunity to show what every SSI\nclaimant can show. I believe it was Justice O'Connor who\n-- who asked is there a difference between the regulations\nin title II and title XVI, and my colleagues said\ncorrectly, no, there aren't.\nHow about this? How about Pauline Thomas never\nworked a day in her life? She was on welfare her whole\nlife. She doesn't have a step four. We treat people\nunder this construction who have worked, as Pauline Thomas\ndoes -- and I promised her I would say this, so I'm going\nto say it -- for 27-and-a-half years, 110 quarters of\ncoverage. And she paid in all that time, sweeping and\ncleaning, and mopping bathrooms in a nursing home, and had\na heart attack and went back to work. We don't treat her,\nunder this construction, as well as we treat a person who\nnever worked a day in her life because then she\nautomatically goes to step five where she's disabled.\nThat's the first prong.\nThe second thing -- I don't know if the Court\nhas an actual transcript, but how do we treat this person\ndifferently? Pauline Thomas will get -- this controversy\nis about $672 a month in disability benefits after 27-and-\na-half years. If she had not worked a day in her life --\nQUESTION: Mr. Alter, can we go back to one\nthing that you said I don't think was quite right? You\nsaid all we want is an opportunity to show. That's not\nso. If you get to step five, you win, and the Government\nhas conceded that. You don't have to show anything. So\nyou're looking for -- you say if -- step four, if she\nprevails on that, that is the end of the inquiry. You\nwill not -- it's not incumbent on you to show anything.\nMR. ALTER: In this particular case, if we get\nto step five, we will win. But what we want to show is\nnot -- obviously, Ms. Thomas wants the benefits and I want\nto win the case. But what we would be showing is that\npast work is not a proxy for another kind of work if the\npast work doesn't exist because we want to be able to show\n-- it's what we already know -- that the commissioner says\nthat there is no ability to adjust to another job. Here,\nif her job doesn't exist, she will have to adjust to\nanother job whether we call it her past job or not.\nWhat I want to --\nQUESTION: She did work at this job for -- well,\n7 years, did she not?\nMR. ALTER: Correct.\nQUESTION: Because she -- at one point in your\nbrief, you said that she had been an elevator operator.\nAt page 42, you said for a few months. That was wrong.\nMR. ALTER: A few years, Your Honor. I'm -- my\nmistake.\nAs I was saying, if she went and applied for SSI\nin New Jersey, she would get $583.25 as we sit here right\nnow. So the difference between the 27 years of work and\nno work is, number one, she has a better chance, because\nshe doesn't have to go through step four; and number two,\nshe gets another $80. That construction leads to a\ndisengagement between the worker who's paying the freight\nso that the commissioner can have their convenience and\ntheir construction and the actual program. The program\nmust reflect reality. Disability is a word, but it's a\nconcept that comes after the commissioner has put in place\na sequential evaluation. And that sequential evaluation\nis based on the realities of the workplace. It has always\nbeen.\nAs a matter of fact, may I point one thing out\n-- two things actually. Number one, the commissioner\ndoesn't call it past work. The statute calls it previous\nwork. The commissioner calls it past relevant work. What\nis more irrelevant than a job that doesn't exist? Number\none.\nNumber two, the commissioner says that there are\nno vocational considerations at step four. We don't care\nabout whether the job exists or not. But that's not the\ncase because the commissioner's own ruling states for a\nfact that if you can't do your past job as you performed\nit, we can still deny you benefits at step four by saying\nthat we -- you can do your past job as it's performed in\nthe national economy. That's a vocational consideration.\nI never performed that job that way. My job is much\nharder. Yes, but when we look into the dictionary of\noccupational titles, we find your job and many jobs are\ndone in a lighter version. You can do that job. But I\nnever did it before. Vocational considerations.\nSSI claimants have more rights and make the same\nmoney as disability claimants. There's something wrong\nwith that in terms of public policy.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Alter.\nMR. ALTER: Thank you.\nQUESTION: Mr. Lamken, you have 19 minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. LAMKEN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. LAMKEN: Thank you.\nFirst, I wanted to point out that step four in\nfact is a measure of severity. The question is how severe\ndoes the impairment have to be, and the statute tells you\nexactly how far -- how severe it has to be. It has to be\nso severe that the claimant is unable to do his previous\nwork. So the step four inquiry of previous work is a\nmeasure of severity, and the commissioner has consistently\nused that measure of severity to determine whether the\nindividual is functioning at a level that is consistent\nwith work generally.\nSecond, in terms of the deference to which the\ncommissioner's construction is entitled, this has been the\ncommissioner's current construction from the outset of the\nprogram, both from before this -- the particular\nprovisions we've been discussing were adopted in 1967 and\nafter. We believe that they're clearly reflected in the\ncommissioner's regulations from 1978, and any -- any\nambiguity in those regulations was cleared up in 1982 with\nrespect -- by the issuance of SSR 82-40.\nThe commissioner's current regulations, which\nbecame effective September 25th, now make it abundantly\nclear and explain in absolutely certain terms that the\ncommissioner does not consider whether or not the previous\nwork exists in significant numbers in the national\neconomy. Because that is the result of a rulemaking,\nbecause it is clearly the commissioner's well-considered\nand longstanding interpretation of the statute, it is\nentitled to deference.\nQUESTION: Those regulations were subject to\nnotice and comment rulemaking?\nMR. LAMKEN: Yes. In fact, there was a very --\nthere was a lengthy comment period, and then they went\nthrough the entire process and were issued quite a few\nyears actually after the comment period was completed.\nBut yes, those were not -- notice and comment rulemaking,\nJustice Ginsburg.\nIn fact, the clarification came in in response\nto a public comment that particular issue wasn't -- was\ngermane to the rulemaking, but it wasn't one the\ncommissioner had initially planned to address. But a\ncommenter said, please clarify that in fact you do\nconsider whether previous work exists in the national\neconomy. And the commissioner said, no, no, you've got it\nwrong. We do not consider it. Our longstanding view has\nalways been we do not consider whether previous work exits\nin substantial numbers in the national economy.\nQUESTION: Mr. Lamken --\nMR. LAMKEN: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- could you clarify something? I\nasked this of -- of Mr. Alter, and I -- I didn't quite\nunderstand his -- his answer. Do you understand the\nrespondent's position in this case to be anything other\nthan saying that the statute means it could be abbreviated\nto read this way, that he is unable, considering his age,\neducation, and work experience, to engage in any kind of\nsubstantial, gainful work which subsists in the national\neconomy?\nMR. LAMKEN:\nhave the effect of completing the two separate inquiries.\nQUESTION: Well, eliminating the first entirely,\ndoes it not eliminate the first entirely?\nMR. LAMKEN: The one thing that -- that it\nwouldn't take into account is that in the first inquiry,\nthe commissioner does not take into -- in the previous\nwork inquiry, the commissioner does not take into account\nage, education, and work experience. And your formulation\nwould make age, education, and work experience relevant to\nall work, previous work and past work. However, we\nbelieve that if Congress had intended --\nQUESTION: Well, but -- but if he was doing his\nprevious work, it is impossible to find that considering\nhis age, education, and work experience, he couldn't do\nit. I mean, it's --\nMR. LAMKEN: I -- I think that's precisely\nright. It makes it -- as a --\nQUESTION: It's an impossibility anyway.\nMR. LAMKEN: Right. As a structural matter, it\nwould make it relevant, but in fact it would be rarely, if\never, a factor the commissioner would use in terms of\ndenying disability benefits. So it does definitely have\nthe effect of taking what Congress set out as two separate\nconditions precedent and merging them to a degree which\nCongress probably did not intend.\nFinally, for 45 years in adjudicating more than\n40 million claims -- and that includes approximately\n200,000 step four, that is, previous work denials a year.\nThat's 500 denials a day for every day of every year --\nthe commissioner has consistently applied this\nconstruction. That construction has functioned well\nthroughout all these years. Accordingly, we ask the Court\nto reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and to\nreinstate the commissioner's construction.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Lamken.\n"
