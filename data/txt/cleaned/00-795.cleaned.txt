CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument
now in No. 00-795, John Ashcroft versus the Free Speech
Coalition. Mr. Clement.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice and may it
please the court: In 1996 Congress updated the child
pornography laws to keep pace with technological
developments. Congress extended the existing prohibitions
on visual depictions of actual children engaged in
sexually explicit conduct to cover virtually
indistinguishable images in material pandered as child
pornography. These provisions are constitutional for the
same basic reason that other laws prohibiting child
pornography have been upheld. They protect real children
from real abuse.
They do so in two important ways. First, by
preventing the publication and production of materials
that are as effective as traditional child pornography in
seducing children, and second, by allowing the government
to effectively prosecute cases involving traditional forms
of child pornography.
First, these provisions allow the government to
attack material that poses the same risk of enticing
children into illicit sexual activities and to pose for
child pornography as traditional child pornography.
The government has a clear and compelling
interest in targeting such material; indeed, this court in
Osborne against Ohio used that rationale to uphold Ohio's
prohibition on the possession of child pornography.
Second and equally important, the government has
a clear interest in promoting the effective prosecution of
the traditional laws against traditional forms of child
pornography. The advent and increasing availability of
computer technology has allowed individuals to generate
computer images that are virtually indistinguishable from
traditional photographs. This allows criminal defendants
to inject reasonable doubt arguments into virtually every
case.
QUESTION: Has any case, to your knowledge, been
lost on that ground in which that was a substantial
argument?
MR. CLEMENT: No case has been lost on that
ground but that is largely a result of the 1996 Act, which
has taken that argument away from criminal defendants.
And to give you one very specific example, the case that
the Fifth Circuit heard in the Fox case, United States
against Fox which is one of the cases where the lower
courts upheld this law in an as applied context, the
government's expert witness, Special Agent Barkhausen was
forced on cross-examination to admit that she could not
tell definitively whether or not the image was of a real
child. Now that concession prior to the 1996 Act would
likely have been fatal to the government's prosecution.
QUESTION: Was that because she couldn't tell
whether the real child was over 18 or under 18 or because
she couldn't tell whether it was a real person?
MR. CLEMENT: That case was because she couldn't
tell it was a real person.
QUESTION: Wouldn't she have the same difficulty
on the distinction between an 18-year-old and a
19-year-old?
MR. CLEMENT: In the cases where the line that
the courts are concerned with is the line between 18 and
19, there's an additional aspect of the statute that
clears up many of the problems and that's the affirmative
defense which allows individuals to produce and distribute
materials if they make clear they involve actual
individuals who are over 18.
QUESTION: But in terms of what you outlined, in
terms of the two dangers, you say just the same as if it
were an actual child. Well, if it's a very young adult
who looks like a child, it seems to me everything that you
said about the virtual pornography would apply to a young
adult who looks like a child.
MR. CLEMENT: That's certainly true, but I think
Congress in recognizing an affirmative defense for
materials that were produced using people who had reached
the age of majority struck a balance and recognized that
this Court has provided additional protection to
pornographic depictions involving actual adults.
QUESTION: Okay, well the question of the
balance raises the question of tailoring, and what I
wanted to ask you was if it's appropriate to have the
affirmative defense that the children or that the people
depicted were in fact over 18, why isn't it equally
appropriate to have an affirmative defense to the effect
that the depiction does not have anyone who is not a real
child under 18. In other words, if the government's
interests are protected by the affirmative defense in the
real child case, why shouldn't there be a comparable
affirmative defense for the simulation.
MR. CLEMENT: I think there are at least two
reasons for that differential treatment. One is with
respect to age that's a fact that's uniquely verifiable
and in a lot of contexts we recognize that somebody's age
is something that one can verify. And in fact what we're
really talking about in most of these cases where the
affirmative defense for age would be implicated are films
and the like where there would be witnesses who could
testify that somebody was of a particular age on a
particular date.
QUESTION: But in effect you're depending on the
witness to say that the actors here were in fact over 18.
Maybe they'll produce facsimiles of birth certificates or
maybe they'll produce children or whatnot. Why can't you
have the same evidence to the effect that there were no
real children being used in manufacturing the film?
You're depending on witnesses in each case.
MR. CLEMENT: Well, in most of the cases when
you're talking about somebody who's going to make the
claim that they actually generated the photographs
themselves, there will be no witnesses. But I think more
important than the presence or absence of witnesses is --
QUESTION: But that's a question of proof and I
suppose that if the only person who steps up to the stand
and says, there were no live children here, is the person
who was accused of the pornography, that person may have
something to worry about in not having a very convincing
affirmative defense. But that's the defendant's problem,
not the government's problem.
And so I don't think that answers the question,
why if the government is sufficiently protected with the
affirmative defense in the one class of cases it wouldn't
be in the other.
MR. CLEMENT: And I do think that age rather
than whether an image is computerally generated is
something that is uniquely subject to verification and
this Court in its Ferber decision confronted the argument
that the New York statute was overbroad because it didn't
limit its protections to photographs and images that were
produced in the state of New York.
And the court rejected that overbreadth argument
for two reasons; one, that it would be virtually
impossible for anybody to prove what was the state of
origin for the photo. And I think the same analysis
applies for a computer generated image. The second reason,
of course, was that even materials --
QUESTION: Why is it -- why is it that witnesses
can explain the age but cannot explain whether it was
computer generated?
MR. CLEMENT: Because, again, in sort of the
stylized case that the person who's computer generated an
image, that's not something that requires a film crew to
be brought in so there aren't necessarily going to be
witnesses. In the case --
QUESTION: But that's not the government's
problem. I mean, that may be the problem of the person
who has the burden of proof to carry on the affirmative
defense and if it is a problem then the government is the
-- in effect going to be the winning party in resolving
that problem, but like Justice Stevens, I don't see what
is essentially unique in the probative process to acclaim
that it was a computer generation rather than a claim that
the kid shown was over 18.
MR. CLEMENT: Well, I'm not sure it's absolutely
unique but I do think age is uniquely subject to
verification. And if I could get to the second reason
that this Court pointed out in Ferber why you didn't need
to have a limitation just to pictures generated in the
State of New York, the Court recognized in footnote 19
that those materials, even if produced outside the State
of New York, pose harms and potential risk to children
inside the State of New York.
QUESTION: Mr. Clement, may I ask you a question
again relating to the affirmative defenses or youthful
adult pornography. There appears to be no affirmative
defense for possession of something that in fact used
adults, is that right?
MR. CLEMENT: That's right as a matter of the
statute. There's no express affirmative defense for
possession.
QUESTION: Well, let's relate that to something
that perhaps a number of people in this courtroom have
seen. The film, Traffic, which depicts I guess someone
who purports to be under 18 engaged in conduct that would
fit under the definition of the statute to be banned,
right.
MR. CLEMENT: I believe that's true.
QUESTION: Did you see it?
MR. CLEMENT: I did see it.
(Laughter.)
QUESTION: Okay. So presumably it would be
covered. Now, there is no defense to someone who rents
the movie, they possess it, no affirmative defense.
MR. CLEMENT: There's no affirmative defense for
possession but I think what the statute does is it
effectively makes it so that in virtually, in the vast
majority of cases where the producers and distributors of
a film will be able to claim the affirmative defense, the
individual possessor will be able to claim the affirmative
defense because of a failure of the government's ability
to prove scienter, because if you think about the
affirmative defense it gives people the ability to
distribute a movie if it involves actors. But if they
have the right to distribute a movie that nobody can
lawfully possess, it doesn't give them much, that's not
much comfort to them.
QUESTION: I don't understand. I mean I buy at
the video store three films, Traffic, Lolita, and Titanic.
Each film has a scene of simulated sexual behavior by
17-year-olds, all right? I think that was the question.
The question is, why am I not guilty under your
interpretation of the statute of a federal crime for
possessing those three films?
MR. CLEMENT: There's two reasons. One is
precisely in order to deal with this anomaly that they
don't want to be producing a film that nobody can lawfully
possess, the affirmative defense gives an incentive to
producers and distributors to make it clear in the
marketing of the material that those scenes that you're
talking about were scenes that were produced using adults
or scenes used with body doubles, and so in that sense
through the marketing of the material they can make it
clear to people that it involved adults.
QUESTION: There is the defense for the
producer, but there isn't for the person who rents the
film. It's just I --
MR. CLEMENT: Exactly.
QUESTION: -- I'm struck by what we're supposed
to do with a statute like this.
MR. CLEMENT: There is a requirement, though,
that the government prove scienter with respect to age in
any prosecution for possession and I don't see how the
government could prove scienter as to age in the case of
these films where they're marketed in a way where it's
clear that they involve adult actors.
There's a second aspect in which this Court
could find the affirmative defense to cover individuals
and that -- individual possessors, and that is the statute
does give an affirmative defense for receipt and as the
government argued in its briefs that naturally would cover
possession incident to receipt.
What it doesn't cover, though, and why I think
Congress didn't have a blanket affirmative defense for
possession is it doesn't apply to somebody who receives
some material that's marketed in a way or has a disclaimer
that makes it clear that it involves adult actors, but
then the individual somehow modifies it, strips out the
disclaimer. In that case, the possession is covered by
the statute and I think rightly so.
QUESTION: Does it trouble you at all that the
statute would prohibit a motion picture company from
employing an 18-year-old actress to play the three roles
that Justice Breyer identified?
MR. CLEMENT: Well, it would trouble me if the
statute had that effect but it doesn't have that effect.
The affirmative defense makes it crystal clear.
QUESTION: Even though the actress is under the
statutory age, 18?
MR. CLEMENT: Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you said
18.
QUESTION: Would it trouble you that the statute
would prohibit an 18-year-old who is a child under the
statute from performing those three roles?
MR. CLEMENT: Well, I think it's 17, but in any
event it doesn't trouble me if it's a 17-year-old is
prohibited because they wouldn't be prohibited from
playing those roles if -- the studio would have two
options. They could either not include the sexually
explicit conduct which is all that's covered by the
statute, and I think it would be possible to have made the
film Traffic without involving simulated sexual activity.
But putting that to the side, the other option
is to use a body double and make it clear in the marketing
of the film that that's precisely what you've done.
QUESTION: I take it your answer to the question
if this afternoon I go out, go to the video store, buy the
three films and bring them home is, yes, I am guilty of a
federal crime.
MR. CLEMENT: Not at all. You could not be
guilty because the government could not prove scienter and
because you would have lawful --
QUESTION: What do you mean you can't prove
scienter? It says that it is a crime to buy, to possess a
film that has simulated sexual activity by persons who
appear to be under the age of 18. Well, I would tell you
right now, I think that film did contain simulated sexual
activity by persons who appeared to be under the age of
18.
MR. CLEMENT: And again --
QUESTION: I don't think it was real activity, I
think it was simulated, and I think they did appear to me
to be under the age of 18. So am I guilty or not?
MR. CLEMENT: You are not guilty for the two
reasons that I've said and let me just say that you would
have the same problem with respect to the statute at issue
in Ferber.
QUESTION: Mr. Clement, I'm not sure what
simulated sexual activity consists of. I didn't see any
of these movies.
(Laughter.)
QUESTION: They were pretty good actually.
(Laughter.)
QUESTION: One described in the briefs
supposedly was the shot of a juvenile, whether played by a
juvenile or not, from the waist up supposedly engaged in
sexual activity. Would you consider that to be covered by
the statute as sexually explicit conduct? I mean what if
it was just the hand?
MR. CLEMENT: Well, certainly if it was just the
hand and certainly -- I think there would be certainly a
number of ways --
QUESTION: Don't you think, I mean the
definition of sexually explicit conduct is and what the
statute prohibits is this conduct by minors under 17 or
younger, sexual intercourse, engaging in sexual
intercourse, bestiality, masturbation, sadistic or
masochistic abuse or lascivious exhibition of the genitals
or pubic area. Now, the government has not made the
argument that at least as applied to juveniles this is
unprotected speech anyway and consists of obscenity which
a state or federal government is free, if it wishes, to
prohibit?
MR. CLEMENT: To the contrary, the government
has argued throughout this case that it's all unprotected
speech because it's child pornography. And I think
QUESTION: Not because it's obscenity, you're
creating, you would have us create yet another category of
prohibitive, something that falls totally outside the
first amendment. Have you claimed, as Justice Scalia
suggested you might have, that at least some of this
material is obscene and therefore covered without regard
to any new, any child pornography catalog -- category.
MR. CLEMENT: Well, I want to be clear, I think
government would take the position that virtually all the
material covered by this statute is independently obscene,
but that's not how the government chose to regulate it.
QUESTION: If the scene of a head of a person
who the other information in the movie makes it appear
they're engaged in sexual intercourse and all that is seen
is the head of a male and a female kissing one another,
that would come covered by the statute.
MR. CLEMENT: No, I don't think that would be
covered by the statute.
QUESTION: Why not? It's simulated sexual
intercourse.
MR. CLEMENT: I think you have to read the term
simulated sexual intercourse in conjunction with the other
terms in the statute.
QUESTION: It expressly says there's no patently
offensive requirement.
MR. CLEMENT: That's certainly true but I think
if you read the statute in context, I think there's some
requirement that the sexual intercourse that would be
depicted would require some display of nudity in the
process. Certainly -- well, it doesn't -- it may not say
that and the statute itself may not address that case.
And I would suggest that the proper way to resolve that
case is in an as applied challenge. Wait for the
government to bring that prosecution. In fact, I think
the government won't bring that prosecution. I mean, it's
interesting to talk about the film version of Lolita and
the like but that involves just a tiny fraction of
materials covered by this statute, and if you want to bet
--
QUESTION: Ferber pretty much said that child
pornography is of almost no value, did it not?
MR. CLEMENT: Absolutely, and that's why this
material that we're talking about is all probably
virtually, the government could capture it as obscenity
but of course if it tried to do that it couldn't ban the
possession, and child pornography was treated as a
different case in Ferber.
QUESTION: Child pornography is a different case
but very much like obscenity.
MR. CLEMENT: Absolutely, like obscenity, what
this Court said in Ferber is the reason the statute was
permissible is because it defined a category of conduct
that could be proscribed and was outside the protection of
the First Amendment.
QUESTION: There's a vast difference between an
actual child who was violated and a picture, a simulation
in Ferber that you have relied on so heavily, what do you
make of a sentence that is not in the footnote, it is the
text, that simulation outside the prohibition and the
prohibition was using an actual child, simulation outside
the prohibition could provide an alternative?
MR. CLEMENT: Well, let me just clarify one
thing because the statute in Ferber itself also covered
simulated sexual activity so all these line drawing
problems about what, you know, at what point does the
scene in Traffic come under the coverage of the statute
also applied in Ferber because it also captured simulated
acts involving adults. So the only difference between the
coverage of this statute and Ferber is that this statute
does attempt to prohibit materials that do not involve
actual individuals but are virtually indistinguishable
from --
QUESTION: Yes, but even that sentence in Ferber
said we're not touching in this case, here we have an
actual child simulation outside that prohibition could
provide an alternative.
MR. CLEMENT: With respect, I don't think that's
what Ferber meant to say. I mean, Ferber, after all, was
decided in 1982.
QUESTION: It used those words. It used those
words.
MR. CLEMENT: It did, but it was decided in 1982
before this technology even existed. And interestingly,
if you look at footnote 20 in the Ferber opinion the Court
went out of its way to invoke the general doctrine that
you don't apply cases before they arise and you don't
adopt a rationale any broader than necessary to decide the
case before it. And it just seems to me --
QUESTION: What if we read that sentence as
though it were not there?
MR. CLEMENT: No I think you read it in the
context --
QUESTION: Not in the opinion.
MR. CLEMENT: -- with respect, I think you treat
it in the context of what was prohibited by the New York
statute and the technology that was available at the time.
And I think what's important here is any avenues for
speech that were left open in Ferber are left open by the
statute in conjunction with the affirmative defense. The
only materials that are covered by the statute and not
covered by Ferber are materials that didn't exist at the
time of Ferber and it seems to me that Congress is
entitled to update the tech -- the pornography and
obscenity laws to deal with technological developments.
The first federal obscenity statute in 1842
didn't cover photographs because the technology wasn't in
widespread use at the time. Subsequently Congress added
photographs to the cover to the obscenity statutes because
technology developed and new problems arose.
QUESTION: The Court relied very heavily on the
notion that if you use actual children they are harmed,
they are actually harmed, so what is the primary reliance
that you make for applying the same prohibition to these
video images?
MR. CLEMENT: Well I think there's -- I would
make two responses. First, I think this Court has never
strictly limited itself to the protection of the child
depicted in the image and it recognizes that legislatures
in Congress have an interest in protecting all children
but secondly --
QUESTION: It did seem to me that the Court, and
I was here, played heavy reliance on harm to children.
MR. CLEMENT: Absolutely.
QUESTION: Actual children. So I'm asking you
what is your primary reliance when you don't have that?
MR. CLEMENT: Well, I don't know that we have to
answer that question in this case because we do have that,
because this statute enables the government to continue to
prosecute effectively cases involving traditional forms of
child pornography, because the advent --
QUESTION: But that's not an answer to Justice
O'Connor's question. Basically we're talking here about
overbreadth and the government's argument seems to be that
since there is a class of materials that we can proscribe,
the fact that it's overly broad is the respondent's
problem. But the law works the other way around, you have
to show that this statute is precise as to its coverage
and that it covers no more and let's just for argument's
sake, although I don't think that's the law, concede not
substantially more than what can be prohibited. And
Justice O'Connor's question was directed to this latter
problem and it seems to me you're not answering the
question.
MR. CLEMENT: Well, I'm trying to and I think
that, I mean, first of all, even in an overbreadth
challenge the burden does lie on the party challenging the
statute and they have to show things from actual fact in
order to challenge the statute and I don't think they've
carried that burden.
Second, this statute is responsive to the
problem of protecting both the children depicted in the
image and all children who can be seduced or enticed into
this kind of activity can be depicted themselves.
QUESTION: But the gravamen of her question,
Justice O'Connor can explain her own question, but as I
understood it, is that there's a substantial area here
where adults who are play acting roles of children are
covered, and the question is what is the government's
interest in that?
MR. CLEMENT: There isn't an interest in those
play acting cases and that's why the affirmative defense
allows those to take place. But again, the question is as
you indicated substantial overbreadth and these questions
we're talking about, about Traffic and the film version of
Lolita really are a tiny fraction of the cases covered by
the statute.
QUESTION: Why is it that the question I really
would like you to get to if you can is one that's really
bothering me very much is the question that Justice Scalia
asked and the thing in this area I do not understand, in
the entire area is why doesn't Miller work? There is
obviously a set of materials which Justice Stewart used to
refer to as I know it when I see it and that material does
not have at its object communication. It has at its
object a certain activity which is not communication. Now
that's all over our society, and why, given this Court's
decision in Miller, is that so? And if I knew the answer
to that question I would be better able to deal with this
kind of case.
MR. CLEMENT: Well, let me first try to say two
reasons why I don't think Miller is directly relevant and
if those aren't responsive to your questions, maybe --
QUESTION: I'd rather not hear why it's directly
-- not directly relevant because my question, which is my
own problem, not your problem, is I'm trying to understand
the area. There are several cases in this area coming up,
this is not the only one, and I want to know from the
government why it is, you've read in this area, maybe you
just should direct me to an article. The problem I
personally am having as a judge is I think what Justice
Scalia was driving at, maybe, that's his question, is why
doesn't Miller work. Now maybe you'll tell me that it
does, but that's contrary to my experience because it
seems to me I see much material that would have flunked
Justice Stewart's test all over the place. And it seems
to me that that's the material that parents are worried
about their children getting a hold of.
Now, if I knew why Miller was insufficient to
deal with that problem I would know better how to deal
with this kind of a case.
MR. CLEMENT: Well, one reason that Miller is a
difficult case and doesn't -- isn't terribly satisfying is
it requires a case by case adjudication of that
three-prong test which I would say with deference is not
self-defining. And what Congress decided to do in this
context is follow the lead of Ferber where it said that
Miller wasn't the test of child pornography and defined a
much clearer class of material that whether or not it
applies in Miller, whether or not the work as a whole is
implicated, this is a definable class of material that is
outside the protection of the First Amendment.
If you have concerns about the Miller test then
you really should seize upon this statute and Ferber and
the analysis in Osborne as one way to deal with that
problem because here's a test that doesn't rely on
community standards or other difficult considerations to
apply in practice. It has a test that says when we're
talking about visual depictions only, we're not talking
about novels here, and we're talking about material that
depicts children engaged in sexually explicit conduct then
we don't have to look to the value of the work as a whole.
You can put all the Shakespeare around these visual
depictions you'd like and they're still visual depictions
of children engaged in sexually explicit conduct.
QUESTION: Mr. Clement, before you finish
there's something of great concern to me too because it
seems that this is a big step away from actual child,
injury to an actual child to the effect on the viewer and
the same thing could be said for women with respect to
pornography, portraying women in a degrading way. The
same thing could be said for hate speech. So this, where
there is no actual child victim, where it's a picture and
you're talking about the effect of that on the viewer, why
isn't it the same for all these other things that can have
a very bad effect on the viewer?
MR. CLEMENT: Well, I think there are two
principal reasons why you shouldn't be worried about that
particular slippery slope. One is this Court already put
one foot down that slope in Osborne when it relied on the
seduction rationale in conjunction with the concern for
the children who were depicted. And in the same way this
statute responds both to harm, potential harm, to other
children in the seduction rationale and to children
actually depicted because as a matter of practical reality
it's become very difficult for the government to prosecute
cases involving actual, traditional child pornography.
QUESTION: If you have this out you can use
simulated children, that will protect the actual children
from being exploited. Why can't you say one as much as
the other?
MR. CLEMENT: Because I think, as I indicated
before, there are real verifiability problems that don't
arise in the context of age that do arise in computer.
The second reason, though, I think that you have
to be less worried about the slippery slope in this
context is the government has consistently gone to the
courts and told them to interpret appears to be to cover
images that are virtually indistinguishable from
traditional child pornography. It doesn't seem to put this
Court on a slippery slope to say that material that is
virtually indistinguishable from material that's already
been held to be outside the protection of the First
Amendment also will be outside the protection of the First
Amendment.
QUESTION: Are you asking us to read that phrase
into the statute, the virtually indistinguishable phrase?
MR. CLEMENT: Well, the virtually
indistinguishable phrase already appears in the text of
the statute, it just doesn't appear in the operative
provision. So what we're asking you to do is to read that
term, appears to be, in light of the legislative finding,
where it's not just the legislative finding where it's
virtually indistinguishable.
QUESTION: You're asking us to construe the
statute narrowly to apply only to things that are
virtually indistinguishable from actual behavior, it would
eliminate cartoons and that sort of stuff?
MR. CLEMENT: That's absolutely right and that's
the position we've taken in all the lower courts.
QUESTION: Even the language that says conveys
the impression, you want us to give the same meaning to
that?
MR. CLEMENT: Well, I actually think that the
conveys the impression language could be given that
meaning but I think the conveys the impression language is
much less problematic from a constitutional standpoint if
you understand subsection D of the statute to be addressed
to pandering and in that context the concerns about
vagueness are much reduced because you're not going to be
focused on just the image, you're going to be focused on
the way it's marketed, and I think in that context it
won't be difficult to see whether or not it conveys the
image. I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time for
rebuttal.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Very well, Mr.
Clement. Mr. Sirkin, we'll hear from you.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF H. LOUIS SIRKIN
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. SIRKIN: Mr. Chief Justice and may it please
the Court: The petitioner's argument if adopted would
have three radical tragic consequences for First Amendment
jurisprudence. First in the name of protecting children
all visual messages of adolescent sexuality will be
forever barred regardless of their scientific, artistic or
educational value.
Second, countless visual depictions --
QUESTION: Excuse me, such as what? Such as
what? You know, I try to think what great works of art
would be taken away from us if we were unable to show
minors copulating or any of the other acts set forth in
the definition here. Can you give me a couple of
examples?
MR. SIRKIN: Certainly, in the film area.
QUESTION: Lolita?
MR. SIRKIN: Lolita, Traffic.
QUESTION: That would be a great -- leaving the
book, the movie Lolita, the book is perfectly okay, right?
This only applies to the movie?
MR. SIRKIN: That's correct.
QUESTION: The great work of western art.
MR. SIRKIN: It's gotten critical acclaim. The
movie Traffic, I think, won an Academy Award. There's the
movie Tin Drum.
QUESTION: What else besides the movie Lolita
would we be deprived of in order to prevent little
children from being exploited?
MR. SIRKIN: There's the movie Traffic, there's
the movie Tin Drum, there's a whole bunch of, you know,
there's the Brooke Shields movies that maybe some people
don't enjoy, but again it's there, the Blue Lagoon and the
series of movies such as that.
QUESTION: In respect, this is not, you know,
the Mona Lisa or Venus de Milo or anything that has lasted
more than 30 years.
MR. SIRKIN: It could very well affect, I think,
painters because the statute -- excuse me.
QUESTION: How about Romeo and Juliet? It
interprets one scene there that way.
MR. SIRKIN: It could, if the movie -- a movie
of Romeo and Juliet were made.
QUESTION: Gee, you've seen a different version
of that play than I have.
(Laughter.)
MR. SIRKIN: Well, it depends on how they wanted
to portray it. I think they would have to be prevented
from showing or simulated sexual activity because if they
are in fact, you know, to be considered to be underage.
And secondly, countless visual depictions of adult
sexuality will be prohibited where the adults depicted
appear to some unknown censor to be younger than 18. And
third, it would open the door to banning other forms of
expression simply because the expression could be misused
and/or abused by a small segment of society.
QUESTION: Very well, how should it be read?
How would you write the statute so that it did take
Justice Stewart's material that flunks.
MR. SIRKIN: One is, I think, enforcement of the
obscenity laws would be one way.
QUESTION: Apparently that doesn't work and
that's why I'm puzzled. And where children, where you're
depicting children engaged in this activity, let's say
that flunks the Algerian seaman test or whatever it was he
used to have.
MR. SIRKIN: Your honor, there's --
QUESTION: How is Congress to write a statute in
the area of children that gets at that problem, which is a
problem?
MR. SIRKIN: I believe that Title 18, section
2251 covers that problem. In the past there have been
numerous prosecutions, I think, prior to the passages of
this Act. In 1995 a member of the Department of Justice
testified before the Senate committee that heard evidence
about this statute and indicated that there had been a
conviction rate of over 97 percent in cases that had been
brought against people for the possession or dissemination
of material containing a depiction of a minor.
So that in fact has not been a problem in the
past and apparently in this all in umbrella statute where
they used any visual depiction, which in fact if you use
the terminology any visual depiction it's not just limited
to virtually indistinguishable --
QUESTION: You have no problem then with the
statute before it was amended.
MR. SIRKIN: I have no problem, this is a new
statute, 2251 and 2252 did exist.
QUESTION: What did it do? How did it change
the law?
MR. SIRKIN: It used the terminology, it created
a category of computer images that would be nonreal or
other pictures or images that are nonreal and that are
fictional characters into the act and it would be
prohibited if disseminated or possessed.
QUESTION: So, well, whatever was going to be
threatened in the way of free expression and so forth
under the new act was simply computer images of things
that were already prohibited if done by real people?
MR. SIRKIN: No it did not, it included, it said
any visual depiction, that would include that could be
considered cartoons, illustrations, drawings, paintings.
QUESTION: If the statute is construed to be,
say, virtually indistinguishable then I think cartoons
would not be covered.
MR. SIRKIN: But the problem is it would still
suffer from the vagueness because what would happen is
that in fact I had a computer image of a fictional
character I'd never have a defense because I could not
come forward and prove that that fictional character was
over 18. So if someone believed --
QUESTION: That seems way out at the fringes
somewhat.
MR. SIRKIN: Well but that leaves it to the
discretion. It may be that the current administration may
not enforce this language but down the road nobody knows
what will happen.
QUESTION: You could cross that bridge when you
come to it then.
MR. SIRKIN: Well, I believe when you begin to
talk about First Amendment rights to put it on to a case
by case basis I think you are abridging, you know, a
fundamental right and I think that in addition to that you
have the problem that if I get charged you're not just
being charged with a violation of an obscenity law, you're
being accused of being a child pornographer and that does
have some connotation and that has some ill effects just
from the fact of being charged. And I would have no
defense.
QUESTION: Well, does it cover things beyond
obscene speech?
MR. SIRKIN: Well --
QUESTION: In your view.
MR. SIRKIN: In this it does, it would cover,
you know, the morphing situation --
QUESTION: Excuse me?
MR. SIRKIN: I'm using the term morphing where
you use an identifiable and you can merge it in on the
computer to, you know, into similar --
QUESTION: Images of obscenity.
MR. SIRKIN: That's correct, or of a sexual act
--
QUESTION: That is the expansion, is covering
images of obscenity.
MR. SIRKIN: Well, it would be images, it would
be copying images of obscenity with an identifiable
individual or in sexual conduct and that is harm to a real
child because that person is an identifiable child and
that becomes a permanent record.
QUESTION: But does it cover depictions of
something more than obscenity?
MR. SIRKIN: Well, when you use the terminology
simulated sexual activity it would, you know, it depends,
I guess that goes community to community. But what you
have is like in the movie Trafficking where you have a
young lady under a cover with a man on top of her, you
only see their heads but, you know, the simulated means
the appearance of, and that in fact does give the
appearance and, you know, in that situation it is a
representation in the movie that that person is under the
age of 18 --
QUESTION: Don't you think the statute can
reasonably be read giving the definition of the activities
covered not to cover two people under a bed with no
depiction of sexual organs or anything else.
MR. SIRKIN: The problem is, is that the statute
uses the term actual sexual activity and/or simulated, and
again
QUESTION: It depends on what you mean by sexual
activity. If it's just a depiction without any indication
of the sexual organs it's certainly reasonable to say that
that isn't covered.
MR. SIRKIN: But that's not what the statute
says, though.
QUESTION: Well, the statute does say explicit.
Doesn't that cover what Justice Scalia --
MR. SIRKIN: No it doesn't, because it says
explicit sexual conduct, actual or simulated and I guess
it depends on how you read that word simulated.
QUESTION: You say explicit. What work does the
term explicit do?
MR. SIRKIN: It means clearly and again clearly
would mean to me that if it appears that they're under the
blanket and that's what they're doing I think it's a
reasonable inference to be made and I think that it would
cover that as simulated activity.
QUESTION: But explicit certainly can mean
something different than clearly.
MR. SIRKIN: It can, but it's not defined in the
statute. They could have gotten rid of the word
simulated.
QUESTION: Then maybe the courts will define it
so that it wouldn't cover the kind of thing you're talking
about.
QUESTION: It is defined in the statute,
sexually explicit conduct that was in quotes means actual
or simulated sexual intercourse.
MR. SIRKIN: And some other things, and it uses
masturbation and --
QUESTION: It includes sexual intercourse, it
seems to me it's sexual intercourse whether you see the
entire body or only part of it.
MR. SIRKIN: I agree with Your Honor that it
would be simulated if they're under the blanket and you
see the heads.
QUESTION: I think the question is whether you
could, a court could say well, to keep this within
constitutional bounds we will read into the statute this
broad requirement that there be an actual showing of
sexual organs.
MR. SIRKIN: You know, legislatures write
statutes, I think the courts interpret them and I think to
construe it you'd be basically rewriting the statute if
you did that, if you eliminated that terminology and I
don't think the government has urged that.
QUESTION: Am I not correct in remembering that
one of the amendments to this series of statutes by
Congress specifically eliminated the requirement of
patently offensive and the like?
MR. SIRKIN: They've done that in the child
pornography area a long time ago. They did that in Ferber
when they said that it, just if it merely is children
involved in sexual activity it's a violation of the law
and it's not subject to the three-prong test of Miller and
the patently offensive is a part of the Miller test.
QUESTION: Do you have any examples of the use
of computer generated images covered by this statute where
it has serious literary or educational value or scientific
value?
MR. SIRKIN: Well --
QUESTION: Do we have examples of that?
MR. SIRKIN: Today I don't know that we have
examples today of that. I mean, I would think that if we
convert the videos and the films that are being made today
into DVD, those are, that's a computer, digital computer
--
QUESTION: Because your concern is with the
expansion to these images of things that are already
prohibited and yet I don't think we have examples of any
serious use of them in --
MR. SIRKIN: Well, if I --
QUESTION: -- areas which would be of concern.
The examples that we've talked about today and that I
think you've identified seem to be of films using youthful
adults.
MR. SIRKIN: Well, that would be correct but I
think it's not, you know, too in the distant future that
we will be making films that will be virtual reality.
QUESTION: But they're their strongest argument
is -- I mean, I thought their argument is you're right,
those things you're talking about are not covered.
They're not covered today because everybody knows they're
not really under the age of 18, the actors. And tomorrow
if we have a new system we'll worry about it tomorrow on a
case by case basis. Maybe all they'd have to do is put on
the top these are not real, I don't know what they'd have
to do, but they're so few and far between that we
shouldn't strike the statute down on its face.
Now that's why I think people are asking you for
particular examples because if you have to make up an
imaginary example that doesn't really exist then maybe the
correct thing to do is say the statute shouldn't be struck
down on its face and we'll proceed case by case as a
reasonable literary or scientific virtue to a particular
thing. Of course the person can't be convicted. Now
that's case by case. I'm putting what I take it is their
argument here.
MR. SIRKIN: But the problem with that is it
creates a chilling effect because who's going to take the
chance? I mean that's it, if the government says if it's
close to the line I think the petitioners have indicated
in their brief that if it's close to the line then just
don't do it, you know, don't publish it, don't make it,
and that's censorship.
QUESTION: What about the other argument which
is look, we're trying to protect the real children who are
the subjects of the film and the reason we need this to
protect them is because there is no way for any expert or
anyone else to say when they see a film whether this is a
film of a real person or whether it is a fake film made
through virtual technology. The experts just can't tell
us.
MR. SIRKIN: Well, I think that becomes, you
know, an excuse.
QUESTION: Is it true?
MR. SIRKIN: It is not true.
QUESTION: All right. You think it is not true,
they think it is true. Is there somewhere in the record I
could look or some place I could find out as to what
experts think?
MR. SIRKIN: Yes, because I think you can look
at the Senate hearing report where it's indicated that in
1995 in relation to cases that were brought there was a
conviction rate of 97.6 percent. In addition to that, that
since the enactment of this law the government has not
lost a case and it was raised in the Kimbrough case and it
was raised in the Fox case, they were able to get a
conviction.
QUESTION: You say the congressional finding is
wrong then because the statute begins with, among other
findings, new photographic and computer imaging
technologies make it possible to produce by electronic,
mechanical or other means visual depictions of what appear
to be children engaging in sexually explicit conduct that
are virtually indistinguishable to the unsuspecting viewer
from unretouched photographic images. You say that that
congressional finding is wrong?
MR. SIRKIN: That congressional finding, I don't
think it was empirically, there was no empirical evidence
that was really shown to Congress that that is correct,
that the computer, and I believe, and I think it's clear
--
QUESTION: So you have both your opponent and
the Congress who think you're wrong on this point.
MR. SIRKIN: Yes.
QUESTION: Okay. But your point still is, I
take it is, even if in fact the Congress is correct on
that, there's no evidence that cases are being lost
because of this virtual indistinguishability problem,
cases involving real children.
MR. SIRKIN: That's correct. And I believe if
you want to make it easier for the government to make
convictions I think that we could get rid of the Bill of
Rights and it would be much easier for the government then
to get convictions.
QUESTION: Mr. Clement gave an example of
another case in which the government did obtain a
conviction but only because of the new statute in which
the government witness was unable to say.
MR. SIRKIN: That was that government witness.
That doesn't mean that there are not witnesses out there
and experts that can make that distinction that if, you
know, there clearly would be, pardon?
QUESTION: This was just a bad government
witness, you say?
MR. SIRKIN: It could have been. I didn't hear
the testimony in that case but they did in fact get a
conviction in that case. But I think it's equally as
dangerous to create a barrier to First Amendment.
QUESTION: Wouldn't have gotten a conviction if
the law had been what you want it to be, isn't that right?
MR. SIRKIN: We don't know they wouldn't have
gotten a conviction with that -- the testimony in that
case was that the expert indicated that he was not sure
and could not positively say whether it was real or not
real.
QUESTION: And on that basis can you find beyond
a reasonable doubt that it was a depiction of an actual
minor.
MR. SIRKIN: It creates an inference and a jury
can draw inferences from the evidence.
QUESTION: Suppose the law put the burden on
you, on the defendant to show that this depiction does not
use an actual child. The defendant, because of this proof
problem, is not brought out, the confusion is it a real
child, is it a simulation. Suppose it were made the
defendant's burden to show that no actual child was used
in this picture, would you have a constitutional objection
to that?
MR. SIRKIN: Yes, I would. And the reason being
is that at least in the possession area that is not an
affirmative defense because all it has to be in the
affirmative defense, there is no, the element of age, of
being able to come forward and show that it's not a real
child or that it's underage is not available --
QUESTION: Okay, let's assume that that too was
fixed. Those two features, Justice Ginsburg's and the
inclusion of the possession is subject to the defense,
would the statute then be constitutional?
MR. SIRKIN: I, the possessor though, you'd be
switching the burden of proof then I believe and I think
that would be an unconstitutional shifting of the burden.
QUESTION: Well, you'd be making, you be -- are
you saying that the affirmative defense therefore is, in
effect, has got to be constitutionally relevant across the
board?
MR. SIRKIN: I believe that it is. I think the
affirmative defense that's in this statute is
unconstitutional.
QUESTION: So there's no way to tailor it by
affirmative defense in effect is your argument.
MR. SIRKIN: That's correct.
QUESTION: And how would that affirmative
defense prevent some of the evils that the government is
trying to prevent, for example the seduction of minors to
sexual conduct by showing things that appear to be minors?
How would this, affirm -- the existence of this
affirmative defense still enable the government to do
that?
MR. SIRKIN: There are currently, there are
currently lots of laws that deal with anyone who attempts
to entice a child and I believe that those laws could be
enforced and I believe that the penalties could be
increased and that could be a deterrent effect on that.
We're talking about the use of this material potentially
by a very small segment of the population and I think it
affects --
QUESTION: Well, you could say the same thing
about a murder statute, you know, you don't expect a whole
lot of people to go out and commit murders but that
doesn't mean Congress can't legislate against it.
MR. SIRKIN: But here you can't legislate that
if it's not, if it's a virtual murder and there has been
no murder, you don't go out and arrest people. Here if
you use a virtual, a fictional character you can go out
and arrest people.
QUESTION: Well, if you want to talk about a
very small portion of the population I would think there's
a very small portion of the population that wants either
to produce or to watch adolescents and children engaging
in sexual conduct of the sort described in this statute.
You're dealing with a small portion of the population to
begin with.
MR. SIRKIN: But if you use the principle that's
involved here then I do believe you begin the slippery
slope. You go from the idea you can use this and expand
it, you can use it, you know, that if you have depictions
such as, you know, the movie the Godfather, the movie Pulp
Fiction which are cult, you know, movies that are
attractive to children, someone could come out and say,
hey, look, join my gang, look how much fun it can be if we
go out and become extremely violent.
QUESTION: What's worrying me about what you're
saying now is that if their factual hypothesis is true,
which I tend to doubt, but I'm not an expert, that there
is no technical way to distinguish between a photograph of
a real child and an imaginary child, if it were true,
there is no expert who could tell you the difference and
you tell me I can not have an affirmative defense, then
the government cannot prosecute real child pornography.
MR. SIRKIN: I think they can --
QUESTION: Because there would be no way to
prove beyond a reasonable doubt that it was a real child.
So if you deny the government the possibility of the
affirmative defense weapon you are denying them the
possibility of prosecuting real child pornography.
MR. SIRKIN: That's not correct because they've
been able to get convictions and they've gone forward and
they've gotten convictions.
QUESTION: Well, presumably people think that it
is possible to distinguish between the real child and the
virtual fake.
MR. SIRKIN: But I don't believe, you know, at
least currently they've not lost any of the cases and
there's only been the one where someone has raised the
issue and that expert had indicated that they weren't
sure.
QUESTION: I think what you're doing is in
effect varying the question, you're saying, look, in the
real world it doesn't happen, they can tell. But if you
assume the hypothesis that Justice Breyer started with,
the factual hypothesis that if these are well enough made
you can't tell the difference, then doesn't it follow that
if you rule out the affirmative defense route for the
government, the government simply won't be able to prove
the case in the instances in which real children are being
used.
MR. SIRKIN: I'm going to go back and I'm not
begging the question, again, if I have, if there is
virtual murder that looks so real on the screen, I don't
go out and charge anyone with murder.
QUESTION: Well, we can distinguish attraction
to other forms of socially damaging behavior from that
particular category of social -- socially damaging
behavior that has for hundreds of years been treated as
obscenity. I don't think there's any risk of the Court
suddenly declaring that excessive violence constituted
obscenity. We know what obscenity is. There have been
laws against this particularly infectious kind of
solicitation to conduct for centuries. I don't know why
you think we're going to suddenly flop over into
prohibiting the Godfather because that also portrays
socially undesirable conduct.
MR. SIRKIN: If you take the logic that's behind
here about people, you're getting at the person who is
misusing the material and there certainly I think is, you
can't even do medical --
QUESTION: Sexual material in a category called
obscenity which has traditionally for hundreds of years
been regulable by government.
MR. SIRKIN: But the obscenity here we're making
just because it's a fictional character visually
participating in an activity that I can write about, we're
now saying you cannot express, that we're saying, we're
giving it a social status, and I think when we start to do
that then we start to eliminate, we can start eliminating
other areas equally.
I further believe that, you know, as I've
indicated, that the affirmative defense seems to be
inadequate. It certainly does not cover the individual
possession and that individual is in a position where if
he has three images, if he gets a DVD movie and he takes,
and it has more than three images in it, he's now, you
know, can be prosecuted for possession of child
pornography. And, again, with the definition, when you
put it together with the definition of simulated.
I think that it is not narrowly tailored, it is
overly broad because I think, again, it covers literary
material, it carries certainly for medical research, one
cannot, there is no bona fide exception here for medical,
scientific or educational or artistic merit, it's a
blanket across the board prohibition. I believe the Court
clearly indicated in Ferber --
QUESTION: But what if we accept the
government's limiting construction, the government is
urging that we use this, take the congressional finding,
read it into the text of the statute and then it would cut
out all the good things.
MR. SIRKIN: I believe that the Court has
indicated in the past in Turner Broadcasting and in the
landmark communications case that it's not for the Court
to be rewriting statutes as they come out of Congress and
particularly in the area when it deals in areas of First
Amendment. And I think that the Act, you know, and what
we're proposing here --
QUESTION: Supposing that -- suppose we could
consult Congress, they would say yeah, preserve as much of
this as is constitutional. We wanted to do a whole lot
but if the constitution only allows us to do a little we'd
rather have the Court say that than to throw out our
entire product.
MR. SIRKIN: All we're asking is, is the Court
sever out two phrases and that is that is, is it appears
to be and that it, you know, and where it conveys the
impression that a minor is engaged in sexual activity.
QUESTION: Well, in X-Citement Video we did
something not too different from this, reading in a
requirement that wasn't express in the statute.
MR. SIRKIN: You did read in the elements of
knowingly and you have to do that. Basically the
government is doing the same thing in this particular
statute because the knowingly appears in this statute
exactly as it appeared in the statute that was interpreted
by the Court in X-Citement Video. It says knowingly in
relation to mailing or to transporting, it doesn't say
knowing as to the knowledge of the particular minority.
QUESTION: But that's an example of a case where
there was a First Amendment challenge where we have read
something into a statute that we might not necessarily
have done.
MR. SIRKIN: The Court has the power to do that.
QUESTION: And there's precedent for our doing
it.
MR. SIRKIN: Yes, in X-Citement Video the Court
did do that. But we're urging here that the fact is that
the Ferber and Osborne were based upon the harm to real
children and we're now limiting something because of the
message. We are socially making a determination here that
this is speech we don't like.
QUESTION: Are you saying that if real children
are not used in the depiction of simulated sexual activity
that it cannot be barred unless it meets the Miller
standard?
MR. SIRKIN: Yes. It would mean --
QUESTION: Eight year olds, ten year olds,
twelve year olds.
MR. SIRKIN: They're fictional characters,
because I think they do have a valid use in medical
research.
QUESTION: Suppose you said -- suppose you said
-- suppose I -- I don't know how I'd do it, suppose I
could draft a statute which had a medical research
exemption.
MR. SIRKIN: It would make it narrower.
QUESTION: Would it be constitutional?
MR. SIRKIN: Again, I'd have to see the whole
statute and, again, I think that it would depend on how it
works and whether it still had the problems with the
affirmative defense.
QUESTION: Suppose you took -- I just want to
follow up on what Justice Kennedy said. Suppose you took
Miller and said where you have clearly minors we as a
matter of law assume that it's patently offensive.
MR. SIRKIN: That could be done.
QUESTION: That could be done, you'd still have
the other two parts.
MR. SIRKIN: Yes, and I think that most
communities would feel, I think that all communities would
feel that that is patently offensive.
QUESTION: I wonder if Miller would work more
satisfactorily if you did that in the case of people who
clearly appear to be minors.
MR. SIRKIN: I believe that it would.
QUESTION: You think it would.
MR. SIRKIN: Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you Mr. Sirkin,
Mr. Clement you have one minute remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. CLEMENT: Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
Counsel for Respondent notes the 97 percent conviction
figure. Well, that reflects a couple of things. One, it
reflects that the 1996 Act has allowed us to prosecute
cases even where there is a reasonable doubt about whether
it is a virtual image or not. The other thing that the 97
percent conviction rate reflects is that we are not out
there prosecuting people who pick up Traffic at the
Blockbuster. It's no accident that the one court that
considered this case in a facial challenge struck the
statute down, but the four courts of appeals that
considered it in an as applied challenge upheld the
statute.
Those cases give you an illustration of what the
statute is really applied to. The Mento case involved
over 100 images of prepubescent children. The Acheson
case in the 11th Circuit
QUESTION: Is there any precedent that we judge
a free speech statute based on the kind of prosecutions
the government has been bringing?
MR. CLEMENT: There is precedent and the best
one I can think of is Ferber for waiting until as applied
challenges to deal with the fringe cases, the tiny
fraction cases. And I think, as in Ferber, if you wait
for those cases to be brought you'll find that they are
not brought in these cases.
Another point I think worth emphasizing is that
I don't think given that this statute only covers explicit
sexual conduct that there'll be much medical research
involved.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.
Clement. The case is submitted.
