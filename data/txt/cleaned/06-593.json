        "content": "(11:06 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in case 06-593, Long Island Care at Home versus\nCoke.\nMr. Farr.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF H. BARTOW FARR\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. FARR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn the 1974 amendments to the Fair Labor\nStandards Act, Congress made one thing very clear, that\nit wanted the Department of Labor to define the\nboundaries and fill in the details of the companionship\nservices exemption. And I think that has two important\nimplications for this case.\nFirst of all, when the Department has filled\nin the details, after notice and comment rulemaking, its\nregulations should receive Chevron deference as long as\nthey are permissible implementation of the statute.\nSecond, and particularly specific to this\ncase, if there are ambiguities in the regulations, or as\nwe have here, an apparent facial inconsistency, the\ncourt should accept the Secretary's resolution of that\nambiguity provided that it is a reasonable one. And\nhere we submit it's not only a reasonable one, it is by\nfar the most sensible one.\nNow I'd actually like to turn, if I may, to\nthe second issue first, because I think that's the\nsource of a lot of the concern in this case.\nPlainly the two regulations, section 10 --\n552.109(a), which is the regulation directly at issue\nbefore this Court, and 552.3, which is the regulation\nrelied on heavily by the Second Circuit to strike down\nthe present regulation, have some inconsistency between\nthem.\nBut it is also plain that the Department\ncould not have intended to say at one and the same time\nthat the only employers entitled use the exemption were\nhomeowners and then say in another section promulgated\nat the same time that also third-party employers are\nentitled to the exemption. So the question is, how does\none resolve this apparent inconsistency?\nAnd the Secretary says, well, the only\nregulation that we promulgated that, in fact, deals\nspecifically with the issue of third-party employment is\n552.109(a), which is in fact headed Third-Party\nEmployment.\nAnd that section 552.3, while containing\nsome language that might be read to address that issue,\nin fact deals with several other topics. Specifically\nit deals with the topic of what kinds of jobs are\ninvolved in domestic service, maids, chauffeurs,\nfootmen, et cetera; where those have to be performed, in\na private home; and in fact, somewhat more than that, in\nthe private home of the person receiving the services.\nSo it's not enough, for example, for\nsomebody to conduct a service like laundry or baby\nsitting in his or her own house, it has to be in the\nhouse of the person receiving the services.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the words were\nhome of the person who employs, not who receives the\nservices but who employs.\nMR. FARR: Oh, that's correct,\nJustice Ginsburg. The literal language is not\nspecifically what I was saying. What I'm talking about\nis the Secretary's attempt to resolve what is an\napparent inconsistency between the literal language in\n552.3 and the literal language of section 552.109(a).\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: By -- reading out the\nwords \"of the person who employs\" her?\nMR. FARR: Well, essentially reading them to\nsay they, they were not intended to address directly the\nsubject of third party employment which is the subject\naddressed in 109(a). And I think if one is -- even\nleaving aside the question of deference to the Secretary\nfor a moment, Justice Ginsburg, if one is simply talking\nabout making a fair resolution of these conflicting\nprovisions from the ground up, it seems to me the first\nthing that one would do is apply the canon that the\nspecific provision controls the general.\nAnd if one looks at the two provisions,\nsection 109(a) is a provision that deals with one thing\nand one thing only: that is third party employment.\nAnd it says explicitly and straight out that\npersons who are employed by third-party employers are --\nor third-party employers who employ persons performing\ndomestic services are entitled to the exemption.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I thought it also\naddressed, unlike the more general regulation, just\npeople who have companionship services. So if you have\na maid or a cook or a footman, who doesn't provide\ncompanionship, then 109 is inapplicable.\nMR. FARR: That would be true. Now that\nwould be inapplicable --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What's a footman? I don't\neven know what a footman is.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What is a footman?\nMR. FARR: I think that may be beyond my\nexpertise, Justice Scalia.\nThe -- of course that doesn't address\nanything beyond companionship services, of course,\nbecause there is not an exemption beyond that. And\nthat's one of the interesting things about 552.3. In\naddition to generally dealing with this question of what\nkind of jobs are domestic service, it is, in fact, going\nwell beyond anything that is necessary to a discussion\nof the exemption for companionship services, because\njobs like chauffeurs, and maids, and all of that are not\nsubject to the exemption. So it really looking at what\n552.3 is doing despite the couple of words that -- at\nthe beginning of it, is giving a general definition of\nwhat constitutes domestic employment, what constitutes\ndomestic services for purposes not only of the exemption\nbut, in fact, really for the purposes of coverage as\nwell.\nAnd the Department has taken that position.\nIt says this is, in fact, the only definition of\ndomestic service that we have in the regulations, and it\nis not just intended to be limited to the particular\nsituation of the exemption. It applies more broadly\nthan that to coverage as well.\nSo I think in all those senses,\nJustice Kennedy, 109 is a very specific provision, 552.3\ndeals with a number of other subjects.\nNow, one other thing on the statutory\ninterpretation part is that the reading of 552.3 that\nRespondent offers also leads to the problem that\nessentially sets up a tension with another one of the\nregulations which is 552.101(a). 552.101(a) which I'm\nsorry -- I don't have the right page number here -- it\nis on page 77a of the appendix to the petition -- has,\ncarries over the language from 552.3 about in the home\nof the employer that Justice Ginsburg referred to. But\nthen it also says that this includes people who are\ncommonly referred to as private household workers.\nAnd the one thing we know from the\nDepartment of Labor submissions to Congress in 1974 and\nalso from what the Department has said before this Court\nis that that term at the time was defined by the\nDepartment and known by Congress to constitute more than\njust employees employed by the homeowner. There was a\nspecial second category for people who worked in the\nhome of the homeowner at the homeowner's request but\nwere employed by a third party agency.\nNow somewhere underlying all of this\nquestion, I think, is statutory interpretation and\nindeed all of Respondent's arguments against deference\nto the Department is a basic underlying premise, which\nis that Congress really would not have wanted, even if\nit didn't say so, for the exemption to apply to\nemployees who work for third parties.\nAnd I would just like to suggest that there\nreally is no basis for thinking that Congress would have\nwanted that.\nFirst of all, third participate employers\nsuch as private agencies provide services for the\nparticular group of people which Congress was trying to\nassist with this exemption. People who by reason of age\nor disability are unable to care for themselves.\nAgencies acting as the employers specifically can do the\nhiring, they can do the vetting and the screening, the\nbackground screening for employees. They can provide\nnecessary paperwork, filing Social Security documents\nand things like that.\nSo, in fact, for Congress to have some sort\nof bias against covered enterprises seems a little bit\nunusual.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Farr, I'm not sure I\nfollowed your argument with regard to 552,101(a).\nMR. FARR: Uh-huh. Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Page 77a as you said.\nBut what is your argument there? I mean,\nthat seems to, that seems to reinforce the provision\nthat you say we should ignore or at least should accept\nthe Secretary's reinterpretation of.\nMR. FARR: Well perhaps, perhaps I wasn't as\nclear as I intended to be. It does, as I indicated,\nhave the language about the private home of the\nemployer.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's right.\nMR. FARR: However, the -- the preceding\nsentence says the term, referring to the term that is at\nissue in 552.3, domestic service employment, includes\npersons who are frequently referred to as private\nhousehold workers. The fact is that those two\nstatements are inconsistent with each other. The term\ncannot be limited to employees of the home owner and\nalso include persons who are frequently referred to as\nprivate household workers, at least if one means all the\npersons referred to --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah. I see. Is that\nclear in the -- in the specific Senate report that is\nreferred to here?\nMR. FARR: In the specific Senate report, in\nboth the '73 and the '74 reports --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This, the one that's cited\nin the regulation itself. Because I -- otherwise, I\ndon't, I ignore those things. That's cited in the\nregulation. Does that report say it?\nMR. FARR: What? The report uses the term\nprivate households workers frequently interchangeably\nwith the term domestic employees. That is what is clear\nfrom the report itself.\nNow, the Department of Labor when it was\nreporting to Congress, as Congress has required it to\ndo, the Department of Labor used the term private\nhouseholds workers, specifically defined in there by the\nDepartment, to say this means not just employees\nemployed by the homeowner but also people who are\nemployed by third parties.\nSo I think it is a fair assumption that when\nthe Senate report was using that phrase, it was using it\nin the same manner that the Department of Labor reports\nhave. And, in fact, at one point in the -- moving\nfurther backward in the legislative history, Senator\nDominick actually quoted that language, the definition\nfrom the Department of Labor, on the Senate floor during\nthe debates.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that the\nDepartment of Labor's first take on this was that the\nexemption did not apply to third-party employers. That\nwas the original Department of Labor position, wasn't\nit?\nMR. FARR: No, Justice Ginsburg. I believe\nthat's correct. There was a, an opinion letter from the\nDepartment in November of 1975 -- this is an opinion\nletter that's cited at page 21 of the Solicitor\nGeneral's brief -- which specifically stated that the\nexemption applied whether the employee was an employee\nof the homeowner or of a public or private --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm referring to the\nnotice and comment rulemaking in which you place great\nstock. I thought the original notice and comment\nrulemaking said the exemption does not apply to\nthird-party employers.\nMR. FARR: I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg. I\nmisunderstood the time frame we were dealing with. In\nthe notice of proposed rulemaking, actually I would\ndisagree with that characterization also. The notice of\nproposed rulemaking made a division among third-party\nemployers. It said the exemption would not be available\nto those third-party employers who were covered\nenterprises but it would be available to those who were\nnot covered enterprises.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, wait. Does the\nnotice of proposed rulemaking set forth the agency's\nposition?\nMR. FARR: No, it does not.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't think it did.\nThey're just floating an idea. You know --\nMR. FARR: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Run it up the flagpole, see\nif --\nMR. FARR: Well, that it solicited comments\non that proposal. And after the comments, it changed\nits position to say no, in fact, all third-party\nemployers will be exempt.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And -- and there was no\nfurther discussion of it after -- after it sent out the\nnotice of proposed ruling that said third party\nemployees will not be exempt, and then it said they will\nbe exempt, did it give reasons for the change?\nMR. FARR: Yes, if I can just -- if I can\nquibble with the premise of the question. The first\ntime it said some third-party employers would be exempt\nand some wouldn't. Then when it changed --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Some would be the ones\nthat qualified as -- what is the phrase, enterprises\nengaged in commerce?\nMR. FARR: That's correct -- those would be\nthe ones under the proposed rulemaking that would have\nbeen denied the exemption. When in fact -- when, in\nfact, the Labor Department said no, in fact, the\nexemption should apply to all third-party employers, it\nsaid it found that more consistent with the statutory\nlanguage. And it also said it was more consistent with\nwhat it had done under other regulations which had been\npassed under the Fair Labor Standards Act.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Farr, would you agree\nthat the position expressed in the notice itself would\nhave -- in the original notice would have been\nconsistent with the statutory language?\nMR. FARR: I'm not sure of that,\nJustice Stevens, to be honest with you. I mean one of\nthe difficulties here in answering that is that I think,\nbecause the Department has such broad authority under\n213(a)(15) to define and delimit the term, I think\nwhat's consistent with the statute has expanded\nsomewhat.\nOn the other hand, I have to say I don't\nreally see where there would be in the language of the\nstatute any basis for drawing a distinction between\ndifferent kinds of third-party employers. The\nphraseology in the coverage provisions, the phraseology\nin the exemption provisions, really doesn't allow for\nthat in terms of any sort of statutory interpretation.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well there would be a\nbasis in terms of the size of the third-party employers.\nMR. FARR: I mean, it's possible, but as I\nsay, the -- I mean, among the difficulties that covered\nenterprises is not just corporations and big and small\ncorporations. Covered enterprises beginning in 1974\nincludes state and local governments. So what Congress\nwould have been addressing here, if it had been squarely\nfacing the issue, would have not just been the question\nof how to treat large and small corporations, but\nwhether it wanted to deny the exemption to covered\nenterprises such as state and local agencies who, in\nfact, do provide a lot of the direct employees who\nprovide companionship care. They have a lot of\nemployees who actually go into homes and care for people\nwho are employed by state and local governments. And I\nthink it would be a little bit unusual for Congress, who\nis reasonably solicitous of state interests, to deny\nthem an exemption that would have been of considerable\nimportance to them. As the State of -- or the City of\nNew York brief points out, this is a very extensive\nendeavor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Were they covered before,\nbefore there was any provision that dealt with household\nworkers? If state and localities were considered\nenterprises engaged in commerce, then presumably they\nwere -- they had no exemption before, their companion\ncare people, just as household workers, would be covered\nby the Fair Labor Standards Act.\nMR. FARR: No, but I think, Justice\nGinsburg, the important point is they were not covered\nprior to 1974. There were certain --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: They were not treated as\ncovered enterprises.\nMR. FARR: That's correct. They were --\nthey were, if they worked in schools or institutions\nlike hospitals. Other than that, they were not until\n1974. That's exactly correct. This, in fact, would\nhave been denying them an exception at the very time\nthat for other occupations aside from companionship\nservices, they were first having coverage applied to\nthem.\nIf there are no further questions, I'd like\nto reserve the remainder of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you Mr. Farr.\nMr. Salmons.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID B. SALMONS\nON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES\nAS AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING PETITIONERS\nMR. SALMONS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court.\nThe FLSA's companionship services exemption\napplies by its terms to any employee employed in\ndomestic service employment to provide companionship\nservices for the aged or infirm. The Act imposes no\nlimitation based on the identity of the employer. And\nthe Agency's regulation of 552.109 extending the\nexception to employees of third parties is entitled to\ndeference.\nThe Department expressly invoked its\nstatutory rulemaking authority in adopting Section 109,\n552.109. It utilized ed notice and comment rulemaking\nprocedures both in 1975 and each time it considered\namending the regulation. And States and care providers\nhave relied upon it in devising systems to provide\nappropriate services to the aged and the infirm.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if the Department\nof Labor had enacted its regulations as originally\nproposed, those regulations would have been invalid?\nMR. SALMONS: No, I don't think so, Your\nHonor. If you're referring to the initial proposed\nrulemaking that would have exempted only some third\nparties, we think that would have been a permissible\nreading of the exemption given the fact that the\nSecretary is provided very broad defined limit\nauthority. But we certainly think there's nothing in\nthat exemption that precludes the construction that's\nbeen adopted here. In fact, we think it is the most\nconsistent with that language.\nThe language of 5523 upon which Respondent\nrelies does not change that conclusion. While if read\nin isolation that language could require that domestic\nservice employees have to provide their services in the\nhome of the employer, it should be not -- it should not\nbe given that reading for the reasons explained in the\nDepartment's 2005 advisory memorandum.\nThe Department's construction of its own\nregulations contained in that memorandum is itself\nentitled to deference under Our and Seminole Rock and\nits construction harmonizes the various provisions at\nissue here far better than Respondent's reading of 553\ndoes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The statute treats\ntogether babysitters and elder care people, but I take\nit the babysitters if they were working for an agency\nrather than for the householders, there wouldn't be any\nexemption? Is that right?\nMR. SALMONS: That's correct, and that's\ntied to a specific term that only applies to the\nexemption as to babysitters. The only thing that's\nexempt with regard to babysitters is babysitting on a\ncasual basis. Congress certainly could have included a\ncasual basis requirement with regard to the exemption\nfor companionship services. We think it's very notable\nthat it did not and we read from that that Congress\nwanted all domestic service employees providing\ncompanionship services to be exempt, and we think that's\nmost consistent with the goal of ensuring that those\nindividuals who most need this type of care have the\nopportunity to receive them at a reasonable cost.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't it odd that this --\nthe basic thing about the '74 legislation, it was going\nto add to the Fair Labor Standards Act people who were\nnot covered before. So it added household workers. And\nyet you say that, while Congress had its mind trained on\nadding people, it also subtracted people who were\ncovered before, took them out, removed them from the\ncoverage of the Act.\nMR. SALMONS: Well, we think that that is\nthe consequence of the companionship services exemption,\nbut we don't think that's odd based on the Department of\nLabor's view of what the purpose of that exemption is\nand based on the textual difference between, for\nexample, the exemption for baby sitting services and the\nexemption for companionship services.\nThe exemption here expresses no limitation\nbased on the identity of the employer and we think it\nwas well within the agency's discretion to conclude that\nwhat Congress had in mind here was a categorical\nexemption based on the type of services that are being\nprovided; and while that may mean that there are certain\nworkers who are now exempt who were not previously\nexempt, that's because Congress for the first time in\n1974 focused on this problem of companionship services\nbeing provided to those who cannot care for themselves;\nand we think that follows from the text, and for the\nreasons Congress adopted that.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Salmons, can I ask you\na question about the importance of the whole litigation.\nAm I correct in believing that there's a provision in\nthe law that protects the defendants from damages\nliability if they relied in good faith on the\nregulation, so that what we're really talking about is\nwhether the regulation would apply in the future rather\nthan there being a damage issue in the case?\nMR. SALMONS: Well, there is a safe harbor\nprovision that allows for reliance by employers on a\nstatement by the agency.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That would clearly apply\nto this case, would it not?\nMR. FARR: We certainly think it would. I\ntake it Respondents in this case would disagree and\nwould point to the language of 552.3. I'm not sure, for\nexample, how the Second Circuit would have resolved that\nquestion, given the way it viewed the statute here. But\nwe do think that that would apply and so I think one\nview of that would be it's largely prospective.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So in your view we're\nreally faced with a question of whether the regulation\nshould be given prospective effect.\nMR. SALMONS: I'm sorry? What would be\ngiven prospective effect?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: As to whether the\nGovernment's position should be given prospective effect\nbecause the past liability doesn't -- the damage\nliability just doesn't exist.\nMR. SALMONS: Well, that is our view.\nAgain, I think that would be an issue that would be\nlitigated and I'm sure litigated heavily in the hundreds\nof cases that are being filed under this provision. And\nI think it's -- one of the concerns I think of the\nagency here was to provide a clear statement with regard\nto how these seemingly conflicting provisions of the\nregulation are to be reconciled and applied.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not seemingly\nconflicted. They conflict.\nMR. SALMONS: Well, I certainly don't take\nissue with that. I think that there are a variety of\nthings that point to the conclusion that the language in\n552.3 that refers to \"in the home of the employer\"\nsimply cannot be read literally. It was borrowed from\nthe Social Security context and if read the way\nRespondents do we think would raise a serious question\nabout the scope of coverage because the agency has\nalways viewed 552.3, notwithstanding the initial line\nthat says \"For purposes of the exemption,\" to provide\nthe relevant definition for coverage as well. And no\nparty, or amici for that matter, before this Court nor\nthe Department thinks that there's a difference between\nthe identity of the employer for purposes of coverage.\nAnd we also think, given the language in 101 that refers\nto private household workers, the definition of which\nwas provided to Congress in a report by the Department\nof Labor and is relied upon in the advisory memorandum\nin 2005, which clearly applies to third party employers,\nsuggests that 553 cannot be read literally.\nAnd of course we know that at the same time\nthat the agency adopted 552.3 it felt the need to adopt\na specific regulation dealing with the question of\nthird-party employment which would not be relevant --\nwhich would not be necessary under Respondent's reading.\nIf the Court has no further questions --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Salmons.\nMr. Becker.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF HAROLD C. BECKER\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. BECKER: Mr. Chief Justice and may it\nplease the Court:\nOn October 1, 1974, just five months after\nthe 1974 amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act took\neffect, the Department of Labor exercised its delegated\nlaw-making function to define this term \"domestic\nservice employment,\" which exists in the companionship\nexemption and nowhere else in the amendments. And they\ndefined its clearly and explicitly to apply only to\ncompanions and baby sitters employed by the household.\nAt the same time, DOL provided a persuasive\nexplanation for that definition. The Department found\nthat such companions and baby sitters when employed by\ncovered enterprises had been covered prior to the\namendments and that it could not have been Congress'\npurpose, when amendments were explicitly designed to\nextend coverage, to at the same time contract coverage.\nThe very preamble to the Act states that the purposes of\nthe amendments are to expand the coverage of the Act.\nTherefore, the DOL itself concluded in October of 1974\nthat it was not the purpose of those amendments to deny\nthe Act's protection to previously covered domestic\nservice employees.\nThe definition in 552.3, which expressly\napplies only to the exemption, conflicts directly with\nthe final third-party regulation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Was that later?\nMR. BECKER: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: How much later?\nMR. BECKER: The final regulations were\npromulgated in February of 2005.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no. I thought that the\nprovision that was -- what is the number -- - where they\nsay 552.109; that didn't appear anywhere until many\nyears later.\nMR. BECKER: No, no, Your Honor. That was\nin the final regulations, which were promulgated in\nFebruary -- excuse me -- in 1975, not 2005.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, you read --\nMR. BECKER: In the final regulations.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You read 3 and 3 says what\nyou said it says. All right. How much later did they\npromulgate 109?\nMR. BECKER: That was in the final\nregulations in February of 75.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The same time that\n552.3 was finally promulgated.\nMR. BECKER: That's correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They came out\ntogether, right?\nMR. BECKER: That's correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's what I thought. So\nthe same day they say, 3, you have to have these\ndomestic workers employed by the old lady who's sick,\nand then in 109 they say you don't.\nMR. BECKER: That's correct. There's a\ndirect conflict.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, why is\nthat a conflict? Let's imagine -- it sounds like a\nconflict. But it's easy for me to imagine a regulation\nthat says birds for purposes of this are animals that\nfly, and then 15 pages later it says, but by the way,\npenguins don't and they're still covered. I mean, why\nis that a conflict? There are lots of specific\nsituations. If I read that, I would have thought, well,\nokay, they have an exception.\nMR. BECKER: Your Honor, the definitional\nregulation, 552.3, explicitly defines a term used only\nin the companionship services exemption, \"domestic\nservice employment.\" And it defines it clearly and\nexplicitly to apply only to employment by the household.\nTherefore, there is a direct conflict with\nthe so-called third party employer regulation, which\nappears to say that the exemption can apply to employees\nemployed by third parties.\nThe importance of the conflict is twofold.\nOne, when the original regulation was proposed the\nDepartment provided a persuasive explanation. Congress\nsurely didn't intend to contract coverage in amendments\ndesigned explicitly to expand coverage.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Did Congress intend to\ncover, which I guess is a growing situation, that there\nis an old woman or man and they're very sick and they\nlive in their house, there's only one way to keep them\nfrom having to go to an institution. Their children\nhire a companion to look after them. Now, that's a\nthird party.\nMR. BECKER: Your Honor, that question has\nbeen posed by some of the amici and it is a good\nquestion, but not the question before you.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because?\nMR. BECKER: And I submit that if the\nDepartment construed section 552.3 to say when our words\nsay \"employed by the household\" that could include a\nbroader notion of the household, for example a son or\ndaughter living outside the household, that might be a\npermissible construction of the Department's own\nregulation. But the construction which simply takes\nthose words --\nJUSTICE BREYER: It doesn't say that. It\nsays \"about, in or about a private home of the person by\nwhom he is employed.\" I live in San Francisco. My\nmother lives in Massachusetts. Now, if I hire a\ncompanion to live in Massachusetts, that companion does\nnot work about a private home of the person, me, by whom\nshe is employed. So if we're being literal and if you\nwin this case, I don't see how -- and I'm worried about\nthis, obviously -- however -- and I think it's probably\nvery common, that all over the country it's the family,\nthe children, the grandchildren, an aunt, an uncle,\nmaybe a good friend, maybe they're not even related, who\nis paying for a companion for an old, sick person so\nthey don't have to be brought to an institution.\nAnd if you win this case, it seems to me\nsuddenly there will be millions of people who will be\nunable to do it and, hence, millions of sick people who\nwill move to institutions. Now, if I were to say that\nthat isn't totally a legal point, it is of course a\nlegal point because it's a question of what people\nintended, but a worrisome point, I would be telling the\ntruth. It is a very worrisome point.\nMR. BECKER: It's a very important question\nof public policy and therefore let me answer in two\nways. One, I think there is a proper procedure even\nunder the existing regulations to address that concern.\nThe elderly individual that you're concerned about who\nis severely disabled and thus needs this care, the child\nor family member who is employing the companion to care\nfor them could do so as their guardian, and therefore as\na technical legal matter would be doing so, the\nemployment would be by the person who resides in the\nhome.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It wouldn't take a whole lot\nof imagination for Justice Breyer to give the money to\nhis mother, who could then hire.\nMR. BECKER: Exactly.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, a clever lawyer\nwould think of that, I think.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BECKER: A clever lawyer could do this.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And perhaps there are\npeople, lawyers in the Government, who try to see\nthrough that kind of thing.\nMR. BECKER: But let me answer the second --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And there are many -- maybe\nJustice Scalia has the answer.\nMR. BECKER: Let me answer a second way to\nwhat is a serious concern. And the second way the\nsituation could be dealt with is by the Department of\nLabor. They could look at their regulations and say,\nthe industry has changed and therefore, in a way which\ncould certainly be consistent with Congress's intent\nbecause it would not be withdrawing coverage from a\npreviously covered employee who was employed by an\nenterprise, we could say that the exemption applies to\ncompanions and baby sitters employed by private\nindividuals, including the homeowner, the son or\ndaughter, etcetera.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You're saying it's\npermissible to change the rules because the industry has\nchanged. Is it not possible that the industry changed\nat about the time the statute was enacted? That the\nprevalence of third-party employers is something that\nreally developed later?\nMR. BECKER: As an empirical matter, that is\nclearly the case, Justice Stevens. However, we know\nseveral things about Congress in 1974. We know that the\nenterprise coverage was relatively new. They adopted it\nin 1961, expanded it in 1966, and indeed expanded these\nvery amendments in 1974. So Congress was aware of the\nprior coverage. We know that the Department of Labor,\nin the very reports which have been cited by the\npetitioner, stated both in January of 1973 and in\nJanuary of 1974 in their reports to Congress on the Act,\nstated that there was prior coverage of domestics\nemployed by third parties. We know there was\nenforcement activity by the Department of Labor against\nsuch third-party employers.\nSo while the industry has certainly changed,\nthere were enterprises who employed domestics, including\ncompanions, in 1974, and Congress was aware of it and\nstated over and over again in the preamble, in the\ncommittee reports, which indeed, the House committee\nreport said, \"Our intention is to expand the act to the\nextent of Federal power.\"\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How -- putting aside\n-- putting 552.109 aside, how is 552.3 a plausible\ninterpretation of the statute?\nMR. BECKER: Your Honor, we think it is the\nmost plausible interpretation for the following reasons:\nNumber one, contrary to what has been\nsuggested, the language in the exemption is not\nidentical to the language in the extension provision\nextending the minimum wage and overtime requirements.\nThere is an important difference, and that difference is\nthe word employment. Now that's important for several\nreasons. Number one, of course, coverage provisions are\nto be read broadly and exemptions narrowly. So there's\nan additional word that can and would suggest it should\nbe read as a term of limitation.\nNumber two, that difference must be given\nsignificance, if possible. The word should not be read\nto mean the same as the coverage provisions when it\ndoesn't exist in the coverage provisions.\nAnd number three, we should avoid\nredundancy. There is a reading of that unique language,\n\"domestic service employment\", which makes sense and in\nfact, is exactly the reading given by the Department.\nCongress did not intend to --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What employment\nwould someone who's hired by a third party be engaged in\nif not domestic service employment?\nMR. BECKER: The word domestic service\nemployment is not necessary to describe what you\ndescribed, Mr. Chief Justice. If that is what the\nCongress intended to describe, it could have said simply\nan employee employed to provide companionship services.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it could have said a\nlot of things. But I find it -- you're hanging your\ncase upon the proposition that there is a difference\nbetween domestic service employment and employed in\ndomestic service employment.\nWow. You know, I just don't see how there's\nany difference in those two at all.\nMR. BECKER: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying we have to\nfind some difference no matter how imaginative the\ndifference might be. If there were a difference, I'm\nnot sure it's the difference that you're arguing for.\nMR. BECKER: What I'm suggesting is not that\nour case relies or hangs on that word. What I'm\nsuggesting is if that word, that phrase, \"domestic\nservice employment\", is given the definition which the\nDepartment of Labor itself gave it, it avoids reading\ntwo phrases which are different to mean the same thing.\nIt avoids redundancy. And moreover, it is wholly\nconsistent with every other piece of evidence we have\nabout Congress's intent.\nEven the Department of Labor suggested it\nsurely could not have been Congress's intent to retract\ncoverage. The definition is consistent with that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can I ask you what your\nproposal is with regard to the contradictory\nregulations, 552.3 and 552. -- what is it, 109?\nI think they are contradictory.\nNow, the Agency has come up with a solution.\nWe will interpret the former quite unrealistically to\nmean something that it doesn't seem to us to say but --\nyou know -- close enough for government work.\nWhat is your solution for solving the\ninconsistency? Are both of the regulations bad?\nMR. BECKER: My solution, Your Honor, has\ntwo parts but leads to the same conclusion. Our\nsolution is that in applying the Act, which is the\nquestion here, does the Act apply to Ms. Coke's\nemployment, this Court should apply the definitional\nregulations for two reasons, the definitional regulation\nfor two reasons. One, it is the regulation, which no\none disputes, and was promulgated in the exercise of the\nDepartment's law making function. The Department\nexpressly defined and delimited its term \"domestic\nservice employment\" in 552.3 and expressly said it was\nnot doing so in the third-party regulation. So it's\nentitled to greater deference for that reason. But\nmoreover --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What's your other reason?\nMR. BECKER: It is the only definition which\nmakes sense, which doesn't lead to a whole series of\nproblems.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Because of employed and\ndomestic employment versus --\nMR. BECKER: For --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- domestic service?\nMR. BECKER: For the following five reasons,\nYour Honor. One, it avoids reading a term in the\nstatute, not only a term in the regulation but a term in\nthe statute, completely out of the statute. And that is\nthe term \"employment\".\nSecondly, as the Department found, it is\nconsistent with what was Congress's clear intent, to\nexpand and not to contract coverage.\nThirdly, if one looks at the debates, and\nthere was extensive and vigorous debate about these\namendments, the exclusive focus in Congress was the\nhousehold. The opponents were exclusively concerned\nwith the extension of coverage to the households. So\napplying the exemption to protect only household\nemployees is wholly consistent with what was Congress's\nexclusive --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you're getting into\narguments now that are not about the regulation but\nthey're about the statute. I'm assuming that we have\nregulations that are entitled to deference. And you\nhave two regulations that are conflicting. Now, how do\nyou decide which one prevails? Counsel for the other\nside says the specific governs the general, certainly an\nancient prescription.\nCounsel also says that this is an agency\nregulation. The agency is given great deference in the\ninterpretation of it own regulations. And even if the\nagency had said well, you know, they do conflict, we\nadmit it, they totally conflict, we won't even try to\nreinterpret 552.3, we think that's the one that's wrong,\nwhy wouldn't we accept their statement to that effect?\nMR. BECKER: Your Honor, of course setting\naside, as you do, our argument that Congress has\nspecific intent on this question, looking only at the\nregulation --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's statutory. I just\nwant to focus on the regulation arguments, not the\nstatutory --\nMR. BECKER: Let me answer in several ways.\nFirst, this Court has clearly held that an agency does\nnot have unbounded discretion to construe its own\nregulations. When the terms of the regulations are\nunambiguous, they cannot be construed away. Now here --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They aren't unambiguous.\nThey contradict each other. The agency has to do\nsomething about it, and here the agency made a choice.\nEven if I assume the choice was, we're going to\ndisregard 552.3, we're going to strike out those words,\nthey were the mistake. One or the other had to be the\nmistake. We decided it was this one. Why shouldn't we\ntake their word on it?\nMR. BECKER: Again, for two reasons, Your\nHonor. There's a difference between conflict and\nambiguity. The words are unambiguous, and it's not\nsimply the -- there's two sets of words which they\nattempt to read out of the regulation, one of the\nunambiguous words that require employment by the person\nwho's living in the home, and the other is the prefatory\nlanguage which says the regulation only applies to the\nexemption. So in the guise of deference, the Solicitor\nGeneral and the petitioners actually suggest to this\nCourt that it should take apart the regulation and\nignore two of its three operative provisions.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But if they're flatly\ncontradictory, doesn't your argument have to be that\n.109(a) has lesser status? That's what it boils down\nto, isn't it?\nMR. BECKER: That is certainly my primary\nargument, that this statute is relatively unique in that\nit vested two very different sorts of authority in the\nDepartment of Labor, one a clear law making authority to\nactually define and delimit, to specify what the terms\nin the law mean --\nJUSTICE ALITO: I'm talking about what you\nthink the Department of Labor was doing when it\npromulgated 109(a). It was thinking in effect the\nfollowing: We have the power to issue a regulation here\nthat has the force and effect of law, and we're going to\ngo through the procedure that would be necessary to\nissue such a regulation. But we're not invoking that\npower here because we want this interpretation which we\nthink is the correct interpretation of the statute not\nto be followed -- not to get as much deference from the\ncourts as it would if we were invoking our power.\nDoes that make any sense? That an agency\nwould proceed in that way?\nMR. BECKER: Your Honor, it not only makes\nsense, it's been the Department's pattern since the Act\nwas adopted. That is, the Department since the Act was\nadopted has split its regulations into those under the\nexemptions -- for example the primary exemption for\nprofessional, executive and administrative employees --\nhas split its regulations under those exemptions into\nthose which define and delimit, into those which do not\ndefine and delimit, or other general statements that\napply to their interpretation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah, but interpretive\nregulations are in other areas wholly valid before the\ncourts and entitled to Chevron deference, at least if\nthey're adopted by notice and comment rulemaking. You\nknow, we have nothing, what should I say, subordinate\nabout interpretive regulations. In fact, probably most\nof the significant regulations of the most important\nagencies are interpretive regulations.\nMR. BECKER: The important difference here,\nJustice Scalia, is the statute. The statute, like the\ntax statute which was interpreted by this Court in Vogel\nand Rowan, creates two types of authority. And not only\nunder the Fair Labor Standards Act, but --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I understand that you say\nit creates two types, but there is no indication that it\nintended one type of authority to be entitled to less\nrespect from the courts than the other. What do you\nrely on for that?\nMR. BECKER: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where is the proposition\nthat an interpretive regulation is somehow not a\nfull-fledged binding regulation?\nMR. BECKER: Well, let me qualify the\nquestion, if I might. The Petitioner would suggest that\nwe're relying on simply a label, this is in the\ninterpretive section and the other is in the general\nregulation section. Far from it. We are relying on a\nvery clear statement both in the regulations, 552.2(c),\nas well as in both the proposed regulations and the\nfinal regulations, which clearly state that only those\nin Part A define and delimit. Why is that an important\ndistinction? It's an important distinction because\nCongress clearly meant these two grants to be different.\nOtherwise, why would it have granted an express power to\ndefine and delimit which would otherwise be redundant of\nthe general rulemaking authority?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They're different but not\nnecessarily of different -- entitled to different\nrespect from the courts. A defined -- what is it,\ndefine and delimit? These are regulations that don't\neven purport to be an interpretation of any language in\nthe statute, but the use of authority given to the\nagency to cut out certain areas, to say the -- this rule\nwon't apply to companies over this -- that can't\npossibly be an interpretation of the statute.\nSo Congress says we're going to give the\nagency that authority. In addition, of course, we're\ngoing to give this agency the authority that every other\nagency has, which is to interpret -- interpret the\nlanguage of the statute.\nMR. BECKER: Well, Your Honor, I think we\ncan safely assume in 1974 when Congress created these\ntwo types of authority, it did so with knowledge of the\nlaw. And this Court, if you compare its decision in\nAddison to its decision in Skidmore, clearly itself\ndistinguished between the exercise of those two\ndifferent interpretive or rulemaking authority. Clearly\nin Addison, construing a very similar term in a\ndifferent exemption, giving the Department of Labor the\npower to define a particular term in the exemption, said\nthat is law making authority. And we will follow what\nthe Department of Labor says unless it's clearly\ninconsistent with the statutory -- with Congress's\nintent.\nIn Skidmore, where that type of expressed\ndelegated law making authority to define and delimit was\nnot at issue, the Court said we will record only that\ndegree of deference to which the regulation --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Skidmore was before a\nrather significant case called Chevron.\nMR. BECKER: Absolutely, Your Honor. But it\nwas also before the 1974 amendment. So if the question\nis, what was Congress intending in creating two types of\nrulemaking authority, the power to define and delimit,\nand the general rulemaking authority, I think we need to\nconsider Congress's intent at that time.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You mean we're going to\ndivide all administrative law now into those -- those\nregulations -- those provisions that were adopted by\nCongress pre-Chevron and those adopted by Congress\npost-Chevron, and for the ones adopted pre-Chevron we're\ngoing to treat regulation as essentially suggestions by\nthe agency which we give Skidmore deference to, and the\nones after Chevron, we're going to treat differently.\nDo you have any case of ours that suggests something\nlike that, which seems to me a very strange manner of\nproceeding?\nMR. BECKER: Let me answer in two ways, Your\nHonor. One, it would not be any case. Here we have a\nparticular statutory scheme that is contrary to --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ought not to get as\nmuch deference from the courts.\nMR. BECKER: Here we have a case essentially\ndescribed by Justice Kennedy in & Haga, where we have a\ndifferent statutory scheme combined with a explicit\nstatement by the Agency as to which part of that scheme\nthe Agency is operating under. But the case I would\ncite, or the cases would be Rolo and Rove which have not\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: Since we're into that,\nwe're into this fascinating subject, I thought that\npossibly they had -- they promulgated the whole thing\npursuant to the rulemaking power under that particular\nstatute, because that's what it says in 552.2. It says\n\"this part\" -- it doesn't say subpart, it says part --\nand part is 552. And both regs we are talking about are\nin the part. And B says interpretations, but they don't\nmean interpretive rules, because when you look at those\ninterpretations, they have a whole lot of numbers in\nthem, and divide by 32. Nobody thinks that Congress\nmeant in this statute divide by 32, as opposed by divide\nby 33.\nSo as I read that, I thought the whole thing\nis promulgated pursuant to their rulemaking authority;\nPart A has more general things. Part B has more\nspecific things. Where am I wrong?\nMR. BECKER: Well, I think the question,\nYour Honor, is which of the regulations were promulgated\npursuant to the specific authority --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All of them. All of them\nis what it says unless I missed something.\nMR. BECKER: Well, I think what you missed\nis that a simple citation to the exemption does not\ntranslate into an exercise of the power to define and\ndelimit. Because the Department was very, very specific\nas to when it was exercising that power. In 552.2(c) it\nsays the definitions required by the legislation are\nprovided in the following sections and it enumerates\nthem and does not include the third-party regulation.\nNow Petitioners would suggest well, that's\njust a definition. They also have the power to delimit.\nHowever, both the notice of proposed rulemaking and the\nnotice of final rulemaking said that we are exercising\nour power to define and delimit in subpart A.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. I got the point.\nMR. BECKER: But part B is different.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Right. Right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So why are you sure\nthere's a conflict in the first place? You know, 552.3\nsays that the term domestic service employment refers to\nservices performed in the home of the employer. It\ndoesn't say it only refers to that. And then you go\ndown and 109 says it also includes employees who are\nemployed by a third party.\nI mean, can't they be reconciled in that\nway.\nMR. BECKER: I don't think so, Your Honor.\nAnd its certainly not the way that the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not the way the\nAgency has done it. But you don't think we should defer\nto them, anyway. So --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. BECKER: That's correct. But the\nregulation -- 552.3 defines the statutory term which\nonly exists in the exemption, domestic service\nemployment.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah, but it says it\nrefers to something. It doesn't say as many of these\nregulations and statutes do, is, you know, it is defined\nas.\nAnd particularly when you're confronted with\nwhat would otherwise be a conflict, maybe refers to\nshould be read to mean includes rather than is defined\nas.\nMR. BECKER: Well, I think we have to read\nthe definitional regulations together. That is, all of\nthe terms in the exemption, companionship services,\nbabysitting services, casual basis, domestic service\nemployment, are all defined in the set of regulations,\npoint 3, point 4, point 5, point 6. And it is clear\nfrom the prefatory language of each one that what the\nDepartment of Labor intended to do was define the terms\nin the statute.\nAnd so when it said that that term refers\nto --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well it is\ninteresting when you look at -- I mean, they're -- it's\na good point. It's interesting when you look at the\nother definitions, the babysitting, it says this\nprovision shall mean. Here it just says it refers to.\nLet's see, the other ones -- casual basis,\nshall mean. Companionship services, shall mean.\nThis one doesn't say shall mean. It says it\nrefers to this. I'm just wondering if that's something\nthat suggests it's not intended to be as exclusive as\nthe other definitions.\nMR. BECKER: I do not believe so, Your\nHonor. It is an exercise of the power to define the\nterm and I don't think we can take that language \"refers\nto\" to be non-exclusive. When the Department said\nreferred it was defining a statutory term as it said it\nwas. If we have any doubt about what the Department\nintended, it actually of course reiterated that\ndefinition under the interpretive classification. And\nit again said that the term refers to, is defined as,\nemployment by the household. If we had any doubt --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Becker --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There it says\n--there it says includes. And if you're talking about\n552.101, there it says the term includes persons\nfrequently referred to as private household workers.\nMR. BECKER: I'm referring to an earlier\nprovision of the same regulation, not the reference to\nprivate household workers, but where it states that the\ndefinition includes those individuals who are employed\nby the household, that is in 552.101(a). But if we had\nany further doubt, the -- that regulation refers to, as\nits source of the language, the regulation adopted under\nthe Social Security Act, now 20 CFR 404.1057. It was\noriginally numbered differently, but at the time, in\n1974, that regulation which was explicitly the source of\nthe language the Department of Labor used, said not\nonce, not twice, but three times, that the individual\nhad to be employed by the household.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. -- Mr. Becker, if\nthere is room for the Agency to read this statute either\nway, one way that the third party employee would come\nunder the Fair Labor Standards Act, the other that they\nwould not, would be treated the same way as the person\nemployed by the elderly person himself or herself, but\nif the concern of Congress in making this exemption was\nfor the householder with limited funds, if the Agency is\nsubject to the Fair Labor Standards Act, it's going to\nend up being the householder paying for it anyway.\nSo why isn't the most reasonable\ninterpretation of what Congress meant by the exemption\nthat the exemption would apply across the board, so that\nall workers in this category would be exempt?\nMR. BECKER: Your Honor, setting aside, of\ncourse, all the reasons about Congress's intent in 552.3\nwhich we've already explained, we would not say that\nthat there is any credible evidence in the legislative\nhistory or the text of the Act to suggest that cost was\na factor.\nAnd let me explain why. The Department for\nthe first time when it promulgated its advisory\nmemorandum suggested this was the basis of the third\nparty regulation. It said nothing of the sort in 1975.\nAs support for the assertion it cited four isolated\ncomments in the legislative history. None of them\nexcept the last -- and there is only one of t-h-e-m\nrelated in any way to the exemption. The one that\nrelated to the exemption in fact directly supports our\nposition, because it describes those people who are not\nwithin the exemption as the professional domestics.\nSo we don't think that there's any basis for\nsuggesting that cost was the underlying rationale; and,\nin fact, it is really implausible. Because at the same\ntime, for example, Congress extended the provisions of\nthe Act which covered nursing homes. At the same time,\nas has been pointed out, Congress only exempted casual\nbabysitters. Now We would submit that if Congress was\nconcerned about cost, in creating this babysitter and\ncompanionship exemption, the primary intended\nbeneficiaries of that would have been working families\nwhere both people worked and therefore who require a\nfull-time baby sitter --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\nMR. BECKER: -- and a full-time baby is not\ncovered.\nThank you very much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Farr, you have\nthree minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF H. BARTOW FARR,\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS\nMR. FARR: Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.\nRespondent in response to Justice Scalia's\nquestion about how Respondent would reconcile the\nregulation 552.3 and 109(a) actually did not I believe\nattempt any reconciliation. If I understand\nrespondent's position correctly, it's simply 109(a) has\nto be invalidated dated and 552.3 stands in its\nentirety.\nI think that's incorrect for several\nreasons. First of all, the basis for it is essentially\nthis apparent distinction between the define and delimit\nauthority and the more general authority to enact\nnecessary rules and regulation. But, in fact, as\nJustice Breyer pointed out in his question, both grants\nof authority were invoked by the Department when it\nenacted both regulations simultaneously, not limited to\neither subpart A or subpart B, and for the reasons that\nJustice Alito points out, it is a very odd thing to\nattribute to the Department to say that it would\nexercise two different legislative powers in different\nparts of the -- of the regulations.\nThere's no reason it would do that. The\nsubpart B regulations clearly are regulations that\ndelimit the terms of the exemption in 213(a)(15).\nThere's no question about that. So why in fact if it\nwas doing what Congress authorized it to do under\n213(a)(15), would it instead of relying on the grant of\nauthority in that provision, rely on some other general\ngrant of authority? It makes no logical sense to\nattribute that to the Department.\nAnd it seems to me, in -- excuse me -- in\nfact, that that argument points up one of the\ndifficulties here. It seems to me that the arguments\nhere are a way of simply trying to push the Department\naside so that the courts can ultimately do the final job\nof exposition on this exemption. Not only contrary to\nthe basic principle of Chevron, which is where that\nwhere is ambiguity in the statute, or room for\ninterpretation, the agencies are given the opportunity\nto do that within reasonable bounds; it is also contrary\nto the statute.\nIt is clear as I said at the beginning of my\nargument, the Department was the agency chosen by\nCongress to do the work of defining and delimiting the\nexception.\nNow I'd like to say just one other thing in\nresponse to Justice Stevens' question about the\nparticular nature of the litigation. This is a suit for\ndamages. It is a suit claiming will damages.\nThank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\n"
