KRAMER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. KRAMER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nFrom the first Congress in 1790, Congress\nhas made the decision that all Federal statutes which\nare, of course, creatures created by Congress in\nstatutes, should be subject to a statute of limitations;\nin this particular case, five years. When it comes to\nconspiracy cases, as this Court said in Hyde, the\nstatute of limitations is treated a little differently\nbecause conspiracy statutes are -- conspiracy crimes are\ncontinuing offenses.\nSo the Court said the way we determine --\none way to determine whether a particular defendant's\ninvolvement in a conspiracy has ended -- in other words,\nhis membership has ended -- is by the doctrine of\nwithdrawal.\nIt's the statute of limitations that is the\ndefense in the case. It's the doctrine of withdrawal\nthat triggers -- that is the triggering event for the\nstatute of limitations, which sets the date for when the\nstatute of limitations starts to run. Withdrawal, in\nand of itself, is not a defense. It's the statute of\nlimitations that's the defense.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but that -- is that an\nelement of the crime?\nMR. KRAMER: No. This Court has called it a\ndefense in the Cook case, in the Oppenheimer case --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It has to be raised by the\ndefendant, right?\nMR. KRAMER: It does have to be raised\ninitially -- I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Which means it's not an\nelement, so it doesn't have to be charged in the\nindictment. Now, how can something that goes to the\nexistence or non-existence of an affirmative defense be\nan element?\nMR. KRAMER: Well, I don't -- it is -- it is\nnot an element, I agree with that; but it is -- I would\nsay that it's engrafted onto every Federal criminal\nstatute by statute. This is not the common law, but by\nCongress' decision. I would also say that even though\nit's not an element of defense -- of the offense, in\nWinship, this Court referred to the fact that the\ngovernment must prove every fact necessary to prove a\ncrime beyond a reasonable doubt. It's a fact\nnecessary --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But -- but you could\nprove the crime without a reasonable -- beyond a\nreasonable doubt, if you never raised the statute of\nlimitations. And statutes of limitations exist for\ncivil claims, as well as criminal claims.\nAnd in -- on the civil side, the statute of\nlimitations is an affirmative defense. And it's up to\nthe plaintiff to plead and prove -- both plead and prove\nit, both the burden of production and persuasion. Why\nshould it be different on the criminal side?\nMR. KRAMER: I think several reasons. First\nof all, obviously, the burden of proof is different in\ncriminal cases as the court said in Mullaney v. Wilbur.\nIt has been suggested that, because of the difficulties\nin negating an argument that a homicide was committed in\nthe heat of passion, the burden of proof should rest on\nthe defendant.\nAnd they said the same may be said of the\nrequirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt of many\ncontroverted facts, but this is the traditional burden\nwhich our criminal justice system applies. I also think\nthat the Court has distinguished on some grounds and is\nthe civil statute of limitations from the criminal\nstatute.\nIn fact, in the number of cases, this Court\nhas talked about the criminal statute of limitations.\nIt has never referred to it as an affirmative defense.\nIt has said it's a defense, but it has never said that\nthe defendant is required to prove it.\nIn fact, the Quick case said it's part of\nthe merits of the case; although it doesn't have to be\npleaded in the indictment, and the -- that it has to\nbe -- the government has to present evidence of it and\nproof of it.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you -- I think you --\nyou recognized that -- that the defendant has the burden\nof production, not the government, the burden -- burden\nof coming forward with this defense and producing some\nevidence of the withdrawal.\nMR. KRAMER: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, we do\naccept that there is a burden of production, as with\nseveral other things that are not affirmative defenses,\nlike entrapment or alibi, also have a burden of\nproduction before the government has to prove the\nelements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. So\nit's not --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. -- I'm sorry.\nI'm sorry. Finish your answer.\nMR. KRAMER: It's -- it's not dissimilar to\nthose in that respect, and it does go to negate an\nelement of the crime. In -- in the conspiracy statute,\nthe membership in the conspiracy is an element of the\ncrime. Withdrawal negates that element of the crime.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Not -- only for the later\nperiod. It doesn't negate that this person was once a\nmember of the conspiracy. The government has the burden\nto show membership, and it did. So it's not -- it\ndoesn't reach back to negate that there was membership\nat some time. It just says, after withdrawal, we no\nlonger prosecute.\nMR. KRAMER: That's true. What it does is\nextinguish liability for that offense past that time if\nthe statute of limitations has -- if withdrawal occurs\nbefore the statute of limitations, someone can no\nlonger, as the statute says, \"be prosecuted, tried, or\npunished.\"\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn't that like an\namnesty? Isn't that how you described it in your brief?\nMR. KRAMER: There are some cases that call\nit an amnesty. Some cases call it an extinguishment of\nliability.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What's the difference\nbetween the two, in your mind, that makes it an element\nof the crime or a negation of some element of the crime?\nMR. KRAMER: In a conspiracy, there's the\nconspiracy that -- the government has to prove,\nobviously, the conspiracy itself, which is an agreement\nbetween -- it can be anyone. And then they have to\nprove the defendant's membership in that conspiracy.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you're a member, you\nare liable for all the foreseeable acts of your\nco-conspirators, whether or not you knew they were going\nto happen, so long as they were foreseeable?\nMR. KRAMER: Yes. Under Pinkerton, yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And you can be liable\nfor as long as you stay, until you prove you withdrew?\nMR. KRAMER: Until --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And that extinguishes\nyour liability for the continuing conspiracy?\nMR. KRAMER: I would say until you produce\nevidence that you withdrew, yes. And then the\ngovernment has to prove that you were still a member of\nthe conspiracy within the statutory limitations period.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why?\nMR. KRAMER: This Court has never said in\nHyde --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The why is, once you've\njoined, you're trying to extinguish liability. Why\nwould the government have to prove that you're entitled\nto amnesty or not entitled to amnesty?\nMR. KRAMER: It -- I think, Justice\nSotomayor, that it's really no different than if the\ngovernment has to prove you guilty of a crime in the\nfirst place. They have to prove that you committed the\noffense. The statute of limitations, which is, as I\nsaid, engrafted on every Federal criminal statute --\nalmost every statute --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, your argument\nbasically reduces to the fact that, when it comes to the\nstatute of limitations, you treat the conspirators as\nindividuals, rather than as members of the conspiracy.\nMR. KRAMER: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, well, that's\nnot true with respect to other aspects of the\nconspiracy. If members of the conspiracy commit a\nmurder, and it was anticipated and all that, the person\nthat has nothing to do with that, other than being a\npart of the conspiracy, is liable -- criminally liable\nfor that as well. Why is there a special rule for\nstatutes of limitations? Well, why is he treated as an\nindividual, rather than a member of the conspiracy in\nthat respect?\nMR. KRAMER: Well, he would be treated\nfor -- for the withdrawal purpose. If he withdrew, he\nwould also not be liable under Pinkerton. There is a\nmembership element component of Pinkerton as well, for\nPinkerton liability.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, my point is\nthat, once you prove the conspiracy, a member who\ndoesn't -- that doesn't actually participate in the\nactivities of the conspiracy, is still responsible for\nthem. So it makes sense to say you can prove the\nstatute of limitations with respect to the conspiracy,\nnot with respect to each individual.\nMR. KRAMER: Well, I think, actually, it's\njust the opposite. If -- under -- under Grunewald, the\ngovernment -- if the defense -- if the claim of\ntermination is raised, the government has to prove that\nthe conspiracy continued into the limitations period and\nthat there was an overt act -- that was an overt act.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But what the Chief Justice\nindicates, it seems to me, is that if we accept your\nview, then there is going to be a different statute of\nlimitations for each member of the conspiracy. And so\nyou have four or five different statute of limitations.\nI find that -- I find that puzzling.\nMR. KRAMER: Well, actually, in this case,\nthere was different statutes of -- I believe there were\nthree different statute of limitations that the district\ncourt instructed the jury about because there were\nsuperseding indictments and people were indicted at\ndifferent times.\nSo there were already, in this case,\ndifferent statute of limitations. But if one of the\nreasons for withdrawal is to encourage people to get out\nof the agreement, Justice Kennedy, then -- and try to --\ntry to thwart the agreement, then people may have -- may\ncome in and leave at different times during a\nconspiracy.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What is -- is there any --\nI'm trying to find an analogous instance without the\nstatute of limitations. And what occurred to me, just\nas an example, that you might have in your practice\nfound a different one, the Thomas Crown Affair. Say\nthat he robs the bank or the art museum, but he has an\nintent to return it, and he produces evidence that he\nhad an intent to return.\nNow, in such a case, once he produces the\nevidence, does the government have to prove beyond a\nreasonable doubt that he didn't have an intent to\nreturn? Or does he -- is there any instance in which\nthe burden of persuasion shifts? Do you see what I'm\ndriving at?\nMR. KRAMER: I do, and I think that there --\nthat an argument can be made if the intent -- if one of\nthe elements of that offense is to deprive the owner\npermanently of the property and he did not have that\nintent, the government would have to prove what it would\nhave to prove originally, which is that he intended to\ndeprive the -- the owner --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So you have never found a\ncase -- I will ask the government this -- in the\nsubstantive criminal law, no matter what, who is -- even\nif the defendant is the only one ever likely to know\nanything about it, you've never found a case where, once\nthe burden's produced, the -- the burden of persuasion\nremains on the defendant?\nMR. KRAMER: That the burden of persuasion\nremains on the defendant?\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, because you agree the\ndefendant has the burden of production here.\nMR. KRAMER: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And so I was trying to\nthink of some instance -- as I said, I would be\nrepeating myself -- I'm looking for any instance in\nwhich, leaving the statute of limitations out of it, the\nburden of persuasion shifts to the defendant. So I'm\nsaying, did you ever find one? The Thomas Crown Affair\nor some other instance, and your answer is, no, you\nnever have heard of it.\nMR. KRAMER: Well, I guess --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Have you heard of it? So\nwhat?\nMR. KRAMER: Self defense and duress, as the\nCourt said in Dixon, dealing with duress, because it did\nnot negate the elements of the offense, it was an\naffirmative defense that excused --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, this is not -- this\ndoes not negate the elements of the defense -- this does\nnot negate the elements of the crime.\nMR. KRAMER: If it doesn't negate the\nelements of the crime, I would say then this Court has\nclassified it as an affirmative defense.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Well, then if\nthat's so, if it's an affirmative defense and if\nsometimes where it doesn't negate the elements of the\ncrime the burden of persuasion remains on the defendant,\nthen why shouldn't it here? Because he's the one most\nlikely to know.\nMR. KRAMER: Well, I don't think, first of\nall --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And how do you prove it?\nMR. KRAMER: -- that the government has\nshown -- well, first of all, they -- they have to prove\nnothing more than what they would have to prove\noriginally, that the defendant was joined -- knowingly\nand willfully joined the conspiracy.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you -- you would have\nthe government prove that twice. They prove his\nmembership in the conspiracy. And then you say, once he\nalleges that he withdrew, they have to prove it again.\nMR. KRAMER: No, they would not have to\nprove that twice. They could just rest on what they had\ndone originally. The -- the burden of production on the\nwithdrawal, the government could just say to the jury\nthat that's nonsense, there is no reasonable doubt here.\nWe've proved that he was a member. There is a\npermissive inference that he's still a member within the\nlimitations period. They would not have to prove it\ntwice. They could rest on what they had done\noriginally.\nIt's very simple for them, however, to rebut\nthis evidence.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What would you -- what\nwould you have to produce to get over your threshold of\nsatisfying the burden of production?\nMR. KRAMER: Well, it's -- it's actually, I\nthink, a quite high burden of production. You would --\nthe defendant -- in most cases, I would think the\ndefendant himself would have to testify, which, of\ncourse, subjects him to extensive cross-examination on\neverything.\nHe can -- of course, cannot call his\nco-conspirators as witnesses. He might be able to\npresent third-party evidence which, again, would be\nsubject to cross-examination. But he has to show that\nhe took some -- produce evidence that he took some\naffirmative act to disavow --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's why\nit's very difficult to put the burden on the government,\nbecause the people -- he says, well, I told so-and-so\nI'm out of this business, I'm not going to do it\nanymore. And so the government, if they had the burden\nof proof, would say, well, I don't think that's true, I\nwant to call the person you -- you talked to.\nAnd the person says, well, I'm not going to\ntestify because I take my rights under the Fifth\nAmendment. There is no way the government -- in many\ncases, there would be no way the government can carry\nthis burden of proof.\nMR. KRAMER: No, I disagree with that. I\nthink, in every case, it would actually be fairly simple\nfor them. If the defendant can't call that person to\nsupport his defense, the government could just say,\nwell, you didn't hear any testimony from that person\nsupporting the defense. That's enough right there to\nmeet our burden.\nThe government, as in this case, had\nextensive cooperating witnesses, had wiretaps, had\ndocumentary evidence --\nJUSTICE BREYER: They often do. I just want\nto go back, get the complete -- insofar as you can help\nwith this.\nAll right. Let's take duress or\nself-defense. The government shows all the elements of\nmurder. Then the defendant comes in and says, I have\nevidence here that it was under duress or evidence that\nit was self-defense. Then to prevail, what's the\nstandard of persuasion? How does it work?\nIs it then that -- is it that the defendant\nmust show more likely than not? Or is it the defend --\nthat I was defending myself? Or is it that the\ngovernment -- how does it work? What's the rule?\nMR. KRAMER: The defendant -- as I\nunderstand it, the defendant has to -- and, of course,\nit could vary by state.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, of course. Of course.\nMR. KRAMER: The states may put different\nburdens. In the Federal system --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, yes.\nMR. KRAMER: -- the defendant has the\nburden, by a preponderance, to prove the duress defense\nor the self-defense defense.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Well, that's --\nwell, then their point is, well, this is awfully\nsimilar.\nMR. KRAMER: It's not, though, in the sense\nthat the only thing that connects an individual\ndefendant to a conspiracy is that defendant's\nmembership, knowing and willful participation in the\nconspiracy.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The fact that there is a\nstatute of limitations makes your case weaker, not\nstronger, because -- because the statute of limitations\nis less directly connected to the elements of the -- the\noffense than is self-defense or duress.\nMR. KRAMER: I actually think it makes it\nstronger, in the sense that Congress has made this\nchoice to require that every crime be proved to have\nbeen committed within the statute of limitations.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you say that you --\nyou have to prove that the defendant was knowing and\nwillfully a member of the conspiracy, right?\nMR. KRAMER: That was the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's what you said?\nMR. KRAMER: That was the jury instructions\nin this case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, and you agree that\nthat's the rule of law, right?\nMR. KRAMER: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Doesn't duress eliminate\nwillfully?\nMR. KRAMER: The Court said, in Dixon -- it\nmight, to my thinking, but the Court said, in Dixon,\nthat it did not negate any of the elements of the\noffense, that the -- that she had to do the acts\nknowingly and willfully in Dixon and that it did not\nnegate those elements.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So why is that different\nfrom this? If that's not an element, for Pete's sake,\neven though the definition of the crime is knowingly and\nwillfully, and yet, nonetheless, that's -- that's an\naffirmative defense, why -- why is that any different\nhere?\nMR. KRAMER: Because the only way a\ndefendant can prove -- the way a defendant shows that he\nwithdrew is to produce evidence of withdrawal. That is\ninconsistent with the fact that he is a member --\nnecessarily negates the element of membership in the\nconspiracy. If he withdrew, he cannot, at the same\ntime, be a member of the conspiracy.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, I'm having trouble\nunderstanding how your argument would work. Let's say\nthat the -- the defense calls a witness other than the\ndefendant to testify to a conversation in which the\ndefendant allegedly withdrew from the conspiracy and, by\ndoing that, satisfies its burden of production.\nNow, you say the government has the burden\nto prove beyond a reasonable doubt, not only that this\nconversation didn't occur, but also, that the defendant\nnever withdrew at any other time during the limitations\nperiod. Isn't that where your argument would lead?\nMR. KRAMER: No, I don't think they have to\ndisprove the conversation. All they have to prove is\nwhat they had to prove originally, which is that the\ndefendant was a member of the conspiracy within the\nlimitations period, by any kind of evidence.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But how can they prove that\nhe did not withdraw at any other time during this\nconspiracy?\nMR. KRAMER: Well, as in this case, they had\na number --\nJUSTICE ALITO: During the statute of\nlimitations.\nMR. KRAMER: As in this case, they had a\nnumber of cooperating witnesses who testified about\nMr. Smith's actions. They could ask them, did the\nconspiracy -- did Mr. Smith continue to participate, was\nhe involved, did he withdraw, any --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Aren't you transforming\nthe -- the nature of withdrawal? You are seeming to\nargue that the government has to prove, beyond a\nreasonable doubt, active participation in the conspiracy\nduring the statute of limitations period, rather than\nthe -- the affirmative withdrawal from the conspiracy.\nMR. KRAMER: No. I don't mean to imply\nactive participation, if that means an overt act. It\ncan just be -- the government could simply rest upon the\ninference from Hyde that the defendant had been a member\noutside the limitations period and their continued\nparticipation is inferred. That's overcome when the\ndefendant produces evidence of withdrawal. So --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What -- what evidence of\nwithdrawal did you produce in this case?\nMR. KRAMER: In this particular case, it was\nthe -- well, it was the jury that actually called the\nissue to the attention of everybody in the first place,\nby sending out a note saying that, if we -- the\nconspiracy continued, but we think a defendant left,\nmust we find him not guilty?\nThere was a number of pieces of evidence,\nprimarily that he was incarcerated for over six years\nbefore the indictment --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That doesn't prove that he\nwithdrew.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you -- you agree --\nyou agree that that would not have necessarily meant\nwithdrawal?\nMR. KRAMER: No, there are some circuit\ncases that say that alone may be enough, but there was\nmore in this case. In this particular case, one witness\nsaid he recalled -- he did not recall any contacts\nbetween Kevin Gray, who was the ringleader, after the\narrest.\nAnother said that Mr. Smith was mad at\nMr. Gray for not sending any money. They weren't\ncommunicating with him. Another witness -- there was\ntestimony from another witness that Mr. Smith refused to\ncomply with an order that Mr. Gray sent to him.\nSo there were --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Which -- which of those are\naffirmative actions? I mean, the law is that he has to\ntake an affirmative action withdrawing from the\nconspiracy. I don't think being in jail is -- is an\naffirmative action. I don't think being mad at the\nringleader is an affirmative action. I don't think any\nof the things you've said amount to an affirmative\nwithdrawal from the conspiracy.\nMR. KRAMER: Whatever that may be, it's not\nan issue in this case, in the sense that the government\nis actually the one who requested that the district\ncourt give the withdrawal instruction after the jury's\nnote.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe not, but it -- it may\nmean that we are wasting our time.\nMR. KRAMER: I think that whether this\nqualified as affirmative acts or not is, in a sense,\nirrelevant to the question before the Court because,\nafter the jury's note came out, the government itself\nrequested the withdrawal instruction. And the\ngovernment not only requested the withdrawal\ninstructions, but said, we have no objection to placing\nthe burden on us beyond a reasonable doubt, if that's\nwhat the defense wants.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Kramer --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm -- I'm having\ntrouble understanding how this works. You said a while\nago that the government has -- doesn't have to do\nanything? In other words, he puts on -- he says, I\nwithdrew. And I told this -- the head of the conspiracy\nthat I wanted no more part of it. And the head of the\nconspiracy says, well, I'm not going to testify.\nAnd then the government doesn't have to do\nanything?\nMR. KRAMER: The government can just say --\nthey can rest on the fact that the proof outside the\nmembership period and rest on the inference from Hyde\nthat his membership continued.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, how is that --\nhow is that carrying the burden that you say is on it to\nprove the absence of withdrawal beyond a reasonable\ndoubt? It seems to me that, if the government just sits\nthere and doesn't say anything, they'll never be able to\ncarry their burden.\nMR. KRAMER: I think -- I think they can by\njust saying to -- well, I don't think they have a burden\nto prove the absence of withdrawal. They have the\nburden to prove membership within the limitations\nperiod.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but they've\nalready done that. That's --\nMR. KRAMER: Within the limitations -- his\nmembership within the period. So they can just say to\nthe jury, look, this evidence of withdrawal is nonsense,\nyou've heard the testimony, we've cross-examined him, it\nmakes no sense.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no, no. My\nhypothetical is, because we are talking about the\ncriminal conspiracy, and the idea is did he tell those\npeople he was out, they're probably going to say, I'm\nnot going to testify.\nAnd so -- and you say, well, the government\nstill doesn't have to do anything. It seems to me that\nyou can't say that they've carried their burden of proof\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, if they have nothing to say\nabout an issue as to which you say they have the burden\nof proof.\nMR. KRAMER: Well, I think it's up to the\njury whether to believe that evidence or not. And I\ndon't think the government has to prove --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Believe what\nevidence?\nMR. KRAMER: The -- the evidence that was\nproduced by the defendant that he actually told somebody\nhe --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But there can't be\nany evidence because nobody is willing to testify\nunder -- because they invoked their Fifth Amendment\nrights.\nMR. KRAMER: Oh, I'm sorry. I thought the\ndefendant had testified to that effect, that he -- if\nthere is no evidence, there is nothing for the jury.\nThere is no -- if there's -- the defendant has not\nproduced any evidence of withdrawal, then there\nis nothing --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. Well, if the\ndefendant does testify, and he says, I told the\nringleader I want out, is an attack on his credibility\nsufficient to prove the absence of withdrawal beyond a\nreasonable doubt?\nMR. KRAMER: Absolutely. And it happens all\nthe time in trials, that the government relies upon the\nfact of a witness' unreliability and what happened on\ncross to say that they proved their case beyond a\nreasonable doubt. They don't have to prove anything\nthey didn't have to prove originally in this case. In\nfact, it may be easier because it's within the\nlimitations period.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They didn't have to prove\nwithin the limitations period. They didn't have to\nprove that. You acknowledged that that the -- look,\nwhat's at issue here is not a defense of withdrawal.\nIt's the defense of the statute of limitations, right?\nMR. KRAMER: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You acknowledge that that\nis an affirmative defense. And you are arguing that\nwhat establishes that affirmative defense in this case,\nnamely, withdrawal, is an element. How -- how can\nsomething that is -- that does nothing more than\nestablish an affirmative defense be an element?\nMR. KRAMER: I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I can't understand that.\nCan you give me any other example in the criminal law\nwhere -- where --\nMR. KRAMER: I mean, an alibi -- alibi or\nentrapment negate elements are not affirmative defenses.\nIf an alibi -- the defense is what -- and what could\nhappen in any case --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that's not an\naffirmative -- I want an example of something which is\nan affirmative defense and where the proof of that\naffirmative defense becomes an element.\nMR. KRAMER: I may have given the wrong\nimpression. I don't classify the statute of limitations\nas -- as an affirmative defense, nor has this Court ever\ndone it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why doesn't it have to be\ncontained in the indictment, if it's an element?\nMR. KRAMER: It's not -- well, it's not an\nelement. But in Grunewald, this Court said --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why is it up to the\ndefendant to raise it, if it's an element?\nMR. KRAMER: I think, in Ledbetter, this\nCourt said that, although there doesn't have to be a\ndate in the indictment, the government -- it's\nsufficient if the government proves a date before the\nindictment within the limitations period, this Court\nspecifically referred to in Ledbetter, which is at page\n21 of our brief.\nSo I don't -- I may have given a wrong\nimpression. This is not an affirmative defense. An\naffirmative defense does not --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. That at least is\nlogical. I'm not sure it's right. But it's logical.\nMR. KRAMER: Well, I'm halfway there.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I actually thought your\nstronger argument in your brief was in trying to explain\nwhy it negated an element. I think what you said in\nyour brief -- and you haven't made it here yet, as\nclearly -- was that, if he wasn't willingly\nparticipating during the statute of limitations, then he\nhadn't committed the actual crime.\nMR. KRAMER: That is -- that is the heart of\nour argument, that it negates the element of membership\nwithin the statutory period, which is what the\ngovernment has to prove. And I'm sorry if I did not\nmake that clear.\nBut the element that's at issue, that the\nstatute of limitations negates, is membership within the\nstatute -- membership in the conspiracy, knowing and\nwillful participation --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But the government doesn't\nhave to prove within the statutory period. It's up to\nthe defendant to raise that defense, and if he doesn't\nraise it, it's waived.\nMR. KRAMER: Well, I think it is up to the\ngovernment to prove it. It may be that if -- this Court\nhas never said a defendant waives it by not raising it.\nBut I -- I think the government has to prove it in every\ncase. It may be waived.\nSome circuits have said it's waived. This\nCourt has not said so.\nI would like to reserve the remainder of my\ntime for rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMs. Harrington?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SARAH E. HARRINGTON\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. HARRINGTON: Thank you,\nMr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:\nThe Due Process Clause does not require the\ngovernment to disprove withdrawal outside the\nlimitations period because lack of withdrawal is not an\nelement of the crime of conspiracy. This Court has been\nclear that the Winship burden attaches only to things\nthat are elements in the constitutional sense. And when\nsomething is an element in the constitutional sense,\nthen at least four consequences follow.\nAs the Court has suggested, first, the\ngovernment has to allege in the indictment in every\ncase. Second, the -- the government has to prove it in\nevery case. Third, the jury has to be instructed on it\nin every case. And fourth, a defendant can't waive the\nrequirement that it be proved in his case by failing to\nraise it.\nBut none of those things apply as to a\nstatute of limitations --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Harrington --\nJUSTICE BREYER: This is true, but his\npoint -- basic point -- and he has responded to the\npoints I've made, is that, of course, if there's a\nfive-year statute on robbery, it doesn't help the\ngovernment that he create -- he committed a robbery\nbefore.\nMS. HARRINGTON: Correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So he's saying\nwhat you charged in the indictment is that he was a\nmember of a conspiracy that existed between 1995 and\n2005. Now, that's the crime that concerns us, roughly.\nAnd he is saying, to prove your case, you have to show,\nas an element, that he was a member.\nNow, you did present some evidence that he\nwas a member. And he wants to present some evidence,\nand has, that he wasn't a member. And he wasn't a\nmember if he withdrew. And therefore, once he presents\nenough to get -- make that an issue, you have to prove\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that he was a member. So you\nhave to show he didn't withdraw.\nNow, this has nothing to do with the statute\nof limitations. By coincidence, it does. But a statute\nof limitations issue would be that you all agree that he\nwithdrew, but the question is did it happen in 1993 or\n1997? That's a statute of limitations issue, but this\nisn't.\nThis is a question of whether he was a\nmember of the conspiracy during the time period that you\ncharged in the indictment. That's his point. So what\nis the response?\nMS. HARRINGTON: So I guess I have two\nresponses. The first is that it is a statute of\nlimitations question, in the sense that the government\nproved -- and there is no dispute about this -- that the\nconspiracy that was charged did exist within the\nlimitations period. And so the question is just did\nthis particular member of the conspiracy --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, in other words, you\ncan charge me or anybody in the audience or anybody here\nwith what? Not charging them? You are saying there was\na conspiracy? Doesn't he have to be shown to be a\nmember of the conspiracy in order for you to get a\nconviction?\nMS. HARRINGTON: He does, and there's no --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And that's an element of\nthe crime?\nMS. HARRINGTON: And an -- but when\nPetitioner talks about the membership or participation\nelement, what he is really talking about is the\nagreement element. The government has to prove that\neach defendant who is charged with a conspiracy\nintentionally agreed to join the conspiracy. And there\nis no dispute that the government proved that with\nrespect to Petitioner in this case --\nJUSTICE BREYER: There is no more relevance,\nis there, to the fact that there happened to be a\npre-1995 conspiracy, except as a matter of proof -- I\nshouldn't say relevance -- that he happened to rob a\nbank before 1995? I mean, in each instance, there was\ncriminal activity before 1995.\nNow, you can use that in order to prove that\nhe was a member during '95 to 2000. That, I see. But\nhe, similar, can use the matter of withdrawal to prove\nhe wasn't a member during 1995 to 2000. And, therefore,\nit goes to show whether you or the government have\nproved an element of the offense, namely, that he was a\nmember between '95 and 2000.\nMS. HARRINGTON: But, again, the element is\nagreement, right? So we prove that he agreed to join\nthe conspiracy, and we proved that each defendant agreed\nto join the conspiracy. We don't have to prove that\nthat agreement happened in the limitations period, as\nlong as we prove that the conspiracy continues to --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So how do we tell that,\nMs. Harrington? Because it seems to me that the crux of\nthe difference between you and your friend is that you\nsay the element is membership in the conspiracy at some\npoint, it doesn't matter whether it's in the limitations\nperiod. And he says the element is membership in a\nconspiracy in the limitations period. And if he's\nright, a set of things follow from that; and if you are\nright, another set of things follow.\nSo how do we determine that the -- you know,\nthat the statute of limitations -- that the timing\nquestion is not baked into the elements question, that\nit's just membership sometime, as opposed to membership\nat a particular time?\nMS. HARRINGTON: Well, we know it's not an\nelement for the reasons I explained because it doesn't\nhave to be charged in the indictment, it doesn't have to\nbe proved in every case, the defendant can waive it. So\nit's not an element in the constitutional sense, for all\nof those reasons.\nWe can also tell that, in the specific\nconspiracy context, it's not an element because this\nCourt's decision in Hyde from 1912. In that case, the\ndefendant, Mr. Schneider, who had raised the statute of\nlimitations defense, had not done anything to\nparticipate in the charged conspiracy within what was\nthen a three-year statute of limitations period.\nThe jury was charged, he didn't do anything,\nthe court said he didn't do anything. The court said,\nit's fine, he's still a member of the conspiracy because\nhe has not taken an affirmative act to withdraw from the\nconspiracy.\nSo that's how we know that some sort of\nactive membership isn't an element of the crime, as long\nas the government has proved, beyond a reasonable doubt,\nthat -- that the defendant joined the crime at some\npoint and that the -- joined the conspiracy -- excuse\nme -- at some point, and that the conspiracy continued\nto exist in the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Did the government charge\nin the indictment that the conspiracy existed during\nthis five-year period?\nMS. HARRINGTON: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: During the particular\nfive-year period.\nMS. HARRINGTON: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Did it have to do that?\nMS. HARRINGTON: It did not have to do that,\nbut there's no dispute --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And if it did not have to,\nit would have been up to the defendant to say, the\nstatute of limitations runs on my participation, right?\nMS. HARRINGTON: Right. And, to be clear,\nI'm not sure it specifically used that phrase, but it\ncharged -- it charged overt acts that were part of the\nconspiracy that happened within the five-year period.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But it -- it didn't say the\nconspiracy only existed within that five-year period?\nMS. HARRINGTON: I'm not sure what -- I'm\nnot sure exactly the language that is used in the\nindictment, but it --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, let's assume it did.\nWould -- would -- let's say, in a burglary indictment --\nlet's say the burglary occurred seven years ago, and\nthere is a five-year statute of limitations. If the\nindictment just -- just accuses the individual of\nconducting a burglary seven years ago, is that -- is\nthat indictment invalid?\nMS. HARRINGTON: This Court -- this Court\nhas held since the Cook case that the -- the government\ndoes not have to charge that -- the satisfaction of the\nlimitations period in the indictment.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So it's -- it's up to the\ndefendant to say, no --\nMS. HARRINGTON: It's up to the defendant --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- seven years is too long.\nMS. HARRINGTON: -- to raise it, right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So I guess the issue here\nis whether the government's statement that the\nconspiracy existed within this five-year period causes\nthat to be an element of the crime?\nMS. HARRINGTON: But I think this Court has\nbeen clear, that it doesn't cause it to be an element of\nthe crime. I mean, back as far as the Cook case, the\nCourt said that it doesn't have to be -- timing is not\nan element -- is not of the essence of these crimes.\nAnd so it doesn't have to be charged in the indictment.\nAnd, again --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But what if it is?\nMS. HARRINGTON: But what if it is? Of --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If it is charged in\nthe indictment?\nMS. HARRINGTON: Then that doesn't -- that\ndoesn't cause it to be an element of the crime. I\nthink, again, there is no dispute in this case that the\ngovernment proved that the conspiracy did exist within\nthe limitations period. I don't think Petitioner is\ncontesting that. What he is saying is that he wasn't a\npart of that conspiracy within the limitations period.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What he's saying is\nthat it wasn't proven to be within the limitations\nperiod with respect to him.\nMS. HARRINGTON: That's true, but\nonce the -- it's true that that's his argument. But\nonce the government has proved that he willingly joined\nthe conspiracy, which it did in this case, then the law\npresumes that every person who has willingly joined the\nconspiracy remains a member of an ongoing conspiracy,\nunless or until he takes some affirmative action to\nwithdraw from the conspiracy.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, I am looking at it\nas a puzzle here because I think you could look at it\neither way. I mean, if a person commits a burglary and\nthe indictment charges that, and he says, yes, I did, I\ndid, there is no doubt about all the elements being\nsatisfied, but it happened outside the limitation\nperiod. That's in the statute of limitations area.\nBut where you charge a conspiracy taking\nplace within a period of time, as I would think you\nusually would -- I would think the -- those words on the\npaper almost always have a date in them -- then you\ncould look at it as a question of membership in that\nconspiracy, the one that's charged, in which case, it's\na question of the elements.\nAnd then, if you're in doubt as to whether\nor not the time that he withdrew was inside or outside\nthe period, that becomes a limitations question.\nMS. HARRINGTON: But it can't --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And then I'm -- I'm sort\nof -- I'm torn here. I actually can see it either way.\nMS. HARRINGTON: I mean, I think it can't be\nan element of the crime because, if the defendant\ndoesn't raise it, the government doesn't have to prove\nit or disprove it, depending on how you look at it.\nSo --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, that isn't true. You\nhave to prove membership.\nMS. HARRINGTON: Well, you have to prove\nmembership --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And it happens, in this\ninstance, that you bring in a prima facie case. I'd be\nrepeating myself. And that he says withdrawal, and\nwithdrawal is designed to negate membership.\nMS. HARRINGTON: But withdrawal does not\nnegate membership because, again, membership is really\njust the agreement. And, in fact, a withdrawal defense\ntends to confirm that a particular defendant agreed to\njoin a conspiracy because there is nothing to withdraw\nfrom if he didn't join --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But then the withdrawal\nprior to the time charged negates membership in the\nconspiracy that you have charged because there was no\nmembership during that time.\nMS. HARRINGTON: It's true, but the\ngovernment has to prove that the defendant joined the\nconspiracy and the conspiracy continued to exist. And\nto bring you back to the Hyde --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, in a normal\ncase, where it's a robbery or burglary, whatever, you\ncharge the crime happened in X date, and the defendant\nraises an affirmative defense that it's not within the\nstatute of limitations. Who bears the burden of proving\nit does, in that situation?\nMS. HARRINGTON: This Court stated, in\nGrunewald, that the government bears the burden.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So, if you\nbear the burden in the normal statute of limitations\ncase, the issue, I think, in my mind, becomes do you\ncontinue to bear that burden in a conspiracy crime?\nMS. HARRINGTON: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because -- and you still\nhave to prove -- you're saying that the elements of the\nstatute of limitation there are that there was an\nagreement to commit a crime, this person joined it at\nany time during the conspiracy, and the conspiracy\ncontinues.\nMS. HARRINGTON: Right.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You don't have to prove\nthat the defendant was part of that conspiracy or joined\nthat conspiracy during the statute of limitations;\nthat's your point.\nMS. HARRINGTON: We don't have to prove that\nhe -- that the agreement happened in the limitations\nperiod or that any particular defendant did something to\nsort of re-agree within the limitations period. And\nthat, again, is clear from this Court's decision in\nHyde, where, in that case, the defendant raising the\nlimitations defense had not done anything related to the\nconspiracy within the limitations period.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I think his intuitive\nargument is, I can't be responsible for a crime I wasn't\na part of during the limitations period. That really is\nthe essence of his argument. And if it's your job to\nprove that he committed the -- a robbery during the\nlimitations period, that it's your job to prove that he\ncommitted the conspiracy during -- that he was part --\nthat the conspiracy -- that he was part of the\nconspiracy during the limitations period --\nMS. HARRINGTON: Well, what the statute --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I think that -- that's\nthe simplicity of his argument.\nMS. HARRINGTON: It -- that is the\nsimplified version of his argument. I think, if you\nlook at --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So simplify your\nresponse to me.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. HARRINGTON: Okay. Well, if you look at\nSection -- if you look at Section 3282, which is the\nstatute of limitations, it says that the crime --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's not a simple\nresponse.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You are already way too\nfast.\nMS. HARRINGTON: What we have to prove is\nthat the crime was committed within the limitations\nperiod. We proved that the crime was committed within\nthe limitations period because the conspiracy existed in\nthe limitations period. By operation of law, anyone who\nhas willingly joined the conspiracy at some point\nremains a member of the conspiracy, unless or until he\ntakes an affirmative step to withdraw.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Isn't it essential to your\nargument that the very definition of a conspiracy is a\ncrime that continues over time?\nMS. HARRINGTON: Absolutely. The way the\nstatute of limitations defense operates within the\nconspiracy context is it asks the question whether and\nwhen a conspiracy was complete. But -- but the\naffirmative defense of withdrawal is actually an\naffirmative defense, even within that affirmative\ndefense, because it asks the question whether a\nconspiracy was complete as to a particular defendant.\nAnd to take advantage of that affirmative --\naffirmative defense within an affirmative defense, the\ndefendant has to take some affirmative act. And it\nmakes sense to require him to prove that he took those\nacts.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I wish I had -- we had the\nsupervening indictment before us. It's -- it's not in\nthe Joint Appendix.\nMS. HARRINGTON: It's very long.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But it -- it's described in\nthe Court of Appeals opinion as follows: \"According to\nthe indictment in the district court and the evidence of\nthe United States at trial, during the late 1980s and\n1990s, appellants Rodney Moore, Kevin Gray, John Raynor,\nCalvin Smith, Timothy Handy, and Lionel Nunn, along with\nothers, some of whom were also indicted, but tried\nseparately, conspired to conduct and did conduct an\nongoing drug distribution business in Washington.\"\nSo apparently, according to that\ndescription, it -- it was not charged as a conspiracy\nduring those five years. It was just charged as a\nconspiracy.\nMS. HARRINGTON: It was charged as an\nongoing conspiracy. It started before the beginning of\nthe limitations period.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's right. So it would\nhave been up to the defendant to prove that the statute\nof limitations barred -- barred his conviction.\nMS. HARRINGTON: That's right. That's\nwhy --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I suspect I agree.\nIf -- it's awfully tough to turn this on the presence or\nabsence of particular dates in the indictment, but\nthe -- the thing that motivates me -- I mean, I can see\nit's like a rabbit-duck. You know, is it a rabbit, or\nis it a duck? And -- and the -- the -- the thing that\nis so rare in the law --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's a jackalope, maybe. I\nnever heard of a rabbit-duck.\n(Laughter.)\nMS. HARRINGTON: Definitely a rabbit.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yet it's so rare, that the\ngovernment doesn't have the burden of proving beyond a\nreasonable doubt, that it suggests, when in doubt, say\nreasonable doubt.\nBut -- so what do you want? I mean, we've\nthought of duress. We've thought of self-defense.\nMS. HARRINGTON: Insanity is another.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Insanity.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Insanity.\nMS. HARRINGTON: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Anything else?\nMS. HARRINGTON: Extreme emotional\ndisturbance. Just a constitutional matter, this Court\nheld in Patterson that the government didn't need to\ndisprove that.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Ms. Harrington, would you\nagree that, as this argument is developing, what is\nreally at issue has less to do with the statute of\nlimitations than the nature of conspiracy? And one view\nis Petitioners', and it's embodied in some of the\nquestions that has been -- that have been asked, and\nit's this: That the crime is continuing to participate\nas a member of a conspiracy.\nAnd the other view is that a conspiracy is a\ndangerous thing. It's like rounding up a -- a pack of\nlions or wolves or setting loose some thing that\ncontinues to be a danger; and if you do that thing, by\njoining it, you are liable, criminally, for everything\nthat happens after that, even if, at a certain point,\nyou walk away, and you do nothing.\nNow, if -- if he's right, that it is active\nmembership, then there may be a problem for you here.\nBut if the other view is correct, that you are liable\nfor setting this thing in motion, whether or not you\ncontinue to do anything active in support of it during\nthe limitations period, then you are correct.\nNow, which is the -- which is the\nestablished view of the crime of conspiracy?\nMS. HARRINGTON: The view established by\nthis Court is that the crime of conspiracy continues,\nand once a person joins the conspiracy, he or she is\nliable for all the acts of his co-conspirators that were\nreasonably foreseeable in furtherance of the conspiracy.\nAnd that's true, even if that person, once he joins the\nconspiracy, doesn't ever do anything else --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but you recognize --\nyou recognize, as I think Justice Alito's question\ndoesn't, that there is -- there is a withdrawal defense\nand the question is how do you allocate the proof\nburden?\nSo your case accepts that there is a\nwithdrawal defense. Indeed, the judge gave a charge to\nthe jury on -- so the contest, as I understand it, the\ndifference between the two of you is you say, defendant\ncan say, I withdrew. If he does that, he has to prove\nit. And the defendant is saying, I have to produce\nenough, so that a jury could find I withdrew, but you\nhave the ultimate burden of persuasion.\nMS. HARRINGTON: That's right. And the\nPetitioners' view is grounded in due process concerns.\nOur view is that it is not a matter of due process\nbecause lack of withdrawal is not an element of the\ncrime of conspiracy.\nSo once you take due process out of the\nequation, then you have to ask what -- where would\nCongress have understood the burden -- the allocation of\nburdens to be, when it enacted these conspiracy statutes\nin 1970?\nAnd as a matter of logic, as a matter of\nhistory, as a matter of policy, there is no reason to\nthink Congress would have thought the burden of\npersuasion to be anywhere other than on the defendant.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And I suppose that a\nconspiracy is defined by relation to its criminal\nobjects, not to its membership. If there's five people\nthat conspired to rob a bank and one of the conspirators\nhas said, I'm out of here, I withdraw from the\nconspiracy, metaphysically, you might argue, well, it's\na new conspiracy because it's a new group.\nBut there is no support of the law for that,\nI take it.\nMS. HARRINGTON: No, this Court has said the\nopposite. It has said that -- you know, people can come\nand go in a conspiracy and --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Because it's the criminal\nobjects that define the conspiracy?\nMS. HARRINGTON: That's right. And, again,\nthere's no dispute in this case that the conspiracy was\nongoing.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But\nyou've indicted -- you haven't indicted a conspiracy.\nYou've indicted an individual, and it's not clear to me\nwhy you don't have to show that that was -- that that\nindividual's conduct was within the statute of\nlimitations period.\nMS. HARRINGTON: Because once --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: At least, when he\ncomes forward with -- under the burden of production,\nwith evidence suggesting the opposite.\nMS. HARRINGTON: Well, again, if we can take\nthe due process part off the table -- because we think\nit's not an element of lack of withdrawal, then you ask\nsort of, you know, what -- how would Congress have\nunderstood the state of the law to be when it enacted\nthese crimes, that's how the Court approached this\nquestion as to duress in Dixon.\nI think, as a matter of logic, because the\ngovernment can prove that someone is liable for a\nconspiracy by proving that he joined a conspiracy at\nsome point and that the conspiracy existed in the\nlimitations period, it wouldn't make sense to require\nthe government to disprove withdrawal, once it's\nasserted --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but Mr. Kramer\nsays it's not that big a deal, I mean, you don't have to\ndo -- he says you don't have to do anything at all.\nMS. HARRINGTON: I think that's kind of a\nremarkable assertion. If what he's saying is we have to\nbe disprove withdrawal, once the defendant asserts it\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, it's hard to imagine why the\ngovernment would ever -- once a defendant makes a prima\nfacie case of withdrawal, when the government would ever\njust say, oh, well, we'll sort of rest on our laurels\nand rest on the -- the evidence we have proving that he\njoined the conspiracy outside the limitations period.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose this thing doesn't\ncome up in the -- in the statute of limitations context.\nSuppose it comes up in the context of whether this\ndefendant is liable for an act committed by the\nco-conspirators after he withdrew. So it's the same\nissue of whether -- whether he withdrew or not, before\nthe murder of somebody, okay?\nHe said -- you know, before that occurred, I\nwas out of the conspiracy. What do our cases say\nabout -- about proving it in that context? Is the\nburden on the defendant? Or is the burden on the\nprosecution?\nMS. HARRINGTON: Your cases don't say\nanything about that. Our view is that the burden would\nbe --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And I didn't hear you.\nMS. HARRINGTON: Your cases don't say\nanything about that question, so our view would be that\nthe -- the burden stays on the defendant to prove that\nhe withdrew from a conspiracy in that context. The\nPinkerton liability isn't at issue here, so you don't\nneed to -- to wrap that up into this case, but our --\nour view would be the same.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Nothing to do with statute\nof limitations.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice Kennedy?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I was just -- I was\ncurious. In 1997, the Petitioner did report the\nidentity of another cooperating witness to Gray. You\ndon't -- you don't rely on that as showing that he was,\nindeed, part of the conspiracy? That's just irrelevant\nto your case?\nMS. HARRINGTON: No, we -- we do rely on\nthat. That's mentioned in our brief -- at the back end\nof the brief where we talk --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that was -- it was\nkind of a throwaway line. But why isn't that\ndispositive for you?\nMS. HARRINGTON: No, I think it is\ndispositive. And that was the reason we gave for the\nCourt to deny the petition for Writ of Certiorari\nbecause there is plenty of evidence in this case that\nthis defendant was in fact a member of the conspiracy.\nThere's evidence that the leaders of the conspiracy gave\nhim drugs and money.\nFirst of all, there's evidence that the\nreason he went to prison was to help out the leader of\nthe conspiracy. There was evidence he was paid back\nbecause they gave him drugs and money while he was in\nprison.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All of this is\nquestions for the jury under -- under the Petitioners'\nview, right?\nMS. HARRINGTON: Yes, certainly. I mean,\nunder -- under both views -- you know, it all -- all the\nevidence goes to whether -- you know, he had joined the\nconspiracy and whether he proved withdrawal.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Could I make sure I\nunderstand one part of your argument, Ms. Harrington?\nThe conclusion that timing -- the timing is not an\nelement. Now, take Justice Sotomayor's example of\nsomething which is not a conspiracy at all, let's say\nsomebody commits a robbery, and you have to show that\nthe person has committed a robbery and if the person\nbrings up the question of timing, you also have the\nburden of persuasion on that. But would the timing be\nan element in that case or not?\nMS. HARRINGTON: Not.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And so you are essentially\nsaying that this case should be treated just as every\nother case. You happen to have the burden of persuasion\nif somebody says the statute of limitations has been\nviolated, but the question of when conduct occurred is\nnever an element.\nMS. HARRINGTON: It's never an element. It\nis true that the government -- if a defendant raises a\nstatute of limitations defense, the government has the\nburden of proving that the crime was committed within\nthe limitations period. This Court said that in\nGrunewald. It did not offer any explanation for that,\nbut we have accepted that as our burden.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Why is it then -- I mean,\nwhy would Grunewald be right, that you do have the\nburden if, in fact, this isn't an element?\nMS. HARRINGTON: I think, just because it\nis an -- it is a burden that is placed on the government\nby Congress in Section 3282. I think -- I think a\nreason one could think that it makes sense is that the\ngovernment already has to prove all the things that it\nneeds to prove, to prove that the crime actually\nhappened.\nAnd generally, in proving that a crime\nactually happened beyond a reasonable doubt, you also\nprove when the crime actually happened. And so it\ndoesn't really add very much to what the government's\nburden already is in proving the crime.\nBut that sort of leads me into sort of the\npolicy reasons for not allocating a burden of persuasion\nto the government as to the issue of withdrawal. And\nthere are sort of four big reasons why Congress wouldn't\nhave understood the burden to be -- for policy\nreasons -- wouldn't have understood the burden to be on\na defendant as to the issue of withdrawal.\nThe first is that the defendant will almost\nalways be in a better position to have the information\nabout whether he withdrew, except in cases where he\nwithdraws by making a clean rest with the government, in\nwhich case, it's hard to imagine he's going to be\nindicted for -- for the indictment past that period,\nexcept in those cases, he will know what he said in\nsecret to his co-conspirators.\nSecond, the government will often be\nprevented from bringing up evidence to rebut an\nassertion of withdrawal because it can't make a\ndefendant testify, and it often won't be able to make\nhis co-conspirators testify.\nThird, a defendant doesn't have to give any\nadvanced notice of his intention to rely on a withdrawal\ndefense, and so often, he can scuttle the defendant's --\nthe government's ability to procure any other evidence\nit may be able to procure relevant to the issue of -- of\nwithdrawal.\nAnd, fourth, Petitioner's role would\nencourage spurious assertions of withdrawal because it\nhas -- it could have the effect of essentially making\nthe government prove something extra. It already has to\nprove that he joined the conspiracy willingly, that the\nconspiracy existed in the limitations period.\nBut under the government's -- under the\nPetitioner's role -- excuse me -- the government would\nalso have to prove that the defendant essentially took\nsome other act to show his membership or somehow\nre-agreed to the conspiracy --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that last\npoint seems to me spurious itself because, to prove\nwithdrawal, he's got to accept the fact that he was in\nthe conspiracy in the first place. So if he doesn't\nhave a good withdrawal defense, it's unlikely that he\nwould raise it because it would cost him any argument he\nhas against participation in a conspiracy in the first\nplace.\nMS. HARRINGTON: But in cases where -- such\nas this, where a defendant goes through a period of\ninaction with respect to the conspiracy, which this\nCourt said in Hyde is not enough to withdraw, then there\nwould be an incentive to raise a spurious assertion of\nwithdrawal because it would require the government to\nsort of -- to rebut that by proving that the defendant\nhad done something within that period, which it doesn't\nhave to prove in order to establish liability.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I suppose he could present\nhis defense in the alternative, I didn't belong to the\nconspiracy, and anyway, I withdrew. I mean, he can make\nboth of those points, can't he?\nMS. HARRINGTON: He certainly can. I think\nthere's a good deal of risk in that for a defendant.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but, I mean,\nthat works in a civil case. But, I mean, in a criminal\ncase, it's kind of a big thing to say -- begin my -- my\nfirst argument is that, I withdrew from this horrendous\nconspiracy that's been going on.\nMS. HARRINGTON: That --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Or then I wasn't a\npart of it after that.\nThat's a little different in a criminal\ncontext.\nMS. HARRINGTON: It's true. And the theory\nof defense in this case was, in fact, that there were\nmany separate conspiracies, not that any particular\nperson had withdrawn, and it only came up, as my friend\npointed out, because the jury asked a question about it.\nIf I can just sort of wrap up on a -- on a\nbroader note? A defendant does not become liable for a\ncriminal conspiracy casually. As the jury was charged\nin this case, the government has to prove that every\ndefendant was aware of the existence of the conspiracy,\nthat every defendant understood that it had an illegal\nobjective, and that every defendant willingly agreed to\nparticipate in the conspiracy with the aim -- aim of\nadvancing that illegal objective.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You have -- you have\nto prove that every defendant did?\nMS. HARRINGTON: That every defendant\nwillingly joined the conspiracy, yes, with the\nunderstanding that they were advancing some illegal\nobjective, the objective of the conspiracy. Now, that's\na high evidentiary --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Let me -- so you\ncharge ten people as participating in this conspiracy,\nand the jury determines that one wasn't, then\neverybody's off the hook?\nMS. HARRINGTON: No, no, no. No. I'm\nsorry.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you don't have to\nprove --\nMS. HARRINGTON: To prove liability for each\nperson, you have to prove that that person --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.\nMS. HARRINGTON: -- satisfied all these\nthings. I'm sorry --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You have to treat\nthem as individuals.\nMS. HARRINGTON: That's what I meant, yes,\nyes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Which is what your\nfriend is trying to argue for in this case?\nMS. HARRINGTON: Right. But that is -- this\nis high evidentiary burden that the government has to\nbear to prove that each defendant took some affirmative\naction to get into the conspiracy. And once the -- once\nthe government proves that a defendant was a member of\nthe conspiracy, then it's on the defendant to prove --\nto take some affirmative action to get himself out of\nthe conspiracy.\nAnd it only makes sense to require him to\nprove that he took that act, instead of requiring the\ngovernment to prove negative that he didn't take that\nact in every case.\nIf there are no further questions?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is this -- the burden\nallocation, is this a more hypothetical academic\nquestion? I mean, you pointed out that you had ample\nevidence to show that he remained a member of the\nconspiracy.\nSo does the allocation of burden of\npersuasion to the defendant versus proof of production\nto the defendant, persuasion to the government, does it\nreally make much difference? Does it have much\npractical consequence?\nMS. HARRINGTON: I mean, it would not have\nmade a difference in this case, for the reasons you\nsuggest, we had good evidence that he had active\nparticipation within the limitations period. It can\nmake a difference in some other cases -- you know, I\nthink, as a practical matter, most criminal conspiracies\nthat are charged in the Federal system involve activity\nthat was more recent than some of the activity that was\ninvolved in this case.\nBut it certainly can come up, and -- you\nknow, if we didn't have the type of evidence that we did\nabout this particular defendant's behavior in prison,\nthen it would have been hard to rebut his assertion of\nwithdrawal caused by his incarceration. So it\ndefinitely can come up.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, when you say\nit wouldn't have made a difference in this case, you're\nbasically saying you had some good evidence. But a jury\ncould have always decided against you, right?\nMS. HARRINGTON: Oh, it certainly could\nhave, right. It could have decided against us on the\nwhole thing, but --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but I think\nit's a little much to say it wouldn't make a difference\nbecause the jury would definitely have ruled in your\nfavor.\nMS. HARRINGTON: Okay. I -- yeah. I didn't\nmean to be brazen about it. We think we had good\nevidence that the Petitioner continued in the conspiracy\nin this case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMs. Harrington.\nMr. Kramer, you have four minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF A.J. KRAMER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. KRAMER: Thank you.\nI would just like to start with one quick\npoint. My friend said that the government would never\nrest on its laurels, but that's precisely what they did\nin this case. It was 12 days into jury deliberation\nwhen they said, go ahead and instruct the jury on\nwithdrawal, so they rested on the evidence that had been\npresented in the trial. So that's precisely what they\ndid.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, that's because they\nthought that you had the burden. And it -- it does\nstrike me that, if you are right that this is an\nelement -- membership in the conspiracy at a particular\ntime -- and the government has the burden, this idea\nthat the government could -- you know, just sort of say,\nwell, we don't have any evidence, but we think you\nshould presume that we're right, I mean, that's -- the\ngovernment couldn't do that if you are right.\nMR. KRAMER: The -- the government could\njust rest on whatever they had presented originally and\ntell the jury that's plenty to prove beyond -- to meet\nour burden of proof.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, if you make an\nassertion, and they don't really respond to the\nassertion and -- you win.\nMR. KRAMER: It -- I mean, it happens all\nthe time. The defendants say, I didn't do it, and the\ngovernment presents their evidence and say, that defense\nis nonsense, we presented overwhelming evidence.\nIn fact, in this case, also they did -- they\ndidn't ask for the instruction because they thought it\nwas our burden. They agreed, in the end, that the jury\nshould be instructed --\nJUSTICE ALITO: I think the crux of your\nargument is that the government is going to have to\nprove, beyond a reasonable doubt, active participation\nin the conspiracy during the statute of limitations\nperiod because it is impossible for the prosecution to\nprove beyond a reasonable doubt that on no day, during a\nfive-year period, did the defendant withdraw from the\nconspiracy.\nIt simply can't be done. This person was\nunder 24-hour video surveillance for the whole five-year\nperiod.\nMR. KRAMER: All they have to prove,\nJustice Alito, is that the person was a member of the\nconspiracy within the limitations period. That could be\ndone by the inference that they were a member outside\nthe limitations period and say that there was just\ninsufficient -- that the --\nJUSTICE ALITO: And say what? That there\nwas insufficient evidence to prove --\nMR. KRAMER: No.\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- the opposite of what they\nhave to prove?\nMR. KRAMER: No, that they -- insufficient\nevidence doesn't create a reasonable doubt in what they\nare required to prove, which is membership within the\nlimitations period.\nJUSTICE ALITO: I thought you argue that\nevery day, that there is -- that something has to be\nproved beyond a reasonable doubt because the prosecution\nhasn't provided sufficient evidence?\nMR. KRAMER: It is. And the prosecution\nstands up and says, we presented plenty of evidence\nthat -- that there is no reasonable doubt here at all.\nAnd that happens every day, needless to say, that people\nare convicted by that argument when --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Kramer, if they\nreally have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that\nthere is membership in the conspiracy during the\nlimitations period, they couldn't just come in and say,\nwell, there's membership in the conspiracy before the\nlimitations period, and, you know, you should assume\nthat it continued.\nI mean that's not a\nbeyond-a-reasonable-doubt kind of proof, is it?\nMR. KRAMER: They get a permissive\ninference. And there are many cases when I think that\nwould be proof beyond a reasonable doubt for a jury,\nabsent some conflicting evidence presented by the\ndefendant, more than just a proffer.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Couldn't you argue they have\nthe burden of proving that the defendant did not\nwithdraw during this five-year period? They have the\nburden of proving that. And did you hear any evidence\nfrom them that -- did you hear evidence disproving\nthat -- that he didn't withdraw during that period?\nThere is no evidence on that.\nMR. KRAMER: Of course --\nJUSTICE ALITO: You can make that argument?\nMR. KRAMER: Yes. Or did we prove -- did\nyou hear any evidence -- that there was no evidence that\nMr. Smith was a member during the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Your -- I'm sorry. The\nThomas Crown Affair again, all the evidence shows he\ntook $10,000 from the bank. He testifies and says, oh,\nI was going to give it back, okay? The prosecution puts\non nothing. The jury says, are you kidding?\nMR. KRAMER: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay.\nMR. KRAMER: I mean, and that happens every\nday, I think, in cases where the prosecution just stands\nup and says, you heard that evidence, nobody would think\nthat is a reasonable doubt, that someone was not a\nmember.\nThank you very much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
