CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument

States.
Mr. Newton.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRENT E. NEWTON
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. NEWTON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
Petitioner was not present at the bench
conference and did not have the assistance of an
interpreter when the magistrate judge solicited his
attorney's consent to conduct jury selection. The
record does not reflect the Petitioner personally
consented or ever learned of his attorney's consent.
Whether defense counsel CAN unilaterally waive a
criminal defendant's right to an Article III judge at
jury selection, as occurred in this case, is a serious
constitutional question. Applying the constitutional
avoidance doctrine, this Court should avoid answering
this question by interpreting the "Additional Duties"
Clause of the Federal Magistrates Act to require
defendant's explicit personal waiver of the right to an
Article III judge at felony jury selection.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Newton, you're not
claiming in this case that the defendant was any way
disadvantaged by the magistrate judge conducting the
voir dire, are you?
MR. NEWTON: I'm contending that the denial
of his right to an Article III judge at felony jury
selection violated his rights.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there was no
objection to any of the proceedings by the magistrate
judge. There were no objections to any -- well, she
didn't do the questioning. She allowed the lawyer to do
the questioning.
MR. NEWTON: Well, I think it was a
combination, Your Honor. No, we're not making any
allegation of discrete error during the jury selection
process. We're contending that there should have been a
personal waiver of the right to an Article III judge.
The "Additional Duties" Clause --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This may not be a
pertinent question, but where does the right to voir
dire come from in the first place?
MR. NEWTON: The Court has discussed the
right to voir dire in capital cases and in non-capital
cases as it relates to the right to a fair trial, the
right to an impartial jury --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it's derivative
from other rights? In other words, it helps implement
the right to a fair trial, in the Batson context helps
guard against an equal protection violation, but it's
not on its own a free-standing right.
MR. NEWTON: Well, Your Honor, I would say
that the Court has said that, in a Federal case
particularly, you have a right to an Article III,
Section 2 right to a jury, as well as a Sixth Amendment
right, and the Court has referred to this as an
allocation of Federal judicial power in the people as
well as in judges. So selecting the jury obviously is a
-- has constitutional implications with respect to the
structure of Article III as well as any personal right a
defendant may have to -- to an impartial duty.
The "Additional Duties" Clause is silent
about the type of waiver or consent required and the
silence is understandable.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, where a defendant is
waiving a jury trial or pleading guilty, that's
something that an ordinary person can probably readily
understand. But how likely is it that an ordinary
defendant is going to have any kind of independent
opinion on the question of whether it's better for the
voir dire to be presided over by a district judge as
opposed to a magistrate judge? Isn't the situation
going to be in the vast, vast majority of cases that
your client will simply turn to you and say, which do
you think is better, and whatever the lawyer recommends,
that's what the client is going to do? Isn't that the
realistic situation?
MR. NEWTON: Your Honor, I don't think
that's necessarily true. I've had -- I represent people
in trial court as well as on appeal, and I've had many
clients who like district judges better than magistrates
or magistrates better than district judges, depending on
how they've encountered them in prior proceedings. So I
don't think that's an assumption I would make.
And, more importantly, other personal
rights -- the right to a grand jury, a petty jury --
those are rights that a lot of defendants don't
understand. I've had to explain to foreign clients what
a jury is because they don't have juries in foreign
countries.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there's a big
difference between having a judge trial and a jury of
one's peers. The difference between having a magistrate
judge and an Article III judge to do the voir dire
doesn't have -- is not a question of the same dimension.
MR. NEWTON: Well, Your Honor, it's hard to
put these rights in terms of relative importance. The
Framers clearly believed Article III independence was
essential to our separation of powers and to the rights
of defendants. John Marshall -- the Court in Hatter
quoted from former Chief Justice John Marshall saying
that the rights -- the right to an independent judge is
perhaps most important in a -- in a criminal case
because the rights of the most powerful person, the
prosecutor, versus --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, we're not talking
about a trial. We're talking about the voir dire. And
perhaps you could tell me one piece of information. In
the Federal proceedings that I've observed, it's always
the judge who does the questioning, and this one seemed
to me extraordinary. The magistrate said it was her
practice to let the lawyers do it, right?
MR. NEWTON: Well, certain judges in Federal
court tend to give the lawyers a lot of leeway. Other
ones -- other judges I've appeared before do it
themselves. I think it depends. But ultimately it's
the magistrate who is ruling on challenges for cause or
ruling on what questions are appropriate.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Whose thumb is the
magistrate under? Is he under the thumb of Article I or
Article II or Article III?
MR. NEWTON: Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Who decides whether he
stays on or she stays on as a magistrate?
MR. NEWTON: Article III judges are the ones
who select magistrate judges --
JUSTICE SCALIA: So we're really not talking
here about giving away any Article III power. I mean,
the magistrate is only subject to Article III.
MR. NEWTON: Well, Your Honor, the
magistrate judges have been permitted to exercise the
attributes of Article III power when they are adjuncts.
The Court in Gomez unanimously thought that the
magistrate's role at felony jury selection was not
really that of an adjunct because there was no
meaningful Article III review of the --
JUSTICE SCALIA: That may well be, but the
reason -- the reason presumably is that an Article III
judge, which goes -- who goes through a much more
substantial process of selection and confirmation is
much more qualified. Now, if you want to make that
argument, that's fine, but that's a quite different
argument from saying that we're giving away Article III
powers to magistrates, right? Magistrates are creatures
of Article III.
MR. NEWTON: Well, I think it's a twofold
argument. It's one that we presume that Article III
judges who have gone through the Senate confirmation and
presidential appointment process, that they are more
qualified as a general rule. But it is also an Article
III exercise of power because magistrate judges do not
have those protections that Article III provides to
life-tenured district judges. So it is -- it's both of
those things.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Would you go back to I
think it was to Justice Ginsburg's question about the
comparative significance of the waiver here. The
paradigm examples of waivers that have to be personal
are, you know, waivers of counsel, waivers of the right
to put the State to trial. This question of waiving an
Article III judge as opposed to an Article III appointed
magistrate just does not seem to rise to the
significance of -- of the -- of the -- of those other
paradigm waivers and what is -- what is your response to
that? You started to say that, you know, that the
Framers said Article III judges are important because
they -- they have independence and so on. But beyond
that kind of high theoretical level, is there anything
in practical terms that you think brings this kind of a
waiver to the point of significance of, say, waiving
counsel?
MR. NEWTON: Yes, Your Honor. There are
basically three characteristics that I can discern in
the Court's jurisprudence about other personal rights
that must be personally waived by a defendant on the
record. First of all, it obviously must be a
fundamental right, and I think that the Court's
decisions in Hatter and Gomez and the plurality opinion
in Northern Pipeline, -- all those decisions I think
establish that the right to an Article III judge at a
critical stage of a criminal case is a fundamental
right. But there's more than just that. That's
necessary but not sufficient, because we have lots of
fundamental rights that can be waived during the trial
by the attorney.
The other two characteristics are I think
what distinguish this right and make it more like
waiving counsel and waiving a petit jury and a grand
jury and the right to go to trial at all. And besides
being fundamental, the second characteristic is that
this right concerns the players in the game as opposed
to the rules of the game, the framework of the
proceedings in the sense of the players. The right to a
jury trial, the right to a grand jury, the right to
counsel, those are rights that concern the players in
the game, as opposed to, say, the confrontational --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I see what you're
doing. You're constructing your argument so that we
have structural protections. I can understand that
argument, but Justice Souter's question points out just
as a practical matter this is not nearly as important as
a failure to object to illegally seized evidence, a post
-- a post-arrest delay, open courtroom, all of which are
subject to waiver.
MR. NEWTON: Well, Your Honor, if I can
answer your question, but also the third characteristic.
The third characteristic of this kind of right is
timing, how it's waived. The Court in Barker v. Wingo
said these personal rights are to be waived at a
discrete point in time, as opposed to something during
the heat of battle of the adversarial process. So --
and I would respectfully disagree that the right to an
Article III judge, at least the right to have it without
a personal waiver, is a fundamental right. This is
something the Framers considered to be of utmost
importance, and in Hatter the Court said the
considerations that led the Framers to believe this was
an extremely important right --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I was interested in
your comment on trying cases, but to say that you have
to sit down and explain to the -- to the defendant the
difference between the magistrate and an Article III and
why you like this particular magistrate -- it's the
attorney that does all the questioning, after all -- it
seems to me is -- is a burden. It's not justified by
the position that you're -- you're submitting to us.
MR. NEWTON: Well, Your Honor, Congress has
made the judgment that this is such a fundamental right
that it must be personally waived by a defendant.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In practice, it's
more a tactical decision than a theoretical one. I mean
you can explain to your client the difference between
Article III and a magistrate, but he's going to be more
interested in your judgment about, oh, judge so and so
doesn't let you get away with anything on voir dire, you
know, he runs a tight ship. This magistrate will let me
raise all sorts of other things. I mean, it's like an
objection at trial, in other words. It's going to be a
tactical decision rather than a theoretical
constitutional one.
MR. NEWTON: Your Honor, the very same thing
could be said of waiving a jury or a grand jury.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if you get to
that point, which case of ours holds that the right to a
jury trial is a personal right that the defendant must
waive rather than waive through counsel?
MR. NEWTON: Two cases Your Honor: Patton
v. United States, 1932, and Adams ex rel. U.S. v.
McCann, which reaffirmed, and the Court has cited those
two cases repeatedly for the proposition that this is a
right that must be personally waived. The fact that
there is a --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You say it was the holding
in Patton?
MR. NEWTON: Patton I suppose would have
been --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I suppose it was dicta.
MR. NEWTON: But it became enshrined in
Adams, and it has been cited repeatedly for that
proposition. The rule reflects it. The rule of
criminal procedure reflects it. The fact that there is
a strategic or a tactical aspect --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought what Adams stood
for was that the defendant can himself waive the right
to jury without advice of counsel, that if he wants to
do it on his own he can do it without counsel. It
doesn't mean that if counsel does it without his
objection at the time it's invalid.
MR. NEWTON: Well, Your Honor, it's -- the
language in Adams which quotes from Patton says it must
be the express, intelligent consent of the defendant,
which has been widely interpreted as personal --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that can be
expressed through counsel. I mean, does -- you know,
does your client consent to this? Yes.
I mean it's quite a different question to
say that he has to be the one who stands up in court and
says it.
MR. NEWTON: Well, my alternative position
is, at the very least, the record needs to reflect that
when counsel speaks, counsel is directly speaking with
the approval of the client.
In Peretz that was the situation. In Peretz
the pretrial conference involved a waiver by the defense
attorney in the presence of his client and then followed
up by -- at the jury selection process the magistrate
said: Mr. Attorney, do I have the consent of "your
client"? And this was, again, in the presence of the
defendant.
That's in marked contrast to what we have in
this case, which is all indications were going to be it
was going to be Judge Kazen picking the jury, the
Article III judge. And, then, all of a sudden, the
magistrate judge appears and directs only the attorneys
to come to the bench.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: You were referring a
while back to the Gomez case. And if I remember that
case correctly, it was the defense counsel who made the
objection to the magistrate; and there's nothing to
indicate whether the defense counsel had done that in
consultation with the defendant. We don't have any idea
what the defendant's wishes were, but it was the
defendant -- it was the lawyer who raised the objection.
MR. NEWTON: Well, Your Honor, I think
that's distinguishable because when one is objecting to
the violation of a right, that's different from
acquiescing in a knowing and voluntary and intelligent
waiver of the right.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: It was the lawyer's
choice, and we have no indication that it wasn't -- it
was anything other than the strategic choice of the
lawyer. And your position is that it must come from the
client, and there's no indication that it did in the
Gomez case.
MR. NEWTON: Well, Your Honor, in Gomez it
was an objection to a alleged violation of Article III,
as opposed to a waiver of the right to an Article III
judge. So it's -- it's the converse of what we have in
this case.
In this case, there was no showing on the
record implicitly or explicitly that Mr. Gonzalez,
Petitioner in this case, waived or knowingly acquiesced
in his attorney's waiver.
I want to return, if I could, to -- to
Congress's intent. In 18 U.S.C. Section 3401(b),
Congress was crystal clear they believed in a
misdemeanor case the waiver of a right to an Article III
judge had to be personal and expressed by the Defendant.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But, of course, that
was for the whole trial. This is for a very discrete
aspect prior to trial.
MR. NEWTON: In Peretz the Court equated an
entire delegation of a misdemeanor trial to delegation
of felony jury selection. They were comparable, the
Court said. The dissent in that case, at least Justice
Marshall's dissent, said it's more important. So we
have at least eight members --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Peretz, also, if I
understand the case correctly, equated the waiver with a
failure to object. It seems to me that Peretz undercuts
your argument.
MR. NEWTON: Well, Your Honor, as I -- as I
think I've explained in the brief, Peretz is full of
many statements that are ambiguous. But everything in
Peretz has --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you say they are
ambiguous, but isn't it -- I've reread Peretz after many
years getting ready for this argument, and it seems to
me that it's difficult to read Peretz without reading
the "waiver failure to object" phraseology as being
equivalent.
MR. NEWTON: Well, Your Honor, Peretz has to
be read in light of two things:
One, it has to be read in light of the facts
of that case where there was a failure to object after
the attorney had personally -- or had stated his client
personally considered it. Secondly, Peretz was decided
before the Court in Olano distinguished between waivers
and forfeitures. "Consent," even in the Fourth
Amendment context, means at least knowing acquiescence.
"Waiver" clearly means an intentional and knowing
relinquishment of a right, and mere silence cannot be
interpreted as -- a mere failure to object cannot be --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, yes, but --
everybody concedes that, but the question is by whom?
Certainly very many rights, you will acknowledge, can be
waived by counsel.
MR. NEWTON: Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: So you can't simply say it
requires an express and knowing waiver, attributing that
express and knowing waiver to the defendant.
Sure, it does, but who has to be "express,"
and who has to be "knowing"? That's the issue before us
here.
MR. NEWTON: Yes, Your Honor. I was
responding to -- there is really -- the Government makes
two arguments based on Peretz: One, that mere silence
equals to a waiver or consent, and that's what I was
responding to.
The second argument -- Peretz did not deal
with the issue of who is the one to consent, because in
Peretz there was, practically speaking, personal
consent. The Court reframed the questions presented in
Peretz to assume consent. There is --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, except for one thing,
and that is, if -- if it is sound to say that Peretz
equated "waiver" with "failure to object," "failure to
object" is a -- is a failure, if you will, of counsel,
not of the defendant. Defendants don't get up and make
objections; counsel do. And, therefore, it seems to me
the implication of Peretz is that it would be a -- a
decision of the lawyer that would count for
constitutional purposes.
MR. NEWTON: Your Honor, I would think in
certain cases, if it's a personal right and a defense
lawyer stands up and says in the presence of his client,
my client consents, and the client doesn't object or
respond that, I disagree, then it's fair perhaps to
assume there's a sufficient showing of -- of personal
waiver by the defendant.
But, again, what we have in this case is
just vastly different. We have nothing in the record --
JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but the point was you
were saying that in fact Peretz cannot be read as
authority for the Government's position because the
facts in Peretz, quite as you correctly note, were that
the -- the client had in fact consented, or that was the
representation to the Court. And my point simply was
that does not seem to have been the reasoning of the
Court, because the reasoning of the Court in equating
"waiver" with "failure to object" was a reasoning that
in its reference to "failure to object" seemed to
pinpoint the actions of the lawyer alone. Clients don't
object; lawyers do. A failure to object, therefore,
refers to, in effect, a failure by the lawyer, alone;
and that would be the only significant datum for
constitutional purposes. What is your response to that?
MR. NEWTON: I disagree. I think that you
have to read Peretz in light of the very special facts
in that case, which involve two statements in the
presence of the defendant: That the defense was not
objecting or was consenting; and, then, in particular,
the defendant, himself, was giving consent.
And I think you have to also look at the
Court's repeated focus on the fact that Peretz himself
gave consent in that case.
There was no occasion to decide which --
which party, the lawyer or the defendant, was the one to
properly waive in the Peretz case.
JUSTICE ALITO: Do you think there has to be
a showing on the record that the waiver is knowing?
MR. NEWTON: Under 18 U.S.C. Section
3401(b), which I contend is the obvious analog for
waiving in the felony context, yes, absolutely. I
think, at the very least, to avoid a constitutional
doubt, and that's -- also, I should say up front, all of
these arguments that we are -- or points we're engaging
in here simply show this is a serious constitutional
question.
JUSTICE ALITO: So you think there has to be
a colloquy like a Rule 11 colloquy or a waiver of
counsel's, this is the different, this is what a
district judge is, this is what a magistrate judge is,
do you understand the difference between the two?
MR. NEWTON: It's going to obviously depend
on the defendant because every case involving waiver
depends on the particular circumstances. But, at the
very least, there needs to be a showing of a knowing,
voluntary waiver of a right to an Article III judge.
This is done every day in America.
JUSTICE STEVENS: I know it's a different
context, but -- it does not relate to the magistrate
versus Article III judge, but do you think that a lawyer
could stipulate that the judge or a magistrate presiding
could do all the questioning and the lawyers would do
none, without the -- without the express consent of his
client?
MR. NEWTON: In terms of the jury selection
process?
JUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me that the
voir dire is peculiarly the -- an area in which the
lawyer knows what he is up to and what's at stake, and
the client does not.
MR. NEWTON: Well, I would think the lawyer
could in that situation for the simple reason that you
have already at that point established, presumably, an
Article III judge is presiding or it has been validly
waived.
But picking the jury, the jury selection or,
more properly, the jury exclusion, because it's really
excluding jurors rather than picking them, that is a
qualitatively different thing than deciding whether
there is a jury in the first place or whether an Article
III judge should preside over the jury selection. So I
would say the lawyer could do that, because that's more
the heat of the battle, the adversarial process working,
as opposed to a discrete point in time before it.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think a
jurisdiction could adopt a rule that was especially
careful about selecting the jury panel and then decided
they would take the first 12 jurors off an arbitrary
list, just to pick them at random and have no voir dire
during the trial, just to have a preliminary screening
of qualifications of the -- of the entire panel?
MR. NEWTON: I think certain jurisdictions
have done that before. I think there's been bargaining
by prosecutors and defense counsel. That again occurs
during the adversarial workings of the proceedings as
opposed to the discrete point in time before.
The -- Justice Alito asked about how this
procedure would work. This has gone on every day in
American courtrooms since 1979. Every day around
America in courtrooms, Federal courtrooms, in magistrate
judge cases over misdemeanors this kind of colloquy goes
on. This is done every day. It's done in the very same
courthouse that Mr. Gonzalez was tried in because they
regularly refer felony guilty pleas to magistrate
judges.
And in the brief I've cited a couple of
cases reported in Westlaw where District Judge Kazen has
accepted reports and recommendations where the
magistrate judge said, I went over the right to Article
III judge with the defendant personally, he executed a
waiver, and this was done on the record.
So, this is not some innovative proceeding.
This has been done since 1979 when they amended Section
3401(b). The legislative history to Section 3401(b)
clearly shows that Congress believed the right to an
Article III judge was a constitutional right that had to
be personally waived by the defendant. That is further
evidence this is a serious constitutional question. The
Court should avoid answering that serious constitutional
question because you can easily interpret the Federal
Magistrate's Act, in particular the "Additional Duties"
Clause, to allow for consensual delegation, which Gomez
talked about and Peretz talked about, only if it's
personal consent. So, this is not a leap of logic to
think that Congress would have intended this in a felony
case.
Gomez held Congress never intended this,
this was not something Congress intended, so the Court
is going to have to fill in a gap in terms of what kind
of consent is appropriate. And Congress has clearly
signaled they believe a defendant's personal express
consent is the type that is required. At the very least
there is a serious constitutional question.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Was there a right to
voir dire at common law? I have the impression the
judge would send somebody out and, you know, grab the
first 12 people they could find.
MR. NEWTON: I don't know, Your Honor. I
don't know the answer to that question.
If I could --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Could I --
MR. NEWTON: Sure.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Are we supposed to go
through every one of the rights that a defendant has in
a trial one by one and decide, you know, this one the
lawyer can make, this one the defendant must make
personally?
MR. NEWTON: No, Your Honor. I think --
JUSTICE SCALIA: One by one? I mean, I
never thought that that was the approach we take.
MR. NEWTON: I think the Court has already
decided the vast majority of these. Taylor clearly
referred to the confrontation or the Compulsory Process
Clause. There are numerous other cases in which the
Court has said, at least implicitly, that it's waived by
the lawyer's failure to object. But there are a special
class of rights: The right to a jury trial, the right
to a grand jury, the right to counsel, the right to
plead not guilty.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: That gets back to your
structural argument, which makes a certain amount of
sense just insofar as knowing where the line is.
On the other hand, I'm just not sure of the
practical significance of the client's participation
when it's really the attorney who is making the decision
whether or not this magistrate will allow him to strut
his stuff in front of the jury for a little longer than
the district judge would. I just don't see how the
client can really have much informed input into that at
all.
MR. NEWTON: Well, Your Honor, the Framers
clearly believed it was an extremely important right for
defendants. Congress clearly believed this was a
constitutional right defendants had to personally waive.
The fact that the lawyer may be in a better position to
make the judgment would be equally true in waiving a
jury or a grand jury.
And if I could reserve my additional time
for rebuttal.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Mr. Newton.
Ms. Blatt?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MS. BLATT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
The decision whether to have a magistrate
judge conduct voir dire is a strategic call that counsel
is uniquely qualified to make. Counsel is best equipped
to determine whether the magistrate judge's particular
style, reputation or practice in addressing prospective
jurors or resolving objections outweigh the independence
conferred by Article III.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course, it might
be said of the right to plead guilty as well. The
lawyer has a lot more experience with what kind of
sentence the judge is going to impose, what the odds are
of the jury returning a verdict of innocence. I mean,
the fact that the lawyer is better situated to make the
judgment doesn't mean it's not a fundamental right.
MS. BLATT: That's correct. And for the few
fundamental decisions where the defendant must
personally explicitly make, they have a monumental
impact on the defendant, and they protect values that
extend beyond mere -- mere trial strategy.
If a defendant is indicted for a criminal
offense, he readily understands he's going to have to
decide, do I want to plead guilty, do I want to stand
trial, do I want counsel, do I want a jury. He does not
readily appreciate that decisions that occurred during
voir dire, such as whether to have an Article III judge
or a magistrate, whether to exercise peremptory
challenges, whether to challenge jurors for cause,
whether to object to the prosecutor's actions. These
are all decisions that are entrusted to counsel's best
professional judgment and his fiduciary obligation to
represent the defendant.
The defendant -- I mean, the defense lawyer
also speaks for the client in exercising the defendant's
confrontation clause rights, introduce or object to
evidence, to object to the closing of the courtroom.
There's just a small handful of fundamental rights. And
for the vast majority of criminal defendants, they don't
even have Article III rights, Mr. Chief Justice; they're
in State court.
So it's an important right. It implicates
important trial issues. But nonetheless, counsel is
best equipped to make it. And I do think, unlike the
decision whether you're going to be convicted or stand
trial or even testify, this is a decision where the
defendant is overwhelmingly likely to defer to counsel's
tactical and strategic judgment.
In this case, I just wanted to point out one
other thing about the magistrate. As Justice Ginsburg
said, she not only let the lawyers pose their own
questions to the jurors, she also gave the lawyers each
an extra peremptory challenge. And that just shows that
magistrate judges can have particular styles or
practice, and counsel would be uniquely situated to
assess the value of that.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Did she rule on strikes for
cause?
MS. BLATT: They were all by consensus, so
yes, she ruled on them in that jurors were excused for
various reasons. But there was -- it was pretty much by
consensus by defense counsel and the prosecutor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But that -- I mean, that
is, I suppose, the most significant power that the judge
who is conducting the voir dire or presiding at the voir
dire has, to allow or not allow a strike --
MS. BLATT: Right, and defense counsel's
going to have to weigh in any given case whether the
magistrate judge is going to rule on any objections and
de novo review is possible, but it's difficult as a
practical matter, as the court noted in Peretz. The
defense counsel is best situated to decide, and I want
to get the most favorable jury I can for my client,
what's the best way to do that? Is this magistrate
judge better off -- am I better off with which one?
And defense counsel, if he has any concerns,
can object to the magistrate's role and then would be
entitled under the Federal Magistrate Act to have an
Article III judge conduct voir dire.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose -- I know you
don't like to contemplate this, but that we accept the
Petitioner's position that there has to be, that the
client has to waive. Would we be better off just
adopting the rule that there has to be express waiver,
or would you then recommend that we ask the further
question whether or not there was an implied consent?
MS. BLATT: An implied consent in --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, he was there, he
probably knew and the record shows that he knew what was
going on.
MS. BLATT: If an explicit personal --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I, frankly, don't think we
should go down that route.
MS. BLATT: If a personal explicit waiver is
required, there wasn't one here. The express waiver was
by defense counsel, so it would not meet that test of
having -- I don't know what the implied waiver would be.
There is an expressed waiver by defense counsel.
If counsel just said nothing and there was
no objection, which is not what is at issue in this
case, then there would be a question on how do you read
this Court's decision in Peretz.
JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask how it works in
practice? Does the magistrate's ruling on objections to
jurors, are those rulings subject to review by the
district judge or are they final?
MS. BLATT: Under this Court's decision in
Peretz, there would be de novo review at the end of the
process. And here an Article III judge actually swore
in the jury but there was, nothing was ever objected to
by the magistrate's role. There was no --
JUSTICE STEVENS: But in practice, as I
understand it, very often the judge will, will review
the magistrate's decisions on contested objections.
MS. BLATT: He can. Right. Yes. And if
the Court said in Peretz that the Constitution would
require that the review be de novo and they recognize in
a footnote this Court that as a practical matter it
might be difficult to reweigh credibility
determinations, and you have the same kind of issues
when a magistrate judge conducts Social Security cases
or suppression hearings, the magistrate rules on or
weighs credibility and there is a de novo review by the
Article III judge.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: How does that work? You
have some jurors, and you have juror's excused for
cause, and there is an argument about that, then that
juror has to sit down and wait for two days and then
they go back and they review that before the district
judge. I just don't know mechanically how that can
work.
MS. BLATT: I don't know if it can be done
that day. I mean, in this case, the jury selection was
just a matter of a couple of hours.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Excuse me, if the Article
III judge says, oh, this should not have been excused
for cause, then you go back and bump the juror.
MS. BLATT: I think this discussion just
shows why a defendant -- this would not be a right that
he would readily appreciate and understand. This is
something defense counsel would just decide. And is it
-- in this particular trial, and this was a short drug
trial, this voir dire occurred without incident and it
was pretty routine. Is this something that if it were
different type of case defense counsel might think, no,
I don't want whatever disruption it might be and we want
an Article III judge. And defense counsel is of course
able to object.
I also wanted to point out --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you -- do you
think the right to a jury trial is something that has to
be personally waived by the defendant or can that be
waived through counsel?
MS. BLATT: We read a discussion of it in
Florida v. Nixon and New York v. Hill including that
among the rights that required a personal explicit
waiver. But if we're wrong about that --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Were those -- was
the right to a jury trial at issue in those cases?
MS. BLATT: No, it was just a descriptive:
There are decisions of such moment that the defendant
must personally make and this is usually included in the
list. But whatever -- whatever --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When I was
researching it, I saw that it was usually included in
the list, but I thought it would track back to some case
that held that it was, but it never -- never does.
MS. BLATT: Well, whatever is in the list,
it's a very small handful and it is something that the
defendant --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It's our list, after all,
right?
(Laughter.)
MS. BLATT: It's a very short list, and I
just think it's something that a defendant can readily
appreciate, even though it may be a strategic call,
whether or not he is going to plead guilty or even take
the stand. I mean, the right to testify is a decision
that personally belongs to the defendant, but you still
don't need an on-the-record, explicit personal consent
by the defendant personally. If the defense lawyer
says, we have no witnesses, the client's assent is
assumed and that's just the way our criminal justice
system works. The lawyer does speak for the defendant
in all but the very few exceptional cases.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Blatt, if you, if the
Government prevails, what happens to the 11th Circuit's
ruling in the -- what was it, the Maragh --
MS. BLATT: Maragh --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- case where the 11th th
Circuit said, we're not going to mess with any
constitutional question, but under our supervisory
power, we're going to tell the district -- the
magistrate judges, district judges in this circuit; it's
a simple thing to do, put on the record that the
defendant himself consented.
That would be -- that would no longer be
valid, right?
MS. BLATT: I don't think so. I mean, I
think a -- there is nothing to stop them --
JUSTICE SCALIA: You think it would be valid
or don't think it wouldn't be valid?
MS. BLATT: I don't think so. I mean -- and
that's why the Court took the case to resolve that
circuit. And I read the decision as reading this
Court's decision in Peretz to require it. Or at least
there was some constitutional doubt about it but I don't
--
JUSTICE GINSBURG: They specifically said,
we're doing this under our supervisory powers, not under
the Constitution. So my question was could a circuit
still say, we think it's better for the defendant
himself to be told, so in our circuit that's going to be
the rule?
MS. BLATT: I mean, I don't think I have a
fully developed answer on that, but my guess would be
our position is no. But I don't -- I don't think
there's at least anything to stop the particular
magistrate judge in any given case from saying -- from
addressing the defendant or requiring it. But --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, suppose the
question would come up. I mean, if the circuit does
that the question would come up, if the magistrate
doesn't do it and it's not objected to, because of
course if it's objected to you deal with it then.
MS. BLATT: Right. Well, I --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And then we'd have
to decide, or the Court would have to decide whether
that's a basis for reversal.
MS. BLATT: Right. And on that issue our
position is clear: There is a rule that would dictate
how it would be resolved and Rule 52(b) of the Federal
Rule of Criminal Procedures has no exception, and plain
error would apply. And so if there was some sort of
error, the defendant would have to make the necessary
showings for plain error review, and on that I would
like to address, since we are on the subject, that if
the Court disagreed with us on the merits, Rule 52(b)
would apply and we think that all the concerns that
animate a contemporaneous objection rule are at their
peak when the defense counsel expressly agrees to the
course of action followed by the court, and Petitioner's
rule of automatic reversal would open the door to
gamesmanship and sandbagging because it would allow
defense counsel to wait and see if the defendant is
convicted before objecting to the magistrate's role.
And before I get to -- I wanted to turn to,
if you apply plain error, I just wanted to point one
thing out about the Court's decision in Peretz. This
was not something that was just not at issue in the
case. The petitioner extensively argued that the waiver
in that case was ineffective because it did not meet the
requirements of Section 3401(b); there was no personal
explicit waiver; the defendant did not understand what
was happening, he didn't speak English well, and so on;
and the dissenting justices picked up on that and urged
the Court and dissented because there had -- one of the
reasons there was not an explicit and personal waiver by
the defendant. And the Court nonetheless upheld the
magistrate's role in jury selection despite the absence
of that waiver.
JUSTICE ALITO: If Mr. Gonzalez had stood up
at some point during the voir dire 0and said, Your
Honor, I've just learned you're not an Article III
judge, and I want an Article III judge to preside over
the voir dire, what would happen?
MS. BLATT: Well, our position is the
magistrate judge could say sit down. This is if defense
says my counsel is putting in some evidence I don't like
or my counsel is not cross examining the witness or my
counsel just asked a juror a question that I'm really
uncomfortable with. I mean, this show belongs to the
lawyer, and the magistrate judge could tell him to -- to
be quiet.
The defendant has not made a -- and his time
is not up yet -- in effect an assistance of counsel
claim, but if he has an objection and he think his right
rises to the level to testify, that he has some duty --
that the lawyer had some duty of personal consultation,
then he can make that Sixth Amendment argument. We
don't think it would have any merit because this is no
different than the myriad other types of trial rights
that belong to counsel.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you think the
magistrate judge would overstep -- assuming you win and
that is that rule is that the attorney can make the
waiver, would the magistrate judge overstep by saying I
know you've consented to this, but I want you to talk to
your client about it; I want you to explain what the
rules are? Would that be overstepping?
MS. BLATT: No. I think there is some room
for that. I mean I -- some room for that for the court,
but it's -- it's not like it's the right to testify. It
would be hard to, you know, if there was some argument
over objection or how to question prospective jurors.
There's not a hybrid defense team where the -- the judge
is always supposed to turn to the defendant and say are
you sure you're comfortable with what your counsel is
doing?
If the Court does conclude that there is
error, the Petitioner, we don't think has made the
necessary showing for plain error review. The first
problem and the most fundamental is the error is not
plain, because this Court has already upheld the role of
the magistrate judge in jury selection in Peretz,
despite the absence of a personal waiver; and at least
four courts have read that decision to allow a
magistrate judge to conduct voir dire, either when there
is an absence of an objection or there is express
consent by defense counsel.
And even assuming this Court doesn't reach
the question of whether the error had an effect on
substantial rights, the error did not seriously affect
the fairness, integrity or public confidence of criminal
proceedings. The error -- the voir dire in this case
occurred without incident or objection, as Justice
Ginsburg pointed out, to anything that the magistrate
judge did; and there is no indication -- and I don't
think we have heard any -- there is no indication that
the defendant actually disagreed with his counsel's
professional judgment to consent to have the magistrate
judge, or even had an opinion on the subject. And
Petitioner's rule would, as I said, open the door to
gamesmanship because it would relieve counsel of any
obligation to call an error to the court's attention and
therefore give the court the opportunity to correct the
error.
If there are no questions, we would ask that
the Fifth Circuit's decision be affirmed.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Ms. Blatt.
Mr. Newton, you have four minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BRENT E. NEWTON,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. NEWTON: Thank you, Your Honor.
I'd like to return to Section 3401(b), which
the plain language of, and the legislative history
behind, clearly show a congressional intent in the --
context for personal waivers on the record by
defendants. It would be anomalous not to require the
same thing, at least in some similar form, in the felony
context.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Could I just -- a question
that has troubled me. Basically, what you say that is
of such importance here is the composition of a jury. I
mean, that's what it all boils down to, who's going to
rule on the composition of the jury, should it be a
magistrate or should it be an Article III judge. But
if -- you know, if that is -- is so fundamental that it
needs a special rule that the waiver has to be personal
by the defendant, then you can say the same thing about
-- about objections to -- to the Court's failure to
permit a strike for cause. That affects the composition
of the jury.
Now do you need -- do you need the
defendant's consent to the judge's ruling on that point,
or is it enough if the lawyer makes no objection?
MR. NEWTON: It would be enough if the
lawyer made no objection, Your Honor, because that is
the kind of rule that I described earlier that concerns
the heat of the battle of the adversary process, unlike
a discreet point in time before.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I see. I see.
MR. NEWTON: The other point I'm trying to
make is that the -- it's not just the fact that it's a
critical stage; it's a critical stage where there is a
right to an Article III judge over the critical stage.
The Court in Gomez clearly recognized that jury
selection is a critical stage. So it is the Article III
right that implicates the right to a jury trial, but it
is fundamentally the right to an Article III judge that
is at issue.
The Government makes much of its claim that
there could be meaningful Article III de novo review of
magistrate judge rulings. The court unanimously in
Gomez stated that the Court highly doubted it would be
possible to have such review, and it realistically
speaking is not possible because delays between the time
that the district judge can get back to conduct a
review, and in Gomez the Court found -- pointed out that
if you bring jurors back and question them again, you
run the risk of making them hostile -- they think they
did something wrong -- where you don't have that in an
erratic situation where you're delegating an evidentiary
hearing. Witnesses get recalled all the time. They
know that's part of the process.
So, realistically speaking, there is no de
novo review, which is why it's not an adjunct situation
here. It's not the magistrate judge acting as an
adjunct; it's the magistrate judge acting as an Article
III judge.
The Government argues plain error doctrine
should apply, Rule 52(b). Justice Scalia's concurring
opinion in Freytag noted that there are different kinds
of rights that can be waived or forfeited, and most
rights can be forfeited short of a waiver, but there are
certain kinds of rights -- and we contend this is one of
them -- that cannot be forfeited short of a valid
waiver.
The Court in Barker and in Boykin v. Alabama
stated that there are certain personal rights where the
prosecution has the entire responsibility to spread on
the record the valid waiver. And if the prosecution
doesn't meet that burden in the trial court, it's
illogical to apply the burden on the defendant on appeal
when it's the prosecution that would need to assure it
was the defendant's personal waiver that happened in the
trial court.
The Court in Wynn and Glitton and other
cases moreover has said, if it's a fundamental question
of judicial administration, then it can be raised for
the first time on appeal.
I think the Court also should consider the
facts of this case in deciding whether there was
gamesmanship. There wasn't. Clearly there wasn't.
Mr. Gonzalez was cut out of the equation entirely. The
magistrate judge only invited the attorneys to the
bench, left him sitting there without the assistance of
an interpreter. You have to consider his personal
characteristics. He had no experience in the Federal
criminal justice system. He did not speak English
fluently. He was in no position to object. He didn't
have the meaningful opportunity to object. And under
Rule 51(b), there should be de novo for that reason as
well.
I finally I just -- I want to return to my
main point, which is -- I'm not asking the Court to
decide as a matter of constitutional law whether a
personal waiver is required. I think there's a very
strong argument based on the Court's precedent that
should happen and --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can finish your
sentence.
MR. NEWTON: I'm asking the Court to avoid
that question by interpreting the "Additional Duties"
Clause, whether it's a supervisory authority matter or
as a statutory construction matter, to basically model
3401(b). Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
