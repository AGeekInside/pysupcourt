SALMONS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. SALMONS: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and\nmay it please the Court:\nSection 61(a) of the Internal Revenue Code\ndefines gross income to include all income from whatever\nsource derived. As this Court has held, that definition\nis sweeping and represents an intent by Congress to exert\nthe full measure of its taxing power.\nThe court of appeals decisions below, by\nexcluding from respondent's gross income the portion of\nlitigation proceeds paid to their attorneys under\ncontingent fee agreements, is inconsistent with two\nlongstanding Federal tax law principles for defining gross\nincome.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Now, if -- if this didn't\ninvolve the alternative minimum tax, would the amount be\ndeductible?\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, but for the\nalternative minimum tax, there would be an -- a\nmiscellaneous itemized deduction --\nMR. SALMONS: -- under section 212 of the\ncode --\nMR. SALMONS: -- that would be subject to the\nlimit of the 2 percent of adjusted gross income that\napplies to itemized deductions. But section\n56(b)(1)(A) --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's of annual income.\nRight? 2 percent of -- of the person's annual income?\nMR. SALMONS: Of the adjusted gross income.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: For the year.\nMR. SALMONS: For the year. That's correct,\nYour Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But, gee, in the case of a --\nof a major award, that 2 percent is very likely to be\nexceeded, isn't it?\nMR. SALMONS: It -- it certainly may, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So this is a problem that's\ngoing to exist even -- even after the alternate minimum\ntax is abolished. Right?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SALMONS: I'm not sure entirely what you're\nreferring to as the problem, but it is the case that --\nthat --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you don't think -- the\nGovernment doesn't think it's a problem. I'm talking\nabout taking a huge percentage of the -- of the person's\nrecovery. That -- that will happen even -- even in the\ncase where there's no minimum tax -- alternative.\nMR. SALMONS: That is correct. That -- that is\ncorrect, Your Honor. Now, I mean -- and let me make two\npoints about that.\nThe first is that as a -- as a general matter,\nthe tax code defines gross income expansively, and there's\na number of this Court's cases that make that clear. Then\n-- then the question becomes are there deductions provided\nthat allow for certain expenses to be deducted.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Don't some States such as\nOregon require a plaintiff to remit a portion of punitive\ndamages recovered to the State so they don't even go to\nthe taxpayer? But is the taxpayer saddled with that too?\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, I would think the\nanswer to that question is no. It's not a question that I\nhave examined in depth in -- in this case because it's not\npresented, but as a general matter --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, what about attorney's\nfees in class actions? As I understand it, those are not\nregarded by the Government as attributable all to the\ntaxpayer.\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: A plaintiff who's part of a\nclass in a class action suit where attorney's fees are\npaid.\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, we believe that the\nsame principles would apply to class action lawsuits as to\nother lawsuits in terms of the taxation of litigation\nproceeds. It may very well be the case in a number of\nclass action contexts that when applying those principles,\nthe proper -- the proper analysis leads to the conclusion\nthat the taxpayer doesn't exert sufficient control and\nthat the payment of attorney's fees is not in response to\na debt owed by the taxpayer. And so there might be a\ndifferent result.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, I -- I thought we were\n-- our attention was pointed to a number of instances\nwhere the Internal Revenue Service did not require the\ntaxpayer to show all the attorney's fees as income in\nthose class action situations.\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, that is correct.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes.\nMR. SALMONS: I want to be clear. We think the\nsame principles apply across the board to defining gross\nincome. In applying that in a number of class action\ncontexts, the proper answer may be that it's not included\nin gross income because there wasn't sufficient control\nand because it wasn't paid in -- in lieu of a debt owed by\nthe taxpayer. But here --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why -- why isn't there as much\ncontrol in each case? I mean, the -- somebody goes to a\nlawyer with a claim and says, press the claim for me,\nrecover if you can. What's the difference in -- in terms\nof control? So that if you win this case, why doesn't it\napply to class action?\nMR. SALMONS: Again, the principles would apply\nand there may very well be class actions --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, and I -- I want to know\nwhy the result would be different.\nMR. SALMONS: Again, I'm -- I'm trying to be as\nspecific as I can. There may be situations in which, even\nin the class action context, there's a fee agreement\nbetween the -- the class member and the lawyer so that the\npayment of attorney's fees is in satisfaction of a debt\nowed by the class member, and in that situation we think\nthat it would be --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why -- why would -- why would\nthat analysis appear? Certainly there's -- there's not\ngoing to be any fee paid in the -- in the paradigm example\nof the class action without a recovery.\nMR. SALMONS: That's correct, Your Honor. There\n-- there are situations --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So we're in the -- so we're in\nthe situation we're in right now, aren't we?\nMR. SALMONS: We are in the situation in which\nthere's a need to apply the general principles for\ndefining gross income.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All right. But let me just --\nI'll just press the point one more time. I don't\nunderstand, based on what you've said, why the class\naction result would be different from the result that\nyou're arguing for here if you win this case.\nMR. SALMONS: And -- and what I'm trying to\npoint out, Your Honor, is that there may very well be\nclass actions where it's not different. There may be some\nwhen -- where it is if it's the case that there's no\ncontractual obligations to pay the fee -- pay the fee\nbetween the class member and the attorney, and if it's the\ncase that the class member really exerts no meaningful\ncontrol over the -- over the attorney's fees portion --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I thought the class action\ndistinction that the commissioner had was between opt in\nand opt out.\nMR. SALMONS: That is certainly one of the\nfactors that -- that the commissioner has looked to in\nthose class --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So if you opt in, then you did\nexercise control. So all the money is yours. But if you\nopt out, you didn't have control over the suit because you\ndidn't opt out. I mean, you just were lethargic.\nMR. SALMONS: Again, those are all facts --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's the basic thing. I\nmean, I'm trying to understand what the principle is for\nthe reason that it's pretty hard for me to reconcile the\ncommissioner's view in the class action case with the\npunitive damage case because there the person has control\nover the lawsuit. So why doesn't all the punitive damage,\nattorney's fees that come out of that, and so forth belong\nto -- in other words, it sounds to me, as I read this,\nsomething of a mess, and I'd like to know what the clear\nprinciple is.\nMR. SALMONS: Yes, Your Honor. And -- and just\nto be clear, I -- I don't think the commissioner has ever\ntaken the position that all class actions don't present\nthe -- the possibility of the attorney's fees portion of\nthe award being included in -- in the class member's gross\nincome.\nNow, there are real enforcement issues, as a\npractical matter, to trying to -- to trying to implement\nthat. You can imagine a number of class actions --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: When you say the class\nmember, do you -- you mean the named representative. The\nclass may include thousands of people, but it would be\nincome to the named representative? Is that --\nMR. SALMONS: Well, presumably, Your Honor, that\n-- only the portion of the attorney's fees that would be\nattributable to the -- the named representative's recovery\nwould be included in the named representative's gross\nincome. I don't think that the named representative would\nbe on the hook, if you will, for all of the attorney's\nfees that would relate to other class members' recoveries.\nBut I think what all this points out is that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, then -- then would it\nbe -- would the income then go to each class -- would each\nclass member have a share of the income?\nMR. SALMONS: In a number of instances, yes,\nYour Honor. Again, the -- the way that we think that\nclass action cases should be resolved is the same way that\n-- that these issues are approached in all cases, which is\nto look at the type of relationship that exists between\nthe -- the client and the attorney to see whether the\npayment is made in -- in response to a debt owed by the\nclient and also to look to the degree of control that the\nclient has over the -- the underlying source of income.\nAnd in this context, it is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose -- suppose the same\namount were paid, as was paid here, to the attorney, but\nit was not by way of a contingent fee, that the -- the\nclient had committed to pay this dollar amount in a dollar\namount.\nMR. SALMONS: As a flat fee?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: As a flat fee. What -- what\nwould the tax treatment of that be?\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, I think in fact it is\nundisputed in -- in the -- in these cases that if the\npayment of attorney's fees had either been under an hourly\nrate arrangement or a flat fee arrangement, that the\nentire amount of the litigation proceeds would be included\nin the -- in the respondent's gross income and nothing\nabout the contingent fee arrangements here should --\nshould alter that result. The respondents --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, let -- let me ask you\nabout Professor Davenport's theory. He filed a -- an\namicus brief here saying that the contingency fee or the\nattorney's fees should be capitalized as a transaction\ncost increasing the basis of the property which was the\nclaim in the lawsuit.\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, I'm trying to recall\nthat amicus brief. I believe that -- was that an\nargument, I believe, about the application of section 83\nof the tax code when you have a transaction --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes.\nMR. SALMONS: -- in exchange for services and\nyou provide property?\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes.\nMR. SALMONS: We think that the better way to\nanalyze this is that in fact there was no transfer of the\nunderlying cause of action, and so we think that -- that\nwe -- that gets into a very complicated area as to how you\nvalue the attorney's fees at the time.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you -- you don't need a\ntransfer of the -- I don't understand what you mean --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: No, I don't either.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- a transfer of the -- the\ncause of action. Certainly if you buy a piece of real\nestate and -- and there's lawyer's business connected with\nit, you -- you don't -- you don't take an ordinary\ndeduction which is subject to the alternative minimum tax\nfor those lawyer's fees. You just say that's part of the\ntransaction, and it goes onto the basis of your property.\nRight?\nMR. SALMONS: I believe that's correct, Your\nHonor. But the point I was making --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why isn't -- why isn't that\nvery similar to this? I mean, what difference does it\nmake whether there's a -- there's a transaction here,\nisn't there? Isn't there a transaction?\nMR. SALMONS: Well, there is an agreement to pay\na fee for a service, and in that sense there is a\ntransaction, yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but a -- the service is\nconnected to a transaction, namely the conversion of the\nchosen action into a money payment. You have this --\nMR. SALMONS: That -- that is correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- this unformed chosen action.\nYou're entitled to it, but there's a transaction\nconverting it into a money payment. Now, why shouldn't\nyou attribute to that transaction all -- which is\nprofitable to you, all of the costs that go along with the\ntransaction?\nMR. SALMONS: Well, again, Your Honor, we think\nthat transaction is essentially identical to numerous\ntransactions that take place every day out in the real\nworld where -- where taxpayers retain professional\nservices in exchange for a commission or a percentage of\nthe income that's generated.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That is a problem that occurs\nto me. I don't know where you draw the line. And you say\nyou can't draw a line.\nMR. SALMONS: That is absolutely correct. I\ndon't see any basis for distinguishing between --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How does it work?\nMR. SALMONS: -- the attorneys here and -- and a\n-- and an agent negotiating a book contract for an author\nor a financial analyst.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You -- on that, that example,\nyou gave the book contract with the author and you gave, I\nthink, the investor. Would this problem arise in those\ncases or would the author get an above-the-line deduction?\nMR. SALMONS: No, Your Honor. I believe that\nthe author in those -- in that situation would receive the\nsame deduction that prior to the enactment of section 703\nof the American Jobs Creation Act where Congress just\naddressed in part the -- the issue raised in these\ncases --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So you say the author -- that\nthese people are all in the same --\nMR. SALMONS: They would have an itemized --\nexcuse me -- a miscellaneous itemized deduction for the\ncost incurred in -- in producing income that under the\nalternative minimum tax would not be allowed.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is there any argument -- you\n-- you said at the outset that it has to be an itemized\ndeduction subject to the two percent rule even if we set\naside the alternative minimum tax. Is that conceded by\neveryone, or does somebody -- do some people say this is\nan ordinary and necessary expense? I know it's not your\nbusiness, but it seems to me an ordinary and necessary\nexpense to recover the -- the -- for employment\ndiscrimination, which is really part of your work. I\ndon't know why -- is it -- does everybody agree that this\nis subject to the 2 percent rule?\nMR. SALMONS: I will -- I will have to allow\nrespondents to speak for themselves to that question, but\nas far as I'm aware, that is not in dispute in these cases\nor in any of the cases that have been litigated that --\nthat but -- that but for the alternative minimum tax, the\nway this would have been handled is that there would have\nbeen a miscellaneous itemized deduction under section 212\nof the code for the cost incurred in producing income, and\nthat the alternative minimum tax, along with, by the way,\na large number of other perfectly valid deductions, get\ndisallowed under the alternative minimum tax.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I can't get out of my\nmind in this case that the mechanics of the particular\ncase may control. I know we need a national rule and so\nforth. My recollection is that in some States when there\nis a settlement or a judgment paid under a case where\nthere's a contingency fee contract, the check is made out\nboth to the attorney and to the client and is put in the\nattorney's client's trust account. So the client never\nhas control over it.\nMR. SALMONS: Well --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Let's assume that that's true\nin most of the States.\nMR. SALMONS: That -- that -- I know that were\n-- that was the facts, Your Honor, in the -- in the Banks\ncase, that there was a check made out to both. In fact --\nin fact, there was --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So in a very real -- in -- in\na very real sense, in a -- in the legal sense, the client\njust doesn't have control.\nMR. SALMONS: Well, Your Honor, we disagree with\nthat for, it seems to me, at least three reasons. The\nfirst is that at the time the client entered into the fee\nagreement, he certainly had control then. He had complete\ncontrol over his cause of action. He was --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, he -- he did or he\ndidn't, but there was no money there. There was nothing\nthere.\nMR. SALMONS: Well, there was an entitlement to\nrecover. Now, there might have been a dispute as to the\nproper amount or whether that claim was valid, but he was\nentitled to recover based on the injury he suffered that\nwas cognizable at law and that gave raise to a cause of\naction.\nNow, in exchange for legal services, he promised\nto pay a portion of the recovery to the lawyer. That is a\npromise to pay a fee. That is not an assignment or any\nother transfer of the underlying cause of action. And it\nis undisputed, I think --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Salmons, doesn't the\nplausibility of your argument here rest on the assumption\nthat what the -- that the cause of action at the time the\n-- that the plaintiff made the agreement with the lawyer\nis a cause of action which has the same value as the\nultimate recovery that the lawyer gets? Whereas, in fact,\nthe cause of action at the time of the agreement with the\nlawyer has an inchoate value. The -- the value that is\nactually realized is going to depend in part on the -- on\nthe skill and -- and the -- the gumption of the lawyer.\nSo that the -- what I'm getting at -- and -- and\ngoing to Justice Kennedy's question, it seems to me that\nthe value realized as opposed to the right to sue are two\ndifferent figures. And I don't see realistically how the\nclient has complete control over the value realized, which\nwe don't even know until the lawyer has done his work and\ngotten the check.\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, two responses to that\nquestion, if I may. The first is that, as a matter of\nlaw, it is the client that controls the cause of action\nand throughout the time period, even after they -- they\nenter into an -- a contingent fee agreement, it is the\nclient that owns and controls the cause of action and he\ndecides whether to settle. He decides whether to press\nforward or withdraw the case. He decides whether to fire\nthe lawyer or not. He is a -- he controls the source of\nthe income. Therefore --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Even -- even the potential\nlawyer's fee. I mean, suppose this client has a major\ndental repair and he's got a risk-taking dentist, and he\nsays, dentist, I'm going to give you a deal. I know you\nlike to take risks. I may win big in my lawsuit, in which\ncase you get everything; and I may lose, in which case you\nget nothing. The dentist says, fine, I'll take it. Can\nthe client in that agreement with his dentist give what\nwill be the lawyer's fee, the part that will go to the\nlawyer under the contingency fee agreement?\nMR. SALMONS: Well, presumably, Your Honor, if\nhe's already -- he's already promised that to the\nattorney, he would be in violation of his agreement with\nthe attorney if he did so, and his attorney could sue him\nto recover or the dentist could sue him to recover.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then he doesn't have -- then\nhe doesn't have dominion over that portion.\nMR. SALMONS: Well, because he's -- he's given\nit away. In that sense I think -- and -- and in answering\nthis, if I may just go back to one point that Justice\nSouter made and that is that I don't think it's the case\nthat our analysis turns at all on how you value the claim,\neither at the time of the fee agreement or afterwards.\nOur analysis says at all relevant times, regardless of\nwhether the value changed or not, the client was at all\ntimes in control of the underlying source of income, and\nit's just as if in Helvering v. Horst the father assigns\nthe -- the bond coupon to his son, but he controls the\nunderlying source of income.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but the bond coupon has a\ncertain value at the time the father assigns it.\nMR. SALMONS: That's true.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The only thing that has to be\nrealized after the assignment of the coupon is the passage\nof time at which it will be payable. Here we do not have\na definite value. We don't know -- there's no way to know\nfor sure what that value will be until the lawsuit is over\nwith. The -- the two are not comparable.\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, that would be equally\ntrue of an assignment of a stock dividend while I retain\nthe stock. I may not know what the dividend payment is\ngoing to be, but if I control the underlying source of\nincome, i.e., the stock, then the transfer to someone else\nof the dividend doesn't alter the incident of tax, even if\nit's unknown.\nAnd I would point out that in Lucas v. Earl, the\nhusband and wife in that case entered into agreement to\nassign to each other 50 percent of their income in 1901,\nlong before the income tax was even instituted, and the\ntax years at issue in that case were 1920 and 1921. If\nanything, it was much more speculative and uncertain what\nincome would have been earned 20 years later in that case,\nand that did not stop the Court from --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So you're -- you're --\nMR. SALMONS: -- applying this principle that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can I -- can I ask you a\nquestion relating to the Davenport -- what's been referred\nto as the Davenport theory? I had thought that -- that\nthe service has used the -- the transaction theory with\nregard to legal fees payable for a lawsuit seeking\nincreased compensation for the condemnation of real estate\nwhere the taxpayer had objected to the amount that the\ncondemning entity was offering and brought suit in court\nand with a contingent fee to the lawyer and that the\nservice treated that as -- as part of the transaction\ncost. Am I wrong about that?\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, to my knowledge, the\n-- the IRS has had a consistent position that the entire\namount of litigation proceeds, including the amount that\nmay be paid to a lawyer under a contingent fee agreement,\neven in the condemnation context, is tax -- is included in\nthe gross income of -- of the taxpayer.\nAnd I would point Your Honor to the case out of\nthe Federal Circuit, Baylin v. United States. That case\ninvolved a condemnation action, and the court of appeals\nin that case addressed the issue that's presented in these\ncases and concluded that it was includable in gross\nincome.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe my recollection is wrong.\nI'll look again.\nMR. SALMONS: And -- and I would point out, Your\nHonor -- and this has to do, I think, with the impact of\nthe new legislation that's been pointed to in the\nsupplemental briefs -- that at least six of the court of\nappeals cases addressing the issue presented in these\ncases involved claims that would not be covered under the\nnew section 703 because they -- they don't involve claims\nfor unlawful discrimination or -- or FCA claims or certain\nMedicare claims --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But can -- can I ask you to go\nback for a minute? I guess the IRS -- you're seeing the\nlawsuit as the income-generating asset.\nMR. SALMONS: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And you're looking at the\ncontrol of the plaintiff, for example, over the lawsuit as\nsomething that determines whether it's his income. And\nhe, of course, can't give away his income. But on that\ntheory, to go back to Justice O'Connor's original\nquestion, then the punitive damages also must be his\nincome because he has equal control over them and they\ngrow out of the income-producing asset. And that, of\ncourse, is what's bothering me because it seems to me that\nyour theory, which is a well-established theory, coupled\nwith a Congress that seems to be willing to take away\ndeductions for expenses that lead to the income, could\nproduce an income tax that in many cases, not just a few,\nexceeds the income that an individual has. And I would\nlike to know what in the law is there to guard against\nthat result.\nMR. SALMONS: Well, Your Honor, I guess my\nresponse to that is that, first --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Other -- other than the mercy\nof the Internal Revenue Service.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, the fact of the matter\nis, is that Congress has looked at -- at this issue, and\nin the new section that I just referred to, section 703 --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, but does that happen?\nYou haven't answered the question. Are there instances\nwhere plaintiffs in lawsuits end up receiving tax bills,\nas a result of this scheme, for more money than they\nreceived in the lawsuit?\nMR. SALMONS: That has occurred, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes.\nMR. SALMONS: And -- and Congress responded to\nconcerns about that very result --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but doesn't -- doesn't\nthat indicate --\nMR. SALMONS: -- in the new section.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- something basically flawed\nabout your whole theory?\nMR. SALMONS: No, Your Honor. It is --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: This is not income in any --\nin any real sense.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is there any constitutional\nprotection? The Sixteenth Amendment refers to an income\ntax, and perhaps that doesn't include a tax that grossly\nexceeds in many cases a person's income. That would be\nquite a far-out theory at the moment.\nMR. SALMONS: I think it would be, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But I -- that's why I ask you.\nIs there any protection in the law whatsoever? Or if\nCongress decides to tax a set of people who, let's see --\nsay, earn $10,000 a year and because they're small\nbusiness people, they happen to have $20,000 expenses. So\nit taxes them on $20,000, and the tax exceeds the income.\nThere's no protection in your view against that result.\nAnd you just said, well, Congress decided to do it, it\ndecided to do it.\nMR. SALMONS: But we do think, Your Honor, that\nthe only limit on Congress' taxing authority would be the\nConstitution, and I don't see a constitutional violation\nin disallowing a deduction, but --\nJUSTICE BREYER: What about an assumption, for\nexample, that when we read the code, we read it with a\nview towards thinking Congress did not want to produce\nsuch unfair results?\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, if I may. The way I\nwould respond to that concern is that the proper way to\naddress it is not as the courts below did and as\nrespondents urge, to alter or distort the general\ndefinition for gross income under the -- under the tax\ncode which may have broad ramifications in a number of\nareas outside of this one, but to go to Congress, as in\nfact people have done, and to get them to make -- make\nadditional deductions or otherwise alter the alternative\nminimum tax, which generates the primary concern I think\nat issue in these cases.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What happened in the cases --\nMR. SALMONS: That's the proper way to handle\nthat.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There were cases -- we don't\nhave to deal in hypotheticals. There were cases where\nthis happened, where people ended up liable for a tax\ngreater than what they took in. What happened in those\ncases?\nMR. SALMONS: They were -- they were liable for\na tax greater than what they took in. Those were pointed\nto Congress --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I mean, there was one that\nwas $99,000, if I remember right.\nMR. SALMONS: I believe that's correct. Those\nwere pointed out to Congress and that was part of what\nmotivated Congress --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Was there a private bill?\nMR. SALMONS: -- to enact section 703 to\nprotect --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Or what happened? What\nactually happened in that case, do you know?\nMR. SALMONS: I do not know, Your Honor. My --\nmy understanding is that the tax was assessed and I don't\nknow whether --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Salmons, I -- I -- you've\ncited the -- the Baylin case to me and I -- I've looked at\nthe description of it in the brief, which I had recalled,\nand what it says is that it did, indeed, involve a taking\nby the State, and when the State didn't offer what Baylin\nthought was -- was enough, he went to court, he prevailed,\nand recovered a much larger sum than the State had offered\nhim. His legal fees were, by the IRS, subtracted from the\naward, and he was taxed only upon the proceeds reduced by\nthe legal fees. Now, how do you explain that situation\nthere?\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, if I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And how does that --\nMR. SALMONS: -- misremembered that case, I\napologize. My -- my recollection was that -- was that the\ncourt in that case had included the attorney's fees in\ngross income. But -- but --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I doubt -- I doubt whether\nProfessor Davenport has misdescribed the case in -- in his\nbrief, but I --\nMR. SALMONS: But -- but again, Your Honor, if I\nmay. I think the -- the basic point to recall here is\nthat the definition of gross income cuts across the tax\ncode. If there are concerns about application, then the\nproper result is to go to Congress, as has been done.\nCongress has addressed the very concerns cited by\nrespondents and the amici in this case, and that\nspecifically is the -- the application on civil rights\nplaintiffs.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Does the Fifth Amendment\nTakings Clause apply to a Government tax scheme that taxes\nsomething beyond the income received?\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, it -- there may be --\nthere may be a takings issue at some point. Again, there\nmay be constitutional limitations.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, at the point where the\nGovernment charges more than the taxpayer received --\nMR. SALMONS: But I think, Your --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- in income?\nMR. SALMONS: Your Honor, I think when -- when\nwhat you're talking about is how to define --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: I mean, this is an appalling\nsituation.\nMR. SALMONS: Again, Your Honor, I -- I think as\na general matter, the -- the proper definition of gross\nincome would include the attorney's fees portion of\nlitigation awards. It's important to note that the when\nCongress --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What -- what do you we make of\nthe fact that two Senators apparently don't agree with\nthat position? I mean, I -- I'm referring to the colloquy\nthat was quoted in -- in one of the -- the briefs about\nthe recent legislation, and the -- the substance of the\ncolloquy was we're not making any change in the law, we're\njust clarifying it. Well, in fact, if there is no textual\ndifference for tax purposes between the law, so far as it\nconcerns these -- these so-called discrimination\nrecoveries and non-discrimination recoveries that have the\nsame problem that Justice O'Connor is talking about,\nshouldn't we infer that at least the Senate of the United\nStates assumes that this does not get into gross?\nMR. SALMONS: No, Your Honor. In fact, what I\nwould say is that the thing to focus on is what Congress\nactually enacted and it makes clear that all the\nlitigation proceeds --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I'm -- I'm talking about the\ncolloquy. I'm talking about the colloquy.\nMR. SALMONS: I -- I understand that, Your\nHonor, and what I'm trying to answer is that the -- the\nlegislation itself makes clear that it's included in gross\nincome and an above-the-line deduction is provided, and\nthat the colloquy was referring to a prior version of the\nbill that would have been retroactive in part. The new\nbill is not retroactive, and we think it's clear that it\ndoes work a change because from, among other reasons, it's\nundisputed that if these fees had been paid on an hourly\nfee basis, they would have been included in gross income\nand -- and the alternative minimum tax would apply.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We don't really know who\nprepared that colloquy anyway, do we?\nMR. SALMONS: We do not.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It might have been prepared by\nthe respondents here.\nMR. SALMONS: We do not.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SALMONS: If I may reserve the remainder of\nmy time.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Jones.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILIP N. JONES\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT BANAITIS\nMR. JONES: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may\nit please the Court:\nMy client and I are asking the Court to rule\nthat the assignment of income doctrine does not apply when\nunrelated persons combine their resources to jointly\ngenerate income. And we --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- so what -- what about\nthe talent scout who tells the celebrity that he'll take\n10 percent of the celebrity's movie proceeds or the\nmanagement search person that's going to take a -- a third\nof the executive's pay for the first 6 months? Where --\nare all -- all these cases ones in which there -- there's\nno income to the -- to the principal, we'll call them?\nMR. JONES: You mentioned the -- the management\nagent and the -- I think you mentioned the talent agent,\nand there was also mentioned the literary agent. The --\nthe author is in the trade or business and gets to deduct\nall this off the top. There's no problem there.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's the -- that's the\nquestion I asked Mr. Salmons --\nMR. JONES: Yes. The literary agent --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- and he gave me the\nopposite answer.\nMR. JONES: Yes. The literary agent is in a\ntrade or business. That's off the top. That's an\nordinary and necessary business deduction on Schedule C.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And that isn't the question.\nMR. JONES: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The -- the problem is you're --\nyou're trying to get a theory in response to him that I\nthink Justice Kennedy is asking about.\nMR. JONES: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And that theory, which is the\nproblem for your side of the case -- that theory has all\nkinds of implications. I go out and I help the painter\npaint my office. We have a joint venture. I -- so\nthere's no problem. I don't take it in -- you know, I get\na -- this is great. And so that I think, if I'm right,\nwas the thrust of Justice Kennedy's question.\nMR. JONES: Our first choice, our preference for\nthis Court to rule is -- is not the partnership or joint\nventure theory. Our first choice is for this Court to\nsimply look at the application of the assignment of income\ndoctrine and ask it -- if it is being misapplied. The --\nthe petitioner has not cited to the Court a single,\nsolitary case in which unrelated persons combine their\nresources to jointly produce income, and that is the rule\nof law I'm suggesting to the Court today. That is apart\nand separate from the partnership theory, that two\nunrelated persons who join together to produce income --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's a partnership theory when\nyou talk about two persons joining together. I don't like\nthis -- this gold mine view of litigation, that it's, you\nknow, like two prospectors. You know, there's money to be\nobtained.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. JONES: I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's -- that's not what I\nview of a chosen action as. I view it as a legal right --\nMR. JONES: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that the person is entitled\nto money, and ultimately the amount he's entitled to is\ndetermined by the litigation. And I'm not about to adopt\na -- a legal theory that -- that views this as a -- as a\nsearch for buried treasure --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- in -- in which the -- the\nlawyer and the person who has been wronged are -- are\nsimply co-prospectors. I -- I just think that that's --\nMR. JONES: Well, the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe that's how you view the\n-- the enterprise --\nMR. JONES: I would like to --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- but I don't think the law\ndoes.\nMR. JONES: I would like to suggest to the Court\nthree avenues to reach this result that I have just\nsuggested and the partnership/joint venture theory is only\none of those.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, let's move on to\nsomething else because I have a couple --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. JONES: Okay. I will move on to that, and I\nwill not mention that again.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. JONES: This Court created the assignment of\nincome doctrine. Congress did not create it. This Court\nhas every right and power to limit its -- its definition,\nto limit its scope to keep it from being misapplied. In\nevery case cited by the petitioner, we have a -- a family\nsituation, related people making gifts to each other with\nno commercial purpose. Apart from the partnership and\njoint venture theory, if we simply say that this case is\ndramatically outside of the scope of that doctrine, of\ngood doctrine that has been applied properly in an inter-\nfamily situation, but when you have two unrelated persons\njoining forces to produce income --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Would you have a different\nresult if they were related? Supposing the lawyer is a\ncousin of the client.\nMR. JONES: This Court has a long history of\nrecognizing --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Or a good friend.\nMR. JONES: -- of recognizing sham transactions.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it's not a sham\ntransaction. You just happen to be related.\nMR. JONES: All right.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And I'm just wondering if\nthat --\nMR. JONES: I would like to focus on the\ngratuitous nature of the cases relied upon by the\npetitioner and the non-gratuitous aspects of our case.\nLet's talk about a personal injury case where this problem\ndoes not arise because there's no tax involved. This\nrelationship of a contingent fee is entered into thousands\nof times every week by people injured in automobile\naccidents. They are not entering into this contingent fee\nagreement for tax purposes. They're not trying to avoid\ntax -- taxes. The commissioner is confusing intent\nwith --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All right. On -- on that\ntheory, that there is a non-tax economic purpose, do you\nstill maintain that your theory should have as an element\nunrelated people?\nMR. JONES: I --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why do we need the question of\nthe relationship, which Justice Stevens's questions\nraised, even to arise if -- if the principal criterion is\ngoing to be economic non-tax purpose?\nMR. JONES: I agree completely. I was trying to\nemphasize the -- the intrafamily gratuitous nature of\nthose cases, but I agree --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There was no avoidance motive\nin the --\nMR. JONES: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- granddaddy of all cases.\nThe assignment there, although it was between family\nmembers, had been made before there was an income tax.\nMR. JONES: But we must --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The income tax didn't exist.\nThere -- there couldn't conceivably have been an avoidance\nmotive. So -- so our holding could hardly be based upon\n-- upon the existence of an avoidance motive.\nMR. JONES: I'm asking the Court to skip over\nmotive and look at result. The Court in that case was\nattacking a result because that arrangement stayed in\nplace after the income tax was -- was enacted. The\nSolicitor General is confusing intent with result. In\nevery case, in every single case, without exception, this\ndoctrine has been applied to the result.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but what if you had the\nsame result but -- in terms of the sharing of the expense\nand the recovery, but it was computed on an hourly basis\nrather than a percentage basis? Would that produce a\ndifferent result?\nMR. JONES: It would produce a different result.\nThe commissioner's case is based on could have's. They say\nthey could have tried the case himself. He couldn't. But\n-- but the main thing he --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, but he could have made --\nI'm saying he could have said to the lawyer, I'll pay you\n30 -- a -- a third of the recovery or I'll pay you $100 an\nhour.\nMR. JONES: Well, he --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And they come out exactly the\nsame result, but you -- but do you treat them differently\nor the same?\nMR. JONES: We treat them differently simply\nbecause he didn't. I practice law in a partnership. I'm\ntaxed accordingly. I could -- I could be -- set up my\narrangement different ways and the tax results would be\ndifferent. We must honor these relationships --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What is different?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, may I ask one --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What is different?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask one other\nhypothetical? Supposing that the agreement on the\ncontingency is postponed until the middle of the\npreparation, not made at the outset, but along the line,\nthey say we'll figure out what a fair percentage will be,\nand when the recovery comes in, they then decide, okay,\nyou take a third. What -- what result do you do in that\ncase?\nMR. JONES: I -- I have difficulty with that\nquestion.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But I'm sure it arises fairly\noften.\nMR. JONES: My -- I believe that attorneys don't\nallow themselves to be placed in that position. They get\nthe contingent fee agreement signed when the -- the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, I did very often.\nMR. JONES: But I don't know the answer to your\nquestion. I -- I don't know that.\nBut an -- we -- the Internal Revenue Code\nrespects people who enter into corporations, who enter\ninto joint ventures, who enter into sole proprietorships,\nwho hire employees or allow themselves to be hired by\nothers. Those relationships are all respected and honored\nby the Internal Revenue Code, and the commissioner is\nasking you to dishonor this relationship because Mr.\nBanaitis could have handled the case himself or could --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I think probably what's --\nwhat's one of the problems here is that the reason this is\nincome is it relates to employment. And I don't see why\nhiring the attorney to get that income is not an ordinary\nand necessary business expense under what used to be\nsection 162. That may be part of the problem. Do you\nagree that it's not an ordinary and necessary business\nexpense?\nMR. JONES: I believe the problem is that a\nplaintiff has -- I wish I could say this plaintiff is in\n-- engaged in a trade or business and can deduct it or\ntrade or -- as a trade or business expense.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, I suppose that's the\nreason -- that's the reason why it's taxable to begin\nwith, is it relates to employment. If I hire an attorney\nbecause I'm wrongfully discharged and I get -- I get my\njob back, it seems to me that's an ordinary and necessary\nbusiness expense. That -- that's why -- one of the\nreasons I have problems with this.\nMR. JONES: I understand. But one of the -- the\nodd result here of a person having to pay more in taxes\nthan they recover -- this actually comes up under a fee\nshifting statute that applies to the Internal Revenue\nService where a person could be in litigation with the\nInternal Revenue Service, the Internal Revenue Service\nbecomes obligated to pay fees because they acted\nunreasonably. They pay those fees, and then they\nsimultaneously hand the taxpayer a bill for taxes on those\nfees.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, let me get -- get to a\ndifferent point. It -- it does seem to me that we -- we\nhave to be very careful in this case not to distort the\nrevenue law for other transactions that are not before the\nCourt. And the -- the natural extension of your\nposition is that anytime when the taxpayer enters into an\nagreement with an agent to pay the agents an amount\ncontingent on the success of the venture, that it's not\nincome, that -- that the -- that the payment is not income\nto the principal. And I just can't accept it.\nMR. JONES: No. That is not my position. My\nposition is that the assignment of income doctrine does\nnot apply. Those relationships are all governed by\nexisting law and there is a large body of law dealing with\nthose cases and they can be found in a cite that is\noffered by the petitioner at page 3 of his reply brief.\nIt talks about the literary agents. It talks about the --\nthe management agents.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But what's the difference in\nprinciple. I don't understand the difference in principle\nwhen we're talking about who has the income. It's the\nfirst thing you ask in -- in a first-year -- in -- in your\n-- in your first class in tax. Where is the income? Who\ngets the income?\nMR. JONES: I -- I am not trying to avoid your\nquestion, but I'm trying to clarify that I am not asking\nthis Court to determine who has the income in those cases\nbecause there is a large body of law and a large body of\nstatutory law that answers the questions for each of those\nexamples. All I'm suggesting is that we do not get to\nthose answers. We should not get to those answers through\nthe assignment of income doctrine.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What's your third? I just\ndon't want you to miss your third. You have the joint\nventure theory, an exception to an assignment in income,\nand you said you had a third.\nMR. JONES: The Oregon question, Your Honor,\nwhich I don't think the Court is likely interested in --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The who?\nMR. JONES: The -- the Oregon question.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The Oregon question.\nMR. JONES: The Oregon question. That is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What is the Oregon question?\nMR. JONES: The Oregon question is part IV of\nour brief beginning on page 31 which would not be a\nnational uniform rule. But what we're asking this Court\nto do is simply, as narrowly as possible, to limit the\nassignment of income doctrine and do nothing more than\nthat.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, what do you make of\nProfessor Davenport's proposal to capitalize the\ncontingency fee as a transaction?\nMR. JONES: I believe Professor Davenport is\ncompletely correct. I support his theory wholeheartedly.\nWe didn't make that argument because we believe the\nlimitation on the assignment of income doctrine is the\nreal issue and we believe that is the narrower issue.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, if you took a settlement\n-- his theory, I take it, was seeing the lawsuit as a\ncapital asset. Is that right?\nMR. JONES: Yes. Well, I -- I think so.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, then whenever you settled\na lawsuit, it would be -- you'd have to pay capital gains\ninstead of ordinary income.\nMR. JONES: I -- I'm sorry. I think I misspoke.\nI'm not sure that's his theory. I'm not certain, and\nI'm --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm sure it's not his theory.\nHe -- he thinks it's -- it's attached to transactions, and\n-- and much of his argument is devoted to showing that\ncapital transactions are no different from other\ntransactions as far as the Internal Revenue Code's desire\nto match the -- the gain with the expenses concerned. And\nthat's the part of his theory that I'm not so sure about\nbecause aside from the -- aside from the condemnation case\nthat I mentioned, I -- I don't know of any other cases in\nwhich the Internal Revenue Service has treated transaction\ncosts the way he would have it done. Maybe it makes\nsense, but I --\nMR. JONES: I would like to make one additional\npoint in the few seconds I have left. The -- the\nSolicitor General is arguing that the language, the\nstatutory language, of the new statute implies a\nparticular result. This Court decided as early as 1940 in\nthe Higgins v. Smith case when the commissioner made the\nexact same argument, and this Court said -- and I quote --\nthat does not follow. The statutory language says that to\nthe extent this income is -- this -- this money is\nincluded in income, to the extent it is included in income\n-- it doesn't say whether it is or not -- then a deduction\nwill be allowed. And that as neutral a statement as I can\nthink of. There is nothing in the statutory language that\nimplies one answer or the other.\nBut I emphasize to the Court that the -- the\ncommissioner is confusing intent with result when he\ndiscusses the cases upon which he is relying. Those cases\nreached a result and they corrected that result. We don't\nhave an abuse in this situation. And the assignment of\nincome doctrine should not be stretched beyond its bounds\nby this Court. It should be limited to its historical\nuse. This is a misuse.\nThank you very much.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Jones.\nMr. Carty.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES R. CARTY\nON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT BANKS\nMR. CARTY: Thank you, Justice Stevens.\nNeither section 61(a) nor any other provision of\nthe Internal Revenue Code expressly requires that a\nFederal civil rights litigant, such as Mr. Banks, include\nin his gross income the portion of a litigation recovery\nthat was earned by, retained by, and already taxed to his\nattorney as a contingent fee.\nThe commissioner's position in this case relies\nexclusively on the misapplication of a judicial doctrine\nknown as the assignment of income doctrine. That doctrine\noriginated and developed as a judicial anti-abuse rule,\ndesigned to prevent high-bracket taxpayers --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, it didn't.\nMR. CARTY: I respectfully --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It -- it originated in a case\nwhere there could not possibly have been an intent -- an\nintent to abuse because the -- the transfer had occurred\nbefore there was any income tax.\nMR. CARTY: Justice --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, just -- just don't --\nmaybe you think that that's what it ought to be, but --\nbut please don't tell us that that is how it originated.\nIt plainly did not originate that way.\nMR. CARTY: Justice Scalia, I respectfully\ndisagree. It is true, as the commissioner and you point\nout, that at the time of the agreement between the husband\nand wife, the income tax was not in existence. However,\nthe agreement certainly was in existence after the income\ntax was passed. So that could have been a reason why the\nagreement was never rescinded.\nIn addition, in another landmark case from 1937,\nBlair, this Court expressly looked to whether there was a\ntax avoidance motive. And this is how this principle is\ntaught in first-year tax class. That's the whole purpose\nbehind this. As a matter of fact, the commissioner in a\n-- in a different context actually looked to the fact,\nwith respect to a particular transaction, whether there\nwas a tax avoidance purpose.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's a different argument.\nI'm -- I'm just quarreling over whether it originated that\nway. If you want to say --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Under -- under your view --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- that's fine.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- suppose that the attorney\nis -- is waiting for payment of -- of his, say, one-third\ncontingent fee, and the client just absconds with the money.\nHow is -- what -- what happens from a tax standpoint under\nyour theory? I take it the attorney has to declare the\nincome on his return and then declare a loss?\nMR. CARTY: Well, certainly the attorney has a\nlegal right to those funds. He has a contractual right\nand under most --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm asking you about the tax\nconsequences.\nMR. CARTY: Well, at -- at that point the income\nwouldn't have inured to the benefit of the attorney.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but I -- I thought under\nyour view the moment the client gets the check for the\nfull amount, one-third of it is taxable to the attorney.\nAnd I have some problems, incidentally, with\nrespect to tax years if it -- if you -- if the client\nreceives the check December 30 and is on vacation and\ndoesn't get around to remitting to the attorney until\nJanuary 5th, I'm -- I'm not quite sure how your theory\nworks, but --\nMR. CARTY: Justice Kennedy, I -- I think the --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But on the absconding theory,\nhow -- how is it handled from a tax standpoint?\nMR. CARTY: I believe that for tax purposes the\nattorney's right to the funds -- that's at the moment he\nreceives it. So if he doesn't have the funds in hand, he\nwouldn't be liable for Federal tax. It would be at the\npoint he either receives the funds --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Aren't -- aren't you --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: This is an academic question\nbecause he would have an offsetting theft loss.\nMR. CARTY: I -- I think that is an alternative\nway to -- to view it. There would be a --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If -- if you view it as the\ntheft loss, you -- you maintain your theory. If you\nargue, as you were arguing a second ago, I think what, in\nfact, you're doing is adopting the mere lien theory.\nMR. CARTY: Justice Souter, I -- I --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I think you better go with\nJustice Ginsburg.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: Like somebody stealing a check\nout of my mailbox from my employer. Right? Okay.\nMR. CARTY: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So what is your theory, I mean,\nprecisely? A, an assignment of income, what would\notherwise count of A giving an assignment of income to B,\nand therefore still be A's income because the asset\nremains with A, the work, or whatever. Now, your theory\nis but not in the case that. Now fill in the blank for\nme.\nMR. CARTY: Justice --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Precisely, please.\nMR. CARTY: It would not be in the case that the\nfunds are not under the control of the attorney.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Not in the case -- it is an\nassignment of income to B, but not in the case where the\nfunds are not in -- when B -- when B get -- when B, the\nattorney, gets the funds, he controls them. What's --\nwhat do you mean? I don't get it.\nMR. CARTY: I thought your hypothetical --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I want to know. You have three\n-- your problem on your side for me is that maybe all the\nequities are there, but I'd like to know the proposition\nof law that you want us to write in this opinion. And now\nwe had three theories, and one, the one that you seem to\nbe adopting, is this exception to the assignment of income\ndoctrine. If that is what you're adopting, I'd like to\nknow the precise form of words that create the exception.\nIf that's not the theory you're adopting, I would like to\nknow what the theory you're adopting is.\nMR. CARTY: I would state, Your Honor, that the\nassignment of income doctrine simply does not apply when\nthe -- the client has no control or power of disposition\nover the income that was subject to the assignment. There\nare at least five reasons why this type of contract --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But he did have control. He\ncould have settled the lawsuit or not settled the lawsuit.\nHe controlled when the income was generated, and moreover,\nhe could have stopped it from being generated by settling the\nsuit or dismissing it. Moreover, if he had not entered\ninto this assignment of income, it would have been paid\nright into his bank account at the end. It sounds an\nawful lot like the Lucases or like the Horsts or whoever,\nOld Colony Trust. It sounds an awful lot like those\ncases.\nMR. CARTY: Justice Breyer, I -- I think it's\nhelpful to make a conceptual distinction between the\nclaim, the underlying litigation claim, and the right to\nreceive the funds. Now, certainly Mr. Banks in this case\nhad a right to enter into settlement or not. He had a\nright to fire his attorney. But once he assigned the\ncontingent fee portion of the recovery, he, as a practical\nmatter, had no ability, he had no control over that\nportion of the recovery.\nAnother fundamental difference between --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That -- that would be the same\nwith the theater agent or the commission agent.\nMR. CARTY: We submit, Justice Kennedy, that the\nnature of the attorney-client relationship is\nfundamentally different from the types of relationships\nyou cited, and that's because an attorney here is the one\nwho's earning the income. It's the attorney who is making\nthe critical decisions.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you could say the same\nthing for the talent scout.\nMR. CARTY: I would respectfully disagree. I --\nI think there's a -- there's a fundamental difference.\nPresumably a -- a actor or an entertainer -- their --\ntheir market value is -- already has some type of tangible\nvalue. The -- the agent might --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Your client, in effect, earned\nthe money by having this -- undergo this -- this\ndiscrimination. That -- that's --\nMR. CARTY: Well, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: This is not the plumber\nhypothetical, which is I think quite misleading. No. No,\nI don't think that even the Government will defend that.\nMR. CARTY: Again, Your Honor, I think with\nrespect to an entertainer, an entertainer necessarily\ndoesn't need an agent. Neither does an athlete.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Take an investment advisor\nand the client is not at all -- doesn't know anything\nabout the market, and he's got this whiz-bang advisor who\nmakes millions for him that he never could have made on\nhis own.\nMR. CARTY: I -- I think that might be more\nsimilar to the attorney-client relationship. But Mr.\nBanks, unlike the athlete or unlike the entertainer, had\nno -- no ability to -- to recover these funds himself. He\nessentially had two options. He could have either done\nnothing and collected nothing --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Your -- your -- you want to\nfill in the blank, in other words, and say where the\nassignment of income is such, such that B was in effect\nthe person who really earned the income, unlike Mrs.\nLucas' -- what Mr. Lucas' or maybe Mr. Earl -- I don't\nknow --\nMR. CARTY: That's correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- husband -- the wife didn't\nearn the income.\nMR. CARTY: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The husband did. So you want\nto say where the -- and then your answer, I guess -- don't\nsay I'm right if I'm not right, please, because I'll just\nfind out later.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: The -- the answer to the\nhypothetical about the agent and so forth is, well, so be\nit. If a person wants to go to the trouble of carving out\nsome of his income and assigning that over to the agent,\nlet him. Except for perhaps provisions of the code which\nwe cannot now envisage -- I can't because I'm not an\nexpert -- it doesn't matter since, after all, it would be\ndeductible anyway. Is that -- is that what you're saying?\nMR. CARTY: Well, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Tell me if I'm wrong, please,\non this.\nMR. CARTY: Again, I -- what we're saying is the\nunique situation of an attorney and a client, it is the\nattorney who's taking the laboring, or unlike the\nentertainer example where the -- where -- or the athlete\nexample --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay, I see. You say double.\nBoth the income is earned by the attorney, and at that\nstage the client does virtually nothing. So it's the\nreverse of the Earls or the Lucases where the husband was\ndoing the work and the wife is getting the income. It\nwould be as if the wife was doing all the work and the\nhusband just sat there and clipped coupons or whatever.\nMR. CARTY: That's correct, Your Honor, and in\nLucas v. Earl, it was the assignor who earned the income\nthat was subject to disposition. Here --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm not so sure about that\nbecause why doesn't the theory that -- that applies to the\nlawyer equally apply to the wife? I mean, she took care\nof everything going on at home, and that enabled him to go\nout there and make all that money. So without her\nservices, just like without the lawyer's services --\nMR. CARTY: That is an excellent point, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You should agree with that.\nYou should --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: Those were less enlightened\ntimes.\nMR. CARTY: Nevertheless -- nevertheless, I -- I\nthink there may be some -- some difference in degree that\nyou might even recognize between the two cases.\nAnother issue I'd like to address is the impact\nof the fee shifting statutes, if I could get to that\nquickly. It is a bedrock principle of taxation that\nsettlements of a claim are taxed the same as a judgment\nwould have been taxed. Mr. Banks' settlement was achieved\nin lieu of his claims under title VII and 42 U.S.C.,\nsections 1981 and 1983.\nNow, each of these statutes contains a fee\nshifting provision which enables a court to award\nattorney's fees to a prevailing plaintiff. The defendant\nin Mr. Banks' case, the California Department of Education\n-- they therefore settled Mr. Banks' claim in lieu of\ntheir exposure under these fee shifting statutes.\nAn award pursuant to these fee shifting statutes\nis separate and distinct from a damages recovery and\ntherefore should not be taxable to a plaintiff. And the\nFederal tax consequences to Mr. Banks, the litigant who\nsettles, shouldn't be any different as well. Otherwise,\nthis Court would be discouraging settlement. Therefore, a\njudicial anti-abuse rule should not be misused to\nundermine the statutory scheme devised by Congress to\nencourage civil rights litigants to bring meritorious\nclaims and vindicate national policy.\nUnless the Court has any further questions?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The Government says on that\nbranch of it, well, the fees -- the lodestar fee, that's\none thing. A court awards it, but that's quite different\nfrom the one-third/one-half even contingent fee. The\ncourt has control over the fee shifting, but we're not\ndealing with any court award here.\nMR. CARTY: That's correct, Justice Ginsburg.\nMr. Banks settled his claims. Yet, we are pressing the\npoint that Mr. Banks shouldn't be treated any differently\nfor tax purposes than a litigant who recovers pursuant to\na fee shifting statute. Otherwise, the Court would be\ndiscouraging settlement.\nIf there's any other questions.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Carty.\nMR. CARTY: Thank you.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Salmons, you have a little\nover 2 minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID B. SALMONS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. SALMONS: Thank you, Your Honor.\nIt is clear that the only thing that\nrespondents' attorneys earned under the fee agreements was\nthe right to be paid a fee for their services. In\npetitioner's view, those agreements don't even give rise\nto an assignment of income in the ordinary sense. If you\nlook at the text of the fee agreement in the Banaitis case\n-- the Banks' fee agreement is not in the record -- among\nother things, it makes clear that if there is a\ntermination -- and it provides lots of grounds on which\nthe attorney-client relationship can be terminated -- that\nthe attorney will be paid a reasonable fee, calculated at\nthe sum of $175 per hour. That doesn't sound like an\nassignment of any income or even an assignment of the\nunderlying cause of action. Even if it did, it is clear\nthat in every assignment of income case, the assignor\nloses control over that income that he assigned. That\ndoesn't stop the application of the proper tax principles,\nhowever.\nThe -- the respondents in these cases suffered a\nlegally cognizable injury. They had a claim. That claim\nentitled them to a recovery. They retained services to\npursued that claim. If they had paid their lawyers on an\nhourly basis, those lawyers may have been just as\nnecessary to the actual outcome of the case as their\ncontingent fee attorneys. Both the -- an hourly fee\nattorney and a contingent fee attorney in both of the\nStates at issue here -- and in fact, in all States of\nwhich I'm aware -- received precisely the same attorney's\nlien. That lien makes clear that the relationship between\nattorney and client starts out as that between a master\nand an agent and then is converted through the fee\nagreement to that between a creditor and a debtor, and the\nlien secures the debt and ensures its payment. When the\nproceeds from the litigation are paid to the attorney, it\nsatisfies the respondent's debt and is therefore income to\nthe attorney. Under the separate and alternative ground\nof this Court's Old Colony decision, it goes far and\nbeyond even the holding with regard to an assignment of\nincome.\nTo address just a couple of questions that came\nup, I would point out that in the class action context,\nagain, as I indicated, there are a number of differences.\nAnd just to be a little more specific about some of them,\ngenerally speaking there's no unilateral right to settle a\n-- a case by class members. There's no unilateral right\nto dismiss the case, and there's no right to a determined\nfee.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Salmons.\nMR. SALMONS: Thank you.\n"
