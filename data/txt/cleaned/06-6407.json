        "content": "(1:00 p.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in case 06-6407, Panetti versus Quarterman.\nMr. Wiercioch.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY W. WIERCIOCH\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. WIERCIOCH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nThe Fifth Circuit found that Scott Panetti\nsuffers from paranoid delusions that cause him to\nbelieve that he is being executed because of a\nconspiracy against him and not as punishment for his\ncrimes. Despite that finding, the Fifth Circuit held\nthat Scott Panetti is competent to be executed because\nan inmate need not have a rational understanding of the\nreason for his execution but only be aware of it. This\nstandard is a profound misreading of Ford versus\nWainwright but before I address the merits of that\nissue, I would like to discuss two preliminary matters\nfirst.\nFirst, Scott Panetti's petition containing\nhis execution competency claim is not second or\nsuccessive under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death\nPenalty Act. And second, the State court adjudication\nof that claim resulted in a decision that was an\nunreasonable application of clearly established Federal\nlaw as determined by this Court.\nThe first issue: This is not a second or\nsuccessive petition.\nMartinez-Villareal recognized that a\nnumerically second petition is not successive, it's not\na mere mathematical computation, it's a term of art.\nAnd if you bring the claim the first time it's\njusticiable, it's not second or successive. Texas law\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wait. I didn't understand\nthat to be what the case said. I thought that the case\nheld that it wasn't successive there because the claim\nhad, in fact, been brought in the first petition, and\nthat first petition was dismissed as premature. And the\nargument was made that this is just a continuation of\nthat first petition.\nNow, the difference here is that the claim\nwas not brought in the first petition, even though it\nwas pretty clear after that case of ours that you had a\nsure route to raising the claim if you raised it\nprematurely, and then brought the petition later.\nMR. WIERCIOCH: Your Honor, I think the\ndifference is, or the central holding, I believe, of\nMartinez-Villareal is that we do not bring these Ford\nclaims until they are justiciable, until they're ripe.\nIt's the unique nature of Ford claims. They are\nuniquely time specific.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If you bring it earlier,\nit will be unripe. But it did, I think, leave open the\nprecise procedural posture that we're in now. It didn't\nresolve that.\nMR. WIERCIOCH: Martinez-Villareal did not\nresolve that question, Your Honor, that's correct.\nThe other problem with the case, I think, is\nas you suggest, Justice Scalia, that there is a real\ndanger that these claims could be adjudicated\nprematurely. And that has happened in the Fifth\nCircuit, a case that both the State and we have cited in\nour briefs, Valdez versus Cockrell. And that was a post\nMartinez-Villareal case.\nThe other thing to keep in mind is that\nTexas law believes that these claims are premature as\nwell. So it was premature under Martinez-Villareal, but\nit was also unexhausted and unexhaustible under Texas\nlaw. And I think what Martinez-Villareal and Texas\nrecognize together is that these claims are most\nefficiently litigated at the end of the process, because\nof the unique nature of these claims.\nThe constitutional violation here is forward\nlooking, unlike most constitutional habeas claims that\nare backward looking. And it's the State's setting of\nthe date or making it imminent that triggers the\nviolation, that it is now going to carry out the\nexecution of someone who is potentially mentally\nincompetent.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The difference is that in\nMartinez-Villareal, it was plausible to say that this\nwas not a second petition. Now you may be quite right,\nthat there is good reason to say you shouldn't bring\nsomething that isn't ripe. But in that earlier case, we\nwere able to get around the language of the statute\nwhich says a second or successive petition is not\npermissible.\nHere, how do you get around the language\nother than to say it shouldn't be that way, that you\nshould be able to bring a second or successive petition\nwhen you're raising an issue that was not ripe at the\ntime of the first petition?\nI mean, as a policy matter, that's a very\ngood argument. But what do you do with the language in\nthe statute? And after all, Congress is entitled to\nsay -- to place limits upon our ability to review State\ncourt judgments.\nMR. WIERCIOCH: My answer would be that the\nCourt didn't make the mere mathematical calculation in\nMartinez-Villareal. That claim actually was raised\ntwice. It was raised in the first petition, and it was\nraised in a second when it was ripe. We've only brought\nour Ford claim one time. We brought it when it was\nripe, when the execution date was set. And I think\nthat's the difference there.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't say a second run\nat the same claim. It says a second petition. Even if\nyou bring new petitions in your second claim that\nweren't raised in your first, it's still a second or\nsuccessive petition, and I find it hard to get over that\nlanguage.\nMR. WIERCIOCH: The only thing I can say is\nthat the claim in a sense doesn't even exist until the\nState is announcing its intention to carry out the\nexecution in the near future by setting the date. And\nif we adopt the rule that the State wants, it's going to\nhave, as in Martinez-Villareal, perverse and seemingly\nfar-reaching consequences for habeas practice.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it material to your\nposition to show that there was deterioration in his\nmental condition between the time of the sentence and\nthe time you brought the petition? I.e., the -- during\nhis incarceration, his condition worsened?\nMR. WIERCIOCH: I think that is definitely\npart of it, Your Honor, but it also is the fact that we\ncannot predict with any reliability how severe mental\nillnesses are going to influence somebody's mental\nprocesses. And the nature of delusions themselves that\nfluctuate in intensity and severity, often influenced by\nlife events, can have an impact on the inmate's ability\nto understand the reason for his execution.\nIn this case it is, his delusion is wrapped\nup, it's central to it, as the reason he's being\nexecuted. And the intensity of his delusions or our\nability to predict that is -- we can't do it until that\nevent actually occurs, the event that's going to\ninfluence him, and that's the setting of the date.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why can't you have\nsought leave to file a second or successive application\nand met the requirements, if you're right that the\nfactual predicate for the Ford claim doesn't arise until\nthe execution is imminent?\nCouldn't you have fit your claim under\n2244(b)(2)(B), I guess, on that basis? And then we\ndon't have to engage in the fiction that a second\npetition is actually not a second petition.\nMR. WIERCIOCH: I don't think we could have\nfit under that provision, Your Honor, because that\nprovision requires that the evidence, established by\nclear and convincing evidence but for constitutional\nerror, no reasonable fact finder would have found the\napplicant guilty of the underlying offense.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose it doesn't\nfit comfortably under there, but I guess the argument\nwould be that -- guilty of -- we've used the concept of\nbeing guilty of the death sentence as opposed to guilty\nof the crime before, and the fact finder -- you wouldn't\nbe sentenced to death if the sentencer had known you\nwere incompetent. I appreciate that it's not the most\ncomfortable fit, but at least the part -- it seems to be\naddressed to the question of a factual predicate that's\nnot present at the time of the first habeas petition.\nAnd that seems to be your justification for not filing\nit at that time.\nMR. WIERCIOCH: That's part of the\njustification, but it's actually I think more than that,\nthat the claim isn't justiciable, that the claim doesn't\nexist. I think it would be as if trying to force a\npetitioner to raise, who's attacking a sentence of a\nnumber of years, to raise in that petition deprivation\nof good time credits, that there would be no claim at\nthat point for them to raise it. So it's the\njusticiability, I think, is --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. The point is\nthat (b)(2)(B) is addressed to that precise situation\nwhere the facts aren't present when you file the first\napplication.\nMR. WIERCIOCH: The facts aren't present,\nbut the constitutional violation has already occurred,\nand I think that's got to be the difference.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The constitutional\nviolation won't occur until the execution?\nMR. WIERCIOCH: Correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's prospective, as\nyou said?\nMR. WIERCIOCH: Right.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So your position basically\nis that \"petition\" hear means petition that could have\nbeen brought. This couldn't have because up to this\npoint there was nothing that was justiciable; is that --\nMR. WIERCIOCH: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- the textual argument?\nMR. WIERCIOCH: Yes, it is.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Then if you get beyond the\nsecond or successive question, your next point was\nwhether or not AEDPA applies?\nMR. WIERCIOCH: That's correct, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In the course of your\nargument, could you answer this: Suppose we find that\nthe State did not comply with the mandate of Ford\nbecause it didn't give adequate procedures to the\ndefendant, it did not give him an adequate opportunity\nto present his defense. Suppose we find that. I'm\ngoing to ask the same question of the State. Does that\nmean that the district court should then send it back to\nthe State? Or is the district court at that point\nentitled and required to hold a new hearing on the\nsubstantive issue of Ford competency?\nMR. WIERCIOCH: I would think it's the\nlatter, Your Honor. The State would argue --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Would it be within the\ndiscretion of the district court to send it back to the\nState? And say well, now you didn't give the correct\nprocedures and that's -- an invalidity. So we're\nsending it back to you. Would the district court have\ndiscretion to do that?\nMR. WIERCIOCH: I -- I would think not. I\nmean it's, the exhaustion remedy or the due process\nconstitutional requirements were not met by the state\ncourt judge, and they had their opportunity. They\ndidn't live up to the Ford procedures, and now we've had\na full, constitutionally adequate procedure in Federal\ncourt and we developed those facts. The only thing we\nreally need now is a standard from this Court and we can\nsend it back to the district court and apply that legal\nstandard.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It may be much harder for\nyou to get that standard on this Court's review of a\ncollateral proceeding than this Court's review of a\nstate proceeding, because of AEDPA.\nMR. WIERCIOCH: But our contention is that\nthe AEDPA does not prevent this Court from addressing\nthe merits of the constitutional issue here.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Because?\nMR. WIERCIOCH: Because the State court did\nnot abide by the minimum due process procedures set out\nby Justice Powell's opinion in Ford versus Wainwright,\nand that is the clearly established law even though it\nis a concurring opinion. He does not provide as much\ndue process protections as Justice Marshall's plurality\ndid.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Before we get too far into\nthe merits --\nMR. WIERCIOCH: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- I, I'm not done about\nthe jurisdiction yet. I wanted to ask you about the\nstatement you made in response to a question; you said\nit's not successive and it isn't a second petition if\nthe first one could not have been brought. Right? If\nthe first one was unripe?\nBut we've just decided this term that that's\nnot the rule. In Burden, we -- we -- we said that even\nthough a first, an earlier petition was unripe, the\nsecond petition was still a second petition. So that\ncan't be the principle that you're espousing, unless you\nwant us to overrule Burton the same term.\nMR. WIERCIOCH: You don't have to overrule\nBurton, Your Honor. Burton is distinguishable; Burton\nhad two or more petitions attacking the same custody of\nthe same judgment. The nature of the Ford claim is not\nthat we are telling the State that they cannot carry out\nthe execution of Mr. Panetti. We are just saying they\ncannot carry it out under a limited set of\ncircumstances.\nMr. Burton, on the other hand, could have\nraised all of his claims at the same time, but he -- he\nwent ahead and raised his conviction -- claims related\nto his conviction before he raised his claims related to\nhis sentencing.\nIf we had done that, if we had waited until\nthe Ford claim was ripe, all of our usual type habeas\nclaims would have been lost under the statute of\nlimitations. That would not have been the case in\nBurton.\nTo get back to your question,\nJustice Kennedy, the problem here -- let me just say,\nthe essential language of Justice Powell's decision on\nthe minimum due process requirements is that, number\none, an impartial decision-maker is required; and\nsecondly, that decision-maker has to have the ability to\nhear argument and receive evidence from prisoner's\ncounsel, including expert psychiatric evidence that may\ndiffer from the State's own psychiatric examinations.\nThat boils down to exactly what we didn't\nhave here. Now the key point is when the State's or the\ncourt's appointed experts went to evaluate Mr. Panetti,\nnew issues were raised; and those are the issues, they\nwere determinative issues, that we didn't have an\nopportunity to respond to. What happened is when they\nwent to see Mr. Panetti, they characterized his behavior\nas filibustering about the Bible, answering questions\nwith Biblical verses, refusing to answer questions until\nthey told him whether or not they were Christians. They\ntook all of those behaviors to mean that Mr. Panetti was\ncontrolling, manipulating and deliberately refusing to\nanswer questions, leading them to the conclusion that\nMr. Panetti was competent and he was just malingering.\nThat is exactly the type of evidence that we\nwere not able to respond to. We asked in a number of\nways throughout the State court proceedings to the trial\njudge, please, give us an opportunity of some sort to\naddress the issues, to make this proceeding fair. And\nthese -- these procedures that we asked for included\ncross-examination at a hearing and also funds to hire\nour own defense expert.\nIt's important to point out that our pro\nbono attorney who -- I'm sorry, our pro bono expert who\ndid an emergency evaluation two days before the\nexecution, was not a constitutionally adequate\nprocedure. The reason is clear. The State\ncourt-appointed attorneys -- I'm sorry, experts, had not\nyet been appointed, and they had not yet done their\nevaluation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: These -- these were not\nappointed by the prosecutor; they were appointed by the\ncourt?\nMR. WIERCIOCH: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Am I right?\nMR. WIERCIOCH: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you say that's\ninadequate. We have to have a full adversarial trial of\npsychiatric experts in every case where a prisoner\nclaims that he's not mentally competent to be executed.\nMR. WIERCIOCH: I respectfully disagree,\nYour Honor. We do not have to have that. What we do\nhave to have in a situation like ours where there is a\nnew issue that is brought up by the charges of,\nbasically malingering, that we have got to have an\nopportunity to respond to those charges, and engage that\nissue; and we were not able to engage that issue; and we\nasked for intermediate steps.\nThe other thing to keep in mind, Your Honor,\nis that the Texas procedure itself allows for a hearing.\nThat's how they comport with Ford. So we're not asking\nthe Court to overrule Texas's procedures. What happened\nhere is a maverick judge decided not to follow the\nstatute. And so it was specifically to our case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't seem to me, and\nthere's nothing in our history that requires, that you\nneed a full dress trial to decide this issue. And it\nseems to me perfectly reasonable for the trial court to\nappoint experts, not selected by the prosecutor but\nselected by the judge, and have them conduct the -- the\nexamination of the individual.\nI, I certainly don't want to -- you know --\na full dress trial on this issue in every case. And I,\nI don't know anything in our, in our tradition of due\nprocess that requires it.\nMR. WIERCIOCH: And we're not asking for\nthat, Your Honor. We're asking for something\nintermediate to that. It could have, like I said, it\ncould have been resolved by having the opportunity to\nhave our own expert especially in a situation where new\nissues are raised.\nI would contrast that with a situation where\nour pro bono expert had sent out a report; we overcame\nthe threshold showing that was necessary; two mental\nhealth experts are appointed under the statute, and\nthose experts addressed our experts' report and didn't\nraise any new issues, didn't bring anything new into the\nmix, but what was brought into the mix here is the\nmalingering charge.\nAnd I should add --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you -- you did have\nyour own expert, though? You had one expert of your\nown, right? No?\nMR. WIERCIOCH: We had a pro bono expert --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well.\nMR. WIERCIOCH: -- who --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Who was --\nMR. WIERCIOCH: -- allowed us, but we, we\nwent back to the well and he was not able to help us\nanymore after that initial threshold showing that we\nmade. And I'd like to point out that our position was\nvindicated when we finally did get constitutionally\nadequate procedures. Because what happened was this\nFederal district court judge found that Scott Panetti\ndoes suffer from a mental illness and it is\nsignificantly characterized by a delusional belief\nsystem in which he believes himself to be persecuted for\nhis religious activities and beliefs. So --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Your position is that the\naffidavit submitted to the district court by the\npsychiatrists are sufficient to vindicate your\nsubstantive position that he cannot be executed under\nFord?\nMR. WIERCIOCH: That's right. We had a full\nhearing. So we did more than just submit affidavits\nfrom our experts. But that did vindicate our position,\nYour Honor, yes.\nI'd like to turn now to the merits. The\ntest for competency that we have proposed is derived\ndirectly from Justice Powell's test that he set out in\nhis concurrence in Ford versus Wainwright.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This very important matter\nis going to be decided on the basis of the opinion of\none, one justice, what, 30 years ago?\nMR. WIERCIOCH: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You have no other appeal to\na long tradition of how we determine this matter, but\njust one opinion by one justice because he was the\nlowest common denominator on the Court at that time.\nThat seems to me very peculiar.\nMR. WIERCIOCH: That's not what Justice\nPowell did. I mean, what happened in Ford is that the\nCourt did look at all of the common law rationales for\nthe ban, the common law ban on executing the\nincompetent. And those rationales were also set out in\nJustice Powell's opinion, and they -- the Court -- a\nmajority of this Court agreed with certain of those\nrationales.\nThe two rationales being that execution of\nthe mentally incompetent does not further the\nretributive goal of capital punishment, and secondly,\nthat it's simply cruel to execute someone who does not\nhave the ability to take comfort of understanding, to\nprepare spiritually and mentally for his passing.\nSo the basis for this standard --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could you maybe\nelaborate on that? And mean if you have someone who is\ncompetent at the time they're convicted, competent at\nthe time they're sentenced, and you say they're walking\nto the gurney to be executed, you know, they fall and\nhit their head and they don't understand it, it's\nsomehow very cruel to go forward with the execution at\nthat point, while it wouldn't have been before?\nI -- it seems to me, I mean, obviously\ncompetence at the trial and sentencing is important. I\njust don't understand the concept that it has to\ncontinue to the point of execution.\nMR. WIERCIOCH: I think that's the very\nnature of the Ford right, that it is something that\nintervenes. We're not saying that Scott Panetti was not\nfully culpable, found guilty, sentenced to death; we're\nnot attacking that at all. Something happened. And\nwhat happened was he did lose the ability to understand\nrationally the connection between his crime --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well does he\nunderstand why he's being imprisoned? I mean, does\nthis, the Ford right extend to prison? Is it cruel to\nkeep someone locked up for life when they don't\nunderstand why they're being locked up for life?\nMR. WIERCIOCH: I think that would be a\ndifferent situation, Your Honor, because number one, we\ndon't have a common law heritage stretching back a\nthousand years to prevent the incapacitation or the\nincarceration of the mentally incompetent. And I think\nthe difference also is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We didn't have\nincarceration.\nMR. WIERCIOCH: Excuse me?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We didn't have\nincarceration extending back a thousand years. We -- we\nhad misdemeanors and felonies, all of which were\npunishable by death.\nMR. WIERCIOCH: The -- the difference,\nthough, I think, is if you're going to incarcerate\nsomebody or incapacitate them, we're not concerned with\ntheir mental state. All we are trying to do at that\npoint is deter them from committing other crimes. So I\ndon't think it's the same situation here.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. There's an\nelement of retribution to imprisonment, just as there is\nto capital punishment. Both deterrence and retribution\nin both instances, I would have thought.\nMR. WIERCIOCH: In capital punishment, yes,\nbut I guess I'm responding to your hypothetical, a\nperson who is sentenced to life in prison who is\nmentally incompetent, and I would think that the main\ngoal there is incapacitation, deterrence.\nJUSTICE ALITO: How far does your argument\ngo? If the defendant thinks the State or the jury had\nsome ulterior motive for his sentence, is that\nsufficient to -- to -- mean -- does that mean the person\ndoesn't have a rational understanding of the reason for\nthe death sentence?\nMR. WIERCIOCH: No, Your Honor, it doesn't.\nI think the key point here is that the\nperson must be suffering from a mental illness; and it\nis that mental illness that has to deprive the person of\nhis capacity to understand the connection between his\ncrime and his punishment.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All right. Let me ask you\nthis specific question. Let's assume that the\nindividual understands that both the necessary and the\nsufficient condition for his execution was his\nconviction of the crime. He also believes that they\nprobably wouldn't actually execute him except that they\nare persecuting him, in this case for his Christian\nadvocacy.\nDoes that person who understands the\nnecessary and sufficient condition for execution, but\nbelieves something else is afoot in the motivations of\nthose who are going to execute him, does that person\nhave a -- what you call a rational understanding such\nthat he may be executed?\nMR. WIERCIOCH: I would say that person does\nnot. And the reason being if the person in your\nhypothetical is suffering from a mental illness, and\nthese mental illnesses are very small fraction of the\ntype that include delusions, distortions in thought\ncontent, distortions in perception, distortions in\nthinking, that those very things prevent them from being\nreasoned out of their delusion by the facts that you've\nsuggested.\nIf they take those facts, such as Scott\nPanetti, that he knows the State's purported reason for\nhis execution, but that's not good enough.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It's more than -- in my\nhypothetical, it's more than a purported reason. He\nunderstands what the law is. The law is if you're\nconvicted of this crime, that enough -- is that -- that\nwill -- and sentenced to death at the penalty phase,\nthat is alone sufficient and in fact a required\ncondition for your execution.\nWhy can't that person, even though he thinks\nsome ulterior motivation is what's really driving the\nexecutioner, why can't that person prepare for death\njust as well as the -- I won't say just as well, but why\ncan that person not prepare for death just as he would\nprepare for death if he were not suffering from the\npersecution delusion?\nMR. WIERCIOCH: I think the difference in\nyour hypothetical has to be, Your Honor, that it's the\ncrime itself. It's not the conviction. It's the crime,\nthat this person has a rational understanding to connect\nhis crime to his punishment.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, do you claim in this\ncase that he does not understand that he was convicted\nof committing a crime or that he thinks he didn't commit\na crime?\nMR. WIERCIOCH: No, not that he does not --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If that's the case, then\nevery person who believes he's innocent of the crime is\nat least a candidate for the rule that you're asking\nfor.\nMR. WIERCIOCH: I would disagree, Your\nHonor. The difference is that again it has to be the\nproduct of a mental illness, and then that mental\nillness has to deprive the person of that capacity. So\nif it's somebody who just thinks they've been --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: One problem with a mental\nillness that is a peculiar feature of this case, in\nother cases something different is introduced late. It\nwasn't ripe. It wasn't there before. But here you have\nan individual who has a severe mental impairment. He\nhad it before he committed these murders. He's had it\nwhen he was -- when there was the original competency to\nsee if he could stand trial.\nHe had it all along. It may have manifested\nitself with different delusions at different times. And\nyet at every stage he says he's incompetent to stand\ntrial. They hold he is competent to stand trial. Then\nhe says, well, I'm competent, so I want to represent\nmyself. The judge says, yeah, you're able to represent\nyourself, you're competent.\nEvery -- this is not anything new that has\nhappened to him. He has been in this delusional state\nall along. And now to say at this point it counts, but\nat other points it didn't?\nMR. WIERCIOCH: I think the difference has\nto be, Your Honor, that, yes, he has suffered from a\ndelusion for 20 years and that's the spiritual warfare\nbetween himself and the devil. But the delusion takes\non a different form in the sense of when his execution\ndate was approaching it's now the culmination of this\nbattle between himself and Satan, and that is something\nthat we can't predict with any sort of reliability years\nin advance of the date. He didn't get his first date\nuntil four years after his first Federal petition was\nfiled.\nIf there are no more questions --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You mean we can't predict\nthat the delusion today is the same delusion yesterday?\nIs that what you're saying?\nMR. WIERCIOCH: I wouldn't say that the\ndelusion itself is changing. I mean, the delusion is\nthere, but it's taken a specific form of --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it's taken a specific\nform because the circumstance is different. He was\nbeing tried yesterday. He's going to be executed today.\nBut it's the same delusion, and it seems to me that\nJustice Ginsburg's issue is a kind of a proper issue\neven though the event on which he focuses has changed.\nMR. WIERCIOCH: That's true, Your Honor.\nBut again, I don't think we can predict that with any\nreliability because of the nature of delusions, the\nseverity, the intensity fluctuating; that until that\nevent, until that execution date is set and is imminent\nthere is no reliable way of predicting how it's going to\naffect his thinking, how it's going to affect his\nability.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. WIERCIOCH: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Cruz?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF R. TED CRUZ\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. CRUZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nFor centuries courts have struggled with how\nto reconcile mental illness with criminal justice. In\nthis case, however, the court should not reach the\nmerits of that issue because the AEDPA presents two\nindependent jurisdictional bars to reaching the merits.\nFirst, Section 2254 bars relief because the State court\nproceedings complied with clearly established law under\nFord; and second, the plain text of Section 2244 bars\nrelief because Panetti's claim was a second or\nsuccessive habeas application.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How should he have\nraised the claim to avoid the second or successive bar?\nMR. CRUZ: He could have raised it in\nprecisely the same way the petitioner did in\nMartinez-Villareal. He could have raised it in the\nfirst Federal habeas application. It would have been\ndismissed as unripe. And given -- following the Court's\nmajority opinion in Martinez-Villareal, that claim could\nthen be reopened at what time it did become ripe.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but that's a silly\nfiction. You're not reopening a claim. We can use any\nkind of language we want. The fact is that when he\nfirst raised it he didn't have a claim which bore a\nclose enough relationship to the time of execution.\nWhen he was able to raise the claim that bore enough of\na relationship, it was a freestanding claim itself. It\nseems to me that to say, well, he's simply reopening\nsomething that he reopened before is just playing with\nwords.\nMR. CRUZ: Justice Souter, I don't disagree\nwith you that as a policy matter it's not the most\nsatisfactory outcome. The difficulty -- and it's the\ndifficulty this Court wrestled with in\nMartinez-Villareal -- is the plain text of the statute\nsuggests a clear outcome, an outcome that is not\nnecessarily the most practical or efficient.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but you can deal with\nthe text of this. I mean, given the fact that there's\nno neat satisfactory solution to this no matter where we\nturn, the -- at least the text of the statute can be\nread to say that second successive petition at least\nmeans a petition when it raises -- refers to a petition\nin which a claim could previously have been brought.\nAnd if we say, look, unripe claims can't be brought at\nan earlier time, then it's not a second and successive\npetition in that sense. That's one way to you know --\nadmittedly, it's interpretive, but it's one way to deal\nwith the text. It's kind of a -- it seems to me more\nforthright than saying, well, he's just continuing or\nreviving the claim that he raised the first time around.\nMR. CRUZ: In our judgment that reading is\nnot consistent with the plain text of the statute.\nThe only two bases that Petitioner could\nlegitimately advance for disregarding the plain text are\nthat doing so would be absurd following the plain text\nor unconstitutional. He has attempted to advance\nneither. He's simply arguing it would be more\nefficient.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: More than that, the section\ngoes on to make an exception from the bar of second or\nsuccessive. The exception itself is a situation in\nwhich he could not have raised it earlier, namely he can\nget out of the bar if he shows that the claim relies on\na new rule of constitutional law, which he couldn't have\nraised before, or the factual predicate didn't exist\nbefore, which he couldn't have raised before.\nAll of those exceptions would be unnecessary\nif we interpret the provision itself to contain within\nit an exception for anything that couldn't have been\nraised before.\nMR. CRUZ: Justice Scalia, I think that's\nexactly correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then what do you say to the\nindication from those two exceptions that Congress\nsimply wasn't adverting to this problem?\nMR. CRUZ: Congress may not have been -- I\ndon't doubt that there is a real possibility Congress in\ndrafting this statute was not specifically considering\nFord claims. But what Congress was doing was writing\ninto law a general principle that every claim a habeas\npetitioner has that petition must include in his first\npetition.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Has. Has. He doesn't have\nthe claim at that first point.\nMR. CRUZ: Well, but given the exceptions,\nalso every claim he intends to raise at any point in the\nproceeding. In this case, Panetti was on full notice.\nHe had been arguing about competency from day one and he\nhad not only Martinez-Villareal which gave him a direct\npath to preserve this, but he had Fifth Circuit\nprecedent that required him to raise this and he\ndisregarded the Fifth Circuit --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You in effect are telling\nus that we've got to read this to mean that any claim\nthat he could conceivably have under any set\nof conceivable circumstances has got to be raised on the\nfirst petition with these two exceptions, and that in\neffect is a formula for frivolous pleading and, I mean,\nCongress couldn't have intended that.\nMR. CRUZ: Congress intended that this\nstatute be followed in order to have Federal district\ncourt jurisdiction over claims.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: This would mean that in\nevery first Federal habeas, no matter how farfetched,\nevery single Federal petitioner has to bring a Ford\nclaim. Otherwise he won't have it at the end of the\nroad. Has to burden the district judge with this that\nis frivolous because it's so far premature. But that's\nwhat you're saying, Congress -- the statute can be read\nonly that way, to say that the Ford claim has to be made\neven when there's no basis for it, even though it\ncouldn't be handled by the district judge.\nMR. CRUZ: Justice Ginsburg, I believe that\nis the way the Court found in Martinez-Villareal, to\nharmonize Ford claims with 2244.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What's your opinion, then,\nhow this is supposed to work? A person has been on\ndeath row for ten years, perfectly sane, no problem.\nHe's going to be executed next month. Tomorrow he\nbecomes catatonic, absolutely insane, no doubt about it,\nand now it is unconstitutional to execute such a person.\nNobody denies that. All right, now what's supposed to\nhappen?\nMR. CRUZ: Justice Breyer, I agree with you.\nThat is the heart of --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't want you to agree\nwith me. I want to know what you think should happen.\nMR. CRUZ: That hypothetical we discussed in\nour brief, precisely the one you raised.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And what's your opinion,\nbecause I didn't memorize every page. I read it. So\nwhat's your opinion how that works?\nMR. CRUZ: Under the plain text of the\nstatute, that individual would be barred access to\nFederal district court.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So your opinion is -- and\nthen is that constitutional, if in fact Congress passes\na statute and says there will be no court review of a\nperson who clearly the Constitution forbids to execute,\nthe State to execute him. Nobody doubts that. Nobody\ndoubts this is an unconstitutional execution, but there\nwill be no court review of a decision to the contrary.\nIs that constitutional?\nMR. CRUZ: Respectfully, Justice Breyer,\nthat's not our position, because Texas State law --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I know that's not --\nMR. CRUZ: -- provides court review, and so\nthat individual could raise a claim in State court, and\nthe State proceeding does not require that it had been\nraised previously, and this Court would have certiorari\njurisdiction over any decision from Federal -- from\nState Court rejecting that claim. So there is court\nreview in addition to original habeas actions filed\nbefore this Court.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The Constitution doesn't\nrequire Federal district court review.\nMR. CRUZ: That's correct. The Constitution\ndoesn't require Federal district courts.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay, I got that. So\nshould we treat this petition as if it's one for\noriginal habeas here?\nMR. CRUZ: The Court court do see.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, why not? Why not?\nBecause we have, after all, a claim that the Fifth\nCircuit has as a general matter misapplied the standard\nof this Court's cases as to what counts as insanity for\npurposes of the Constitution. Now, you say this blocks\nit, but it doesn't block a direct writ for habeas, so\nwhy not? It's an important general question. Someone\nmay be executed whom the Constitution forbids to have\nexecuted. Why not?\nMR. CRUZ: The Court could do so --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Would you object if we do\nthat?\nMR. CRUZ: Yes, we would.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because?\nMR. CRUZ: Because the Court has made clear\nthat the standards for an original habeas corpus are\nparticularly exacting and are informed by the\nlegislation Congress has passed governing habeas, and in\nparticular Section 2254. Section 2254 in our judgment\nprovides the simplest and clearest path to resolve this\ncase, and it doesn't resolve dealing with legislation\nthat admittedly is in some tension with the most\npractical and efficient course.\nSection 2254 requires that in 2004, at the\ntime of the State court proceedings, that the only way\nthat the judgment can be set aside is if it was contrary\nto clearly established law by this Court. In our\njudgment, no fair reading of Ford can yield such an\noutcome.\nPanetti points to two aspects of the State\ncourt hearing that he finds fault with: First, that it\nwas not a live evidentiary hearing; and second that the\nState did not appoint a psychiatrist for him and pay for\nit. Neither of those are consistent with the holdings\nof Ford. With respect to the first point, no\nevidentiary hearing, Justice Powell's controlling\nconcurrence was explicit. Ordinary adversarial\nprocedures complete with live testimony,\ncross-examination, and oral argument by counsel are not\nnecessarily the best means.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And I don't know that he's\ndisputing that. I thought his dispute was there's got\nto be some means for us to respond to what was a new\nissue as a result of the reports of the two\ncourt-appointed experts, the issue of malingering.\nAnd I don't know that he's saying it's got\nto come in one way or another way, but there's got to be\na means at least to respond to that new issue. What's\nyour answer to that?\nMR. CRUZ: Justice Souter, there was a\nmeans. In fact, the State court explicitly invited him\nto respond. He did in fact respond. He filed a 20-page\nobjection, a detailed objection.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You gave him one week and\nthere were no funds for his own psychiatrist.\nMR. CRUZ: Justice Kennedy, that's correct,\nbut that leads to the second argument that the State\nshould have paid for a psychiatrist. That may perhaps\nmake sense as a prospective rule, but to do so would\nrequire extending the rule of eight to habeas, to which\nit has never been extended, and extending it in\nparticular to competency hearing on execution. That\nwould be a new rule under Teague, and the plurality in\nFord explicitly suggested extending Ake to these\ncircumstances, and Justice Powell did not join that\nproposition. And so in my judgment, there is no fair\nway to read Ford to say a plurality that didn't control\nclearly established a holding that Ake extended to the\ncircumstances.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You do agree that Ford\nstands for the proposition that there must be a hearing\nthat meets the essentials of fairness so that the\ndefendant can contradict the hearings that -- the\nconclusions of the State-appointed psychiatrist?\nMR. CRUZ: Justice Kennedy, I would frame\nthe holding a little more narrowly, and I would use\nJustice Powell's words because his was the controlling\nconcurrence. And what he said is, \"The State should\nprovide an impartial officer aboard that can receive\nevidence and argument from the prisoner's counsel.\" And\nso \"receive,\" I would suggest is the critical word\nthere.\nThe Ford situation was very strange. In\nFlorida the governor had refused to accept any\nsubmissions from counsel, said I won't read anything\nyour psychiatrist submits. That was the principal\nfailing Ford focused on. In this case the district\ncourt asked for a response, received a 20-page written\nresponse, received an expert psychiatric report that was\nobtained by counsel. On any level, it satisfied the\nholding of Ford.\nJUSTICE BREYER: There's also the\nsubstantive part, that is, I think there's also an\nargument that the district court here, and the court of\nappeals, applied not just Justice Powell, but Marshall's\neven stronger, and they took -- they say about the same\nthing in Ford, I didn't see much of a difference, but if\nthere is, take Powell.\nAnd it seems to say, the Fifth Circuit\nfollowing, that if you can answer the question yes,\nprisoner, are you being executed? Yes. What does that\nmean? I'll die. And why are you? Because I committed\na murder. That that's the end of it. And they say\nexplicitly, it doesn't matter if the next thing the\nprisoner says and the reason that's going to happen is\nbecause of the wild dogs. You say, what do you mean?\nThe wild dogs are manipulating the minds of all of the\nState officials, all the witnesses, because I'm a victim\nof the wild dogs forever. And you have 15 psychiatrists\nand they absolutely prove that's what he thinks, and he\nthinks that this is all about dogs.\nNow should he have that delusional system,\nas I read the Fifth Circuit and the district court, that\nhappens to be irrelevant as to whether he is insane and\ncan't be executed. Now I can't read Powell and Marshall\nas saying that, so they're saying it's clearly contrary\nto Powell and Marshall, that sounds like a substantive\nclaim, and they say correct the Fifth Circuit please.\nWhat about that one?\nMR. CRUZ: Justice Breyer, the argument that\nyou suggest, Panetti has at no point made an argument\nthat substantively the State court decision violated\nclearly established law. And there's a reason for that.\nBecause there is no clearly established law on what the\nstandard is for competency. In Ford, there was one\njustice writing alone, because Justice Powell was not\njoined by anyone, and his opinion was not controlling on\nthe standard for incompetency. It was solely --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I did understand\ncounsel's argument to say that relief must be given, he\ncannot be executed, if he lacks the capacity to form a\nrational understanding of the nature and justification\nfor the punishment. You, I take it, would agree that if\nwe can just use the lay term, you cannot execute an\ninsane person if he is grossly psychotic, and you can't\nexecute a comatose person?\nMR. CRUZ: Justice Kennedy, we agree with\nthe proposition that executing the insane is\nunconstitutional. That was a holding of Ford.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So we're talking about\nwhat insane means, and that's a lay term. So suppose\nthere's a gross psychosis which is a severe\ndisorientation from reality and from rationality, and he\ncannot understand, and he lacks the capacity to\nunderstand the nature and the justification for his\npunishment.\nMR. CRUZ: That test is very close to the\ntest the State proposes. What Panetti is endeavoring to\ndo is to incorporate into the test rational\nunderstanding, which is deliberately borrowed from the\nFifth and Sixth Amendment jurisprudence concerning\ncompetency to waive counsel and to stand trial, and we\nwould suggest is a standard wholly inappropriate to this\ncircumstance.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But suppose you went back.\nYou see, you say it's just Justice Powell. But Marshall\nsaid for the Court, today we explicitly recognize that\nit has been, for centuries, is abhorrent to exact in\npenance the life of one whose mental illness prevents\nhim from comprehending the reasons for the penalty or\nits implications.\nSo that sounds like a stronger statement\nthan Powell. So you add Marshall to Powell, and you get\na court. It isn't just Powell. And I agree with you\nthat I don't know that that standard you just enunciated\nabout the rational one is the right test. Maybe the\nright test is just to repeat these words from Powell or\nsome others. But I think their claim is whatever that\nis, the Fifth Circuit's been using the wrong test.\nMR. CRUZ: In this case, Panetti satisfies\nthat test.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That may be. So maybe the\nthing to do is to send the case back to the Fifth\nCircuit and say you've been using the wrong test, this\nis the right test. Do it again.\nMR. CRUZ: There's no reason to do so.\nBecause the district court's factual findings\ndemonstrate conclusively that Panetti meets the\nappropriate test for competency to be executed. The\ndistrict court found that Panetti understands he\ncommitted these two murders. He knows that he murdered\ntwo people. He understand that he is going to be put to\ndeath.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's different from\nhaving a rational capacity to understand the nature and\njustification for the punishment. I think it is. I\nwould conclude it's a fair conclusion from the\npsychiatrist's affidavits and from their testimony, that\nhe knows he committed a crime, he knows he's being\npunished, and he's going to be executed for that crime.\nBut it stops there. The delusions prevent his\nunderstanding.\nMR. CRUZ: Well, it extends a little further\nthan there in that the test that Panetti possess\nrational understanding is found nowhere in any holding\nfrom this Court.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What about just\nrepeating -- see, what is worrying me is that the\ndistrict court said precisely what the Fifth Circuit\nsaid, indeed stronger. It says, \"Despite the fact that\npetitioner's understanding of the reason was impaired by\ndelusions,\" the Fifth Circuit concluded that that didn't\nmatter. Now, that means he is applying the same test in\nthe district court that then the Fifth Circuit applied.\nWhat would you think about our just quoting\nthe language from the Supreme Court opinions and say\nthis is the language of the test. We can't do better\nthan that. Go apply it.\nMR. CRUZ: As an initial matter, I do not\nbelieve the Court has jurisdiction to reach it because\nof 2254, because of the proceedings that on any level\ncomply with clearly established holdings from Ford. The\nonly way Panetti gets there is by extending Ake to these\nproceeding, and no court holding has ever so done.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I really do need your help\non a procedural part of AEDPA. Let's assume -- I know\nthat you don't agree with it -- let's assume that the\nState erred because it gave inadequate procedures to the\ndefendant with reference to the adjudication of\ncompetency to be executed. Let's assume that.\nWould the district court have had\ndiscretion, if it made that finding, to send the case\nback to the State court to have new proceedings?\nMR. CRUZ: Yes. And Justice Kennedy, I\nagree with you. And in fact, under AEDPA --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I was asking the question.\nSo don't agree with me.\nMR. CRUZ: I agree with you that the better\ncourse if the district court had concluded that would\nhave been to send it back to the State court.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And it had discretion to\ndo that?\nMR. CRUZ: I don't believe the district\ncourt had discretion --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no. Assuming he made\nthat finding.\nMR. CRUZ: I believe he had to do that. I\ndon't believe he had discretion. I believe that's what\nthe district court had to do, because Section (e)(2)(B)\nof AEDPA, which is the proceedings, the rules governing\nwhen the district court can hold an evidentiary hearing,\nrequire the exact same thing that 2244 requires, namely\nthat the claim go to the underlying guilt of the\noffense.\nSo I don't believe the district court had\nthe authority under AEDPA to hold an evidentiary\nhearing. If the district court concludes the\nproceedings didn't satisfy Ford, the remedy would to be\nsend that back.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What do you do if there's\nincompetency of counsel in a routine, not a death case,\nincompetency of counsel, and the district court finds\nincompetency of counsel? It then goes ahead and he\nhears all of the issues that a competent counsel would\nhave addressed, or it sends back to the State court?\nMR. CRUZ: In that circumstance, if the\nunderlying failure, the unconstitutional action, is a\nfailure to provide enough proceedings in a State court,\nI agree with your suggestion that the better course of\naction, the course consistent with AEDPA, is to send it\nback to the State court to provide that procedure.\nBut even if this Court thinks prospectively\nthat extending Ake to these circumstances is a good\nrule, there is not a word in Ford that so holds.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Cruz, may I just go\nback to the suggestion that there be, in effect, a\nremand to the State court. If we accept that\nproposition, then we are turning the United States\ndistrict court in effect into an appellate court\nreviewing the State judgment and the State action, and\nthat certainly is not what habeas is.\nMR. CRUZ: That is not the case, and in fact\nAEDPA provides the Federal district court can hold an\nevidentiary hearing and consider new facts if the claim\ngoes to the underlying guilt of the offense.\nThis particular --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but it's acting, it's\nacting in its own right. Some of the factual record\nthat it must be concerned with is determined by what\nhappened in the State courts; but it's not reviewing the\nState court as an appellate court would do. But if it\ncan remand and say, you didn't do enough for whatever\nreason, it seems to me it's exercising the equivalent of\nappellate jurisdiction.\nMR. CRUZ: Technically speaking, the way\nFederal district courts do this is they issue the writ\nconditioned, conditional upon the district court\nholding, or the State court holding the hearing.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Sure.\nMR. CRUZ: And so I don't disagree with you\nthat it's functioning not that different from an\nappellate court, but through the formalism of issuing a\nconditional writ.\nTurning to the merits or returning to the\nmerits, there was a square factual finding that Panetti\nknows that he's been sentenced to death for committing\nthese murders, and an additional factual finding that he\nhas the capacity to understand the reason for that. The\ndistrict court didn't resolve whether he, in fact,\nunderstands the reason for it, although the State court\ndid. The State court explicitly concluded that he in\nfact understands the reason.\nThe circumstance we have here is exactly the\ncircumstance suggested by Justice Souter's hypothetical.\nYou have an individual who knows he committed a crime,\nknows he's going to die, knows that he is -- the State\nis going to execute him because he committed the crime,\nbut he doesn't believe that reason. He at least asserts\nhe believes something else is going on.\nBut nothing in this Court's precedents or\nnothing in the principles behind the Eighth Amendment\nrequire a prisoner to believe the State's motivation.\nIt is enough that he is able to prepare to die, and the\ncentral focus Justice Powell focused on was the ability\nto prepare oneself to die. Panetti knows he's going to\nbe put to death.\nThere's an exchange in the record with\nrespect to one of his experts where he was talking about\nother executions. And in particular he goes through\nwith Dr. Mary Alice Conroy on page 148 of the joint\nappendix, he's talking about what happens when other\npeople are executed. And he says, you know, well, they\ngo to be executed and then sometimes they get a stay,\nand when they get a stay they come back, and when they\ndon't get a stay, well, then they go on either to be\nwith the lord or someplace too horrible to talk about.\nAnd his understanding of that is in marked\ncontrast to Alvin Ford's. Alvin Ford is the simplest\nand clearest metric to compare an individual defendant.\nAlvin Ford didn't know he was going to be executed. He\nwas unaware of what was going on. And this Court\nconcluded in Ford that it was cruel and irrational to\nsubject someone who had no idea what was coming to the\ndeath penalty.\nHere Panetti knows he's going to die and he\nalso knows he's guilty. So in terms of preparing for\ndeath, he can make his peace with the lord, he can make\nhis peace with the victim's family, he can prepare for\ndeath. He may in fact not believe the State's reasons,\nalthough it's worth noting that no court has ever so\nheld. What the Federal district court said is that his\nexperts state that he doesn't believe the reasons. But\non the other side, no fewer than six different\nprofessional psychiatrists have concluded that Panetti\nis deliberately exaggerating his symptoms, that he is\nmalingering, that he's acting bizarre in order to appear\nmore insane.\nAnd that presents a very difficult factual\nquestion. What do you do with someone who plainly has\nsome mental illness, but at the same time whom six\npsychiatrists who have studied him, in some cases for\nyears, who have treated him for years, six professional\npsychiatrists come in and tell the district court this\nindividual is exaggerating? That is an incredibly\ndifficult factual matter. The only way our system can\ndeal with it is to let the factfinder hear the competing\nexperts and make a judgment.\nIn this case, the Federal district court\nconcluded that the evidence of malingering, quote,\n\"casts doubt on the extent of Panetti's mental illness\nand symptoms.\" And that's at page 363 of the joint\nappendix.\nRather than resolve the question whether he\nin fact doesn't believe the State's reasons, what the\ndistrict court said is the Constitution doesn't require\nthat he believe the State's reasons. The Constitution\nsimply requires that he know what is happening, that he\nunderstand what is happening.\nThe test we have proposed focusing on two\nthings. One, capacity, which Panetti now agrees; and\nthe second thing we suggest is the test should be\nwhether a defendant can recognize he's going to die and\nthe reason. And \"recognize,\" we submit is consistent\nwith the words Justice Powell used, Justice Powell used\nthe words \"understand,\" \"aware of,\" and \"perceive.\"\nAnd so recognize was our attempt to capture\nwhat Justice Powell was talking about. It is less than\nrational understanding, it is less than the full panoply\nof being able to make all the litigation decisions one\nis required, say, to waive counsel; because as Panetti\nconcedes in his reply brief, there are no strategic\ndecisions remaining to be made. At the time of\nexecution, all that remains is for him to make peace and\nmove on so that the State may execute a justly entered\nsentence.\nThat test, we submit, is entirely consistent\nwith this Court's precedents. It furthers both\nretribution and deterrence. One point on deterrence.\nThe test Panetti points out really invites abuse.\nBecause rational understanding is -- is a standard that,\nparticularly when you think about mental illness and the\nability through medications of an individual to\naffirmatively decide to stop taking medications and\nexacerbate his symptom, it invites real abuse. Because\nrational standard we would -- or rational understanding\nwe would suggest is too high of a standard.\nIn our prisons there are unfortunately a\ngreat many people suffering from some degree of mental\nillness. At some level that's unsurprising. If you\nlook at the DSM-IV definition of sociopathy --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In your experience and in\nyour present position, have you seen many condemned\npeople with the symptoms as severe as this defendant?\nMR. CRUZ: We -- we have litigated cases\nwhere people have raised Ford claims. In fact one of\nthe ones we recently litigated involved an individual\nwho was convinced he was on death row and being executed\nbecause there was a conspiracy of Jews and homosexuals\nthat was out to get them -- out to get him. That sort\nof delusion unfortunately is not uncommon on death row\nand it is not uncommon in prisons for paranoia -- the\ntestimony of one of Panetti's experts, Doctor Conroy\nsaid, quote, \"The major portion of our population in our\nin-patient units are diagnosed with some form of\nschizophrenia.\"\nIf you think of sociopathy, which is defined\nas -- quote -- under the DSM-IV, \"a lack of regard for\nmoral or legal standards in the local culture.\" It is\nunsurprising that people that have a lack of regard for\nright and wrong, a lack of regard for others' lives,\nfrequently commit crimes in which they murder and injure\nother people.\nAnd yet our criminal justice system is\npredicated upon holding people to account unless they\nmeet the standards for legal insanity.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't suppose you have\nstatistics of how many have been sentenced to death and\nhave later been found incompetent?\nMR. CRUZ: We have endeavored to compile\nthose statistics and that has been -- we don't have any\nfor the court. One difficulty is in practice sometimes\nthe State will not seek death. Often these are\nunreported decisions across the State. So unfortunately\nwe don't have those statistics, although we did endeavor\nto compile them.\nIf there are no further questions?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Cruz.\nMr. Wiercioch, your rebuttal time was used\nup but not primarily by you. If you want to take two\nminutes for rebuttal?\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY W. WIERCIOCH\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER\nMR. WIERCIOCH: Thank you, Your Honor.\nThank you.\nThe, the only point I'd like to make is\nwe're talking about a very narrow fraction of serious\nmental illnesses here. We're talking about people who\nhave distortions in thought content, distortions in\nperception, distortions in their thinking processes.\nThis is not the vast majority of people on death row,\nand it is, certainly, I have seen no one as mentally ill\nas Scott Panetti. There are very few people that would\nbe compared to him.\nJUSTICE ALITO: How would you phrase the\ntest to determine how severe the mental illness has to\nbe?\nMR. WIERCIOCH: I think it has to be a\nmental illness -- again I would come back to the fact\nthat the mental illness has to deprive the person of the\ncapacity to make that rational understanding, and that's\nwhy delusional behavior is crucial in most of these\ncases to depriving that person of the capacity. Because\neven if you tell the person they're being executed for\nthe crimes they've committed, that is not enough to talk\nthem out of their delusion. It is not enough to reason\nthem out of their delusion.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Rational understanding of\nwhat? That's -- that's the problem. Rational\nunderstanding of what. The State says he has rational\nunderstanding of the fact that he is going to die, and\nthe reason he is going to die.\nNow, what -- what beyond that do you insist\nhe have a rational understanding of?\nMR. WIERCIOCH: He has to have a rational\nunderstanding that he is being executed precisely\nbecause of the crime that he committed. He -- the\ndistrict court never found that he had that. That he\nhad an understanding or that he was aware of the State's\nit's stated reason for his execution, and that stated\nreason becomes --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- so if he, if\nhe firmly believes for whatever reason that he's\ninnocent, then he can't be executed under your test.\nMR. WIERCIOCH: I would disagree Your Honor.\nWhat it is is if he is suffering from a mental illness\nthat deprives him of that capacity. So someone with\nantisocial personality disorder, something of that\nnature, where none of the features of that disorder\nimplicate distortions in thought process, thought\ncontent or perceptions, it's not -- it's going to have\nthat capacity but they just refuse to accept the State's\nreasons.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.\n"
