LANDAU: Justice Scalia, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn section 16(b) of the 1934 Exchange Act,\nCongress created a cause of action to allow securities\nissuers to recover short-swing profits from certain\ncovered persons, but specified that a lawsuit must be\nbrought 2 years after the date the short-swing profit\nwas realized. The statute doesn't say 2 years after the\ndate the defendants filed a section 16(a) report, as the\nNinth Circuit and Respondents would like to have it.\nNor does the statute say 2 years after the date the\nplaintiff discovers the short-swing transaction, as the\nGovernment would like to rewrite it.\nI'd like to make two basic points here\ntoday: First, as this Court recognized in Lampf, the\n2-year time limit in section 16(b) is best read as a\nperiod of repose that can't be extended at all; and,\nsecond, even if section 16(b)'s 2-year time limit could\nbe extended, the doctrine of equitable tolling wouldn't\napply to extend the time limit here, where the plaintiff\ndidn't act diligently to bring a claim and didn't prove\nthat any extraordinary circumstances precluded her from\nfiling. The upshot of these two points is that this\nCourt should reverse the Ninth Circuit's decision and\nremand the case with directions to dismiss the complaint\nas untimely.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: On your first --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, would --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: On your first point, you\ncite Lampf, but Lampf had two limits. So, it said --\nwhat was it, 1 year from whatever, from discovery. And\nthen it set an outer limit at 3 years, and it was the\nsame thing in Merck. Here we just say -- it just has\nwhat seems to me a plain vanilla statute of limitations\nthat is traditionally subject to waiver, equitable\ntolling. We don't have that special kind of statute\nthat gives you one limit and then sets a further limit\nthat will be the outer limit.\nMR. LANDAU: Your Honor, with respect, it's\ncertainly true that a two-pronged time limit underscores\nthat the outer prong is a period of repose, but there's\ncertainly no magic words that Congress has to use. It\ndoesn't have to use a two-pronged time limit to\nestablish the outer limit as a period of repose. In\nfact, that's really the lesson of this Court's decision\nin TRW and in Beggerly and Brockamp, that the -- the\nbackground or the default rule, the background rule that\nequitable tolling applies, isn't some kind -- is just\nthat. It's a background rule. And Congress, in the\ntext or structure --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But what takes you out of\nthat background rule in this case? You don't have the\ntwo-pronged structure, which really did, as Justice\nGinsburg said, drive the analysis when we -- when we\ntalked about those provisions. So, that's not there.\nSo, what takes you out of the default position, which is\nequitable tolling applies?\nMR. LANDAU: Sure, Your Honor. I think --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: On the statute of\nlimitations --\nMR. LANDAU: The key point, Your Honor, is\nthat this Congress in the 1934 Exchange Act was\ncarefully attuned to the issue of time limits.\nCongress -- there was -- there was a lot of discussion\nof this. This is a not a situation where Congress\nestablished a liability and just didn't focus on this\nissue, as often happens, and left it to background\nstatute of limitations provisions or other background\nrules. Congress thought long and hard about this.\nWith respect to the two-prong provisions,\nthose are the fraud provisions that were set at an outer\nlimit of 3 years. And then they actually created a\ndiscovery rule that said we don't even want people to\nwait the whole 3 years; if they've discovered the facts\nunderlying their claim, we want them to bring it within\na year. So, they used discovery to shorten the time,\nnot to extend it.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Right. But I guess I'm\nstill not understanding why, if you look at this\nprovision, you would think of this as anything other\nthan an ordinary statute of limitations. What is it\nabout this provision -- or, I don't mean to -- to -- I\nmean, you can -- you can make structural arguments. But\n-- but, you know, what factors do you think in this\nprovision makes it a statute of repose?\nMR. LANDAU: Two things, Your Honor. First,\nI'd like to just finish on the structural point; and we\nalso have a textual argument.\nWith respect to the structure, this, let's\nnot forget, was enacted at the same time and as part of\nthe same statute as these other provisions that did use\ndiscovery provisions to shorten the time limit. What\nCongress did with respect to 16(b), instead of having\nthe 3-year outer limit plus a safety valve that would\nmake you have to sue even sooner, Congress has brought\nin the outer limit. The -- instead of 3 years as in the\ntwo-prong provisions, said you've got to sue within 2\nyears. Having said you've got to sue within 2 years,\nthey decided you didn't need that safety valve\nprovision. But it would be very --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The problem is it reads\nlike dozens of statutes of limitations. It says no suit\nmore than 2 years and that -- I think that the general\nunderstanding is that that limitation, that kind of\nlimitation -- there is a presumption that it is subject\nto equitable tolling, forfeiture, waiver. And why, if\nthis one doesn't use any different words, why should --\nMR. LANDAU: Two things, Your Honor. This\nlegislation -- again, this section 16 is not a\nstand-alone statute. It was enacted as part of the '34\nAct. And so, I think you -- the same Congress that set\na hard outer limit of repose for fraud claims in section\n9(e) and 18(c) wouldn't have wanted with respect to this\nprophylactic provision that it is, by definition, both\nunder- and over-inclusive. It may be --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I could turn the\nargument around on you. Congress surely knew how to\nwrite a statute of repose because it did it in this\nstatute, but it didn't do it with respect to these kinds\nof violations. This statute of limitations, I'm going\nto call it, reads very differently from the two-pronged\npositions that we've interpreted in the past.\nMR. LANDAU: Again, Your Honor, I think one\npoint, just to respond to that and as well to Justice\nGinsburg's question, the -- the typical textual hook for\na statute of repose is that it's keyed off of the\ndefendant's conduct -- 2 years after the defendant does\nX, Y, or Z. That is -- as we quoted Black's Law\nDictionary for this proposition in our brief. The\nSeventh Circuit, Justice Posner, had an opinion just\nlast week underscoring this point, the Hy-Vee case, that\nsaid the typical statute of limitations actually says 2\nyears after the cause of action accrued or after the\nplaintiff discovered, but when you're -- when -- again,\nwe don't think -- in this case, we are not relying\nsolely on the textual thing, but in terms of numbers of\nguideposts, this is not your classic statute of\nlimitation. If you actually start looking at them, a\nlot of them key off of accrual.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Is that -- is that true? If\nwe were to look at all the statutes of limitations in\nthe -- in the U.S. Code, we would find that they are\ngenerally or exclusively drafted like section 1658, the\ngeneral statute of limitations provisions, and are\ngeared to or are triggered by the accrual of the action\nrather than some event?\nMR. LANDAU: Your Honor, I think we can't\nsay that there is a bright-line rule. Congress --\nagain, I think the most we can say is that the classic\nformulation of a statute of repose is to key a time\nlimit off of the defendant's conduct as opposed to the\naccrual. And, again --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, the problem is\nthat the injury here is the defendant's conduct, meaning\nif the nature of the claim, as is here, that someone has\nreceived a profit they're not entitled to, then the\ninjury is the same. The profit belonged to the\nshareholders or the corporation, not to the insider.\nSo --\nMR. LANDAU: Clearly to the -- yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- textually the nature\nof the claim here is the very injury, plaintiff's\ninjury.\nMR. LANDAU: Well, Your Honor, again, one of\nthe things about this statute that's kind of odd, it's a\nprophylactic statute that doesn't even require any\ninjury. I mean, it just says there has got to be\ndisgorgement to the corporation. It's a little bit\ndifferent --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, disgorgement is\ninjury, meaning that it's something that -- that you're\ntaking away from someone else.\nMR. LANDAU: But it's taking it away from\nthe defendant. It doesn't actually mean that actually\nsomebody else would have earned that money.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Tell me what logic there\nis in reading this as a statute of repose, other than\nyour argument about finality and its importance.\nMR. LANDAU: I think --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If we take your\nadversary's position that this statute of limitations\nwas geared under an understanding that an insider would\nin fact make the requirements -- would file the\nstatements required by 16(a), then it makes absolute\nsense to think of it as a statute of repose. But if\nCongress understood that some wouldn't do the statutory\nrequirement and file in a timely manner, why wouldn't\nequitable tolling be a more appropriate way to look at\nthis?\nMR. LANDAU: I think the key point, Your\nHonor, is to look at the 1934 Exchange Act as a whole,\nwhich includes not only this provision but also\nout-and-out-fraud provisions that are for intentional,\nreal hard-core insider trading. That would be sections\n9(e) and 18(c). There is no question that Congress\nprovided a period of repose for those, the outer limit.\nAnd then that raises the question that\nJustice Ginsburg started with, which is, do you have to\nhave a two-prong limit? And the answer to that is no,\nyou don't -- there's no magic words, as TRW, Beggerly,\nand Brockamp show us. You just have to try to make\nsense of the statute as a whole. And Congress would not\nhave wanted to give repose to intentional fraudsters but\nnot give repose to a defendant in a purely prophylactic\nsection 16(b) action. I think that's the fundamental\nthing when you just step back and look at this.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, it's -- it's not\nsimply a prophylactic. I mean, there's an objective\nthat 16(a) expresses; that is, Congress wanted these\ntrades to be reported and to have the form filed, Form 4\nfiled. So, it's a -- it's a disclosure-forcing\nprovision, 16(a) is. Then, why would Congress mean for\nit to operate to immunize a defendant who has not made\nthat filing and who has concealed what was supposed to\nbe reported in 16 -- under 16(a)?\nMR. LANDAU: Your Honor, for the same reason\nthat Congress would have afforded repose even to\nout-and-out fraudsters. Again, Congress was creating\nvast new liability here. A fraudster by definition, as\nsomebody who would be liable under 18(c) or 9(e), has\ndone kind of to conceal it. Yet, Congress still\nbelieved, because it was creating this vast new\nliability --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Judge Posner, Mr. Landau,\nhas a theory for why it is that fraud is treated\ndifferently from the 16(b) offenses, and it's that it's\nmuch more important to prevent strategic behavior\ninvolving timing in fraud suits -- the stock price goes\nup, the stock price goes down -- whereas, in these\nsuits, damages are fixed. It doesn't really matter\nwhere you bring them. So, it's not nearly as important\nto set a clear limit.\nMR. LANDAU: Well, like many of Judge\nPosner's theories, it's -- it's a very clever theory,\nbut in a sense, it misses the fundamental truth that\nwhen Congress is granting repose, it is trying to allow\npeople to turn the page on something in their past. The\nidea that Congress would grant repose to more culpable\npeople but not to less culpable people --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, you have one theory,\nwhich -- which deals with culpability; and he has\nanother theory, which deals with strategic behavior.\nAnd I don't know how to pick between those two theories,\nto tell you the truth. The text doesn't suggest which\none Congress was thinking about. And that puts me back,\nand let's look at this provision, and this provision\nlooks like an ordinary vanilla statute of limitations.\nMR. LANDAU: Well, again, the only thing\nI'll say on repose before -- and I'd like to turn\nthen -- because we certainly don't need repose to win\nthis case, and -- and while we think it is best\ncharacterized, this Court in Lampf had occasion to look\nat all of the various time limits and see how they all\nworked together. And this Court characterized section\n16(b) as a statute of repose.\nTo be sure, that was dicta because Lampf,\nitself was not a 16(b) case. But it was -- it was -- it\nwas a statement or it was a recognition that came after\nlooking at all of these, and it would be strange now to\nsay that, in fact, the 16(b) time period is\npotentially -- the Court said it was more restrictive,\nand both the majority and Justice Kennedy in dissent\nagreed that it was a statute of repose.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, Lampf was a\ndisaster, wasn't it? Congress had to try to patch up\nwhat we had done.\nMR. LANDAU: Absolutely not, Your Honor.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. LANDAU: Lampf stands as a landmark.\nBut -- but let me make clear, Your Honor. Our position\nhere today doesn't depend on this being a statute of\nrepose, because even if this 2-year time limit --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Before you turn away from\nthe statute of repose, could I just ask you one more\nquestion --\nMR. LANDAU: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- on -- on that? If -- if\n16(a) reports are not filed, how likely is it that a\npotential 16(b) plaintiff will find out within the\n2-year period that there were these trades?\nMR. LANDAU: Your Honor, they can find out\nin many ways, the same ways that any other securities\nplaintiff, including a fraud securities plaintiff, can\nfind out. There are corporate books and records that\ncan be examined. There are other SEC filings and SEC\ninvestigations. There's other litigation. This could\ncome up in an estate discovery -- estate or divorce\nproceedings. There are whistle blowers, confidential\ninformers, brokers, counterparts -- counterparties.\nAgain, if Congress had wanted the section\n16(a) disclosure to be the trigger under section 16(b),\nit could have done so. And, in fact, as we noted in our\nbrief, there was an early draft in the House that\ncreated a two-prong provision and established for -- you\nknow, it's an outer limit of 3 years and an inner limit\nof 6 months after the 16(a) disclosure.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What would -- what are the\nother filings that might disclose this?\nMR. LANDAU: Well, Your Honor, again,\nlike -- this case is a good example. In this very case,\nthe contradiction at the heart of the plaintiff's case\nis that they say, well, it can't possibly be discovered\nwithout a 16(a) filing. There was no section 16(a)\nfiling. To this day, they say the statute of limitation\nhas not started to run.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is there a public\ndocument that a -- that a shareholder can look at to see\nwhether an insider has traded within 6 months?\nMR. LANDAU: Well, Your Honor, there is not\na -- there is not a Form 4, which is a public document.\nBut not every securities filing requires a public\ndocument. In --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I didn't ask that. I'm\ngoing back to Justice Alito's question, which is how\neasy is it to find out without the 16(a)?\nMR. LANDAU: Well, again, there may be SEC\nfilings. There are --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's a big thing. I\ndidn't ask maybe.\nMR. LANDAU: Well, no, there -- there are\nSEC filings that companies are required to make. There\nare -- again, this is not a -- a -- selling -- buying\nand selling shares is not something that can be done\nalone in the dark of night. You need to have other\npeople involved with you. You need to have brokers\ncomplicit. You -- it's a large amount of shares. The\ncounterparties --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And so, what's the\nlikelihood that a broker's going to turn you in?\nMR. LANDAU: There are whistle blowers.\nThat's the -- that's the --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's a very nice\nthing, but what -- how likely is that?\nMR. LANDAU: Your Honor, brokers have their\nown responsibilities. A broker could be held liable as\nan aider or abettor to a violation.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How would the broker\nknow that the -- that his principal didn't file a form\nhe was required to?\nMR. LANDAU: Well, again, the broker may get\nsuspicious if the -- a broker may actually be checking.\nIf a -- if a -- if a CEO of a corporation is suddenly\nselling all these things -- again, this is no different\nthan the way -- a securities plaintiff in an out-and-out\nfraud case, and those are brought every day, Your Honor.\nBut, again, I think the point here is that,\nregardless of whether this is repose, even if you say\nthat this can be extended, it certainly can't be\nextended in the way that the Ninth Circuit extended it.\nAnd we and the SEC, the Government, agree on this: That\nthe Ninth Circuit adopted this absolute black-letter\nrule that says it is tolled -- it doesn't even start to\nrun unless and until the section 16(a) report is filed.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How about the Second\nCircuit rule?\nMR. LANDAU: The Second Circuit rule is more\nof a notice approach that says that it -- but, again,\nYour Honor, the problem with the Second Circuit's\napproach is that it doesn't reflect traditional\nbackground norms of equitable tolling. Then, if you say\nit's not a statute of repose, then what do you do just\nto figure out what Congress would have wanted? You say\nCongress legislates against the -- the -- the backdrop\nof these kind of equitable doctrines. So, let's look at\nwhat equitable tolling consists of.\nThis Court in many cases over the years --\nit's been dealing with equitable tolling since almost\nthe first days of the Court, well into the 19th century.\nIn the most recent cases, the Court has made clear, in\nthe Holland case, for instance, just two terms ago, that\nequitable tolling traditionally has two minimum\nrequirements.\nFirst, there has to be diligence on the part\nof the plaintiff. And in this context that means does a\nreasonable -- did the plaintiff know or would a\nreasonably diligent shareholder have reason to know of\nthe claim; and, second, extraordinary circumstances.\nAnd so, with respect to the Second Circuit's\ndecision in Litzler, Your Honor, that you mentioned, I\nthink it departs from traditional equitable tolling\nin -- in a couple of ways. Most particularly, it limits\nit to actual knowledge. It doesn't say \"know or should\nhave known,\" which again is the background rule, as we\nand the Government agree.\nThe second thing with respect to Litzler\nwhere it departs from the background rule is it says\nthat it is -- per se gives rise to equitable tolling not\nto file the section 16(a) and doesn't include any kind\nof culpability on the defendant's part. And Judge\nJacobs, in footnote 5 of Litzler, dropped a footnote\nsaying that he would prefer to announce a tolling rule\nthat was more consonant with, again, background rules of\nequitable tolling, that said only when the failure to\nfile the section 16(a) was unreasonable or -- or\nintentional, because he would say otherwise you could\nhave a purely technical or inadvertent violation that\nwould give rise potentially to equitable tolling, and he\ndidn't think that was right.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Landau, if we were to\nagree with you on one or both of those two things,\nwouldn't the normal course be to remand? And what's\nyour best argument for why we should decide it?\nMR. LANDAU: Our best argument, Your Honor,\nis that the district court in this case already decided\nthe very issue here. The district court said it is\nundisputed, just on the pleadings, that -- that they\nknew or should have known.\nThis case is probably the most egregious\nkind of case that you can see for this proposition\nbecause everything here is a replay of the IPO\nlitigation and even the Billing case that came all the\nway to this Court. This case was filed just a few\nmonths after this Court decided Billing. And in\nparticular -- they have now -- the Respondents have come\nand said, well, what we didn't know here was group, and\nwe didn't know that the -- the underwriters were in a\nconspiracy with the issuer insiders, and that was the\npiece of the puzzle that we were missing. And --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: We have to accept the\nplaintiffs' allegations as true. You may well be right\nthat they really knew or they should have known. But,\nat this stage, we can't make that judgment because we\nhave to accept the plaintiffs' allegations as true.\nMR. LANDAU: Correct, Your Honor, but you\nare entitled, in deciding that, to look at their own\npleadings. And there's two important things from their\nown pleadings.\nFirst, if you look at their complaint,\nit's -- it alleges lock-up as its theory of group. It\nsays that the plaintiffs and the -- the underwriters and\nthe issuer insiders formed a 16(a) group because they\nhad these lock-up agreements. Well, those lock-up\nagreements were publicly known as early as the\nprospectus of these IPOs. So, the -- the lock-up\nagreement was no secret.\nSecond, they say, well, we -- even though,\nlike, lock-up might have been out there, we didn't know\nthere was this underpricing-based conspiracy. And even\nassuming they could try and slice and dice it like that\naccording to the -- the legal theory, the fact is in\ntheir motion to dismiss in the district court, they\ncited -- this is docket 58 in the district court, pages\n1 to 2 -- they go at length about the academic\nliterature regarding a conspiracy between underwriters\nand issuer insiders that they say gives legitimacy to\ntheir substantive claim. But that includes lots of\narticles, including a 2004 article -- again, 2005 would\nbe 2 years before they filed.\nSo, they are relying in their opposition to\nour motion to dismiss on an article -- there's a lengthy\nfootnote that says there's a ton of academic research on\nthis particular theory. So, basically, a remand is\nunnecessary because the -- the pleaded facts by the\nplaintiff themselves show this is untimely as a matter\nof law.\nI'd like to reserve the balance of my time,\nif there's no further questions.\nThank you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY B. WALL\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE\nMR. WALL: Justice Scalia, and may it please\nthe Court:\nI'd like to start where Justices Ginsburg\nand Kagan did, because if you picked up this statute, it\nwould look for all intents and purposes like an ordinary\nstatute of limitations. And the question then is, how\nhas Congress rebutted that presumption of equitable\ntolling either as a matter of text, context, or\nstructure?\nAnd as I understand it, Petitioners have two\nbasic arguments, both of which are incorrect. The first\nis textual. They say, well, it runs from the time of\nthe complained-of event. But the reason they can't put\ntoo much weight on that, Justice Alito, is because if\nthey looked through the statutes and the Court's cases,\nthey would come across cases like Exploration Company or\nDelaware State College, where the statute ran from the\ntime of the complained-of event, and this Court treated\nit as an ordinary statute of limitations subject to\nequitable tolling; and they'd come across Beggerly,\nwhich ran from accrual. And yet, the Court said statute\nof repose not subject to equitable tolling.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, if you were drafting a\nstatute of repose, how would you phrase it other than\nthe way this is phrased?\nMR. WALL: I think normally what Congress\ndoes is it says there should be no jurisdiction after a\nparticular time, because it's not trying to\ndifferentiate among the application of different\nequitable background principles.\nBut there are statutes --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Gee, but we've -- we've\nsaid that, under our recent jurisprudence anyway, we\nwould -- we would treat that as a statute of\nlimitations. And I assume we'd treat it like a normal\nstatute of limitations subject to tolling.\nMR. WALL: Justice --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You think whenever --\nwhenever we encounter a -- a statute of limitations that\nis -- is phrased in jurisdictional term, there can be no\ntolling?\nMR. WALL: I think, Justice Scalia, that\nwhere you have statutes that say there shall be no\njurisdiction after a particular time, this Court has\nread them to cut off equitable tolling after that time.\nBut Congress could have written the statute to say the\ntime limit shall not be tolled. And there are statutes\nlike that. Now, most of those statutes say there shall\nbe no tolling except in particular circumstances,\nbecause Congress has considered it more finely. But\nthey could make the prohibition absolute.\nAnd the second argument that I understand\nPetitioners to have is basically structural. They say,\nwell, look, they borrowed the language from the outer\nprong of the two-prong limit.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Before you get to that, do\nyou have an example of a -- a classic statute of repose\nthat I could look at to see how they should be phrased,\nand not one that says that there shall be tolling --\nthere shall not be tolling except in some circumstances,\none that just says this is it; no tolling whatsoever?\nMR. WALL: You mean other than statutes as\nin Merck and Lampf where there were tiered structures?\nJUSTICE ALITO: Right. Right.\nMR. WALL: There --\nJUSTICE ALITO: A stand-alone provision.\nMR. WALL: I think that the statute in\nBeggerly was an example where the Court said, even\nthough it runs from accrual, it incorporates a discovery\nrule and it sets a 12-year limit. And so, textually and\ncontextually -- I mean, I don't think there is any\nclassic formulation. I think that's why Petitioners\ncan't point you to anything, because the courts always\nlook to all the indicia of statutory meaning: text,\ncontext, and structure. So, the same language can\ncreate a statute of limitations or repose.\nSo, in Lampf and Merck, if those statutes\nhadn't had a two-tiered structure, just the language of\nthe outer prong as the statute alone, I think the Court\nwould have treated it as a statute of limitations. The\nCourt didn't say in Lampf that language creates a\nstatute of repose, full stop. It drew a structural\ninference by looking at both of the prongs and comparing\nthem to each other.\nSo, when Petitioners say, whoa, but they\nborrowed the language of the outer limit and we know\nthat's repose, well, we only know it's repose in the\ntwo-prong provisions because of their structure. And\nthis provision doesn't have that structure.\nSo, I don't think I can point you to any\nclassic formulation because the same words can be either\na limitation or repose, depending on what else Congress\ndoes in that statute.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't -- I think you\nunderstate the -- the strength of Petitioners' argument\nin this regard. It seems to me where you say, you know,\n3 years unless the plaintiff knows sooner than that, and\nthen you say 2 years unless the plaintiff knows earlier\nthan that, and then you say 2 years -- it seems to me\nthat the implication is 2 years, period. Whether the\nplaintiff knows earlier, later, doesn't matter.\nMR. WALL: Justice Scalia, I don't know what\nelse to say except that that would overrule Exploration\nCompany and Delaware State College.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's what we said in\nMerck. I mean, wasn't Merck just like that? It says a\ncause of action can be or whatever -- may not be\nbrought -- may be brought not later than the earlier of\n2 years after the discovery of the facts or 5 years\nafter the violation.\nI take it that means 5 years after the\nviolation. Forget about the discovery of the facts.\nMR. WALL: Well, that's right, but the --\nthe reason that that language created a period of\nrepose --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because they were both --\nMR. WALL: -- was because of the structural\ninference. I took Justice Scalia's hypothetical to be\nif the statute just said no suit shall be brought more\nthan X years after the violation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but what if those\nthree provisions had been -- you know, followed each\nother immediately? You know, 3 years unless, you\nknow -- with a cutoff that would make it shorter, and\n2 years with a cutoff that would make it shorter, and\nthen a third one just says 2 years. You think there\nwould be no implication that the 2 years means 2 years,\nperiod?\nMR. WALL: I think the implication would be\nthat, in the others, Congress created a period of repose\nby using very specific language to do that. And in the\nthird, it didn't. It wrote it like an ordinary statute\nof limitations. Now, it could have written it\ndifferently, Justice Scalia. It could have said no suit\nshall be brought after X time, which is the ordinary\nlanguage of statute of limitations, and that time shall\nnot be tolled. And Congress has done that in other\nstatutes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If you extinguish the\nclaim -- the statute of limitations doesn't terminate\nthe claim. It just says you can't get a remedy if you\nsue too late. But there are statutes that say you have\nno claim after X time, and that would certainly be a\nrepose. You have no right anymore after that.\nMR. WALL: No question. That's certainly\ntrue. If the Court --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe -- maybe you'd better\ngo -- well, go on. I think you'd better go to the other\npoint because I want to know whether you differ from the\nPetitioner on the second point. As I understand the\nPetitioner, he does -- he does not think that you reach\nthe same result if indeed the violation had been\nnonintentional. Now, do you take that position as well?\nMR. WALL: No, Justice Scalia. I think that\nis the one place in everything Mr. Landau said where\nthere is daylight between the Petitioners' position and\nours. In the Government's view, the traditional\nequitable rule is the statute is tolled until the\nplaintiff has actual or constructive notice of the facts\nunderlying her claim. It doesn't matter whether the\nconcealment of those facts by the defendant that gives\nrise to --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But is that right, Mr. Wall?\nI mean, don't we usually look when we're thinking about\nequitable doctrines as whether the defendant has clean\nhands? You know, whether the defendant is culpable or\nnot seems to matter a good deal when we're thinking\nabout considerations of equity.\nMR. WALL: Absolutely. And I think in many\nfraud and concealment cases, where you are not talking\nabout a duty of disclosure, either common law or\nstatutorily, you do have affirmative misconduct. But\nit's a different question when Congress has come in and\ntold the defendants by law what they have to do. For\nthe defendant then to breach that statutory duty -- I\nthink Congress has already told them what they have to\ndo in this context.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But I think Mr. Landau's\npoint -- it was a strong part of his brief, I think --\nwas that there was no reason why his clients would have\nthought that they had a disclosure obligation in the\nfirst place. So, it wasn't like they were looking at\nthis disclosure obligation and saying we don't feel like\nit. They were saying we're not covered by it.\nMR. WALL: That just goes to Justice\nGinsburg's point, I think, which is that where a\nplaintiff can sufficiently plead a section 16(b) case at\nthe motion to dismiss stage to survive dismissal under\nIqbal and Twombly, everyone agrees that if you've got a\n16(b) potential violation, you've got a reporting duty\nunder 16(a). You can't have liability for a trade under\n(b) that you weren't required to report under (a).\nSo, if the plaintiff can sufficiently plead\na case at the motion to dismiss stage under 16(b), by\ndefinition the plaintiff has sufficiently pleaded that\nthe defendant violated a reporting obligation under (a).\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, no. Why is that true?\nSomebody could be a -- an insider without knowing that\nthe person was an insider.\nMR. WALL: That's right. But section 16(a),\nexcept for the criminal sanctions, is a strict liability\nprovision. If you're an insider and you fail to file,\nyou've violated 16(a). Now, you know, it's a separate\nquestion on 16(b), but the -- I think everyone here\nagrees that if you have a violation of (b), you\nnecessarily have a violation of (a). You can't be\nforced to disgorge the profits from a trade you weren't\nrequired to report.\nJUSTICE ALITO: No, I understand that, but I\nthought the point was -- I thought the question was\nwhether there is the kind of concealment that would\ninvoke equitable tolling when the concealment is not\ndone knowingly, when it is not done in -- in knowing\nbreach of a disclosure obligation.\nMR. WALL: I think the -- the breach of a\nduty, a statutory or a common law duty, especially where\nthat duty is designed to aid in the enforcement of a\nprivate right of action, is and has been considered by\ncourts to be concealment. Without looking at whether\nthe fiduciary just accidentally or inadvertently --\nJUSTICE BREYER: There are two different\ndoctrines, I gather. One is equitable -- equitable\ntolling. The other is sometimes called equitable\nestoppel or fraudulent concealment. But -- whatever you\ncall them, if you take your position, a person who\nreally thinks he doesn't have to file and so he doesn't\nfile will be liable forever. There will be no statute\nof limitations because the plaintiff will never find\nout. Maybe 50 years later. All right?\nIf you take the opposite position, then you\nwill prevent plaintiffs in borderline cases from\nbringing suits because they aren't going to find out\nthat somebody thinks it's a borderline case. I see one\nharm one way, one harm the other way. You're arguing\nthat the second harm is the worst harm. Okay, why?\nWhat's the argument?\nMR. WALL: Justice Breyer, I just -- I want\nto fight the premise --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, I'm making it for\nyou -- I'm making your argument. I'm trying to.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm saying it's something\non your side and something the other side. He's arguing\nyou're wrong because if there's no bad conduct by the\ndefendant, he honestly thinks he doesn't have to file,\nthen the statute never runs. Okay?\nMR. WALL: We have occupied the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But on the other hand, his\nposition leads to the plaintiff never being able to sue\nin borderline cases. Which is worse?\nMR. WALL: You're absolutely right. They\nare both bad. We've occupied the reasonable middle\nground. Hope you like it.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Thank you, Mr. Wall.\nThat's a nice note on which to end.\nMr. Tilden, we will hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY I. TILDEN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. TILDEN: Justice Scalia, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe underwriters' argument, and the\nGovernment's for that matter, are founded on the notion\nthat Congress wanted someone who violated 16(a) to\nreceive the benefit of the statute of limitations or\nrepose in 16(b).\n16(b) is unique in the securities law and\nperhaps in the law generally, in that the plaintiff\nsuffers no injury and recovers no damages. There is no\ntriggering event, unlike a fraud case, your stock drops,\nto suggest that you've been harmed. 16(b) is 99 percent\nof the time irrelevant without a 16(a) filing. As a\nmatter of logic, it makes no sense to provide that one\nwho violates 16(b) can escape liability because they\nalso violate 16(a).\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, what about as a matter\nof language, whether or not 16(b) is a -- whether it's a\nstatute of repose or a statute of limitations, it tells\nyou exactly when the time is supposed to begin to run,\nfrom the -- from the realization of the profit? And you\nwant to say no, it doesn't begin to run from that point;\nit begins to run from the point when some other\ncompletely different external event occurs, if it ever\ndoes occur, which is the filing of the 16(a) report.\nTextually, how do you get to that?\nMR. TILDEN: We get here -- get there this\nway, Your Honor: The Court several times recognized\nthat 16(b) and 16(a) were interrelated. The limitations\nperiod in (b) provides, in the second sentence, \"such\nprofit\" and \"no such suit for such profit.\" Well, what\nprofit and what suit are those?\nTo answer that question, we must go to the\nfirst sentence which refers to the profit of such\nbeneficial owner, director, and officer. Who are they?\nTo know that, we must go to 16(a), which is a\nsingle-sentence statutory command that directs\nbeneficial owners of more than 10 percent, directors,\nand officers to file the form provided for below. 16(b)\nis a statute of limitations for those who file the form.\nThere is no statute of limitations in 16(b)\nfor those who do not. The statute of repose contended\nfor by the underwriters here would have this unique\nfeature: It would run invisibly to all but the\ndefendant. No one else has any notice the clock is\nticking but the defendant. This has a -- an\nattractiveness if you're the defendant, but it doesn't\nwork well for the rest of us. No knowledge of a\ntriggering event and its running in the face of an\naffirmative statutory duty --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But I think you're arguing\nagainst the most extreme position. Another position is\njust, regardless whether there's been a filing, if the\nperson knew or should have known, if a reasonable person\nwould have known, even if there were no filing, that's\nenough.\nMR. TILDEN: Your Honor, the -- there are\nseveral responses to that. 16(a) we believe is the\ndiscovery rule. Congress looked at this and commanded\ninsiders to put the information in a particular location\nso that shareholders, who have the primary enforcement\nauthority under 16(b), can go find it there.\nIn the face of that congressional dictate,\ncan we graft an appendage onto the statute that says,\nnotwithstanding the fact the shareholder was told that\nhe or she could go look there and notwithstanding the\nfact that they went to look there and there was nothing\nthere, they must nonetheless go elsewhere? Congress\nsaid: Shareholder, go look behind door number 16 to see\nif the information is there.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They need not go elsewhere,\nbut when they have gone elsewhere and have found out --\nI mean, in this case, it's -- it was not just that you\nreasonably should have known; it's you did know. Isn't\n-- am I right about that?\nMR. TILDEN: No, sir, you're not right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh. Okay.\nMR. TILDEN: We alleged in the claim a -- a\nconscious agreement between the underwriters and key\ndecisionmakers at the issuer to underprice the IPO.\nThis is extraordinarily counterintuitive behavior. It\nis not listed, mentioned at all in the IPO filing in\n'02. Judge Scheindlin's opinion in '03 nowhere refers\nto \"group,\" \"agreement,\" \"contract,\" \"conspiracy.\"\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, that was the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is that necessary to your\ncause of action?\nMR. TILDEN: A group plainly is. A group\nis. It's a footnote, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But tell me what was\nhidden from you in the prior filings in the academic\nliterature that your adversary points to? All of the\nfacts you've just recited have been written about\nextensively for years and years. So, what new\ninformation that you received told you that you should\nfile a lawsuit?\nMR. TILDEN: Your Honor, I disagree with the\npremise, but let me work backwards. First, if you -- if\nwe were to apply a vanilla form discovery rule like\nMerck, knowledge of the particular facts of the\ntransaction, to this day no one has knowledge of the\npurchase and sales within six months and the profits.\nThose are elements of a 16 -- I'm sorry -- a 16(b)\nclaim. We lack knowledge.\nTwo, whatever it is a reasonable shareholder\nought to do to trigger a Merck-like plain vanilla\ndiscovery rule, we have gone far beyond that. We cannot\nimpose on a shareholder the obligation to read the\nJournal of Financial Management or to follow a Harvard\nsymposium. Three -- and this --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You mean to tell me that\nsomebody's investing in the amounts that are invested\nhere and they're not following the fact that this has\nbeen the center of securities litigation for years?\nMR. TILDEN: Your Honor, this is a -- not a\ngarden-variety 16(b) violation. I agree with you\ncompletely regarding our level of involvement, but I do\nnot believe we present a standard 16(b) claim.\nBut to answer directly your question, the\ngroup allegation that underwriters and key\ndecisionmakers of the issuer conspired together is not\nin the IPO -- in the IPO case. The allegation there was\nthis: That the underwriters were getting unrevealed\ncompensation that should have been disclosed. Should\nhave been disclosed and was not. Underwriter\ncompensation. And the allegation against the insiders\nwas that they knowingly or recklessly signed the\nprospectus. It's at page, I believe, 310 of Judge\nScheindlin's opinion.\nSo, that is all that is alleged there.\nThere is no group activity, no notion that this acted in\nconcert -- or that they were acting in concert. The\nnotion that someone would deliberately underprice their\nIPO first appeared in the scholarly research at a Spring\nof '09 Harvard symposium a year and a half after we\nfiled our claim.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you answer what I\nconsider a very strong argument on their side, which is\nCongress, who creates a statute of repose for\nintentional conduct like fraud, why would they not\ncreate a statute of repose for what is a strict\nliability statute?\nMR. TILDEN: The fraud case is all about --\ninvolve, Your Honor, someone who has reason to know that\nthey've been defrauded. It may only be that they bought\ntheir stock at X, and now it's selling for half of X,\nbut they know something has happened. There is no\nequivalent here. The 16(b) plaintiff has suffered no\ninjury. It's critical to an understanding of what the\nCongress contemplated at the time.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: One would think, if the\n16(b) plaintiff has really suffered no injury, it would\nbe all the more likely that Congress would want a\nstatute of repose.\nMR. TILDEN: I don't believe, Your Honor --\nthe 1934 legislative history made it clear -- makes it\nclear that Congress was extraordinarily concerned about\na broad sweep of misconduct in the '20s. They intended\na rule that in this Court's language in Reliance\nElectric would be flat, sweeping, and arbitrary. They\nintended to squeeze every penny of profit out of these\ntransactions, and they did so in 16(b).\nThis is not a trap for the unwary. Congress\nhas said you cannot be unwary. If you are an insider,\nyou must be wary. You must be wary. That's what\nCongress has said.\nIf we are concerned about how this might\nwork going forward -- and the underwriter has raised a\nparade of horribles: Oh, this is what will happen if\nthe Court adopts our position. One thing we might do if\nwe want to know what will occur in the next 64 or\n77 years is look backwards at the last 64 or 77 years.\nThe Whittaker rule has been the rule in most of the\nUnited States for virtually the entirety of the last\n77 years.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's worked out, but I\ndon't understand it. I mean, why not just treat it like\na special -- regular statute of limitations? You say\nthat the profit is made on day one. It was made by an\ninsider, and if your client finds out about it or\nreasonably should have found out about it, then the\nstatute begins to run.\nMR. TILDEN: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Otherwise it's tolled,\nperiod. Simple, same as every other statute. What's\nwrong with that?\nMR. TILDEN: Well, we don't believe the\ncongressional design contemplated tolling. Congress\ntold shareholders we could go look in a particular\nplace. But here's one other problem with it.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But there are people, you\nsee, who don't know. There are always borderline cases.\nSome people, whether it's this one or not, think maybe\nthey don't have to file. They think they're outside the\nstatute. So, they don't. Okay?\nYou are protected. If they don't file, and\nyou wouldn't reasonably find out about it, fine. But\nwhen you find out about it or should have, not fine.\nIt's very simple and makes everything logical. It seems\nto be fair to your client, certainly.\nMR. TILDEN: It may be simple and fair, Your\nHonor. We -- we don't believe it's what the language of\nthe statute provides for. It also suffers from this\nadditional defect: Under the statute in this Court's\nopinion in Gollust v. Mendell, the standing requirement\nfor 16(b) is that you own shares at the time of\ninstitution of the action. This can be years subsequent\nto the events themselves.\nCan we adopt a statute of limitation, a\ndiscovery rule that runs against someone who has not yet\nacquired standing under Gollust? I wonder if we can.\nIt seems to me to defeat the special standing that\nCongress intended 16(b) shareholders to have. You\nacquire standing on day 700 when you purchase your\nshares, only to find that you have no claim because you\nwere having imputed to you something that a shareholder,\nwhich you were not, knew or should have known 3 years\nearlier. Could that be --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. -- Mr. Tilden, is there\nany other context in which we would extend the\nstatute -- or we have extended or any court has extended\na statute of limitations without requiring that the\nplaintiff be reasonably diligent? Can you point to any\nother example of that?\nMR. TILDEN: I -- I cannot, Your Honor, but\nI can also not point to a statute of limitations such as\nthis one that follows immediately on an affirmative\ndisclosure obligation imposed on the defendant.\nTo answer a question Justice Alito raised in\nresponse to one of my colleagues, I believe the best\nanalysis of the difference between a statute of\nlimitations and a statute of repose by this Court\nrecently is in the Beach v. Ocwen opinion. And in\nBeach, the Court analyzed the Truth in Lending Act and\nconcluded the language that said 3 years after the\ntransaction the right of rescission shall cease, was a\nstatute of repose. It was completely clear. It did not\nrely on a discovery rule incorporated therein; it did\nnot require a -- did not rely on a second prong. Beach\ncites the -- a prominent Harvard Law Review article at\n63 Harvard Law Review, and is a wonderful analysis of\nthis Court's work on this subject.\nA kernel of the motivation in the\nunderwriters' briefing is the notion that liability\nunder 16(b) is draconian, that there's -- that it's\nharsh. It's important to note that all you have to do\nunder 16(b) is give back profit that never belonged to\nyou. In the words of the statute, it inured to the\ncorporation; you weren't entitled to it. It's as if the\npenalty for bank robbery were that you merely had to\ngive the money back. No attorneys' fees. You don't\nhave to return your principal, you just give the money\nback.\nFinally, I'd like to address a difference\nbetween the Whittaker decision and the Litzler decision,\nbriefly. Both of these courts found that 16(b) only\nworked by virtue of 16(a). In Whittaker, the Ninth\nCircuit said only by full compliance with 16(a) do your\n16(b) rights mean anything. And in Litzler, the Second\nCircuit said 16(b) only works because of the absolute\nduty of disclosure placed on the defendant. We agree\nwith that. We disagree with my buddy, Mr. Landau.\nMost trading today occurs electronically in\nthe dark of night; it is invisible to everyone else.\nBut if the Court gets to the position where it is\ndebating whether Whittaker or Litzler ought to be the\nrule --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Or the SG's.\nMR. TILDEN: -- or the SG's, we'd offer\nthis: There is no reported decision in which Whittaker\nand Litzler will yield different results in our view.\nWhittaker is a bright-line rule of the kind Congress\nintended. Litzler is a rule that in its own words\nrequires conceivably discovery and trial.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And it requires actual -- is\nthat right? It requires actual knowledge on the part of\nthe plaintiff?\nMR. TILDEN: Yes, sir.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Does that make any sense,\ngiven the -- the class of individuals who are plaintiffs\nin 16(b) cases?\nMR. TILDEN: We don't --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Somebody who -- who is found\nfor purposes of litigation very often to have purchased\nhis stock long after all of this takes place. So, the\nlawyer who wants to bring this suit can just go out and\nfind somebody who knows nothing? Isn't that right?\nMR. TILDEN: The -- there's much I want to\nsay in response to that. The underwriters contended in\nthe lower courts for a subjective rule. No party before\nthis Court contends for a subjective rule. We do not\nbelieve that -- Whittaker is not a subjective rule, and\nI do not believe that Judge Jacobs in Litzler was\narguing for a subjective rule.\nWhat he envisioned -- he -- the judge had a\nfair concern in the abstract. He said, look, if they\ndon't file the form but the identical information is\navailable to all the world everywhere else, what's wrong\nwith that? Well, there's nothing wrong with it, except\nthat it's never available to all the world anywhere\nelse. No other securities filings reveal this.\nCongress told us to go look in one place, and not\nanywhere else.\nBut the Litzler court I don't think\nenvisioned an actual notice rule. When it said\ninformation as clear as 2 plus 2, I believe it was\nseeking an objective rule, Whittaker-like, looking for\nWhittaker-equivalent information. We don't believe such\na thing exists. That said, the Litzler rule requires\ndiscovery in trial.\nIf the rules don't achieve different\nresults, then we have the choice between applying a rule\nthat is just, speedy, and efficient -- Whittaker -- and\na rule that is just, slow, and costly -- Litzler. Some\nversion of Occam's Razor, if nothing else, ought to\nsupport the application of the Whittaker rule and not\nthe Litzler rule, should the Court find itself in that\nposition.\nHere's the last thing I'd say, and then I\nwill be quiet. Today is the first time this Court has\nanalyzed the issue before it, but it's come up\nrepeatedly in the lower courts over the last 77 years,\nand with one exception, 1954, in the Middle District of\nPennsylvania, the courts have unanimously rejected the\npetition -- the position contended for by both the\nunderwriters here and the Government. The rule has been\nWhittaker or a Litzler variant of it everywhere, all the\ntime.\nIn 1934, the purchase or sale of a share of\nstock required the actual knowledge of some other\npeople. Today it is an impersonal electronic\ntransaction, often at home in the middle of the night,\ninvisible to everyone. Insider trading was hard enough\nto uncover then; it's gotten harder now. We do not\nbelieve that Congress envisioned any additional burden\nwould be placed on a shareholder by forcing them to\nlearn this undetectable conduct within 2 years.\nThe most, in our view, famous pronouncement\nby this Court with respect to the interpretation of\n16(b) is out of the Reliance Electric opinion in 1962.\nIn Reliance, the Court said, faced with a question, two\ncompeting interpretations of the statute, the Court\nshould -- should select that interpretation that best\nserves the congressional purpose of curbing short-swing\nspeculation by insiders.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The -- the problem I have\nwith your argument is it's a very strange statute of\nlimitations. Accepting that it is not a statute of\nrepose, it says, you know, you have 2 years after the --\nthe transaction that was failed to be reported.\nAnd you want to say what it means is you\nhave 2 years from the time it was reported. Congress\nwould have said that. It's so easy to say that. Two\nyears from the reporting.\nMR. TILDEN: I grant you it could have been\nsaid otherwise, Your Honor, but we --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But I don't know any other\nstatute of limitations that achieves the result that you\nwant that puts it that way.\nMR. TILDEN: Every other statute of\nlimitations we can think of, Your Honor, involves a\nplaintiff who has reason to know of some harm and,\nincidentally, recovers damages. The 16(b) plaintiff has\nno reason to know of harm and recovers no damages.\nRight?\nIf I -- let's take a case that's seen every\nday and every month, probably in every State in the\ncountry. A lawnmower accident and a child or a teenager\nloses a toe. You may not know anything about lawnmower\ndesign. You may not know anything about your State's\nproduct liability act or ANSI standards or the litany of\nduty breach, causation, and damages, but you do know\nthat you used to have ten toes and now you have nine.\nThere is no equivalent. The 16(b) plaintiff\ndoes not know insider trading has occurred and won't\nknow unless he or she is told. They do not know if\nsomeone else somewhere has nine toes. As far as they\nknow, everybody still has all of their toes.\nNo other statute of limitations will serve\nas an analogue here because of the unique character of\n16(b). The plaintiff has no injury and recovers no\ndamages. We don't believe we can fairly look at other\nstatutes of limitation as a model, given that\ndistinction.\nThe Reliance Electric court concluded if --\nif you have a choice, you should select that\ninterpretation that best serves the goal of curbing\nshort-swing trading by insiders.\nWe believe the -- the case before the Court\ncan and should be determined based on the wording of\n16(b) itself. The limitations period in (b) applies to\nthose who file the form in (a). But if the Court\nbelieves that the textual analysis is less clear than we\nthink, the Ninth Circuit should be affirmed based on the\ninterpretive principles of Reliance Electric,\nnonetheless.\nIf there are no other questions, I'll sit\ndown.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Thank you, Mr. Tilden.\nMr. Landau, you have 4 minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER LANDAU\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. LANDAU: Thank you, Your Honor. Very\nbriefly, just on repose, two quick points.\nIf there's any one theme that runs through\nthis Court's 16(b) jurisprudence, it's that precisely\nbecause the -- section 16(b) is prophylactic, it should\nbe interpreted in a literal and mechanical way. I think\nthe -- that argues for repose, because you don't get\ninto a lot of these questions about who knew what when.\nAnd so, that certainly would be consistent with -- this\ncase would fit well within that -- that tradition, if\nyou were to go that way.\nIn addition on repose, let's not forget that\nCongress gave 2 years after the date the profits were\nrealized. If those profits were in a report, you\nwouldn't need the whole 2 years, anyway. In fact, for\nthe fraud provision, you only get 1 year after you\ndiscover it. So, in a sense, I think that helps show\nthat even in a repose approach, 2 years is plenty of\ntime.\nThen -- but assuming that you go with\nequitable tolling, I think -- I'd like to emphasize that\nthere's really four approaches that have been brought\nforth. There's the Ninth Circuit's rigid approach that\nit's -- they call it equitable tolling, but there's\nreally nothing equitable about it. It's -- it's we\ndon't care about who knew what, when, or anything. It\nis you have to file the 16(a).\nThe district court actually struggled\nbecause the district court in this case said I'm\nsupposed to be doing something called equitable tolling,\nand there's nothing equitable here at all, because I\nthink everything here was plainly known to the -- to the\nplaintiffs or should have been known.\nThen you have the Litzler approach, which\nlooks to actual knowledge. And I think, as some of the\nquestioning brought out, there is no background rule\nthat distinguishes between actual knowledge and\nconstructive knowledge for purposes of equitable\ntolling.\nAgain, I think as some of the questions\nbrought out, equitable tolling, because it's an\nequitable doctrine, looks to has the defendant behaved\nequitably and has the plaintiff behaved equitably?\nAnd we agree with the Government that\ndiligence -- in other words, would a reasonable\nshareholder -- did a shareholder know or would a\nreasonable shareholder should have known -- is a\ncritical part of the inquiry that's missing in -- in the\nNinth Circuit's analysis.\nWhere we disagree with the Government is\nwith respect to their -- their view of fraudulent\nconcealment to involve any violation -- any alleged\nviolation of a statutory 16(a) duty. Under the\nGovernment's view, it would be considered fraudulent\nconcealment and would -- would give rise to tolling if\nsomebody were to come in today and say, gee, the\nMicrosoft IPO back in 1986, there was actually a group\nin there, the underwriters conspired. And -- you know,\nthe thing is the difference between this case and that\none is this case happens to have involved this hugely\nprominent IPO litigation that really brought all these\nthings to light, but the -- the defendant in that\nMicrosoft hypothetical would not have the advantage of\nbeing able to point to the defendant's -- to the\nplaintiffs' lack of diligence, saying this is all out\nthere.\nSo, you'd be creating a regime, if you go\nwith the Government's approach, that really waters down\nthe defendant's culpability on the fraudulent\nconcealment side of equitable tolling. Essentially,\nthey're asking you to take the fraud out of fraudulent\nconcealment.\nThe only last point I'd like to make is\nthat, with respect to the specific facts here again,\ncounsel said today that this was not known until a\nHarvard symposium in 2009. I would urge you, again, to\nlook at their briefing below. Their -- docket 58 in the\ndistrict court responds to our motion to dismiss by\nciting a 2004 article that they actually included in the\njoint appendix. You can look at joint appendix 80 to\n83. Their theory of underwriter conspiracy with issuer\ninsiders is set forth right there on those pages of that\n2004 article, well before the 2 years.\nAnd, again, in addition, the 2000 -- their\ncomplaint, which talks about lock-up, you can look\nspecifically at joint appendix 59 to 61 to see how\nlock-up was alleged to be a critical part of their\nunderlying theory.\nFinally, it is not true, again, that the IPO\nlitigation was only about underwriters. There were\nindividual issuer defendants at issue in the IPO\nlitigation. And, in fact, Judge Scheindlin's opinion\ngoes into some detail about the -- the alleged\nconspiracy that they're saying -- the alleged group that\nthey're saying they couldn't have found out.\nIn fact, she says -- this is -- pages 356\nand 358 of the Judge Scheindlin opinion will provide\nquotations that show that their theory was very well\nknown. Thank you.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Thank you, Mr. Landau.\n"
