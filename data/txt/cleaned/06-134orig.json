        "content": "(11:05 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in case 134 on our original docket, New Jersey v.\nDelaware.\nMr. Farr.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF H. BARTOW FARR\nON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF\nMR. FARR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nAlthough the 1905 Compact between Delaware\nand New Jersey did not settle the boundary dispute\nbetween them, New Jersey nevertheless agreed to dismiss\nthe suit that it had filed before this Court to\ndetermine the boundary. And the reason for those two\nseemingly contradictory facts, I think, is because the\nCompact did resolve permanently certain issues of\njurisdiction, implementing rules that could be\nadministered without regard to where the boundary was.\nThus in particular Article VII, the\nprovision of the Compact that's particularly at issue in\nthis case, provided that each State could continue to\nexercise its traditional riparian authority over the\nriparian owners on its side of the river according to\nits laws. Now, the Special Master I think fundamentally\nchanged the nature of the Compact by superimposing the\nboundary line into the terms of an agreement that was\nmeant to operate without it. And I think he did so\nbecause he mistakenly applied the presumption that all\npromises with respect to jurisdiction and territory must\nbe unmistakable; and this Court, however, had said\nseveral years before, in Virginia versus Maryland, that\nthat presumption simply is not applicable to compacts\nthat are entered into when the boundaries between the\nStates are disputed.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Farr, one of the\nstriking things about this Compact is that to the extent\nthat it is definite, there is a lot in here in detail\nabout service arrests on the river and about fishing,\nbut then you get to these two articles at the end and\nthey certainly don't have that same definite detailed\nquality. As I read the Article VII that you're\nstressing, it says -- let's see -- \"may continue to\nexercise.\" So it seems to me that \"may continue to\" was\njust whatever was the status quo, that will continue;\nnot to do anything dispositive, just whatever was will\ncontinue.\nMR. FARR: Well, several things about that,\nJustice Ginsburg. First of all I think that the\nlanguage \"continue to\" necessarily brings in the\nhistorical antecedents of regulation of riparian matters\nby both States. It's undisputed in this case that on\nNew Jersey's side of the river, that is with respect to\nriparian owners on the New Jersey side, New Jersey had\nexercised full and exclusive authority over, for\nexample, wharfing out to navigable water, the building\nof piers and wharfs to do that, the granting of lands,\nwithout any involvement whatsoever by Delaware.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Was it clear that New\nJersey believed when it had authorized somebody to wharf\nout, that the person who wharfed out was not subject to\nNew Jersey's environmental laws?\nMR. FARR: No. I think what --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The history doesn't show\nanything about that?\nMR. FARR: The history doesn't show\nanything --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So if --\nMR. FARR: -- specific about that kind of\nlaw.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- if it -- if it would\nhave been subject to New Jersey's environmental laws,\nhad New Jersey owned the bed of the river into which the\nwharf was extended, by parity of reasoning it seems to\nme the wharf would be subject to Delaware's\nenvironmental laws if Delaware owns the bed of the\nriver.\nMR. FARR: I think without the Compact that\nwould be true, but I think what the Compact is saying is\nthat you get to retain the degree of power on your own\nside of the river that you had before, without regard\nultimately to where the boundary is determined to be.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So your -- your argument --\nit seems to me it's not that easy, because your argument\nis assuming that by virtue of the \"may continue\"\nlanguage, the State of New Jersey acquires a new power,\nand the new power in effect is to -- is to make grants\nof subaqueous land that belonged not to New Jersey but\nto Delaware, and that's the stretch.\nIt -- it seems to me that that is such an\nextraordinary position or proposition, that you've got\nto have something more specific than \"may continue\" in\norder to construe that as meaning an agreement which was\nintended to give New Jersey the power to grant away\nDelaware land.\nMR. FARR: Well, Justice Souter, I think\nthat the difficulty with that question is it assumes\nknowledge of where the boundary is. In other words,\nwhen one talks about New Jersey getting a new power to\ngrant lands that are within Delaware, that is a -- that\nis a question that necessarily assumes that the boundary\nhas to be part of that understanding.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, I'm simply saying that\nyour position -- and I accept your position -- that the\nCompact is intended to continue to operate whether or\nnot the boundary is -- is ultimately determined, and if\nso, after it is ultimately determined -- and once we get\nto that point of continuing to operate after, then\nnecessarily the only way it can operate on your theory\nis to give New Jersey the power to grant Delaware land.\nAnd if New Jersey has that power, it must have been a\npower that was intended in the 1905 Compact, and that\nintent strikes me as a very extraordinary intent; and --\nand my -- the point of my question was the application\nof the Compact in the new circumstances, as you claim it\nto be, would be so extraordinary that you ought to have\nlanguage more specific than \"may continue\" in order to\nestablish that extraordinary result.\nMR. FARR: Well, of course. It is -- it is\nsaying \"may continue to grant riparian rights and lands\nunder its laws.\" So it is not simply the language \"may\ncontinue.\"\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, if you emphasize\n\"under its laws,\" then don't you lose? Because New\nJersey does not -- I presume New Jersey does not have\nlaw, for example, in its constitution, providing that it\ncan grant Delaware land.\nMR. FARR: Well, I don't think that the laws\nhave to refer specifically, obviously, to granting\nDelaware land. It did have provision for granting laws\nbeyond the low-water mark in New Jersey. Many of the\ngrants before 1905 specifically --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But I'm going on the\nassumption that it, in fact, had jurisdiction; that it\nhad land below -- beyond the low-water mark.\nMR. FARR: But what I think you're\nsuggesting, Justice Souter, I think, is what -- what\nfundamentally alters the nature of the Compact is to\nassume that New Jersey had certain powers up until the\ntime the boundary line was determined, and then it lost\nthose powers after the boundary line was --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It didn't so much lose -- I\nmean it had a generalized recognition of power. In\norder to exercise that power, it had to possess certain\nattributes, i.e., land.\nOnce it lost that land, it had nothing to\nexercise the power over. In fact, it had a little bit\nleft. It had the distance between the high- and the\nlow-water marks, so it still had the power. But the --\nthe recognition of the power in 1905 was, in effect, a\nformula; and the formula depends on facts to be applied;\nand the facts changed once the boundary was determined.\nMR. FARR: You see, I think there are two\nproblems with that, Justice Souter.\nFirst of all, the very notion that there\nwould be something left if the boundary line was\ndetermined to be at the low-water mark on the New Jersey\nside -- in other words, that Article 7 would continue to\noperate; it would just operate subject to the boundary\n-- at least in the context of the riparian right that we\nare talking about, the right to wharf out to navigable\nwater, that right is essentially meaningless if you stop\nat the low-water mark.\nIn other words, what you're saying and what\nthe Special Master's recommendation essentially does, it\nsays New Jersey has no right to authorize wharfing out\nto navigable water without Delaware's consent.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What right do you think --\nMR. FARR: I --\nJUSTICE ALITO: What right do you think New\nJersey has now with respect to the subaqueous land? Is\nit simply to authorize it to be disturbed to the extent\nnecessary to construct a wharf, or does it go any\nfurther than that?\nMR. FARR: Basically, I think what you have\nsaid, Justice Alito, is exactly right. It is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I have a more basic\nquestion. Assume -- assuming that the subaqueous land\nbelongs to New Jersey and that New Jersey gives a\nprivate individual a right to wharf out into the\nDelaware, does that individual acquire ownership of the\nland under the water, assuming New Jersey owns the\nsubaqueous land?\nMR. FARR: It depends on the form of the\ngrant, but, typically, if New Jersey --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But, normally, authority to\nwharf out doesn't convey the land with it; does it?\nMR. FARR: It conveys an interest in the\nland that allows the doing of the activity --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of the wharf.\nMR. FARR: -- for which the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of the wharf.\nMR. FARR: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Now, if -- if merely\nauthority to wharf out would not even convey New\nJersey's own land, how can you argue that, by reason of\nthis Compact, it implicitly conveyed what is now\nDelaware's land?\nMR. FARR: Well, because Delaware has\nessentially said in Article VII, we believe, Justice\nScalia, that New Jersey may continue to do this. It was\ndoing -- I mean this land --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: May continue to wharf out,\nbut not continue to grant subaqueous land, which you say\ndoesn't go with wharfing out.\nMR. FARR: Well, what we are -- what we're\ntalking about, I think, is we're talking about granting\nthe interest in land that is necessary for the riparian\nowner to be able to wharf out.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that if you have\none of these wharves that goes beyond the low-water mark\nand there are two people at the end of it and one of\nthem shoots the other, would they be prosecuted for\nmurder in Delaware or New Jersey?\nMR. FARR: Well, in -- in -- there was a\ngambling offense at the end of a pier in -- in -- that\nproceeded from the New Jersey shoreline, in 19 -- in the\nlate 1950's in a case called the Federenco case, which I\ndon't have the cite for immediately. The New Jersey\nSupreme Court held that that was within the jurisdiction\nof New Jersey, and Delaware filed a --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suspect the New\nJersey Supreme Court would.\nMR. FARR: Delaware filed a brief, Mr. Chief\nJustice, supporting that position.\nSo -- but if I could return just for a\nsecond to Justice Souter's point and Justice Scalia's\npoint, if one thinks for a moment -- we're -- we're\ntrying to, I think, interpret the -- the 1905 Compact as\nit must have been understood by the commissioners who\ndrafted it.\nAnd so I think that, unlike the Special\nMaster, who at the time he's interpreting it, knows\nwhere the boundary line is, we have to think about,\nfirst of all, would the commissioners essentially have\nbeen saying to New Jersey, as your hypothesis would\nsuggest, that each State on its own side of the river\nhas the right to grant riparian rights and lands and\nexercise riparian jurisdiction subject to the boundary\nline, which for New Jersey would mean that, in fact, if\nit lost the boundary case, it would effectively have no\nriparian jurisdiction at all?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Farr, what about the\narticle that follows Article VII? Article VIII says:\n\"Nothing herein contained shall affect the territorial\nlimits, rights, or jurisdiction of either State in or\nover the Delaware River.\" So that's a qualification at\nleast on every other article.\nMR. FARR: Well, Justice Ginsburg, if I may\nsay, the quote is longer than that and in a critically\nimportant way. It says it may not do that \"except as\nherein expressly set forth.\"\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, and I don't see\nanything expressly set forth in VII, which just says\n\"may continue to,\" which says the status quo is\nmaintained.\nMR. FARR: Well, I mean, obviously, we're --\nwe're debating the meaning of Article VII, but it seems\nto me that Article VII is an express provision herein,\nmeaning in the Compact. So that what Article VII is\naiming at, it seems to me, if we are correct that it is\nessentially meant to operate without respect to the\nboundary, would expressly set forth a cession.\nAnd I might point out that when this case\nwas before this Court or the two States were before this\nCourt back in 1934, Delaware's counsel before this Court\nsaid pretty much exactly what I'm saying this morning:\nthat -- and this is on page 44 of our blue brief, but\nsaid that the Compact of 1905 in his view ceded to the\nState of New Jersey all the right to control the\nerection of those wharves, meaning wharves that were\nconstructed by New Jersey riparian owners past the\nlow-water mark, and to say who shall erect them.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, are you asking us to\nreject the concept of concurrent jurisdiction in all\ncircumstances?\nMR. FARR: As far as State jurisdiction\ngoes, it seems to me there is not concurrent\njurisdiction over riparian structures such as piers and\nwharves and other kinds of acknowledged riparian rights.\nWith respect to matters that are nonriparian, for\nexample, if a riparian owner in New Jersey wanted to\nconstruct a hotel that was beyond the low-water mark,\nthat would not be a riparian use. And Delaware --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How do we split that\ndifference? I mean let's --\nMR. FARR: Pardon me?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, how do we\ndecide the difference between those two cases? And\napplicable here, for example, let's say it's perfectly\nfine for New Jersey to build a wharf out there, but they\ncan't use it for liquified natural gas, which Delaware\nmay conclude poses particular problems that other uses\ndon't.\nMR. FARR: But I think what you've done, Mr.\nChief Justice, if I may, is I think you've detached the\npurpose of a wharf from the wharf itself. The purpose\nof a wharf is the loading and unloading of goods.\nThat's what -- what they are used for. Vessels draw up,\ntie up and unload or load goods and/or passengers.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Could New Jersey -- could\nNew Jersey prevent its use for liquified gas?\nMR. FARR: Under State law, yes, it could,\nYour Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well -- but New Jersey had\ngiven this riparian owner the right to wharf out.\nMR. FARR: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, obviously, the right to\nwharf out does not include the right to use the wharf\nfor whatever you like, and the only thing we're arguing\nabout is whether it is New Jersey or Delaware that can\nimpose limitations. But that it is subject to\nlimitation is, it seems to me, absolutely clear.\nMR. FARR: I agree with that. There's no\nquestion that it is subject to limitation. The question\nis, whose laws apply? Who -- and it seems to me that is\nthe question that Article VII expressly answered.\nArticle VII again says \"each State on its own side of\nthe river\" -- which is not a designation that is limited\nby the boundary, because Delaware made that argument to\nthe Special Master, the Special Master rejected it, and\nDelaware did not file exceptions in this Court. So \"on\nits own side of the river\" I think is properly taken to\nmean with respect to the riparian owners on its bank of\nthe river. Those riparian owners -- I mean, excuse me\n-- \"each State may continue on its own side of the river\nto exercise riparian jurisdiction of every kind and\nnature, make grants of riparian rights and land under\nthe respective laws of the States.\"\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And in your view to what\nextent does this involve subaqueous lands toward -- and\nI'll just put \"toward\" -- the New Jersey side?\nMR. FARR: Unfortunately, I'm not sure I\nunderstand the phrase \"toward the New Jersey side.\" I\nmean, between the low-water mark --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm not sure I understand\nyour position on where New Jersey's jurisdiction begins\nand ends with reference to subaqueous lands.\nMR. FARR: Well, it's -- literal ownership\nof the land begins at the high-water mark on the New\nJersey side and ends at the low-water mark on the New\nJersey side, its actual ownership. Under the Compact,\nwe believe Delaware has ceded to it the right to grant\ncertain interests in subaqueous land to the extent but\nonly to the extent that they are necessary to allow\nowners in New Jersey, riparian owners, to exercise\nriparian rights, provided that the New Jersey State law\ngrants them that right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That suggests --\nMR. FARR: If they were --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- it's still an\nextraordinary power for one State to give up. If\nDelaware -- if that land -- they didn't settle the\nboundary, but it might be on the Delaware side. If\nDelaware was giving up so much, what did it get in\nexchange?\nMR. FARR: Well, again, the question that\nyou're asking assumes that the negotiators were coming\ninto the negotiation with their boundary positions fixed\nand that they were essentially horse-trading within the\nbounds of the different positions taken by the two\nStates.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: No, I'm not assuming\nthat. I'm assuming it's unknown, but there is the\npossibility that it's going to end up --\nMR. FARR: There's the possibility that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- end up --\nMR. FARR: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There's a possibility\nthat it will end up on the Delaware side. And you're\nsuggesting that Delaware relinquished all of its\nregulatory authority and gave it to New Jersey, no\nmatter where the boundary turned out to be.\nMR. FARR: That is what I'm suggesting with\nrespect to this narrow category of riparian rights.\nJust as that's true, for example, in Article I. New\nJersey has the right to serve criminal process with\nrespect, for example, to crimes that occur on the\neastern half of the river, which is something that New\nJersey clearly would not have had if it ultimately lost\nthe boundary dispute; whereas Delaware got, in Article\nII, the authority to serve process for crimes occurring\non the western half of the river, which it would have\nhad anyway, whether it won or lost the boundary dispute,\nassuming that the half of the river refers to the\nchannel. So I mean -- let me --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's -- Article I --\nthat's an exception. And you don't have the benefit of\nthat exception when you're talking about Article VII.\nMR. FARR: The exception --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The exception is not that\nspecific as to the -- as to the extent of the\njurisdiction.\nMR. FARR: Well, Justice Kennedy, I think\nyou've asked a very good question, but -- but I guess I\nthink it is -- it's quite specific, because the question\nis, what do the terms \"on its own side of the river\"\nmean? Those obviously have some geographical impact\nhere, and indeed in -- before the Special Master,\nDelaware's position was yes, that is a geographical\ndesignation, but what it means is \"up to the boundary\nline.\" In other words, up to the low-water mark. AS I\nsay, the Special Master rejected that position.\nDelaware did not file exceptions from that position. So\nI think we can accept at this point in the case that's\nnot what \"on its own side of the river\" means. So\nthe question then is: What does it mean? And it seems\nto me what it means is, with respect to the riparian\nproperty owned by New Jersey citizens on the New Jersey\nside of the river, Delaware citizens on the Delaware\nside of the river. And what it is therefore doing is\nsaying each State may control and determine the rights\nof its citizens who own riparian property --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Farr, is there --\nMR. FARR: -- regardless of where --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Is there a limit on New\nJersey's rights? As long as it's building a wharf, can\nit do anything it wants to on that or is there -- for\nexample, could it dam up the navigable part of the river\nin order to build a superstructure on the wharf?\nMR. FARR: Well, there are two questions\nthere, Justice Stevens, if I can separate them for a\nmoment. As far as State law goes, purely State law, I\nthink the answer to that question is that New Jersey\ndetermines what can and cannot be done --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, then I should --\nMR. FARR: -- on a wharf.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I should rephrase it. To\nwhat extent, if any, does Delaware place a limit on the\nway in which New Jersey may exercise its riparian\nrights?\nMR. FARR: Under State -- by applying\nDelaware State law, I think it cannot impose any limits.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Any limit whatsoever?\nMR. FARR: With respect to the exercise of\nriparian rights. Because once it --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Even if -- even if the\nbuilding of the wharf interfered with the navigation on\nthe river?\nMR. FARR: Well, this is, I think, why I was\ntrying to separate it into two parts. What I've left\nout, the part I've left out so far, is Federal law.\nFederal law has a significant amount to say about what\nhappens with respect to piers and wharves --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, I'm just asking, is\nit --\nMR. FARR: -- in any State.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- does Delaware law place\nany limit on what New Jersey may do in exercising its\nriparian rights?\nMR. FARR: I mean, it does impose a limit,\nbut we don't think those limits are valid under Article\nVII of the Compact. I think the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I mean, can they validly\nimpose a limit?\nMR. FARR: No, no, they cannot. They --\nwhat this does is it says, for New Jersey riparian\nowners, when they are building wharves and piers, they\nare subject to the laws of New Jersey. \"The respective\nStates\" means that the laws of one State or the laws of\nthe other State, depending on which side of the river\nyou're on. So they are subject to New Jersey law. Now,\nobviously, any pier or wharf that interfered with\nnavigation interferes with the Federal navigational\nservitude. So that would be subject to review under\nFederal law.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And what about the example\nof using a -- setting a gambling casino or something at\nthe end of the wharf, well into Delaware territory?\nYou'd say Delaware has no right to object to that.\nMR. FARR: No, I would say it does have a\nright there because that is not a --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That's not a riparian use.\nMR. FARR: That's not a riparian use. We're\ntalking about --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Anything involving loading\nand unloading of ships and so forth would be\npermissible?\nMR. FARR: Exactly.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Then how come your\nposition in my murder hypothetical was what it was?\nBecause I assume murder is not a riparian use either.\nAnd yet, why would Delaware have jurisdiction over a\ncasino but not over a crime?\nMR. FARR: Because I think we're talking\nabout now what happens with respect -- I mean, if we're\ntalking -- this was a gambling -- it wasn't a casino.\nThis was a gambling offense that took place on a\nfacility that actually was used for the loading and\nunloading of ships. The gambling was an outside\nactivity not relating to the use of the wharf. So I\nthink the understanding was that riparian jurisdiction\nof every kind and nature would be sufficient to say,\nonce you have built the wharf and it is a legitimate\nriparian purpose not subject to Delaware laws, then New\nJersey would apply its criminal laws as well. And as I\nsay, Delaware filed an amicus brief -- unfortunately, we\ndon't have a copy of it in the record -- but the New\nJersey Supreme Court noted that Delaware supported New\nJersey's jurisdiction over that gambling offense.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Farr, could you tell me\n-- one thing in Article VII perplexes me. Why does it\nsay that each State may \"make grants, leases, and\nconveyances of riparian lands and rights\"? \"Rights\" I\ncan understand. But why would they say \"conveyances of\nriparian lands\"?\nMR. FARR: I assume --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, obviously each\nState can -- riparian lands are within each State.\nNobody questioned that at the time.\nMR. FARR: Well, I think the fact is that\nthis is why one needs to give some sort of practical --\ntake a practical view of what Article VII is talking\nabout. Article VII -- the two riparian rights that are\nof particular interest and were established clearly in\n1905, obviously subject to the State limitations, were,\nfirst of all, the right to draw water, the riparian\nright that was at issue in Virginia v. Maryland, where\nthe Court said Maryland can't apply its police power, I\nmight point out. The second was piers and wharves.\nObviously, a pier and a wharf that stops at the\nlow-water mark is of no use at all. It's got to get out\nto the navigable water. That's where the ships are.\nIt's the Willie Sutton principle. So once have you\nthat, if you're going to have riparian rights, you've\ngot to have the ability to grant some interest in lands\nso that they can exercise their right out to the point\nwhere it becomes meaningful. And that's, it seems to\nme, why --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So you say \"riparian lands\"\nmeans the land under the wharf? That's a strange use of\n\"riparian lands.\"\nMR. FARR: No, that's what -- I mean,\n\"riparian lands\" could mean the lands on the bank, but I\nthink that's not what they're talking about in this\ncontext.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you know of any other\ninstance where people talk of riparian lands and they\nmean land extending under the water?\nMR. FARR: I think, because of the context\nhere, when it's linked with the rights, that the\nnecessary -- the limitation that Justice Alito mentioned\ngives -- colors it essentially to say this is what we're\ntalking about. And after all, this is similar --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's your position, that\n\"lands\" means the lands under the water?\nMR. FARR: That's correct, because this is\nsettling -- 1 the point of it is to settle and avoid\nfuture controversy with respect to the river, and those\nare the lands that are under the river.\nIf I could reserve --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And there was in fact in\nthis project, was there not, there was required dredging\nof 1.24 million cubic yards of submerged soil that would\nbe --\nMR. FARR: That's true.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- on the Delaware side\nof the boundary?\nMR. FARR: That's true. Although I might\npoint out that, as the Weggle Declaration says in the\nrecord -- and I can get a citation to that in a moment,\nit's in our brief -- that actually is a relatively small\namount compared to much dredging that went on prior to\n1905.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought this extended\nout more than any prior exercise of riparian rights.\nMR. FARR: In the Delaware River, I believe\nthat is correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. This was going to\nbe 2,000 feet, and the greatest extension up until then\nwas between 500 and 600.\nMR. FARR: I'm not -- I think the second\nfigure may be short. But nonetheless, I don't argue\nwith the premise.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Farr.\nMR. FARR: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Frederick.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK\nON BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANT\nMR. FREDERICK: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and may it please the Court:\nOur position can be summarized in two words:\nBoundaries matter. Boundaries determine where States\ncan make grants of land, and they determine where a\nState can exercise its police powers. And with respect\nto both principle, the Special Master got it exactly\nright. Nothing in Article VII or elsewhere in the\nCompact of 1905 precludes the State of New Jersey from\nexercising its police powers within the boundary\ndetermined by this Court in its 1934 boundary decision.\nAnd, in fact, at 291 --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I just interrupt right\nthere, Mr. Frederick? Do you contend that they may no\nlonger build wharves that go beyond the State line?\nMR. FREDERICK: No. Our position is that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, then boundries don't\nmatter completely.\nMR. FREDERICK: No, they can -- under\nDelaware law, a riparian owner in New Jersey can extend\npast the low-water mark as has been permitted by New\nJersey, by Delaware in every single instance since 1961\nwhen Delaware enacted subaqueous land laws, except the\ntwo times where New Jersey riparian owners sought to\nviolate Delaware's laws by building LNG facilities: In\n1972 when the El Paso Company sought to build an LNG\nfacility and was denied by Delaware and New Jersey\nacquiesced in that denial, and then in 2005 when\nDelaware made the status determination that the Crown\nLanding facility was a prohibited bulk transfer facility\nprecluded by Delaware law.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What if Delaware took the\nposition that there simply is the maximum amount of\nallowable building in the river, and from now on it will\nnot, in fact, agree to grant, authorize, whatever the\ntitle is, any further wharves and piers on New Jersey's\nside? Does Delaware have the authority to do that?\nMR. FREDERICK: Delaware can exercise its\npolice authority as --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It's passed a statute.\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is the statute effective?\nMR. FREDERICK: The statute is not effected\nin the hypothetical that you give. Nothing in Delaware\nsubaqueous land laws goes to clutter, visual or\notherwise, on the bank.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I'm talking about a new\nstatute. Delaware says enough is enough; no more wharfs\nand piers from the New Jersey side. Is that statute\neffective and enforceable?\nMR. FREDERICK: That statute would be\nsubject to Delaware takings law, and Delaware has found\nthat --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But, Mr. Frederick, if\nthe -- if the legislature of Delaware passes that\nstatute, I assume they intend it to mean what it says.\nAnd as against a claim by New Jersey or on behalf of a\nNew Jersey grantee, is that Delaware statute effective?\nMR. FREDERICK: It depends. Justice Souter,\nit depends.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It depends on what?\nMR. FREDERICK: The Constitution of the\nUnited States and the constitution of Delaware. A\nprivate --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Forget the Federal right\nnow. We're talking about construing a compact. So far\nas this Compact is concerned, so far as the domestic\nlaws of the two states, New Jersey and Delaware, are\nconcerned, would the Delaware statute be effective?\nMR. FREDERICK: The Delaware statute would\nnot be affected by the 1905 Compact, Justice Souter,\nbecause Delaware would assert presumably, if defending\nthat law, that it was subject to regular police power\nrestrictions. But those police power restrictions --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I'm not asking you what\nDelaware would say. I think I can imagine what Delaware\nwould say. I want to know whether Delaware would\nprevail when it got here --\nMR. FREDERICK: No.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- in your view?\nMR. FREDERICK: I don't think that Delaware\nwould prevail on a blanket prohibition of the exercise\nof riparian rights by New Jersey landowners.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why?\nMR. FREDERICK: Because Delaware has always\npermitted the exercise of riparian rights because --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that is before there\nwas all these wharves were out here, and Delaware is now\nsaying the facts have changed.\nMR. FREDERICK: Delaware certainly has the\npower, under our theory of the case as recommended by\nthe Special Master, to implement its police powers.\nThose police powers are always subject to constitutional\nconstraints. And under the hypothetical you posed, as\nextreme as it is, Justice Souter, the Constitution, both\nunder Delaware law and under the United States\nConstitution, might well say the State has gone too far\nin exercising its police --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me you're\nrunning away from the hypothetical. I have the question\nthat Justice Souter has, basically to what extent does\nconcurrent jurisdiction apply, what are the limits that\nwe will apply in later cases to implement this concept\nof concurrent jurisdiction? In the laws of some States\nyou can't overburden an easement. If you give a power\ncompany an easement, it can't put huge 300-foot\nstructures on the easement without taking -- is that the\nkind of analysis that we have to apply in order to make\nyour concurrent jurisdiction and the Master's concurrent\njurisdiction theory work?\nMR. FREDERICK: I'm not sure that you would\nneed to go that far, certainly in light of the practical\nrealities of the 150 years of shared use of the Delaware\nRiver, Justice Kennedy.\nImportantly, under New Jersey's theory, to\ngo to your hypothetical, Justice Souter, where the\nentire bed of the river within the Twelve-Mile Circle\nwould be built out, that would be a functional\nabrogation of this Court's boundary decision, because\nthis Court held that the land under the piers was not\nbelonging to New Jersey and that an attempt to extend\nthe entire boundary outward, water-ward, would be\noverriding what this Court determined was the --\neasement.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But again, you're changing\nthe hypothetical. Your answer, I -- the answer that you\njust gave, I presume would be the same whether Delaware\nhad passed any particular statute regarding wharfage\nfrom the New Jersey side or whether it had -- you were\ngiving an answer which took into consideration the\nCompact but which basically depended upon we'll call it\nthe general riparian law.\nThe question, however, is the effectiveness\nof a Delaware statute directed specifically to this\nissue that says \"no more.\"\nMR. FREDERICK: That becomes a dormant\nCommerce Clause problem, Justice Souter.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He is asking about under\nthis thing. Forget about the Commerce Clause. And it's\nobvious what the purpose of the hypothetical is. You're\nsaying that to give you the right to wharf out does not\nmean that you can use the wharf for any purpose that's\ncontrary to the police power prescriptions of Delaware.\nThat is reasonable enough.\nWell, what if one of the police power\nprescriptions is you can't have a wharf? Now, you know,\ncan you flatly contradict what Article VII says? And I\nreally think you ought to give that one away.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FREDERICK: Justice Scalia, under a\nbroad theory of where the boundary is in matters, it\nwould require New Jersey to have access to grant\nDelaware lands. And under our theory as accepted by the\nSpecial Master, that would not be permitted. If it is\nsimply a question of use, we would acknowledge that the\nNew Jersey riparian owner can --\nJUSTICE ALITO: I think you're eliminating\nthe right to wharf out. Before 1905, New Jersey was\nallowing the construction of wharves, isn't that\ncorrect?\nMR. FREDERICK: There were only two proven\nin the record, Justice Alito, and neither of which was\nproved in this record to go beyond the low-water mark.\nBut, yes, you're right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It was a wharf that didn't\ngo beyond a low-water mark?\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes. Parts of the Twelve\nMile Circle --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What did they do, jump onto\nthe land?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FREDERICK: No. In parts of the Twelve\nMile Circle, Justice Scalia, particularly in Gloucester\nCounty, there's marshy area where the low-water area\nextends hundreds of feet into the river. And that is\nwhere the boundary is -- is determined. And it was not\nnecessary in some places within the Twelve Mile Circle\nto go beyond the low-water mark in order to build a\npier --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Isn't it true -- we can look\nand see what was authorized or not before 1905. But\nisn't it true that the ability to wharf out is a classic\nAmerican -- a classic riparian right --\nMR. FREDERICK: Certainly.\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- under U.S. law?\nMR. FREDERICK: Certainly.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And in deciding whether to\nallow someone to wharf out, the State with jurisdiction\nwould decide whether the wharf was consistent with State\nobjectives, safety objectives, interference with\nnavigation and so forth?\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes, Justice Alito.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And Article VII says that\neach State on its own side of the river may continue to\nmake conveyances of riparian rights. So why doesn't\nthat mean that each State is continued -- continues to\nhave the ability to authorize the wharfing out and to\ndecide whether particular wharves are consistent with\nthe State's police powers?\nMR. FREDERICK: The last part of your\nquestion, Justice Alito, is where the rub lies, because\nriparian law was subject to the individual determination\nof what a riparian right was, and how the State's\nregulation of that right as a private property right\nwould be determined. What this Court's cases uniformly\nhold is that the police power trumps that private\nriparian right, and this was recognized by the attorney\ngeneral for New Jersey.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If you separate these two,\nthen the riparian right is worthless, is it not?\nMR. FREDERICK: I beg your pardon?\nJUSTICE ALITO: It's worthless if you\nseparate those two.\nMR. FREDERICK: No.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If you say, New Jersey can\nauthorize wharfing out, except Delaware can say you\ncan't wharf out, because it's inconsistent with our\npolice power, then -- then the authorization to allow\nwharfing out is meaningless.\nMR. FREDERICK: No, because wharfing out is\nalways dependent on whether or not it is so far into the\nriver to impede the navigable channel, to become a\nnuisance, and none of the cases by this Court talking\nabout wharfing rights concern the police powers issued\nby the State. Cummings v The City of Chicago held that\nthe Federal riparian right given to the wharf owner in\nChicago was not -- could not override a State's\ndetermination of how the wharf could be built, that\npolice power. Hudson v McCarter --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But that assumes that\nthere is going to be a wharf. You want us to say that\nthe police power means that there cannot be a wharf if\nNew Jersey says no.\nMR. FREDERICK: No.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And that seems to me\ninconsistent. If Delaware says no.\nMR. FREDERICK: Justice --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That seems to me\ninconsistent with saying that New Jersey has a right to\nwharf out.\nMR. FREDERICK: We are not going that far,\nJustice Kennedy. What we are saying --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't know where -- what\n-- where do you draw the line, what is your distinction?\nMR. FREDERICK: A wharf that impedes\nnavigation is a nuisance that is subject to classic\npolice power restrictions. A wharf that does not have\nany of those consequences is permitted and Delaware has\npermitted those wharves. In fact even recently when the\nState of New Jersey petitioned to Delaware to obtain a\npermit for the Fort Mott State Recreational Park,\nDelaware granted that to them.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So a wharf that is just\nugly is okay. Your answer to Justice Souter is,\nDelaware can't say no more wharfs.\nMR. FREDERICK: Delaware cannot say no more\nwharfs, but that doesn't answer the question that's\nreally at the rub of this case, which is what you do on\nthe wharf.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So we here decide --\nunder your view the case comes down to whether or not\nuse of the wharf for a liquified natural gas terminal is\na traditional riparian right.\nMR. FREDERICK: And all of the law and\nevidence suggests that it is not. In fact, the riparian\ngrants that New Jersey issued after its Wharf Act of 18\nnever contained a specification of use. They admitted\nin the record --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So let's say\nDelaware, it's not liquified natural, gas but it's, you\nknow, bulk shipments. Is that a traditional riparian\nright that Delaware could not prohibit or is it\nsomething that it could prohibit?\nMR. FREDERICK: Delaware has permitted that.\nThe Keystone facility allows for bulk shipments of coal\nto be delivered and offloaded within the Twelve Mile\nCircle.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Under your view a riparian\nright exists only to say whether there should be a\nwharf. The -- the State with jurisdiction over the\nriparian right has no interest in what's going to happen\non that wharf, or what the wharf is going to look like?\nMR. FREDERICK: They are distinctive rights.\nIt's like -- it's like zoning laws, Justice Kennedy.\nYou can own a piece of land but that does not mean that\nyou can override the police powers of the State by what\nyou do on land.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, what's the point you\njust made that Delaware can't permit a coal wharf but it\ncannot prohibit a liquified natural gas wharf?\nMR. FREDERICK: Delaware's Subaqueous Lands\nAct makes that distinction.\nJUSTICE ALITO: No, but --\nMR. FREDERICK: As a matter of police power\n--\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- not what Delaware will do\nor did do. Can it, could it do that?\nMR. FREDERICK: Delaware has to --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Could Delaware prohibit a\ncoal wharf?\nMR. FREDERICK: It -- yes. It could. That\nif -- if it were deemed to be a proper exercise of its\npolice authority, yes, it could.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that's the question.\nMR. FREDERICK: And the answer, Justice\nSouter, is not decided by the facts on the case here but\nrather on the individual circumstances. I appreciate\nthat there are hypotheticals that --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Then your answer to Justice\nAlito is, tell me more about the circumstances and I\nwill then give you an answer.\nMR. FREDERICK: Indeed. Because there are\nconstitutional constraints. There are dormant Commerce\nClause considerations.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. So what we want\nto know it whether or not there are constraints in the\nCompact.\nMR. FREDERICK: The Compact does not contain\nthe constraints, the Attorney General of New Jersey\nrecognized it, and this is at the appendix starting at\n905 of the Delaware appendix. In 1867 in New Jersey,\nAttorney General Robeson issued a very lengthy and\nscholarly opinion on the difference between the powers\nthat a State could exercise over riparian rights, and he\ndistinguished in that opinion between what he called the\ngreat public uses, which would be for defense, for the\nenvironment, for protection of the people's safety, and\nwhat were deemed to be public uses. Those who would be\nusing those riparian lands for a railway bridge or a\nterminal that would be for commercial purposes.\nAnd he said that in the instance of the\ngreat public uses, there would not be a need to pay\ncompensation because that great public right overrided\nthe riparian proprietor's exercise of riparian right.\nWith respect to the public use, however, and this is at\npage 910 to 911 Delaware's appendix, he said that with\nrespect to those public uses, there might be a\nrequirement for a taking or a payment of compensation.\nAnd so Justice Souter, I appreciate that our\nposition has a frustration, in the sense that it does\nrequire individual facts. But I would submit to you\nthat in the 160 years in which the -- New Jersey\ncitizens have been wharfing into the Delaware River,\nDelaware has permitted that in every single instance,\nexcept two. And there are both liquified natural gas\nfacilities.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It's rather recent that\nDelaware has gotten into the business of regulating at\nall. I thought that for most of this period until the\n'60s, Delaware just wasn't doing anything unless\nsomething was a nuisance, and that didn't come up.\nMR. FREDERICK: It is correct that Delaware\nregulated by the common law, Justice Ginsburg, but as\nthe Special Master correctly found just because the\nlimitation under the FX judicial precedents is for\nnuisances does not mean there is no regulation. When\nDelaware chose to override its common law riparian\njurisdiction by implementing statutes, New Jersey\nacceded to them to the point that in its consideration\nof coastal zone management laws in the 1970s, the\nattorney general of New Jersey was specifically\nconsulted whether compliance with the Federal statute\nand Delaware statutes was necessary.\nAnd in 1980 issued a coastal zone management\nplan, New Jersey did -- that recognized that if there\nwas an LNG facility, the agreement of both states was\nnecessary. The deponents in this case, every single one\nof them from the New Jersey side, including persons who\nhad worked for the State for nearly 30 years, said that\nthe entire time they had worked for the State, if the\nproject crossed the boundary there had to be a permit\nobtained from the State of Delaware. We would submit\nthat the constant --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: A permit -- a permit\nfor the project or a permit for the wharf?\nMR. FREDERICK: If the wharf extended beyond\nthe boundary line, Mr. Chief Justice, a permit for the\nwharf, and that permit --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then what does\nthe 1905 Compact give New Jersey?\nMR. FREDERICK: It gives New Jersey the\nright to say who shall be the riparian owners to\nexercise their rights, what they can do, and up to the\npoint where there would be an encroachment of the police\npower of the State, the permission to do that.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What case -- and I could\nask Mr. Farr the same question -- do I consult in order\nto give content to the term riparian rights? Where can\nI see what the substance of riparian rights is, in the\n-- in the decisions of this Court or in other leading\ndecisions.\nMR. FREDERICK: The leading decision of this\nCourt, Justice Kennedy, is a case called Shively v\nBowlby, which was decided a few years before the 1905\nCompact; and in that case this Court went through an\nexhaustive determination to show what the riparian\nrights were, State by State by State. The purpose there\nwas to determine whether or not an Oregon riparian land\nowner had rights that were consistent under Oregon\ncommon law with those granted in a deed by Congress, and\nin order to do that the Court went through a very long\nexamination and analysis of riparian rights as they\nexisted in all --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If I understand you\ncorrectly, Mr. Frederick, you say that the -- that the\npolice power of Delaware, despite Article VII, includes\nthe power to require you to get a license before you can\nwharf out from the New Jersey Shore?\nMR. FREDERICK: I'm saying yes, that under\nDelaware's -- no, it's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In other words, Delaware\ncan say no you can't wharf out unless, you get a license\nfrom us, despite Article VII.\nMR. FREDERICK: If it goes beyond the\nboundary, that is the position New Jersey --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course it goes beyond\nthe boundary. If it --\nMR. FREDERICK: They have --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If the other side of the\nboundary you don't need Article VII. New Jersey can\nallow anything to be done up to -- up to the low water\nmark, but you're saying that despite Article VII\nDelaware can say no, you cannot wharf out until you get\na license from us?\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes. There are prohibited\nuses, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh --\nMR. FREDERICK: You have to get a license\nunder New Jersey law, too, and that's the whole point of\nState officials by New Jersey saying compliance had to\nbe with both laws.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You've just read Article --\nArticle VII out of the Compact.\nMR. FREDERICK: No.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It gives nothing to New\nJersey.\nMR. FREDERICK: It protects the New Jersey\nlandowners who in the interregnum between the 1905\nCompact and this Court's boundary determination would\nhave faced the uncertainty that their grants would be\ndeemed puerperous by Delaware.\nWhat this Court said in its boundary\ndecision was that the mere use of those was recognized\nby Delaware under the common law, was not deemed to be a\nnuisance, but in this Court's decision in Coffee versus\nGroover, a grant made by a state that does not have\nlawful title to the land would be deemed invalid. That\ncase, which was decided in the late 1880s, invalidated\ngrants that had been made by the State of Florida at a\ntime when the boundary was uncertain. And this Court\nsaid that those grants were invalid in light of the\nuncertain title that the State had when it made those\ngrants.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why wouldn't Delaware's\npolice power allow it to require the demolition of all\nexisting wharfs?\nMR. FREDERICK: Those would be deemed\ntakings, Justice Alito.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's fine. They can do\nit.\nMR. FREDERICK: But it can be acquired by\ncompensation, yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So long as it pays.\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What's left under\nyour reading of Virginia v. Maryland? I understood that\ncase to say -- I mean it's the same thing, the Maryland\nboundary goes to the low-water mark on the Virginia\nshore. Yet this Court held that that did not include\npolice power to prevent the particular riparian use at\nissue there.\nMR. FREDERICK: The decision in Virginia v.\nMaryland is distinguishable in a number of ways, and if\nI could take a moment to go through those ways.\nThe first is that it involved a different\nCompact with different language. The 1785 Compact\nbetween Virginia and Maryland specifically provided that\neach -- the citizens of each State shall have \"full\nproperty in the shores of the Potomac River.\" The court\nconstrued the phrase \"full property\" to include riparian\nrights.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. New Jersey does\nnot have full property in the shore of the Delaware?\nMR. FREDERICK: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then that's no basis\nfor distinguishing. What else is there?\nMR. FREDERICK: The Black-Jenkins award\nissued to resolve the boundary line was decided in 1877.\nAnd in that arbitration decision, Maryland specifically\nrepresented that the boundary should be drawn around the\nwharves that were on the Virginia side of the boundary\nso that the boundary, instead of being at the low-water\nmark, would carve out every pier that had been\nconstructed.\nThe arbitrators rejected that, but in the\nprocess provided that the riparian owners on the\nVirginia side could go beyond the low-water mark -- that\nis a direct quote -- \"beyond the low-water mark to\nexercise their riparian rights.\" Congress --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's the case here\nas well. There's no doubt that New Jersey under the\nCompact has the right to grant riparian rights,\nincluding wharfing out, that go beyond the low-water\nmark.\nMR. FREDERICK: The doubt here, Mr. Chief\nJustice, is what the phrase \"own side\" means. And we\nthink the better reading of own side is captured by the\ngrants part of the Special Master's recommendation is\nthat own side means the boundary. But to the extent\nthat a right can be exercised, a riparian right\nauthorized by New Jersey beyond the low-water mark, it\nis still subject to the police powers.\nAnd at page 10 of the Special Master's\nreport in Virginia v. Maryland, the Special Master\nspecifically said this case does not concern the\nexercise of the police powers, but rather the mere\nwithdrawal of the water. There is no issue here as to\nthe types of general police powers that would apply to\nthe riparian right.\nAnd finally, I would note that the Special\nMaster was the same. He was uniquely positioned in this\ncase to assess the applicability of Virginia v. Maryland\nbecause he had been the special master in that case,\ntoo.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I don't understand the\ndifference between withdrawing water as not being\nsubject to the police powers. That could mean they\ncould drain the river, in effect.\nMR. FREDERICK: Well, what the court held\nand what was decided in that case was that the taking of\nthe water by Virginia was not to the level where it\nwould give rise to the kind of police concern that\nMaryland might express. The court left that issue open.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand that.\nIt's up to Maryland what's a concern. If Maryland\ndoesn't want any water taken, why isn't that a valid\nexercise of Maryland's police power?\nMR. FREDERICK: It would be a valid\nexercise, but I was answering Mr. Chief Justice's\nquestion about what is left of it. And the question,\nwhat is left of it is that Virginia can continue to\nwithdraw water from the Potomac River. Whether there\nshould be a problem in the future about overwithdrawing\nor an exercise --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: As I understand our\ndecision in Virginia v. Maryland it's that withdrawing\nof the water is a carve out of Maryland's police power\nthat would otherwise apply.\nMR. FREDERICK: It would -- it would be a\nlimited carve out, that is correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. Now why\nisn't there a limited carve out on the New Jersey side\nof similar riparian rights? In other words, New Jersey\nhas the authority to authorize wharfing out and to that\nextent, it's a carve out of Delaware's police power.\nMR. FREDERICK: It is a limited carve out to\nthe extent of permitting the wharfing out, Mr. Chief\nJustice. But that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't even acknowledge\nthat. You deny even that. You have said that Delaware\ncan prevent the wharfing out and say you can't wharf out\nunless you get a license from us.\nMR. FREDERICK: If it is a nuisance you\ncannot get a license. That is classic riparian law,\nMr. -- Justice --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I understood your\nearlier answer to be exactly what Justice Scalia said.\nAre you now saying that Delaware can prevent it only on\nthe grounds of preventing a nuisance?\nMR. FREDERICK: I'm saying yes. That would\nbe a classic exercise of riparian --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I'm not saying whether that\nwould be a classic exercise. Is that the only\ncircumstance in which it can be exercised, or\nconversely, does Delaware have the authority to say no\nsimply because it says no?\nI thought your answer the first time around\nfinally was the latter. It can say no. And I think\nthat's what my brother Scalia thought.\nNow are you saying it can say no only if\nthere is a nuisance or some other specified reason?\nMR. FREDERICK: Let me try it this way. As\na limitation of a riparian right, the State of Delaware\ncan limit the length of the wharf, whether the wharf\ngoes in ordinary circumstances, but as to a prohibition,\nit cannot do so unless it is a nuisance as a matter of\nriparian jurisdiction. As a matter of police power --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wait. He is not done. As\na matter of police power, however, they can do anything?\nMR. FREDERICK: No. The State can limit the\nactivities that can occur on the wharf. And that is the\ncrucial distinction here.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And it can limit it, I\npresume, subject to some reasonable rule of health and\nsafety?\nMR. FREDERICK: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. It simply cannot say\nas a matter of legislative view case no more wharfs?\nMR. FREDERICK: That's correct.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Who decides whether it's a\nnuisance? If Delaware says that docking a sailboat is a\nnuisance, who decides that? Does all of this have to be\ndecided by us in original cases?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FREDERICK: Typically the Corps of\nEngineers determines that issue as a matter of\napplication of the 1899 Rivers and Harbors\nAppropriations Act. Section 10 of that act, Justice\nAlito, the Corps of Engineers has the authority to\ndetermine whether or not a docking or wharfing in a\nnavigable waterway of the United States would constitute\na nuisance to --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you're not talking\nabout nuisance. You're talking about Delaware's\nenvironmental laws. That's what this project concerns.\nMR. FREDERICK: That's correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And you were saying\nDelaware's environmental laws trump whatever riparian\nright New Jersey can grant?\nMR. FREDERICK: The environmental laws would\napply to the project. The position of Delaware is not\nthat BP can't build its wharf. It's that it can't\nengage in a prohibited use on that wharf. The wharf\nitself is not a nuisance. It does not violate any\nnormal standard of riparian use.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Could the State of New\nJersey allow the wharf to be built for some unspecified\npurpose, just let it stick out there until it decides\nwhat it wants to do with it?\nMR. FREDERICK: As I matter of both States'\nlaws, Justice Kennedy, that's not how either state does\nit. Both States now require as part of the\nenvironmental --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm asking a hypothetical,\ncould it do that? It would seem to me that would be a\nvery stupid riparian use, but could it do that?\nMR. FREDERICK: I think that, yes, it could\ndo that if its intent was to achieve access to the\nnavigable waterway. But both states, both New Jersey,\noutside the Twelve-Mile Circle, and Delaware apply\npolice powers now so that permits have to be required\nwhen --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How does that work?\nWhat if New Jersey says to the wharf owners you must\ndredge around your wharf because we think it's -- you\nknow, silt is depositing, and Delaware says you may not\ndredge around your wharf because we think it's going to\ndisturb the oysters? Who -- how do you concur\njurisdiction work in that case?\nMR. FREDERICK: That is an easy one, Mr.\nChief Justice, because New Jersey has conceded that it\ndoes not have the authority to regulate dredging within\nthe Twelve Mile Circle.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's something\nthey do have the authority to regulate.\nMR. FREDERICK: That's the point. Riparian\njurisdiction is quite limited. It concerns only certain\naspects of the riparian owner's access to the waterways,\nand that limitation of that property right has been\nrecognized for centuries by this Court and others\ncourts.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You used the word\n\"riparian jurisdiction.\" We have riparian rights.\nThat's a familiar term. Riparian jurisdiction which is\nused in Article VII is a novelty.\nMR. FREDERICK: That's correct, Justice\nGinsburg. I'm using it in the term that the Special\nMaster did it, which is the State's jurisdiction to\ngovern the exercise of riparian rights. It is not a\nterm of art.\nFarnham's treatise, which is another source\nof where riparian rights traditionally have been\nrecognized, did not use that phrase, and the parties\ncould not find any --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Frederick, does the\nriparian right include the right to dump refuse or\nsewage into a river?\nMR. FREDERICK: It is a -- yes, it is a part\nof the classic riparian right, intakes and discharges,\nJustice Stevens.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And even though that would\ncreate a nuisance across the river, you could -- they\nstill would have -- who would trump? Who would prevail?\nMR. FREDERICK: The police power would\nprevail on that, because what you dump is what -- is\nwhere everything matters. If the dumping is simply\nwater that doesn't have any ecological effects, that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, I'm assuming something\nthat pollutes the river.\nMR. FREDERICK: That would be subject to the\nenvironmental laws. That's classic police power\nrecognized by this Court in Hudson v. McCarter.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Frederick.\nMr. Farr, you have three minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF H. BARTOW FARR\nON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF\nMR. FARR: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nMay I just say two things, and, first of all, something\nthat we haven't really talked about this morning.\nWith respect to matters of nuisance and all,\nFederal law provides a substantial array of laws: The\nClean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the Coastal Zone\nManagement Act, the Rivers and Harbors Act, all of those\nthings.\nAnything built out from New Jersey has to\nundergo Federal review; and, subject to the Compact,\nDelaware has rights to participate at that Federal\nlevel. So what we are talking about here, and what the\nbill of complaint deals with, is the question of whether\nDelaware can do what it did here, which is apply its\nState law enacted under its police power to say that a\nproposed project, riparian project, for the New Jersey\nside is impermissible and cannot be built. So we are\ndealing just with the law of State versus State.\nNow -- so I'd like to suggest if -- if we\nput ourselves in the shoes of the Commissioners who were\nnegotiating this Compact in 1905, what is the likely\nreaction if Article VII -- if, now, Delaware had\nproposed at the time that, instead of the language as it\nis now, at the end of Article VII the words were added\n\"subject to the police power of the other State\"?\nNew Jersey obviously would have had the\nreaction to that that that is something that depends on\nthe boundary. There is no chance that New Jersey is\ngoing to be able to exercise any police power on the\nDelaware side, because there is no boundary dispute that\nwould involve that.\nSo this would essentially be a one-way veto\nthat Delaware would be trying to add to the contract to\nsay: Could we -- we'll be able to override any riparian\nstructure under our police power.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's a one-way pass. Why\nshouldn't it be a one-way veto?\nMR. FARR: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't give Delaware\nanything.\nMR. FARR: Well, except for the fact that,\nagain, if we put ourselves in their shoes, it seems to\nme what New Jersey would say is: If you are proposing\nthat you can veto all of our riparian projects using\nyour police power because of your view of the boundary,\nwhy are we dismissing the case that we just filed, or\nfiled in 1877 --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You are saying that the --\nMR. FARR: --to determine the boundaries?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You are saying that the\nconcept of \"riparian rights\" displaces the police power,\nto a large extent.\nMR. FARR: To the extent that the exercise\nof the police power is inconsistent with the power of\nthe State, the authority of the State, to authorize a\npier or wharf for the purposes for which piers and\nwharves are used, which is the loading and unloading of\ngoods.\nIf that is what the State -- if that is what\nNew Jersey has done, that is not subject to an override\nor a veto by Delaware exercising its police power. I\nmean this was an important value at the time that the\nCompact was enacted, and New Jersey would not have\nlightly let Delaware veto it.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Farr, can I ask\nyou a question as purely a --\nMR. FARR: Of course.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- matter of\ncuriosity? The parties talk about the Duke of York's\ngrant to William Penn in this case, but nobody ever\nexplains where Delaware came from. How did that --\nwhere did Delaware -- I mean a grant to William Penn is\nPennsylvania. Where -- when did Delaware --\nMR. FARR: Oh, there were -- I think there\nwere further grants along the process and further\ndivision of -- of territory. I think some of that is\nactually explained in New Jersey v. Delaware, too. I\nmay be leading you in the wrong direction, but I don't\nthink so.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you. The case\nis submitted.\n(Whereupon, at 12:06 p.m., the case in the\nabove-entitled matter was submitted.)\n34:2 37:18,23 38:1 Appropriations 53:19 belonged 6:13\n44:13 50:6,15 arbitration attempt
