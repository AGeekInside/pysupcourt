VERRILLI, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. VERRILLI: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nUnder the clearly established law of Strickland\nv. Washington, a lawyer's decision about how to defend a\nclient facing a death sentence must be supported either by\na thorough investigation or by a reasonable professional\njudgment supporting limitation on investigation.\nIn this case, the Maryland Court of Appeals and\nthe Fourth Circuit applied that rule in an objectively\nunreasonable manner. Kevin Wiggins' lawyers did not\nfulfill what this Court described in Williams against\nTaylor as their obligation under Strickland to investigate\nthoroughly their client's background, and no reasonable\nprofessional judgment in fact supports or could support\ntheir failure to do so.\nQUESTION: Do you think the Williams case is a\nwhite horse for you, that is, I mean, that it's exactly\nidentical to this case?\nMR. VERRILLI: I do not think it's exactly\nidentical to this case, Your Honor, but we think it\nclearly informs this case both by explaining what an --\nwhat an objectively unreasonable application of Strickland\namounts to and in emphasizing the critical importance of\ninvestigating a -- a -- your client's background as -- as\na prerequisite to making informed, reasonable choices\nabout how best to defend your client.\nQUESTION: But -- but wasn't Williams decided\nafter the Maryland Supreme Court's opinion here?\nMR. VERRILLI: Yes, it was Justice Scalia,\nbut --\nQUESTION: So, therefore, it can't be used for\npurposes of deciding whether what Maryland did was an\nunreasonable application of then-existing Federal law.\nMR. VERRILLI: I disagree with that, Justice\nScalia, for the following reason. Williams, like this\ncase, was an AEDPA case and all Williams could do was\ndecide whether Strickland had been unreasonably applied.\nWilliams was -- because Williams was an AEDPA case, was a\n2254(d)(1) case, Williams could break no new ground by\ndefinition, and therefore, the -- the fact that Williams\nconcluded what it did about Strickland's requirement,\nmeans that that is what Strickland requires. And that --\nand -- and so we don't think it -- we're going beyond\nAEDPA in the least.\nQUESTION: Yet, you go back to Strickland and\nyou can't find the principle that you're now enunciating.\nMR. VERRILLI: Oh, no, no. I disagree with\nthat, Mr. Chief Justice. We think it's right on page 690\nand 691 of -- of Strickland, and here's the principle that\nwe think -- Strickland specifically says, as we read it,\nthat a lawyer's judgment about how to defend a client has\neither got to be based on complete investigation or, if\nit's based on less than complete investigation, it's\nreasonable only to the extent that reasonable professional\njudgment supports the limitation on investigation. That's\nthe rule.\nQUESTION: Last year in Bell -- Bell versus\nCohen -- Cone, we stressed that it is a tremendously\ndeferential regard that we have to the lawyer's action in\na case like that.\nMR. VERRILLI: Yes, but there's a fundamental\ndifference between this case and Bell v. Cone, Mr. Chief\nJustice, and it's this. Bell v. Cone was not a case about\nthe failure to investigate. That was purely a case about\ncounsel's decisions about what information to present to\nthe sentencer after having done what was indisputably a\nthorough investigation.\nAnd the reason that's critical is because as --\nas we read Strickland, the whole point of the deference\ngiven to counsel's choices about what to present is\npremised on the adequacy of the investigation that\nprecedes them. That is what the source of the deferential\nstance towards presentation is. It's the adequacy of\ninvestigation.\nQUESTION: Is that what this case is about,\nMr. Verrilli, about failure to investigate?\nMR. VERRILLI: This case is about both, but it's\nprincipally about --\nQUESTION: It would seem to me if it were, you\nwould have to establish pretty clearly that counsel did\nnot know these many things that you say he did not know.\nAnd in fact, counsel was never asked the question, did you\nknow this, did you know that, did you know -- we don't\nknow what counsel --\nI -- I'm looking at the joint appendix on\npage 490. He knew a lot of these things. He's -- he's --\nhe's asked did you know that Wiggins had been removed from\nhis natural mother as a result of a finding of neglect and\nabuse when he was 6 years old? Yes, he says, I knew that.\nThat was in the social service records. So you knew it.\nYes.\nYou also knew that there were reports of sexual\nabuse at one of the foster homes. Yes, he knew that.\nYou also knew he had his hands burned as a child\nas a result of his mother's abuse of him. Yes, he knew\nthat.\nYou also knew about homosexual overtures made\ntowards him by his Job Corps supervisor. Yes.\nAnd you also knew he was -- he was borderline\nmentally retarded. Yes.\nNow, that -- that examination could have --\ncould have gone further, but you didn't know, did you,\nthis, this, this, this, and this. There's no examination\nlike that. We know that he knew many things about this\nperson's background, but we don't know that he didn't know\nthe rest of it.\nMR. VERRILLI: I disagree with that, Justice\nScalia.\nQUESTION: Well, how do we know that he didn't\nknow it?\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, here's how. There -- there\nare two absolutely compelling reasons, but before I get to\nthem, I think it's important to look at the very next\nthing that the lawyer says in that colloquy. And the very\nnext thing the lawyer says is, well, yes, at least I knew\nwhat was reported in other people's reports. And that is\nwhat led the Maryland Court of Appeals to the conclusion\nit reached, which was that the social service records and\nthe pre-sentence records, other people's reports,\ncontained that information, and we have shown by clear and\nconvincing evidence that they do not.\nBut there are two additional points that are\ncritical here, and the first one is this. The trier of\nfact, the actual judge who heard that testimony --\nQUESTION: I -- I have to correct you. That --\nhe -- he didn't say that all of this that he knew he only\nknew because it was in other people's reports. The\nquestion was -- he had just said -- and you also knew that\nhe was borderline mentally retarded. Yes.\nHe -- then another question is begun. You knew\nall -- he interrupts the question and he says, at least I\nknew that as it was reported in other people's reports,\nyes.\nmentally retarded.\nMR. VERRILLI: Justice Scalia, that is not how\nthe --\nQUESTION: That's how it reads.\nMR. VERRILLI: -- Maryland Court of Appeals read\nit. It is not how the Fourth Circuit read it.\nQUESTION: The court of appeals and the Fourth\nCircuit must have read it wrong because that's the way it\nreads.\nMR. VERRILLI: But -- but, Justice Scalia, what\nmatters here for AEDPA purposes under (d)(2) is whether\nthe court of appeals based its determination on an\nunreasonable factual finding, and there are two -- there\nare two critical indicia here that it did. The first\none -- the first one is this. Well, there are three.\nFirst, the records don't contain the\ninformation.\nSecond, the trier of fact, the judge who heard\nthis testimony, concluded -- and this is at page 605 and\n606 of the joint appendix -- that Mr. Schlaich, the lawyer\nwho gave that testimony, did not know what was in the\nsocial -- what was in the social history subsequently\nprepared.\nQUESTION: This was in the trial itself or in a\nState habeas proceeding?\nMR. VERRILLI: In the State habeas proceeding,\nYour Honor. His -- at the conclusion of his testimony and\nduring closing argument by the -- by the government in\nthat State habeas proceeding, the -- the trier of fact who\nheard the testimony, could assess demeanor, could assess\ncredibility, heard all the other evidence, saw all the\nother evidence, concluded that he didn't know and found it\nwas error.\nAnd then -- and the next point that we think\nconclusively demonstrates that -- that the lawyers did not\nknow is this. Remember that -- that at the close of the\nsentencing proceeding, not the post-conviction proceeding,\nMr. Chief Justice, but the actual sentencing proceeding,\ncounsel for Wiggins made a proffer of what mitigating\nevidence they would have submitted to the sentencing jury\nhad their motion to bifurcate been granted. That proffer\ndoesn't mention any of the mitigating evidence that --\nthat we have shown in the social history -- doesn't\nmention the terrible abuse of the first 6 years of his\nlife. It doesn't mention the horrible burning incident.\nIt doesn't mention the sexual abuse. It doesn't mention\nthe homelessness. There's no conceivable reason why\ncounsel would have withheld all of that information from\nits proffer at the conclusion of the sentencing phase of\nthe proceeding if counsel knew that and could --\nQUESTION: So that counsel referred to other\npeople's reports and other reports. Can we draw any\ninference from the record that there were some reports\nother than the -- I take it it's the social -- social\nservices report?\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, I think there was --\nQUESTION: And the pre-sentence and social --\nMR. VERRILLI: Pre-sentence.\nQUESTION: -- and social services? Were there\nany other documents that --\nMR. VERRILLI: The -- there is a document which\nthe State has lodged which indicates that there were\ntranscripts of interviews with family members. Those\naren't in the record, but I think the same exact analysis,\nthe same exact inference has to be drawn. If those had\nincluded the kind of terrible descriptions of -- of abuse,\nit would have shown up in the psychologist's report\nbecause, after all, what that document shows is the\npsychologist got those interviews and it would have shown\nup in the proffer because that is the most --\nQUESTION: And -- and the psychologist's is the\nsocial -- social services report.\nMR. VERRILLI: No. That's separate --\nQUESTION: That's a separate report.\nMR. VERRILLI:\nQUESTION: That's exactly my -- look, there is a\ndocument here called lodging and it says, Baltimore City\nDepartment of Social Services Department File. Now, in\nlooking through it briefly, I cannot find in it all the\nreferences that you say are not in it.\nMR. VERRILLI: They are --\nQUESTION: I don't think they're there.\nMR. VERRILLI: They are not there.\nQUESTION: But this says, other people's\nreports, and I'm perhaps going to hear in about 20 minutes\nfrom now that there could be other reports to which he was\nreferring which are not in this document and which might\nbe those other -- those other interviews with other\npeople, et cetera. In other words, I don't want you to\nsit down -- it's -- it's one thing if I'm supposed to look\nat this document and say did this lawyer investigate the\nbackground, and the answer I think would be no. But it's\nquite another thing if he knew all kinds of other things\nfrom other sources, namely about the burned hands, all the\nthings you've listed. So I want to be sure.\nNow, you're referring me one other thing, the\nproffer. But in respect to the proffer, since I've read\nthe briefs, I suspect I will hear the following. Of\ncourse, he didn't want to proffer this. His strategic\ndecision was to make the jury think that this man might\nnot have done it, and the more lunatic we make him sound,\nthe more the jury is going to think the opposite.\nMR. VERRILLI: Justice Breyer, let me -- let\nme --\nQUESTION: Or I suspect I'll hear that because\nI've read it.\nMR. VERRILLI: Let me address --\nQUESTION: So I would like you --\nMR. VERRILLI: Let me address that directly\nbecause I think this goes the essence of why the Maryland\nCourt of Appeals judgment was an unreasonable application\nof -- of the Strickland rule, and it's this.\nThe proffer occurred in the following context.\nCounsel for Wiggins made a motion to bifurcate the\nsentencing proceeding so that they could first retry the\nfactual case of eligibility, and then if they lost, they\ncould then put on the full-blown mitigation case.\nQUESTION: That would have involved the\nprincipal issue had they -- as a separate --\nMR. VERRILLI: Right. Bifurcation would have\nfirst involved the principalship, and then had\nprincipalship been established to the jury's satisfaction,\nthey would have moved to the issue of mitigation. And\nthe -- and the trial judge denied that motion. Now, he\ndenied that motion -- this is critical -- on the first day\nof the sentencing hearing. So up to the first day of the\nsentencing hearing, Kevin Wiggins' lawyer's strategy was\nobviously to prepare both a principalship case and a\nmitigation case because they made a motion that was\ndesigned to allow them to do precisely that. So there is\nno conceivable justification for them to have failed to do\neverything a reasonable lawyer would have done to develop\na mitigation case.\nAnd they -- and what the proffer shows -- I'm\nafraid the proffer cannot, Justice Breyer, be explained on\nthe basis that Your Honor described for this reason. The\npoint of the proffer -- the point of the proffer was to\nshow the judge and to create a record on appeal of what\nthey would have shown had the bifurcation been granted and\nthey could have tried their mitigation case. This proffer\nwas their mitigation case.\nQUESTION: What about the first part which was\nJustice Kennedy's part, I think so far all of our parts --\nquestions, which is when you read just the part that\nJustice Scalia read to you -- and he says it's on the\nbasis of other people's reports -- will the other side\nconcede or how do we know it's -- what he's referring to\nis this document rather than some other set of documents?\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, I think what's critical in\nthat regard is what the Maryland Court of Appeals found\nbecause what AEDPA requires deference to is factual\nfindings made by a State court. And what the -- and the\nfactual finding that the Maryland Court of Appeals\nfound -- made is on page 121 of the appendix to the\npetition in the -- in the second paragraph there. It --\nit says, counsel was indeed aware of Wiggins' unfortunate\nbackground. They had available to them not only the\npre-sentence investigation, but detailed social service\nrecords documenting sexual abuse and physical abuse.\nThat is the sum and substance, the total, of\nwhat the Maryland Court of Appeals said in terms of the\nfacts here. It's the sole factual finding. That factual\nfinding --\nQUESTION: Did it say, and nothing else? Did it\nsay, and nothing else?\nMR. VERRILLI: It said --\nQUESTION: You're -- you're making it as though\nit was a factual finding that this is all that he knew.\nNow, they knew that he knew that, but they didn't make a\nfactual finding that he didn't know anything else.\nMR. VERRILLI: They -- the factual -- the only\nfactual finding they made -- the only -- the only -- the\nonly thing that supports and explicates the general\nstatement at the outset of that paragraph that they were\naware of his unfortunate childhood is the specific factual\nfinding that the social service records documented sexual\nabuse and documented physical abuse. We've shown by clear\nand convincing evidence that that finding is wrong.\nAnd then under (d)(2) in AEDPA the question is\nwhether the Maryland Court of Appeals' judgment was -- was\nbased on an -- an unreasonable factual determination. And\nwe've shown that the only thing that they found --\nQUESTION: Mr. Verrilli, I'd like to come back\nto the habeas -- the State habeas decision that you --\nthat you cited us to, which is on the joint appendix\npage 604. Now, as I understand it, if you're making a\nclaim of failure to investigate, the burden is on you to\nshow that counsel did not know things that he would have\nlearned on investigation. The burden is on you.\nAs I read this court's decision, what the court\nis simply saying is, I don't ever remember a death penalty\ncase where there was not a social history done. And so it\nwas simply unthinkable not to have a social history.\nThen when you go across the page, so, therefore,\nbased upon the evidence that I have seen, I'm concluding\nit was error for them not to investigate it because I\ndon't have any information before me to believe that they\ndid not have this information available to them.\nYou see the context? And I understand what\nyou're saying, but the context of this case is that I have\nno reason to believe that they did have all of this\ninformation. That's not -- that's not enough to satisfy\nyour burden. That court would have had to find I believe\nthat they did not have this information, not I just have\nno reason to believe that they had it.\nMR. VERRILLI: But --\nQUESTION: The court should have had to find\nthey did not have this information. It doesn't find that.\nIt just says I have no reason to believe that they had it.\nMR. VERRILLI: Justice Scalia, I disagree. I do\nnot think that is a reasonable reading of what the trial\njudge held. What the trial --\nQUESTION: You -- you tell me what it means. It\nsays --\nMR. VERRILLI: The trial --\nQUESTION: -- I have no reason to believe that\nthey did have all of this information.\nMR. VERRILLI: The trial judge said that he was\nconcluding that it was error not to investigate. If they\nknew the information, it wouldn't have been error not to\ninvestigate and --\nQUESTION: No. Earlier the -- the trial judge\nsays, I just don't think -- I -- I don't know any\ncapital --\nMR. VERRILLI:\nScalia --\nQUESTION: -- I don't know any capital case in\nwhich a social history wasn't done.\nMR. VERRILLI: With all due respect --\nQUESTION: I think he -- I think he reversed\nsimply because you're always supposed to do a social\nhistory.\nMR. VERRILLI: With all due respect, Your Honor,\nthe very sentence that you pointed to said, based on the\nevidence that I have seen, I'm concluding it was error for\nthem not to investigate it. If they knew the information,\nhe never would have reached that conclusion.\nQUESTION: No. He reached the conclusion\nbecause --\nMR. VERRILLI: And that's completely supported\nby the proffer.\nQUESTION: He reached the conclusion because\nhe --\nQUESTION: No two voices at the same time.\nJustice Scalia is asking you a question.\nMR. VERRILLI: Excuse me.\nQUESTION: He reached the conclusion because he\nsaid, I have no reason to believe that they had the\ninformation. He never made the finding that they didn't\nhave it.\nMR. VERRILLI: I think that's implicit, Justice\nScalia, in his conclusion that it was error not to\ninvestigate, and I think it's completely confirmed by the\nproffer which didn't include any of this information and\nfor which there would have been absolutely no explanation\nfor its exclusion. Absolutely none whatsoever. So I\nthink with respect to the -- to the factual finding that\nthe Maryland Court of Appeals made, that the social\nservices records documented abuse and provided the source\nof his knowledge, that's clearly erroneous.\nQUESTION: Mr. Verrilli, you said absolutely no\nreason why it wouldn't come in if they had it. Why\ncouldn't counsel for the defense think if we introduce\nthis, it's going to be subject to cross examination? And\nif we look at that social history, we find out that the\nwhole thing is -- the defendant himself was the source of\nthe information about the horrible sexual abuse he had\nbeen exposed to as a child. The jury might find that a\nperson who had been so abused would be full of hate and\ntherefore very likely would have had the mental state to\ncarry out this brutal murder that -- in other words, that\nthis kind of information could be a two-edged sword. The\njury could infer from it he's not fully responsible for\nhis acts or, on the other hand, that this person was\nviolent, full of hate, and indeed committed this brutal\nmurder.\nMR. VERRILLI: Well, I think, Your Honor, I'm\ngoing to answer Your Honor's question directly, but I -- I\nneed a minute to do it.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. VERRILLI: The question under Strickland, it\nseems to us, is that once you've concluded that there was\na failure to investigate adequately, the question is\nwhether there is a reasonable probability that the outcome\nwould have been different as a result of that failure.\nAnd in this case, it seems to me, that means that what\nwe -- and Strickland also stresses that that is an\nobjective test. That is not based on the idiosyncracies\nof the individual decision makers. It's an objective\nanalysis.\nAnd so the question here is whether had this\ninformation been investigated, if it was in the hands of\ncompetent counsel, is there a reasonable probability that\ncompetent counsel would have used it and introduced it,\nand then is there a reasonable probability that it would\nhave affected the sentencing jury's outcome.\nAnd the second half of that analysis, it seems\nto us, is answered a fortiori by Williams against Taylor.\nThe first half of that analysis seems to us\nclearly to support relief here because, as I take Your\nHonor's question, it's a question of, well, there might be\na justification for not submitting this evidence to the\njury. Yes, there might. We think in a case like this\none, it would be an unreasonable choice not to do so\nbecause this evidence has so little of what this Court has\ndescribed in other cases like Burger and Darden as a sharp\ndouble edge, and it is so powerfully mitigating that we\ndon't think it would have that effect.\nBut we -- we respectfully suggest that's not the\nrelevant question. Once you've established deficient\nperformance with respect to investigation, then we shift\nto the prejudice inquiry, and it's an objective analysis.\nAnd so long as there is a reasonable probability that\ncompetent counsel would have used this information in\ncombination with the case that they made, then -- and\nthere's a reasonable probability that the outcome would\nhave been affected, which I think Williams v. Taylor\nestablishes for us, then we have shown what we need to\nshow to be entitled to relief.\nQUESTION: Do you --\nQUESTION: What are the --\nQUESTION: What do you think the test is that\nWilliams against Taylor lays down as to determining a -- a\nprobability of a different outcome?\nMR. VERRILLI:\nfrom Justice O'Connor's concurring opinion with respect to\nthat. If there's an obvious failure on the part of the\nState court to consider the totality of the record, that's\nan unreasonable application with respect to prejudice.\nAnd with -- in Williams, of course, as Your Honor's\ndissenting opinion pointed out, there was a much more\nsevere case of aggravating information than here.\nWilliams had a terrible, long record of violence. Wiggins\nhas none. And the mitigating evidence here is even\nstronger than the mitigating evidence that existed in the\nWilliams case.\nAnd so we think it follows directly from\nWilliams that -- that if you look at whether there's a\nreasonable probability that the outcome would have been\ndifferent here on the basis of submitting this evidence,\nthat we think that's a very clear and easy case under the\nstandards that Williams sets.\nQUESTION: Are -- are you making any argument\nthat the ruling on the bifurcation motion might also have\nbeen different if there had been a proffer of this? Or\ndid the judge rule on the bifurcation motion without\nknowing what the mitigation evidence might be?\nMR. VERRILLI: The -- factually, Justice\nKennedy, it's the latter. The -- he ruled on the\nbifurcation motion at the outset of the -- of the trial.\nQUESTION: Is -- is that a common motion in\nMaryland capital cases, to try to bifurcate the sentencing\nproceeding?\nMR. VERRILLI: At the time it was, and the\nreason it was, Mr. Chief Justice, is because sometime\nshortly before this case was tried in Baltimore County,\nanother Baltimore County judge had allowed such a motion.\nAnd we think that fact reinforces the utterly\nunreasonable character of the failure to investigate here.\nThese lawyers had a -- had -- had to think there was a\nreasonable prospect they were going to be able to put on a\nmitigation case, but we know that all they had to put on\nthat mitigation case was the psychologist's testing. And\nafter all, that -- all that psychologist did was test.\nQUESTION: But they would -- they would be\nfighting over the principalship too, would they not?\nMR. VERRILLI: Yes, but that -- the point of\nbifurcation was to do principalship first, and if they\nprevailed on principalship, they wouldn't go to the second\nphase. And only if they didn't prevail on principalship\nwould they go to the second phase where they wouldn't have\nany of the tactical cross currents they were worried about\nbecause principalship was already established and they\ncould go whole hog and make the fullest mitigation case\npossible.\nAnd the fact that they were -- that they were\nendeavoring to follow that strategy until the first day of\nthe sentencing hearing, October 11th, 1989, shows that\nthey didn't -- that all they had as of October 11, 1989,\nwas the psychologist's report -- shows that they did not\ninvestigate at the level that Strickland requires.\nQUESTION: Mr. --\nQUESTION: What about the psychological reports,\nMr. Verrilli? Those were available to defense counsel?\nMR. VERRILLI: Yes, Justice O'Connor.\nQUESTION: And indeed, obtained by defense\ncounsel.\nMR. VERRILLI: Yes, Justice O'Connor.\nQUESTION: And what did they reveal in this area\nof mitigation?\nMR. VERRILLI: They were -- the -- the -- there\nare two things that are important about the psychologist's\nreport: one, what it does contain; the other, what it\ndoesn't contain.\nThe psychologist was commissioned in this case\nto do testing of Mr. Wiggins, intelligence testing and\nthen psychological profiling, MMPI-type testing. The\nevidence is undisputed about that. That's what the\npsychologist did.\nThe thing that's significant about what was\ndiscovered was the fact that Mr. Wiggins was of borderline\nintelligence, which seems to us quite relevant and\nentirely consistent -- it would have been entirely\nconsistent, even absent bifurcation, to use that evidence,\nin addition to an effort to disprove principalship,\nbecause the borderline intelligence would easily and\nstrongly have supported the conclusion that Mr. Wiggins\nwas an accomplice and not a principal.\nBut the thing it doesn't show is any of the\nhistory of abuse, and that's because the psychologist\nwasn't commissioned to do that. They didn't do what they\nneeded to do here, which was to do the social history.\nThe evidence is clear that it was routine practice in\nthese public defenders' office to do the social history.\nThey admitted that. The evidence is clear -- and the --\nand the public defenders admitted it -- that funds were\navailable for that purpose. They just didn't do it. They\njust dropped the ball on this. They didn't do what all\nthe lawyers in their office did routinely, and they didn't\ndo what the State post-conviction trial judge said he had\nnever seen not done, which is prepare this social history\nand --\nQUESTION: Mr. Verrilli, is -- is there any\nevidence, one way or the other, as to whether defense\ncounsel simply sat down with the defendant and said, tell\nus about your background and what has happened to you in\nyour life? Is there any evidence one way or the other\nabout that?\nMR. VERRILLI: There is not. There is not, but\nit wouldn't be a surprise, Justice Souter, that even if an\ninterview like that occurred, that the defendant would not\nhave revealed it, that -- it's very difficult to get this\nkind of history of horrible personal abuse out of a\ndefendant. It very often requires a professional to do\nit. That is why -- that's the very reason why the social\nworkers are brought in to do the kinds of social histories\nas a -- as a routine matter. And it wasn't done here.\nIf there are no further questions, I'd like to\nreserve my remaining time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Verrilli.\nMr. Bair.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GARY E. BAIR\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. BAIR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nI'd like to first start with a correction in the\nfactual record in this case. Counsel for petitioner\nhas -- has referred the Court to JA605 and 606. And\nindeed, that was a comment made by the post-conviction\ncourt during the State post-conviction proceedings.\nHowever, that was an oral comment from the bench in April\nof 1994.\nThe post-conviction court's written opinion did\nnot issue until 1997. And in the post-conviction written\nopinion -- it was a 257-page written opinion. And that\nwritten opinion basically countermanded and superseded and\ndisavowed the statements that are on page JA605 and 606.\nIf you look to page 137a of the appendix to the petition\nfor writ of certiorari, that is where you have the\nexcerpts from --\nQUESTION: What page? What --\nMR. BAIR: 137a, Your Honor. That is where\nyou have the excerpt from the State habeas, State\npost-conviction court's written opinion. And if you look\nat footnote 261 on that page --\nQUESTION: These are footnotes in the State\ncourt's opinion or footnotes in the -- in the appendix?\nMR. BAIR: This is in -- these are footnotes in\nthe State post-conviction court's opinion. It was, as I\nsaid, a very lengthy opinion and had several hundred\nfootnotes as well as 257 pages.\nBy the time the post-conviction court rendered\nits final decision, its written decision, it had the\ntranscripts from the post-conviction proceeding. And --\nand as you may recall, the post-conviction proceeding\nlasted 5 months. Testimony was taken over 7 days in a\n5-month post-conviction hearing.\nThat footnote 261 is the transcript that Justice\nScalia was referring to which is on JA490 and 491. So\nthis is the testimony that the post-conviction court used\nto make its fact finding. And in its fact finding it said\nSchlaich had more information than appeared in the PSI\nreport.\nI would go back to what was said earlier. There\nwere several sources of the information for trial counsel.\nIn fact, I would -- I would tally them up to be six\ndifferent sources. You had, obviously, the DSS reports,\nthe lodged material that Justice Breyer referred to,\n220 pages of social background, educational background,\nmedical background, because petitioner was in foster care\nfrom when he was about 6 years old to when he --\nQUESTION: Let me just get one thing straight on\nthe -- the long footnote that you quote. They end up\nsaying, you knew all this and you did not get a social\nhistory. Do you think it was -- a competent counsel would\nhave gotten a social history or not knowing what he said\nhe knew?\nMR. BAIR: I think he got a -- he -- he got a\nsocial history in a different way, Your Honor. He didn't\nhire a forensic social worker.\nlengthy DSS reports, hired a psychologist, hired a\ncriminologist, talked to family members, talked to the\nclient. He didn't do it in the way that -- that counsel\nnow says it should have been done.\nQUESTION: Is -- is the way that counsel says it\nshould have been done the way that lawyers typically do it\nin -- in Maryland?\nMR. BAIR: I think they do it in different ways,\nYour Honor. I think -- I think sometimes they use\nforensic social workers. Sometimes they use\npsychologists.\nQUESTION: But they're wrong to tell us that\nthey normally use social workers. Is that right?\nMR. BAIR: I think --\nQUESTION: That was -- his representation was\nthat this case is unique because every other member of the\ndefense bar routinely gets the social history. Are you --\nis that right or wrong?\nMR. BAIR: I think it's wrong. I think it's\nwrong, Your Honor. I think that lawyers in Maryland use\npsychiatrists, they use psychologists, they use social\nworkers, they use combinations thereof.\nQUESTION: But he didn't use any of these.\nMR. BAIR: Pardon me?\nQUESTION:\nMR. BAIR: He -- he used a psychologist and he\nused a criminologist. And he obtained very lengthy DSS\nrecords.\nQUESTION: If -- the DSS records that he\nobtained -- are they all in the lodging or there are some\nother ones?\nMR. BAIR: Yes. They're all -- they're all in\nthe lodging.\nQUESTION: Okay. Now, if -- if -- it's\n5 months -- it took 5 months. They went into this in\ngreat care. You've given us the lodging. I've looked\nthrough the lodging, my law clerk more thoroughly. I\ncan't find a word about the sexual abuse. I can't find a\nword about the frightful things that he -- one I did find\nwhere it said for -- when he was taken from his mother\nat age 6, it's true that the mother hadn't fed him for\n2 days. All right. That's there, but none of this other\nstuff is there.\nAnd -- and, indeed, if he looked at any of it --\nanywhere for this other stuff, where would he have looked?\nWhy wasn't that in the record which took 5 months, if in\nfact he looked? Why was there no more reference to it\nthan an ambiguous statement where he seems to refer to the\nlodging?\nMR. BAIR:\nof points to be made.\nFirst of all, I -- I agree, and I think we state\nin our brief, there is no specific reference to sexual\nabuse in those -- in -- in the lodging.\nQUESTION: And that's actually -- to me that's\nthe most serious thing there is, I mean, in terms of\nshaping an individual who could later turn out the way\nthat some have turned out. And -- and there is -- it was\nhorrible in this case, and -- and there's absolutely no\nreference whatsoever that I can find that suggests that\nthis lawyer even knew about it.\nMR. BAIR: Well, there is, Your Honor. That --\nthat goes back to JA490 and 491.\nQUESTION: He said he knew about it.\nMR. BAIR: But the lawyer explicitly testified\nthat he knew of it.\nQUESTION: And what was -- that's why I want to\nknow since -- since that statement, the two pages out of\n5 months, when I read them -- people can characterize them\ndifferently, but it seemed to me ambiguous, and the\nwritten reports could have easily referred to what I call\nthe lodging. But if they didn't refer to the lodging,\nwhat did they refer to?\nMR. BAIR: The written reports and -- and I\nthink the reports of others could be either written\nreports or oral reports. I think --\nQUESTION: What he said was -- what did he say?\nHe said, in other people's reports. Yes, they could have\nbeen. So I would like to know. There's been 5 months of\ntrial, as you said. There have been endless proceedings.\nIn your opinion, what did they refer to if, in fact, they\ndid not refer to the lodging? Because if they did refer\nto the lodging, the lawyer in those two pages out of the\n5 months simply made a mistake, repeating what he knew\nlater and thinking that he had learned it earlier from the\nlodging.\nMR. BAIR: Your Honor, again, two -- two points\nto be made. One is if there is any ambiguity or any lack\nof a record here, I think under Strickland that inures to\nthe detriment of petitioner. He had the burden at this\nhearing to rebut the -- the strong presumption of\ncompetence, the strong presumption of reasonable conduct.\nBut let me go back to what the reports were.\nYou had reports from the client. And I think, although,\nas -- as was asked earlier by Justice Souter, there's\nnothing in the record to say whether he spoke to his\nclient. I think we can infer that he spoke to his client.\nHe represented him for close to a year. Counsel for\npetitioner at post-conviction never pursued those lines of\nquestioning.\ntalked to his client.\nQUESTION: The -- the post-conviction proceeding\nextended over a period of 5 months. How many trial days\nwere there?\nMR. BAIR: There were 7 days, Your Honor, where\ntestimony was taken in those 5 months --\nQUESTION: So it had recessed and then\nresumed --\nMR. BAIR: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- several times.\nMR. BAIR: Yes, several times. It was --\nQUESTION: Mr. Bair, you -- you seem to accept\nthat -- that all that he knew was as it was reported in\nother people's reports. But I just don't read the text\nthat way. He said, at least I knew that as it was\nreported in other people's reports. And the that in that\ntranscript is that he was borderline mentally retarded.\nMR. BAIR: I agree.\nQUESTION: That is the only thing that he said\nhe got from other people's reports.\nMR. BAIR: I agree. I think --\nQUESTION: We don't know where he got all of the\nother information that he said he had.\nMR. BAIR: No, but I think logically, going back\nto the reports of sexual abuse, there's only one person\nthat could have come from because even the Selvog report,\nwhich is what post-conviction counsel prepared -- Selvog\ntestified at the post-conviction hearing that his sole\nsource for the information about Wiggins' sexual abuse was\nfrom Wiggins himself.\nNow, Wiggins obviously spoke to his attorney.\nHe spoke to the psychologist who interviewed him. He\nspoke to the criminologist that trial counsel hired.\nClearly, I think an inference can be drawn that Wiggins\nreported that sexual abuse either directly to his attorney\nor to the criminologist or to the psychologist.\nQUESTION: And in your view on page 137a of the\ntranscript, all of those matters are comprehended in this\nquestion and this answer toward maybe -- 10 lines from the\ntop. You also knew that there were reports of sexual\nabuse at one of his foster homes? Yes.\nMR. BAIR: Yes.\nQUESTION: So the term -- the word reports there\nmeans that he relied on things other than that are in the\nlodging.\nMR. BAIR: Yes, I think so, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: To your knowledge -- and this is\nquite important to me. I'm just trying to find out what\nthe -- if they were not referring to the lodging which\ncontains the reports, if they were not referring to that\ndocument, they must have been referring to or they were\nreferring to Wiggins' own statements.\nMR. BAIR: Either Wiggins' own statements or the\nreports of the other experts in the case.\nQUESTION: Other experts in the case.\nMR. BAIR: Right. There was --\nQUESTION: He would have gotten them from?\nMR. BAIR: From Wiggins.\nQUESTION: After the trial was over.\nMR. BAIR: No, no, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Before, before.\nMR. BAIR: This was all going on --\nQUESTION: That's the criminologist and the --\nMR. BAIR: Yes, yes. And those reports were\nprepared before trial or between trial and sentencing.\nThere was a 2-and-a-half month postponement between the\ntime of this trial and the time of the sentencing.\nQUESTION: All right. So the words, other\npeople's reports, could have meant Wiggins told me or an\nexpert whom I hired who talked to Wiggins told me.\nMR. BAIR: Yes.\nQUESTION: Yes, okay.\nMR. BAIR: Or I guess the only -- the only\nother --\nQUESTION:\nretarded. It only goes to whether he was mentally\nretarded.\nMR. BAIR: Yes.\nQUESTION: I'm puzzled about another thing.\nMR. BAIR: The only other --\nQUESTION: Do those reports refer to sexual\nabuse?\nMR. BAIR: Pardon me, Your Honor?\nQUESTION: Do those reports refer to sexual\nabuse?\nMR. BAIR: The only report that refers to sexual\nabuse -- now, the only written report that refers to\nsexual abuse is the Selvog report.\nQUESTION: The what?\nMR. BAIR: The -- the Selvog report was the one\ndone by the social worker during post-conviction by -- by\npost-conviction counsel.\nThe psychologist's report was an oral report.\nSo we don't really know exactly what he knew because\nthere -- that was never reduced to writing.\nQUESTION: Well, I'm still puzzled. Were there\nany written reports available to the lawyer that referred\nto sexual abuse that we know about?\nMR. BAIR: No.\nQUESTION:\nthere were reports of sexual abuse at one of his foster\nhomes, he was wrong.\nMR. BAIR: No. I think he -- he was referring\nto -- he could have been referring to reports of Wiggins\nhimself.\nQUESTION: Oh, oh. I see what you're saying --\nQUESTION: Oral reports.\nMR. BAIR: Oral reports.\nQUESTION: That -- that word reports does not\nmean written reports.\nMR. BAIR: I don't think it has to refer to\nwritten reports, Your Honor.\nThe only -- just to follow up with Justice\nBreyer, the only other report was the pre-sentence\ninvestigation. That was the other written report that was\navailable to counsel.\nQUESTION: But that didn't have --\nMR. BAIR: No, no, no.\nQUESTION: I mean, what's worrying me obviously\nis we're -- we're turning an awful lot here on this word,\nother reports, which came in a fairly long hearing and\nwhich would normally be taken as referring to written\nreports, though it doesn't say that. And I'm -- that\nmakes me concerned. I'm not sure where to go with it.\nMR. BAIR:\nOne, counsel did testify and it was undisputed -- it was\nnever in any way negated through cross examination or any\nother vehicle -- that he knew of sexual abuse. In fact,\nhe specifically answered the question, the more specific\nsexual abuse question, I knew about the Job Corps\noverture. So those answers are unequivocal and they stand\nin the record unchallenged.\nQUESTION: Yes, but that's troubling because the\nJob Corps overture is -- is quite mild compared to the\nrepeated days, months-on-end physical abuse suffered at\nthe hands of the stepfather.\nMR. BAIR: I agree.\nQUESTION: And it seems to me that this -- well,\nI'll ask you. Does this permit us to make the inference\nthat if he had known this, he would have brought it out?\nMR. BAIR: I think --\nQUESTION: Because it's just very difficult to\nsee why he would not have.\nMR. BAIR: Well, I think he made a -- a\nreasonable tactical decision.\nQUESTION: That goes to the tactical point.\nMR. BAIR: I think he made a reasonable tactical\ndecision. He had a powerful case. Under Maryland law,\nthe jury had to find unanimously and beyond a reasonable\ndoubt that Wiggins was the principal, that is, the actual\nkiller in this case.\nThey also had to find unanimously and beyond a\nreasonable doubt that the murder and the robbery occurred\nat the same time, and there was evidence in this case.\nThis was a very unusual situation in that it wasn't even\nclear whether the robbery occurred simultaneously with the\nmurder. There was a -- there was a -- a huge dispute at\ntrial and at sentencing over when Ms. Lacs was killed\nbecause her body was discovered on a Saturday. Wiggins\nwas in possession of her car --\nQUESTION: Mr. Bair, may I ask? Did counsel\nduring the -- the sentencing hearing come up with a theory\nas to what happened other than that his client was the\nkiller?\nMR. BAIR: Yes, absolutely. He challenged\nand -- and very strenuously both during opening and -- and\nclosing -- pointed out the evidence in the case that\nshowed there were five fingerprints in Ms. Lacs' apartment\nthat were not tied to anyone. There was a hat, some sort\nof a baseball hat, that was in the apartment.\nQUESTION: No, I understand -- but did he -- did\nhe suggest who they might have belonged to? Did he come\nup with a theory as to who --\nMR. BAIR: No. I don't -- I don't think there\nwas any particular person who was another suspect.\nQUESTION: He didn't suggest that the man who\nlived downstairs might have been involved.\nMR. BAIR: No. And that -- that was never\nchallenged as part of any ineffective assistance of\ncounsel in these proceedings, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Mr. Bair, what -- what do you respond\nto opposing counsel's argument that it doesn't matter\nbecause you didn't know until the eve of trial that you\nwouldn't have had a bifurcated proceeding, so you should\nhave been doing this research in contemplation of a\nbifurcated proceeding?\nMR. BAIR: Well, Your Honor, first of all, of\ncourse, our position is they were doing it. They had,\nas -- as I said, lots of information. They were doing it.\nThey were -- they were keeping that option open.\nBut another answer, Your Honor, is the evidence\nwould not have been put on. The more evidence that --\nthat actually came out in -- in, you know, the\nproceedings, the details that we've now learned of through\nthe Selvog report, they are so double-edged. They are so\npotentially harmful particularly in the context of this\ncase. Between the Selvog report and the lodged materials,\nthe DSS records, the -- the jury would have heard not just\nthat Kevin Wiggins was -- had been in foster care and had\na clean record, which is all they did hear. In addition,\nif those records had come in, they would have heard that\nhe hated his biological mother, that he was in fights with\nother foster children, that he had once stolen some\ngasoline and tried to set fire to -- to a building, that\nhe had a disturbed personality --\nQUESTION: That all goes to explain why they\nwouldn't have put it in, but why didn't they put any of\nthis in the proffer at the -- to the judge at the --\nMR. BAIR: There -- there was no need to, Your\nHonor. There's no need under Maryland law to give a\ndetailed proffer. They -- they did not want to tip off\nthe other side as to any potential things that might be\nnegative to their client.\nAnd again, to the degree that we don't know\nabout the details, it -- it inures to the detriment of\nWiggins. It was his burden to bring out all of this\nevidence and he didn't do it.\nQUESTION: Does -- does the strength of the\nmitigating evidence have anything to do with whether a\nbifurcated proceeding is allowed?\nMR. BAIR: No.\nQUESTION: Would they have been more likely to\nget the bifurcated proceeding if they had come up with a\nlot of information about his childhood and so forth?\nMR. BAIR: I don't believe so, Your Honor. Of\ncourse --\nQUESTION: What does it turn on then?\nMR. BAIR: I think it was -- it was the trial\ncourt's discretion. I think it was just a -- this was\nback in 1989. There wasn't a lot of definitive law on it\nat the time. Since then, the Maryland Court of Appeals\nhas said absolutely not.\nQUESTION: Was there a transcript of that\nhearing? He just said, I want a bifurcated hearing and\nsat down, or did he say, I want a bifurcated hearing\nbecause there's going to be very substantial mitigating\nevidence and I want the jury to consider that separately?\nWhat did he -- do we have a transcript of what he said\nhere?\nMR. BAIR: I think we do have a transcript, Your\nHonor, and my recollection is that there was a short\ndiscussion of it, not -- not a detailed discussion of it.\nQUESTION: No, but if he had been in a position\nto make a strong proffer, why wouldn't he have made it?\nHis case for a bifurcated hearing would have been stronger\nif he had had a strong proffer. Wouldn't it have been?\nMR. BAIR: It would have been stronger, Your\nHonor, but I think in all likelihood if you look -- if you\nlook at the Maryland sentencing law, it contemplates it,\nas I said, the court of appeals in Maryland has since held\ndefinitively. In fact, in the direct appeal in this case,\nin the Wiggins case itself on direct appeal, they have\nheld that the Maryland sentencing procedure in capital\ncases requires that the jury go through certain steps, and\nthose steps all have to be done at a unitary hearing.\nObviously, there's a bifurcated guilt/innocence and\nsentencing.\nQUESTION: Well --\nQUESTION: Well, obviously, the -- the defense\ncounsel didn't know until the motion was made and ruled\nupon for a bifurcated hearing whether the judge would\ngrant it, and there's no reason presumably that defense\ncounsel should not have investigated the mitigating\ncircumstances pending that ruling.\nMR. BAIR: I agree.\nQUESTION: And yet, we don't have a clear\nunderstanding of what he knew. And in fact, did not\ndefense counsel tell the jury for sentencing that they\nwould be hearing evidence about the defendant's\nbackground --\nMR. BAIR: They -- they did --\nQUESTION: -- at sentencing? And then nothing\nwas put on.\nMR. BAIR: No, not -- not really, Your Honor.\nQUESTION:\nmake of that? It's so odd.\nMR. BAIR: I don't -- I don't think so, Justice\nO'Connor. I think -- I think what counsel did is if you\nlook at the essence of the -- the approach at sentencing,\nclearly it was we're contesting principalship. There was\none comment about you're going to hear what a tough life\nhe had.\nNow, that was done I think for a couple reasons.\nOne is the counsel knew that petitioner could allocute and\nprobably would allocute personally to -- to the -- the\njury.\nThey also knew that there was going to be a\ncriminologist who was going to testify because the jury\nknew there was only two choices for this man, either life\nor death. That was -- and life without parole. But they\nknew it was either life or life without parole or death.\nAnd they were also putting on evidence by a criminologist\nthat would show that Wiggins would adjust well to a life\nsentence. So I think they -- they also knew that -- that\nthe pre-sentence report --\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Bair.\nMR. BAIR: Thank you, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Mr. Himmelfarb, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAN HIMMELFARB\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe position of the United States is that the\nSixth Amendment imposed no obligation to present evidence\nof petitioner's background at sentencing. It imposed no\nobligation to conduct a more extensive investigation of\nhis background before sentencing. Those conclusions\nfollow from a straightforward application of Strickland\nversus Washington which judges attorney performance by a\nsingle standard, whether it was reasonable under all the\ncircumstances of the case.\nThe decision to choose a principalship defense\nand to reject a mitigation defense falls comfortably\nwithin the wide range --\nQUESTION: What's the bifurcated -- I've never\nheard of a bifurcated sentencing hearing. How does that\nwork?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: My understanding, Justice\nBreyer, is that the basis for the motion was that the\nprincipalship defense could be undermined by presenting\nthe mitigating evidence, so they wanted to do it\nseparately.\nQUESTION: Right. So what do you do? You\npresent the principalship defense and then the jury votes\ndeath or life, and then if they vote death, they go on and\npresent the next one, and if the next jury or the same\njury, having heard the other one, votes life, then it's\nlife? I mean, I don't see how it works.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: My understanding is that under\nthe theory advanced by petitioner's counsel in support of\nthe bifurcation motion, principalship alone would be\ndetermined at the first phase of the sentencing. If the\njury found principalship, there would be a second phase at\nwhich counsel could --\nQUESTION: Okay. Under those circumstances,\nthey're saying that, obviously, in that motion he would\nhave given everything he knew about the background since\nhe thought it might work that way, and if he didn't,\nthat's evidence, in fact, amazingly convincing evidence,\nthat he didn't know. He didn't know about the sexual\nhistory.\nAnd the main argument they're making has nothing\nto do with the strategic choice. It has to do with his\nfailure to investigate.\nSo what's your -- what's your response?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: If you look at the actual\nproffer that was made in support of the bifurcation\nmotion, which is at pages 44 and 45 of the joint appendix,\nwhat counsel said was, I can proffer to the court that in\na non-bifurcated proceeding, the defense is in a position\nof coming forward with evidence regarding psychological\nhistory on Mr. Wiggins.\nQUESTION: This is 40 -- page 44 of the appendix\nto the petition?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: No, Mr. Chief Justice. It's\nthe joint appendix.\nQUESTION: Oh, the joint appendix?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Page 44 at the bottom.\nI'm in a position to come forward with evidence\nregarding psychological history on Mr. Wiggins, including\naspects of his life history, including a diagnosis of a\npersonality disorder, including diagnosis of some\nretardation. So --\nQUESTION: So he says nothing whatsoever about\nthe most frightful sexual abuse, about having the mother\nwho did all the things that this one particularly did, not\nfeeding them, burning their hands on the stove, et cetera.\nI won't list it. But I just don't see anything in the\nthing you've just read that suggests that he knew a single\nthing about that.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Well, it's true it was a\ngeneral proffer rather than a highly particularized\nproffer.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nobviously, if he had known about it, he would have said\nsomething, and the fact that he didn't say something, when\ncoupled with the ambiguities on the pages, you know, 404\nor 405 or 401-402 -- you get what we're talking about, the\nfootnote -- coupled with that shows that the correct\nreading of that is he didn't know about it.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: I think there's an important\npoint to keep in mind here. The constitutional right\npetitioner has raised in this case is not the duty to\nknow, it's the duty to investigate. The claim is that the\ninvestigation was constitutionally inadequate.\nAnd the other important thing to keep in mind is\nthat there is significant evidence in the record that a\nsignificant investigation was done, an investigation which\nwe think is constitutionally adequate.\nQUESTION: Mr. Himmelfarb, in that connection,\nthere's something I'd like you to set me straight on.\nThere was a statement at some point that each of the\ndefense counsel thought the other was going to bear the\nlaboring awe in working up the mitigation case. Now, it\nseems to me that each one thought the other was doing it\nand the other wasn't doing it. That would be ineffective\nrepresentation if each one thought the other was\ninvestigating and it turned out neither investigated.\nMR. HIMMELFARB:\nproblematic, but I don't think the record bears that\nsuggestion out, again, going to the joint appendix.\nQUESTION: Well, where -- where do I get that\nnotion from that each one thought the other was\nprincipally responsible for working up the mitigation\ncase?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Petitioner makes that argument\nin his brief, and there are record cites to support it.\nBut we don't think the record cites do, in fact, support\nthe notion that each counsel thought the other was\nresponsible for investigating the mitigation case.\nThere were two lawyers, Schlaich and Nethercott.\nAt page 485 of the joint appendix, Schlaich testified that\nafter he left the Baltimore County Public Defenders Office\nand went to another office, from that point forward his\nco-counsel, Ms. Nethercott, did most of the mitigation\npreparation with his guidance.\nThen Ms. Nethercott testified at the\npost-conviction hearing as well, and her testimony was\nthat she had no responsibility for retaining experts,\nthat that was Schlaich's responsibility.\nSo I think that's a far cry from testimony by\neither that only the other one had responsibility for\npreparing the mitigation case. Each one was testifying\nabout his or her particular responsibilities.\nQUESTION: Yes, but where -- the page you refer\nto, he says, when asked what he did in -- in mitigation,\nhe said, well, basically what we did in mitigation was\nattempt to retry the factual case and try to convince the\njury on the principalship issue. That doesn't sound like\nthe kind of mitigation we're talking about.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Well, that's right, Justice\nStevens. It remains the case, though, that a substantial\namount of investigation was done. That testimony --\nQUESTION: But this part of the transcript\ncertainly doesn't support that proposition.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Well --\nQUESTION: That's the part you called our\nattention --\nMR. HIMMELFARB: -- in fairness to Mr. Schlaich,\nI think he was interpreting the question to mean what was\nyour defense at sentencing, not so much what was your\nmitigation --\nQUESTION: That's right. So this part does not\nsupport the -- the proposition that he did any mitigating\nresearch himself or with the other person. He's talking\nabout the principalship issue.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: I was just responding to\nJustice Ginsburg's question about whether it was true that\neach one testified that the other was responsible for the\ninvestigation. My only point is that I don't think the\nrecord bears out that suggestion in petitioner's brief.\nQUESTION: But it also doesn't show that there\nwas substantial investigation, which is what you went on\nto say, and I don't think it's supported.\nMR. HIMMELFARB: I do, Justice Kennedy. The\ninvestigation that was done in this case by trial counsel\nwas not materially different from the investigation that\nwas done by post-conviction counsel. It was trial\ncounsel, after all, who obtained the social services\nrecords that documented a history of neglect. Trial\ncounsel directed public defender investigators to go out\nand interview petitioner's family members, which they did.\nTrial counsel hired a psychologist to conduct clinical\ninterviews of petitioner which were done.\nReally the only difference between what trial\ncounsel did and what post-conviction counsel did was that\npost-conviction counsel hired a social worker, a so-called\nmitigation specialist, who supervised the investigation\nand pulled the information together in a report.\nBut we're talking here about whether there is a\nconstitutional deficiency in the investigation, and any\ndifference in the two investigations, which is really the\nfact that the social worker was there in the one but not\nthe other, we think can't have constitutional\nsignificance.\nI do want to say a little bit about the duty to\npresent claim because most of the focus in the argument\nhas been on the question of the duty to investigate.\nWe think that the principal defense was\nreasonable both because a finding of no principalship\nwould have been an absolute bar to imposition of the death\npenalty and because the principalship case that the State\nput on here was so weak.\nWe also think it was reasonable not to present a\nmitigation defense either in addition to the principalship\ndefense or instead of it. It was reasonable not to\npresent it in addition to the principal defense because it\nhad a -- a very serious possibility of undermining it. It\nwas reasonable not to present it instead of the\nprincipalship defense because mitigating evidence is just\nthat. It's evidence that would be weighed against\naggravating circumstances. It might or might not lead to\na sentence of death.\nA finding of no principalship is a categorical\nbar to imposition of the death penalty. If a single juror\nharbored a reasonable doubt about whether petitioner had\ncarried out the killing himself, it would be obligated to\nreturn a verdict of life.\nQUESTION:\ndetermination of the facts about the murder was made in\nthe trial when he was determined guilty or innocent, and\nthey found him guilty. And so to try to redetermine that\nat sentencing and not to offer any evidence in mitigation,\ndo you think we can say that's reasonable?\nMR. HIMMELFARB: Absolutely. There were two\ndifferent issues, one issue at the guilt phase, one issue\nat the sentencing, as far as the -- as far as petitioner's\nrole is concerned. He was charged with first degree\nmurder. As the jury was instructed, a conviction of first\ndegree murder does not necessarily encompass a finding of\nprincipalship, a finding that petitioner himself had\ncarried out the killing. So it was perfectly\nunderstandable that petitioner's counsel would think that\ncontesting principalship at sentencing would be a\nreasonable strategy.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Himmelfarb.\nMr. Verrilli, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. VERRILLI: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nI'd like to clarify the -- the facts surrounding\nthe proffer because it's very important to understand how\nthis unfolded.\nCounsel for Wiggins made a motion. That motion\nwas argued on October 11th, 1989 and denied at that time,\nthe first day of the sentencing hearing. But the proffer\nwas not made at that time. What -- what counsel for my\nfriend, the United States, described was what Mr. Schlaich\nhe would proffer if he had to proffer. He made the actual\nproffer at the end of the sentencing proceeding, and it\ncan be found at pages, I think, 349 to 51 of the -- 348 to\n51 of the joint appendix. And there's a lengthy proffer\nthere of what he would have shown had he been able to put\non his mitigation case in the -- in the method he wanted\nto. So --\nQUESTION: He does that -- he does that to\nargue --\nMR. VERRILLI: He's making a record for --\nQUESTION: -- after the fact that that the\njudge --\nMR. VERRILLI: He's making a record for appeal,\nJustice Kennedy. Here's the -- here's what we would have\nsuffered because we wouldn't have been -- we weren't able\nto put on all of this mitigating evidence, and here it is.\nAnd so the sum total of his mitigation case is\nright there on the pages. He's described what it is and\nit contains nothing about the horrible abuse that this boy\nsuffered. Nothing.\nNow, with respect to the question of whose\nresponsibility it was, I think it is correct to focus on\nthe -- the colloquy on page 485 of the -- of the joint\nappendix, but the question asked Mr. Schlaich there, as\nJustice Stevens' question suggested, was, well, he first\nsays, well, it was Ms. Nethercott's job to develop\nmitigation. And then the question put to him is what\nguidance did you give her, obviously, about how to develop\nthe mitigation case. And he says, well, what we decided\nto do was retry the factual case. That's the -- that's\nwhat he says he gave as guidance with respect to\ndeveloping the mitigation case. So it's -- it's\ncompletely clear that this was neglect. They just dropped\nthe ball.\nNow, with respect to what they actually did at\nthe sentencing proceeding, picking up on Justice\nO'Connor's questions, I think this is critical as well.\nRemember, Strickland says no hindsight, but\nthat's an argument that works against the government in\nthis case because what these lawyers actually did was, in\nopening statement, invite the jury specifically to\nconsider not only the facts of the crime but, quote, who\nthis person is, said they would hear he had a difficult\nlife. And then they didn't deliver on that promise.\nBut not only that, Dr. Johnson, the -- the\ncriminologist, got up and testified, well, yes, violent\npeople do tend to adjust well in prison. Well, that's not\nfocusing on principalship. That, once again, is inviting\nthe jury beyond principalship into the mitigation inquiry\nand giving them some reason to -- to mitigate, but of\ncourse, omitting all of the extraordinarily powerful\nreasons to mitigate that the social history shows.\nAnd then third, there was as a matter of law in\nMaryland a pre-sentence report that had to go to the jury.\nAnd there was nothing that Wiggins' lawyers could do to\nstop that. And that pre-sentence report gave a highly\nmisleading and negative portrayal of Wiggins' background.\nAnd the -- what -- effect of what these lawyers did was to\nleave that unrebutted, further damaging Wiggins'\nprospects, further ensuring that he was going to get a\ndeath sentence.\nNow, if I could conclude by just reminding this\nCourt that very recently in the Miller-El case, this Court\nsaid even in the context of Federal habeas, the\ndeferential review of Federal habeas, there's a difference\nbetween deference and abdication. And what my friends on\nthe other side are asking for here is the latter. They\nare asking for abdication. They are asking this Court to\nuphold a judgment even though the only factual finding the\nMaryland Court of Appeals made was wrong by clear and\nconvincing evidence, and even though that proffer\ndemonstrates that Wiggins' lawyers did not do the work\nnecessary and did not know the powerful mitigation case\nthat could have been made to save this man's life.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you,\nMr. Verrilli.\n"
