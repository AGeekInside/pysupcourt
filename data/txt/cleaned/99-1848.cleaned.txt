Mr. Arceneaux.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WEBSTER J. ARCENEAUX, III
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. ARCENEAUX: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
This case presents a simple issue, whether the
Fourth Circuit's decision in this case that a party is not
a prevailing party unless they obtain a judgment, consent
decree, or settlement is in accordance with this Court's
prior decisions and the intent of Congress in establishing
the term, prevailing party, in the Civil Rights Attorneys'
Fees Award Act of 1976, commonly referred to as section
1988, and the two statutes at issue in this case, the Fair
Housing Amendments Act, and the Americans With
Disabilities Act.
When Congress enacted all three of these fee-
shifting statutes, it did not condition an award of fees
only upon the result of a judgment, consent decree, or
settlement. In fact, nowhere in these --
QUESTION: Well, the language of the statutes in
each case, does it not, refers to prevailing party?
MR. ARCENEAUX: Yes, Your Honor, it does.
QUESTION: So we do have to be satisfied that
the person seeking fees is a prevailing party.
MR. ARCENEAUX: Absolutely.
QUESTION: And how is that to be determined
where the case is dismissed as moot?
MR. ARCENEAUX: Well, I think in that situation,
we have a declaration that the case is moot, so -- in this
particular case we had that as well -- and then we can
look and see under what is known as the catalyst theory,
whether that lawsuit caused the defendant to act to render
that suit moot.
QUESTION: I would have thought the language,
prevailing party, suggests something else, that there
ought to be some nominal damages, or some judgment, or
some indication that the person seeking fees did, in fact,
prevail in a judicial proceeding.
MR. ARCENEAUX: If we look just to the word,
prevail, I believe it is a broad word, and this is my
point. Congress didn't say prevail by judgment, consent
decree, or settlement, Congress said prevail, and I
believe that --
QUESTION: But the term, prevailing party, has a
pretty well-established meaning in the law, doesn't it?
It means you prevailed by getting something in a lawsuit.
MR. ARCENEAUX: Yes, and I think that's a fine
way to put it. If I sued someone for damages I think is
an easy way to put it, if I sue them for $50,000, and they
hand me $50,000 and say, go dismiss this lawsuit, I don't
have a judgment, I don't have a consent decree, I don't
have a settlement, but I have the $50,000.
QUESTION: But that's not the way lawsuits are
ordinarily settled. If someone sues you for $50,000, you
will probably pay it, but you'll get a stipulation and
order dismissing the thing. It will be a matter of court
record --
MR. ARCENEAUX: That's correct.
QUESTION: -- that it was dismissed not because
of mootness but because you're paid.
MR. ARCENEAUX: That's right, but -- and that's
the same thing in this situation, where, when I sue
somebody and I say, don't shut down my home, don't throw
the residents out of the home, and they say, okay, we
won't do that, now, I don't have a judgment, consent
decree, or settlement, but I have the same effect, the
same result as if they had handed me the $50,000.
QUESTION: But that's not what the statute says.
It says you have to be a prevailing party, and I think
prevailing obviously means prevailing in the lawsuit,
not -- it doesn't say the happy party, you know, the party
who goes away smiling. It says the prevailing party. I
think it means prevailing in the litigation, and to
prevail in the litigation there has to be something that
ties the result to the litigation, it seems to me --
MR. ARCENEAUX: And --
QUESTION: -- other than simply, it came out the
way the plaintiff would have liked.
MR. ARCENEAUX: And that is one of the factors
that is looked at, whether there is a causal relationship
between --
QUESTION: But you would have to establish it.
It's not just a factor. You would have to show --
MR. ARCENEAUX: Absolutely.
QUESTION: -- that the litigation caused the
result, caused, in this case, the homes to remain open,
even though they didn't have the --
MR. ARCENEAUX: Absolutely, and that is what we
intend to do. We were not given our day in court, so to
speak, because we were not allowed to proceed with any
factual development of that, but we think that we have a
very strong case, and we will absolutely be able to
establish the causal relationship.
QUESTION: All right, suppose I sue my next-
door neighbor for making loud music at night and keeping
me awake, all right. He turns off the music, and I drop
the lawsuit. Why am I the prevailing party? I mean, we
both -- everybody agrees on the facts. I got exactly what
I wanted, but also there is no piece of paper in the suit
that says anything. All it says is, the suit is dropped.
Now, I think the Chief Justice and Justice
O'Connor and I wanted to know why that's a prevailing
party within the meaning of the word prevailing in this
statute. Nobody doubts you got what you wanted, but why
is that sufficient?
MR. ARCENEAUX: When you look to the prior
decisions of this Court, the definition of prevailing
party under the cases has been, they personally achieve
some of the benefits they sought in bringing the suit.
Their lawsuit completely changed the defendant's behavior
towards the plaintiffs, and in this case and in your
example --
QUESTION: And those are cases in which there
was no piece of paper saying anything?
MR. ARCENEAUX: Sometimes there are settlement
agreements --
QUESTION: No, but the question is, is there a
case which, the person got just what he wanted, but there
is no piece of paper saying anything in the lawsuit. All
there is, is that the plaintiff dropped it.
MR. ARCENEAUX: Right. I mean, this is a case
of first impression. There's not been a case from this
Court.
QUESTION: All right.
MR. ARCENEAUX: There are obviously numerous
cases in the courts of appeals.
QUESTION: Then we're back to my question. Why,
given this statute, is the word prevailing party here to
be interpreted to mean you are a prevailing party, even
though there is no piece of paper saying anything in the
lawsuit --
MR. ARCENEAUX: Right.
QUESTION: -- but for a piece of paper that
says, I terminate the lawsuit?
MR. ARCENEAUX: Two reasons.
QUESTION: That's the basic question --
MR. ARCENEAUX: Yes.
QUESTION: -- in the case, and I want to hear
your answer.
MR. ARCENEAUX: Two reasons. First, because I
think it's consistent with the meaning of the word,
prevail, which can also mean persuade, induce, or
influence another to act, and second, because I believe
that's what Congress intended.
When one looks at the House report, for
instance, it says similarly, after a complaint is filed,
the defendant might voluntarily cease the unlawful
practice. A court might still award fees, even though it
may conclude as a matter of equity that no formal relief
such as injunction is needed, and the legislature then
cites to the decision of Parham v. Southwestern Bell
Telephone Company.
QUESTION: I'm sure every Member of Congress
read that case. They ran to their library and looked up
that case. You really think that anybody who voted for
that bill had the slightest idea what that case held?
MR. ARCENEAUX: I think that that --
QUESTION: How many people do you think knew
what that case held? Two? You think -- I think two would
be an extravagant number.
MR. ARCENEAUX: I think that it is consistent --
QUESTION: There is a presumption that we follow
that the Congresspeople know what the law is, isn't there?
MR. ARCENEAUX: Yes.
QUESTION: We said that in some of our opinions.
MR. ARCENEAUX: Yes.
QUESTION: Cannon, for example.
MR. ARCENEAUX: Yes, and I think that had
they --
QUESTION: Do they know what the court of
appeals law is? They know what the court of -- lower
courts have been holding as opposed to what this Court has
held?
QUESTION: The Marr case was a Supreme Court
case, wasn't it?
MR. ARCENEAUX: Yes, and this was section 1988.
where this Court had said in Alyeska that we were not
going to have attorney's fee award under what was called
the Private Attorney General, and so Congress intended to
have these type of civil rights lawsuits filed, and they
wanted to encourage these type of lawsuits. That's what
the language says, and this is what is under the
discussion of prevailing party, and so the issue is, is
that what Congress intended, we think that you can look to
the legislative history and to the plain meaning of the
terms, prevailing party, and say that yes, that is what is
intended here.
QUESTION: Mr. Arceneaux, in the event of
ambiguity, I am reluctant to read a term in a way that's
going to get courts into areas that it's very difficult
for them to maneuver in.
In the present case, you want the opportunity to
demonstrate below that an act of legislation, right -- I
mean, what happened was that the law was changed.
MR. ARCENEAUX: Yes.
QUESTION: And you want to show that the
legislators who change the law were motivated by this
lawsuit. This is a very peculiar area for courts to be
functioning in, to try to figure out what prompted
legislators to enact a particular law.
I mean, would it be enough to be a catalyst, for
example, if one legislator found out about this lawsuit
and said, why, that's outrageous, that the law should be
that way. In other words, they weren't worried about
losing money. All they were worried about is, all the
lawsuit did was bring to their attention a disposition
that seemed to them outrageous, and so they said, let's
change the law. Is that enough to be a catalyst?
MR. ARCENEAUX: I do not think that we have to
make that inquiry, Your Honor. I think that while --
QUESTION: Well, I'm happy to hear that.
MR. ARCENEAUX: Yes.
QUESTION: But I'd like to know why.
MR. ARCENEAUX: And I will tell you,
Your Honor, because West Virginia is unique. It is unlike
the Federal Government or most States in that
administrative agencies cannot promulgate regulations. We
don't think that the inquiry in this case, the facts rule
investigation that we're trying to establish here, will
involve the legislature whatsoever. Certainly we have no
intent, as one of the amici suggests, that we need to go
out and depose legislators. This is not going to be an
inquiry about a legislative activity.
QUESTION: What will you do? How will you prove
it?
MR. ARCENEAUX: We think that we have an
overwhelmingly strong case, because what happened here, we
took the deposition of the State fire marshal in March of
1997. He said that it was absolutely impossible for the
State of West Virginia to adopt this rule. Six to eight
weeks later, he changed his mind. He made the decision to
promulgate the rules and change the rules as we were
requesting in the lawsuit. What happened in that interim?
We took the deposition of Dr. Bernard Levin, who was the
expert who explained how the States had all abandoned the
position that he was taking.
QUESTION: But he had no authority to change the
rules. It had to be done by the legislature.
MR. ARCENEAUX: But he had to initiate the
process.
QUESTION: You said, I thought, that you
wouldn't have to deal with the legislature at all, but
here it had to be passed by the legislature.
MR. ARCENEAUX: That's correct, but we don't
believe that in looking at the causation analysis we need
to look at what the legislature did. It is not the
legislature that made the decision to change the rule.
QUESTION: Well, I'm amazed that you say that.
I would have thought that anything the legislature
enacted, you would say the legislature made a decision to
enact it. Do you think not?
MR. ARCENEAUX: Clearly they did, Your Honor.
QUESTION: Okay, well, how do you get from the
fire marshal's change of mind to the legislature's
legislation? What's the interim step?
MR. ARCENEAUX: The unique process of the
rulemaking process that's in West Virginia. These rules
are just all batched. Hundreds of agencies all --
QUESTION: Just tell me what -- tell us what
happened in this case. What happened? What did the fire
marshal do?
MR. ARCENEAUX: And all of the exhibits that are
attached to our motion for attorney's fees has this all
documented in it.
QUESTION: Okay, but we want to know here and
now.
MR. ARCENEAUX: Yes. The fire marshal changed
his mind, made a decision to promulgate these new rules.
He has to go to the fire commission and then the fire
commission presents it to the legislature.
QUESTION: Well, is that what he did?
MR. ARCENEAUX: Yes.
QUESTION: Did he go to the fire commission and
said, I want to change these rules?
MR. ARCENEAUX: Yes.
QUESTION: And the fire commission says, we
agree, we will change these rules?
MR. ARCENEAUX: Yes.
QUESTION: And the fire commission then did
what?
MR. ARCENEAUX: Then the fire commission has to
promulgate the new rules, and then they submit them to the
legislature.
QUESTION: And what --
MR. ARCENEAUX: There's a special committee.
QUESTION: Was the legislation that was passed
in effect the verbatim embodiment of what the fire
commission proposed?
MR. ARCENEAUX: I believe that to be the case,
and that is why I referred to the legislature in this
process as merely a rubber stamp.
QUESTION: Now, do you think the fire
commissioner changed his mind because he was afraid of
losing the lawsuit, or because he was persuaded that it
was a good idea?
MR. ARCENEAUX: We think he was motivated by the
lawsuit.
QUESTION: Can you prove that? Is there any
possible way of proving it?
MR. ARCENEAUX: Well, as some of the courts have
noted -- I don't know what is in his mind.
QUESTION: Exactly. That's the problem.
MR. ARCENEAUX: Yes.
QUESTION: What if your lawsuit -- what if he
had nothing to do with the lawsuit. It may be against his
agency, but he happens to read about the lawsuit in the
paper and he says, this -- what, this is an outrageous
thing. You mean, that's what our rules say? And then,
motivated by your lawsuit, okay, he does the same thing
you said he's done here and gets the rule changed. Does
that make your case a catalyst? I guess it does, in a
sense.
MR. ARCENEAUX: Well, we have two distinctions
that I would draw. One is, he knew about the case, and he
was deposed in the case. He was active. He attended
every deposition, so it's not like he's sitting back in
his office, okay, and the -- I've lost my second point,
but also there is this intervening deposition of our
expert that he's in attendance and he hears what they have
to say.
Unlike the regular --
QUESTION: Instead of reading it in the paper.
I mean, what difference would that -- I don't see what
difference it makes.
MR. ARCENEAUX: Well, most of the cases that
I've seen where they talk about the legislature -- and
there are some cases that are simple. Some cases they
have found, and it's right there in the legislative
history, they enacted this provision -- Paris is an
example, where they say in the legislative history, we
don't have documented legislative history. What we're
saying is, there should not be a per se rule just when the
legislature acts that we cannot then present our evidence.
The second thing is, unlike a lot of the
legislative cases, when they talk about the legislative
cases they talk about intervening causation, that here is
some third party that has taken the lawsuit away, the
legislature has acted.
We don't believe there's any intervening
causation here, because we were suing the fire commission
and the fire marshal, and they're the ones that made the
decision to change this.
QUESTION: Do you rely at all on your warding
off the cease and desist order?
MR. ARCENEAUX: Yes.
QUESTION: Which, if you had done nothing would
have surely followed, and then you would have been the
object of an adverse judgment.
MR. ARCENEAUX: Yes, and we believe that we
prevailed. We were under cease and desist orders, and the
homes were going to be shut down, and all the residents
were going to be thrown out, and we presented expert
testimony -- these were clients that were 102 years old,
and that they could suffer transfer trauma just by the
very act of them being moved into another home. We went
in on a TRO. We were able to obtain an agreed order.
That agreed order remained in place for the duration of
the litigation, and no one was ever thrown out of the
home. The homes were never shut down.
QUESTION: Well, my goodness, you don't become a
prevailing party by getting a preliminary order just
leaving the status quo in effect while the case is being
adjudicated. I mean, is that all it takes to prevail?
MR. ARCENEAUX: We think that it is part. We
understand that it was only a interim relief.
QUESTION: Does it matter to your case whether
the fire -- whatever it is, the fire marshal's judgment,
or for that matter the legislature's judgment, was based
on the fact that they thought the law was outrageous, as
distinct from the fact that they may not have wanted to
take a hit by losing this case? Does it matter one way or
the other?
MR. ARCENEAUX: Well, we think that our lawsuit
brought that to their attention.
QUESTION: But that's not my question. Does it
matter, on your theory --
MR. ARCENEAUX: I think we have to show --
QUESTION: -- whether they simply said, we're
suddenly aware of the law and we think it's bad and it
ought to be changed, or on the other hand they say, we
think the law is great, but we don't want to lose this
lawsuit, so we're going to change the law? Does it matter
to your case?
MR. ARCENEAUX: I think that it would relate to
the causal relationship. We do recognize that we would
have to establish a causal relationship, so in your one we
may not be able to do so.
QUESTION: But why isn't --
MR. ARCENEAUX: Your Honor --
QUESTION: Why isn't -- each case why isn't
there a causal relationship? That's what I don't
understand. I think he's trying to help you, in other
words. I don't think you realize that.
QUESTION: I really was.
(Laughter.)
MR. ARCENEAUX: Maybe I'm --
QUESTION: I'm with you. I think he was trying
to hurt you.
(Laughter.)
MR. ARCENEAUX: Maybe I was just distracted by
the light. I was going to --
QUESTION: Isn't there causation in either case?
MR. ARCENEAUX: Yes.
QUESTION: The one cause, the lawsuit brings it
to the attention, but for the lawsuit it would not have
come to the attention, it wouldn't have been changed.
In the other case, there's a different chain of
causation, but it's still the same causation. They say,
in order to avoid losing, we get rid of the lawsuit. Is
causation in each case?
MR. ARCENEAUX: Yes, I agree.
QUESTION: Then why not, just reading about it
in the papers, the legislators read about this lawsuit,
and but for this lawsuit they would never have known about
this outrageous law, and that's enough, right?
MR. ARCENEAUX: Yes. We think --
QUESTION: The fire marshal had nothing to do
with it. He never ran to the legislature. They just read
about it in the paper.
MR. ARCENEAUX: That would be a different case.
QUESTION: I know it would be a different case,
but why would it be different as far as your claim is
concerned?
MR. ARCENEAUX: We think as long as we have the
opportunity to establish causation we should be able to do
so.
QUESTION: And that's causation. They would not
have known about this thing except, because of your
lawsuit, it gets in the papers. They read about it, they
think, gee, that's a stupid law, let's change it.
MR. ARCENEAUX: Your Honor, may I reserve the
remainder of my time for rebuttal?
QUESTION: Very well, Mr. Arceneaux.
Ms. Brinkmann, we'll hear from you.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BETH S. BRINKMANN
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS
MS. BRINKMANN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
The categorical rule adopted by the court of
appeals that allows fees only in a case where there is a
judgment, consent decree, or settlement, is contrary to
the text, history, and purpose of the civil rights fee-
shifting statutes. That rule would deny fees in the most
meritorious case that directly obtains all of the relief
sought in that case if the defendant on the eve of trial
complies with the demand without a court order.
QUESTION: In this case, was the matter moot as
a matter of Article III jurisdiction, so the judge had no
choice, or would the judge have had some discretion to
retain jurisdiction to enter some sort of declaratory
relief?
MS. BRINKMANN: It appears, Your Honor, that it
was, in fact, moot because of a legislative change under
this Court's standards in Laidlaw and City of Mesquite.
There's such a minuscule likelihood that that law would be
changed back.
The plaintiff did contest mootness at the trial
court level --
QUESTION: I take it the usual rule is that it
must be absolutely clear that the alleged wrongful conduct
cannot recur before the case can be dismissed, is that the
way the rule works?
MS. BRINKMANN: Yes, for mootness, Your Honor.
That's under the Laidlaw case from last term and also the
City of Mesquite case, that's correct.
QUESTION: Could the plaintiff here have asked
for nominal damages in order to keep the case alive?
MS. BRINKMANN: No, Your Honor, because this is
Ex parte Young case against State officials enforcing a
law.
QUESTION: Oh, okay.
MS. BRINKMANN: That's often the situation.
Also, there are several statutes that we cite in a
footnote of our brief that limit relief in civil rights
cases to injunctive relief, and those are often the most
important kinds of cases that the fee-shifting statutes
are intended to get at, where a plaintiff has a
meritorious claim for injunctive relief to enforce a civil
rights law, but does not have the money to pay an
attorney, and no possibility of a damages relief that
could perhaps pay those attorneys' fees.
The court of appeals' categorical rule
undermines that.
QUESTION: Ms. Brinkmann, what if I were a
member of the West Virginia legislature and I know this
suit has been pending for a long time, and they have hired
very expensive lawyers to sue the State, there's a lot of
money involved, and I would really -- I think this is a
dumb law that's on the books, and I would really like to
change that law, but then the fire marshal comes to me and
he says, you know, if you change that law, the State is
going to be liable for millions of dollars in attorneys'
fees, because it will be held that the suit was the
catalyst for the change, and we'll have to pay all this
money.
Why would we want to distort the legislative
process in West Virginia by making a change in the law
that the members of the legislature think desirable costly
because of the existence of a lawsuit, even though the
State believes it can win the lawsuit?
MS. BRINKMANN: A couple of --
QUESTION: They don't think they're going to
lose. They just say, if we change the law because it's a
bad law, we're going to have to pay all this money in
attorneys' fees.
MS. BRINKMANN: A couple of responses, Your
Honor. First of all, I just want to make clear that, of
course, the catalyst rule does not just apply to
legislative change, and also a point I want to get to
later that it also applies in settlements and consent
decree cases, but talking about the application of that to
a situation in which there is a legislative change that
would -- the legislature would want to make as a matter of
policy, there are several approaches that the defendant
has available.
First of all, the defendant has it within his
control, if they make that decision promptly, to avoid the
build-up of attorneys' fees. Indeed, that's what often
happens in Government cases. The most meritorious of
claim may come in. There may be a settlement within a
week.
QUESTION: I understand.
MS. BRINKMANN: In addition to that, the
defendant is able to defend against the causation and the
merits issue in this type of litigation. For example, if
the legislature has another reason, they were already
considering it, policy reasons, the plaintiff will not be
able to establish causation.
QUESTION: Do you have to show, in order to
establish the causation you're talking about, that the
legislature made the change because it knew it would lose
the lawsuit? Is that a condition, you have to show that
the legislature made the change because it realized that
its law was contrary to Federal law?
MS. BRINKMANN: No. You would have to show that
the claim was not meritless. Our proposition is --
QUESTION: Ah, well --
MS. BRINKMANN: -- that you would have to show
that the merit -- that --
QUESTION: So they could have changed it for a
reason that has nothing to do with their -- with the
lawsuit, except that the lawsuit brought the matter to
their attention, even though they weren't worried about
losing the lawsuit.
MS. BRINKMANN: That would not --
QUESTION: They knew they could win the lawsuit.
MS. BRINKMANN: That would not establish the
causation requirement, and I want to --
QUESTION: Wait, that -- it --
QUESTION: Why wouldn't it, Ms. Brinkmann?
MS. BRINKMANN: Because it would not establish
that that change was made as a result of the lawsuit.
There's two aspects of the causation, Mr. Chief
Justice. There's the causation as a matter of fact, but
then there's also the question more of a proximate
causation, that that change has to be because of the
claim, not because of the nuisance value of the lawsuit,
for example. That's why there is -- the lower courts have
always applied the type of frivolousness standard, and we
suggest it should be a standard where you state a claim
upon which relief could be granted.
And if I could, Your Honor, I want to really
make the point clear that that is the same standard the
courts currently, and have for a long time, applied to
cases involving consent decrees and settlements. There's
no reason to treat this case differently because --
QUESTION: Well, except that the statute says,
prevailing party, and it's quite logical, I think, to read
the term, prevailing party, as meaning that you should
have something to show from the lawsuit itself.
MS. BRINKMANN: And you do have something to
show in these cases. You obtained the relief that you
sought. In this particular case, you have a law to
enforce, a regulation to enforce --
QUESTION: Yes, but it's not a part of any
decree.
MS. BRINKMANN: No, Your Honor, and in a
settlement, it is very analogous to a settlement and a
consent decree.
QUESTION: Yes, but except that a typical
settlement, you'll get some document from the court.
MS. BRINKMANN: But it's simply a contract, Your
Honor, just as the law here, a separate lawsuit would have
to be brought to enforce that, in fact, under this Court's
opinion in Kincannon, it's not even clear there would be a
Federal cause of action to enforce that.
Moreover, even --
QUESTION: If you get a settlement approved by
the court, the court will enforce that settlement, won't
it?
MS. BRINKMANN: As your opinion explains --
QUESTION: So you really have to prevail. You
have some judicial power behind that contract. It's just
a contract, but this is one that the Court is behind.
MS. BRINKMANN: But, Your Honor, it depends. If
the court incorporates that, otherwise you just have a
contract. You have to go prove the validity of that
contract. Here, they have a cease and desist order that
was pending against them before the lawsuit that can no
longer be enforced. They have a statute and a regulation
they can enforce.
I also want to point out that in both the
consent decree and settlement situations, there is no
requirement of a determination of any violation of law,
any determination of liability. In fact, as this Court
repeatedly has recognized, that's one of the motivations
for settlements, consent decrees, to be able to resolve
the case without an admission of liability.
QUESTION: Ms. Brinkmann, correct me if I'm
wrong, I think there's a difference between your position
and Mr. Arceneaux's. As I understood his argument, it
would be enough if the legislature learned about this bad
law through the lawsuit, and you insist that the
legislature must have changed the law because it was
worried about losing the lawsuit?
MS. BRINKMANN: No, Your Honor, I'm sorry.
QUESTION: No?
MS. BRINKMANN: I must have misspoken.
QUESTION: Okay.
MS. BRINKMANN: I thought your question to me
was a situation in which there were other policy reasons
that the legislature had taken into account to change the
law. If the lawsuit is a factual causation for the
relief, the relief is something that the plaintiff sought,
and if the claim is not meritless, that does meet the
standard for --
QUESTION: Even if the legislature just read
about it in the newspapers?
MS. BRINKMANN: If it --
QUESTION: That's a factual predicate. That's
how they learned about it, and it was not a meritless
lawsuit, and that's all that's needed?
MS. BRINKMANN: If the lawsuit brought that
about. I have to emphasize --
QUESTION: We'd have to read the Palzgraf case
in order for this all to work out?
(Laughter.)
MS. BRINKMANN: Proximate causation does come to
mind, Your Honor, when we talk about the fact that it
cannot be a frivolous or a meritless claim --
QUESTION: But it sounds like but-for causation,
not proximate cause, that you're talking about.
MS. BRINKMANN: Well, I think, Your Honor,
that --
QUESTION: Why wouldn't that enable an astute
lawyer to kind of spot administrative or legislative
changes in the offing and file some suit so they can run
in and get some kind of attorney's fees?
MS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, the lower courts
have rejected just those types of claims --
QUESTION: You don't object to tough causation
requirements?
MS. BRINKMANN: No, Your Honor.
QUESTION: All right.
MS. BRINKMANN: We believe that that's the
meaning of the statute --
QUESTION: And you respect Justice Scalia's
practical point, which I thought was correct, isn't it?
It's a correct point that sometimes the legislature would
be in just the situation he mentioned. I wonder if that's
neatly counterbalanced by what I would think would be a
worse problem the other way, namely, the plaintiff has to
fight to the last ditch, because if -- he can never
settle, because if he doesn't push his most unreasonable
claim, he won't get any attorneys' fees.
MS. BRINKMANN: Exactly, Your Honor.
QUESTION: That also is a practical problem,
isn't it?
MS. BRINKMANN: Exactly, Your Honor.
QUESTION: Is it a practical problem also for
the legislature to be caught in what I'd call a formal
settlement, with a Government department? I've seen a few
of those, and if the only way you get attorneys' fees is
to force the court to enter some kind of complex
settlement decree, is it clear what happens later in State
government? I mean, I've seen an awful lot where the
legislature feels bound by a settlement decree of private
parties, with a separate -- do you see my problem? I
don't know if it's a practical problem, but I'd like you
to comment on it.
MS. BRINKMANN: I'm not sure I understand your
question.
QUESTION: If you recover only if a there's a
piece of paper called, settlement, that means there are
words on a piece of paper --
MS. BRINKMANN: Yes.
QUESTION: -- filed in court, those words can
sometimes extend to thousands of pages, and legislatures
and Governments don't like to be subject to such decrees.
MS. BRINKMANN: That's absolutely correct, and
this is the most efficient -- may I respond to that --
QUESTION: No, I think that's enough, Ms.
Brinkmann.
MS. BRINKMANN: Thank you, Your Honor.
QUESTION: We'll hear from you, Mr. Cleek.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID P. CLEEK
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. CLEEK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please
the Court:
Let me say at the outset I want to respond to a
couple of the remarks that have been made in the arguments
by counsel for the United States and also for the
petitioner's counsel. It was an inaccuracy, and I'm
certain an inadvertent inaccuracy, by counsel that this is
an Ex parte Young situation where you only have injunctive
relief requested. There was actually a demand in this
case for punitive damages and compensatory damages, and
that claim was voluntarily dropped by the plaintiff.
Now, in response to Justice Kennedy's
question --
QUESTION: May I just ask for a clarification?
I thought that to the extent that the action was against
the State, it couldn't be brought, you couldn't get
damages. The only thing you could get against the State
was injunctive relief.
MR. CLEEK: That's right. The damage claims
would have been against the individuals in their personal
capacities.
QUESTION: And is -- that would be rather
strange, wouldn't it, to say these officials, who were
clearly acting in their official capacity in having a fire
code and a cease and desist order, that they were doing
something in their personal capacities?
MR. CLEEK: I believe, Your Honor, that that's
the only way a damage claim could have been returned in
this case, in view of the rule of the Eleventh Amendment,
and nonetheless those claims were made, punitive and
compensatory damage claims were made in the original
complaint and the amended complaint.
I should also point out to the Court that, with
regard to the issue of the --
QUESTION: And on what ground were they
dismissed?
MR. CLEEK: They were dismissed by a voluntary
action of the plaintiff. I don't know the motivation for
that.
QUESTION: You hadn't put in a defense to it?
MR. CLEEK: To the damage claims?
QUESTION: Yes.
MR. CLEEK: Those had not been addressed, Your
Honor. As a matter of fact, as I recall, with regard to
the discovery in this case, the only people who had been
deposed were two persons from the fire commission, the
fire marshal and an assistant, and some experts.
QUESTION: I mean, an answer. I mean, you said
they made a complaint that included a request for punitive
damages and compensatory damages --
MR. CLEEK: Yes, Your Honor.
QUESTION: -- against the defendants.
Defendants put an answer in --
MR. CLEEK: Yes, ma'am.
QUESTION: -- to that claim?
MR. CLEEK: Yes, Your Honor.
QUESTION: And what was the answer?
MR. CLEEK: We denied that there was -- it was a
denial that there were any damages due.
QUESTION: On what ground, because this was a
claim about State action.
MR. CLEEK: There was an Eleventh Amendment
defense asserted, but with regard to those damage claims,
I assumed, from reading the complaint, that they were
against individuals in their personal capacity, otherwise
they couldn't be returnable against the State.
QUESTION: I don't want to deflect you on this,
but to the extent that they were seeking injunctive relief
it was a pure Ex parte Young case?
MR. CLEEK: Yes, Your Honor, that's correct, and
let me respond for a moment about the issue about the
intrusion into legislative prerogative here that this
catalyst theory may engender.
Mr. Arceneaux, the petitioner's counsel, on page
44 and 45 of the initial brief in this case, sets out that
if he is entitled to review in front of the district
court, some theory under the catalyst theory that he's --
he motivated by his lawsuit the State to take some
voluntary action here, he suggests in his initial brief
that the legislative enactment would be part of his
inquiry.
In his reply brief, for the first time, he
suggests that that's not going to happen, and that it's
going to be an agency issue, and the legislature will not
be addressed. For the first time in the reply brief we
also find that petitioners have suggested that they
prevailed because they got this agreed order. That's
never been a demand to the district court for attorneys'
fees in any case.
QUESTION: Mr. Cleek, Mr. Arceneaux was queried
extensively about some of the practical problems with his
position. What about the practical problems with yours?
What do you do about the agency that is really guilty as
sin, and they're going to lose this case. They know
they're going to lose it, so after dancing the plaintiff
around for several years, causing great expense in
attorneys' fees, when the case is about to come up for
judgment, they just fold, and revise the regulation that's
been under challenge -- don't enter a settlement, they
just revise the regulation that's under challenge.
MR. CLEEK: There are two means --
QUESTION: Attorneys' fees payable? No.
MR. CLEEK: Two means to address that issue,
Your Honor. Firstly, if the district court decides that
the voluntary action that ceases whatever activity there
is --
QUESTION: Yes.
MR. CLEEK: -- just enforcement of this
regulation, or whatever, does not moot the case, then you
can proceed to merits.
QUESTION: Oh, no, it moots the case. That's
why they do it. They do it to moot the case.
MR. CLEEK: In that case, that is the one area
in which it would appear that unless Congress has approved
the catalyst theory, assuming the catalyst theory is the
only means of addressing that mootness issue, unless
Congress has approved the catalyst theory, there's no
relief there.
QUESTION: Okay.
QUESTION: The problem goes one step further,
doesn't it, because we have indicated that settlements may
qualify, a settled case may have a prevailing party within
the meaning of the rule, and I would suppose that if you
prevail in any case in which the settlement would
otherwise give the plaintiff the relief that the plaintiff
was seeking, there just won't be any more settlements.
There will simply be the voluntary provision of the
relief, whether it be affirmative, or the cessation of
something the plaintiff is objecting to, and we're not
going to get any more settlement cases in instances in
which the plaintiff ends up getting what the plaintiff
wants.
MR. CLEEK: Your Honor, this Court has
recognized in Maher and Farrar as well, and also it's
indicated in the legislative history, that settlements
constitute prevailing party status.
Now, if your question is, if the State or any
governmental body can simply say, we're going to stop, and
not enter into an enforceable agreement, is that going to
prevent settlements? As a matter of judicial policy, of
course, settlements are preferred. Would it cut down on
them? There's the possibility, but I think --
QUESTION: Well, it's not going to cut down on
settlements in which in effect they in some ways split the
difference, but when, in fact, you have a case that
traditionally would have resulted in a settlement, there
would be an orderly process, they'd sign a neither party
docket marking, whatever, and give it to the judge, the
judge would approve it, and the defendant agrees in that
kind -- in a settled case to provide exactly what the
plaintiff wants, there'll be no more settlements.
So it won't affect the split-the-difference
settlement, but it will affect the give-them-what-they-
ask-for settlement.
MR. CLEEK: It could affect, in candor, a
settlement where a regulation is involved or where a
policy is involved, because in that case it is arguable
that the governmental body could simply stop the conduct
and moot the case.
QUESTION: Well, how many settlements are you
aware of that are not split-the-difference settlements? I
mean, what advantage is there to entering into a
settlement if you're coughing up everything that the
plaintiff has asked for?
MR. CLEEK: Your Honor --
QUESTION: In my experience, at least, when you
sign a settlement agreement you get something in exchange
for that settlement agreement. If you're just going to
cut and run, just cut and run and save the attorneys' fees
in drafting the settlement agreement.
MR. CLEEK: I have been litigating these cases
for 27 years, even before the Attorneys' Fees Act, and I
have not had the occasion to see any cases where they
weren't --
QUESTION: Well, isn't this such a case?
QUESTION: You're in such a case.
QUESTION: Isn't this an example of that case?
MR. CLEEK: This is an example of it --
QUESTION: The State totally abandoned its
position.
MR. CLEEK: Yes. It's an example of the worst
that can happen under a circumstance where there's an
argument, at least, to be made by someone who suggests
that there was a but-for element of the Government's
action that is related to the lawsuit.
This case that you have before you is the kind
of case that suggests that there ought to be some other
avenue to address a case where some voluntary action moots
the case. However, if Congress hasn't provided for that,
Justice Stevens, then it doesn't exist and, as the Court
pointed out earlier, if you connect these fee-shifting
statutes in any action a prevailing party may be entitled
to fees, it has to be within the action. We're talking
here, Your Honor, about a nonparty who takes the action.
QUESTION: Well, if you say -- if we're at that
point, that is, if you agree -- given your answer to
Justice Scalia I think you do agree that if you look at
the practicalities, for every bad thing you can find one
side you can find a bad thing the other side. We can
match example for example. Then you're back to the
language.
All right, what about the language? Prevailing
party covers their case literally. Then you have Farrar,
which favors you. Then you have, I take it, Hewitt, which
uses an example of where you could recover where there is,
quote, a change in conduct that redresses the plaintiff's
grievances, and then we have the statutory legislative
history where they define in the House report, prevailing
party, they say, a court should still award fees where,
after a complaint is filed, a defendant might voluntarily
cease the unlawful practice.
All right. Is that it? It seems to me we now
have the whole case, and you have to balance the
practicalities and decide whether you're going to give
credit to that House report. Is that right?
MR. CLEEK: Your Honor, you're quite right. The
House report refers to the voluntary cessation of an
unlawful act. Obviously, if Government quits a lawful
act, even if it's accused -- even if the allegation is
it's an improper act, then attorneys' fees would not be
appropriate. Where an unlawful act is used there, this
Court has repeatedly, from Hanrahan, to Hewitt, to Farrar,
said -- and Hewitt says this as well, by the use of
ordinary language, prevailing party means that you must
get some success on the merits. The catalyst theory
doesn't provide for that.
QUESTION: What about the House report? I took
it that Hewitt and the House report in particular are
thinking of the case where a complaint is filed charging X
as unlawful, and before there is an adjudication the
defendant ceases the unlawful practice, and it says in
that instance the Court should still award fees, even
though it concludes that no formal relief is necessary.
Now, as I read that report, I thought it
certainly favors your opponents, and then the question
would be whether this Court should credit it. Now, I'm
asking you that because I want to -- you know, I want you
to point out why I'm wrong, if I'm wrong.
MR. CLEEK: Your Honor, I think that you're
wrong for this reason. The whole background for 1988, and
of course we're interpreting the two statutes here for
prevailing party considerations based on 1988, the whole
background for 1988 is Alyeska. The United States
district courts don't have equity power to give attorneys'
fees, so Congress must explicitly set out what the
parameters of that power is and describe, pick who gets
it. Congress decided in this case prevailing parties got
it.
Now, the House report does refer to informal
relief, but the informal relief, Your Honor, could be a
settlement. The informal relief could be a consent
decree.
QUESTION: Mr. Cleek, I'm not --
QUESTION: Well, in looking -- right in this,
where it says voluntarily ceasing, I didn't think it was
formal, but then I thought many of these statutes were
passed at a time where civil rights violations all over
the country were common, and many of the statutes were
passed to end widespread violations of civil rights.
Now, with that in the back of my mind, would I
think that Congress would want plaintiffs to get their
attorneys' fees where they led to the cessation of civil
rights violations? I would think yes. But that's a
general comment, and I want you to respond to that, to
correct me if I'm wrong about that.
MR. CLEEK: All right, sir. Let me respond in
this manner. The Hewitt case does suggest, particularly
in declaratory judgment case, that a voluntary change that
affords the relief might make the person prevailing in
that circumstance. I believe that Hewitt has to be read
with the other cases that this Court has considered, from
Hanrahan to Hewitt, and including Hewitt, that say you
must get success on the merits.
Now, that voluntary change, success on the
merits, and then we have Texas Teachers v. Garland two
years later that says there must be a material alteration
of the legal relationship of the parties, and then Farrar,
that says it must be formalized in some fashion, all those
must be read together.
If you read Hewitt by itself, it does support an
argument for the other side. I can't deny that. But
Hewitt must be read with all of these other
considerations, and when you read it with all those other
considerations, it does not support the catalyst --
QUESTION: Mr. Cleek, I'm not a big fan of
attributing a House report to the entire Congress. I
would much rather look to the language of the statute, but
isn't it -- if you look to the reports, isn't it possible
that when whoever wrote it was speaking about voluntary
cessation of the unlawful conduct, he was talking about
voluntary cessation of conduct acknowledged to be
unlawful, that there's a difference between ceasing it
because oh, yeah, you got us, and we'll -- you know, I
agree that this was wrong, and ceasing it because, my God,
this lawsuit is going to cost us another $2 million, it is
simply not worth it?
By the way, I'm not sure whether that makes the
lawsuit a catalyst or not. It probably does. You know,
there's something to the claim, but it's just not worth
fighting it for another 3 years and $2 million in fees.
Let's throw in the towel, forget about it, even though I
think what we're doing is lawful. I suppose that would be
a catalyst.
But can't you read the House reports as meaning
voluntary cessation of conduct acknowledged to be
unlawful?
MR. CLEEK: Your Honor, I think that you can do
that, and as a matter of fact it makes eminent good sense,
because otherwise the use of unlawful would have been
unnecessary.
QUESTION: But the dividing line that you put
with a settlement -- now, a settlement, many of these
settlements, am I not right, say, I don't admit that I did
one thing wrong, but I'm settling this lawsuit, and the
Congress would make a distinction between that kind of
settlement just because it's on a piece of paper filed in
court, where the defendant said, I am paying the plaintiff
out of the goodness of my heart, but we were never any
wrongdoers. We never violated any law. That counts for
the catalyst, because it's a settlement, and then to say
if the same exact thing happens, it doesn't count, that
seems irrational to me.
MR. CLEEK: Your Honor, that argument has been
made by the petitioners and their amici in this case, and
what I think you're suggesting is, if you have a
settlement that Congress has recognized and this Court has
recognized grants prevailing party status, then if you
have a voluntary act that affords the same sort of relief,
how is that any different.
The difference is this. A settlement, of
course, clearly, obviously, is tied to a litigation. We
don't need to have district courts deciding whether 52
legislators met by their action --
QUESTION: Well, that means that the causation
problem is not a problem. The causation problem is not a
problem, but it doesn't strike it out if there is -- this
case is difficult because of the legislative action, but
there are other cases where it's just as clear that the
plaintiff propelled this action on the part of defendant.
MR. CLEEK: Your Honor, the only way I can
respond to that sensibly is that Congress had the right to
choose. They chose settlement.
QUESTION: Why couldn't you respond to it by
saying that where you have a written settlement you don't
have to acknowledge liability because the written
settlement is what ties it to the litigation? Where you
don't have that tie to litigation, the only thing that
could possibly tie it to the litigation is the
acknowledgement that the litigation was correct.
The acknowledgement, since you don't have a
written settlement, that, indeed, our action was unlawful
and therefore we're going to stop it, at least that ties
it to the litigation somehow.
MR. CLEEK: That would be correct.
QUESTION: Whereas just stopping it, without any
acknowledgement that what you were doing was wrong, you
have no idea whether the litigation was what produced it,
or whether the West Virginia legislature just decided this
was a stupid law, which is frankly what I think it
thought.
MR. CLEEK: Your Honor, and let me follow up
that with this comment. If Congress, when it enacted
1988, understood the difficulties that the courts faced in
controlling their dockets, and congested dockets, if they
understood the difficulties that this catalyst theory
might present in this kind of case, where you may be
having the legislators' motives inquired into, and
depositions of those officials, if Congress understood
that, and if Congress appreciated those problems as well
as what we have in circuit courts -- we have all sorts of
different requirements for proving catalyst theory, from
provocative in the First Circuit --
QUESTION: May I interrupt you, Mr. Cleek?
Let's assume there's a special problem when you have to
prove it through a legislature, but as I understand your
position, you would take precisely the same position if
the fire marshal had had the authority on his own to
change the regulation and just not say anything about it.
You'd still say there's no entitlement to fees.
MR. CLEEK: Yes, I would.
QUESTION: Isn't that right?
MR. CLEEK: Yes, I would, and the reason, Your
Honor, is, that I believe --
QUESTION: So that it is not important for us to
decide whether the legislature has to be involved, because
your theory doesn't really depend on legislative action.
It just happens to be what is true of this case.
MR. CLEEK: I think, Your Honor, that the only
reason this Court should address the legislative
difficulties and the concerns about intrusions into the
motivations of legislators is that that is such an
important issue that if the Court accepts the catalyst
theory that if there's an exception to be made for that
area, then it ought to be made, but with regard to your
first question about whether or not, if the fire marshal
had simply changed the rule and been motivated by the
lawsuit there would have been recovery, the answer is
still no, because the catalyst theory is not recognized,
in our view, under the prevailing party designation in
1988 or any of the other fee-shifting statutes. It does
not include --
QUESTION: No, I understand your position. I'm
just suggesting your position really doesn't require a
legislature to be involved in order to have a valid
objection to the fees, but I don't really get, except you
say we ought to read a lot of other cases, what is your
response to the rather clear language in the Helms case
that a monetary settlement or a change in conduct that
redresses the plaintiff's grievances, when that occurs,
the plaintiff is deemed to have prevailed despite the
absence of a formal judgment in his favor.
I mean, it seems to me that reads on this case.
There's a fact question, of course, but it certainly
doesn't say there's got to be a settlement. It says,
despite the absence of a formal judgment, and it doesn't
require a settlement or a change in conduct that redresses
the plaintiff's grievances. You just say we should
abandon that language.
MR. CLEEK: No, Your Honor, I'm not suggesting
that at all, and I think that I addressed that issue
earlier with --
QUESTION: You say read a lot of other cases and
read it in context, is what your answer is.
MR. CLEEK: That is the only means that I can
address that language and explain it. That language
suggests that you would prevail if there was a voluntary
change by the defendant in the course of the litigation.
The only way that I can respond to that is to suggest what
I suggested to Justice Breyer's question, is that all
these cases must be read in context. If you isolate that
language out, then you have difficulty.
QUESTION: Wasn't that language dicta?
MR. CLEEK: It was, Your Honor. It was not
necessary for the resolution of that case.
And let me say this about Hewitt, and Your
Honor, of course, this is perhaps suggesting hypotheticals
one ought to be entertaining from the Court, but if we
took Hewitt out, let's assume that Hewitt never happened,
and you read Hanrahan and Hensley and Rhodes and Texas
Teachers and Farrar, there is no support in any of those
cases for the catalyst theory. The only support --
QUESTION: Well, it wasn't at issue. It wasn't
at issue in Farrar. There was a judgment. There was a
judgment, but it was just for $1, so anything that Farrar
said would have been the clearest dictum, because there
was a prevailing party, not by much, and there were no
fees, because the Court said, I'm not going to give you
attorneys' fees for a $1 judgment.
MR. CLEEK: That's correct, Your Honor.
QUESTION: But there was no doubt that there was
a prevailing party in that case.
MR. CLEEK: In fact, this Court found that they
were a prevailing party because even the $1 caused a
change in the legal relationship between the parties,
because the defendant had to pay something to the
plaintiff he otherwise wouldn't have had to pay, but
Farrar still -- and you know, if we have dicta in Hewitt,
and dicta in Farrar, both sides are arguing that they have
some value, but if we look at Farrar just for the purpose
of establishing what this Court said is a definition of
the parameters of prevailing party, if we look at it just
for that purpose alone, then I think that the argument
that we made that it's not consistent with the catalyst
theory is very easily made and very easily understood.
Now, if the Court was willing to say --
QUESTION: Well, I thought you accepted that
this Court had said in Friends of the Earth that the
catalyst theory remained an open question and that Farrar
did not deal with it. That's what the Court said in
Friends of the Earth, and I didn't think --
MR. CLEEK: Yes.
QUESTION: -- you were quarreling with that.
MR. CLEEK: I'm not quarreling with that. The
language is clear in Friends of the Earth that Farrar was
not a catalyst case, and I'm not arguing that Farrar was a
catalyst case. What I'm arguing is that Farrar set out
parameters for prevailing party which has to be utilized
by this Court and analyzed in any sort of attorneys' fees
matter before the Court.
So we have --
QUESTION: -- simply whether or not someone who
received the nominal damages a prevailing party?
MR. CLEEK: That's correct, Your Honor.
QUESTION: Okay.
MR. CLEEK: And the Court found that they were a
prevailing party --
QUESTION: And the holding below was that they
were not a prevailing party?
MR. CLEEK: That's correct and, of course, the
Court continued to say that under those circumstances,
even to be given that designation was insufficient to
award fees, because there were just some cases where there
was no entitlement.
QUESTION: Refresh my memory. In Farrar, did
they affirm or reverse the judgment?
MR. CLEEK: You reversed the lower court, I
believe, Your Honor.
QUESTION: We held there was a prevailing party,
but didn't we say there were no fees that were due?
MR. CLEEK: That's correct, and I think what the
lower court had said, that there wasn't prevailing party
status, that's my recollection, and there was some
difference there. We had -- essentially the lower court
had found that there were no fees, no entitlement to fees
and, of course, Farrar found that there were no
entitlement to fees as well.
If there are no further questions --
QUESTION: The lower court found no entitlement,
why? I don't recall that. Why did the lower court find
no entitlement?
MR. CLEEK: It seems to me, Your Honor, in
Farrar that --
QUESTION: Because not a prevailing party.
MR. CLEEK: Right, that it was just such a --
QUESTION: And we found no entitlement because
why? We found it was a prevailing party, but no
entitlement because of --
QUESTION: Didn't prevail enough.
(Laughter.)
QUESTION: No, we found that they were a
prevailing party but there was nominal damages, so the
attorneys' fees were reduced. There were -- the court
awarded $1 --
MR. CLEEK: It was a de minimis --
QUESTION: -- and we said it was not because
they were not a prevailing party, but rather that it was
nominal damages.
MR. CLEEK: That's correct.
QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Cleek.
MR. CLEEK: Thank you, Your Honor.
Mr. Arceneaux, you have 2 minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WEBSTER J. ARCENEAUX, III
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. ARCENEAUX: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
Mr. Cleek was assuming a hypothetical. I want
to assume a hypothetical for the Court as well.
Let us assume this Court does not accept the
catalyst theory. This Court is concerned with the issue
of administration of justice, and I am concerned that if
this Court does not accept the catalyst theory, then the
game's been shifted we talked about that Justice Scalia
pointed out, where a defendant that might be incredibly
guilty on the eve of trial, after the plaintiff has
incurred a lot of expenses, can moot the case out.
On the other hand, there may be motivation on
the plaintiff's part to start engaging in gamesmanship.
We recognize that once we had the consent or the agreed
order, we did not have damages. The home wasn't shut
down, the people weren't thrown out, we had no damages, so
we stipulated to take damages out of it.
Had we known that this rule might have jumped up
at us, we might have thought otherwise about the damages
issue, so there can be gamesmanship on both sides if we
don't have the catalyst theory.
We think -- and one of the points that seems to
get lost, we often talk about this as if the catalyst
theory doesn't exist, but the fact of the matter is, the
catalyst theory has existed. It has been applied for 30
years, and the courts have not had trouble. When you look
at the cases, the courts are able to apply the causation
test. They are able to deal with these issues.
The district courts are equipped to make these
decisions, and they have made these decisions for 30
years, and we think that the Fourth Circuit is wrong, and
this Court should find, inasmuch as it did in the Laidlaw
case, that Farrar had no catalytic effect, that the Fourth
Circuit has misread Farrar, and that we should have our
opportunity, our day in court to present the motion for
attorneys' fees.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.
Arceneaux. The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:12 a.m. the case in the above-
entitled matter was submitted.)
