CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument
first this morning in Case 06-11206, Chambers v. United
States.
Mr. Hochman.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT N. HOCHMAN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. HOCHMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
Failure to report is not a violent felony
under the Armed Career Criminal Act because it presents
neither a serious potential risk of injury to others nor
involves violent and aggressive conduct.
The Government argues that failure to report
satisfies both the risk of injury and violent,
-aggressive conduct standards for the same reason: The
prospect that a offender will violently resist an arrest
-- resist arrest upon completion of the offense or upon
-- for having done the offense. That potential and that
potential risk alone is neither as a matter of fact nor
law sufficient to satisfy either the risk of injury or
the violent, aggressive conduct standard.
Beginning with the risk of injury: The
statute refers to a serious potential risk of injury,
and by using the word "serious" Congress indicated not
just any felony, not just any felony which carries
necessarily some risk of injury would be included. The
risk that must be generated must be one that's somehow
greater than, something that warrants singly out this
sort of offender as the sort of person who's deserving
of greater punishment for his recidivism.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I take it you
concede that a breakout as opposed to a failure to
report would be covered by the statute?
MR. HOCHMAN: Yes, Your Honor, I think it
would. I think that in fact one of the critical errors
that the courts of appeals have made and that the
Government made here is equating breakout, prison
escape, with failure to report. They are entirely
different. They are importantly different, both again
as a matter of analytically the categorical rule and
what would you look at to determine whether this sort of
person satisfied the violent and aggressive standard.
And we now know, in light of the Sentencing Commission's
report that was filed just last -- that was filed with
the Court just last week, that the risk of injury
associated with a prison breakout escape and failure to
report is dramatically different. And that mistake --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But suppose it were shown
-- this is hypothetical. Suppose it were shown that 90
percent of all escapes under the escape statute were
breakouts involving weapons; 10 percent were failure to
report. Would that affect how we decide the case?
MR. HOCHMAN: This case?
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.
MR. HOCHMAN: Well, since -- I think since
this is not a prison breakout case, I don't know whether
data about breakouts --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do we look to the crime to
see generally whether or not it involves violence and
serious risk of harm?
MR. HOCHMAN: I think you -- I think the
categorical rule does require you to look at --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: So that, in my
hypothetical, it would be a more difficult case than the
case we have here or would it be the same?
MR. HOCHMAN: I think in your hypothetical,
where a prison breakout-- where a prison breakout is
involved --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: No. My hypothetical is,
under the statute, if you look at the whole universe of
prosecutions under the escape statute, 90 percent of
them are for breakouts involving weapons.
MR. HOCHMAN: I don't think that you look to
the universe under the escape statute. You can under
Shepard --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's what we looked
to in Begay.
MR. HOCHMAN: But the issue under Shepard
and the approach under the categorical rule requires you
-- allows you to look at a narrower subsection of the
statute if the charging document and other reliable
indicia indicate that. And in this case, it's
undisputed that Mr. Chambers was convicted only of
failing to report. He was not convicted of the more
serious offense of prison breakout. And in fact in
Illinois they are punished at different levels, and the
evidence is absolutely clear --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Maybe -- I don't
want to put words in his mouth, but I thought what
Justice Kennedy was asking is what if you have a statute
that is just escape or whatever and doesn't break it
down like that? At that point would we look to see what
the crime of escape was typically like, most of them
were breakout or most of them were the other thing? You
have, I gather, two separate provisions, but what if you
don't?
MR. HOCHMAN: Yes. And that -- that is a
difficult question under the categorical rule. I think
that the first step would be to determine whether there
is anything in the record. Under Shepard, you can look
to other indications of whether the conduct at issue
that was found by the jury or that was pled to, either
from an indictment or from plea colloquy, whether there
is some more specific indication. If not, I think then
what you would look at -- and I think here you would
look at, to the extent you're looking at the risk -- on
the risk of injury side, you would look at the best
available information. If that -- if that gives you a
run of cases where you say typically --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. If
that's the case, I'm looking at 720 Illinois Statutes
5/31-6. It's reproduced a page 2a of the Government's
brief. And they don't -- it doesn't seem to be a
separate provision, whether it's a breakout or a failure
to report.
MR. HOCHMAN: But here the charging document
was clear, and under Shepard the charging document is
something you're also allowed to take into
consideration. And there is no doubt, under the
charging document, that he was convicted of merely
failing to report.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: What was the sentence for
that?
MR. HOCHMAN: It -- the sentence appears
that they extended his probation. He had to serve the
four weekends that he had failed -- for which he had
failed to report, and his probation was extended.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But he didn't get any
extra jail time?
MR. HOCHMAN: He did not get any additional
jail time as far as I can tell from the record, Your
Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA: There is really a problem
about -- about what you suggest. It may destroy the
whole benefit of the categorical approach. I mean, you
can always shave something down to become a narrower
crime. An escape statute, for example, I suppose you
could look to see whether the particular escape in
question from the charging document was an escape that
used firearms or was an escape that, you know, that
injured or killed guards. And, you know, that gets us
into the case-by-case examination that it is the whole
purpose of the categorical approach to avoid. Now, how
do we -- how do we avoid getting to the bottom of that
slippery slope?
MR. HOCHMAN: I think this -- I think this
Court took that step in Shepard, and it did it in a very
narrow and circumscribed way. It did it by saying the
only things you're allowed to consider are things that
are as reliable as the charge itself and the elements
essential to --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. I mean, the charge
mentions -- mentions a firearm. Anything that's in the
charge can be used to narrow the crime that we are
looking at.
MR. HOCHMAN: If the jury instructions were
clear, if it's clear that the jury had to find that the
presence of a firearm -- and I think it complicates --
that is, I think some courts refer to it as the modified
categorical rule.
JUSTICE SCALIA: It has to be an element of
the crime. If using a firearm is not an element of
escape, then I don't have to worry about it.
MR. HOCHMAN: If -- if -- correct. If it's
not an element in the sense that he either pled to it or
the jury necessarily found it as a necessary matter.
And that's really what Shepard says. It has to be
something that we necessarily know occurred from the
fact of conviction, and --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay, but it doesn't have
to be an element. So, if all the evidence in the case
was that, you know, he wrestled a gun from the guard and
made his way out of the prison that way, if the jury
found him guilty, that was the only basis on which it
could have found him guilty, that would be enough.
MR. HOCHMAN: I don't think that Shepard
permits you to look into trial transcripts of evidence
that was presented. It just says: What did the jury
necessarily find? And what I mean by "jury
instructions," how was the jury instructed? What did it
have to find? What did the jury have to find in order
to convict?
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that sounds like an
element. That sounds like an element.
MR. HOCHMAN: I think it is elements, but if
you look --
JUSTICE ALITO: Well --
MR. HOCHMAN: Please, continue.
JUSTICE ALITO: If you look at the cases
that we've had to decide under this statute in the last
couple of years, do you think they illustrate that the
categorical approach just doesn't work in this
situation? Because it puts us in a position for every
single crime that comes up here of making -- of trying
to ascertain what is the serious risk when we don't have
any empirical -- we don't have a number quantifying what
a serious risk is, nor can we generally find what the
risk is that's associated with a particular class of
cases.
Maybe when Congress enacted this they never
anticipated that it would be done on a categorical
basis. Why not just have a determination as to whether
there was a serious potential risk in this particular
case? So, if you have a -- a nonviolent person who
walks away, that's one thing. If you have somebody who
has a long list of convictions for violent -- violent
crimes and escapes, that's another situation.
MR. HOCHMAN: I think there are two problems
with that approach, Your Honor: First, as the Court
said in Shepard, the categorical rule, which was adopted
way back when the Court first confronted the statute and
has been consistently applied ever since, more or less
anticipated the Sixth Amendment Apprendi concerns that
might come from digging in and trying to attribute
conduct which has not been found by a jury, which
doesn't have that level of reliability, whether it's an
element or was on a special verdict form or some -- or
some other -- or was admitted to in a plea colloquy.
JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't that a separate
question? If it had -- if it has to be found by a jury,
it can be submitted to the jury?
MR. HOCHMAN: Well, if it was submitted to
the jury, then I think under Shepard it's something that
could be considered, and that would be part of what's
referred to as the modified categorical approach. I
think the problems with the categorical approach that
you're identifying, courts have tried and Shepard itself
in effect amended enough to provide some kind of
flexibility.
The other reason to hold back on such a sea
change is this is, after all, a statutory case and the
categorical rule has been this Court's approach from the
beginning. Congress could easily revise the statute.
If after 20 years it hasn't --
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, it could, and if it
had read these cases and it was paying attention to this
problem, you would think it would go through a list of
crimes and say, these fall within it and these don't
fall within it. But obviously it hasn't done that.
MR. HOCHMAN: I think that would make
everybody's job, the bar and this Court, much easier.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it might not, if it
just said "escape," and then you'd have this same
problem.
MR. HOCHMAN: That might be the case,
although if it just said "escape," I think I'd actually
have a substantially harder case than what we have here,
because what we have here doesn't resemble the kind of
violent, aggressive conduct that this Court in Begay
said is going to be the standard and exemplar of the
sort of conduct that Congress was thinking about. It
added -- this Court in Begay said that the serious
potential risk of injury is just one part of the
inquiry, that Congress was also singling out crimes
commit ted in a certain way, and if that, if that
requirement is going to have any bite, if it's going to
do the job of singling out and separating out cases, it
has to be something beyond the mere routine,
ever-present prospect that an offender might resist
arrest for having committed the offense after police
discover that he has done so.
And in fact if you step back for a moment
and just visualize --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Surely it depends upon how,
how, what should I say, how often that prospect is
realized.
MR. HOCHMAN: There is no doubt. There is
no doubt that the prospect --
JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, the statute itself
lists robbery and robbery very often doesn't involve any
threat of injury, but all and all we think it does.
Obviously, Congress thought it did, right?
MR. HOCHMAN: Well in the -- I actually
think robbery would satisfy under the first clause
because it has as an element the use, attempted use, or
threatened use of physical force against another. But I
think the concern that escape is much more easily
detected than other crimes is obviously true. And so
the prospect that the offender will be arrested is
obviously greater than in other, in other crimes.
But the point is the standards, the standard
imposed by Begay and the notion that the conduct must be
violent and aggressive, if you step back and visualize
what it is about burglary, arson, extortion or the use
of explosives that can properly be characterized as
violent and aggressive, surely it is not the prospect
that an offender will have been found out for having
committed those offenses, police will be dispatched to
arrest them, and then the offender upon that
confrontation will violently resist arrest. It's
just -- it's not, it's not what those enumerated
offenses are doing in the statute.
JUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't mean to say
robbery. I meant to say burglary. Why is burglary
violent or aggressive?
MR. HOCHMAN: I think the reason is because
--
JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, burglary by its
nature is-- you do it at night. You don't want to be
detected. It's not violent or aggressive at all. It's
sneaky, is what it is.
MR. HOCHMAN: I assume that --
JUSTICE SCALIA: Robbery is violent or
aggressive. You're quite right about that.
JUSTICE SOUTER: When you say burglary, if
you're at home, if you're at home it's going to get
violent and aggressive.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but -- that may be,
but it does not in its nature indicate violence or
aggressiveness.
MR. HOCHMAN: I think, Justice Souter, has
it exactly right. I think the reason why the Court in
Begay and Taylor, by the way, singled out burglary as
having some kind of inherent danger and potential for
violent and aggressive conduct associated with it is
because it involves an act of invading the space of
another, and cultural expectations and even common law
expectations about how others might respond suggest that
that scenario that you have willingly created, knowing
full well that another might respond violently to what
you've done in the event you've been detected --
JUSTICE SCALIA: It gets you right back into
the soup. What you're saying is all it requires is that
there be a potential for violence, for aggressiveness,
right? And that's what the Government says here: There
is a potential for violence and aggressiveness.
MR. HOCHMAN: What it -- what it requires is
the conscious creation of circumstances that you have
good reason to believe is going to ignite in violence.
And if we learned anything from the data that's been
submitted to the Court both by the Sentencing Commission
and by the Government, it's that there is very little
reason to believe that even the distant arrest scenario
for those who fail to report doesn't carry with it very
much of a risk of injury at all. In fact, in all the
materials that have been submitted to this Court, there
is not a single cited instance or case of an innocent
bystander or a police officer who has been injured in
connection with a confrontation from arrest for failure
to report. There are none.
Now to be sure, there are some instances of
violent confrontation and I'm not here saying it's
impossible that there would be injury associated with an
arrest scenario. The point is it's nothing different.
There is nothing in the record that would give us any
reason to believe this is the kind of special violent
conduct that Congress was singling out for special
treatment. I should also add that excluding failure to
report from the statute isn't going to create any kind
of crack through which the sort of people the Government
appears to be concerned about might fall through. And
the reason it this. The several anecdotal cases they
cite in their brief and a couple of the cases that
Massachusetts reported back to them which had involved
some kind of violent resisting arrest, those individuals
were charged, separately charged for assault and battery
and similar crimes on a police officer. It's
unsurprising that when that happens, those individuals
will be separately charged and convicted for their
violent conduct.
So the only work that is done by sweeping
away the categorical rule, doing serious damage to the
categorical rule, undermining Begay, the only work
that's done is to encompass people who we have reason to
believe didn't engage in violent conduct. That seems to
me a strange way to interpret the statute, certainly not
the sort of things this Court would want to close its
eyes to.
The last thing, Your Honors. It's important
to preserve the distinction in Begay between the violent
and aggressive standard on the one hand and the risk of
injury on the other hand, and Government's approach
collapses it. The Government says, why is this violent
and aggressive? Because in their view we can --
falsely, as we've discussed, but because in their view
there is a sufficient risk of injury on arrest. If
that's going to be the case, if you're going to be able
to show conduct is violent and aggressive simply because
there is a sufficient risk of injury associated with it,
the violent and aggressive conduct standard does
nothing.
JUSTICE SCALIA: That doesn't square with
the answer you gave me with regard to burglary. If what
you just said is true, burglary wouldn't be among the
listed crimes.
MR. HOCHMAN: No. The distinction I'm
drawing here is the act that you take of invading
somebody else's space and the prospect -- what you're
doing is you're consciously taking an act fully aware
that violence might ensue, which suggests that you are
the sort of person who is comfortable in a violent
situation or at least dangerously comfortable in such a
violent situation, regardless of how frequently that --
that circumstance actually is realized. You're the sort
of person who has taken an action that expresses comfort
with that sort of situation.
Failing to report --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So invading
someone's space, so trespass would be covered by this
statute? You're invading someone's space.
MR. HOCHMAN: If it's -- if it's felonious,
trespass might be. You're invading someone's space in
the circumstance where the response is -- I think there
is a decent argument for trespass if for no other reason
than the act itself, on the violence and aggressive
standard side, the act itself is more or less the same
as burglary. It's not as if you can immediately tell
from observing the burglar enter the structure that he
has the intent, the requisite intent to commit another
crime.
But the other reason why I doubt that
trespass might be -- might satisfy the standard is
because there may not -- there doesn't appear to be a
serious potential risk of injury. The second -- the
other requirement may not be satisfied. I just don't
have any information about that.
JUSTICE ALITO: Your argument is that the
failing to report is not violent and aggressive and
therefore, no matter what degree of risk the statistics
might show, it would not qualify?
MR. HOCHMAN: I'm making both arguments,
Your Honor. But yes, that is one, that is one of them.
If there are no further questions, I'll
reserve the remainder of my time.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Roberts.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. ROBERTS: Mr. Chief Justice and may it
please the Court:
Failure-to-report escape qualifies as a
violent felony under the ACCA's residual clause because
it creates a serious potential risk of physical injury
that's comparable in both kind and degree to the risk
that's created by the enumerated offense of burglary.
Failure-to-report escape is similar in kind to burglary
because it's purposeful, violent, and aggressive in the
same way as burglary.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Roberts, wouldn't
that be so of any crime? This is failure to report.
Any crime, any -- an arrest for any crime has a certain
risk that the arrestee is going to resist. Is there
anything different, is anything greater, about this
arrest for this kind of crime?
MR. ROBERTS: Yes, Your Honor. Two points
on that. First, escape and failure-to-report escape,
other types of escape and recapture, are linked ed in a
way that arrest and the typical crime aren't, because
escape inherently avoids -- inherently involves the
avoidance of custody and custody is the very obligation
that recapture is trying to impose. But avoiding arrest
isn't an element of the typical crime, so the connection
between arrest and the ordinary crime isn't close enough
to justify considering the violence in arrest -- in the
arrest in whether the crime is violent. Also the risk
--
JUSTICE SCALIA: Say that again. I didn't
understand it.
MR. ROBERTS: Okay. What I'm saying is it's
an element of escape that you're avoiding custody, and
escape is a continuing offense and so it doesn't end
until the avoidance of custody is over.
JUSTICE SOUTER: What's that got to do with
increasing the risk of violence? I mean, I see -- I see
your kind of elements argument, but it seems to be
beside the point that --
MR. ROBERTS: It shows the close connection
between the two. And so when you're -- when the
offender is committing the crime, it's appropriate to
hold him accountable for what he can see is so highly,
closely connected to the crime and which, in fact, has
to happen in order to end the crime; whereas --
JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but the crime is still
-- the crime that we are concerned with here is still
essentially a passive crime. He just doesn't show up.
MR. ROBERTS: Well --
JUSTICE SOUTER: And given, you know, the
close logical connections, I don't see that the close
logical connections convert the passive crime into a
higher degree of resisting arrest from any other. In
fact, it suggests just the opposite.
MR. ROBERTS: To address the -- the passive
point, deliberately failing to comply with your legal
duty to report to prison is not -- it is not doing
nothing, as Petitioner says. It's not purely passive.
It is a criminal act.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you know, you may
precisely be doing nothing. If I say, you know, it's
Monday morning at 9 o'clock, I'm supposed to -- to
report to prison, and I'm going to stay home, my purpose
is to stay put in my armchair. That's purposeful
conduct and it's about as passive as you can get.
MR. ROBERTS: It's purposefully inviting the
violent confrontation when the law enforcement officers
come to terminate --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: You can say the same thing
about failure to respond to a traffic ticket.
MR. ROBERTS: No. Because in -- in failure
to respond to the traffic ticket the -- first of all,
it's not clear that somebody is going to come after you
and try to physically bring you in.
Second of all, the offender isn't expecting
them and on edge and prone to react violently.
Third, he hasn't demonstrated already that
he is unwilling to submit to custody. And the fact that
--
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The offender is
prone to react violently if he doesn't respond to a
traffic ticket?
MR. ROBERTS: No. I'm saying just the
opposite of that. I'm saying that it's different
because here you've got somebody who is expecting the
police to come. He is looking over his shoulder all the
time. He knows they know he didn't come to prison. He
knows they know who he is. They probably know where he
is. If he is sitting at home, they know where he is.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is your
understanding of the Illinois statute? It is, I take
it, only triggered by failure to report for confinement?
MR. ROBERTS: This --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about like, you
know, you've got to see your probation officer every --
MR. ROBERTS: This offense that he was
convicted of is failure to report to a penal
institution, failure to report to prison.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you concede the
probation or parole situation?
MR. ROBERTS: I think a probation violation
is different -- different circumstances. It doesn't
involve the same refusal to submit to custody that this
offense involves, which --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So we need not so
many -- not so much statistics about how many times
violence results, but statistics about how serious the
police are about picking somebody up?
MR. ROBERTS: I don't think you really need
the statistics, Your Honor. I think it's a common --
it's common sense that the police are going to make
vigorous efforts to recapture people who fail to show up
to prison the way they are supposed to.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But it's not common sense
that the person who has been guilty of a crime so
gentlemanly that they only made him report to prison on
the weekends would confront the policeman with violence
when he comes. This is not normally what you think of
as a violent type who has -- who has been told to report
weekends to the prison.
MR. ROBERTS: Well --
JUSTICE SCALIA: But did he get additional
time, by the way, when -- when they finally brought him
back?
MR. ROBERTS: When he was sentenced -- when
he was convicted of escape, he was sentenced to six
months in prison -- in jail, that was stayed; probation
for 30 months, and he violated his probation and he
ended up in jail for 5 years.
JUSTICE SCALIA: So he just -- he just had
to make up the weekends that he had lost?
MR. ROBERTS: No. He didn't just have to
make up the weekends that he had lost.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's what Mr. Hochman
told us --
MR. ROBERTS: I know that, Your Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- when I asked that
question.
MR. ROBERTS: But I don't think that's
accurate for the sentence for escape. On page 113 to
114 of this JA, Your Honor, which is the -- the PSR
describing what happened for this offense, it says that
he has 30 months probation. It's in the second volume,
the volume under seal.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, this guy doesn't
sound to me like Jack the Ripper. He really doesn't.
MR. ROBERTS: You know, we are not supposed
to be looking at the individual offender here. It's the
categorical approach. But he had been convicted of
robbery and aggravated battery, Your Honor. So he -- he
is not somebody who has not done any violent crimes,
either. And what's -- what's different is that he has
now deliberately failed to comply with his legal duty to
report. He has now deliberately resisted custody, so --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: But would the statute
apply if -- say he is supposed to go in on the weekends.
Instead, he goes out on a binge, and then he voluntarily
comes in on a Monday morning saying, yes, I failed to
report, and so here I am.
MR. ROBERTS: First of all, while he is out
on the binge, people could be coming and looking for him
and the violent confrontation could occur.
Second of all, even if in the unusual case of somebody
who comes in voluntarily hours late, a few days late,
there wasn't a -- a risk of -- of violence, which we
think there can be, but even if there was none, it
wouldn't matter because you're applying the categorical
approach here. And what you don't look at -- you don't
look at the unusual case. You look at the elements of
the offense in the ordinary case.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you -- can you tell
me: The U.S. attorney has this case. The man failed to
report for custody some -- a few years earlier, and you
have this offense. Does the district attorney or --
pardon me -- the United States attorney have some
discretion here that he may not prosecute at all? What
-- what goes into the --
MR. ROBERTS: I think generally the policy
--
JUSTICE KENNEDY: What goes through the mind
of -- of a prosecutor? He says, because this fellow
failed to report earlier for this offense, I'm going to
give him 15 extra years in jail.
MR. ROBERTS: Well, Your Honor, he is -- he
is looking at his whole --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what does a -- are
there many instances where you think in a case like this
a U.S. attorney would just elect not to file that
charge?
MR. ROBERTS: I --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Or do you think they
automatically file it every time; and if not, how do
they define it?
MR. ROBERTS: I think generally that -- that
they look at the conduct that's been committed and they
-- that the policy is to charge the -- the maximum
charges that are supported by what the -- what the
defendant has done. But here you don't have --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do they ever look at the
-- do they ever look at the attorney? This attorney has
been giving us a hard time, and we ought to show him
that we really mean business? Do they look at the
nature of the -- the identity of the counsel of the
defendant? Do they ever look at that?
MR. ROBERTS: I'm -- I'm not aware of that.
I can't -- can't speak to the -- the fact that they
would do that, Your Honor. But here you've got in the
ACCA, you're got not one previous violation for escape;
you've got three violent felonies that you have to have.
And this was his third one with -- in addition to
robbery and aggravated battery and in addition to
distributing cocaine within a thousand feet of public
housing. And so we are not talking about --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understood your
friend -- excuse me. I understood your friend to say
that you don't have a single example of failure to
report leading to a violent confrontation.
MR. ROBERTS: That's -- that's also
incorrect, Your Honor. Two of the four cases that we
cited in our -- in our brief, in our anecdotes, involved
injury to innocent bystanders. It's true we didn't
highlight that in the parentheticals to those cases, but
it's on page 19, the -- we cite various cases, and we
also then go on to cite some articles just as an
example.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you have -- so
you have two examples.
MR. ROBERTS: We have those two examples. I
mean, I haven't gone out and looked for other cases.
Those are just two out of the four that we cited.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You haven't gone out
and looked for other -- I'm sorry. You haven't gone out
and looked for other cases? I thought you --
MR. ROBERTS: In -- in addition to those,
no. I -- I went to get some sample cases. I haven't
gone to see if I could find more cases of those. In
addition, in the Massachusetts data there are -- there
are two of the 18. Admittedly, the sample is small in
Massachusetts --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Roberts --
MR. ROBERTS: But it's 11 percent of the
people violently resisted, and they were charged with
assault and battery on a police officer. I think that
that's indicative of possible injury. And in any case
the question is --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Roberts, have you had
occasion to look at the -- the recent figures compiled
by the Sentencing Commission?
MR. ROBERTS: Yes, Your Honor. And I think
that the Sentencing Commission data also supports --
although, again, the -- the sample size is small. But
the question here is: Is there a potential risk? And
what the sentencing data shows for the failure-to-report
escapees is that 7.1 --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Is the magnitude of the
risk relevant? Suppose it happens one out of 10,000
times or 99 out of 100 times. Are they different cases?
MR. ROBERTS: We don't think that you should
be looking at the statistics at -- at all, Your Honor.
But -- and so -- I mean, you know, that's our -- our
fundamental point is that -- that the ACCA requires a
potential risk. The James case illustrates that you
decide these cases without statistics.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the potential risk is
based on an empirical assessment. What's -- how can we
make an empirical assessment without statistics?
MR. ROBERTS: What James says is that you
try to assess whether the degree of risk is comparable
to the degree of risk presented by one of the enumerated
offenses. And, as you did in James --
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But isn't that's based on
our experience because we have these cases; we've been
lawyers; we know what they usually involve. We have
some sort of a --
MR. ROBERTS: Yes.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- an instinct or a basis
for making a judgment.
MR. ROBERTS: Yes.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: If statistics can inform
that, why ignore the statistics?
MR. ROBERTS: I'm not saying that you should
ignore the statistics, but the statistics are neither
necessary nor dispositive. And I don't think the
statistics cast any doubt on the commonsense conclusion
based on some of the factors I was talking about before,
about why there's a potential for violence during --
JUSTICE SOUTER: But your argument goes
simply to whether there is potential and the statute
says "serious potential." Which gets us, it seems to
me, to the point that Justice Kennedy is making, and
that is, we've got to have something more than an
instinctive belief that something bad might happen.
MR. ROBERTS: Well, I think James addresses
that, Your Honor. And James says that in deciding
whether you have a serious potential, you look to the
enumerated offenses and you determine if they can be
comparable.
JUSTICE SOUTER: They were taking as
examples cases in which there was serious potential.
But in any event, you can't lose sight of the modifier.
It has got to be more than a so-called "potential risk."
MR. ROBERTS: It has -- it has to be more
than a potential. It has to be serious in the sense
that it's similar in degree, comparable in degree, to
one of the enumerated offenses.
JUSTICE BREYER: What one are we to do
with -- Justice Stevens -- I think you should address
the statistics in the sentencing report.
MR. ROBERTS: Okay.
JUSTICE BREYER: As I read them, they put
together -- if you put together failing to report and
failing to return, you get 160 cases in their sample.
And the number of those cases, whether you looked at the
time when he had left or whether you looked at the time
he was apprehended, in which force was involved is zero.
The number of cases in which injury was involved is
zero. The number of cases where he had a dangerous
weapon is five.
MR. ROBERTS: That's right. And --
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So now there we
are.
MR. ROBERTS: It's a 3.1 percent -- 3.1
percent rate of having this dangerous weapon when he is
being -- being taken into custody for -- for this
offense. And, you know, looking at the -- at the
failure-to-report people, which is what this person is
charged of, of those 42 people, that was 7.1 percent of
those people that had a weapon. And if one of those
people had used that weapon, that would have been a 2.4
percent chance of injury.
Now, I'm saying the sample size is small,
and this shows why it's dangerous to put too much weight
on it. But that would have been a 2.4 percent rate of
injury. And in Tennessee v. Garner, this Court cited a
statistic in the 1970s about the risk of violence during
burglary. And this was household burglary, which you
think might be likely --
JUSTICE BREYER: You had every opportunity,
when we have 160 cases out of the universe -- I guess I
don't know what the universe is, but sampling proceeds
through a small amount of cases. And you could, of
course, criticize the Sentencing Commission effort if
you have the statistician or someone who will tell us
that that sampling was not an appropriate method to
proceed. Is there any such person?
MR. ROBERTS: Well, no, Your Honor. And I'm
not criticizing it. I'm saying that you have to take
into account the sample size and you have to take into
account that there are --
JUSTICE BREYER: No. Why -- that was my
question. Why take into account the sample size in the
absence of a statistician who would tell us that the
sample size is too small to reach the conclusion that
the commission reaches?
MR. ROBERTS: Because my point is that --
take the 42 failure-to-report people, which is the
offense here, okay. Three of them -- three of those 42,
had guns. If one of those three had used the gun, that
would have been a use of force, an instance of actual
violence.
That percentage -- I'm not -- I'm not
questioning the statistical validity of anything. I'm
taking it on its terms. That's a 2.4 percent statistic
there.
JUSTICE SCALIA: But they didn't use a gun.
MR. ROBERTS: 3.8 percent in -- in household
burglary. So I just think that -- that the statistics
are -- are very low, the risk of actual violence in
burglary as well.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry, counsel.
One of my colleagues was trying to ask a question.
JUSTICE SCALIA: The problem is you say if
he had used a gun. And he didn't use a gun. I mean, to
come up with your statistics on the basis of something
that didn't happen is not using statistics; it's using
imagination.
MR. ROBERTS: Well, Your Honor, the statute
again talks about the potential risk. It doesn't talk
about the actual use of force or the actual injury. The
actual use of force is covered by clause one --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think those
statistics show a greater danger than the dangers from
drunk driving that were involved in Begay?
MR. ROBERTS: No. But I think the drunk
driving -- that what concerned the Court about drunk
driving was that the crime is a strict liability crime.
It didn't involve deliberate conduct. This conduct is
purposeful. Petitioner doesn't -- doesn't contest that.
And the situation here is a different kind of risk.
It's like the risk in burglary. It's the deliberate
commission of the crime despite the clear risk of an
ensuing violent confrontation.
And so, the parallel, there really isn't a
parallel to the strict liability crime there, where the
injury -- the Court said in Begay there is a serious
risk of injury. The problem is that the crime is just
not purposeful, so it doesn't show this willingness to
harm others.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, of course, that's
the point. Begay talked about purposeful violent
conduct, not just purposeful conduct.
MR. ROBERTS: Yes, Your Honor. But you have
to -- you have to talk about the violent conduct in
context. And what it said is that all these enumerated
crimes are violent crimes. But burglary is violent not
because the violence is some element of the offense.
There is nothing about the elements of the offense
that's violent. What makes burglary violent is the fact
that the offender deliberately commits it, even though
he knows it could trigger this violent confrontation.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: The distinction between
this crime and crimes in general is that this person has
shown that he or she doesn't want to go back into
custody, is that --
MR. ROBERTS: I think it's -- it's numerous
things, but the avoidance of custody is sort of a
categorical difference between this and all the other
crimes, Your Honor. It's an element of this crime that
he is doing that.
That also factors into the fact that the
risk of violence during recapture is going to be greater
than the risk of violence in apprehending an ordinary
criminal for several different related reasons. One --
JUSTICE GINSBURG: There is -- there was,
this case comes to us from the Seventh Circuit, right?
MR. ROBERTS: Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And am I correct in
understanding that since this case was decided, the
Seventh Circuit has changed its position and has gone
the other way?
MR. ROBERTS: Yes. The Seventh Circuit
thought that applying the purposeful, violent and
aggressive requirement of Begay required a different
result because it -- it thought that it meant that the
crime had to involve violent conduct itself; and it
didn't appreciate the point I was making before, that
burglary doesn't involve that violent conduct itself,
and that burglary is violent because of the prospect of
the violent confrontation.
And so, that's the -- that's what led the
Seventh Circuit astray the second time around. But it
--
JUSTICE GINSBURG: The first time around,
didn't one of the judges suggest that there ought to be
a study comparing the frequency of violence in escapes
from custody to the frequency of violence in failure to
report, and isn't that what we now have from the
Sentencing Commission?
MR. ROBERTS: Yes. They did ask for -- for
statistics. But I would stress again why we think
that -- that looking to statistics as some kind of a
requirement is, you know, both perilous and not required
by the statute: One, because the statute requires just
potential risk, not actual injury.
Two, because these data are just generally
not going to be available. And you don't have even the
baseline for the other crimes, the enumerated crimes,
really to compare it to. And so the result, if you
start looking around for statistics and saying we need
these statistics to do it, is that virtually no crimes
are going to qualify under the residual clause.
And obviously, that isn't what Congress
intended when it adopted this broad residual clause.
JUSTICE SOUTER: May I -- may I -- may I ask
you just to get some sense about what will qualify? I
mean, I think we -- we all agree that the risk of
violence in arrest is probably going to vary depending
on -- categorically depending on the crimes.
I think I would probably agree that
white-collar crimes are not likely to -- to carry a very
high risk of violence on arrest. So I -- there's one
category. Can you think of others, other categories
outside of white-collar crime, that are going to have a
lower risk of arrest than, say, the failure-to-report
category?
MR. ROBERTS: What -- we wouldn't sweep in
any crimes based on arrest if the crimes don't
themselves involve as part of the crime the avoidance of
custody, because that shows the close link between the
crime that I was explaining before. That's sort of the
categorical difference, although I would agree with you,
certainly, that in white-collar crimes in many cases the
offender is going to submit voluntarily to custody; they
are not even going to come after him. And he hasn't
done anything to show his likelihood to resist in any
way, and so there is going to be a significantly less
connection there.
Violent crimes where you might think that
there is going to be a higher incidence are going to be
covered based on the violence of the crime, anyway.
JUSTICE SOUTER: They are going to be in
category one.
MR. ROBERTS: Right. They are going to be
covered already.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.
MR. ROBERTS: So you know, one, we think
there is a categorical difference between this kind of
crime which has as an element avoidance custody, and all
of the ordinary crimes that you're talking about. But
even if you go and set that aside and don't draw that
categorical line, and you look at, well, what's the risk
of violence, here what you've got is you've got you know
that they are going to come after him; he knows they are
coming; he is already deliberately, he has already
indicated his unwillingness to submit to custody; they
know that; so they come prepared for resistance. And in
Illinois he is by definition a recidivist felon if he
has committed this crime, and those are characteristics
that are particularly indicative of dangerousness. So
we think this sets it quite apart from other crimes in
terms of the risk of violence that -- that we are
talking about.
JUSTICE ALITO: Do you happen to know how
many additional crimes are likely to raise issues like
this under the residual clause?
MR. ROBERTS: Not -- you know, how many
could be covered altogether? Or --
JUSTICE ALITO: Well after we decide this
case, how many more cases like this do you anticipate
that we're -- we may get under ACCA?
MR. ROBERTS: Well I'm hopeful that the
Court won't have to decide too many other cases with the
guidance that will be given by Begay and James and
now -- and now this case.
So, you know, it has been -- this case, the
Court took; it had been holding the case for Begay and
it took it rather than vacating and remanding. So it's
not as if this is a case where some conflict has
developed after the Court was taken to resolve. We
think --
JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Roberts, I'm sorry; do
you think a soldier who is AWOL commits a violent crime?
MR. ROBERTS: I think a soldier that goes
AWOL -- I mean, the soldier that goes AWOL does probably
invite somebody to come after them. It's a little bit
harder case here because he is not somebody who is a
recidivist felon.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, he has to be a
recidivist. This is one of three offenses for an
aggravated sentence. You never have the isolated
question.
MR. ROBERTS: Well, when he did it first --
he could have done it in his first crime. So you don't
know when did this that he had the other two counting
under the ACCA.
JUSTICE STEVENS: It would only be a crime
if it's his third crime and not if it's his first.
MR. ROBERTS: Well, you don't look to the
individual person; we're looking to the ordinary case
and we know from the elements here that you have a
recidivist -- you have a recidivist felon. I do think
that there is a risk of -- you know, there is a risk of
violent confrontation when a soldier goes AWOL, Your
Honor.
JUSTICE STEVENS: Sure.
MR. ROBERTS: I just don't think it's quite
as -- as clear a risk as it is -- as it is here, but you
know, I would have to say that there is some risk. Yes.
The -- if I could just address something
that Justice Kennedy had raised before about statutes
unlike Illinois's statute that has a -- that generally
prohibit escape. One -- one possible problem that could
arise from a holding that offenses like failure to
report are not violent felonies is that a statute that
broadly covered escape, the result would be that jail
break escapes would not be violent felonies under that
statute, because the statistics that are out there
suggest that 89 percent of all escapes are either
walkaways or failure to report.
And so unless the charging document
specifically charged it as a jail break escape, then the
general -- something that was charged under the general
escape statute would not qualify for coverage under the
ACCA.
And aside from that, if the Court has no
further questions, we could ask that the judgment of the
Court of Appeals be affirmed.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Hochman, you have 11 minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT N. HOCHMAN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. HOCHMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
Just to begin with where Mr. Roberts left
off, most states in fact do distinguish in their
statutes between failure to report and prison break
escapes. These are cited by both parties in the briefs
and you can review them, but there are clear
distinctions in the law. So the risk that prison break
escape is somehow going to escape -- escape, if you
will, from the scope of the statute as a result of a
reversal is -- is unfounded.
Just to make a couple of things clear.
First of all with respect to the sentence, Justice
Ginsburg, the -- he was sentenced to six additional
months but it was stayed as -- as was mentioned; and so
when I was answering that question he did not serve
additional time as a result of that, and that's what I
was referring to.
If you look at the sentencing transcript,
that's where the indication is that he did in fact serve
out four additional weekends. It's not noted in the --
it's not noted as an additional sentence, punishment for
it.
JUSTICE SCALIA: What was he serving those
weekends for? What was the crime?
MR. HOCHMAN: That was the armed robbery --
the robbery crime, not armed robbery, the robbery crime.
That's the first predicate offense here.
JUSTICE SCALIA: He just gets weekends for
that? How many weekends?
MR. HOCHMAN: 11.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Pretty good deal.
(Laughter.)
MR. HOCHMAN: Second, with respect to the
anecdotal cases, you know, we looked at them; you could
look at them. If there are two instances where there
are injury -- there are two instances where there are
injury, I didn't catch that, and I apologize if I
misspoke.
But it doesn't change the core of the
problem, which is that the anecdotal evidence
produced -- and that dates back all the way to 1977,
they looked back at cases -- they are covering on
extraordinary broad period of time in looking for this
stuff, and there is just not -- there is not a lot
there, if there is anything there at all, with respect
to injury associated with failure to report.
On the core substance of their argument,
Mr. Roberts emphasized that failing to report has as an
element avoiding arrest, avoiding confinement. I don't
actually think that's right. There is nothing about
concealment. There is nothing about hiding. There is
nothing about seeking to escape from a police officer
who comes to bring you back. He just didn't go; and in
fact we don't -- the record doesn't explain why; but you
know, it was the November to December period. It's the
holiday period of time for people when they, obviously,
for a variety of reasons might prefer to spend time with
their families. Whatever the reason was --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Statistics show that
the number of robberies increases during the holiday
season. He just needed to get --
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought he did this
four times. I thought there were four.
MR. HOCHMAN: There were four periods from
the end of November, four consecutive weekends from the
end of November into December. There is no indication,
Mr. Chief Justice, that any further robberies were
committed during that period. But the point is --
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, there is no
indication he meant to spend time with his family over
the holidays.
(Laughter.)
MR. HOCHMAN: Not in the record. It's
absolutely not in the record, Your Honor. No doubt.
But the point is that while Mr. Roberts stood up and
said it's about avoiding arrest; it's about concealing
yourself; it's the sort of person that's prone to react
violently; the fact is, that's speculation; and
everything we know from the sentencing commission and
from their own efforts suggests the contrary. And
indeed even the dangerous weapon findings of the
sentencing commission, I think, should be excluded,
because under the guidelines, the mere possession of a
weapon is not a violent felony.
A felon in possession is not -- cannot be a
predicate offense under the guidelines. And so the mere
possession of a weapon, which is all you have on those
five instances -- by the way, the fact that they did not
double-count them as also including four suggests they
weren't used in any way, they weren't brandished in any
way. It's just not there. There is really nothing
there to support the Government's speculation. If there
is no further questions, thank you, Your Honors.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
The case is submitted.
