        "content": "(11:03 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext this morning in Case 10-1018, Filarsky v. Delia.\nMs. Millett.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. MILLETT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nWhen a private attorney is temporarily\nretained by the government to work in coordination with\nor under the direct supervision of government employees\nin fulfilling the government's business, in getting the\ngovernment's work done, that attorney is entitled to the\nsame immunity that a government employee performing that\nsame function for that same government would receive.\nIn this case, that is qualified immunity. That rule\ncomports with the history and policy concerns that have\nanimated this Court's section 1983 and immunity\njurisprudence.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's across the board,\nMs. Millett, the rule you just stated? Is there any\nsituation in which a private attorney engaged to assist\na government office in the performance of a public\nfunction would lack qualified immunity? Or is it simply\nwherever a government agency employs a private attorney\nto assist it in doing its work, that attorney will have\nqualified immunity?\nMS. MILLETT: I think it -- it may well be\nthe latter rule, the more broader one, but for these\npurposes, the Court only needs to decide the situation\nwhen they are working in coordination with or under\ndirect supervision of government employees. And I want\nto clarify that answer because how one defines doing a\npublic service -- for example, if a State government\nappoints somebody to represent one of their police\nofficers who's sued in a 1983 action, if there's five\ndefendants, the attorney general can't represent them\nall; they will all commonly appoint people and will pay\nthem -- some States will pay them from the -- from the\nState fisc.\nAnd so, they'll be paid by the government to\nperform a governmental function in that sense, but their\nallegiance there is to the individual employee, not to\nthe government. The same with public defenders.\nSo, there are certain situations where\nsomeone can be retained by the government in that sense,\npaid by the government in that sense.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why does it matter whether\nthe privately retained attorney works in close\ncooperation with government employees? Suppose in this\ncase Mr. Filarsky had simply been hired to go off and\nperform this investigation and, at the end of the\ninvestigation, report the results to the town? Would\nthe case come out differently then?\nMS. MILLETT: I don't think that would, but\nin this -- but I think it depends on what one means by\ncoordination with or supervision. And with respect to\nattorneys, attorneys can never be an independent\ncontractor in relationship to their client in the way\nthe prison was in Richardson. Attorneys just can't be.\nThey are always, in the sense of the rule that I'm using\nit, working for their client agency, their client\ngovernment, and under its control and authority. And\nthe decisions they make are the decisions of that\nclient.\nAnd that's why the whole -- the whole reason\nwe should have this rule is understanding what immunity\nprotects. It protects government decisionmaking,\ngovernmental conduct, and its ability to maneuver with\nan area -- in an area of reasoned decisionmaking.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And I -- I suppose you can\nargue that there is a built-in limitation because the\nquestion doesn't even come up unless there's state\naction. So, there has to be close enough cooperation so\nthere's state action. I had never thought that when a\nprivate attorney gives an opinion letter to a government\nagency or government entity at its request that there's\nany state action there at all. So, that question -- so,\nthere the question just wouldn't even come up; am I\ncorrect? I assume --\nMS. MILLETT: Right, because, certainly, the\nstate action limitation both limits the operation of\nthis rule. There's many times attorneys or others who\nwork with the government will not implicate the state\naction rule. And that's sort of the irony of -- of this\ncase, and I think it would not be uncommon in attorney\ncases. The only reason this was a tort, or an alleged\ntort, is because the government was involved, because\ngovernmental actors took his advice, conducted a\nsearch -- he didn't -- issued an order -- he didn't.\nAnd yet we have -- we're left in this is odd world where\nthe only way this tort, constitutional tort lawsuit, can\ngo forward is without the government.\nNow, 1983 is about deterring governmental\nconduct, but this Court's immunity jurisprudence says we\ndon't over-deter and we want to allow the government to\noperate within a realm of reasoned decisionmaking. And\nthey need to operate within that realm, get reasoned\nadvice and make reasoned decisions, regardless of\nwhether the source of the advice is a temporarily or\npermanently retained attorney.\nThe need is for reasoned decisionmaking.\nAnd if you over-deter, which is what an action against\nthe private attorney who is now charged with litigating\nand defending the government's allegedly\nunconstitutional conduct, standing all alone while all\nthe government actors have walked away -- that turns\nsection 1983 on its head.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But your test -- and\nthis is -- I think goes broader than the articulation of\nthe test -- doesn't give this private attorney much\nassurance by itself. It's sort of a multifactor, is he\ncoordinating, is he under the supervision, is he really\ndoing public service? I mean, if the idea is to give\nhim sufficient breathing room so he doesn't stop, and\nwhen, as in this case, he's threatened that we're going\nto sue you if you do this, he has to think, well, now,\nam I being supervised by the government? Am I\ncoordinating with the government? Or I -- am I telling\nthem what -- it -- the test itself undermines the\nasserted purpose.\nMS. MILLETT: Well, two responses to that.\nFirst of all, the State law requirement -- the state\naction requirement that Justice Kennedy referred to will\nup front require allegations by the plaintiffs that will\ndiscuss the coordinated -- presumably the coordinated\naction. There's going to have to be some level of\ncoordination.\nBut the second reason is, as I said, with\nrespect to attorneys, I don't think this is going to be\na hard question because they are forever agents and\nfiduciaries. They can never be the independent\ncontractor that you had in Richardson. They are always\nanswerable to and working for their governmental client.\nAnd when I say \"supervision\" here, I don't think the\ntest here is -- is an on-hands, day-to-day looking over\nyour shoulders. The government has to be able to get\nthe advice of professionals and to trust them --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Suppose -- suppose the\ngovernment hires an attorney to do an independent\ninvestigation; it hires an outside attorney precisely\nbecause it does not want to be faced with allegations\nthat it has manipulated the outcome of the investigation\nbecause its own conduct is at issue. So, they say\nyou're going to be independent, hands-off; we're not\ngoing to interfere at all. But that would still in your\n-- in your submission satisfy the coordination\nrequirement?\nMS. MILLETT: It -- it would in this sense,\nbecause there would be -- and I'm assuming here we're\nnot talking like a Bivens appointment or something like\nthat. But here -- because understand what happens in\nthat situation. They're being appointed to investigate\nfor the government and on behalf of the government.\nAnd it's not usually because we say the\ngovernment writ large may have done something that would\ncreate a conflict. It may be an individual employee or\nsomething. That's where the conflict comes. But\nthey're working for the government. The government is\ntheir client. They are not freewheeling independent\ncontractors. And --\nJUSTICE ALITO: What is the difference\nbetween that and the prison situation? The private\nprison -- the guard in the private prison is performing\na function that has been delegated to that or assumed by\nthat entity pursuant to a contract. I don't understand\nexactly what the difference is.\nMS. MILLETT: The difference is -- there's a\npractical difference and then a legal doctrinal\ndifference. The practical difference is that, in\nRichardson, it was a quite unique situation where the\ngovernment really had washed its hands of the prison\noperation. It had put the day-to-day operation of the\nprison, the decisionmaking of the prison, how we treat\nthe prisoners, entirely in the hands of a private\ncontractor, subject only to what this Court said was\nvery limited supervision, essentially in contract terms.\nBut it had ceded that authority, and it did not exercise\na control. It did not exercise the day-to-day\ndecisionmaking. And that's where we get into the\ndoctrinal point.\nSo, the decisions that were being made there\nand that there were -- the lawsuit concerned, there\nwasn't a single governmental defendant named in that\ncase. It was just the private -- the private guards\nthat were at issue there. And the decisions that were\nmade were the private company's decisions.\nAnd so, this Court said there that's not\nwhat qualified immunity is out -- is out to protect. It\nis to protect what? The government's decisionmaking,\nthe special concerns that arise when you are bringing\nlawsuits that are designed to regulate, limit, deter\ngovernmental decisionmaking. We have to protect that\narea of reason.\nIf the government's not making the decision,\nthey've passed the buck, they've handed it off, then\nthere's nothing to protect.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why isn't that the case\nhere?\nMS. MILLETT: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It seems to me that\nthere's enough evidence that the lawyer was the one who\nheld the investigation; the people who attended the\nmeeting between the lawyer, the Respondent, and the\nother personnel that were there were acceding to what he\nwas doing. The chief -- he goes to the chief and he\nsays: I want you to do this. And the chief is relying\non him, not his own independent judgment, to issue the\ncommand that's contested here.\nSo, that sort of puts your argument on its\nhead because it appears that he was more the independent\ninvestigator --\nMS. MILLETT: No --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- than he was the\nindividual under the control of the agency.\nMS. MILLETT: Okay. Well, first of all -- a\ncouple of responses. First of all, no, that's nothing\nlike Richardson. This was the government's\ninvestigation. They initiated it. They brought him on\nto the team for his expertise, much like prosecutors\nmight bring on a psychologist to evaluate a criminal\ndefendant. Now, are the prosecutors going to sit there\nand say, you know, Psychologist, you should ask this\nquestion? Or are they going to defer to the medical\nexpertise? That's a --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: This argument seems to\nfall under what Justice Scalia termed a functional test,\nthat he's serving just like any other government lawyer.\nIf you were going to fit this case under the Richardson\nmajority test, how would you do it?\nMS. MILLETT: And I'd do that -- first of\nall, I keep -- I'm putting it right in -- in\nRichardson's language, which said it was reserving this\nvery question, and that is, when an attorney or any\nindividual is working in close coordination or under the\nsupervision of government officials in the performance\nof an essential function.\nAnd so, that makes clear that Richardson was\ndeciding not that situation, the handed-off turnkey\nsituation. This -- there's no turnkey here. This is\nMr. Filarsky being brought on to the team.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So -- so, independent\ncounsel would not be covered. I mean, if you have, you\nknow, a counsel appointed because -- to show that the\nadministration is disinterested in this prosecution and\nyou get independent counsel, the Attorney General says:\nI will not interfere with him. The President says: I\nwill not interfere with him. Then him you can -- you\ncan sue without any immunity, right?\nMS. MILLETT: No. And that's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why? He's not working in\nclose coordination. He's not subject to supervision.\nThe whole purpose of an independent counsel is to\neliminate supervision.\nMS. MILLETT: Yes, but independent counsel\nis still sued in the name of the United States. Their\nclient was the United States Government. That is\nwhom -- that is the interest in which they worked. They\nwere -- they had a client that they were answerable to.\nThey were not freewheeling independent contractors; they\nwere attorneys with a client.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. Weren't the\nprison guards who were -- who were suable in\nRichardson -- weren't they suable under 1983 as acting\nunder color of law?\nMS. MILLETT: This Court assumed that\nquestion; it did not answer it in that -- in that case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, the whole issue would\nhave been a nonissue if they -- if they couldn't be\nsued.\nMS. MILLETT: This Court assumed it. I\nthink it's fair to assume when you're operating a\nprison, although I think to -- there's a reason this\nCourt reserved it, because the question there is --\ncertainly, the corporation --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMS. MILLETT: -- was under color of law,\nwhether the individuals who worked for the corporation\nwould also be under color of law.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Don't you think the -- the\ntwo should go pari passu, as we say, that if you can be\nsued for acting under color of law, you ought to have\nthe defenses that people who are acting with legal\nauthority have?\nMS. MILLETT: Well, this Court's already\ncrossed that bridge in cases like Wyatt, where, for\nexample -- and it does because the State law requirement\ncan sweep broadly in some situations.\nSo, I don't think in a situation like\nWyatt v. Cole, where you have private plaintiffs\npursuing their private agenda and they simply invoke a\nState law, that that makes them integrated with the\ngovernment in the way that an attorney is, and certainly\nthe way Petitioner was here, that they're not part of\nthe governmental team, and they're not making -- they\nweren't making decisions in the interest of the\ngovernment. There was no governmental decisionmaking to\nprotect there, and that's what -- the rationale this\nCourt gave for denying qualified immunity in Wyatt.\nThe key here is that this is -- you cannot\nprotect governmental decisionmaking in this context\nwithout protecting the source of advice for that\ndecisionmaking.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Lawyers are not\nsupposed to be cowed by the exigencies of the situation.\nWe're worried in qualified immunity with protecting\ngovernmental actors, to make sure they will feel\ncomfortable doing the right thing rather than being\nintimidated in the situation we had here.\nLawyers have that professional obligation in\nthe first place. So, why does a lawyer need the -- the\ndefense of qualified immunity?\nMS. MILLETT: There are a couple of reasons.\nFirst of all, that rationale would mean no government\nlawyers get the protection either, because they have\nthat exact same obligation of fealty, and we don't apply\nthat rule. That hasn't even been questioned. And the\nreason we don't is we understand that this is a more --\nit's a more layered inquiry into timidity.\nFirst of all, we don't even want the\nsubconscious pressures that would come with full-freight\nliability for governmental conduct to any angry third\nparty even subconsciously interfering with the decisions\nof government lawyers temporarily or permanently\nretained.\nSecondly, we want the government to be able\nto get the advice, to be encouraged to get the advice.\nSection 1983 must support governments getting legal\nadvice to counsel them in complying with the law that\nsection 1983 enforces, but government will be deterred\nfrom obtaining legal advice if the cost of getting an\nattorney -- especially if you're a small town,\nmunicipality, county, you don't -- can't afford a\nfull-time staff, and the cost of getting an attorney is\nall those things that qualified immunity wanted to\nprotect against.\nOur decision -- reasonable decisionmaking\nthat we thought was protected by qualified immunity is\nnow on trial. And we have to be there as witnesses, and\na jury is going to assess liability for a reasonable\ngovernmental decision.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Millett, our cases have\nsaid that we're supposed to look not only to policy but\nalso to history. Would you disagree with the premise\nthat a person in your client's position historically\nwould have had at most an actual malice -- a malice\ndefense or a reasonable cause defense? Would a person\nhave anything more than that?\nMS. MILLETT: They would have had the same\nsort of good-faith defense that this Court in Harlow\nturned into qualified immunity, both as lawyers\nworking --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: But, in Wyatt, we said that\nthat was a very different kind of immunity than the\nHarlow immunity, and we said historically it provided no\nbasis for giving Harlow immunity.\nMS. MILLETT: It -- it -- the Harlow\nimmunity came from the same roots. Well, the -- what\nhappened in Wyatt was we said we will turn that into\nprotection for the government when we need to protect\nthe special functioning of government. You had no\nneed -- the Court had no need to do that in Wyatt\nbecause there was no governmental decisionmaking at\nstake there.\nBut the -- the same type of defense -- this\nCourt recognized in Richardson --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: So, I take it that your\nanswer is, yes, it would only have been a malice\ndefense, but that doesn't matter, notwithstanding Wyatt.\nIs that your answer?\nMS. MILLETT: The -- the answer is that it\nis the same type of defense that this Court recognized\nin prior cases as supporting qualified immunity when\nneeded to protect the decisions of the government. And\nRichardson itself recognized this --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Doesn't that suggest really\nthat we don't have a historical test anymore, that\nreally all we're looking to is policy considerations?\nMS. MILLETT: Not this case at all, because\nyou've got layers. You have layers of -- of history.\nYou have the history recognized in Richardson for -- for\nlawyers who are working at the behest of the government,\nthat specific history. You have the general history\nwhere -- where attorneys were provided a reasonable and\ngood-faith, malice, and probable cause type of defense,\nwhich again is the type of -- the type of defense that\ngets turned into qualified immunity when needed to\nprotect government's reasoned decisionmaking.\nIf I could reserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMs. Millett.\nWe'll hear from Ms. Saharsky first.\nMR. MCGILL: Oh. I'm sorry.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's all right.\nMs. Saharsky.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE A. SAHARSKY\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMS. SAHARSKY: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nPetitioner may assert qualified immunity on\nthe same terms as the fire department officials because\nhe was working side-by-side with them and under their\nsupervision on a personnel investigation. And this is\nreally exactly the situation that the Court reserved and\nanticipated in Richardson, that when you have a\nsituation where private and government workers work\nclosely together and you deny qualified immunity to the\nprivate person, it would directly affect the ability of\nthe government employees to do their jobs.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, if they don't\nwork closely together at all and it's just this one\nfellow conducting the investigation, he wouldn't have\nqualified immunity?\nMS. SAHARSKY: No. This is a situation in\nwhich there's a very close working relationship --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. No,\nhe --\nMS. SAHARSKY: I'm sorry.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- I'm wrong, or\nno --\nMS. SAHARSKY: He likely would have\nqualified immunity. The closeness of the relationship\nis very apparent here, but as a general matter, it is\nour position that when people are doing the business of\ngovernment, private people, can be sued under section\n1983 or Bivens, there should be a presumption in favor\nof qualified immunity.\nAnd Richardson is not to the contrary\nbecause that is a fairly unique case in which the\nprivate prison was so removed from the day-to-day\nworkings of government officials that it would not have\nfurthered the purposes of qualified immunity to give\nqualified immunity to the folks in those situations.\nSo, what we're talking about, like --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's just hard to imagine\nanything more imbued with state action than imprisoning\nsomeone. That's -- that's the problem I have in\nthinking about the case.\nMS. SAHARSKY: Right. I mean, several\nmembers of the Court said that in Richardson. And\nthe -- the Court's opinion really talked about the\nuniqueness of the situation there, that Tennessee was\ndoing something really out on the forefront in terms of\ngiving the day-to-day decisionmaking to the folks in\nthat situation in the private prison, and only checking\nup. There was monitoring, you know, annually. It was\nreally not much ongoing monitoring at all.\nAnd the -- the Richardson Court, you know,\nfound that to be a unique situation, but it\ndistinguished the situation that you have here, where\nyou have people --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Wasn't Richardson really all\nabout how market forces would make immunity unnecessary?\nAnd how is it that market forces play any different role\nin this case than they do in Richardson?\nMS. SAHARSKY: Well, we understand the\nCourt's discussion of market forces to be really\nimportant in the context there, where you don't have\nindividuals who are working closely with government.\nThe Court needed -- and the purposes of\nqualified immunity wouldn't be served in terms of\ndeterrence and in ensuring good government\ndecisionmaking. But the market forces discussion was\nthe Court reassuring itself in those circumstances that\nthere would still be private prison companies that would\nbe willing to take on the business of government and\nwould be able to do it, you know, consistent with the\nConstitution.\nSo, we don't understand the Court to have\nbeen setting out market forces as a test for qualified\nimmunity, because, as your question seems to suggest,\ntaken to its logical conclusion, any time a private\nperson is being hired by the government, you could say,\nwell, there's a market for the person, couldn't someone\nelse fill those shoes, et cetera, et cetera. So, we\nthink the Court's market forces decision was -- was\nfairly confined to what the Court itself described as a\nunique situation in Richardson. And the Court --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Do you think market forces\ndo operate differently here, or is it basically the same\nthing?\nMS. SAHARSKY: We do think that there's a\ndifference in that the attorney in this situation has\nprivate clients that that attorney can work for, whereas\nthe private prison company really could only work for\nthe government. But --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that in this\ncase the -- the firm that the lawyer was associated with\nsaid its dominant business was giving advice to local\ngovernment, local municipal government units. So --\nMS. SAHARSKY: Yes. I mean, that was an\nimportant part of the firm's business, but Mr. Filarsky\nis trained as an employment lawyer and has, you know,\nbroad training and expertise in employment-related\nmatters. So, there's certainly other work that could be\ndone. But, you know, we thought the core of the Court's\ndecision in Richardson was really focusing on the\npurposes of qualified immunity and whether they would be\nfurthered by giving them to the private prison and the\nprivate prison guards.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You seem --\nMS. SAHARSKY: The Court --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You seem to assume or to\nacknowledge or to concede that market forces do not\noperate for government employment, that all government\nemployees are doing it out of love, that --\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, why does market\nforce eliminate this defense for somebody who's an\nemployee of a private company but not for somebody who's\nan employee of the government?\nMS. SAHARSKY: I'm sorry, Justice Scalia. I\ndidn't mean to suggest that we thought that the market\nforces inquiry was particularly relevant to the -- to\nanswering the qualified immunity question. I'm just\nexplaining that the way we read the Court's opinion in\nRichardson, which obviously the members of this Court\nare the experts on, is that the Court was looking to\nmarket forces to reassure itself after it determined\nthat the purposes of qualified immunity just wouldn't be\nserved by giving an organization that was so far removed\nfrom the day-to-day workings of government the\nprotection of qualified immunity. The Court just -- the\nmarket forces really was just something unique to that\ncase.\nAnd what we think is the most relevant is\nwhat the Court started with both in the decision in\nWyatt and in Richardson, which is, is it necessary to\ngive qualified immunity here to make sure there's\nprincipled and fearless government decisionmaking? It's\nthe business of government that's important. And in\nthis case, although Petitioner is an attorney who has\nhis own fiduciary obligations, it is certainly the case\nthat when he was threatened during the conduct of this\npersonnel investigation, that that is something that\npotentially could chill his behavior.\nAnd to the extent that he cabins the advice\nthat he gave to the fire department officials, that\naffects the ability of government to do their job. And\nI might give the Court --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that would be a\nbreach of his duty as an attorney.\nMS. SAHARSKY: I'm saying --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And he would be subject\nto malpractice in that case. You -- seriously, I find\nthis whole argument about market forces with respect to\nattorneys representing people odd because there's a\nwhole slew of unemployed lawyers who will be happy to\ntake on any government service they can.\nSo, going back to the -- that's -- what I\nconsider the central argument you're making, which is:\nWill it chill advice? And I'm not sure how it can,\ngiven the independent fiduciary duty that an attorney\nhas to zealously guard his or her client's interest.\nMS. SAHARSKY: I'm saying that an attorney\nis in a difficult position there, and it's the same\nposition that a government attorney would be in, and the\nCourt has extended qualified immunity to government\nattorneys who are in this position, either giving legal\nadvice, like in the Burns case, or serving as\nprosecutors. And there's just no difference when he's\noperating in this case that would make him\ndistinguishable from a government attorney.\nTo answer another suggestion, I think, in\nyour question, the Court talked about, in terms of\ndeterrence and chilling, making sure that there were\ntalented candidates who wanted to take on the position\nof government. So, the Court has never said, you know,\nwe're concerned about wiping out the market entirely.\nIt said, you know, if there is a segment of the market\nthat will not take on this business anymore, that's a\nfairly serious problem when we need to make sure that\nthe government of -- of business is done.\nAnd if I can just make -- give the Court\nanother example to, perhaps outside the context of this\ncase, see how a private person being denied qualified\nimmunity would affect government employees, consider a\nfire department that has some full-time fire department\npersonnel and also some volunteer firefighters. When\nthey're working together in fighting a fire, you don't\nwant the volunteer firefighter thinking: Should I break\ndown this door? I might face personal liability.\nYou want him to make fearless decisions\nbecause whether he breaks down the door or not is going\nto directly affect the ability of the other folks who\nare trying to go into those homes, trying to stop the\nfire, to do their jobs.\nThat would also be true in the context of\ncourt security. The United States Marshals Service\nsometimes uses private security guards, and we have\ndirect supervision and control over them, but --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, what -- what if\nit's a 100 percent purely volunteer fire department? I\nmean, the town, whatever, contracts, out-sources,\nwhatever, but it's just run by volunteers. Is your\nanswer the same?\nI'm trying to get at your point about\nthey're working with or coordinating with government\nemployees. And your argument seems a little derivative.\nYou're saying the whole point is to protect the\ngovernment employees, and you have to have qualified\nimmunity for the non-employee to do that. But does your\nargument apply when there are no government employees\naround?\nMS. SAHARSKY: It's just difficult in the\nfire department situation, even if there is an\nall-volunteer force, that there wouldn't be some type of\ndirect supervision by the mayor, by the city council, et\ncetera. You know, that's -- particularly in the local\ngovernment situation, those folks would tend to work\nfairly closely together.\nIt is, in the case of deterrence and wanting\nfearless decisionmaking, a primary concern that we have\nabout protecting government. But we need to protect the\nindividuals to protect government. So, we do need to\nmake sure that their decisions aren't chilled, that\npersons like Petitioner are willing to take on\nrepresentation of this kind. And the Ninth Circuit's\nsuggestion that no private person should be -- should\nget qualified immunity, even when they're doing the\nday-to-day business of government, is just one that\ncan't be reconciled with this Court's decisions in Wyatt\nand Richardson.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There's another part of\nqualified immunity, and I know it's not teed up in this\ncase, but why is it reasoned decisionmaking to recognize\nyou can't enter a home without a warrant, but you can\ntell the occupant to bring out every item you want to\nsee? It seems to me that that's not -- that there --\nthere's clearly established law to say that's wrong.\nMS. SAHARSKY: Well, the Ninth Circuit found\nthat it wasn't clearly established law. I understand\nthat it's a fairly difficult Fourth Amendment question.\nBut as you say, it wasn't teed up in this case. It\nwasn't -- there wasn't a petition on this question. It\nwasn't raised in the brief in opposition. You know, in\nlight of the fact that the Ninth Circuit found it wasn't\nclearly established, it probably wouldn't make sense for\nthe Court to address it.\nOne thing I might point out along those\nlines is that both the district court made a finding, on\npage 49 of the Joint Appendix, and then the court of\nappeals made a finding in its opinion, and this was the\nreason that the court of appeals found it wasn't clearly\nestablished, was because there was no attendant threat\nin terms of employment consequences to Respondent in\nthis case.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Another question that's\nnot teed up and I guess not presented -- I'm just\ncurious to know about the history of the case. Was it\nargued that there was no state action here? Or is there\n-- and in your view, is that a very simple question to\nanswer?\nMS. SAHARSKY: In terms of the argument,\nPetitioner conceded throughout the litigation that he\nwas a state actor. In the complaint, Respondent\nactually suggested he was an employee of the city. In\nterms of whether he was asserting the authority of State\nlaw, it does seem fairly clear that he was asserting the\nauthority of State law here.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. McGill.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL A. MCGILL\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. MCGILL: Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nPetitioner has not demonstrated a historical\nbasis of immunity at common law for somebody in Mr.\nFilarsky's situation, but the Petitioner has also not\nshown that the immunity's purposes also serve Mr.\nFilarsky's situation here.\nI want to put those two issues aside. We'll\ntalk about that in a minute, but I want to address the\nissue that has been most -- discussed the most, which is\nthe Petitioner's test.\nThe test that the Petitioner proposes that\nthis Court adopt is one that is very difficult to use.\nThe test is simply whether the individual is temporarily\nretained in the -- in the functional equivalent of a\ngovernment employee, considering three factors. The\nthree factors are: one, the nature of the role\nperformed; the close supervision and/or coordination\nwith a government official --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, what about your test?\nWhat is your test?\nMR. MCGILL: Well, our test is Richardson.\nI think Richardson is the correct analysis. The Court\nstarts with looking at a historical basis of an immunity\nat common law and then from there works to the policy\nreasons.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, suppose you have a\nlawyer who's a part-time employee. Does that matter?\nMR. MCGILL: A part-time employee of a --\nJUSTICE ALITO: A part-time employee of a\ngovernment unit.\nMR. MCGILL: Well, he would be -- he would\nreceive Harlow immunity.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So, the difference, your\ndifference, is between an employee and an independent\ncontractor?\nMR. MCGILL: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE ALITO: And isn't that often a very\ndifficult determination under the law?\nMR. MCGILL: No, I don't -- I don't think\nso. Any time -- like in Mr. Filarsky's situation, Mr.\nFilarsky is a for-profit law firm. You know, he sells\nhimself as a -- as an experienced professional in the\nfield providing legal services to the city --\nJUSTICE ALITO: But there are a lot of --\nthere are a lot of -- I think -- well, there are a lot\nof law firms. I think all law firms other than public\ninterest firms are for-profit firms, and the attorneys\nare part-time employees of municipalities and other\ngovernment units to perform various functions, part-time\njudges, part-time prosecutors.\nMR. MCGILL: Well, the Court has made a\ndistinction in its past decisions about functions that\nare integral to the judicial process. So, when you talk\nabout a judge or a prosecutor, that's a -- that's a\nspecial function. That's sort of a different situation.\nBut never has there been an immunity for an\nattorney just because they happen to be an attorney.\nThere is no historical basis for that. Neither the\nPetitioner nor the Respondent nor the seven amici\nhave found --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, now you're talking\nabout history. But I want to know how we are -- how the\ncourts are to determine and why it should matter how a\nmunicipality sets this up.\nSuppose the town had hired Mr. Filarsky as a\npart-time town employee. So, he has a certain -- he has\na 1-year contract or 6-month contract or something for a\ncertain amount of money to perform services for a\ncertain number of hours. You would say that he would be\nentitled to qualified immunity then.\nMR. MCGILL: No I would say that he would\nnot be entitled to qualified immunity.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why?\nMR. MCGILL: Because he's a --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Because he's an employee.\nThey pass a resolution saying he's an employee of the\ntown.\nMR. MCGILL: Well, they passed a resolution\nto hire him and his firm to provide those services on a\ntemporary basis or a basis of 6 months, but he still is\nan outside attorney, and he's probably got -- has other\nclients and has other interests involved. And the\nsituation is different. It's an entirely different\nsystem when you have a private law firm operating for\nprofit contracting --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Year-long employment is not\nemployment? If I accepted a government job for only a\nyear, I'm not a government employee? I don't understand\nthat.\nMR. MCGILL: Well, as I understood the\nhypothetical, if -- if that individual is -- is working\nas an employee of the city, then --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: He's working as an\nemployee. He's hired for 1 year. It's a 1-year\ncontract. Why -- why does that make him not an\nemployee? Or is it the fact that he's a lawyer? And\nall lawyers have a certain independent responsibility.\nThey can't do some things that government superiors\nmight tell them to do, right? So, are you going to say\nall lawyers are -- are -- cannot plead qualified\nimmunity?\nMR. MCGILL: Well, our position here in this\ncase is that Mr. Filarsky was not necessarily acting in\nthe role of an attorney. He was functioning as an\ninternal affairs investigator. And it's doubtful that\nhe would have maintained an attorney-client relationship\nwith the city given that he was hired or retained to\nconduct a factfinding report.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It makes it even easier\nthen. I -- I thought the attorney thing would help you,\nbut if he's not even functioning as an attorney, he's\nfunctioning as a government investigator.\nMR. MCGILL: But if he has other clients and\nhe works for profit, then he operates in a different\nsystem.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nMR. MCGILL: Then he's not subject to the\nsame system --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But if they had employed\nhim for a year, exclusive employment, no other clients,\nyou'd say that's a different case?\nMR. MCGILL: If they employed him for longer\nthan a year?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, I'm saying a year; in\nfact, 364 days.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay? And the deal was\nyou're -- you're going to work for us and nobody else.\nYou have no other clients.\nMR. MCGILL: Well, I think then that\nthat's -- that's where you'd have to look at the policy\nconsiderations. If you feel --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, I understand that.\nHow do you look at them?\nMR. MCGILL: If he's still --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Does that come out -- case\ncome out the same way or not?\nMR. MCGILL: No, I don't think it does. If\nhe's taking that position for that term, that 1-year\nperiod, to make money for profit, and the next year he's\ngoing to work for somebody else --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Everybody takes a position\nto make money for profit. How many government employees\nwork for free?\nMR. MCGILL: But he may be, in that\ninstance, trying to form a relationship with that\nmunicipality and enter into a longer term contract.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, he's not. He's not --\nI mean, yes, he may be, I guess. But assume he's not.\nHe's just a lawyer who's been hired for 364 days to work\nfor nobody but the -- but the government. And you still\nsay that he has no -- no immunity in what he does.\nMR. MCGILL: He gets --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: To investigate for the\ngovernment.\nMR. MCGILL: Absolutely not. He gets no\nimmunity in that situation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Two years, though? Three\nyears? I'm a lawyer who --\nMR. MCGILL: The longer you go --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- enters a contract for\nlife with this -- with this government to investigate.\nAt that point, does he get the immunity?\nMR. MCGILL: No, because there's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Still not?\nMR. MCGILL: There is no historical basis\nfor immunity. It just wasn't there. For that function\nthat -- that Mr. Filarsky was providing, there is no\nhistorical basis for it. And, typically, that would end\nthe Court's question. That would end the inquiry. You\nonly get to the policy considerations --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But don't we have\ncases --\nJUSTICE ALITO: I thought you were drawing a\ndistinction between employees and independent\ncontractors. Is that the distinction you're drawing or\nnot?\nMR. MCGILL: Well, the distinction really\nis, if you are a private actor, you're subject to a\ndifferent set of rules. You're subject to the market\npressures and the competition that are going to correct\nyour behavior and are going to satisfy the same purposes\nthat immunity provides.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What would have happened if\nAbraham Lincoln today were there? And I gather what\nhappened is they thought the local prosecutor is good,\nbut Lincoln is better. So, we'll let Lincoln prosecute\nthis case.\nNow, in your view, Abraham Lincoln would not\nhave had immunity, but the local prosecutor would have.\nMR. MCGILL: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: They did exactly the same\nthing, by the way; it was just that Lincoln had a better\nreputation. Every word was the same.\nMR. MCGILL: As a historical basis, there\ndoes not appear to be immunity for private prosecutors.\nHowever, this Court over the years has provided immunity\nfor the judicial --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But in your -- I'm asking\nyou, in your opinion, when I write this opinion, is I\ncould say not even Abraham Lincoln, when he acted as a\npublic prosecutor brought in for the occasion? In your\nopinion, he should not have the immunity that Joe Jones,\nthe local prosecutor, would have?\nMR. MCGILL: I --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm just trying to get your\nopinion.\nMR. MCGILL: I think that that's a much\ncloser call --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is it because it's Abraham\nLincoln or --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You should say section 1983\ndidn't exist. That's your answer --\nMR. MCGILL: What?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- to that one, right?\nMR. MCGILL: But I think it's a much closer\ncall because he was engaged in a prosecutorial function,\nwhich this Court over the years --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But investigatory\nfunctions -- they don't get immunity. So, if Lincoln\nhad looked into it and said, you know, I've looked into\nthis; I don't think we should prosecute. And what they\nsaid was use your judgment.\nMR. MCGILL: No.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So, there are\nproblems with both standards both ways. This is one of\nthe things that -- that is bothering me.\nMR. MCGILL: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Imagine in this case the\nlawyer sat down with the other firemen, the supervisor\nand so forth, and they said -- not necessarily this\nevent; they said we want to do X. And the lawyer said:\nI have to tell you, it's unclear whether X is\nconstitutional or not. Now, because it's unclear, I\nalso have to tell you that if you do it, you will not be\nheld personally liable.\nNow, can a lawyer give that advice? Yes.\nWhen he does, of course, he's subjecting himself to\npersonal liability. Now, it's that conflict that is\nworrying me, among other things.\nSo, what do we do about that? The lawyer is\nbeing asked to give advice to the client. Under the\ncanons of ethics, he ought to have their interest at\nheart, and in doing that, he's subjecting himself to\nwhat could be hundreds of thousands, millions of dollars\nworth of damages or whatever in suits for malpractice.\nIs there a way that we side with you out of that\ndilemma?\nMR. MCGILL: I don't think that that's\nnecessarily an immunity question; it's more of a\nliability question because it very well may be that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, no, no. What I'm\nassuming in the question is, since it's a close\nquestion, he has to worry about a court saying: You\nwere wrong in saying it was legal. It was not legal.\nThe matter was unclear, but it was not legal.\nAt that point, he becomes subject to much\ndamages. But, of course, the others do not, and he had\nto tell them go ahead with it. You understand my point.\nMR. MCGILL: I do.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So, what is the answer?\nMR. MCGILL: But -- but I think what -- what\nit is -- the difference there is that there you have an\nattorney just providing advice, which is different than\nwhat happened here, where you actually had the attorney\nengaged --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, that may be, but what\nI'm trying to work out is what is your set of rules? If\nwe don't say -- if we don't say you have immunity, and\nyou agree that this is a bad dilemma at least in my\nhypothetical case, I'm trying to work out what set of\nrules you advocate in order to either say, well, that's\ntoo bad, the dilemma is there, we can't get around it,\nor something else. That's why I want your answer.\nMR. MCGILL: If the attorney under those\ncircumstances could be held liable for a constitutional\nviolation for simply giving advice and he happens to be\na private attorney working for profit, then he wouldn't\nhave immunity.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I change it slightly, and\nhe puts them up to it.\nMR. MCGILL: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because I don't know why he\ncouldn't. I mean, you know, he says go do it. Or, in\nother words, my hypothetical -- okay, go ahead.\nMR. MCGILL: I think the answer's the same.\nIf somehow under those circumstances the attorney could\nbe held liable for giving that advice, and he's -- he's\na private attorney, and he doesn't pass the Richardson\ntest, then he would not be entitled to immunity.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your case --\nMR. MCGILL: So, there's no -- there's no --\nI'm sorry.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, you can finish\nyour answer.\nMR. MCGILL: There's certainly no -- there\nis no historical basis of immunity just for giving legal\nadvice. The Petitioner hasn't pointed this Court to any\nfirmly rooted tradition of an immunity.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your case\nhighlights -- I think is a very good example of why the\nlawyer ought to have qualified immunity. I mean, this\nwas a case where it looks like there's a lot of\nthreatening and bullying going on. I mean, the -- the\nlawyer says -- you know, we're going to figure out a way\nto name you, Mr. Filarsky. You're issuing an illegal\norder. If you want to take that chance go right ahead.\nYou might want to think -- take a minute to think about\nit.\nI mean, it seems exactly the kind of\nsituation for which qualified immunity was -- was\ndeveloped. We want Filarsky to give what he -- do what\nhe thinks is the right thing in this situation. We\ndon't want him to be worried about the fact that he\nmight be sued. And you have a lawyer here saying, well,\nif you do that, I'm going to sue you. So, Filarsky\nnaturally, or some lawyer in that situation, is going to\nthink, wow, do I really want to run that risk?\nIsn't that exactly why we have qualified\nimmunity?\nMR. MCGILL: No. And the reason for that is\nthat because Mr. Filarsky is a private individual, he\ndoesn't need qualified immunity. You know, Richardson\nis decided in 1997, but in 2003, the Ninth Circuit\nissued its decision in Gonzalez v. Spencer. And in\nGonzalez v. Spencer, the court held that private\nattorneys like Mr. Filarsky don't need immunity; they\ndon't get immunity. So, the law in the land since\n2003 --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's easy\nfor a judge to say because they're absolutely immune,\nbut for the lawyer who is sitting there and saying --\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- saying I'm going\nto sue you, if you were -- well, you are a lawyer. And\nyou're sitting in that situation. Isn't that going to\nenter into your mind? You say, well, sue all you want;\nI don't care; this is the right answer.\nMR. MCGILL: But, for nearly a decade, the\nlaw within the Ninth Circuit has been that private\nattorneys don't receive immunity.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.\nMR. MCGILL: And that -- the fact that is,\nis that Mr. Filarsky knew going into that -- that\ninvestigation that he wouldn't have immunity for\nanything he -- he did. And it didn't deter him; it\ndidn't make him --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, how do you\nknow?\nMR. MCGILL: Well, because he -- in the\nlight of the threats that he received, he still went\nforward with the -- what was deemed to be an\nunconstitutional search. So, the policy purposes of,\nyou know, wanting to prevent unwarranted timidity and\ndeterring talented candidates from working for the\ngovernment --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, he had -- he\nhad the chief issue the order, right?\nMR. MCGILL: Well, the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And then the chief\nlater on says, well, he told me to issue the order. I\nmean, I'm not quite sure that things went exactly as\nthey would if you had qualified immunity.\nMR. MCGILL: Well, Mr. Filarsky said -- and\nthis is what he said on the record; it's in the\ntranscripts in the Joint Appendix -- is that he's\nissuing the order on behalf of the department. That's\nwhat he said. And then there was some -- some\ndiscussion back and forth between Mr. Delia's attorney\nand Mr. Filarsky, and that's what led to the\nformalization of -- of the order.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I understand that\nthere is a lot of bad, cowardly legal advice being given\nin the Ninth Circuit.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't really know that,\nbut you don't know the opposite, either, do you?\nMR. MCGILL: I don't.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why didn't you\ncross-appeal on the clearly established law? Because\nthen -- then you could concede, so, arguendo, he had\nqualified immunity, but the advice that he gave was\ncontrary to clearly established law.\nMR. MCGILL: So, why did the Petitioner --\nor the Respondent not cross-appeal?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why didn't you bring up\nthat -- that issue?\nMR. MCGILL: I think it was -- that's sort\nof the law of the case, is that the Ninth Circuit found\nthat there was a constitutional violation. So, we\nobviously didn't want to appeal that.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: No, but -- but whether it\nwas clearly established. In other words, what we had\nhere was a recognition: We can't go into the house; we\ncan't go into a house, private house, without a warrant.\nSo -- in fact, Filarsky said something about I know a\nway -- a way to get around that; we just tell them to\nbring out the items.\nMR. MCGILL: Right. I -- my personal\nopinion and our position has been is that it -- the law\nwas clearly established on that. Why the decision was\nmade not to cross-appeal on that, I'm not -- I'm not\nsure. But --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Are you saying it's clearly\nestablished that there isn't a difference between going\nin and looking for the insulation, et cetera, and\ntelling him to bring it out? Is it clearly established\nthat the -- that as a condition of employment in a\nsituation like this, the employee cannot be required to\nsubmit to a search?\nMR. MCGILL: I -- I think it's pretty well\nknown that the house is --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well,\nparticularly --\nMR. MCGILL: -- is --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, even as -- the\nreason it's an issue is because he says, look, I've got\nthis stuff at my house. That's how his -- his defense\nis. I haven't used it; I've got the insulation there.\nSo, you think it's still clearly established that it\nviolates the Fourth Amendment for the city to say, okay,\nwell, show it to us if you want to use that as your\ndefense?\nMR. MCGILL: Yes, I do because it -- it --\ncertainly, Mr. Filarsky didn't have any reasonable\nsuspicion to believe that Mr. Delia was lying or was\nbeing dishonest. He certainly didn't have probable\ncause. He had a hunch. And then that's what he said,\nI -- I -- he said it as -- at the -- during the\ninterview that I -- I don't necessarily know that you're\nlying; I just -- I want to see if you are.\nSo, you know, the investigation turned from\nwanting to see whether Mr. Delia was off work on false\npretenses into, well, I don't have anything there; so,\nlet me just see if he's lying just for the sake of it.\nAnd that's when they ended up issuing that order.\nI think that would be a different situation\nif perhaps you could argue that they had a reasonable\nsuspicion or had some cause to search his house, but\nhere they didn't. So, I think it is under those facts\nclearly established.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. McGill, back to\nimmunity, what -- one thing I don't understand about our\nlaw here, you say there was no historic basis. And I\nhave to concede that that's right. Seems to me that\nthere's -- there was only a malice defense. But isn't\nthat always true when it comes to a -- a private person?\nIn other words, of course there's no historic basis for\nqualified immunity. This kind of immunity was developed\nin 1970. It's sort of by definition there's no historic\nbasis for this sort of immunity.\nSo, to say that the historic basis matters\nis really to say that private people never get Harlow\nimmunity.\nMR. MCGILL: Well, I think that that's\nright. There was not qualified immunity at common law,\nbut there was absolute immunity. And in -- there -- I\nmean, I can't go back and think about all the different\nimmunities that may or may not have existed, but I -- I\ndo know that the Petitioner has the burden to bring\nforth a firmly rooted tradition. This Court has said\nover and over that it's not going to create new\nimmunities.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But the Court's cases are a\nmix of history and -- and policy. The Court has\nrecognized both absolute immunity -- has recognized\nabsolute immunity in instances where there wasn't\nabsolute immunity at common law; isn't that true?\nMR. MCGILL: Right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and the rule about\nmalice being -- being the criterion of liability, that\napplied not just to -- not just to private lawyers but\nto government lawyers as well, didn't it?\nMR. MCGILL: It did. That that -- that that\ngood-faith defense applied --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, if we're going to be\nhistorically faithful, we should deny any qualified\nimmunity to government lawyers or expand the government\nimmunity to -- for government lawyers so they can do\nanything so long as it's not malicious?\nMR. MCGILL: Well, that -- that's what this\nCourt would have to do.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. MCGILL: It would have to basically\nexpand what was at common law --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. MCGILL: -- a defense.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, the devil with history,\nright?\nMR. MCGILL: Well, it would result in this\nCourt having to expand that immunity that it expanded in\nHarlow to private individuals. And our position is that\nbecause a private individual like Mr. Filarsky is a\nmarket participant, the purposes of immunity aren't\nserved. They just simply aren't needed. And I was\nmentioning earlier about --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about -- what about\nthe argument that Filarsky makes, that if there were to\nbe a proceeding against him, inevitably the witnesses\nwould be the government employees? They would be the\nbattalion chiefs, the fire chief. So, one of the\nreasons for the qualified immunity is you don't want to\ndisturb government employees in the routine performance\nof their work. Certainly, in this case, there would be\ndisruption, distraction of these government employees.\nMR. MCGILL: Well, there probably would be\nsome distraction. That would be inevitable, but it\nwould be no different than the distraction that the\ngovernment would face when a private attorney is sued\nfor any number of claims, malpractice or, you know, some\nState law violation.\nAnd to say that the -- the distraction that\nthe government is going to face based on just what is\nprobably a small sliver of the big pie, which is, you\nknow, 1983 litigation, is pretty speculative. And, of\ncourse, it doesn't answer the question that the -- the\ngovernment employer itself can still be liable under\nMonell.\nSo, even though the immunity may kick in and\nthe individuals may get off or may not have to stand\nsuit, it -- there are still occasions when the\ngovernment is still going to be there. So, that\ndistraction is still going to exist.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if Filarsky was\nthere, you know, hired to help the fire department with\nthese -- and he did absolutely nothing? He just sits\nthere and watches. The battalion chief says, I want to\ndo this; I'm going to go get the stuff; you bring it all\nout. And he just -- he just sits there, doesn't see any\nreason to offer any legal advice or opinion. Could you\nstill sue him under 1983?\nMR. MCGILL: Well, I don't think he would be\nliable, but I don't think under that situation, he would\nhave participated in the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Really? He has an\nobligation as a lawyer to speak up if he thinks\nsomething illegal is going on. That's his job. And he\ndoesn't -- he just sits there quietly?\nMR. MCGILL: No. I don't know that -- that\nhe would be liable under section 1983. But if he were,\nand he were a private lawyer, he would not have\nqualified immunity. He would still be under the same\nRichardson test where there's no historical basis for\nit, and because he's the private individual working\nunder -- you know, working for profit and subject to\nmarket pressures, he wouldn't --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if he -- this\nfor profits -- I -- the significance of that eludes me.\nSometimes people act out of, you know, public service,\nand particularly in these sorts of situations, the town\nneeds a lawyer, and he's helping out. What -- if he\nwere purely a volunteer, it would be a different answer?\nMR. MCGILL: If he were purely a volunteer,\nit very well might be a different answer because some of\nthose policy concerns that -- that Richardson talked\nabout and discussed may not be present. So, you have to\napply the test to the situation you have before you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And, well -- and\nwhat if he gives the city a discount? He's working for\nhalf -- half his fee because it's the city. He wants to\nhelp out, but he can't do it totally for free. So, it's\n50 percent his normal rate.\nMR. MCGILL: I don't know that 50 percent\nmakes a difference. And earlier, we were discussing\nthat -- the 1-year or the 2-year and so forth, the\nlength of the contract. I don't think that those things\nnecessarily make a difference. The point is whether Mr.\nFilarsky was undertaking that representation or that\nrole in a manner that made him subject to other regular\nmarket pressures.\nIf he was performing a function and\ncompeting against other lawyers or other investigators\nperforming that same function, then the point is there,\nyou know, he isn't going to be as timid because he's\ngoing to want to do a good job. And the same policy\nconcerns that are present for that government lawyer\naren't there for him as a private individual.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, suppose a municipality\nwere to -- or a State were to abolish all the civil\nservice rules and all the special rules and go back to\nemployment at will for government employees. Would that\n-- would that take with it the whole qualified immunity\nregime?\nMR. MCGILL: I don't think that it would.\nIn other words, is the question whether or not, if we\nabolished the merit system or civil service system,\nwould qualified immunity still be needed?\nI think if that were the question, that --\nwell, that's a tough question to answer. But it very\nwell may not be because, you know, part of the decision\nin Richardson here was -- it was -- they are operating\nwithin a different system. Private versus public. And\nif you start to make the public system look more like a\nprivate system, then it very well may be that immunity\nwon't be needed at all.\nJUSTICE ALITO: It seems strange because the\nimmunities, at least some of the immunities, long\npre-date the -- the institution of the civil service\nsystem. Everybody is subject to market forces. Every\nperson who works is influenced by market forces to some\ndegree; isn't that correct?\nMR. MCGILL: I think that that's correct,\nbut when you have a civil service system, a merit\nsystem, it's -- it is not as easy to correct behavior as\nit would be for, say, a private person. For, like, Mr.\nFilarsky, if he was not performing at -- at the level\nthat the City of Rialto had hoped, he can be replaced\nand quite easily.\nFor a government employee, though, there are\nobviously the civil service protections, and it's not so\neasy to do that. So, that's --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's not true of most\nlawyers.\nMR. MCGILL: Pardon me.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Most lawyers are not\npart of the civil service -- internal lawyers are not\npart of the civil service system. They're generally\nconsidered employees at will, at least most of the\ncircuit courts have so held.\nMR. MCGILL: I'm not familiar with\nwhether --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That they're\npolicymakers and, as such, are not subject to civil\nservice protections.\nMR. MCGILL: Well, I -- I know that some\nsubsections of lawyers within a government can be\nrepresented. So, they very well may have some\nprotection, but maybe it's not quite to the extent that\nmore of the rank and file would have.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, the political\nappointees within the United States Department of\nJustice are not protected by civil service. So, should\nthey lack immunity?\nMR. MCGILL: No, because they would -- they\nwould get it under Harlow. They would have immunity\nunder Harlow.\nJUSTICE ALITO: They're subject to market\nforces, aren't they?\nMR. MCGILL: They very well may be, and it\nmay be for me to say that maybe they shouldn't have an\nimmunity or it's not needed. But at this point, the law\nis, under Harlow, that they would receive it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What if I told you that all\nthe lawyers at the Department of Justice are regarded as\nbeing employed at will and that all of them can be\nfired?\nMR. MCGILL: Well, I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think the rest of\nthem don't -- don't have any protection?\nMR. MCGILL: I think that the answer would\nbe the same in that they very well may not need\nqualified immunity because those pressures and those\nconcerns underlying immunity aren't there.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wow. That's going to be\ndisappointing news for all those attorneys at Justice --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. MCGILL: I just want to go back and talk\nabout the Petitioner's test a little bit, too, because\nthe Court had some concerns about it. And I share those\nsame concerns, and that's that the test requires a\nfactual analysis, you know, being temporarily retained\nin close coordination and supervision. Those are highly\nfactual questions that aren't going to bode well for\nearly resolution of a case.\nAnd a -- the lawyer is going to be able to\nplead around that test very easily and take the case\ninto -- into full-blown litigation and discovery and so\nforth. So, that -- that test is problematic.\nIn addition, as I understand it, the test is\ngoing to be extended well beyond attorneys. The test\nresults in anybody working for the government under, you\nknow, close coordination or supervision, whatever that\nmeans, is going to get immunity. So, that is well\nbeyond attorneys, to anybody. Anybody who contracts\nwith the government and meets that factual test is now\ngoing to have immunity.\nAnd that's something -- that's a huge step\nthat this Court, you know, should not take, especially\nwhen there is no historical basis for it and the policy\nconcerns are not present.\nBut even if you apply that test to\nMr. Filarsky, under these facts, Mr. Filarsky would not\nhave immunity. He wasn't temporarily retained. He\nworked for the City of Rialto for 14 years as -- as a\nbusiness, for profit. He had many clients, and the City\nof Rialto was one of them. It wasn't that he was\ntemporarily retained. So, he doesn't even meet that\nelement of the Petitioner's test.\nMr. Filarsky was not performing a --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are all of these --\nare all of these objections applicable as well to the\ndetermination of whether there is state action from the\nattorney's conduct?\nMR. MCGILL: The concerns about there being\na factual --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.\nMR. MCGILL: -- inquiry?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.\nMR. MCGILL: I don't think so. I mean, as\nan attorney, I would have to certify in a pleading that\n-- the relationship between the person I'm suing and the\ngovernment. So, I think that there would have to be\ninformation put forth in the pleading that would\nestablish that, and I don't know that one could simply\nmake up state action for purposes of pursuing a 1983\naction.\nSo, it -- it may be that there's a factual\ninquiry, but I don't think it's as great or nearly as\ngreat as -- as the temporarily retained or close\ncoordination components to the -- or the Petitioner's\ntest.\nMr. Filarsky was not performing a function\nthat is uniquely governmental. Investigating workplace\nmisconduct is not a governmental function, or it's not a\nprototypical governmental function.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But your -- your\nobjection is not that he was investigating workplace\nconduct; your objection is that he was ordering people\nto tell your client to bring out stuff that was in his\nhouse.\nMR. MCGILL: Correct. But it was under the\n-- the auspices of a -- a workplace investigation, if\nyou will.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but telling\npeople basically either executing a search or in effect\nexecuting a search, that is a uniquely governmental\nfunction.\nMR. MCGILL: Executing a -- a formal search\nby the government is something -- that's a role that the\ngovernment performs, but I wouldn't say that -- I\nwouldn't equate, you know, executing a search with what\noccurred here.\nWell, let me -- let me restate that, I\nguess. What I mean to say is that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You don't want to say that.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. MCGILL: Mr. Filarsky -- the function,\nthe role that he was performing was that of an internal\naffairs investigator.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but if -- if he did\nthe same thing for a private company -- he could do the\nsame thing for a private company, say, you know, you're\ngoing to get fired unless you substantiate your story by\nbringing the stuff out of your house. That wouldn't be\na search -- an unlawful search; right? It could have\nhappened in a private company.\nMR. MCGILL: It could, and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. MCGILL: Yes, it very well could have.\nAnd that's my point, is that what Mr. Filarsky did in\nhis role was not uniquely governmental. He wasn't\nperforming that governmental function.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, there's very little\nthat is uniquely governmental. I mean, my goodness, if\nwe denied immunity to -- to all those acts that are not\nuniquely governmental, there would be very little\nimmunity, I'm afraid.\nMR. MCGILL: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMs. Millett, you have 3 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. MILLETT: Thank you.\nJustice Breyer, your dilemma is -- sits at\nthe crux of why qualified immunity is appropriate here\nbecause not only do you have the lawyer saying, well,\nyou'll be all okay, but I'm going to be going down in\nthis lawsuit; the lawyer's going to have a duty to\ninform his client that, in fact, this will lead to\nlitigation. You will be protected in your personal\ncapacity, but guess what, litigation is going to ensue.\nThat can influence and deter both lawyers'\nwillingness to work for the government at these cut\nrates or pro bono rates, their -- subconsciously, the\nadvice they give, and it can make the government not\nwant to act on the advice, which is precisely what we\nwant to protect.\nNothing like that was happening in\nRichardson. The government was nowhere on the scene\nwhen the constitutional decisions being challenged --\nthey weren't even percipient witnesses in that\nsituation.\nThe second point I want to make is fiduciary\nduty doesn't change it other than it confirms that he's\nworking in the interest of the government, but every\nagent has a fiduciary duty to their principal. And so,\nyou can't deny qualified immunity on that ground or\nyou'll have a sweeping decision on your hands.\nThe market concerns, Justice Sotomayor --\nthe test is not whether a warm body could be found to\nfulfill this operation if he won't do it. This is a\ncompletely different market from Richardson, where\nthere's only one client for prisons, and that's the\ngovernment.\nHere, the government is competing for the\nservices. When it needs a skilled attorney, when it\nwants people of the caliber that the government service\nneeds and deserves, it is competing. And right now, as\nthe Chief Justice recognized, a lot of times, including\nfor Mr. Filarsky, that's done at discount rates.\nThese folks -- this is already a marginal\ndecision. And if you want to talk about market\ndecisions, then you're going to push that weight. And\nif the answer is, if you decide to take on this pro bono\nrepresentation or cut your rates out of public duty and\n-- and a willingness to serve your government, guess\nwhat comes with it: You alone will be left holding the\nbag at the end of this for the governmental misconduct.\nSection 1983 is supposed to deter\ngovernmental conduct. It is not supposed to deter the\nreasonable advice given by lawyers to governmental\nclients.\nIf the Court has no further questions.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel,\ncounsel.\n"
