CRAIG JETT\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. JETT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nIn this case, the parties agree that Federal\ncourts, including this Court, have addressed\nnonstatutory defenses for almost 200 years and that\nCongress, in enacting criminal law statutes, legislate\nagainst a background of Anglo-Saxon common law, such\nthat a defense of duress was likely contemplated by\nCongress when it passed the gun control statutes. It\nis, therefore, required that courts apply defenses,\nsuch as the duress defense, based on the background\nprinciple of construction that the prosecution must\nprove criminal intent beyond a reasonable doubt.\nThe Government would have this Court discount\nthe development of over 110 years of common law that\nhas produced a substantial, well-established, well-\nreasoned majority rule in both State and in Federal\ncourts that places the burden on the Government to\ndisprove the absence of duress once that defense has\nbeen raised by the evidence.\nThe development of the majority rule began\nwith this Court's decision in Davis v. United States in\n1895.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Jett, do I take it,\nfrom what you've just said, that you are recognizing\nthis is a question of Federal common law and not due\nprocess, so that if Congress placed the burden on the\ndefendant, there would be no constitutional infirmity?\nYou're just arguing that this is the Federal common\nlaw?\nMR. JETT: Our -- our first issue and our\nfirst contention is that Federal common law will govern\nthe decision in this particular case, but we also have\na due process point that we also believe is germane.\nBut --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You -- you -- then you\nthink that Congress could not say that the defendant\nhas the burden on the question of duress.\nMR. JETT: We think that Congress could not\nunder the -- the precedents of this Court and under the\n-- the basic common law construction that's\nfundamental, I think, to the -- to the criminal law in\nthis -- in this country.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What do you do with\nMartin against Ohio?\nMR. JETT: Well, we understand about Martin\nv. Ohio, Your Honor, and we think that -- that based on\nrecent precedents, Martin v. Ohio should be\nreconsidered. The -- the significant issue is that\nduress is based on the fact that there -- that there\nmust be free will, and if free will is dispensed with,\nin this case by duress, then the -- the defendant\ndoesn't have the requisite criminal intent. And -- and\nin our -- and since the beginning of -- since before\nthe beginning of common law in -- in our system, it has\nbeen recognized that in order to have a criminal -- a\ncrime, there have to be two things: one, a vicious\nwill and the other an act -- an evil act concurrent\nwith the vicious will. And --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, there may be --\nthere may be crimes where duress would vitiate an\nintent element, but there may be other crimes where it\nwouldn't. And -- and I don't understand your argument\nto be -- is it that in every case duress negates an\nelement of the crime or only in some cases?\nMR. JETT: Well, we think that in -- that in\nevery criminal case, with possibly the exception of --\nof public welfare cases, that -- that there is an\nunderlying background construction for our criminal\nlaw, which requires the Government to prove beyond a\nreasonable doubt criminal intent.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Which is the easier of the\ntwo cases for the defendant? A, the case where the\nargument is a burden of proof should be on -- on the --\nthe State as a due process matter or a common law\nmatter in an insanity defense and, B, in a duress\ndefense?\nMR. JETT: Which is easier for the State?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, either way.\nMR. JETT: Well, we -- we contend that in a\n-- a -- duress is -- is different. Insanity deals with\nreally the internal workings of somebody's mind, so\nthat's perhaps more difficult for the State. But in a\n-- in a duress case, you're dealing not only with the\ninternal workings but also external factors as well --\nas well that impose somebody else's will upon the\ndefendant.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I would think that it's\neasier in -- you know, we had -- we had a -- this term\nanother case in which the argument is that you cannot\nhave a separate insanity defense essentially and -- and\nexclude from the mens rea element of a crime the -- the\nlack of -- of mental capacity to -- to have that mens\nrea. This is the same thing you're arguing before us.\nAnd -- and it seems to me that if it applies to\nduress, it applies even -- even more strongly to -- to\ninsanity. How can an insane person form the intent to\ncommit a crime that -- that requires mens rea?\nMR. JETT: Well, we -- we agree that -- I\nagree -- we agree that an insane person cannot form\nthat particular intent. We think that they are similar\nexcept that the duress case is perhaps easier for the\n-- for the defense because we have external factors\nthat often bear on what the defense is unlike --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but we've held, at\nleast under the M'Naghten version of the defense, that\nthe State -- that the burden can be put on the\ndefendant to show that he was not insane under the\nM'Naghten test.\nMR. JETT: Well, we -- and we understand\nthat, and again, our --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And as Justice Scalia said\nand as I was considering in asking my question, in your\ncase we know that there was a conscious, knowing and\nintentional, in some sense, act when -- when the person\nbought -- bought the weapons. She says the intent, of\ncourse, was induced by -- by the threat. It seems to\nme you have a more difficult case than in the insanity\ncase.\nMR. JETT: Well, our -- our -- we think that\nthey're -- that they're similar because both deal with\n-- with the mental state, and -- and then historically,\nat least since -- since 1895 in this Court, this Court\nhas said that you've got to have the vicious will in\norder to constitute a crime. And so you have the same\nissue here. Did Mrs. Dixon have the vicious will or\nwas she acting under the will of someone else?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, but doesn't vicious\nwill mean simply the will to commit the crime?\nMR. JETT: Actually, no. It means the -- the\ncriminal intent, not just to commit the crime but\nhaving the criminal intent, the vicious mind, to\nviolate the law. Mrs. Dixon's --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, what do you mean by\nvicious? I mean, that the person is -- is nasty, that\nthe person is antisocial or asocial?\nMR. JETT: No.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I don't know what the added\nelement is.\nMR. JETT: The -- this -- this Court has --\nhas frequently equated the vicious will with moral\nblameworthiness, that is, the desire to do wrong, that\nis, the desire to do something -- to -- the free desire\nbased on the -- the choice of having -- being able to\ndo the right thing or do the wrong thing and freely\nchoosing to do the wrong thing, that is, moral\nblameworthiness.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The phrase Justice Harlan\nused in the Davis case.\nMR. JETT: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But when you -- when you say\nfreely choosing, what you mean, I take it, is choosing\nwith -- without consideration of pressure from a third\nparty. That's what you mean, isn't it?\nMR. JETT: That's correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. JETT: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But if the -- the third --\nthe third party may, indeed, exert pressure, but I take\nit you would agree that it is still the decision of the\ndefendant whether to cave in to that pressure or not,\nwhether to commit the crime or not to commit the crime.\nMR. JETT: We believe that would not be a\nvoluntary act. Certainly the defendant makes that\ndecision.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I -- I don't want to\nget lost in -- in rhetoric here. Isn't it still the\ncase, even on your theory, that the defendant in these\ncircumstances makes a choice? It may be a troubled\nchoice, a much more difficult choice to make than it\nwould be otherwise, but the defendant still makes a\nchoice as to whether to cave in to the third party's\npressure or not, whether to commit the crime or not.\nIsn't that true even on your theory?\nMR. JETT: Yes, it is true.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. JETT: But the difference is, as you\npointed out, Justice Souter, that the defendant is not\nacting of her own free will. She's -- she's acting\nbased on the will of someone else, that that person has\noverborne her will.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It was her will to yield to\nthe will of someone else. I mean, you can't blame\nsomebody else for her making the choice.\nMR. JETT: Well, we -- we would respectfully\ndisagree, Judge. She believed that there was\nfiguratively a gun at the head of her children, and if\nsomebody puts a gun to the head of my child, you can\nmake me do almost anything that you want.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That may be a very\nintelligent choice on your part to do what the person\nwith the gun at the head of your children tells you to\ndo. But to say that it's not your choice, which is\nwhat you're arguing here, the only question is whether\nthat has to be brought forward by reason of -- of a\ndefense of -- of coercion or rather, whether it goes to\nwhether you had the intent. That's all we're talking\nabout here. And it seems to me you have the intent to\nyield to -- to the demand of whoever has the gun at the\nhead of your children. It's a separate question\nwhether the law should punish your yielding like that.\nMR. JETT: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but you're telling us\nthat you don't have the intent to -- to yield and --\nand to do whatever criminal act that person tells you.\nRight? That just doesn't -- I just don't think it's\ntrue.\nMR. JETT: What -- what we're saying and what\nI think that this Court -- the precedents of this Court\nhave said is that you have to have criminal intent.\nThat is the vicious will that -- that the Court --\nJustice Harlan talked about in Davis and this Court has\ntalked about in Morissette.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, what is the statutory\n-- what is the mens rea under the statute for the\noffenses that the defendant was charged with? It's\nknowingly, isn't it?\nMR. JETT: Well, on -- on seven or eight of\nthe counts, it's knowingly. Well, actually on the\nfirst count it's knowingly, but that is defined as --\nas -- in this case, it was defined as voluntarily and\nintentionally. And then in the other counts, it was\nsimply defined as knowingly. And so, indeed, that --\nthat's -- that is what the Congress said.\nHowever, based on the -- the precedents of\nthis Court, that even when there is a knowingly\nculpable mental state provided by Congress, this Court\nhas impart -- imported the -- the criminal intent to --\ninto the statute. And so like in -- for instance, in\nMorissette, which was a theft case, what this Court did\nwas the Congress had said knowingly didn't provide a --\na criminal intent. So this Court imported one and said\nthat the Court -- that the Government had to prove that\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. Once the defense was\nraised, it became an element that the Government has to\nprove beyond a reasonable doubt.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, counsel, under\nyour view, how -- how is the Government supposed to\nprove a negative in every case? How are they supposed\nto prove the absence of duress?\nMR. JETT: It's really no different than any\nother case, Mr. Chief Justice. In -- in any case, for\ninstance, a self-defense case, the Government has got\nto prove that -- disprove self-defense beyond a\nreasonable doubt once it's raised. They do it in the\nsame way they do in the other case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's something\nthat -- but self-defense is something that's often a --\na factual element that you can discern from the\ncircumstances of the crime. The -- the other guy had a\ngun, you know, that sort of thing. So if it's going to\nbe presented -- so it's something that's within the\ncontrol of either side.\nDuress is something that in this case the\nGovernment would have no reason to suppose that it was\neven implicated until it's raised, and then they have\nno way of getting at what the particulars are because\nthey're all within the control of the defendant.\nMR. JETT: Well, we -- we would respectfully\ndisagree with that. And this case is a very good\nexample of -- of that -- of that circumstance. The\nGovernment -- early on in this case, they searched Mrs.\nDixon's apartment and found evidence. They -- they\ninterviewed her. They actually interviewed the abusers\nprior to trial before we gave them notice. They --\nthey were able to investigate her background partially\nbefore we gave notice, partially afterwards, so that\nthey were able to -- to investigate her and\ncircumstances of her life. But not only that, they\nwere able to call as witnesses the seven gun dealers\nfrom which the guns were purchased who witnessed the\npurchase and who did provide testimony that she did not\nappear to be under duress, and they so testified.\nSo in this particular case, it's really just\nlike any other cases. You can certainly imagine a\ncircumstance where that would be hard, but in very many\ncases, the facts are there just like a self-defense\ncase or, for that matter, just like --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I thought the\ngist of her duress defense was not that she was under\nduress when she was purchasing the guns, but that she\nhad reason to believe that her children were being\nthreatened by accomplices or associates of -- of this\n-- this individual. And there's nothing in the facts\nof the -- the scene that would lead the Government to\nhave any access to that evidence.\nMR. JETT: Well, what -- what she was in\nduress about is she was told at the time that there was\nsomebody at home with a gun who was just a cell phone\ncall away. So as far as she was concerned, there was\nsomebody there with a gun to the head of her children\nand she was in fear of her children's life.\nIn terms of what -- what the Government knew\nin this particular case, the Government had notice.\nThe trial judge required that we provide notice of a\ndefense. The trial judge required that if we -- said\nthat if we had an expert, we had to give the Government\nnotice of the expert and the subject matter of the\ntestimony of the expert. So the Government was very\nwell informed prior to trial what the defense was so\nthat they hired their own expert who actually was able\nto interview the -- the accused without me being there\nand -- and so was prepared to testify about the issues\nof duress.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what is the\nthreshold test that the defendant has to cross before\nthe judge will give the instruction to the jury?\nObviously, the burden of production is with the\ndefendant. When can a judge say, well, you know, this\n-- this is just too flimsy for a duress defense? I'm\nnot going to instruct a jury on that.\nMR. JETT: Well, the -- the first thing the\njudge would have to determine is that has -- has there\nbeen evidence of each of the elements of duress, and\nthe trial judge found that we -- we've produced evidence\nof each of the elements of the duress.\nThe -- in -- in the circuit court cases,\nthey've not been consistent, but we would -- we would\nsuggest that the -- the standard would be that there\nwould be sufficient evidence, when viewed in the light\nmost favorable to the defendant, that would raise a\nreasonable doubt with a rationale jury, sort of the --\nthe other side of -- of the prosecution's burden that\nthey have to reach in order to get to the jury.\nJUSTICE ALITO: What is the -- the\nmethodology that you think we should follow in\ndetermining where the burden should be allocated under\nany particular criminal statute? Is it the -- the\nmajority rule at the time when that particular statute\nwas enacted or at -- is it -- you don't think it's the\n-- the old common law rule. What -- what is the -- at\nwhat point of time do we look at the -- at what's going\non throughout our country?\nMR. JETT: Well, I think you've got to look\nat two points in time. And certainly we agree. We\ndon't look at the old common law because -- because\nthere's been 110 years of -- of development of common\nlaw in this country since Davis v. United States. So I\nthink the Court has got to look at -- at what the\ncommon law was at the time that the relevant statute\nwas passed, which in this case was 1968.\nBut I think in addition to that, there --\nthere have been amendments to the statute.\nJUSTICE ALITO: So the burden would be\ndifferent under different statutes?\nMR. JETT: Well --\nJUSTICE ALITO: If we were dealing with a --\nwith a much older criminal statute, the burden might be\nallocated differently?\nMR. JETT: No, because I think the -- I think\nyou have to consider that. But the other thing you'd\nhave to consider is the development of the common law\nsince that time and what -- what courts have done, what\nthe rationale has been that they have employed over\ntime.\nAnd in this particular case, for instance, we\nhave -- we have six Federal circuits and 29 States who\nhave found that the burden of proof -- the burden of\nproduction should be on the defendant, but the burden\nof persuasion should be on -- on the Government to\ndisprove duress once it's raised.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you have 21 States and\nhow many circuits --\nMR. JETT: Six circuits and 29 States,\nJustice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No. I'm saying how many are\non the other side?\nMR. JETT: On the other side of the circuits,\nwe count three; on the States, we count 14. Some\nStates have not addressed the issue.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's -- that's sort\nof a horse race. I'm -- I'm not sure, even if I agreed\nwith your theory, that -- that what the Constitution\nrequires changes on the basis of an evolving common\nlaw.\nOf course, it can only change in one\ndirection. Right? It can only change favorably to --\nto your client, favorably to the defendant. It can't\nchange to be more harsh to the defendant because the\nConstitution prohibits that.\nMR. JETT: We would agree --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right? So -- so we have a\none-way -- a one-way altering Constitution.\nMR. JETT: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But even -- even if I agreed\nwith that, I'm not sure that, you know, 21 versus 14 is\n-- is an overwhelming demonstration of -- of the new\ncommon law.\nMR. JETT: But, Justice Scalia, it's 29\nversus 14. And -- but it's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: 29 versus 14.\nMR. JETT: But it's clearly a 2 to 1 majority\nin favor of placing the burden of persuasion on the\nGovernment.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But are you making\nthe argument that this number indicates a congressional\nintent and that what we ought to do is come up with a\nrule because Congress intended it? Or are you making\nthe argument that yours is the better rule, and as a\nmatter of common law, which -- which it is our\nresponsibility to develop, we should see it your way?\nWhich argument are you making?\nMR. JETT: We're -- we're basing our argument\nprimarily on -- on the common law that has been\ndeveloped in -- in this country since really Davis v.\nUnited States through the present and has -- has --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Jett, there's one\npiece of this picture that's different -- that\ndistinguishes duress from, say, self-defense. If it's\nself-defense, you take a snapshot on the scene. You\nknow exactly what happened. No one taking a picture of\nthese gun purchases would have any idea of all of this.\nAnd the judge, when asked to give -- to allow\nthe defense of duress, said, it's frankly a close call\nin my mind, but when it is a close call, better give it\nthan not.\nNow, he thought that the defendant would have\nthe burden of proof. Perhaps the judge would call that\nclose question the other way if he thought he was\nsaddling the prosecution with the ultimate burden of\npersuasion.\nMR. JETT: In my mind it would be -- if it's\na close question, I don't think the burden of proof in\nthat particular circumstance would make a difference\nbecause it still is -- because he would then be taking\nit away from the jury. And in my experience, judges\nare -- are not want to take the questions away from the\njury, and they will provide the -- the jury instruction\nin a close case. And that would be the right thing to\ndo because ultimately we want the jury to make that\ndecision.\nBut the -- but the judge does have a\ngatekeeping function in -- in a duress defense, so that\na judge -- in any circumstance, if the judge decided\nthat the evidence was insufficient to get to the jury,\nthe judge can make that determination so that you have\nthe trial court acting with the -- the -- to make sure\nthat what the jury is going to hear is -- is an issue\nfor which there is evidence. So I think that the\ngatekeeping function that the trial court would --\nwould prevent there from being -- juries making a\ndecision on insufficient facts.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Jett, a thought occurred\nto me, by reason of your agreement, that -- that it's a\none-way ratchet, that when the common law changes in\nthe -- in the direction of favoring the defendant, it\nbecomes the duty of the courts to allow that. But, of\ncourse, it can't change in the other direction because\nthe Constitution would prevent it. You sort of agreed\nwith that.\nBut -- but if -- if you agree with that, how\ncan you explain our -- our 1895 decision in Davis which\nheld that the insanity defense had to be proved by the\nGovernment which was then overridden by a Federal\nstatute. How could -- how could -- if -- if Davis was\nright about what the -- what the common law required,\nhow could Congress possibly have changed that by a\nstatute? I would assume that all of the basic elements\nof the common law are picked up in the Due Process\nClause. Why wouldn't -- why wouldn't the necessity of\n-- of proving the mental element of a -- of a crime,\neven when that mental element is overcome by insanity,\nwhy wouldn't that have been embodied in the Due Process\nClause so that the congressional statute would have\nbeen ineffective?\nMR. JETT: Well, two reasons. One, Davis was\na common law case, and -- and subsequently in Leland v.\nOregon, this Court said Davis was a common law case.\nAnd so this Court can decide the common law issue with\nrespect to the Constitution.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No. I'm not questioning\nwhether we could do it. I'm questioning whether\nCongress could do it, whether Congress could overrule\nwhat we did in Davis. If Davis said that common law\nwas that the Government has to prove -- disprove\ninsanity, wouldn't that have been part -- become part\nof the Due Process Clause if it was the common law?\nMR. JETT: I think -- I think that if it --\nif it does become part of the Due Process, then\nobviously Congress cannot overrule it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. JETT: If it simply becomes the common\nlaw -- the rule of -- of the Federal courts that this\nCourt has -- has established based on its supervisory\npowers, then the Congress would be able to do that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it makes me suspect\nthat Davis was wrong.\nMR. JETT: Well, the thing about Davis that\neven though the -- the insanity holding about Davis was\noverruled, the core holdings of Davis was not\noverruled. And one of the things that Davis said was\nthat, again, to constitute a crime against human laws,\nthere must be the vicious will and, secondly, the\nunlawful act.\nThe other thing that Davis said, which was\nvery significant, is that the plea of not guilty is not\nlike in a civil case where there's confession and\navoidance. What it does is it negates or it\ncontroverts all of the allegations of -- of the State,\nand so that it controverts the existence of each fact\nthat the State has to prove. If it -- if it, indeed,\ndoes that and what duress does is it negates the evil\n-- the evil intent, then -- then the Government has got\nto prove that there's criminal intent. It's got to\nnegate one of the elements that the Government has got\nto prove beyond a reasonable doubt. And that's -- that\n-- that's part of the holding of Davis, and the\nCongress has not affected that with its decision on the\ninsanity defense.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask, if -- if you\nknow, whether Congress has ever been asked to address\nthis precise issue that we're debating today?\nMR. JETT: Congress has -- has never ruled on\nthe duress defense. I think a few years ago, there --\nthere was a proposal to -- to amend the Federal\nCriminal Code, and in that particular -- it didn't pass\nbut I think the result of that was that Congress just\ntook out the duress provision and said that the courts\nshould make the decision as to how that would be\nhandled based on -- on all the -- the normal\nconsiderations that a court looks at in making those\ndecisions.\nSo that the Congress has had many\nopportunities to rule on duress. The Congress -- just\nlike the Congress has said you have to have notice of\nalibi and just like they passed the -- this -- the rule\nabout -- I mean, the statute about insanity. The\nCongress could have -- have abolished the duress\ndefense. I don't think they could have\nconstitutionally, but they could have passed a statute\nand spoken to that, but they've chosen not to. And I\nthink what that tells us is that the Congress is\nprobably aware of the common law and have chosen not to\ninterfere with the development of the common law in\nthis country.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about a defense\nthat I was on drugs and -- and didn't know what I was\ndoing because of that and couldn't form the requisite\nintent? Does the Government have to disprove that as\nwell?\nMR. JETT: If that is a defense that is\nrecognized by -- by the common law or -- or by statute,\nthen the Government would have to do that if that\nparticular defense --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How is the Government\n-- how would the Government do that?\nMR. JETT: Well --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: A person just says, I\nwas -- I was on, you know, PCP or whatever and -- and I\ncouldn't form the requisite intent.\nMR. JETT: Well, the Government could do that\nmuch the way they do like in an entrapment defense. In\nan entrapment defense, the Government has to -- once\nthere's entrapment shown, the Government has to\ndisprove the predisposition of the defendant or prove\nthe defendant has predisposition. And so --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's based on the\ndefendant's -- the prosecution's conduct. The\nGovernment's conduct in entrapment concerns how the\nGovernment behaved.\nMR. JETT: Justice Ginsburg, it does but it\nstill -- that case still deals with somebody overriding\nthe will of the defendant, the Government imposing its\nown will on the defendant. In that regard --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But if the Government is\nout there trying to achieve that result, it's quite\ndifferent from the Government having nothing to do --\nMR. JETT: Well, we -- we contend that it's\nstill the same because it's a third party, whether it's\nthe Government or somebody else, who's overbearing the\nwill of the accused.\nAnd if there's no other questions, I'd like\nto reserve the balance of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Gornstein.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVING L. GORNSTEIN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nFor three reasons, the burden of proving\nduress should be on the defendant, and the Government\nshould not be required to disprove duress beyond a\nreasonable doubt.\nFirst, duress is an affirmative defense that\nexcuses what would otherwise be serious criminal\nconduct. When the Government proves that a defendant\nhas engaged in criminal conduct and has done so with\nthe mens rea specified by the crime, it is fair to\nrequire the defendant to prove that duress excuses that\ncriminal conduct, so that here, the Government proved\nthat Petitioner knew she was lying when she filled out\nthe forms and that she knew it was unlawful for her to\nreceive firearms.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So there may be cases\nwhere the nature of the mens rea required would require\nthe Government to disprove duress.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: There could conceivably be\nsuch cases, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The sort of crimes\nwhere -- where your culpability depends on your motive.\nRight?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Well, if you had a crime, for\nexample, that said someone who does something while not\nunder -- acting under duress, that would be an obvious\nexample. But there are --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It would be an easy\nexample.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: It would be an easy example.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GORNSTEIN: But there -- there are --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Good catch.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about a -- you\nknow, a hate crime, a bias crime, you know, an act of\nviolence done with a particular motive or intent? And\nthe -- and the suggestion is I didn't do this because\nof a particular motive. I did this because they had a\ngun to the head of my children.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Right. In -- in that kind of\nsituation, the facts that go to duress could also go to\nundermining the proof of the motive in that case, and\nin that situation, the Government always has to prove\nthe element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.\nBut if the defendant wants to add to that a duress -- a\nspecific duress defense, then the burden of proof would\nbe on the defendant to prove duress. Now, normally in\nthat --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The Government wouldn't --\nwouldn't have to disprove duress in the hate case. It\nwould just have to prove hate.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And to the extent that\nduress undermines that, it would be a defense\nconsidered by the jury on the hate question.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: That's correct, Justice\nScalia.\nNow, the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: How does self-defense fit\ninto this equation?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: The Government's position is\nthat on self-defense, the burden of proof is on the\ndefendant, but it recognizes that there are important\ndistinctions between self-defense and duress that could\nallow the court to reach different conclusions about\nthe two defenses.\nIn addition to the point that's already been\nmade about the degree of factual overlap between self-\ndefense on the one hand and duress on the other on the\nbasic crime, there are three additional considerations.\nOne is that the -- the circuits and the\nStates are virtually uniform on self-defense, whereas\nthere is a significant division of authority on the\nquestion of duress.\nSecond, self-defense has always been a more\nfavored defense because when the defendant acts\nlegitimately in self-defense, he's not harming an\ninnocent person. But when a defendant is actually\nunder -- acting under duress, that defendant is still\nendangering or harming innocent third parties.\nAnd the third reason is that there's always\nbeen a significant degree of judicial skepticism about\nclaims of duress, but there's never been that same kind\nof judicial skepticism about self-defense.\nSo while we do take the position that the\nburden of proof is still on the defendant, the Court\ncould take a different view on that issue and agree\nwith us on duress.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Why is the number of\ndecisions -- number of States that have gone one way or --\nor the other on the issue relevant? If it's not an Eighth\nAmendment question --\nMR. GORNSTEIN: No. I -- I think it's just a\nFederal common law question here, and it's only as good\nas the reasoning that underlies it. But when you start\nto see a uniform body or a consensus of opinion on one\nside of the equation, then there -- it's much more\nlikely that there are certain reasons that are\nunderlying that justify it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what if you're a\njudge like me who -- who thinks that any significant\nelement of -- of the criminal law, when the Due Process\nClause was -- was adopted, remains in effect and it\ndoesn't change with the times as you seem -- as your\nlast comment seems to have said? What do I do with a\ncase like Davis? Not a case like. What do I do with\nDavis? Davis tells me that this was the common law\nwhen the Due Process Clause was adopted.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: No, I don't think Davis was\ntaking the position --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: -- that this was the common\nlaw when the Due Process Clause was adopted. Davis\ntook the position that the common law had evolved to\nthe point where on the specific defense of insanity,\nthat this was the result that should follow, that there\nshould be a burden of production on the defendant, and\nthen the Government should have to disprove insanity\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. But Davis was not a\nconstitutional holding.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, I know it was not a\nconstitutional holding, but --\nMR. GORNSTEIN: And it wasn't a holding about\nwhat --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'll have to go back and\nlook at it.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: -- the early common law was\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: -- because it's clear that\nunder -- at the time of the Constitution, the burden of\nproof on all of these defenses was on the defendant.\nAnd that was also true at the time the Fourteenth\nAmendment was adopted. The burden of proof was on the\ndefendant. There was some evolution after that.\nNow, the -- the other thing I wanted to talk\nabout with respect to Davis is it was based on the\nunderstanding that the Court had about the relationship\nbetween the insanity defense on the one hand and the\nmens rea element of the crime on the other hand. And\nhere, there's simply no corresponding overlap. Whether\nor not the Petitioner acted under duress, she knew she\nwas lying when she filled out the forms, and she knew\nit was unlawful for her to purchase firearms. So\nthere's simply no relationship between the duress\ndefense and the mens rea element of these crimes.\nCongress has also overruled Davis by statute,\nand we don't think it would be appropriate for the\nCourt to extend Davis to a new defense when Congress\nhas rejected it with respect to the only defense that\nit applied to. And -- and there's -- and certainly\nCongress acted constitutionally in overruling the Davis\ndecision under this Court's decision in Leland and in\nother cases like Martin and Patterson, which say that\nthere is no constitutional problem in putting the\nburden of proof on the defendant for established common\nlaw affirmative defenses. And --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is -- is -- I didn't mean to\ncut you off.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: No.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I was -- you have a tougher\nargument, don't you, when you -- when you face the\ncomparison between duress here and entrapment because\nit's -- it's quite true in -- in entrapment you're\ntalking about the actions of a -- of a third party\nwhich is causing something, but the -- the ultimate\ndetermination that has to be made is a determination\nabout the -- in effect, the -- the inclination, the\nwillingness, the readiness of the defendant to have\ncommitted the act. And -- and yet, I take it, it's --\nit's assumed that so far as the entrapment defense is\nconcerned, the burden is on the Government. So if the\nburden is on the Government in what is a -- a somewhat\ndifficult issue for the Government to carry the burden\non in entrapment, wouldn't coherence suggest that a\nfortiori it ought to be on -- on duress?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: No, and here's the reason.\nThe -- the burden of proof on entrapment is actually on\nthe defendant initially.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, the burden of going\nforward with evidence.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: No. The burden of proof on\nthe element of inducement. That is, there are two\nelements.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You mean the burden of\npersuasion.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Burden of persuasion on the\nelement of inducement is on the defendant. The\ndefendant has to prove more likely than not that the\nGovernment induced this crime in the sense that it took\nactions that are likely to override what a innocent\nperson would have done. At that point, the burden\nshifts to the Government to show that this particular\ndefendant was predisposed.\nNow, that's consistent with background common\nlaw principles under which, once it's shown that one\nparty has been engaging in wrongful conduct, i.e.,\ninducement, then the burden shifts to the wrongdoer to\nshow that its conduct did not have its likely effect in\nthat case. And that's why the Government then has to\ncome back and show that with respect to this particular\nindividual, that particular individual was predisposed,\neven though we took wrongful actions that would have\ninduced an innocent person to do this.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You could almost argue that\nthe other way. I mean, it -- it seems to me on\npredisposition that the defendant knows more about it\nthan the Government does.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: That -- that's true, but\nagain, if it was just a matter of who has access to the\nrelevant evidence, then that would -- the burden should\nhave been on the defendant, that it wasn't just a\nmatter of that. There was this other principle which\nis that the -- there was already a showing -- there's\nalready a showing that the Government has taken\nwrongful action to induce the crime. And that's why\nthe burden shifts to the defendant -- to the Government\nto show that this particular person wasn't predisposed.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm not sure what the\ncriteria are that I have to follow -- that we have to\nfollow in deciding the case. Just count up all the\ncases and --\nMR. GORNSTEIN: No, I don't think that the\nCourt --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Let me ask -- let me ask\nyou this. Is -- is there any evidence that -- that we\ncan take account of, commentary, law reviews, to show\nthat the Government has difficulties in -- in meeting a\nduress defense?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: It -- there is nothing that I\ncan point you to that shows there is an empirically\nevidence that the Government is not going to be able to\ndeal with this burden.\nBut what I would say to you is that you\nshould take the same approach that the Court took in\nThe Diana case many years ago, which is it did not want\nto establish a regime that invites manufactured claims.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, why is this worse in\nthat respect? And lots of things in the case that you\nhave to prove may be hard to prove because it requires\nfinding out what someone said to the defendant over the\ntelephone, what happened 4 years ago in a room where\nthe defendant was the only one now alive present.\nThere are lots of cases like that.\nTraditionally in the law, I take it, it's\nbeen that most instances where the defendant excuses\nhis conduct on the ground he wasn't morally culpable,\nmistake, accident, self-defense. Entrapment? Not --\nthat's a different kind of ground. This one? Evidence\nmixed.\nBut you have to prove lots of things where\nit's really in the hands of the defendant, and the\ndefendant saying I'm so innocent because I'm not\nmorally culpable. I was asleep. I was -- you know, we\ncan imagine. So I don't see why this is different.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Justice Breyer --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And that's going back to\nJustice Kennedy's question. I would look -- I guess if\nwe're supposed to get the better rule, the first place\nI'd look is what did the Model Penal Code think. They\nthink you should have the burden.\nThen I think has this turned into a practical\nproblem in the 29 States that have had it for 20 to 40\nyears. And you say we don't have any evidence to that\neffect.\nNow, I've listed about four things here that\nI'd like your response to.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Let -- let me start with -- I\ngo back to The Diana case because I think the way the\nCourt approached the question in The Diana case is the\nway this Court should approach it because it dealt with\nthe same kind of defense, necessity. And what it\nwanted -- it said this is a defense where there is a\nthere is a big danger that this can be manufactured in\na way that it is difficult to disprove, and we are\ngoing to establish a regime that doesn't invite\nmanufactured claims and that doesn't make it difficult\nfor the Government to disprove something beyond a\nreasonable doubt. We have a choice here, and that's\nnot the regime we want to establish. We want to\nestablish a regime that makes it more unlikely that\nmanufactured claims are going to come forward and that\nmake it -- makes it more unlikely that if such claims\ndo come forward, the Government isn't going to be able\n-- unable to disprove them beyond a reasonable doubt,\ncompromising the entire statutory scheme.\nJUSTICE BREYER: But if we're thinking of\nthings logically, logically you're right. I can see\nthat this is in the hands of the defendant. But I've\nwondered why hasn't this turned into evidence of a\nproblem in the 29 States. And the following occurred\nto me, which I'll put to you to see what your reaction\nis.\nThe defense has to do something if they are\ngoing to put duress in issue. They have to get the\ndefendant to testify. So the prosecutor has something\nthat the prosecutor doesn't ordinarily get. He has\nthat defendant right on the stand, ready for jury\nevaluation. And that is something a -- a prosecutor\nmay want, and it's something the defense lawyer may not\nwant. He has to choose.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: But --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So when you get into the\npracticalities of it, I see things both ways, and I'd\nlike to find some evidence of what's actually happened.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Well, take a recent case in\nwhich a defendant transported drugs from Mexico into\nthe United States, and he claimed that he did that\nbecause someone threatened his family members in\nMexico. Now, that's a case that somebody who has\ndeliberately violated the law would find relatively\neasy to manufacture that defense. Yet, it would be\nvery difficult for the Government to disprove that\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\nYes, but if the burden of proof is on the\ndefendant, then the Government can do what you were\ntalking about. It can cross-examine that person and it\ncan persuade the jury --\nJUSTICE BREYER: If -- if does that --\nMR. GORNSTEIN: If he does that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: He has a few other things,\nthe prosecutor. He has that defendant on the stand.\nThere was an implication that you were in Chicago at\nthe time.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: If --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Where you on the night of\nsuch and such?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: There are -- there are other\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: And that's an advantage for\nthe prosecutor.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: That's true, Justice Breyer,\nbut what I'm saying is, that it's one thing to be able\nto persuade the jury through cross-examination, that\nthat is more -- not more likely than not. It's quite\nanother thing to persuade the jury in that kind of\nsituation that that defense is not true beyond a\nreasonable doubt.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, in the vast\nmajority of criminal cases, there's no doubt that the\nperson did the crime. And so the -- the benefit to the\nGovernment is just carrying coals to Newcastle. The --\nthe defendant would plead guilty but for the fact that\nhe has a plausible coercion defense, and so he puts\nthat coercion defense before the jury, and oh, sure, he\ndoes let the -- the Government cross-examine him. But\nthe Government really doesn't need his cross-\nexamination in the ordinary case. Isn't that right?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: In the ordinary case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And I -- I guess the only\nway we could really tell what the consequences are, as\nJustice Breyer would -- would like us to be able to\ntell, is to know how many people who have gotten off on\nthe basis of this defense have gone on to continue a\nlife of crime. And -- and we don't have any stats on\nthat --\nMR. GORNSTEIN: We do not have any\nstatistics. And, of course, when -- when somebody gets\noff, it results in -- in an acquittal and so we don't\nget published decisions about that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: We never know the\nconsequences of our decisions, by and large, do we?\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's why this is\nproblematic.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: I'm not sure I'll answer\nthat.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I mean, I don't have the\nexperience as a criminal lawyer that allows me to say\nwhether it would be one way or the other. You're\nsaying -- and I'll repeat that. Is there anything at\nall I could look to try to figure this out? Because I\nthink it is a question we're supposed to get the better\nrule.\nWhat did the Model Penal Code authors do?\nDid they take testimony --\nMR. GORNSTEIN: The -- the Model Penal Code\ntakes the position that every defense, affirmative\ndefense, goes on the Government, and that's just a\npolicy judgment --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Did they have evidence or\ndid they have -- take testimony? Did they go around\ntrying to find out how prosecutors and defense\nattorneys -- you know. I don't know.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Justice Breyer, I do not\nknow. I do know it is based in -- in its explanation\nof its rule for all affirmative defenses, which would\ninclude insanity, which Congress has rejected --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Doesn't that come from an\nunderlying principle that your position is not entirely\nconsistent with, that is, that the defendant is\npresumed innocent? So it's not as Justice Scalia may\nhave suggested that, well, he would plead guilty, but\nwe're going to let him -- we presume that the defendant\nis innocent. That's why the prosecutor has to have the\nburden on all issues. I thought that was the\nunderlying principle.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: The -- the burden of -- the\npresumption of innocence, though, only applies to the\nessential elements of the crime under this Court's\ndecision in In re Winship, et cetera, and not -- it\ndoesn't apply to affirmative defenses, as the Court has\nconsistently held in Martin and in Patterson and in\nLeland. That is, the -- it can be constitutionally --\nyou can put the burden of proof on the defendant to\nprove an affirmative defense, and the Constitution has\nnothing to say about that. The presumption of\ninnocence goes to all the things -- the essential\nelements of the crime.\nAnd here, Petitioner benefited from the\npresumption of innocence. The Government had to prove\nthat she filled out those forms, that she filled them\nout with falsities, and that she knew she was lying\nwhen she filled out that -- those forms. It had to\nprove that she received those guns and that she knew\nthat it was unlawful for her to receive those guns.\nAnd it had to prove all of those things beyond a\nreasonable doubt.\nNow, on the position of the States, a\nsignificant number of States are on --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Before you get there,\nwhat -- roughly speaking, how much of the Model Penal\nCode has Congress enacted into the criminal --\nMR. GORNSTEIN: I don't think the Congress\nhas enacted the -- the Model Penal Code. This -- this\nCourt sometimes looks to the Model Penal Code as one\nsource of what is -- of -- of thought out there, but\nthat's all.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Who -- who develops the\nModel Penal Code? Is that the American Law Institute\nthat does that?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Yes. Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Which once upon a time\npurported to simply be embodying the -- the general\nlaw, the common law. But it doesn't even purport to do\nthat anymore.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: No. It doesn't -- it doesn't\npurport it. And in fact, in this particular case --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There are a lot of law\nprofessors involved in it, aren't there?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Well, I'm sure.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GORNSTEIN: In this particular case the\nModel --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Some judges too.\nRight?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: -- the Model Penal Code said\nthat it was expanding the common law defense of duress\nto a new place where it had never been. So it's not\nsurprising that it would also have a different burden\nof persuasion than the traditional burden of\npersuasion.\nNow, on -- on the practice of the States, the\nCourt has never taken the view that it is just going to\ndo a nose count and figure out what the best rule is\nbased on the practice of the States.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When was this -- the\nunderlying statute at issue here enacted?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: I'm not remembering the --\nthe exact -- I think it's in the '70's, though.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, would we -- would\nour -- would our nose count be today or would our nose\ncount be when the criminal statute was --\nMR. GORNSTEIN: No. Mr. Chief Justice, we\ndon't think that the Court should do that kind of nose\ncounting based on whether a statute was enacted in\n1800, 1850, 1900, 1950 and potentially have different\nrules for each statute. We think that the Court should\nlook at the entire --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, why not? Isn't it\nrealistic to assume that Congress looked at the state\nof the law at the time it's passing a statute and\npresumably adopted what was the prevailing view?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: I don't think it's right to\nsay that it adopted the prevailing view unless it was a\nconsensus view. I don't think, though --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, a consensus view. It\nwould still be the time of the enactment of the statute\nis what would be relevant, I would think.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: But I think the -- I think\nthat the problem with that approach is to have a\ncompletely different rule for all the different\nstatutes based on when they were enacted is\nunmanageable and impractical. And the Court has said\nthe same thing in the context of mens rea requirements.\nThe Court doesn't import into statutes the\nmens rea requirement that was in vogue at a particular\ntime. What it does now is it imports into all criminal\nstatutes that do not specify a mens rea requirement --\nit simply imports in a knowledge requirement, that\nthere has to be knowing action. And that would be true\nregardless of whether it's an 1800 statute, an 1850\nstatute, a 1900 statute, or a today statute. And I\nthink that the reason for that is one of practicality\nand administrability which the Court has talked about,\nin fact, in -- in other cases. The Bailey case.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Gornstein, just out of\ncuriosity, of the 29 States that have the different\nrule, in how many of those States was the different\nrule adopted legislatively and in how many States was\nit pronounced by the State supreme court?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: I -- I'm not sure of the\nexact breakdown, but I think that there are -- there\nare possibly something like 10 or so States on -- that\nhave adopted it by statute, but I'm not sure of the\nexact number of that -- on that.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is -- is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe your -- your friend on\nthe other side knows.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is the test proposed by the\nPetitioner that -- that you have to prove non-duress by\nbeyond a reasonable doubt?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Yes, after the defendant --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And your test is that the\ndefendant would have to prove it only by clear and\nconvincing evidence?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: No. More likely than not,\nthe preponderance of the evidence standard.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: More likely. More likely.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: More likely than not. And\nthat -- the -- the Court in The Diana case, actually in\nthe context of forfeiture, thought that a beyond -- the\ndefendant should have to show it beyond a reasonable\ndoubt.\nBut we -- and we -- we would take a step back\nfrom that, consistent the practice in the circuits that\nhave put the burden of proof on the defendant and the\nStates that put the burden of proof on the defendant\nand the burden of proof that -- that Congress has\nspecified when it has thought about what the burden of\nproof should be outside the context of insanity --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you think a State could\nput a burden on the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt\nfor entrapment, duress, insanity?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: For all of the affirmative\ndefenses, I think that's the -- the Leland decision\nwould allow a State to do that. Leland said that you\ncould put -- require the defendant to show beyond a\nreasonable -- I'm sorry. Is it Leland?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Clear and convincing.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Yes. Beyond a reasonable\ndoubt and so that there is -- there would be no\nconstitutional problem in putting a -- a burden beyond\na reasonable doubt on the duress defense either.\nAnd in fact, this is a defense that Congress\ncould -- could eliminate altogether, if it wanted to,\nand just take the position that it's going to -- these\n-- this kind of excuse would be considered along with\nall other kinds of excuses in either making a charging\ndecision or -- or making a sentencing decision. There\nis no constitutional imperative that there be a duress\ndefense at all.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the insanity\ndefense?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: The same is true of the --\nthe insanity defense that the Congress could take the\nposition. It hasn't taken that position, but it could\ntake the position, that this is a defense that will be\nconsidered, along with other excuses, in -- by\nprosecutors as they make charging decisions and by\nsentencing judges as they make sentencing judgments.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about self-defense?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: The -- the same would be true\nof self-defense, again, that the -- the Government --\nno State has ever taken that position and the Congress\nhasn't taken that position, and it would be very much\nagainst all the traditions that are -- that we have.\nBut if a State made a policy judgment to that effect,\nthat this is the policy -- we want to encourage people\nto retreat, we do not want to encourage people to take\nthe law into their own hands, but what we will do is we\nwill recognize this and we are sure our prosecutors are\ngoing to recognize it, we're sure our judges are going to\nrecognize it as a -- a mitigating factor. And that\nwould be constitutional.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Gornstein, there are\nsome old cases that draw a distinction between\njustifications and excuses. And you carefully use the\nwords excuse to describe that defense. Did you do so\nhaving in mind that distinction or just as a\nloose description of the -- of the defense?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: I think that it -- it fits\nthe defense and that you can draw a distinction between\nexcuse and justification, but I don't think the\ndistinction ultimately matters whether you call it an\nexcuse or justification. It's still the burden of\nproof should be on the defendant and it shouldn't --\nthe nomenclature shouldn't matter.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What about mistake?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Mistake is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I thought it was a deer.\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Yes. Mistake is something\nthat negatives the mens rea requirement of knowledge.\nSo, of course, the Government has to prove knowledge\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, and if somebody has mistake,\nthen the Government isn't going to be able to satisfy\nits burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And would you distinguish\nbetween instances of duress where it may a negative\nmens rea and instances where it may not?\nMR. GORNSTEIN: Well, if it does negative\nmens rea -- and this is infrequent, but if it does,\nthen the Government, of course, has to prove its\nelement of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. And\nif duress evidence undermines the Government's ability\nto do that, then the Government hasn't proven its case\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\nIf the Court has no further questions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nGornstein.\nMr. Jett, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF J. CRAIG JETT\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. JETT: To answer Justice Scalia's\nquestion, a quick count, it looked like that there were\nperhaps three that we could count, but it was a quick\ncount. We can't tell whether all those decisions were\nbased on State statutes or not. The gun control\nstatute was passed in 1968, and at the time, the Model\nPenal Code had been passed in 1962, and the Eighth\nCircuit had said that the law was and there is no doubt\nthat the defendant does not have the burden of proving\nhis duress defense. So we believe that at the time the\nstatute passed, that the clear common -- the clear law\nin the country was that the burden was on the\nGovernment to disprove duress.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And three -- three was what?\nThree States that have adopted it --\nMR. JETT: The statute. By statute.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: By statute.\nMR. JETT: Now, the Government talks about\nthat the defendant can manufacture a defense, but you\ncan do that in any case. You can manufacture a defense\nfor a -- for a plea of not guilty, as to -- as to why\nyou're not guilty. So it really doesn't make a\ndifference. It would be the same thing for self-\ndefense.\nIn this particular case, instead of Ms. Dixon\nhaving bought the guns, if she had gotten a hold of one\nof Mr. Wright's guns and shot him, she would have had a\nself-defense, and if she had done that, then the burden\nof proof would have been on the Government to disprove\nself-defense beyond a reasonable doubt. But because\nshe did the less blameworthy thing, that is, that she\nbought guns instead of shooting somebody or killing\nsomebody, she is disadvantaged in -- in the courtroom.\nBecause -- because she raised duress, she then had to\nprove her defense by a preponderance of the evidence.\nAnd it's simply not --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure it's less --\nless blameworthy. I mean, if somebody has a gun to the\nhead of my child and I have a choice between doing a\ncriminal act that he wants me to do and shooting him,\nyou think it's -- the less blameworthy is to go do the\ncriminal act?\nMR. JETT: I think rather than -- than to\nkill somebody it certainly would be.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I wouldn't kill him. I'd\njust wound him.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. JETT: Well, Justice Scalia, I understand\nthe sentiment, but she was -- she was threatened by\nsomebody with -- with a gun and her children were\nthreatened. And she might have killed him. She might\nhave shot him.\nIn either case, though, she is disadvantaged\nby the law. She would have been better off if she had\nshot him or killed him, and it's simply not consistent\nthat she does a less blameworthy action, buying guns\nwhere nobody dies, her children didn't die, there were\nno funerals for her, no funerals for her children, no\nfunerals for the abuser, nobody dies, but she's\ndisadvantage because she doesn't --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you take into account\nthat this was not something that occurred at once?\nThis was a long-term relationship. There were many\nopportunities in which she might have, when her\nchildren were with the grandmother, say, gone to the\npolice.\nMR. JETT: This was a long-term relationship.\nBut what happened in this particular case is the level\nof violence escalated substantially immediately before\nthe gun shows. The violence had been bruising where\nyou couldn't see it. Suddenly it -- it escalated with\na gun in the face and a split lip and a sudden threat\nto the children that we're going -- if I kill you, I'm\ngoing to have to kill your children. So even -- even\nthough it had gone on for a while, it suddenly changed,\nand her state of mind suddenly changed because what was\nmost important to her was the safety of her children.\nAnd so she did what she thought she had to do in order\nto save her children and keep them safe.\nAnd it simply would not be fair that if she\nhad done the less blameworthy action, that she has --\nis more advantaged in court. So you can't square the\nway duress is treated and the way self-defense is\ntreated.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can the judge ask the\ndefendant to produce evidence that there was no\npossibility to go to law enforcement officials, and if\nshe does not produce that evidence, then refuse to give\nthe defense?\nMR. JETT: The judge could do that if he felt\nthat that was -- was appropriate for one of the\nelements. The -- one of the elements is you didn't\nhave an -- a reasonable opportunity to not do the\ncrime. In her mind, she did not believe she did\nbecause she believed that there was somebody at home\nwith a gun threatening her children.\nAnd I'm out of time. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Jett.\n"
