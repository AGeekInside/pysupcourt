PHILLIPS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nWhen Judge Wood on the Seventh Circuit\naddressed precisely the same issue that's before this\nCourt, I think she correctly observed that the\ndistinction between an ongoing violation that arises\nwith each new use of a seniority system and the present\neffect of a past discrimination is a distinction that is\nsubtle at best.\nBut it is the line that this Court has asked\nthe lower courts to draw, and I think the majority of\nthose courts have actually drawn that line\nappropriately, although you could actually probably\nargue that it's more a scatter plot than it is a line.\nAnd I think it's a scatter plot that essentially looks\nto three primary factors in evaluating whether or not\nthis is a case that is more like Evans and Lorance and\nLedbetter, or a case that is more like Bazemore.\nAnd those three factors are the stale nature\nof the claims, whether or not there is a seniority at\nstake, and whether or not the employees have fair and\nadequate notice at the time of the action of the\nemployer.\nLet's look at the staleness of the claim.\nIn this particular case, we are talking about maternity\nleaves that were taken by -- taken by the Respondents\nbetween 1968 and 1976. The information that's available\nto AT&T today is simply whether or not these particular\nindividuals were paid for periods of time. There is\nnothing more than that.\nWe have no way of knowing whether or not\nthese were maternity leaves or not maternity leaves,\nwhether these were leaves to go to school, leaves to\ntake care of -- of parents, or leaves for any other\nparticular purpose.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But at the time -- at the\ntime of the original reduction of credits, was there any\nright claimed that any of these women had? I mean,\nnothing had happened to them except there was a\nbookkeeping entry. They wouldn't be hurt until they\nsought retirement or sought some other benefit that\nincreased seniority would give them. But could they\nhave come into court just from, on the books of AT&T,\nthey were docked X number of days? Nothing has happened\nas a consequence of that.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Justice Ginsburg, they not\nonly could have, but they did. If you look at the\nEighth Circuit's decision -- and, indeed, Respondents in\nthis case did -- in the Communications Worker case out\nof the Eighth Circuit, which is 602 F.2d 304, they\nspecifically alleged that one of the Bell operating\ncompanies, one of the subsidiaries, had, in fact,\nrefused to grant these -- these exact service credits,\nsued on that basis pre-PDA, and alleged that they were\nentitled to relief.\nThe Eighth Circuit in that case looked at\nthis Court's decision in Gilbert and looked at this\nCourt's decision in Satty, and said specifically this\ncase is more like Gilbert than it's like Satty, but\nnever remotely questioned that that was an actionable\nclaim at that point in time. And, candidly, it seems to\nme clear that that's an actionable claim because there\n-- there is very little that is quite as critical in\nthis process -- in the employment relationship as\nseniority. And -- and we are not talking about simply\nbenefits seniority here. We are talking about\ncompetitive seniority.\nSo whether you have a -- a better claim to a\ncushier job or -- or to better working conditions, all\nof those are determined on the basis of -- of seniority,\nwhich is being decided on an individualized basis.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it hadn't been\napplied in any of those situations yet. At -- at the --\nat the point when the person returns from leave and is\ndocked a certain number of days, it hasn't been applied\nto any of the situations you mentioned. I grant you the\ncase would be totally ripe if there was a better job to\nbid for, if there was an early retirement opportunity.\nBut here there was nothing -- nothing to be done.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I --\nI question the premise that there was nothing to be\ndone. I think the average person told that they have\nless seniority today than they had yesterday, and if\nthey were told that on the basis of -- of gender-based\ndiscrimination or race-based discrimination, would say:\nI am entitled to go to court today.\nNot only do I think that that's the way most\npeople would react to it, but the reality is if you look\nat the way the litigation arose in the Eighth Circuit\ncase that I alluded to earlier, these very -- the same\nunion here made exactly that claim prior to the passage\nof the PDA. So the notion that the employees, one,\ndidn't have notice -- they clearly did have notice --\nand, two, didn't have an incentive to act, they clearly\ndid have an incentive to act.\nAnd I think this is not much different from\nwhat the Court said in Ricks, which is that obviously\nyou have more of an incentive when you feel the true\npain of a -- of a discriminatory act, assuming the act\nwas in -- was, in fact, discriminatory, but the\nobligation to respond more -- to respond sooner remains\non the plaintiff.\nAnd, again, to go back to the point I was\ntrying to make initially, these are all claims that\narose -- these are all actions taken between 1968 and\n1976. And one of the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you -- you have to, I\nthink, recognize that there's a big difference between\nEvans, who was told, goodbye, you got married, you have\nto resign -- a definite act that had immediate\nconsequences -- and this, where there -- there is a\npotential for future consequences but no immediate\nconsequence of the kind that existed in your model case,\nEvans.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I mean, Justice Ginsburg,\nthere's -- there's no question that the impact in Evans\nis -- is stronger than the impact here. I will readily\nconcede that. But what I won't concede is that the\nimportance of seniority is so far down the pecking order\nor so de minimis in its impact that it would be\nreasonable to assume that the average employee, told\nthat I'm am taking away your seniority on the basis --\non the basis of your race, would then sit back and say:\nI'm not going to do anything; I'm going to wait until\nthe impact of that is felt.\nTo the contrary, you would expect, given the\n-- the centrality of seniority as a term of employment,\nthat any employee under those circumstances would\nrespond, you know, almost immediately under those\ncircumstances.\nThe -- the second factor in this case that,\nit seems to me, this Court has relied upon significantly\nin the prior decisions that have come out on the side of\nnot allowing this kind of litigation to go forward is we\nare talking about a seniority system here. And the --\nas I said a minute ago, it's not just the rights of the\nindividual and what benefits she might be entitled to.\nThe seniority system obviously affects the rights of all\nmembers of the -- of the seniority plan and all of the\npension plan and the entire system that the seniority\noperates on. And so there are third-party interests\nthat are involved here.\nAnd, again, both Congress and this Court's\ndecisions have consistently recognized that when that\nsituation arises, the resolution of the question ought\nto be to say, no, these are present effects of past\ndiscriminatory acts; we should be loath to try to\ninterfere with those -- with that seniority scheme under\nthese circumstances.\nAnd then the third factor that it seems to\nme the Court has been concerned about -- and it's one we\nhave been discussing -- which is the -- the -- you know,\nthe adequacy of the notice, where the employee is put on\nnotice at the time that actions were being taken.\nNow, we can quarrel about how serious the --\nthe actions were, how detrimental they might have been.\nBut it seems to me there is no question that the -- that\nthe injury here is real and that the average employee\nbeing told that you are being deprived of seniority on\n-- on a race-based or sex-based or any other condition\nthat is protected would act immediately.\nNow, it seems to me that the only argument\nthat the -- that the Respondents offer on the other side\n-- and it's almost a mantra-like exposition by them and\nit was certainly the basis for the Ninth Circuit, and I\nthink it's where the mistake arises -- is this claim\nthat this is -- is a facially discriminatory policy.\nAnd their argument is if it's facially discriminatory,\nthen you can apply it now, and all of the reasons why\nthis Court has not applied these -- these kinds of\nclaims in the past in Evans and Lorance and Ledbetter is\n-- is -- are off the hook in this circumstance.\nBut the truth is this is not a facially\ndiscriminatory policy. In the first place, this exact\nsame policy was looked at in \"SAH-tee\" or \"SAT-ee.\" I\ndon't know exactly how to pronounce it. And the Court\nsaid these kinds of arrangements where you don't give\nservice credit for people who take pregnancy leave is\nnot facially discriminatory. So --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that was when Gilbert\nwas prevailing. Certainly, we would not regard it that\nway today.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I don't know whether it\nwould be regarded as facially discriminatory today. I\nthink it would be regarded as illegal today. Whether it\nwould be facially discriminatory I think is a -- is a\ntrickier question, because again it seems to me that --\nthat the other side relies heavily on the statement in\nLorance about facially discriminatory plans.\nBut what the Court described as a facially\ndiscriminatory plan in that day was it was -- in that\ncase, was a situation where every day a male worker is\ncredited with a full day of work for a day's -- a day's\neffort, and a woman is credited with half a day's work\nfor a day's effort. And -- and the Court said, quite\nrightly, that's a facially discriminatory plan.\nWell, we don't have anything like that in\nthis case. This plan was changed in the wake of the\npassage of the PDA to bring it completely in compliance.\nSo the plan, as it operates today, is -- is not only not\nfacially discriminatory; it is in no way discriminatory\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: Btu you -- what about --\nI'm trying to work with this distinction where I agree\nwith you that it's hard to see exactly what it is. But\nif I look at Bazemore, I think there we have a large\nnumber of employees. And if you look at a complicated\nthing, a salary structure, earlier, you see that that\nsalary structure systemically paid black people less\nthan white people. And at the time, for whatever\nreasons, there wasn't a statute -- we assume that that\nwas lawful at the time.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then later it turns out\nthat they are keeping that salary structure, although\nnot for racially motivated reasons. They are keeping it\nsimply because that's what it was. And the Court says,\nyou've taken that complex structure, and you are\nadministering it now, and the administration of it now\nis what is unlawful.\nThen, look at your case. We had a\ncomplicated structure involving seniority, really. And\npart of that old seniority system was this rule which\nwas legal at the time. It is no longer legal.\nNow, we move that structure over until now,\nand we see we are administering the same complex\nstructure today in the same kind of way that was at\nissue at Bazemore. It's a complicated set of rules that\nyou have to apply today in order to see who is entitled\nto what, just as they did that in Bazemore. So I began\nto think, doesn't that, on the key matter, look very\nmuch like Bazemore? What is your response?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Justice Breyer, I -- I -- in\nlooking at this case, I have long thought of it as kind\nof an M.C. Escher picture, where you look at it from one\ndirection and it looks one way, and then you turn it and\nyou look at it the other way, and it looks completely\ndifferent to you.\nBut I think the right answer to -- to your\nanalysis is that the way to look at Bazemore is that\nevery day after the statute was enacted, every employee\nwho showed up to work who was black was paid less than\nevery employee who showed up to work who was white. And\nthat, it seems to me, as the Court said in Bazemore,\nunanimously and without a whole lot of fanfare, is just\nsomething simply illegal under Title VII under those\ncircumstances.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but why can't you make\nexactly the same kind of analysis here? People here are\nnot showing up for work. They are staying home and\ngetting retirement benefits. And every day a person who\nwas out for 90 days because of a physical illness other\nthan pregnancy is getting a retirement benefit with an\nextra dollar. And everybody who was out -- who was out\nfor 90 days for maternity is only getting an extra 33\ncents. And -- and why isn't the payment of the\nretirement benefit exactly on par with the payment of\nthe salary in Bazemore?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I -- I mean, I think the\nanswer to that, Justice Souter, is that's not -- that's\ncertainly not an implausible way of trying to look at\nthis problem, but if you look at the language of this\nCourt two terms ago in Ledbetter, and I'll quote it for\nyou: \"The fact that pre-charging period discrimination\nadversely affects the calculation of a neutral factor\nlike seniority\" -- which is what we are talking about\nhere -- \"that is used in determining future pay\" --\nwhich is the benefits from this program -- \"does not\nmean that each new paycheck constitutes a new violation\nand restarts the EEOC charging period.\"\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, do you -- do you see\nLedbetter in effect as -- as overruling Bazemore?\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, I think Ledbetter deals\nwith Bazemore in the context of a -- of a true seniority\nsystem and an arrangement in which what you are looking\nat -- because our case is a fortiori from -- from Evans\nand -- and Ledbetter because, remember, we are talking\nabout a situation where what we did at the time, in our\njudgment, was perfectly legal.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And -- and at the time, in\nBazemore, that the private employers discriminated for\nracial purposes, that was not unconstitutional or\nillegal, either.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right, I understand that, but\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: At that time, even --\nMR. PHILLIPS: And then --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- even more so. You --\nyou've said several times that it was perfectly legal,\nbut isn't it true that the law in all of the circuits\nwas the other way, and it wasn't until this Court\ndecided the Gilbert case that the law changed? But if\nyou were -- if you were an employer and you were\nadvising a client in, say, 1975, look to see where the\ncircuits were, the circuits said, yes, discrimination on\nthe basis of pregnancy is surely discrimination on the\nbasis of sex. It wasn't until this Court decided first\nthe Aiello case and then Gilbert that -- that that law\nchanged. But --\nMR. PHILLIPS: I mean, I understand that,\nJustice Ginsburg, and obviously we don't quarrel with\nthat. The problem obviously is the Court did decide\nGilbert; the Court didn't say the law changed. It was\nthe way the Court interpreted the statute at the time,\nand under the interpretation of Gilbert and Satty, what\nwe did was perfectly legal, and when the statute\nchanged, what we did was to bring ourselves into\nassiduous compliance with that position, Justice Souter,\nwhich is what I think distinguishes --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but I mean, that --\nwith respect, I think that sort of begs the question\nbecause if Bazemore is the right template for analyzing\nthis case, then you're not in compliance when you --\nwhen your payment of the pension benefit reflects the\npregnancy differential.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Justice Souter, there's no\nquestion that you can read Bazemore that way. I just\nthink that the way this Court has read Bazemore and\nLorance and Ledbetter suggests that, in the context of\nthe case we have here, the right answer is this is more\nlike present effects of past allegedly discriminatory\nacts and, therefore, not actionable at this time.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Let me just be sure I\nunderstand one thing: Are you contending that the plan\nis not unlawful or that the claim is untimely?\nMR. PHILLIPS: We are -- well, both,\nactually. We say it's not -- we say it's untimely, but\nwe also say that if --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: At the time it was\nadopted, it was lawful.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right, exactly. And that\notherwise it would have to be retroactive application of\nthe PDA.\nI would like to reserve the balance of my\ntime.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMs. Blatt.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMS. BLATT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThe Ninth Circuit's decision in this case\nimpermissibly imposes retroactive liability on\nPetitioner, and Respondents' claims are in any event\ntime-barred.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Miss Blatt, that was not\nthe position of the only representative of the United\nStates in the Ninth Circuit, as far as I know, the EEOC,\nthe brief in the Ninth Circuit. We don't hear from the\nEEOC in this Court, but I think it was not just that\nbrief but in the EEOC manual, they are taking a position\nthat is 180 degrees opposite yours. Am I right in --\nMS. BLATT: You are absolutely correct. You\nare absolutely correct. And Ledbetter -- this Court's\ndecision in Ledbetter, which was issued after both the\ncompliance manual and after the EEOC filed their brief,\nexplained that the EEOC is entitled to no special\ndeference on the interpretation of this Court's cases.\nAnd the EEOC's interpretation is based on a conclusion\nwhether this case is governed by Evans or Bazemore, and\nthe EEOC hasn't purported to even discuss the\nretroactivity -- or the retroactive imposition of\nliability because the pregnancy leaves in this case were\ntaken before the PDA and, as the EEOC acknowledged in\nthat compliance manual, that denial of service credit at\nthe time was lawful under this Court's decision.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Would you -- would you --\nexcuse me -- would you agree that if -- well, let me be\nless rhetorical about it. What if Congress passed a\nstatute providing that, starting one year from the\neffective date of the statute, no pension plan will\ndifferentiate in computing pension benefits on leaves\ntaken between -- as between leaves taken for -- for\nconventional sickness and leaves taken for pregnancy.\nWould that statute be unconstitutional?\nMS. BLATT: Unconstitutional?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nMS. BLATT: I think -- I mean, the way I\nunderstand your case is that Congress can speak in clear\nlanguage to impose retroactive --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: To make it retroactive.\nYes.\nMS. BLATT: Retrospective liability. It's\njust there's nothing in the PDA that indicates that\nretroactive liability was imposed. And --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So your -- your argument\nsimply is a -- a purely statutory construction argument:\nThat isn't what Congress had in mind.\nMS. BLATT: Right, and your hypothetical\nstatute would seem inconsistent with --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If Congress would have had\nin mind, then there would be a question whether Congress\ncould do it, and you agree that it could. So the\nquestion is simply: Did it or didn't it in this case?\nMS. BLATT: That's right, and I think the --\nthe seniority system provision, 703(h), would just be\ncompletely counter to that hypothetical provision\nbecause Congress has taken special care to make sure\nseniority systems can continue to exist, even though\nthey incorporate pre-Act discrimination.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Was this statute effective\n180 days after its -- after signature?\nMS. BLATT: With respect to fringe benefit\nprograms, I think it was effective on the date it\npassed. And there's no question -- everyone concedes --\nthat AT&T immediately came into compliance on the\neffective date of the Act.\nAnd the -- our key point on retroactivity is\nthe way to look at this is what the statute prohibited\nand that is discrimination on the basis of pregnancy.\nAnd the pregnancy discrimination occurred in this case\nbased on the discriminatory leave policies, and those --\nthose were all taken in the '60s and '70s before the PDA\nwas passed. And what the Ninth Circuit's decision does\nis it orders Petitioner to restore service credit taken\nfor the pregnancy leave before the passage of the -- of\nthe PDA. And I --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Do you -- do you think\nLedbetter modified or overruled Bazemore?\nMS. BLATT: No. It just put it in context,\nand I don't think that Bazemore deals with the\nretroactivity point, and let me explain why: The -- the\nemployer in Bazemore who continued to pay African\nAmericans less than whites was ordered prospectively to\nstart paying equal wages for equal work, but\nspecifically not ordered to make up for past wage\ndifferentials. And I think it's for three reasons.\nWhat this does is much -- much more prejudicial and\nupsets expectations in three ways, and this is some of\nthe things that Mr. Phillips talked about. And at the\ntime the pregnancy leaves were taken, the Petitioner was\nentitled and probably required to make planning and\nfunding decisions for its pension liabilities.\nSecond, the Petitioner should not, 30 to 40\nyears after the fact, have to defend claims about\nwhether these women were disabled and actually unable to\nwork due to pregnancy, when medical records and\npersonnel records are probably missing and memories long\nsince faded.\nAnd, third, the retroactive scrambling of a\nseniority system upsets the vested rights of other\nemployees.\nAnd I just don't think you have any of that\nin Bazemore. The employer said --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, why does it upset --\nMS. BLATT: -- you me to pay out money\nprospectively.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So far as pension benefits\nare concerned, it doesn't upset any employee's\nexpectations. The ones who don't have a pregnancy\nbackground are going to get the same pension that they\n-- they bargained for.\nMS. BLATT: Well, I think of a pension plan\nas a zero-sum game. There's a more limited amount. But\nmore specifically, there --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, but that -- I mean,\nthat's -- that's an issue that you touched on, on your\nsecond point. I don't know if it is a zero-sum game.\nAnd if -- if I were faced with -- with a problem, and I\nmay be, in which I really have two choices -- I've got\ntwo analogies in our cases, I can take either one, and\nthere were evidence in here that the -- that this was\ngoing to be so traumatic to the pension system that it\nwould be manifestly unfair and perhaps endanger benefits\nfor others to force these benefits to be paid, that\nwould be a good reason to go one way. But I don't think\nwe have that in the case. And --\nMS. BLATT: Well, I --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And if we don't have it in\nthe case, then this isn't a zero-sum game.\nMS. BLATT: Well, we don't know what we have\nin the case, because it was -- it was -- liability was\nimposed on summary judgment. The class allegations are\n15,000.\nBut my point on vested seniority rights is\nthat the class includes current employees. The\nRespondent Porter is a current employee. The order in\nthis case is to restore seniority credit, I assume for\ncurrent employees, which will give them greater\nseniority rights vis-a-vis other employees who have\nplanned their own issues about job bidding and\nretirement and seniority based on 30 to 40 years of\nexpectations. So I --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But this is not a\nsituation like Evans, somebody who was out of the\nworkforce for 4 years and then is going to come back and\nbump some people who -- who filled in while she was not\nworking, and get that credit. This is quite different.\nThis is just a question of weeks.\nMS. BLATT: No, I think some -- some of\nthese people had very significant disabilities, over 6,\n7 months. But in terms of the fairness here, I mean,\nthe -- the female flight attendant was discharged on a\nfacially discriminatory policy of forcing married female\nflight attendants to resign. Here, the two Supreme\nCourt cases have said that the decision -- as\ninexplicable as it was, the decision not to treat\npregnancy as a disability was not on its face a\ndiscriminatory policy.\nNow, the PDA immediately overruled that, but\napplied it prospectively, and now we are here 30 to 40\nyears later basically litigating the complaint that was\nbrought in the Eighth Circuit as well as the complaint\nthat was brought in the Second Circuit by the Respondent\nhere. They brought this case twice in the Second -- and\nthese are all cited on the Petitioner's brief and the\nreply brief on page 17.\nIn the Second Circuit case, it was granted,\nvacated, and remanded in light of Gilbert. And then in\nthe Eighth Circuit case, they actually lost on the\nmerits under Satty.\nNow, the only thing that has changed is the\npassage of 30 years and the PDA, which doesn't apply\nretroactively. So I just think that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do I correctly understand\nthat -- that you would agree that if this plan were\nadopted today it would be unlawful, but because it was\n-- that at the time it was adopted, and the statute uses\nthe word \"adopted,\" it was lawful?\nMS. BLATT: Let me be very clear on this.\nThe seniority system in this case is facially neutral;\nit just accords seniority to men and women on an equal\nbasis depending on whether they took disability leave or\npersonal leave. The leave policy that forced women to\ntake pregnancy leave as personal leave would be illegal\nif it were adopted today, because the PDA says you can't\ntreat -- women affected by pregnancy have to be treated\nfor the same purposes.\nSo the seniority system is always just the\nsame. It says, based on total years of service, you get\npension benefits, men and women the same. In the\naccrual policy, men and women were treated identically.\nJust like in Evans, men and women were denied seniority\nor service credit if they were terminated for -- for\ncharge, and there was a separate unlawful policy that\nbasically defined -- cause -- excuse me -- if you were\nterminated for cause -- and a separate policy that\ndefined \"cause\" to say, well, if you were a female\nflight attendant and you married, then you were forced\nto resign. So obviously that policy was always\nunlawful. It would be unlawful today. And similarly,\nif AT&T hadn't had changed its leave policy, someone\ncould sue immediately. I mean, these women -- the\nimmediate --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Before you -- do I\nunderstand your answer to Justice Stevens's question to\nbe yes, it would be legal to adopt this seniority policy\ntoday?\nMS. BLATT: Yes -- the seniority system is\ntheir seniority system, and it's completely neutral and\ncompletely lawful. AT&T's pre-PDA leave policy. That\nif you were a woman and you take pregnancy --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understand, but\nwe're --\nMS. BLATT: -- that's unlawful today. That\nwould be facial discrimination on the basis of\npregnancy, and it would be unlawful.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But even adopting\nthe policy today -- which I thought was\nJustice Stevens's question, and maybe it's not -- that\nwould be acceptable? In other words, it's not simply\nthe fact that this -- the leave policy -- the seniority\npolicy was adopted during the time prior to Gilbert?\nMS. BLATT: I -- AT&T could not adopt their\nleave policy today, and --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They couldn't adopt\nthe leave policy. Could they adopt today a leave -- a\nseniority policy today based on -- today, based on the\npre-Gilbert situation?\nMS. BLATT: Oh. Then I think you would have\na -- well, you would have an unlawful policy that\nsomeone could sue on immediately, and it would be facial\ndiscrimination, and we wouldn't be up here making a\nretroactivity argument because no court would be\nordering them to undo decisions that were made before\nthe passage of the Act. They today would be making\ndecisions and there were nothing -- there would be no\nretroactive imposition of liability.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms.\nBlatt.\nMr. Russell.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN RUSSELL\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. RUSSELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe distinction between Evans and this case\nturns on the difference between discrimination outside\nof the seniority system which affects an employee's\nability to provide service to the employer, and\ndiscrimination within the seniority system itself that\ngives unequal credit for equal service.\nCongress drew that line, adopting one that\nthis Court had referred to in Lorance, when it passed\nsection 706(e)(2) of Title VII, which provided that a\nfacially discriminatory seniority system can be\nchallenged, not only when --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask a question? If\nthere is a facially discriminatory system, are you\nsaying this is a disparate impact case or a disparate\ntreatment case?\nMR. RUSSELL: This is a disparate treatment\ncase.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: When did the -- when did\nthe intentional discrimination take place?\nMR. RUSSELL: It took place when AT&T\napplied an accrual rule to my clients' disability leave,\nand said --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You do not -- you do not\ncontend that the plan was unlawful at the time it was\nadopted?\nMR. RUSSELL: We think that it was, but it\ndoesn't matter. Ultimately under 706(e)(2), what\nmatters is that the plan discriminated on its face. And\nthe insight beyond that -- and that doesn't turn on\nwhether it is unlawful or not. A plan that\ndiscriminates against short people discriminates on its\nface, intentionally discriminates on the basis of height\nevery time it's applied; and when it does, whether it's\nlawful or not, is applied in accordance with the law\nthat existed at the time of the application.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, let me ask you this\nquestion: At the time the plan was adopted,\ndiscrimination on the basis of pregnancy was not\ndiscrimination on the basis of sex, according to the\nmajority in Gilbert.\nMR. RUSSELL: That's correct.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Which I happen to disagree\nwith.\nSo as a matter of law, it seems to me at the\ntime the plan was adopted it was a lawful plan.\nMR. RUSSELL: Well, we think it was unlawful\nfor two reasons, and one is that it was unlawful under\nSatty. Now, I acknowledge --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Under what?\nMR. RUSSELL: Under Satty, under the Court's\ndecision in Satty that said discrimination with respect\nto seniority had an unlawful discriminatory impact on\nthe basis of sex.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That was -- that was\ncoming back to work and having all of your seniority\nstripped. Is that --\nMR. RUSSELL: That is correct, but we don't\nthink that there's a distinction because what the Court\nsaid was that the injury is cognizable because it\naffects employment opportunities.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but I thought the\nquestion was whether it was unlawful at the time, before\nthe later statute.\nMR. RUSSELL: Yes, and we think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and you say that,\neven though discriminating against pregnancy leave was\nitself lawful, a retirement plan that did not give you\ncredit for the time of that pregnancy leave was\nunlawful?\nMR. RUSSELL: No. Let me be clear. We\nthink that at the time our clients took their leave, it\nwas unlawful under Title VII and under Satty to\ndiscriminate on the basis of pregnancy with respect to\nseniority, whether it's the right to retain accrued\nseniority or the right to accumulate it in the first\nplace.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you say Gilbert had\nnothing to do with it?\nMR. RUSSELL: Gilbert said that it wasn't\nintentional discrimination on the basis of sex. Satty\nsaid it had an unlawful disparate impact on the basis of\nsex. But ultimately none of this matters, because under\nsection 706(e)(2), the question is whether the system as\na whole, which includes the accruable, discriminates on\nits face, whether it's intentionally discriminatory; and\nthe insight behind that rule was, as I said before with\nthe example of a height discrimination, a rule that\ndiscriminates on the basis of height intentionally\ndiscriminates on the basis of height every time it's\napplied.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could you -- could I\npause? I'd just trying to understand your earlier\nanswer. It just took me a little while before you got\noff on the other point.\nYou're saying it was lawful at the time to\ndeliberately discriminate on the basis of pregnancy --\nGilbert -- but that that was somehow unlawful if in fact\nyour deliberate discrimination had a disparate impact?\nMR. RUSSELL: Had a disparate impact on the\nbasis of sex, yes. That's what Satty held -- that's\nwhat Satty held clearly with respect to accrued\nseniority.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, maybe I'm\nmissing it. Isn't it a bit unusual to say it's\nperfectly all right to discriminate intentionally, but\nif it has a disparate impact, that's not all right?\nMR. RUSSELL: That's every disparate impact\ncase. It's not that it's all right. It's just that\nit's not --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I -- I don't\nthink it's every disparate impact case. In a disparate\nimpact case, it's because you can't show, typically,\ndeliberate discrimination, so you look at what the\nimpact was. But I guess I've never heard of a case\nwhere it's okay to do something intentionally, but it's\nillegal -- to discriminate intentionally, but it's\nillegal if that has a disparate impact.\nMR. RUSSELL: Let me just be clear about the\nterms. Gilbert said it was not unlawful intentional sex\ndiscrimination, but Satty said that it constitutes --\nthat pregnancy discrimination with respect to seniority\ncredits constitutes -- has an unlawful disparate impact\non the basis of sex. In that sense --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but Gilbert\nsaid it wasn't discrimination on the basis of sex,\nbecause it said that discrimination on the basis of\npregnancy was not discrimination on the basis of sex;\nand yet you are saying if there is a disparate impact on\nthe basis of pregnancy, then it is discrimination on the\nbase of sex.\nMR. RUSSELL: Let me try one more time. And\nmaybe -- it's just to say that sometimes, intentional\ndiscrimination on the basis of pregnancy can have a\ndisparate impact on the basis of sex. That's what Satty\nsaid -- Satty said. But --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is your -- is there\nany other -- can you cite a case to me where we have\nheld there is discriminatory treatment, but that's\nlawful, but the discriminatory impact of that is\nunlawful?\nMR. RUSSELL: Well, I think a height\nrequirement would be intentional discrimination on the\nbasis of height that could have an unlawful disparate\nimpact on the basis of sex. I think it's a parallel\nconstruction.\nBut, ultimately, I -- I don't want to waste\ntoo much time on this, because I don't think it matters\nbecause the insight behind section 706(e)(2) is that\nevery act that implements a facially discriminatory\nsystem constitutes a fresh act of that intentional\ndiscrimination. And so there's no question --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But does the statute use\nthe term -- does the statute use the term \"facially\ndiscriminatory system\"?\nMR. RUSSELL: No. It uses the term\n\"intentionally discriminatory system.\"\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Right.\nMR. RUSSELL: And there's no dispute that a\nfacially discriminatory system discriminates\nintentionally. And so --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It is also clear that --\nis it also clear that a statute -- that -- that a plan\nthat does not intentionally discriminate may,\nnevertheless, discriminate facially? I think the two\nthings --\nMR. RUSSELL: Well, again, it's -- it's the\npredicates that change. It's a -- it can be a plan that\ndoesn't intentionally discriminate on the basis of sex\nat the time, in the past. But when it -- but it's clear\nthat it intentionally discriminates on the basis of\npregnancy.\nAnd so then the question -- so then under\n706(e)(2), under this Court's insight in Lorance, the\ncurrent application of that system constitutes a present\nact --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but that was the\ncurrent application of a system that was plainly\ndiscriminatory, intentionally discriminatory. Lorance\nwas. They intentionally discriminated against women.\nMR. RUSSELL: Yes. The -- the intent behind\nthe system is imbued in every application of the system.\nSo a system that is intentionally discriminatory on the\nbasis of pregnancy discriminates intentionally on the\nbasis of pregnancy every time it's applied. And the\nquestion --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Go on, finish. I --\nMR. RUSSELL: And, under Section 706(e)(2),\nthe question is simply whether that discrimination is\nunlawful at the time of application --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand why you\nsay that the retirement plan is facially discriminatory\nnow. You contend that right now it's facially\ndiscriminatory.\nMR. RUSSELL: Yes, it's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me what the\nretirement plan says is that there is deducted from your\nseniority, for purposes of calculating what you get\nunder the plan, all periods in which you -- you were\nlawfully not deemed to be -- to be working for the\ncompany. Now, that doesn't seem to be facially\ndiscriminatory at all.\nMR. RUSSELL: I think it's -- the system is\nfacially discriminatory -- there are several parts. One\nis: What set of rules constitutes a relevant seniority\nsystem? And we think that the rule that says pregnancy\nleave doesn't get full credit is as an accrual rule,\nit's part of the seniority system. And that rule\ndiscriminated on its face on the basis of pregnancy.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, but it didn't. Not --\nnot during the period for which it is used in -- in the\nretirement system.\nMR. RUSSELL: There's no --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: After the new legislation\nwas passed, yes, pregnancy leave counts for seniority.\nBut -- but during the period before that occurred, it\nwas not counted towards seniority, and it -- and it was\nlawfully not counted towards seniority.\nSo what you have is a retirement plan that\nsays all lawful periods of work -- all periods of work\nare -- that lawfully must be credited will be credited\nto the -- to the employees. I don't see how that is\nfacially discriminatory.\nMR. RUSSELL: It facially discriminates on\nthe basis of pregnancy and then does so whether the\npregnancy discrimination was unlawful at the time or\nnot. And under 706(e)(2), that -- that facially\ndiscriminatory intent to discriminate on the basis of\npregnancy is carried forward today in every application.\nAnd the whole point of the rule was simply to say that\nwe don't want to force employees to have to run into\ncourt every time there's some discrimination --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is -- is there a difference\nbetween \"facially discriminatory\" and \"discriminatory\nimpact\"? I mean I can see how you could say it has a\ndiscriminatory impact, but to say that on its face, when\nall it says is that you are credited with all of the\nperiods in which you were lawfully working for the\ncompany and you are not credited for periods in which\nthe company lawfully deemed you not to be working for\nthe company, I don't see how that is facially\ndiscriminatory in -- in any sense.\nMR. RUSSELL: Well, that scenario, I think,\nis indistinguishable from what happened in Bazemore.\nRecall, in Bazemore, that the basic rule is you get paid\nnow today what we paid you before Title VII, plus a\nnondiscriminatory raise. And this Court said that that\nis simply perpetuation of the pre-Act intentional race\ndiscrimination, which wasn't unlawful at the time. But\nif you apply that system today, that constitutes a\npresent act of racial discrimination subject to the\npresent requirements of Title VII.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Did it say it was facially\ndiscriminatory? I'm -- I'm just talking about your --\nyour assertion that it's facially discriminatory. Did\nBasemore more say it was facially discriminatory?\nMR. RUSSELL: No, Bazemore did not use that\nterm. But this Court, in Ledbetter, assumed that the\nrationale of Bazemore was the rationale this Court gave\nin Lorance, which was that it involved a --\nintentionally a systematic system of discrimination\nthat, even though it was lawful when it was instituted\n-- was first instituted, its carrying over into the\npresent era subjects it to the requirements of Title VII\nnow.\nAnd I don't think it's -- it's fairly\ndistinguishable because what the employer in Bazemore\ndid is -- is simply what AT&T has done here. At the\ntime Title VII took effect, the employer in Bazemore\nstopped giving discriminatory base salaries and stopped\ngiving discriminatory pay raises, but it just added to\nthat base salary in a nondiscriminatory manner, in the\nsame way that AT&T stopped discriminating in the amounts\nthat it added to accrued seniority.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, but in Bazemore each\npaycheck was discriminatory.\nMR. RUSSELL: It was discriminatory in the\nsense that it paid unequal wages for equal work. And\nhere our pension checks give unequal compensation for\nequal amounts of service to the company.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But the reason for that is\nbecause they adopted a plan a long time ago that was\nlawful.\nMR. RUSSELL: Well, the same thing was true\nin Bazemore. They had adopted --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: They're not applying a\nplan in Bazemore. They're paying a current salary.\nThey're paying black people less than whites just\nbecause they are black.\nMR. RUSSELL: They were applying a pay\nstructure that was adopted --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, they were still\npaying -- each paycheck was a discriminatory paycheck.\nIt didn't depend on history; whereas, a pension plan --\nthey always look at the formation of the plan. At least\nunder subsection (h), I think you do.\nMR. RUSSELL: The paychecks were in -- in\nBazemore were intentionally discriminatory only insofar\nas you look back to the pre-Title VII --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And that's what I disagree\nwith. It seems to me if you look at the present in\nBazemore, you find they are getting different salaries\nbecause of the difference in -- one is of one race, and\nthe other is of another race.\nMR. RUSSELL: And the same is true here.\nOur clients are giving --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The -- the point that is\nnot true that -- that Justice Stevens is bringing out is\nthat, in this case, you had a plan which was established\nat a time when the plan was -- was lawful. And, in\neffect, you are saying there is -- there is no value to\nbe given to any reliance interest on the part of the\ncompany that established the plan when it funded\naccording -- prior to the passage of the Act, when --\nwhen it -- it calculated it's funding on the basis of\nwhat was, in fact, lawful conduct. And you are saying\nthat is irrelevant. You didn't have that factor in\nBazemore.\nMR. RUSSELL: It's not irrelevant. It's\nsimply something that this Court has traditionally taken\ninto account at the remedial stage. The Court has --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, how would it do that?\nMR. RUSSELL: Well, the -- in Florida v.\nLong -- there's a long line of cases where this Court --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you're -- you're not\nasking the Court to do that, are you? You -- you're\nsaying, look, pay -- pay pension benefits to these\npeople exactly as they would have been calculated if, in\nfact, their pregnancy had been treated as whatever the\nregular sick leave was, so that they would get full\ncredit for the time they were out. You're -- you're not\nasking for any remedial order that gives them anything\nless than 100 percent of what they want.\nMR. RUSSELL: We're not asking for that\nbecause we don't think that there are substantial\nreliance interests that are -- with respect to the --\nthe liquidity of the -- the pension plan that are\naffected here. My point is simply that --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: How -- how do we -- you\nthink that? How do we know that?\nMR. RUSSELL: Well --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: How do we know -- maybe --\nmaybe I can put the same question in a different way.\nLet's assume -- and this isn't a bizarre assumption here\n-- that we've got two lines of cases, and we could rely\non either of those lines of cases, go one way if -- if\nwe rely on line a, and go another way if we rely on line\nb.\nWhat are the good reasons, apart from simply\nstatements of the cases themselves, to go with the one\nline or the other line? One reason would be reliance\ninterests in setting up a pension plan to distinguish\nthis from Bazemore. How are we in a position to make\nthat judgment?\nMR. RUSSELL: I don't think you are, which\nis why I do think that it's perfectly appropriate for\nthis Court to do what it did in cases like Manhart,\nwhich is to say there's one definition of\n\"discrimination\" under Title VII, and it's not going to\nvary depending on whether we're talking about the\npension plan or something else.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but doesn't the\nrisk or the potential of a fixed-fund pension plan where\nemployees who are not parties to this action receive\nless? Isn't there at least that possibility?\nMR. RUSSELL: There's only that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And shouldn't that\npossibility be weighed in the decision of this Court? I\nthink that's the line of questioning here.\nMR. RUSSELL: And my suggestion is, number\none, that there's no realistic possibility of that here.\nBut, number two, that that's a --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And there's no realistic\npossibility that some pensions are based on a fixed fund\nwhich has been established already?\nMR. RUSSELL: I don't think so. If you are\ntalking about a defined benefit plan, which is what we\nhave here, any increases in liability simply mean that\nthe employer has to --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I take it that this\ndecision you want us to write applies across the board\nto all plaintiffs.\nMR. RUSSELL: I think that it does, but I\nthink that it could quite possibly apply differently,\nfor example, through a 401(k) plan where the\ndiscrimination would have occurred at a time when people\nare making running contributions. But ultimately, I\nmean, I think that this Court has taken into account\nthose kinds of things at the remedial phase, where you\nhave an opportunity to look at the facts about how this\nwould affect the pension in this case or pensions\ngenerally.\nThere's simply no evidence here to suggest\nthat there are those kinds of problems, because very few\nemployers as far as we can tell continue this kind of\ndiscrimination. Most have eliminated it decades ago.\nAnd we're talking about a small subset of employees and\nrelatively small amounts of money with respect to each\nof them. So I think --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Russell, what do you\nsay to Mr. Phillips' argument that you brought -- you\nbrought essentially this case way back when, that the\nunion said that this retirement plan is in violation of\nTitle VII?\nMR. RUSSELL: Well, first of all, I mean, my\nindividual-named clients didn't bring those claims back\nthen; and they lost, the union that brought this claim.\nAnd then there were -- if I recollect correctly, they\nwere challenging at that moment the denial of their\ndisability leave payments. They weren't coming in and\nsaying simply, you know, the only harm we're facing now\nis the prospect in the future of a lower pension.\nAnd that's the kind of hypothetical future\nharm that we don't think Congress would have intended to\nbe the basis of a lawsuit, not -- one of the -- when the\nentire purpose of enacting 706(e)(2) was that Congress\nwas concerned not to require employees to run to court\nevery time there is some discrimination that affects the\namount of their seniority, because that causes a\ndisruption to the employment atmosphere, it creates work\nfor the EEOC and the courts, and in many, many cases the\nmarginal difference in the amount of the seniority\ncredit we are talking about here will make no big\ndifference at all to anything.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, when you say there's\nrelatively little amounts of money, can you tell us what\namount -- what the maximum amount would be involved?\nAre you --\nMR. RUSSELL: I think -- and we haven't had\ndiscovery on this. I think there is a fairly linear\nrelationship between the amount of leave and the\npercentage of the pension check, and so we're talking in\nbetween --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Would it be less than\n$100,000?\nMR. RUSSELL: Per person?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Would it be -- for the\nwhole suit?\nMR. RUSSELL: No. It would be more than\nthat. It would be about half of a percent to maybe two\nand a half percent per person.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Would that be a million --\na million dollars?\nMR. RUSSELL: It could be millions of\ndollars. And the plan that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But that -- that's a small\namount of money, a million -- millions of dollars?\nMR. RUSSELL: It's a small amount of money\nto a plan that has tens of billions of dollars in it.\nAT&T's last report to the SEC said they had a\n$17 billion surplus in that fund. There's no question\nthat this is going to bankrupt this particular fund.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what do you do\nabout section 703(h) of Title VII, which -- which we\nhave held says that -- that makes it lawful for a bona\nfide seniority system to perpetuate the effects of\npre-Act discrimination?\nMR. RUSSELL: The distinction between 703(h)\nand this case is that, in this case, we challenge a\nsystem, a seniority system that is itself facially\ndiscriminatory, and 703(h) says that doesn't apply --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That hinges -- that hinges\non your \"facially discriminatory.\"\nMR. RUSSELL: It does. And in addition, we\nalso have the argument that the Ninth Circuit accepted,\nbut -- that the PDA on its own terms says, that 703(h)\ndoesn't apply to permit discrimination that the PDA\nitself would forbid.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, yes, that's -- that's\nrather implausible, but 70(h) covers sex discrimination\nand even race discrimination, but it doesn't cover\npregnancy discrimination. I mean, I --\nMR. RUSSELL: You may think that, but --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You need pretty clear\nlanguage to persuade me of that.\nMR. RUSSELL: I think that in the end, I\nmean, it's worthwhile to focus on the consequences of\naccepting AT&T's view. On the better view, it depends\nmightily on whether an employer keeps a running tab on\nseniority, in which case they can avoid the application\nof the PDA because it made the calculation beforehand,\nand an employer who, at the end of an employee's career,\nsimply tabulates the term of employment, which I think\nunder their view subjects that employer to the current\nrequirements of the PDA. And we respectfully suggest\nthat Congress wouldn't intend Title VII to turn on such\ntrivial distinctions.\nMoreover, under their view, an employer\nwho -- an employer would be able to pay black workers\ntoday smaller pensions than white workers who provided\nexactly the same amount of service, if those black\nworkers started working for it before Title VII was\nenacted, at a time when the employer had no pension\nsystem for blacks and didn't give them any seniority\ncredit. That employer could say the same thing AT&T\nsays here, which is that the present disparity in\npension benefits is simply the present effect of\ndiscrimination that was lawful when it occurred.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You mean there are a lot\nmore suits coming behind this one --\nMR. RUSSELL: Well, I don't think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- for any kind of\ndiscrimination that preceded Title VII? When was Title\nVII enacted?\nMR. RUSSELL: 1964.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There may be still some of\nthose people around.\nMR. RUSSELL: There are. There are, but\nit's very unlikely that there are very many of them\nsubject to this kind of --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, you're scaring me.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. RUSSELL: Well, let me reassure you,\nbecause I think most employers, unlike AT&T, have --\ndon't make those kinds of distinctions with respect to\ntheir employees who were hired before and after the\neffective dates of the relevant provisions of Title VII.\nAnd I think it's --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I take it you are not\nsaying anything that is in effect and is still there,\nyou do retro, you win. I take it -- maybe I am not\nright, but I take it that what -- what the point is here\nis that you -- you took a complicated superstructure of\nrules that was creating boxes and those boxes were\ncreated on the basis of discrimination. Then you move\nit, whole cloth, into the post-new world. And it's the\nadministration of that complicated system of rules that\nwas created out of the discrimination, but it's\nadministration today that makes it like Bazemore.\nMR. RUSSELL: Yes, that's -- that's right.\nThat the present implementation of the system subjects\nit to the present-day requirements of Title VII.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It does that, but what I\ncan't figure out is does that have a lot of implication\nfor other areas or not? And the other thing I'm not\nsure of is how it squares with Ledbetter.\nMR. RUSSELL: Well, the difference between\nLedbetter and this case is Ledbetter involved\ndiscrimination entirely outside of the seniority system,\nand as a result, it didn't -- 706(e)(2) didn't apply;\nthis Court's decision in Lorance didn't apply. And\nCongress enacted this 706(e)(2) to provide a very\nspecial rule to displace the rule of evidence. It was\n-- it was unambiguously intended to displace the rule of\nevidence with respect to intentionally discriminatory\nseniority systems.\nMR. RUSSELL: Evans isn't a problem because\nthe rule they were administering in Evans is whoever is\nhired is in fact hired at low seniority. Now, it's hard\nto say that that's a complicated system of rules that\nhad a pre-existence, even though this individual was\nwhere she was because of that earlier system.\nMR. RUSSELL: Again, I think the distinction\nbetween Evans and this case is discrimination that\noccurred entirely outside of a -- the seniority system\nand discrimination within the seniority system that\ngives unequal credit for equal service. And Congress\nsaid of that kind of discrimination -- we're not going\nto make you challenge immediately. We're going to let\nyou wait until the reduced seniority has a concrete\neffect on your compensation or other terms and\nconditions of employment, and then you can raise it\nthen.\nAnd the underlying thought of the provision\nis that if you are subject to intentional discrimination\nwith respect to seniority accrual, we are going to\nimpute that intent to the subsequent applications of\nthat seniority system when it's applied to injure you.\nAnd if --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I still want to go back to\nassure that I've given you a fair opportunity to answer\nthis. You are relying on Nashville v. Satty, which was\na discriminatory impact case, and now you are arguing\nthat the key is the -- is the intent. Which is it?\nMR. RUSSELL: We make alternative arguments.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Oh, okay.\nMR. RUSSELL: We argue that to the extent it\nmatters whethers this was lawful at the time our clients\ntook their leave, it was not unlawful, and we point to\nSatty. But we say ultimately that doesn't matter\nbecause under section 706(e)(2), so long as they\nimplement, so long as they rely on the diminished\nseniority in the present, that constitutes a present act\nof pregnancy discrimination, intentional pregnancy\ndiscrimination, which is unlawful under the PDA.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, as soon as you get\nback to the intentional, you get away from Satty.\nMR. RUSSELL: Yes, I agree with that.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Oh, okay.\nMR. RUSSELL: But I don't think there can be\nany dispute that when my clients had their seniority\nreduced, it was an act of facial pregnancy\ndiscrimination; and under 702 -- 706(e)(2), that intent\nto discriminate on the basis of pregnancy is --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But it was not unlawful at\nthe time it was done.\nMR. RUSSELL: I do think it was unlawful,\nbut it doesn't matter with respect to 706(e)(2).\nIf I could turn briefly to the retroactivity\nargument: It's important to be clear what the Ninth\nCircuit held and what it didn't hold. It did not hold\nthat AT&T was liable for anything it did prior to the\neffective date of the PDA. It didn't, for example, hold\nthat it was liable simply because it moved the NCS dates\nor because it relied on them in any way before the\neffective date of the PDA. All it said was that AT&T is\nprecluded from relying on that discriminatory measure of\nservice in the future.\nAnd in that sense, this case is quite like\nthis Court's decision in Griggs v. Duke Power Company,\nwhere the Court said Title VII prohibits employers from\nrelying on the results of discriminatory employment\ntests. Now, nobody thought that that meant that Title\nVII subjected to liability employers who administered or\nrelied on those tests before the effective date of Title\nVII, but everybody understood that they couldn't rely on\nthose results after the effective date of Title VII, and\nnobody thought that that gave the statute a retroactive\neffect.\nAnd that's all that the Ninth Circuit\ninterpreted the PDA to do here, is to prohibit AT&T from\nengaging in the post-Act reliance on those pre-Act\ndiscriminatory measures, that AT&T had every opportunity\nto conform its -- to conform its conduct to the -- to\nthe requirements of the PDA, and a statute that simply\ntells an employer how it has to treat past events for\nfuture employment decision purposes is simply not a\nstatute that has a retroactive effect.\nFinally, I'd like to -- if I have time, I'd\nlike to address this suggestion from the Solicitor\nGeneral's Office that this doesn't involve seniority\ndiscrimination at all because what we are talking about\nhere is discrimination that occurred with respect to the\npersonnel policy about the classification of leave, as\nopposed to discrimination within the seniority system\nitself.\nAnd this Court was clear in California\nBrewers that an accrual rule that says how time counts\nfor seniority purposes is part of the seniority system.\nAnd under AT&T's system, it's true you have to apply a\ntwo-part rule. You have to know whether -- if you are\nasked, does this pregnancy leave count, you have to ask,\nwell, is it personal leave? But that doesn't tell you\nanything until you apply the second part of the rule\nthat says pregnancy leave counts as -- as personal\nleave.\nAnd because you need to know the answers to\n-- to both of those questions, both parts of the rules\nare properly considered to be part of the accrual rule\nand part of the seniority system.\nFinally, if I -- if I could return once\nagain to this alternative argument that we have, that\neven setting aside Bazemore and section 706(e)(2), this\nis not -- our clients weren't required to challenge this\ndiscrimination before because it wasn't an completed,\nunlawful employment practice at the time.\nAnd, again, the point is that discrimination\nwith respect to a small amount of time going towards\nseniority doesn't affect even the worker's actual\nseniority, that is, her place in the seniority\nhierarchy. A worker who is 2 years' junior to the\nperson who is next in line above her and 2 years' senior\nto the person next in line below her -- 6 weeks of\nservice credit aren't going to make any difference with\nrespect to her place on the seniority hierarchy. It's\nnot going to make any difference with respect to her\nability to bid for jobs. And it's not necessarily even\ngoing to make any difference with respect to her\npension, because at the time that these leaves are taken\ntypically, the person is years away, perhaps decades\naway, from even vesting in their pension benefit.\nAnd Congress reasonably would have thought,\nI think, that that kind of harm is too speculative to\nwarrant immediate -- to warrant the requirement that the\nemployees have to immediately challenge that kind of\ndiscrimination at the time it occurs. That's why\nCongress enacted section 706(e)(2), to give employees an\nopportunity to wait until the discrimination has a\nconcrete effect on their employment status, on their\ncompensation or terms of employment. And AT&T's view of\nthe statute --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you -- are you making\na claim that they had the choice or that the claim\nwasn't ripe until they felt the impacts of it?\nMR. RUSSELL: I think they don't have a\nchoice. They can't bring the claim until it has a\nconcrete impact.\nNow, if 706(e)(2) applies, they can\nchallenge the system as of -- when it's adopted or when\nit's applied to them, but otherwise they have to wait\nuntil it injures them within the meaning of section\n706(e)(2). And that's a perfectly sensible rule.\nRemember, we're talking here about facial\ndiscrimination, and the concerns about stale evidence\nare not particularly strong here because -- and, as a\nresult, we are able to stipulate to the underlying\nfacts. Everybody knows what the system was and what it\ndid. And there's no reasonable dispute about whether\nthe reduction in our clients' leaves was as a result of\npregnancy versus something else. And in any event, this\nis simply a consequence Congress must have intended when\nit said that discriminatory seniority systems are open\nto challenge whenever they apply to injure a worker,\neven if that means that so long -- if an employer\nimplements a plan for 30 years, Congress understood that\nthat meant that they were subject to suit for 30 years.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nRussell.\nMr. Phillips, 3 minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nI'd just like to make a couple of points:\nJustice Ginsburg, you asked a question about the earlier\nlitigation, and let me just quote from the first page of\nJudge Bright's opinion where it says the appellants in\nthe class action allege that Southwestern Bell\ndiscriminates against women by, quote, \"refusing to\nextend full seniority credit to female employees on\nmaternity leave.\" That is precisely the claim that's\nbeing litigated in this particular case.\nAnd contrary to my brother's position just a\nfew minutes ago, that these don't have any impact and\nwhy would anybody act on the basis of them, it seems to\nme that that lawsuit belies that fact. They recognize\nthe impact on seniority, and they acted immediately as a\nconsequence of that.\nJustice Souter, I do agree with you. I\nthink the reason that Bazemore is not the -- I wouldn't\nsay \"line\" -- more the point of authority to be as the\ndeparture in this particular case is because of the\nimplications for the seniority system.\nJustice Kennedy, the problem here is we\ndon't know exactly what the impact's going to be. What\nwe do know is that all plans are funded on a set of\nactuarial assumptions, and, candidly, if they say we\nwere overfunded a couple months ago, given to what has\nhappened to my pension plans in the last couple of\nmonths, I would worry a little bit about what the\nsituation is.\nBut the -- but the most fundamental point is\nyou don't know. And in that context, what we do\nunderstand is that Congress routinely says protect the\nseniority systems, protect the pension plans. You know,\nmy colleague says, well, but this is all form over\nsubstance because what if they come back at the end and\ndecided to do all these calculations? That\nfundamentally misunderstands the nature of the pension\nprocess. You have to fund these in advance. You make\nactuarial assumptions. No one is in a position where\nthey're going to allow the determination of seniority to\nbe made at the tail end without making assumptions about\nwhat they are going to be like going in.\nAnd, Justice Breyer, I think that is the\nanswer to your question because we are not taking this\ncomplex system wholesale and just dumping it post-PDA.\nWhat we did is we retained the specific rules with\nrespect to the accrual and the seniority, and we\neliminated the underlying distinctions between pregnancy\nand other kinds of disabilities. And that's how we\napply it, and that, frankly, is fundamentally different\nfrom Bazemore because we are not discriminating every\nday in a way that harms them. We made a seniority\ndecision, like a pay decision, pre-Act; now we are\nacting -- it's not a pay decision post-Act. And it's --\nto my mind in that sense it is just like Evans and that\nline of cases.\nFinally, you asked the question, Justice\nSouter, could Congress have done -- have done exactly\nwhat the Respondents ask? And the answer to that is\nyes. Congress could say today we're not going to allow\nthis. It would upset a lot of pension plans. It would\nupset a lot of expectations.\nCongress could have done it. Congress\ndidn't do it, or at least if it were going to upset all\nof those reliance interests, Congress would have done so\nin language that was much more explicit than what it has\ndone in the PDA and 706(e)(2).\nIf there are no further questions, Your\nHonor, I urge you to reverse the judgment below.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nPhillips.\n"
