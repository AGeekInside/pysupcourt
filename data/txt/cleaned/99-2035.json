Leatherman Tool Group.\nMr. Reynolds.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM BRADFORD REYNOLDS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. REYNOLDS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may\nit please the Court:\nThe Court today considers what is the proper\nstandard of review for appellate courts when faced with a\nconstitutional challenge to a punitive damage award as\ngrossly excessive.\nIn the instant case, the Ninth Circuit upheld a\npunitive damage award against Cooper Industries of 4.5\nmillion, which 90 times the $50,000 compensatory award.\nIt did so using an abuse of discretion review standard.\nWe submit that that was error, that the court of appeals\nshould have examined the constitutional excessiveness\nissue independently under a de novo review standard.\nThis Court framed the gross excessiveness\nconstitutional inquiry as it applies to punitive damages\nin BMW v. Gore. It identified there three guideposts for\nmaking what is essentially a comparative analysis, looking\nat the reprehensibility of the offense, the ratio, or\nrelationship of the punitive damages to the compensatory\naward, in order to discern whether the punishment or any\ndiscernible relationship to the offense or was wildly\ndisproportional, and as a third guidepost to look at other\navailable sanctions, whether criminal or civil, that would\nbear on the question of how society generally punishes\nthis sort of offense.\nQUESTION: Mr. Reynolds, when you have a\nstandard, what should I say, so wildly extreme, as wildly\ndisproportionate, does it make any difference -- does it\nreally -- do you really think it makes any difference\nwhether you're reviewing the lower court for a -- de novo,\nor for abuse of discretion?\nI mean, the question is whether the court abused\nits discretion in not considering this wildly\ndisproportionate. Does that really boil down to any\ndifference for -- between whether it is wildly\ndisproportionate -- I just find it hard to imagine a\nsituation in which I would be reviewing a district judge\nfor abuse of discretion, and would find that it is -- that\nit is an abuse of discretion, where I wouldn't also find\nthat it was wildly disproportionate.\nMR. REYNOLDS: Well, Your Honor, I think that\nyou certainly could come to the same conclusion under both\nstandards, but the --\nQUESTION: Well, the point is, wouldn't you\nalmost -- wouldn't you virtually always come to the same\nconclusion under both standards?\nMR. REYNOLDS: I don't know that you would, and\nI think that the reason de novo review is important is\nthat you have a legal issue here. You have one that\nimplicates a constitutional right. It is, I think\nadmittedly, bottomed on guideposts that are fluid\nconcepts, and there's a need to have some kind of a\ncoherent doctrine that develops so as to have a uniform\napplication of the substantive standards.\nQUESTION: Well, do you have much doubt, Mr.\nReynolds, that if the standard is de novo review, there\nwill be more determinations of lower -- of the district\ncourt, trial court upset than if there's abuse of\ndiscretion review?\nMR. REYNOLDS: I believe there probably would be\nmore awards that would be upset, or there would be more\nremittitur decisions.\nQUESTION: More law would develop in the courts\nof appeals, presumably.\nMR. REYNOLDS: That's exactly the point I was\ntrying to make, that I do think that you would get a more\ncoherent body of law. You would be able to better\ndetermine how to apply the standard, and it would be\napplied in a way that would be more uniform, and I think\none of the objectives of the due process protection is\nthat people who are similarly situated be treated the same\nway for --\nQUESTION: Mr. Reynolds, is this a mixed\nquestion of fact and law that we're talking about?\nMR. REYNOLDS: Justice O'Connor, I think that it\ncould be characterized as a mixed question of fact and law\nin that, as I understand what that means, it means that if\nyou have established facts, and you're applying a legal\nprinciple to those facts, that would be a mixed question\nof fact and law.\nQUESTION: For instance, in the first prong, the\nreprehensible conduct, presumably a review of the facts is\nincluded in the appellate review, so you do seem to have a\nmixed standard --\nMR. REYNOLDS: Well, to some --\nQUESTION: -- mixed question.\nMR. REYNOLDS: Excuse me, Your Honor.\nTo some extent I think I would agree with you.\nIt does seem to me that what we're talking about here in\nde novo review is the same thing that the Court does\ntraditionally. As to historical facts, the Court accords\ndeferential review, and we don't suggest there would be\nany difference as to that.\nBut when you get to the legal issue of where you\ncross the constitutional line, and you start looking at it\nin a comparative analysis, which really is looking at\nextrinsic facts that are outside the record, that's where\nthe legal inquiry comes in and de novo review would be\nrequired.\nQUESTION: On the reprehensibility of the\nconduct, do you envisage that if you prevail the circuit\ncourt will have some sort of standards for\nreprehensibility, or how will it go about writing this?\nMR. REYNOLDS: Well --\nQUESTION: I could see if it was abuse of\ndiscretion, I can hear the circuit court saying, well,\ntrial judges see the witness, and they heard the whole\ntrial, and they're in the position to make this judgment,\nand we're not going to second-guess them. That's what\nwould happen under the abuse of discretion standard in all\nlikelihood.\nWhat would the circuit court do with this first\nprong that Justice O'Connor mentioned, reprehensibility?\nMR. REYNOLDS: I --\nQUESTION: Under your view?\nMR. REYNOLDS: As I understand it, Your Honor,\nthe court of appeals would basically take the conduct and,\non the established record, that would be the baseline, if\nyou will, for its comparative analysis under the Gore\nfactors. You would have to look at where that conduct\nfits on a continuum of blameworthiness, if you will, and\nthat would be essentially a legal question.\nWhat you're doing is very much, it seems to me,\nYour Honor, what you do under the de novo review standard\nthat this Court announced in Bajakajian, I believe is how\nyou pronounce it.\nQUESTION: Mr. Reynolds, may I interrupt you at\nthat point, because what you described sounded very much\nto me like what a jury does when it's choosing among\nnegligence degrees of culpability, negligence, gross\nnegligence, recklessness. Those are quintessentially jury\ndecisions, and they're not reviewed de novo by any judge,\nnot the trial judge, not the court of appeals, so why\nisn't the degree of reprehensibility exactly the same?\nMR. REYNOLDS: Well, Your Honor, here the -- we\nare over a threshold of malice that is necessary in order\nto award a punitive award.\nQUESTION: Just like you would be over a\nthreshold if you decide there's negligence. Then, if\nthere's negligence, then there would be recovery, but\nthere might be greater recovery if you had a higher\nstandard.\nMR. REYNOLDS: Right, but I think what the\nCourt has said in BMW v. Gore is that you are going to\ndetermine whether or not the punishment that is imposed\nhere is reasonably related to the crime, and whether it\nrationally serves the interest of punishment and\ndeterrence, and that is an analysis, a legal analysis that\nlooks to this conduct as compared to similar conduct and\nthe way in which that has been treated in the punishment\narena, and in other situations.\nQUESTION: Could you describe the precise test\nthat the court of appeals would be applying under your\nstandard as compared with the precise test that would\napply under an arbitrary and capricious standard?\nIt seems to me the substantive question, which\nthey would apply on de novo, is whether any reasonable\nperson could possibly consider this proportionate. Isn't\nthat the test? It has to be wildly disproportionate. I\nassume that means no reasonable person could consider it\nproportionate, right?\nMR. REYNOLDS: I think that that would --\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. REYNOLDS: I don't quarrel with that, Your\nHonor.\nQUESTION: Now, if you're using an abuse of\ndiscretion standard, you would be asking whether any\nreasonable judge, whether no reasonable judge could think\nthat any reasonable person would consider this\nproportionate. You're sure that the two questions don't\nboil down to the same thing?\nMR. REYNOLDS: Well, Your Honor, I --\nQUESTION: I -- it's just too subtle for me to\nunderstand the difference between the two.\nMR. REYNOLDS: I think that there is a\nsubstantive standard that has been announced as being\napplicable in BMW v. Gore, and we're not going back and\nsuggesting we revisit that. What we're saying is that it\nought to get meaningful application, it ought to be\napplied so as to allow the courts to give some content to\nit and through cases to come to a more clear understanding\nof exactly how it applies in different cases.\nIt is, I believe, clear, and I agree with the\nChief Justice, that the de novo standard would allow\ncourts of appeals, who believe that this was\ndisproportionate punishment, it would allow them to apply\na remittitur when, under the abuse of discretion standard,\nthey would feel that they were not compelled to.\nQUESTION: I understand that, but it seems to me\nthat whenever a court of appeals finds that no reasonable\nperson could possibly consider this proportionate, so it\nis wildly disproportionate, it would automatically find\nthat no reasonable judge could have thought that a\nreasonable person would find this proportionate. I don't\nknow whether you can find one finding --\nMR. REYNOLDS: Yes, Your Honor. I don't\ndisagree --\nQUESTION: -- without automatically making the\nother one, so what are we arguing about?\nMR. REYNOLDS: I don't disagree that where you\nhave a punitive award that is so over the line that\neverybody agrees that it would be unconstitutional, that\nwhichever standard you apply would probably give you the\nsame result. You're going to have a lot of cases where\nyou're not talking about something that is so over the\nline.\nI happen to believe this case is one that is so\nover the line, and the point is that you've got a legal\nquestion, it's got a constitutional dimension, you've got\na standard that is not one that is dependent upon looking\nat the historical facts and second-guessing them, and\nthat, I believe, dictates that you look for de novo review\nand independent review by the courts of appeals.\nQUESTION: Whatever word you use to describe it,\nI take it that what you're essentially asking is to have\nthe judge, as a panel of three judges, sit as though they\nwere jurors, as though they were jurors making a\ndetermination of reprehensibility.\nMR. REYNOLDS: As though they were jurors in\nmaking the policy judgment as to what the appropriate\npunishment is in order to fulfill the goals of deterrence\nand retribution.\nQUESTION: And then if we go back in history,\npunitive damages, I believe, was considered in the\nbailiwick of the jury, and not the judge. In fact, there\nwas a question whether any judge, even the trial judge,\ncould overturn the jury's verdict, is that not so?\nMR. REYNOLDS: Well, I believe it's clear that\nyou could have a court overturn a verdict if, indeed, it\nwas a verdict that was outrageously excessive, or, as they\nsaid in the early cases, driven by juror bias or passion,\nand was not proportional to the offense, and I believe the\ncommon law, as well as the early American law, has said\nthat punitive damages would certainly be reviewable in\nthat regard, as would compensatory, so I think --\nQUESTION: Mr. Reynolds --\nMR. REYNOLDS: -- appellate review is available.\nQUESTION: I'm not certain of that, and I think\nthat, at least as to compensatory damages, there was some\ndisagreement on this Court whether there was any allowance\nof --\nMR. REYNOLDS: Right.\nQUESTION: -- appellate review at all. Justice\nScalia and I differed on that --\nMR. REYNOLDS: I understand --\nQUESTION: -- on that question.\nMR. REYNOLDS: -- but I believe in Gasperini\nyou said that there was appellate review.\nQUESTION: Would you argue, Mr. Reynolds,\ndifferent principles to -- and different propositions to\nthe circuit court than you would to the jury, or do you\njust argue the same thing?\nMR. REYNOLDS: I think that the -- well, the\narguments to the jury in this regard would depend in large\npart on the instructions that were given to the jury, and\nI think there are some instructions that would be very\nproblematic to give the jury in terms of the BMW v. Gore\nguideposts, so --\nQUESTION: Mr. --\nQUESTION: So that the court of appeals --\nMR. REYNOLDS: -- I don't think the jury would\nhave the same --\nQUESTION: -- does consider different\npropositions, i.e., comparative awards and similar cases\nin other parts of the country, or something like that?\nMR. REYNOLDS: I think that's right. I think\nthat the -- what happens is, this is a check on the\nexcesses of the jury determination with regard to\npunishment, and it is a test, as I understand BMW v. Gore,\nthat says that we're going to look at what the jury did in\nthis case in order to serve society's interest in\npunishment and deterrence, and to see whether that is out\nof line, constitutionally out of line, with the punishment\nthat is visited for similarly-situated people who commit\nsimilar offenses.\nQUESTION: Mr. Reynolds --\nMR. REYNOLDS: It is a check, if you will, at\nthe appellate level on the jury judgment call.\nQUESTION: So if that's true, then Justice\nScalia's proposition that no reasonable juror could find\nthe award doesn't quite work, because you're putting forth\ndifferent contentions to the two different bodies.\nYou're putting one case to the court of appeals, and\nanother to the jury, i.e. --\nMR. REYNOLDS: I --\nQUESTION: -- that this is inconsistent with\nwhat other juries and judges have done around the country\nand therefore just doesn't meet the standard of\nproportionality under some Nation-wide proportionality\nstandard that the jury didn't hear about, or is the answer\nthat the jury can hear about this stuff?\nMR. REYNOLDS: I think that certainly there are\nspecial instructions that could help to inform the jury's\ndecision that we would not be at all adverse to giving.\nI understood Justice Scalia's question to be\nwhere the court of appeals was looking to see whether the\npunitive award was reasonable amount and rational in terms\nof the purposes that it was intended to serve, and I\nthink --\nQUESTION: Mr. Reynolds, you're looking over one\nimportant player. It's not jury versus court of appeals\nmaking this decision. The court of appeals doesn't get\ninto the picture until a district judge, the trial judge,\nso it would be de novo review not of the jury's\nassessment, but of the trial judge's refusal to tamper\nwith the jury's verdict, so isn't it -- the court of\nappeals is reviewing not the jury's action but the trial\ncourt's action, isn't that so?\nMR. REYNOLDS: That's correct, and I think that\nas we were saying, Justice Ginsburg, the court of appeals\nwould, in that instance, do the traditional deferential\nreview of the historical facts, or the fact questions, but\nas to this legal question it would be a de novo review.\nQUESTION: Mr. Reynolds, let me ask you if I am\nunderstanding your argument correctly in this respect. I\nthink you're making two different kinds of arguments for\nthe value of the de novo review.\nThe first argument is simply that de novo review\non its own merits is the better review here. The second\nargument is sort of a practical one, that if all you have\nis abuse of discretion review of what the trial judge does\nwhen the trial judge reviews the jury verdict, you're not\ngoing to have very many appellate cases, and you're\ncertainly not going to have many appellate cases with\nexhaustive discussions of the way jury verdicts ought to\nbe examined.\nAnd I think you're saying that if you have de\nnovo review, you're simply going to have more\narticulations by appellate courts of the way trial courts\nought to look at jury verdicts, and if you are making the\nsecond argument, I suppose you're making -- you're saying\nwhat ought to happen in the development of the review of\npunitive damages is the same thing that I think happened\nback in the old days on the review of jury verdicts of\nnegligence.\nIf you go back in the law reports to the\ntwenties and the thirties when negligence law was\ndeveloping, you find exhaustive appellate discussions of\nwhether, you know, the train was close enough to the\nintersection for the driver to have been negligent in\ngoing out on the track, and so on, and I think you're\narguing for a sort of parallel between punitive damages\ndevelopment and maybe the old negligence law development,\nin that you're saying each one would profit greatly by\nhaving plenary treatment in appellate courts. Is that a\nfair --\nMR. REYNOLDS: That is fair, Justice Breyer. I\ndo think that. I think that the two arguments go hand-\nin-hand. In other words, I --\nQUESTION: I agree. I agree.\nMR. REYNOLDS: My argument that the de novo\nreview is in and of itself --\nQUESTION: But the value is not only in the\nsubstantive standard, the value is in the application of\nthat standard in sort of developed appellate discussions.\nMR. REYNOLDS: I think that's right, especially\nin light of the recent decision in BMW v. Gore.\nQUESTION: May I ask you a question, Mr.\nReynolds? You indicated that you thought the court of\nappeals would decide what the appropriate award was. I'm\nnot sure that's right. It seems to me that the court of\nappeals decides what is the limit on appropriate awards,\nand anything over whatever the ceiling is would be\ninappropriate.\nIs it your view that if there is a reversal or\nremand in the case, that the instruction should always be\nto enter judgment for the amount that would be the maximum\nconstitutionally-permissible award, or would it be to send\nit back and say to the lower court, you got the range\nwrong, instead of being 1 million to 10 million, it's\n500,000 to 2 million, and you can start over again and put\nthe new award within the permissible constitutional range?\nWhich way -- what are you suggesting?\nMR. REYNOLDS: I know you're not going to like\nthis answer, because I think that what I would say is, the\ncourt of appeals probably could take either approach.\nIf the court of appeals viewed the award as\nconstitutionally excessive, there is authority that\nsuggests that the court of appeals could set what would be\nthe maximum allowable award constitutionally, on its own.\nI think there is also the ability of the court\nof appeals to do a remand, and to have the district court\nperform that, so I'm not sure that --\nQUESTION: Mr. Reynolds, is it settled --\nMR. REYNOLDS: -- I have a specific response one\nway or the other on that.\nQUESTION: Is it settled that a court of appeals\ncould order a remittitur? I didn't know that that was a\nsettled question.\nMR. REYNOLDS: I --\nQUESTION: I thought that was an open question.\nMR. REYNOLDS: Well, I -- as I said to Justice\nStevens, I'm not sure I can say it's settled, so I think\nthat my sense is that they could do either one.\nThe Eleventh Circuit has in the Johannes case\nordered the remittitur at the maximum allowable rate\nconstitutionally, or amount constitutionally. the Tenth\nCircuit in Oxy Products on the other hand did not do that,\nand said it had to be something that was sent back, so --\nQUESTION: But we -- this Court has never ruled\non that question --\nMR. REYNOLDS: No.\nQUESTION: -- and it's in the background. That\nquestion comes up in the background of the Seventh\nAmendment in the Reexamination Clause, doesn't it, whether\nthe court of appeals can --\nMR. REYNOLDS: Well --\nQUESTION: Can instruct the entry of a final\njudgment that's different from the number that the jury\ncame in?\nMR. REYNOLDS: Your Honor, I think that the\nSeventh Amendment Reexamination Clause would not inhibit a\ncourt of appeals from directing the maximum amount, and I\nsay that because we're in an area where we aren't\nconcerned with facts tried to the jury. We're in an area\nwhere we have a legal question, where the jury has made a\npublic policy judgment call on the punishment, and what\nthe court of appeals would be saying is that the -- that a\njury could not have imposed a punishment in excess of\nwhatever that amount is, not constitutionally.\nQUESTION: Mr. Reynolds, this problem exists no\nmatter how we come out in this case, doesn't it?\nMR. REYNOLDS: I --\nQUESTION: What relevance does this have to this\ncase? I mean, this is going to be a problem whether the\nreview is de novo, or whether the review is for abuse of\ndiscretion, and we -- it seems to me we shouldn't find for\nor against you on the basis of how we feel on this point,\nisn't that right?\nMR. REYNOLDS: I think that you would have the\nsame --\nQUESTION: I mean, whatever standard you're\ngoing to use, if you decide that the district court got it\nwrong, you're going to be confronted with this issue --\nMR. REYNOLDS: I --\nQUESTION: -- so it seems to me it has nothing\nto do with what we're wrestling with, but what I would\nlike to know is why you think that a court of appeals\nwould not be developing law if it's only applying the\nabuse of discretion standard. Doesn't it have to come out\nwith a written opinion --\nMR. REYNOLDS: I would --\nQUESTION: -- and the written opinion would\nsay, you know, no reasonable judge could consider that\nthis was not wildly disproportionate? It would make a lot\nof law, it seems to me.\nMR. REYNOLDS: I believe the kind of opinion\nyou're likely to get is what we got in this case, where\nthe Ninth Circuit simply says they do not believe that the\ndistrict court abused discretion, and it would not provide\nany enlightenment, or any kind of coherent -- doctrinal\ncoherence to the BMW v. Gore factors in an application of\nthat.\nQUESTION: So what you want is not -- I mean, I\ncan't -- I'm having trouble seeing what the difference is\nbetween the standards. Like a lot of other things, the\nanswer seems to be, it depends on what's at issue in the\nparticular case. This is a Federal case.\nMR. REYNOLDS: This is a Federal case.\nQUESTION: So they're already reviewing for\nabuse of discretion under Rule 59 the decision not to give\na new trial on the issue.\nMR. REYNOLDS: That's correct.\nQUESTION: All right. So inevitably you're\nsaying, you have to review this for abuse of discretion at\nleast there, and now we get into the constitutional area,\nso it must be, you know, sort of beyond that, and there\nare certain things, reprehensibility or harm, you'd say,\nlook, judge, remember, the district court judge saw this\nand you didn't, and take that into account.\nNow, when you get into the comparison of other\npenalties, as to that, I don't see why the district judge\nwould be in a superior position at all. The judge would\nbe in a superior position to decide how reprehensible this\nperson's behavior was, and how harmful it was to this\nplaintiff, but then once we get the outer limits of that,\nthe appellate judge on his own applies the constitutional\nstandard as an element of deference, and there's a big\nelement of no deference. I mean, what can you say beyond\nthat, and then beyond that, the words de novo and abuse of\ndiscretion become slogans.\nMR. REYNOLDS: I --\nQUESTION: The people who want a tough review\nsay, de novo, the people who want a weak review say, abuse\nof discretion, but those are slogans. In terms of how the\njudge should act, is it as I described?\nMR. REYNOLDS: I think as the judge would act it\nis as you describe, but I do think it certainly does make\na difference what standard you are imposing.\nQUESTION: Well, all right. Leaving the slogan\nout of it, how do you -- if what we want to have happen --\nand I'm not sure there's a disagreement between the two\nsides on it. I'll find out -- what form of words do we\nuse to get that to happen? I mean, it's like be a judge.\nMR. REYNOLDS: Well --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. REYNOLDS: -- that would certainly be a good\nbeginning.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. REYNOLDS: I think that what you would be\nlooking at is the kind of standard that you imposed, that\nwas imposed in the, I go back to the Bajakajian -- I\ncannot pronounce that -- Bajakajian case, where the Court\nhad the excessiveness issue in the context of a fine and\nthe Eighth Amendment and said de novo review was the\nappropriate review to determine disproportionality, and\nwent through a not dissimilar kind of an inquiry that BMW\nv. Gore laid out.\nAnd I believe that the de novo standard would\nrequire the kind of demanding or exacting review of those\nguideposts in a way that would be much more rigid and\ndecipherable, if you will, and understandable, than if you\nhad just an abuse of discretion review and, because it's a\ndue process right, and it's bottomed on the interest of\npeople being treated who are similarly situated in\nuniform -- uniformly in a similarly situated way, there is\nmuch to recommend that you go to the de novo standard that\nwill, over time, I think, help to develop a much more\narticulate and coherent line of inquiry for applying the\nGore standards.\nQUESTION: Isn't it always an abuse of\ndiscretion when the trial court makes an error of law?\nMR. REYNOLDS: I think when the trial court\nmakes an error of law, that it would certainly be an abuse\nof discretion, but I also would say that I think the\nstandard we use here is one that is compelled by the\nnature of the inquiry and the fact that it's\nconstitutional, and by the Gore guideposts, and the\ncomparative analysis which are extrinsic to the\nhistorical fact record, and that's what requires that\nthere be a de novo review.\nI'll save the rest of my time for rebuttal, Mr.\nChief Justice.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Reynolds.\nMr. Massey, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN S. MASSEY\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. MASSEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nWe urge an abuse of discretion standard for two\nprincipal reasons. First, there's the historical\ntradition under which punitive damages were largely\ncommitted to the jury with quite limited appellate review,\nthe second reason is the pragmatic argument for abuse of\ndiscretion standard. As Justice O'Connor and Justice\nKennedy have recognized, the Gore guideposts are intensely\nfact-specific, reprehensibility perhaps most of all and,\nas this Court noted in Gore, reprehensibility is perhaps\nthe most important indicator of the reasonableness of an\naward.\nAlso --\nQUESTION: What do we do generally, if you look\nat our precedents, on mixed questions of fact and law on\nappellate review?\nYou see some statements that it's de novo\nreview. What's the closest analogy, do you suppose?\nMR. MASSEY: Well, we believe that\nreasonableness is maybe a close analogy, because the\ntouchstone of excessiveness is, of course, reasonableness,\nand it is the sort of grossly excessive standard that\nJustice Scalia has referred to, and in many contexts\nreasonableness --\nQUESTION: Well, but there is more than one\nquestion under the Gore standard, in addition to\nreprehensibility, the ratio between compensatory and\npunitive damages awarded, and how the award compares to\nother sanctions available for comparable misconduct.\nThose latter two seem closer to pure questions of law, in\na sense. What has this Court historically done, do you\nthink, on appellate review standard for mixed questions of\nfact and law?\nMR. MASSEY: Well, it's done both, Your Honor.\nI mean, Pullman standard against Swint is a case noting\nthe difficulty of precise categorizations, but in the\ncontext of reasonableness, Cooter and Gell, for example,\nthe reasonableness of Rule 11, the Pierce v. Underwood,\nthe reasonableness of a -- of the legal position taken by\nthe Government in equal-access-to-justice cases.\nCooter and Gell is notable because it discussed\nhow negligence has been traditionally reviewed very\ndeferentially under an -- essentially an abuse of\ndiscretion standard, so I think Justice Souter's concern\nabout the development of the law can be fully addressed\nthrough an abuse of discretion standard, and that --\nQUESTION: I couldn't find any except the\nones -- I just had to look this up for another reason, and\nJustice Ginsburg has a couple in an opinion she wrote, but\nthe case -- I mean, this seems not a question of mixed\nfact and law, but up to a certain point you decide what\nthe facts are. Now, once the facts are there, it's purely\na question of applying the legal label, and so the real\nquestion is, under what circumstances does a court of\nappeals defer, where all that's happened is the trial\njudge is applying the legal label to a set of undisputed\nfacts.\nNow, until we get to the point of dispute, I'll\ngive you all the discretion you want, but once we're in\nthe nondisputed area, at that point, the only two I could\nfind were the ones you mentioned. There was a Rule 11\ncase, and she had both, and there was question involving\ncompetence of witnesses or something, competence -- there\nwas a competence thing. I can see it on the page. You\nknow what I'm talking about?\nMR. MASSEY: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: All right.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: I couldn't find any other than that.\nMR. MASSEY: Well, it's -- yes. We agree that\nthe very last step of the analysis has a strongly legal\nflavor to it, but --\nQUESTION: Strongly legal -- it isn't a question\nof degree. It is a question of black and white. The\nquestion of applying a legal label to a set of undisputed\nfacts is a question of law.\nNow, you can give as much weight as you want to\nthe judge before you decide what the nondisputed area is,\nso I'll give you all that. Now, I say, defer, defer,\ndefer, as long as there's any factual matter in dispute.\nAt that point, we reach the area where there's none. Now,\nall we're doing is applying the legal label. Now, on that\none, is there anything other than what Justice Ginsburg\nhad in her opinion?\nMR. MASSEY: There's Gasperini, Your Honor,\nwhich involved a New York statute which did not simply\ndirect district courts to review the historical facts\nunderlying a compensatory award, but instructed them to\nengage in a comparative analysis, an essentially legal\nanalysis of this compensatory award versus other\ncompensatory awards in New York to see if they were\ncomparable.\nQUESTION: In fact, they gave that instruction\nto the appellate courts, and this Court said, because of\nthe Seventh Amendment, that job -- the only judge\npositioned to do it in the Federal courts would be the\ndistrict courts.\nMR. MASSEY: Exactly, Your Honor, and that was\nessentially a legal inquiry, but this Court said the court\nof appeals was constrained --\nQUESTION: Oh, but then that's exactly the\nquestion, because I'd say, I don't see any reason why,\nonce we're in the area of undisputed fact, why there's any\nreason that a court of appeals here should defer one\nlittle bit, any more than it does with any other standard\nof law, except with a very few exceptions.\nMR. MASSEY: Well, as Justice Scalia noted, the\nquestion of whether a mistake of law has been made is an\nautomatic abuse of discretion, if there hasn't been a\nmistake, so traditionally this label of abuse of\ndiscretion has been used, even though before Gore, even\nunder State law excessiveness standards, there was always\nthe last step of applying the law to the facts in the\ncourt of appeals.\nIn other words, consider a State which has\ncodified standards for excessiveness of damages, as some\nStates have, like Texas, for example. That -- the\ndistrict judge has no discretion whether to apply those\nstatutory criteria. He has no limited right to be wrong,\nin Judge Friendly's terms. That's a pure issue of law in\nthe last step, yet the standard of review has always been\nabuse of discretion.\nQUESTION: I think the Ornelas case from our\nCourt is against your position to a certain extent. You\nsay that the BMW standards are very fact-specific.\nOrnelas involved a Fourth Amendment question, which is\nclassically fact-specific --\nMR. MASSEY: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- and yet we held there that the\nreview was de novo and not abuse of discretion.\nMR. MASSEY: Yes, Your Honor, you did. We\nbelieve that case is not controlling, because first there\nwere separate interests there, a need for a national\nstandards of law enforcement, and other reasons that the\nCourt noted. In particular --\nQUESTION: Well, but if BMW v. Gore announces a\nconstitutional rule, presumably there's a need for\nnational standards there, just as surely as with the\nFourth Amendment.\nMR. MASSEY: Well, Your Honor, we think, though,\nthat a district court review would be the best way to\npromote uniformity in the context of punitive damages,\nbecause --\nQUESTION: Well, though, you could have said the\nsame thing about Ornelas.\nMR. MASSEY: Well, this Court did note in\nOrnelas the importance of deferring to local courts and\nlaw enforcement officials on the questions underlying the\njudgments of reasonable suspicion --\nQUESTION: As a part of de novo review.\nMR. MASSEY: Yes, Your Honor. You're correct\nabout Ornelas. That doesn't involve the jury context and\nthe tradition of appellate review in punitive damages\ncases, but you're right that -- of course, you did also\nwrite, though, Ohio v. Robinette, which was a Fourth\nAmendment voluntariness of consent to search.\nQUESTION: I don't cite Ornelas just because I\nwrote it.\nMR. MASSEY: No, I understand.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. MASSEY: I understand, Mr. Chief Justice. I\nunderstand, but the Robinette case is a case where you\nnoted that the fact-specific nature of reasonableness made\nbright line rules inappropriate, and you recognized the\nneed to defer to the sort of close people who were closer\non the facts and on the scene.\nBut let me just circle back for a moment,\nbecause the Rule 59 context, and motions for remittiturs,\nthose have always been judged by an abuse of discretion\nstandard, and that, of course, is where constitutional\nexcessiveness challenges are ordinarily raised. There's\nquite a logic to the Cooter and Gell position that we\nought to have a unitary standard of review in this area\nbecause the Rule 59 context, as Justice Breyer mentioned,\nwill require the district judge to apply sometimes the\nvery same standards as are in Gore to the judgment under\nState law requirements.\nThe third -- the second and third Gore\nguideposts have been tossed out as being primarily legal,\nbut that's not always true. The second guidepost involves\nactual harm as well as potential harm. Gore noted that\nwhether a high ratio is permissible because of a\nparticularly egregious act might have resulted only in a\nsmall number of damages. In other words, there are a\nnumber of difficult factual questions associated with each\nof these guideposts.\nQUESTION: Well, the difference with 59, I\nthought, look, BMW is -- governs quite extreme cases, you\nknow, and if you say, look, judge, you have a lot of\ndiscretion under 59, and you have a lot of discretion to\ndecide how egregious something is, and you have\nreprehensibility, and how much harm, and all those things.\nNow you give him discretion on discretion, then\nyou say at this last step, where you're also applying this\nlegal label that only applies to extreme cases, you're\nsaying, and now there's some more discretion even in that,\nyou don't have much of a rule left.\nMR. MASSEY: Well, Your Honor, if we think that\nyou will -- I mean, Justice Souter's concern that the law\nbe developed in this area we think can be fully\naccommodated by abuse of discretion.\nThe General Dynamics amicus brief, and the brief\nsubmitted by General Dellinger in this case, both discuss\na lot of studies that have been done and cases that have\nbeen decided since BMW v. Gore. One striking thing is the\nrole of courts under an abuse of discretion standard in\nstriking down punitive damages. There are about six\nstudies discussed, the GAO study, Rand, Michael --\nQUESTION: Are these studies of what trial\njudges have done in reviewing, or are they studies about\nwhat appellate courts have done in reviewing trial judges?\nMR. MASSEY: Both, Your Honor. Both. In -- the\ntotal of both trial and appellate together is -- the range\nof reversal goes from 54 to 70 percent. If you want to\nlook just at appellate courts applying abuse of\ndiscretion, I believe there are numerous cases in the\nGeneral Dynamics brief.\nParticularly, there's a case called Kim, one\ncalled Kimzey, there's an Aetna Life case from the Ninth\nCircuit, so I don't believe -- the abuse of discretion\nstandard is not a toothless standard. As this Court noted\nin U.S. v. Taylor, which was a 1980 Speedy Trial Act case\nwhich reversed the dismissal of a case under the Speedy\nTrial Act, this Court described abuse of discretion as\npermitting thorough appellate review, so we don't share\nthe view --\nQUESTION: Well, but it's thorough appellate\nreview -- you say it's not a toothless standard, but I\nmean, his argument is that his teeth are very far apart,\nand a lot is going to get through, and sure, there are\nsome teeth, but -- I mean, I -- it seems to me that your\nbrother's argument is -- does not depend, perhaps, on\nexact parsing of the difference between applying de novo\nand abuse so much as it does in emphasizing that if you're\ngoing to have de novo review it's going to be a more\naggressive review, and it's going to be a more articulate\nreview, and doesn't he make sensible points in that\nrespect?\nMR. MASSEY: Well, perhaps superficially, but I\nreally -- but we believe that, for example, the practical\nresult of telling courts of appeals that they have to\nreview de novo long, burdensome records might be actually\nto reduce the amount of time they have --\nQUESTION: Yes, but I mean, you've just been\ntelling us that they're going to review carefully on abuse\nof discretion, and I suppose they're going to have to look\nat long, burdensome records there, aren't they?\nMR. MASSEY: Well, we believe that in a case\ninvolving -- the headline cases we see in the papers about\nbig, punitive awards can be addressed fully by an abuse of\ndiscretion standard.\nWhat's going to happen in the run-of-the-mill\ncases, where the result is actually reasonable and falls\nwithin what this Court described in Gore as the zone of\nreasonableness, those cases are going to occupy a\ntremendous amount of appellate resources without many\ndifferences in result, and the result of the whole process\nmay be more unpublished opinions in punitive damages cases\nbecause the courts of appeals are busy reading records in\ncases where the abuse of discretion standard would have\nthe same outcome.\nSo we -- as a practical matter, Rule 59 is a\nfamiliar standard. The abuse of discretion review has\ngrown up, not just under Gore, but under the State law\nexcessiveness standards which courts have always applied\nhistorically, even though the last step of applying any of\nthese standards could be described as a purely legal\nissue.\nQUESTION: Well, that's -- Mr. Massey, the point\nthat I'm having difficulty with, and I think Justice\nO'Connor raised it first, there's one of these standards,\nreprehensibility, degree of reprehensibility that sounds\nlike even at the last step. It's a judgment call that the\njury makes, just as I described gross negligence and\nrecklessness. I don't really see the difference.\nBut the other two standards, the seriousness of\nthe injury and the comparable awards in other cases, that\nthe jury isn't so well-equipped to deal with, and you can\nsay this is law applied to historic facts.\nMR. MASSEY: Well, sometimes it is, Your Honor.\nSometimes those -- I mean, the second guidepost is almost\nalways part of the jury charge. The third guidepost is a\npart of the jury charge in some places. It wasn't in this\ncase -- well, there is an Oregon statute that instructs\njuries on the criminal and legislative sanctions which\ncould be applied, but even those guideposts will be very\nfactual.\nFor example, the Cooper brief in this very case,\nthe reply brief, leads off with three pages of factual\nargument about potential harm and reprehensibility and the\nlegislative sanctions, so even at this level there's still\nfactual disagreement about how to apply this.\nQUESTION: Well then, you have to take the facts\nas the plaintiff states them. I mean, normally, these\ntrials, you take the facts as the plaintiff states them,\nthen the defense comes along on appeal and says, well, you\ncan't take that, because there's no support for that, but\nyou're going to have to do that anyway in any appeal, and\nso -- but you read it with an eye favorably towards the\nside that won, you know, and there's always an argument\nyou can't read it that favorably, but that's going to be\ntrue no matter what standard you have.\nBut having done that, I don't see what's left\nthat's so tough for the appellate judge to do.\nMR. MASSEY: Well, Your Honor, in resolving the\nparties' disputes about what reasonable inferences are\npossible --\nQUESTION: No, I'm saying that that kind of\nthing --\nMR. MASSEY: I --\nQUESTION: -- is true in every trial, every\nappeal. They're always arguing about that sort of stuff,\nand that's true whether punitive damages are at stake or\nnot, and that's true -- you know, I mean, you get an\nappeal, there are dozens of arguments like that from a\ncomplicated trial, so we always go through that. I know\nhow to do it. I mean, I might not do it brilliantly, but\nI try, and what you do is, you read it with an eye\nfavorably towards the side that won.\nNow, that's true regardless. Now I'm looking at\nthe stage beyond that, and once you're beyond that, I\ndon't see that it's so tough for a -- you know, it isn't\ntoo complicated. You now know what your facts are. So\nit's at that point that I -- and I don't know how to write\nit to get this -- I don't -- I see where -- you see, I\nneed -- I don't think you disagree that much with it, but\nI'm not sure.\nMR. MASSEY: Well, I don't -- I agree -- I don't\nthink we disagree that much. We think an abuse of\ndiscretion label for the analysis, though, is more\nappropriate, because that's -- in all the cases that\nyou've reviewed you've mostly been applying discretion\nunder Rule 59. It's not -- perhaps in many cases you\ncould say that courts of appeals are --\nQUESTION: Does the court of appeals apply an\nabuse of discretion standard when it's reviewing the\ndecision of a trial court under Rule 59?\nMR. MASSEY: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And does one of our cases stand for\nthat proposition?\nMR. MASSEY: I -- this Court's cases -- yes.\nIt's sort of accepted, that's the accepted standard under\nthe -- as in the Tri-Counties case that you heard earlier,\nthat was the thing that Justice Breyer --\nQUESTION: Which we dismissed as improvidently\ngranted --\nMR. MASSEY: Yes, Your Honor. No, I'm not\nciting that case as precedent.\nQUESTION: -- because we thought it was an open\nquestion.\nMR. MASSEY: Right. Well, that's a --\nQUESTION: How about Gasperini? Gasperini said\nthat the standard for the appellate court vis-a-vis the\ntrial court --\nMR. MASSEY: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- on compensatory damages is abuse\nof discretion, and that was a majority opinion --\nMR. MASSEY: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- of this Court.\nMR. MASSEY: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Isn't the difference between the Rule\n59 situation a sort of precedent for what we should do\nhere, in the situation we've got here, something like\nthis:\nRule 59 motions are reviewing, sort of, or are\nintended to review what are claimed to be specific\nmistakes and problems in individual cases, but what we're\ndealing with here is regarded somehow as a more serious\nand a more intractable problem than what Rule 59\naddresses, and therefore the argument is, because you have\na more intractable problem in trying to get some kind of\ncoherent standard for punitive damages, you've simply got\nto have a more restrictive remedy or a more intensive\nreview, so Rule 59 really is not a good precedent to\nappeal to.\nMR. MASSEY: Well, Your Honor, procedurally the\nexcessiveness challenges are made under the Rule 59\nrubric, so that applying the sort of --\nQUESTION: In the sort of normal -- I say\nnormal remittitur motions, but I don't think we perceive\nthe problem of remittitur issues as being a problem\ncomparable to the difficulty of trying to get some kind of\na coherent standard for punitive damages, and because the\nproblems are different maybe the remedies and terms of\njudicial review ought to be different.\nMR. MASSEY: Well, Your Honor, I think the\nseriousness with which the lower courts address this\nproblem is not really going to be affected by the standard\nof review. I think the message has been sent in Gore and\nhas been received, and the courts have shown themselves\nquite willing to step in and reverse verdicts that the\nperceive to be excessive, and I -- we believe that the de\nnovo standard is frankly just confusing. It's beyond what\nthe historical tradition would permit. It --\nQUESTION: Well --\nMR. MASSEY: -- sort of -- yes.\nQUESTION: When you're finished, I want to go\nback to the question of historical tradition, but go ahead\nand finish what --\nMR. MASSEY: Well, and it fails to recognize the\nfirst-hand vantage point of the district judge. This\nCourt has recognized in the habeas context, for example,\nProfessor Baktor's warning that it's sort of debilitating\nto State courts to be told that they're going to be\nsecond-guessed by Federal courts.\nIn this instance, when you have highly\nfact-intensive questions I think the message sent by a de\nnovo review is -- might have the unintended consequence of\nsort of undermining the district court's willingness to\ngrapple with the record, knowing that whatever he does is\ngoing to be reviewed again by the -- by his brethren on\nthe court of appeals.\nQUESTION: But that's quite different than the\nhabeas rule. I mean, there's no writ of habeas pecuniae\nthat says, you know, if you lose a punitive damages award\nin the State court you can go into Federal court and\nrelitigate it. That's just the ordinary pressure that any\ntrial judge is subject to knowing he will be reviewed by\nan appellate judge, appellate court.\nMR. MASSEY: Yes, Your Honor. We -- I simply\nmeant that the judges now are doing a very conscientious\njob of restraining --\nQUESTION: Well then, they have nothing to fear.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Mr. Massey, going back to the\nhistorical point that you alluded to, I'm not sure that I\nfollow your argument, and I'd like you to maybe expand on\nit.\nI realize -- I mean, we have faced the argument\nthat historically the review of a jury verdict is very,\nfor this kind of punitive excessiveness is very grudging,\nbut we passed that point and we said, yes, there can be\nsome review, and that review to begin with can take place\nby a trial judge, and a trial judge who is performing\nwhat, I think, functionally is an abuse of discretion\nreview of what the jury did, informed by particular Gore\nfactors and so on, can set it aside.\nOnce we have passed the point of saying there\ncan be that kind of review by the trial judge, what is it\nhistorically that would have a bearing on the question,\nwhether the appellate court's review of the trial judge is\neither de novo or abuse of discretion? I would have\nthought that the force of historical precedent is behind\nus once we take the position that the verdicts can be\nreviewed at all?\nMR. MASSEY: Well, Your Honor, the common law,\nthough, drew the line between the trial judge and the\nappeals court, that that -- the Seventh Amendment was\nadopted largely to prevent appellate courts from\ninterfering, not trial judges.\nQUESTION: Well, that might ground an argument\nsaying the trial judge's review is itself unreviewable,\nbut that's not your argument, and if we accept the\nproposition that the trial judge can be reviewed under\nsome standard, what historically -- what does history tell\nus as to whether that standard ought to be de novo, in\nwhich case the appellate court is looking at the jury\nverdict for abuse, or on an abuse of discretion, in which\ncase the appellate court is looking for an abuse by the\ntrial judge, who reviews for abuse? What does history\ntell us when we are at the stage where we are at now?\nMR. MASSEY: Well, I mean, history would counsel\nthat having gone to abuse of discretion in Gasperini we\nought not go further to de novo, because the Gasperini\nstep --\nQUESTION: But the review of the jury -- the\nsubstantive standard for reviewing the jury verdict is\ngoing to be exactly the same in either case.\nMR. MASSEY: Well, but that was always true\nhistorically. In other words, even in the 19th Century,\njudges, the trial judges were reviewed for excessiveness\nbut not courts of appeals and, even before Gore, we had\ncommon law standards for reviewing damages awards, or --\nQUESTION: Okay, but if that --\nMR. MASSEY: -- borrowed those --\nQUESTION: But if that is not a reason for\nsaying there is no appellate review, I don't know why it\nis a reason for making this choice between two varieties\nof appellate review.\nMR. MASSEY: Well, sort of in for a penny, in\nfor a pound, but we think we ought to --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. MASSEY: -- stop where we are, rather\nthan -- I mean, the Court in Gasperini made the quite\ndeliberate decision not to go to de novo review, or to\ntell the courts of appeals --\nQUESTION: And did think there was historical\nprecedent for --\nMR. MASSEY: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- an abuse of discretion standard,\nand there was disagreement on the Court whether that was\nso, but the majority held that there was, but -- so unless\nGasperini is overruled, then I think this case has got to\nturn on, is there a significant difference between\ncompensatory damages, where we said abuse of discretion is\nit, no de novo review --\nQUESTION: Except that --\nQUESTION: -- and punitive damages. It's got to\nturn on that, unless the Court is going to redo Gasperini\nand say no, the court of appeals can have de novo review\nthere, too.\nMR. MASSEY: Yes, Your Honor, we agree, and we\nthink the line between --\nQUESTION: May I just ask you this question?\nMR. MASSEY: Yes.\nQUESTION: Is there not at least conceptually --\nmaybe practically it doesn't matter -- a difference\nbetween constitutional excessiveness of a damage award and\nnonconstitutional excessiveness? In other words, could\nnot -- like the damages in Gasperini or the damages here\nmight be excessive in a sense that they violated State\nlaw, or they just offended the conscience some way, but\ndid not violate the Constitution.\nDoes it -- is there -- is it conceivable that an\naward could be excessive as a matter of just general\ncommon law rulings of one kind or another, but yet not\nviolate the Constitution?\nMR. MASSEY: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: So that this case is conceptually\nquite different from Gasperini?\nMR. MASSEY: Well, it is in that way, although\nof course the Gore factors themselves are distilled from\nthe common law. I mean, Your Honor did not mint them from\nnew sources. You traced back to the common law roots, and\nfootnote 24 of Gore in fact refers to their deep-rooted\nnature within the common law. So we think the common law\nprecedents are still highly instructive.\nBut going back to the line between compensatories and\npunitives. I mean, at common law there was not that line.\nThe courts did not treat the two differently and, in fact,\nin footnote 7 of Cooper's reply brief they discuss the\ncommon law tradition of treating them similarly,\nindistinguishably, in fact, in the same verdicts, so we\nagree that Gasperini here is controlling, and we don't\nthink it should be overruled or modified, and we don't\nthink a meaningful distinction can be drawn between\npunitive damages and compensatories.\nI would just like to add, and this uniformity\nnotion that we've heard about, first we believe the\ndistrict courts are in a good position, but also, second,\nthis Court in TXO essentially rejected a proposal for\nintrajurisdictional comparisons. The BMW factors are\nguideposts, but only guideposts. They are nonexclusive,\nand the question of gross excessiveness lends itself to an\nabuse of discretion standard rather than the de novo one.\nIf there are no further questions, thank you\nvery much.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Massey.\nMr. Reynolds, you have 3 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM BRADFORD REYNOLDS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. REYNOLDS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nOn Gasperini, I'd just like to say there's no\nneed to overrule Gasperini. In that case, the Court was\nlooking at an excessiveness issue as it relates to\ncompensatory damages, not to punitive, where it was very\nmuch tied up with a review of the historical facts, and\nthat's why the Court said that deferential review was what\nwas required in Gasperini.\nHere we have punitive damages that, as I've\nexplained, are of a much different sort, and they're not\ntied up with the historical facts, so Gasperini does not,\ncertainly, need to be overruled.\nThe other point I make under Rule 59 --\nQUESTION: Excuse me, doesn't pain and suffering\ncome into a Gasperini calculation sometimes, or often?\nMR. REYNOLDS: But again it goes to the\ncompensation in the compensatory award. We're looking\nnow at the punishment on the defendant --\nQUESTION: Yes, but it's -- I understand. I'm\nnot sure the calculation of pain and suffering is much\ndifferent from calculation, the calculation at issue here.\nMR. REYNOLDS: The calculation, I would submit,\nMr. Justice Scalia, is on the side of the fact-finding,\nthe historical facts, and what the harm is to the injured\nparty. Here, we are talking about not facts tried to the\njury, the historical facts, but the judgment made on the\npunishment side.\nI do think that there is a difference between\nnonconstitutional excessiveness and constitutional\nexcessiveness. This Court in Brown and Ferris did say\nthat where you're dealing with an issue of\nnonconstitutional excessiveness on the punitive damage\nside, that the deferential review would be the appropriate\nreview, but unless what the Court has said in BMW v. Gore\nis superfluous, unless we're going to say that there's no\ndifference between the constitutional excessiveness and\nnonconstitutional, then there is something here that\nrequires a de novo review standard that is not just the\ndeferential review that you have in the nonconstitutional\ncontext, and we would submit that the -- all the indicia\nthat point to de novo review are in place here.\nAnd I would point the Court to the Salve Regina\ndecision of this Court which does, indeed, explain why,\nwhen a de novo review is, is indeed required and necessary\non a legal issue, especially of constitutional importance,\nthat abuse of discretion is no answer to that review\nstandard.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\n"
