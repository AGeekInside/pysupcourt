McCONNELL\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. McCONNELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nThis Court has consistently rejected the\nargument that Federal statutes that both create a right\nto sue and also bar waiver of rights under the statute\nare sufficiently explicit to override the strong Federal\npolicy in favor of arbitrability expressed in the\nFederal Arbitration Act. In two of those cases, Gilmer\nand Pyett, the Court construed a statute the relevant\nlanguage of which is virtually indistinguishable from\nthat and the Credit Repair Organizations Act that we\nhave before us today.\nThose cases involve the ADEA. Both the ADEA\nand CROA, as I'll call it, create a cause of action for\naggrieved parties to bring actions for damages. And\nboth statutes explicitly bar waiver of, quote, \"any\nright\" under the statute.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that statute\ndidn't have, as this one has, a disclosure requirement\nthat says you have a right to sue.\nMR. McCONNELL: And that's the sole\ndistinction between the two statutes. So, let's talk\nabout --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, it could be a\nmeaningful one.\nMR. McCONNELL: So, the -- first of all, the\ndisclosure statute is a -- describes in layman's terms,\ngives a quick description of an operative civil\nliability section, which is set out in 1679g and which\ntells us exactly what Congress had in mind in creating a\ncause of action.\nAnd when you look at the language of the\nactual operative provision, 1679g, it's almost as if\nCongress deliberately went out of its way to use\nlanguage that would not preclude arbitration. That\nlanguage provides that a person who violates the statute\nshall be liable to the persons --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Suppose it said something\ndifferent, Mr. McConnell. Suppose the disclosure\nprovision didn't exist at all, but that instead of that\nliability provision, you had a provision that simply\nsaid: Any person injured by a violation of this Act\nwill have a right of action or will have a right to sue\nunder this statute. And then you had the waiver\nprovision that you have in this statute. Is that\nenough?\nMR. McCONNELL: Justice Kagan, I think that\nwould be exactly the same, because a cause of action and\na right to sue are the same thing. They mean the same\nthing. And this Court has consistently since Mitsubishi\nheld that just because Congress creates a cause of\naction which is a right to sue does not preclude\narbitration, because --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. McConnell, you\nstarted with the notion that the disclosure provision in\nthe statute is meant to apply to ordinary people, and if\nan ordinary person not schooled in the law read \"you\nhave a right to sue,\" wouldn't they understand that to\nmean I have a right to sue in court?\nMR. McCONNELL: Justice Ginsburg, in the\nADEA context, the government itself, the EEOC, sends\ndiscriminated-against workers a right-to-sue letter that\ntells them they have a right to sue. But this Court has\ntwice said that that does not preclude arbitration. And\nthat's because a right to sue is simply a cause of\naction. It doesn't actually -- that doesn't mean\nexclusively a right to be in court. It gives you rights\nwhich may be vindicated, and there are various ways in\nwhich they can be vindicated. And the Federal\nArbitration Act provides that the -- that this Court or\nthat the courts must enforce private contractual\nagreements that provide for the vindication even of\nstatutory rights through arbitration.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Can you imagine any\nstatutory language that would eliminate the right, the\nability of the parties to enter into an arbitration\nagreement other than language that expressly prohibits\nthe waiver of the right to sue in court in favor of\narbitration?\nMR. McCONNELL: Yes, Justice Alito, I can\nimagine it. Now, Congress has to date not used it.\nCongress knows perfectly well how to bar arbitration.\nThey've done it in a number of statutes. In fact, in\nthe very Congress that enacted CROA, there were three\ndifferent statutes that were proposed that would have\neliminated arbitration for particular statutory schemes.\nNone of them were adopted.\nBut Congress is perfectly aware of how to do\nthis. I don't think they have to use the magic words\n\"no arbitration,\" but -- but they certainly have to do\nsomething considerably more direct than this.\nHere they've created a statute that provides\nthat there must be liability and creates a cause of\naction, and then they tell people in a separate\ndisclosure provision -- by the way, added very late in\nthe drafting process, right -- simply to tell people\nthat they have what is colloquially known for laymen as\na right to sue.\nNow, we lawyers call things causes of\naction. We call them things like the right to bring a\ncivil action in a court of competent jurisdiction.\nThat's lawyers' language. But when ordinary people talk\nabout this, they think that's a right to sue. But a\ncause of action and a right to sue are exactly the same\nthing.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. McConnell, the cases\nthat you cite in support of your position rest on a\ndistinction between procedural rights and substantive\nrights, which you invoke here. But where does that\ndistinction itself come from? Because it seems very\natextual in nature, that distinction, which does appear\nin the cases. But when Congress talks about rights, why\nshould we think of rights as limited to substantive\nrights rather than also procedural rights?\nMR. McCONNELL: First of all, only our\nwaiver argument depends upon those particular cases; we\nhave a second argument. But, nonetheless, I think this\ncomes from the very long tradition, at least back to the\n1980s in Mitsubishi, of understanding that arbitration\nis a choice of a forum, but it must vindicate the\nsubstantive rights of the particular statute.\nSo, this is the way courts have talked about\nthe relationship between arbitration and the substantive\nstatute. So, you look at the statute, and you see what\nare the prohibitions, what are the substantive rights\nand so forth, and the arbitrators enforce all of those,\nbut that the term rights does not include -- it does not\nmean that there's an exclusively judicial forum, just\nthat whoever is the decisionmaker is going to enforce\nexactly the same set of substantive rights which are in\nthe statute.\nBut, Justice Kagan, even if that were not\npersuasive, Congress is perfectly aware that that's the\nway that this Court had been interpreting the words,\nbecause Gilmer, which interprets the very words \"any\nrights\" in an anti-waiver provision as not including\narbitration, happened just a few years, 5 years, before\nenactment of this statute. And we know Congress was\naware of Gilmer, because in -- the very same Congress\nthat passed CROA also considered a bill, considered and\nrejected, a bill that would have reversed the decision\nin Gilmer.\nSo, Gilmer and the very question of -- of\narbitration was before this Congress, and they knew that\nthe word \"any rights\" was interpreted by this Court the\nway that it was in Gilmer, and they used precisely the\nlanguage that was interpreted that way in Gilmer.\nAnd so, at this point, there's a vocabulary.\nIt's like there's a glossary. Congress is using it, and\neven if it may not be, you know, fully textual, as you\nsay, that's -- that's the way Congress now addresses the\nmatter.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the -- the Act in\nGilmer did not designate court action or right to sue as\na right within the non-waivable provision.\nMR. McCONNELL: That's true, Justice\nGinsburg, and the question is, does it matter? I would\nsay anyone looking at the ADEA's language, which says\nthat an aggrieved person may bring a civil action in\ncourt, anyone would say that that is a right to sue. It\nis surely a right.\nAnd, indeed, when this Court interpreted\nthat statute in Pyett, this Court called it a right, a\nright, to a judicial forum. Three times in the opinion,\nthe Court refers to that as a \"right.\" And the fact\nthat our statute here refers to a right to sue, rather\nthan a right to bring a civil action, seems -- certainly\nagainst the backdrop -- recall, please, that the\nquestion here is whether Congress has explicitly\nabrogated the -- specifically disavowed, specifically\nbarred the use -- the arbitrability of the -- of the\ncontracts, and that all doubts are supposed to be\nresolved in favor of arbitrability, and the -- the\nstatutes must be interpreted with a healthy regard for\nthe policy in favor of arbitrability.\nConsidering this, and considering the paltry\nbasis in the text for -- for that conclusion, I don't\nsee how the Ninth Circuit's decision can be withstood --\ncould be upheld.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think a --\nthe word \"lawsuit\" typically describes an arbitration\nproceeding? If you're subject to an arbitration, would\nyou say, I'm in a lawsuit?\nMR. McCONNELL: I do not think so.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why doesn't a\nright to sue refer to a lawsuit?\nMR. McCONNELL: It refers to a cause of\naction, Your Honor, you know, and we can call that a\nlawsuit, too. I mean, often that's another layman's\nterm for a cause of action. But this Court has held I\ndon't know how many times, I believe it's at least six\ntimes since -- since Mitsubishi, that just because\nCongress creates a cause of action and says that it will\nbe in court, that does not mean that that's -- that that\ndoes not preclude arbitration, that that creates a cause\nof action.\nAnd I think the -- the underlying logic of\nthis is that the existence of a cause of action or of a\nright to sue, which I submit is a synonym for a cause of\naction, is -- is not inconsistent with arbitration; it's\nthe precondition for arbitration. If there were not a\ncause of action, there would be nothing to arbitrate,\nright? So, in every case in which there's a legal\narbitration, there's a cause of action. It might arise\nfrom contract, it might arise from a statute, but in\nevery single arbitration, there is a cause of action.\nIf this Court were to interpret --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: No, if this were written\nto be read by and understood by lawyers, I think you\nwould have a stronger argument. But this is meant for\nconsumers, and they read \"you have a right to sue, and\nthat right is not waivable.\" A right to sue -- they're\nnot going to think about cause of action. They don't\nknow what cause of action is. But they do know that a\nright to sue is a right to bring a lawsuit.\nMR. McCONNELL: Justice Ginsburg, again, if\nthat is so, it would apply to other cases in which the\nlanguage \"right to sue\" is used. For example, the\nEEOC's right-to-sue letters, what could be more explicit\nthan that? But this Court has held several times that\njust because the EEOC sends a right-to-sue letter\ndoesn't mean that Congress has --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that in -- is that in\nthe statute? Or is it just a colloquial --\nMR. McCONNELL: It's in the regulations,\nYour Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but Title VII\ndoesn't say \"right to sue.\" It's a name that the agency\nuses, but it's not -- it's not in the statute. The\nstatute doesn't say you have a right to sue.\nMR. McCONNELL: Well, what the statute says\nis you may bring a suit in court. And so, if this\nCourt -- I do not see how the Court can say that the\nright -- that the language \"the right to sue\" is\ndifferent from a right of action. It certainly -- it's\n-- it is the same thing.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One way you could do\nit is that the right to sue is more familiar\ncolloquially. If somebody, you know, hits your car and\nyou jump out angrily and say -- you can say: I'm going\nto sue you. You're not likely to say: I'm going to\nbring a cause of action against you.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. McCONNELL: We have -- there is no\nreason to think that when Congress appended a disclosure\nprovision toward the end of the drafting of this statute\nand simply used a colloquial version of cause of action\nso that ordinary people would understand it, that they\nintended to change the meaning of the operative\nprovision. The operative provision tells us, I think\nvery clearly, what Congress meant, and then in this sort\nof quick shorthand, colloquial way, they're telling\npeople, yes, they have an action, but just like they\nhave an action -- persons have an action under the\nSherman Act, they have an action under RICO, they have\nan action under the ADEA, they have an action under the\nTruth in Lending Act. In all of these cases, people\nhave a right to sue, but this Court has held that\narbitration vindicates the cause of action.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In a standard arbitration\nagreement, if Smith and Jones agree to arbitrate and\nJones then brings suit in court, and that action is then\nstayed pending arbitration, has there been a breach of\nthe arbitration agreement simply by bringing the suit?\nMR. McCONNELL: I don't --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, doesn't that\nhappen rather often?\nMR. McCONNELL: It does happen rather often.\nI'm not sure what the -- I would say no. What I would\nsay is that the -- is that the question of arbitrability\nhas been put before the court, and the court will decide\nwhether to enforce the arbitration clause or not.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And, of course, suits are\nbrought after arbitration to enforce the arbitration\naward.\nMR. McCONNELL: Exactly. Exactly. So, in\nthis sense, it's not that the cause of action goes away.\nIt's not the -- the cause of action is not being waived.\nIt's simply being vindicated in a different way, in a\nway which Congress in the Arbitration Act has told us is\nperfectly appropriate, just as appropriate as a -- as\nvindication in Court and that we should leave it to --\nand that a contract between the parties to decide which\nof the forums for vindication of their rights would be\nused should be enforced.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Except that this is not\nwhat the parties decide. These are take it or leave it\ncontracts. So, the consumer doesn't really elect\narbitration. It's just presented as part of the terms\nthat the consumer can take or leave and not negotiated.\nMR. McCONNELL: That is an argument against\narbitration that this Court has rejected several times.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It's a question of\nwhether we take that into account in -- in determining\nwhat \"you have a right to sue\" means.\nMR. McCONNELL: Well, Justice Ginsburg,\nCongress -- that's a policy question, and Congress has\ngiven us an answer. Recently, by the way, Congress has\nindicated a slightly different answer which will affect\ncases like this in the future. As part of the\nDodd-Frank regulatory reform bill, Congress required the\nnew Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to conduct a\nserious study of the use of arbitration procedures in\nconsumer financial matters to find out whether things\nlike what you referred to, Justice Ginsburg, the -- the\ntypes of contracts and so forth are fair to consumers.\nSo, we'll get an authoritative answer to\nthis. And Congress then vested this new bureau with\nauthority either to outlaw arbitration awards or to\nrequire conditions or to reform them. But in the\nmeantime, the policy that Congress has set is the policy\nin the Federal Arbitration Act, which is one of a strong\npolicy in favor of enforcing arbitration contracts.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: You know, except if Congress\nindicates otherwise and --\nMR. McCONNELL: Unless Congress has\nindicated otherwise.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: And I guess that the problem\nhere is that there is this language in this disclosure\nprovision which is meant, you know, truly to inform\nconsumers about -- about their rights and about where\nthey're going to end up resolving their disputes, and it\nsays \"you have a right to sue.\" And you're asking us\nessentially to read that language as: You have a right\nto bring a claim in court, but it's probably going to\nend up in arbitration because of the nature of your form\ncontract.\nAnd that seems a very different kind of\nstatement to consumers.\nMR. McCONNELL: Justice Kagan, I do not see\nhow it would be any different from a consumer who reads\nany of the statutes that this Court has held are subject\nto arbitration. If, for example, in the Truth in\nLending Act, which this Court interpreted in the Green\nTree case that as part of the arbitration contract, it\nwas required to send the consumer a copy of the statute.\nThe consumer would read in the statute that there's a\ncause of action, that they can bring suit in court to\nenforce their rights under the Truth in Lending Act.\nThey would read that statute, and they would\ndraw exactly the same conclusion that they do from the\nshorthand layman's language of \"a right to sue.\"\nBut, again, even if that were so, I think as\na matter of -- of how -- of statutory interpretation,\nthat a disclosure provision cannot change the meaning of\nthe operative section. The operative section which\ncreates the rights and liabilities here is section\n1679g. And not even Respondents seriously claim that\nthat section is -- shows a congressional intent to\nprevent arbitrability. And that seems -- the fact that\nthere's a disclosure provision that uses more informal\nlanguage instead of the lawyers' language used in 1679g\ndoes not change the meaning of the statute.\nUnless there are further questions, I will\nreserve the remaining part of my time for rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Nelson.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT L. NELSON\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. NELSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Credit Repair Organizations Act provides\nconsumers with what it explicitly denominates a right to\nsue, and then it says that any right of the consumer\nunder the statute is non-waivable. As this Court has\nsaid --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Does that mean that\nthere's a violation of the statute the minute one of\nthese organizations asks someone to sign an arbitration\nclause?\nMR. NELSON: There's --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: A $1,000 penalty for the\nmere asking?\nMR. NELSON: There's a -- there's a\ntechnical violation in asking, because in 1679f not only\nare waivers made unenforceable, but it is -- it is\nprohibited to ask someone to waive their rights.\nHowever, that does not mean that you\nactually have a cause of action to go in and sue\nsomebody for that, because, remember, under 1679g, what\nyou can sue for is your money back. If somebody's asked\nyou for a waiver -- you didn't sign the contract, you\ndidn't pay them any money. Or your damages -- if\nsomebody asked you for a waiver and you never signed up\nwith them, you don't have any damages. And then\npunitive damages in addition, which -- you know, the\ngeneral rule about punitive damages is you get them on\ntop of actual damages if you have actual damages.\nSo, it's -- yes, it's a technical violation.\nIf a company engaged in a pattern or practice of it, the\nFTC could quite rightly go in and get an injunction\nagainst that. But it's not a case where there would be\nsome onerous penalty imposed on a company merely for\nasking for a waiver.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, doesn't that\nreading, however, make suspect your claim that Congress\nwould have intended -- without any discussion in the\nlegislative history -- and our case law has said you\nhave to read the intent to bar arbitration both from the\nlanguage of the statute, its context, and its history.\nI just don't see any history here that supports your\nreading.\nMR. NELSON: Well, Justice Sotomayor, I want\nto take that in two parts, because the first was -- was\ntied to the -- the attempt to procure a waiver and\nwhether that calls into question whether Congress really\ncould have meant this. It's sort of an unusual\nprovision to say not only can you not waive rights, but\nit's a violation even to ask somebody to waive them.\nBut that's no more unusual with respect to\nthe right to sue than with respect to any other right\nunder this statute. For example, the right to cancel\nafter 3 days. Everybody would concede, I think, that\nthat's a non-waivable right under the clear language of\nthis statute. It's an unusual and perhaps onerous\nprovision to say that if somebody just suggested that\nyou waive that right to cancel and you never actually\nwaived it, they still violated the statute.\nBut, you know, that's what Congress wrote\nhere, because in this statute, it was concerned with an\nindustry that it saw as overreaching pervasively in\nrelation to the people that it was -- it was trying to\nsign up for its services. And that's why Congress\nwanted a very strong prohibition of waiver of rights\nthat even attempted -- that even extended to attempts.\nNow, as to the --\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Nelson, but your\nfriend Mr. McConnell says quite rightly that the rules\nin this area have been fairly clear, that Congress knew\nit had to make especially clear that it wanted to void\narbitration agreements. So, if that's the case, why\ndidn't Congress do what it has done in a thousand other\nstatutes -- or maybe that's an overstatement -- but a\nnumber of other statutes, which is to say so?\nMR. NELSON: First of all, the -- the rules\nare not that Congress has to be especially clear in this\ncontext. And, in fact, the Court has said over and over\nin the line of cases starting with Mitsubishi, McMahon,\nRodriguez de Quijas, and Gilmer that what has to be\ndiscernible -- and this also gets back to Justice\nSotomayor's question -- it merely has to be discernible\nfrom the text or the legislative history or the\nstructure and policies of the Act that -- that there's\nan intent to preclude waiver of the right to judicial\nremedies.\nThat's not an unmistakable plain statement\nrule; it's not a requirement of explicitness in the\nsense of explicitly using the term \"arbitration.\" As\neven my friend stated, there's no requirement of magic\nwords.\nWhat this Court said, what it told Congress\nin the years leading up to this statute is: You have to\nexpress a discernible intent to preclude waiver of the\nright to judicial remedies.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right. And -- and you\ndon't need a magic word, but it seems to me you need\nsomething more than a provision dealing with what you\nhave to tell to the people who -- who accept these\ncontracts. I mean it's not in the substantive part of\nthe statute. It's in the part of the statute that tells\nyou what provisions of the -- of the Act you have to\nnotify the consumer of. It's a very strange way for\nCongress to say \"no arbitration\" by putting this\nlanguage in a section that has nothing to do with the\nrights under the Act.\nMR. NELSON: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It is intended to be a\nsummary of the rights under the Act.\nMR. NELSON: Justice Scalia, I think it's --\nI think it's not a strange way at all but a very direct\nway in the context here. Remember, in Gilmer, what the\nCourt was dealing with was a statute that as amended in\nan amendment that actually wasn't before the Court in\nGilmer said you can't waive any right under the statute.\nBut that then raises a question: Well, what do we mean\nby rights under this statute? And the Court concluded\nthere and reinforced in Pyett that it interpreted that\nto mean substantive rights; in the absence of a textual\nindication, that when Congress used the term \"rights\" in\nthis statute, it was intending to protect the procedural\nright to go to court.\nHere we have something very different.\nCongress creates a cause of action which, as my friend\nsays, colloquially someone could call that a right if\nthey wanted to. But the cause of action says you can --\nyou can obtain this liability; the court will determine\nit; you obtain it through an action. That certainly\ngives you an entitlement to go to court. But Congress\nthen goes further and it denominates that one of the\nrights under this statute, one of only two rights under\nthis statute that are so-called.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think that Gilmer\nwould have come out differently with regard to one of\nthe procedural rights involved in that case if the\nstatute had happened to refer to that procedural right\nas a right? Procedural rights are rights, aren't they?\nMR. NELSON: Yes, they are definitely\nrights, and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So, and if the statute in\nGilmer had referred to one of the procedural rights in\npassing as a right, you think that one would have been\nnon-waivable?\nMR. NELSON: I think that if Congress had\nexpressly denominated something in that statute as a\nright --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But procedural rights are\nrights. I mean, to denominate it as a right is --\nMR. NELSON: Well, but the question is:\nDoes \"any right\" refer to both procedural and\nsubstantive rights?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly.\nMR. NELSON: Which is what this Court held\nthat it did not in Pyett. But when Congress -- you\nknow, it does matter what words Congress uses, and\n\"rights\" is a word that can have a lot of meanings.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but --\nMR. NELSON: This is a statute that --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you're saying -- in\nanswer to my question, you're saying that just because\nthe statute refers to procedural rights as rights, just\nas we do, all of a sudden, simply because the statute\nuses our normal language, those procedural rights are\nelevated to the level of substantive rights and can't be\nwaived. That can't be right.\nMR. NELSON: I think if Congress makes clear\nin the statute that what it means when it's talking\nabout rights is -- includes procedural rights, and then\nit has a provision that says any right under this\nstatute is not subject to waiver, that creates a very\nstrong inference that Congress meant what it said. But,\nin fact --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think that\nreferring to a procedural right as a right creates any\ninference at all. It is a right.\nMR. NELSON: It is a right, and when\nCongress has said -- I mean, many of these statutes such\nas Title VII and TILA don't say that rights are\nnon-waivable. This statute is a unique statute in its\nphrasing. It has a non-waiver provision applicable to\nany right, and it has a list of rights. That's pretty\nunusual.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What else is non-waivable\nbesides the 3 days to back out?\nMR. NELSON: Well, the other thing that this\nstatute makes non-waivable besides rights is\nprotections, and -- which is a phrase that isn't then\ntied to anything defined in the statute. But I think\nthat, for example, all of the prohibited practices\nlisted in section 1679b, which are at pages 4a to 5a of\nthe red brief -- those would be non-waivable. You\ncouldn't waive your right not to have the credit repair\norganization make false statements to you. You couldn't\nwaive your right under 1679b(b) not to have to make a\npayment in advance to a credit repair organization. You\ncan't waive the right to the disclosures provided for in\n1679c or the protection provided by those disclosures.\nAnd 1679d requires written contracts and specifies those\nterms. Those would all be subject to the provision in\nthe statute that says you can't waive any protection or\nany right provided by the statute.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Do you know, Mr. Nelson,\nwhether this statute is unique in this sense: Do you\nknow of any other statute that arguably voids\narbitration agreements without saying that they're\nvoiding -- that it's voiding an arbitration agreement?\nMR. NELSON: No. There's a -- sort of a\npending disagreement, perhaps, over whether the\nMagnuson-Moss Warranty Act does, but that's because of\nsome very specific language in that statute about\ninformal dispute resolution mechanisms and the manner in\nwhich that has been interpreted in agency regulations.\nSo, this is really the only statute that I'm aware of\nthat uses this formulation.\nBut you remind me of your earlier question,\nwhich I never got to finish answering about the\nthousands of other statutes that say specifically that\nyou can't enforce arbitration agreements. In fact,\nthere are very few such statutes. There were none at\nthe time this statute was enacted. The first one\nappeared 6 years later. The only time that there has\nbeen any number of them is in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act,\nwhich came after what I would say is a lengthy period of\nconsiderable attention that had been paid by advocates\nbefore Congress to the issue of arbitration that I think\nled to the desire to use as sort of a belt and\nsuspenders approach in those statutes.\nBut what we had here in 1996, there had\nnever before been a statute that prohibited the\nenforcement specifically of an arbitration agreement in\nthose terms. And as Mr. McConnell said, there were some\nproposals, unenacted proposals, that had been floated at\nthat time. But I think the one thing that is clear is\nthat we don't learn how Congress does things by looking\nat things that it didn't do. And that's all those\nunenacted proposals were.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Would your position of\nright to a lawsuit -- would that extend to a\npost-dispute genuinely bargained-for right to arbitrate?\nMR. NELSON: No, I think not, Justice\nGinsburg, and for this reason: The -- the Court has\nalways differentiated between post-dispute settlements\nof claims and pre-dispute waivers, and has not\nconsidered agreements to settle, absent very special\neither statutory language such as in the ADEA, which\ndoes apply a waiver provision to some types of\nsettlements, and in the Fair Labor Standards Act, where\nthere's a very specific policy reason for prohibiting\ncertain kinds of settlements. But, generally, the Court\nhas not considered the settlement of a case to be a\nwaiver of the right to bring the case. And that\nprimarily came in the FELA cases that we cited in our\nbriefs.\nBut I think it was significant that in Wilko\nv. Swan, where the Court said we're going to interpret\nthe Securities Act not to -- not to allow waivers of the\nright to sue, the Court said: Of course, this wouldn't\napply to something that came post-dispute.\nAnd in McMahon and Rodriguez de Quijas, what\nthe Court disagreed with Wilko v. Swan about was whether\nthe right to sue under that particular statute was\nnon-waivable. But it favorably commented on the notion\nthat, of course, even if it were, it wouldn't bar a\npost-dispute agreement to arbitrate a claim as a way of\nsettling an actually pending dispute.\nAnd that's why I think when Congress enacted\nthis statute, it would have been acting against that\nbackdrop and would not have -- no one would have thought\nthat a settlement agreement is a waiver of the right to\nsue. A settlement agreement is a resolution of the\nright to sue.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Another argument that is\nmade, in opposition to your position, is that the\nstatute says any waiver of any protection or right may\nnot be enforced by any court or any other person. And\nthe suggestion is \"any other person\" must contemplate an\nalternate dispute method that doesn't involve court --\ncourt or any other person.\nMR. NELSON: Well, I don't think that it\nnecessarily contemplates an alternative dispute\nresolution mechanism, because I think, for example, that\nwould bar -- when someone goes to court to compel\narbitration, they are enforcing an arbitration agreement\nby bringing an enforcement action. So, that would bar\nthem from doing that.\nSo, \"any other person\" doesn't necessarily\nmean arbitrators. But even to the extent that it\ncomprehends arbitrators and maybe even one might have\nthought was principally applicable to them, you've got\nto realize that this statute -- what it prohibits is\nonly the waiver of the consumer's ability to arbitrate\nher CROA claim. It doesn't bar a credit repair\norganization from requiring a consumer to arbitrate the\ncredit repair organization's breach of contract action.\nAnd, in fact, most -- well over 99 percent of the\nconsumer arbitrations that were handled by the\narbitration forum that was designated in this contract\nwere collection actions brought by a company that says\nthis consumer owes me some money.\nSo, that's kind of the norm. That's the\ngeneral run of arbitration cases. And if a credit\nrepair organization were to initiate an arbitration\nagainst a consumer, that wouldn't violate the non-waiver\nprovision; but if the consumer then defended and said,\nwait a second, this contract is void because I never got\nthe right to cancel, the provision would quite clearly\nprevent the arbitrator in that circumstance from saying\nyou waived the right to cancel.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about the\nargument that the consumer retains the right to sue,\nsince they can go into court with their complaint, but\nit's simply -- the rule that the court will apply is\nthat you have to proceed to arbitration?\nMR. NELSON: Well, I think it's -- it would\nbe a remarkably crabbed notion of having a right to sue\nthat meant you could file a complaint that was\nmandatorily subject to decision elsewhere. And, second,\nand this goes to Justice --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's\nfrequently -- that's frequently the way these issues\ncome up. I mean, people --\nMR. NELSON: Well, that's certainly --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- who think they\ncannot be forced to arbitrate either under the agreement\nor any other provision, they'll bring their complaint in\ncourt, and then there will be a judicial resolution of\nwhether or not the proceeding should go to arbitration.\nMR. NELSON: But -- but all that has been\nresolved in that -- that suit is not the plaintiff's\nclaim under CROA, which is what he has a right to sue\non. All that's resolved is the issue of whether he has\na contractual obligation to arbitrate which he has\nbreached by going into court.\nAnd this goes to Justice Kennedy's question.\nUnder the FAA, you can compel arbitration when someone\nhas filed a complaint that is in breach of an agreement\nto arbitrate.\nSo, they -- they don't actually have a right\nto sue. You can't stop them from going and filing a\ncomplaint, but once they do, you come in and say, no,\nyou have no right to -- to proceed on the merits with\nthis claim in court. And, in fact, that's -- that's\nexactly what the arbitration --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you get -- can you get\ndamages in the arbitration for the cost of attorney's\nfees to go to the court to say that you had to go to the\narbitration?\nMR. NELSON: No, I don't think you would\ngenerally have that entitlement under any -- any rule of\nlaw that is -- that is normally applicable in American\ncourts. However, if your -- if your arbitration\nagreement provided for that -- I'm afraid I can't point\nto any decision that would make it unenforceable, much\nas I would regret that result.\nSo, you know, I think in a -- in a real\nsense, the consumer has no right to -- right to sue\nmerely because they can run into court and -- and then\nbe compelled to arbitrate. And that's exactly why this\nCourt, in every one of its decisions enforcing\narbitration agreements or not, has referred to the\narbitration agreement as a waiver of the right to\nproceed judicially. It has used that phrase over and\nover again in McMahon, Rodriguez de Quijas, Mitsubishi,\nand -- and Gilmer itself.\nThe -- the common recognition of all those\ncases is that the arbitration agreement is a waiver of\nthe person's right to proceed in court.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You agree, I take\nit, that you would lose if the statute said \"you have a\ncause of action\"?\nMR. NELSON: Yes. I -- you know, a cause of\naction I don't think would -- would do it for us. In\nfact, that's exactly what the ADEA says, the section\nthat creates a judicial remedy is headed \"Cause of\nAction.\" And so, you know, the question again is\n\"right\" is a word that -- that can be used in many\nsenses. It's -- it's a word sort of like\n\"jurisdiction.\" It gets thrown around loosely. But\nwhen Congress says a right is non-waivable, it's\nreferring to something specific. And the question is:\nWhat is it referring to in a statute that uses the term\n\"right\" and uses it to describe the -- the ability to go\nto court?\nAnd -- and, again, that \"right to sue\"\nlanguage is important in two ways, because it not only\nspecifies that the 1679g remedies are a right for\npurposes of this statute, but it says something about\nthe nature of the right. It's a right to sue. It's not\njust a right to get those damages, to get your money\nback. And \"sue,\" as I -- and I think my friend\nagrees --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well -- well, I guess it\ngoes further than that, your argument does, it seems to\nme. Your argument is the waiver -- the non-waiver of\nrights provision would normally be read to mean\nnon-waiver of substantive rights, but the notice given\nto the consumer here, which refers to the procedural\nright to sue as a \"right,\" eliminates that presumption.\nSo, I presume, therefore, that your position\nis that all procedural rights under this statute cannot\nbe waived. Because, I mean, that's what we're talking\nabout: What does \"right\" mean --\nMR. NELSON: Justice --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- when it says rights are\nnot waived? And our prior case law says ordinarily that\nmeans only substantive rights. But here in this\nstatute, it refers to the right to sue, which is\ncertainly a procedural right, as a right. So, I presume\nall the other procedural rights in this statute likewise\ncannot be waived.\nMR. NELSON: Well, I -- I'm not really sure\nthere are other procedural rights in the statute.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, there are none?\nMR. NELSON: I mean, unless -- the right to\ncancel within 3 days I suppose could be called a\nprocedure in one sense, although it's -- it's -- I think\nit -- it probably would generally be categorized as a\nsubstantive right.\nBut as far as procedural rights of the\nconsumer, they are set forth in 1679g, and they are the\nright to bring an action either on an individual or\nclass basis for the damages and attorney fees specified\nin that section. And that's what I think is being\nreferred to as \"the right to sue.\"\nNow, if there were something else in the\nstatute that one might arguably call a right and\narguably call procedural -- I mean, it's hypothetical\nbecause I don't think it's there, but I would not jump\nto the conclusion that it was a right if it was not\ncomprehended by \"right to sue,\" because I think what\nthat statement \"right to sue\" makes non-waivable is the\nright to sue. It's not just any procedural thing in\nthis statute that one might loosely call a right.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the case were\nreversed. The liability section says you have a right\nto sue, and the disclosure section says you have a right\nto sue or go to arbitration. What result then?\nMR. NELSON: Well --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me that under\nyour -- well, I'll let you answer.\nMR. NELSON: Justice Kennedy, let me divide\nit up. If the liability section said you had a right to\nsue and there were no disclosure -- disclosure section\nat all, I would say that's -- that's plenty good enough.\nIf the disclosure section says, you have a right to sue\nor to go to arbitration, I think you would have to then\nsay sensibly what is Congress talking about when it's --\nwhen it's referring to this, and you would have to read\nthem together. And I would have a hard time standing up\nhere and saying that a statute that told people \"right\nto sue or arbitrate\" meant right to sue only and\nforeclosed arbitration. And -- and, you know, I think\n-- I think that really would be a very different matter.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Nelson, you just said if\nthe liability section said you have a right to sue,\nthat's okay, but if it says you have a cause of action,\nthat's not okay. But the right to sue is really just a\ncolloquial way of expressing the first. So, why should\nwe draw the line between those two things?\nMR. NELSON: Well, when you say\n\"colloquial,\" I'm not -- I don't want to fence with you,\nbut I think that that's selling it a bit short. This is\na statute where Congress prescribed a notice, prescribed\nit in statutory terms, did it so people would have an\nunderstanding of what their rights were, and did it in a\nway that no reasonable consumer would understand meant,\noh, this non-waivable right is not really to sue in the\nway that I would ordinarily understand the word, and\neven that courts normally use it but actually to -- to\ndo something else.\nSo, I -- I don't think it's colloquial in --\nin a disparaging sense. What it is, is something that\nis designed to convey a clear meaning, and the clear\nmeaning that it conveys is you have a right to go to\ncourt. Now, of course, even a disclosure that you have\na right to go to court wouldn't be enough to get you\nover the hump if you didn't also have a provision that\nmade that right non-waivable. But, again, here what you\nhave is both.\nAnd -- and in doing that, in writing that\nstatute, Congress was doing exactly what the Court had\ntold it, it didn't do in Gilmer, it didn't do in\nMcMahon, it didn't do in Mitsubishi. It created a right\nto a judicial remedy that is not subject to waiver.\nUnless the Court has any further questions,\nI will --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. McConnell, you have 10 minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL W. McCONNELL\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. McConnell, can we go\nto the issue of the class action? If we buy your\nargument that procedural and substantive rights are\ndifferent, is it your position that you could seek a\nwaiver of a class action even though this statute\nexpressly contemplates class actions?\nMR. McCONNELL: Actually, Justice Sotomayor,\nI think this statute specifically does not require -- it\ncontemplates but does not require class actions. If you\nlook at -- at 1679g(a)(2)(B), which is the class action\nprovision -- it's on page 59a of the appendix to the --\nto the petition -- all that it says is that in the case\nof a class action, here is how we would -- here's how\nthe damages, the punitive damages, would be calculated.\nIt does not say that there must be class actions. It\ndoesn't make that a non-waivable right at all.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, your answer to me is\nthat that is waivable. That's not a right contemplated\nby the right to sue.\nMR. McCONNELL: Actually, my answer to you\nis that it's not a right to begin with.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, you have to meet\nthe prerequisites --\nMR. McCONNELL: Whether waivable or not.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you have to meet the\nprerequisites of a class action before you are entitled\nto seek one. But your position is that's not a\nprotected right?\nMR. McCONNELL: May I -- if we were to\nhypothesize that the statute did provide that there\nshall be class provisions, which this does not -- I\nthink this statute is agnostic on that, but the\nhypothetical statute where class actions are\ncontemplated, I would not argue that that is necessarily\nwaivable. What I would argue is that that can be\nvindicated through arbitration, that there can be -- as\nthis Court discussed just last term in Concepcion, there\ncan be class arbitration proceedings.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you -- but this\narbitration agreement precludes class actions, doesn't\nit?\nMR. McCONNELL: Yes, it does. And, again,\nthis statute does not require that there be class\nproceedings. I'm only addressing a hypothetical --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Unless --\nMR. McCONNELL: -- statute that did.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Unless we read the\ndisclosure requirement of a right to sue to mean that\nyou're entitled to bring your action in court. With\nwhatever protections, procedural and substantive\nprotections, that entails.\nMR. McCONNELL: Yes, and that seems to me\njust a further reason not to interpret a disclosure\nprovision with a layman's language as importing, you\nknow, very specific legal notions, that -- I think this\nsimply means -- right to sue simply means cause of\naction. And it's -- each of the rights, I should point\nout, in the disclosure provision is -- has its actual\ntextual home elsewhere. None of them are created in the\ndisclosure provision. Each of them is created\nelsewhere, either in this statute or another. To find\nout exactly what they entail, you look to the\nsubstantive provisions. Here, you would look to 1679g,\nand you would see that class actions are possible but\nnot required under this particular statute.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could you in an\nagreement waive the provisions of 1679g(b) that specify\nwhat a court shall consider in awarding punitive\ndamages?\nMR. McCONNELL: I don't think so,\nMr. Chief Justice. Most lower courts treat the right to\npunitive damages as a substantive right which would not\nbe waivable.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, well what --\nwhat if you don't want your arbitrator to consider those\nfour requirements? Could you waive particular aspects?\nI mean, that tells you that -- first of all, it says, of\ncourse, \"the court shall consider\"; but I take it your\nposition is when they say \"the court,\" they mean the\ncourt or arbitrator?\nMR. McCONNELL: It means the decisionmaker.\nMany statutes of course refer to things that courts\nmight do, even though those statutes can be vindicated\nin arbitration. Title VII, for example, has several\nprovisions in which it says, if the court determines\nthis, then it may do that, for example, issue\ninjunctions and so forth. I -- when you import the\nsubstantive provisions of a statute into an arbitration\nproceeding, everything that would be substantively\navailable from a court becomes available from -- from\nthe arbitrator. And that's the way I would read the\npunitive damages section here.\nI note, by the way -- if I might just\nrespond to a few of the points made by my friend in\nresponse to questions -- begin with Justice Sotomayor's\ninteresting question about the fact that the statute\nappears to make even offering a waiver, offering an\narbitration clause, a violation. It's actually even\nworse than that for two reasons.\nOne is that under their reading, a\nsettlement is surely just as much a waiver as an\narbitration is. Now, they say, oh, well, that only\nmeans post-dispute waivers. But that is not what this\nstatute says. This statute is about all waivers. In\ncontrast to other statutes previously enacted, like the\nADEA, which distinguish between pre-dispute and\npost-dispute waivers, this one does not. So, their\nposition suggests that even a settlement offer is a\nviolation of this statute.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, Mr. Nelson just\nsaid no, that their position doesn't suggest that, when\nI asked him about post-dispute and he brought up\nsettlement as well. He said that their interpretation\ndoes not exclude a settlement in which the plaintiff\nagrees --\nMR. McCONNELL: Well, Justice Ginsburg, that\nwas his answer, but what that tells us is that he is not\ngiving us a plain language meaning of the statute, which\nis all that they have, right? Their entire position is\nbased upon a plain language reading of the statute.\nRemember the way the Ninth Circuit begins its opinion by\nquoting Alice in Wonderland. It's -- it's all about\nplain language. But they do not offer us a plain\nlanguage interpretation of this statute. In order to\navoid absurd consequences like making settlement offers\na violation of the statute, they have to create\nexceptions, unspecified exceptions, to the text.\nIt would be much easier simply to follow the\nrules of construction that this Court had announced\nbefore this statute was enacted and against which\nCongress operated.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, one of those\nrules of construction is that you don't read statutes\nwhen -- to the extent they lead to absurd results. I\nmean, I think you can still say follow the plain\nlanguage, but that doesn't mean you go so far as to say\nyou can't enter into a settlement.\nMR. McCONNELL: I think it's easier, though,\nsimply to assume that Congress was using words in the\nway that this Court used them in Gilmer just a few years\nbefore, that that's a much more straightforward way of\nreading the statute.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure that a\nsettlement is a waiver anyway. It's a vindication. You\n-- you vindicate your right to a settlement. I don't\nknow that you waive it.\nMR. McCONNELL: Just as I think you can say\nthat when you go to arbitration, you vindicate the\nsubstantive rights of the statute as well. And, indeed,\nthis Court has used that very language in Mitsubishi\nwith respect to -- to arbitration.\nThe -- just a couple of other small points.\nMy friend points out that this is the first\nstatute in -- or that at the time of this statute in\n1996, that there had been no statute that explicitly\nbarred arbitration, which is historically true but I\nthink not particularly revealing. It was only in '85 in\nMitsubishi and then '91 in Gilmer that Congress became\naware that it needed to do this in statutory causes of\naction. In -- and by 1996, they were considering bills\nthat explicitly voided arbitration clauses. They\nweren't enacted, but this is for political reasons.\nRemember the political composition of Congress in 1996.\nIt is not surprising that statutes voiding\narbitration agreements become more common when the\npolitical composition of the Congress changes. This is\nfundamentally a political choice, and ought to be -- we\nought to respect the choices that Congress has made.\nUnless there are further questions, I will\nwaive the remainder of my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. McCONNELL: Unless it's an un-waivable\nright.\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You have no right to\ntime before the Court --\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
