DAYS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nA clearing futures commodity merchant, an\nFCM, such as Petitioner, has standing to sue contract\nmarkets and clearing organizations of contract markets\nunder Section 25 (b)(1) of the act for their bad faith\nfailure to enforce rules that are required by the act\nand by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The\ncourt of appeal's contrary ruling should be reversed for\nthree reasons, because it's contrary to the text of\n25(b)(1), it ignores the essential rule of clearing\nFCM's such as Petitioner recognized by the Commodity\nExchange Act, as well as long-standing industry rules\nand practices -- an assessment with which the expert\nFederal agency, the Commodity Future Trading Commission\nconcurs -- and it's in cross purposes with the goal that\nCongress sought to achieve in enacting an express\nprivate right of action in 25(b)(1) against contract\nmarkets, namely to ensure the existence of fair and\norderly markets through a system of effective\nsubregulation. The plain language of the Commodity\nExchange Act confers statutory standing on Petitioner to\nbring this private right of action against Respondents.\n25(b)(1) makes no reference to buyer or seller but\ninstead confers standing on any person who engaged -- a\nperson who engaged in any transaction on or subject to\nthe rules of a contract market or licensed board of\ntrade.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Days, can I interrupt\nyou there, and ask, if you would --\nMR. DAYS: Yes, Justice Ginsburg.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- if you would define\nthe transactions -- the particular transactions on which\nyou rely to come within that provision and what rules of\nthe exchange or the clearinghouse do you say was\nviolated?\nMR. DAYS: Justice Ginsburg, we view this as\nseveral subsidiary transactions that ultimately end in\nthe consummation of the contract, but with respect to\nthe rules that we have in mind -- first of all Rule 6\n(a) talks about -- that can be found in the blue brief\nat 1a -- that such contract executed or consummated by\nor through a member of such contract market. This is a\nclearing FCM that does this. And 6 (a), along with the\nknife rule, that is the contract markets rule 121(f) and\n306(i)(2), essentially indicate the following\narrangement: No contract can be dealt with or entered\ninto on a contract market without a guarantee from the\nclearing FCM. The FCM becomes the buyer and seller with\nrespect to that particular contract. It assumes that\ncontract and then, after assuming that contract, has to\nclear it immediately, indeed, within one hour. So\nthat's -- those are the rules under the statute and with\nrespect to the contract market.\nWith respect to the clearing\norganization, Rule 401(a), which is found at the red\nbrief at 6a, indicates that the clearing point, the\nclearing FCM is the point that deals with the clearing\norganization. And at that point, there's no\ncommunication, no contact -- no contract between the\ninvestor and the clearing organization. The clearing\norganization becomes the buyer and seller. In other\nwords, the contract is between a clearing FCM on one\nside of the contract and a clearing FCM on the other\nside of the contract. The clearing organization becomes\nthe buyer and seller, but before that happens, it's\nclear that the clearing organization views the clearing\nFCM as the party to the contract. It is not the\ninvestor. It is not any other party.\nThe important thing also about this\nprocess is that the clearing FCM is always financially\nliable from the very beginning of this transaction, this\nprocess, to the very end. That is, from the --\nexecuting the contract and the consummation of the\ncontract. For the Court of Appeals to talk about buyer\nor seller and treat a clearing FCM as a mere creditor or\nagent really misses entirely the role that clearing\nFCM's play in this process.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You think you --\nMR. DAYS: I think --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You've talked about\nthe transaction, but I also ask you, what were the rules\nthat the Defendants violated, the rules of the statute?\nMR. DAYS: Well, it's -- it is clear, as\nI indicated with respect to the rule of the contract\nmarket, that the clearing FCM is required to clear that\nparticular order or contract. And, therefore, at that\npoint, the clearing requires some information about the\nsettlement price. Here the allegation is that there was\nfraud at the point where the settlement price was set.\nThat then created a problem with the clearinghouse, and\nat the clearing process there was also a continuing\nviolation because at both points the contract market and\nthe clearing organization should have been applying\ntheir rules effectively and carefully, and we suggest\nhere that that was done in bad faith.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I think --\nMR. DAYS: The cause of action, we\nunderstand, requires that there be a showing of bad\nfaith.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is -- I don't want to\nreduce the issue down to something too simplistic, but\nis there a rule that says don't lie, don't commit fraud?\nMR. DAYS: Yes. In fact, the -- in order to\nbe a contract -- a market designated by the CFTC and by\nthe statute, there has to be a commitment to avoiding\nprice manipulation and cornering the market or various\nother things of that kind. So that's in the statute,\nand it's also subject to the rules of the CFTC. That's\na basic understanding. That's a given. Indeed, with\nrespect to the whole question of settlement prices and\nmargins, the understanding of those who participate in a\ncommodity futures market is that they will establish\ntheir margins with the expectation that those rules will\nbe applied fairly and firmly and in good faith.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Am I -- am I right that we\nreally do not have to --\nMR. DAYS: Excuse me?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Am I correct that we really\ndo not have to determine that issue this morning?\nMR. DAYS: What --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All we have to determine is\nwhether it is possible for the Petitioner here to be\nwithin the class of those with standing?\nMR. DAYS: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nMR. DAYS: This is a standing case, sir.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Days, suppose\nthat the exchange has a standard sort of\nnondiscrimination provision with respect to employment\npractices, and it -- an employee asserts that she was\ndiscriminated against in the promotion review. Would\nshe be covered by this provision?\nMR. DAYS: No, Your Honor. I think that\nCongress had in mind a limitation of the standing\nposition -- that is standing -- a right to those who\nparticipate in the process, when it talks about a person\nwho engaged in a transaction on or subject to the rules\nof the contract market --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I suppose the\ntransaction would be her annual employment review that\nshe alleges violated the exchange rule saying the\nexchange would not discriminate on the basis of sex.\nMR. DAYS: I don't believe that that would\nbe a transaction on or subject to the rules of the\ncontract market. She would not or he would not be a\nperson whose transaction, that is the employment\ncontract, would be carried out on or subject to the\nrules of the contract.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But suppose, to narrow\nthat hypothetical, that there's a rule that you can't be\nan employee of the clearinghouse or the exchange if you\nhave a conviction for fraud, and they don't -- they're\nnegligent and careless about enforcing that rule and\nthat fraud causes the loss. Under either your theory or\nthe government's theory, would there be liability, and\nis there a difference between those two theories?\nMR. DAYS: Well, the statute itself talks\nabout the responsibilities of the contract market or the\nclearing organization. And it describes transactions,\nand transactions are described broadly but not in a way\nthat would encompass the examples that you gave, Justice\nKennedy.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- so, the\ntransaction has some substantive limitation that is\nderived from where?\nMR. DAYS: Well, it's derived from the\nstatute, if one looks at Rule 2(i) in the statute. That\ndescribes transactions in a variety of ways. It's not\nin any of the appendices, but it can be located, I\nbelieve, on page 5 of the yellow brief, where we talk\nabout that and indeed the interpretation that was given\nby the Second Circuit in the Ken Roberts case, which we\nalso cite at that page in the yellow brief.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But in my hypothetical\nthere is a transaction and there are actual damages --\nI'm reading from -- from (b)(c). There's been a\ntransaction and the liabilities for damages sustained by\na person who engaged in the transaction or subject to\nthe rules of the buyer.\nMR. DAYS: Well, Justice Kennedy, I want to\nfocus on transaction. There's nothing that I've been\nable to find, nothing that the CFTC has indicated in\nthis respect that would cover the hypothetical that you\nand Chief Justice Roberts had mentioned. Theoretically,\nyes, but I don't think that -- in fact not\ntheoretically, yes, I would say the transaction does not\nincorporate those ancillary rules of an operation of a\ncontract market.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why aren't\nthese ancillary rules? When I think of a futures\nexchange market and the transaction, I think of the\nbuyers and the sellers, you know, the longs and the\nshorts, and this strikes me as just kind of the\npaperwork in the back office. Why is that, why should\nwe assume that's covered by the term \"transaction\"?\nMR. DAYS: Well, it is a broad definition,\nbut it focuses on the process of the execution and\nconsummation of the contract, not matters that are\nunrelated. I would view, as was indicated in the\nAmerican Agricultural Movement case, these people as\nnonparticipants in the operation of the core function of\na contract market.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: These people -- you\nmean the ones in our hypotheticals.\nMR. DAYS: That's correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Can I ask you -- I find it\ndifficult -- I'm finding it difficult to follow the\nexact language on page 4a of the appendix, of (b)(1)(C).\nTo you, that's probably the key provision, right? And\nthat's in the blue brief. And catch me when I read it\nwrong, if I do. As I -- as I see it, it says -- and\nhere it says \"a clearing organization.\" That's what we\nare interested in here, the clearing organization.\nMR. DAYS: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, a clearing\norganization that doesn't enforce a bylaw properly or a\nrule or reg properly, which is what you're saying\nhappened?\nMR. DAYS: Yes, sir.\nJUSTICE BREYER: The clearing organization\ngot all mixed and it all --\nMR. DAYS: Correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, they're liable for\nactual damages to a person who engaged in a transaction\nin a contract market. That's what it says. And the\ncontract market is the futures exchange.\nMR. DAYS: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Not the clearing\norganization.\nMR. DAYS: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And they're liable to that\nperson for the actual losses that resulted from his\ntransaction in the futures exchange --- as such\ntransaction.\nMR. DAYS: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So what your claim -- they\nwere caused by the failure of the clearinghouse to\nfollow its rules.\nMR. DAYS: Yes, sir.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If they just read that, we\nhave a case where the clearing organization didn't\nfollow its rules the -- my client engaged in a\ntransaction over the futures exchange.\nMR. DAYS: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And it was caused harm\nbecause the clearing organization didn't follow its\nrules. You say that's what it says.\nMR. DAYS: Yes, sir.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And that's what happened?\nMR. DAYS: Correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Did I understand that\ncorrectly?\nMR. DAYS: Yes. I don't know, Justice\nBreyer, whether you're heading toward the concern that's\nexpressed by the Respondents, namely that 25(b)(1) does\nnot contain in that second part of the statute a\nreference to a --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Clearing organization.\nMR. DAYS: -- clearing organization.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I know, but then the\nresponse I'm going to ask them is, so what?\nMR. DAYS: Well, I think that is -- \"so\nwhat\" is a proper response, I'm glad you said it rather\nthan I, that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I know you're going to --\nbut I --\nMR. DAYS: We have -- we have, we think,\nstanding with respect to a transaction that occurred on\nthe contract market even if the Respondents' argument is\npersuasive that it didn't happen on the clearing\norganization or subject to the rules of the clearing\norganization.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It would be an argument\nfor this case because that absence has been cured.\nWasn't that in the 2000 amendment that -- that they\nchanged the --\nMR. DAYS: That's correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the list to registered\nentity and which does include clearinghouse.\nMR. DAYS: Yes. Well --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So --\nMR. DAYS: Yes?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The concern on the\nother side, I take it, is that it's not just limited to\ntransactions on the exchange, but transactions subject\nto the rules of a contract market. And I understood\nyou, in response to the hypothetical that Justice\nKennedy posed, that you indicated that transaction has\nsome substantive limit to it, and if that's the case,\nwhich seems to me an awfully large concession, then we\nhave to figure out what the limit is. And it seems to\nme that it could just as easily be limited to the\ntransaction between buyers and sellers of futures\ncontracts as between all these subsidiary, ancillary,\ncollateral, whatever transactions that simply implement\nthat broader transaction.\nMR. DAYS: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, there\nare limitations with respect to 25(b)(1). As I\nindicated, nonparticipants in the market are not\nexplicitly covered by this, but also one has to\nunderstand that there has to be a showing of bad faith\nand there are no punitive damages. There are actually\ndamages and, therefore, this limits the extent to which\nthis provision can be used by someone who is not within\nthe category that I described.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Correct me if I'm wrong,\nbut you're going to be more favorable to this than I\nexpect your opponent. I mean, there is nothing really\nlinguistically or otherwise wrong if you had a statute\nthat said people in the badminton court have to play\ncarefully. And if they hurt somebody on the\nmerry-go-round, they are liable.\nAnd so people in the contract market have to\nplay carefully, and if they have hurt somebody over at\nthe futures exchange, they are liable.\nBut it says those people in the futures\nexchange are people who engage in a transaction on the\nfutures exchange.\nMR. DAYS: Yes, sir.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And so they said well, by\nodd fluke of fate, your clients didn't. It was the --\nrather, their client who actually went into the futures\nexchange and bought the commodity.\nYour point, I take it, is -- well that's\ntrue, but my client did something, he guaranteed that\ncommodity transaction in accordance with the rules of\nthe futures exchange, and that's what makes him a player\nin the futures exchange.\nMR. DAYS: Yes. As to him, yes --\nJUSTICE BREYER: He --\nMR. DAYS: -- that is right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: He guaranteed through the\nclearinghouse the payment of the contract made on the\nfutures exchange --\nMR. DAYS: That's correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- which he didn't make,\nbut he guaranteed it.\nMR. DAYS: Well, that's not correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: He made it.\nMR. DAYS: Well, that's not correct, Justice\nBreyer. The clearing --\nJUSTICE BREYER: He didn't walk on to the\nfloor and make it. It was his client who walked on to\nthe floor and said whatever. Is that right?\nMR. DAYS: Well, it's hard to know who walks\non what floor. I think what is clear about this\nindustry is that it is the clearing FCM who is always at\nthe center of this, the essential participant in this\nentire process.\nThe FCM's may not know who the customer is.\nThey certainly don't know who the customer is on the\nother side. The clearinghouse doesn't know who the\ncustomer is, or the investor is. So the investor\nactually plays a very small role other than putting up\nhis or her money at the beginning of the process.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. I mean the --\nthe market is about investors. It's about buyers and\nsellers. Now, you're -- the clearinghouse and these\nFCM's may or may not be covered by the language of the\nstatute, but it's an awful big stretch to say they are\ncentral to the market.\nWhat's central to the market are the\ninvestors. That's why they have these. They wouldn't\nhave this market for -- for your clients, I mean for the\nclearinghouse or anything else. The market is there for\nthe buyers and the sellers. That's the central\ntransaction.\nMR. DAYS: We don't argue that investors are\nbarred from bringing suits under 25(b)(1). They would\nbe persons who engaged in transactions on, or subject\nto, the rules of the contract market.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Didn't Judge Friendly\nrefer to the FCM as a central player or a principal in\n--\nMR. DAYS: Yes. That -- that's certainly\nbeen the case in Leist where Judge Friendly wrote the\nopinion. And also --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What is the transaction --\nwhat is the single transaction that you think brings\nyour client within this language?\nMR. DAYS: Well, I mentioned --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What is the transaction,\nthe guarantee?\nMR. DAYS: The one -- the contract market\nrequires that the clearing FCM clear a contract with one\nhour -- assume the contract. So the assuming of the\ncontract and the clearing required by the rules of the\ncontract market is a violation of the CEA.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not talking about what\nthe rule is that was violated. It says \"who engaged in\nany transaction on or subject to the rules of such\ncontract market.\" What is, in brief, \"the transaction\"\nyou're relying upon?\nMR. DAYS: Well, Your Honor, as indicated,\nthe transaction is the process of assuming this contract\nand then going toward the clearing -- clearing\norganization to clear it, and it's the clearing\norganization, setting the settlement price, which really\ndictates what happens on the clearing organization. So\nit's the setting of the settlement price which is the\nkey point.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The transaction does not\nrequire two parties?\nMR. DAYS: Well, there are two parties here.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You have a one-party\ntransaction?\nMR. DAYS: There is a -- we can view this as\none sole transaction, as one transaction with a number\nof subsidiary activities along the process between\nexecution and consummation, or one can view various\ntransactions that ultimately end up with the\nconsummation of the contract.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why isn't it just --\nMR. DAYS: I don't think it makes any\ndifference one way or another.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the guarantee, the\nrelationship between the clearing organization and the\nclearinghouse -- the clearing organization has to give a\nguarantee and has to put up margin?\nMR. DAYS: That's correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So there is a transaction\nbetween the clearinghouse and the clearing organization.\nMR. DAYS: Oh, absolutely. Well, they are\nsame thing. You mean the clearing FCM and the\norganization. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Days, we'll give\nyou a minute for rebuttal. Mr. Stewart.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART,\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING PETITIONER\nMR. STEWART: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nFor purposes of this case, the Court may\nassume that the word \"transaction\" in Section 25(b)(1)\nis limited to the purchase and sale of futures and\noptions contracts.\nThe Court may also assume that, in order to\nengage in such a transaction, a person must be a\nnecessary and direct participant in the transaction.\nEven under those --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where -- where do\nall of those assumptions come from? I would have\nthought the limitation of \"transaction\" beyond the plain\nlanguage would be a significant concession in this case.\nI mean --\nMR. STEWART: When I say \"assume,\" I am\nsaying that the Court need not decide at this point how\nfar, if at all, beyond the core transactions that occur\non contract markets the statute breaches. That is, with\nrespect to the hypothetical case of an exchange or a\nclearinghouse that has an anti-discrimination rule and\nis alleged to have violated that rule.\nYes, on the one hand, you could say that in\nliteral terms that is a transaction subject to the rules\nof the exchange. On the other hand, I think there is\nsignificant force to Respondents' contention that that\nseems very far afield from what was the core of\nCongress's concern. And with respect to the\nanti-discrimination hypothetical, there would also be\nthe argument that there is a different Federal statute.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So we have to figure\nout what was the core of Congress's concern and limit\n\"transaction\" in that way?\nMR. STEWART: I think the Court can at least\nstart from the assumption that Congress referred to\ntransactions on, or subject to, the rules of the\ncontract market. And none of the things that have been\nposited in the hypotheticals, the anti-discrimination,\nwould be transactions on a contract market.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But they would be\nsubject to the rules of the contract market.\nMR. STEWART: They would be subject to the\nrules. But our point here is that the United States and\nthe CFTC have not had occasion to decide how far, if at\nall, beyond the core transactions on the contract market\nthe statute extends.\nBut our point is, even if we look at the\ncore of what Congress was driving at, the buying and\nselling of futures options contracts, the clearing FCM\nis a proper plaintiff because it assumes direct\ncontractual liability to the clearinghouse. Even before\nthe clearing process is completed, it was defined as the\nbuyer or seller of the contracts in the NYFE rules, and\nits participation is essential.\nNow -- now, we have a somewhat different\nconception of the relevant transaction than does the\nPetitioner. In our view, when Eisler executed his\ntrades on the floor of the exchange, he set in motion a\nprocess that would quickly and inevitably culminate in\nthe clearing of the trades by the clearing organization,\nand at the end of the day there would be an array of\ncontractual relationships.\nKlein would have a contractal obligation to\nthe clearinghouse. The clearing FCM on the other side\nof the trade would have its own obligation to the\nclearinghouse. Klein would have an agreement with its\ncustomer, First West, that would entail rights and\nobligations running between them. And there would be a\nsimilar set of rights and obligations on the other side\nof the trade.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the argument\nthat if we accept your view of it, allowing the FCM to\nsue, then there could be multiple liability?\nMR. STEWART: I think that's incorrect. I\nthink the customer would also be an appropriate\nplaintiff, that is, the customer would have his own\nrights and obligations arising out of the -- the\ncontract with the clearing FCM. But the fact that they\nmight both be conceivable plaintiffs wouldn't mean that\nthey could both recover in the same case.\nRemember that the statute limits recovery to\nactual losses. So if the customer here, Eisler and\nFirst West, had paid the required additional margin to\nKlein, and Klein had discharged its obligation to the\nclearinghouse, Klein would still be a person who had\nengaged in a transaction. But Klein wouldn't be able to\nrecover because he would have suffered no actual losses.\nSo it's the person who bears the actual loss\nat the end of the day who would be the appropriate\nplaintiff.\nAnd the fact that in some cases that might\nbe the customer and in other cases it might be the\nclearing FCM doesn't mean that there would be\nduplicative recovery in a single case.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, when you began by\nsaying we could begin -- we could assume certain things,\nwas it included in the things that we could assume --\nwas it the proposition that the transaction was limited\nto a purchase or sale?\nMR. STEWART: A purchase or sale, although\nwe would extend -- I mean we would interpret the\nclearing process as part of the purchase or sale. And\nthe reason we would do that is that clearing occurs\ninevitably by operation of law, as it were. That is,\nonce Eisler executes his trades, Klein has no discretion\nas to whether to discharge its obligation to clear the\ntrades.\nKlein had previously entered into a\ncommitment to guarantee the trades that Eisler made.\nAnd, therefore, what -- Klein's obligations to the\nclearinghouse followed directly and inevitably from the\ninitial trade on the floor of the exchange.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Is that different from\nsaying under the exchange rule the FCM is actually the\nparty that enters into the trade.\nMR. STEWART: I think it is a different\nthing and there are two different bases on which the\nCourt could rule in our favor, that is, Rule 306(i)(2)\nof the rules of the exchange that were in effect at the\ntime of these trades specified that -- and that's\nreproduced, I guess, at page 14a of the blue brief. And\nit said -- a second sentence of Rule 306(i)(2) says\nevery such contract when made by a trading member shall\nbe made on behalf of a clearing member, who shall be the\nbuyer or seller of said contract on the terms set forth\ntherein.\nSo one way to rule for Klein in this case is\nto simply say even if we focus entirely on the moment at\nwhich the trade was executed, under the rules of the\nexchange, Klein was deemed to be the buyer or seller.\nBut we are also making the different argument and in a\nsense we think the more important practical argument,\nthat regardless of where the contract ran during the\nbrief period before the clearing process was\nconsummated, the salient factor is that at the\nconclusion of the clearing process, the clearinghouse\nwould look directly and only to Klein for satisfaction\nof any obligations arising out of unsuccessful trades.\nIn a sense the clearinghouse could be\nanalogized to a department store in which only the\nclearing members have charge accounts. And in order for\nanyone else to make a purchase, he has to make\nprearrangements with a charge account holder to have\npermission to charge things to his accounts. And that's\nessentially what was done here. In order for Eisler to\nexecute trades on the floor of the exchange, he had to\nhave the prior commitment from Klein that Eisler would\nbe allowed to charge trades to client's account.\nAnd in that situation, we think it's\nentirely natural to say that Klein engaged in the\ntransaction, even though Eisler was making the decisions\nas to exactly what trades to execute.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Stewart --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that why the Second\nCircuit was wrong in saying it was just like a\nsecurities broker?\nMR. STEWART: Yes. I think the Second\nCircuit's error was not really that it had a\nmisconception of how narrow or broad the private right\nof action is. The Second Circuit's error was that it\nmisunderstood the role that a clearing FCM plays in the\nprocess. The clearing FCM doesn't simply facilitate the\nformation of contracts between other people. The\nclearinghouse assumes direct contractual -- I'm sorry.\nI mean the clearing FCM assumes direct contractual\nliability to the clearinghouse.\nAnd that's fundamental to the operation of\nthe contract markets. That is, the point of the\nclearinghouse is to give investors assurance that if\ntheir trades are successful, they will get paid. And in\norder for the clearinghouse to pay the winners, it has\nto have confidence that it will be able to collect from\nthe losers.\nAnd the way that it has that confidence is\nby identifying a small number of people, clearing FCM's,\nwho have demonstrated financial wherewithal and\nintegrity, and saying we are going to look only to you\nto satisfy these obligations. We are not going to put\nourselves in the business of going after large, large\nnumbers of individual investors to ensure that losing\ntrades will be paid.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Stewart, may I go back\nto the question of multiple recoveries. And by that\nterm, as I understand it, the term does not mean\nduplicating recoveries. And I don't understand -- and\nthis is what I want you to explain -- why there couldn't\nbe a recovery in a case analogous to this both by the\nFCM and by the ultimate customer.\nLet's assume that the settlement price is,\nin fact, rigged. The FCM cannot meet the resulting\nmargin call and folds, and hence a situation like this.\nAnd this happens quickly enough so that the ultimate\ntransaction is never consummated. So that the -- the\ncontracting party on the FCM side of the trade doesn't\nget the benefit of what would have been a favorable\ncontract. Couldn't you have recovery in that case both\nby the customer and the FCM?\nMR. STEWART: I'm not sure if I -- if I\nfully understand the hypothetical.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It may be that I don't\nunderstand how it works.\nMR. STEWART: To answer a variant of it, I\nthink there could be cases in which both the customer\nand the clearing FCM recovered something. That is, say\nthere is a loss of a million dollars that's attributable\nto malfeasance by the exchange, and the customer comes\nup with half of that money -- $500,000. And the\nclearinghouse uses that to discharge half of its own\nobligation to the clearinghouse.\nNow, in that case, both the customer and the\nclearing FCM might have a cause of action for $500,000.\nSo there would be -- there could be multiple recoveries\nin the sense that you're describing.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But in my hypo, the FCM is\nclaiming damages because his business folds. So the\ndamages are not limited simply to those flowing from\nthis transaction itself. The customer is claiming\ndamages for failure to consummate a contract that would\nhave been favorable to him.\nMR. STEWART: If you assume that\nconsequential damage is arising out of the loss of the\nbusiness --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Right. And I am\nassuming --\nMR. STEWART: -- could be part of actual\nlosses, then there would be no barrier to each party,\nthe clearing FCM and the customer recovering what it\nactually lost.\nOur point is that there is no danger that\nbecause the clearing FCM is -- there is no danger that\nbecause the clearing FCM is liable for a million dollars\nto the clearinghouse and the customer is liable to the\nclearing FCM, each for a million dollars, that they will\nboth get a million dollars. It's only the person who\nbears the actual loss.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Stewart.\nMr. Pincus.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. PINCUS\nON BEHALF OF THE REPONDENTS\nMR. PINCUS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nI'd like to return to the language of the\nstatute, because I think it explains why the comments\nthat Mr. Stewart started with are, in fact, compelled by\nthe language of the statute. 25 (a) talks about a\nperson who engages in any transaction on or subject to\nthe rules of a contract market. And I'm focusing on the\n\"on or subject to the rules.\"\nIf the Petitioners claimed in their opening\nbrief any -- the fact that any transaction was governed\nby any rule, as in the Court's discrimination\nhypotheticals, was enough, then the \"on\" would be\nsuperfluous. There wouldn't be any need for \"on\",\nbecause surely a transaction on a contract market has to\nbe governed by the rules of the contract market.\nSo I think that shows why \"on or subject to\nthe rules of\" is a term of art. It has a special\nmeaning here. And the only kinds of transactions that\nare either on or subject --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but under that\nreading they should have used the word \"and\" rather than\n\"or.\"\nMR. PINCUS: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Or which is subject to.\nMR. PINCUS: Well, Justice Kennedy, I think\nwhat Congress was explaining there is it wasn't saying\nany transaction subject to the rules of a contract\nmarket, because that would be all of the Court's\nhypotheticals and discrimination and everything else,\nand the word \"on\" wouldn't be there. And so by using\n\"on\", which by definition \"on\" has to be subsumed in the\nrules because if a transaction is on a contract market,\nsurely is in some way governed by a rule.\nSo if Congress meant to cover every\ntransaction that is in any way governed by a rule, it\nwouldn't have had to include \"on.\"\nSo the reason -- the fact that \"on\" is there\nmeans, as we discussed in our brief, that this is a\nspecial transaction on or subject to the rules singles\nout a very special category of transactions. And that\n--\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. I'm not\nfollowing you. I think Justice Kennedy's question still\napplies. Your argument assumes that the \"or\" is an\n\"and.\" I mean, you don't need to have a transaction\n\"on\" at all. It can be simply one subject to the rules.\nMR. PINCUS: Yes. But the fact that\nCongress put \"on\" in there means that it was trying to\ncapture something other --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The fact that\nCongress put \"on\" in there and then followed it with\n\"or\" means you don't have to worry what \"on\" means if\nyou're subject to the rules of the contract market.\nMR. PINCUS: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. But I\nthink the reason that \"on\" is there is that Congress was\nsignaling that it wasn't, that the second part of the\nclause or \"subject to the rules\" didn't literally mean\nor subject to any rule, because if it literally meant\nthat, there would have been no reason to include \"on.\"\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This is like ejusdem\ngeneris argument. You're saying, we should interpret\n\"subject to the rules\" in the same light that we\ninterpret \"transaction\"?\nMR. PINCUS: No. This is an argument that\non or subject to the rules that a transaction on or\nsubject to the rules is a special kind of transaction.\nIt's a term of art in the statute, and a term of art\nthat refers to trades.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But even if it's a term of\nart, do you contend that client was not engaged in a\ntransaction subject to the rules.\nMR. PINCUS: Yes, we do. Your Honor, our\nview is that the transaction that is referred to there\nare the transactions that include, either at the trading\npit or a small category of off pit trades that are\npermitted by Section C of the Commodities Exchange Act.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What is the scope of the\nterm \"transaction\" in your view? What does it cover?\nMR. PINCUS: It covers the trade -- the\ncontract that occurs at the pit at the moment -- during\nopen when one --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: In fact between either the\nbuyer or the seller and the clearinghouse, not the\nclearinghouse, the FCM or whatever?\nMR. PINCUS: Well, FCMs may or may not be\ninvolved. In this case Klein wasn't involved, because\nEisler was a floor, had floor privileges and he\nactually -- he was the person who was at the pit\nengaging in these transactions. So our -- our view is\nthat the transaction, to start with that, either occurs\nat the pit when an offer is made, an open outcry, and\nit's accepted at that moment that transaction and --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And who are the parties to\nthe transaction?\nMR. PINCUS: The parties to that transaction\nare the buyer and seller, the customers, the people that\nthe --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And the intermediaries are\nnot subject to the transaction either though they are\nliable either for the purchase rights or the sale\nrights?\nMR. PINCUS: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: They are not parties to\nthe transaction.\nMR. PINCUS: They are not parties to the\ntransaction.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But you can expose them to\nmillions of dollars in liability.\nMR. PINCUS: At the moment, Your Honor, they\nmay not even be identified. At the moment that\ntransaction occurs --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But they are subject to\nliability if the transaction doesn't -- isn't\nconsummated.\nMR. PINCUS: Under the rules of the clearing\norganization. Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But the -- the buy and the\nsell contract will be worth nothing if it isn't cleared.\nMR. PINCUS: Well, it could -- what the\nclearing process does after the -- after that contract\nis formed is to eliminate, to provide a way to strip out\nthe credit risk that ordinarily wouldn't be there.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I know. But you want --\nyou want us to say that the clearing is no part of the\ntransaction, but the clearing is necessary to make a\ntransaction go forward. Otherwise the contract is just\na nullity.\nMR. PINCUS: No, Your Honor, we don't\nbelieve that the contract is a nullity. And in fact, if\nfor example a he contract was made at the pit, and for\nsome reason the -- the clearing member who was to clear\nthe transaction went bankrupt that day and didn't exist,\nand therefore that transaction was not cleared, that\ntransaction would still be enforceable as between the\nbuyer and the seller.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So they had to pick it up\nin an hour.\nMR. PINCUS: Well, it has to be cleared in\nan hour to go through the clearing process.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Fine. So therefore any\ntransaction wouldn't happen in your hypothetical,\nbecause if I understand it correctly -- the buyer and\nthe seller, who by the way are normally represented by\nclearing-houses by Klein, or by brokers like Klein, but\nin this case apparently they weren't -- they make the\ntransaction in the pit and then the rules of the\nexchange say that the clearing-house has to pick it up,\na clearing member within one hour, and at that point\nthat person -- the clearing member, the broker, I guess,\nthis Klein type person -- becomes legally responsible\nfor seeing that the money is put up.\nNow, it doesn't require a big stretch -- in\nfact, zero stretch, of the word transaction, to think\nthat word transaction covers that entire process. From\nthe moment -- and by the way the whole process is\ngoverned by the rules of the futures exchange -- so\nthere are rules in there. So why do you -- what reason\nis there for taking that word transaction, cutting out\nabout two-thirds of the important event, ignoring the\nfact that it is covered by the rule of the future\nexchange, and limiting it to the physical moment when\nsomebody enters the pit in an unusual case and says \"I\nbuy for\" -- and then another person says \"I sell for\"?\nMR. PINCUS: Well, let me first point out,\nYour Honor, it's not an unusual case. There frequently\nmay be a case even where -- either where -- even where\nboth sides are represented by floor brokers, where the\nfloor broker who is -- who is representing the party in\nthe trade is not the clearing member. That happens all\nthe time and that's why the rules say that the clearing\nmember doesn't have to even be designated until one hour\nafter the trade. So hard to say that the clearing\nmember engages in that transaction on the floor when\nhe -- when it may not be designated.\nThe reason for the division is that Congress\nset out a clear rule here. The transaction it referred\nto, it used the language that it used elsewhere, as we\ndiscuss in our brief, particularly in defining the\nfunctions of floor trader and floor broker.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Pincus, if your view\nwere correct it would have been so easy for Congress to\nsay \"buyers and sellers\" or even \"trade,\" but it used a\nword \"transaction\" that you say has a special meaning in\nthis context, but \"transaction\" appears all through the\nlaw and usually it's a term that has encompassing\nmeaning, like in the Federal rules \"any transaction or\noccurrence,\" and you would say that Congress has given\nit here this very constrained meaning.\nMR. PINCUS: We do say that, Your Honor.\nBecause -- let me address first your question about why\nCongress couldn't use buyer or seller. Here Congress\nhad to -- needed a construction that would link the --\nthe transaction that was being targeted with the rules\nof the -- of the contract market, because that was going\nto be the test here, was it's all about whether or not\ncontract market violated its rules, and so it needed a\nconstruction that referred to a transaction because\nthose are the things that are governed by the rules of\nthe contract market that might be misapplied in the\nwork -- in the way that A, B and C talk about.\nSo it would have had to -- even if it had\nused the phrase, you know, \"purchased\" or \"sold,\" a\ncommodity for future delivery or an option on a contract\nfor future delivery -- it would still have to say on or\nsubject to the rules of a contract market, in order to\nlink back to what it was doing, which was creating a\ncause of action for the violation of the contract\nmarkets own rules with respect to a transaction that was\nsubject to those rules.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why didn't it just say\nsustained by a buyer or seller? \"Shall be liable for\nactual damages sustained by a buyer or seller.\" Why --\nwhy would it need to be any more complicated than that?\nMR. PINCUS: Well, because it -- it would\nhave to talk about --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: When everything else is\nthe same, instead of \"a person,\" just \"buyer and\nseller.\"\nMR. PINCUS: Well, because then in the --\nseveral lines down it talks about actual loss and it\nwould have to say buyers and sellers there as well. And\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't know why.\nMR. PINCUS: Well, it would be referring\nback to buyer or seller. But I think the key here is\nfor Congress, given the structure of the act, \"any\ntransaction on or subject to the rules of the contract\nmarket\" is -- are these transactions. Those are the\nonly transactions that -- that meet that test. Those\nare the transactions, that very same phrase is used in\ndefining the functions of the floor broker and the floor\ntrader who execute the transactions on the floor, and so\nby using that phrase, Congress was tying back to\nsomething that it had a clear definition of. Let me --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Where is the clear -- there\nis no clear definition. There is no definition\nwhatsoever, anywhere, of \"transaction.\"\nMR. PINCUS: Well, there is no definition of\ntransaction, Your Honor, but in the definitions of floor\ntrader and floor broker, the phrase \"on or subject to\nthe rules of a contract market\" appears again in\ndefining what they do, and so those are the people who\nare at the pit, either executing for their own account\nor for a customer's account, the trades. And so by\nusing that very phrase in defining what they do -- which\nappears by the way on, in the discussion on pages 5 and\n6 --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Are they persons engaged\nin contracts subject to the rules -- are they persons\nengaged in transactions subject to the rules?\nMR. PINCUS: No, Your Honor, we don't -- we\ndon't think they are, because they are acting as --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Who are subject to the\nrules in your view? It doesn't include the FCM, it\ndoesn't include the broker, it doesn't include the\ntrader.\nMR. PINCUS: Well, certainly a floor trader\nis because that's someone who is trading for his own\naccount. A floor broker who's merely representing a\ncustomer is just like someone at a house closing, if you\ncan't make the house closing you appoint someone to\nclose the house. They aren't the ones who engage in the\ntransaction; you do.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Neither are they the person\nwho can end up personally liable, and -- I mean, they\ndon't have -- they are not subject to margin calls.\nThere is something very different about this set of\nrelationships from the broker/seller relationship in\nbuying and selling a house.\nMR. PINCUS: Well, those people also have --\nwell, the -- the floor broker is not subject to a margin\ncall. He is subject to liability for other things that\nhe may do wrong, but for his role as a floor broker he\nis not subject to margin responsibility.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You recognize that the\nSecond Circuit was wrong when it said that this FCM is\njust like a securities broker. He is just making a deal\nfor a commission. It seems to me that that -- that was\nnot proper.\nMR. PINCUS: Well, Your Honor, if that was\nall the Second Circuit said, I would agree with you that\nwould be wrong, but the Second Circuit recognized that\nthe -- Klein here had a risk, a credit risk because it\nhad backed up the credit of its customer, Eisler, and\nthat's why in the lessons learned report that the CFTC\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's not just Klein.\nIt's every FCM. That is the job of an FCM.\nMR. PINCUS: That is the job of the clearing\nmember of what an FCM does.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So that's not -- not\ncomparable to just a broker who executes my order for\nshares and gets a commission for it.\nMR. PINCUS: No, Your Honor, but as the\nSecond Circuit went on to note, the fact that there is a\ncredit risk here, that Klein is taking a risk based on\nthe credit of his customer Eisler -- as the CFTC noted,\nthere is nothing in the rules that require clearing\nmembers to only accept minimum margin, and it's the job\nof a clearing member to -- to look into both the\ncredit-worthiness of its customers and the risks of the\nvarious transactions that are open and demanding more\nmargin.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I was under the impression\nfrom the briefs, and maybe I'm wrong, that you did not\ndefend the reasoning of the Second Circuit. Am I right\nor wrong?\nMR. PINCUS: Well, we don't -- to the extent\nPetitioners claim that the Second Circuit based its\nreasoning on -- on the imputation into 25(b) of the\nlimitations in 25(a), we don't agree with that.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Which was the principal\nbasis for its decision.\nMR. PINCUS: But there was a second basis to\nits decision, which talked about the fact that Klein\ndidn't engage in trading, and we agree with that basis\nbecause that's what we're arguing here.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, on that subject and\nyou -- your client obviously has an institutional\ninterest in the case, assuming you don't prevail, is the\ngovernment's theory much broader and more undesirable in\nyour view than that offered in Klein brief? I didn't\nhave an opportunity to ask Mr. Days if he accepted the\ngovernment's position.\nMR. PINCUS: Well, it -- it certainly would\nbe better if the phrase \"transaction on or subject to\nthe rules of the contract market\" meant \"trade\" and we\nwere only discussing how expansive, how elastic the\ndefinition of \"trade\" was.\nWe would still take the position that it's\nnot elastic enough obviously to include clearing\nmembers, but we think that, given the language that\nCongress used and the fact that that language is used to\nrefer to that \"on or subject to\" formulation is\nrepeatedly used to refer to trades, we think it's very\nclear that trades have to be what it is. Otherwise,\nwhen the statute talks about the fact that a floor\nbroker engages in activities on or subject to the rules\nof a contract market, it could be talking about\ndiscrimination and all kinds of other activities. But\neven with respect to the narrower formulation urged by\nthe Solicitor General, we think that it is not right for\nseveral reasons: First of all the language of the\nstatute, as I said, but there's a clarity problem. If\nonce you move beyond that contract that is executed and\nbecomes complete on the pit, how far do you go? There's\nclearing before the contract is executed on the pit --\nat the pit. There may be antecedent activities -- for\nexample, someone who doesn't have floor privileges has\nto go through an FCM. There may be an introducing\nbroker that introduces that customer to the FCM or all\nof those activities which are specified in the statute\njust like the subsequent clearing activity is specified\nin the statute. Are they also shoe-horned into the\ndefinition of trade?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Pincus --\nMR. PINCUS: And that's where --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Justice Kennedy was\nasking you about the government's position. One of the\npositions -- one aspect of the government's position is\nthat -- that you would not dispute that a person who\nengaged in a transaction subject to the rules of a\nclearinghouse would be a proper plaintiff under the\ncurrent law. Well, certainly the FCM is a person\nsubject to the rules of a clearinghouse.\nMR. PINCUS: Yes, although obviously the\nparties haven't briefed the current law. We would take\nthe position that the current law doesn't change the\nequation and --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's what I thought\nyour position was. So that's not an accurate.\nMR. PINCUS: No.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- characterization.\nMR. PINCUS: No. Our position is, again,\nthe \"on or subject to\" language, we believe, quite\nclearly refers to trades and that Congress's technical\ncorrect substitution of registered entities doesn't\nchange that.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But you're saying that\nbecause a trade is on or subject to, the only thing that\ncan be on or subject to is a trade. And it seems to me\nthat that -- that's the point at which we have\ndifficulty following your argument. Why -- what is your\nreason, textual or otherwise, for saying that because a\ntrade is on or subject to, no other subtransaction can\nbe on subject to?\nMR. PINCUS: Because -- because trades are\nthe only thing that fit those two criteria. Only trades\nare -- can be under the statute either on the contract\nmarket, either because -- because they are executed at\nthe pit or so-called off-market trades as referred to in\nSection 6(c) -- very small categories of off-market\ntransactions --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But even if the --\nMR. PINCUS: -- that are the equivalent of\ntrades but can occur off-market.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But, Mr. Pincus, even if\nyou limit it to the word \"trades,\" it does not\nnecessarily follow that the only parties to the trade\nare the original buyer and the original seller. There\nare two intermediates who participate in the execution\nof the trade.\nMR. PINCUS: I agree, Your Honor, and that's\nthe second part of our argument. Once we reach the\npoint where it's trade, then the question is what does\ntrade mean? And --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Does it include this\ntransaction?\nMR. PINCUS: Well, we believe that it --\nthere are -- at the pit, again, that the transaction,\nthe on transaction, the transaction that occurs on, is\nthe open outcry transaction where, in this case, Eisler\nmade an offer and some other floor trader accepted it,\nand that was complete there. Klein has no role in that\ntransaction, and clearing members do not have a role in\nthat transaction.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Why do you say --\nMR. PINCUS: They come in later.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Why do you say that Klein\nhad no role in it? It was an indispensable party to the\ntransaction.\nMR. PINCUS: It was a subsequent party. It\nhad subsequent role --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Before it was completed he\nparticipated, he was -- he functioned as a guarantor.\nMR. PINCUS: Well, it was not -- it need not\nbe clear at the moment of that the trade is executed at\nthe pit who the clearing member will be. Often it won't\nbe.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It was cleared by the time\nit was over.\nMR. PINCUS: No -- well, it depends what you\nmean by \"over,\" Your Honor. What happens in the\nprocess, if I can just lay it out for one minute, is the\ntransaction occurs at the pit. It's recorded. The\nclearing member --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: There is no distinction\nbetween A and D, but before it can be consummated B and\nC have to play a role.\nMR. PINCUS: Well, that activity is over.\nI'll try to use neutral words. That activity at the pit\nis over. The next -- that data, who bought, who sold,\nand maybe the clearing members for those two parties are\nidentified. Maybe they're not. They might not be\nidentified for an hour according to the rules. So\nsomething happened at the pit. It's then entered into\nthe computers, and at some subsequent point, yes, the\nclearing members will be identified and the trade will\nbe cleared.\nOur point is that is subsequent activity.\nThat is activity -- that's the clearing process. It's\nimportant, but there is enforceable contract before the\nclearing event occurs. Nothing in the rules say that\nthe contract is unenforceable.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's true, but is there\nany reason that the word \"transaction\" would have --\nserves a purpose by being so limited?\nMR. PINCUS: It does, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What -- what Congress would\nCongress have wanted to do that?\nMR. PINCUS: In -- because in the\nenvironment that Congress was operating just following\nthis Court's decision in Curran, the focus entirely was\non protecting investors.\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's not a reason. I\nwant to know what reason, what harm will be done if in\nfact we take the word \"transaction\" and say the word\n\"transaction,\" while it's capable of the interpretation\nyou give, is also capable of an interpretation that\nincludes all the near contemporaneous events, including\nthe financing and guarantees? Like a mortgage in\nselling a house.\nMR. PINCUS: Because --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And that also is\nlinguistically possible. What harm will be done --\nMR. PINCUS: The harm that will --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- if the second is chosen\nand not the first?\nMR. PINCUS: The harm -- two categories of\nharm: First, a lack of clarity. We don't know, as I\nsaid, how far back are we going. The statute requires,\nfor customers that are not trade, not exchange members,\nthey have to go to an introducing broker. They have to\ngo then to an FCM.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the only one that has\nthis relationship that's different from an ordinary\nbroker, the only one is the FCM.\nMR. PINCUS: But that's true, Your Honor,\nbut if the Court were to adopt a rule that says we're\ngoing to read \"transaction\" broadly, and so anyone who\nhas anything to do with any aspect of the trade, either\nbefore it or afterward, is covered, all of these\nantecedent people, just in terms of the statutory\nlanguage, are people who have a role.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But they're not people\nwho are at risk. I mean if there -- if it's a broker\nwho was just executing a trade for a commission is not\nat risk, but this FCM is at risk, in this transaction,\nseries of transactions.\nMR. PINCUS: But it's hard to see in the\nlanguage where Congress would have drawn the line. I\nthink the problem is the lack of clarity. We certainly\nwon't know, if the Court says we are going to move\nbeyond this core transaction and encompass some of the\nancillary activities --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I got that.\nMR. PINCUS: Okay.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I got that when you said\nthere were two. What's the second?\nMR. PINCUS: Well, let me just add to the --\nto the first that there are subsequent activities.\nThere also are arrangements set up with banks that\nautomatically supply margins, that facilitate\ntransactions. And so the question will be, aren't those\nbanks who play an important liquidity role, aren't they\npart of a transaction?\nThe second reason is the reason involved --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The answer would be\nthat those transactions are not subject to the rules of\nthe exchange.\nMR. PINCUS: Well, they are --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They don't care what\nkind of arrangement the FCM might have with its bank.\nThat's up to the FCM. There's no exchange --\nMR. PINCUS: But it has to have an\narrangement, and that fact is a rule of the exchange.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there some --\nMR. PINCUS: So it depends what rule.\nAgain, we're --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Pincus --\nMR. PINCUS: -- on the rule where we're not\ngoing to know what the answer is.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The -- the agency that's\nsupposed to be the supervisor of this area, the CFTC, is\ntaking the position that the government presented to us\ntoday. Apparently, it doesn't have the concern that you\nhave just expressed about reaching people who are not\nthemselves subject to the regulation of the exchange,\nthe clearinghouse.\nMR. PINCUS: Well, I think it does have that\nconcern, Justice Ginsburg, which is why Mr. Stewart said\nthat the Court should sort of take this case on certain\nassumptions because, as he recognized, the theory that\neven the government put forward in its brief --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that what he\nwas telling us was that, even if you assume that Klein\nhas that, even if you've assume that.\nMR. PINCUS: Well, it's certainly their\nposition that Klein has standing, but in terms of the\nconsequences of a ruling by the Court that the statute\ngoes beyond the core activity, I think the government's\nsuggestion sort of shows that even the government is not\nsure, once you embark on that exercise, where the\nboundary line is. And I would point out the government\nis not asking for deference in this case nor could it.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think you still\nowe Justice Breyer his second reason.\nMR. PINCUS: I do, Your Honor, and the\nsecond reason is involved in the government's response\nto Justice Souter's question about multiple recoveries.\nIf all of these various people can assert\nclaims, then there is certainly a risk, and a\nsignificant risk, that all of these various people will\nassert different kinds of monetary harm that they will\nclaim is actual loss.\nIn this case the principal, actual loss, as\nwe discussed in the second argument in our brief, is\nclaimed as the loss from the destruction, allegedly\ncaused from the destruction, of Klein's business.\nIf there was a bad-enough event on an\nexchange, all of the people in this -- in the row from\nthe introducing broker down to the end, down to the\nbank, could claim that, because there was a foul-up in\nthe electronic reporting system and trades were\nmisreported for a week and, when they were unwound, the\nconsequences of that where lots of bankruptcies in the\nfutures industry, that all of those liabilities get\npegged to the contract market. As -- as the FIA --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Aren't there lots of\nsituations in which a various -- serious -- harms a\nwhole bunch of people, and they all recover?\nMR. PINCUS: There are, Justice Stevens, but\nthis is a particular kind of industry. As the -- as the\nFutures Industry Association notes in its brief, every\nday more than $5 trillion worth of contracts are traded\non futures exchanges. There is a huge amount of\nconcentrated risk in contract markets.\nIf the contract markets are going to be made\nliable to a vast array of people, there is a very\nserious risk that financial jeopardy --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You would agree if the\nclient had been trading on its own account with a\nscalper, it would have been able to recover for the --\nfor its loss to itself; right?\nMR. PINCUS: Yes, if it had been trading for\nits own account.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: If it's trading for itself\nand some for other customers, it only can recover half\nof those. Does that make sense?\nMR. PINCUS: Yes, it does, because Klein is\na market insider. It has ways to protect itself other\nthan suing the contract market.\nIt can certainly sue its customer. It has\nways of protecting itself, as the CFTC report said, in\nterms of demanding more margin, in terms of watching the\nrisk in its customer's portfolio, in terms of -- of\nhedging its own risk. It's an insider, and it can do\nthat.\nWhat Congress was concerned with here -- and\nthe reason our construction of the statute makes sense\n-- is that it protects the outsiders, the PC investors\nwho are at the core of the concern here, without\nimposing a broad array of liability on the contract\nmarkets, who are in the middle of a huge, huge amount of\nfinancial risk, which really puts them in the position\nof shouldering risk that's intolerable.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there instances where\nmultiple parties who are injured sue under state law, or\nis this generally deemed preemptive, or it just doesn't\nhappen, or --\nMR. PINCUS: Well, there are options. I\nmean one of the things that Klein says here is that this\nis its only option. It can go to the FTC.\nIn this case, for example, the FTC order\nagainst Eisler assessed a civil penalty but then said\nthe order could be -- it said that obligation could be\nfufilled by paying the injured parties. Klein -- to the\nextent Klein has an injury, the FTC -- the CFTC in a\nsimilar case could do the same thing. There are state\nlaw claims. There are --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Pincus, will you\nsatisfy me on one point. I -- I understand your\nargument about what \"transaction\" means. But even if I\naccept that argument, explain to me again why \"or\nsubject to the rules\" doesn't add anything?\nMR. PINCUS: Well, it does. It adds -- in\nour construction \"the transactions that are on\" are the\ntransactions that occur on the floor. The transactions\nthat are \"subject to the rules\" are the ex-pit\ntransactions.\nOnce you say \"or subject to the rules\"\ninvolves more than ex-pit trades, off-exchange trades,\nthen you're into the world of the Court's hypotheticals\nto Mr. Days of anti-discrimination rule.\nSo it has to have a limited meaning; and, by\ncoupling it with \"on,\" we think that Congress made clear\nit was referring to trades.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why wouldn't it have been\nenough to just say \"transactions on\" if that was their\nmeaning? Why did -- did they --\nMR. PINCUS: Because then you wouldn't\ncapture a category -- because then Congress would have\nleft out a category of trades. Congress meant to\ncapture investors who trade. There are two categories\nof transactions that meet that test: Those that occur\non the exchange, on the -- physically on the pit, and\nthose that are within the industry called off-exchange\nor off-pit transactions defined in Section 6(c) of the\nact -- of the -- of the statute.\nAnd so by -- the second phrase is meant to\ncapture those trades that may involve investors but\ndon't occur at the pit.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But I take if -- if your\nultimate, let's say, policy reason for confining it to\nthat is the -- is the policy against multiple recovery.\nMR. PINCUS: Yes. The policy reason is the\nrisk of multiple recoveries in an area where there is a\nhuge amount of risk. The contract market is at the\ncenter of things, of these $5 trillion a day. And so\nCongress wrote very carefully, and Congress's focus was,\nin the wake of Curran -- and given what it said -- was\ninvestors.\nBecause the -- the implied cause of action\nthat the Court recognized in Curran was all about\ninvestors. The rationale --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Their current argument is,\nbasically, that's all Congress was thinking about.\nMR. PINCUS: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But, as I understand your\nposition, it's something more. Congress was also\nthinking probably about multiple recovery, and it didn't\nwant that. And we will impute that intent to Congress\nbecause multiple recovery would be a very bad thing for\nthe industry. That's basically your argument.\nMR. PINCUS: Yes. That is our argument.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.\nMR. PINCUS: Um, let me say a word about the\nrules and whether the rules are relevant here. It seems\nto us that Congress used a phrase in the statute, and\nthat it -- that that cannot be changed by a rule that\nsays -- if an exchange adopted a rule that said some\ntransaction was on, or subject to, the rules of it, that\nwouldn't be enough to put it into the statutory\nlanguage. The test is what Congress meant. Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Pincus. Mr. Days, you have a minute.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DREW S. DAYS\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. DAYS: Your Honors, Mr. Pincus has\nidentified what he views as some temporal gap between\nthe entering into a contract and the involvement of this\n-- the clearing FCM. That simply is not the case.\nKlein had a prior commitment to clear\nEisler's trade; so even at the time that Eisler was\ntrading, that had to be done with the understanding that\nKlein was going to back him up.\nIf one looks at the gray brief at page 21,\nit references to the rule of Knight -- rules of Knight\n116 and 118 that make this very clear. The story is, as\nwe've indicated, that throughout this process the\nclearing FCM is financially liable and, therefore, is on\nthe hook.\nWhen Congress enacted the statute, it was\nconcerned with protecting the public and maintaining\ncredibility. We think that this cause of action, this\nexpress cause of action for allowing FCMs to sue, is\nmost reliant to the objectives of Congress: The\nfaithful execution by an FCM that deals directly with\nthese entities, the clearinghouse and the commodity\ncontract market. Thank you very much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Days.\n"
