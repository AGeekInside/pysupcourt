JONES\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. JONES: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please\nthe Court:\nFederal employment taxes owed by a partnership\nwere assessed by the commissioner, and when the\npartnership failed to pay the taxes, the United States\nbrought this action to recover the taxes against the\nindividual partners who were derivatively liable under\nState law for all debts of the partnership, including its\ntax debts.\nQUESTION: Did the Government have to wait until\nthe partnership failed to pay? Could it have proceeded\nimmediately against the partners under -- under the\ngoverning State law?\nMR. JONES: You've addressed an -- an unanswered\nquestion that isn't presented here, of course. It's\nunanswered because Federal law --\nQUESTION: It -- it's not presented, depending\non what you mean by derivative liability. I -- I always\nthought that derivative liability would be liability that\ndoesn't attach unless and until the person primarily\nliable fails to -- fails to pay up.\nMR. JONES: And -- and I agree with that, and --\nand the Uniform Partnership Act, which California has\nadopted, contains a provision that specifies that the\ncreditor must exhaust his efforts to recover from the\npartnership before he can recover from the partners.\nQUESTION: I see.\nMR. JONES: And -- and so that's what makes it\nclear this is indeed a derivative secondary liability.\nQUESTION: You think maybe the United States may\nnot be bound by that. You -- you don't want to -- you\ndon't want to concede that the United States is bound by\nthat.\nMR. JONES: It's not so much I don't want to\nconcede. I don't feel that I'm able to concede that not\nbecause it is related to this case, but because of a -- a\nstructural intellectual problem about the extent to which\nwhose law governs in that situation. If it's a\nlimitations provision, we know Federal law governs when\nthe United States is bringing a claim that it acquires in\nits sovereign capacity. Whether this would be regarded as\na procedural restriction that the State substantive law\ndidn't -- now, whether you want to think this is\nsubstantive or procedural may affect the answer to the\nquestion -- the hypothetical that you've raised.\nQUESTION: Well, can you tell me as a matter of\npractice if -- if you know? Suppose there's a partnership\nwhich is a little murky. It's in the Cayman Islands and\nthey're behind, but that one of the -- the general\npartners is in California. Can you just proceed against\nhim, do you know? Does the Revenue Service ever do that?\nMR. JONES: Well, there --\nQUESTION: -- ever do that?\nQUESTION: There -- there is an -- the uniform\n-- in the case law, there's a discussion of situations\nwhere the partnership is known to be insolvent. You're\nnot required to do a senseless act. You're not required\nto pursue and exhaust against the partnership when it's\nknown to be insolvent. So in that situation, you have\nexhausted because the partnership is insolvent.\nQUESTION: And I take it in that situation --\nyou correct me if I'm wrong -- but you can't just levy on\nthe account if the tax has not been assessed against that\npartner individually, but you can commence some other\nsorts of proceedings which would allow a subsequent levy.\nOr am I wrong, or is that clear?\nMR. JONES: Well, you've brought me through --\nto a lot of levels of complexity, but I think the answer\nto the question is we -- we don't dispute that you need to\ngive a -- a notice of assessment in order to collect\nadministratively through liens and levies. That's not\nrelevant to this case because this is a judicial\ncollection case.\nQUESTION: Of course.\nMR. JONES: But, nonetheless, there is case law\nthat says that when you give notice to the partnership of\nits liability, that's sufficient as constructive notice to\nthe partners to permit administrative collection through\nliens and levies.\nQUESTION: Mr. Kent, if you're not right about\nthat and you do have to have individual notice and demand\nto the partners, then there's a consequence other than\nliens and levies, isn't there, where you have whopping\npenalties and interest attached? I thought if you don't\ngive notice and demand within the 60-day period, then not\nonly can't you impose liens, but that the interest and\npenalties stop running.\nMR. JONES: I'm -- I'm familiar with the -- the\nconcept of interest doesn't run until notice of the\nassessment is made, but nonetheless again, notice to the\npartnership would be constructive to the partners.\nQUESTION: But if you're wrong about that\nconstructive notice, then you could still say, well, the\nstatute has been extended 10 years because of the\nassessment. However, one might conclude that the interest\nstops running and that you can't use administrative\ncollection procedures.\nMR. JONES: Well, I -- I don't mean to be -- I\ndon't mean to sound like I'm retreating from that issue.\nI'm just -- it's not presented here, and so I'm not really\ncapable standing here --\nQUESTION: Well, it would be to the extent on --\nif -- if this thing is remanded with instructions that the\nassessment counts against all of them, that there would be\nthe question remaining about the interest and penalties.\nMR. JONES: That's -- I don't -- it is possible,\nand if the Court were to reverse and remand for further\nproceedings, it's possible that that issue would be\nraised.\nQUESTION: Are you -- are you saying that we\nshould maybe flag it but not decide it? Is it --\nMR. JONES: I don't -- I don't know what your\npractice would be. I would think your practice would be\nto decide the issue that's presented. You could note\nother issues haven't been raised, but since those issues\nhaven't been briefed here, we're not really in a position\nto advise you on their proper resolution.\nQUESTION: Why don't you go ahead with the\nissues that are presented?\nMR. JONES: Okay. Well, the point I was making\nwas that the court ruled against us because they said that\nthe partnership taxes had not been assessed directly\nagainst the partners. But respondents now correctly\nconcede that there is no requirement of Federal law that a\nderivative or secondary State law liability to pay a tax\nhas to be assessed before it can be collected, and that\nconcession is plainly correct in light of this Court's\ndecision in 1933 in the Leighton case where the Court held\nthat a derivative or secondary liability that arises under\nState law to pay a tax may be recovered -- and I quote --\nwithout assessment of that liability. And there are\nnumerous cases that have applied that principle in -- in\nrelated secondary and derivative liability contexts.\nAnd as -- as I've already indicated, those\nprinciples plainly apply here because under the Uniform\nPartnership Act, which applies in California, the\nliability of the partner is derivative for the -- and\nsecondary rather than principal, as I've discussed with\nJustice Scalia. Not only is it clear from the legal\nstructure of the UPA, but the official comments to the --\nof -- to that act state that the liability of the\npartnership for partnership debts is principal and that\nthe liability of partners is -- is in the nature of a\nguarantor. It's secondary. It arises only when the\npartnership doesn't pay its own debts.\nFederal law also makes clear that this is a\nliability that attaches directly to the partnership. This\nis a Federal employment tax. It applies to employers\nbecause, under California law, the -- the partnership is a\nseparate and distinct legal entity. It is the employer.\nIt pays the wages. Its payment of wages is what causes\nthe taxes to be imposed.\nQUESTION: But you -- you agree that it's the\nlaw of California that imposes the derivative liability on\nthe partners?\nMR. JONES: That's the way the cases describe\nit. From my -- and that's the way this Court described it\nin -- in Commissioner v. Stern.\nQUESTION: What more do you want?\nMR. JONES: Pardon me?\nQUESTION: I say what more do you want.\nMR. JONES: Well, I don't want more. I'm just\nbeing finicky I guess, because to me we -- the Court in\nCommissioner v. Stern said that these -- historically\nthese are substantive liabilities that Congress accepts\nfrom State law. And therefore, the Court applies the\nsubstantive body of State rules in -- in implementing that\nliability.\nYou could also think of this -- and I'm not\nasking the Court to reconsider Commissioner v. Stern. But\nyou can -- even in light of Commissioner v. Stern, you can\nthink of this as Federal law borrowing State law for this\nremedial purpose, and Congress has sanctioned that by not\naltering the principles that have long existed on this.\nThe -- but the -- the point that this Court made\nin Leighton is that these principles that they apply come\nfrom State law and you don't a -- actually respondents now\nadmit there's no mechanism in Federal law to assist this\n-- assess this sort of secondary derivative State law\nliability, and that's correct. That's what the Court\naddressed in the Leighton case. And the court of appeals\nin this case just misapplied those well-accepted\nprinciples.\nOnce the assessment of the partnership taxes was\nmade, under section 6502 the United States has 10 years\nfrom the date of the assessment to bring any proceeding in\ncourt to collect the taxes. And in the Updike case in\n1930, the Court held that that 10 years applies not only\nto actions against the directly liable party but also to a\nperson whose liability is derivative or secondary and\narises from State law. And the Court explained that the\nbroad purpose and broad text of 6502 applies equally in\nboth cases because in the Court's words, in a real sense\nthe action against the derivatively liable party is a\nproceeding in court to collect the tax. As the Court said\nin Updike, the aim in the one case, as in the other, is\nthe same. It's to collect the tax liability.\nNow, in this Court respondents do not dispute\nthat accepted understanding of 6502. Instead, they raise\nhere a new and, indeed, a radical claim that no court has\nadopted and that they did not raise prior to their merits\nbrief in this Court. What they argue now for the first\ntime is that the Federal statute of limitations should not\ngovern this derivative liability claim because since it\nstems from substantive State law, the State statute of\nlimitations should govern it. Now, since they didn't\nraise that claim at any time before their merits brief in\nthis Court -- and it is a statute of limitations which is\nan affirmative defense -- they're -- they've waived the\nclaim as too rate to -- too late to raise it.\nBut nonetheless, I think it is important to note\nthat their claim is plainly inconsistent with this Court's\ndecisions. For example, in the Summerlin case, this Court\nheld that whenever the United States acquires a claim\nacting in its governmental capacity, that claim of the\nUnited States is not subject to a State statute of\nlimitations because of the sovereign rights -- sovereign\nimmunity of the United States. And they applied that\nholding in Summerlin to a situation where what the United\nStates obtained was a right to enforce a private note and\nprivate mortgage that the --\nQUESTION: May I interrupt for this question?\nYou know, there are some State statutes of limitations\nthat -- or some States have limitations provisions that\nare either affirmative defenses or some are, in effect,\nconditions precedent to bringing an action. If California\nhad the latter form of action, how would you decide this\ncase?\nMR. JONES: I think that in -- in Commissioner\nv. Bresson where the Ninth Circuit addressed that very\npoint, they -- they were -- they wrote a very useful\nopinion that seems to me to be perfectly correct, that the\n-- that if it is the passage of time after the United\nStates acquires its right that causes the claim to expire,\nthat that is what is barred by the Summerlin rationale\nbecause the sovereign rights of the United States can't be\nextinguished. And so whether you think of it as\nextinguishing the claim or limiting the -- the period of\nrecovery, in either event what's instrumental is that the\n-- the United States had the right at the time it obtained\nthe claim and that the State law could not thereafter cut\nthat right off.\nQUESTION: Why not? Why -- why -- suppose that\nyou have a -- a bank that guarantees a debt, and the debt\nis Smith's debt. And the guarantee is to pay, including\ntax debts. That's what it says. It was a condition of\nthe borrowing or some other thing. Now, why wouldn't\nState law govern the period of time in respect to which\nany creditor, including the Government, has to assert a --\na claim under that note, let's say, or under that\nparticular written guarantee since the liability there is\na creation of State law and the State would have the right\nto define its contours? And after all, that guarantor is\nnot the taxpayer. The -- the guarantor's liability arises\nsolely out of the fact that he happens to have entered\ninto a note with a guarantor who promised to pay.\nMR. JONES: So you're talking about a -- a\nprivate contractual right --\nQUESTION: Yes. Say a private --\nMR. JONES: -- that the United States somehow\nobtained rights under by --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. JONES: -- levying, for example --\nQUESTION: Yes, yes.\nMR. JONES: -- on the -- on the right.\nQUESTION: Yes, yes, and then I'm going to say\nwhy isn't this that.\nMR. JONES: That's -- that's a -- that's exactly\nfrankly what happened in Summerlin --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. JONES: -- except Summerlin involved a\nhousing program instead of the Internal Revenue Code. In\nSummerlin, the Government obtained a private note and\nenforced it, regardless of the State statute of\nlimitations, and the Court's reasoning was that the --\nthat the United States as sovereign cannot be subject to\nlimitations imposed on the rights that it obtains.\nQUESTION: So if I -- if I enter into a promise\nwith you and say in return for my lending, you know,\nwhatever it is, I -- I promise that I will pay your tax\ndebts, but by the way, I don't want to pay any tax debt\nthat isn't definite before January the 5th, 2004 or 2010.\nI don't want to pay anything that arises --\nMR. JONES: It's a limit -- if you're talking\nabout a substantive limitation in the document itself,\nwell, the United States takes its -- stands in the shoes\nof the assignor in that situation, and we don't get a\nbetter substantive right -- substantive right.\nQUESTION: Okay. So it's a substantive\nprocedural distinction.\nMR. JONES: Well, certainly that's the way the\nCourt has looked at it, and I --\nQUESTION: But you know, in -- in other cases,\nlet's say when the -- when the Federal Government creates\na Federal right without establishing a statute of\nlimitations for that Federal right, State law does not\ngovern, but Federal law looks to the -- to the State\nstatute of limitations as a matter of Federal law. I\ndon't know why it wouldn't be the same thing with respect\nto a -- a Federal claim. You mean there is no statute of\nlimitations whatever on Federal claims?\nMR. JONES: No. Well, that's the second route\nthat the Court has used to say the State's limitations\ndon't control, and that is, when there's a Federal\nlimitations period that applies to the claim, then the\nState provision doesn't control.\nQUESTION: Of course.\nMR. JONES: And under -- under Updike, what this\nCourt concluded in Updike was that there is a Federal\nstatute of limitations that applies to these proceedings\nin court to collect the taxes, which includes the\nderivative claim.\nQUESTION: Well, that -- that's fine. But I'm\ntalking about the more general proposition that -- that\nyou're -- that you're defending or -- or proposing that --\nthat State law does not -- never -- never applies to a --\nto a Federal claim.\nMR. JONES: Well, it doesn't --\nQUESTION: I mean, a claim by the United States.\nMR. JONES: It doesn't --\nQUESTION: I think it does. Now, it may not\napply of its own force.\nMR. JONES: Exactly.\nQUESTION: But it applies because of adoption by\nthe United States.\nMR. JONES: If the -- if the Court were to find\nit appropriate in a particular instance to adopt a State\nrule, that would not interfere with Summerlin, but that\nwould -- that would -- I can't think of a case exactly\nlike that. There may well be some.\nBut most Federal claims --\nQUESTION: I can't imagine our not doing it. I\ncan't imagine our saying that, you know --\nMR. JONES: Most --\nQUESTION: -- the clock keeps ticking on Federal\nclaims forever and ever.\nMR. JONES: Most Federal claims come within some\ngeneral statute of limitations, and this is certainly a\nsituation like that.\nQUESTION: Is it -- is this question really\nacademic in this case because you have not one but two\nFederal limitations, one, the regular 3-year period, then\nthe extension by 10 years following an assessment?\nMR. JONES: Well, I think the Updike case makes\nthis discussion somewhat hypothetical, and I understood\nJustice Scalia's question to be in that vein.\nQUESTION: But here, what you're relying on are\nthe Federal limitations period. So you don't need to\nworry about suppose there had been no Federal limitations.\nMR. JONES: I -- I don't need to worry about\nthem, and I -- but I'm only addressing them because\nrespondents have raised them at this point in the case,\nand so I'm just discussing the two theories that this\nCourt has applied in rejecting that kind of contention.\nQUESTION: You're saying it's doubly\nhypothetical because they can't raise the whole issue --\nMR. JONES: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- at this point anyway.\nMR. JONES: Yes, sir.\nQUESTION: I thought their primary position,\nthough, was that the partners are not secondarily liable,\nthey're primarily liable, so that they are the taxpayer\nand they're entitled to assessment notice and demand.\nMR. JONES: That is now clearly their primary\nposition, and for the reasons I've already described that\nposition can't be reconciled with the Uniform Partnership\nAct or with -- or with the Federal law that applies to\nthese taxes.\nQUESTION: Can you -- can you tell me in the\ncase of a corporation, if the responsible officer does not\nwithhold employment taxes, I -- I take it -- I thought I\nremembered that -- that the responsible officer is\npersonally liable. Or am I wrong about that?\nMR. JONES: Yes. There is a statute that\nauthorizes an assessment of that liability against a\nresponsible officer.\nQUESTION: Ah, but you have to assess it.\nMR. JONES: It -- it authorizes the assessment.\nThat's -- you know, it's interesting. There are certain\ntypes --\nQUESTION: Can -- can you proceed against the\nresponsible officer without the assessment?\nMR. JONES: If you have a claim based on State\nlaw or common law, and that's the reason we have a\nresponsible officer statute is that this is a Federal\nclaim. There isn't -- unlike in the partnership situation\nand in the ordinary transferee situation, there's not a\nbackup State law action.\nQUESTION: Well, if -- if in the case of\ncorporate officers, there must be an assessment, then by\nanalogy it would seem that it wouldn't be too much trouble\nfor the IRS to assess the partners in your case.\nMR. JONES: Well, sometimes it is troublesome,\nbut it's not required in any situation under our\nunderstanding of the existing law.\nQUESTION: I -- I thought that it was required\nin the -- in -- in the corporate case. You said it has to\nbe assessed against the responsible officer.\nMR. JONES: Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you were\ntalking about the partnership then. Yes. I -- the\nresponsible officers -- officer liability is created by\nFederal statute, unlike the partners' obligation for the\ndebts of the partnership.\nQUESTION: I'm simply wondering if -- if that\nisn't a model, if that's what happens in the corporate\ninstance, in this case where the statute is -- is silent\non the point, whether we shouldn't just assume that since\nit's not too much of a burden on the Government in the\ncorporate context to require it to assess the responsible\nofficer before the tax can be collected, that we shouldn't\nsay the same thing here.\nMR. JONES: There is --\nQUESTION: I'm just --\nMR. JONES: I understand. But the responsible\nofficer liability is -- is really a radically different\nconcept. It only -- it only arises when that officer had\nknowledge of the fact that the taxes weren't being paid as\nthey accrued and willfully failed to pay them and -- and\nwas responsible, had the responsibility to pay them. It\nis a -- it is a malfeasance claim, whereas the derivative\nliability claim is just under State law, you are liable as\nis the partnership, and we can enforce that State law.\nThere's another example --\nQUESTION: There's a --\nMR. JONES: -- where the similar thing happened.\n3505, which is the lender's liability. There was no\nlender's liability for employment taxes that the Court\ndiscussed in the Jersey Shore case. That liability didn't\nhave a -- a common law precedent, and so Congress created\nthe liability because they saw a specific problem where\nlenders were allowing or in -- in effect, helping\nemployers evade employment taxes by loaning them money\nfrom which they paid wages but didn't paid taxes. And so\nCongress created this separate statutory scheme.\nBut respondents are correct in their concession\nthat there is no mechanism under Federal law for assessing\nthe derivative State law liability of a partner for the\ndebts of the partnership. And so as the Court held in --\nin Leighton, we can proceed without assessment against\nthem to enforce that liability.\nNow, I do want to also mention the -- the\ncitations that respondents make to section 6303. That\nsection appears in the portion of the code that addresses\nadministrative collection through liens and levies, and it\nstates that the Secretary is to give notice of the\nassessment to any person liable for the tax. The cases\nthat have interpreted and applied that statute, which stem\nfrom 1954, have -- have concluded correctly that that\nstatute applies only to administrative collection through\nliens and levies and has no application to judicial\ncollection actions.\nAnd there's a -- a sound historical explanation\nfor that, and that is that prior to 1954, there were two\nindependent routes for collecting taxes. The Secretary\nwas authorized by the code to bring a judicial collection\nsuit, but there was a separate officer known as the\ncollector of revenue for each district. And the collector\nof revenue was, by the code, authorized to do the\nadministrative collection through liens and levies. And\nthe predecessor of 6303 had said that the collector is to\ngive notice of the assessment and make demands for\npayment. And it was well established that that applied to\nhis actions in administrative collection and had no\napplication of the Secretary's independent authority to\nbring a judicial collection suit.\nIn 1954 in revising the code, Congress\neliminated references to the collector in the code, placed\nthe Secretary in charge both of the -- of judicial and\nadministrative enforcement and changed the predecessor\nlanguage of 6303 from saying the collector is to give\nnotice to saying the Secretary is to give notice. But in\ndoing so, Congress did not mean to change -- and the\ncourts that have reviewed this have correctly concluded\ndid not change -- the fact that this notice of assessment\nrequirement applies only to the administrative collection\narea, has no application to judicial collection suits like\nthis one.\nQUESTION: Are you conceding then that there\ncould be no liens and levies against the partners here\nbecause there was no notice and demand --\nMR. JONES: I --\nQUESTION: -- individually to them?\nMR. JONES: I don't think the record discusses\nwhether there was notice to the partnership.\nQUESTION: No, no. To the partners.\nMR. JONES: No.\nQUESTION: You just explained these two\ndifferent routes.\nMR. JONES: Yes.\nQUESTION: And you said that this is a judicial\ncollection proceeding.\nMR. JONES: Yes.\nQUESTION: So the other doesn't apply. So I'm\nasking you if you are now making the concession that those\nwords -- what are they -- each person liable for unpaid\ntax, would stop you from using the administrative\ncollection route because you didn't give notice and demand\nindividually.\nMR. JONES: Let me -- I can't say what we did or\ndidn't do in notice because there's nothing in the record\non that in this case because administrative collection\nisn't involved in this case.\nQUESTION: Well, let's assume you gave notice\nand demand only to the partnership.\nMR. JONES: Okay, let's assume that. If we gave\nnotice and demand to the partnership, what we would be\nauthorized to do is clearly under 6321 and -- make a lien\nand levy against any assets of the partnership. And then\nas I said, although -- the -- the cases are also perfectly\nconsistent that the notice to the partnership is valid as\nconstructive notice to the partners.\nAnd so, for example, if we have a partnership\nemployment tax liability from Smith Construction and the\ntwo partners are Bob Jones and Bill Wilson, notice of the\nassessment to the partnership is valid as notice to its\ntwo partners. And so our lien arises, if they don't pay\nthe tax, but if a third party creditor is out there, First\nNational Bank, the First -- our notice to the partnership\nmay not be notice to the First National Bank. And so in a\nlien contest we might not have the prior lien vis-a-vis\nthis other party, but vis-a-vis the two partners, the\ncases say that our notice is valid for 6303 purposes to\nthem because, well, of course, a partnership only acts\nthrough its partners and notice to one of them or to the\npartnership is valid, constructive notice to all the\nothers.\nThere is no case inconsistent with that\nconclusion, but again, it's plainly not presented in this\ncase and we would not ask the Court to address it.\nThere's no need for it to. This is just a judicial\ncollection case.\nThe only issue that is really before the Court\nis whether we have to give notice -- I'm sorry -- whether\nwe have to assess the individual partners to collect the\nState law derivative liability. And for the reasons I've\ndescribed, that the decision below is incorrect on that\nand -- and should be reversed.\nAnd I would like to reserve the balance of my\ntime.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Jones.\nMr. Haberbush.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID R. HABERBUSH\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. HABERBUSH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nWe've heard some interesting arguments, and I'd\nlike to address the history here of the way in which this\nalleged derivative liability is imposed upon the partners.\nWe contend that the partners --\nQUESTION: Now, the Government says you -- you\ndid not raise what is now your principal argument until\nyour merits brief. Do you agree with that statement?\nMR. HABERBUSH: Your Honor, no, I don't. This\ncase has always been about statutes of limitation. We\nwere addressing, in fact, a argument raised in the merits\nbrief by the Government. If the Court will note, at page\n5 -- I'm sorry -- page 12, footnote 5, this specific\nquestion is addressed by the Government stating that it's\na Federal not a State statute of limitation that comes\ninto play. And our portion of the brief is simply a reply\nto that.\nQUESTION: Wait. It seems to me it's -- it's --\nthe burden is on you to make the claim that a State\nstatute applies, and you never claimed that any State\nstatute applies. Now, the Government here, out of an\nexcess of caution or maybe to explain the whole situation\nto us, puts in that footnote, but that doesn't create a\nclaim on your part that the State statute governs.\nDid you ever assert that -- that this matter was\ngoverned by -- by a State statute of limitations until\nyour merits brief?\nMR. HABERBUSH: Yes, we did in the courts below\nand our briefs below.\nQUESTION: You asserted that it was governed by\na State statute of limitations.\nMR. HABERBUSH: Your Honor, what we argued was\nthat if the Federal statutes did not apply, section 6303\nrequiring notice and demand, if these partners are not\ntaxpayers under the Internal Revenue Code, then State law\nwould govern. And yes, we did raise it below.\nQUESTION: Did the court of appeals touch on it?\nMR. HABERBUSH: The court of appeals did not\nneed to touch upon it, because the court of appeals felt\nand decided that these partners are taxpayers under the\nInternal Revenue Code. And that's the precise question I\nwould like to address.\nQUESTION: Did you raise the statute of\nlimitations point in your pleadings in the district court?\nMR. HABERBUSH: In the United -- this originated\nin the bankruptcy court, so the district court --\nQUESTION: Well, I mean in the bankruptcy court.\nMR. HABERBUSH: Your Honor, we did. We raised\nit both in terms of the statute of limitations under\nsection 6303 and under State law.\nQUESTION: Did you raise it as an affirmative\ndefense under State law?\nMR. HABERBUSH: Well, we objected to the proof\nof claim which is akin to an answer, and yes --\nQUESTION: And one ground of your objection was\nunder State law it's barred?\nMR. HABERBUSH: Our objection was a fairly\ngeneric objection in all honesty --\nQUESTION: So we're talking about did you ever\nsay this claim is barred by -- it -- it is too late under\nthis State statute of limitations, citing the State\nstatute of limitations?\nMR. HABERBUSH: Yes, we did.\nQUESTION: Would you provide us with --\nQUESTION: Where can we find that in the record?\nQUESTION: Where will we find that?\nMR. HABERBUSH: I believe you'll find that at\nthe -- the district court level after the bankruptcy\ncourt.\nQUESTION: Well, isn't the place to raise it in\nthe bankruptcy court? I mean, that's where your pleadings\n-- that's where your responsive pleadings were filed.\nMR. HABERBUSH: If indeed it is an affirmative\ndefense, yes. Our objection to the claim was this was not\nan enforceable claim under law, State or Federal, and our\nreason for it was barred by the limitations periods.\nQUESTION: As a Federal --\nQUESTION: Under California practice, I assume\nstatute of limitations is an affirmative defense?\nMR. HABERBUSH: Yes, Your -- Your Honor, it is.\nWe, however, believe that this case does not be\ncontrolled by State law, but rather by Federal law. A\npartner's liability for the debts of a partnership may\narise under State law, and this Court has noted in the\ncase of United States v. Kraft that State law defines the\nrights as between the parties, but the manner by which it\nmay be collected, the tax itself or the claim, is governed\nby Federal law. And that is really the heart of what our\nargument is.\nThere is no specific Internal Revenue Code\nprovision that makes a partner liable for a partnership\ndebt. What the Government in this case does is it relies\nspecifically upon historical cases that stem from old\nsection 280, which is adopted as section 6901 of the\nInternal Revenue Code, whereby assessments may be made\nagainst transferees, donees, and fiduciaries, and the\ncases interpreting those statutes basically find that\nthere is a derivative liability with a coterminous statute\nof limitations.\nQUESTION: This would be an odd State law,\nwouldn't it? Imagine that I guarantee a debt or suppose a\npartner is like a guarantor. And suppose that the primary\n-- person primary -- primarily liable is in litigation\nwith the debtor -- the creditor, rather. And because of\ndelays and so forth, it takes about 15 years to resolve\nthis litigation. I've never heard of a guarantor who\nwouldn't become liable at the time the thing is final and\nthat the -- he just becomes -- I mean, how does it work?\nI would have thought a guarantor is liable for the debt\nthe debtor owes. How does the statute work, the State\nstatute?\nMR. HABERBUSH: Your Honor, we believe the State\nstatute is -- is one that does not require exhaustion of\nremedies as against the partnership.\nQUESTION: It has nothing to do with exhaustion\nof remedies. I'm -- and I'm talking about States -- the\nState insofar as it sees the partner as a guarantor of the\nliability that is created by a different entity, namely\nthe partnership. And I'm asking if under State law of\nCalifornia, wouldn't it be the case that if he's a\nguarantor and you get the statute of limitations on a\nmatter to determine liability extended, that the guarantee\nalso extends.\nMR. HABERBUSH: That would --\nQUESTION: There's no State law that says you\nhave to sue the guarantor before the liability that he's\nguaranteeing is determined.\nMR. HABERBUSH: That is correct.\nQUESTION: All right. If that's correct, what\nare we arguing about?\nMR. HABERBUSH: What we're arguing about here is\nthat this is not a suretyship or a secondary liability --\nQUESTION: Yes, yes. You're back to your\nquestion of whether under partnership law in fact this is\na guarantor or the equivalent or a surety. I understand\nthat argument, but it sounds to me as if that argument is\nresolved against you, this statute of limitations argument\nis a serious red herring because it won't matter.\nMR. HABERBUSH: Well, unless Federal law\ncontrols.\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. HABERBUSH: Unless these parties are\ntaxpayers under Federal law, in which case --\nQUESTION: No, no. If the primary argument,\nwhich you want to argue, that they're taxpayers or that\nthey are primarily liable, you win it or you lose it. If\nyou win it, you win. If you lose it, your statute of\nlimitations argument adds nothing.\nMR. HABERBUSH: I think not.\nQUESTION: That's my -- that's what I'm\nthinking.\nMR. HABERBUSH: I think not. I think we win,\nand let me explain why. It has nothing to do with\nlimitations periods. It has nothing to do with State law\ngoverning guarantees. It has to do with the way this\nCourt is asked to define this particular claim in this\nparticular case. Is it a tax claim or is it a claim which\nis derived from the partnership liability? In other\nwords, is it a tax debt or is it a debt because they're\nliable for a debt of the partnership so that it loses its\nnature as a tax claim?\nIf that's the case, this is a bankruptcy case.\nTax claims in bankruptcy have priority over other claims\nunder section 507(a) of title 11 of the United States\nCode. Those claims too are not dischargeable if they're a\ntax claim under section 523 of title 11. So if the Court\ndetermines this is nothing more than a guarantee pursuant\nto State law and not a tax claim, then this debt will be\ndischarged in this bankruptcy case.\nQUESTION: Do you have -- have any cases for\nthat, that a tax claim loses its character as a tax claim\nwhen relief is sought not against the person primarily\nliable but against somebody derivatively liable? It seems\nto me it's still a tax claim.\nMR. HABERBUSH: No, Your Honor, we do not have\nauthority for that. However, if it is a tax --\nQUESTION: I wouldn't expect you to find any.\nMR. HABERBUSH: However, if they are liable for\nthe tax, this Court has already stated on a number of\noccasions, including the most recent case of U.S. v.\nKraft, someone who is subject to the tax is someone who\npays it, someone who is liable for it. These parties are\nliable for the tax. They are subject to the tax under\nsection 7701(a)(14) of the Internal Revenue Code, and\ntherefore they are taxpayers. Once they are taxpayers,\nthat invokes the provisions of section 6501 requiring\nassessment or suit within 3 years. We don't claim that\nassessment is the only method. We claim assessment or\nsuit, which is consistent with the history of the cases,\nand that's a 3-year limitation period as to these --\nQUESTION: No, but you say that they're\ntaxpayers because they're partners, and therefore they --\nand -- and that's why the -- their -- their right to an\nassessment can be claimed. But by the same reasoning that\nyou follow, if they are taxpayers because they are\npartners, why isn't notice to the partnership notice to\nthe partners or assessment against the partnership\nassessment against the partners? Why -- why do you, in\neffect, make a metaphysical distinction in the latter case\nbut not in the former?\nMR. HABERBUSH: Well, Your Honor, I don't think\nthat we do. I think that the argument that there is\nconstructive notice merely because one is a partner\ncreates notice to -- notice to the partnership is notice\nto the partners. There is no controlling case on this\nidea, and that would be too a question I think of State\nlaw, whether notice to a partnership is notice to the\npartners. And we've clearly cited to California law that\nsays you must commence a separate suit against the partner\nin order to obtain a judgment against it. There is no\nCalifornia law that says that by filing a suit against the\npartner, that's sufficient for due process purposes of\ncreating notice to the partners such that --\nQUESTION: We don't ordinarily decide questions\nof State law here. I think we would generally feel\nperhaps the Ninth Circuit knows more about California law\nthan we do.\nMR. HABERBUSH: Well, certainly that's true.\nAnd that's --\nQUESTION: I said, we would think.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. HABERBUSH: Well, thank you. And -- and\nyes, this Court ordinarily does not address questions of\nState law.\nWe think that this is a Federal statutory\ninterpretation. Either these persons are taxpayers liable\nfor a tax or they are not taxpayers liable some -- for\nsomething that is not a tax.\nQUESTION: The last part. They are for -- they\nare not taxpayers in the meaning of the statute who are\nliable for something that is a tax. And I don't know why\nthat wouldn't be.\nMR. HABERBUSH: Well, Your Honor --\nQUESTION: And State law makes them, in effect,\nguarantors of debts. This is a tax debt. So they're\nguarantors of the tax debt. So, therefore, they're liable\nfor the tax or sureties or some other equivalent word.\nMR. HABERBUSH: All of the cases referred to for\nthe coterminous statute of limitations, which is what\nwould be suggested would be applied here if in fact they\nare liable for this tax debt and therefore the provisions\nof the Internal Revenue Code apply, are all cases where\nspecific enabling provisions created the liability of\nthose persons. Under section 6324, certain persons are\nmade personally liable. Under section 6901, certain\npersons may be assessed with taxes as transferees. And\nthose specific statutes have provisions in them that say\nthat the assessment and collection and enforcement of the\ntax -- this is 6901 and its predecessor, section 280,\nwhere the collection assessment and enforcement of the tax\nis subject to the same provisions and the same limitations\nas the tax itself. So it's not surprising that you have\ncases like Leighton and Updike where the statute of\nlimitations set forth in what is now 6502 applies to them\nbecause they're subject to the same limitation periods.\nThere is nothing in the Internal Revenue Code\nthat sets forth a limitation period as to partners. If\none adopts the guarantor analogy, then this is conceivable\na case where any number of years could pass where the\npartners would become liable.\nYour -- I would point out the Court's record in\nthe joint appendix. At pages 100 and 102, we have the\nproofs of claim that were filed in these bankruptcy cases,\nand these proofs of claim on their face show that the\nGovernment in this case is not simply filing a claim as\nthough it were a lawsuit against these partners. These\nproofs of claim were filed as secured claims in both of\nthe two cases that are before the Court. Secured by what?\nMotor vehicles and real estate. So the Internal Revenue\nService is taking the position clearly, unequivocally that\nit can enforce this debt by the summary collection process\nwhich has been called awesome and -- and super powers that\nare not available otherwise.\nQUESTION: Whether they could or not, they're\nsaying that the question here is a judicial action.\nMR. HABERBUSH: Well --\nQUESTION: And -- and so maybe they're wrong and\nmaybe they're right about that, but that's not before the\nCourt.\nMR. HABERBUSH: That's not -- that may not be\nbefore the Court, but the Government has taken the\nposition the only way, the sole and single way, it can\ncollect taxes is to file suits against partners. We would\nsuggest that if the Court were to permit assessment, rule\nthat they are taxpayers subject to assessment, subject to\nsuit, that that would enhance collection. It would\nencourage partners at the earliest opportunity to cause\ntheir partnerships to pay taxes. It would cause partners\nat the earliest opportunity to pay the taxes. In this\ninstance, you have proofs of claim --\nQUESTION: It -- it would also cause an enormous\nnumber of assessments to be made that ultimately would\nhave no -- no use. I mean, the -- the amount of\nadministrative assessing going on would -- would be\nstaggering.\nMR. HABERBUSH: Well, the amount of suits could\nbe staggering as well to collect these kinds of taxes.\nQUESTION: What is the problem? Suppose -- I'm\n-- I'm failing to see it but maybe -- suppose it's true\nthat what the Uniform Partnership Act says is true.\nPartners are, quote, in the nature of guarantors, end\nquote, rather than principal debtors on the debts of the\npartnership. So let's suppose they're like guarantors. I\nwould have thought that State law was something along the\nlines of a guarantor must be sued in order to collect a --\na guaranteed debt within a period of time after it becomes\ndetermined that such a debt exists. Now, I would think\nthat that's how the normal State law runs.\nSo unless there's something Federal to the\ncontrary -- and by the way, if there is, they have 10 more\nyears. But unless there is something Federal to the\ncontrary, there's no problem with bringing this case.\nSo the only question in this case is are they in\nthe nature of guarantors. And I'd be interested -- well,\nA, I'm interested in your comment on what I just said, and\nI'm also interested in the comment of why they're not\nguarantors.\nMR. HABERBUSH: Very well. Here the Internal\nRevenue Service has filed proofs of claim in the\nbankruptcy court not for the debt of the tax but for the\ntax, for the penalties, and for the interest. Guarantors\nunder California law are liable for the debt and perhaps\nthe interest, but not for the penalties. The Court will\nnote that these proofs of claim are approximately three to\nfour times as much as the amount of tax that was\noriginally assessed against the partnership in the initial\ninstance. There is nothing in the record to suggest that\nthese partners had knowledge or notice of these taxes at\nany time before these proofs of claim were filed.\nNow, under California law, if you have a\nguarantor, the guarantor knows of the liability that that\nguarantor is offering surety for. That guarantor knows\nthat that liability exists. That guarantor can encourage\nthe principal party to pay the tax or the debt in\nquestion. Here the policies that are urged by the\nGovernment do not encourage collection of this --\nQUESTION: Mr. Haberbush, do you defend the\ndecision of the Ninth Circuit in this case?\nMR. HABERBUSH: Yes, we do.\nQUESTION: That in order to collect against the\npartners, an assessment would have to be made against\nthem?\nMR. HABERBUSH: No, not within that specific\nlimitation. We think that an assessment or a suit should\nbe brought within the statutory period --\nQUESTION: Well, I thought -- I thought the\nreasoning of the Ninth Circuit was that you couldn't\ncollect against the partners unless you assess them too.\nMR. HABERBUSH: To that extent, the opinion is\nwrong for the reason that it is a well-held proposition\nthat suit or assessment may be brought under section 6501\nwithin the 3-year period, so that it's not exclusively\nassessment that's involved. And this Court and other\ncourts, I believe, have -- have ruled that assessment is\nnot a prerequisite to collection. However, some action\nmust be taken within the statutory limitations periods.\nQUESTION: And the filing of a claim in a\nbankruptcy court is insufficient because?\nMR. HABERBUSH: It's untimely. It is not done\nwithin the period of time --\nQUESTION: So this is simply a statute of\nlimitations case.\nMR. HABERBUSH: That's our position. Yes, Your\nHonor. It is simply a statute of limitations case. The\nGovernment has contended that this is a tax governed by\nthe Internal Revenue Code. The liability may be created\nby State law, and this Court has consistently said while\nliability may be -- be created by State law, the\nenforceability of that liability is a subject of Federal\nlaw. The Federal laws provide for 6303 notice and demand.\nThey provide for -- 6501 provides that assessment must be\nmade. The -- the Government suggests that there can --\nQUESTION: Mr. Haberbush, would you be able,\nafter the argument, to furnish the Court with the places\nin the record available to us where it shows that you\nraised the State statute of limitations issue below?\nMR. HABERBUSH: Yes, I can.\nQUESTION: Thank you.\nMR. HABERBUSH: Yes, I can.\nQUESTION: Why shouldn't an assessment against\nthe partnership be good as to the partners as well? I\nmean, the whole difference is that you'd have to add the\n-- the names of the individual partners. I mean, the\nassessment itself is something in a file in some building.\nRight?\nMR. HABERBUSH: Well, the assessment is the\nnotation or recording of the liability. However, section\n6203 says that to be a proper assessment, it must record\nthe liability of the taxpayer and we, of course, say that\nthe taxpayer also includes the partners.\nAnd yes, there could be a single assessment\nnaming numerous parties. There are examples of that. For\nexample, a husband and wife are jointly assessed. An\nassessment against a husband or a wife independently is\nnot an assessment against the other. So there are\nmultiple assessments that are capable of being made under\nthe code.\nThere are numerous other instances where\nassessments are made. 6901, for example, assessment --\nQUESTION: Is it -- does it -- would it matter\nif in fact the partners knew -- had received the -- I\nassume that the notice and demand would come to the\npartnership. This is a small partnership. There were\nwhat? Four partners involved? If they had actual notice,\nwould that make any difference?\nMR. HABERBUSH: Your Honor, that might make a\ndifference. We -- we would contend that it does not make\na difference. We have cited to cases -- and I don't\nrecall them right off the top of my -- my head at this\nmoment -- where the assessment -- in fact, that was Cool\nFuel, Inc. out of the Ninth Circuit where the assessment\nactually has to be received and made. It has to name who\nthe taxpayer is.\nMarvel v. the United States. While the taxpayer\nthere was named as a partnership's name, the individuals'\nSocial Security numbers, taxpayer identification numbers,\nwere on that -- that assessment, and that was found to be\ngood as to those persons even though they were not\nindividually named.\nQUESTION: But certainly they had actual notice.\nYour big due process objection that you make would not --\nwould -- would be very thin, would it not?\nMR. HABERBUSH: I don't disagree with that, Your\nHonor. There is nothing in the record below where there\nis -- that issue has been addressed. There is no facts\nthat were derived at the trial of this matter where that\nwas addressed. There is nothing in the record --\nQUESTION: But you addressed it in your brief.\nYou said if they didn't get individual notice and demand,\nthat would be a violation of due process.\nMR. HABERBUSH: Yes. It is not before the\nCourt, however, whether they did or didn't, and there's\nnothing in the record suggesting that they did get such\nnotice. That's why the -- the Government relies so\nheavily on its constructive notice theory, although\nstarkly absent from that argument is any California law to\nsupport that idea that notice to a partnership is\nconstructive notice to its partners.\nTurning back to the -- the idea of the -- the\nassessment in this case, the -- there are striking\nexamples throughout the brief of the Government, although\nthe Government contends that it is not able legally to\nassess partners, there are no less than 12 cases cited in\nthe briefs, 10 of which were cited by the Government, in\nwhich summary collection process was instituted against\npartners, and in -- in any of those cases there was an\nassessment.\nIn fact, the one case that's cited by the\nGovernment, the -- the United States v. Wright -- that's\nthe case which came out of the Seventh Circuit that the\nGovernment contends is in direct conflict with the Ninth\nCircuit case in this instance is one where the United\nStates District Court in its findings found that the\npartners were assessed. And it's not surprising\ntherefore, that the Wright court found that there were --\nQUESTION: It said that -- but I thought Judge\nEasterbrook said that that was irrelevant, that there\nmight have been a fact question about that whether there\nwere individual assessments. But in any case, the court's\nrationale had nothing to do with that.\nMR. HABERBUSH: That is correct. However, the\ndistrict court did find that there were assessments. The\nSeventh Circuit found that that was irrelevant to the --\nthe determination. However, it is entirely consistent\nwith the idea that in that case there were coterminous\nstatute of limitations. For the reason that assessments\nwere made within the statutory period of time -- that was\nstill within the coterminous periods -- then the\ncollection. The question was whether the 6502 allowed the\ncollection against the partners who were jointly liable\nwith the partnership in that instance. The statutory\nperiod of time allowed to the partnership, because it had\nbeen tolled during a bankruptcy, the court found\ncoterminous statute of limitations, relying on the Updike\ncase as its example.\nWe -- we believe that the collection of taxes\nwould be enhanced by adopting the position that we have\ntaken in this case. We believe that requiring the filing\nof lawsuits in every instance where partners are liable\nfor the debts of a partnership which has failed to pay its\ntaxes and which may or may not be out of business, is\nsimply a policy which would have litigation that is not\nrequired.\nIf the partnership is liable for the tax and\nthis Court were to find that the notice provisions of 6302\nand the provisions of 6501 allowing suit or assessment\nwithin 3 years applies, that that would enhance the\ncollection of taxes. We believe that -- excuse me -- we\nbelieve that by doing that, the tax will be paid at the\nearliest possible time. Interest and penalties, such as\nhave accrued in this case, would not accrue because the\npartners would be encouraged at every point and at every\nspot to cause their partnership to pay or to pay the tax\nthemselves.\nThe Government is not in the business of banking\ntax claims, if you will, allowing them to accrue penalties\nand interest and thereafter, for who knows how many years,\npotentially as many as 3 plus 10, and if suit is filed\nwithin the 10 years under 6502, the -- the term for\nenforcing a judgment. So it could be 20-25 years that a\npartner could be out there liable for the tax during which\npenalties and interest continue to accrue, and then\nfinally one day maybe that partner or that partner's\nestate or the partner's beneficiaries of the partner's\nestate might become liable for this tax.\nWe believe that by filing the tax -- by filing\nan assessment at the earliest possible opportunity against\nthe partners, this would encourage tax collection.\nQUESTION: Nothing would stop a partner from\npaying the tax.\nMR. HABERBUSH: If the partner knows, that is\ncorrect. If the --\nQUESTION: Isn't it reasonable to assume most\npartners know what's happening in their business?\nMR. HABERBUSH: I don't know that it's\nunreasonable to assume that, but I suppose it is\nreasonable. However, there are partnerships and there are\npartnerships, and some partnerships have managing partners\nwho are actively involved in the business of the\npartnership and --\nQUESTION: Yes, but I -- I would think, by and\nlarge, most partners know what's going on. I mean,\ncertainly there are exceptional cases, but certainly\nthat's not typical.\nMR. HABERBUSH: Unfortunately, I'm only involved\nin my law partnership and I know what's going on there.\nI've not been involved --\nQUESTION: Maybe you shouldn't be a general\npartner if -- if you're not prepared to know what's going\non. It's pretty risky. I mean, that's -- that's the\nresponsibility you assume when he -- it only applies to\ngeneral partners. It doesn't apply to limited partners.\nMR. HABERBUSH: That's exactly right.\nQUESTION: So don't become a general partner if\nyou're not willing to know what's going on in the\npartnership. I -- I thought that's the deal.\nMR. HABERBUSH: Well, Your Honor, I don't know\nwhether that --\nQUESTION: That's what it means to be a general\npartner. You're -- you're going to be liable for what the\npartnership does. So you better pay attention. I -- and\nyou're saying this is unjust somehow?\nMR. HABERBUSH: Well, yes, it is, Your Honor,\nfor the reason that does that mean that every partner has\nto go through every single piece of mail that enters the\npartnership and be familiar with every single thing that\noccurs?\nQUESTION: No, but when you accumulate tax\nliabilities of several hundred thousand dollars, they\nought to find that -- be able to find that out.\nMR. HABERBUSH: Well, Your Honor, these are over\na number of quarters. These were not all assessed at one\ntime.\nQUESTION: Which is all the more reason they\nshould have known about it a lot earlier.\nMR. HABERBUSH: Well, husbands oftentimes hide\nthings from their wives who are a joint taxpayer as well.\nQUESTION: But we're talking about a partnership\nthat has not paid -- what was it -- FICA and FUTA taxes.\nSurely, the partners were aware that they were not paying\nthe taxes that were due year after year.\nMR. HABERBUSH: There's nothing in the record\nthat suggests --\nQUESTION: Who was responding to these letters\nfrom the Government? The secretary?\nMR. HABERBUSH: Your Honor --\nQUESTION: I mean, does she take it in to -- to\nher boss who was presumably one of the general partners\nand say, hey, you know --\nMR. HABERBUSH: If it's a --\nQUESTION: -- the Government says we owe a lot\nof money.\nMR. HABERBUSH: If it's a managing -- if it's a\nmanaging general partner, I assume that that's the case.\nIf in fact the partnership had ceased its operations and\nthese notices came afterwards, who knows who received the\nnotices. I don't think that the law imposes a burden upon\nevery single general partner to look at every single bill\nand piece of paper that comes into a partnership.\nQUESTION: No, but you shouldn't rely on the\nUnited States Government to tell you what you -- how your\nfinancial affairs are coming along and be the primary\nsource of information.\nMR. HABERBUSH: That may be so, but if the -- if\nthe Government were required to do so, partners would at\nevery point in time be encouraged to cause the partnership\nto meet its financial obligations.\nQUESTION: It doesn't place that kind of a\nburden on the partners that you're talking about. They're\nentirely free not to read the mail.\nMR. HABERBUSH: Well, that's -- that's correct.\nQUESTION: But -- but the problem is they're\ngoing to be liable for whatever debts are incurred by the\npartnership if they don't do it. That's the only burden\nimposed.\nMR. HABERBUSH: Well, Your Honor, and looking at\nburdens there is no -- there is no insignificant -- excuse\nme. It's not a significant burden to place upon the\nGovernment to simply send another notice to the partners\nregarding their derivative liability for these claims.\nQUESTION: And it's not a very significant\nburden to a partner to say you better make sure they're\npaying the taxes.\nMR. HABERBUSH: Well, of course. However, there\n-- there have been dishonest partners, and the cases that\nI cite --\nQUESTION: You better be careful who you form a\npartnership --\nMR. HABERBUSH: Well, yes, and there are cases\ncited in the briefs that say exactly that. However, if --\nif the policy is to collect taxes and collect them\npromptly, then that is encouraged, rather than filing suit\nagainst partners, by a simple assessment sent in the mail\nto the partners.\nIf there is nothing further --\nQUESTION: Does an assessment affect your credit\nrating?\nMR. HABERBUSH: Yes, it does. It does.\nQUESTION: So -- so you want -- all right.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Haberbush.\nMR. HABERBUSH: Thank you.\nQUESTION: Mr. Jones, you have 5 minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. JONES\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. JONES: Thank you.\nAt page 3 of respondents' brief on the merits,\nthey say -- and I quote -- if respondents are secondarily\nliable for the partnership taxes, then the Ninth Circuit's\nruling that the IRS must assess respondents to collect the\npartnership taxes is incorrect. It is clear to us that\nthere is -- this is a secondary derivative liability that\npartners have under State law. I didn't hear respondents\ngive any explanation of why that isn't so.\nGiven those two facts, then this Court's holding\nin Leighton seems clearly applicable, which is that we\ndon't have to assess a derivative State law liability to\nbring suit to recover upon that liability.\nNow, respondents say, well, somehow that holding\nis influenced by the fact that transferee liability is\nprovided in 6901 of the code. It's interesting that in --\nin the Leighton case what the Court held was that the 6901\ntransferee liability is a supplementary remedy that did\nnot displace and, indeed, left in place the right of the\nUnited States to bring its suit upon the derivative State\nlaw liability without assessment.\nSo the -- the principle that we draw from the\nLeighton case is not dependent on any of the specific\nstatutes that address specific types of -- of assignments\nof transferees. In fact, it's utterly independent of\nthat, which was the very issue the Court decided in\nLeighton.\nGiven that and -- and given that there's a\nderivative sub-secondary liability, we can recover against\nState law. Then the only other question is, well, what\nstatute of limitations applies to that, which the Court\nheld in Updike that it's 6502 which applies both to the\ndirect liability and the derivative liability.\nQUESTION: See, that's what I'm really wondering\nabout. I mean -- but -- but I mean, A, they may have not\nhave raised it below. B, it's not within the scope of the\nquestion. C, it may not make any difference because the\nState and Federal may give you enough time anyway. But if\nyou do have to get to it, I'm -- I'm a little worried\nabout it because I don't -- I don't really see why it\nshould be Federal.\nMR. JONES: The reason it should be Federal is\nbecause all of these actions are designed, as the Court\nstressed in Updike, to collect the tax. We have different\nremedies. Congress could Federalize all of this.\nCongress could write a statute that said, you know, you\ncan bring suits for derivative liabilities and that those\nsuits will -- specifically subject to 6502. And what the\nCourt noted in Stern was that Congress hasn't done that\nbecause the Court has consistently applied State law to\npermit such tax collection to occur.\nAnd -- and so that's why Updike has got to be\nright because this is a strong Federal interest in\ncollecting taxes, not to be too big about it, but I mean,\nthis Court has noted that the collection of taxes is the\nlifeblood of Government. This is as sovereign a claim as\nwe have, and -- and because of that, we need to have a\nuniform statute of limitations, which Congress has\nprovided under 6502.\nIf -- if we were left to the haphazards of State\nlaw, we would certainly want Congress to -- to address\nthat and correct it, but they don't need to correct it\nbecause since 1930 in the Updike case, the Court has\nexplained that 6502 is broad enough to cover both types of\n-- of judicial collection proceedings. In the Court's\nwords, the action against derivatively liable party is in\nevery real sense a proceeding in court to collect the tax,\nand that's the -- that's the statutory language.\nAnd -- and I -- there has been no contention\nthat that's not a correct interpretation of 6502. I do\nnot know what references respondents may have in mind to\narguments they raised under State statutes of limitations\nbefore. We're not familiar with those. The statute\nthat's referred to in their merits brief is a specific\nState statute. We're not aware that that statute was ever\ncited before by the parties in this case, but even if it\nwas, it seems to us that the reasoning of the Summerlin\ncase and -- and of Updike, which is -- there's already a\nFederal statute -- should control that question and --\nQUESTION: Mr. Jones, why isn't Mr. Haberbush\nright at least when he says everybody would be better off\nif you went ahead and listed the partners as well on the\nassessment and gave them notice and demand? Then there\nwould never be any hassle of whether you could use both\nremedies, administrative and judicial.\nMR. JONES: I think it's a question for Congress\nwhat's -- you know, what makes everybody better off. And\nwhat Congress has said is that we can assess these taxes\nagainst the employer. The employer under State law is a\nseparate and distinct legal entity known as the\npartnership.\nQUESTION: Do you think you're impeded that you\nhave no authority to give the partners notice\nindividually?\nMR. JONES: We -- well, we have authority to\ngive them notice of an assessment and collect from them\nadministratively, but in terms of, if you will, making an\nassessment against them directly, we're supposed to assess\nthe party whose subject to the tax.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Jones.\n"
