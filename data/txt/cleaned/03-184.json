SHAPIRO\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. SHAPIRO: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and\nmay it please the Court:\nJudge Cudahy stated in his dissent in the\nSeventh Circuit that disclosure of the rule 183 report in\nthis case should be required on both statutory and\nconstitutional grounds. As Judge Cudahy put it, there is\nno item of more significance in evaluating a Tax Court's\ndecision on fraud than the unfiltered findings of the STJ.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Mr. Shapiro, can this case,\nin your view, be decided solely on the statutory question?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Oh, yes, Your Honor. We believe\nit can.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: There also are due process\nallegations, and I'm not sure I even quite understand what\nthe precise due process violation is that's alleged. But\nI would like you to address both and to tell us, first of\nall, how it would be resolved solely on a statutory basis\nfrom your perspective.\nMR. SHAPIRO: The readiest ground for decision\nis the statutory basis, and we believe that the statute is\na good means to avoid a complex due process question.\nThere are two statutes that are key here. One\nis the appellate review statute. The other is the public\nrecord statute. The public record statute says all\nreports of the Tax Court are public records, and we're\ntalking about a report of the Tax Court in this case.\nThe legislative history of that provision shows\nCongress had the broadest possible intent to make all\npractices in the Tax Court completely transparent. All\nsteps in the adjudication were supposed to be --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, would that include --\nif a Tax Court judge had a law clerk, would it include law\nclerk memos to the judge?\nMR. SHAPIRO: We -- we don't take that position.\nIt refers to reports of judges, and this is a report of a\ntrial judge who heard the witnesses. The report is\npresumed correct under rule 183. It's the only\nindependent evaluation of witness credibility --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, why -- why do you say\nthat?\nMR. SHAPIRO: -- and the only judge --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Would you elaborate for this\nreason? Because the briefs and you again today keep\ntalking about that first document. You use the word\nreport.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, to me that's the whole\nconclusion of the case. I'm prepared to assume, at least\nfor the moment, if you can convince me that that's the\nreport they're talking about, you'd win. But that isn't\nwhat the Government says.\nThe Government says that's a piece of paper,\npreliminary. We -- like my draft. I write drafts all the\ntime. So -- so do trial judges. And he goes and brings\nthe draft to the other two judges and says, let's sit down\nand talk about it. And they sit down and talk about it,\nand he changes his mind and writes a different document.\nAnd that different document, of course, is totally public.\nThe whole opinion of the Tax Court. There is that\ndocument.\nMR. SHAPIRO: There is only one rule 183 report.\nUnder the rule, it's the report the trial judge prepares\nand submits to the chief judge at the completion of the\ntrial, which contains his independent credibility\nfindings.\nJUSTICE BREYER: How do we know that? Now --\nnow, what is the answer specifically in the statute?\nLet's call it document 1 and document 2. And it really\ndidn't help me that much in the briefs to see document 1\ncontinuously labeled with the word report when I thought\nthat's the key question. Is it? Is it that report\nthey're referring to?\nSo now, go ahead.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Under rule 183(b) there is a\nreport denominated as such. There's no question here it\nwas submitted to the court. If you look at page 114a of\nthe Kanter appendix, it says that the special trial judge\nsubmitted a report, as required by rule 183(b). And this\ncase was then referred to Judge Dawson. He had no\ninvolvement with the case until this report was given to\nhim.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Which --\nMR. SHAPIRO: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Which -- which brief --\nMR. SHAPIRO: Oh. It's the petition for cert.\nThe Kanter petition.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: At least --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what page did you say?\nJUSTICE BREYER: What -- what page?\nMR. SHAPIRO: 114a, 114a. And throughout --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Shapiro, why don't you\nsimply read the text of 183(b) --\nMR. SHAPIRO: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- which is in the\nGovernment's brief at 4a? It says, special trial judge's\nreport. It is the only report to which the Tax Court\nrules refer.\nMR. SHAPIRO: That's correct, Your Honor. And\nit's --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And -- and if in fact --\nMR. SHAPIRO: -- it is presumed correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- you rely on the rule, do we\neven have to resolve the issue of meaning of report in the\nstatute? Can't we simply, from your position, rely on the\nrule and say you've got to follow your own rules?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Absolutely. This is a report that\nmust be submitted. It is presumed correct under this\nrule. It's an independent evaluation of credibility from\nthe only judge who heard the witnesses, and of course,\nit's part of the record. And it doesn't --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So you've really got three\narguments. You've got the rule. You've got the statute,\nand you have due process.\nMR. SHAPIRO: And it doesn't make the slightest\ndifference that the superior judge caused the subordinate\njudge to say, I have changed my mind at a later stage in\nthe proceeding, because it is the original report that is\npresumed correct under the rules.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, what -- what\nwas the page? Please. You're going quite -- and I want\nto -- because Justice Ginsburg referred to a statement in\nthe Government's brief that you said yes --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: No, not the Government's\nbrief. The Tax Court rules.\nMR. SHAPIRO: That's -- that's appendix 4a.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: 4a of the Government's brief.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's the rule.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Yes, it's the rule itself, 183(b).\nAnd it makes it clear that there must be a\nreport filed with the chief judge. The docket here says\nthat that was done.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you make the argument that\n-- maybe you can't -- that the special trial judge can go\nto the Tax Court judge, with the permission of the chief\njudge, and say, now, here's what -- kind of what I'm\nthinking? It's not my report, but here's what I'm\nthinking. And then the -- the Tax Court judge says, well,\nwhy don't you have some more findings on X and Y and Z?\nHe says, okay, and then he goes back. Can you make the\nargument that that first document is not the report?\nMR. SHAPIRO: The first -- there is only one --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I guess another way of\nsaying it is, do the rules permit any consultation before\nthe report is submitted? I -- I guess that's my question.\nMR. SHAPIRO: The rules are silent on that, but\nJudge Dawson has no involvement in the case until the\nreport is submitted. Then the case is assigned to Judge\nDawson, and then he is supposed to review it under a\npresumptive correctness standard. So it would be\nsurprising if there were consultation of that sort.\nBut what we contend is if there is consultation\nbehind the scenes about credibility determinations, then\nit is critically important that the report be submitted\nand made part of the record and not concealed, and that\nthe deferential standard of review be --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Would -- would that problem\nbe overcome if the special trial judge simply -- if his --\nthe proceedings before him were simply videotaped and then\nthe reviewing judge, Judge Dawson in this case, could look\nat the trial proceedings and would have as much of a\nnotion of the credibility of the witnesses as the special\ntax judge?\nMR. SHAPIRO: I suppose that's a possibility,\nbut in Anderson, the Court said absent some procedure like\nthat, the trial judge is uniquely situated to evaluate\ndemeanor and tone of voice, and because of that, great\ndeference has to be given to the independent evaluation of\nthe trial judge. Maybe in a -- in the future the Tax\nCourt would want to use a procedure like that to mitigate\nthe Raddatz problem that they now have.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In which case, they -- they\nmight well revise the language of their rule.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Yes, they -- they might, and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Which currently requires that\nthe finding of facts of the trial judge be presumed to be\ncorrect.\nMR. SHAPIRO: That's correct, and after all, we\nshould remember that the Government was supposed to\npresent clear and convincing evidence of fraud in this\ncase, and if there was a flip-flop of this sort going on\nbehind the scenes, leaving no trace in the record, what\ncould be more important to the reviewing court than to\nknow what had occurred at the first stage and the second\nstage here? If the trial judge found no underpayment and\nno fraud, which we have reason to believe he did -- three\nTax Court judges stated that to us -- if that was -- that\nwas his finding and he found our witnesses to be credible,\nthen an unexplained overturning of that credibility\ndetermination with no trace in the record would surely be\na candidate for reversal on appeal.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Let -- let me ask this\nquestion, if I may. Suppose the -- a special trial judge\nhears the witnesses, makes a report. It's assigned by the\nchief judge to a Tax Court judge, and the Tax Court judge\nlooks it over it and says, you know, before I -- before I\nreally spend a lot of time on this, you really didn't\nexplore these three problems. Would you please do it over\nagain? Is he permitted to do that or is that a violation\nof the rule that he shall presume the report to be\ncorrect?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, we haven't challenged the\nconversations as such. We think it is -- it is suspect,\nhowever. Under Raddatz, if somebody who has not heard the\nwitnesses is telling somebody who has heard the witnesses,\nI don't agree or I think you may be wrong in your\ncredibility determination, I'd like you to reconsider\nthat, that's a serious Raddatz problem. And the only cure\nfor that is to make the first report part of the record.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm asking if it's a violation\nof -- of the rule.\nMR. SHAPIRO: The --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Because the -- the rule says a\nspecial report shall be presumed to be correct.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Yes.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And if there's this initial\nreview, he says, you know, I think it's really pretty\nincomplete until you do X, Y, Z, please do it over again,\nis that a violation of the rule?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, I think the rule is silent\non that, but the spirit of the rule, frankly, is that the\nSTJ does his job. He completes his report. He submits\nit, and the reviewing judge examines it under a presumed-\ncorrect standard in -- in the same orderly fashion that\nordinarily occurs when there is an initial judgment from a\n-- from a trial judge about credibility with deferential\nreview that comes later.\nBut the rule doesn't tell us much about these\nconsultations, and we do submit that if -- if they do take\nplace, as the Government suggests, there's importuning and\nchanging of minds going on through consultations, do this\non record. Turn square corners because it would be quite\nimportant to the appellate court to know if there was a\ngood reason for the overturning of these credibility\ndeterminations.\nAnd we -- we've seen that kind of review in the\nStone case in the D.C. Circuit, which is very similar to\nthis case. Factually the cases are quite similar. And\nthe reviewing court, Judge Williams, found clear error\nbased on what the rule 183 report stated about witness\ncredibility. There was an elaborate explanation why\nparticular witnesses were credible and incredible, and the\ncourt could use that to evaluate the judgment of the Tax\nCourt.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, what you're asking\nus to do would -- would just solve your problem in this\ncase, and -- and in the future, I suppose they could\nrevise rule 183 as simply not to require a report. There\n-- there's nothing in the statute that requires this\nreport, is there?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, that's true. They could\ncease using the STJ's, but --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, they could -- they could\nuse them, but just say, instead of filing a report, he'll\nconsult with the -- with the deciding judge.\nMR. SHAPIRO: I -- I suppose that could happen.\nIf there is -- if there is no report written, we couldn't\ncontend it has to be disclosed under these statutes, and\nthat -- that might be.\nBut it -- there could be a Raddatz issue in that\nscenario that you present, Justice Scalia. If one judge\nheard the witnesses and the other judge didn't hear the\nwitnesses and -- and the -- the superior judge --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, they confer with each\nother. Maybe, maybe.\nMR. SHAPIRO: But it -- it would be -- it would\nbe quite strange to have credibility determinations made\nby a judge who had never heard from any of the witnesses.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What happens in cases in\nagencies, you know, where -- where -- suppose the agency\nitself or a member thereof is going to make a decision,\nand there might be other members who would hear the\nwitnesses. And I was thinking of that analogy. It's\npossible. It happens in the Federal Communications\nCommission where the staff, you know, consults back and\nforth in ratemaking cases.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Oh, yes.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's hard to find precisely the\nanalogy, but it seems likely.\nMR. SHAPIRO: The -- the closest analogy in this\nCourt's decisions is the Morgan II decision.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, which gives and takes\naway.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Now, Morgan II is really on point\nbecause there, a subordinate official drafted up findings,\nproposed findings, didn't serve them on the parties, but\ndid give them to the decision-maker, the agency. And this\nCourt held that was a violation of due process.\nJUSTICE BREYER: You have to have an opportunity\nto refute the information that's going to --\nMR. SHAPIRO: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMR. SHAPIRO: And -- and every administrative\nbody that we know of in the Federal courts and in the\nState system too -- Chief Judge Vanderbilt pointed that out\nin the Mazza case. Every State in the Union requires\ndisclosure of these administrative law decisions to the\nparties.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If you analogize the STJ to the\nadministrative ALJ. But you might also analogize him to a\nmember of the agency itself, and if you make that analogy,\nit doesn't become so far-fetched, particularly when you\nlook at Morgan as also not allowing you to probe at what's\ngoing on.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Yes. Well, we -- we've avoided\nsuggesting that any depositions should be taken of -- of\njudicial personnel here. That's not our view. Our view\nis simply that the report that was prepared -- it was\nprepared -- should be made part of the record by virtue of\ntwo statutes. There is an appellate review statute,\nJustice O'Connor, that states quite expressly that\nCongress expected review to take place here just as it\ndoes in the district court, to the same degree, to the\nsame extent, and in the same manner. And in the district\ncourt, if an adjunct judge makes a finding of fact,\nwhether it's a master or a magistrate or bankruptcy judge,\nthat is always disclosed to the parties.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Mr. Shapiro, is there any\nevidence in this record that the special trial judge in\nfact changed his report beyond the hearsay affidavit?\nMR. SHAPIRO: We don't know what is contained in\nthat first report. We have heard from three of the\njudges, including the chief judge of the STJ's, that --\nthat what happened was that Judge Dawson rewrote the\ncredibility findings. Now, we won't know until we see\nthis. That could be wrong. But -- but it should be part\nof the record for the court of appeals.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Shapiro, on credibility,\nwhich you have been emphasizing, are you overstating the\ncase for it? Because credibility is more than just\nobserving the witnesses' demeanor. I mean, Judge Dawson\ncould have said, yes, they -- these witnesses might have\nlooked honest to the special trial judge, but considering\nthis documentary evidence in the record, it's clear to me\nthat what the witness said on the stand was a lie.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, you'll see in perhaps a\ndozen situations, he says, I simply don't believe that\nwitness, none of whom he heard. And this is a case where\ncredibility was key. Was there a bribery scheme of the\nkind that the IRS claimed? Every witness who testified\nsaid no, it didn't exist. These are simple investments\nwith the proceeds being paid to the corporations, and yet,\nthe Government's theory was there is some nefarious\nbribery scheme that every witness denied. And there is no\ndocumentary evidence of that. The evidence of the\nproceeds flowing to these corporations was simply the\nresult of their investing money in real estate deals. And\nso credibility was the key to this whole case.\nAnd the -- the Government, I don't think, can be\nserious when it tells this Court that this first report is\nsome confidential document, that it's privileged internal\ndeliberative material. For 40 years, the -- the Tax Court\nmade these reports available to the public. It -- they\nwere routinely served on the parties. For 40 years there\nwas no suggestion --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Would -- would you comment on\nthat? I -- I understood from the brief there was a\nsuggestion that if you prevail, we're going to have a huge\nvolume of -- of printed material that we're not troubled\nwith now.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Oh, yes. That's a post hoc\nrationale. There was no such explanation when this rule\nwas changed, and there's not a bit of work or a bit of\nexpense resulting from our position. We simply ask for a\ncopy of a report that exists. They can serve it on us\nelectronically. It won't cost them a cent. We're making\na very modest request under these statutes and under the\nDue Process Clause. And there was no explanation --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, now, wait. Under the Due\nProcess Clause, I assume you would be asking for more than\njust access to the report. You -- if -- if you're really\nrelying on Morgan II, he who hears must decide, I think\nyou would be saying that after reading the report, you\nshould have the opportunity to argue to the -- to Dawson\nhere, to -- to the Tax Court judge that the report should\nnot be adopted.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, we defer to --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't that part of your due\nprocess case?\nMR. SHAPIRO: It -- it really is not. We're\nasking --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You think it satisfies due\nprocess just to show you the report, and then --\nMR. SHAPIRO: To give -- and make it part of the\nappellate record. We're not asking for any remand to the\nTax Court. If the Tax Court doesn't --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then -- then you're not\nrelying on Morgan II.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, we -- we just rely on that\nas an example of the need to disclose this at an\nappropriate juncture.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There wasn't a need to disclose\nthe point that Morgan II made. It was he who hears must\ndecide.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, in Morgan II, the -- the\npoint was that any -- any proposed findings that are\ndrafted up have to be shared with the parties. Now, there\nthey had to be shared with the parties at the\nadministrative level. We're not going that far. If the\nTax Court tells us that they don't want to have that layer\nof review within the Tax Court, they don't want to receive\nour comments on the initial report, that's fine with us.\nWe want it to be made part of the appellate record so that\nthe judges who are interested in this and believe it will\nshed a strong light on the issue of clear and convincing\nevidence can have this be part of the record.\nAnd already the Fifth Circuit has overturned the\nfinding of fraud in this very same case.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do -- do I understand that\nyou would be satisfied if the Court simply looked to --\nwhat is it -- 7482(a)(1), the appellate review section,\nwhich says that the Tax Court decisions shall be reviewed\nin the same manner and to the same extent as district\ncourt decisions? And that --\nMR. SHAPIRO: Yes. We'd be satisfied because\nthat is a sufficient basis to say the record has to\ninclude the rule 183 report. And it is not up to the\ntrial court to tell the appellate court what's in the\nrecord on appeal. It's up to the appellate court to -- to\ndetermine what goes into that -- that record. This -- the\ncase in the Second Circuit on that is IBM v. United States\nwhere the Second Circuit analyzed rule 10(a) and said it\nis not the province of the trial court to dictate to the\nreviewing court what is in that record.\nAnd this Court in --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And where is it? It's -- it\nis specified someplace, but when you review a district\ncourt decision in -- in a court of appeals, the --\ncertainly the magistrate's report would be included, but\nthere's someplace where it lists the contents, some rule\nthat lists --\nMR. SHAPIRO: Oh, yes. It's rule 10(a) and it's\n-- it's very general. It says that all the original\npapers in the trial court come before the appellate court,\nand an original report is an original document submitted\nin the trial court.\nAnd this Court confronted that question in\nUniversal Camera 50 years ago, and the Government made the\nsame arguments then that it's making now and it lost 7 to\n2 in that case. It -- it said that the report --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Institutional memory. Isn't\nthat -- that's a good institutional memory --\nMR. SHAPIRO: It goes back.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SHAPIRO: The same argument was made that\nthe report is an irrelevance. It's just an aid to the\ndecision-maker, and the decision-maker can do what it\nwants and has ultimate judgmental power. So there's no\nneed to include that report in the record, and no weight\nshould be given to it.\nThis Court said, we will not adopt an\nexclusionary rule for the administrative law judge's\nreport. And this is an a fortiori case because this\nreport is presumed correct. In Universal Camera, there\nwas no presumption of correctness at all. So that -- that\ncase, you know, goes further than -- than what the Court\nhas to do here.\nAnd the Government's argument that -- that\nsomehow this is --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That -- that was decided under\nthe APA, wasn't it? I mean, that was an APA case, which this\nisn't.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, yes, that's true. But, you\nknow, the Court reached out to the APA for guidance in\nconstruing the labor laws. The labor laws were silent on\nthis issue, but under the APA, the Court said the general\npolicy is to disclose these reports and we are going to\nsay that that is applicable to the NLRB.\nNow, the Government says all of this changes the\ncourse because the judge changed his mind, but you know,\nthere are so many opinions and orders and reports in the\nFederal judicial system where a mind is changed and an\nopinion is suppressed or -- or vacated or replaced and\nthat first opinion is still part of the record. It's a\nfallacy to say it's not part of the record just because\nit's been abandoned.\nFor example, if I seek summary judgment in the\ndistrict court and it's denied and then I ask for\nreconsideration and it's granted, the opinion has been\nabandoned, but it's still part of the record. And if I --\nif an appeal is taken, it's going to be exhibit A in any\nappeal, and it may result in a reversal.\nSame thing when a case goes en banc. The panel\nopinion is vacated, but then when -- when cert is granted,\nthe argument before this Court may convince this Court\nthat the panel was right. Even though it's been\nabandoned, it's still very important.\nOr if a jury verdict is set aside -- the -- the\ndistrict court says, judgment as a matter of law -- on\nappeal, the jury -- jury verdict may get sustained. So\nit's just a logical fallacy to say that because somebody\nhas changed his mind, if that's what happened here, that\n-- that the first report drops out of the record.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Would the -- the Tax Court\nrule -- now, this 183(c) -- says -- it describes the\nspecial trial judge's report, which is submitted to the\nchief judge, and then the chief judge assigns a Tax Court\njudge, and then it says that -- that the Tax Court judge\nmay modify it, modify the special trial judge's report, or\nmay reject it in whole or in part. Does the Tax Court\never modify a special trial judge's report? Does it ever\nreject it in whole or in part?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Oh, yes, and -- and the remarkable\nthing is that every time it does that, it recites, we\nhereby adopt the findings and opinions of the trial judge.\nNow, in the old days, that was not a problem.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's one thing that\nthey can do. They can adopt it, but my question is, do\nthey always adopt and never use -- never use the term\nmodify or reject?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Oh, no. They -- they do modify\nand reject. It's just it's hard to determine, when they\nare doing that. In the old days --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They -- they never say so in\ntheir opinion.\nMR. SHAPIRO: They don't --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They always say that they adopt\nthe trial judge's report. Don't they?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Yes. That's entirely correct.\nAnd now, in the old days, before they amended\nthe rule, you could compare the two and see what was\nchanged, but now you can't. You can't tell what has been\nchanged.\nAnd in this instance, we believe there's been a\ncomplete rewrite of that first report, and the appellate\ncourts can't tell what's going on. Was there a reason for\ndoing this? Was deference given? Was some other agenda\nat work in this decision? No one can tell because it is\nall off the record.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What -- what is -- can I ask\nyou a really esoteric administrative law question, which I\nhave never been able to figure out? It's probably\nrelevant, but I -- this is an agency. That's what -- my\ngreat tax professor, Ernie Brown, used to say there is no\nTax Court. He says, the Board of Tax Appeals shall be\nknown as the Tax Court. What he meant by that is it's not\n-- it isn't the Tax Court, just known as. So -- so this\nis an agency, an administrative agency.\nSo I look to the APA for guidance, and the APA,\nwhen you look at the section, says this initial decision\ncan be made by a 556-qualified person. Now, a 556-\nqualified person can include the agency itself or a member\nof the agency or an ALJ.\nThen when you to look at what happens in 557,\nafter that presiding employee makes an initial decision,\nit says you have to give a chance to the party to respond\nto the initial decision, which you like, in the case where\nthe presiding employee -- presiding person is a\nsubordinate employee. And so, that's what I was just\nchecking here.\nAnd so -- so what's supposed to happen where the\npresiding person under 556 for that initial or tentative\ndecision is not a subordinate employee, but rather, quote,\none or more members of the body which comprise the agency?\nI've never run into that before. Maybe you haven't.\nMaybe they didn't mean anything by it, but maybe they did.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, I -- I haven't either. But\nthe judge here certainly was subordinate and --\nJUSTICE BREYER: He was a subordinate employee?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Yes, he was.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Rather than a member -- is --\nis -- if he's a subordinate employee, that's easy. Then\nthe case is easy I think.\nMR. SHAPIRO: He -- he is a subordinate because\nas the Government keeps telling us, the Tax Court judge is\nthe only official spokesman for the court. They get to\nmake the final judgment. And the Tax Court judge reviews\nwhat the STJ has done.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: These -- these --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But you're -- you're not\nasserting that the APA governs this.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Oh --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. I'm just looking --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't there an express\nexception for -- for --\nMR. SHAPIRO: Yes, and this a court. This is an\nArticle I court, this Court has held. And Congress has\ncreated very specific appellate review procedures for this\ncourt.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The -- the special trial\njudge has no tenure, does she?\nMR. SHAPIRO: That's correct. He -- those\njudges could be terminated at will, including because\nthere is not sufficient work for the judge. They can be\nterminated on that basis. And that, we think, colors the\nanalysis here for the reasons Judge Cudahy gave.\nThis is not an independent judge. When he is\npersuaded by his superior to change his mind, it's obvious\nthat he -- in our view, that he's going to be heavily\ninfluenced by that. It's a serious Raddatz problem. The\nonly cure is to make this part of the record and to\nenforce the rule 183 presumption of correctness, which\ncreates a clear error standard of review.\nI see my time has run out. May I reserve the\nrest for --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, you may, of course.\nMr. Hungar.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. HUNGAR\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. HUNGAR: Justice Stevens, and may it please\nthe Court:\nThe central flaw in petitioners' case is that\nboth of the trial court judges responsible for evaluating\nthe evidence in the record reached the same conclusion\nregarding all of the factual issues.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Hungar, before you\nproceed to your legal argument, I was very curious why the\nGovernment is defending this practice because the\nGovernment, after all, is on the other side of every case.\nAnd aren't there situations where it might be that the\nspecial trial judge would call a credibility question in\nthe Government's favor and then the Government loses the\ncase before the Tax Court judge and might like to know,\nbefore it goes to the court of appeals, how solid the\ncredibility findings were? I mean, I -- I -- the\nGovernment being a party to all these proceedings, why is\nit satisfied with not knowing what the report of the\nspecial tax judge -- special trial judge was?\nMR. HUNGAR: Justice Ginsburg, we do know what\nthe report of the special trial judge was. It is in the\nrecord. Judge Couvillion's name is on his report.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: No, it is not the report. It\nis called an opinion. It isn't even called the report,\nand if you will read 183(b), that describes the report.\nDoes anything else describe the report? And what is this\nreport? There is a report. It is submitted to the chief\njudge. What would you call that?\nMR. HUNGAR: The report is the -- contains the\nrecommended findings of fact and opinion, analysis of the\nlaw and application of the law to the fact, of the special\ntrial judge. The report is the findings of fact plus,\nquote, the opinion.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Now, what is the 183(b)\nreport?\nMR. HUNGAR: Well --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There --\nMR. HUNGAR: The -- under rule 183(b), the --\nthe special trial judge submits his report to the chief\njudge. It is then referred to a Tax Court judge.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So that report, the special\ntrial judge's report, is a document prepared by the\nspecial trial judge which he gives to the chief judge.\nMR. HUNGAR: Correct. But the important thing\nto understand, Your Honor, is that nothing in the rule\nprecludes, during the course of the deliberative process\nthat then follows, the special trial judge from concluding\nthat he has made a mistake, that he no longer agrees with\nthe -- the stated findings of fact in that -- in that\noriginal report, from withdrawing and submitting a\ncorrected report.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But that's not the way the rule\nreads. The rule reads, as I understand it, under (c) that\nthe court itself may accept, reject, or modify. It\ndoesn't say anything about the special trial judge\nreconsidering and rewriting his report.\nMR. HUNGAR: It doesn't preclude it either, Your\nHonor. There's a longstanding practice --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, it does because it -- it\ngoes on to say that due regard shall be given to the\ncircumstance that the special trial judge had the\nopportunity to evaluate and the findings of fact\nrecommended by the special trial judge shall be presumed\nto be correct. But if those findings of fact are simply\nthe same findings of fact that he agrees with the rest of\nthe -- the panel on, it just makes no sense at all.\nMR. HUNGAR: The Tax Court judge cannot report\nin -- in the opinion that is issued by the Tax Court, he\ncannot say I'm adopting the opinion and findings of the\nspecial trial judge if the -- if the Tax Court judge does\nnot agree with those and the -- and the special trial\njudge adheres to his original decision. The only way it\nis possible for there to be a change is for the special\ntrial judge himself to determine, in the exercise of his\nresponsibility as a judicial officer, that he made a\nmistake.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What report goes to the chief\njudge?\nMR. HUNGAR: Originally the original report goes\nto the chief judge.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's a report. Is that not a\nreport?\nMR. HUNGAR: It is a report, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why doesn't that -- why isn't\nthat required to be -- to be made public?\nMR. HUNGAR: Because if -- because the --\nbecause the Tax Court has determined that it will not be\nmade public, that it is part of internal deliberation.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's a report. The statute\nsays that the reports have to be made public.\nMR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That is a report.\nMR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And it goes to the --\nMR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No?\nMR. HUNGAR: With respect, the tax -- the -- the\nstatute says a report of the Tax Court must be made\npublic. A -- a report --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but the rule -- the rule\nsays that the first report, the document 1, has to be\ngiven deference. Whether it's presumed to be correct.\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, Justice Kennedy, if I may,\nI'd like first to finish my response to Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Sure.\nMR. HUNGAR: The statutes -- the -- the\ndisclosure requirement applies only to reports of the Tax\nCourt. It is perfectly clear that a report, the original\nreport, or any report of a special trial judge is not and\ncannot be the report of the Tax Court unless it is first\nadopted and approved by a Tax Court judge, and then goes\nthrough the next step of -- of being submitted --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, it's -- it's very hard\nto understand how appellate review can function if that\nfirst report of the special trial judge is never\ndisclosed. I just don't see how the appellate review can\nfunction properly.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And how do we know that it was\n-- that it was presumed to be correct under the rule?\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes. How does the appellate\ncourt know whether deference, as required by the rules,\nwas given unless the appellate court can see it? It's\nsuch a strange procedure.\nWhy, in answer to Justice Ginsburg, does the\ngovernment take the view it does? Wouldn't you like to\nsee it if it went against you?\nMR. HUNGAR: We submit, Your Honor, that there\nis no evidentiary or probative value in an initial\nconclusion that the -- that the person who reached that\nconclusion has abandoned, has concluded was wrong.\nSpecial Trial Judge --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, the rule --\nMR. HUNGAR: -- Couvillion rejected --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- the rule -- the rule 183\ndoes provide for a certain degree of deference to be given\nto those findings of the special trial judge.\nMR. HUNGAR: To the recommended findings of the\nspecial trial judge. And I submit that if the special\ntrial judge has concluded that his initial recommendations\nwere mistaken because, based upon further consideration as\na judicial officer in the exercise of his obligations, he\nhas realized he made a mistake, I submit it would be\nbizarre to require a Tax Court judge to give some sort of\n-- of deference to --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Hungar, do you --\nMR. HUNGAR: -- abandoned findings.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you see somewhat of a\nproblem, that we are not dealing here with the\nrelationship between peers? Judge Dawson is appointed,\nwhat, for a 15-year term. The special trial judge is\nappointed by the Tax Court and his job is at the Tax\nCourt's grace. And if you have compared in your brief\nthat relationship to, say, a discussion among colleagues,\nI think it's worlds different.\nMR. HUNGAR: Justice Ginsburg, Judge Dawson\nactually is a senior judge who was recalled. So he\ndoesn't have the 15-year term protection.\nBut it's true that special trial judges are --\nare appointed by the chief judge, not by the Tax Court\njudges, but by the chief judge, so that Judge Dawson\nwasn't, in a sense, his -- his appointing, employing\nofficial.\nBut more to the point, special --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: He has had a special -- a --\na long term and he is well-known and respected as a Tax\nCourt judge who was appointed, as all other members of the\ncourt were appointed.\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, Judge Couvillion has been a\nspecial trial judge, I think, for nearly 20 years.\nBut the point is special trial judges are bound\nby the code of conduct. The Tax Court has adopted for\nboth Tax Court judges and special trial judges the same\ncode of conduct that applies to Federal judges under\nArticle III, which --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It seems to me --\nMR. HUNGAR: -- obligates independent decision-\nmaking.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It seems to me that it's very\nmuch like, if you have to compare it with something, the\nrelationship between a magistrate and a Federal district\ncourt judge. The magistrate also hears testimony, makes a\nreport, findings, and a recommendation. What's the\ndifference between those two?\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, one difference is that the\ndistrict court judges, as I understand it, appoint the\nmagistrate, not the chief judge.\nBut a more significant difference is that the\nstatute and rules applicable to magistrates require\ndisclosure of their reports and do not treat them as part\nof the internal deliberative process. The Tax Court has\ndetermined that it is inefficient to have disclosure of\nthe original report, then have exceptions and have that\nwhole process followed that they used to follow. They\nhave determined that they will treat the Tax Court --\nexcuse me -- the special trial judge's report --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So where does it say that?\nWhere does it say that?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: They're not requiring the --\nthis case doesn't involve the question of whether they can\nmake objections to the finding in -- in the special\nreport. It's just whether it's disclosed.\nMR. HUNGAR: Yes, Your Honor. But the -- but\nthe Tax Court has determined not to disclose it.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, I understand. But your\nargument about how it would make the proceeding more\ncumbersome, it seems to me, is -- is misplaced.\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, it certainly would be more\ncumbersome if they followed the procedure that they used\nto follow, which we submit, although the record is -- they\ndid not specifically state --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But they're not asking for\nthat. Am -- am I wrong on --\nMR. HUNGAR: Yes, that's true, Your Honor. What\nthey're asking for here, what they say they want is merely\ndisclosure of the original report.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And it's a particularly strong\nargument in a case -- in several of the issues. I\nremember Judge Fromm's opinion turned on the credibility\nof oral testimony, and in one case, Judge Fromm found the\n-- the judge here made an erroneous ruling on credibility\non one issue, if I remember correctly. And it seems to me\nthat's a case in which it would be particularly relevant\nto know the reasons pro and con on why credibility\ndeterminations were made by the person who heard the\nwitnesses.\nMR. HUNGAR: But the person who heard the\nwitnesses is Special Trial Judge Couvillion.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Has been convinced that he was\nwrong.\nMR. HUNGAR: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And the question is, well,\nwhat was his -- what was the basis for his original\nposition when you're evaluating whether you've got a valid\nargument to make on appeal?\nMR. HUNGAR: Under that rationale, Justice\nStevens, every time a district court judge changes his\nmind, after giving further thought to a case --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, no, no.\nMR. HUNGAR: -- before he issues his final\nopinion --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Only if he is required by a\nrule to make certain findings and to deliver a completed\nreport to someone else.\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, again, the -- the rule does\nnot preclude the practice. It is a common practice --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It doesn't forbid it. You're\nright. It doesn't forbid it in so many words. But I just\nwonder, does it comport with your normal notions of a fair\nway to conduct a fair hearing, letting the parties know\nwhat the basis for decision was and who thought what about\nthe witnesses and so forth?\nMR. HUNGAR: Absolutely, Your Honor. If the --\nin a -- when a -- when a court has a collegial\ndeliberative process involving more than one person that\nis involved in the decision-making -- certainly this is an\nunusual process in that -- and there is no identical\nanalog, but we see no due process problem.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No. But I don't see what is\nconsistent with your notion of a deliberative process as\nproducing the report and the presumption of correctness in\nthe rule. The rule presumes that some original document,\nwhich you are treating as provisional, enjoys a\npresumption of correctness, and I don't see the\nconsistency between provisionality and deliberate\ncharacter on the one hand and presumption on the other.\nMR. HUNGAR: If I may, Your Honor, the rule does\nnot state that the, quote, original report shall receive a\npresumption of correctness. It doesn't even say that --\nthat any report shall receive a presumption of\ncorrectness. It says the findings of fact recommended by\nthe special trial judge.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And aren't those findings of\nfact the findings of fact that are delivered to the chief\njudge in the report that is made to the chief judge before\nit is even assigned to a Tax Court judge?\nMR. HUNGAR: Not if -- not if the tax -- if the\nspecial trial judge has abandoned those recommendations,\nwithdrawn those recommendations, and replaced them.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But he hasn't abandoned them at\nthe point that he delivers them to the chief judge, and if\nthat's what this is referring to, then the presumption of\nthe -- of -- of correctness necessarily has to apply to\nwhatever the document is that's delivered to the chief\njudge.\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, it applies to the report, but\nI submit that if the special trial judge withdraws in\norder to correct an error in the report, what he submits\nas the corrected report is then the, quote, report.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You're -- you're --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why isn't that explained in\nthe rules, if that's the process?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- have a condition\nsubsequent. It seems to me that you're saying, Mr.\nHungar, that the last sentence of 183 is unenforceable.\nMR. HUNGAR: The -- the credibility -- the due\nregard and presumption of --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: The presumption.\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, it's important to understand\nalso that, in fact, it would violate the Internal Revenue\nCode. This rule must be construed to be consistent with\nthe Internal Revenue Code. The Internal Revenue Code\nmakes very clear, and this Court held in Freytag, that the\nTax Court judge, not the special trial judge, is the\ndecision-maker, the only finder of fact in these kinds of\ncases under subsection (b)(4) of the statute. This Court\nso held in Freytag and the -- and the statute makes that\nvery clear. So it would violate the statute to construe\nthis, as petitioners do, to require some sort of\ndeferential clear error review.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So you're saying the rule\nitself in that respect is invalid?\nMR. HUNGAR: If construed as petitioners would\nhave it, yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, how else could you\npossibly construe it? There's no presumption operating at\nall on your reading.\nMR. HUNGAR: In the tax context, Your Honor, the\n-- there is a presumption of correctness that attaches to\nassessments and deficiency notices issued by --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No, but you're saying there is\n-- there is no presumption of correctness that can operate\nwith respect to the report that goes first to the chief\njudge because, I understood you to say, to do that would\nviolate the Internal Revenue Code provision that the fact-\nfinder and the only fact-finder is the Tax Court judge.\nAnd therefore, I think the implication of what you're\nsaying is that the rule on its face is invalid.\nMR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, presumption of\ncorrectness does not necessarily equate with clear error,\ndeferential review. That's my point.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I'm -- I'm not even getting to\nwhatever the standard of review may be. I presume the\nword presumption means something other than it's there\nunless you want to change it later after the person who\nemploys you objects to it. It's got to mean something\nmore than that.\nMR. HUNGAR: What the presumption of correctness\nmeans in the tax context, with respect to deficiency\ndeterminations and the like, is that the burden of going\nforward is on the party seeking to change what -- what --\nthe determination that is presumed correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But there's no party who is\nseeking to change at this point because the parties don't\nknow what's in it. They're not going forward. This is,\nas you point out, an internal process that is going on\nhere. So that definition can't apply.\nMR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor. If -- there --\nthere are two processes that go on. The Tax Court judge,\nquite appropriately, we -- we assume and have -- have no\nreason to disagree, confers with, discusses with the\nspecial trial judge. If -- if in the course of that\ndiscussion, one or both of them come to the conclusion\nthat something is wrong in the original report and if the\nspecial trial judge agrees, the special trial judge has\nthe option of withdrawing his original report, submitting\na corrected report, and having the presumption of\ncorrectness, whatever it means, apply to his corrected\nreport. If -- if --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: In -- in that discussion, does\nthe Tax Court judge have to give great weight to the\nfindings of fact of the -- of the special judge?\nMR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor, not great weight\nbecause, again, that would violate the statute.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Any weight?\nMR. HUNGAR: He is to give due -- the due regard\nprovision we think is essentially precatory, as the -- as\nthe Seventh Circuit said. It reminds the -- the Tax Court\njudge that he should not lightly set aside the credibility\ndeterminations. But again, that's not what happened here.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So I -- I think your -- I think\nyour answer then is not that this is invalid. It is\nsimply unenforceable. It is precatory language, looks\nokay, but there's no way to police it.\nMR. HUNGAR: It's certainly not enforceable in\nan appellate court. That's correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Judicially it cannot be\nenforced.\nMR. HUNGAR: That's correct, because otherwise\nit would violate the statute if it imposed some meaningful\nlimitation.\nBut again, it's important to understand here the\nTax Court judge did not exercise his authority in this\ncase to reverse or set aside the special trial judge's\nfindings. He could have done so --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do they -- do they ever? I\nmean, this -- this says, this decision -- it's labeled --\nthe -- the court agrees with and adopts the opinion of the\nspecial trial judge. Are there Tax Court cases where the\nTax Court says, instead of that, the court modifies the\ndecision of the special trial judge or the court rejects,\nin whole or in part, the report of the special trial\njudge?\nMR. HUNGAR: We cite --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do Tax Court opinions come\nout that way?\nMR. HUNGAR: We cite in footnote 4 a small\nnumber of cases from prior to the last rule change in\nwhich that occurred. In addition, there are at least a\ncouple of cases since the rule change in which the Tax\nCourt judge rejected parts of the opinion, but not the\nfindings. We're not aware of any cases in which the Tax\nCourt judge has rejected the findings, but there are other\ncases -- Little against Commissioner, 103 T.C. 285; Walker\nagainst Commissioner, 101 T.C. 537 -- in which the Tax\nCourt judge expressed a disagreement with a portion of the\nopinion of the special trial judge and then proceeded to\ndecide the case in the manner he or she thought --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Because if one were just to\nrule this -- read this rule straight: first, the report\nthat goes to the chief judge, and then it says that the\nTax Court judge may modify it, reject it in whole --\nadopt, modify, or reject in whole or in part. You would\nexpect, if we were having truth in labeling, that\nwhenever, with consultation, without, there's a difference\nbetween the two documents, the Tax Court judge, in\ncombination with the special trial judge or without, would\nsay, action on the report -- action on the report, which\nis the special trial judge's report, is it is modified or\nit is rejected or it is rejected in part. I mean --\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, again, that assumes that the\n-- that the -- the rule compels the interpretation that\nthe special trial judge is prohibited from withdrawing,\ncorrecting, and resubmitting his report. I submit it does\nnot compel that interpretation, and the Tax Court --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The rule -- the rule doesn't\nsay anything about this consultation that you've\ndescribed. And if that's the Tax Court's procedure, why\nisn't it laid out in the rules so everyone can see it\ninstead of being deceived by reading here is the special\ntrial judge's report, and now what the Tax Court will do\nis either adopt, modify, or reject in whole or in part?\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, I don't think it -- I mean, I\ndon't think it's -- it's deceitful, the -- the possibility\nthat a court --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Misleading. Because when I\njust read this rule cold, that's what I assumed, that we\nhave the initial report and then it goes to the Tax Court\njudge, and that judge does something with it, and that\nsomething may be adopt, it may be modify, it may be reject\nin whole or in part.\nMR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, when the Tax Court\nadopted its present procedures in 1984, it -- it certainly\ndid not do so in as artful a manner as it could have. But\nthe question is whether it violates the statute or due\nprocess for it to do what it has done.\nLet me just -- we've been spending most of our\ntime talking about this issue of whether the Tax Court --\nthe special trial judge is permitted to change his report\nunder rule 183. That's not even one of the questions in\nthe questions presented. The only rule 183 question in\nthe questions presented is whether the rule requires clear\nerror review. We submit the answer to that is no because\nit would violate the Internal Revenue Code. So this --\nthis question about whether the report permits -- whether\nthe rule permits the report to be changed isn't even one\nof the questions presented.\nThe courts of appeals upheld the judgment on the\npremise that it was permissible for the Tax Court judge\nand the trial -- the special trial judge to engage in the\ndeliberative process and for the special trial judge to\nrevise his findings as he did --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I don't think there's any --\nany question they can change the report, but the one --\nthe one -- I'd like to ask you a question as a matter of\ninformation. The first sentence of 183(c) refers to the\npossibility that the judge to whom the case is assigned\nmay direct the filing of additional briefs to receive\nfurther evidence and oral argument. Does it ever happen\nthat before the judge to whom it's assigned decides\nwhether or not to go along with the recommended findings,\nthat he will direct oral argument? Does that ever happen?\nMR. HUNGAR: I don't know the answer to that,\nYour Honor. I'm not aware of that, but --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Because if he did, it would\nseem almost necessary for him to disclose to the parties\nwhat the report they're arguing about would say.\nMR. HUNGAR: Again, I -- this is a holdover from\nthe prior version of the rule in which the exceptions\nprocess was followed, and again, it may be that had the\nTax Court given it further consideration, they might have\nviewed that unnecessary. But we're not aware of that\nhappening.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But it certainly seems to\ncontemplate deliberation by the judge to whom the case is\nassigned about whether or not to accept the report and\ndeliberation which might be informed from input -- input\nfrom the parties. That's a fair reading of the rule, I\nthink.\nMR. HUNGAR: If --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Maybe it's not practiced.\nMR. HUNGAR: -- if the Tax Court judge so\ndetermines, yes. The rule certainly allows that, but it\ndoesn't obviously require that.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And if he did then ask for\nfurther briefings, do you think that there would then have\nbeen a requirement to disclose the report?\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, presumably it would be a\nwaste of everyone's time unless he -- I don't know that he\nwould have to disclose the report, but he would need to\ndirect their attention to the issue he would like them to\nbrief.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me that the author\nof this subsection (c) must have contemplated the\npossibility of disclosure of the report.\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, again, Your Honor, this\nlanguage was adopted at a time when they followed the\nexception --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: When they followed a different\nprocedure, and the question is to how much -- how much did\nthey intend the -- to change that prior procedure.\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, we know that the Tax Court\nhas interpreted its rule to permit precisely the practice\nit followed here because it said so. And it would be\nquite extraordinary, we submit, for this Court to reverse\nthe Tax Court, which is surely entitled to considerable\ndeference in interpreting its own rules, since, after all,\nthe Tax Court has exclusive statutory authority to\npromulgate its own rules, and particularly with respect to\nthis issue about whether the special trial judge can\nchange his report, since that was not even one of the\nquestions presented.\nIf I may turn to -- back to the statutory\nquestion. Section 7461 requires disclosure of reports of\nthe Tax Court. The special trial judge report is not the\nreport of the Tax Court. Indeed, even a Tax Court judge's\nopinion and report does not become the report of the Tax\nCourt.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Does the statute you just\nquoted prohibit the disclosure of other reports if we call\nthis first draft something other than a report?\nMR. HUNGAR: The statute doesn't --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: In other words, would -- would\nthe rule go further than the statute?\nMR. HUNGAR: The statute does not prohibit the\ndisclosure of other reports, but the rule clearly does not\nrequire the disclosure of reports. The Tax Court in 1984\namended the rule to make perfectly clear that -- that\ninitial reports of special trial judges are not to be\ndisclosed. The Tax Court said in its orders in this case\nthe reason for that is that those are now internal\ndeliberative processes. The Tax Court has made clear that\nits rules permit exactly what it's doing here.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Hungar, you started to say\nthat -- that even the opinion of a -- of a Tax Court judge\nis not a report of the Tax Court.\nMR. HUNGAR: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How does that work?\nMR. HUNGAR: Page 2a of the appendix to the gray\nbrief, at the bottom of the page, section 7460(b) provides\nthat the report of the division -- and the Tax Court is\nnow and has for many years been divided into one-judge\ndivisions. They used to sit en banc or --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I was -- I was going to ask you\nwhat -- what 7461 referred to when it says the Tax Court\nand its divisions.\nMR. HUNGAR: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It also is referred to there.\nMR. HUNGAR: For a brief period of time, they\nsat in -- in panels.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I see.\nMR. HUNGAR: But they -- the -- the press of\nwork force them to -- to divide into one-judge divisions.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So it's a single judge is a\ndivision of the Tax Court.\nMR. HUNGAR: Yes, that's correct.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And the publicity of\nproceedings does say -- it does say that all reports of\nthe Tax Court --\nMR. HUNGAR: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And all evidence received by\nthe Tax Court and its divisions, meaning its single\njudges.\nWell, what happens with -- with a single judge's\nopinion?\nMR. HUNGAR: He -- he prepares it and submits it\nto the chief judge under rule -- under statute -- under\nthe statute 7460(b) where it says the report of the\ndivision shall become the report of the Tax Court within\n30 days after such report by the division, unless the\nchief judge directs it to be reviewed by the full court.\nSo -- so even a Tax Court judge's opinion is not the\nreport of the Tax Court. Surely the report of the special\ntrial judge is not either.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It's like an en banc. I -- I\nhave written decisions for a panel in my years on the\ncourt of appeals, and there's been an en banc and my\nopinion gets vacated. It's no longer counts for anything.\nAnd isn't that exactly what the Tax Court is? They have\nthe --\nMR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor. The -- the opinion\nis not made public. In fact, the statute precludes it\nfrom being made -- made a part of the record. The last\nsentence of that same section 7460(b) at the top of page\n3a, it says the report of a division shall not be a part\nof the record in any case in which the chief judge directs\nthat such report shall be reviewed by the Tax Court. And\nthat's a very important point. Congress has mandated by\nstatute essentially the same procedure that the Tax Court\nfollows here.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Oh, no. No, no, no. How\noften, when there is a decision reviewed by the court, so\nthat the initial judge's decision is changed, does that\njudge dissent, so all the world knows what that judge's\ninitial position was?\nMR. HUNGAR: The -- the Tax Court judge\ncertainly has the authority to dissent, just as a special\ntrial judge has the authority and, indeed, the obligation\nunder the code of conduct to refuse to put his name on a\n-- on a report if he doesn't agree with it. If he doesn't\nagree with the Tax Court judge's view, he has the\nobligation, the ethical obligation -- and we presume he\nfollows it -- to say I don't agree. This is my report.\nIf you --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Then he -- then he can\npublish his -- he can publish his dissent, just as a Tax\nCourt judge can?\nMR. HUNGAR: No, but he can preclude the Tax\nCourt judge from doing what the Tax Court judge did in\nthis case, which is simply adopting his report. If the --\nif the special trial judge refuses to change his report --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But then we still won't know\nwhat his report is. Yes, he can say, I won't sign this.\nTax Court says, fine. This rule says I can reject your\nfindings in whole or in part. I don't need your name on\nthis decision of the Tax Court.\nMR. HUNGAR: Justice Ginsburg, if -- if that\nwere the case here, obviously our arguments would be more\ndifficult. But that is not what happened here. If --\nif --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm asking you just as the --\nthe judge who disagrees with the -- the full court can\npublish his dissent, can the special trial judge who\ndisagrees with the Tax Court judge publish his dissent?\nMR. HUNGAR: In the -- the one case involving a\nchange in the opinion, where the Tax Court judge said, I\ndon't adopt a portion of the opinion of the special trial\njudge, there was no published opinion of the special trial\njudge. So I don't believe there's a procedure for the\ndissent.\nBut the point is the court of appeals --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Has there ever been? Has\nthere ever been?\nMR. HUNGAR: A published dissent by a special\ntrial judge? Not that I'm aware of.\nBut the point is the court of --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And how -- how often does the\n-- is there a dissent when there's -- when there's a full\ncourt review decision?\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, there's often a dissent.\nIt's -- it's hard to know from the standpoint of a\nresearcher when -- when it is that the judge who heard the\nevidence and tried the case is the one who's dissenting,\nunless they happen to say it in their opinion, because\nagain, there's no original opinion issued by the Tax Court\njudge who first heard the case. That's kept confidential\nby statute, which again is an important point.\nCongress has mandated confidentiality of the\ninitial reports prepared even by Tax Court judges, and it\nhas given the Tax Court plenary authority to promulgate\nrules governing special trial judges. It is hardly\nsurprising, let alone impermissible under the statute or\nDue Process Clause, for the Tax Court to follow a similar\nprocess for special trial judges.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Except that the -- the\nrelationship between the -- the one judge and the full Tax\nCourt is a relationship basically of people who are in the\nsame boat with respect to what they know about or can know\nabout law and what they can know about the evidence and\nthe facts of the case; whereas the relationship between\nthe special trial judge and the judge to whom it is\nassigned is -- is quite different because only one of them\nhas heard evidence and only one of them is the source of\nconclusion about fact.\nMR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor. It's identical.\nThe -- the full Tax Court --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It certainly is not identical\nin -- in the sense that the -- the Tax Court judge then\ngoes and listens to evidence. He doesn't. That's the\nwhole point.\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, neither does the full Tax\nCourt when it --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Neither does the full Tax\nCourt, but if the full Tax Court is disagreeing with one\njudge, the one judge and the full Tax Court are in the\nsame boat. They have access to the same material. Their\nlimits are exactly the same in each case. That is not\ntrue in the relationship between the single Tax Court\njudge and the special Tax Court judge. The special Tax\nCourt judge is the only one who has heard evidence and can\nfind facts based upon the evidence that he heard.\nMR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor. The -- the tax --\nthe full Tax Court doesn't go back and -- and hold a new\ntrial, just like the individual Tax Court judges --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I -- I am quite aware of that.\nThat's not -- that's not the point. I'm -- I'm saying\nthat you cannot draw an analogy between one judge and full\nTax Court and use that as an analogy to legitimize the\nrelationship between one judge and a trial master. They\nare in different positions. They are not in parallel\npositions.\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, then if -- if I understand\nthe point you're making, it's a point of the -- the --\nit's the hierarchy issue, if that's -- if that's the point\nyou're making.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: It's the knowledge issue. The\nspecial Tax Court judge heard somebody.\nMR. HUNGAR: So did the Tax Court judge --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Nobody on the Tax Court did.\nMR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor. That's incorrect.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: In other words, they're --\nthey're sitting hearing witnesses? They are -- they are\nredoing the trial? Surely not.\nMR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, in a review -- if a Tax\nCourt judge -- most Tax Court cases are tried by Tax Court\njudges. Tax Court judges are trial judges, and if a Tax\nCourt judge tries a case --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But we are talking about\nsituations in which the trial judge is the special judge.\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, I'm talking about the full\nTax Court, Your Honor. If the full Tax Court reviews an\nindividual Tax Court judge's decision, the Tax Court judge\nhas presided over the trial, heard the evidence, just like\nthe special trial judge here, and then the full Tax Court\njudge reviews it.\nThat's exactly what happened in the Estate of\nVarian case, which is in our briefs, out of the Ninth\nCircuit. The parties complained that they wanted access\nto the original judge's report because he had been\nreversed -- been reversed by the full court after trial on\nan -- on an evidentiary issue, and the Ninth Circuit said\nno.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Hungar, I think we\nunderstand your answer.\nMR. HUNGAR: Thank you.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Shapiro, you have about 4\nminutes left.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN M. SHAPIRO\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. SHAPIRO: The question came up whether rule\n183 forbids disclosure of this report. The answer is it\ndoes not forbid disclosure of the report. It is silent on\nthe point. But the press release the Tax Court issued in\n1983, coming from the chief judge of the court, said that\nthis simply meant that it would not automatically be\ndisclosed.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why does 7461 require its --\nits disclosure? Because it does say that the -- it's only\nthe decision of the Tax Court.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That reports of the Tax Court\nthat have to be disclosed.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Our view is that of -- of the Tax\nCourt means any report emanating from the Tax Court.\nThat's the literal meaning of that language. It doesn't\nmean final.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that -- that would mean\nthat -- that you would have to make public the -- the\nreports of a regular Tax Court judge in cases that then go\non to the full court. And that's not done, is it?\nMR. SHAPIRO: There's an exception for the en\nbanc situation because legal issues are addressed en banc,\nnot the factual issues. And there's an opportunity to\ndissent.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but it doesn't matter.\nIt would still be a report of the Tax Court if you don't\ntake that language literally. If you say any report\ncoming out of the institution is a report of the Tax\nCourt, you would have to make public the reports of the\nindividual Tax Court judges, which is not done.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Oh, we say there's a special\nstatute dealing with the en banc situation that -- that\ngoverns in that situation. And that the publicity --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why is that? What -- what\nstatute is that?\nMR. SHAPIRO: That -- that's the en banc\nprovision that counsel referred to that said that when the\ncase is heard en banc, the trial -- the -- the single\njudge's report is not made part of the record. Congress'\nassumption there was that there would be a new -- new\nreport issued. People would be able to dissent if they\ndisagreed. And this process focuses on legal issues.\nThere is no presumption of correctness.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That's not a -- that's not a\nde novo -- they can rehear matters de novo on the en banc\nTax Court, can they not? That's a de novo hearing.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Yes, but it addresses legal\nissues. It's not a device to second guess factual\ndeterminations, and there's a special statute that deals\nwith that, which does not apply to this STJ situation,\nwhere there's a presumption of correctness applicable to\nwhat the trial judge does. And there is the general\ndisclosure statute that applies there.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I don't know if I'm getting --\nso that's his basic point. The rule doesn't require the\ndisclosure because they've interpreted it differently\nwithin their -- within their discretion. Statute\ndoesn't require it and the Constitution doesn't require\nit. We have to go to the Constitution, I don't see\nexactly the implications. So I'm nervous.\nAnd now, the reports -- he says, go read\n7460(b). That's what they're talking about. And then --\nand again, I don't know what I'm getting into once I read\nit more broadly than that. And what about all evidence\nreceived by the Tax Court, including a transcript. Of\ncourse, this isn't evidence but neither is a transcript.\nAnd -- and so maybe that word evidence can be read more\nbroadly, given the fact that it's to include a transcript\nof the stenographic report.\nMR. SHAPIRO: I think you're right, and --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You think I'm right just\nsuddenly for the for the first time? You have thought of\nthis?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, I -- I think that the intent\nof this provision -- and I know Your Honor consults the\nlegislative history. The intent was to make all of the\nsteps in the adjudicative process transparent, including\nthe evidence, including the -- the stenographer's report,\nand all reports from the Tax Court.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There's -- there's a very\ncareful use of language. It says all reports of the Tax\nCourt and all evidence received by the Tax Court and its\ndivisions. So it's only the evidence that -- that's\nreceived by the individual judges has to be made public,\nnot the reports.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, we believe that the word all\nis a broad, generic inclusive term that should be applied,\nas Judge Cudahy stated, to an STJ report that actually has\nto be submitted to the chief judge and that has legal\neffect. It's not just a casual document like a law clerk\nmemorandum. It has legally operative effect.\nCongress' purpose here was very broad, to have\ntransparency, applicable to all the steps along the way in\nthe Tax Court. It was quite clear on that, that there are\narbitrary actions at each step of the way. If you look at\nthe Senate report and Congressman LaGuardia's statements,\nthey said secrecy is a vicious practice in this context,\nand it -- it should be avoided.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But we -- we don't have to\nget into any of that if we accept your argument about\n7482(a)(1), that is, the record will be in the same manner\nand to the same extent as decisions of the district court.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Absolutely, Your Honor. There --\nthere are three separate bases for ruling in our favor.\nOne is the appellate review statute. The other is the\ndisclosure statute. The third is due process. And due\nprocess should inform the construction of these statutes.\nThis Court tries to avoid serious due process issues\nthrough its interpretation of legislation. Judge Cudahy\nsuggested that was the right way to decide this case and\nwe agree that it is.\nWe thank the Court.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Shapiro.\n"
