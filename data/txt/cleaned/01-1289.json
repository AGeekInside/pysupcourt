Campbell and others.\nMs. Birnbaum, you may proceed whenever you're\nready.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF SHEILA L. BIRNBAUM\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMS. BIRNBAUM: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThis case arose from a single failure by State\nFarm to settle a third party automobile case in the State\nof Utah within the policy limits of its insured in Utah.\nThere was evidence in the record, uncontroverted\nevidence, that this was the only case in the State of Utah\nwhere a policyholder of State Farm had been subject to\npotentially a threat of execution on a judgment. All of\nthe other judgments that were in excess of policy limits,\nwhich there were seven of in the State of Utah over a 14-\nyear period, including both before and after\nMr. Campbell's case --\nQUESTION: Ms. Birnbaum, may I ask you a\nquestion about the record?\nMS. BIRNBAUM: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: As I understand the other side, what\nis at issue is a policy that your company had over the\nyears, I forget the name of it, BP and something or other,\nand I looked for that policy in the record, and I couldn't\nfind it. Is it in the record? Is there a written --\nMS. BIRNBAUM: It's in the lodging, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: It's a lodging?\nMS. BIRNBAUM: It's at 1506 to 1531 in the\nlodging, and if you look at the B, so-called PP&R -- it's\ncalled the Performance Planning and Review Manual -- it is\na guide. It is a personnel evaluation guide on how to\nevaluate personnel, and it applies to all, all the\npersonnel of State Farm, all thousands of personnel, and\nwhat the plaintiff did was to cherry-pick from this long\nmanual which is in the lodging, as I said, one or two\npoints that didn't even apply to claims adjustors or\nclaims representatives, but to supervisors, to try to\ncreate this pervasive nationwide scheme that there was an\nattempt by State Farm over 20 years to lessen the claims\nthat they were paying and not pay the fair value of\nclaims.\nQUESTION: Nonetheless, if the jury found such a\npolicy, that there was a policy as alleged by the\nplaintiff, that's not -- we have to take that as a given,\ndon't we, Ms. Birnbaum?\nMS. BIRNBAUM: You may have to take that as a\ngiven, Your Honor, but the question becomes, how is that\npolicy related in any way to this decision to try a case\nin the State of Utah, and how can State Farm be punished\nfor its nationwide conduct, when all this case was about,\nand should have been about --\nQUESTION: Do you say the evidence of conduct in\nother jurisdictions should have been excluded, it was\ninadmissible?\nMS. BIRNBAUM: Your Honor, some evidence could\nhave come in under this Court's determination in BMW to\nshow reprehensibility, but evidence that could have come\nin to show reprehensibility had to be comparable to the\nconduct that was at stake here.\nQUESTION: Well, what do you say to the argument\non the other side that the instances of conduct involving\nfacts having nothing to do with settlement within policy\nlimits, all came in, in effect as rebuttal, as admissible\nrebuttal evidence in response to issues that State Farm\nraised?\nMS. BIRNBAUM: Your Honor, the record is replete\nin our opening brief. We cite to the many times all of\nthis evidence came in on direct, of the plaintiff's\nexperts and the plaintiff's so-called fact experts.\nThat's a makeshift argument. This didn't just come in.\nThis was a 2 and month trial on -- and most of that trial\nwas geared to this nationwide scheme.\nAnd more importantly, if you look at what the\nUtah Supreme Court said in reinstating this incredibly\nexcessive verdict, 145 to 1, when you look at that, it is\nvery clear that the Utah Supreme Court was looking at a\nnational scheme.\nQUESTION: Well, yes, that may be. I mean, I\nthink there's no question it was looking at a national\nscheme. The question is whether our gripe, or your gripe\nis with the Utah Supreme Court or with the case as it was\ntried, and I take it your answer to my question is, there\nwas evidence going to practices having nothing to do with\nsettlement within policy limits that did come in without\nany relationship to rebuttal at all.\nMS. BIRNBAUM:\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMS. BIRNBAUM: And it's all cited in our brief,\nin our opening brief, many, many times.\nQUESTION: And why doesn't --\nQUESTION: And were objections made each time?\nMS. BIRNBAUM: Your Honor, there was not,\nbecause that wasn't necessary in the State of Utah. If a\nlitigant objects in limine to the introduction of this\nevidence, which was done --\nQUESTION: That was done.\nMS. BIRNBAUM: That was many times done, and\nYour Honor, when this case came down with the case of BMW\nv. Gore, there was an oral argument made that that kind of\nevidence was unconstitutional under Gore, because it was\ndissimilar and extraterritorial.\nQUESTION: Ms. Birnbaum, why doesn't it go to\nreprehensibility if it were true that this failure to\nsettle claims that were quite valid was simply part of a\nnationwide pattern to pay out less than was due, not just\nin this context but in every context? Why doesn't that go\nto reprehensibility?\nMS. BIRNBAUM: Because, Your Honor, if we are --\nif we permit litigants to create this overriding scheme\nthat you are engaged in fraud in all your business\npractices, and that you can be punished for that, it is as\nif in Gore --\nQUESTION: Well, I think it does go to\nreprehensibility if we're giving some kind of an ethical\nreport card to State Farm.\nMS. BIRNBAUM: Your Honor --\nQUESTION: It does not go to reprehensibility, I\nwould think would be your point, as to the harm suffered\nby this plaintiff.\nMS. BIRNBAUM: Absolutely.\nQUESTION: And that seems to me the difference.\nMS. BIRNBAUM: Absolutely. Your Honor --\nQUESTION: You say it would go to\nreprehensibility, and it would go to the harm suffered by\nthis plaintiff, if they introduced evidence of doing the\nsame thing to other plaintiffs in other States, the same\nthing to other plaintiffs. How does that go to the harm\nto this plaintiff?\nMS. BIRNBAUM: Well, Your Honor --\nQUESTION: You know, I don't understand how you\ncan possibly say you cannot introduce evidence from other\nStates, and at the same time say, unless it's introduced\nto show reprehensibility.\nOnce you say you're allowed to introduce it for\nreprehensibility, I don't know why all of this doesn't go\nto show that State Farm is more reprehensible.\nMS. BIRNBAUM: Your Honor, because in Gore v.\nBMW this Court, the majority of this Court held that you\ncan introduce on the reprehensibility question similar\nconduct that compares to the conduct that occurred to the\nparticular plaintiff in the underlying case.\nQUESTION: Of course, that's all that was\noffered in Gore, of course.\nMS. BIRNBAUM: But that -- but Your Honor, it\nwould be like --\nQUESTION: So we didn't really have to reach\nyour question in that case.\nMS. BIRNBAUM: Your Honor, but it would be like\nin Gore saying that there was a plan to maximize profits,\nand that not only could you introduce and consider the\nrepair issues that occurred in Gore, but you could also\nshow that there was discrimination against minority\ncustomers, that there was --\nQUESTION: But the answer is that all that does\ngo to reprehensibility. It does. A person who commits\nthis conduct and is part of a company that engages in all\nkinds of bad action is a person who is somewhat more\nreprehensible than if you worked for a company that\ndoesn't engage in all this bad action, but I thought your\npoint was that that's true, but unless you draw a line\nlike the line that was drawn in Gore, you are inviting a\njury to punish the company for all kinds of things that\ntruly do make them more reprehensible, but without\nstandards, without a legislature telling them how\nreprehensible, et cetera.\nMS. BIRNBAUM: I couldn't have said it any\nbetter, Your Honor.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Well then, maybe -- maybe you can\ntell me how one defines reprehensibility so that it only\nincludes what you call the same acts. Maybe you can tell\nme. That's what gives me the trauma, and you say not\ndifferent acts. What is different acts? It has to be\nsomething --\nMS. BIRNBAUM: Well, I think --\nQUESTION: -- other than a policyholder who --\nyou know, who passed five, six cars on the highway?\nMS. BIRNBAUM: No. No, you have --\nQUESTION: Why isn't cheating all policyholders\nin all contexts, paying less than they're entitled to, why\nisn't that similar to what happened here?\nMS. BIRNBAUM: Because it had nothing to do with\nwhat happened here, and I'd like to explain to you. Maybe\nit's a little -- but what happens in third party and first\nparty cases, in this particular case there was a decision\nto go to trial.\ntrial? Because at least the lawyers for State Farm in\nsome of the claims represented felt this was a no\nliability case. Mr. and Mrs. Campbell said that they were\nnot liable, that they didn't cause this accident. This\nwasn't a no-brainer. There was evidence. The jury\ndecided on other evidence.\nBut when you bring into this equation 20 years\nof conduct that, some of it that is lawful, this wasn't\nonly fraudulent conduct. This jury heard and was\ninstructed -- not instructed, but in the summation there\nwas references to the payment of non-OEM, the\nspecification of non-OEM parts, was perfectly legal in\nalmost every jurisdiction.\nQUESTION: How would you formulate the standard\nthat you want us to adopt, the standard which confines the\nreprehensibility evidence to what you deem to be\nappropriate in a case such as this?\nMS. BIRNBAUM: I think --\nQUESTION: What rule do we have?\nMS. BIRNBAUM: I think, Your Honor, the proper\nreprehensibility inquiry is limited to an examination of a\ndefendant's specific misconduct toward the plaintiff and\nsimilar conduct by the defendant toward others, but it has\nto be similar. This was not similar conduct requiring --\nQUESTION:\none of the lines was similar conduct and in the same\nState, but in the automobile, automobiles, we're a very\nmobile society, so I don't think -- well, perhaps you are,\nbut you said this is, we draw a line around Utah, but\nsuppose the driver who was insured by State Farm was from\nCalifornia, or from New York, where you get more than\nseven incidents out of 14 years?\nMS. BIRNBAUM: But the question here was, was\nthere a bad faith failure to settle? That is the conduct.\nIf there was evidence of bad faith failure to settle in\nother States, that could come in on reprehensibility.\nThat could inform the jury in some way, and under BMW v.\nGore, you said that that kind of conduct, similar conduct\nin BMW was identical conduct.\nQUESTION: Well then, then you have no concern\nwith punishing for acts that took place out of State?\nMS. BIRNBAUM: No, I --\nQUESTION: You're abandoning that, or --\nMS. BIRNBAUM: We have not gotten to the ratio\nof the comparable penalties questions under BMW. We were\njust focusing on reprehensibility.\nQUESTION: What is similar conduct in BMW, to\ngive some feel for what you mean by similar conduct?\nMS. BIRNBAUM: Exactly what the Court --\nQUESTION:\nor is it selling -- what about, you sell cars with\ndefective, knowingly, with defective clutches? Would that\nbe similar?\nMS. BIRNBAUM: No, it would not.\nQUESTION: It would -- it has to be cars with\nscratches, it has to be the same thing?\nMS. BIRNBAUM: It's the conduct --\nQUESTION: Wow.\nMS. BIRNBAUM: It was the conduct that occurred\nin that case. In that case there was a failure to tell\nconsumers --\nQUESTION: The car had a scratch.\nMS. BIRNBAUM: -- that the car had a --\nQUESTION: So the only cases that are relevant\nare other cases where BMW pawned off cars that had\nscratches? It could pawn off all sorts of other defects,\nbut not scratches?\nMS. BIRNBAUM: If you open it up to all kinds of\nother defects, then you're opening it up --\nQUESTION: You lose, right.\nMS. BIRNBAUM: You're opening it up --\n(Laughter.)\nMS. BIRNBAUM: -- to the kind of thing that can\nhappen here, especially if it gets punished. In this case\nthere was a million dollars' worth of compensatory\ndamages, a substantial number, and this verdict was 145\ntimes that. That could only be considered because it was\npunishing all of this extraterritorial, dissimilar, and in\nmany instances, lawful conduct.\nQUESTION: I thought we had just gotten off the\nextraterritorial -- where you said it wouldn't make any\ndifference if the insured was from California or from\nUtah.\nMS. BIRNBAUM: That's exactly right, Your Honor.\nThe really important thing here is that the Utah\nSupreme Court --\nQUESTION: Excuse me. I don't understand where\nwe are on the out of State. You say you're going to get\nto that under another --\nMS. BIRNBAUM: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- prong?\nMS. BIRNBAUM: Under ratio and comparable\npenalties, Your Honor. Because this Court has said that\nyou could introduce extraterritorial conduct, similar,\npast conduct with regard to reprehensibility, but there\nare three guideposts in Gore, and the Utah Supreme Court\nignored the other two guideposts. Of course, when it came\nto the ratio guidepost, this Court has repeatedly said\nthere has to be a reasonable relationship, reasonable\nratio between the penalty, the punishment, and the harm to\nthe plaintiff: not the harm to others, not the harm to the\ncommunity at large, not the harm to all of the consumers\nthat dealt with State Farm, as the Utah Supreme Court held\nand found, and --\nQUESTION: So how do we measure that? How do we\nmeasure the ratio, the reasonable relationship of the\npenalty?\nMS. BIRNBAUM: Here, Your Honor, there was a\ncompensatory damage award of a million dollars. That was\na substantial compensatory award. The ratio that would be\nreasonable with regard to a million dollars could not be\n145 to 1.\nQUESTION: Except that, you know, we say that\nyou can't take into account harm to others, but you can\ntake into account harm to others so long as that is done\nunder the rubric of reprehensibility.\nMS. BIRNBAUM: As long --\nQUESTION: If you've done the same thing to\nother people, you can be punished more. Now, you may find\na significant difference between punishing you for what\nyou did to the other people, and punishing you more for\nwhat you did to this person, because it is rendered more\nreprehensible because of what you did to other people, but\nI don't see a whole lot of difference between the two.\nMS. BIRNBAUM:\nwhat reprehensibility does is put you on the continuum of\nblameworthiness, and this Court has said previously that 4\nto 1 is close to the line. In TXO it permitted 10 to 1\nbecause economic damages was small, and you looked at\npotential harm as well as the realized harm to the\nlitigant there.\nHere, he had substantial compensatory damages.\nIn addition, if you look at the third guidepost in Gore,\nyou have comparable penalties and sanctions for comparable\nconduct. That's how that is defined.\nWhat was the conduct here? It was a failure to\nsettle within policy limits. It wasn't intentional tort;\nit was --\nQUESTION: May I just suggest an analogy? This,\nin a way this reminds me of the argument we heard last\nweek -- maybe it was last session -- about the three\nstrikes law in California; that you're not necessarily\npunished for the other things you did, but you can take\ninto account your prior crimes even in other States in\norder to justify a more severe penalty for what you've\ndone here. And isn't it -- part of the argument the other\nside makes is that this is a very large company, and the\nboard of directors doesn't hear about a $100-million\npunitive damage award down in Texas, and therefore you've\ngot to at least give them enough money so the board of\ndirectors will know they ought to take corrective steps.\nMS. BIRNBAUM: Could I just first answer this\n$100 million punitive damage award, because I think that\nreally shows where the Utah Supreme Court is going. There\nwas no judgment. This had nothing to do with bad faith\nfailure to settle. It had to do with an uninsured\nmotorist coverage. The case was settled for pennies on\nthe dollar. There was no --\nQUESTION: 99 cents?\n(Laughter.)\nMS. BIRNBAUM: Pennies. Pennies. Unfortunately\nI couldn't put into evidence the amount because there as a\nconfidentiality agreement, but that case had nothing to do\nwith the kind of conduct here. You cannot --\nQUESTION: No, but I suppose to the extent it's\nrelevant it is, that you need an awfully big award against\nan awfully big company, because you want the company\nitself to take corrective steps, and if this $100 million\naward isn't even called to the attention of the board of\ndirectors, maybe that says you needed a larger award than\nwould otherwise be justified.\nMS. BIRNBAUM: Your Honor, I think if you look\nat this, this was a jury award that was never made into a\njudgment. Why would anybody -- it was settled. It was a\nrunaway verdict in a place.\nboard of directors with something like that?\nQUESTION: Okay, let's assume the $100 million\nhad never happened.\nMS. BIRNBAUM: Okay.\nQUESTION: The argument as made is, this is a\ncompany with a surplus in, literally measured in the\nbillions. You've got to have a really big judgment to get\ntheir attention. What's your response?\nMS. BIRNBAUM: The answer to that is, first of\nall, surplus was the wrong number to ever focus on. That\nmoney is accounted for, and there are some very good\nbriefs, amicus briefs that talk about surplus.\nThere was never a profit from underwriting in\nthis particular instance, and the fact that the company\nhas surpluses, that's to pay out claims.\nQUESTION: That's just saying how rich they are.\nI mean, the question -- whether they're rich or not, they\nseem quite rich, but maybe they're not, but the harm here\nwas what? That is he had a $50,000 policy.\nMS. BIRNBAUM: Yes.\nQUESTION: And he for a period of time the\nclient thought that he'd have to pay $136,000 out of his\nown pocket, for how long a period of time?\nMS. BIRNBAUM: There is a question in the\nrecord.\nperiod of time. The Utah Supreme Court said it was for 18\nmonths.\nQUESTION: All right, so for 18 months he's\nfrightened that he'll have to pay $136,000 out of his own\npocket, all right. Now, because of that fright, he was\ngiven a million dollars in compensation and another $145\nmillion -- I don't know, how much went to him? How much\nwent to the lawyers?\nMS. BIRNBAUM: Well, Your Honor, there would be\n40 percent that would go to the lawyers --\nQUESTION: So --\nMS. BIRNBAUM: -- and under the agreement the --\nQUESTION: $56 million goes to the lawyers.\nMS. BIRNBAUM: Right.\nQUESTION: And how much went to him? How much\nwent to him?\nMS. BIRNBAUM: 10 percent of the award was --\nQUESTION: All right, so $14 million went to\nhim, and where did the rest go?\nMS. BIRNBAUM: It went to the two other\nplaintiffs in the original case.\nQUESTION: Okay. Now, that's all necessary for\nthe follow -- or at least not necessary, reasonable for\nthe following reason. This is a very big company, and\nunless you really make them pay they might do this again,\nor if not this, something equally bad, okay?\nNow, what's your response?\nMS. BIRNBAUM: The response to that, Your Honor,\nis there's nothing in this record -- first of all, that\nkind of ratio is totally unreasonable and out of\nproportion to the harm to the plaintiff.\nQUESTION: That's not my question. My question\nis, there is a claim. Even if it's out of proportion to\nthe harm, we've got to wake these people up at State Farm.\nNow, they get wakened up by this 145 million judgment,\nbelieve me, and --\nMS. BIRNBAUM: Yes. There's no question of\nthat.\nQUESTION: All right. Now -- all right. Now,\nwhat's your response to that, that's a very desirable and\nnecessary thing, or they might do it again?\nMS. BIRNBAUM: It's not a necessary thing on\nthis record, it is not a desirable thing. There was no --\nQUESTION: Because?\nMS. BIRNBAUM: There was no evidence in this\nrecord that there was any other case in which there had\nbeen a failure to settle within policy limits that\njeopardized an insuree --\nQUESTION: All right, suppose there had been 10\ncases in which 10 other people were frightened of having\nto pay $136,000 for a period of 18 months. Then, in your\nopinion, would it have been justified to enter this\njudgment of $145 million to wake them up? Indeed, at 4\nmonth intervals they kept doing this over and over.\nMS. BIRNBAUM: Your Honor, if that happened,\nthen each one of those plaintiffs could have a bad faith\nfailure to settle claim in which they could have gotten\npunitive damages in their own States. There is no -- this\nwhole concept that this is a clandestine scheme, every --\nQUESTION: Maybe no amount of money will\nsuffice. Maybe we have to send them to jail.\nMS. BIRNBAUM: Well, that's what --\n(Laughter.)\nMS. BIRNBAUM: That's what the Supreme Court of\nUtah said, even though it's not in their statute. Can you\nimagine, on fair notice, when we talked about fair notice,\nthat you could go to jail for a failure to settle one case\nin the State of Utah?\nQUESTION: Did this jury --\nQUESTION: It didn't have authority to send them\nto jail though, did it?\nMS. BIRNBAUM: No, they didn't.\nQUESTION: You know, but you're making -- I\nthink you're making two arguments. First, you're making\nthe argument that you started with, and that is, evidence\nwas improperly admitted, acts in other States were\nimproperly considered, acts unlike failure to settle were\nimproperly considered.\nLet's assume, for the sake of argument, that you\nlose -- I mean, if you win on that, I presume we're not\ngoing to get to the point you're arguing now. Let's\nassume you lose on that. You get to the point that you're\narguing now and you say, okay, 4 times the amount of\nactual damage would be okay, 145 is not. What do we put\nin an opinion to indicate what is the proper point in\nbetween 4 and 145?\nMS. BIRNBAUM: I think you've already put that\nin your opinions in this Court already, and that is that\nthere has to be a relationship between the amount of the\npunitive damages and the compensatory harm to the\nplaintiff.\nQUESTION: Yes, I know that, and the question\nis, is 4 times the relationship appropriate, and 145 is\nnot? And how about 80, and 60, and 20? How do we grapple\nwith that?\nMS. BIRNBAUM: Well, I think you grapple with\nthat only by looking at the three guideposts that you've\nalready put forth, and it could be 4, it could be 5, and\nsome courts have even held 10, but most of the courts that\nhave followed your jurisprudence have held that 3, or 4,\nor 5 is close to the line.\nQUESTION: Is the point of your argument\nultimately -- you're not saying this, but I mean, if we\naccept the way you're going, are we really going down the\nroad to saying, look, at some point we've got to leave\nthis in a less protean state, and we've got to pick a\nnumber, and is that our business to do?\nMS. BIRNBAUM: Now, we're not asking you to put\na bright line. It would be helpful, but I don't think\nthis Court is prepared to do that.\nQUESTION: Well, would the bright line be\nhelpful if we said, up to -- pick a number -- 10 times\nwill be usually accepted unless that is not adequate\nenough to compensate the plaintiff for the wrong that was\ndone to him?\nMS. BIRNBAUM: That would be an excellent way of\ndrawing the line, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: You get this out of what provision of\nour Bill of Rights?\nMS. BIRNBAUM: Your Honor, we get it out of due\nprocess, the two bedrock provisions called due process and\nfederalism. Federalism, comity, States' rights.\nQUESTION: But as far as --\nQUESTION: It's not specific, is it? 10 times\nis what it says.\nMS. BIRNBAUM: No, we're not suggesting that. I\nthought it was a good idea, however.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Ms. Birnbaum, I'd like you to clarify\nyour position on what has been called\nextraterritoriality --\nMS. BIRNBAUM: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: -- because I thought today that you\nwere very forthright with the Court. You said no, you're\nnot going to make a distinction whether the plaintiff\ncomes from California or New York rather than Utah.\nMS. BIRNBAUM: Right.\nQUESTION: So you can't just draw a line around\nthe State of Utah and say, that's the relevant State. But\nyou tell us a supplemental brief was calling attention to\na case where there was a specific request to make that\nkind of charge. You made no such, State Farm made no such\nrequest in this case, as far as I can tell.\nMS. BIRNBAUM: Yes, they did, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Yes? Where?\nMS. BIRNBAUM: Well, it might not have been\ntotally the same that --\nQUESTION: Which one?\nMS. BIRNBAUM: It's in the lodging at 394. It\nwas instruction number 46.\nQUESTION: Yes, and instruction number 46, which\nI looked for, was the closest thing.\nMS. BIRNBAUM: That's right --\nQUESTION: That talks about both compensatory\nand punitive damages, that you should base it on State\nFarm's conduct in handling of the case against Curtis\nCampbell.\nMS. BIRNBAUM: Right.\nQUESTION: Only.\nMS. BIRNBAUM: Right.\nQUESTION: Now, that's not even saying other\npeople within Utah. So that's -- and it's alike for\ncompensatory and punitive. That is nothing like the\ncharge that said, look in the State of Nevada. But I just\nwanted to make sure that you are saying, you don't look\nonly to Utah, because this particular plaintiff happened\nto come to Utah. It would be the same thing if the\nplaintiff came from California.\nMS. BIRNBAUM: Absolutely, Your Honor.\nLet me just mention one other part of the\nguideposts which I think are very relevant here, and that\nis comparable penalties for comparable misconduct, and\nhere it is uncontroverted that the penalty that the Utah\ncourts or the Utah system could have placed on State Farm\nfor an act, for a single act of bad faith failure to\nsettle, which was at stake here, was $10,000.\nYet when the Utah Supreme Court examined that\nguidepost from the Court, it looked at the scheme. It\nlooked at all of the nationwide conduct to determine that\n1) you could be -- you would have to disgorge all your\nprofits or you could be imprisoned, which was not correct\nanyhow under the Utah statute.\nBut if you restate the guideposts that you have\nalready come down with, and you make it clear that we're\ntalking about conduct that was permitted to the\nplaintiffs, that we're talking about reasonable ratios\nthat had to do with the plaintiff's wrong, not harm to\nothers, not harm to all of those in Utah -- in fact, if\nyou look at the bad faith failure to settle issue, there\nwas no one in the State of Utah that was harmed by that\nkind of conduct. There was nobody that was even subject,\nJustice Breyer, for a short time with execution, and\nthat -- and there was no reason, there was no reason to\ndeter that kind of conduct because there was no conduct in\nthe future, after the Campbell case, that that even came\nclose to.\nSo I think that if you focus on those factors,\nthose guideposts that you elucidated to in Gore, and make\nthem stronger, that would be sufficient for the lower\ncourts to do their job in doing a meaningful -- meaningful\nappellate review, not the kind of review here that was\nbased on questionable conclusions and improper predicates.\nThank you.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Ms. Birnbaum.\nMr. Tribe, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE H. TRIBE\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. TRIBE: Justice Stevens, and may it please\nthe Court:\nI think I might begin by saying that I barely\nrecognize the case that, though I didn't try, I read the\ntranscript in, from hearing Ms. Birnbaum's description.\nShe says that the conduct involved in this case was simply\nthe failure to settle. It wasn't, she says, even an\nintentional tort. Well, the Court's --\nQUESTION: Well, that was the sole ground of\nliability, was it not?\nMR. TRIBE: The sole ground of original\nliability was objectively unreasonable failure to settle,\nbut phase 2, which was held at the insistence of\nplaintiffs, who wanted -- of the defendants who wanted to\nbifurcate, phase 2 focused on the question of whether\nthere was an intentional tort, and there was found to be\nfraud; and the court, the trial court affirmed the\njudgment partly on the ground of intentional fraud; and\nthe fraud, and it's not a surprise really to the lawyers\nfor the defendants, because they made it clear in their\nopening statement that they understood the whole theory of\nthis case to be that the insurance policies that were\nbeing sold by State Farm, which led people to think that\nin first and in third party cases the claims adjuster\nwould try to do a reasonably objective job of satisfying\nthe claim if possible, in fact weren't bad at all.\nThere was a clandestine cap that was imposed by\nthis innocuous-looking bureaucratic PP&R program that was\nthoroughly documented and that was imposed from\nheadquarters, documented elaborately by hundreds of\nexamples; and it's true, some of them came from other\nStates, and I will get to that; but they were all just\nillustrative, because it came from headquarters in\nBloomington, and it was a directive --\nQUESTION: I take it the policy is, pay as\nlittle as possible, even if fraud is necessary?\nMR. TRIBE: And, in fact, it was necessary here.\nThat is, they made up things. They doctored the file.\nQUESTION: All right, I see that, but what's --\nMR. TRIBE: They made up the fact that -- they\ndefamed this dead person and said that he was speeding to\nmeet a pregnant girlfriend, who didn't exist. There were\nfindings that they systematically shredded, and destroyed,\nand fabricated documents for two decades in order to cover\nup the fact that they were not selling what they were\npretending to sell.\nAnd it was found in this case clearly, and then\nagain de novo by the Utah Supreme Court, that this policy,\nwhich was clandestine and then covered up, was a policy\nthat had persisted for two decades, which they even now\nseem unwilling to acknowledge.\nQUESTION: Can I interrupt with a question?\nMR. TRIBE: Sure.\nQUESTION: I'm sure you're going to get to it,\nbut one can infer -- maybe it's not entirely clear -- that\nall of this was established, and there are very, very\nmany, many bad, bad deeds done in all parts of the United\nStates, but that the $145 million is in large part\npunishment for what was done outside of Utah.\nMR. TRIBE: Oh, I don't think so, Justice\nStevens. I do plan to get to that.\nQUESTION: The second point that relates to that\nis that when the Supreme Court of Utah made the comparison\nto what the criminal penalty might have been, they had to\nbe referring to more than what could have been imposed in\nUtah.\nMR. TRIBE: No, Justice Stevens, what they said\nwas this.\nUnfair Claims Practices Act, which said $10,000 fine per\nviolation; and there were in their view thousands of\nindividual instances of wrongfully denied benefits.\nQUESTION: In Utah?\nMR. TRIBE: In Utah, yes, because they didn't\ndraw this fancy distinction between first and third party\nclaims that is being drawn for the convenience of State\nFarm. The wrong is not --\nQUESTION: That's the basis of the underlying\ntort, which was the failure -- which was the excess.\nMR. TRIBE: That was the example --\nQUESTION: Which was the excess.\nMR. TRIBE: -- Justice Kennedy. That was the\ntip of the iceberg.\nJustice Kennedy, this is very important. In\nthis particular case, it was the failure to settle a case,\nand it was a fraudulent failure to settle a case, not just\na random accident, but it was pursuant to exactly the same\npolicy, capping the average amount that a given claims\nagents puts out in terms of State Farm money, that is used\nin these other instances. It was exactly the same policy.\nIn this case, it was because this fellow named\nBill Brown wanted to move to Colorado, and because he did,\nand because he was close to his quota, and this is all in\nthe record, and it is found -- and it's not disputed any\nlonger. Because he wanted to move to Colorado, he puts\npressure on somebody underneath him to make sure that that\nyear's numbers look better.\nQUESTION: Of course, companies would have a\npolicy of trying to make as much money as possible.\nMR. TRIBE: It's not just making as much\nmoney --\nQUESTION: Well, some companies could add --\nMR. TRIBE: -- it's stealing.\nQUESTION: -- could add to that, by the way, one\nway we make money is, we pay out as little as possible and\nwe charge as much as possible. I remember an airline that\nhad the policy, charge the customer the highest price he\nwill pay for the service that he wants, all right?\nMR. TRIBE: But Justice Breyer --\nQUESTION: There could be such a policy.\nMR. TRIBE: Right --\nQUESTION: Now --\nMR. TRIBE: -- and if the policy is sell him a\nticket and then turn him away at the door --\nQUESTION: Oh, no, no, but by the way --\nMR. TRIBE: -- pretending to sell him a place --\nQUESTION: -- it might be that such a policy\nwould even condone doing a lot of bad things to do that,\nand what's worrying me about permitting that kind of\npolicy to serve as a justification for a $145-million\njudgment is precisely what I wrote in my concurrence in\nthe BMW case, that the Constitution, indeed the Magna\nCarta says that you should not take life, liberty, or\nproperty without law; and to take 12 people, call them a\njury, selected at random, and tell them that they are free\nto go through the business practices of a company --\nMR. TRIBE: Justice Breyer --\nQUESTION: -- to unite them under the name of a\npolicy and then assess $145 million for every bad thing\nthat this jury thinks --\nMR. TRIBE: Justice Breyer, please -- I believe\nin the Magna Carta as much as you do. It was not\narbitrary. There were criteria. The criteria were\npursuant to an instruction proposed by State Farm, and in\nthis case it was not every bad thing. All of the\nspecifics, including these seemingly trivial things like\nappearance allowances, were all introduced in particular\ncases to show how they were being used by someone who was\nup against his monthly quota, and because he was up\nagainst the monthly quota -- you read the testimony of\nGary Fye at page 1375 and 1387 of the joint appendix.\nBecause they were up against the monthly quota, the people\nat the receiving end who thought they had a claims agent\nwho was, as they call him, a good neighbor, in fact had\nsomeone who was selling them a place in the airline, and\nit wasn't there, deliberately.\nQUESTION: Nothing you have said, Mr. Tribe,\nProfessor, persuades me that the jury didn't punish this\ncompany for being a bad company quite without reference --\nMR. TRIBE: Because of the --\nQUESTION: -- to the harm this plaintiff\nsuffered.\nMR. TRIBE: Well, first of all, as to the harm\nsuffered, proposed instruction 40 by State Farm would have\ntold the jury, I think consistent with this Court's\njurisprudence and with the history of punitive damages,\nthat they could consider the effect of State Farm's\nbehavior, quote, \"on the lives of plaintiffs and of other\npolicyholders,\" and it's because, Justice Breyer, of what\nyou said in BMW that a lot of other people who are harmed\nby these practices are not likely to be able to sue. That\nis, they're not going to make it.\nMr. Fye testified at 30 and 44, for everyone\nlike Campbell, who will take on a company this size and\nwith the resources of State Farm, there are hundreds, if\nnot thousands, who will simply go away, because State\nFarm --\nQUESTION: Mr. Tribe, maybe fewer, maybe fewer\nnow after a verdict of that size, and isn't that one of\nthe problems?\nMR. TRIBE: Well, that's the hope. That --\nQUESTION: Isn't that -- now there's an\nincentive for lawyers to pursue such claims. Before they\nmight have thought them too small to be worthwhile.\nMR. TRIBE: One of the advantages -- there may\nbe down sides, but if we prevail, Justice Ginsburg, we're\nprevailing on a theory that the practice we've identified,\nwhich is quite specific, for 20 years of putting these\ninvisible caps that cheat the insured in all kinds of\ncases throughout the State of Utah, there will no longer\nbe anyone who can recover for those harms, beyond\ncompensatory damages, because the penalty will have been\nextracted.\nQUESTION: The question that's bothering me --\nQUESTION: Is that true in New York or Vermont?\nI mean, you said in Utah there would be no one who can get\nanother $145 million --\nMR. TRIBE: I think if they've done this in\nevery State, then they should be exposed to the\npossibility of punitive damages in other States.\nQUESTION: So you could multiple that by 50.\nMR. TRIBE: Well, you know, it seems to me, if\nyou look at the opinion that was delivered from the bench\nby the district court after 2 months, in his own words --\nthey accuse us of writing his opinion.\nIn his own words, what he said was that absent a\npunitive award, the problem of recurrence of their\nmisconduct is extremely high, the probability of\nrecurrence; because he saw the evidence that they never\nstopped; and he said that even the $25-million award that\nhe felt constrained by State law, mistakenly, to give, he\nthought would not suffice because -- and I'm now reading\nfrom his December 19 opinion -- because the $25 million\nmay not be enough to offset the profit that they're likely\nto have earned.\nThat is, every time they cheat the insured by --\nQUESTION: Mr. Tribe, you've told me that this\nis all based on what happened in Utah. I haven't read\nthis massive record, and you tell me you have. In the\nsecond phase of the punitive damages trial, not the first\none --\nMR. TRIBE: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- when they did get into out of\nState evidence, what proportion, in your judgment, of that\nevidence related to Utah, and what proportion related to\nother States?\nMR. TRIBE: I think the overwhelming majority\nrelated to Utah, and every time it came in dealing with\nanother State, contrary to what we heard, it was because\nthe door had been opened, and it was specifically found by\nthe trial court that they waived any objection to the\ntestimony in question, despite what we heard about --\nQUESTION: But you're telling me that over half\nof the evidence related to Utah itself?\nMR. TRIBE: Yes, but let me tell you, Justice\nStevens, it was so uniform that the particular examples\nwere picked because they so nicely illustrated the way a\nparticular device like the use of non-OPM parts would\ninteract with the cap that was imposed. It was nothing\nabout --\nQUESTION: Are they correct in telling us that\nthis -- there's only one example of a failure to settle --\nMR. TRIBE: We have no way of knowing, Justice\nStevens, because they have erected -- the record also\nshows that since the 1970s, part of their policy of\ndestroying records has included --\nQUESTION: Yes, but there must have been a lot\nof records --\nMR. TRIBE: -- getting rid of all those records.\nQUESTION: But they didn't destroy all the\nevidence to have a trial go on this long.\nMR. TRIBE: Well, it's because -- part of what\nwas said by the trial court was that it took the\npersistence of a David to bring this particular Goliath to\nhis knees. Much of the evidence certainly wasn't produced\nthrough discovery. The key evidence, including the May\n1979 PP&R report, was obtained indirectly through other\ncases, not with any cooperation on the part of State Farm.\nState Farm kept saying, we don't have a PP&R policy. Oh,\nand then we got rid of it in 1992; and we got rid of it\nagain in 1994; and yes, there's a PP&R policy, but it\ndoesn't actually set the cap on any particular claim.\nWell, that's a nicely and artfully put point.\nIt doesn't. What it does is, it imposes a ceiling which\naverages things out and forces whoever is unlucky enough\nto come in when somebody is about to hit his ceiling to\nget cheated. It seems to me that we -- it's true that it\nall began by looking at this, as it happened, failure to\nsettle. That's a happenstance. It could have begun in\nsome other way.\nBecause it happened to a couple that was rather\nvulnerable, and yet tenacious: this fellow had had one\nwife who had been murdered in his home, another wife who\nhad died of cancer. He himself had Parkinson's disease.\nThey were part of the weakest of the herd, as\nState Farm's policies put it, that they're picked on,\nbecause they're less likely to fight back. But it happened\nthat these people did fight back, and it seems to me it's\nnot a matter of rewarding them.\nsmall piece of this. The family of the dead young man\ngets part of it. The State may get part of it. The key\npoint is that it is a critical disincentive, and Justice\nKennedy, any notion --\nQUESTION: Well, some people get part of it that\nweren't hurt at all.\nMR. TRIBE: Some lawyers will certainly get part\nof it. I don't --\nQUESTION: I wasn't referring to the lawyers.\nMR. TRIBE: I --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. TRIBE: What made me think you might have\nbeen? No, but it seems --\nQUESTION: Well, I was referring to the other\npeople that took an assignment of the claim together with\n--\nMR. TRIBE: That could be, but --\nQUESTION: I was referring to them, and my\nproblem is that in fact what you have is a system where if\nyou take, let's call it the most evil corporation in the\nworld, and I'm sure there are some such, and they commit a\nvery minor tort in respect to someone, pursuant to their\npolicy of being evil --\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION:\ncriminal laws, there are regulatory authorities, there are\nstatutes --\nMR. TRIBE: Right.\nQUESTION: -- there is common law, there are\nmany, many sources of law; and it's disturbing in terms of\nthe picture of the law to have 12 people picked at random\nto assess an enormous fine without standards other than,\n\"this defendant is evil,\" and I'm assuming he is evil.\nMR. TRIBE: Justice Breyer, first, it's not fair\nto say that was the only standard.\nQUESTION: Oh, no, I'm trying --\nMR. TRIBE: Second -- second --\nQUESTION: -- to get you to say what the\nstandard was, if it is not that.\nMR. TRIBE: I thought this Court did a rather\ngood job in BMW. Reprehensibility could hardly be higher\nwhen one has a repeat offender who even now\nmischaracterizes its intentional tort, when one has a\nrepeat offender that obstructs justice --\nQUESTION: But again, you're defining\nreprehensibility quite without regard to the specific\ninjury imposed on the plaintiff.\nMR. TRIBE: Well --\nQUESTION: You're defining -- you're giving a\nreport card to the entire company.\nMR. TRIBE: No, but Justice Kennedy, in TXO this\nCourt talked about the ratio not just of the harm that\nactually befell the particular plaintiff, but of the\npunitive damages to the harm that might have befallen that\nplaintiff if the tortious plan had been carried to\ncompletion.\nHere, if it had been carried to completion the\nhome would have been taken, because a deal would not have\nbeen struck in December of '84 -- of '84, and also in TXO,\nand in other cases, you've spoken of the harm to the\nlarger community. You've also spoken of the importance of\nextracting the profit from tortious behavior.\nQUESTION: I think -- Justice Breyer touched on\nthis. Part of the harm to the larger community here is\nthe image that this does to the judicial system when\ncorporations, businesses, people of substance want to use\nthe courts and they're deterred from doing it by the\nthreat of runaway punitive damages, and that is not good\nfor the legal system.\nMR. TRIBE: Justice Kennedy, I certainly agree\nin principle; but to pick a case in which a corporation\nhas defied the legal system, has shredded documents, has\ncovered up its deliberate wrongdoing, has not even\nbothered to pay attention to a $100 million award -- yes,\nof course it wasn't reduced to a judgment, but the\nevidence in this case is that that's not relevant. What\nwas critical is that they had built a wall of deniability\nso that no one in a decisionmaking capacity is informed of\npunitive judgments.\nMr. Muskowski testified in this case that he\nwould not let anyone know, in a position of authority,\neven of the punitive judgment in this case; and in their\nreply brief they say, well, Mr. Mendoza had decisionmaking\nauthority, but if you look at the relevant pages in the\njoint appendix, you'll see that that's not true. In the\ncolloquy it's clear that he did not.\nWhat that means is that a company can surround\nitself with an impregnable wall and in effect spit at the\nlegal system. How good is that for its image?\nNow, it may be that an ideal legal system might\nnot use juries for this purpose, but is it the mission of\nthis Court to redesign the legal systems of the 50 States?\n15 States have signed an amicus brief here saying it's\nimportant to them to be able to use punitive damages when\nthe regulatory and criminal justice systems haven't quite\ncaught up with whatever latest axis of evil is afoot in\nthe corporate world.\nIs it really helpful to any of us to have a\ncorporation be able to defraud all of the people who rely\non it, who depend on it, and get away with paying simply\nwhat harm they happened to cause in the one case when they\nget caught?\nIt seems to me especially bizarre, especially\nbizarre for State Farm to speak here proudly of the fact\nthat this is the worst case in history.\nQUESTION: Can I ask one other question just\nabout the proceedings here?\nMR. TRIBE: Yes.\nQUESTION: The record is so large I didn't have\nthe whole thing completely in mind. After the trial judge\nreduced the jury's award of $145 million to -- what was\nit, $20 million?\nMR. TRIBE: 25.\nQUESTION: -- $25 million, State Farm still\nappealed.\nMR. TRIBE: There was a cross-appeal by State\nFarm.\nQUESTION: Well, did both sides appeal that?\nMR. TRIBE: Yes.\nQUESTION: I see. It wasn't clear to me.\nMR. TRIBE: That's right. State Farm appealed\nbecause it thought there should be no punitives. It seems\neven now they think it did nothing wrong.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. TRIBE:\nCampbells on the grounds that they thought it was a\nmistake of State law to have reduced the punitives.\nQUESTION: I was thinking it would have been\nquite a shock if State Farm had been the only appellant\nhere and that was the result of that appeal.\nMR. TRIBE: Yes.\nQUESTION: It's sort of dramatic, yes.\nMR. TRIBE: Yes, well --\nQUESTION: Both sides appealed.\nMR. TRIBE: Yes, that's correct.\nQUESTION: And isn't there a certain irony in\nthat it was chopped down to $25 million, and then the Utah\nSupreme Court, using this Court's case law, saying we\ndon't give the ordinary deference that we would give to\nthat judgment of the trial court, because the Supreme\nCourt had told us we must engage in de novo review, and\nengaging in de novo review, we don't chop it down, we put\nit back to where it was originally.\nMR. TRIBE: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think in a\nsense that looks ironic. It looks as though Cooper v.\nLeatherman came back in a boomerang, but I think really\nthe way I read the opinion of the Utah Supreme Court, they\napplied Cooper in an even more vigorous way in general.\nThat is, they didn't just engage in de novo review of the\nquestion of excessiveness.\nof all the facts, so you have not just a jury, but a jury\nand a trial court and a full appellate court.\nThe only fact on which they said they weren't\ngoing to defer was a technical issue about the wealth of\nState Farm, and the real reason they actually gave for\nincreasing the 25 to 145 was their conviction that the\ntrial court believed that 25 would not stop State Farm\nfrom persisting in its practices, and that it was only\ntheir own earlier suggestion that the ratio should matter\na great deal that had misled the trial court.\nQUESTION: What do you think the ratio should --\nI mean, we did say something in BMW about ratio between\ncompensatory damages and punitives. What do you think the\nratio should be? No limit, 10 to, 145 -- whatever it\ntakes to stop them? I mean, what if nothing will stop\nthem but sending them to jail?\nMR. TRIBE: Well, in this case, sending them to\njail was an option that the Supreme Court of Utah\nmentioned, and that State Farm doesn't seem to take very\nseriously. They think the State Supreme Court of Utah\ndoesn't understand its own law. There are provisions of\nUtah law that make deliberate fraud of the sort they\ncommitted an imprisonable offense, and maybe that's an\noption, but that suggests --\nQUESTION:\ncase put people in prison for --\nMR. TRIBE: Well, I haven't -- I have no contact\nwith the Attorney General of Utah, but they --\nQUESTION: No, no, I mean, you'd have to bring\nanother trial, wouldn't you?\nMR. TRIBE: Well, of course you -- yes. Yes,\nbut the comparability standard asks, how serious an\noffense is this, and I submit it's extremely serious.\nBut to your question, Justice Scalia, on ratio,\nI think that instead of trying to come up with a number --\nbecause I think suggesting any number would be so\narbitrary that it would do more damage to this Court than\ngood to the legal system. It's not like 6 months for the\nidea of a serious crime. I mean, it would just be a\nnumber plucked from the air, and it would backfire,\nbecause as the law and economics people are fond of\npointing out, any number you pick will then lead people to\nsort of modify their behavior accordingly, and just\ninternalize the costs on a kind of bad man theory, and\nwhat you really are trying to do is stop the behavior.\nWe're not talking about negligence here. We're\ntalking about something of which the optimal level is\nzero. The optimal level of deliberate fraud and deception\ncovered up in this way is zero.\nThe relevance of the ratio, I think, is simply\nas one thing to look at. If the ratio looks very high,\nyou ask why is it so high? In this case, the answer comes\nback, it's so high because the ratio of the number of\npeople they hurt to the number who are going to be\nmotivated to sue and able to sue is very low. I mean, is\nvery -- you know, a number -- a huge number will be hurt.\nA very small number are going to be able to make it\nthrough that filter.\nQUESTION: Well, with verdicts like this, we\nmight see an increase, don't you think?\nMR. TRIBE: Well, I suppose. I suppose, but\nthere are ways of getting rid of frivolous lawsuits.\nThe point also is, it's hard -- if you see an\nincrease, Justice O'Connor, and if it is an increase that\ngets anywhere, it might be because they stopped destroying\nthe evidence, because they stopped fabricating -- they've\nso doctored the files, like the file in this case, to make\nit look in any given case as though the report that they\ngive corresponds to the history of the case, and it's\nawfully hard to sue successfully when the file has been\nmassaged and doctored.\nThe result in a case like this is of course it\nlooks like a very large award, but --\nQUESTION: What if there were in Utah a second\nCampbell, a second excess carrier, and the case was tried\n6 months later. Would they get the same punitive damages?\nMR. TRIBE: No. If it was for any activity that\noccurred during the period from May 1979 to the time of\nthis trial --\nQUESTION: Both hypothetical plaintiffs are\ninjured around the time Campbell is, and they both bring\nthe same kind of suit and they have the same evidence;\nthey each get the 145?\nMR. TRIBE: No. I think that it's a penalty\nthat is like -- there ought to be some double jeopardy\nlike doctrine that if they can show that they've already\nbeen punished for this course of conduct, they ought not\nto have to pay the penalty a second time.\nNow, the Double Jeopardy Clause --\nQUESTION: Mr. Tribe, I thought you answered --\nQUESTION: What's the authority for that\nproposition?\nMR. TRIBE: I would -- I just made it up.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Professor Tribe.\nMR. TRIBE: I just made it up. I said there\nought to be such a doctrine.\nQUESTION: Mr. Tribe, you're talking about a\nsecond Utah plaintiff. I thought you answered --\nMR. TRIBE: Yes, a second --\nQUESTION: Several questions ago you said this\ncould be multiplied at least 50 times. That is, one big\nwinner in each State.\nMR. TRIBE: Well, if they commit 50 big\noffenses, it's part of our jurisprudence of 50 States that\nthey might be subject to 50 penalties. That --\nQUESTION: Your argument is that this is all\nUtah damages, so there are --\nMR. TRIBE: That's right. That's --\nQUESTION: -- 49 other claims out there that\nmust be at least as valuable.\nMR. TRIBE: Well, that's right.\nQUESTION: Yes.\nQUESTION: And even in Utah, I thought our case\nsays you're punishing them for the harm done to this\nplaintiff.\nMR. TRIBE: Ultimately, you are.\nQUESTION: If you can take reprehensibility into\naccount, but it's for the harm done to -- well, what about\nthe harm done to all the other plaintiffs in Utah?\nMR. TRIBE: Justice Scalia, there's no pretense\nthat this is compensatory damages. The compensatory\ndamage compensates them for the harm done to them.\nQUESTION: Then you shouldn't have said that.\nMR. TRIBE:\nwas done to them is affected by, as this Court has said,\nwhether it was an isolated event, as they claimed, or\nwhether it was done as part of a schematic, systematic\nform of predation.\nNow, it was of that sort. That was shown. The\nfact that it was predation that was launched from\nBloomington and therefore spread throughout the country is\nState Farm's problem. It shouldn't be the problem of the\nplaintiff who collects punitive damages in a given case.\nQUESTION: Mr. Tribe, I can't remember -- I\nassume it's in the briefs, I just don't remember, what was\nthe instruction to the jury on any limits on their\nconsideration of the out-of-State evidence? Was the jury\ntold, look, you can only punish them for what they did\nhere, this only goes to intent, or something like that?\nMR. TRIBE: There was no request here, as there\nwas, for example, in the recent Ninth Circuit case against\nFord, no request whatsoever by State Farm for such an\ninstruction.\nWhat they did request, and were not entitled to,\nwas that under BMW they preserved an objection that the\nout-of-State evidence be completely disregarded, even\nthough it came in in response to the doors that they had\nopened, but they did not --\nQUESTION:\na request for an instruction --\nMR. TRIBE: Not at all.\nQUESTION: -- or in instruction addressing\nspecifically that point?\nMR. TRIBE: No, and they were fully aware -- I\nmean, the day after BMW came down, there was a bench\nconference. There was an extended colloquy. It was\nfully --\nQUESTION: But wasn't that after the trial? I\nthought that was in the petition for reconsideration?\nMR. TRIBE: No. The -- May 21, 1996 was before\nthe full-blown 2-month period of the phase 2 trial.\nQUESTION: I see.\nMR. TRIBE: And it was known very clearly the\nday after BMW that a good bit of the evidence in this\ncase, because many of the examples of how this policy\nworked, would come from other places, would not be Utah-\nbased. The $100-million verdict which would illustrate\nthe wall they built would come from Texas.\nThey never once asked for an instruction\nlimiting matters to Utah, and I don't fault them for it.\nIt would have been rather bizarre to do so, because they\nknew full well that we were not asking the Utah jury or\nthe Utah courts to punish them for what they did\nelsewhere.\nWe were simply using what was done elsewhere\nfirst to rebut their commissioners -- they brought in\ncommissioners from various States to testify that State\nFarm never did anything wrong. The trial court said, now\nyou know, if you do that, you're going to open the door --\nJustice Stevens, I wanted to just -- if you do that,\nyou're going to open the door to proof of what happened\nelsewhere. They didn't mind, and they insisted that the\nsequence of proof be rebuttal first, actually, through\ndepositions, and then the principal arguments, which made\nit look as though it was part of the direct case. I think\nthat --\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Tribe.\nMR. TRIBE: -- this judgment should be affirmed.\nThank you.\nMS. BIRNBAUM: Do I have a little time, can I\njust -- left to respond?\nQUESTION: You have about --\nMS. BIRNBAUM: Two minutes?\nQUESTION: You have, I think, a minute and a\nhalf -- but let's make it two and a half.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SHEILA L. BIRNBAUM\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. BIRNBAUM: Thank you, Your Honor, I\nappreciate that, because there are certain things that Mr.\nTribe said that I think we have to clarify.\nFirst of all, this case, on the openings of the\nplaintiff, the plaintiff said to the jury, this case\ntranscends the Campbells' file. It involves a nationwide\npractice. He went on to say, you're going to be\nevaluating and assessing and hopefully requiring State\nFarm to stand accountable for what it is doing across the\ncountry. That is the purpose of punitive damages.\nOn the summation, they asked this jury to act as\na national regulator, because none of the regulators had\nacted against State Farm. Can you imagine, in a 14 -- in\na 20-year period, State Farm handled approximately 280\nmillion claims.\nQUESTION: What limiting instruction did you ask\nfor?\nMS. BIRNBAUM: The only instruction, Your Honor,\nwas the instruction that I previously read to Justice\nGinsburg that they should look to the conduct toward the\nCampbells, and that was the instruction. There was no\nother instruction.\nBut whether there was an instruction or not, I\nthink as the Ninth Circuit just said in White v. Ford, you\nhave to look at the evidence, the openings, the closings,\nand what was punished here. It was a scheme, and the\nscheme had no causal relationship with the decision to try\nthis case.\nYou asked, Justice Stevens, how much of the\nevidence was extraterritorial? Huge amounts, and it came\nin on direct, and we have it cited in our brief, and it\nwasn't only --\nQUESTION: Do you disagree with Mr. Tribe's\nsuggestion that over half the evidence related to Utah?\nMS. BIRNBAUM: No, Your Honor. It related to\nMr. Campbell's underlying case, not to actions in Utah\nthat harmed Utah policyholders. That was all inferred\nfrom this large national scheme. In fact, the evidence is\ncontrary.\nQUESTION: You're saying the Utah evidence was\nevidence relating to this particular case --\nMS. BIRNBAUM: Absolutely.\nQUESTION: -- rather than to other Utah\npolicyholders.\nMS. BIRNBAUM: And if you look at the footnote\nin their brief, and look at our reply brief, we point out\nall of that evidence had to do with the underlying case.\nThe lawyers from the underlying case, Mr. Campbell, Mrs.\nCampbell, Ospital, Slusher et cetera, and this issue of\nwhether there was one, whether this -- Mr. Campbell was\nvulnerable, Mr. Campbell was the only person in this whole\ntrial that wasn't vulnerable.\nman and who had a B.A. and an M.A. He sat through the\nentire trial and he said he was not liable, and the\ndecision was made that this was a no liability case.\nMr. Tribe says Ospital was not speeding --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Ms. Birnbaum.\nMS. BIRNBAUM: Thank you so much.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I think we've got your\nposition.\n"
