HUGHEY\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER FEDERAL MARITIME COMMISSION\nMR. HUGHEY: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThe adjudication of a Shipping Act complaint by\nthe Federal Maritime Commission is an administrative\nregulatory process through which the agency makes findings\nof fact and applies its interpretation of the Shipping Act\nto those findings of fact. This is an exercise of\nexecutive power.\nQUESTION: Well, why isn't that adjudication, if\nit applies the law to findings of fact?\nMR. HUGHEY: Mr. Chief Justice, it is\nadjudication, but what we're suggesting is that it's not\njudicial. It is an executive branch adjudication that\npermits the agency to determine what position it would\nlike to take with respect to potential violations of the\nShipping Act.\nQUESTION: But doesn't it involve a decision as\nto whether this particular respondent before the\ncommission has violated some provision of the act?\nMR. HUGHEY: Yes, and in that sense, Your Honor,\nit is an exercise of ad hoc regulation. It's regulation\non a specific and discrete set of facts.\nQUESTION: Well, you could say the same thing\nabout a court, that it's not making an -- making an ad hoc\nregulation on these particular facts.\nMR. HUGHEY: However, Your Honor, in the case of\na court and a decision issued by a court, such an order\nwould be self-executing, whereas a Federal Maritime\nCommission regulatory determination is not self-executing.\nRather, in the event that it's not voluntary compliance\nwith whatever order the agency reaches at the end of an\nadjudication, the Attorney General or a private\ncomplainant must go into a Federal district court and seek\nto have that Federal district court compel compliance.\nQUESTION: Suppose Congress --\nQUESTION: Well, presumably a State would\nfeel -- would hesitate not to appear because it might\nultimately be enforced against the State by the Attorney\nGeneral, isn't that right?\nMR. HUGHEY: Yes, I think that is correct,\nJustice O'Connor, that a State might --\nQUESTION: Well, if the State is compelled to\nparticipate, does that alter our analysis of it?\nMR. HUGHEY: No, I don't think so, because the\nextent to which the State feels compelled by a potential\naction by the Attorney General of the United States is\ncompulsion that arises from an action of the Federal\nGovernment itself in the name of the United States.\nQUESTION: What if a -- is a private plaintiff\nentitled to take a decision, or order, whatever you want\nto call it, of the commission, and seek to have it\nenforced by a court?\nMR. HUGHEY: Yes, Your Honor, under the Shipping\nAct a private plaintiff is permitted to go into a Federal\ndistrict court --\nQUESTION: And would the Eleventh Amendment\ndefense raised by the State there prevail?\nMR. HUGHEY: I think that that case would\npresent a much more significant Eleventh Amendment issue.\nThe Shipping Act provides that the district court hearing\nand, of course, an action brought by a private complainant\nmust have jurisdiction of the parties. I would suggest\nthat to the extent there's any Eleventh Amendment interest\nthat requires vindication under the Shipping Act, that\nvindication can be explored in the Federal district court\nproceeding.\nQUESTION: Do you concede that at least as to\nreparation, where as I understand it the Government can go\ninto the district court to seek reparations, only the\nprivate party, at least as to seeking dollars from the\nState agency, that the Eleventh Amendment would preclude\nthat?\nMR. HUGHEY: Well, in its order in this case,\nJustice Ginsburg, the commissioner finds that it would\nlike to see its reparation orders deemed to be enforceable\nby a Federal district court, so I can't concede that they\nwouldn't be, but what I can say is that determination is\nnot within the agency's jurisdiction. That would be a\ndetermination for the Federal district court to make in\nthe event that the State instrumentality raised an\nEleventh Amendment immunity defense to the attempted\nenforcement action by the private complainant.\nQUESTION: Mr. Hughey, why do you assume that if\nthis is not judicial action, sovereign immunity doesn't\napply? I mean, I guess whatever sovereign immunity the\nStates retained upon the formation of the Federal\nConstitution was the sovereign immunity that existed in\ninternational law at the time.\nCan foreign sovereigns be summoned before\nexecutive or legislative tribunals in this country?\nMR. HUGHEY: I don't know whether foreign\nsovereigns can be summoned before the --\nQUESTION: Well, but the State sovereign\nimmunity is just what -- the sovereign immunity that they\nhad at international law. That's what -- the Eleventh\nAmendment is just a reflection of the fact that they\nretained that sort of sovereign immunity, and I don't\nthink it makes any difference that, you know, if the King\nof England summons George Washington, President of the\nUnited States, to appear before a parliamentary commission\nor some royal tribunal instead of an English court. I\nthink George Washington would say, you know, go fly a\nkite.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. HUGHEY: Well, I think that one can turn to\nthe text of the Eleventh Amendment itself for some\nguidance on this issue, Justice Scalia.\nQUESTION: No, you can't, because the Eleventh\nAmendment is just -- we have held that it represents just\na reflection of the fact that the States retained that\nsovereign immunity that they had before the formation of\nthe Federal Republic, and --\nMR. HUGHEY: It's a reflection, Your Honor, of\nthe immunity from coercive judicial process. I think\nthat's why the Eleventh Amendment begins that the judicial\npower of the United States shall not be construed to\nany --\nQUESTION: That's the conclusion, but what\nJustice Scalia's asking, and I think we're interested in,\nis whether there's any precedent that you could cite, any\nhistorical source that says that an administrative\ntribunal can summon a sovereign before it and render a\njudgment.\nMR. HUGHEY: Well, if I may suggest a different\nside to that is that there is no precedent to suggest that\nit can't. It's been held by this Court in California v.\nUnited States that State-run courts are subject to\ncommission regulation.\nQUESTION: Well, but if it's the dog that didn't\nbark theory, it seems to me that cuts against you. If\nthis has never been done, that's probably because it can't\nbe done. At least we can make that inference.\nMR. HUGHEY: No, I think it has been done since\nthe Shipping Act was first passed, and it simply --\nQUESTION: I'm not talking about the Shipping\nAct. I'm talking about other authority. If you're saying\nthat the Shipping Act is the precedent-breaking ground, it\nseems to me that you're then on somewhat a slender\nfoundation for your argument here.\nMR. HUGHEY: This Court held in California v.\nUnited States that the Shipping Act as a regulatory\nstatute applies to all State-run courts. What the\ncommission is suggesting, Justice Kennedy, is that that\napplies equally with respect to agency adjudications.\nQUESTION: But California v. United States, the\nUnited States was a party, so there was no Eleventh\nAmendment question there.\nMR. HUGHEY: No, the question I think was\nwhether the entire statute, which at that time included a\nregulatory procedure that could be initiated by private\ncomplainants, whether the entire statute, which was a\ncoherent regulatory scheme, applied to State-run ports,\nand that's what the Court held. The Court specifically\nreferred to the scheme for regulating waterfront\nterminals, not the specific provision within that scheme\nthat permits the United States itself to initiate an\ninvestigation.\nQUESTION: But the case itself, United States v.\nCalifornia, raised no Eleventh Amendment problem.\nMR. HUGHEY: No, that's correct. That's\ncorrect, it didn't raise an Eleventh Amendment problem,\nbut the issue was whether the regulatory scheme as a whole\ncould be applied to State instrumentalities, and this\nadjudicatory proceeding under the Shipping Act is part of\nthat regulatory program.\nWith respect --\nQUESTION: Is there any -- I mean, it's sort of\nan interesting question, but I wonder if there are laws or\nrules which say that the Congress says that any ship,\nincluding ships belonging to foreign States that enter New\nYork Harbor, will abide by the rules of the New York\nHarbor Authority, and if they don't, you can -- there's\nsome argument about whether the pilot comes on or\nsomething, that ship, including a military ship of a\nforeign nation, or any other, has to adjudicate the\ncontroversy in front of the New York Authority or other --\nI don't know how that works, but maybe you do. I imagine\nthey are subject to our rules when they come here, and\nbring their ships into the harbor.\nMR. HUGHEY: Yes, I would think so, and the\ncommission does have some jurisdiction over foreign-\noperated and -- foreign operated vessels that are owned by\nsovereigns. The commission regulates sally-to-port\ncontrolled carriers which are vessels that are owned by\nGovernments. If a complaint were to be filed against such\nan entity, I see no reason why the commission would not\nattempt to assert its regulatory adjudicatory jurisdiction\nover such a complaint, but I know of no such specific case\nunder the statute.\nQUESTION: How do you get around the, sort of\nthe principle of dignity which has been emphasized in\nevery case, I think, since Seminole, and it's been given a\nprominent place in the reasoning of the court majority in\nthose cases, that it's the dignity of the States, and so\non, which must be preserved.\nIf under the rule of sovereign immunity which\noverarches the Eleventh Amendment there were indefeasible\ndignity interests in the adjudication, say, in Seminole\nand all of them, doesn't it follow, a fortiori, that there\nare dignitary interests that would be offended by hauling\nthe State in front of an Article I, a purely\nadministrative tribunal?\nMR. HUGHEY: I think I would have two responses\nto that, Justice Souter. First is that I understand the\ndignitary interest to be co-extensive with the sovereign\nimmunity interest, and second --\nQUESTION: Well, that leaves the question in\na -- unanswered, I guess. The --\nQUESTION: Justice Souter says the sovereign\nimmunity interest is co-extensive with the dignitary\ninterest.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Let's assume the co-existence.\nWhat's the answer to the question?\nMR. HUGHEY: Well, I think the answer would be,\nthen, that sovereign immunity doesn't apply, that a\nState's dignity is not offended.\nQUESTION: I certainly agree with you.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: Because dignity seems to have been\ntaken, in fact, as one of the interests to be served by\nsovereign immunity. Why doesn't the doctrine of sovereign\nimmunity, why doesn't it apply if applied in those other\ncases?\nMR. HUGHEY: Well, I think that the dignity of\nthe State is less offended by this type of regulatory\nadjudication, given the fact that the agency has no\ncoercive power to compel anything from the State.\nQUESTION: I -- it seems to me intuitively just\nthe opposite. I mean, these are tribunals that -- if\nwe're going to talk about dignity, these are tribunals\nthat do not have the dignity of the judicial forums that\nwere at stake in the preceding cases, and I would have\nsupposed that the offense to the sovereignty of the State\nwas even greater to pull the State before these lesser\ntribunals.\nMR. HUGHEY: Well, I think the offense to the\ndignity interest of the State occurs when a State is\nforced to do something which is the result of a coercive\nact. Under the Shipping Act --\nQUESTION: Everything was fine in Seminole and\nall of them, until we got to the point of judgment? I\nmean, is that the way you're trying to cut the argument?\nMR. HUGHEY: No. I think in cases like Alden\nand Seminole Tribe it was the threat of judgment that hung\nover the United States that was the problem, because in\nthose cases, if the court entered an order against a State\nit was automatically self-enforcing them.\nQUESTION: Well, they could have made them\nappear and just said, you know, we understand that -- just\nas you're saying, we understand that an order can't issue\nagainst you, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't show up.\nWe haven't said that in sovereign immunity.\nWe've said the State does not have to appear. It is\nhauling the State before the tribunal that is the offense,\nnot just the judgment.\nMR. HUGHEY: Well, I think with respect to your\nhypothetical this Court has found the power of coercion or\ncontempt is the judicial power necessary to the exercise\nof all others, so I don't think that a court could just\ntell a State, well, appear and we're not going to be able\nto issue an order against you. I think the fact that\ncoercion can result from the judicial proceeding is the\npoint of the judicial proceeding and is what\ndifferentiates it from this type of regulatory\nadjudication.\nQUESTION: Well, but the court can't say it, but\nthe Eleventh Amendment says it. I mean, and whereupon the\ncourt can say, look, you know, by reason of your sovereign\nimmunity, we understand if you show up we can't issue any\ncontempt judgment, we can't issue a merits judgment\nagainst you, but that doesn't mean you don't have to show\nup. But it does mean you don't have to show up, doesn't\nit?\nMR. HUGHEY: Well, yes, the State can move to\ndismiss any suit that's filed against it in a court, but I\nstill think that it's the threat of coercive judgment\nagainst the State that is the reason that the State can --\nQUESTION: There is no threat of coercive\njudgment. The Eleventh Amendment makes it very clear that\nyou can't issue the coercive judgment, but the State still\ndoesn't have to show up.\nMR. HUGHEY: I don't think that analysis should\napply to this statute, Justice Scalia, because under the\nShipping Act the agency can -- cannot compel an appearance\nby the State. If the State just doesn't show up under the\nShipping Act, the only way to do anything about that is to\ngo into a Federal district court and seek a court order,\nand if the agency determines to do that, it then has to\nask the Attorney General to do so. Under the statute, the\nAttorney General may, rather than shall, enforce any order\nthe commission issued. That is therefore, by definition,\nan exercise of the executive discretion that this Court\nfound acceptable in Alden v. Maine.\nQUESTION: Does the commission have contempt\npowers?\nMR. HUGHEY: No. No, it does not.\nQUESTION: Well, if it issues its process to a\nState and the -- like the entity in the present case, and\nthe entity simply fails to show up, what can it do?\nMR. HUGHEY: If the entity failed to show up,\nMr. Chief Justice, the commission could issue an order\ntelling it to show up, but again, that would have to be\nenforced by a Federal district court, and if --\nQUESTION: At the behest of the Attorney\nGeneral, or --\nMR. HUGHEY: Yes. Yes. The commission would\nhave to ask the Attorney General to enforce it. Under the\nstatute the Attorney General doesn't have to, but if he\ndetermined to do so, he could then go into a district\ncourt and try to enforce the order.\nQUESTION: And what would be the Eleventh\nAmendment situation there, when the commission went into\ndistrict court to try to enforce its order to require\nappearing?\nMR. HUGHEY: Oh, I would suggest that there\nwould be no Eleventh Amendment problem there, because the\nenforcement action would be in the name of and by the\nUnited States.\nQUESTION: It would be by the United States?\nMR. HUGHEY: Yes. It would be in the name of\nand by the United States. In this case, it would be, for\nexample, United States v. South Carolina State Ports\nAuthority.\nQUESTION: How many agencies have a pattern like\nthis, where they determine the rules by rule-making, this\nkind of adjudication, and a commission-initiated\nproceeding?\nMR. HUGHEY: I know that the Surface\nTransportation Board, which used to be the NSA Commerce\nCommission, has this authority, and I think that the\nFederal Communication Commission does, but I'm not\nentirely certain of that. I would suggest, if I may, that\nto uphold the State's claim of Eleventh Amendment immunity\nin this case will have an adverse effect on the regulatory\nscheme that the Congress has created in the Shipping Act\nby undermining the notion of national uniformity in\nmaritime commercial regulations.\nQUESTION: Well, Congress could certainly handle\nthat by making it very clear by legislation that if the\nState runs one of these operations, the State waives its\nsovereign immunity. Couldn't Congress make that clear?\nMR. HUGHEY: I'm not sure if that kind of waiver\nis still acceptable after this Court's opinions of recent\nyears.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. HUGHEY: I would suggest that it's probably\nnot, but we think that, under the statute as it's written\nnow, there's no need for something like that, because it's\nmerely a regulatory action that the commission is\nattempting to utilize to find facts to determine what\nconstitutes a Shipping Act violation, and again, there's\nno use of coercive power. In order for there to be\ncoercion, the commission has to go into a Federal district\ncourt.\nIf I could reserve the remainder of my time for\nrebuttal.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Hughey.\nMr. Clement, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES\nIN SUPPORT OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nStates enjoy no sovereign immunity from Federal\nexecutive branch action, even when it takes the form of\nadjudication. It is well-established that States have no\nimmunity from a suit brought by the Federal Government.\nThat's true not because of some preexisting notion of\nsovereign immunity, but because that consent to suits by\nthe United States Federal Government is implicit in the\nplan of the convention.\nNow, proceedings before the Federal Maritime\nCommission are a necessary predicate for the United States\nGovernment to bring a Federal suit to enforce the Shipping\nAct. Given that the States enjoy no immunity from such a\nsuit, they should not be allowed to reach back into the\nadministrative process and assert an immunity from the\npreliminary proceedings before the agency.\nQUESTION: But I'm not -- I don't understand the\nargument. Sovereign immunity is based on parties, and we\nhave said that when the United States is a party, there's\nno sovereign immunity, and not, incidentally, because that\nwas inconsistent with some earlier notion of sovereign\nimmunity, because the Constitution changed it.\nMR. CLEMENT: No --\nQUESTION: But here we have a private party.\nThat's all -- isn't that all the difference in the world?\nMR. CLEMENT: But we have a private party that's\nnot initiating a lawsuit, but is initiating executive\naction. Private parties are free to complain to the\nFederal Government and say a State government is violating\nFederal law. In fact, the Petition Clause rightly\nprotects the individual petitioner's right to petition the\nFederal Government and complain about that violation.\nNow, I don't think it violates the Constitution\nfor the United States Federal Government to say, we take\ncitizen complaints seriously, and we're going to\ninvestigate each and every one of them, and I wouldn't\nthink that it would violate the Eleventh Amendment for the\nAttorney General to give the party who's the subject of\nthe complaint, even if it's the State, an opportunity to\ncome before --\nQUESTION: Yes, but --\nMR. CLEMENT: -- the executive branch and\nexplain why there wasn't a violation.\nQUESTION: But the commission isn't just like\nkind of an ombudsman here. I mean, it's got very definite\nprocedures that greatly resemble adjudication.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, they do resemble\nadjudication, and that's part of the process to formalize\nand regularize this process of getting complaints from\ncitizens and response from others, but I don't think the\nformalization and regularization of that process turns it\ninto a judicial act. It remains an act --\nQUESTION: Well, isn't it the case that if the\nState defaults and says, you have no jurisdiction over me,\nand the commission therefore comes to a conclusion --\nwe'll leave the word adjudication out of it. It comes to\na conclusion. That conclusion itself is enforceable as\nsuch, at the behest of the National Government, in a\ndistrict court, isn't it?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, first I want to clarify\nsomething. If there's a case where the State doesn't\nappear, and the private party is asserting a view of the\nShipping Act that's contrary to the view of the Federal\nMaritime Commission, then there will be no order.\nQUESTION: Let's assume it's not contrary.\nLet's assume the Maritime Commission says, you, private\nparty, are right, and we hold that the State has committed\nthe following violations, and I presume should be enjoined\nfrom further commission, whatever order it might come up\nwith.\nOnce the commission has come to such a\nconclusion, isn't that conclusion, as such, enforceable at\nthe behest of the United States in the district court?\nMR. CLEMENT: It is -- it would be enforceable\nthrough a judicial procedure under the Shipping Act.\nQUESTION: So -- if that is so, there's\nsomething much more involved here than merely an agency of\nthe National Government taking a complaint seriously and\ninvestigating it, and the difference is that in the --\nunder the act, its conclusion on the investigation becomes\nan enforceable order at the behest of the National\nGovernment in a district court, and isn't that the\ndifference?\nMR. CLEMENT: But I don't think it's a critical\ndifference, because the reason that that becomes\nenforceable, subject to whatever defenses there are, the\nreason that becomes enforceable is not because it's the\nmidway point in some litigation. It's enforceable because\nit reflects the executive branch's definitive\ninterpretation of the Shipping Act.\nThe cease-and-desist order --\nQUESTION: Well, the Federal Government could\nhave an interpretation of the Shipping Act and go into\nit -- assuming there is otherwise a statutory jurisdiction\nhere, the National Government could have a view of the\nshipping Act and go into the district court and say, this\nis our considered view, and the other party would have an\nopportunity to oppose it. We'd have a lawsuit.\nAs things stand now, when the United States goes\nin with what you call its considered view, that is the end\nof the issue on the merits, as I understand it. The only\nthing the district court is there for is to enforce it.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, there are some challenges\nthat can be brought to that, and I guess the problem with\nthis --\nQUESTION: Could they have a trial de novo on\nthe merits?\nMR. CLEMENT: No, they can't, under the current\nsystem.\nQUESTION: Could they collaterally attack and\nsay, look, it doesn't mean anything to us, because we\ncan't be hauled in front of the commission by a private\nparty. Can it -- is such a plea recognized?\nMR. CLEMENT: I don't think it currently is, but\nif that's --\nQUESTION: No, I don't think it is, either, and\nthat's why your argument that this is nothing but a way\nfor the National Government to take a considered view of a\ncomplaint and come to a conclusion seems to me beside the\npoint.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, it -- but the point, I\nthink -- first of all, if the problem is the level of\nreview that's given at the end of the process, then that's\nwhat should be adjusted, not throwing out the entire\nproceeding ab initio as the Fourth Circuit did.\nBut more to the point, I think the reason\nthere's deference is because it reflects the executive\nbranch's view, and it's the same in that order whether\nit's the product of a privately initiated complaint and\nadjudication, or whether it's an agency-initiated\ncomplaint. In both cases there's going to be practical\npressure for the State-regulated entity to participate in\nthe proceeding, but neither should they get an immunity.\nThe practical pressure is not the same as the\ncompulsive process that the judiciary has. Nobody's\nsummoned before the commission because a summons is\nnecessarily enforced through the contempt power of the\ncourt. This is --\nQUESTION: Well, Mr. Clement, when I began to\nread your brief and I sensed that the sky was falling, and\nso I was turning my pages to see all of the horrible\nthings that were going to happen to the Federal scheme if\nthe court of appeals judgment stood, and I didn't see much\nthere. There's the Vending Stand Act in one of the\ncircuit courts, but do Federal agencies call Governors\nbefore them all the time and say, well now, Governor,\nyou're not enforcing the Federal laws? I don't see that\nas part of our constitutional tradition. I don't see that\nwe would create a great revolution in traditional practice\nby pulling the Ninth Circuit.\nMR. CLEMENT: What there is a tradition of is\nthe executive branch having the flexibility to determine\nhow it is going to enforce Federal law. There aren't many\nof these cases precisely because there just aren't that\nmany State-run entities that are regulated, but the\nexecutive branch has the flexibility to regulate them\nthrough rule-making, through agency-initiated\nadjudications, or through private adjudications.\nIn each one of those, there are practical\npressures to participate. In each one of those, the rule-\nmaking can be initiated by a private complaint. There's a\nspecific provision in the commission's regulation to allow\nrule-makings to be kicked off by a private complaint, but\nthat doesn't turn it into something other than the\nexecutive branch's determination of what the law is and\nhow it should be enforced, and this Court has generally\ndeferred to the executive branch's need to determine how\nbest to take care that the laws are faithfully executed.\nQUESTION: What about the labor board?\nMR. CLEMENT: What's that?\nQUESTION: What about the labor board,\nuniversities?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, --\nQUESTION: State universities and the labor\nboard.\nMR. CLEMENT: I don't know the specific\napplication, but --\nQUESTION: No, but I'm thinking that the\nuniversities often have unions, and I gather that -- why\nhasn't the labor board been involved in adjudicating\ncomplaints about the State university as an employer in\nrespect to the labor unions?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well --\nQUESTION: Maybe it hasn't. I wouldn't know why\nit wouldn't have.\nMR. CLEMENT: I mean, but one thing that's\ncertainly clear about the labor board is that that's a\nperfect example of an administrative agency that decides\nto proceed by adjudication.\nQUESTION: I'm not arguing with you. I'm just\nwondering why there were not more examples.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, another example is the\nRailway Labor Act, because the Railway Labor Act is --\ndefines its jurisdiction coextensively with the Interstate\nCommerce Commission. There are State-run railroads under\nthe Railway Labor Act. Typically those kind of employment\ndisputes are initiated by a private party. This court in\nCalifornia v. Taylor said that the Railway Labor Act can\napply to a State-run railroad.\nInterestingly, in footnote 16 of that opinion,\nthe Court reserved the question of whether the Eleventh\nAmendment provided protection for the suit in court, but\nit didn't say anything about Eleventh Amendment protection\nbefore the board itself, and I think the relevant history\nhere is almost exactly the opposite of the case in Alden.\nIn Alden, this case had a long history of State\nsovereign immunity, and very few and only recent efforts\nby the Federal Government to abrogate that immunity.\nHere, by contrast, there's a 115-year tradition of State\nentities being subject to regulatory commissions, and very\nfew and only recent efforts to invoke any kind of Eleventh\nAmendment immunity before them.\nI also think that the text of the Eleventh\nAmendment has a special relevance here that it lacked in\nAlden. In Alden, the determination that State courts not\nexercise the, quote, judicial power of the United States,\nonly began the analysis of whether or not the States\nenjoyed their sovereign immunity free from congressional\ndisturbance.\nHere, the recognition that the commission\nexercise -- does not exercise the judicial power of the\nUnited States necessarily means it exercises the executive\npower of the United States, and this Court has\ntraditionally held that the executive branch may initiate\nprocess against the States without an Eleventh Amendment\nbar.\nThe fact that this proceeding --\nQUESTION: Well, it's not -- you keep speaking\nabout an Eleventh Amendment bar. The bar is sovereign\nimmunity. We're not concerned about the textual\nlimitations about the Eleventh Amendment. We're concerned\nwith sovereign immunity.\nMR. CLEMENT: But in this particular context, I\nthink the text is relevant, because this is not a free-\nfloating, pre-existing notion of sovereign immunity. What\nwe're saying is that the Eleventh Amendment waiver in the\nplan of the Constitution that allows the United States\nGovernment to sue a State also allows it to take the\npreliminary steps in the administrative process.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Clement.\nMr. Dean, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF WARREN L. DEAN, JR.\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. DEAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nThis case presents the question of whether\nsovereign immunity protects a State from a private suit\nbrought before a Federal administrative tribunal. We have\nheard today arguments and suggestions that this proceeding\nis not a suit within the meaning of the doctrine and\nprinciple of sovereign immunity.\nIn 1868, this Court addressed this question. It\nheld in Nichols v. United States that a proceeding before\nan Article I administrative tribunal, a so-called\nlegislative court, just like the Federal Maritime\nCommission, was a suit for sovereign immunity purposes.\nThe case was appealed from an appeals court.\nThe Court confirmed that legislative court\nstatus of the claims court twice, in Ex parte Bakelite in\n1929, and then in Williams v. United States in 1933, and\nlater in 1934 the court again, in United States v.\nSherwood, unanimously confirmed both conclusions, that\nStates -- that claims court was an Article I legislative\ncourt, and its jurisdiction was dependent upon a waiver of\nsovereign immunity. There were no dissenting justices in\nany single one of those decisions.\nQUESTION: Mr. Dean, but that was an Article I\ncourt that just adjudicates. Here we're being told that\nthe Maritime Commission is in the business of making rules\nfor the governance of people in the trade, and it makes\nthe rules three ways. One through rule-making, another's\nthrough commission proceeding, and a third through private\ncomplaints, and why couldn't the private complainant be\nregarded as a kind of delegate to the commission? I take\nit if the commission itself decided to investigate, you\nwould have no question about sovereign immunity, is that\ntrue?\nMR. DEAN: We've made that clear throughout this\nproceeding, Justice.\nQUESTION: All right. So why can't the\ncommission say, one of the ways that we investigate is, we\nlisten to what private people tell us, so that in effect\nwe're taking that private complaint and we're making it\nour own by processing it?\nMR. DEAN: That's exactly -- that is exactly\nwhat does not happen in this case, Your Honor. A private\ncomplainant files a complaint before the Federal Maritime\nCommission, we receive the notice, we either respond or\nwe're in default. It is quite clear -- and I submit with\nall due respect that Mr. Clement is absolutely wrong on\nthis. It is quite clear that the agency can find both\nfindings of fact and findings of law against a\nnonresponding party.\nThat's been established administrative procedure\nlaw for sometime and, in fact, the private party controls\nthe disposition of this proceeding. The executive arm of\nthe Federal Maritime Commission, its Bureau of\nEnforcement, does not even have a right to intervene in\nthe proceeding. It has to petition like any other private\nparty to get involved in the proceeding. They did not do\nthat in this case.\nQUESTION: Can the private party ask --\nQUESTION: -- have standing?\nMR. DEAN: They have to show cause for\nintervention, Justice Kennedy, just like any other private\nparty would do. They have no greater standing than any\nother private party.\nQUESTION: But could a private party say to the\ncommission, commission, here's a serious complaint,\nsomething wrong has been done, I don't have the resources\nto prosecute it, would you please investigate it?\nMR. DEAN: Oh, absolutely. That's the way the\ncommission traditionally does business. That is an\nentirely separate proceeding. That is the proceeding to\nwhich we would not object. If a private party came into\nthe commission and said, we have this grievance against\nthe South Carolina State Port Authority and we'd like you\nto look into it, and the Bureau of Enforcement came to us\nand said, we think you're doing something wrong, we would\nobviously talk to them, and if we couldn't reach some kind\nof accommodation with respect to that matter, then we\nwould -- and they brought a complaint against us, they\nwould be entitled to do that if -- provided the complaint\nwas brought in their names and formed by the United\nStates.\nAnd I might add that, in a reparations\nproceeding -- this is not a sanctionless exercise. In a\nreparations proceeding, if the agency issues an order\nagainst us, a judgment against us, and we fail to comply\nwith that judgment, we incur statutory liabilities,\nautomatic, of up to $25,000 a day. Now, they can be\ncompromised by the agency for a period of 5 years after\neach violation, if it so chooses, but any time somebody\nsays to me, for example, that if you don't do XYZ you're\ngoing to incur an automatic statutory liability of $25,000\na day, I consider that a sanction, and --\nQUESTION: Well, is that statutory liability, is\nthat enforceable by the commission without court order, or\ndid it have to go to court to do it?\nMR. DEAN: Ultimately, if push comes to shove\nand there's a confrontation, they have to go to court, but\nMr. Chief Justice, I think anybody faced with a statutory\nliability of the United States imposed by Federal law\nconsiders that a sanction, and we do not have the\nopportunity to protect our interests, to say, no, no, no,\nthis wasn't a violation, this is what we did, when the\nagency, the only standard for the enforcement of the\nagency's order in court is whether or not it was duly and\nregularly issued.\nSo the position of the United States that this\nis not a -- that this is a proceeding that is essentially\nequivalent to a petition by a private party for executive\naction is absolutely incorrect, and they don't even\nbelieve that position themselves.\nQUESTION: Could I go back to your opening\nstatement? Why is it an exercise of the judicial power of\nthe United States? I mean, we have an ordinary\nadministrative agency. What's the theory of it?\nI mean, I grant you, I'm sure you're right, that\nthere's some case that said once the court of claims,\nwhich is a court in exercising -- though set up under\nthose Article I exercises the judicial power of the United\nStates, so my Constitution says it has nothing to do with\nwhether it's a lawsuit, not a lawsuit, I don't care. I\nwant to know, is it the judicial power of the United\nStates, and frankly, I didn't know that the executive\nbranch could exercise the judicial power of the United\nStates.\nMR. DEAN: The court below held --\nQUESTION: Whatever they held, I want to know\nwhat the reasoning of it is.\nMR. DEAN: Well, the reasoning -- the\njudicial -- you don't need to find the judicial power.\nQUESTION: You don't? My Constitution happens\nto say, the judicial power of the United States shall not\nbe construed, so I'm -- maybe I don't have to find it,\nbut I'd like to know on what basis I wouldn't have to .\nMR. DEAN: This is a case brought by a citizen\nof the State of South Carolina, like Chisholm v. Georgia,\nI might add, against the -- against a -- the State of\nSouth Carolina. It's not technically for those terms and\nthose terms alone within the scope of the Eleventh\nAmendment.\nQUESTION: All right, fine, it's not within the\nscope of the Eleventh Amendment.\nMR. DEAN: It's Hans v. Louisiana.\nQUESTION: Oh, no, no, I want to know if it is\nwith -- forget the fact -- I think it is within the scope\nof the Eleventh Amendment if a -- I believed, as far as I\nknow, when a citizen of a State sues the State itself, of\nwhich he is a citizen, it is an interpretation of the\nEleventh Amendment, and I didn't know that for that\npurpose you didn't have to find the judicial power of the\nUnited States, so I'm open to that argument.\nMR. DEAN: Well --\nQUESTION: I want to know, is this the judicial\npower? If so, what's the argument? If it's not the\njudicial power, what part of the Constitution forbids it?\nMR. DEAN: First, it is -- we have stated it is\nthe judicial power, but you need not find that, and I'll\ngive you the reason it is the judicial power of the United\nStates, is because this agency acts as an adjunct to the\ncourt, just as this Court has held in Northern Pipeline\nand --\nQUESTION: Do all administrative --\nQUESTION: Did you say it was the exercise of\njudicial power?\nMR. DEAN: It is the exercise of -- the Shipping\nAct entails the exercise of judicial power, Justice\nStevens. You can look at this either as an organic\nanalysis, as you have done under the Appointments Clause\nof the commission itself, or you can look at the statutory\nprocess and procedure that is involved.\nQUESTION: Does the Federal Trade Commission\nexercise the judicial power, does the State Department,\ndoes the Commerce Department, the Post Office -- I mean,\nwhat is the principle under which this is or is not?\nMR. DEAN: Well, the --\nQUESTION: What about the President, let's say,\nwhen he's -- you see the point.\nMR. DEAN: In your book, Justice Breyer, you\ncall this an uneasy constitutional area, and I certainly\nagree with that.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. DEAN: The judicial power of the United\nStates, this Court has held in a number of cases,\nincluding the cases that I just mentioned, that the\njudicial power can -- at least some component of the\nexercise of the judicial power in a comprehensive\nproceeding can be delegated to nonjudicial officers,\nprovided it is subject to judicial supervision and subject\nto some specific supervisory parameters that exist in this\ncase, but it's a complicated question, and the Court has\ndisagreed on it, and various court have disagreed on this\nquestion for sometime, and in fact, in some of the cases\nthat I just mentioned, the United States Supreme Court\ntook appellate jurisdiction from an Article I tribunal in\nthe executive branch, and under those circumstances\nsomething was going on before the court of claims.\nQUESTION: You know, now that I can quote one of\nmy favorite authors, Justice Scalia, he says it is no\ndoubt true that all such administrative bodies adjudicate,\nthey determine facts, apply a rule of law to those facts,\nand thus arrive at a decision --\nMR. DEAN: Well --\nQUESTION: -- but there is nothing inherently\njudicial about adjudication.\nMR. DEAN: Granted, but --\nQUESTION: Then what is it that makes it the\njudicial power?\nMR. DEAN: What is it that makes it subject to\nsovereign immunity, or what is it that makes it the\njudicial power?\nQUESTION: The judicial power is what we're\nall -- and I'm --\nMR. DEAN: Well, the judicial power, if you look\nat a proceeding, an administrative proceeding like the\nShipping Act, and this Court held that, held this in the\nFar East Conference case, it said, you can't take one\nisolated aspect of it. You cannot take the organic entity\nwhich is the Federal Maritime Commission and consider its\nfunctions independent of the rest of the proceeding that\nis involved.\nUltimately, this proceeding ultimately, in\ncombination with the courts of the United States, this\nproceeding invokes the judicial power, whether the FMC is\nacting --\nQUESTION: All executive action does. I mean,\nthat's just too broad a principle. I mean, the fact is,\nsince we don't have a -- we have a Constitution that has\na Habeas Corpus Clause. There's nothing the executive can\ndo to you that can't be challenged in court.\nMR. DEAN: Well, this is --\nQUESTION: Ultimately, the court is the moment\nof truth, but that doesn't convert every executive action\ninto an exercise of the judicial power.\nMR. DEAN: I know, but this is clearly not\npurely executive action. This is an independent agency,\nand this Court has held repeatedly that officers that\nexercise quasi-judicial power can be subject to special\nremoval requirements, and that is --\nQUESTION: Ah, so if this wasn't an independent\nagency, it would be different?\nMR. DEAN: No, but let me -- both in Hensel and\nin Artistani, and in this Court's decision in West v.\nGibson --\nQUESTION: Would you -- may I just interrupt\nyou? What if this were an executive agency, rather than\nan independent agency? Could you make the same argument?\nMR. DEAN: Like -- the claims court was within\nthe Department of Treasury at the time these decisions\nwere handed down. That doesn't necessarily resolve the\nmatter, but it does instruct the Court's analysis that\nthis is a quasi-judicial independent agency --\nQUESTION: Well, but that's not answering my\nquestion.\nMR. DEAN: -- and its officers are not subject\nto executive supervision.\nQUESTION: What is your answer to my question?\nIf it were a pure executive agency, would it be the same\ncase for you?\nMR. DEAN: No. It would be the same case\ndepending on the statutory process involved, Justice\nStevens. The agencies --\nQUESTION: In the statuary process, but clearly\nan executive agency within the Department of Commerce or\nDepartment of Agriculture, or something like that.\nMR. DEAN: It was -- the court of claims was in\nthe Department of Treasury at the time, and customs\nofficials have done --\nQUESTION: You're a little too fast for me.\nMR. DEAN: I'm sorry.\nQUESTION: What is your answer? Is it the same\ncase entirely within the executive branch?\nMR. DEAN: It is.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nQUESTION: Let me ask you a slightly different\nquestion. If we assume for the sake of argument that it\nis not the judicial power that's being exercised here, do\nyou lose?\nMR. DEAN: No.\nQUESTION: Why don't you lose? Why don't you l\nlose?\nMR. DEAN: The court below said it was\nirrelevant.\nQUESTION: Pardon me?\nMR. DEAN: The court below said it was\nirrelevant, and I agree with that proposition.\nQUESTION: And it's irrelevant because?\nMR. DEAN: Because sovereign immunity --\nQUESTION: Sovereign immunity -- in other words,\nyou've got a sovereign immunity argument which is at least\ndistinct from the Eleventh Amendment argument?\nMR. DEAN: Absolutely.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. DEAN: And the United States has a sovereign\nimmunity argument, and they apply sovereign immunity --\nQUESTION: That's what I thought.\nMR. DEAN: The United States applies its\nsovereign immunity in proceedings just like this. It has\nfor all time. As a matter of fact, this Court has held\nsovereign immunity applies to the United States in\nadministrative proceedings consistently for the last 130\nyears, and there has not been one single dissent from that\nproposition that I've been able to find.\nIn West, all the Justices of this Court assumed\nfor the purposes of that analysis that sovereign immunity\nprinciples apply before the EEOC.\nQUESTION: Well, but sovereign immunity for the\nUnited States may not be co-extensive with sovereign\nimmunity for the States. Granted that sovereign immunity\nto the States goes beyond just the literal language of the\nEleventh Amendment about the judicial power.\nMR. DEAN: Mr. Chief Justice, I agree with that\nproposition in the abstract, but in this particular case,\nI think there's a lot of similarity, and I'll give you\nexactly -- I'll tell you exactly why I think why.\nFirstly, the courts have held that it's a\nreciprocal -- this Court has held over the years that it\nis a reciprocal privilege, but the United States in its\nbrief in this case --\nQUESTION: Excuse me. What do you mean by that,\nthat it's a reciprocal privilege?\nMR. DEAN: Well, in Alden and in Hans and -- the\nCourt has held that the privilege of Federal sovereign\nimmunity -- State sovereign immunity is a reciprocal\nprivilege to the privilege enjoyed by the States.\nQUESTION: By reciprocal you mean that it's co\nextensive?\nMR. DEAN: Co-extensive mirror image, yes,\nJustice Scalia.\nThe United States has suggested in this case,\nand it's a proposition that I agree with, that the\nsovereign immunity of the United States at least as it\napplies to money judgments -- and it's much broader than\nmoney judgments, but let's just talk about money judgments\nfor a minute, that at least as it applies to money\njudgments is informed by the Appropriations Clause, which\nreserves to the legislature, to the Congress the right to\nspend, and we all know the right to spend is the right to\ntax.\nSo our body politic, our -- the public -- the\npeople of the United States have made a determination that\ntheir Constitution, which is their sovereign, commits to\nthe legislative branches the exclusive right to expend the\npublic's money, and that's a very fundamental principle in\nour Federal Constitution. That principle is also\nreflected word for word in this constitution of South\nCarolina --\nQUESTION: Well, you don't think the States\nhave --\nMR. DEAN: Pardon me?\nQUESTION: -- the exclusive right to determine\nwhen their money will be spent in a proceeding brought by\nthe United States, do you?\nMR. DEAN: Excuse me?\nQUESTION: You don't say that the States have\nthe same power over their own money that the United States\nhas over its money, in an action brought by the United\nStates?\nMR. DEAN: I do.\nQUESTION: There's sovereign immunity -- even in\nan action brought by the United States?\nMR. DEAN: No, this Court has held that they\nhave consented to suit, so it doesn't apply in that area.\nQUESTION: So they don't have sovereign immunity\nin cases brought by the United States.\nMR. DEAN: That's correct, but in this\nconstitution of the State of South Carolina that was\nadopted 9 years before this Constitution was adopted,\nthere is the same Appropriations Clause. The same\nprinciple is reflected, that no moneys may be obligated --\nQUESTION: But that was before the Supremacy\nClause was adopted in the Federal Constitution.\nMR. DEAN: But this is a constitutional\nprinciple Justice Stevens. It is a question --\nQUESTION: It is not a constitutional\nprotection -- principle that protects the States from\nliability to the United States.\nMR. DEAN: I ask you this question as a\nhypothetical. The Constitution of this --\nQUESTION: No, counsel doesn't ask questions.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. DEAN: I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice.\nThe constitution of -- I'll state it in a\ndeclaration. The constitution of the State of South\nCarolina reflects the same principle reflected in the\nAppropriations Clause. We have two sister sovereigns,\nboth of them organized on the same fundamental principle\nthat only the people have the right to levy on the public\ntreasury, and only the people through their elected\nrepresentatives, and only the people have the right to\nspend, and therefore only the people have the right to\ntax.\nQUESTION: Mr. Dean --\nMR. DEAN: Now, you have these two comparable\nconstitutions. How do you put them together and violate\nthat principle?\nQUESTION: Mr. Dean --\nMR. DEAN: I don't know the answer to that\nquestion, Justice Stevens.\nQUESTION: -- you recognized a case called Ex\nparte Young, and let's say that the private complainant\nsays, okay, I'm not going to sue the State court\nauthorities. I'm going to sue the commissioners, and so\nas the FMC to please substitute for the entity the\nindividual commissioners, and they said go ahead, and they\ndon't have sovereign -- individuals, at least with respect\nto prospective relief do not have sovereign immunity.\nWhy couldn't -- is that then just a matter of\namending a complaint to name different parties?\nMR. DEAN: That suit belongs in Federal court,\nand I doubt very seriously that the commission has that\nstatutory jurisdiction. The reason is that it has\njurisdiction over persons engaged in the business of\noperating, or internal operators. I very sincerely doubt\nthat any individual employee would satisfy that test, but\nthe test certainly exists under Ex parte Young.\nThe opportunity might exist, except for the fact\nthat the proper way for the individual to proceed in this\nparticular case would be to file a declaratory judgment\nunder State law, which is available, to obtain the relief\nthe individual requested.\nQUESTION: But you haven't answered the\nquestion --\nMR. DEAN: I'm sorry, Justice --\nQUESTION: -- why couldn't the FMC say --\nMR. DEAN: I don't believe the Shipping Act\ngives the FMC jurisdiction over individuals who are\nemployees of entities that are engaged in --\nQUESTION: Not employees, the commissioners\nthemselves, the members of the State body.\nMR. DEAN: The officers of the -- I don't\nbelieve the Shipping Act gives the FMC jurisdiction over\nofficers of entities that it regulates. I don't believe\nit has that kind of personal jurisdiction, Your Honor.\nThat issue has not -- I am not aware that that issue has\ndecided, but I frankly have grave doubts that it would.\nQUESTION: But if that matter were clarified so\nthat Congress, wanting the FMC to have this third way of\nregulating said, in the case where State agencies are\ninvolved you can sue the individuals, individuals who\ncompose the entity --\nMR. DEAN: Well, the proper way for the Federal\nMaritime -- as I said, I don't think the FMC has that\njurisdiction. It does have jurisdiction over us. All it\nhas to do is initiate its own complaint. When the ALJ\ndismissed the complaint in this case, he invited the\ncommission, if the commission deemed the case had merit,\nsatisfying the test in Alden, he invited the commission to\ninitiate a proceeding through its own Enforcement Bureau.\nThe commission did not do so. Instead, they reversed the\nALJ's order, which is in turn reversed by the Fourth\nCircuit.\nThe parties in this, the Federal parties in this\ncase do not challenge the holdings of this case in\nNichols, Hans, Sherwood, Alden, or Seminole, so in effect\nwhat they're asking this Court to decide is the following\nthree propositions, and all of the following three\npropositions: that lesser tribunals established under\nArticle I have powers that both State and Federal courts\nlack, even though they constitutionally may adjudicate\nonly subject to the supervision of the latter; 2) that\nCongress, merely by assigning a private cause of action to\nadministrative tribunal, acquires and exercises power it\ndoes not otherwise have to abrogate State sovereign\nimmunity, thereby bypassing this Court's sovereign\nimmunity jurisprudence, and 3) that States lack the\nreciprocal right to assert sovereign immunity in Federal\nfora where the immunity of the United States clearly\napplies.\nQUESTION: Well, you really don't need your\nthird argument, do you, that the State sovereign immunity\nis co-extensive with Federal sovereign immunity?\nMR. DEAN: I don't need that third argument, Mr.\nChief Justice, that's quite correct, but what the United\nStates asserts, says about administrative proceedings, if\nthey were purely executive action -- for example, if it\nwas purely an executive branch matter, this -- the United\nStates has come into this Court on numerous occasions most\nrecently in Artistani and West, and asked this Court to\nintervene in what they now say is a purely executive\nbranch matter.\nThere was no inquiry. There was no special\nanalysis that the court did to determine whether or not\nthe intervention in that kind of purely executive branch\nmatter was warranted. There was no discussion of that.\nThe court assumed that the doctrine of sovereign immunity\nas it applied to the Federal Government applied to it, and\nI might add that --\nQUESTION: Oh, what is the boundary? Apparently\nyou're now talking about a principle of state sovereign\nimmunity outside the scope of Amendment 11 of the United\nStates Constitution, and I haven't really heard of that\none. I'm not saying it doesn't exist, but where do I go\nto discover what its bounds are, to discover what the\nimplications are, to discover if it applies when the\nPresident does anything? I mean, I don't know what the\nscope of that one is, so where do I go to find out about\nthat?\nMR. DEAN: If the President does something and\nthe President --\nQUESTION: No, I'm just asking -- my question\nis --\nMR. DEAN: Hans -- Hans v. Louisiana is the only\nplace you need to go.\nQUESTION: In other words, Hans you say is\noutside the scope of the Eleventh Amendment.\nMR. DEAN: By its terms it held it was outside\nthe scope of the Eleventh Amendment.\nQUESTION: All right, so Hans does not have to\ndo with the Eleventh Amendment.\nMR. DEAN: It does not by its terms have\nanything to do --\nQUESTION: Okay, it does not.\nMR. DEAN: -- it reflects the --\nQUESTION: Then how do I discover the scope of\nthis principle of State sovereign immunity outside the\nEleventh Amendment?\nMR. DEAN: Well, the same way you discover the\nprinciple of Federal sovereign immunity. You look at what\nthe nature of the proceeding, and the nature of the\naffront to the dignity of the sovereign is being involved,\nyou identify what the sovereign's interests are, and in\nthis particular case, in the money judgment it violates\nthe same clause of our constitution that it violates in\nthe case of the Federal Constitution, and that's pretty\npersuasive.\nQUESTION: But as I understand your argument,\nit's not limited to the reparations part of the case.\nThere's --\nMR. DEAN: No.\nQUESTION: -- also a request for a cease and\ndesist order.\nMR. DEAN: Although I might add, Justice\nStevens --\nQUESTION: You don't really need the reparations\nfor your position.\nMR. DEAN: -- that the pure participation in\nthis lengthy proceeding has had consequences for the\nTreasury of the State of South Carolina, but nonetheless,\nit's much broader than that, yes, Your Honor. It goes to\nthe nature -- as this Court held in Seminole, and I might\nadd, when I was -- when we argued the case before the\nFourth Circuit we had a little discussion about whether or\nnot the State of South Carolina was willing to be a\nscofflaw.\nIn other words, whether we were willing to have\nour -- to have allegations, whether they be frivolous or\nserious, against us go unanswered in an administrative\ntribunal that concededly regulates us in Washington and\nhave as the United States maintains this become a\nprecedent that would affect their dealing with us in the\nfuture without defending ourselves, and that's simply not\na realistic option for the State of South Carolina.\nIt's not a realistic option for anyone, much\nless a sovereign. If there's anything to dignity, there's\na dignity to that, to be able to defend yourself against\nallegations and not have people who are decisionmakers\nmake judgments against you --\nQUESTION: But let me just --\nMR. DEAN: -- based on unanswered allegations,\nor unanswerable allegations.\nQUESTION: May I interrupt you for just a\nmoment, please?\nMR. DEAN: Justice Stevens.\nQUESTION: Let's put the reparations to one\nside, and let's assume you're dead right on the monetary\naspect of the case. Is it your position that it would be\nin everyone's best interest to have proceedings like this\ninitiated ex parte, and then the agency makes up its mind\nwhether to go -- bring an enforcement proceeding, or it\nwould be better to have a formal proceeding where you\nhave a chance to respond to the charges and so forth?\nMR. DEAN: No, it's far better, Justice Stevens,\nto have a person come to the agency, present its concerns\nto the agency, and the agency approach the State of South\nCarolina, one sovereign to another sovereign.\nThis case involves the regulation of gaming\nships. The Congress has committed that to our discretion\nunder State law. We are given that right. The Johnson\nAct, which gave us the right to regulate gaming ships,\ndoes not say that it's subject to review by the Federal\nMaritime Commission. It does not say, for example that\nthe Federal Maritime Commission --\nQUESTION: No, but if you have --\nMR. DEAN: -- has the right to preempt the\nCongress.\nQUESTION: If you have an issue such as this in\nwhich the agency thinks there's a colorable basis for a\nproceeding, do you think the only way they can proceed\nagainst you formally is to first of all get all the\ninformation ex parte from the private parties, and then\nmake up their own mind as to whether to bring a formal\nproceeding in the name of the agency?\nMR. DEAN: Just like the Department of Justice\ndoes when it enforces the laws against the States, yes,\nYour Honor, that is the proper way of doing it, because we\ncan and will address those allegations at that time, but I\ncan assure you that the -- this case implements policies\nof the State of South Carolina that are important to it,\nthe regulation of gaming ships, the Johnson Act Congress\nhas said it's up to the State of South Carolina to make\nthose policies and to implement those policies --\nQUESTION: Well, but the Johnson Act certainly\ndidn't say that South Carolina was exempt from the\nrequirement of the Shipping Act, that it not discriminate.\nMR. DEAN: No, but I can -- that's correct, but\nin -- any regulatory system has at its core the right to\nmake discretionary, discriminatory judgments about what\ndoes and does not comply with the policies of that regime.\nQUESTION: Well --\nMR. DEAN: And the FMC is now sitting in\njudge -- as a judge of the -- of our implementation of\nState law as authorized by the Johnson Act.\nQUESTION: Well, certainly you're not suggesting\nthat the Shipping Act in its prohibition against\ndiscrimination can't be applied to South Carolina other\nthan on a sovereign immunity basis, are you?\nMR. DEAN: No, we're not, but what we're saying\nis that if they exercise the executive discretion that\nthey ought to act, that the Constitution envisions them\nenacting, that they would approach us as a sovereign, we'd\nsay, these are our sovereign interests, they'd say, they\nare their sovereign interests --\nQUESTION: Well, yes, but --\nMR. DEAN: -- ultimately they would trump ours,\nif there was a disagreement --\nQUESTION: Yes. In 1787 we adopted a\nConstitution so they didn't have to approach one another\nas sovereign to sovereign any more.\nMR. DEAN: That's true, but in this particular\narea the Congress has decided that the sovereign State of\nSouth Carolina gets to do the regulating, Mr. Chief\nJustice, so we would come down and we would have two\ndifferent regulatory regimes, and we would approach each\nother, and we would resolve the differences between them,\nand if they disagreed, if ultimately they disagree, they\ncould bring a complaint against us, which they have the\nright to do, and we would defend it, and we would\nparticipate. We would have the opportunity to defend\nourselves, and we would defend ourselves, and so that's --\nQUESTION: It would not be, perhaps, as\nintellectually satisfying as resolving the case\nspecifically on the merits. Is it open to us to say that\nthere's no clear statement that waives sovereign immunity,\nas we did in Vermont Yankee?\nMR. DEAN: There is no statement that waives\nsovereign immunity. I think that's been conceded in the\nproceedings below. There's no waiver of sovereign\nimmunity in this case. Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: But there's no clear statement by the\nCongress of the United States intending abrogate --\nMR. DEAN: Oh, no, clearly not. There's no\nmention in the Shipping Act at all of intention to waive\nState sovereign immunity. I can't find a mention in the\nShipping Act of intention to waive Federal sovereign\nimmunity if and when the Federal Government ever wants to\nget into the business of operating ports. It operates two\nairports in the Washington area, so I don't think it's\ninconceivable that it might do so at some point, but it is\nclearly -- it is clearly no waiver of sovereign immunity,\neven if -- even going back to the law where it said the\nCongress could waive the sovereign immunity of the United\nStates, of the States, I'm sorry, there is no evidence of\nany intent whatsoever in the Shipping Act to do that.\nThe fact that the Federal Maritime Commission\nmay bring its own actions against the United States --\nagainst the States as it did in the California case proves\nthe opposite proposition, that the Congress, that was the\nproper way to proceed, and I think that is the proper way\nto proceed.\nThe -- I'd like to go back to -- this complaint\nis a verified private complaint. It is -- calls for\nreparations in the broadest form of reparations, including\nconsequential damages, interest and attorney's fees, the\ncommission has no discretion in the handling of this\ncomplaint, it's required by law to adjudicate it, and the\nagency's findings become final subject only to judicial\nreview.\nThis is precisely the kind of anomalous\nproceeding suit that the Court had in mind in Hans, and\nHans came 30 years after --\nQUESTION: But only to the extent they're\nseeking a money judgment.\nMR. DEAN: No, Your Honor, I think the sovereign\nimmunity --\nQUESTION: Well, Hans was purely a money\njudgment.\nMR. DEAN: Yes, but they held that the Court\nwas -- they held the State immune from the proceeding.\nObviously, the proceeding had already been completed, but\nI think it's fairly clear now that the dignity of the\nsovereign entails to the entire proceeding, applies to the\nentire proceeding, but you know, this question about the\ndignity of the sovereign, the Court in Hans gave us some\ninstructions, some future instructions --\nQUESTION: But Hans was a court case.\nMR. DEAN: Hans is a court case.\nQUESTION: Well, I mean, it's not a case, then,\nin which they say it's not the judicial power --\nMR. DEAN: Just like Federal sovereign immunity\nis a court case.\nQUESTION: And why is it a case in which they\nsay -- isn't it -- I mean, I'm back on my judicial --\nforget it, I'm sorry.\nMR. DEAN: My time is up.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Dean.\nMR. DEAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nQUESTION: Mr. Hughey, you have 3 minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PHILLIP C. HUGHEY\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER FEDERAL MARITIME COMMISSION\nMR. HUGHEY: If I could keep going with your\ninquiry, Justice Breyer, I think we are suggesting that\nthere is a line in this case, and that line is Freytag v.\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue. We're not suggesting\nthat State instrumentalities would never have sovereign\nimmunity in administrative proceedings. Rather, we're\nsuggesting that they might in proceedings in which\ncontempt power can be exercised, and this is not one such\nproceeding. This agency doesn't have coercive authority\nover the entities that it regulates. It has to rely on a\nFederal district court for that.\nTo make another point, I think Mr. Dean\nemphasized that the Shipping Act allows the agency to fine\ninstrumentalities that don't comply with its order.\nHowever, I should point out that in this case the\ncommission has never indicated that it has the authority\nto fine a State instrumentality for not complying with a\nreparation order. That was something that ended up in the\nFourth Circuit's opinion. We've never said we could do\nit, and the United States in its reply brief to this Court\nhas specifically expressed the view that the FMC could not\nfine a State-run court for not complying with the agency-\nissued reparation order.\nAnd finally, with respect to the issue of\nwhether and when the agency's Bureau of Enforcement can\nintervene in an agency proceeding, I should point out that\nwhether or not the Bureau of Enforcement intervenes in the\nadjudication does not get to the point of whether it is an\nagency action, because the agency always retains the\nability to review, sua sponte, any administrative law\njudge order that comes out.\nQUESTION: Why is it that you cannot fine the\nState?\nMR. HUGHEY: I think the United States has\nsuggested that because the commission and the Attorney\nGeneral don't have the authority to enforce a reparation\norder against a State, that the authority to fine the\nState for not complying with that reparation order would\nnot be an appropriate interpretation of the Shipping Act.\nAgain, that's something, the commission has\nnever said that it has the authority to, or that it would\nfine a State for not complying with an agency-issued\nreparation order.\nQUESTION: Could the commission substitute the\ncommissioners of the South Carolina Ports Authority for\nthe port authority itself?\nMR. HUGHEY: I'm unsure of that, Justice\nGinsburg, but we would suggest that the pleading\nrequirements of Ex parte Young need not be imported into\nthe Shipping Act, and that a request for, for example, a\ncease and desist order against the ports authority would,\nunder the Shipping Act, be sufficient, and that the\ncomplaint need not name the commissioners of the ports\nauthority themselves.\nThank you -- oh, sorry.\nQUESTION: I think what Justice Ginsburg's\nquestion went to, you're saying you don't have to name the\nindividuals, but suppose that we held that you couldn't\nname the State, do you think you have authority to name\nthe individuals?\nMR. HUGHEY: I'm unsure of that, Justice Scalia.\nThe Shipping Act provides that complaints must be filed\nagainst persons. I think the question would be rather\nwhether the port commissioners are persons. It may be\nthat a fiction could be conceived that they would be under\nthe Shipping Act, but again, that issue has never come up\nin the commission's administration of the statute.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Hughey.\n"
