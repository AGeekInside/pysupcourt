MAHONEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe complaint in this case actually alleges\nthat Domino's breached its obligations under a contract\nwith JWM. It does not allege that any of the terms of\nMcDonald's own contracts were violated.\nThe Ninth Circuit, nevertheless, held that\nMr. McDonald could recover damages so long as he could\nshow that he had suffered some distinct injury arising\nout of the violation of the contract between his\ncompany and Domino's.\nWe -- we ask this Court to reverse that\nholding for two principal reasons.\nFirst, Mr. McDonald did not hold any rights\nunder the contracts between his company JWM and\nDomino's, and that's disqualifying under section 1981.\nSecond, the injuries that he alleges are\nsimply too indirect to be cognizable under an implied\nright of action. This Court, even in the context of\nexpress rights of action, whether RICO or the Clayton\nAct, has looked to the background principles of the\ncommon law to define the scope of a damage recovery.\nAnd these kinds of injuries, which are really the\nclassic form of derivative injury, have never been\nrecoverable.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can -- can you tell me, Ms.\nMahoney, just in -- in a case where the person is\ndirectly implicated -- he was the one discriminated\nagainst. He obtains in a suit the damages for the loss\nof the profits in the contract. What are the other\ndamages? Does he get emotional distress?\nMS. MAHONEY: If -- if he's -- yes, you can\nget emotional distressed under section 1981, and --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: If -- if you're\ncontracting for yourself --\nMS. MAHONEY: That's correct.\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- in your own behalf.\nMS. MAHONEY: Absolutely. There is no\nstandalone cause of action under Federal law simply for\nemotional distress that is suffered as a result of\nracially discriminatory conduct. Presumably Congress,\nyou know, might do that some day, but it has not done\nso. And in fact, even under title VII, racially\ndisparaging comments can cause distress to a worker and\nthey're still not actionable unless it rises to the\nlevel of a hostile work environment.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And what was the\nplaintiff's -- it wasn't here. What kind of damages\nwas he asking for?\nMS. MAHONEY: He is asking -- it's -- it's --\nthe complaint is a little unclear, but he's asking for\nlosses that arise out of the company's failure to have\nrevenues that would have passed through the company to\nhim in either his capacity as a shareholder or possibly\nas an employee. In fact, it's important to stress how\nindirect these injuries really are. The gravamen --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I thought they were --\nthey were essentially, as I guess you said a moment\nago, emotional distress kinds of injuries because\notherwise he'd be claiming a double recovery. So he\ndoesn't do that because they -- they settled the\ncontract case with the corporation for what? $46,000?\nMS. MAHONEY: $45,000, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So -- so that the only thing\nhe -- he's not claiming an economic injury, as I\nunderstand it, or am I wrong?\nMS. MAHONEY: I think you're wrong, Your\nHonor. He actually in his complaint asked for economic\ndamages. He doesn't specify them, but in an affidavit\nthat he submitted to the district court, he said that\nhis net worth had declined 8 million dollars and he is\nsaying that he --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But I -- I guess that's\nwhere I went wrong. I thought those were the reasons\nthat he was claiming that he had been distressed\nemotionally.\nMS. MAHONEY: I don't think so, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But you're -- you're saying\nhe wants the --\nMS. MAHONEY: But either way, the outcome\nshould be the same because emotional distress is not a\nstandalone claim. He has to establish that he had\nrights to make and enforce a contract that were\nviolated, and even if he did that, he still has to show\nthat the damages that -- that were caused by Domino's\nwere sufficiently direct to be cognizable.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if you have a --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What -- what he's saying\nis treat me as a sole proprietor. Yes, I created this\ncorporation so I can be insulated from liability, but\nthis is a one-person show and so I am bringing a 1981\nclaim and say forget the corporation. I'm the only\nhuman that's involved in this activity.\nMS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, I think there's a\ncouple of problems with that. I mean, first of all,\nthese were contracts where Domino's had rights under\nthese contracts as well, and if it had sued Mr.\nMcDonald under the terms of the contract for failing to\nperform, he would have rightly said, that's not my\ncontract.\nAnd I don't think that we can think that\nCongress intended this Court to simply disregard those\nprinciples that have always governed where you -- if\nyou take the benefits of avoiding liability, you can't\nturn around and say, well, now that it's time to\nrecover against Domino's, it is my contract. That's\nnot the way the law works. He can't disown the -- the\nforce of the law when he's taken the benefits of the\nlaw.\nAnd now, the burden here is really a moderate\none. It's one that says that the recovery that is owed\nwill come through the corporate entity. He will get\nwhatever his share of that is through the -- the\ncorporate processes, and he won't be able to have an\nindependent claim for emotional distress. But --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, what if you\nhave a case where a company says we are not going to\ndeal with any companies that have an African American\nas the CEO? Couldn't that CEO, the individual, claim\nthat that policy interferes with his ability to make\ncontracts with his company to be the CEO?\nMS. MAHONEY: Well --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And shouldn't he then\nhave a right to bring a claim under section 1981?\nMS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, if his company\nfired him because he couldn't make contracts -- in\nother words, they said, we -- we don't want you to be\nour CEO. We don't want a black CEO because, after all,\nwe're going to lose business with these other companies\n-- then I think under an interference theory, that he\nprobably could sue under 1981, sue both his company and\nalso the third party that induced the interference.\nIf we look to common law principles, the\ncommon law of tortious interference established various\nrules that were designed to provide recovery for\ninterference when the causation was sufficiently\ndirect, and the common law says -- this is section 766\nof the Restatement and cases that follow that -- that,\nin essence, if the third party -- or if the defendant\ninduces the breach, essentially, you know, tells them,\nthis is how we want it done, we want you to fire so and\nso if you want our business, if they induce the breach\nor induce the violation, then they can be liable as\nwell.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose that McDonald had\nhad a contract with the corporation that he gets 80\npercent of the gross from every contract. Could he\nthen sue?\nMS. MAHONEY: No, Your Honor. There are two\ndifferent things. I mean, one -- one part of it is\nthat here his -- he doesn't say that his contract\nwasn't performed, but he also would have to show that\nDomino's was the direct cause of his loss. And the\ncommon law, under section 766, for instance, says,\nlook, if a -- if a third party or if the defendant just\nmade it more difficult for your employer to perform or\nfor your company to meet its obligations, its\ncontractual obligations, by causing it to have less\nmoney, that doesn't count. That's not inducing a\nbreach.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but -- but in this\ncase, it's pretty obvious they didn't care about the\ncorporation. They cared about him. He was the target.\nMS. MAHONEY: Well, he may have been the\nreason for the discrimination, but the target, in terms\nof the direct victim of the conduct that is alleged,\nwas clearly JWM. It's JWM whose contracts were\nsupposedly breached.\nAnd -- and the point is, Your Honor, the --\nthe law has made it clear that simply breaching a\ncontract in a manner that makes it more difficult for\nsomebody else to perform is not a sufficiently direct\ncause of the -- of the failure to perform all of the\nsucceeding downstream contracts. Otherwise, the -- the\nrules of privity would simply be eroded. And so instead,\nit's a very narrow category of cases where a breach of\ncontract can be viewed as the direct cause of another\nparty's failure to perform a separate contract with the\nplaintiff.\nAnd let me give you an example, just to -- to\nshow what it's talking about. If, for instance, there\nis a contract where I am the defendant and I have the\nright to approve an assignment, and the plaintiff has a\ncontract with a third party and I refuse to approve\nthat assignment. Then I have retained the legal\ncontrol under the terms of my contract as to whether\nthe plaintiff's contract can be performed or not. And\nin that circumstance, if -- if I deny approval on the\nbasis of race, I have made it literally impossible for\nthe other parties to perform.\nAnd that's the -- the narrow exception. It's\neither inducing the breach, inducing the breach of a\ncontract, or it's making it literally impossible, but\nnot simply making it more expensive or more difficult.\nAnd -- and I think it's important to\nemphasize why these rules were developed under the\ncommon law this way. In -- in part, it is to protect\nthe very reasonable and legitimate interests of -- of\ninnocent third parties. In -- in -- take the corporate\ncontext. If General Motors has a dispute with a major\ncustomer, and imagine that there is some sense that\nthat -- that the customer may have breached its\ncontracts because it -- it thought GM's work force had\ntoo many black faces, GM has got to figure out what to\ndo about that. It's not going to capitulate and fire\nits work force, but it has to decide whether it wants\nto settle, whether it wants to litigate. It may\nlitigate and then want to settle. But that's its\nclaim, its contract claim, and it has to have the\nfreedom to figure out how it ought to be settled.\nIf every black employee at GM could file an\naction under section 1981 for emotional distress or for\nwage increases that they might not have gotten because\nGM lost this big piece of business, then GM would lose\nthe ability to control the settlement of its own claim.\nAnd so -- and it's an innocent party in this fact\npattern.\nSo the law has been designed under -- under\nthe common law to make sure that everybody's interests\nare sufficiently protected.\nAnd what the Ninth Circuit's, you know,\nruling does here and what the plaintiffs are really\nasking for is to just blow through all of those rules\nthat -- that have been designed to -- to make sense out\nof contracts -- contract laws and still allow some room\nfor tortious interference sorts of principles. And\nunder -- under the Court's cases, I don't think there\nis any basis to think that Congress intended the Court\nto create an implied right of action that is completely\ndivorced from the common law principles that would have\nforeclosed these kinds of remedies.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there any --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Did you say there is or --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- are there any cases\nwhere we pierced the corporate veil in order to help\nthe shareholder?\nMS. MAHONEY: Not that I know of, Your Honor.\nAnd I --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: This is kind of an inverse\n--\nMS. MAHONEY: Yes, inverse -- reverse\npiercing.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- corporate veil piercing.\nMS. MAHONEY: Not that I know of, and I don't\n-- and I -- I think if you did that, would you do it\nfor employees too? Can all the employees sue? I mean,\nwhere -- where does it stop? Can -- if Domino's\nviolated a term of a contract because it was -- it\nwanted to cause economic loss to the employee of a\nsubcontractor, can -- can he then sue?\nI mean, looking at the theory of damage in\nthis case shows just how indirect it is. If you look\nat paragraphs 24 through 27 of the complaint, the sole\ntheory of harm here is that Domino's had an obligation\nto provide a letter to -- to JWM, certifying that JWM\nwasn't in breach of any terms of the lease, and that it\nrefused to provide that letter, and when it did so, the\nbank denied some financing on a project, and then that\ncaused JWM not to have money to invest in other\nprojects. And so then it didn't have enough money to\npay its creditors, and so then it went into -- had to\ndeclare Chapter XI bankruptcy. And then McDonald\ndidn't get as much money from the corporation as he\notherwise would have.\nJUSTICE BREYER: There are two separate\narguments here, and I'm trying to separate them. I\nguess that many States have a doctrine in two areas of\nlaw. Third party beneficiaries can sometimes recover;\nsometimes they can't. Victims of efforts to interfere\nwith a contract sometimes recover; sometimes they\ncan't. And one question is whether this particular\nindividual fits within those doctrines. And you have\nto be an expert on contract law to know.\nBut in respect to the civil rights law, I\nguess your position is -- and this is what I want to\nknow -- that whatever those doctrines are, they have to\nbe the same for white people as for black people.\nMS. MAHONEY: I think the language of the\nstatute says that it's protecting the -- the right of\nall -- the same right to make and enforce --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Right. So -- so it might apply.\nAnd one thing you couldn't do if you're a State is have a\ndifferent rule for black people that treated them worse\nthan white people.\nMS. MAHONEY: I think that's correct, Your\nHonor, but --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. And has there\never been a case in respect, whether it's affirmative\naction or some other thing, that interprets that --\nthat -- this particular civil rights statute to say\nthat for whatever historical reasons, et cetera, black\npeople are entitled to more protection under contract\nlaw than white?\nMS. MAHONEY: Not that I can think of, Your\nHonor. And I think the language of this statute,\nthough -- I mean, certainly though -- of course, the\nCourt in McDonald did interpret this statute to -- to\nalso protect white person -- white -- white people,\npeople of all color, despite the language that says,\nyou know, rights the same as -- as whites. But --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Do corporations have a\ncolor?\nMS. MAHONEY: No, they don't, Your Honor, but\nall of the courts of appeals have, in effect, imputed\nrace to corporations under circumstances where their --\ntheir contractual rights have been violated because of\nthe race of their shareholders or employees. And that\nhas been well-settled, at least in the courts of\nappeals.\nJUSTICE BREYER: So how do we deal with this?\nThat is to say, do I have to become an expert on\ncontract law, or do I say to the Ninth Circuit or the\ncircuit, look, the -- the question here is not what the\ncontract law is except insofar as it's relevant to\nwhether there's a differential in treatment?\nMS. MAHONEY: Well, Your Honor, I -- I don't\nthink you have to be an expert on contract law. I\nthink that this Court already held in Patterson, for\ninstance, that section 1981 was designed to have its\nown Federal content, but that when we look at the term,\nthe right to make and enforce contracts, certainly we\nhave to interpret that in light of common law rules.\nAnd under the common law of contracts, only parties and\nthird party beneficiaries have -- hold rights under\nthose contracts.\nUnder section 302 of the Restatement, it\ndefines who a third party beneficiary is, and I think\nthat's a good starting place. It shows us that\nchildren, you know, as in this Court's case in Runyon,\nare third party beneficiaries. Union members are third\nparty beneficiaries of collective bargaining agreements\nunder that -- under the comments in the Restatement.\nBut the plaintiff acknowledges that the shareholders\nand employees are not intended third party\nbeneficiaries of the contract.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, maybe not --\nmaybe not shareholders in general, but what if you have\na situation, like here, where you're dealing with sole\nshareholders? Why is that a real stretch to say that\nthat person is a third party beneficiary of the\ncontracts of his corporation?\nMS. MAHONEY: Well, the -- for two reasons.\nFirst, the contract has to actually identify third\nparty beneficiaries. In other words, parties need to\nagree on who the third -- on who the beneficiaries are\nsupposed to be. And here, of course, there's nothing\nin the contracts. They haven't alleged there's\nanything in the contracts to identify him as that.\nAnd also, if -- if --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There was nothing in\nthese contracts requiring anything in the way of\npersonal guarantees or anything of that sort?\nMS. MAHONEY: I don't believe so, Your Honor.\nIt's certainly not alleged in the complaint that there\nis a personal guarantee. And -- and I don't think so\nbecause when Domino's sued JWM, it did not sue Mr.\nMcDonald. And -- and as I say, if -- if they had, I'm\nsure Mr. McDonald would have put up his hand and said,\nno, thank you, that's not my contract.\nAnd I -- so I don't -- I think that really\nwhat we are asking the Court to do is just to look at\nthe language and -- and read it in light of these well-\nestablished principles because that's what Congress\nwould have intended the Court to do, and that he is not\na third party beneficiary. He is not a party. And so\nthe Ninth -- the rationale of the Ninth Circuit would\nneed to be reversed because that's all it relied upon.\nAnd then the alternative theory --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, but that's exactly\nwhat I'm asking. If -- if you win, this case is\nreversed, sent back. I mean, what do -- would I tell\nthem? And why not tell them, instead of having to\ndelve into this, is, look, it's plausible here that\nthird party beneficiary doctrine might cover this\nperson? It's also plausible not. We're not experts.\nWe don't know. You figure out what the normal rule is\nand apply that normal rule.\nMS. MAHONEY: Well, I don't think we need to\ndo that because there's been a concession in this case\nthat Mr. McDonald is not a third party beneficiary\nunder the normal rules and is asking, instead, that the\nCourt create new rules, rights greater than third --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, what about the other\npart of it, which is the -- the interference with the\ncontract? Could we say the same thing there? We send\nit back, say, look, we're not experts on this, it's a\nmatter of State law typically, and be absolutely sure,\nplease, that whatever doctrine you normally apply is\napplied to this case too because it's plausible. He's\nthe sole shareholder. He's the sole beneficiary.\nMS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, I -- I -- we would\nask that this Court not do that for two reasons, that\nthe alternative theory of tortious interference was\nnever pled. It was never argued, and the district\ncourt dismissed this complaint with prejudice because\nthere was no alternative theory. They did not move for\nleave to amend.\nSo I think this Court should say one of two\nthings about the alternative theory. Either, number\none, it is waived, or number two, based on the\narguments that have been advanced and the allegations\nof the complaint, it could not possibly be cognizable.\nAnd I -- I don't think you have to be an expert on\ninterference law in order to reach that conclusion\nbecause --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you saying this is a\nmatter of Federal contract law, common law, Federal\ncommon law, are -- or are you saying you go State by\nState, in which case 1981 is some places it will be\nthird party beneficiary, some it won't?\nMS. MAHONEY: I -- I think, Your Honor, that\nin -- in the prior cases, in Patterson in particular,\nthat the Court rejected the idea that it ought to be\nthe State -- the law of each State that governs the\nscope of the rights. That argument, I believe, was\nadvanced by the Solicitor General, and this Court said,\nno, they didn't think that was correct.\nAnd similarly, in Haddle v. Garrison, which\nis a section 1985 case, this Court looked to common\nlaw. But it -- it said that it's really Federal common\nlaw that controls these issues.\nSo I think it's looking just to -- to State\nlaw principles to inform what Congress may have had in\nmind when it -- it allowed for persons to recover for\nviolations of the rights to make and enforce contracts.\nHere --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But is it State law\ntoday or State law back when section 1981 was passed?\nMS. MAHONEY: This Court has looked to both,\nbut in Associated General -- Associated General\nContractors, for instance, this Court said that it's\nnot bound by the terms of common law that existed at\nthe time that the statute was adopted, and -- but\nrather, that common law evolves, and so it's\nappropriate to -- to look beyond that.\nI think it bears emphasis, though, that the\ncommon law of tortious interference at the time that\nthis statute was adopted in 1866 was narrower than it\nis today. But even under the broader views of tortious\ninterference, the plaintiffs concede that they would\nnot be able to recover under those theories, and\ninstead, have said to this Court 1981 should be -- go\nwell beyond the terms of common law interference\nprinciples.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, in a -- in a sense\nthis is stronger than some tortious interference claims\nbecause here the target is this -- this party.\nMS. MAHONEY: That's always true in tortious\ninterference claims, Your Honor, and --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You mean that -- that the\ninjured party has to be the target?\nMS. MAHONEY: Absolutely. The injured party\nhas to allege that the defendant knew about the\ncontract and specifically intended to interfere with\nthe performance of the plaintiff's contract. But,\nnevertheless, we know of no --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: To interfere but not\nnecessarily to injure him.\nMS. MAHONEY: And to injure. Well, to injure\nhim, to prevent his performance for -- for purposes of\ninjury, yes.\nAnd, nevertheless, we are aware of no case\nthat has ever found that an employee of a company or a\nshareholder of a company could recover under common law\ntortious interference theory simply because it suffered\nlosses arising out of a breach of contract with its own\ncorporation that made it more difficult or more\nexpensive for the corporation to recover.\nAnd I think it -- it is -- also bears\nemphasis of where this theory would take the Court if\nit were to recognize this. It would go far afield from\nthe core requirement that there not be discrimination\nin the terms of an employment contract because this --\nthe tortious interference theory, of course, is based\nsolely on the concept that he may have had some sort of\nimplied employment agreement with JWM.\nWhat this would mean then is that if -- in\nthe case of GM, if a major customer cancels a contract\nand GM doesn't give raises to its work force, all of\nthe black workers would have causes of action because\nof the injuries that were intended because the contract\nwas canceled on the basis of race, but their similarly\nsituated white coworkers would not. They would have\nsuffered exactly the same injury, but they would have\ncompletely different rights. And that shows why this\nderivative injury theory just doesn't fit section 1981\nbecause at its core, it has to be about preventing\ndiscrimination in the terms of the actual contract.\nAnd here, there is no allegation that JWM\nsubjected McDonald to any discriminatory terms of\nemployment, and therefore, it is not -- or that it -- a\nbreach was induced. And therefore, it isn't the\nparadigm case, and it would create problems down the\nroad to recognize this -- this kind of theory.\nSo I don't -- I don't think that we are\nasking the Court to do anything radical, and I think\nthe whole issue of tortious interference can be\navoided, if the Court would prefer, because the -- the\ntheory was unquestionably waived.\nThere are 14 paragraphs of facts in this\ncomplaint laying out the factual allegations.\nParagraph 11 says that Mr. McDonald is the president,\nsole shareholder, and operator of the company. Nowhere\nin those 14 paragraphs does it say that he had an\nemployment contract with JWM.\nSimilarly, the cause of action paragraphs --\nI believe there are 15 of them -- repeatedly identify\nthe contract between Domino's and JWM as the contract\nat issue, the contract that was breached, the terms\nthat were violated. Nowhere does it refer to an\nemployment contract.\nThis complaint, as the district court\nrecognized, only pled one theory, and that was the\ntheory that Mr. McDonald was entitled to enforce the\nrights of JWM. It does not plead any theory about\nviolations of his own employment contract. And as I\nsaid, that -- even if -- even if you could infer it,\nyou would still have to find that it's not a cognizable\ntheory because he doesn't allege that the terms of that\ncontract were actually violated. And in fact, at page\n45 of his brief -- or 44, he concedes that JWM did\nperform the terms of the contract. And second, even if\nthere had been a failure of performance, he cannot show\nthat Domino's was a sufficiently direct cause of that\nfailure of performance.\nJust -- just to give, you know, yet another\nexample, I mean, if I -- if my employer has a -- a bad\nyear this year because somebody breached a contract\nwith the employer and I don't get a bonus, I -- you\nknow, I may say I've suffered some -- some loss. The\nvalue of my contract, my employment contract, may be\nreduced, but my rights under that contract have not\nbeen impaired or abrogated. I have the same rights.\nThey're just worth something less.\nAnd all that this statute does is to protect\nrights, the same rights as white people have. It\ndoesn't say that you are protected from any kind of\ndiscriminatory conduct in the economy that may, in some\nsense, make your rights less valuable.\nI'd like to save the remainder of my time for\nrebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Lichtenstein.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLEN LICHTENSTEIN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. LICHTENSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nThe issue here is whether, by choosing to\noperate as a solely owned corporation, John McDonald\nforfeited his 1981 protection.\nRather than federalizing State contract law,\nsection 1981 imposes a nonnegotiable nondiscrimination\nduty that is neither a contractual provision nor\ngoverned by contract law. Intentional racial\ndiscrimination is not merely a breach of contract\nterms. As this Court has already noticed -- noted, it\nis more akin to a tort.\nDomino's question presented asks that both\nplaintiff and defendant had to be parties to the\ncontract. Yet, Domino's notes that non-parties without\nprivy of contract are also protected, citing third\nparty beneficiaries and the fact there were employers,\nsuch as supervisory employees or prime contractors.\nThus, even Domino's concedes that the answer to the\nquestion presented is no. Section 1981 protection is\nnot limited to parties to the contract.\nThere's still, however, the remaining\nquestion of whether John McDonald fits within the\nstatute's protection. Clearly, if he had been a sole\nproprietor, there would be no question of stating a\ncause of action. We contend that he's still protected\nbased on three grounds: one, the intended language of\nsection 1981; two, John McDonald's relationship with\nDomino's; and three, John McDonald's relationship with\nJWM.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, let's take that\nlast one first, if you don't mind, since the argument\nis that you've waived that argument by not -- not\nraising it below.\nMR. LICHTENSTEIN: Well, we believe that it\nhas been sufficiently raised below. 1981 does not have\nany special or enhanced pleading requirements. This is\nnotice --\nJUSTICE O'CONNOR: Where in the complaint\ndoes it allege a tortious interference claim?\nMR. LICHTENSTEIN: It doesn't allege a\ntortious interference claim, and this really isn't a\ntortious interference claim as petitioners suggest.\nThis is a 1981 discrimination claim, and very clearly\nthat was alleged.\nIn terms of the requirement for wages, back\nwages and front wages, that is on -- I believe it's\npage 17.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. The --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- the allegation I'm\nlooking for -- and I -- I guess you probably didn't --\nyou didn't have to raise it below, given the state of\nthe Ninth Circuit law I would suppose. But in your\nbrief in opposition, where is it raised that this\ninterferes with the contract between you and -- between\nMcDonald and JWM?\nMR. LICHTENSTEIN: I don't think it does\nappear there specifically. But again, the -- the\nquestion was a fairly narrow one, which is what is\nNinth Circuit law? Does Gomez apply? And it went up\nto the Ninth Circuit on that particular level.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But coming here, I\nwould have thought our rules say that if you're going\nto rely on this as a ground for affirmance here, we\nshould see it in the brief in opposition.\nMR. LICHTENSTEIN: The brief in opposition at\nthe Ninth Circuit you're referring to or --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Here.\nMR. LICHTENSTEIN: -- this brief? The\nallegations concerning our argument about --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Brief in opposition to the\npetition for certiorari. You -- you did not raise\nthis.\nMR. LICHTENSTEIN: They did not raise that --\nthat does not appear there.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So -- it's -- it's brand new\nto us. We -- we didn't think this was in the case at\nall.\nMR. LICHTENSTEIN: Well, again, I think that\nif the issue is whether it was raised below or should\nbe, then perhaps a remand back to flesh out that\nparticular argument would be the appropriate response.\nI think that in terms of --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It wouldn't just be an\nargument. You'd have to amend your complaint because\nit wasn't set out in the complaint.\nMR. LICHTENSTEIN: If the Court believes that\nit more specifically needs to be set out in the\ncomplaint, then clearly that would be one of the\nremedies. We don't really believe that that is\nnecessary in a sense when dealing with the question\npresented. Both of our arguments are really sort of\nformulations of the same argument. The question is did\nDomino's actions aim at John McDonald? Was he the\nprecise target? That was clearly set out, and --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is targeted enough? I mean,\nI'm thinking here not necessarily your case, but in\ngeneral. Is a claim of discrimination -- I don't know\nthe state of the law, but maybe if a minority\nshareholder -- a minority person is the sole\nshareholder of a corporation, maybe that corporation\ncould assert protection, or maybe it couldn't.\nBut here, I take it that the corporation JWM\nbrought an action and won or settled for $45,000. So\nthey're out of it.\nNow we're just thinking about the sole\nshareholder, and the sole shareholder says there's\nanother action here. And as to the two most plausible\nones that I would like to assert an action as a third\nparty beneficiary, we've heard the other side say that\nyou've conceded you have no right there. And as to the\nother one, which might be protected in many cases, that\nthe -- knowing that what was going to happen, they\ndeliberately interfered with the contractual relation\nbetween me and the corporation. That's what we're\nasking about now. And you say, well, I didn't raise\nthat.\nNow, is there a reason you should be given an\nopportunity to raise it?\nMR. LICHTENSTEIN: I believe that the\nopportunity to raise that is part of the -- the same\nargument. This isn't really a question of third party\nbeneficiary. This is an issue of --\nJUSTICE BREYER: You conceded that out.\nMR. LICHTENSTEIN: -- discrimination and this\nwas claimed in terms of discrimination. If in fleshing\nthis out, it was not specified in the various ways that\nthis discrimination was affected, that oversight\nshouldn't preclude the basic argument that is really\nthe same --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Because?\nMR. LICHTENSTEIN: Because it still is\nresponsive to the question presented, which is, is the\nprivity issue one that precludes recovery from John\nMcDonald? And that seems to be the same issue,\nregardless -- regardless of how it's formulated. And\nthe answer to that question I think is -- is clearly no\nin terms of the tort -- tortious behavior by the -- by\nDomino's in terms of the discrimination. It is not --\nalso, the damages that are --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. I -- I thought\nthe question presented -- I didn't think. I'm reading\nit from the petition for writ of certiorari. In the\nabsence of a contractual relationship with the\ndefendant, are allegations of personal injuries alone\nsufficient to confer standing on a plaintiff pursuant\nto 42 U.S.C., section 1981? So, I mean, the question\npresented was -- was precisely if your client did not\nhave a contractual relationship, would the mere\nallegation of personal injury, which you're now\nalleging, be enough to confer standing?\nMR. LICHTENSTEIN: Well, it's -- the\nallegation of both -- well, discrimination is a\npersonal injury. In Goodman, this Court has said that\nviolation of section 1981 is a personal injury. It's\nnot a contract injury. So the question presented --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, the question is -- I\nmean, that begs the question, whether there has been a\nviolation of section 1981, and the argument here is\nthat there's no violation of section 1981 unless you're\ninterfering with a contract of the plaintiff.\nMR. LICHTENSTEIN: And the response of the --\nof the respondent is it is not simply your own contract\nor your contract with the defendant that is subject to\n1981 protection. There are several instances -- and\nwe've cited them in our brief -- such as Shaare Tefila\nand Runyon -- where the actual target of the\ndiscrimination is not in contractual privity with the\ndefendant. And --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Are you referring to\nRunyon, for instance? The parents always had a special\nrelation to the child. It's something of a stretch to\nsay that the corporation has that same relation with\nits own shareholder.\nMR. LICHTENSTEIN: I think in this particular\ncase it isn't a stretch. The discrimination was aimed\nat John McDonald. It was not --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That might --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: There's no doubt he's the\ntarget. That's the --\nMR. LICHTENSTEIN: But, I mean, the --\nDomino's itself viewed JWM as John McDonald. The\nstatement, we don't want to do business with you people\n-- you people isn't anyone else other than John\nMcDonald. And the allegations go further than simply\nback wages and even the dignitary damages which are\navailable under section 1981 but not under contract law\nis also alleged that by going after his credit and\ngoing after the banks that he had relationships with\nand given guarantees to and going after him personally,\nthat this wasn't simply derivative of JWM's damages,\nthat he had his own separate damages that, in fact,\ncould not have been recovered by JWM had JWM filed a\n1981 action.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Was there any overlap?\nThe -- what damages could the corporation JWM have\ncollected under -- had it brought a 1981 suit?\nMR. LICHTENSTEIN: It had -- it could bring\nthe -- a suit for the damages of the lost revenue that\nit could have gotten from its contract. We believe,\nlooking at State law, because we think it is a matter\nof State law, that here JWM would get its net profits.\nThe wages that would be paid out would be recoverable\nby John McDonald. Different States may look at this\ndifferently, but that really wasn't the issue that this\ncase had been --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Then the argument for\nsending it back, if I understand it, is this, that when\nyou look at the question presented, no one could\npossibly file a lawsuit -- and you didn't -- on the\ntheory, well, I'm hurt, so somebody should pay me.\nThat isn't a legal theory.\nMR. LICHTENSTEIN: That is correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Rather, the legal theory\nhere was that this contract-related section of the law\nis violated. And you want to say the simple fact that\nthe contract wasn't between McDonald and JWM, that's a\nseparate matter. That doesn't bar you from bringing\nyour claim. So, on the one hand, you argue that I can\nbring my claim as long as I'm a target and the motive\nas to why they breached some other contract, the one\nbetween the two corporations.\nAnd we seem to have it conceded that even if\nthat's too broad, there are at least some circumstances\nwhere you could bring your claim. One is if you were a\nthird party beneficiary. That's not present here. And\nthe second is if you are a target such that their\naction violates and interferes with a contract between\nyou and your own corporation. At least you have that\ngoing for you. So you say, well, if I was wrong about\nthe broader theory, give me a chance to allege the\nnarrower.\nMR. LICHTENSTEIN: Well, I don't --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is that right?\nMR. LICHTENSTEIN: Well, I don't really think\n--\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm trying to be helpful in\nthis respect.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. LICHTENSTEIN: I understand, and I do\nappreciate it.\nI don't think the broader theory, number one,\nwas if I was a target, that's all there is.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. You have to say there's\ncertain kind of target. The kind of target is that\nthey --\nMR. LICHTENSTEIN: Also --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- were discriminatory,\naiming at me, et cetera.\nMR. LICHTENSTEIN: Yes. I think that there\nare circumstances, in terms of alleging particular\ninjuries and interference with the making, enforcing,\nor performance of contract. I don't --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Which you didn't allege and\ndidn't even raise in the brief in opposition here.\nMR. LICHTENSTEIN: I -- I think we alleged\nthat in terms of the ability of Mr. McDonald to perform\non the contract, even though it was --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But those contracts --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: His contract with -- with\nthe corporation?\nMR. LICHTENSTEIN: The --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No.\nMR. LICHTENSTEIN: The statute doesn't say\nthat it has to be his own contract with the defendant.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's exactly the issue.\nAnd --\nMR. LICHTENSTEIN: And that's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- and that's how I\nunderstood this came -- case came up here. The\ncontract you're relying on is the contract between the\ncorporation -- between the corporation and Domino's.\nAnd can you -- can you sustain a lawsuit for the\nviolation of that contract? There was no mention of\nany other contract. I don't know why we should send it\nback down so you can mention a contract that you\nhaven't even thought of even when you filed the brief\nin opposition.\nSo that's the issue, whether the violation of\nthe contract between McDonald -- between Domino's and\nyour client's corporation will allow your client to get\n-- to get some damages inasmuch as he was the target.\nThat's how I understood the lawsuit.\nMR. LICHTENSTEIN: Well, that is clearly the\nmain thrust of -- of our position.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Now, could you tell me when\n-- the -- the claim was settled when your client's\ncorporation was in bankruptcy. Right?\nMR. LICHTENSTEIN: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And I assume your client had\nno -- nothing to say about -- about whether the\nsettlement would be -- would be accepted by the trustee\nor not.\nMR. LICHTENSTEIN: Absolutely. He -- it was\nout of his hands.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It was out of his hands,\nwhich means that, you know, you're -- you're sort of\npleading the advantage of a corporation, limited\nliability and all of that, and went through bankruptcy\ntaking that advantage, one of the consequences of which\nwas that you left it to the corporation to settle this\nclaim.\nAnd now you want to disclaim the advantage of\na corporation and say, oh, although the -- you know,\nthe corporation settled it out -- you know, I was no\nlonger in control of it because of the bankruptcy -- I\nwant to bring the claim on my own. I mean, I can\nunderstand why it would be nice for you to get that,\nbut it doesn't seem to me that you should be able to\nplay dog in the manger that way. You either -- you\neither accept the corporate form or you don't.\nMR. LICHTENSTEIN: The corporate form gives\ncertain protections, largely from personal\nresponsibility for corporate debt has some tax\nadvantages. It certainly is not going to protect any\ncorporate officer or shareholder from their own, for\nexample, tortious behavior.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you'd have to concede\nat a minimum that now that the corporation has settled\nthe breach of contract claim, that to the extent that\nthe corporation could have recovered under 1981, that's\ngone too because those two claims were intimately\nrelated, and you would be precluded from bringing such\na claim. So to the extent that there's an overlap, you\nface a res judicata bar.\nMR. LICHTENSTEIN: Your Honor, even if that\nclaim had not been precluded by bankruptcy -- and there\nwere two plaintiffs in this case, JWM and McDonald --\nthere certainly couldn't be double recovery. Anything\nthat would be recoverable in any form by JWM clearly\ncannot be recovered by John McDonald as an individual.\nAnd the Ninth Circuit said that. They were talking\nabout his own separate and distinct injuries. So\ndouble recovery would never be possible.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So they -- the Ninth\nCircuit's view is there are two potential plaintiffs in\nthis situation. Both can sue and one gets -- the\ndamages are not identical. That's --\nMR. LICHTENSTEIN: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The shareholder can sue.\nThe sole shareholder can sue. The corporation can sue.\nBoth have 1981 claims. It's not either/or.\nMR. LICHTENSTEIN: Correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: They both have 1981\nclaims, but the damages are different in the case of\nthe individual than in the case of the corporation.\nMR. LICHTENSTEIN: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask just -- did the\nindividual plaintiff assert the 1981 claim at any time\nbefore the settlement of the corporate claim?\nMR. LICHTENSTEIN: Yes, I believe that the --\nand I would have to check on the timing of this, but I\nbelieve that the suit was filed prior to the settlement\nof the 1981 claim -- of the bankruptcy --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I would have assumed --\nMR. LICHTENSTEIN: I'm sorry. Of the\nbankruptcy claim.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- there wouldn't have been\na settlement first without taking care of the second,\nif they had known both were on the table. But you say\nthe first had been -- both of them had been --\nMR. LICHTENSTEIN: That is my understanding.\nI -- I would have to really check on that, but that is\nmy understanding.\nAnd again, we are looking at this particular\nsituation. We keep talking about actual target. The\npetitioner keeps talking about derivative, incidental\nclaims. This isn't a derivative, incidental claim.\nThere is no one who has a race in this case that is\nrelevant other than John McDonald. JWM, John W.\nMcDonald, didn't get its financing, didn't get its\ncredit based on the fact that it was just created as a\ncorporation. It was John McDonald.\nHere, you have a situation where -- and\nit's kind of a unique one -- where there's a claim that\nJohn McDonald, the actual person who was being\ndiscriminated against, can't recover but some other\nentity can. That sort of turns section 1981 on its\nhead.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it was his -- it was\nhis corporation, and until he went bankrupt, any\nrecovery by that corporation would have been a recovery\nby -- by John McDonald. What -- what created your\nproblem is the fact that -- that the corporation went\nbankrupt.\nMR. LICHTENSTEIN: Your Honor, I don't think\nthat's the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But, you know, that's --\nthat's one of the -- one of the consequences of taking\nadvantage of the corporate form.\nMR. LICHTENSTEIN: Your Honor, I don't think\nthat's the case because if there was, for example, this\ntwo-party suit, JWM could not recover for dignitary\ndamages. Only an individual can do that.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, can you -- can you do\nthat under a general contract theory?\nMR. LICHTENSTEIN: I don't believe you can do\nit under a general contract --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So you're reporting not\nmerely the -- the tort of tortious interference, but\nsome general, broader concept of tort law as being\nsubsumed with -- under 1981. Aren't you?\nMR. LICHTENSTEIN: Yes, and I think the --\nthe case law indicates that, that this is not simply\njust federalization of State law. This -- looking at\nthe history of section 1981, this was designed to\ncombat not tortious interference claims in common law,\nbut the black codes during Reconstruction that\nprohibited black individuals, individuals just like\nJohn McDonald, from being able to pursue their trades,\noperate --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Right, but the -- the\nfocus of it is, as -- as I understand it, and the --\nthe kernel of it is -- is the capacity to contract.\nAnd we can certainly understand, I guess, how tortious\ninterference with contracts might come under that\numbrella, but you're going further and you're saying, I\ntake it, any tort that would give a recovery --\nrecognize a recovery for -- for dignitary injury would\nbe subsumed with -- within the concept of what 1981 was\nintended to -- to cover, which is a broader\nproposition.\nMR. LICHTENSTEIN: I think that what we are\nsaying I think is what the Court has said -- is that\nthis is a personal injury, and that dignitary claims\nare subsumed under 1981. I don't think it's expand --\nI don't think --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, contract -- I -- you\n-- you pointed out the -- the terminology which\nincludes contract damages or -- or contract harm as\npersonal harm, but it doesn't necessarily follow from\nthat that every harm or every injury that is personal\nfalls under -- conceptually under the 1981 umbrella.\nMR. LICHTENSTEIN: No. Discrimination is a\npersonal injury. This Court said that in Burke and I\nbelieve in Goodman also. So we're talking about\npersonal injury here, not just contract harm.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But it doesn't -- it doesn't\ntalk about personal injury that -- that broadly. It\ntalks about the right to make and enforce contracts.\nThat's the portion of it you have to be relying upon.\nIt doesn't talk about --\nMR. LICHTENSTEIN: Well, it's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- personal injury. It's\nnot a --\nMR. LICHTENSTEIN: -- it's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- it's not a more\ngeneralized tort. If want to call it a tort, it is a\ntort that goes to your ability to make and enforce\ncontracts. I don't see anything --\nMR. LICHTENSTEIN: I believe, Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- dignitary about that.\nMR. LICHTENSTEIN: -- that it goes to your\nright to not suffer discrimination within the realm of\nmaking, performing, and enforcing contracts. The focus\nis on discrimination, which is a personal injury and a\npersonal harm, and the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you're saying it means\ndiscrimination that relates to the making and enforcing\nof a contract with somebody else. And you're saying\nthat since the discrimination was targeted at you, even\nthough the contract was with -- was with somebody else,\nyou have a claim under this language of 1981.\nMR. LICHTENSTEIN: Yes, in this circumstance\nwhere the contract with someone else was the mechanism\nthat was used to target an individual. And, again,\nwhen you're dealing with --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but there's no way to\nconfine it to the individual, is it? I mean, the -- on\nyour -- on your target theory, a -- a general\ndiscriminatory animus as a basis for breaching a\ncontract with General Motors would give a right of\naction to -- to every minority employee of General\nMotors. Isn't that correct?\nMR. LICHTENSTEIN: If there is a\ncircumstance, as I understand the hypothetical, where\nthere is blatant and intentional discrimination, racial\ndiscrimination, by a multinational corporation like\nGeneral Motors, who say we're not going to do business\nwith any company that hires black people -- and clearly\nthere's an uphill battle for any kind of proof, but\nyou'd have to show that there was actual targeting,\nthat it really did interfere with the ability to\nperform contracts, and that there were specified\nindividual damages. But if that were the case and\ncould be proven, that would be pretty egregious and\nprobably something that 1981 should cover.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but when you say\ndamages that can be proven, the only damages you -- you\ninsist upon proving is the fact that you were a target\nand that it -- it insulted you. It -- it was -- you\nknow. That's the only damage you require. So you're\nsaying that every -- every minority employee of all of\nthe companies with whom GM, or whoever it is didn't do\nbusiness, would automatically have a cause of action.\nMR. LICHTENSTEIN: No, Your Honor, I don't\nbelieve we're saying that because --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No. Okay. Well, then --\nthen what do they have to show? They have to show that\n-- that their salaries were -- were reduced? But --\nbut you haven't shown that here. You didn't plead that\nhere. They have to show -- show that a contract with\nthem was breached? But you didn't plead that here and\nyou didn't show it here. So the -- the only thing that\n-- that you -- you can answer is they would all have\ncauses of action if their -- their honorific values\nwere somehow impugned.\nMR. LICHTENSTEIN: I don't believe so, and I\nthink that what was pled and what we believe is not just\nthe wages that were not paid, but also the dignitary\ndamages and also the damages specifically aimed at John\nMcDonald in terms of ruining his credit, going to the\nbanks, and in a sense slandering him, and those kinds\nof damages that were not recoverable by JWM but were\nspecifically John McDonald.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That was -- that was the\nconsequence of the bankruptcy of his corporation. I\nmean, that didn't -- didn't --\nMR. LICHTENSTEIN: No, sir. There were\nactually allegations of statements we are going to ruin\nyou personally and actions that went to ruin him\npersonally. This was not just simply derivative from\nthe corporation.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But none of the ruin\noccurred, as I understand it, until the corporation\nwent bankrupt. In other words, there was no direct --\nthe bank, for example, didn't say we're not doing any\nmore business with -- with you, McDonald. As I\nunderstand it, all the -- all the -- leaving dignitary\nharm aside, all the actual loss was -- was as a\nconsequence of the loss to the corporation. His stock\nfell, you know, whatever. But it -- it seems all\nderivative from the corporate loss.\nMR. LICHTENSTEIN: I don't believe so, sir.\nAnd the opposition to the motion to dismiss talked very\nspecifically about the statements to the banks that\nwere specific to John McDonald that hurt John McDonald\nindividually that really was not derivative from the\nbankruptcy --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Do you have an action --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, can you give me an\nexample?\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- on that in California?\nWouldn't you have an action in the State if somebody\ngoes and deliberately interferes with your credit and\nso forth?\nMR. LICHTENSTEIN: Well, I think the action\nthat Mr. McDonald took was just this, the 1981 action,\nsaying that there was a Federal violation, that this\nwas done to discriminate against him, and this seems to\nfit in with the 1981 cause of action and the purpose of\n1981, which is why this case was filed.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If it fits, it's because\nof some cases. So -- because this whole area, 1981,\ndidn't take off until Runyon against McCrary. So we're\nstarting with what? 1976. So to -- to flesh out what\nthat claim is, you must be relying on some decisions of\nthis Court when you talk about dignitary damages.\nMR. LICHTENSTEIN: Well, again, we -- I think\nwe could look at Shaare Tefila as -- as a good example\nof the kinds of damages. This was the Nazi swastika on\na synagogue.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But I thought that didn't\ngo into anything. That was a two-page per curiam, and\nit was just was there a claim. And it didn't --\nMR. LICHTENSTEIN: Well, the claim was still\n-- it was certainly not because of any kind of -- of\nprivity. It was damages based on --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that that was\nabout does the -- does the act cover religion or -- or\ndoes it cover that situation, or is it limited to race,\nor does anti-semitism count as race. I thought that's\nwhat was all that was decided.\nMR. LICHTENSTEIN: Well, at that time, that\n-- it said that anti-semitism counted as race, but\ncertainly they were able to recover once that threshold\nwas met because of the dignitary harms.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, I don't see anything\nin the opinion about -- I just see the issue before the\nCourt was does this come under the heading race.\nMR. LICHTENSTEIN: My reading of that was --\nwas a bit broader I think.\nAlso, you could look at cases such as\nSullivan where the right not to be discriminated\nagainst was compensable for the black family that was\nnot allowed into the club. So the cases that we have\ncited --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Both Sullivan and\nShaare Tefila, of course, though, were 1982 cases.\nRight?\nMR. LICHTENSTEIN: Correct.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not 1981 cases.\nMR. LICHTENSTEIN: Right. But this Court has\nsaid that the language is so similar that they should,\nfor these purposes, be viewed as having the same rules.\nAnd clearly, it would make no sense to have -- have\ndifferent ones. So they were 1982 claims, but the idea\nthat discrimination in terms of housing should have\ndignitary claims while discrimination in terms of\ncontract should not is something this Court has never\nsaid.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMR. LICHTENSTEIN: Thank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Mahoney, you have\n4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN E. MAHONEY\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMS. MAHONEY: Thank you, Your Honor.\nI'd like to focus on the issue of whether\nthere is any need for a remand.\nThe district court dismissed the complaint\nwith prejudice, and I think that it's fair to say that\nat that point, the plaintiff was under an obligation to\nseek leave to amend if it had any other alternative\ntheory that it wanted to advance in this case.\nOtherwise, we're left with the situation where they can\nsee that dismissal with prejudice, litigate up to the\nNinth Circuit, and then we litigate here. We go back\ndown and we keep doing this seriatim. It would make no\nsense. The dismissal with prejudice was proper, and\ncertainly in a 1981 case, despite liberal rules of\npleading, you have to identify the contract that was\nsupposedly violated, as well as, you know, the other\nelements.\nSecond, I think that if this were a harder\ncase about tortious interference principles, even if it\nhadn't been waived, I might understand the Court's\nreluctance to get into it. But we know from the\nbriefing that the plaintiff has conceded that his claim\nwould not be cognizable under the common law of\ncontract, third party beneficiary, or tortious\ninterference, and that is very plain from the brief at\npages, I think, 43 through 46 where they acknowledge\nthat under section 76 of the Restatement, they would\nnot be able to -- to recover. And they say, so what.\nThis isn't a federalized version of common law of\ninterference.\nSo given that concession, I think all this\nCourt would have to say is that the alternative theory\nthat wasn't even pled can't possibly state a claim\nbecause it -- it asks us to go far beyond what the\ncommon law did.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Mahoney, may -- may I\nask you one brief question that I should have asked on\ndirect? I hope you have time for it.\nBut supposing a fact situation in which a\nwholly owned -- a -- a corporation wholly owned by an\nAfrican American starts to negotiate with your client,\nand your client says, we have a policy of not dealing\nwith companies owned by African Americans. Would the\ncorporation or the individual have a lawsuit under\nsection 1981?\nMS. MAHONEY: I think the corporation would,\nYour Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You think the corporation\nwould.\nMS. MAHONEY: Absolutely because they -- a\nrefusal to deal -- it covers rights to make and enforce\ncontracts, and if -- if the defendant said, I will not\ndeal with this company, then I think that they have a\nright.\nAnd in this case, there was a claim that was\nbrought by the company for -- based on -- for breach of\ncontract.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But not under 1981.\nMS. MAHONEY: No, Your Honor, but the trustee\nmakes a finding that the -- the causation -- or reports\nto the court that causation principles could not be\nestablished, and so there was no point in bringing a\n1981 claim because he actually found in -- in materials\nthat are in the record of the bankruptcy proceeding --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But -- but in your view, to\nthe extent that racial discrimination might have\naffected negotiations, that would be an element of the\ncorporation's claim under 1981 rather than an\nindividual claim.\nMS. MAHONEY: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.\nMS. MAHONEY: Because if the -- if they were\nnegotiating on behalf of the company, that is the\ncompany's right to contract. It is not the\nindividual's right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you attribute the\nshareholder's race to the corporation?\nMS. MAHONEY: That's what the courts of\nappeals all do. Judge Friendly in Hudson Valley\nFreedom Theater looked at this issue and said that it\nwas the best way to approach this issue, that -- that\n-- and explained that it doesn't make sense to impute\nthe corporation's contract rights to somebody else,\ngive them power to enforce their contract rights. And\nit wasn't a 1981 case, but it was analogous, and that\nit made sense to, under those circumstances, impute\nrace, in effect.\nAnd I think that the way that courts have\ndone it is also a link to the word discrimination,\nwhich appears in 1981(c). In -- in Jackson v.\nBirmingham for the -- for instance, this Court did find\nthat a -- a male coach had been subjected to\ndiscrimination on the basis of sex, even though he's\nobviously not a woman, because it's a form of\ndiscrimination. And I think the courts have looked at\nthat as well.\nBut this -- the -- the -- all of the exact\nsame issues that are alleged in this complaint were\nalready raised and litigated through depositions and\ndiscovery in the bankruptcy court. And this presents\nall of the problems that this Court addressed in\nAssociated General Contractors about why there's such a\nstrong presumption against derivative claims because\nhere you can't trace the losses. You have no idea\nwhether or not the monies that JWM would have recovered\nfrom Domino's would have been used to pay other\ncreditors or used to do new projects or perhaps given\nto -- to McDonald.\nThank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
