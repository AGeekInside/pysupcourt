BRUECKNER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. BRUECKNER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe question presented in this case is whether\nState common law tort claims that a boat engine was\ndefective because it lacked a propeller guard are\npreempted either by the Boat Safety Act of 1971 or by an\nunpublished Coast Guard letter stating that the agency had\ndecided not to take any regulatory action with respect to\npropeller guards.\nThere is no express preemption here because the\nBoat Safety Act includes a savings clause that expressly\npreserves the availability of common law claims. And in\nlight of this clause, this case boils down to the question\nof whether our claims are impliedly preempted because they\nconflict with some valid expression of Federal law. And\nthe answer to this question is no for two distinct\nreasons.\nFirst, as the United States has argued, the\nCoast Guard letter itself lacks the force of law\nregardless of its content.\nAnd second, even if the Coast Guard could\npreempt State law in this fashion, there's no preemption\nhere because our claims are entirely consistent with the\nCoast Guard's stated reasons for not taking any regulatory\naction with respect to propeller guards.\nQUESTION: What would happen if there were no\nsavings clause in this case?\nMS. BRUECKNER: If there were no savings clause,\nour position is that there would still be no express\npreemption because section 4306 of the Boat Safety Act, by\nits terms, in our view does not encompass common law\nclaims. But the savings clause --\nQUESTION: Well, except that -- that this clause\nis different, say, than the one we had in Geier. The\nGeier clause -- savings clause begins -- or preemption\nclause begins with the assumption that there is a\nregulation. This begins the other way. It says the State\nmay not have any regulation unless it's consistent with an\nexisting Federal regulation.\nMS. BRUECKNER: That's true, Your Honor, but\nhere, as in Geier, reading this preemption clause as\nencompassing common law claims would render the savings\nclause of this statute superfluous, and that is exactly\nthe result that this Court rejected in Geier.\nQUESTION: Well, suppose a State said there can\nbe a common law action in the courts of this State for the\nviolation of any safety regulation which this legislature\nproposes, and we hereby direct that there be a propeller\n-- a guard on every propeller. Would that statute be\nvalid under -- under 4306?\nMS. BRUECKNER: In our view that statute would\nbe valid because we read 4306 as not even preempting State\npositive law, that is, laws and regulations, unless\nthere's an actual Coast Guard standard. But this Court\nneed not resolve that --\nQUESTION: But -- but 4306 doesn't require a\nCoast Guard standard. It -- it says that there's a\ndisability on the State legislature unless there is a\nCoast Guard standard and that State statute is parallel to\nit.\nMS. BRUECKNER: Section 4306 in our view can be\nread -- read two different ways. One, our reading of the\nstatute is that it only kicks in where the Coast Guard has\nregulated. The United States disagrees on this point and\nreads 4306 as expressly preempting all forms of State\npositive law, that is, laws and regulations, even where\nthe Coast Guard hasn't regulated.\nBut the United States and we agree that however\nyou read 4306 with respect to State positive law, common\nlaw claims are preserved, and the reason is that 4311(g)\nwould be stripped of any meaning if 4306 is read as\nencompassing common law claims.\nQUESTION: Not -- not when -- I mean, that's why\nI think yours is the better view, actually. But I mean,\non your view you needn't drive a wedge between the common\nlaw and positive law because there's meaning for both.\nMS. BRUECKNER: Absolutely, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: And I've never -- I guess it's a\nbetter question for the Government. I don't see why you'd\nwant to drive a wedge between those two.\nQUESTION: Well, let's -- let's take the\nGovernment's position which is that the State could not\npass a statute on a -- requiring a propeller -- a\npropeller guard. If -- if that's true, if we accepted\nthat, why is it that a jury should be able to require the\nsame thing?\nMS. BRUECKNER: Because that is what Congress\nmade clear in section 4311(g) that juries should be able\nto do. Jury --\nQUESTION: Ms. Brueckner, here's -- here's my\nproblem with 4311(g). You can -- it not only is a savings\nclause for common law, it's also a savings clause for\nState law. It says it does not relieve a person from\nliability at common law or under State law. Now, I -- I\ndo not know how an intelligent Congress could have --\ncould have written such a thing. But that's what it says:\nat common law or under State law.\nNow, you can't read the savings clause portion\nthat says under State law to mean all State law because\nthen the savings clause would totally cancel the\npreemption clause. Right?\nMS. BRUECKNER: I agree, Justice Scalia.\nQUESTION: So you -- you have to limit State law\nto mean, well, not all State law. And why -- why would it\nnot be natural to read common law also not to include all\ncommon law, for example, not including any common law that\nspecifically imposes liability for failure to have certain\npropeller standards?\nMS. BRUECKNER: First, Your Honor, the fact that\nthis savings clause is slightly broader than that at issue\nin Geier, because of the reference to State law, is not a\nreason to construe it narrowly.\nSecond, the reference to State law can easily be\nunderstood as a reference to, as the statute itself says,\nliability imposed under State law, which we read to mean a\nreference to State damages statutes such as wrongful death\nand survival. And this case is a perfect illustration of\nthat.\nQUESTION: Well, that really is a bit of a\nstretch, isn't it, to say you're talking -- when you say\nState law, you're only talking about wrongfully tendered\nan act and that sort of thing?\nMS. BRUECKNER: I don't think so, Your Honor,\nbecause section 4311(g)'s language is -- is quite clear\nand it is set forth at the blue brief at page 6.\nQUESTION: Well, to say it's quite clear -- it\ndoes not relieve a person from liability at common law or\nunder State law. Whatever we may come up with as the\nmeaning of that or you may suggest, I don't think you\ncould say it's clear.\nMS. BRUECKNER: I disagree, Your Honor, because\nthe reference to liability at common law or under State\nlaw to my mind suggests a reference to liability under\nState law, and liability under State law in this context\nis liability by which the measure of damages is a State\nstatute, such as the wrongful death statute or the\nsurvival statute here that this complaint arises under.\nQUESTION: I guess you have a different meaning\nof clear than I do.\nMS. BRUECKNER: That -- that may be, Your Honor.\nI would note, however, that in -- in Cipollone\nthis Court noted that language exactly like this, a\nsavings clause that specifically preserved liability at\ncommon law or -- or under State law in the Comprehensive\nSmokeless Tobacco Act, preserved common law claims. This\nis the same language. And again --\nQUESTION: Why do you need that? I mean, I'm --\nI'm interested. I might -- why do you need that if, in\nfact, your interpretation of the preemption clause is\ncorrect? There are some regs of the Coast Guard that do\npreempt positive common -- common law and positive law,\nand some that don't. And so the savings clause simply\nmakes clear that those that don't, don't. It gives\nmeaning to it.\nMS. BRUECKNER: You're absolutely right, Your\nHonor.\nQUESTION: So you don't need this damages thing,\ndo you?\nMS. BRUECKNER: No, we don't, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: Well, no, but the savings clause says\neven those that do, don't.\n(Laughter.)\nQUESTION: I mean, isn't that the --\nQUESTION: No, it doesn't necessarily have to --\nthe -- the -- I'm certain it's not clear to the contrary,\nbut it's at least arguably to the contrary.\nMS. BRUECKNER: Even without the savings clause,\nwe read section 4306 on its face as not encompassing\ncommon law claims, and the main reason why, putting aside\nthe savings clause, is that the language of 4306 tracks\nthe language of section 4302 of the statute, which is the\naffirmative delegation of rulemaking authority of the\nCoast Guard. It's on the first page of the appendix to\nthe blue brief.\nAnd 4302 authorizes the Coast Guard to do two\nthings: promulgate minimum safety standards and require\nassociated equipment. And this is exactly the same\nlanguage that's in 4306.\nQUESTION: Well, this is the kind of thing that\nthe Coast Guard could require, isn't it? Propeller guard?\nMS. BRUECKNER: Absolutely, Your Honor, under\n4302 --\nQUESTION: And in Arkansas Electric, I think we\nheld that a Federal decision to forego regulation in a\ngiven area may imply an authoritative Federal\ndetermination that the area is best left unregulated and\nwould have as much preemptive force as a decision to\nregulate.\nIs that the situation here? Certainly the Coast\nGuard looked at it and decided not to regulate. Should we\napply Arkansas Electric and say that's binding?\nMS. BRUECKNER: No, Your Honor, and here is why.\nThis case really presents the question, putting aside the\nexpress preemption issue which we believe is resolved by\nGeier, of under what circumstances does an agency's\naffirmative decision not to regulate pack a preemptive\npunch such as -- so as to wipe out common law claims. And\nthere are -- there are two preconditions that must be met,\nneither of which is present here.\nFirst, the agency's decision not to regulate\nmust take the form that itself possesses the force of law,\nand that is lacking here for reasons I'll explain in a\nmoment.\nSecond, the agency --\nQUESTION: That was the holding of Arkansas\nElectric; it doesn't have to take the form.\nMS. BRUECKNER: Actually the holding of Arkansas\nElectric was that there was no preemption at all in that\ncase, but perhaps Your Honor is --\nQUESTION: Yes, but the -- the passage I read to\nyou indicates that a decision not to regulate can, in\nfact, be -- have preemptive effect.\nMS. BRUECKNER: Yes, Your Honor, but a pure\ndecision not to regulate or a pure agency inaction has\nonly been held to exert preemptive effect in the context\nof statutes that preempt the field where there's total\nFederal occupation of the field.\nHere, however you read 4306 with respect to\nState laws and regulations, common law claims we believe\nare excluded from the regulated field. Therefore, there\nhas to be a conflict. And for affirmative -- an\naffirmative agency decision not to regulate to preempt\nState law under a conflict preemption analysis, there both\nhas to be an agency action that possesses the force of law\nand there has to be an actual conflict between the\nagency's underlying reasons for not regulating and the\ncommon law claims. And both of these criteria are absent\nhere.\nFirst, as the United States has argued -- and we\nagree -- this unpublished letter -- Coast Guard letter\nitself lacks the force of law. It's important to remember\nhere that not only is there no agency regulation, but\nthere was never any rulemaking. There was never any\npublication of a notice that the Coast Guard was even\nconsidering --\nQUESTION: Let -- let me ask you this question.\nLet's assume a -- a hypothetical case in which the engine\nmanufacturer is sued and is -- and is found liable by the\njury for having a propeller guard which makes the boat\ndifficult to turn so the boat hits the dock. It -- it\ncan't turn fast enough to avoid the dock. We have that\ncase and it's consolidated with yours. So we have one\ncase where they're liable for having the guard and another\ncase where they're liable for not having the -- the guard.\nWould you argue the case the same way and would we have to\naffirm both cases?\nMS. BRUECKNER: Yes, Your Honor, and -- and Your\nHonor's hypothetical actually illustrates my point.\nThere's no question that a boat manufacturer could not be\nheld liable for installing -- could not be held -- a -- a\nclaim alleging that a boat manufacturer was negligent per\nse for installing a propeller guard couldn't be based on\nan existing Coast Guard regulation because the letter\nlacks the force of law with respect to boat manufacturers.\nThere's no agency action here that could form the basis\nfor any common law claim one way or the other.\nQUESTION: But -- but if the manufacturer is\nsubject to conflicting jury verdicts, as you indicate -- I\nsuppose we could change the hypothetical so we have two\nStates, one which requires it, the other of which -- and\n-- and you would say those weren't preempted, either.\nMS. BRUECKNER: That's correct, Your Honor. And\n-- and this is --\nQUESTION: That seems to me to -- to give very\nlittle effect to the wording of the clause which says that\na State cannot have a standard unless it's parallel to a\nFederal statute.\nMS. BRUECKNER: But it does give meaning to the\nlanguage of section 4311(g) which says that even where a\nCoast Guard has promulgated a minimum safety standard,\ncommon law liability is preserved except to the extent\nthat there's an actual conflict.\nQUESTION: But you could -- you could read that,\ncouldn't you -- you -- you argue that to accept your -- to\nrespondent's view would mean the savings clause has no\nwork to do, but the savings clause could still be for\ncases of negligent -- negligent operation, for cases in --\nof negligent -- negligence in manufacturing a piece of\nequipment. So there -- there would be -- on any reading\nof this, there would be something saved. So -- so you --\nI think you have to modify your argument. The savings\nclause would be nullified.\nMS. BRUECKNER: I respectfully disagree, Justice\nGinsburg, and -- and here's why. The respondent here does\ncontend that the savings clause applies to breach of\nwarranty and negligent manufacturing claims. And that\nargument fails, first of all, because such claims are not\nencompassed within 4306 on its face, and therefore there\nwouldn't have been any need for Congress to save those\nclaims.\nSecondly, this Court construed a similar savings\nclause in Geier as expressing Congress's intent that mere\ncompliance with minimum safety standards would not be an\nabsolute defense to liability in a product liability\naction. And compliance with a Coast Guard regulation\nestablishing a minimum safety standard could never be an\nabsolute defense in a case involving negligent manufacture\nor a breach of warranty, for example. So, the\nrespondent's theory leaves really no meaningful role for\nthe savings clause to play.\nAnd I would emphasize that these arguments were\nall asked and answered in Geier, and the Court held that a\nsimilarly worded savings clause, albeit without the\nreference to State law, has to mean that common law claims\nare not expressly preempted.\nNow, that doesn't mean that our claims must\nnecessarily be permitted to go forward if they conflict\nwith Federal law, but there's clearly no conflict here\nagain for two reasons.\nFirst, the Coast Guard letter lacks the force of\nlaw. And on that point, before turning to the reasons why\nour claims are actually consistent with the Coast Guard's\nstated reasons for declining to regulate, I would further\nnote that not only is there no regulation, no rulemaking\nhere, but the Coast Guard letter was never even published\nin the Federal Register. It was never made available to\nthe public in any formal way whatsoever. And it doesn't\neven purport to set forth a definitive agency position on\nthe subject of propeller guards. What the letter says is\nthat the agency is going to continue to consider the\nmatter and gather further data. And so, this letter\nitself lacks the force of law.\nThe second reason, of course, is that even if\nthe Coast Guard could preempt simply by writing a letter,\nour claims are not inconsistent with the Coast Guard's\nstated reasons for declining to regulate. The Coast Guard\nwas focusing on the lack of a universally acceptable\npropeller guard solution, the costs of a retrofit, and\nsuch other matters, and there's no inconsistency between\nour claims --\nQUESTION: What if the Coast Guard's reason had\nbeen we think putting the coast -- putting a propeller\nguard on would make the -- the vessel even more dangerous?\nMS. BRUECKNER: There would still be no\npreemption here because the Coast Guard letter lacks the\npower to preempt.\nQUESTION: Would that satisfy the second\ncondition of -- of your two-prong test?\nMS. BRUECKNER: It would, Your Honor, but our\nposition is that there still has to be a regulation and\nthere's no regulation here.\nQUESTION: Well, I understand. I'm just asking\nyou about the second part of your test.\nMS. BRUECKNER: It would satisfy the second part\nof the test.\nFinally, I'd like to reserve the remainder of my\ntime for rebuttal, if I may, but I --\nQUESTION: Very well, Ms. Brueckner.\nMr. Stewart.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER\nMR. STEWART: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Coast Guard is the Federal agency charged\nwith administration of the Boat Safety Act and with the\npromulgation of safety standards.\nAnd to understand the Coast Guard's traditional\nview of these issues and the backdrop against which\nCongress legislated, it may be helpful to look to what the\nCoast Guard said at the time the Boat Safety Act was\nproposed. And if you'll look to page 31 of the blue\nbrief, this is the answer provided by the Commandant of\nthe Coast Guard when he was asked, in written form,\nwhether it was his view that compliance with Federal\nsafety standards would furnish a complete defense to\nliability under common law or State law. And he was\nfurther asked, if there wouldn't be a complete defense,\nshould that be made explicit in the act.\nAnd the Commandant said: we do not believe that\ncompliance with promulgated standards under the act has\nthe effect of relieving a manufacturer from liability\nunder the usual tort law concerning negligence or\nwarranties. For many --\nQUESTION: Go ahead.\nMR. STEWART: For many years the Coast Guard has\nrequired compliance with standards by inspected vessels.\nCourts have consistently held that a vessel owner's\ncompliance with Coast Guard inspection requirements is not\nsynonymous with seaworthiness under maritime law. Though\nthe analogy is apparent, we would have no objection to an\nexpress provision to clarify that a manufacturer's\ncompliance with promulgated standards does not by itself\nrelieve him of any tort liability which otherwise could\npertain.\nAnd I think the --\nQUESTION: Is he -- is the Commandant a lawyer?\nMR. STEWART: I'm not sure whether the\nCommandant was a lawyer, but the -- the questions were\nsubmitted to him in written form. He was given time to\nconsult with his advisors and prepare his answers.\nQUESTION: But the Commandant's lawyer or the\nCommandant might well admit that if, as Justice Ginsburg\npointed out, there's defective design, if -- if the\npropeller falls apart and -- that then there's liability.\nMR. STEWART: I think -- I think what --\nQUESTION: So that -- this -- this thing that\nyou quote us just brings us right back to where we began.\nMR. STEWART: Well, I think a couple of things\nare noteworthy about the way that the Commandant\nresponded.\nFirst, when he gave -- first, he made clear that\nthe Coast Guard was familiar and was comfortable with the\nidea that even when it had inspected a vessel and had --\nthe -- the vessel had passed the Coast Guard's own\nregulatory standards, nevertheless there was a -- the\npossibility of damages liability based on unseaworthiness.\nQUESTION: Would --\nQUESTION: What do we care whether the Coast\nGuard was happy? I mean, this isn't even plumbing the\nmind of Congress. It's plumbing the mind of the Coast\nGuard. What do we care?\nMR. STEWART: Well, I think part of the argument\non the other side has been that whatever the text of the\nstatute might say, the Court should strain to hold common\nlaw claims --\nQUESTION: Well, maybe. That may -- but what I\ndon't see here is whether he's aware of the fact which is\n-- and I'm aware of it and you are -- that whatever\nstandard the Coast Guard has -- let's say you have to have\na 1-inch wire, and what my -- they mean by that is you\ndon't have to a 2-inch wire. Okay? Absolutely clear.\nAnd there is no point in telling the State of Idaho you\ncan't pass a law for a 2-inch wire when any jury in the\nState of Idaho can come in with a judgment that does\nprecisely the same thing as that rule. I mean, maybe this\nCoast Guard Commandant doesn't care about whether it can\npreempt at all, but it doesn't seem to me logical to take\nthe position you can't have a regulation but you can have\na tort judgment that is identical.\nMR. STEWART: Well, first of all, the tort\njudgment is not identical because it fulfills an important\npurpose that the prescriptive standard doesn't, namely\ncompensating people who have actually been injured by\nreason of defects.\nQUESTION: You could say we don't care if, in\nfact, the rules that we're about to promulgate are totally\nignored by the States, as long as the purpose is to\ncompensate someone.\nMR. STEWART: Well, as this Court made clear in\nGeier, the effect of holding that State common law suits\nare not categorically preempted is not that the Federal\njudgments can be ignored; that is, there's still a role\nfor principles of conflict preemption. The Court in Geier\nsaid the point of the savings clause would be eviscerated\nif common law claims were -- that were not identical to\nFederal standards were categorically preempted.\nNevertheless, particular common law claims can conflict\nwith the -- the text or purposes of particular\nregulations.\nQUESTION: The Commandant didn't seem to\nunderstand that. In -- in your endorsement of the\nCommandant's statement, I thought you were disagreeing\nwith -- with counsel for the petitioners here who -- who\ndid say that there could be conflict preemption of common\nlaw claims, anyway. The Commandant doesn't even seem to\nrecognize that.\nMR. STEWART: I think what he is saying is we\nhave always understood that compliance with our regulatory\nrequirements will not furnish a categorical defense to\nsuits at common law and we would understand the same --\nQUESTION: Well -- well, maybe it ought to be\ninterpreted, to try to make sense of this scheme, as\ncertainly covering the situation where the State by its\ncommon law doctrine tries to make a requirement that the\nCoast Guard has -- and the Federal Government has flatly\ncontradicted by regulation. That may not be this case,\nbut if the Coast Guard were to pass a regulation saying no\npropeller guards should be put on boats because we think\nit is more dangerous, if they have them, now we should\ninterpret the savings clause as not allowing a cause of\naction on that same ground.\nMR. STEWART: That's exactly right and that's\nprecisely the analysis that the Court went through in\nGeier and it's the analysis we urge the --\nQUESTION: But -- but under your -- your\nrationale, you say, oh, but there's a duty to compensate,\nand that's different. Why doesn't that same argument\napply so that you tell Justice O'Connor, oh, yes, the jury\ncan -- can go full speed ahead?\nMR. STEWART: I mean, I think the Court has\noften pointed out in various contexts that even where it\ncan be said that a primary goal of Congress was X, we\nshouldn't assume that Congress intended to pursue that\ngoal at all costs. The point is simply that Congress drew\na somewhat different balance with respect to common law\nactions than it did with -- with respect to prescriptive\nrules.\nAnd I think part of the reason for that was that\nCongress was establishing a mechanism by which the Coast\nGuard could itself promulgate prescriptive safety\nstandards. In ousting State law, it was replacing State\nlaw with something else. But the Boat Safety Act doesn't\ncontain any mechanism by which an injured person can seek\ncompensation for his injuries, and therefore it was\nnatural for Congress to determine that subject to conflict\npreemption principles, the remedial mechanisms that had\npreviously been available should continue to be available.\nAnd I think --\nQUESTION: Well, maybe -- maybe it doesn't do\nthat much. I mean, maybe the savings clause allows causes\nof action for breach of warranty, for negligent operation\nof the boat, and things like that.\nMR. STEWART: I -- well, the -- the same could\nhave been said of the savings clause in Geier, but the\nCourt, nevertheless, concluded that common law actions\nwere not categorically preempted. And I think the reason,\nas Ms. Brueckner said, was that no one could have supposed\nthat common law claims going to an entirely different\naspect of the manufacturer's conduct than the divine,\ndesign feature that was at issue in -- in the Coast\nGuard's regulatory --\nQUESTION: I -- I don't see how you -- you talk\nabout straining. All -- there is some -- number of\nstatutes. They all read a little differently, but there\nisn't really that much substantive difference between\nthem. And although the Court has disagreed, I've tended\nto take the view, treat statutes and common law alike, and\nprobably they're not preempted either unless the agency\ncomes in and makes it pretty clear that they are. Now,\nthat's pretty easy for people to follow. If they want to\nargue pro and con preemption, they go to the agency.\nMR. STEWART: I think that may --\nQUESTION: So wouldn't I reach that same\nposition here?\nMR. STEWART: That -- that might be a legitimate\nrule to follow in the absence of statutory language\nexpressly addressing the subject, but here we have one\nprovision that says a State may not establish a law\nrequirement of setting forth a safety standard or\nrequirement for associated equipment unless it is\nidentical to a Federal safety standard.\nAnd then in the savings clause it says -- and\nthis is at page App. 6 of the blue brief -- compliance\nwith this chapter or standards, regulations, or orders\nprescribed under this chapter does not relieve a person\nfrom liability at common law under State law. So whatever\nthat means, it has to mean there will be some\ncircumstances under which the manufacturer complies with\nall applicable Federal rules and yet is nevertheless held\nliable under the common law. And --\nQUESTION: Very simple. In those situations\nwhere you -- as you just heard, the ones that the\npetitioner just argued for.\nQUESTION: Design defect.\nMR. STEWART: But -- but if -- if the same rule\nof preemption were applied to common law suits as to\nprescriptive regulations, namely that the State couldn't\ndo anything that was not identical to Federal law, it\ncould never be the case that a manufacturer who complied\nwith Federal law could, nevertheless, be held liable at\ncommon law. The -- the preemption clause and the savings\nclause, read together, compel the conclusion that Congress\nat least intended a different rule of preemption to apply.\nQUESTION: That's -- that's not -- that's not\ntrue. The Coast Guard doesn't say how the -- the\npropeller should be manufactured, out of a -- an eighth of\nan inch or -- or of a tenth of an inch blade. And if the\nsmaller blade falls apart, you can sue the manufacturer.\nMR. STEWART: But I -- I don't think anyone\nwould have contended that such a suit would be preempted\nby the preemption clause even in the absence of the\nsavings clause.\nAnd again, this is exactly the same situation\nthat was before the Court in Geier. Had -- had that\nargument been a sound one, the Court would presumably have\nconstrued the -- the Motor Vehicle Safety Act savings\nclause that was at issue there --\nQUESTION: Geier didn't have the same clause,\nand I -- I think it's a big difference when it says under\ncommon law or State law --\nMR. STEWART: But it does refer --\nQUESTION: -- because you -- you have to\ndistinguish State -- not just State common law, but State\nstatutes. You have to draw some line that is going to\nexclude State statutes as well as the common law.\nMR. STEWART: Well, it does refer to -- may I\nfinish?\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. STEWART: It refers to liability under -- at\ncommon law or under State law, and therefore State law is\nmost naturally taken to be a reference to laws that\naccomplish purposes similar to those of the common law.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Stewart.\nMr. Shapiro, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN M. SHAPIRO\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. SHAPIRO: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nI think a word of history here explains some of\nthe mystery surrounding the statutory language. For over\n90 years, Congress has specified the safety equipment that\nhas to be installed on motorboats, and it was in 1937 that\nthis Court ruled in Kelly v. Washington that the States\nmay not impose their own requirements for safety equipment\non boats that travel in interstate waters. And that was\nthe background of this legislation.\nThis act preempts State law creating any\nrequirement for boat equipment that is not identical with\nthe prescribed Coast Guard regulation. And this serves a\ncritical fail-safe purpose. Risky devices like propeller\nguards may not be imposed on the public under State law\nunless and until they're approved by the expert regulatory\nagency under the criteria that Congress has laid down.\nNow, this preemption provision has three\nexceptions which are written right into the provision, but\nnone of those exceptions fits this case. So my friends\nhave to make the argument that this general savings\nclause, which says nothing about preemption, is another\nimplicit exception, but that's inconsistent --\nQUESTION: Unless there's just no Federal\nregulation at all on this.\nMR. SHAPIRO: And -- and --\nQUESTION: Maybe the Federal Government has not\n-- acting through the Coast Guard, has made no\nrequirement, no decision at all.\nMR. SHAPIRO: And the -- the wisdom of this\nstatute is that until the Coast Guard makes a decision\nabout a device like propeller guards, they may not be\nimposed on the public.\nThink of what happens under Justice Kennedy's\nexample. If Illinois commands installation of these\ndevices and backs up that judgment with millions of\ndollars in damages, people in 49 other States are exposed\nto the risks and burdens of propeller guards.\nQUESTION: Well, not necessarily. I mean, you\nsay if Illinois imposes it, I mean, this is one reason, it\nseems to me, that you can take the statute at -- at its\nword. The common law never imposes a requirement. This\njury found that a propeller -- that failure to have a\npropeller guard was negligence. Another jury in another\ncase in the same State may find that the failure to have a\npropeller guard was not negligence. There's no State\nrequirement being imposed.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, we agree with the statement\nin Garmon that the Court, for preemption purposes, should\nassume compliance and then ask what are the implications.\nThe implications are that Illinois could coerce the\ninstallation of these devices. Another State may\ndisagree.\nQUESTION: On the basis of one jury verdict?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Or one or --\nQUESTION: It's like in tort actions in general.\nI don't see how you get from one jury verdict, that that\nbecomes the positive law of the State, that you must have\na propeller guard.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, after the first jury\nverdict, then the -- in come the claims for punitive\ndamages in the next case, and there is a powerful coercive\neffect from damage actions. This Court has said so.\nQUESTION: Mr. Shapiro, isn't it true that there\nall -- aren't there -- isn't it true there are all sorts\nof cases in which different designs of boats may have a --\nbe more dangerous than other designs, depending on whether\nthey have a propeller guard?\nI notice that one of the allegations in the\nprayer for relief in the complaint was they provided an\nunreasonably dangerous design in utilizing an unprotected\npropeller. That -- as I read that, that wouldn't\nnecessarily mean every boat needed a -- a propeller guard,\nbut rather some particularly dangerous designs might need\none.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, what's --\nQUESTION: So that you get some preemption and\nsome not.\nMR. SHAPIRO: The -- what the safety council\nfound, the Coast Guard's committee of 21 experts, was that\nfor all boats that travel more than 10 miles an hour,\nthese are infeasible devices. And the reason is you have\nto match the propeller guard with the particular engine\nand the particular hull combination. There are thousands\nand thousands of hulls out there.\nQUESTION: But the -- the Coast Guard itself\ndidn't find anything. It said we're not making the\nstandard now. As counsel for petitioner pointed out,\nthere is no formal action. There's just non-action by the\nCoast Guard.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, the -- the Coast Guard said\nthat the available accident data compiled by the 21\nexperts did not support a propeller guard requirement\nunder the --\nQUESTION: But they were still watching it.\nThey didn't make a -- a determination that propeller\nguards are dangerous, therefore should not be used. They\nsaid we're still keeping this under advisement.\nMR. SHAPIRO: And in April of 2001, they looked\nat this again, and the Coast Guard representative on the\nsafety council said we realize we cannot mandate\ninstallation of propeller guards. They're not feasible,\nand the propeller guard subcommittee said again, these\nwill increase blunt trauma injuries.\nQUESTION: This is something that's published,\nthat's -- that's a formal kind of action?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Yes. Yes, Your Honor. It's -- I\nbelieve it's footnote 14 in plaintiff's reply brief. They\n-- they cite to the web site for these council minutes.\nQUESTION: No, but did they -- did they go\nthrough any, in effect, administrative procedure kind of\nformal action?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, but under this statute, that\nisn't necessary, Your Honor. It -- they -- they did\nhave --\nQUESTION: Well, it may be -- it may not be\nnecessary in the sense that they are under an obligation\nto do it, but if they don't do something like that, I -- I\ndon't know that their -- their announcement has any\nparticular status that's relevant here.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, because of the wording of\nthis statute, which is so different from Geier -- it's the\nexact opposite of Geier -- under this statute, unless\nthere's an identical Coast Guard regulation in place,\nState law is preempted.\nQUESTION: I don't see how it is so different\nfrom Geier. I mean, you read it as saying if there's no\nregulation at all, no requirements, then the State\ncouldn't have any tort law?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, as to equipment, associated\nequipment, for boats, unless there's a Coast Guard\nregulation in place, the States can't mandate that\nequipment.\nQUESTION: All right. Then you would say, for\nexample -- not just that, but in your view if you had,\nlike a propeller that shot torpedoes, I mean, something\nthat was absolutely absurd, you -- the State would not be\nable to have a tort judgment based on that even though the\nCoast Guard has never had the chance to look into it?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well --\nQUESTION: Now, I mean, I grant you that's a\npossible reading.\nBut I think perhaps a better reading of it would\nbe that you can't have a -- a rule or a regulation or a\ntort judgment or any other requirement of law different\nfrom a Coast Guard requirement when there is a\nrequirement.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Your Honor --\nQUESTION: But not when there isn't.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Your Honor, we -- we think that\noverlooks the history that I began with because under this\nCourt's decisions, the States could not impose\nrequirements for equipment or -- or construction, design\nor structure for boats moving in interstate waters. That\nwas Kelly v. Washington, a unanimous opinion by Chief\nJustice Hughes.\nQUESTION: But, Mr. Shapiro, in -- in this very\nsetting, the Coast Guard said, when this Boat Safety Act\nwas new, States, until we get around to doing this, your\nlaw controls. So there must have been some scope for\nState law regulating equipment that was there for the\nCoast Guard to say, it will take us time to get our\nregulations. In the meantime, State law applies. So\nthere must have been some law to apply in the States.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Oh, yes, there -- there are three\nexceptions to the preemption provision. They're explicit\nexceptions, and we don't have to go looking to the savings\nclause for a fourth, implied exception.\nThere -- there is an exception if the Coast\nGuard grants an exemption under APA procedures. They\ndidn't do that here.\nThere's another exemption for local hazardous\nconditions, but that exception doesn't fit here either.\nQUESTION: But I'm talking about in the interim.\nIt's from -- what was it -- '71 to '73?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Yes, Your Honor.\nQUESTION: The rules that applied were State\nrules because the Coast Guard said, States, your law\ncontrols while we haven't got any yet.\nMR. SHAPIRO: That's the key point, Your Honor.\nThat was done by formal exemption, and that shows that\nthis statute has the exceptions built right into\npreemption provision.\nQUESTION: But it shows that there must have\nbeen State law. You -- you -- I thought you were saying\nit's been forever or for a very long time that only\nFederal law sets the standards.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Yes.\nQUESTION: The Coast Guard must have thought\nthere were standards in existence that could be applied.\nMR. SHAPIRO: What -- what was happening,\naccording to the legislative history, is the States were\nbeginning to require battery covers, anchors, lines, and\nother pieces of associated equipment, including warning\ndecals on the boats, and Congress says, this has to stop.\nThere's nothing wrong with these requirements, but we\ncan't have 50 sets of them. So this field is being\npreempted for associated equipment requirements until the\nCoast Guard adopts a regulation or the Coast Guard gives\nan exemption, which it did in 1971.\nAnd I think the structure is very important.\nThis is so different from Geier. There was not a\nstructure like this with three exceptions written right\ninto the statute, and to treat the savings clause, which\ndoesn't say a word about preemption and which the\nlegislative history says is simply a matter of State law\ndefenses, as a fourth, implied exception to preemption\ntruly does violence to the structure of this law.\nQUESTION: Well, what do you --\nQUESTION: How do you treat the savings clause?\nWhat -- what do you think it means?\nMR. SHAPIRO: It does not address preemption at\nall. It addresses an affirmative defense that it -- that\ncould be available under State law. That's the defense of\ncompliance with Coast Guard regulations or orders or any\nprovision of this entire statute.\nNow, section 288C of the Restatement of Torts --\nthis is an echo of section 288C which was published just a\nfew years before Congress passed the savings provision.\nIt doesn't deal with preemption at all. It deals with --\nwith compliance.\nQUESTION: Right. To make this clear, would you\nidentify the kinds of cases that you envision at State law\nthat this clause, in effect, says you may not defend\nconclusively by claiming compliance with a Coast Guard\nreg? What kinds of cases?\nMR. SHAPIRO: It has a huge scope of operation,\nunlike Geier. To start with the Coast Guard's example,\nthe ordinary negligence case, negligent operation was very\nimportant to Congress because most of these propeller\naccidents occur because of negligent operation or reckless\noperation of the boat. That's what the Coast Guard says\non its web site today. And so the defendant couldn't\ndefend by saying, gee, my boat complies with all the Coast\nGuard regulations --\nQUESTION: Okay. No, no, I understand your\npoint. But you've got negligent operation and what --\nwhat else do you have in mind?\nMR. SHAPIRO: The -- the next thing the Coast\nGuard referred to is express warranty. The defendant\ncouldn't say simply because I've complied with this long\nlist of Coast Guard requirements, I don't have to honor my\ncontractual promises or --\nQUESTION: Okay. How about negligent\nmanufacture?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Negligent installation is\ncertainly covered, and defective manufacture is also\nprotected by the savings clause. That's when a particular\nunit comes off the assembly line and it's defective.\nThose were the original tort cases --\nQUESTION: I -- I suppose there would be some\nclose cases. Suppose there's two ways to make a\npropeller. One is to have it slightly canted with a\nteflon cover and -- and a gear mechanism that makes it\nstop the minute it hits a hard object. The other is the\ncheaper way, to make it terribly sharp and no -- no\nability to stop. Could the injured party sue the\nmanufacturer of the second kind, the -- the cheap,\ndangerous kind of propeller?\nMR. SHAPIRO: It is possible and for this\nreason. The language of the statute for associated\nequipment only preempts requirements for associated\nequipment. And that could be construed to mean simply\nrequirements to install propeller guards, which you've not\ninstalled.\nNow, if you took a different interpretation of\nrequirements for, it might encompass that case, but this\nCourt could give a narrow construction to requirements\nfor.\nAnd this case is the paradigm case because\nmanufacturers have decided not to use this kind of safety\nequipment because they know it's a hazard. It's a known\nhazard. Several courts have disapproved these devices.\n21 safety experts of the Coast Guard have pointed out the\ndangers this creates. So manufacturers have consciously\n--\nQUESTION: Mr. Shapiro, I'm not sure you\nanswered my question before. Again, supposing 90 percent\nof the boats really don't need a propeller guard, using\nthe reasoning of the committee that decided not to\nrecommend. But there are 10 percent that are some exotic\ndesign that's particularly dangerous and they really are\ndangerous unless they have a -- a propeller guard on them.\nCould you say that -- that 10 percent has to be treated\nlike the 90 percent?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, because the manufacturer\ndoesn't know --\nQUESTION: Well, it's the design. I'm just\ntalking about a particular design --\nMR. SHAPIRO: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- that seems to be particularly\nhazardous if you had the propeller too close to the person\noperating the boat or something like that.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, the reason that's preempted\nand that that is a requirement for associated equipment,\neven in the case that you give, is because the\nmanufacturer has no idea what hull is going to be put\ntogether with this motor. The motor can move from hull to\nhull to hull.\nAnd what the Coast Guard found -- the -- the\ncommittee found in its report was that you have to have an\nexact hydrodynamic fit between the particular engine and\nthe particular hull and the particular propeller guard.\nSo if juries, say, impose propeller guards on -- on\ndesigns we think are dangerous --\nQUESTION: Yes, but what if the manufacturer of\nthe propeller is on notice that it's being -- was being\npurchased for a particularly dangerous design, as I've\ndescribed? It seems to me sometimes the -- the company\ncould know what kind of boats it's going on.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, we -- we rely on the logic\nof this committee report which says that -- that for all\nplaning boats that go 10 miles an hour or faster, these\ndevices are counterproductive because they interfere with\nsteering. They double the amount of fuel that's consumed.\nThey increase air and water pollution and they create\nserious hazards of blunt trauma injury.\nSo what the -- the committee found was that\nthese devices for any category of planing boat -- and here\nwe have a boat that goes 50 miles an hour. We've got an\n18-foot ski boat with a 115 horsepower engine.\nQUESTION: But you could -- it seems to me as a\nmatter of defense to tort liability, you could put all\nthat evidence in, and say in this particular case, our\ndesign was sensible for the very reasons you just\ndescribed. Therefore, we're not negligent.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, that's true in many of these\npreemption cases, but all it takes is an errant jury\nverdict or two or three to coerce a decision by the\nmanufacturer to install devices that are very hazardous to\nthe public.\nQUESTION: Then all you'd have to do is go to\nthe Coast Guard and say, look what's happened, and then\nthey'd be explicit, if you're right. And the other side\nthere would have a chance to argue to the Coast Guard that\nyou're not right.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Justice Breyer, that's cold\ncomfort. They would hand us this brief that they've just\nsubmitted saying that it's up to the jury to decide\nwhatever the jury wants.\nQUESTION: Well, fine. If that's the policy of\nthe Coast Guard, then I don't see why you should rely upon\nthem for preemption.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, because Congress had a\ndifferent vision. Congress was going with the rule of\nKelly, Kelly against Washington.\nQUESTION: Well, why did Congress then say\nminimum standards? It didn't say the Coast Guard\nstandards are necessarily adequate. It just said, Coast\nGuard, set minimum standards.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, the legislative history is\nvery explicit on that. The boating associations and the\nmanufacturers associations had all kinds of very elaborate\nstandards of their own, and everybody said during these\nhearings that is to be encouraged. We want them to do\nmore of that. The statute shouldn't stop that.\nBut there was no suggestion that the States could\nintervene and impose their own standards and their own\nrequirements. And in fact, in the Ray decision, this\nCourt said minimum standards under another similar statute\ndo not mean -- do not mean that the States can embroider\non and supplement those -- those standards.\nAnd after all, the preemption provision here\ndoesn't say anything about minimum standards or maximum\nstandards. It says all requirements for boat safety\nequipment are preempted unless there is an identical Coast\nGuard regulation in place. This is the rule of Kelly\nagainst Washington which --\nQUESTION: Mr. Shapiro, do you cite Kelly\nagainst Washington in your brief?\nMR. SHAPIRO: We did not. Plaintiffs cited it\nin their brief. It's 302 U.S. And I'll give the Court\nthe cite. I think it's critically important. 302 U.S. at\n14 through 15.\nQUESTION: It's critically important, but you\ndidn't even cite it.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, it's quoted in the cases\nthat we do cite. It's quoted in the Ray decision. It's a\n-- it's an early precursor of Ray and in Locke. I was\nexplaining it as -- as the background of Congress's\nlegislation here.\nAnd I'd like to suggest to the Court that it\nmakes a huge difference here that this is a case that\narises in the maritime context. At a minimum, the\nmaritime context means there is no presumption against\npreemption, as the court below held. And because Congress\nwanted to achieve uniformity --\nQUESTION: Well, I mean, that may be true if\nyou're talking about commercial boating, but it's not true\nof recreational boating.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Oh, yes, it is. We believe it is,\nYour Honor, because this Court --\nQUESTION: Little motorboats?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Absolutely.\nQUESTION: 5-foot skiffs and little put-puts?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Since the '40s and the '50s, this\nCourt, and later in Foremost and in Sisson, this Court has\nheld that recreational boats fall squarely within the\nmaritime jurisdiction.\nQUESTION: Even in New Hampshire?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SHAPIRO: I -- there may be some carve-out\nfor New Hampshire in this statute.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. SHAPIRO: And I've tried to figure out the\nreasons for that carve-out, and I've never -- I've never\nunderstood those.\nBut this is maritime context, and this lake --\nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit has held\nthat is -- it's a navigable interstate body of water.\nQUESTION: Yes, because it -- it happens to lie\non the border between two States, but not every landlocked\nlake is subject to -- to Coast Guard maritime\njurisdiction.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Oh, absolutely not. It has to be\nan interstate body of water.\nBut since the 1850s, this Court has held that\ninterstate waterways are subject to the maritime\njurisdiction.\nAnd this waterway, by the way, was constructed\nby the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. It's surrounded with\nmarinas that rent pleasure boats, and this is big\nbusiness, the pleasure boating business, on Dale Hollow\nLake.\nAnd because this is a maritime context, that\nsays a lot about the savings clause, because this Court\nhas held that in maritime cases, savings clauses should be\ninterpreted narrowly to avoid obstructing the carefully\nconstructed preemption provision in the statute and to\navoid making an end run around the Coast Guard's expert\nsupervision, which is what Congress wanted.\nAnd we go further and say that because the court\nbelow was right in characterizing this as an admiralty\ncase, any conflict between Illinois law and Federal law is\njust imaginary. That's because Federal common law follows\nFederal maritime jurisdiction, and there can't be --\nQUESTION: But you didn't argue that. I mean,\nin Illinois -- all through the Illinois State courts, the\nassumption was that the -- the law to be applied, if you\ncould have a common law, would be Illinois common law, not\nsome Federal maritime common law.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, the Illinois Supreme Court\nagreed with us on this point. They have two pages in\ntheir opinion --\nQUESTION: They -- all they said is that the --\nthe preemptive force is different. They did not say that\nIllinois common law was displaced. That is, if there is\nState law to -- if there is law other than the Coast Guard\nregulations to apply, it was Illinois State law all -- all\nalong. And as far as I know, it wasn't until this Court\nthat you raised the question, never mind State law, the\nFederal maritime law would control in any event.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, we think this is an included\nquestion. It was certainly addressed by the court below.\nThe court below cited this Court's Jensen decision, which\nis the leading maritime preemption decision. And it was\nusing maritime analysis to support the preemption holding\nthat the court ultimately made. Now, this was step number\none in our preemption argument below, but we're entitled\nto elaborate it in this Court and cite additional cases.\nQUESTION: Well, why was the argument that\nIllinois law is preempted, why was that at issue at all\nif, as you say, there is no State law in this area? It's\nall Federal.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, we -- we proceeded to argue\nin the alternative that under express preemption and under\na conflict preemption that -- that State law was\npreempted. But with a two-page discussion in this opinion\non maritime, I think it is an addressed and included\nquestion. And if the Court doesn't consider --\nQUESTION: Did you -- in your -- in the briefing\nof this case in the State court, did you make the argument\nFederal law covers the waterfront? There is no State law\nto apply?.\nMR. SHAPIRO: We made the first part of the\nargument. We said Federal law covers the waterfront\nbecause Congress conceived of this as a maritime question\nand was preempting State law broadly, exerting its\ntraditional, under Kelly against Washington, the usual\nFederal Government role over equipment installed on\nmotorboats. And we said that this is an enclave of\nFederal law. And we cited this Court's Yamaha decision\nand we cited the Foremost decision. We cited admiralty\ncases and we said it was an admiralty case.\nQUESTION: But Yamaha said that this is an open\nquestion, and it didn't resolve it.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Right, but our -- my point is that\nwe were citing this Court's admiralty decisions. And then\nthe Illinois Supreme Court went further and cited a host\nof additional admiralty decisions. Now, when you have\nthat kind of discussion in a State court opinion of a\nFederal law issue, this Court, I believe, can reach that\nas an included question and it's an intertwined question.\nAnd let me suggest it is the easiest way to\nresolve and the narrowest way to resolve this case because\nit is propeller guard-specific. It makes no aggressive\nlaw regarding tort claims on -- on the land, and --\nQUESTION: But, Mr. Shapiro, the Solicitor\nGeneral disagrees with you on this point.\nMR. SHAPIRO: The Solicitor General hasn't\nbriefed this point, the maritime law point.\nQUESTION: I -- I thought his brief said he\nthought they're wrong on the presumption going the other\nway. I'm pretty sure that's in his brief.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, I don't think --\nQUESTION: Are you suggesting that if this\naction had been in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, instead of\nwhere it was, you'd have a different result or you might\nhave a different result?\nMR. SHAPIRO: I think you'd have the same\nresult, but you would have fewer reasons for reaching that\nsame result.\nQUESTION: The argument you're making now would\nnot apply.\nMR. SHAPIRO: It would not apply. It would\napply to -- to Lake Michigan but not to Lake Geneva.\nNow, I'd like -- like to return to Justice\nKennedy's comment about the conflicting judgments among\nState courts. If -- if Illinois were to mandate propeller\nguards and back up the judgment with millions of dollars\nin damages, that would impose these devices on all the\npeople in the United States, and at everybody's estimate,\nthese are risky devices with serious problems. And in the\nnext case in another State, we would be sued for\ninstalling these devices.\nThe Walt Disney World was sued. They put a\nlittle propeller guard on a bumper boat and they were sued\nwhen a kid's arm got caught in the propeller guard. So\nsure as can be, if -- if one State mandates them, the next\nState is going to penalize them.\nAnd the legislatures of the State -- this is the\nworst and most shocking aspect of this theory. The\nlegislatures of the States could not protect their\ncitizens against --\nQUESTION: I don't see that, Mr. Shapiro. I\ndon't know why the Illinois State legislature couldn't say\nthat our State law is the Coast Guard's standards and\nnothing else. A State legislature could see that this\nkind of result of a jury never happens again. The State\nwould be free to say precisely that whatever the Coast\nGuard includes is the law, and what they haven't included,\nit can't be required. The State legislature could enact\nsuch a law. I don't see why it couldn't.\nMR. SHAPIRO: What it -- what it could not enact\nis a law that says no boats coming into the State of\nIllinois or California may be equipped with propeller\nguards. Why? Because that's not identical with the Coast\nGuard regulation.\nAnd yet, the juries in various States could be\nimposing these devices. People could be losing their\nlives and boats --\nQUESTION: Why couldn't a State legislature say,\nsatisfaction of the minimum standards prescribed by the\nCoast Guard excludes any other liability for design\ndefects?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well --\nQUESTION: Why couldn't the State legislature\nsay that?\nMR. SHAPIRO: I think that that may well be a\nsafety standard in disguise, but it -- the State could not\ndo the thing that it really had to do which was to\nprohibit boats using propeller guards. If -- if juries in\nvarious parts of the United States put pressure on\nmanufacturers to put propeller guards on their boats, the\nlegislature needs the power to say no, this can't come\ninto the -- can't come into the State. But that is\nclearly preempted under the SG's interpretation of the\nstatute.\nAnd I think that is a true disservice to\nfederalism, to have these kinds of conflicting judgments,\nand it shows the wisdom of Congress's architecture in this\nstatute, that the States may not impose requirements for\npropeller guards unless and until the Coast Guard vets\nthese proposals, finds that they're safe, finds that they\nsatisfy Federal criteria of feasibility and safety, and\nadopts the rule and a regulation.\nIt's like FDA legislation, protect the public\nagainst common law claims of this sort that could have\nsuch serious adverse effects on the public.\nQUESTION: Well, you -- you say that -- that in\nthe situation you -- where you have the conflicting jury\nverdicts, which I agree is a problem, you go to the Coast\nGuard and tell them that, and they just say, oh, that's\ntoo bad. We don't care. They might not say that, of\ncourse. But -- but if they did say that, that's why\nCongress insisted that you have this identical\nrequirement. That's your view.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Yes.\nQUESTION: But suppose they do just refuse to\nhave any requirement. I mean, that's equally absurd to\nme. On the one hand, you point to one absurdity one way,\nbut it seems equally absurd to have no law in the area\nwhere the Coast Guard just refuses to act.\nMR. SHAPIRO: The -- there's a good reason for\nrefusing to act in this instance, and that is, these\ndevices are very hazardous. You can't turn the boat\nsafely. There's a danger of blunt trauma injury that is\nworse than the propeller slices. A surgeon can slice up\npropeller slices occasionally, but the blunt trauma injury\nfrom a propeller guard is lethal if it hits you in the\nchest or in the head.\nAnd it -- it -- the steering is interfered with.\nYou have to double the horsepower of these engines once\nyou put a big bird cage around or a big circle around the\npropeller guard. There -- there are thousands of pounds\nper square inch of pressure exerted on these propeller\nguards, and they create a serious navigation hazard.\nAnd it -- it isn't just the committee that in\n1990 concluded that these were dangerous. These were 30\nexperts on safety appointed by the Secretary of\nTransportation that assigned all these dangers and\nfeasibility problems.\nAnd this is exactly, by the way, what seven\ncourts have held who've looked on -- at propeller guards\non the merits. They've held that these devices are not\nfeasible and that they're dangerous. There's not a single\ncourt in the United States that has said that these have\nto be installed.\nAnd so, this is the problem, the real world\nproblem, of having individual juries listen to those who\nlost before the administrative forum on propeller guards.\nOkay, we're going to start all over again in the court\nsystem, and now we're going to get juries to start\ncommanding installation of propeller guards. There's a\nreal world hazard, a danger for the public, and Congress\nhas wisely drafted this statute to protect us and our\nchildren against that risk.\nNow, these devices clearly raise policy concerns\nof nationwide significance and that's why the Coast Guard\nhad to consider these issues in proceedings around the\ncountry that lasted for 18 months. Many sectors of\nsociety are affected by these devices, and Congress just\ndid not intend that individual juries were going to make\nthese decisions for the whole country. This would be\nextraterritorial regulation with a vengeance, just what\nthis Court said in Locke should not be done under State\nlaw.\nNow, my friend also has argued in the brief that\nsafety is the goal of the Boat Safety Act, and that\nuniformity is just a secondary concern. But Congress did\npursue its safety agenda through a particular method, and\nthat was uniform standards for marine equipment. Congress\nwanted the whole Nation to benefit from safe and efficient\nstandards, and it wanted the whole Nation to be protected\nagainst standards and requirements that represent risky\nexperiments. And that's just what propeller guards are.\nAnd that's why the Coast Guard said in 1991 that these\nstandards have to meet stringent Federal criteria before\nthey're imposed.\nAnd that does bring us back to congressional\nintent because when Congress passed this preemption\nprovision, the States were starting to adopt requirements\nfor battery covers and for warning placards on boats and\nfor lines and anchors. And Congress said, that's fine,\nbut we can't have 50 sets of these requirements. We've\ngot to be uniform set of these requirements. And it is\nuntenable to conclude that although the harbor master at\nBelmont Harbor cannot compel the installation of propeller\nguards, the Circuit Court of Cook County is perfectly free\nto do that with a big threat of damages. Both of these\nare exercises of Illinois law and they're both preempted.\nWe accordingly urge this Court to affirm the\ndecision of the Illinois Supreme Court.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Shapiro.\nMs. Brueckner, you have 3 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LESLIE A. BRUECKNER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. BRUECKNER: Your Honor, the -- the maritime\nargument was waived. The reason the United States never\nbriefed it is that respondents didn't even raise it in\ntheir opposition brief to this Court. It was never raised\nuntil they filed their brief on the merits. This is not\nthe time or place to decide the issue raised by\nrespondent, particularly the Yamaha question that was\nspecifically left reserved in Justice Ginsburg's opinion.\nOn the savings clause, their whole argument is\nthat the savings clause must be read simply to preserve\nbreach of warranty and negligent installation claims. Not\nonly is this not supported by the language of the clause,\nwhich is itself broad, but the legislative history of the\nBoat Safety Act in the Senate report -- let's forget about\nthe Commandant for the time being. The Senate report\nstates -- and I'm quoting from the blue brief at 32 --\nthat the purpose of this section to assure that in a\nproduct liability suit mere compliance with the minimum\nstandards promulgated under the act will not be a complete\ndefense to liability. This demonstrates that Congress had\nin mind product liability actions just like this one.\nRespondent also claims that these boats are --\nare terribly -- that propeller guards are terribly\nhazardous and the Coast Guard has found this. Well, first\nof all, the Coast Guard letter doesn't say anything about\nthe hazards of propeller guards.\nAnd contrary to Mr. Shapiro's contention, in\nApril 2001, the Coast Guard's advisory committee issued --\nstated in its minutes a recommendation that the Coast\nGuard actually require propeller guards as one of four\npermitted options on boats exactly like this one. This is\n-- the cite is on page 11, footnote 14 of the yellow\nbrief. So not only did the Coast Guard not find in 1990\nthat propeller guards are hazardous, but it's considering\nrequiring them on boats just like this one.\nOn the conflicting judgments point, Mr. Shapiro\nraises the specter of conflicting jury verdicts in these\ncases and Congress cannot possibly have intended that\nresult. That's exactly the result that Congress permitted\nin the context of motor vehicles where, absent a Federal\nsafety standard, the States are -- juries are permitted to\nimpose whatever liability they choose. And even where\nthere's a minimum standard, under Geier, jury verdicts may\nbe permitted to go forward.\nBut if -- and indeed there are conflicting jury\nverdicts that arise, the Coast Guard can step into the\nbreach, and as Justice Ginsburg suggested, State\nlegislatures could pass a rule saying that no liability\ncould be imposed in cases like this one.\nI would also point out on this conflicting jury\nverdict problem that we are not seeking punitive damages\nin this case. Punitive damages are not available in\nIllinois in a wrongful death action.\nFinally, I would note that the absence of a\nregulation is itself reason to find no preemption here.\nThis statute, as we read it, provides that common law\nclaims may be permitted to go forward unless there's a\nconflict. Here there's no regulation. There's no formal\nstatement of agency purposes. There's no articulated\nreasons that our claim could possibly conflict with.\nAnd finally, at the end of the day, we have a\nvictim here who would be left without any compensation\nwhatsoever if this Court holds that common law claims are\npreempted. We would urge this Court to permit our claims\nto proceed.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Ms.\nBrueckner.\n"
