        "content": "(11:12 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in Jones v. Flowers.\nMr. Kirkpatrick.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL T. KIRKPATRICK\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nIn Mullane, this Court held that due process\nrequires that notice efforts conform to what a person\nwho actually desires to provide notice would do under\nthe circumstances. Such a person would not turn a\nblind eye to the return of an initial mailed notice,\nbut would consider reasonable follow-up steps to\nprovide that notice.\nWhere valuable real property is at stake and\nthe State learns that its initial effort has failed,\nthe State should do two things. First, it should\nsearch readily available sources for a better mailing\naddress and resend the notice, and second, if a better\naddress cannot be readily ascertained or the second\nnotice also fails, the State should post a notice on\nthe property or contact the occupants.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Kirkpatrick, I don't\nrecall what -- what the rule is. Does notice have to\nbe given by registered mail? Would it -- would it be\nadequate notice in the -- in the ordinary case to send\nnotice by regular mail?\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: Justice Scalia, in a case\nlike this where there's valuable real property, regular\nmail would not be sufficient to comply with due\nprocess, and the reason why is this. A reasonable\nperson who actually desires to give notice will use\ncertified mail for the information that comes back to\nthe sender. Then the sender either knows the notice\nhas been received and they can stop with confidence, or\nthey know that they have failed and there's still time\nto take reasonable follow-up steps.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but do we have a case\nthat says that, you have to use registered mail?\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't think we did. And\nit would seem to me that especially when you have the\ntaxpayer's name and address on file, I doubt whether it\nwould be a denial of due process to send notice by\nregular mail to that address. And if -- if that\nsatisfies due process, the State would never have known\nthat it did not reach the individual.\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: Justice Scalia --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And it seems -- it seems\nmean to punish the State for going the extra mile and\nsending the notice by registered mail because that\ninformed them that it didn't reach him.\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: Yes, but Justice Scalia,\nthe State, once informed that the letter had never\nreached Mr. Jones, did nothing. The State was\nindifferent to the information that came back. So, in\nfact, what the State did here was no better than\nsending regular mail because they ignored the\ninformation that came back from the use of certified\nmail. And, in fact, had they used regular mail, it\nmight have been better for Mr. Jones.\nNow, we're here in this case to discuss what\ndue process --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Why?\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: Well --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In Mullane, it was regular\nmail. It wasn't certified mail. Right?\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: Yes, that's correct.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And isn't it 100 percent\nclear that there were a number of those addressees who\ndidn't get the letter?\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: Yes, Justice Ginsburg,\nthat's correct, but --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And yet, their interests\nwere cut out by the decision, and the Court said that\nwas okay.\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: Well, the context was very\ndifferent in Mullane because in Mullane there was a\nlarge number of interested parties with very small\ninterests in a trust, and what they were being given\nnotice of was an accounting to settle those trusts.\nAnd as long as some of the people who were similarly\nsituated received notice, they could act in a way that\nwould protect other members of the class.\nHere, we're talking about real property with\njust a single owner, and in this case, where we have an\n$80,000 house that was lost and sold for only $21,000,\nit would seem to me that due process would require more\nthan just regular mail.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you have another\nfactor here that wasn't present in Mullane; that is,\nthe person who received notice has a statutory\nobligation to advise government of the current address.\nThe people involved in Mullane had no such obligation\nto notify anybody of their current address.\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: That's correct, Justice\nGinsburg. But what Mullane announced is that the\ngovernment must use reasonable diligence to ascertain\nan address where it can be found. In this case, we\ndon't quarrel --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It wasn't the government\nin -- in Mullane it wasn't the government.\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: Well, that's right. The --\nthe party charged with giving notice in Mullane had an\nobligation --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: How do -- how do we -- I\nmean, this was the problem I -- I had with -- with your\n-- your brief here, and it's the same problem Justice\nGinsburg has. What kind of weight, what significance\ndo we give to this obligation to keep the government\ninformed?\nOn the face of it, it seems like a -- an\nobligation that ought to get considerable weight.\nEverybody knows that if you own real estate, you've got\nto pay real estate taxes on it. You're going to have a\nhard time doing that if they don't know where to send\nthe bill, and so on. So it seems like a very\nreasonable obligation for the government to put on you.\nWhat weight do we give that in -- in the\nanalysis?\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: Justice Souter, I think it\nis given weight when we evaluate the reasonableness of\nthe initial notice effort, and we do not quarrel with\nthe State first sending notice by certified mail to the\nlast address in the State property records.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And then that would be so\neven if there were no affirmative obligation on the\nproperty owner.\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You'd say, well, if they --\nif they send the -- the notice to the last address they\nhad, or if they send it -- since we're talking about\nreal estate, maybe if they send it to the -- to the\nproperty, nothing wrong with that. So that's kind of a\nwash.\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: Justice Souter, I think\nthat there are a couple of points that need to be made.\nOne is that Mr. Jones' failure to update his\naddress did not relieve the State of its constitutional\nobligation.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No. But I want to know what\nMr. -- I mean, it does not relieve it of some\nconstitutional obligation, and we're trying to figure\nout what that is. And -- and the point of my question\nis in figuring out what it is, what significance do we\ngive to the affirmative obligation on the part of the\nproperty owner to keep the government informed of the\naddress?\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: The answer is once the\nState was informed that the first mailed notice had\nfailed, it gets no significance.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: All right. Then -- then it\nhas no significance ever because the -- the State has\nan obligation to use the best address it has, whether\nhe's got an obligation to -- to keep the address\nupdated or not. And -- and this is the -- the tough\npoint for me with your case. It seems to me that your\ncase depends on our saying the obligation to keep the\n-- the address current has absolutely no significance.\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: Justice Souter, it has no\nsignificance once the State is actually informed that\nthe notice has failed because I think the significance\nof the statute is it increases the State's confidence\nin the address that it's initially using. But once the\ncertified mail comes back unclaimed, at that point it\nknows that the address from 1967 in its records and the\nstatutory obligation to update the address, that is\noutweighed by actual knowledge that in both 2000 and\n2003 the certified mail notices were not received.\nI'd like to go back to Justice Ginsburg's\nfirst question about why regular mail might actually\nhave been better in this case. Had regular mail been\nsent, we don't know what would have happened. We might\nnot have had a due process challenge because the\nenvelope would have ended up in the mailbox at Bryan\nStreet. It would have been brought inside by the\noccupants, and they may very well have brought it to\nMr. Jones' attention, the way they did when they\nreceived the eviction notice after the redemption\nperiod had closed.\nBut I think the most important factor, even\nif we don't agree on whether certified mail was\nrequired by the Constitution in the first instance, is\nthat once the government used certified mail, it cannot\nthen ignore the information that it gained as a result\nof that choice. This --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And he also had a\ncontinuing obligation to inform the government of his\naddress.\nOne fact about this case that -- perhaps it\nwas in the record and I missed it. At the time the\nproperty was sold, how much did Mr. Jones owe, taking\naccount of the back taxes, the interest, the penalties,\nall that?\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: Approximately $6,000\nbecause the property was sold for $21,000. The minimum\nbid was the assessed value of the property, which in\nArkansas is 20 percent of the fair market value. So\nthat was about $14,000. Plus about $4,000 in back\ntaxes, another 10 percent in interest, and another 10\npercent in penalties, and some small, in this instance,\ncosts of notice.\nBut that brings us to an important point, is\nthat the cost of notice and the cost of a search to\nfind a better address will not be borne by the State.\nIt will be borne either by the owner as a cost of\nredeeming the property or it will be borne by the\npurchaser as a cost of acquiring the property. So\ncertainly here where we have an $80,000 house sold for\n$21,000, there was sufficient margin to allow for some\ncosts to find Mr. Jones so that he could be informed\nwithout making this property --\nJUSTICE BREYER: How did they find him, by\nthe way?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Would you tell me --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- how in your opinion?\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Oh, excuse me.\nJUSTICE BREYER: How did they find him?\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: The purchaser served an\neviction notice to the property --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No. I'm not saying how did\nthey? How in your opinion should the Post Office\nDepartment or the government have found him?\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: They should have searched\nthree categories of sources for a better address and\nthen tried mail again. And those three categories are\nthe State's own records, such as the driver's license\nrecords or voter registration rolls; second, public\ndirectories like the phone book or an Internet search\nengine; and third, they should have considered using\ncommercial services such as those that are used by\ncreditors.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So they find 13 people\ncalled Gary Jones or G. Jones in Little Rock. Now,\nwhat do they do?\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: Two things. One is they\ncan look for the Gary Jones that has some tie to the\nBryan Street address, and certainly --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I interrupt with this\nquestion? Do you think all those steps were\nconstitutionally mandated?\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: No. I think what is\nconstitutionally --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What was constitutionally\nmandated in your view?\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: Reasonably diligent efforts\nto ascertain a correct address after the return of the\nfirst certified mail and how far --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So you would not include\nposting on the -- posting a notice on the house as\nconstitutionally mandated.\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: Justice Stevens, I would.\nFirst, I think that the State can search for a better\naddress by mail.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, they can -- they can do --\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: Yes.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- a lot things.\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: But --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I'm trying to decide what\nthey must do.\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: With real property, if the\nowner has not been notified by mail, absolutely I think\nthey should post notice on the property. That is a\ntraditional way --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Would that be\nconstitutionally sufficient if they posted a notice?\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: It would be\nconstitutionally sufficient if they posted a notice\nbecause they could not ascertain a better address.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, now so it would not\nbe constitutionally sufficient if that's all they did.\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: That's correct. And I\nthink that's --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So what is the\nconstitutional minimum that would be sufficient?\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: Reasonably diligent efforts\nto find a better address and if a better address --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: It would be decided on a\ncase-by-case basis depending on the particular facts in\nthe case.\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: Well, this Court in\nSchroeder v. City of New York, I think, recognized that\nit's impossible to have a mechanical rule to apply in\nevery circumstance. I do think, though, that the --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And your opponent argues\nvery persuasively the mechanical rules are very\nimportant in this particular area of government\nbusiness.\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: Well, they are, but in this\ncase, the State knew within 2 weeks of sending the\ninitial mailed notice that it had not been received.\nThat was 3 years before the taking. So there was\nsufficient time for the State to take some very minimal\nefforts to provide notice.\nAnd remember, with regard to posting, in this\ncase the State actually visited the Bryan Street\nproperty and they did not post a notice or contact the\noccupants at that time, although they could have done\nso for virtually no cost at all, no additional effort.\nAnd we know from what happened with the eviction\nnotice that had they taken that very minimal effort to\npost the notice, it would have worked.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But I take it in -- in this\ncase -- I mean, I -- you're probably right that it\nwould have -- it would have worked here, but I -- I\ntake it that in the absence of that -- that hindsight,\nyou would say that in -- in the regular case that\nsimply posting notice on the house, after the letter is\nreturned, would not be enough, that the -- that the\nposting on the house would be sufficient only if they\nhad exhausted other efforts to get a better address so\nthat in this case, going back to Justice Breyer's\nexample, they -- they'd have to follow up whatever it\nis, the 18 G. Joneses or Gary Joneses that they could\nfind in the phone book before they could then fall back\nand resort to posting on the house. Is -- do I\nunderstand you correctly?\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: Justice Souter, you do.\nThat -- that is our -- our point, but I would like to\nqualify that slightly.\nIn -- if the search does not, with reasonably\ndiligent efforts, turn up a better address or if\nthere's a better address and the letter comes back, I\nthink at that point it's perfectly reasonable to stop\nsearching for an address, to give up on mailed notice,\nand at that point post the property because getting --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the search of\n-- the search of what? Just Little Rock or the State\nof Arkansas? What if this guy had moved to Chicago?\nThey -- he'd be out of luck under your approach then.\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: Well, if they contracted\nwith a credit bureau, for example, or a skip tracer, it\nis quite easy to find people that have moved across the\ncountry, much easier today than it was, you know, years\nago because technology has really expanded the amount\nof information that is readily ascertainable.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How many people --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Does -- does it follow from\nyour argument that someone who purchases at a tax sale,\nbefore they conclude the purchase, should find out what\nthe State has done?\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: Justice Kennedy, that would\nbe a reasonable way to have a statutory scheme.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And the purchaser from that\npurchaser the same. In other words, if Flowers had\nsold to X, then X has to make the same inquiry because\nhe sees I guess what, a quit claim deed or a tax sale.\nSo before a purchaser can purchase from Flowers, that\npurchaser too must see whether or not they hired an\noutside agency and so forth.\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: It might be prudent to do\nthat. I think that one --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, isn't it required to\ndo that under your title, if you're going to have your\ntitle set aside by Jones?\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: Yes, although if the title\nis set aside, Ms. Flowers will receive a full refund of\nall the money that she's paid, and that's under the\nArkansas statutory scheme.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what about the\npurchaser from Jones? If -- pardon me -- from Flowers.\nIf Flowers has spent the money, then that purchaser is\nout of luck.\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: That may be correct and I\nthink when somebody goes to purchase property and they\nfind out that title insurance is not available because\nof the tax sale deed, they have to consider the\npotential exposure.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So one of the consequences\nof your rule is to devalue any property sold by the\ngovernment because it is open to this kind of challenge\nfor deficiency in title. So you've now devalued the\nproperty in the hands of the State.\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: I think only for a\ntemporary period of time because there's a 2-year\nstatute of limitations to challenge the sale and that's\nwhy the State tells tax sale purchasers that they\nshould not make expensive improvements to property\nuntil that time has closed.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask, Mr. Kirkpatrick?\nIn Arkansas, is the tax -- tax delinquency a matter of\npublic record so a prospective purchaser would find it\nby making a title search?\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: It is a matter of public\nrecord. I'm not sure whether --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But it could be revealed by\na title search?\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: I don't know, Your Honor,\nwhether a title search would reveal it, but certainly\nin the county records, all of the delinquent properties\nare entered and open to the public for inspection.\nThey may have to look in two different places.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Would this case come out\ndifferently? You know, your client had an\nobligation to keep the State informed of -- of his --\nhis address so that they could send the tax bills to\nhim, suppose the statute, in addition to simply\nreciting that obligation, said, and if the taxpayer\ndoes not keep the State advised of his current address,\nany notice mailed to the last address that he gave will\nsuffice for all purposes.\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: Justice Scalia, I --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose it said that\nexplicitly. Would that -- would that make this case\ncome out differently?\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: No, it would not because --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Why? I mean, the State can\npunish people for not doing what the law tells them to\ndo, and here the State is saying we tell you to keep us\n-- you keep us advised of your -- your address. If you\ndon't, I guess we could throw you in jail for half a\nyear, but no, we're not going to do that. We're just\ngoing to say that -- that your -- your punishment for\nviolating the law is that this kind of a notice will\nsuffice.\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: Justice Scalia, I believe\nthe Federal constitutional obligation would still apply\nregardless of whether the State of Arkansas tried to\nlegislate its way out of it.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but there -- no, but\nthis is a consequence of violating the law of -- of\nArkansas. Certainly the State can impose consequences\nfor violating its law.\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: Well, it --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You know, and my next\nquestion is going to be, if you say it would come out\ndifferently, then isn't -- isn't it sort of silly to\nmake the State go on and say that? If they could do\nthe same thing by simply reciting what's going to\nhappen, why -- why should we make them do that?\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: I don't think that --\nJustice Scalia, I don't think that -- if Arkansas\nhad that kind of statute, that it would make this case\ncome out differently because I think the due process\nanalysis and the application of the Mullane standard to\nthese facts where the initial mailed notice comes back\nwould be the same. I think it may be a factor, when\nwe're determining what is reasonable, whether or not\nthe owner complied with that statute, but I don't think\nthat Mr. Jones loses his constitutional right.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Could they fine him for not\n-- could they fine him for not -- for not keeping them\nadvised of -- of where -- where his tax address is?\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: I suppose as a matter of\ncriminal law they could.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They could. Suppose they\ncould. Right.\nCould they fine him -- how much money did you\nlose here?\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: He lost about $70,000 worth\nof equity.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Could they fine him $70,000?\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: That would seem to be a\nvery harsh penalty.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's pretty harsh, but do\nyou think this Court would strike it down?\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: I do.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You do.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I frankly don't see the\ndifference between failing to keep the State advised as\nto your residence and failing to pay your taxes. He\nknew he had a duty to pay the taxes.\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: That's right.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And should not that figure\ninto the analysis?\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: Justice Stevens, it should\nnot figure in at all because he still had a statutory\nright to redeem the property, and once he had that\nstatutory right to redeem the property, due process --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, no, I understand\nthat. But doesn't -- he would know whether the taxes\nhad been paid or not.\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: In fact, in this case he\ndid not. And while the record is rather sparse on\nthis, the mortgage company paid the taxes for 30 years.\nAfter the mortgage was retired, Mr. Jones thought that\nthe occupant, Mrs. Jones, was paying the taxes. He was\nmistaken in that belief and that's what happened here.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, this is a very unique\nfact situation. We're trying to announce a rule that\nwill govern the typical transaction. And is it not\ntrue that typically the homeowner will know whether or\nnot he's paid his taxes?\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: Typically the homeowner\ncertainly should, but we all make mistakes and\ncertainly there are lawyers --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But he has to make mistakes\nfor 2 or 3 years running before it's significant.\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: Arkansas set up a statutory\nscheme that gave him a right to redeem up until 30 days\nafter the sale of the property. That statutory right\n-- he gets due process whether he's innocent or not\ninnocent. And I think in the case where --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, but how long do the\ntaxes have to be in arrears before they can send him a\nnotice and start the proceeding running?\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: They wait until the taxes\nhave been delinquent for 1 year. At that time, it's\ncertified from the county to the State. They send\nnotice saying that 2 years into the future, there will\nbe a tax sale if the property hasn't been redeemed.\nEven after that public sale, there's a 30-day\nredemption period.\nIn this case the house didn't sell at the\npublic sale. So then we started an entirely new\nprocess of the negotiated sale, which again involved\nnotice and ultimately the property was sold at\nnegotiated sale. So there is sufficient time after the\nState learns about the failure of the initial mailed\nnotice to take further reasonable steps.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kirkpatrick, you\ndistinguish Mullane. You recognize that a lot of the\npeople never got that notice, and you said there were\nmany people involved there, that you could rely on\nothers. It's also how much of a burden are you going\nto put on the notice-giver when you have a large class\ninvolved.\nThere was a figure -- and I forgot what the\nnumber it was -- of how many notices are -- don't succeed\nin delivery.\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. The\n-- the figure, which comes from the Tsann Kuen case out\nof Arkansas Supreme Court, is that there are 18,000 tax\ndelinquent parcels certified every year in Arkansas.\nBut what we do know is that 85 percent of tax\ndelinquent properties in Arkansas are redeemed by the\nowner either before the tax sale or within 30 days\nafter. So we don't know how many notices came back\nunclaimed after the first attempt.\nJUSTICE BREYER: His wife is living in the\nhouse?\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: She was.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Were they divorced?\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: No. They were separated.\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. So he owns the\nhouse. She doesn't. She must not pay any taxes, and\nshe sees these letters coming from him registered and\nsays, oh, they're his problem. That's basically what\ncould have happened.\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: Basically, Justice Breyer,\nbut the -- the letters --\nJUSTICE BREYER: If you have that kind of\nrelationship with your wife, doesn't he have an\nobligation to watch what's going on?\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: Yes, he does have some\nobligation to watch what's going on.\nBut I would like to point out that the\nletters did not actually come to the house. There were\nthree delivery attempts for each letter, but the\nletters themselves -- nobody was at home during the day\nwhen the letter carrier came by. So the letters\nthemselves were not left.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Did they leave a notice?\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: If the letter carrier\nfollowed proper procedures, a notice would have been\nleft, but there's nothing in the record to indicate one\nway or the other whether that happened.\nBut at most, that notice would say that there\nwas a certified letter for Gary Jones and it may have\nsaid that it was sent by the Commissioner of State\nLands. It didn't say tax delinquent notice. The\ncounty is who assesses the taxes. Many lay people\nmight think that the Land Commissioner of Arkansas was\nwriting about the parks or the State forests or any\nnumber of things. So I don't think we can charge Mrs.\nJones with knowledge that there was a tax delinquent\nnotice waiting for Mr. Jones just because, if the\nletter carrier did what he or she should have, a notice\nof delivery slip would have been left at the house.\nBut remember also that after the first notice\ncame back, it was 3 years later when they sent the\nnotice of the negotiated sale, and that was after they\nknew that it was likely a futile gesture to send\ncertified mail to Mr. Jones at that address, and it was\nafter they had actually gone out and visited the house.\nSo at a minimum, they should have posted a\nnotice at the property. And while in some cases like\nGreene v. Lindsey or Schroeder v. City of New York,\nposting was inadequate, and the Court said that mail\nwould have been better, at least here, knowing that\nmail had not worked, even if the State chose not to\nsearch for a better address, at a minimum they should\nhave posted a notice at the property and that would\nhave made all the difference in this case.\nIf there are no further questions, I'd like\nto reserve my time.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Phillips, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nIt's somewhat startling to me that in a case\ninvolving the fundamental question of what notice is due\nunder the Due Process Clause, that the phrase,\nreasonably calculated to provide notice to the affected\nproperty owner, was never used in the petitioner's\nsubmission because at least, as I remember Mullane I\nsuppose from my law school days and -- and since then,\nthat is the fundamental test. The question is has the\nState undertaken to -- to make a reasonable calculation\nto, in fact, provide notice under these circumstances.\nIt's sort of startling to me in the -- in the\nface of a decision like this Court wrote in Mennonite\nBoard, where it says explicitly, you know, the minor\ninconvenience and administrative burden of using the\nregular mails is a complete answer to claims that\nsomething less than that should be provided.\nAnd again, petitioner's counsel's first answer\nto the question, would ordinary mail have been\nsufficient under these circumstances, is no. For\nproperty like this, that's not sufficient. It seems to\nme that -- that the Dusenbery case answers that because\nwhile it was true that the mails that were sent\noriginally to the prison itself were certified, there's\nno certification process to get the mails --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Maybe this day -- in today's\nworld, a registered letter is worse than ordinary mail.\nThat is, I don't think -- my understanding is that the\npost office, unlike FedEx and unlike UPS, if you're not\nhome, they leave a -- a notice, you know, and you check\na box, and if you check the box, they'll leave it off\nthe next day. We don't live in a -- my wife isn't\nhome. My wife works. And -- and most wives no longer\nstay home to get the mail, and we don't all have\nbutlers at the door.\nAnd you call up the post office. They say,\noh -- if you get through to a human being, which takes\n15 minutes, after you go through the menu, they say,\nphone the post office branch. And they say go get in\nthe car, find a parking place, get in the line, and\nthere's half a morning gone.\nNow, why is that a reasonable way? Why can't\nthey do what FedEx does? This is a world -- husband\nworks, wife works, two children are screaming. We've\ngot to get them to the doctor. We have to have them at\nschool. They have appointments all morning, and\nthere's nobody home.\nSo whatever they did with Mullane and said\nregistered mail is fine, why isn't it unreasonable to\nuse that system rather than use FedEx's system?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean, that's a pretty\nremarkable due process constitutional --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, why not? It says\ncalculated. It may be. Now, you tell me why it's so\nremarkable because I think I could take judicial notice\nof what life is like for most families in the world\ntoday, that they don't have butlers, et cetera.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I may -- I may let Mr. Feldman\ndefend the -- the Postal Service because he is the\nSolicitor General's lawyer.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. PHILLIPS: But the reality is that for\nthe vast majority of the mails, the mails do get\nthrough. And -- and it is a reasonable calculation\nthat if you mail something to someone --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- that it will get there and\nit will be properly delivered. That's the -- the\npurpose of the certification.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the whole point\n-- at least I understand -- of Justice Breyer's\nquestion is that you have taken a step to make it more\ndifficult for the mail to get through by insisting that\nthe person be there to sign for it, and it's obviously\nmore likely than not he's not going to be there. And\nif you had just used regular mail and dropped it off, I\nthink more likely he would have gotten it.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, the -- the purpose of\nusing certified mail is to make sure that it actually\ngot to the person --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. The purpose of\ncertified mail is to make sure you know if it didn't\nget to the person. And you knew that and then you\ndidn't do anything about it.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, now it works both ways,\nthough, Mr. Chief Justice, because if -- if it goes to\nmy neighbor -- let's assume numbers are transposed --\nit goes to my neighbor and the neighbor is there and\nsees the information, they'll say that the -- that\nthat's -- that goes to across the street. And then you\ntake it across the street and you get it signed.\nThat's because you talked to a specific individual. So\nit is, in fact, designed to enhance the likelihood that\nit will actually get there.\nBut I don't think the issue here is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Wait. Let -- let them do\nthat. Fine. Just have a little box and the person\nsigns and says, tomorrow leave it at the house, just\nlike FedEx does.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. PHILLIPS: And as a matter of policy, I\nwouldn't necessarily disagree with that.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: This is the FedEx rule of\ndue process.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: This is the FedEx rule of\ndue process.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. PHILLIPS: That's exactly what it is.\nAnd as I say, as a matter of policy, Justice Breyer, I\nwouldn't necessarily disagree with it. But as a matter\nof what the Constitution strait-jackets States to\nprovide, it strikes me as a -- as a pretty\nextraordinary rule.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But is the Chief Justice\nnot correct that ordinary mail is more apt to get to\nthe destination than certified mail?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, if it is, it's probably\nonly at a -- at a marginal number. My guess is --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But even if it's marginal --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- the percentages are very\nsmall.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- the -- the principal\npurpose of the certified mail is to let the sender know\nwhether or not the notice was received. It would seem\nthat a State that decides to -- to make it necessary in\nevery case to find that answer should have some -- some\npurpose in doing so and -- and, therefore, some follow-\nup that would occur when it's not delivered.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, except for this problem\n-- I mean, the other problem you have is that we don't\n-- all we know is that it wasn't -- it -- it came back\nunclaimed. So we don't even know that it didn't get\ndelivered. All we know is that no one was prepared to\nsign for it and accept it.\nWe don't know, as Justice Breyer's\nhypothetical --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, but you also know\nthat nobody got the notice. If nobody signed for it\nand took it, nobody read the letter.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, you could look at the --\nyou could look at the outside and say, I'm not going to\nsign for this, and it's unclaimed.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Well, you would know that\nthe letter was not opened and read by the addressee.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, to be sure, I know that\nit wasn't opened and read, but all I'm saying is that\nwhat we don't -- we don't even know --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And if it isn't opened and\nread --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- that Justice Breyer is\ncorrect.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: -- if it isn't opened and\nread, they didn't get notice. They didn't get actual\nnotice.\nMR. PHILLIPS: They didn't receive actual\nnotice. And, of course, this Court has routinely said\nthat there's no constitutional requirement that they\nreceive actual notice.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask one other\nquestion I intended to ask your opponent? How many\nStates have rules that require something more?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I -- I think in their reply\nbrief at least, they make an effort, and we didn't go\nand -- and do a 50-State survey between a week ago and\nnow to find out. But, you know, a fair number of\nStates do. I -- I would say 15, 20.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Including -- including\nArkansas. Didn't Arkansas change its law so now it\nrequires if you -- if it's unclaimed, they have to do\npersonal service?\nMR. PHILLIPS: If it's their homestead, not\n-- not for every property that is -- for which taxes\nare not paid, but for --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: This taxpayer, though --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- for property -- I'm sorry?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: This taxpayer -- even\nthough he failed to give notice of his current address,\nthis taxpayer would be entitled under the current\nstatute to personal service.\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, Justice Ginsburg, I don't\nbelieve that is true because this is not this\ntaxpayer's homestead. He no longer lives at this\naddress. He, as his -- as his argument, spends a great\ndeal of time explaining --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought he still lived\nin --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- he lives elsewhere.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought he still lived\nin Arkansas.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, he lives in Arkansas,\nbut that doesn't make this his homestead.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Homestead.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I see.\nMR. PHILLIPS: So he wouldn't -- he wouldn't\nqualify for the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Right.\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- for the additional law.\nBut again -- and it seems to me that just\ndemonstrates the wisdom of Justice Brandeis' reference\nto the small laboratories because what we -- what we\nhave here are a raft of different approaches that the\nStates take to give either more or less notice so long\nas you satisfy the constitutional minimum. The problem --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, counsel, one\nthing you did -- your client did was provide notice by\npublication in a local newspaper.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why do you bother\ndoing that?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, in part because we --\nwe're putting out a notice to the public that we're\nselling the property. So it serves two purposes. It\nnotifies that there's a sale to take place. It also\nidentifies the landowner, giving -- or the property\nowner one more opportunity --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't -- you\ndon't rely on that as in any way discharging your\nconstitutional obligation to provide notice to the --\nto the homeowner.\nMR. PHILLIPS: On its own, it clearly\nwouldn't suffice. The Court has decided that a long\ntime -- I mean, that is Mullane.\nBut I think as an -- as an additional\ncomponent, if you -- if you really want to get into the\ntotality of the circumstances rather than what I think\nis the better rule, which is to say, as you evaluate\nwhat we did, was it reasonably calculated to provide\nnotice, and conclude, yes, it was reasonably calculated\nto provide notice under this Court's rulings that\nmailing is an appropriate way to proceed, I think we\nwould win there.\nIf you go beyond that and say, well, no, you\nhave to do something-plus, if you go down the\nreasonably diligent efforts kind of an approach, I\nwould say then don't go any further than say that\nyou're required to publish the fact of the sale itself\nbecause to go beyond that is -- is to open this. And\n-- and we've already seen this --\nJUSTICE BREYER: See what you think of this.\nIf in fact the letter --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What would you think of a\nrule that said --\nMR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What would you think of a\nrule that said if you use certified mail and it returns\nuncollected, the additional step you must take, you\njust send ordinary mail?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I think if the Court were to\nsay the -- the additional step you must take is to send\nordinary mail, we could probably live with that kind of\na rule. The problem is, one, that's not the standard\nthat's been proposed here. Their standard is going to\nbe and if it turns out that you find out after that\nthat that didn't get delivered, then you have to go\nthrough this litany. You have to -- you have to engage\nin posting. You have to contact the occupant and\ncontact the relatives, contact their employers, retain\na skip tracing service, use the telephone directory,\nrun a credit check, although we don't have Social\nSecurity numbers, do an Internet search. And each time\nwhen it comes back that there's some indication that\nyou didn't -- that they didn't receive notice, which\nthey'll always say is because -- otherwise for -- for a\nproperty that is valuable, if I had received notice, I\nwould have shown up. You have an ongoing, continuing\nobligation to find --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, but skip that. What\nabout -- you know, I was thinking precisely the same,\nbut just with slight -- if you get the letter back\nand you don't have the FedEx rule, you either have to\nhave the FedEx rule or send a letter.\nMR. PHILLIPS: It sounds like you're\nlegislating, Justice Breyer.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, because the purpose is\nto get reasonably calculated to get notice, and in the\nworld today, there are an awful lot of houses where\nnobody is home, you know, and there's no convenient way\nfor them to go to the post office without giving up a\ncertain amount of work. And so they say, forget it.\nIf it comes from the lands division or something, who\ncares? Now, that -- I don't know how you'd know how\nmany there are like that, but it's a question of\nreasonable calculation now to get the mail through.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, it seems to me, Justice\nBreyer, you're adopting a rule that's designed to\nprotect a very, very tiny minority and to impose a\nburden, a significant burden, on every State.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is it a tiny minority --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not even sure it\nprotects that minority. I think there are a lot of\npeople who won't be home when the -- when the postman\ncomes with the -- with the registered letter, but there\nare very few who -- who won't take the trouble to -- to\npick it up. I mean, it may be --\nMR. PHILLIPS: And -- and the flip side of\nthat is there's nothing that indicates why even -- even\nthe person -- if somebody is unwilling to go -- to take\nthe time to find out what the Commissioner of Lands in\nthe State has sent a certified letter for, why is it --\nwhy would you assume that whenever the letter comes in\nwhen it's addressed to Mr. Jones, that Mrs. Jones isn't\ngoing to toss it aside just as quickly?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Can --\nMR. PHILLIPS: There's no -- there's nothing\nthat indicates one way or the other what -- what is a\npreferable system to operate. And that's why I think\nthis is intensely a legislative judgement.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But isn't there a second\npurpose for -- for sending it certified mail? And that\nis, it assures that it doesn't get lost. I think they\ntrack it closer. They can tell you where the letter\nis. I think each post office has to record that\nthey've received it and so forth.\nMR. PHILLIPS: They do. That -- that's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Whereas if you just sent it\nregular mail, it may have been lost.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right. That -- that's always --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This -- this assures that it\nreaches the destination.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Yes. That --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose -- suppose we had\na case where the homeowner has kept the Lands\nCommissioner informed of her current address, does\neverything she was supposed to do except at the time\nthis notice, certified mail notice -- at the time of\nthe delivery attempt, she's hospitalized having a\nquadruple bypass, so she never gets it. And then what\n-- what are the consequences of that?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean, I don't want --\nI don't want to fight the hypothetical, but you have to\nput a little in context in a case like this because the\nprocess here is one that's fairly protracted. You get\nthe first notice and then there's not -- there's no\nactual sale for 2 years. And in this case, the sale\ndidn't take place, so there was -- you know, the\nauction didn't lead to anything, and then there was\nanother -- another sale. So we're talking about\nessentially a 3-year period of time when the person has\nto be incapacitated, during which presumably -- and\nthere have been multiple, six different efforts to try\nto send notice to her. So it's, you know, one, not a\nparticularly likely hypothetical. I realize I\nshouldn't fight it.\nBut two, I think at the end of the day, the\nanswer is you can't put the burden on the State to\nunderstand the -- the precise situation of each of the\nindividual homeowners, that they have some duties\nbecause they know, one, they do owe taxes; two, in\nArkansas they should know that they owe us a duty to\nkeep us up-to-date with respect to their situation, and\nwhere -- and where it is that we can reach them. And\nso it's reasonable to impose those duties --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But your --\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- because in the vast\nmajority of cases -- I'm sorry -- due process will be\nsatisfied because notice will, in fact, be received.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But your -- your\nposition is, though, when you get the certified\nletter returned is you have no obligation to do\nanything further.\nMR. PHILLIPS: That's correct, because --\nbecause the difficulty is once you go past that, what\n-- what obligation you have becomes completely\nunknowable at that stage.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But it seems to me that\neven you might not have an obligation, it seemed to me\nyou would have a motivation to do more because you want\nto collect your taxes.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, and that's -- that --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Which is sort of puzzling\nto me as why the States don't have a -- an affirmative\ninterest in providing the best notice that they can.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Justice Stevens, the truth is\nmost of them -- we do. And -- and this is not a -- and\n-- and look at the way the system operates here. It's\nnot like we -- we sent out this notice, got back, and\nraced off to sell the property with a gotcha in hand.\nI mean, we -- we went through a very protracted process\neach time trying to get this person to -- to show up.\nI mean, put this into a certain amount of\ncontext. And again, you have to deal with the\ngenerality of cases rather than this one, but I mean,\nthis is a property that's got a tax lien on it already\nfor unpaid income taxes of -- of approximately, I\nthink, about $14,000, and then it has unpaid property\ntaxes, you know, up to the -- up to the total amount of\n$200. And you know, under those circumstances, we let\nit sit there for years. I mean, there's no question we\nwould be better served if -- if they would have shown\nup and just paid off the taxes.\nBut it seems to me that all goes into the\ncalculation of what's the right answer as a legislative\nmatter, and legislatures have made pretty reasonable\nadjustments in terms of, you know, how strong is -- I\nmean, I think what Arkansas did here. If this is your\nhomestead, we're going to go just as far as you said,\nJustice Stevens, to try to make sure we get the\ninformation to you.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it of any --\nMR. PHILLIPS: If it's not, then we're not --\nI'm sorry.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it of any relevance to\nconsider the burden or the obligations this rule\nthat petitioners advocate place on downstream\npurchasers?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Oh, I think absolutely because\nit's significantly undermines the State's overall\neffort in trying to get its money back because it's all\nwell and good to say we can sell the property, but if\nnobody is going to pay for the property anything that\ncomes close to the value of even getting our liens paid\noff, then we're not going to get the revenue stream\nthat we would otherwise be entitled to. And even if\nyou, you know, go through the -- through the kind of\nmachinations of --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, you would get the\nwhole -- you'd just get a little bit less because the\ncost of notice is borne by the purchaser and if they\nhave to do a Google search or use one of these other\nservices, it's going to add a little bit more to their\ncost, and you're just going to get a little bit less.\nIt's not going to interfere with the administration of\nthe program.\nMR. PHILLIPS: That assumes that there's a --\nthat there's a purchaser that wants to undertake the\nburden and -- and to assume that risk.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: For getting the\nproperty --\nMR. PHILLIPS: I mean, we couldn't sell this\nthe first time out.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- for getting the\nproperty in this case, we're at 20 percent of its\nmarket value. It's -- it's worth another $500 to you.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, it's\nworth taking at least 2 seconds to focus on the market\nvalue argument here, this $80,000 number. That was a\nnumber that arises in connection with the supersedeas\nbond, and it's only a number that came forward by the\nprivate loan -- property purchaser, not the State. And\nthe reason was, was because they said, if you don't put\nup an $80,000 bond, we want to take over the property\nimmediately. And so they had every incentive to say a\nnumber that was significantly higher than what the\nvalue of this property is.\nThe best evidence of what the value of this\nproperty is is around the $20,000 that a real purchaser\nput on the table in order to purchase it. The point\nhere --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no, no. That's\n-- Mr. Phillips, property bought at -- at delinquent\ntax sales is usually bought at far less than its market\nvalue.\nMR. PHILLIPS: I'd be willing to stipulate to\nthat, Mr. Chief Justice, but the truth is nobody showed\nup even for an auction on this property. So we don't\nhave much in the way of evidence as to the value of it.\nAnd all I'm saying is the suggestion of -- of\n$80,000 as the relevant number here is a number that's\npicked out of the air for a purpose that has nothing to\ndo with fair market value. It has to do with the value\nof a -- of a bond that would have to be issued in order\nto stop the transfer of possession of the property in\nthe ejectment action.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Your -- your friend said\nthat the $80,000 comes from the fact that it -- at the\n-- at the auction, it -- the opening bid is one-quarter\nof the fair market value. He said something like that.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, it has to be -- I think\nit has to be a minimum that, but you know, it could be\n100 percent of the fair market value.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well -- well, was the\nopening bid $20,000? So it was at least one-quarter of\nthe --\nMR. PHILLIPS: Right, but it could also be\n100 percent.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I see.\nMR. PHILLIPS: So you don't know. And -- and\nin his brief, his argument was that we -- that there\nwas a stipulation to the $80,000.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: And the $20,000 would have\nbeen a permissible bid even if the market value was\n$40,000.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Exactly. That -- that's the\nonly point I was trying to make on that score.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Would your argument be any\ndifferent if there weren't a statutory obligation to\nkeep the government informed of the -- of one's mailing\naddress?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I think I would still make the\nsame argument. I just think the argument has\nextraordinary force when the -- when the petitioner has\nan obligation to provide us with notice because, again,\nit goes -- you know, why is this reasonably calculated?\nIt's -- it's in the context of a scheme that says you\nwill provide us specific information and we will rely\nupon that as the mechanism by which we inform you of\nyour obligations to us and that under those\ncircumstances and only those circumstances, do you\nforfeit your property rights.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But it seems to me\nunrealistic to assume that the average citizen would\nknow that duty more clearly than he'd know the duty to\npay his taxes.\nMR. PHILLIPS: The -- the only reason he\nwould know that duty is because every -- every property\ntax form has on it a change of address at the very\nbottom of it that's perforated. So every time you get\na tax form, you get a thing that says change your --\nlet me know if you've changed your address.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is there a provision of\nArkansas law that if in fact they do track down the\nproperty owner and he is at an address different from\nthe last address that he had given, that the expense of\ntracking him down may be charged to him, along with the\ndelinquent taxes, penalties, and so on?\nMR. PHILLIPS: The -- the statute talks about\ncosts, but the State has never interpreted that term to\nmean just sort of the out-of-pocket -- those kinds of\ninchoate costs, and they usually talk about very\nspecific costs like the cost of noticing publication\nand other -- you know, other items that you can -- you\nknow, where you have a receipt.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So in practice the answer is\nno?\nMR. PHILLIPS: In practice the answer is no.\nIf there are no other questions, Your Honors,\nI urge the Court to affirm.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nPhillips.\nMr. Feldman.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. FELDMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe notice that was provided in this case\nsatisfies the Mullane reasonably calculated test.\nFirst, the State sent it by certified mail.\nCertified mail -- actually in response to a question\nthat came up earlier, the form -- when certified mail\nis -- is delivered and the recipient is not there, they\nleave a form 3849. That form isn't in the record, but\nI think it's probably available from any post office.\nOn the reverse side, it says, we will redeliver or your\nagent can pick up your mail at the post office, and it\nhas a place for the person to check off a box saying to\nredeliver and leaves instructions to leave this where\nthe postman can find it.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but redeliver -- you\nhave to be there to sign for it again.\nMR. FELDMAN: Right, but they --\nJUSTICE BREYER: All right. Well, then --\nthen the problem --\nMR. FELDMAN: They do need a signature.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- I'm thinking -- what I'm\nthinking is that where -- where you're trying to reach\na person, the means has to be reasonably calculated.\nI'm simply saying a means today is not reasonably\ncalculated to reach the average person unless it gives\nhim the choice of getting it when he's not home. All\nright?\nNow, there are two ways that could happen.\nOne, you could modify that form or, second, the simple\nrule would be if it comes back undelivered, mail them a\nletter.\nMR. FELDMAN: The Court -- I believe that\ncertified mail is -- is a more reliable method than\nfirst class mail because it requires the mailperson,\nthe carrier, to get to -- get a signature at -- at --\nhe has to go from a particular person. He can't\ndeliver it to the wrong place. Also, the post office\nitself has means whereby the carrier has to keep track\nof how many receipts he's supposed to have, whether\nhe's brought them back and so on.\nJUSTICE BREYER: I didn't say all that.\nMR. FELDMAN: And --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I said do either. What I --\nwhat I was thinking of, which isn't clearly I think\ncoming across, is send it certified mail, by all means.\nFine. He either has to sign and say, leave it off\ntomorrow, I'm not home, or if the post office doesn't\nmake that available, then if the letter comes back\nundelivered, the person who's trying to send him notice\nhas to send him an ordinary letter.\nMR. FELDMAN: And if the Court were to adopt\nthat rule, it would give States an enormous incentive\nand people giving notice to just send things by first\nclass mail in the first instance, which this Court has\nrepeatedly said and has -- has said is -- is sufficient\nto satisfy due process, including in cases involving\ntax sales in the Mennonite case, condemnation of\nproperty in the -- in the City of New York case, and\nsimilar kinds of events.\nCertified -- what the State did here, though,\nit has always -- it has generally been thought that\ncertified mail is a more reliable means of giving\npeople notice, and that's what the State used here.\nAnd I don't -- I don't take petitioner to be arguing\nthat they made a mistake because they used certified\nmail rather than First class mail.\nHaving said that, the State also sent the\nmail to the only address, probably the only address\nanywhere in the public record. What it needed was\nsomething that tied this person to this address, not to\nsomebody named Gary Jones somewhere in the State or the\nworld. And probably the only thing in the --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course, none of\nthis would have been sufficient if we were talking\nabout your -- your client, the IRS. They do far more\nextensive effort to find the individual before they\nsell property for delinquent taxes.\nMR. FELDMAN: I say they -- they do slightly\nmore. What the IRS does do is there is a requirement\nand Congress can provide and other States can provide\nthat more resources should be spent in something like\nthis than the minimum due process floor. But what\nthey've provided is that where the property owner is in\nthe IRS district, then -- then personal service is what\nthey first attempt. Where the -- where the property\nowner is not in the Internal Revenue district, then\nthey do exactly what the State did, which is they send\nit via certified mail. And they check up -- I think\nthey check a postal database of change of address\nforms.\nBut we know in this case that there was no\nchange of address form because when the letter came\nback, it didn't come back saying, moved, here's the new\naddress or -- or change of address form expired.\nIn any event, this was probably the only\nthing in the public record that tied this taxpayer to\nthis property, and that's what the State used. And\nthen it further used publication and sent another\nnotice. There was a total of six different times when\nthe mail carrier attempted to -- to deliver it and, if\nhe followed the postal regulations -- there's no reason\nto think he didn't -- left a notice on the door.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, which way is\nthat -- I mean, the fact that he tried six times and he\nwasn't there should have told the State this isn't\nworking.\nMR. FELDMAN: Well, right, but the State\nunder the Dusenbery case is not obligated to provide\nactual notice. The State is obligated to provide\nnotice reasonably calculated to let the person know\nwhat's going on, and if the person is not responding to\na notice from the Commissioner of State Lands and going\nto the post office to pick it up or asking for it to be\nredelivered, I don't think this Court has ever\nsuggested that in those circumstances, the notice is --\nis inappropriate because the -- the landowner hasn't\ntaken the steps that he should have taken to -- to, in\nfact, I think a -- a large part of what petitioner's\nargument here is, is really at bottom an attack on\nDusenbery. Dusenbery said -- the Court held actual\nnotice is not required. What's required is just notice\nreasonably calculated to reach someone.\nBut under petitioner's rule here, the State,\nas soon as it finds out some doubt -- and that's all it\nhad here -- some doubt about whether it had the right\naddress because it may well have had the correct\naddress and he didn't go to the post office to pick it\nup. As soon as it had some doubt about whether it had\nthe right address, it has to take unspecified further\nsteps to send it out again to another address, and if\nthat doesn't work, presumably another address and\nanother address. And each -- whatever method, whether\nit's a directory or the Internet or whatever method it\nuses, it's -- it's going to create a litigable issue\nabout whether did it do the right thing, did it use the\nright Internet service, did it use the right telephone\ndirectory, did it go in a wide enough area, should it\nhave done the whole country.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but your\nposition is they don't have to do anything.\nMR. FELDMAN: Yes, our position is that the\nstandard is if it was reasonably calculated to provide\nnotice at the time it was sent, which in this case it\nwas -- they used the only address in the public record\nthat ties him to this property, and their belief that\nthey had the right address was supported by the State\nlaw that said he has to provide them with a change of\naddress. That under those circumstances, they've done\nenough, and if it comes back and just says, well, he\ndidn't pick it up at the post office, then that's --\nthen they've satisfied the rudimentary --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, Mullane said\nthat we look to what a person who really wanted to find\nthe person would do. A person who really wanted to\nfind Mr. Jones and got the certified letter back\nsaying, nobody is claiming this, would have done\nsomething more.\nMR. FELDMAN: I -- I don't think that that's\nnecessarily true. And -- and Mullane also said that\nwhat the -- whoever it was who had to provide the\nnotice in that case had to do was provide notice to the\naddresses. The addresses were at hand was the phrase\nthat it used.\nAnd in other cases, the Court has talked\nabout the line between publication notice, on the one\nhand, and notice by mail. That line is a line of\naddresses that are very easily ascertainable. If\nthey're very easily ascertainable, you have to send the\nmail. If not, then that's what publication notice is\nfor.\nAnd it seems to me in this case, when the\nnotice came back unclaimed, then the State was entitled\nto assume that either it had provided notice and he\njust didn't want to pick it up or, at worst, that his\naddress was no longer very easily ascertainable, and at\nthat point his obligation was only to publish notice,\nwhich it did.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Which -- which you\nagree does no good at all. Right?\nMR. FELDMAN: I don't agree it does no good\nat all. I --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When is the last time\nyou read legal notices in a newspaper?\nMR. FELDMAN: I don't ordinarily do it.\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Have you ever done\nit?\nMR. FELDMAN: I -- I can't recall.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. FELDMAN: But I --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I think a lot of people who\nbuy property at tax sales do read those notices\nregularly.\nMR. FELDMAN: What I was going to say is I\nthink that every year, I'm confident that there's home\n-- there's people throughout the country probably who\nare notified of -- of tax sales and things like that\nbecause someone sees it, someone lets them know.\nThey're keeping an eye on that to see what's happening\nto their property. He had left his property without\nleaving a change of address form with the State, and it\n-- it is possible.\nNow, notice by publication is not preferred,\nbut what -- the line that's drawn in Mullane and the\nCourt's other cases are where the address is very\neasily ascertainable or readily available or at hand\nversus where it's not. And unless the Court is going\nto say, well, that line has to be -- it's going to\noverrule cases that -- that have actually drawn that\nline, such as Mullane itself that permitted publication\nnotice to some people, then I think the result follows\nhere that when the notice came back unclaimed, that was\n-- the State was permitted to go ahead with the sale.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But Mullane, as Mr.\nKirkpatrick pointed out, involved masses of people.\nThis was a common trust fund, and the reliance was on\nthat a goodly number of them would get notice and they\nwere kind of stand-ins for the ones who didn't. But\nhere, we're dealing with a single individual.\nMR. FELDMAN: Right. That's true, but the\nCourt has also permitted notice by publication where\nother -- I mean, it has always drawn the line of notice\nof publication versus notice by mail at where the\naddress is very easily ascertainable.\nBut I would say that what -- the government's\ninterest, the most important interest here, is in\nknowing what it's supposed to do. If you -- if there's\nan open-ended standard that says, well, it just has to\nkeep doing something, then either it's -- well, then\nthe result of that predictably is going to be the\ngovernment is going to never be able to be satisfied\nunless it gives in-hand notice or --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why isn't -- why isn't the\nsimple answer to that concern to say, look, there's no\nway to tell in advance or, you know, by any general\nrule, at least not legislatively, how far they've got\nto go to try to find the correct address, but they know\nwhere the house is and they've got at that point to go\nto the house and put a notice on the door? That's\nsimple, easy. Why -- why isn't that the answer?\nMR. FELDMAN: May I respond to that?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure.\nMR. FELDMAN: I just have two quick things.\nOne is in the Greene against Lindsey case and\n-- I can't remember the name of the other case. In the\nGreene against Lindsey case, the Court said that --\nthat kind of notice has its own problems. The IRS and\nState authorities have had problems with posting notice\nin cases where the owners are not often happy to see\nagents from the government trying to collect\ntaxes. That can actually be rather expensive.\nAnd the Arkansas Supreme Court itself said\nthat the State itself frequently doesn't have the\naddress for the property. It has only the legal\ndescription and it would be a significant burden to\nfind it.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nFeldman.\nMr. Kirkpatrick, you have 4 minutes\nremaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL T. KIRKPATRICK\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: Thank you, Mr. Chief\nJustice.\nFirst, I'd just like to point out that it\nabsolutely is in the State's interest to provide the\nbest notice practicable for three reasons.\nFirst, redemption of property by the owner is\nthe most efficient and cost effective means for the\nState to collect the back taxes.\nSecond, the State has an interest in\nprotecting its citizens from a loss of assets in\nequity, like what was lost by Mr. Jones here.\nAnd third, if notice is received because of\nfollow-up efforts or if the State can show that it has\nmade follow-up efforts, then it will not face\nchallenges based on inadequate notice.\nIn terms of the feasibility of doing\nsomething more, the question was raised about other\nStates. Certainly many States do more. We've listed\nabout five or six States that actually have a statutory\nscheme that deals with what happens when initial mailed\nnotice comes back. And in footnote 9 and footnote 10\nof the reply brief, we indicate States that require\nposting and States that require notice to occupants.\nJustice Souter, with regard to your question\nabout the cost of tracking down a better address or\nproviding notice, those costs can be passed on to the\nredeemer or purchaser of the property. And if we look\nat the statute dealing with notice to homestead owners,\nit says that where the mail does not work, the\nadditional cost of the notice by personal service of\nprocess will be paid by the owner of the homestead who\nredeems. So certainly they could pass along those\ncosts. They could pass along the costs of searching\nfor a better address just like we do in the Freedom of\nInformation Act context when we charge for Government\nemployee time to search for records.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: With -- with respect\nto the fact that your client did not alert the State to\nits change of address, is there anything in the record\nabout whether that his separation was permanent or is\nthat a gradual thing? I mean, did he not know if this\nwas a permanent change of address or what?\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: There's nothing in the\nrecord about that, Your Honor, but certainly when he\nfirst moved out, he did not know what the future would\nhold in terms of the length of that separation.\nNow, it -- it is also not in the record, but\nhe did, in fact, file a change of address form, a\nforwarding form, but it had long expired before these\ncertified letters came. That was actually a mistake on\nthe part of the letter carrier not to say, forwarding\norder expired. And while a forwarding order is only\ngood for 18 months, there is the national change of\naddress database which reveals those things for a\nperiod of 4 years. So that's something else the State\ncould have checked.\nAlso, this is not an attack on Dusenbery.\nThis would be Dusenbery all over again if Mrs. Jones\nhad signed for the letter and the State had gotten back\nthe green card saying that letter was received by\nsomebody at 717 North Bryan Street. Then it would be\nDusenbery. This is not Dusenbery because the\ndifference is in Dusenbery they knew that the letter\nwas actually received at the facility where Mr.\nDusenbery was incarcerated. Here, the State actually\nknew that the letter had never been received.\nWith regard to value of the property, that\n$80,000 figure is not picked out of the air. It's\ntrue, as Mr. Phillips said, that the parties stipulated\nthat that was the market value of the property, but in\nfact, by statute -- and that's Arkansas Code Annotated\nsection 26-26-303 -- the assessed value of property\ncannot exceed 20 percent of the market value. The\nminimum bid was the assessed value, plus the interest,\nplus the penalties, plus the costs of notice. Ms.\nFlowers, in her negotiated purchase offer, made the\nminimum bid plus $200.\nWith regard to the fact that the letter came\nback unclaimed, I'd just like to point out that it -- I\nsee my time is up.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You may finish.\nMR. KIRKPATRICK: That it was not marked\nrefused. So it did not indicate that somebody saw the\nletter and didn't want to take it.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
