Martinez.\nMr. McConnell.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL W. McCONNELL\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. McCONNELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may\nit please the Court:\nIf Hastings is correct, a student who does\nnot even believe in the Bible is entitled to demand to\nlead a Christian Bible study, and if CLS does not\npromise to allow this, the college will bar them from its\nforum for speech.\nThe First Amendment -- under the First\nAmendment, rights run the opposite way. Hastings is the\ngovernment; CLS is private. A public forum for speech\nmust be open and inclusive, but participants in the\nforum are entitled to their own voice.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Now, these are fundamental\narguments, and I don't want to spend too much time on\nfactual matters because that's frustrating to both the\nCourt and the counsel.\nBut we do have the problem of the\nstipulation. The stipulation makes it clear that\nDemocrats and Republicans can both get into the other\none's club. That's the Stipulations 17 and 18 at 220 of the\nJoint Appendix. You want to get away from the\nstipulation by what, according to your reply brief,\nHastings said in its answer, but the stipulation\nsupersedes the answer.\nSo if both counsel could just address for a\nmoment: What is the case that we have here? You have\ndifferent views on what case is before us.\nMR. McCONNELL: Happy to, Justice Kennedy.\nIf you just look with me at Joint\nStipulation 17, I think it makes this completely clear.\nThat's on page 221 of the Joint Appendix, and it states:\n\"Both parties agreed that in order to become a\nregistered student organization a student organization's\nbylaws must provide that its membership is open to all\nstudents\" -- that's the all-comers policy -- \"and the\norganization must agree to abide by\" -- \"abide by the\nNondiscrimination Policy.\" That's capital N, capital P,\na defined term. The \"Nondiscrimination Policy\" is\ndefined in Joint Stipulation Number 15. That is what we\nhave been calling the written policy. And the idea that\nmembership must be open to all students is described in\nJoint Stipulation 18, which is simply a description of\nwhat that policy is.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But doesn't -- doesn't the\none -- isn't the all-comers policy broader than the\nnondiscrimination policy, so that if you comply with\nthat you automatically comply with everything in the\nnondiscrimination clause?\nMR. McCONNELL: It is broader. It's our\nposition that either of these justifications for\nexcluding CLS is unconstitutional.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but -- but the latter,\nthe nondiscrimination policy, you assert is -- is not\nviewpoint neutral, that it has a particular impact upon\na religious organization; whereas, the other policy, the\nall-comers policy, applies to everybody, and that\nargument is not available to you.\nMR. McCONNELL: Justice Scalia, our\nargument -- there are two policies. They have invoked\nboth. We believe both are unconstitutional, but for\nslightly different reasons. The written policy is\nunconstitutional because it's overtly viewpoint\ndiscrimination -- discriminatory and thus violating\nthe principles of cases like Rosenberger and Widmar.\nThe all-comers --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But, Mr. McConnell,\nJustice Scalia had just made the point that the all-comers\npolicy overwhelms the other, so that I would like you to\ndeal up front with the all-comers policy that the dean\nin her deposition said, loud and clear: \"Our policy is\nall-comers. Yes, Republicans have to be admitted to the\nDemocratic group and vice versa.\" So unless you are\nchallenging the veracity of the dean after stipulating,\nas you did, that all-comers is the policy, I don't see\nhow we can listen to your argument about the so-called\nwritten policy.\nMR. McCONNELL: Well, both policies we contend\nare unconstitutional. Let's begin with the all-comers\npolicy, and when you conclude that it is\nunconstitutional, we will also need to deal with the\nother since they have two arrows in their quiver.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: You can do that, but you --\nit's a much different case if Hastings treats the CLS\ndifferently than it treats the Democratic and Republican\nClubs. That's a much different -- frankly, it's a much\neasier case for you. But it's -- it's frustrating for\nus not to know what kind of case we have in front of us.\nMR. McCONNELL: Your Honor, it's a case\nwhere the -- where Hastings has put forward two quite\ndifferent justifications for denying our right and both\nof them are unconstitutional.\nLet's begin with the all-comers policy.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Mr. McConnell, when I\nread -- when I read the papers that Hastings submitted\nto the district court at the same time that the joint\nstipulation was submitted, I saw one reference after\nanother to an allegation that Hastings was applying its\npolicy in a discriminatory manner, that it was not in\nfact insisting that all registered student organizations\nadmit all applicants. And when I read their brief in\nthe Ninth Circuit, I saw that point reiterated again and\nagain.\nSo that led me to believe that what was\nstipulated was not that in fact they had a policy which\nthey enforced under which anybody who applied to any\ngroup would be admitted, but that this was what Dean\nKane had announced. That was the stated policy, but not\nnecessarily the actual policy that was employed. And\nthat was the argument it seemed to me that CLS was\nmaking; isn't that correct?\nMR. McCONNELL: That's entirely correct,\nJustice -- Justice Alito. That's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you should -- if that\nwas it you should have brought in some -- some evidence\nof different treatment of other groups. And there --\nas I --\nMR. McCONNELL: Justice --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There is none of that\nexcept your citation of the bylaws of two groups in your\nbrief, as I --\nMR. McCONNELL: Well, but that is in fact the\nevidence. When --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But, Mr. McConnell, here\nis a statement, a stipulation. It's a stipulation for\nsummary judgment. It says: District Judge, you take\nthis to be the fact: Hastings requires that registered\nstudent organizations allow any student to participate,\nbecome a member, seek leadership positions in the\norganization. That is not qualified. It says:\nDistrict Judge, here are the facts that we stipulate.\nIt doesn't say this is what the dean says, but it's not\nreally enforced. It's not qualified at all.\nMR. McCONNELL: Justice Ginsburg, we -- we\nstipulated that this was their policy. That stipulation\ncontains nothing about the historical facts as to how\nHastings has actually applied it. But let's talk about\nthe policy, because it is unconstitutional --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I wish you would. You are\ngoing to waste your whole time just discussing this\nstipulation point. Let's assume -- let's assume that --\nMR. McCONNELL: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- the latter is the policy.\nMR. McCONNELL: Yes, because the policy is I\nthink blatantly unconstitutional. It is manifestly\noverbroad with respect to any purposes stated. And, of\ncourse, in Healy v. James, this Court held that any\nrestriction on a student speech forum may be no more\nextensive than is required by its purposes. It is also\na frontal assault on freedom of association. Freedom of\nassociation is the right to form around shared beliefs.\nTo say that groups may not form around shared beliefs --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So is this an exception\nthat you want to talk about as it is applied to\nreligious groups, or are you suggesting that if a group\nwanted to exclude all black people, all women, all\nhandicapped persons, whatever other form of\ndiscrimination a group wants to practice, that a school\nhas to accept that group and recognize it, give it funds,\nand otherwise lend it space?\nMR. McCONNELL: Not at all, Justice\nSotomayor. Our position is that --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So then, what is --\nwhat is wrong with the purpose of a school to say we don't\nwish any group that doesn't -- that discriminates?\nMR. McCONNELL: The stipulation is that they\nmay not exclude based on status or beliefs. We have\nonly challenged the beliefs, not status. Race, any\nother status basis Hastings is able to enforce. But\nthey may not tell a group --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So, what if the belief --\nMR. McCONNELL: -- that you just have to let\nyou in that don't agree with you.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What if the belief is that\nAfrican Americans are inferior?\nMR. McCONNELL: Again, I think they can\ndiscriminate on the basis of the belief, but not on\nthe basis of the status. So that if the --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You could have --\nMR. McCONNELL: -- if there were racist\norganizations --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- a student\norganization, I suppose, of that type. It wouldn't\ninclude many people. But if there were such an\norganization, I assume that they would have that -- that\nbelief required, right?\nMR. McCONNELL: That's right, but they could\nnot go the next step and exclude someone on the basis of\nstatus, under our --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Doesn't this say the\nopposite? It says we are -- you have to let anybody in --\nanybody -- regardless of their status or beliefs. So you can't\ndiscriminate on the basis of status or belief. That's\nwhat the policy says I just read. It doesn't say you\ncan; it says you can't.\nMR. McCONNELL: It's that the group may not\nconfine its leadership based upon its beliefs. That means\nthat --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's what you say, but\nthat's not what the policy says. The policy says that\nyou have to let everybody in, regardless of their status\nor belief.\nMR. McCONNELL: Right. And -- and our view is\nthat the status --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So you cannot discriminate on\nthe basis of status or belief.\nMR. McCONNELL: The status half of that is\nperfectly constitutional and --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You say you --\nMR. McCONNELL: -- the belief half of that is not.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- you have to -- you\nhave to let these organizations discriminate on the\nbasis of belief. And they say: No, we don't want to;\nthat's too complicated for us to figure out which ones\nwe should, which ones we shouldn't. We'd rather let them\nwork off-campus. We just don't want to get into this\nbusiness. It's not just against religion. It might be\nagainst a Turkish-speaking society that thinks Turkish\nis extremely important to speak or a chess club that\nthinks the same. It could be a lot of people.\nNow, why do you -- what's wrong with us, a First\nAmendment -- an organization itself affected with First\nAmendment interests, saying we just don't want to have\nthose on campus organizations, too much trouble.\nMR. McCONNELL: What is -- what is wrong with\nthat is that restrictions on a designated public forum must\nbe reasonable in light of the purposes of the forum. The\npurpose of the forum is set forth in Joint Stipulation\nNumber 8. It is to promote a diversity of viewpoints\namong registered student organizations. If the student\norganizations are not allowed to have a coherent set of\nbeliefs, there can be no diversity among them.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But this sounds like a\ndebate over whether the policy as the school believes it\nshould be implemented is not a good one. But isn't that\ntheir choice? Don't we give deference to an educational\ninstitution in terms of the choices it makes about\neffecting its own -- its purposes? And the purpose here\nis we don't want our students to discriminate.\nMR. McCONNELL: There is a stipulation as to\nwhat the purpose is, and the purpose is to promote a\ndiversity of viewpoints among registered student\norganizations.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And is --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That's their way of doing\nthat.\nMR. McCONNELL: It is a stipulated fact.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And Hastings takes the\nposition that it's all in favor of diversity, not only\namong the groups but within the groups. So --\nMR. McCONNELL: Which is not the joint\nstipulation. The stipulation is that the purpose of the\nforum is diversity among groups. Their policy is not --\nit's not only just unreasonable in light of it; it is\ncontrary to it.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It is that they --\nMR. McCONNELL: It defeats the purpose of the forum.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: They say, yes, we believe in\ndiversity among groups, but we also believe in diversity\nwithin the group; that's a good thing. They are not backing\noff from: We think diversity among groups is fine.\nMR. McCONNELL: They say that in their\nbrief, but that is not the stipulated fact in the\ncase.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Let me make an imaginary\nexample, and that's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where -- where is the\nstipulation?\nMR. McCONNELL: It's page 216 in the Joint\nAppendix, Joint Stipulation Number 8. It is the only\nstipulation in the case having to do with what the\npurpose is of the RSO forum.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wait a minute now. A\ndiversity --\nMR. McCONNELL: \"Hastings seeks to promote a\ndiversity of viewpoints among registered student\norganizations.\"\nAnd note how destructive an all-comers\npolicy directed on belief is toward -- toward that.\nThat means that if, for example, there's an NAACP\nchapter, it would have to allow a -- a racist skinhead\nto sit on -- in on its planning meetings. That means\nthat if there's an environmentalist club that has a\ndemonstration in Sacramento in favor of cap-and-trade\nlegislation, they would have to allow --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It may be --\nMR. McCONNELL: -- a global warming skeptic\nto --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It may be an ill-advised\npolicy, but the school says: It's our policy. It's\nworking fine, and all the -- the hypotheticals about\nsabotage, takeover, they haven't happened.\nMR. McCONNELL: They haven't happened\nbecause this policy came into being -- was announced for\nthe first time in 2005. So there couldn't possibly be\nany -- any record of that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This -- this was not the\npolicy on the basis of which CLS was excluded; is that\ncorrect?\nMR. McCONNELL: That's correct, it was not.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It -- when they were\nrefused participation in the -- in the student\norganization program, they were not told about the\nall-comers policy.\nMR. McCONNELL: That's correct. Joint\nStipulation Number 40 states clearly that the -- that the\n-- that they were informed, and I quote: \"They were\ninformed that CLS bylaws were not compliant with the\nreligion and sexual orientation provisions of the\nNondiscrimination Policy.\"\nJUSTICE ALITO: And was there any written\ndocument memorializing this policy prior to the time\nwhen the former dean gave her deposition?\nMR. McCONNELL: Never. And --\nJUSTICE ALITO: And is the -- is the policy\nas articulated by the dean in her deposition the same as\nthe policy that Hastings now claims it has in its brief?\nMR. McCONNELL: I don't think so. Every\ntime the policy is mentioned, it seems to morph into\nsomething else. When the dean announced it at the\ndeposition, she said all students may participate on\nthe -- in all activities, period, full stop. Now we\nfind out in their brief, well, their -- groups can have\nconduct limitations, they can require dues, they can\nhave attendance requirements, they can have competitive\ncontests to see whether they get in.\nThis -- this policy is -- it changes with\nevery wind.\nAnd -- but the fundamental problem with\nthis -- with this is what -- what this Court stated in\nVelazquez v. Legal Services Corporation, that you cannot\nallow -- you cannot allow the terms of the policy just\nto say that whatever their policy is, that that\ndetermines the contours of the program, because that\nwould render the First Amendment a -- a nullity.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course, that was not a\nreligion case. Your argument at its most fundamental\nlevel is that religious organizations are different\nbecause religion is all about belief. But at that point\ndon't we also have a tradition of separation? That's\nthe whole reason why church and state for many purposes\nare kept separate, so that States are not implicated\nwith religious beliefs.\nAnd it -- it -- it seems to me we have to\nconsider that when we are considering your argument.\nNow, you can cite Rosenberger, but -- but I think this is\ndifferent from that.\nMR. McCONNELL: The separation is between\nchurch and state, but this Court has held over and over\nagain that speech forums -- that people participating in\na speech forum are not the state. The state is\nHastings. We are perfectly private. There is nothing\nwrong with a religious organization, even on public --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're not --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Anyway, as I understand\nyour argument on the all-comers policy, it is not an\nargument that -- that is based upon the religious nature\nof CLS. You would make the same argument of\nunconstitutionality with respect to the student\nRepublican Club, wouldn't you?\nMR. McCONNELL: We would.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Or --\nMR. McCONNELL: Now, we do --\nthere is in addition a free exercise argument, but I\ndon't -- but in this case what the Free Exercise Clause\nprotects is exactly what the associational freedom test\nwould protect for everyone.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I had thought that an\nimportant part of the case, of your case, is that belief\nis inherent to the idea of religious expression and must\nbe protected. But if the protection causes problems\nwithin the school for other policies, then doesn't the\nseparation policy come into play? That's -- that's what\nI'm asking.\nMR. McCONNELL: Again, separation does not\napply to private parties when they are operating, even\non government property.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. McConnell, let's say\nit is the belief of this group, based on their reading\nof the Bible, that only white men can lead the Bible\nstudies, can become officers of the group, and that's\nbased on their fundamental belief that that's what the\nBible instructs. On your view, must Hastings give this\norganization status as a recognized student\norganization?\nMR. McCONNELL: No, Justice Ginsburg. Our\nposition is it is unconstitutional to -- to prohibit\ngroups to form around beliefs but not around status.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But the belief is -- this\nis the belief.\nMR. McCONNELL: They can insist that -- that\neveryone who participates in the group have that belief,\nand that, as Justice Scalia said, may mean it's going to\nbe a very small group. But they cannot discriminate on\nthe basis of status. But belief -- as this Court said\nin Cantwell v. Connecticut, belief, the freedom to\nbelieve, is absolute.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So, they -- they would have\nto negate their belief in their practice. They could\nbelieve this, but they couldn't implement it?\nMR. McCONNELL: Well, it's not unusual to\nsay people -- people can believe in all kinds of things\nthat are illegal. That doesn't mean that they can do\nthem. It's not a -- it's not an unfamiliar distinction\nin our law. But let's look at --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: This was the basis -- your\ndistinction between status and belief was the basis for\nyour saying that the original policy, whatever --\nwhatever we call it -- what is the name of it?\nMR. McCONNELL: The written policy?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The written policy -- when\nit forbids discrimination on the basis of sexual\norientation was complied with by CLS because it would\nnot discriminate on the basis of orientation, only on\nthe basis of belief.\nMR. McCONNELL: That's correct.\nJUSTICE BREYER: If -- if a homosexual\nperson said, I want to belong to this club, and I\nbelieve in its principles, I don't believe in sexual\nrelationships before marriage, and that's why I want to\nwork for homosexual marriage, which I do, so my\nconsistency there, is that person -- I am consistent in\nwhat I work for, what I believe, and on -- as far as\npremarital sex is concerned, it's totally 100 percent\nwith your organization that you are representing; would\nthey admit that person or not?\nMR. McCONNELL: Yes. There's a joint\nstipulation to that effect, Number 34.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: CLS doesn't have any -- any\nbelief that marriage is between a man and a woman?\nMR. McCONNELL: It -- it does. I thought\nthat Justice Breyer posited the case of a person of\nhomosexual orientation who shares that belief.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, no, no, no.\nJUSTICE BREYER: He shares the belief that\nthere should be no premarital sex --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But he wants to marry --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- and he says that's why I\nam working for Proposition 8 or whatever the\nproposition, or against it --\nMR. McCONNELL: Oh, oh, I'm sorry,\nJustice Breyer --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I'm working to legalize\nhomosexual marriage in which --\nMR. McCONNELL: I'm sorry. I misunderstood\nyour question. This is a religious group. Their\nunderstanding of marriage is based upon their --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So they would not -- the\nanswer is no, that person --\nMR. McCONNELL: Not if that person was\nengaging in sexual conduct that is contrary to the --\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, he's not --\nMR. McCONNELL: Well, in that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- because his\nsexual conduct --\nMR. McCONNELL: -- or -- I'm sorry. Or --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- he will refrain until\nmarriage is made lawful --\nMR. McCONNELL: Right.\nJUSTCIE BREYER: -- at which point he intends\nto engage in sexual conduct.\nMR. McCONNELL: That's right. If the\nperson --\nJUSTICE BREYER: That person.\nMR. McCONNELL: Regardless of what he\nintends to do, if he does not agree with the -- the\norganization on the point of -- of marriage, then he can\nbe -- he can be excluded from leadership in the group.\nAgain, he's able to attend all the\nactivities. CLS has all of its activities entirely open\nto everyone. And what it objects to is having -- is\nbeing run by non-Christians, because after all, this is\na group whose very purpose is --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You keep talking about\nbeing forced to let people in. And this is where I'm a\nlittle bit confused by your yellow brief.\nThe school has taken the position that any\ngroup can apply to use its facilities; priority and\nfunding, et cetera, will only go to recognized student\ngroups. But your group is not being excluded or\nostracized completely from the school. Presumably, you\ncan meet in the cafeteria. You can meet in open spaces\nin the school. You can apply like everyone else, any\nother nonstudent group, recognized student group. But\nyou have been saying repeatedly in your presentation\nthat you're barred from the campus. And so I'm a little\nconfused as to exactly --\nMR. McCONNELL: What I -- Justice Sotomayor,\nI believe what we consistently say is that we have been\ndenied the right to meet on campus. And that is\ncompletely true. Look -- if you would look at Joint\nStipulation Number 10, at the top of page 219, it provides\nthat CLS, although not currently registered, is eligible\nto apply for permission for rooms. But there is no\nstipulation that that will ever be granted, and the\nrecord shows that every time CLS has requested\npermission to meet they have gotten a complete\nrun-around. They have been told: Well, you have to\napply through your lawyer, and then their -- they don't\nget an answer on time and when they get an answer it's,\nwell, because you're not a registered student group --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But let's -- could we --\nMR. McCONNELL: -- there is not room for\nyou.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's -- let's assume,\nbecause I'm not quite sure what the record is on these\nissues -- I'm somewhat confused on the factual assumptions\nunderlying this case. But let's assume two things: One,\nthat in fact you have the option of applying for use of\nthe space and that, assuming there are no conflicts and\nother things that -- that are in the normal course would\npreclude your use, that you would be granted use. Is your\nargument different in that situation?\nMR. McCONNELL: Justice Sotomayor, even the\naccess to campus communications is absolutely essential,\nas this Court said in the -- in Healy v. James. We are\nbarred from access to the -- to Hastings' e-mail system;\nwe can't post notices on the usual bulletin board; we\nare left out of the weekly --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There are bulletin\nboards. There are other ones.\nMR. McCONNELL: There -- there's -- there\nare ones for the -- for campus and student groups, and\nthere's another one for community groups. We're\nallowed to post on the community group, but we're not\nallowed to post on the boards that -- that students look\nto for where student activities occur.\nWe are left out of the -- a very important\npoint -- the student organization fair at the beginning\nof the year where groups introduce themselves to the\nOne L's as they -- as they come in.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you disputing that\nthis is --\nMR. McCONNELL: We're -- we're barred from\nthat.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you disputing this\nis a limited forum, public forum?\nMR. McCONNELL: No, it's definitely a\nlimited designated public forum.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's different from\nCantwell. Cantwell is where the Jehovah's Witness\nplays the record on the -- on the street. And -- and --\nMR. McCONNELL: I only cite Cantwell for the\nproposition that belief is absolute.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: No. No. And Cantwell\nsaid that belief is central to -- to religions and that\npeople would disagree. But that's precisely why\nHastings might argue to us that -- that this is\ninconsistent with their idea of what this forum is. And\nif -- will you just address that, please?\nMR. McCONNELL: I would address it. The\nforum -- the purposes of the forum are undisputed. They\nare to provide a diversity of expression among student\ngroups. Their policy disserves the purpose of the forum\nand therefore cannot be regarded as reasonable in light\nof that. And what is more, what they have done is --\nit's also not reasonable because it's independently\nunconstitutional. What they have done is they've said\nyou may not have fundamental freedom of association or,\nif you do, we will withdraw an otherwise available\nbenefit from you.\nAs recently as the unanimous decision of\nthis Court in FAIR v. Rumsfeld, the Court reiterated the\n-- the now I think 100-year old principle that\nconstitutional rights may not be penalized by the\nwithdrawal of benefits any more than they can by -- by\ndirect prohibition.\nI see that my white light is up, and I'd\nlike to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nMcConnell.\nMr. Garre.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. GARRE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThis case was decided by both courts below\non the premise, which is not disputed at any point in the\npetition for certiorari, that Hastings reserves the\nfunding and benefits that go to student groups that\nobtain school recognition to groups that choose to admit\nall students\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then why do\nyou have --\nMR. GARRE: -- regardless of their status or\ntheir beliefs.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why do you have a policy,\na written policy -- you don't have a written policy that says\nanything about all-comers. You've got a written\npolicy that says you can -- you can't discriminate on\nthe basis of only one type of belief, religious belief.\nMR. GARRE: Mr. Chief Justice, first of all,\nthis is a case about injunctive relief. As a matter of\nlaw, the only policy that's relevant is the current\npolicy, and that's the one --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then why is --\nMR. GARRE: -- that both sides agree is\nin place.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is this\nnondiscrimination policy no longer on the books?\nMR. GARRE: No. It's -- it's the way in which\nHastings implements the nondiscrimination policy in this\nparticular forum. And, again, look at the Ninth Circuit\ndecision in this case. It's --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That is not an\nimplementation of the nondiscrimination policy. I mean,\nthe two policies are quite different. Now, are you\ntelling us that the written policy is no longer\noperative?\nMR. GARRE: No, it -- Justice Scalia, this\nis --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: No, what? No, it's not\noperative or no, you're not telling me that?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GARRE: It is operative. This -- the\nall-comers policy is how it's implemented in this\ncontext. And the written policy applies not only to the\nenumerated characteristics; it applies to any arbitrary\nunreasonable discrimination, and the law school --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it doesn't --\nit doesn't say that.\nMR. GARRE: It does, Your Honor. It says in\nthe first paragraph on -- this is on page 220 --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.\nMR. GARRE: -- of the Joint Appendix: The\ncollege is committed to a policy against legally\nimpermissible, arbitrary, or unreasonable discriminatory\npractices. And then it also goes on and enumerates\nspecific factors. And this is spelled out, I believe in\npage --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So they -- so you're\nsaying the second paragraph is totally\nunnecessary. You say the first paragraph says you can't\ndiscriminate on any basis, and the second paragraph\nspells out the bases. So why do you do have the second\nparagraph?\nMR. GARRE: I think it provides additional\nguidance. But -- but, again, there shouldn't be any\ndebate about what policy is at issue here. The Ninth\nCircuit's decision in this case is two-sentence long.\nThe first sentence describes the policy at issue in this\ncase. And it says: \"The parties stipulate\" --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do you think this case\ndeserved a two-sentence decision in the Ninth Circuit?\nMR. GARRE: Justice Alito, it was decided in\nthe wake of the Ninth Circuit's decision in Truth, which\nhad not only garnered a substantial panel decision but\nhad garnered serious consideration on -- on rehearing.\nSo this case, the Ninth Circuit properly concluded, was\ncontrolled by the Truth decision. So in that respect --\nJUSTICE ALITO: So the answer is yes, this case\nwhich is -- before us has produced hundreds and hundreds of\npages of amicus briefs, deserved two sentences in the\ncourt of appeals?\nMR. GARRE: In the -- in the sense that it\nwas backed up by the Truth decision, yes. But look at\nthe petition for certiorari in this case. Nowhere did\n-- did Petitioners challenge the Ninth Circuit's\ncharacterization of the policy at issue. The petition\nsays on page 2 that \"There are no disputed issues of\nmaterial fact.\"\nJUSTICE ALITO: But hasn't it been -- hasn't\nit been CLS's position from the very beginning of this\ncase that Hastings has not in fact required every group\nto admit any student who applies? Don't they say that\nover and over again in their district court papers, in\nthe court of appeals briefs, and in the cert petition?\nMR. GARRE: If -- if they believe that that\ncaused the school to adopt a different policy, they\nshouldn't have stipulated to the policy that they did.\nAnd they should have challenged at a minimum --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, they stipulated that\nthe policy exists. They didn't stipulate that it is --\nis being faithfully applied by Hastings. What do you do\nabout the -- the -- the two organizations' bylaws\nreferred to in the -- in the Petitioner's brief, which\nclearly do -- conflict with the so-called all-comers\npolicy?\nMR. GARRE: All of the bylaws that they've\npointed to, Justice Scalia --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: All of the bylaws --\nMR. GARRE: -- that they have pointed to in\ntheir brief --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. GARRE: -- Justice Scalia, either,\nnumber one, explicitly say that the organization will\ncomply with the rules and regulations of the school or\nsay that they will admit all students. That includes\nall the bylaws.\nNow, they have pointed to various things\nfrom the bylaws, and this evolved as they've tried to\ncreate material factual issues in this Court. One of\nthe things they've pointed to is the bylaws saying, like\nthe Outlaw bylaw, that says that students who are\nmembers of a group can be excelled if they -- expelled\nif they engage in disruptive or gross misconduct. There\nis nothing inconsistent about that with the school's\npolicy. The school's interest is not in allowing\nstudents to disrupt the activities of students'\ngroups --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they -- they\nquite -- quote the bylaws of the National Lawyers Guild,\nwhich says any member must \"agree with the objectives\nof the organization as set forth herein.\" That's not\nall-comers. That's a bylaw that restricts an\norganization according to its -- members can't join\nunless they sign on the dotted line that they believe in\nobjectives of the organization.\nMR. GARRE: There's a fundamental\ndifference between a group that says people of a\nparticular sexual orientation are not allowed to become\nmembers --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, they don't say that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It has nothing to\ndo with --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They don't say that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's got nothing to\ndo with sexual -- well, I don't know the National\nLawyers Guild, but they say you have got to agree with\nthe objectives of the organization.\nMR. GARRE: Justice Scalia, the district\ncourt made a -- may I?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, start with mine.\nMR. GARRE: Okay. My apologies.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GARRE: Mr. Chief Justice, as -- as\nDean -- as director of student services testified, the\nfact that the bylaws may say we want students who are\ninterested in our activities doesn't mean that the\nbylaws are excluding students who want to join. And\nthere's a fundamental difference, again, between saying\nstudents that have these particular beliefs or status\ncannot become members of our group --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It seems to me that\nyour position is continually evolving wherever the First\nAmendment pressure comes. You've got a written\nnondiscrimination policy. And then you say, well, yes,\nbut we use an all-comers policy. You've got an\nall-comers policy, and then groups don't actually follow\nthe all-comers policy, and you have another answer to\nthat. It seems to me that we should go with -- why\nshouldn't we go with the written policy and the written\nbylaws?\nMR. GARRE: Well, with respect, Your Honor,\nI think it's my friend's position that is evolving. You\nhave joint stipulations before you as to what the policy\nis. You have the decisions of both courts below\ndescribing that policy consistently with the joint\nstipulations, and you have a petition for certiorari\nthat never challenges that the all-comers policy is at\nissue.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What do we do with the\nselective application argument, which is what\nJustice Alito referred to and Justice Scalia, which is\nit is troubling that some of these bylaws do limit their\ngroups? La Raza limited it to people of Hispanic\ndescent, and the Lawyers Guild to people who adopt its\n-- its beliefs. What are we going to do with this\nselective application argument?\nMR. GARRE: This case wasn't --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It's in the case, isn't\nit? And if it is, what does it do to your policy?\nMR. GARRE: Justice Sotomayor, this case\nwasn't litigated as a pretext case. If you look at the\nbriefs in this case, the first time that the word\n\"pretext\" is used is in the reply brief in this Court.\nIt was litigated as a challenge, which is a serious\nchallenge, to the constitutionality of an all-comers\npolicy in this particular forum.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: The -- the two are connected,\nthough, Mr. Garre. Frankly, one reason why I am\ninclined to think this is pretextual is that it is so\nweird to require the -- the campus Republican Club to\nadmit Democrats, not just to membership, but to\nofficership. To require this Christian society to allow\natheists not just to join, but to conduct Bible classes,\nright? That's crazy.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GARRE: But --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And is there any other\nuniversity in the country that has this kind of a\npolicy?\nMR. GARRE: There absolutely is, Justice\nScalia, and it's explained --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where is that?\nMR. GARRE: It's explained\nin the amicus brief for the American Council of\nEducation, explained in the State Universities amicus\nbrief.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, there are very few\nuniversities. But why doesn't this just all work out?\nIf the Christian Legal Society has these beliefs, I am\nnot so sure why people that don't agree with them want\nto belong to them. What -- doesn't this all just work\nout?\nMR. GARRE: Justice Kennedy --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And doesn't it work out that\nthe Democrats -- they don't want to go in the Republican\nclub and run for officership anyway.\nMR. GARRE: Hastings --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: So why -- what's --\nwhat interest does this -- does the school have in this\npolicing mechanism that it's imposing?\nMR. GARRE: A few -- a number of things,\nJustice Kennedy. The first is the line-drawing issue\nthat has been made clear during the first part of the\nargument this morning. If you're going -- they appear\nto take off the table race and what they say are other\nstatus considerations. I'm not sure why that excludes\nsexual orientation.\nBut if you're going to allow religious\ngroups, or any group, to draw exceptions for some\npeople, then you have to determine where to draw the\nline. And I think a school can reasonably say: We\ndon't want to get into this business at all; we want to\nallow all comers\nJUSTICE ALITO: But you now say --\nMR. GARRE: -- for all school-subsidized groups.\nJUSTICE ALITO: You now say in your brief that\nit is okay for a group to impose membership requirements\nthat are neutral and not based on beliefs. Isn't that right?\nMR. GARRE: That doesn't go to status or\nbelief. If you're talking about attendance\nrequirements or competition --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, you're talking\nabout --\nMR. GARRE: -- those are merits-based\nrequirements.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- La Raza background.\nAs I understand it, the La Raza organization says you have\nto be of La Raza background to be a policy member of the\norganization.\nMR. GARRE: The La Raza bylaws -- first of\nall, they did explicitly say that groups could not\nexclude members on the basis of sexual orientation.\nNow, they -- there was some confusion about\nhow La Raza had interpreted their bylaws. The school\nwent back to La Raza and said: Are you excluding\nmembers? La Raza said: No, we're not; we're open to\nall. And to eliminate any doubt, they amended their\nbylaws. That's the one example they've come up in the\n20-year history of this policy. And what does it show?\nIf you want to look at --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Wait, wait, wait. Twenty\nyears? Do you have any evidence that this policy, the\none we're arguing about now, that is to say, the\nall-comers policy, existed before CLS brought this\nlitigation? As I recall, the only evidence in the\nrecord is a letter from the dean describing this policy\nafter the litigation began.\nMR. GARRE: Justice Scalia, it's based on\nthe sworn deposition testimony on the former dean, who\nhad been at the school since 1993, the director of\nstudent services, who had been there at least since\n1999, as this is how they had implemented the\nnondiscrimination policy. I don't think there's any\nbasis for this Court to overturn that sworn testimony.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What we have is a rule, a\nstipulation. And as I read it, to try to make sense out\nof it, it does seem to discriminate against\norganizations in respect to which intellectual purity\nwould be important. They're going to have a harder\ntime. The ones that don't care that much will have an\neasier time.\nNow, in trying to judge the\nconstitutionality of that, I first have no idea which\nthese organizations are. We've got one of them, but\nthere may be a lot of others. I don't know if the\nDemocratic Club is or is not. I don't know how big the\ntent they want. I don't know whether the Turkish\nSociety even exists. I don't know how the chess club\nfeels about players of tiddlywinks.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: So I have an absolute void\nin this record, which in turn I think would be important\nto fill that void, because their justification --\nMR. GARRE: Well --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- is they don't want to get\ninto this, it's too complicated, and we're not\ndoing that much harm to them because they can meet\noff-campus, and it's a big, disruptive influence, all of\nthese things.\nAnd then sneaking in here is this anti-gay\nbias issue, and -- and they want to say: That isn't\nmuch, because that isn't really the point here, and\nthat's what we think, anyway. It's just an example of\nsomething.\nSo with that great unclarity, asked to\ndecide a constitutional issue where I feel I'd need more\nfacts and I don't have them --\nMR. GARRE: Well, you --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- the more justification to\nknow what it really is, which I don't have, what should\nI do?\nMR. GARRE: If the Court believes that,\nrespectfully, we think it should dismiss the writ as\nimprovidently granted. This case was litigated based on\nstipulations to avoid precisely these factual issues\nthat we're now talking about for the first time before\nthis Court.\nNow, I think it is common ground that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you -- Mr. Garre, you\ndid say that the evidence is the dean's deposition.\nThere's no prior evidence. But there are schools,\nincluding law schools, that have this policy. Is that\nnot so?\nMR. GARRE: That's true. Georgetown Law\nSchool does. Columbia Law School. Look, there's an\namicus brief filed by 13 educational organizations\nrepresenting thousands of colleges and universities\nacross the country, including the Association of Jesuit\nColleges and Universities, saying that this is a\nnot-uncommon and a reasonable policy. We're not saying\nit's the only approach that colleges can take in\nbalancing the competing interests here.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, let's explore --\nMR. GARRE: We're saying it's a\nconstitutional --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Let's explore the\nimplications of this policy. Suppose at a particular\ncampus there is a great deal of anti-Muslim animus.\nAnd there's a small Muslim group; it has 10 students.\nIf the group is required to accept anybody who applies\nfor membership, and 50 students who hate Muslims show up\nand they want to take over that group, you say the First\nAmendment allows that?\nMR. GARRE: Justice Alito, that's the\nclaim, obviously, that the other side is making. And,\nwith respect, this example has never happened at\nHastings in 20 years. It has really never happened in\nthe history of American education. If you look at cases\nlike the voter I.D. case, the partial-birth abortion\ncase --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if you have a law\nthat says every newspaper that's published in the\nUnited States must be reviewed every day by the\ngovernment's censor board, and the fact that the\ngovernment's censor board decides not to do it, then\nthat law is okay?\nMR. GARRE: I think this Court would\nordinarily take into account the likelihood that\nsomething would happen, and if you're dealing where the\nonly experience --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: A newspaper sues\nsaying that law is constitutional, and we'll say it's\nall right; it has never been applied?\nMR. GARRE: Of course this Court is going to\nexamine the chill, but so -- just like in the voter I.D. case,\nwhere you had had people saying this was going to and,\non secondhand accounts, did exclude people from getting\nto the -- ballot access. This Court said, look, that might\nhappen, but it's not a basis to invalidate this law\nacross the board. Come back with an as-applied challenge.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That was because\nthey might adopt a different policy. We're not dealing\nwith a future different policy in this case.\nMR. GARRE: And there's -- as to the\ntakeover hypothetical, there is no evidence that it has\nhappened. Groups can take measures to prevent it. They\ncan require attendance requirements before people become\nmembers. They can instruct into their bylaws --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's not going to\nhelp if you have the 50 anti-Muslim students who want to\ntake over the group.\nMR. GARRE: People have to be -- attend a\ncertain number of meetings before they can join. They can\nhave --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. They take\nover the group and the first thing they do is say we're\nabolishing the attendance policy.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GARRE: They can have in their -- they\ncan -- sure. I mean, we can entertain the\nhypotheticals. But they can have in their bylaws a\nprovision just like the Constitution of the United\nStates, that amendments can only be made by a\nsuper-majority --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, CLS obviously thinks\nthis is a real threat. Now, what do you propose that\nthey do? Suppose that you win this case, and then when\nthe case -- and then when this all-applicants policy is\nadministered, then precisely what they fear begins to\ntake place. Do they have any recourse?\nMR. GARRE: I think if that started to take\nplace, the college would reconsider its policy. It\ncould bring a First Amendment challenge saying that --\nJUSTICE ALITO: No, do they have any --\nMR. GARRE: -- that would --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Do they have any recourse?\nMR. GARRE: I think at that point --\nJUSTICE ALITO: If they have 10 members,\nand 8 who are completely hostile to the organization\nsign up?\nMR. GARRE: I think obviously the members\nwould rejoin and form another group, Your Honor. I\nmean, we're not dealing with this in a factual vacuum.\nCLS's predecessor existed at the schools for 10 years\nand in --\nJUSTICE ALITO: I understand the answer to\nthat question. So, if -- if hostile members take over\nCLS, the former members of CLS can form CLS II?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. GARRE: If that happened Your Honor. I\nmean, this has never happened ever in -- in the history\nof --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It's also the --\nMR. GARRE: -- education.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the university's\nacross-the-board rules for all student conduct against\ndisruption, against incivility. The list would certainly\ncarry over.\nMR. GARRE: Absolutely. And CLS, like any\ngroup, can have a rule that disruptive members should be\nexpelled.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. I don't\nunderstand your --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's also never happened\nfrom, what I can tell, that someone who disagrees with\nthis group has applied for membership.\nMR. GARRE: Well, Your Honor, the record\ndoes show that --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, that's -- that's\nwhat so puzzling about the -- the case.\nMR. GARRE: The record does show, Your\nHonor, that there was a gay student who was a member of\nthe group. And that's -- let me give you that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That was the predecessor\ngroup.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The predecessor group --\nMR. GARRE: That was the predecessor group.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- and obviously uncomfortable\nwith their position, so he or she left.\nMR. GARRE: Well, actually --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That's the way it works.\nMR. GARRE: -- what the record shows is that\nshe participated in discussions that the officer of the\ngroup said it was a joy to have her and that both sides\nlearned.\nI think CLS's position depends on the dark\nnotion that students would not have any interest in\njoining a group with different viewpoints on certain\nissues except to disrupt that group. And I think that\ngreatly undersells the intellectual curiosity of\nstudents. It greatly undersells the fact that groups\nhave many different interests and perspectives.\nThe church has a stance in homosexuality,\nbut it has stances on many other issues, too. And if a\nstudent -- even if he or she disagrees with the stance on\nhomosexuality, they may agree with many other aspects of\nthe groups, and they may want to join in the fellowship of\nthat group, they want to take advantage of intangible\nbenefits like not --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Teach Bible classes?\nRight?\nMR. GARRE: Your Honor --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You have to let them teach\nBible classes, too, right?\nMR. GARRE: In fact, the record in the --\ncase shows that only officers teach Bible classes,\nand groups are perfectly free to structure their\norganization like that. They can have requirements\nthat people attend certain meetings before they do that.\nCLS isn't forced to have anyone lead Bible classes.\nJUSTICE ALITO: If an orthodox --\nMR. GARRE: CLS --\nJUSTICE ALITO: If an orthodox Jewish group\nor a Muslim group applied for recognition and the group\nsaid part of our beliefs is -- one of our beliefs is that\nmen and women should sit separately at religious services,\nwould Hastings deny registration to that group?\nMR. GARRE: If it was excluding students\nfrom that group on the basis of their beliefs or their\nstatus, then, yes, it would.\nHastings isn't in the business of\nsecond-guessing the -- the beliefs of -- of individual\ngroups, and the whole point of the policy really is to\nstay out of this, to just have a blanket rule that's\nequally neutral.\nJUSTICE ALITO: We have -- we have two amicus\nbriefs from orthodox Jewish groups and a brief from a\nMuslim group. So, your answer is that they could not be\nrecognized under Hastings' policy because of their\nreligious beliefs regarding the way religious services\nshould be conducted?\nMR. GARRE: Your Honor, I think even my\nfriend recognizes that a group could not exclude an\nindividual on the basis of their gender or their\nbeliefs -- on the basis of their gender or race.\nAnd remember the Bob Jones case, this Court --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that's because\ngender or race is fundamentally different from religious\nbrief. Gender and race is a status. Religious belief --\nit has to be based on the fundamental notion that we are\nnot open to everybody. We have beliefs, you have to\nsubscribe to them. And we've always regarded that as\na good thing. That type of exclusion is supported in --\nin the Constitution. The other types of exclusion are\nnot.\nMR. GARRE: But not at all costs,\nMr. Chief Justice. In the Bob Jones case, the claim was\nfrom a -- a small private religious school that has a\nsincere religious belief that people who believed in\ninterracial dating should not become members of their\nschool. And this Court, nevertheless, held that that\nbelief, sincere as it was, did not trump a statute that\ndenied education -- denied Federal financial assistance\non a viewpoint-neutral basis to schools that\ndiscriminated on the basis of religion.\nHere we have a -- a group that wants to\nexclude members on the basis of sexual orientation. We\ncan -- CLS has tried to change that part --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You phrase it that\nway. It's a group that wants to exclude -- a religious\ngroup, a religious-oriented group, that wants to exclude\npeople who do not subscribe to their religious beliefs.\nMR. GARRE: They -- there is a binding\njudicial admission. And, again, this gets back to the\nBob Jones example. I think --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where -- yes, let's get back\nto this homosexual orientation. You say that that's\nestablished in the case.\nMR. GARRE: Look at page -- J.A. page 460,\nwhich is where the district court said that CLS made\na binding judicial admission that they wanted to\ndiscriminate on the basis of sexual orientation. Keep\nin mind that this case began because CLS came back to\nthe law school and said we're happy to say we won't\ndiscriminate on some grounds, but we're not going to\nsay we won't exclude students on the basis of sexual\norientation.\nJUSTICE BREYER: What's supposed to happen?\nI don't know the answer to this. Hastings, let's say,\nor Berkeley has four or five or six different religious\nchapels for services on Sunday or Saturday, and they say\nwe're open to all branches of religion, orthodox Jews,\nconservative, and reformed. And then the orthodox say\nwe want men and women to sit separately.\nNow, can Hastings say or Berkeley, no, we'll\nlet the reform come, we'll let the conservatives come,\nbut not the -- not the orthodox Jews. They can't\nhave their service. Would -- would that be\nconstitutional?\nMR. GARRE: Your Honor, I think it would be\na much different case. It --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but what is your opinion?\nMR. GARRE: I -- I think if the school is\nregulating outside of the purposes of a limited forum,\npublic forum for recognized groups, then I doubt it\ncould go in --\nJUSTICE BREYER: So if, in fact, the --\nthe --\nMR. GARRE: -- and tell the groups --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- they have clubs and they're\nnot services, and what they do is they discuss -- they\ndiscuss the -- the nature of the service, and there can\nthey have separate discussions --\nMR. GARRE: Where -- where --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- men from -- men and\nwomen?\nMR. GARRE: Where the rule operates on a\nviewpoint-neutral basis. Here what the -- the school is\ndoing is it is publicly subsidizing --\nJUSTICE BREYER: I guess your answer to that\nis the orthodox Jews cannot. They cannot have\nseparate women's groups in their organization, which is\nan after religious school organization.\nMR. GARRE: They can exist separately. At\nthe school we have are numerous --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Outside of the university,\net cetera.\nMR. GARRE: In fact, Your Honor, it's not --\nit's not --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's their problem here.\nMR. GARRE: -- unusual for schools to have\nall male or all women clubs. They are not recognized\nparts of the community. These -- these are activities\nthat are subsidized by the students themselves through the\nmandatory student activities fees.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And their reason to put in\na sentence as to why they don't want these orthodox Jews\nto meet separately on the campus -- men in one group,\nwomen in another -- and discuss the religious service\n-- they want none like that, and their reason for wanting\nnone like that is?\nMR. GARRE: Well, I think that's a much\ndifferent example than this case --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, I'm trying to make it\nas close as possible.\nMR. GARRE: Well, I -- I may have\nmisunderstood the hypothetical. I mean, I think it's\na much different --\nJUSTICE BREYER: They have a small orthodox\nclub.\nMR. GARRE: The reason why the school has a\npolicy that all groups that it subsidizes must admit\nall-comers is that, number one, it ensures that all\nstudents enjoy equal access to all school-subsidized and\nschool-recognized activities.\nNumber two, it avoids the line-drawing\nproblems that we've discussed early this morning and I\nthink are necessarily going to arise and also create\nstrife in small educational communities.\nNumber three, it allows --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Can I ask about number 2,\nthe -- the so-called line-drawing problem? Aren't you\njust letting yourself into even more line-drawing\nproblems?\nMR. GARRE: Not with the all-comers rule.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, the other -- it's\nwhether you were discriminating on the basis of one of\nthe forbidden bases. But now you're saying you can't\ndiscriminate on any basis, which means there're going\nto be even more lines to have to draw. Why does it\nsolve your problem?\nMR. GARRE: I don't think it -- that\nhappens at all, Justice Scalia. I think when you've\nthe policy that all students have to become members,\nregardless of their status or belief, that gets the\nschool out of the business of determining whether,\nnumber one, people are discriminating on the basis of an\nessential belief, which is, is the way that Petitioner\ndescribes his -- their rule.\nJUSTICE ALITO: As I understood the\nposition, your latest position in your brief, you\nreally don't say you have an all-comers policy. There\nare certain criteria that can be applied, like interest,\nknowledge; is that correct?\nMR. GARRE: Competitive-based, merit-based\nrequirements are not excluded. It -- they're\nnot --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Could a -- well, could a\ngroup, consistent with your revised all-comers policy,\nrequire that members who want -- anyone who wants to\nbecome a member show a particular level of knowledge\nabout the subject of the group?\nMR. GARRE: Yes. And I think --\nJUSTICE ALITO: So if the CLS required\nanybody who wanted to become a member to pass a test on\nthe Bible, that would be okay?\nMR. GARRE: If it were truly an objective\nknowledge test, it would be okay. It would be no\ndifferent than the law review. These are merits-based\ndeterminations. There's a fundamental difference\nbetween excluding people on the basis of merit and\nexcluding people on the basis of status or belief that\nhas no connection to merit. That -- that, I think, is a\nlong-standing understanding of discrimination.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that --\nthat -- that's pretty tough. That has no connection to\nmerit. I assume there are groups that think subscribing\nto their beliefs is evidence of merit, particularly\nreligious groups. So, how can you have a -- a test that\nallows distinctions based on merit but not -- not\nbeliefs?\nMR. GARRE: I think it goes to the nature of\nwhether it's discrimination under the school's policy,\nand I think status or belief. People understand -- that's\nwhy we are talking about things like race or gender or\nsexual orientation, disability, military status, any\nnumber of these things. And I think the school's policy\navoids having to draw lines as to whether or not a group\nhas a sufficient enough belief that military members\nshould become a member of the Amnesty International club\nbecause they disagree with the war, that disabled\nmembers should be -- disabled students should be a\nmember of a particular group. And the school's policy\navoids these line-drawing --\nJUSTICE ALITO: If the school adopt an\nall-comers policy --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question,\nMr. Garre?\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- for the purpose --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask one question?\nI'd like you to answer, and I'd like your opponent, too:\nDo you think that, in order to decide this case, we have\nto pass on the constitutionality of an all-comers policy?\nMR. GARRE: Yes, that's the policy before\nthis Court.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That we must do that to decide\nthe case? And I want to ask your opponent the same\nquestion.\nMR. GARRE: I believe you have to do that,\nbecause that is the policy --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: So they're all --\nMR. GARRE: -- before this Court.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: There may be a lot of\nother things we can decide, but in all events, we must\ndecide that much?\nMR. GARRE: Absolutely. Absolutely. If I\ncould just discuss briefly the --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, could I just ask one\nquick question relating to that?\nIf -- if an all-comers policy is adopted for\nthe purpose of discriminating on the basis of viewpoint,\ndoes it violate the First Amendment?\nMR. GARRE: If it's pretextual in the Church\nof Lukumi Babalu Aye sense, yes. No -- no school can\npurposely discriminate at a group, no matter what policy\nit adopts.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And what if we think that\nthe policy has not been evenhandedly applied? Can't we\ndecide the case on that basis, and then we could just\nassume arguendo Justice -- the answer to Justice\nStevens' question.\nMR. GARRE: I don't think so, Justice --\nJustice Kennedy, because that --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is -- was there any proof\nin this record? I mean, there's a stipulation for summary\njudgment. Was there any proof showing that it wasn't\nevenly applied?\nMR. GARRE: No. And I get back to the\npetition for certiorari. On page 2 of the petition, the\npetition --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Let me just say, suppose\nit were shown that it were not applied evenhandedly, you'd\nhave no problem with our saying that it's then\nunconstitutional.\nMR. GARRE: It -- yes. We don't think that\nthat's the case here. But if a policy is applied\nevenhandedly -- unevenhandedly, in a viewpoint-neutral\nway and it burdens religious groups, then there's\ncommon ground that that policy violates the\nConstitution. Of course, we think the policy here is --\nJUSTICE ALITO: If this were an employment\ncase, and when an employee is denied promotion the\nemployee said it's for reason A, and then after\nlitigation begins the employer says, well, no, it really\nwasn't for reason A, it was for reason B because of a\npolicy that we've long had, but there's never --\nthere's no written documentation of this new policy;\nand then at a later point in the litigation the employer\nsays, well, it wasn't really either for reason A or\nreason B; it was for reason C -- do you think that summary\njudgment could be granted in favor of the employer on\nthe issue of pretext?\nMR. GARRE: I think that that would create a\nfactual issue and that that issue might well be tried,\nJustice Alito.\nAnd the one thing that is important to keep in\nmind is that this is a request for injunctive relief and not\ndamages. So the only policy that matters -- and Wilkinson v.\nAustin makes this clear -- is the current policy; all\nparties agree that the current policy is the all-comers\npolicy. That's the policy supported by the record in\nthis case.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I'm sorry. All\nparties do not agree that the policy is the all-comers\npolicy. Your friend argued repeatedly that the policy\nwas the written nondiscrimination policy.\nMR. GARRE: I understood my friend's opening\nbrief to acknowledge at the least that that's the policy\nthe school has said it has today. It is the school's\npolicy. It's supported by substantial history and\nsworn deposition testimony.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Garre, the -- the\nso-called written policy, that has a -- that list has a\ncorrespondence to the State's law, doesn't it?\nMR. GARRE: It does.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: The categories that are\nlisted there are the categories that under California\nlaw are proscribed bases for discrimination?\nMR. GARRE: It does. And that is an\nadditional basis for the school's policy. Look at\nCalifornia Education Code 66270. It explicitly\nprohibits discrimination in -- in programs and\neducational activities by public schools like Hastings.\nHastings has an obligation under State law to prohibit\ndiscrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. The\nreason why we're here today is because CLS insisted\non the right to discriminate, to exclude students on the\nbasis of their sexual orientation.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, section 66270 applies\nto programs conducted by a post-secondary educational\ninstitution, and your position is that if -- if a\nreligious group complies with your policies and then it\nconducts religious services, those religious services\nare conducted by Hastings?\nMR. GARRE: Our position is that the\nregistered student organization program is a program\nof the university; it's subsidized by the university;\nit's recognized by the university; and that all students\nshould be able to enjoy access to that program.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In your response to\nJustice Ginsburg concerning California law, is it your\nposition that California law requires religious groups\nto admit people who do not believe in their religious\nbeliefs and in fact to conduct services of that group?\nMR. GARRE: Your Honor, our position is that\nthe provision that we've cited to, 66270, does not carve\nout an exemption in this program for a religious student\norganization. On its face --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the answer to my\nquestion is \"yes\"?\nMR. GARRE: Yes. On its face, it excludes --\nit has an exemption for religious schools; it does not\ninclude an exemption for religious organizations within\nthe context of this program. And we think that the\nprogram is reasonable.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nGarre.\nMR. GARRE: Thank you very much.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. McConnell, you\nhave 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL W. McCONNELL\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. McCONNELL: Well, thank you,\nMr. Chief Justice.\nFirst, in answer to Justice Stevens'\nquestion, we do believe that the Court needs to\nreach the constitutionality of the all-comers policy as\napplied to CLS in this case. We brought only an\nas-applied challenge.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Put -- put to a side a\nmoment -- forget the as-applied. Just take a -- a pure\nall-comers policy. Must we decide the constitutionality\nof that?\nMR. McCONNELL: Not facially, but as applied\nto CLS, yes. Several other points, I know --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Could you talk about -- I had\nunderstood from your brief that CLS did not have a -- a\npolicy of excluding people with homosexual disposition,\nbut that it was only homosexual conduct.\nMR. McCONNELL: That's correct as\nstipulated to, undisputed.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you -- but your\ncomplaint said otherwise. Your -- your --\nMR. McCONNELL: That's -- that's because we\n-- the complaint is accepting the -- Hastings'\ndefinition of sexual orientation. We were told that our\nconduct rule, our nonmarital conduct rule, violated their\nsexual orientation provision, and therefore we sought\nrelief from their sexual orientation provision. It was\nnothing more than that.\nThere -- it is -- it is stipulated in Joint\nStipulation 40, I believe it is, that -- that CLS's rule\nis based on conduct --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, okay.\nMR. McCONNELL: -- not orientation.\nSeveral other points: My friend twice in\nhis presentation stated that the all-comers policy is\nsimply their way of implementing the nondiscrimination\npolicy. But if so, it is so absurdly overbroad as to be\nunconstitutional. There is no reason to stop the\nenvironmentalist club from leading -- from requiring its\nleaders to share environmentalist views --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. McConnell --\nMR. McCONNELL: -- in order to --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. McConnell, you don't\nchallenge that there are universities, including four\nlaw schools, that have an all-comers policy?\nMR. McCONNELL: So far as we've been able\nto tell, there is no public university law school in the\ncountry that has such a policy.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There are private\nuniversities.\nMR. McCONNELL: There are some private\nuniversities that, according to the AALS, have such a\npolicy. We know nothing about them. They are not in\nthe record, and, frankly, I'd be a little bit\nsurprised, because the policy is so absurd.\nThink of how it would apply to the law\nschool itself, and this policy does apply to the law\nschool itself. Does Hastings really mean to say it is\ncommitting itself to an all-comers policy when it hires\nfaculty or admits students? Do they not care about the\nbelief of its dean of admissions, about beliefs of --\nabout, say, affirmative action? The very idea of it is\npreposterous.\nJUSTICE BREYER: It's not totally, if -- but\nit's imaginary, it's fantastical. The -- you could imagine\na school in the '60s that said that we think the way to\nadvance learning is everyone gets together in a nice\ndiscussion group and hugs each other and talks, all\nright?\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE BREYER: Now, that's a possible\neducational theory.\nMR. McCONNELL: It's possible, but --\nJUSTICE BREYER: They say that we are going to\napply that to everybody because that's how we do it. And --\nMR. McCONNELL: Yes, but Hastings has --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- if there are any\nideological organizations that suffer --\nMR. McCONNELL: But Hastings has --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- so be it, but it's\nfantastical, and therefore --\nMR. McCONNELL: Hastings has a perfectly\nconventional RSO program just like the ones in Healy,\nand Widmar and Rosenberger. They just have a policy\nthat is destructive of that --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, my --\nMR. McCONNELL: -- of that program.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- my question is, if I can\nthink of this policy -- but I tend to sympathize with\nyour view that it's so hard to believe that they really\nhold it, maybe they do, I don't know about it -- what do\nI do with this case?\nHow can I say whether this, let's call it\n\"hug your neighbor policy\" is -- to put a label on it\nthat's catchy --\nMR. McCONNELL: What can --\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- how do I -- how do I\nevaluate that?\nMR. McCONNELL: What you can say is that\nHealy v. James requires a substantial justification for\nexclusion of a student group from a registered student\nactivity forum, and this is not a substantial\njustification; it is a silly justification. If it is\nsilly, crazy, and preposterous, it is not even reasonable,\nlet alone compelling or substantial.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.\nMcConnell.\n"
