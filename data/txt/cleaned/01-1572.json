Janet Chandler.\nMs. Lach.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DONNAL M. LACH\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. LACH: Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice, and\nmay it please the Court:\nThe question today -- presented today turns on\nwhether Congress intended to include local governments\nwithin the meaning of the False Claims Act's undefined\nterm, person, which this Court determined in Stevens has\nremained unchanged since the original enactment in 1863.\nThe indications are that Congress did not subject local\ngovernments to liability under the 1863 act,\nAs this Court observed in Stevens and in Hubbard\nversus United States, the 1863 act was enacted as a\ncriminal statute. It imposed criminal fines or\nimprisonment in addition to civil damages and forfeitures.\nAs this Court noted in Marcus v. Hess, any language that\nthe civil portion shares in common with the criminal\nportion must be given careful scrutiny lest those not\nintended are brought within the act's reach.\nThe word, persons, subject to liability, is\nshared by both the civil and the criminal provisions of\nthe 1863 act, thus, a person that could be held liable\ncivilly must, under the 1863 act, necessarily be capable\nof being subject to the criminal provision as well. This\nCourt, in City of Newport, noted that municipal\ncorporations were not considered capable of doing a\ncriminal act or a malicious or willful wrong -- excuse me.\nThe -- the criminal nature of the statute in\nitself is a strong indication that Congress did not\ninclude local governments within the purview of the\nstatute.\nQUESTION: Ms. Lach, on that point, am I correct\nin thinking that the Sherman Act does apply to\nmunicipalities?\nMS. LACH: This Court determined that the -- the\nantitrust statutes, under the antitrust statutes the term,\nperson, does include municipalities, local governments.\nQUESTION: And isn't it true that in the\noriginal Sherman Act, imprisonment was authorized for\nevery person who violates the act?\nMS. LACH: That is true, but we are unaware of\nany case in which a local government has been prosecuted\nas a criminal.\nQUESTION: But the interpretation of the law on\nthe civil side --\nMS. LACH: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- was not nullified because there\nwas a provision that said, every person is subject to\nimprisonment.\nMS. LACH: That is correct, Your Honor, and this\nCourt in the City of Lafayette and City of Boulder, in\nanalyzing the term, person, and determining that\nmunicipalities were included within that term, were also\nfaced with the treble damages of the -- of the Clayton\nAct, and subsequent to those two decisions, Congress\nenacted the Local Government Antitrust Act of 1984, in\nwhich Congress specifically took local governments out of\nthe range of the treble damages, and now local governments\nare subject to injunctive or declaratory relief.\nQUESTION: My -- my simple point is that by\nputting a clearly penal provision in the statute, that did\nnot make municipalities out of the act, and I thought\nthat's what you were arguing, that the 1863 act is penal\nin part --\nMS. LACH: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- and therefore, it could not have\nin -- covered municipalities.\nMS. LACH: Yes, that is -- that is what we're\narguing.\nQUESTION: But that's not true of the Sherman\nAct.\nMS. LACH: It does not appear to be true of the\nSherman Act, but again, we are not aware of any case in\nwhich a local government was prosecuted under that act.\nQUESTION: Any more than this is a case of\nprosecution.\nMS. LACH: Any more -- that's true, but now,\never since 1878, the False Claims Act has been bifurcated.\nThe criminal provisions are separately codified from the\ncivil provisions.\nAlso, as this Court noted in Stevens in 1863,\nthe False Claims Act was enacted to combat fraud during\nthe Civil War by private contractors, and there is no\nindication that in 1863 the Federal Government was buying\nanything from local governments, or that there were any\nFederal contracts with local governments, and without a\npractice of Federal funding to local governments, Congress\nwould have no reason to envision a local government\nsubmitting a false claim for payment, nor were local\ngovernments firmly established as persons in 19 -- excuse\nme, in 1863.\nQUESTION: Well, Ms. Lach, you don't dispute\nthat the word persons extends to some corporations under\nthe act, do you?\nMS. LACH: Not at all. Not at all, and in fact,\nin -- in 1863, the term, person, presumptively included\nprivate corporations, and there is language in the 1863\nact, and given the context of the act, it is reasonable to\nassume that private corporations were included in the\nprovisions.\nQUESTION: Well, but there -- there are also\ncases from about that time that say that a -- a\nmunicipality is included in the -- in the term,\ncorporation, at any rate.\nMS. LACH: The -- the cases at that time were --\ncame from State courts, and the State courts were not\nconsistent throughout -- throughout the Nation as to when\nlocal governments could be held liable. Some State courts\nheld they could be held liable in contract, others in\ntort, and even when held liable in tort, there was\nsometimes the distinction between proprietary and\ngovernmental function.\nQUESTION: Well, what about Louisville and\nLetson?\nMS. LACH: Louisville and Letson, though, only\napplied to private corporations, and private corporations\nwere established by that 1844 case, but in -- this Court\ndid not extend that principle until the 1869 decision in\nCowles, and that was the first time --\nQUESTION: Didn't -- didn't we recognize it in\nthe Amity case in 1826? We -- we quoted Sir Edward Cook\nin including municipal corporations as -- as persons.\nMS. LACH: Yes, but still, in terms -- this\nCourt, in the Cowles decision in 1869, believed that it\nstill was not a settled issue and -- and settled the issue\nonce and for all. In the Amity case, it was not -- it was\nnot -- the issue that was before the Court that needed to\nbe decided, whether local governments were persons unlike\nin the Cowles case --\nQUESTION: Oh, we -- we thought otherwise in --\nin Monell, certainly. We said in Monell, and I'm quoting\nit, the Letson principle in 1869 was automatically and\nwithout discussion extended to municipal corporations.\nMS. LACH: Yes, but by saying that, this Court\nin Monell dated the presumption as firmly established as\nof the 1869 Cowles decision, rather --\nQUESTION: So you think there was a -- a major\nchange between, when, 1863 and 1869?\nMS. LACH: I think that --\nQUESTION: In that 6-year period, there was\nsuddenly, whap, it applied to municipal corporations,\nbefore that it didn't? It seems to me most implausible.\nMS. LACH: Well, it doesn't -- it wasn't an\nautomatic or a dramatic change, but nonetheless, there was\na progression. There was -- there was a transition in law\nwithin the States.\nQUESTION: In 6 years?\nMS. LACH: Those 6 years, of all 6 years in this\ncountry's history, of course, were the most significant,\nbut -- but in terms of dating a presumption that one can\nfirmly rely on, there is no firm date, other than 1869, in\nwhich acts of Congress were determined to include person\nas a -- include municipality within the word, person.\nQUESTION: Ms. Lach, the decision, the opinion\nin Cowles was very brief, right?\nMS. LACH: Yes, it was.\nQUESTION: And it was sort of like, well, of\ncourse. If this was establishing something that hadn't\nbeen just taken for granted, don't you suppose the Court\nwould have engaged in a little more reasoning?\nMS. LACH: Perhaps, but nonetheless the Court\ndid decide the issue, and made -- made it clear that for\nonce -- once and for all, this issue was being decided,\nand it was at that point that no ambiguity was left.\nThe first case that ever -- that -- in which a\nlocal government was ever brought before this Court was in\n1861, in the Aspinwall case, and there the issue did not\narise, and subsequent to the 1863 act, yes, there were\nother cases in which local governments were brought before\nthis Court, but the issue never arose. It wasn't until\n1869 that we can firmly date when, in -- in Federal --\nin -- in congressional enactments, we can presume that the\nword person included local governments.\nAnd this Court in Monell observed that it took\nyears of judicial conflict before corporations of all\nsorts, including municipal corporations, were established\nas persons that could sue and be sued in Federal court.\nQUESTION: Ms. Lach --\nQUESTION: Well, if we think that it -- that the\nword, person, includes municipal corporations, as, indeed,\nI think I do, based on Cowles and Monell, then what\nchanged it in your view? Why would we now have a\ndifferent view? Just because of the change in the\npunitive damages, the treble damages provision?\nMS. LACH: If this Court determines that the\nword, person, in 1863 did, in fact --\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMS. LACH: -- include local government, that --\nQUESTION: Yes, on that assumption, then what\nwould change that?\nMS. LACH: The -- the -- what would change it is\nCongress' imposition of treble damages, which this\nCourt has noted --\nQUESTION: But without an accompanying change in\nthe definition of person, right?\nMS. LACH: Exactly. Exactly, and the 1986\namendments were just that. They were amendments. What\nwas not changed in 1986 remained the same. Nonetheless,\nwhen Congress provided for treble damages, which this\nCourt has determined to be punitive, Congress knew what\nthis Court said in City of Newport. This Court reiterated\na presumption that local governments are immune from the\nimposition of punitive damages unless Congress\nspecifically indicates otherwise.\nQUESTION: Well, it seems to me you would have a\nbetter argument if you simply said, the 1983 change does\nnot impose punitive damages on local corporations, than to\nsay it suddenly proscribes an entire escape hatch from any\nsort of liability at all.\nMS. LACH: Well, under the 1863 act, there were\nonly double damages, which this Court concluded were\nremedial, and they were not punitive, but there was a big\nstep made in 18 -- 1986, when Congress changed the remedy\nto mandatory treble damages and, in addition to that,\nincreased the statutory fines.\nQUESTION: But it didn't make it clear at that\ntime that the change made them punitive. It was only in\nthe Stevens opinion that we decided they were punitive.\nMS. LACH: But there were indications prior to\nthat that -- that -- from which Congress understood that\nthe damages were punitive. In 1981, this Court, in Texas\nIndustries, a case that was cited in Stevens, stated that\ntreble damages are meant to punish, and also in 1981, in\nCity of Newport, this Court cited an 1877 a Missouri\nsupreme court case that held that a municipality was not\nsubject to treble damages under a trespass statute,\nnotwithstanding that statute's general authorization for\nsuch damages against any person, and the reason was,\ntreble damages were exemplary, and --\nQUESTION: Ms. Lach, didn't the Court also,\nI think in the context of the Clayton Act, characterize\ntreble damages as, quote, remedial?\nMS. LACH: The Court -- the Court noted both.\nThe Court said in -- in aspect, they are remedial, but\nthen, also they did have an intent to punish as well, but\nas I stated, the -- the Clayton Act no longer applies to\nlocal governments because Congress took affirmative\nsteps --\nQUESTION: Nonetheless, it used the word,\nremedial to characterize treble damages, and one of the\ndifficulties that your -- your argument that you're now\nmaking encounters is that this change in 1986, wasn't it a\ndramatic expansion of qui tam liability?\nMS. LACH: It was a dramatic expansion, but as\nthis Court --\nQUESTION: And then -- then you think that at\nthe same time that Congress expanded it, it also cut back,\nwithout any indication at all?\nMS. LACH: Well, we believe that Congress did\nnot cut back, that -- that local governments were never\nsubject to the act, but with this dramatic expansion,\nthere was also the dramatic increase in damages, and this\nCourt has made it clear that local governments have an\naffirmative defense when punitive damages are at stake,\nand in order to abrogate that immunity from punitive\ndamages, Congress has got to really say that it intends to\nimpose those punitive damages, treble damages in this\ncase, treble damages plus statutory fines in this case on\nlocal governments, and there's no indication anywhere on\nthe face of the 1986 amendments that Congress intended to\nimpose such damages on local governments.\nLocal governments are mentioned twice in the\n1986 amendments. In one provision, it's the\njurisdictional provision, 3732(b), which allows local\ngovernments and States to bring State court claims in\nFederal court when -- when the transaction arises from the\nsame transaction as a False Claims Act action. That\nindicates that Congress was interested in -- in preventing\nfrauds against local governments, not in -- in imposing\npunitive damages on local governments, and the other\nprovision is the CID provision which, as this Court noted\nin Stevens, has a -- has a definition. That definition\nincludes States and political subdivisions of States, but\nthat is for the purpose of investigation --\nQUESTION: I'm -- I'm sorry, I didn't fully\ngrasp the point you were just making. Were you suggesting\nthat Congress was worried about fraud against\nmunicipalities, but it didn't think that fraud would be\nengaged in by municipal units? I mean, I remember -- I'm\nfrom New York, and I remember Tammany Hall. I don't think\nit was altogether so different in Cook County, was it?\n(Laughter.)\nMS. LACH: But the -- but the point is that\nwhere local governments are mentioned in the -- in the\nFalse Claims Act in the 1986 amendment, there is no\nindication that Congress was mentioning them because\nCongress was intending to abrogate the immunity from\npunitive damages.\nQUESTION: May I ask whether you think that Cook\nCounty could bring a qui tam action?\nMS. LACH: Well, that's less clear under the\nFalse Claims Act. This Court -- I -- I know that Your\nHonor, in the dissenting opinion, suggested that the term,\nperson, is different in 30 -- 3730(b) from 3730(a). It's\nless clear, I think, perhaps, but that was an issue that\nthis Court expressly declined to address in Stevens\nbecause there was no need to discuss it or to decide it at\nthat point.\nQUESTION: And there's no -- there's no need to\ndecide it here. I -- I was just curious if you did have a\nposition on it.\nMS. LACH: I think perhaps local governments\ncould bring qui tam actions, but -- but it is not clear.\nThere are also the -- the policy considerations\nwith respect to the imposition of punitive damages on\nlocal governments. Local governments apply for and use\nFederal funds for the benefit of their residents and, as\nthis Court noted in Stevens, in City of Newport, the Court\nwas concerned with the imposition of punitive damages on\nlocal taxpayers under any circumstances, and here we have\na statute that imposes three times the amount of damages\nand imposes statutory fines, which get very hefty.\nPunitive damages against a local government have\ngot to come from someplace, and there are only two places,\nreduction in services, or an increase in taxes, and the\nvictims of punitive damages are not the wrongdoers.\nThey're -- they're the innocent, and some of those\ninnocents are not even taxpayers or voters, such as\nschoolchildren or homeless medically indigent.\nThe United States significantly -- significantly\nhas other means to stop fraud by local governments, and to\ndeter local governments from committing fraud. The United\nStates has common law causes of action to be made whole,\nand the most effective deterrent is the threat of\ndebarment from participation in Federal funding.\nWith no indication that Congress ever intended\nto include local governments in the -- in the 1863 act,\nand with the Dictionary Act not being enacted until 1871,\nwhere Congress for the first time created a statutory\npresumption that the word, person, includes bodies politic\nand corporate, this case is in a very different posture\nfrom the Monell case.\nIn Monell, this Court did not just look at the\nword, person. This Court looked at the historical\nenvironment in which section 1983 was enacted, it looked\nat the legislative history, and it also looked at the\nDictionary Act, which was enacted just 2 months prior with\nthe same -- by the same Congress that enacted section\n1983.\nA review of the circumstances around the 1863\nenactment, together with the text and the historical\ncontext, leads the other way. There was no concrete\npresumption. There were -- there were indications, yes,\nbut does that lead -- does that add up to a presumption?\nThere's no concrete presumption until this Court said so\nin Cowles in 1869, and then we have Congress in 1871.\nThere were changes. There were articulations at that --\nat that point in time.\nIf there are no further questions, I'll reserve\nthe remainder of my time.\nQUESTION: Very well, Ms. Lach.\nMS. LACH: Thank you.\nQUESTION: Mr. Miner, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JUDSON H. MINER\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMR. MINER: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the\nCourt:\nI really can't contribute much more to the\ndiscussion of what Congress meant by a person in\nsection -- in 1863, other than to point out, as we did in\nour brief, that in fact, the law in the States prior to\nLetson -- and -- and indeed, Letson is the origin of\nthe -- of the doctrine, because in Letson, what the Court\nactually said was, a corporation is a natural person for\npurposes of the suit where it's incorporated or where it\ndoes business, and the Court then goes on and says, and\nthat doctrine also applies to all corporations and body\npolitic.\nQUESTION: Before that, they looked at the\ncitizenship of the individual shareholders to decide\nwhether or not there was diversity jurisdiction?\nMR. MINER: The -- that's right. They -- they\ndefined corporations by the -- by the members, and -- and\nthey could have jurisdictions all over. That then gets\ncleared up, and -- and the law was absolutely clear in all\nof the States as we -- that we could find. We found no\ndissenting opinions that -- that held, that didn't hold\nthat a local government, whether it was a corporation,\nwhether it was a quasi corporation, a city, a county,\nwasn't held responsible for any obligations it had,\nwhether by contract, whether by charter, whether --\nwhether by statute, wherever they came from, and they were\nalso responsible for all their wrongful torts.\nSo that then brings us to really what was\nMs. Lach's starting point, this whole question of the\nimplications of the criminal provisions and, in fact, not\nonly the Sherman Act, but the Elkins Act also includes\ncriminal provisions, and this Court has recognized that\nperson, in that act, includes municipal corporations, but\nthe -- the question of what is the significance of\nincluding criminal penalties in 1863 has to be answered in\nthe context of what was -- what was the -- the view in\n1863.\nUnfortunately, this argument really doesn't\nsurface until the reply, and so we haven't had a chance\nreally to brief it, but the simple reality is, in -- in\nthe period of 18 -- in the era of 1863, indeed in the 19th\nCentury, local governments were treated just like private\ncorporations, and they were, indeed, subject to\nindictment, and they were subject to criminal punishment\non the same terms as local governments, and they were\noften found liable for acts that involved both fraud and\ndeceit.\nSince -- since this was -- now, I'd like to read\nto the Court from Dillon, who is cited repeatedly as -- as\none of the -- the scholars of the era, although we -- we\nhave not cited this passage because the issue hadn't come\nup before, but in his treatise on the law of municipal\ncorporations he states, English law, and in this\ncountry -- in the English law and in this country, quote,\nall corporations, municipal as well as private, which owe\nduties to the public are liable to indictment for\nmalfeasance as well as nonfeasance in respect to their\nduties. And, in fact, he goes on to explain that they're\nresponsible for palpable omissions, they're responsible\nfor willful and corrupt acts, and in a -- a leading case\nat the turn of the century called Ludlow versus\nCommonwealth, 56 S.W. 2d 958, the State supreme court made\nclear that the purpose of holding cities liable criminally\nwas, indeed, to punish them and to deter future acts.\nThat really was the law and, in fact, in a\nleading case from our own State, the Illinois supreme\ncourt, in upholding a criminal conviction against the City\nof Chicago for employing women for more than 10 hours,\nstates in the case of People versus City of Chicago,\n100 N.E. 194, the municipality is held to the same degree\nof responsibility as an individual.\nIn securing performance of specific duties\nimposed upon municipal corporations, the State has the\nsame power of coercion and the same method of redress in\nthe case of individuals or purely private corporations.\nThat was the law in that era. That was the law when the\nFalse Claims Act was passed and, in a battery of cases\nwhich I can bring to this Court's attention, a case called\nHoward versus Crawford County, 12 F cases 637, Chaplain\nversus The Corporations of the City of New York, 3 Paige,\nP-a-i-g-e, Chapter 573, or the Town of Plymouth versus the\nTown of Windsor, 7 Vermont 325, all cases that predate the\n1863 False Claims Act, local governments were sued in\nlawsuits for fraudulent and deceitful conduct usually\ninvolving bond issues, or trying to avoid bond\nobligations, often in terms of their responsibilities to\ntake care of their indigent citizens, and they would then\nengage in schemes to get their indigents into another\njurisdiction so the other jurisdiction would have to pay\nfor the wrong, sometimes they in fact had paid, gotten\npaid, but they --\nQUESTION: Well, the fact that local governments\nwere sued in these cases under some sort of common law\ntheory, I take it, does not necessarily answer the\nquestion of whether statutory language using the word,\nperson includes them.\nMR. MINER: Oh, I'm simply using these as\nexamples. I understand it's part of the argument that was\nmade in the reply briefs by my opponent that local\ngovernment simply cannot have the mental state of showing\neither fraud or intent to deceive, and -- and my point is\nsimply, it was not uncommon in those days for local\ngovernments to be perceived as doing fraudulent or\ndeceitful acts.\nQUESTION: Well, I'm sure that's true, but\nwhy -- why do you -- why is it that, in your opinion,\nnobody apparently with -- just, perhaps no exceptions, or\none or two, has ever sued a local government before under\nthis act?\nMR. MINER: Oh, I think -- there were suits that\nwere brought, and we brought --\nQUESTION: I mean, a handful, virtually no --\nnone. It's --\nMR. MINER: I think the answer is two-fold.\nNumber 1, as this Court recognized in Hess, it's really\nnot until the 1940s that money starts --\nQUESTION: Since 1986, that's already 16 years,\nand there are billions and billions of dollars worth of\nFederal programs that go to cities, and --\nMR. MINER: Well --\nQUESTION: I imagine somewhere in those billions\nthere are a few false statements being made by people.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. MINER: But I think the answer is that the\nmoney doesn't start coming in until 19 -- until the 1940s\nand thereafter, and in -- in 1943, after this Court's\ndecision in Hess, the False Claims Act gets emasculated,\nin the sense that it becomes very difficult to bring false\nclaims, particularly qui tam cases. The damages are\nsubstantially reduced, and there is dramatic fall-off in\nfalse claims litigation, and that's the whole purpose of\nthe 1986 amendments, to generate new life into it --\nQUESTION: Why since 1986 have we seen virtually\nno suits brought against municipalities?\nMR. MINER: Since 1986? Oh, there are --\nQUESTION: There are lots?\nMR. MINER: Oh, there are lots of suits since\n1986.\nQUESTION: Against 19 -- against municipalities?\nMR. MINER: Oh, sure.\nQUESTION: See, what I'm worried about in the\nback of my mind is, if the -- assuming that the history in\nthe 1860s is fairly inconclusive, which is the impression\nthe briefs have left me with, you can make a good argument\none way or the other, then I'd be worried about suddenly\nunleashing potentially billions of dollars of liability as\nlawyers comb through the vast number of Federal programs\nthat give aid to cities, looking for someone, somewhere,\nwho has made a false statement, and I'm sure there are\nquite a few, at -- at which point the cities would\nsuddenly discover vast liability for treble damages that\ntheir -- their citizens can't avoid. You can't sell a\nshare in a city, and -- and so that's the kind of thing\nthat worries me practically, and I wish you'd talk about\nit a little.\nMR. MINER: Well, I think there -- there are a\ncouple of answers. Number 1, I think that's -- that was\nCongress' decision that -- that it was important to\nprotect --\nQUESTION: I grant you, if the history of this\nis clear, you win. Just in case, though, I'm left\nabsolutely uncertain about what the right result is on the\nbasis of what happened in 1863, I want to, just in case\nit's relevant, to have in my mind what's likely to occur\nin the year 2003.\nMR. MINER: Oh, I -- I think what is going to --\nfirst of all, let's understand that these cases are not\nnow brought on the basis of negligent statements, or\nslight misrepresentations, but these cases involve -- this\nis a statute unlike section 1983 or the Sherman Act, that\nreally does not involve itself in imposing any new\nobligations, any new or unanticipated responsibilities on\nlocal governments.\nIt merely says, when you entered into a contract\nwith us, we're going to hold you to the deal that you\nmade, and if you breach that deal in material ways, we're\ngoing to try to get our money back, so there is -- there\nare protections in the sense that it's not any statement\nthat gets litigated here. It's got to be a serious,\nessential misrepresentation about how that money was used\nthat is at the core of these lawsuits, so that --\nQUESTION: All right. I mean, if that's the\nonly answer, though, I -- I begin to think -- I don't know\nhow much money is involved, but I was trying to make a\nguess and say, leaving out social security, food stamps\nand that kind of thing, which are individuals, my guess is\nthere -- probably it's in the range of hundreds of\nbillions of dollars that go to cities, leaving those\nthings out, and you have a few bad actors in every program\nthat maybe purposely make a lie in a statement --\nMR. MINER: Well, I think --\nQUESTION: -- to help preserve their job, I\ndon't know why they do it, and -- and there we have\nsuddenly a huge liability imposed on citizens.\nNow, I'm overstating this perhaps, but I want\nyou to tell me what the true dimension of that problem is.\nMR. MINER: Well, I don't think that -- first,\nas part of that answer, Congress has made a decision by\nthe -- by increasing damages from double to treble, there\nwill be a deterrent effect, and that one response of this\nis going to be, in fact, less fraud. There's going to\nbe -- the money will be used for the purposes for which it\nwas given to the states, and there will be a deterrent\neffect in terms of government officials not actually\nengaging in fraud and -- and a related interest in the act\nis, in fact, promoting representative, responsive\ndemocracy, and by disclosing frauds to the public, you can\ncorrect them. But the reality still is the contract, the\nlawsuit is only brought if, in fact, there's been an\nessential misrepresentation, something really basic about\nwhat was done by a local government that has actually\nmisused the money.\nLocal government has gotten the money, and, in\nfact, all the local government is giving back is, it's\ngiving back the money it wrongfully got, if it's shown\nthat it got it by -- got it falsely or -- or fraudulently.\nIt's giving back prejudgment interest and, within the\nstatute of limitations of 10 years, that is always\nvirtually going to exceed the basic laws, and it's going\nto have to pay back the -- give a share to the relator,\nwhich is an important piece of this, because Congress has\nalso recognized that, in this area, where you do have\nlarge amounts of fraud out there, there are no private\nvictims.\nThere is nobody who steps forward and says, I\nwas hurt, and therefore I'm going to bring a lawsuit to\nprotect myself and the Government will benefit, and the\nGovernment, the Court -- the Congress recognized, doesn't\nhave the research -- the resources to deal with all this,\nso it desperately needs the -- the private Inspector\nGenerals who are willing to step forward oftentimes, not\nas bounty hunters, but as -- as really offended citizens\nwho, like Dr. Chandler, who brought it to the attention of\nthe county and said, you're not doing what you're supposed\nto do, and they took responsibilities from him and he said\nagain, and you're not supposed to -- you're supposed to be\nproviding these services, and suddenly she wasn't\nresponsible for that.\nThey need these people to come in and blow the\nwhistle, because otherwise, the Government's not going to\nfind it, and they -- they recognize that oftentimes\nthey're -- they're terminated, so we've got to pay them\nsomething for coming forward, so what the Government is\nreally paying in many of the claims is not much more than\nwhat, in fact, the government -- what the -- the local\ngovernment is paying is not much more than what the -- the\nFederal Government paid in this case --\nQUESTION: Don't paint too rosy a picture. I\nmean, if qui tam actions were as desirable as you assert,\nthey would not have been eliminated in England totally,\nand vastly reduced in the United States, because they are\nan invitation to shakedowns. That's -- that's why they've\nbeen largely eliminated from our law.\nMR. MINER: That -- that's a --\nQUESTION: So you know, if -- if loving qui tam\nactions is -- is what you need to win your case, you're --\nyou're --\nMR. MINER: No, I don't -- I don't want to\nsuggest that, and -- but I -- to be honest, I'm a little\noffended, but the treatment their -- plaintiffs in here\nare no different than plaintiffs in antitrust cases, or\nsecurities cases. Many are truly wronged and are\noutraged, and there are always some who will take\nadvantage of it, but the reality is that --\nQUESTION: Most cases don't have a treble damage\nsituation, and most -- most cases don't deal with -- well,\nas this one does, with municipalities, where it's\nreally -- you know, it's play money, right? It's not\nreally money out of your pocket.\nMR. MINER: Oh, I don't --\nQUESTION: So better to pay this fellow off and\nget on with the business of the city, and -- I mean, those\nare problems with -- with a qui tam action. Let's not --\nlet's not minimize --\nMR. MINER: We're here in the United States\nSupreme Court because Cook County wasn't about to simply\nsay this is play money, and we're going to pay you. That\nisn't really what happens very often. If they're wrong,\nthey agree and they -- they pay, but they -- they also\nfight you tooth and nail, and -- and you have to prove, in\nfact, they didn't do what they said they were going to --\nwhat they committed themselves to do, but the -- the\nreality is that there are no -- in 1863, I think persons\nclearly included municipal corporations, as it included\nall corporations. There is nothing in -- in the act\nitself that in any way suggests that Congress did not want\nto apply it to -- to municipal --\nQUESTION: Were there any grant in aid -- I\nmean, it may be kind of an academic question if, in 1863,\nthe Federal Government was not giving out money to\nmunicipalities.\nMR. MINER: It wasn't, but that doesn't mean\nthat, first of all, again going back to Lafayette, this\nCourt recognized the fact that Congress in 1890 was\nconcerned about private corporations didn't preclude\nincluding municipal corporations as persons under the\nSherman Act, and -- and the fact of the matter is, local\ngovernments in that day did commercial activities. They\nbuilt bridges, they took care of the indigent at the\nrequest of States, and they were held responsible for\ntheir actions and, in fact, when they didn't live up to\ntheir responsibilities, they were routinely sued, and they\ncould well have been reached by Federal Government.\nI guess my time is up. Thank you.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Miner.\nMr. Stewart, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM S. STEWART\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT\nMR. STEWART: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe False Claims Act is the primary mechanism\nfor addressing deliberate efforts to cheat the Federal\nGovernment out of money and property. Petitioner has\nidentified no legitimate ground for excluding local\ngovernments from the coverage of the act. Local\ngovernments receive very substantial amounts of Federal\nmoney, and fraud by local governments causes precisely the\nsame harms as comparable misconduct committed by a private\nparty. Moreover, local governments are presumptively\nencompassed by the term, person, and qui tam suits against\nlocal governments raise no constitutional concerns.\nNow, with respect to the 1863 act, to begin,\nit's true that as of 1863, there was no square holding of\nthis Court to the effect that a municipal corporation\nwould presumptively be treated as a person for purposes of\nFederal statutes. However, given the materials available\nat that time, Congress would certainly have reasonably\nconcluded that municipalities were covered.\nAs Justice Souter pointed out, as early as 1826,\nthis Court quoted with approval Lord Cook's observation to\nthe effect that the term, person, presumptively includes\nboth municipal and private corporations and, again,\nbecause fraud by municipal corporations in the procurement\nof Federal --\nQUESTION: There -- that -- that case, though,\nwas dealing with a private corporation, was it not?\nMR. STEWART: That -- that's correct. There was\nno square holding to that effect, but certainly all the\nindications in the Court's opinions would have supported\nCongress in its view that the term, person, would include\nlocal governments.\nThe -- the Court in Monell held that as of 1871\na clear understanding to that effect had been established,\nand petitioner has identified no evidence that would\nsuggest that the prevailing consensus changed during the\nyears between 1863 and 1871.\nIt -- it may also be the case that, as Justice\nGinsburg suggested, the question would have been a largely\nacademic one in 1863, because local governments wouldn't\nhave received a significant amount of Federal money. The\nCongress deliberately drafted the act in a broad fashion\nso that it would encompass spending programs that were\nadopted in the future, even if they were unknown in 1863,\nand -- and the Court --\nQUESTION: Now, aren't you gilding the lily a\nlittle bit to say that Congress in 1863 contemplated that\nthere would be massive Federal spending programs in the\nfuture?\nMR. STEWART: Oh, I'm not suggesting that\nCongress contemplated that. I'm saying Congress wrote the\nstatute in a way that would cover whatever spending\nprograms came to be adopted in ensuing years, and -- and\nthe Court addressed essentially that situation in U.S.\nex rel. Marcus versus Hess, in which it said the type of\nfinancial assistance that we're dealing with here would\nnot have been undertaken in 1863, yet Congress drafted the\nact broadly, and these funds are in -- as much in need of\nprotection as other Federal money, and Congress did, in\nsome significant, some relatively minor respects, continue\nto amend the False Claims Act at intervals during the\nperiod between 1863 and 1986, and during that period, it\nbecame increasingly apparent that local governments were\nbeginning to receive enhanced shares of Federal money.\nIt also became increasingly apparent that the\nterm, person would be construed generally to encompass\nlocal governments, yet Congress retained the word, person,\neven as it amended other features of the act, and I think\npetitioner's primary argument is that even if the statute\nincluded municipalities up to 1986, the 1986 amendments\ntook local governments out of the act's coverage by adding\na punitive component to the damages available, and -- and\nthis seems implausible for, essentially for two reasons.\nFirst, the whole thrust of the 1986 amendments\ngenerally was to make the act more effective, to expand\nits coverage, to give the Government greater weapons in\nfighting fraud, so it seems very unlikely that at the same\ntime Congress would have removed from the act's\ncoverage --\nQUESTION: Well, we do have the presumption in\nthe City of Newport situation of not treating punitives as\napplicable to municipal corporations.\nMR. STEWART: That's correct. The City of\nNewport involved a different sort of statute. That is,\nthe statute at issue in City of Newport was 42 U.S.C.\n1983, and it provided an express cause of action, but it\nsaid nothing about the remedies that would be available,\nand essentially this Court's holding was, where the\nstatutory directive is for courts to use their own best\njudgment as to what remedies are appropriate, punitive\ndamages should generally not be imposed upon\nmunicipalities, but here, Congress has spoken precisely to\nthe remedies that will be applied at the end of a\nsuccessful suit.\nQUESTION: Does it give the Government any\nremedy that -- suppose that you think that the particular\nqui tam action is causing a lot of trouble in a Medicare\narea, or Medicaid area, and there are hospital grants,\nor -- you know, there are vast numbers of grants. Can you\ndo anything about it?\nMR. STEWART: Yes.\nQUESTION: What?\nMR. STEWART: The statute does authorize the\nGovernment to intervene to take over the -- the\nprosecution of a case and to settle or dismiss it, and at\nleast on occasion, the Department of Justice has\nintervened --\nQUESTION: Okay, so then, in other words the\ncity would have to come to you and say, this is a real\nmess here, there's nothing to it, and let's settle it, and\nthen you'd have to get involved and -- and deal with it.\nMR. STEWART: That --\nQUESTION: You could do it, though.\nMR. STEWART: That's correct. I -- I don't want\nto represent that this is done often, but it is an\navailable --\nQUESTION: Well, have there been a lot of cases\nsince 1986 against municipalities?\nMR. STEWART: Yes. The figures I've been given\nby the Civil Division are that 138 qui tam suits have been\nfiled against local governments since 1986. In 13 of\nthose, the United States has intervened.\nQUESTION: And settled, or --\nMR. STEWART: I don't know what the disposition\nof those -- sometimes we might intervene to settle,\nsometimes we might intervene because we believe the claim\nis meritorious and we want to -- to prosecute the suit to\nits conclusion.\nQUESTION: Do you have some dollar figures in\nthose?\nMR. STEWART: I don't have dollar figures with\nrespect to municipalities. I know overall since 1986 the\nTreasury has realized a little over $10 billion in\nrecoveries from False Claims Act suits. That includes\nboth qui tam suits and suits that were initiated by the\nUnited States.\nQUESTION: You sort of federalized this action.\nI mean, you're going to let the private plaintiffs go out,\nsue all the cities, and if you think there's something\nwrong here, you will step in and deal with it?\nMR. STEWART: Well, I don't -- I don't want to\nrepresent we will do this on a regular basis. I just want\nto say, it is an available mechanism under the False\nClaims Act in extreme situations, where public policy\nconcerns cause the Department of Justice to conclude that\nit's not in the public interest for the suit to go\nforward.\nThe other point I would make with respect to the\nCity of Newport is, again, if -- the City of Newport dealt\nwith a statute that didn't specifically address the\nquestion of remedies at all. Now, if we're correct about\nthe law as it existed before 1986, that local governments\nwere covered, and that they were subject to the double\ndamages remedy that this Court had held to be essentially\nremedial, if Congress had wanted to exclude municipalities\nfrom the act's coverage, it -- it really seems outlandish\nto think that Congress would have attempted to achieve\nthat objective by leaving the word, person, in the act\nunchanged, and by amending the act's liability provisions.\nIf Congress had believed that it was appropriate\neither to take the municipalities out of the scope of the\nact altogether, or at least to subject them to remedies\nless than those available against private corporations,\nthe natural thing to do would have been to amend the act\nso to provide. It -- it seems unlikely that Congress\nwould have attempted to achieve that objective by so\nindirect a means.\nThe other point we would make is that there may\nbe isolated situations in which an award of treble damages\nunder the act will far exceed the harm that was done to\nthe United States, but the alternative that petitioner\ncontends we believe is much worse, because it would leave\nthe act entirely unavailable for redressing all manner of\nfraud committed by local governments against the United\nStates.\nWhen we have a contract action, when we have an\nordinary suit of a dispute about money, and we regard it\nas a good faith controversy, even if we prevail at the end\nof the day, it's often the case that the United States\nwon't be made completely whole, because we incur costs of\ninvestigation, costs of prosecuting the suit, we may lose\nthe time value of money. When we're dealing with good\nfaith disputes, Congress and the executive branch have\nbeen content to treat that undercompensation simply as a\ncost of doing business.\nQUESTION: Do any Government grants or contracts\nhave attorney's fees provisions in them?\nMR. STEWART: I -- I don't know that any do. It\ncertainly would not be the norm. I mean, the -- the\nAmerican rule is that each party bears its -- its own\nattorney's fees, and so absent some express statutory\nauthority, we would not be able to recover our fees, even\nif we prevailed, and so again, Congress is willing --\nQUESTION: Well, if it's a problem, you can put\nit in your grant.\nMR. STEWART: I don't think with -- certainly as\nto municipalities I think we would have a hard time,\nwithout express statutory authority, arriving at a\ncontractual agreement that municipalities would be subject\nto such an unusual remedy and, as I say, Congress and the\nexecutive branch are willing to live with that form of\nundercompensation when we're dealing with a good faith\ndispute.\nThe False Claims Act is reserved for that narrow\ncategory of cases that involve people who don't simply ask\nfor money that, in fact, they're not entitled to, but who\nask for it knowing they're not entitled to it, and\nCongress reasonably concluded that different remedies were\nnecessary to address efforts to defraud and cheat the\nFederal Government.\nQUESTION: Is a false statement a necessary\nprerequisite to an action under these qui tam?\nMR. STEWART: There -- a false statement is one\ncategory. There -- there is a knowing requirement. That\nis, the individual entity has to knowingly submit a false\nclaim. There -- there are instances in which the claim\nmay be false even if it doesn't contain an express false\nstatement. For instance, if it's very clear that it's\nnecessary, for instance, that medical services be\nmedically necessary in order to be reimbursable, and\nthe --\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Stewart.\nMs. Lach, you have 11 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DONNAL M. LACH\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMS. LACH: Thank you.\nThe first point I'd like to address is\nMr. Miner's point that local governments were sued in all\ntypes of tort actions across the board. Congress'\nunderstanding of the suability of municipalities, and\nmunicipalities as persons in 1863 was really dependent on\nState law, because there had been no Federal expression up\nuntil that time, and across the board in the States, local\ngovernments were viewed differently.\nSome -- some local governments were viewed as\nquasi corporations and some as municipal corporations with\ndifferent levels of liability and, as I noted earlier,\nsome States made a distinction between proprietary and\nGovernment functions, so Congress' understanding based on\nState law at that time was not consistent enough to be\nevidence that Congress understood person to include local\ngovernments.\nAs for State criminal actions, in some States\nthere were misdemeanor actions against local governments\nfor nuisance actions such as failure to maintain a bridge,\nbut there is no common law with respect to -- to Federal\nstatutes. When -- when Congress enacts a criminal\nstatute, the States' understanding of -- of who is a\nperson subject to State criminal statutes is not\ndispositive of what Congress had in mind, and if it is\nambiguous and it is inconclusive, as Justice Breyer\nsuggested, it might be what -- what Congress was actually\nthinking in 1863.\nCriminal statutes are interpreted narrowly,\nand --\nQUESTION: Ms. Lach, there's one point that you\ndidn't cover in your opening argument --\nMS. LACH: Yes.\nQUESTION: -- and I'm curious how you read this\nstatute. With regard to Dr. Chandler, she claimed that\nwhen she blew the whistle, there was retaliation against\nher. There is a retaliation provision in the False Claims\nAct. On your reading of it, would she have recourse to\nthat provision against the county?\nMS. LACH: Well, under the facts of this case,\nthe county was not her employer. The -- our codefendant,\nHektoen Institute for Medical Research, was her employer.\nCook County has been dismissed from that count, but --\nbut --\nQUESTION: Well, whatever, the municipal\nemployer, would -- you say that there is no municipal\nliability for the allegedly ill-gotten gains, but what\nabout retaliation against the whistleblower? Would the\nact apply against the municipal unit to that extent?\nMS. LACH: Well, the term employer is not\ndefined in the False Claims Act, but just very recently,\n2 weeks ago, on December 31, the Eighth Circuit reached\nthis issue and, without reaching the question of what\nperson means under the False Claims Act, the Eighth\nCircuit determined that employer has a broader meaning,\nand allowed an action to proceed against a local\ngovernment, in that case the St. Louis Housing Authority\nunder, only under the whistleblower provision, and so the\nwhistleblower provision in itself does not indicate that\nlocal governments, even if an employee can sue a municipal\nentity under the whistleblower provision, that does not\nautomatically mean that --\nQUESTION: If -- if the employer -- employee\ncould do that, the -- the retaliation provision refers to\nretaliation against an employee for conduct in furtherance\nof a False Claims Act action, so if there is no viable\nFalse Claims Act claim against a municipality, then I\ndon't see how the retaliation provision could be\navailable.\nMS. LACH: The False Claims Act actions may be\ncaused by another party.\nQUESTION: But I'm talking about this very case.\nMS. LACH: Yes.\nQUESTION: I mean, if you're right that there's\nno municipal liability --\nMS. LACH: But -- but in this case --\nQUESTION: -- especially by Dr. Chandler, do I\nunderstand from your last answer that you are saying, no,\nshe's out of luck, the statute would not cover her?\nMS. LACH: Not against the county, but she still\nhas a retaliation claim against her employer.\nQUESTION: Under what law?\nMS. LACH: Under the False Claims Act.\nThere were two defendants in this case, Cook\nCounty and the institution that administered the grant,\nand that institution employed Janet Chandler, and so --\nQUESTION: And was that a private corporation?\nMS. LACH: It's a not-for-profit. It's a\nnot-for-profit corporation, and so that defendant is in\nthe case, and --\nQUESTION: But as far as a municipal employer is\nconcerned, a municipal employer, having retaliated, would\nbe, on your reading of the statute, just as free from\nresponsibility as it would be for the underlying qui tam\naction.\nMS. LACH: No, under the Eighth Circuit case a\nmunicipality can be held liable under the whistleblower\nprovision, even though -- I mean to sound very exact --\nQUESTION: That's what I was asking you about.\nMS. LACH: Yes.\nQUESTION: That's what one court has said. How\ndoes that court say that the employee's action was in\nfurtherance of a False Claims Act action if there is no\nFalse Claims Act action?\nMS. LACH: The cases that have addressed this\nhave noted there -- a local government can be in cahoots\nwith another -- another entity that submits false claims,\nthe -- the local government is aware of it, and the\nwhistleblower is an employee of the local government.\nIn that case, it is -- in that scenario, the\nwhistleblower is blowing the whistle on someone else and\nyet is employed by the local government and, under this --\nunder the Court's reasoning in -- in the Eighth Circuit\ncase and in the two cases that we cited, Satalich and Erie\nCounty, an action can still proceed against a local\ngovernment under 3730(h), even though a local government\nis not necessarily a person subject to suit.\nTo get -- to get back to the points, a lawsuit\nunder the False Claims Act can be brought if a statement\nis made in reckless disregard. Mr. Miner suggested that\nthe statement has to be clearly false, deliberately false,\nand under the 1986 amendments, the standard has been\nreduced to reckless disregard.\nAs for deterrent, by the time some of these\nactions are filed, the wrongdoer is not even in office any\nmore. It is the local taxpayers, the local residents that\nbear the brunt of -- of any False Claims Act action and\npenalty, not -- not the person that actually perpetrated\nthe wrong.\nWhen -- when in 1986 Congress expanded the\ncoverage of the False Claims Act, it did not expand the\nfraudsters. As this Court noted in Stevens, the False\nClaims Act covers just all kinds of fraud, but it does not\ncover all kinds of fraudsters, and there's no indication,\nunder our view, that local governments were among\nfraudsters that are included under this act.\nIn response to Mr. Stewart, we are not aware of\nany dismissals of False Claims Act actions that are\nbrought against local governments. The -- the Government\nhas not intervened, obviously, in -- in a number of these\nFalse Claims Act actions, but we're not aware of any\nsituation in which the Government has actually dismissed a\nclaim against a local government. These actions proceed\nand, even if -- even if the United States wanted to\ndismiss an action, they would have to justify their\ndismissal before the court, and the same with a\nsettlement. It has to be approved by the court.\nIn sum, I would like to say that Congress knows\nwhat language it needs to impose punitive damages. If\nthis Court finds that local governments are included in\nthe 1863 act, Congress did not use the requisite language\nto indicate that it meant to impose punitive damages on\nlocal governments in 1986.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Ms. Lach.\n"
