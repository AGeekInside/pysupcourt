Humberto\nAlvarez-Machain, and the United States v. the same.\nMr. Clement.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER THE UNITED STATES\nMR. CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nThe Ninth Circuit found that the arrest at issue\nhere was one unauthorized, false, and in violation of\ninternational law because it occurred in Mexico.\nNonetheless, the court found inapplicable the exception in\nthe Federal Tort Claims Act for claims arising in a\nforeign country.\nAt the same time, the court read the bare\njurisdictional terms of section 1350 in title 28 to\nprovide courts with the authority to infer causes of\naction from sources of customary international law,\nincluding treaties that the political branches have\nexpressly refused to ratify.\nThe resulting decision, which reads express\ngrants of executive authority narrowly and implied grants\nof judicial authority broadly, turns the established\nseparation of powers regime for dealing with international\nissues on its head.\nThe Ninth Circuit first construed executive\nauthority narrowly by holding that the DEA agents lacked\nthe authority to effect an arrest in Mexico or abroad.\nThat decision -- that holding has several problems, not\nthe least of which is that by its terms it would preclude\nFederal agents from making an arrest abroad even in\ncircumstances where the foreign country consents or there\nis no foreign government that is functioning to provide\nconsent.\nQUESTION: Mr. Clement, you -- you have a number\nof strings to your bow. Is -- is one of them more\nimportant than the others?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, regrettably -\nQUESTION: I mean, it -- it's unlikely that\nwe're going to go through the whole list of your -- your\nreasons for reversing here and say you're right on every\none. If we -- if we pick one, is there one that is -\nthat is more important to the Government than the others?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, regrettably, Justice Scalia,\nthis is the rare case where I think they really are of\nquite significance because what the Ninth Circuit has held\nis, on the one hand, Federal agents, including the FBI,\nwould lack the authority to make arrests abroad. They've\nalso ruled in a way that I think really reads the foreign\ncountry exemption out of the Federal Tort Claims Act and\nthen, of course, on the 1350 issue, that is an issue of\ntremendous importance to the Government and also to the\nbroader community. So I guess if -\nQUESTION: That's not your -- you're just\narguing the Federal Tort Claims Act first. Is that -- in\n-- in this argument that we're hearing now, we're dealing\nwith the Federal Tort Claims Act and not 1350?\nMR. CLEMENT: I actually intend to cover them\nboth in -- in my initial period. Now, Mr. Phillips is\ngoing to be covering just 1350 because that's the only\nissue that affects his client. But the United States is\nboth the petitioner in the case that raises the Federal\nTort Claims Act issue, but also a respondent in support of\npetitioner with respect to 1350. So it's an ambitious\ngoal in -- in 25 minutes, but I hope to address them both.\nQUESTION: Well, getting back to Justice\nScalia's question, I -- I suppose the President or the\nAttorney General could make an order with respect to\nextraterritorial arrests, and that would eliminate one\nrationale of the court of appeals. Or am I wrong about\nthat?\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I think you are wrong about\nthat, Justice Kennedy, because as I read the ruling of the\nNinth Circuit, they say that the President, the executive,\nthe Attorney General lack the authority to make an\nextraterritorial arrest, and they specifically -\nQUESTION: I guess you would have to get to that\nissue first.\nMR. CLEMENT: That's right. Now, I think -\nQUESTION: And they said even if it had the\nauthority, it -- it has to be from a high official.\nMR. CLEMENT: That actually wasn't the -- the\nreasoning of the majority opinion. There's a concurrence\nby, I think, five of the six justices in the majority that\nsaid at a minimum you'd need a high-ranking official, but\nthe majority opinion that's the law of the Ninth Circuit\nis that regardless of who approves the operation, the\nPresident categorically lacks that authority. And that's,\nof course, the -\nQUESTION: Were -- were the majority -\nQUESTION: Mr. Clement, may I ask you? Is -- am\nI correct in thinking if we agree with you on -- on that\nissue, that disposes of the entire case?\nMR. CLEMENT: I -- I think that's correct,\nJustice Stevens. Now, I would say that it -- the other\nissues in the case are logically in some respects anterior\nto that question, especially because the -- for example,\nthe section 1350 really is a question about the -- the\nvery jurisdiction of the courts.\nQUESTION: Yes, but you certainly don't have to\naddress that if you think they're wrong as a statutory\nmatter, that there -- there, in fact, was no arbitrary\narrest here.\nMR. CLEMENT: That's exactly right, Justice\nO'Connor. There's no way I can tell you that you have to\naddress those other issues.\nQUESTION: No, no.\nMR. CLEMENT: I think, though, there's nothing\nthat would stop the Court from addressing those issues,\nand those -\nQUESTION: Well, we'd have to be pretty\nambitious because some of them weren't addressed below and\nthey're contrary -- the position being taken today is\ncontrary to the position taken by previous Solicitors\nGeneral. I mean, it's kind of a new question. I'm not\nsure it was even raised and argued below.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, we think it was raised and\nargued below, Justice O'Connor, and I think the 1350 issue\nis of tremendous continuing importance.\nI mean, if I could -- if I could address the\npoint that you raised about the change in position. It is\ntrue that the United States in the Filartiga case took a\ndifferent position. Now, subsequent that -- to that, the\nadministration has -- different administrations have taken\nthe position that 1350 is just jurisdictional.\nAnd if I could draw an analogy to the experience\nthat this Court has had, in 1947 this Court upheld the\nconstitutionality of State statutes that provided\nreciprocity in inheritance laws with foreign countries and\nsaid that was okay. 21 years later, with the -- sort of\nbenefit of hindsight and the experience with State court\njudges causing foreign policy problems, this Court in the\nJourning case revisited that decision. And in a similar\nway, I think the 20-years-plus experience that we've had\nwith the Filartiga regime has made it quite clear that\nthese lawsuits provide tremendous problems for the foreign\npolicy interests of the United States.\nAnd at the same time, in the intervening -\nintervening period, if anything, this Court has made it\nquite clear what the proper mode of finding a cause of\naction is and the proper way to read a jurisdictional\nprovision.\nQUESTION: As to your first, the tremendous\nproblems, how many lawsuits are there of this 1350 nature\nand how many have even gone to judgment?\nMR. CLEMENT: Justice Ginsburg, regrettably, I\ndon't have the numbers on those.\nBut I think one thing that's important to\nemphasize is that the case doesn't have to go to judgment\nto create potential foreign policy problems for the United\nStates. And to give you just one example, there's\nlitigation that's ongoing -- hasn't gone to judgment.\nIt's quite preliminary -- in New York right now, where\npeople are seeking compensation for abuses that occurred\nduring the apartheid regime in South Africa. Now, the\nGovernment of South Africa itself, of course, has a very\ndifferent mechanism for dealing with those issues, the\ntruth and reconciliation process.\nAnd the Government of South Africa has formally\nprotested at the highest levels that these issues that are\nvery difficult issues for that government and that\ngovernment is dealing with are the subject of litigation\nin the United States courts. And I think what you see is\ntime and time again you have private litigants that may be\nvery well intentioned but are focused on only a single\nissue and they are bringing that issue into the courts,\ncreating foreign policy problems for the executive branch\nwhich the executive branch then has to try to remedy and\nameliorate.\nAt the same time, in the process of those\nlawsuits, you have courts making pronouncements on\nprinciples of international law and customary\ninternational law that may well be at variance with the\nviews of the executive branch or -\nQUESTION: Has Congress been asked to take a\nlook at the statute and to amend it or -- or restrict it\nin some fashion, 1350?\nMR. CLEMENT: I'm sure there have certainly\nbeen -\nQUESTION: Are there bills introduced to do\nthat?\nMR. CLEMENT: I don't know that any bills are\npending, but I do think that Congress is certainly fully\nable to deal with this situation.\nQUESTION: Well, I think so.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. CLEMENT: Definitely, and -- and -- but I\nthink when Congress does deal with this situation and\nactually provides for a cause of action, that provides a\nmuch better solution to this problem. And I think if I\ncould point to the Torture Victim Protection Act as an\nexample of what happened -\nQUESTION: That's all -- that's a good example\nof where Congress took action. I -- I just wonder if it\nisn't wise to look at the underlying statutory grounds\nrelied upon by the Ninth Circuit and deal with it that way\nand let Congress have a look at this thing. And I'm sure\nCongress would be interested in the views of the Attorney\nGeneral and others who think it's a concern.\nMR. CLEMENT: Again, Justice O'Connor, I mean, I\ncan only repeat that there's nothing that would stop this\nCourt from resting its decision only on the\nextraterritorial authority question and that would\ncertainly be a significant correction of the law because\nthe Ninth Circuit has left us -\nQUESTION: But, Mr. Clement, on that -- on that\npoint, your point that there must be another Federal\nstatute enacted creating a cause of action, because this\nis purely jurisdictional, I have yet to find any judge\nwho's taken that position. Even Judge Bork doesn't take\nthat position.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, I think that -- that -- I\ndon't know that Judge Randolph in his separate opinion in\nthe Al-Odah case expressly -- if you can tell exactly\nwhere he would come down on that. I -- I actually read\nhis opinion as consistent with the position we're urging,\nbut I of course may have an interest in doing so.\nI would say this, though, that I think that if\nyou read this Court's precedents for dealing with a cause\nof action -- in finding a cause of action, there's no\nquestion that the 1350 is applied pursuant to those modern\nprinciples -\nQUESTION: Well, I understand all the cases\nsince Cort against Ash support you, but we're construing a\nstatute enacted a long, long time ago, and there was all\nsorts of -- of opinion to the effect that there were at\nleast two or three causes of action that did not need to\nbe severally created: privacy, protecting ambassadors,\nand so forth. You remember the three examples even Judge\nBork recognized. If that's right, then your fundamental\nposition is -- is totally unsupported by judicial opinion.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, with respect, Justice\nStevens, let me take that in a couple of steps. First of\nall, I mean, certainly Judge Bork thought that maybe those\noriginal causes of action would be actionable in Federal\ncourt at the time.\nNow, first of all, to make clear, what the first\nCongress did is rather than pass any kind of tort action,\nit dealt with those three very offenses against the law of\nnations and dealt with them criminally. Now, it may be\nthat what Judge Bork had in mind is that at the time of\nthe framing, as a matter of general common law in the pre\nErie sense, it might have been possible to get into\nFederal court and raise those three violations against the\nlaw of nations as a tort action. I don't think, however,\nthat authority would survive Erie in any event, and I\nthink it raises some questions of its own.\nNow, I think you're absolutely right, though,\nJustice Stevens, to say that the one objection you would\nhave to applying straightforwardly the principles that\nthis Court has adopted in cases like Cort against Ash and\nSandoval is that this statute was passed at a much earlier\ntime and where the -- the enacting Congress may have had\ndifferent assumptions in mind.\nBut this Court has made clear that it's not\ngoing to sort of tether its analysis to what assumptions\nthe enacting Congress might have had in mind. It did so,\nof course, in the Sandoval decision. But you did so\nyourself, Justice Stevens, in your separate opinion in\nCalifornia against Sierra Club where you said that it may\nvery well have been that the Congress in 1890 that passed\nthe Rivers and Harbor Act probably assumed there would be\na cause of action in court, but you said it was more\nimportant to apply the principles of Cort against Ash in\nthat case than to try to divine the intent of an enacting\nCongress from 100 years earlier.\nQUESTION: Well, what about the cues that you\nget from the Torture Victim Protection Act? When Congress\nhad 1350 right next to it and there's not a word in -- in\nthat legislative history, it -- it seems to be a model.\nYes, this is a good thing, but it's -- it's -- we want to\nmake it really clear that torture is a crime against\nhumanity and we want to include U.S. citizens as\nplaintiffs as well. But they didn't say anything\nquestioning 1350.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Ginsburg, if I could\njust make sure that there's one fact that's on the table,\nwhich is you said that they -- that Congress effectively\nhad the provisions side by side, and I think it is worth\nnoting that although the Torture Victim Protection Act is\nnow codified as a note to 1350, that was not a decision\nCongress made. That was just a codification decision. So\nCongress itself didn't say insert in the code after\n1350 -\nQUESTION: But there was discussion of 1350 by\nthe proponents of the Torture Victim Protection Act.\nMR. CLEMENT: There certainly was and I think\nthat -- that basically the enactment of Congress is -\nsort of says nothing about 1350 one way or another. What\nI would point to the Torture Victim Protection Act,\nthough, is a model of why it makes sense to ask Congress\nto get involved in creating a cause of action because when\nit does, it provides clear direction to the court and also\nacts in a way that minimizes tensions with allies because\nyou're absolutely right to suggest that torture is one of\nthe most well-established norms of international law.\nYet, notwithstanding that, when Congress addressed the\nissue in the TVPA, it provided specific definitions of the\nprohibited conduct. Then it also provided clear guidance\nto the lower courts by providing for a specific statute of\nlimitations of 10 years.\nAnd then, as I also indicated, it -- it put in a\nspecific statutory exhaustion provision which suggested\nthat litigants shouldn't rush to United States courts if\nthe courts in the area where the events actually took\nplace are open for the claims. I think that last\nprovision is particularly telling because it shows that\nwhen you take the normal course and insist that Congress\nget involved in the process of creating causes of action,\nCongress as a political branch with foreign affairs\nresponsibilities of its own -\nQUESTION: But, Mr. Clement, if I -- if I\nremember, some of the briefs have taken the position that\nthat's already an aspect of international law, a\nrequirement that you should first exhaust in the country\nwhere the conduct took place, which would -- would narrow\nthe scope of the statute if we -- if we adopted that view.\nMR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Stevens, there\ncertainly are international jurists that will argue that\nexhaustion principles are a principle of international\nlaw. But I think that's exactly what ends up happening if\nyou leave these issues to the courts and don't insist on a\ncause of action is you leave the courts as a matter of\nFederal common law, I guess, trying to interpret\ninternational law sources to come up with things like\nexhaustion. A statute of limitations I would think would\nbe even more difficult. Principles of damages. And\nthey're supposed to do all of that as a matter of Federal\ncommon lawmaking with the only guide they have in the text\nis the 33 words in 28 U.S.C. 1350 which, by their terms,\nreally only address jurisdiction. So I think that would\nput the courts in a very difficult position, and I think\nin contrast, the Torture Victim Protection Act shows the\nvirtues of waiting for Congress to take some action before\nsomebody would get involved in this kind of situation.\nQUESTION: But in the -- in the --\nQUESTION: -- on 1350 address the question of\nthe authority of the DEA agents to make the address, and\nif you have time, the Federal Tort Claims provision that\nit's governed by events that occur abroad as opposed to\nthe headquarters doctrine.\nMR. CLEMENT: Yes, Justice Kennedy, and thank\nyou.\nLet me start with the -- the arrest authority\nquestion because, as I said at the outset, the view of the\nNinth Circuit is that there is categorically no arrest\nauthority abroad, even if a foreign nation consents. And\nthat really cannot be correct. And I think respondent\nrecognizes that implicitly by not defending that aspect of\nthe Ninth Circuit ruling, but rather insisting on a rule\nthat would give arrest authority only with consent.\nAnd with respect, though, I think that is not a\nworkable rule for the Federal courts, and if I could use,\nby way of example, the arrest of the individual who's the\nconvicted killer in the CIA shootings, Mir Aimal Kasi.\nThis is an individual who was arrested by FBI agents in\nPakistan in 1997. Under the Ninth Circuit's approach,\nobviously, this individual could not be arrested by FBI\nagents as a categorical matter. But under the approach of\nrespondent, the Federal courts would have to inquire into\nthe circumstances surrounding the arrest and to inquire\nspecifically into whether the Government of Pakistan\nconsented to the arrest by FBI agents in Pakistan in 1997.\nNow, I think the prospects for interfering with\nsensitive diplomatic relations, not to mention the\ndifficulty of divining any principles for discerning the\nrequisite degree of consent, are manifest in both those\ncases, and I would suggest that the far better approach is\nto read section 878 of title 21, consistent with its plain\nterms, to give the DEA the arrest authority for any felony\ncognizable under the laws of the United States without\nreading in either a territorial limitation or a limitation\nbased on consent.\nQUESTION: Doesn't the Mansfield Amendment tug\nthe other way? That was -- when Congress looked at this,\nthey restricted DEA agents' authority, not granted it.\nMR. CLEMENT: With respect, Justice Ginsburg, I\nactually think the Mansfield Amendment supports the view\nof the United States here, and indeed, under the view of\nthe Ninth Circuit, it's entirely unclear what the\nMansfield Amendment was supposed to accomplish. It was\nunder their view limiting an authority that did not exist\nbecause what the Mansfield Amendment does is put specific\nlimitations on the authority of Federal agents. It\napplies only to direct arrests, only to foreign police\nactions, and only in the context of narcotics control\nefforts. And then even there it provides specific\nexceptions for exigencies and the like. And so I think\nwhat that reflects is that there may be circumstances\nwhere an extraterritorial arrest authority raises concerns\nand Congress may react to those, as it did in the\nMansfield Amendment, but the very fact that there is this\nspecific and tailored limitation on DEA authority suggests\nthat there must be some broader grant of authority that\nincludes extraterritorial arrests.\nQUESTION: But isn't -- isn't it possible to\nread -- and I'm not sure it should be read this way, but\nisn't it possible to read the Mansfield Amendment as\nsimply saying DEA agents should not go out in foreign\npolice raids when the police of the foreign countries make\nthe raids. Stay out of it. That's one way to read the -\nthe foreign police action qualification.\nMR. CLEMENT: That's certainly -- that is one\nway you could read it, Justice Souter. And I think\nthere's two implications from that. One is, of course, if\nthat's the way you read it, the Mansfield Amendment\ncertainly doesn't bar the action here.\nQUESTION: It doesn't -- but it doesn't imply\nanything one way or the other.\nMR. CLEMENT: Right. But here's why I think it\nstill implies something about the scope of section 878\nbecause section 878 of title 21 is not just the authority\nfor the DEA to make arrests, it's basically the source of\nall their statutory authority for law enforcement efforts.\nAnd I think that even participation in the midst of a\nforeign police action, as you were envisioning the\nreference in the Mansfield Amendment, is at least a law\nenforcement involvement of the DEA. And so I think that\nunless 878 authorizes extraterritorial actions by DEA\nagents, be it arrests, be it simply carrying a firearm, or\nbe it engaging in other investigatory activities, then so\ntoo I think the language of the Mansfield Amendment, even\nif it limits the very specific kind of law enforcement\nactivity by the DEA, still suggests that 878 by its terms\nis not strictly limited to the territory of the United\nStates.\nQUESTION: Of course, you get there by assuming\nthat anything that the DEA does is law enforcement.\nMR. CLEMENT: That's a fair point, but I think\neven if that's a bit of a broad conception, I certainly\nthink assisting in the context of a foreign police action\nshould qualify as law enforcement.\nIf I could say just a -- a few things about the\nforeign country exemption before I sit down. I think that\nthere is a very clear error in the analysis of the Ninth\nCircuit because this is really a -- a rare case where you\nhave an arrest that is false and tortious only because it\noccurred in Mexico. You have the lower courts recognizing\nthat the plaintiff is entitled to damages only for the\nperiod he was in Mexico, and every element of the tort\ntook place in Mexico. Yet, nonetheless, somehow the court\napplies this headquarters doctrine to say that the foreign\ncountry exception applies.\nAnd I think what that illustrates is that\nalthough the headquarters exception may have been a\nhelpful gloss on the language of the statute when it was\nfirst developed, as it's been interpreted by the Ninth\nCircuit, it becomes a free-floating exception to the -- to\nthe foreign country exception that allows a plaintiff to\nskirt the language of the statute simply by alleging any\ndegree of U.S. involvement or direction.\nIf I could reserve the remainder of my time for\nrebuttal. Thank you.\nQUESTION: Very well, Mr. Clement.\nMr. Phillips, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS\nON BEHALF OF THE PRIVATE PETITIONER\nMR. PHILLIPS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nI guess I'd like to begin, Justice O'Connor,\nwith your question about whether or not this is an issue\nthat the Court ought to -- the -- the underlying question\nof the meaning of the section 1350 is an issue the Court\nought to resolve as opposed to the narrower -\nQUESTION: Or whether we have to.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, you clearly don't have to,\nand -- and certainly Jose Francisco Sosa would be\nperfectly content to have the judgment of the court of\nappeals reversed on the ground that the arrest here was\nneither arbitrary nor the detention prolonged in a way\nthat would no -- under no circumstances violate the law of\nnations.\nBut the truth is, as one of the amicus briefs\nfor the respondents points out, there are at least 35\ncases that they cite in their briefs that have been filed\nunder section 1350. Those causes of action involve, each\none, numerous individual defendants. There is a\nsignificant reason I think for this Court to try to\nprovide some additional guidance to the lower courts with\nrespect to the meaning of section 1350, particularly when\nthe rules of construction, as Justice Stevens quite\nrightly pointed out, so clearly point in a particular\ndirection. This is a purely jurisdictional statute. It\nsays it in so many terms.\nThe only language that the respondent embraces\nas suggesting that it's not purely jurisdictional is the\nword violation, a word this Court specifically recognized\nin Touche Ross is not a rights-creating term, but instead\nagain merely provides jurisdiction. This Court has\nrepeatedly held that when you have merely jurisdiction,\nyou do not imply a cause of action. That's the -- the\nMontana-Dakota Utilities decision of the Court. Obviously\nthat's embedded in Sandoval.\nQUESTION: Well, there are indications early in\nthe country's history that it was viewed differently at\nthe time of its adoption, and the -- an Attorney General\nearly on took that view. It -- it's not easily answered.\nI -- I can understand how with the recodification where it\nthen is put in with other jurisdictional sections that it\n-- it looks somewhat different, but it's had a pretty long\nhistory.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But -- but, Justice O'Connor -\nQUESTION: And it's hard to ignore all that.\nAnd it's so easily changed by Congress if indeed it is a\nproblem.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think the presumption\nought to go the other way is that to the extent that the\nlower courts have created a problem, it would be incumbent\nupon the Court to try to fix that problem if that's an\navailable option -\nQUESTION: You agree it's easily changed by\nCongress?\nMR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry?\nQUESTION: You agree it's easily changed by -\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I don't think anything is\neasily changed by Congress these days.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. PHILLIPS: But -- but, Justice O'Connor,\nyour -- your point brings to mind, frankly, Justice\nFrankfurter's observations in the Romero case about\ncomparing the historical efforts here to archaeology and\nthe -- and as one who has now spent the better part of the\nlast 6 months on what struck me as a historical dig that\naccumulated a whole lot of information, virtually none of\nwhich remotely provides me with any insights as to which\nthe Congress of 1789 really had in mind at the end of the\nday, I think the Court would do extremely well here to go\nback to the first principles of statutory interpretation.\nI'm sorry, Justice O'Connor.\nQUESTION: It probably had in mind problems of\npiracy.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, it clearly had in mind\nproblems of piracy, but as even Blackstone made clear,\nproblems of piracy are matters of public concern. They\nare not matters of private concern. And while it may well\nbe that Congress did have in mind down the road that there\nmay be subsequent enactments that would, in fact, invoke\nsection 1350 as an exercise of jurisdiction -\nQUESTION: And then we have the case of the\nattack on the early diplomat and so on. I mean, it -\nit's had a long history.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, first of all, there's an\ninteresting gap in that history because you go up till\nabout 1807 and then nothing happens until 1982. So it's a\nlittle difficult to think that there are a whole lot of\nhistorians out there thinking that there was a clear basis\nfor a cause of action tapping in to the law of nations and\nto those kinds of rights.\nQUESTION: Maybe we didn't assault any\nambassadors during that later period.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. PHILLIPS: I certainly hope we didn't.\nQUESTION: But, of course, I -- most references\nto international law were in admiralty cases where there's\njurisdiction anyway.\nMR. PHILLIPS: To be sure, absolutely. And that\n-- that's why --\nQUESTION: Yes, but not in the ambassador cases.\nMR. PHILLIPS: No.\nQUESTION: It was pretty clearly, it seems to\nme, one of the things that the statute would have covered\nfor the assault of the French ambassador.\nMR. PHILLIPS: It's not -- well, it's not 100\npercent clear to me because the -- the problem you have\nthere is that it would clearly have been a public right\nand it was -- and, you know, the Congress in 1790\nimmediately passes a statute that -- that imposes criminal\nsanction for this. And indeed, Justice O'Connor, even in\nthe -- even in the Pennsylvania case where it arose out of\ncommon law, it was a -- it was criminal action that was\nbrought against the attacker on the -- on the ambassador.\nIt was not a civil action. No one sought damages.\nQUESTION: But, Mr. Phillips -\nMR. PHILLIPS: This is a very unknown\nenterprise.\nQUESTION: One of the -- one of the things that\nI keep bumping up against -- and I want to be sure you get\nan opportunity to comment on it -- that -- 1980, I guess\nit was, the Second Circuit got into the act and decided\nthat case. So we've had 25 years, and we had a bunch of\nopinions. And I don't think a single Federal judge has\ntaken the position that you're advocating.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I don't -- I don't -- I\ndon't disagree with it. I think that's absolutely true.\nOn the other hand, I don't think a whole lot of those\njudges gave quite as much thought or attention to this\nissue as the litigants before this Court have in this\nparticular case. And the briefing here is obviously\nextraordinary both in its breadth and depth. And at the\nend of the day -- and -- and I don't think anybody tried\nto mine the historical materials in quite the same\nintensity as we have coming here.\nAnd as I said -\nQUESTION: I thought -- I thought you'd probably\nhave a -- a right to recover damages for piracy, wouldn't\nyou have? I mean, wouldn't they have thought in 1789 you\ndid?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, it's not clear, but if you\nwould have, it would have been under admiralty\njurisdiction.\nQUESTION: Well, admiralty and maritime law then\nI thought were viewed as a brooding omnipresence.\nMR. PHILLIPS: They were. They were.\nQUESTION: They weren't the law of Athens. They\nweren't the law of Constantinople. They weren't the law\nof Rome. They were the law of nations.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well -\nQUESTION: And that -- that -- you can find lots\nof quotations along those lines.\nSo if in fact that was so then and you're\nlooking for a modern counterpart, what's wrong with what\nthe European Commission said? I'd be interested in having\nyour views on that brief.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, let -- let me answer the\nfirst question because the difference between\nincorporating the law of nations from the -- into\nadmiralty jurisdiction, it had a tradition of 1,000 years.\nThe idea of interpreting the law of nations or\nincorporating the law of nations into section 1350 or its\nprecursor back then where it only benefits aliens seems to\nme a quite improbable undertaking by Congress in 1789.\nQUESTION: It would not be improbable in a world\nwhere law was a brooding omnipresence in the sky to think\nthat we preserve it in the case of admiralty, maritime,\nand certain instances of international law. But Erie\nsends it to the states once they decide to make that\nseparation. That's an ex post event. That doesn't cast\nan idea in the minds of Congress. So if you have Congress\nex ante thinking, of course, this is international, as\nthey thought maritime law was, then our task is to try to\ntranslate that into modern terms. And that brings me back\nto the European Commission.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But I -- I -- the difficulty I\nhave with that, Justice Breyer, is I think this Court has\nrebelled from the idea that it's going to incorporate a\nmassive brooding omnipresence -\nQUESTION: Not massive. Very limited.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But, see, I don't think -\nQUESTION: That's why I keep bringing up the\nEuropean Commission.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But, see, that's my problem with\nthat -- with that argument because it doesn't -- I don't\nsee what the limitation is, Justice Breyer. What we're\ndealing with is if you're saying the law of nations,\ncustomary international law, whatever that means -- and we\nknow from the Ninth Circuit it doesn't have to be anything\nthat the United States itself embraces. These are rules\nthat are imposed upon us under these -- under these\ncircumstances. It would seem to me that if you're going\nto bring it into the modern era, you ought to bring it in\nwith the recognition that there are core separation of\npowers concerns in this context that ought to -- ought to\ncaution hesitation in exactly the same way -\nQUESTION: All right. I agree with you about\nthat.\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- that the federalism principle\nwas -\nQUESTION: So what -- what is -- what I got out\nof that brief -- and I refer to one, and I want to get\nyour views on that -- is it wouldn't be difficult to have\na limited cause of action, try to find the counterpart,\nand say, of course, if Congress preempts the field, as\nmaybe it did with torture, that's out. Or if Congress\nimplicitly is hostile to the cause of action, that's out.\nAnd if Congress is neutral and the State Department comes\nin and runs through any one of a set number of defenses,\nincluding political question, that's out. And there we\nhave -- what's left is a core of basic human rights\nviolations that's been internationalized, that's\nconsistent with international law as applied in a lot of\nplaces and avoids the political problem. That's what I'm\nlooking to shape, and I want your view on that because we\nhave a brief that tries to do it.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But that brief assumes that 1350\ndoes more than provide jurisdiction.\nQUESTION: Yes, that's correct.\nMR. PHILLIPS: It assumes that there is a cause\nof action.\nQUESTION: That's correct. That's why -- that's\nwhy if I don't accept your first argument, can we achieve\nyour practical objectives by following that approach?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, to be sure. There -- I\nmean, that would take you back to, I think, Justice\nO'Connor's question which is, could you resolve this\nparticular case by reference to an understanding of the\nlaw of nations that -- that rejects any notion that this\nwas an arbitrary act or that the detention here was\nprolonged within the meaning of the Restatement (Third) of\nForeign Relations? And -- and to be sure, that's a\nnarrower basis for deciding and that is the focus of the\ncommission's brief.\nQUESTION: It may also -\nMR. PHILLIPS: We don't have any quarrel with\nthat on -\nQUESTION: It may also be correct.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, to be sure, it's correct.\nQUESTION: I mean, you're not -- you're not\nsaying that's a wrong interpretation, are you?\nMR. PHILLIPS: No, no. Absolutely not. And if\nyou're in that world and you're looking at those -- at\nthose circumstances, you obviously would have to take a\nvery narrow approach in -- in terms of trying to -\nQUESTION: And presumably if there is some cause\nof action alleged in any of these actions that have been\nor might be filed, that deal with something that is\ncovered basically by a treaty that Congress has said is\nnon-self-executing, I assume that would displace any\ncommon law background.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think that you raise an\nimportant point there which is the parallelism between the\ntreaty prong and the law of nations prong of the statute\nbecause if, as -- as Judge Bork explained in his separate\nopinion, the thing that disturbed him the most about this\nwas the suggestion that somehow on behalf of aliens, you\nwould create a right under the treaty that you would -\nthat -- that citizens would never have had the right to\nbecause it wouldn't be self-executing. It seemed quite\nimprobable that Congress would have intended that. So by\nparity of reasoning, why would Congress have wanted to\ncreate this kind of access into a brooding omnipresence of\nlaw that is essentially very difficult to confine?\nAnd I -- and I go back to Justice Breyer's point\nwhich is, to be sure, there are ways to try to narrow\nthose rules. My position is you do better not to try to\ngo down that path in the first place. You would do better\nto recognize that this is a purely jurisdictional statute\nand thereby force Congress to look in the future at\nstatutes like the Torture Victim Protection Act.\nQUESTION: Okay. Mr. Phillips, let's -- let's\nassume I accept your argument that there are good reasons\nnot to invite the -- the -- today's brooding omnipresence\ninto court without something more from Congress, that\nthere are good reasons to be concerned about separation of\npowers problems. Assume also that I am convinced or the\nCourt is convinced that at the time the statute was\npassed, there was an understanding that there were certain\noffenses to which the jurisdictional provision would -\nwould provide access for litigation, piracy offenses and\nthings like that. How do I distinguish today's situation\nfrom yesterday's situation and hold your way without being\ninconsistent with what I take it the understanding was at\nthe time in incorporating some offenses in a common law\nkind of way?\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think the easiest way to\nensure consistency there would be to insist that there be\na -- a real clarity, both that the United States is -\nQUESTION: No, but that -- that then just takes\nyou to Justice Breyer. He says -\nMR. PHILLIPS: Well, no. Then that's my answer\nto your question.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Because I think in that world -\nQUESTION: You're saying the only way to get\nwhere I have suggested we might go is Justice Breyer's\nway?\nMR. PHILLIPS: No. I -- I don't know that it's\nthe only way, but it is the simplest way to get to that\nkind of consistency if you accept the premise that\nCongress necessarily believed in 1789 that there would be\na cause of action created from language discussing merely\njurisdiction.\nQUESTION: Let me -- well, I'm not -- no. I'm\nnot suggesting that it -- that the cause of action was\ncreated from the language discussing jurisdiction. I am\nassuming that the cause of action was assumed to be out\nthere and that the jurisdictional provision opened the\ndoor to the courthouse to get the cause of action in.\nMR. PHILLIPS: Can -- can I challenge that\nassumption -\nQUESTION: Yes, yes.\nMR. PHILLIPS: -- Justice Souter? Because if\nyou look at the historical record and go back to the 1781\nContinental Congress saying to the States, there is no\nbrooding omnipresence, we need you, States, to go out,\ntake action to deal with ambassadors to protect them -\nQUESTION: Is it clear that there was nothing in\nthe absence of -- of action by the States? Or is it clear\nthat there were only a -- let's say, a few and rather\nlimited causes of action, those largely arising -- well,\nwe have the ambassador case. We -- we have offenses at\nsea.\nMR. PHILLIPS: But -- but -- the -- the -- I -\nI think there are no causes of action because the -- if\nyou take seriously -- why -- why would the Continental\nCongress say to the States, enact a statute to protect\nambassadors if ambassadors are otherwise being protected?\nWhy does Connecticut then go forward and enact a law that\nnot only provides criminal protection for the ambassadors\nbut goes -- goes beyond that and provides civil remedies,\nliability and damages for attacks on ambassadors, if there\nis this brooding omnipresence?\nThe point is -- my -- my basic point is I don't\nthink the historical record will demonstrate to you at all\nthat these causes of action existed. And therefore, this\nis not a simple instance of the courts -- of the Congress\ntrying to tap in to a body of law. What it was doing was\ncreating a jurisdictional basis to be filled in in the\nfuture. In that sense, I don't think the Congress of 1789\ncame to the table to deal with this issue dramatically\ndifferently than the Congress today would -- would deal\nwith it. They enact jurisdictional provisions all the\ntime. To be sure, 1331 has eliminated the need for a lot\nof this.\nBut the reality is you -- you create the\njurisdiction and then you fill the vessel. And this Court\nhas got a -- you know, an obviously long line of -- of\nopinions in which it's recognized jurisdiction doesn't\ncreate Federal common law rules, jurisdiction doesn't\ncreate a right of action. It simply creates jurisdiction.\nAnd if this Court goes back to that core principle as the\nmethod for trying to interpret section 1350, it will avoid\nall of the problems and then force Congress to take the\naction that I think is important here.\nThe -- the Torture Victim Protection Act has a\nstatute of limitations, has an exhaustion requirement, has\na definition of torture. Congress wasn't implementing\nsection 1350 there. It was implementing its obligations\nunder international agreements dealing with the question\nof torture.\nMy guess is we have similar kinds of provisions\nthat are out there that we probably ought to be trying to\nfind causes of action for, and Congress should take those\nup. But what shouldn't happen is to allow the courts\nexercising what I submit is an extraordinary Federal\ncommon law power to go out, find causes of action, and\nthen proceed to define all of their elements, all of their\ndefenses without the benefit of any guidance, which is\nprecisely how you end up in a situation today where the\nNinth Circuit has said that in a situation where a Mexican\nnational assists the United States to -- to enforce an\narrest warrant, and the circumstances presented in this\ncase that he's not only engaged in an arbitrary act, but\nthat the detention is -- is wrongful in its own right, not\n-- even though there's not a shred of evidence that the\nUnited States would have embraced that view with respect\nto its own obligations as a matter of international law.\nOnce you open this door -\nQUESTION: Well, we can deal with that issue.\nMR. PHILLIPS: And you should deal with that\nissue, but -- but, Justice O'Connor, I think you should\ntry to deal with the broader issue because there are just\ntoo many of these cases out there creating too much havoc\nfor no good reason, if I'm right, that the Congress in\n1789 did not have in mind something anywhere -- anything\nlike what we've seen since 1982. And if it's just as easy\nfor this Court then to go back to first principles of\nstatutory interpretation based on the language of the\nstatute and say enough is enough.\nIf there are no -\nQUESTION: They did use the word tort, which is\n-- was -- was surprising to me that they used it at that\nearly date. That's -- that's one of my problems I have\nwith your position.\nMR. PHILLIPS: They did use the word tort. It's\nunfortunately, obviously having spent, as I said, a long\ntime in my historical dig, I haven't been able to figure\nout why they pulled out the word tort under those\ncircumstances. It doesn't really have an analog. It\nwould have been more sensible if they had -- had used -- I\nmean, they didn't actually need the term limit. I -- I'm\nsure it's a term of limitation. I think what they were\nconcerned about were -- were debts. I think that's what\nthey were worried about. They didn't want aliens to be\ncoming in and trying to -- trying to deal with debts.\nThey were -- they were trying to stay away from that.\nThey were worried, obviously, at the end of the day with\ninjuries.\nBut -- but I agree with you, Justice Kennedy,\nit's an odd choice of words, given how little law was\ndeveloped on torts generally and how no law was developed\nunder the law of nations involving torts specifically.\nI've already taken up enough of your time.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Phillips.\nMr. Hoffman, we'll hear from you.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL L. HOFFMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. HOFFMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nLet me start with the meaning of the alien tort\nstatute. It's our position, as you know from the briefs,\nthat -- that Congress meant what it said, that Congress\nactually decided in 1789 to pass a statute that allowed\naliens that had tort claims that -- involving the\nviolation of the law of nations to bring them in Federal\ncourt, and that by using the word tort, what the -- the\nFounding Fathers were referring to was a body of common\nlaw that was well known to be part of the law in the\nUnited States during the colonial days and at that time.\nQUESTION: May I ask -\nQUESTION: How do you -- go ahead.\nMR. HOFFMAN: I'm sorry. I said the -\nQUESTION: May I ask -- may I ask this question\nas a matter of history because your right on the point\nnow? Is there anything in the early history that gives\neven the slightest suggestion that Congress wanted to\nlegislate with respect to anything that did not happen in\nthe United States or on the high seas?\nMR. HOFFMAN: Well, I think that the -- the\nkinds of law of -- law of nations violations at the time\nwould have included piracy, which clearly -- in terms of\nanother country, I mean, it's certainly possible that a -\nan assault on an ambassador could have taken place in\nanother country.\nQUESTION: Yes, but the only ones they knew\nabout had taken place in the United States.\nMR. HOFFMAN: Well, the ones that they were most\nconcerned about was the 1784 Marbois incident and the one\nin 1788, the Dutch ambassador in New York City, were the\nones most on their mind.\nQUESTION: They certainly would not have been\nconcerned about an assault on the -- say, the English\nambassador in Paris by a Frenchman.\nMR. HOFFMAN: Well, that's not entirely clear, I\nmean, because if there was a -- one of the things that was\nbefore them was the transitory tort doctrine. And the\ntransitory tort doctrine, which this Court has recognized\ndates back at least as -- as far as Mostyn v. Fabrigas,\nwhich is a 1774 Lord Mansfield opinion, which involves\nironically a false imprisonment claim against a government\nofficial which took place outside the territory of England\nand which was found to be cognizable in common law tort\nwithin the -- the courts of England. And so the -\nQUESTION: Well, you wouldn't need the -- the\nlaw of nations for a transitory tort. I mean, if it's\na --\nMR. HOFFMAN: Excuse me?\nQUESTION: You -- you don't need the law of\nnations to sue on a transitory tort.\nMR. HOFFMAN: No, of course, not.\nQUESTION: If it was a tort in the country where\nit was committed, you -- you could sue on it elsewhere.\nMR. HOFFMAN: No. And in fact, I think that one\nof the main purposes of the alien tort statute was to\nprovide a Federal forum for those claims when they came\nwithin the United States.\nQUESTION: If -- if there was this background of\n-- of understood common law that you say, how do you\nexplain the 1781 action of the Continental Congress which\nis concerned about the fact that -- that there's no\nredress for -- for assault on ambassadors, among other\nthings?\nMR. HOFFMAN: Well -\nQUESTION: And they asked the States, do\nsomething about it.\nMR. HOFFMAN: Well, certainly the -\nQUESTION: If that -- that was part of the\nunderstood common law, what is the problem?\nMR. HOFFMAN: Well, one of the -- one of the -\nfirst of all, Longchamps is one response to that in the\nsense that in Pennsylvania they didn't need a statute.\nThey didn't pass a statute and -- and the -- the courts in\nPennsylvania understood that the law of nations was part\nof their common law.\nQUESTION: Yes, but that goes against the notion\nthat there was an understood common understanding that was\nthe background. It was understood one way in\nPennsylvania. It was understood another way by -- by the\nContinental Congress.\nMR. HOFFMAN: No. I think what -- what -- the\nway we would interpret the 1781 resolution is that the\n1781 resolution was more a function of the Continental\nCongress' inability to enforce the law of nations on\nbehalf of the Nation under the Articles of Confederation.\nAnd so they had no way to respond to any incident,\nincluding the Marbois incident after that resolution.\nNow, they did -\nQUESTION: Then why did they pass a resolution\nsaying to the States, enforce the common law?\nMR. HOFFMAN: Well, what they did is they asked\nthe -- the States to enforce the law of nations. And\nConnecticut passed that particular statute in order to do\nit. Other States did not act in response to that, but\nthat's not to suggest that they didn't decide that they\nalready had adequate remedies.\nMoreover, the resolution did more than just ask\nthe States to enforce the law of nations. It also\nprovided a new -- which was not a common law thing -- an\nindemnity for the United States if the United States had\nto do something to take up the slack for the States.\nAnd so from our standpoint, what -- what the -\nthe 1781 resolution really does is that is the -- the step\nis from 1781, feeling completely frustrated and not able\nto enforce the law of nations, coming to the Constitution\nwhere there's lots of evidence that the Founding Fathers\nbelieved that we had to as a Nation enforce the law of\nnations, having incidents like the Marbois incident and\nthe -- the attack on the ambassador in New York right\nbefore them, deciding in the alien tort statute to make\nthose claims available.\nNow, what -- what the Government and -- and\nPetitioner Sosa want the Court to believe is that having\ngone through the trouble of expressing to the world, to\nthe people, in terms of the -- that -- that we would as a\nNation enforce the law of nations, that then the Congress\njust didn't do it because basically Congress didn't do\nanything else to enforce the torts in violation of the law\nof nations clause of the Judiciary Act of 1789.\nQUESTION: Part -- part of the problem I have\nwith -- with your -- your proposal is that it leaves it up\n-- it leaves it up to the courts to decide what the law of\nnations is. And -- and the Ninth Circuit here derived a\nlaw of nations principle from, among other things,\ntreaties that we had refused to sign, international\nagreements that we had reserved against. I -- I find that\na -- a serious interference with the ability of -- of the\npolitical branches to conduct our foreign affairs.\nMR. HOFFMAN: Well, there are two -- I have two\nresponses, Justice Scalia, to that question.\nOn the first one, in terms of whether the law of\nnations is too indeterminate -- boundless I think is the\nword that's used in the petitioner's brief -- this Court\nhas affirmed at least in -- on two occasions that I'm\naware of, in U.S. v. Smith and in Ex parte Quirin, the\nfact that Congress can easily by reference incorporate the\nlaw of nations and that it is not indeterminate enough to\njustify a death sentence in the -- against the pirate in\nthe United States v. Smith in 1820 and 120-some-odd years\nlater against Nazi saboteurs in Ex parte Quirin. The\nCourt -- it is perfectly permissible for the Congress,\nparticularly in 1789, to incorporate by reference what\nlawyers at that time knew to be the law of nations. It's\nnot -- Congress doesn't have to exercise its -\nQUESTION: Those -- those are pretty polar\ninstances, piracy and -- and sabotage in -- in time of\nwar. We're talking here about other matters that are not\n-- not at all polar.\nMR. HOFFMAN: Well, in the -- in the -\nQUESTION: And I -- sure, I can tell you some\nthings that everybody would agree is against the law of\nnations, but there are a lot of things in between that the\nEuropean Union may think is bad and we may not think is\nbad.\nMR. HOFFMAN: Well, but actually I think that\nthat is -- would not be a correct view of -- either of\nwhat the courts did or what the courts ought to do. In\nfact, there are a relative handful of cases under the\nalien tort statute in the last 25 years in which there\nhave been findings about violations of the law of nations.\nThey have tended overall to involve claims of torture,\ngenocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity, clearly\nnorms that the United States has supported from Nuremberg\non down.\nQUESTION: But that's not your case.\nMR. HOFFMAN: Well, you're right, Chief Justice\nRehnquist. That is not my case.\nBut my argument about why this is arbitrary\narrest and detention is, number one, there is a core\narbitrary arrest and detention norm that an -- that an\narrest and detention can't happen without legal authority.\nQUESTION: Well, there was legal authority here.\nThe -- the -- he was indicted by a grand jury.\nMR. HOFFMAN: Well, he was indicted by a grand\njury and there was an arrest warrant that was limited to\nthe territorial boundaries of the United States.\nQUESTION: Well -\nMR. HOFFMAN: There was no authority to arrest\nhim in Mexico.\nQUESTION: -- yes, but I -- I think there's a\ngood argument that section 878 has extraterritorial\napplication, that DEA agents are not prevented from\ncarrying out their duties across our borders.\nMR. HOFFMAN: Well, I think that the -- the\ndistinction -- and -- and -- that needs to be made on that\nis that it is clear that the Congress was aware, as we all\nare aware, that the Drug Enforcement Administration has\ninvolved in activities in other countries of a variety of\nactivities.\nQUESTION: Well, like in that case of -\nMR. HOFFMAN: They're supportive.\nQUESTION: -- United States v. Bowman dealing\nwith a ship and -- and exercise of criminal law\nenforcement outside our borders and we thought there was\nin that case no presumption against extraterritoriality.\nMR. HOFFMAN: Well, that's -\nQUESTION: And I think there may well not be in\nthis DEA context as well.\nMR. HOFFMAN: The -- the -- I hope to persuade\nyou otherwise on that point. But the -- the distinction I\nwould draw, first of all, is that the fact that the DEA is\ninvolved in some activities abroad doesn't mean that\nCongress intended that any DEA officer or employee had\nworldwide arrest authority at their discretion.\nQUESTION: No, but we certainly -- in Bowman we\nsaid that the Coast Guard could enforce revenue laws -\nMR. HOFFMAN: Sure.\nQUESTION: -- outside our borders, and very\nlikely a DEA agent can enforce our laws beyond our\nborders.\nMR. HOFFMAN: Bowman -- Bowman was about\njurisdiction to proscribe. And I think the -- the\nGovernment relies on Maul as the case for -- on the\njurisdiction to enforce. And -- and the Maul case is very\ninteresting actually because what it does is it says that\nthe Coast Guard can be engaged in activities on the high\nseas which are extraterritorial, but they're not within\nthe territory of another state.\nAnd in fact, the -- the language in Maul is very\nclear to talk about the law of nations and the\nrestrictions on the ability of the Coast Guard to do\nthings. They say they're not at issue in that case\nbecause the high seas is a place where that kind of\nauthority can be maintained without any conflict with any\nother nation or without any conflict with -- with the law\nof nations. What they -- they were also dealing with a\nU.S. ship and a -- and a U.S. citizen, and so there was no\neven issue about whether they had the authority on the\nhigh seas to seize a foreign-flagged ship.\nQUESTION: How can you read the statute to\ninclude the one and not include the other? I mean, it -\nit doesn't -- it doesn't slice the bologna that thin. It\njust says they have authority to enforce the laws. Now,\nif -- if you say that they can't arrest in Mexico, I\nassume they can't investigate in Mexico. I don't see how\nyou can read the -\nMR. HOFFMAN: I don't think that it -- I don't\nthink that -\nQUESTION: How can you read the statute to\npermit the one but not permit the other?\nMR. HOFFMAN: Well, I don't think that it\nfollows that -- that you have to assume that Congress\nintended that -- that entire statute had to have complete\nextraterritorial effect.\nNow, but there's an additional principle other\nthan the presumption against extraterritoriality, which\nwould slice it one way or the other perhaps, although I\nthink what the Ninth Circuit said is that we're talking\nabout extraterritorial arrest here and that provision and\nwhether that's extraterritorial both in terms of the\nlanguage of the statute and the background of the statute,\nthe background of -- of cooperative activities, not\nactivities in violation of the law of nations, but -\nQUESTION: Tell me what language could possibly\nallow you to draw that -- that distinction in the text of\nthe statute. There's no language that allows you to do\nthat -\nMR. HOFFMAN: Well, the -\nQUESTION: -- between arrest and investigation.\nMR. HOFFMAN: I think that the difference would\nbe that the Congress -- one of the arguments that the\nGovernment is making, because they don't -- there's\nnothing in the -- in the statute that tells you that\narrest authority is extraterritorial either. It doesn't\nsay anything. It's boiler plate authorization language.\nRight?\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. HOFFMAN: And -- and under the Government's\ntheory, in fact in their reply brief, they say that the\ncitizens arrest statute in California is the same to\nsection 878, which means that 36 million people in -- in\nthe State of California can engage in extraterritorial\narrests too.\nQUESTION: I didn't like that --\nMR. HOFFMAN: And so there has -- there have to\nbe some other limitations and some other inquiries -\nQUESTION: Okay. And you said -- you said you\nhad another limitation and a further principle.\nMR. HOFFMAN: Yes.\nQUESTION: What's the second principle?\nMR. HOFFMAN: Let me -- the -- the other\nlimitation -- the other -- well, there are two really.\nOne is the Mansfield Amendment, which we have laid out in\nour brief. And basically our position is that what the\nMansfield Amendment means is that the DEA was\nspecifically -\nQUESTION: Well, look, there -- that amendment\nrefers to foreign police action. There wasn't any such\nhere.\nMR. HOFFMAN: But in the -- on the Government's\ntheory -\nQUESTION: None. I don't see how it falls\nwithin that at all.\nMR. HOFFMAN: But in the Government's theory,\nwhat that would mean is that if -- if the Government\nwanted to arrest a drug trafficker in Mexico and they -\nthey would be barred by the Mansfield Amendment from\nactually being involved in that arrest, even participating\nin it unless the ambassador to Mexico approved it under\nthe -- the rules, but under their theory, they could\nactually hire the people that they hired in this case to\narrest the trafficker. Now, I don't -- that's -- but\nthat's what they're saying. And I -- I -\nQUESTION: What does the term direct mean?\nMR. HOFFMAN: Well, I -- direct -- what -- what\nhappened in this case was certainly directly effecting the\narrest. What the -- what the DEA officials in this case\ndid is they directed that he be arrested.\nQUESTION: Well, in that sense every arrest is a\ndirect arrest. There's no such thing as an indirect\narrest I suppose on that theory.\nMR. HOFFMAN: Well, I -- I think what the -\nwhat the difference -\nQUESTION: Doesn't direct refer to the -- to the\nactions of the agents?\nMR. HOFFMAN: But I think what the difference\nwas is the Mansfield Amendment was broader than just\narresting. The Mansfield Amendment came out of a trip\nthat Senator Mansfield took to Thailand where he was\nconcerned about the -- the fact that DEA agents were -\nwere even in any operations with foreign law enforcement\nand they -- he thought that that caused problems to our\nforeign relations and -- and the exercise of law\nenforcement authority in other countries.\nNow, that was -\nQUESTION: If that was so, why didn't he just\neliminate from this as part of any foreign police action?\nWhy is that phase in there?\nQUESTION: Yes.\nMR. HOFFMAN: Well, but the thing is from our\nstandpoint, I mean, this is a foreign -- this -- this is a\npolice action in a foreign country.\nQUESTION: Oh, no, no, no, no.\nQUESTION: But that's not -\nQUESTION: You -- you don't think foreign police\nmeans foreign police?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. HOFFMAN: I --\nQUESTION: You -- you think it's foreign police\naction.\nMR. HOFFMAN: I really think that -- that the -\nthe intent of the Mansfield Amendment was not to allow DEA\nagents to get involved in arrests that caused problems for\nour foreign relations. And that's exactly what this\narrest did.\nQUESTION: Okay. You had -\nQUESTION: Oh, I think you have to look very\nclosely at that language and -- and I think it may well\nnot fit this case.\nMR. HOFFMAN: Well, the other -- the other\nprinciple, though, which I think is the one that -- that I\nthink clearly applies to this case is -- is the principle\nthat statutes need to be interpreted to be consistent with\nour international law obligations, the Charming Betsy\nprinciple. And -- and there, even in the Maul case, the\n-- the Maul Court was certainly aware of the fact that\nthere were limits in the international law about the\nability to enforce our law extraterritorially.\nQUESTION: You -- you had -- you told me you\nwere going to give me two more principles.\nMR. HOFFMAN: That was the -\nQUESTION: One was Mansfield. What -- what's\nnext?\nMR. HOFFMAN: This was it. The Charming Betsy\nis number two.\nQUESTION: Okay.\nMR. HOFFMAN: Sorry.\nBut -- but that's the other principle, and I -\nI think the one that -- that probably is most applicable\nto the situation is the principle that you should presume\nthat Congress did not intend to authorize violations of\ninternational law, which is what occurred in this case.\nAnd whether that's --\nQUESTION: They did it. I mean, that's -\nthat's the -- the two things that maybe you're going to\naddress now that are bothering me the most and they're\nrelated is what the DEA says is that this was a person who\npeople in Mexico tortured to death. This was not that\nthey went in there for narcotics reasons. They wanted to\nget the people who had tortured an American to death.\nAnd how do we decide such a thing? Should each\nof the courts of the United States decide that\nindependently?\nIt's related to the problem of Mr. Mbeki.\nApartheid is a terrible thing, but according to the\ngovernment, Mr. Mbeki, I take it -- that's the highest\nauthority, the President of South Africa, has told the\nUnited States that the judicial efforts to give\ncompensation to victims are interfering with his efforts\nto build a democratic South Africa. Now, I have to\nchoose between those two? I'd say democratic South\nAfrica, protective of human rights has it all over\ncompensating the victims even though that's terrible.\nAnd what I'm asking you is what kinds of\nprinciples do you suggest that will allow Mr. Mbeki to\ndecide what's right there and not 40 independent Federal\njudges somewhere. And how will we decide such things as\nto whether this is the kind of effort to get a torturer or\nwhether it is a violation of -- of law? What are the\nprinciples of limitation in these areas?\nMR. HOFFMAN: Well, I think that the -- the\nfirst -- in terms of the Alien Tort Claims Act, which I\nthink is where the South Africa example is coming from\nmostly, I think that the -- there -- there are several\nlimitations that are inherent in the jurisprudence. One\nis that it's very difficult to find a customary\ninternational law norm, and it's not -- it wasn't even\neasy in this case.\nIn fact, if there was -- if the President\nauthorized this kidnapping, there's no claim. I should\nget that out of the way. There's no claim under -- under\nthe Alien Tort Claims Act. There's no claim under the\nFederal Tort Claims Act. If the President and probably if\nthe Attorney General said it is in the -- America's\ninterest to kidnap this person and bring him to justice, I\ndon't have a claim. But the reason I have a claim -\nQUESTION: How can -\nMR. HOFFMAN: -- is that the President didn't do\nthat.\nQUESTION: How is that consistent with an\nacknowledgement that there is an automatically self\nexecuting brooding omnipresence of customary international\nlaw?\nMR. HOFFMAN: Well --\nQUESTION: That's just inconsistent with such a\nnotion.\nMR. HOFFMAN: Well,no. It -- it's actually not.\nI mean, what the -- what The Nereide said or what this\nCourt said in The Nereide is until there's an act, the\ncourts will enforce the law of nations.\nIn The Paquete Habana, what the Court said was\nwe will enforce the law of nations, even against the\nmilitary, for violations for the law -- laws of war unless\nthe President -- unless there's a controlling executive,\nlegislative, or judicial act. And so if the President\ntakes a controlling executive act, that's it. It might\nstill be a violation of international law, but -- but\nunder this Court's -\nQUESTION: What about the commander-in-chief of\nthe armed forces? Would that -- would that suffice?\nMR. HOFFMAN: I don't know the answer to that,\nalthough -\nQUESTION: Or the Secretary of State. I want to\nknow how far down you go.\nMR. HOFFMAN: I -- I think that that it probably\nis the case that it goes down to the President and his\ncabinet. In The Paquete Habana, this Court decided that\nthe decision of an admiral who was charged with the\nenforcement of the blockade of Cuba during the Spanish\nAmerican War acted in violation of customary international\nlaw by seizing two fishing boats. Those fishing boats\nwere returned. Well, they were actually sold. There were\ndamages issued based on customary law by -- by this Court\nfor the violation of the law of nations.\nAnd -- and in -- in that case, you had a\nsituation where the dissenters and the Government said\nthis is a political question. You -- you shouldn't be\nable to decide this. The Court said, no, we can decide\nthe law of nations. We can find the law of nations. We\ncan even find that the law of nations has evolved so that\nthe way that fishing vessels were treated during the\nNapoleonic Wars might have been a matter of comity, but by\nthe Spanish-American War, they had ripened into customary\nlaw, which we can find through the methods that have been\nemployed by the courts of this country since the very\nbeginning of the republic and before the republic was\ncreated.\nQUESTION: Mr. Hoffman, a moment ago you cited\nthe Charming Betsy for a principle that we defer to\ninternational law. Where is that? I don't see any\nreference to it in your brief.\nMR. HOFFMAN: Oh, no. We have an entire\nsection, Your Honor, in the -\nQUESTION: Well -- yours is the red brief?\nMR. HOFFMAN: Yes, and it's actually in the\nbrief in -- in 485, and it is the entire section -\nQUESTION: Oh, the other red brief.\nMR. HOFFMAN: It's -- it's section I(C) from\npages 17 through I believe 28.\nQUESTION: Thank you.\nMR. HOFFMAN: And -- and the importance of that\nprinciple in this case is that -- the -- the Government\nwants you to read authorizing statutes as saying that any\nlaw enforcement agent, employee, or official by just\nhaving a general arrest authority, automatically has\narrest authority over the world. There's nothing in the\nlegislative history. There's nothing in any history that\nsays that Congress even had the slightest thought that\nthey were authorizing worldwide jurisdiction in the\nterritory of other sovereign states by passing this\ngeneral enactment.\nQUESTION: What if the other -- what if the\nforeign state has no objection to it? What if the foreign\nstate agrees, we would like help from American DEA agents?\nMR. HOFFMAN: We -- we accept -\nQUESTION: Under your theory, you'd say -\nMR. HOFFMAN: No.\nQUESTION: -- this -- this statute simply does\nnot authorize foreign arrests.\nMR. HOFFMAN: That -- that may be the -- on the\npresumption of extraterritoriality and the way that -\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. HOFFMAN: -- that the Ninth Circuit read it.\nUnder the Charming Betsy principle, what our principle is\nis the one -- we adopt what the -- what the United States\nadopts as the principle of international law, which was\nlaid out in Judge Sofaer's opinion in March 1980 through\nthe Office of Legal Counsel which basically said on a\nreview of all the international authorities, they found\nthat it was a violation of international law to forcibly\nabduct somebody from another country if that country\nprotested.\nThe protest actually eliminates the problems\nthat the Government is talking about in terms of finding\nconsent and whether there's another government that's\nrecognized, all those things, because what Judge Sofaer\nsaid in the opinion was that acquiescence equals consent.\nThe -- if a foreign government wants to assert\nthat limit on -- on U.S. law enforcement authority under\ninternational law, it had better make a protest, as Mexico\ndid in this case. And one of the reasons this is such an\nunusual case is that you just don't find many situations\nwhere there has been any kind of extraterritorial law\nenforcement where there has been a sovereign protest.\nQUESTION: Okay, but there -- there -- I think\nthat the conduct that was the basis for the indictment\nhere, the kidnap and torture and murder of a U.S. DEA\nagent in Mexico, can be punished in the United States in\naccordance with international law under the effects\ndoctrine because we can criminalize conduct occurring in\nanother country that has an effect on our country's\nsecurity or core national interests, which clearly this\ndid.\nMR. HOFFMAN: I completely agree with that.\nThere's no question. There has never been in the case\nthat -- that the statute under which Dr. Alvarez was tried\nwas extraterritorial. There's no question in -- in my\nmind, I don't think anybody's mind, that the United States\nin making that statute extraterritorial was acting\nconsistent with its international obligations.\nQUESTION: Right.\nMR. HOFFMAN: But there is a difference between\nthe jurisdiction to proscribe within international law and\n-- and the jurisdiction to enforce those laws.\nWhat the -- what the Government says is that if\nyou don't give us this authority, unlimited, anybody -- it\nmight even be the Forest Service that could do it because\nthey might have the same statute -- that -- that it's\neither that or war.\nQUESTION: Suppose he'd been guilty, convicted,\n30 years. Okay? Now, does he get damages from the United\nStates on your theory for every day he spent in prison?\nMR. HOFFMAN: Well, for one thing, the -- the\ncourt -- the court below cut off damages.\nQUESTION: I'm not talking about this case. I'm\ntalking about an identical case -- an identical case.\nHe's convicted, sent to prison for 20 years. Does he get\ndamages for each of those days?\nMR. HOFFMAN: Certainly not under the rule\nbelow, and I think -\nQUESTION: What's the right rule in your -\nMR. HOFFMAN: What's the right rule? You know,\ntheoretically I suppose that if you are imprisoning\nsomebody in violation of international law, you should\nhave a remedy that responds to that and that's -\nQUESTION: Okay. That's one of the problems. I\nwant -- but I -- I've tried to focus the main problem by\ncalling to mind Mr. Mbeki, and the reason is because it's\nsuch a good example. I would have thought apartheid does\nviolate norms of international law certainly where\nviolence attaches. I would have thought there are lots of\nprivate people who aid and abet. I would have thought it\nwould be easy to find a victim and bring a lawsuit, and I\nwould have also thought it's not totally beyond question\nthat the president of a country could think they're\ncounterproductive -- those lawsuits -- in terms of the\ndemocracy we're trying to build. So I've tried to create\nsome tension there, and I want to know you, who want a\nrule -\nMR. HOFFMAN: Right.\nQUESTION: -- that allows these suits in the\ncourt -- how does it become limited in this circumstance,\nan analogous circumstance?\nMR. HOFFMAN: I apologize for not completing my\nanswer. But I started with the idea that there were a\nlimited number of norms, but there's more to that.\nThere's, of course, the act of state doctrine. And so -\nQUESTION: That's why I chose in my example\naiding and abetting by a private citizen of the very bad\nthing of apartheid leaving -- leading to deaths and -- and\nviolence, et cetera, as happened. And -- and if I can't\n-- now, the European Commission has a method here in their\nbrief. So I'm interested is that a proper method.\nMR. HOFFMAN: Well, I think it -\nQUESTION: You want to propose some other\nmethod, but to propose no method --\nMR. HOFFMAN: Well -\nQUESTION: -- it seems to me, is to concede -\nMR. HOFFMAN: What --\nQUESTION: -- the validity of the Government's\npoint about lawsuits here.\nMR. HOFFMAN: Well, I think that the -- first of\nall, particularly in the corporate realm, there has not\nbeen a judgment yet against a corporation in an alien tort\nstatute case. There just hasn't. And many of them have\nbeen dismissed. Some have been dismissed on the political\nquestion doctrine. We've mentioned some in our brief.\nWhere there is a conflict between this country's foreign\npolicy and the progress of the lawsuit, at least in some\ncircumstances, the case can be dismissed on political\nquestion grounds. On some other cases, it -- it will be\ndismissed on act of state grounds.\nThe -- the one pertinent limitation -- and -\nand it's actually been raised by the other side -- is\nexhaustion of local remedies. And -- and what -- what -\nthe answer you got on exhaustion of local remedies was\nsome theorists think that that's part of international\nlaw. It is part of international law. In fact, in a lot\nof the early alien tort statute cases, defendants did\nraise exhaustion of local remedies.\nOne of the reasons that it hasn't been a big\nissue is that a lot of the people that are coming to this\ncountry to vindicate their human rights are refugees that\nhave fled from places like Burma or revolutionary Ethiopia\nor other places that have no legal system and could not\npossibly give a local remedy.\nNow, that won't be the case for -- for cases\nthat arise in other contexts where there is. And I think\nthe courts can dismiss based on exhaustion of local\nremedies where there are remedies to be done, and that is\nnot something that -- the -- the court would apply that as\npart of -- of international law, as part of the law of\nnations because it is part of the law of nations.\nAnd so the TVPA actually took the lead from the\nalien tort statute in having an exhaustion of local\nremedies issue, and I think that a lot of the -- the\nissues about separation of powers and -- and the -- the\nparade horribles about what might happen because of these\ncases, this is -\nQUESTION: But wouldn't that doctrine require\nyou to lose this lawsuit?\nMR. HOFFMAN: Excuse me?\nQUESTION: Wouldn't the doctrine of exhaustion\nof remedies require you to lose this lawsuit?\nMR. HOFFMAN: Well, no, actually because I don't\n-- we -- we can't get a remedy in Mexico against -\nQUESTION: Why not?\nMR. HOFFMAN: We certainly can't get a remedy in\nMexico against Mr. Sosa. Mr. Sosa is here, and the United\nStates is here. And what remedy would he get in a Mexican\ncourt if he can't -- this is a transitory tort. I mean,\nthis is the kind of transitory tort that would have been\nwell understood by Lord Mansfield, false imprisonment.\nThat was -\nQUESTION: What tort issue -- what --\nQUESTION: That's fine. Why -- why couldn't you\nsue him in Mexico, service by mail?\nMR. HOFFMAN: We could sue him here in the State\ncourt. He has a State cause of action. And in fact, one\nof the -\nQUESTION: Why -- why can't you sue in Mexico?\nWe're talking about exhaustion of local remedies? Why\ncouldn't you have sued him in Mexico?\nMR. HOFFMAN: Where do we get -- where do we get\njurisdiction over him?\nQUESTION: He committed the tort in Mexico.\nMR. HOFFMAN: We don't have personal\njurisdiction over -\nQUESTION: You -- you don't need it. You -- you\nserve by mail.\nQUESTION: That's notice. You certainly do have\npersonal jurisdiction over him where he acted.\nMR. HOFFMAN: Well, the only thing I can say is\nthat for -- we have now been litigating the case, as you\nknow, since -- for 12 years, and the exhaustion of -- of\nlocal remedies has not come up as a defense. And I think\nit would be a defense that the defendant would have to -\nQUESTION: That's because a lot of people don't\nthink it's part of international law probably.\nMR. HOFFMAN: But --\n(Laughter.)\nMR. HOFFMAN: I -- I think -- I think it is and\nit has been raised.\nQUESTION: What about restricting these lawsuits\nto instances of violation of basic norms of international\nlaw where the international law itself foresees universal\njurisdiction in, of course, the absence of some indication\nfrom Congress that they don't want such lawsuits?\nMR. HOFFMAN: I think -\nQUESTION: What about that -- that will not help\nyour case I don't think in this instance, but I'm looking\nin your opinion as an -\nMR. HOFFMAN: I guess the question -- the\nquestion is from our standpoint the -- the Founders wanted\nto enforce the law of nations. What's changed is that the\nlaw of nations has changed. Since Nuremberg, there's an\ninternational law of human rights. Some -- some rights\nwithin that have ripened into customary law. And so the\nreason you have more cases is that you have a different\nworld than you had in 1789. That's really what has\nchanged.\nQUESTION: It's the human rights enforcement\npush, is it not?\nMR. HOFFMAN: Well, I think it -- I think it is.\nAnd in fact, a Justice of this Court started it. I mean,\nit's the Nuremberg principle that individuals can be\nresponsible for the violation of international human\nrights. And what the -- what the alien tort statute has\ndone is provide a forum for people who have suffered\nterrible human rights violations in general in these cases\nto come here and have their rights adjudicated when they\nfind the defendant here.\nSo when one of my clients met her torturer at a\nhotel in Atlanta, Georgia, she was able to go to a court\nand -- and get a remedy for her torture because her\ntorturer was here and she was here. And that's the -\nthat's a paradigm of what -- what this law has been -\nQUESTION: What about -- what about the\nprinciple that you have some such violations which will\nwork well if judges in every nation try to enforce them\nand others where the judges will fall over themselves with\ncontradictory decisions creating a mess? And one good way\nto separate the former from the latter is to look to see\nif universal jurisdiction is part of or at least foreseen\nby or at least consistent with the international law norm.\nI'm looking for ways that are going to avoid the problems.\nMR. HOFFMAN: I would have two -- two responses\nreally. One is that the universal jurisdiction principle\nis primarily a principle of the assertion of criminal\njurisdiction for certain international crimes. And so I\ndon't think that it fits very well -\nQUESTION: But in many countries, criminal\njurisdiction is --\nMR. HOFFMAN: That's true.\nQUESTION: -- accompanied by civil\njurisdiction --\nMR. HOFFMAN: No, that's true.\nQUESTION: -- because they're right in the\ncriminal courtroom.\nMR. HOFFMAN: That's true, and there are\ndifferences in domestic statutes around the world in terms\nof -- of enforcement of these kinds of human rights. I\nmean, they're incorporated in various ways. There are\nuniversal jurisdictions that -- statutes that apply to\nsome but not all of these claims.\nI think that the -- the -- our -- our objection\nto that would be that it would be trying to -- to find a\nlimit that's really not in the statute and really is a -\na function, we think, for Congress to decide. Congress -\nthere was a question before, has anybody -- has there ever\nbeen an -- an attempt to change the alien tort statute?\nAs far as we know, there has never been a bill in Congress\nto ask for any change.\nIn fact, the administration in the Filartiga\ncase and in Kadic later basically said -- in Filartiga,\nthey said it would be a problem for our foreign relations\nif we refused to recognize a remedy in this kind of case.\nAnd in the Torture Victim Protection Act, it is\nvery clear in the Senate and House reports, as clear as I\nthink Congress could possibly be, that Congress liked the\ndevelopment in Filartiga case. Congress rejected the\narguments that are being made to you by the petitioners in\nthis case, explicitly with reference to Judge Bork's\nopinion in Tel-Oren, and saw none of these problems with\nthe enforcement of the alien tort statute.\nQUESTION: Well, they did -- they did in the\nTort Victim Protection Act provide a definite claim,\nsomething with a -- with a statute of limitations, which\nis not here, something with a definition of what torture\nis, not tort, the world of tort, so that -- that that\nlooks like a model of specificity where 1350 is just the\nopposite.\nMR. HOFFMAN: Well, I think -- well, that's\nbecause of when 1350 was drafted. But I think that the -\nI think that those problems are not as insurmountable as\nthey're made out to be. I think the courts have been able\nto deal with those problems in the way that courts have\ndealt with them in other areas of the law. I mean,\nsection 1983, for example, doesn't provide a lot of those\nthings either, and courts have been able to fashion the\nrules that would govern those kinds of cases -\nQUESTION: But you -- you do -- in 1983, you do\nhave reference to very specific things, to provisions of\nFederal statutory law or to provisions of the\nConstitution.\nMR. HOFFMAN: Well, and you have -- you have in\nsection 1988 a -- a reference to State law, and this Court\nhas often had reference to State law and sometimes it's\nhad reference to rules that are based on -- on different\nreasons.\nBut the -- the courts -- I mean, for example, in\nthe statute of limitations, the statute of limitations in\nthe Alien Tort Claims Act was -- was shorter before the\nTorture Victim Protection Act, and since the Torture\nVictim Protection Act, the courts have applied the statute\nof limitations that Congress believes is appropriate to\nthose -- to those cases.\nSo I -- I want to -- I know I still don't answer\nyour -- I'm trying to answer your question. And then my\n-- my -- our feeling about that is that those kinds of\npolicy choices, where there are differences of opinion\neven between administrations about how this should be -- I\nmean, that's clear. Some administrations think this is a\ngreat way to proclaim to the world our commitment to the\nlaw of nations. Our feeling is that is completely\nconsistent with what the Founders thought about the law of\nnations too. They were proclaiming their commitment to\nthe law of nations and the alien tort statute does that in\nthe international human rights field today. We have said\nthat around the world and -- and it is true.\nIf there need to be modifications to it,\nCongress can modify it. There's no question about that.\nAnd even in -- with respect to particular norms, because\nthis is enforcing the law of nations and because it can be\ndisplaced by -- by controlling executive decisions, we're\nprotected. There's no norm that's been enforced that the\nUnited States disagrees with. There's a disagreement in\nthis -\nQUESTION: What about a suit based on some norm\ncovered by a treaty where Congress -- where the Senate has\nsaid it's non-self-executing?\nMR. HOFFMAN: Right. Well, I think there are\ntwo different -- there -- there are two different issues\nthere I think.\nOne is if the treaty -- if the United States in\nthe treaty has issued a reservation to the norm, then I\ndon't -- I don't think it's enforceable. I think there's\na reservation, we don't accept that norm.\nI think the -- the difference with the non\nself-executing declaration is that that doesn't mean that\nwe don't accept the norms. The non-self-executing\ndeclaration is -- is we might or we might not. I mean, it\ncould be evidence and it might be something that would be\nlooked at by a court, but the -- what -- what -- because\nArticle VI of the Constitution says that treaties are the\nlaw of the land and shall be enforced, including by the\ncourts of the -- of the States, if the United States\nentered into human rights treaties without that\nreservation, then many norms which are not customary norms\n-- in the -- in the International Covenant on Civil and\nPolitical Rights, there are probably a handful of norms\nthat would be accepted as being customary norms and many\nthat would go beyond anything that people would argue as\ncustomary. So the -\nQUESTION: Who -- who decides this? I'm really\nam sort of in the woods as to -\nMR. HOFFMAN: The courts. The courts can decide\nthis.\nQUESTION: I see. What -- what --\nMR. HOFFMAN: The courts have always decided\nthis kind of thing.\nQUESTION: 51 percent of the countries of the\nworld accept them? They're -- they're customary norms?\nMR. HOFFMAN: No. If there's a division of\nopinion, as this Court said in Sabbattino -- and in fact,\nin Sabbattino, the United States Government came into the\nCourt and said, you should decide this case because we\nthink the law is -- there's a violation of international\nlaw here. And the Court decided, no. There's a diversity\nof opinion and -- and the act of state doctrine precludes\nus from issuing an opinion in that.\nAnd so where there is a genuine diversity of\nopinion -- and I would say we have cited several cases\nlike the Flores case which rejects arguments based on\nenvironmental torts. There are a number of cases that\nhave brought business kinds of torts that -- that have\njust been thrown out of court. And -- and I think that\nthe -- the courts have done -\nQUESTION: May I just recall Sabbattino? I\nthought the assumption the Court made in Sabbattino was\nthat there was a clear violation of international law, but\nnevertheless, the act of state doctrine applied. That's\nmy recollection of Justice Harlan's opinion.\nMR. HOFFMAN: I don't -- that would not be what\nI would view it as. I think what -- what Justice Harlan\nsaid was there -- there was diverse opinion within the\nworld about the violation of law.\nQUESTION: That's not what prompted Justice\nWhite's dissent. He was so upset by the fact that it was\na clear violation of law, but we nevertheless would give\nthe defense act of state doctrine to Cuba. But you may be\nright, but that's my -- it was my recollection of the\nopinion.\nMR. HOFFMAN: My point I guess would be, though,\nthat where there is diversity among nations or about the\nnorm, then I don't think they can be forced -- enforced\nwithin the alien tort statute.\nAnd I think that in the South Africa case, for\nexample, I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if that would be\ndismissed. It's -- I think there's a motion to dismiss\npending, and it may be that -- that that's the kind of\ncase that ought not to be in the courts. I don't know\nmuch about the details of it, so it's very hard to make\nthat kind of comment.\nBut you know, I think that there are -- there\nare doctrines that the Court has, both domestically and\ninternationally, to make sure that these problems don't\nbecome the kind of problems that are there. And if they\nare problems, they can be remedied. They can be remedied\nby Congress. And it seems to us that that's where -\nthat's where the decision should be made.\nI see that my time is up.\nAnd the -- the closing remark I -- I would make\nreally is that in -- in Ker v. Illinois in 1886, this\nCourt denied a remedy to someone who had been kidnapped\nfrom another country and said that he could be tried\nnotwithstanding that violation. The Court also said that\nthat person would not be without a remedy, that all that\nperson had to do was bring a suit for trespass and false\narrest, and the Court was sure that that statement would\nprovide a remedy in the courts.\nAfter Dr. Alvarez's acquittal, he took up the\nCourt on that suggestion that he might get a remedy under\nthe statutes that Congress has -- where Congress has\nauthorized the courts to provide redress for -- for those\nkinds of torts and for those kinds of violations of the\nlaw of nations. And to -- all that we are asking from\nthis Court and all we asked in the courts below is that\nthe courts perform the kinds of functions that courts have\nperformed for hundreds of years before the republic, all\nduring the republic in providing a damage remedy for the\nviolation of personal rights.\nAnd upholding the modest judgment in this case\nis not going to undermine our national security. It will\nonly affirm the values that have made the -- the country\nas great as it is.\nThank you very much.\nQUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Hoffman.\nMr. Clement, you have 4 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT\nON BEHALF OF PETITIONER THE UNITED STATES\nMR. CLEMENT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nIf I could first address the argument that is\nadvanced by respondent that we can solve the\nextraterritorial arrest problem by simply insisting on\nthere being consent. I think this Court in its first\nAlvarez-Machain opinion at footnote 16 made the point that\nthere are some issues that are best dealt with in\ndiplomatic relations between countries and not in the\ncourts of a single party.\nAnd I think consent for an extraterritorial\narrest is a prototypical example of that. In diplomatic\nrelations between countries, a certain amount of ambiguity\ncan make the diplomatic relation function and so there may\nbe varying degrees of consent.\nIn the context of a United States judicial\nproceeding, though, the tendency is to bore down and find\nout whether there was some modicum of consent, some legal\nstandard of consent. And I would point again to the\nexample of Mir Aimal Kasi as how having courts bear down\nand figure out the exact extent of consent between\nPakistan and FBI agents in 1997 would not have been a\nproductive exercise for the courts.\nA very brief note on the Ker opinion, Ker\nagainst Illinois that was just mentioned at the closing of\nrespondents' argument. It's true the Court said that\nthere might be an action for kidnapping in that case, but\nthis Court did not opine in any way what would be the\nrelevant law in that kidnapping that occurred in Peru. I\nwould suggest if it had looked at that issue, it would\nhave suggested that the law that applied would be the law\nof Peru in the same way that if there is any law that\napplies to the false arrest here, it is the law of Mexico\nand that only underscores that this arrest, even if it\nwere actionable somehow, would fall within the foreign\ncountry exemption to the Federal Tort Claims Act.\nIf I could say two things about section 1350.\nThe -- first of all, in terms of trying to divine exactly\nwhat was in Congress' mind when it enacted this provision\nin 1789, I would say that that is exceedingly difficult\nand that strongly suggests that what the Court should do\nis simply apply its rules for when there is a cause of\naction. But if there is any agreement at all as to what\nat least one of the events that led to the passage of the\nstatute was, it was the events involving ambassadors in\nthe United States and violations and assaults on those\nambassadors. And I think the reaction to those assaults\nis telling.\nFirst, there were no civil actions ever brought\nin the courts that anybody is aware of to remedy those\nactions. What were brought are common law criminal\nactions. That's what the Longchamps case in Pennsylvania\nwas. It was a common law criminal action.\nNow, I don't think anybody would suggest that a\ncommon law criminal action in law of nations somehow\nsurvives this Court -- this Court's decision in Hudson,\nsaying there's no longer any common law criminal\njurisdiction. In the same way, to the extent that the\nCourt -- the Congress may have had in mind some general\ncommon law action that was available, there's no\nparticular reason why that decision should withstand the\nErie decision.\nBut again, I think it is noteworthy that there\nwas no civil action in response to those incidents. What\nthere was is the 1781 Continental Congress action, and it\njust didn't ask the court -- the State courts to do\nsomething about this. It told the courts to authorize\nactions. The one court -- the one State that took up the\nchallenge was Connecticut, and if you look at what\nConnecticut did, it is very telling because first they put\nin a jurisdictional provision. Then as a separate\nprovision, they used language that is rights-conferring\nlanguage. It seems obvious that Congress with section\n1350 did the former but not the latter. There is\njurisdiction, but there is not any rights-creating\nlanguage.\nNow, it may be a bit anomalous to apply this\nCourt's current conception to an old statute like the\nJudiciary Act of 1789, but this Court has done it before.\nThank you.\nCHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr.\nClement.\n"
