        "content": "(11:05 a.m.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument\nnext in Case 08-974, Lewis v. The City of Chicago.\nMr. Payton.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN A. PAYTON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. PAYTON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it\nplease the Court:\nOn 11 separate occasions, Chicago used an\nunlawful cutoff score to determine which applicants it\nwould hire as firefighters. There's no dispute that\nthe cutoff score had an adverse impact on qualified\nblack applicants and was not job-related.\nThe only question presented is whether each\nuse of the cutoff score in each of the hiring rounds was\na separate violation of Title VII. An affirmative\nanswer to that question is both the best reading of the\nstatute and the soundest policy.\nSection 703(k) of Title VII provides that in\na disparate impact case, as this case, an unlawful\nemployment practice is established -- those are the\nwords -- \"is established\" when, quote, \"a respondent\nuses an employment practice that causes disparate impact\non the basis of race,\" close quote.\nSection 703(h) states that, quote, \"a test,\nits application, and action upon the results,\" close\nquote, are each violations of Title VII if they are,\nquote, \"used to discriminate,\" close quote.\nSection 703(a)(2) prohibits racially\ndiscriminatory classifications.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So under your\nposition, say the City adopts a discriminatory -- takes\na -- issues a discriminatory test; people take it; they\ncome out with the results; the City says these -- this\nis the test we're going to use, but, you know, we don't\nhave any vacancies. Nobody can sue at that point.\nMR. PAYTON: No, no. Our position is that\nin fact there was an additional violation when the\nclassification occurred when the City announced what it\nintended to do in the future. That's also a violation.\nBut if I can make the contrast,\nMr. Chief Justice, when the City -- suppose they didn't\nannounce anything at all, and what they did was in all\nthose occasions, the 11 I just described -- they used the\nunlawful cutoff score and made hiring decisions.\nTitle VII's disparate impact looks at the\nconsequences of decisions like that. And those\nconsequences, the results of that clearly occur in the\nfuture on those 11 hiring occasions, and then we would\nclearly have a cause of action on each of those 11 times.\nNow, I'll come back and say that Chicago\nannounces, before it does any of that, that it intends to\ndo that in the future. That announcement is an\nindependent violation, but that announcement does not\nchange the impact and the consequences that in fact\nstill would happen in the future when they happen.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: There's an independent\nviolation without an impact? I mean, it's not the\nimpact provision that you quoted which makes that a\nviolation. It must be some other provision that makes\nit a violation. What other provision is it?\nMR. PAYTON: Well, there is an impact. You\nmean when the announcement is made?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Right.\nMR. PAYTON: When the announcement is\nmade -- let me make two points: First of all, I believe\nwe -- you could clearly seek to enjoin Chicago from\ndoing something unlawful in the future --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Sure.\nMR. PAYTON: -- as you clearly have a cause\nof action at the announcement. We know that.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's because of\nan impending violation.\nMR. PAYTON: Because an impending violation --\nJUTICE SCALIA: But you say -- you say it is\nan actual violation.\nMR. PAYTON: Yes. And the question whether\nor not the announcement itself is in violation of the\nstatute, I believe section 703(a)(2) and, actually, all\nthree provisions, make it unlawful to actually have a\nclassification that has the effects I just said, and\nthe effects would simply be in how they were sorting\nthe results.\nSo I think there is an impact. It's not the\nsame impact that ripples through time. And the reason I\nsaid, if they had not made an announcement it's clear\nthere are consequences that happen in the future each of\nthose 11 times, there's an additional violation when\nthey actually use the announcement to say what they\nintend to do. They say what they intend to do, and then\nthey do it. Those are two different violations.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, the language of\nthe statute of 703 is to \"limit, segregate, or\nclassify.\"\nMR. PAYTON: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So is it your position\nthat the violation occurs at the classification that's\nannounced and that every subsequent hiring has limited\nsomeone's opportunity so that they -- there's a\nviolation subsequently under the limit clause as opposed\nto the classification clause, or it's each event is a\nclassification violation?\nMR. PAYTON: It's our position that, in\nfact, all three of the sections I quoted from are\nimplicated in the actions that Chicago took.\nClearly, there's a classification, but when\nthey actually exclude from actual consideration for any\nof the jobs on the 11 occasions, that's a limitation.\nIt's clearly a limitation. When they use the test\nresults, that's an action upon the test results. When\nthey use that to make decisions, that's clearly a\nviolation of (k).\nAll three provisions are in fact implicated,\nsometimes in similar ways, sometimes in different ways.\nAll of them have consequences.\nAnd the way disparate impact law works is,\nyou have an employment practice -- it's always facially\nneutral -- that has an adverse impact on the basis of\nrace that causes there to be a disparate impact and\nconsequences. We look at consequences, and the elements\nof the disparate impact violation are not complete until\nwe have all of those elements.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Your position may -- may follow\nfrom the language of Title VII, but you began by saying\nthat it also represents the best policy. And I wonder\nif you could explain why that is so.\nHere, the City of Chicago continued to use\nthis test for quite a number of years after it was\nadministered. And so as you interpret the statute, I\ngather that someone could still file a disparate impact\nclaim 6 or 7 years after the test was first administered,\nand quite a few years after it was first used in making\na hiring decision. And how can that be squared with\nCongress's evident desire in Title VII to require that an\nEEOC charge be filed rather promptly after the employment\naction is taken?\nMR. PAYTON: I think the answer is that this\nis completely consistent with how the statute works, but\nI'm going to address the policy concern as well. But\nhow the statute works is, there's a violation every\ntime there's a use.\nIf we looked at disparate treatment, there's\na violation every time there's an intention to\ndiscriminate. If there was a future intention to\ndiscriminate, there would be a new violation. So if\nthere is a next use, there's a next violation. And\nthat's how that ought to work.\nBut look at how this worked. Chicago used\nan unlawful cutoff score on those 11 occasions to make\ndecisions. Chicago should have stopped using the\ndiscriminatory cutoff score, and it should have looked at\nall of the qualified applicants that it had judged\nqualified in making its decisions.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If it -- if it stopped using\nit, it might be vulnerable to a Rizzo-type suit from the\npeople who were benefiting.\nMR. PAYTON: I actually think that that\nconflict is not present. Chicago can always make a\ndecision that responds to something that was unlawful.\nAnd I think this Court has always made it clear the\nstandard may be in Ricci, but the law is clearly that if\nChicago has reason to believe -- very good reason to\nbelieve that it is doing something that is unlawful, it\ncan stop doing something unlawful. That's especially\nthe case here.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought in Ricci that\nwas New Haven's position, that they thought that the\ntest was unlawful because of the disparate impact.\nMR. PAYTON: I understand. The standard\nthat may apply to Chicago's decision may be different,\nbut let me give you the example in this case.\nChicago used a cutoff score that the\ndistrict court finds and that their expert who designed\nthe test told them was problematic, to make decisions\nthat has nothing job-related about it at all. It's\narbitrary. The group that are qualified are as\nqualified as the group that are well qualified and\nvice versa. They had available to them the option of\npicking randomly from that group, both groups combined,\nand making the decisions on a random draw. That is, in\nfact, how they made all of the decisions inside of the\ngroups that they used. That's always available.\nChicago could have done that at any time.\nThe policy point here, Justice Alito, is\nthat -- I'd say the animating purpose behind Title VII is,\nas this Court has said, the eradication of\ndiscrimination from our workplace. And you want it to\nbe eradicated. Chicago should not have continued doing\nthis. And the law ought to say, and I think it does\nsay, that when they use something that is unlawful, they\ncan be challenged every time they use something that is\nunlawful. If the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: How long does the City's\nexposure persist? Let's say that the -- in the tenth\nround, someone is selected for the job from the\nqualified group. And then there's a cutback, and there\nare going to be layoffs. So the last hired is the first\nfired. Could -- would there be a Title VII suit when\nthat last hired is laid off, on the ground that if\nChicago had done what it was supposed to do, this person\nwould have had the job long ago and would be higher up\non the seniority list?\nMR. PAYTON: Let me give you two responses\nto that.\nThe first answer is that the statute of\nlimitations is 300 days after every use, and it's no\nlonger. So for whatever it is, if you violate\nTitle VII, the statute of limitations is 300 days. If\nthere is a use that goes into the future, it's 300 days\nafter the last use. Right now, Chicago has stopped\nusing that. The doors are closed. No one else can\nchallenge this.\nTo your specific question about how would it\nwork if there was a layoff arrangement, the proposed --\nthe remedy order in this case -- it's not in effect\nbecause we are where we are -- but the remedy order in\nthis case includes shutting down the use of this, but it\nalso has provisions for seniority to in fact address, I\nbelieve, exactly the circumstances you just described,\nJustice Ginsburg. So I believe that is contemplated and\nhandled in the remedial order.\nThe issue about the policy here, though, is\nthat if you don't say that a use, in fact, can be\nchallenged, a use of something unlawful can be\nchallenged, what you could end up with here is that\nChicago would then take the message that it's okay once\nthey are past the first 300 days, and they could just go\non using the discriminatory cutoff score over and over\nand over again, and that is inconsistent with the\noverall policy of what Title VII is trying to root out\nof our economy and in our workplace.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Payton, can I ask this\ngeneral question? Am I correct that each firefighter in\nthe qualified group who did not make the well-qualified\nhas a cause of action as though he had been refused\nemployment when anyone else is hired? There were 11\npeople hired, as I understand. Did each one of those\nhirings give everybody else in the class a cause of\naction?\nMR. PAYTON: The group of the black\nqualified applicants that are in the qualified category,\nbut the qualified category is qualified as the other\ncategory -- every time the city made decisions about\nfilling jobs in the fire department, it excluded every\nsingle one of those applicants, even though they were\nqualified. So every single one was excluded.\nSo they all have a cause of action because\nthey were excluded and that clearly fits very easily\nwithin how --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: But surely they couldn't\nall recover, because there was only one job available.\nMR. PAYTON: No. That's correct. That's about\nwhat the remedy would be. So the remedy and -- you know,\nobviously wouldn't be to give all of them jobs. That's\nnot the remedy, and that wasn't the remedy that's\nsought -- was sought here. But they were all excluded\nfrom consideration, and that's a violation of Title VII's\ndisparate impact prohibition. So they all have a cause\nof action.\nThe way the remedy would work --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: What is -- what is the\nremedy other than saying change your practice? What is\n-- say one person sues and asks for damages, what\nwould the remedy be for a single applicant who was not\nhired at the time somebody else was hired?\nMR. PAYTON: It may be very little. So if\nit's a single applicant who sues and not a class -- this\nis a class. So if a single applicant sues, the remedy\nwould be to stop using the unlawful cutoff score, okay,\nand then to figure out what would have happened if that\nunlawful cutoff score hadn't have occurred, and that\nwould have created a very miniscule chance of ever\nbecoming a firefighter and perhaps turning that into\nsome sort of damage award, but it would be miniscule.\nIn the actual event, the award includes some\nactual jobs being allocated to the 6,000 members of the\nclass -- it was 132 -- to be decided upon in some random\nway that they would be hired. But that's how it would\nwork. But they are all clearly injured when they are\nall excluded from consideration in all 11 rounds, in\nviolation of Title VII.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that -- each --\neach qualified firefighter who did not get a job because\nthe well-qualified one did has a new cause of action, I\nguess, every time somebody is hired from the -- the\nwell-qualified pool?\nMR. PAYTON: Every time --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In other words,\nsomebody is hired, that constitutes discrimination\nagainst the qualified black firefighter who was not\nhired, and then another -- then somebody else is\nhired -- each time it's a new cause of action?\nMR. PAYTON: They had 11 rounds of hiring --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.\nMR. PAYTON: -- that are relevant to this case.\nThere are other rounds afterwards. They exhaust the first\ncategory. But in the 11 rounds of hiring, when in every one\nof those rounds the unlawful cutoff score is used, that is\naction upon the results. That is a limitation. You know,\nthat is the use of something that causes an adverse impact\non the basis of race -- and, yes --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, so they would\nhave a new cause of action, sure.\nMR. PAYTON: That's a cause of action.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now, but they -- but\nif 300 days go from the first round of hiring, they\ndon't -- they cannot sort of piggyback that onto a later\ncause of action.\nMR. PAYTON: Yes, if they sue -- in this\ncase, the EEOC charge was filed after the second round\nof hiring, and in this case then, therefore, no remedy\ncan take account of the first round of hiring. If they\nhad sued only on the seventh round of hiring, no remedy\ncould take account of those forgone opportunities. So,\nthat would also play out in how the remedial order would\nwork.\nAnd I think I want to reserve the rest of my\ntime.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Katyal.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS\nMR. KATYAL: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nAs the questions I think reveal, I think the\nbottom line question in this case is whether or not\nunder the text of Title VII there was a present\nviolation in each of the 11 rounds of hiring when the\nCity of Chicago relied on its concededly discriminatory\ntest to exclude the plaintiffs from consideration. And\nwe think that Title VII has three mutually reinforcing\nprovisions in it, each of which point to the same\nconclusion.\nA violation of Title VII occurred in this\ncase when Chicago, in each of those 11 rounds, used its\nhiring practice with -- and caused a disparate impact,\nthereby limiting the employment opportunities of certain\napplicants. Chicago gave an ability test and relied on\nthat ability test in a way that Title VII forbids. It\ntook action upon the results of that discriminatory test\nin a way that arbitrarily excluded qualified applicants\nfrom being hired.\nJustice Alito, I think -- in response to your\nquestion, I think our position follows entirely from the\ntext of the statute. We're not as concerned about the\npolicy consequences, though we do think that if the\nCourt were concerned about the policy consequences, we\nthink that there's a good reason why Congress\ndistinguished between disparate treatment and disparate\nimpact litigation. But it's the language of Title VII\nitself, and in particular 703(h), which forbids action\nupon the results.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Why would Congress have\nwanted to allow a question like this to be left open for\nsuch an extended period of time? Why would it not have\nwanted everybody who is potentially affected by it to\nunderstand where things stand at a much earlier point,\nat some reasonable period of time after all of the\ninformation is in the -- in the possession of a\npotential plaintiff to determine whether there has been\na disparate impact and whether that -- that person is\ngoing to be adversely affected by it, particularly if at\na later point the effect of a remedial decree can be to\nupset the employment -- the employment status of other\npeople who have been hired in the interim?\nMR. KATYAL: I agree that there -- there\nmight be policy arguments against it as well as for it,\nbut here's the way I think we look at it -- and the\nUnited States is the nation's largest employer, and we\nface similar concerns. We give certain tests.\nBut I think what might have been -- what was\nprobably animating Congress was a fear that if the\nrule of the City of Chicago were adopted, then an\nemployer who made it 300 days without an EEOC charge\nbeing filed, 300 days after the announcement of the test\nresults, would then be able to for all time use that\ndiscriminatory test, and it would lock in that period,\nthat test, for as long as 10, 20 years, and Congress\ncould have legitimately worried about if a test made it\n300 days, an employer essentially had a get-out-of-jail-\nfree card to use for all time. And I would say that\nthat precise thing appears to have happened in this very\ncase.\nAt Joint Appendix page 54, when the City\nannounced its test results in January of 1996,\nit said it intended to use this test for only 3\nyears through 1999. Afterwards, 1999 came, the City, in\nthe City's own briefs -- this is the court of appeals\nbrief at page 12 -- they admit they made a new decision\nto continue using this test and the test results for\nsubsequent hiring rounds. That was a new decision, and\nindeed that's a decision, I think, many employers would\nlogically make after 3 years, because then they\ndon't have to worry about the possibility of a disparate\nimpact lawsuit.\nAnd since, as this Court said in Ricci, one\nof the goals of Title VII is really to encourage\nvoluntary compliance on the part of employers, adopting\na rule like the City of Chicago's is really antithetical\nto that, because then it will essentially lock in for\nall time that old discriminatory test.\nI think another reason policy -- another\npolicy reason Congress may have thought about is that a\nrule that forced people to file within 300 days might be\ndamaging to the EEOC and divisive to employers, because\nit would say you only have that 300-day period to file,\neven before all the consequences of the -- of the -- of\nthe employment decision are fully understood.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, actually in -- in\nthis case, am I correct that -- that 9 years has gone by,\nbut that's because of the litigation? The suit was filed,\nwhat, 4 months after the 300-day period ran?\nMR. KATYAL: The first charge was filed, I\nbelieve, 420 days after the January 26th announcement of\nthe test results. And, yes, Justice Kennedy, then there\nwas a period of discovery and litigation over business\nnecessity and the like.\nAnd in this case, the City admitted in other\nlitigation that there was no basis for giving this 89\ncutoff score, that a person who scored 65 was just as\nlikely to succeed as a firefighter as a person who\nwas -- who had scored 89.\nJustice Stevens, you had asked about the\nremedy in the case, and here's how we understand the way\nremedies work in disparate impact litigation: It's\nlargely injunctive in nature. It's mostly about\npreventing future problems.\nThere is a back pay claim that is available\nthat is statutorily capped at 2 years. Not everyone in\nthis 6,000-person class could get that full amount of\nback pay obviously. Instead, what happened here, there\nwas a remedial phase at trial, and what they did was they\ndecided that -- the experts on both sides admitted that\n132 people, approximately, would have been hired out of\nthat class, and that provided the appropriate amount of\nback pay.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you get --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Was it -- was it 132 named\npeople or was it just 132 undifferentiated?\nMR. KATYAL: I think it was 132\nundifferentiated people, and then I think there --\nand Mr. Payton can, I think, fully explain how the\nrandomization of awards was allocated.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So everybody gets\n132 over 6,000 times whatever the number of people who\nwould have been hired?\nMR. KATYAL: Right. And --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean the pay for\nthe number of people.\nMR. KATYAL: Right. And, Mr. Chief Justice,\nto respond to your concern before, that amount of money\nis not -- you couldn't go back and look to earlier\nperiods of time outside of the statute of limitations,\noutside of the 300-day period, rather only any\nsubsequent use. For example, in this case the remedy\ncouldn't look to the first round of hiring because no\nlawsuit was brought within that first round of hiring.\nIt was brought at the -- it was brought after the second\nround of hiring.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I think you had a\nfootnote in your reply brief that said that if your\nposition prevails there would need to be an adjustment\nin the relief granted by the district court --\nMR. KATYAL: That is --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- wasn't it?\nMR. KAYTAL: That is correct. And I think\nthat the Petitioners agree with that as well. And\nthat's I think a further limit on the way in which this\npresent violation theory operates as a matter of\npractice. Now, this Court has said in cases such as\nLedbetter that -- that there must be a present\nviolation, and disparate impact litigation looks quite\ndifferent than disparate treatment litigation in\npractice, because disparate impact litigation doesn't\nneed that missing element that has been at issue in\nLedbetter and Evans and Ricks, of discriminatory intent\nat that subsequent time of action.\nHere, in a disparate impact case, all that\nneed be shown by the plaintiff is adverse impact, and\nthat adverse impact happens in each of those 11 rounds\nof hiring. Each of the time -- each time the City used\nits test results and drew a line and said, you under 89,\nwe are not looking at you, that was action upon the\nresults, to use the language of (h)(2).\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And that would be clear\neven though it had not been established much earlier\nthat the test was invalid. So a city could go along\nusing a test that was an invalid test, not declared\nsuch; 10 years later, somebody comes up and says: This\ntest that is being applied to me is an invalid test.\nMR. KATYAL: That's exactly correct, Justice\nScalia.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What -- of what use is a\nstatute of limitations that -- that -- that operates\nthat way?\nMR. KATYAL: Let me say two things: First\nis I think (h)(2) refers to \"action upon the results,\"\nand that thing happened in 10 years is itself action\nupon the results, and so I think as a statutory matter\nthe language decides it.\nNow, with respect to the policy reason, I\nthink the reason is that otherwise Congress had to fear\nprecisely what you're saying, that an employer 10\nyears from now would use that discriminatory test,\nbecause they knew they had made it past the 300-day\ninitial phase of time, and then could use it for all\ntime. And so the statute of limitations and the\nconcerns about repose work hand in hand with other\nconcerns of Title VII, and in particular incentivizing\nemployers to ensure voluntary compliance with the law of\nTitle VII, and which this Court said in Griggs, the goal\nof which is to eradicate discrimination from the United\nStates' labor markets.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So I suppose the\nbenefit is not that the City knows it's safe -- it can\nrely on a test and all that -- but knows that it only has\nto pay 300 days back.\nMR. KATYAL: That is -- that is -- that is\nthe benefit of that particular back pay limitation, yes.\nBut in a case like this, where the City knows very well,\nthis test is discriminatory and, indeed, has said so in\nlitigation, I think Congress wanted to incentivize and\nmake sure there was an ability for people to sue at each\ntime that discriminatory test was used.\nIf there are no further questions.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMs. Solomon.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF BENNA RUTH SOLOMON\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT\nMS. SOLOMON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nIn January 1996, the City adopted and\nannounced an eligibility list for hiring candidates who\nsat for the firefighters' examination. Petitioners were\ntold that a priority pool had been created, that based\non their scores they were not classified in that pool,\nand that further consideration of candidates would be\nlimited to those who were in the priority pool, at least\nuntil everyone in that pool had been called for\nprocessing.\nThe City also publicly admitted that this\ntiered eligibility list had adverse impact on\nAfrican-Americans, and Petitioners were aware of this.\nBut Petitioners did not file charges challenging the\nexam and the cutoff score within 300 days after the\ntiered eligibility list was adopted and announced.\nNow they contend that charges can be filed\nto challenge the same exam and the same cutoff score\nevery time the City hired from the priority hiring pool.\nThat position cannot be squared with the statute.\nCalling other applicants from a hiring pool from which\nPetitioners had already been excluded did not limit or\nclassify Petitioners in any way.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose there were no\nlist, but each time there was a hiring round the City\njust took from the top -- from the top score down.\nThere's no list, but each time the City uses the test\nresults and hires the people with the top scores.\nMS. SOLOMON: If I understand correctly,\nthat would be the same case as this, for this reason:\nA list is used in a couple of different ways. A list\nmight be used to describe the strict rank ordering that\nYour Honor is describing, and in that case, once there\nis that kind of a list, it's the same as this case.\nWhat happened in this case after that kind\nof a list was made, we also drew another line, which was\nthe priority hiring pool.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: No, my -- my hypothetical\nwas there's no list at all.\nMS. SOLOMON: If --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: They just go back to the\nraw scores, and each time they picked the top people.\nMS. SOLOMON: So that actually -- if we're\ngoing back to the scores but no announcement has been\nmade ever that we are going to use the scores in a\ncertain way, we agree that every time the city actually\nconsulted the scores, there would be a new claim. But\nthat's because --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what is -- what is\nthe list, other than an administratively convenient way\nto use the scores?\nMS. SOLOMON: The list was the device that\nlimited and classified Petitioners in this case, and\nthat's why it's so important. Because in order to have\na present cause of action, section (a)(2) -- under\nsection (a)(2), which is the disparate impact provision,\nPetitioners have to point to something in the charging\nperiod that actually limited and classified them. And\nthat was the effect of the list, and including the\npriority hiring pool.\nIn a case where there is no general\npractice, no announcement, no decision, nothing, but\nrather every time the City makes hiring, the City\nundertakes a new decision with new criteria, then it is\nmaking a decision at that point; it is engaging in a\npractice that is then at that time limiting and\nclassifying the Petitioners. What happened --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So even though there is a\nclear case on the merits of disparate impact, unless the\nsuit is commenced within 30 days of the announcement,\nthen it's as though it were lawful. That's your\nposition.\nMS. SOLOMON: The statute, (a)(2), requires\nan unlawful --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that -- is that --\nthere's a free pass. You don't sue within 30 days of the\ncompilation of the list and the notice of the list; you sue\n420 days later. The discriminatory practice gets frozen,\nthe status quo gets frozen forever. That's -- that is\nyour position, is it not?\nMS. SOLOMON: That is the function of the\noperation of the statute of limitations, and of course\nit's not unique to Title VII.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But this is not exactly a\ntitle -- a statute of limitations. It's a time you have\nto file your charge. It's a charge filing.\nMS. SOLOMON: Correct. And --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: There's also a 2-year\nstatute of limitations in Title VII. You can't get back\npay, I think, for more than 2 years.\nMS. SOLOMON: The 300-day charging period\nunder Title VII functions like a statute of limitations,\nand when a timely charge is not filed, no recovery can\nbe had for that claim. And the Court has said that over\nand over in a series of disparate treatment cases.\nNow, the defining feature --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You -- you don't have one\ncase, I think, certainly not from this Court, of\ndisparate impact. All the cases that you cite are\ndisparate treatment cases.\nMS. SOLOMON: The cases are disparate\ntreatment cases, Justice Ginsburg, but the rule should\nbe the same in this case for several reasons: First,\nthose cases reflect that the reason there is not\na present violation when the consequences of a prior\ndiscriminatory act are felt is because the defining\nfeature of the claim is absent within the charging\nperiod.\nNow, that is a perfectly good rule, no matter\nwhether it's discriminatory treatment or discriminatory\nimpact. And in this case, the defining feature, namely\ndisparate impact in the sense defined by the statute,\nrequired by the statute, to limit or classify in a way\nthat denies people employment opportunities based on\nrace -- that defining feature was absent within the\ncharging period.\nJUSTICE BREYER: How is it absent? Because\nthe statute says that the established -- the -- it's\nestablished -- namely, the unlawful employment practice\n-- it's established only if, and certainly if, the\nrespondent uses --\nMS. SOLOMON: Right.\nJUSTICE BREYER: -- a particular employment\npractice that has a disparate impact. That refers back\nto (a)(2).\nSo back in that period, on a certain date, he\nused that limiting practice, and, therefore, on that\nparticular date, he established the unlawful employment\npractice by using a test that limited, et cetera.\nMS. SOLOMON: I -- I have two responses,\nJustice Breyer, and the first is that section (k), which\nis what Your Honor is quoting from, does not describe\naccrual, and it does not define the underlying violation.\nIt talks about when an -- excuse me, when a violation is\nestablished. And what's so interesting is that the\nreliance on those words \"uses an employment practice\" --\nit's a few words plucked out of the middle of section (k).\nYou actually can't apply section (k)\nliterally to this case and have anything that approaches\nanything that makes sense. And that's because section\n(k) actually goes on after those words that get\nhighlighted over and over, and it's -- and it refers to\nthe rest of what happens in a case when a claim of\ndisparate impact is tried.\nAnd so if you --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why don't we look at\nsubsection (h) --\nMS. SOLOMON: Subsection --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- that says -- and it's\nan -- \"it shall be an unlawful employment practice for\nan employer to give and\" -- conjunctive -- \"and act\nupon the results.\"\nMS. SOLOMON: Correct.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So when you hire, aren't\nyou acting upon the results? And how are you acting\nupon -- you may be acting upon it, as Petitioner argues,\nwhen you classify, but why aren't you acting upon when\nyou hire?\nMS. SOLOMON: Because there is no act that\nlimits and classifies. And what's interesting about\nsection (h), it's not --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- I go back to\nJustice Breyer's point. Isn't it, in the very act of\nhiring, you are using the test results and saying --\neach time you do it, you're saying: I'm going to cut\noff at this limit, and I'm not going to consider someone\noutside of this limited tier.\nMS. SOLOMON: Well, that's what is actually\nmissing in this case. The city did not go back to the\ntest results, and it did not -- it did not create --\nengage in a new decision or a new practice.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But isn't that what\n\"practice and policy\" means? Meaning that each time, as\nyou continue forward, you are using a particular\npractice, a particular policy?\nMS. SOLOMON: Petitioners continued to be\nineligible for as long as the list was used in the way\nthat we said at the outset it was going to be used;\nnamely, that the well-qualified pool, the priority\nhiring pool, would be called first.\nThe reason they continued to be ineligible\nis because they had been limited and classified as\nineligible until the priority pool was hired first.\nThat was the only practice that had adverse impact\nwithin -- as required by the statute, meaning limit and\nclassify.\nNow, to complete my answer to\nJustice Breyer --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question,\nMs. Solomon? Would your argument be the same if the\npractice in this case were -- required a high school\ndiploma?\nDid you understand my question?\nMS. SOLOMON: I'm sorry. I didn't realize\nyou had finished. Excuse me.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Suppose the practice were\na high school diploma. Could that -- would you make\nthe same argument as you're making today?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And let's add to that,\nthat it was adopted 10 years ago --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: That's right.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- and Duke Power\nannounced to the world that it was going to use a high\nschool diploma. Indeed, it listed in the county all of\nthe high school graduates and said: This is the list.\nMS. SOLOMON: A case like that might present\ndifferent accrual problems for this reason: There might\nbe several appropriate times when a person affected by a\npolicy like that could be said actually to have been\nlimited and classified in their employment\nopportunities. And it could be when they enter grade\nschool, but that is not an appropriate time, so if it's\n10 years before the act -- so that person is -- is\nroughly 8 years old.\nIt could be when they apply to the employer.\nIt could be a variety of other times. But those cases,\nwhatever difficult accrual problems and questions they\npresent, they are not presented here, because this was a\nclosed universe. Everybody affected by the City's\neligibility list and the test and the cutoff score knew\nfrom the moment --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: No, but -- but in my\nexample, everybody who is not a high school graduate\nwould have been affected right away.\nMS. SOLOMON: But if they are not interested\nin employment with that employer, then they are not --\nit -- you -- they are certainly affected in one sense of\nthe word, but they're perhaps -- it would not be possible\nto say their employment opportunities had been affected.\nWe certainly agree that there should be one\ntime to challenge every employment practice that has an\nunlawful disparate impact, but the question in this case\nis whether there is more than one to challenge exactly\nthe same thing? Petitioners --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You force people to\nchallenge the practice when they don't even know if it's\ngoing to affect them. In the hypothetical that has been\ndiscussed, somebody who didn't graduate from high\nschool, you know, wants to be something other than a\nfirefighter. But that doesn't work out, and then he says,\nwell, now I want to be a firefighter. And they say,\nwell, you can't, because you didn't graduate from high\nschool.\nMS. SOLOMON: Right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And I think your\nposition is that, well, he should have filed that\nsuit earlier, no?\nMS. SOLOMON: Our position is that the\ncharging period runs from the unlawful practice. And\nthe Court has stressed it is important to confirm --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but what is\nthe unlawful practice?\nMS. SOLOMON: The unlawful practice here was\nlimiting and classifying Petitioners in a way that\ndeprived them of their employment opportunities. This\nis what -- this -- what they were told --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Can we put that in\nconcrete terms? It was the 89 percent cutoff, so that\nanybody who got below 89 percent on the test was never\ngoing to be considered until all the first people who\ngot 89 to 98.\nMS. SOLOMON: Correct. And after that\ndecision was made, there was nothing else that Chicago\ndid that affected Petitioners in the terms required by\nthe statute. Hiring others did not adversely affect\nPetitioners because they were --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So could you answer\nJustice Stevens's hypothetical? What is the difference\nbetween those people and each person who does not have a\nhigh school diploma is not -- and is not hired? Does\nthat mean that the moment that they announce the high\nschool diploma requirement, that everybody who had\nalready received one, whether they wanted to work at\nthis job or not, had to sue, and it's only those people\nwho just received the high school diploma who can sue\n10 years later?\nMS. SOLOMON: The statute requires that the --\nthe complainant be limited and classified in their\nemployment opportunity. So --\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what is the\ndifference between the policy announcement that each\ntime I hire, I'm not going to use a high school -- I'm\nnot going to look at people who don't have a high school\ndiploma, and I'm not going to look at people who don't\nhave a test score above 89. What's the difference\nbetween those?\nMS. SOLOMON: The difference is that once\nPetitioners here were classified out of the eligible\npool for priority hiring, they were out. They were\nsimply out. They were not being considered anymore at\nall. We didn't go back to look at the test. We didn't\nconsider Petitioners. We didn't reject them each time.\nThere could be --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, somebody getting --\nsomeone getting a letter that you sent to people who\nwere qualified didn't know that. The only thing that\nI see that you sent to the people who fell into the\nqualified category was that it was unlikely, which I take\nit means less than 50 percent, that they would be called\nfor further processing, but it was possible that they\nwould be called for further processing. You didn't tell\nthem anything about -- you didn't tell them that you were\ngoing to fill all of your available positions with\npeople who were classified as well qualified in that\nletter --\nMS. SOLOMON: With respect --\nJUSTICE ALITO: -- did you?\nMS. SOLOMON: With respect, Justice Alito,\nthe letter does say that because of the large number of\npeople who were classified well-qualified, a step ahead\nof where Petitioners were classified, it was not likely\nthat they were going to be hired.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Right. That's right.\nMS. SOLOMON: And for that reason, that is\nwhen the injury and the impact was felt. Whatever else\nlater happened, whether Chicago hired a lot of people,\nChicago hired no one, whether Chicago even hired some of\nthe Petitioners, they had years' worth of delay. And at\nthis point in the litigation, it is undisputed. The City\nmade 149 hires from the first use of the list. That's\nmore than any other class --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just to follow up on\nJustice Alito's question, what if it were different?\nWhat if the letter said, look, you didn't get, you're\nnot well qualified, but we really do expect to hire a lot\nmore, so, you know, keep your fingers crossed. There's\na good chance that you are going to be hired.\nAnd you say those people should have sued\nright then?\nMS. SOLOMON: Correct. Because the impact,\nat a minimum, is the delay in hiring. And the Court has\nmade quite clear that you don't -- a complainant or\nplaintiff does not have to feel all of the consequences\nright at the outset to --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's kind of\na bad policy, isn't it? You're telling people who may\nprobably not be injured at all -- you are saying, well,\nyou still have to go into Federal court and sue.\nMS. SOLOMON: With respect, Chief Justice\nRoberts, they are injured. Their hiring will be\ndelayed, possibly substantially.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, sure. No, I\nunderstand that, but, you know, let's say we\nthink we are going to hire -- if the budget plan goes\nthrough, we think we're going to hire everybody else\nby -- in 4 months. And you're saying, well, those\npeople have to sue anyway because they are injured by\nthe 4-month delay.\nMS. SOLOMON: They are injured by a\n4-month delay.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.\nMS. SOLOMON: But there may be circumstances\nin which information is not conveyed in a way that would\nput a reasonable person on notice that he or she had a\nclaim right at the outset, and that relates also to the\nhigh school diploma hypothetical. If the --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, why did the City\nsay that it was planning to give a new test in 3\nyears and then wait more than a decade before giving a\nnew test? If I received one of these qualified letters,\nand I also -- and I knew in addition that the City was\ngoing to give a test in 3 years, that might well\naffect my incentive about bringing a lawsuit to\nchallenge this.\nMS. SOLOMON: But it wouldn't change the\nfact that there had been, at least a -- if you wait for\nthe next list, you still have been delayed at least 3\nyears in your ability to be hired as a firefighter. And\nas far as the reason why we didn't follow through on the\naspirational goal of giving another test within 3 years,\nthe tests are very difficult and expensive to deliver,\nI think -- to develop, excuse me. The record in\nthis case actually makes that clear.\nDespite rather significant steps, including\nthe use of a prominent African-American industrial\npsychologist to develop this test, it had severe adverse\nimpact. The test actually compares rather favorably to\nthe test that was given in the City of New Haven, but\nthe district court invalidated it, and, you know, we did\nundertake to develop a new test. But --\nJUSTICE ALITO: But you don't challenge\nthat.\nMS. SOLOMON: -- surely the Court --\nJUSTICE ALITO: You don't challenge that.\nYou now acknowledge that the Plaintiffs were treated\nunlawfully.\nMS. SOLOMON: We have not pressed that\nclaim. That is correct, Justice Alito, but --\nJUSTICE ALITO: And were you prejudiced by\nthe delay in the filing of the EEOC charge?\nMS. SOLOMON: There was some testimony -- and\nwe quote it in our brief -- about things that the person\nresponsible for setting the cutoff score could not\nremember. But a statute of limitations actually doesn't\nrequire prejudice, so we didn't undertake to try to\nprove that. The -- repose arises naturally at the end\nof the charging period. It's not something that -- that\nthe defendant has to earn either by capitulating to the\nplaintiffs' demands or otherwise proving prejudice.\nAnd in a case like this, it -- it wasn't\npossible simply to take the list down. The Court's\nopinion in Ricci makes that quite clear. Our expert\ntold us all the way through the trial -- he testified\nat the trial --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You didn't have to take\nthe list down. You simply could have said: Anyone who\ngot a passing score, anyone who is qualified -- we're not\ngoing to make the distinction between qualified and\nunqualified.\nMS. SOLOMON: I -- I believe --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You didn't have to throw\nout the list.\nMS. SOLOMON: I believe --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: You didn't have to throw\nout the test.\nMS. SOLOMON: I believe the Court's opinion\nin Ricci addresses that as well. That that's a -- a\nmisuse of the test scores. The expert was resolute even\nthrough the trial --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the expert\nsaid -- the test devisor said he didn't make up that\n89 percent cutoff. That was Chicago that made that --\nthat decision.\nMS. SOLOMON: He -- his reason for\nsuggesting the 65 cutoff score was because of the\nadverse impact. That was an attempt to deal with\nadverse impact, but his position was the test was valid\nto measure the cognitive aspects that it was attempting\nto measure, and that those related to the training\nfirefighters had to undergo in the academy.\nAnd he was clear as well, that a higher\nscore created an inference that the person was more\nqualified to -- to perform in the way --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you -- you've lost --\nyou've lost on that.\nMS. SOLOMON: We have. But the reason that\nI'm mentioning it is because it's not simply a matter\nof -- of why don't you take the list down. At the time\nthat the expert is telling us the test is valid and it\ncan -- it gives rise to an inference that people closer\nto the top are better -- possess more of the cognitive\nabilities that the test was testing for, we would have\nat a minimum been courting disparate treatment liability\nto adjust the scores, to randomize them further, or to\ntake the list down. But to return --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: No, but -- but going to\n65, opening up the classification, is not adjusting the\nscores; it's not taking the list down; it's just saying\nanyone who passes the test can proceed to the next step.\nMS. SOLOMON: It seriously diminished the\nopportunities of the people who were at 89 and above.\nThere were about 1,700 applicants at 89 or above, and\nthere were 22,000 65 or above. So calling in random\norder --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You've got to -- I\nmean, you've just got to take your -- get as good\nlegal advice as you can and determine is it -- are we\ngoing to be in more trouble if we follow the test or\nmore trouble if we -- if we take it down?\nPeople have to do that all the time. They\nlook -- well, if I do this, I'm going to be in trouble;\nif I do this, I'm going to -- but I have got to decide\nwhat I should do.\nMS. SOLOMON: Correct, but read in\nconjunction with the 300-day charging period. And I\nwould like to follow up just briefly on answers to\nJustice Breyer and Justice Sotomayor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I'm sorry.\nRead in conjunction with the 300 -- you have got to\nfinish that sentence at least, before --\nMS. SOLOMON: I -- I'm sorry. That\nwas the -- so, yes, at the point where the employer is\nassessing the options, the City was not sued within --\nexcuse me, charges were not filed within 300 days after\nthe tiered eligibility list was adopted and announced.\nPetitioners were aware that it had adverse impact. No\ncharges were filed then; no charges were filed after the\nfirst use of the list.\nSo at some point when the employer is\nweighing the options, the employer can also factor in\nthe time to challenge this has passed.\nWhat Petitioners seek here is new\nopportunities -- 11 -- 10 opportunities to challenge\nexactly the same thing that they -- that they would have\nchallenged if they had filed a charge promptly. They\ncontinue to emphasize that the eligibility pool, when\ncompared with the pool of applicants, had a disparate\nimpact. But that's not a new violation. That's not a\nnew classification, and it doesn't limit anybody's\nopportunities in any way beyond what they were already\nlimited. That's the old violation. That's the one they\ndidn't charge.\nNow, Petitioners do claim that the shortfall\nevidence showed that they -- showed and the use of the\nlist had disparate impact each time. But it actually\ndidn't, either. That also was the old violation. That\nshortfall was compiled by comparing the number of\nAfrican-Americans who were hired using the 89 cutoff\nscore and the number who would have been called for\nfurther processing if --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: How do you -- the problem I\nhave with all of this -- it makes entire sense, except\nwhen you read subpart (k), it says \"an unlawful\nemployment practice based on disparate impact is\nestablished\" if \"a complaining party demonstrates that a\nrespondent uses a particular employment practice that\ncauses a disparate impact on the basis of race.\"\nMS. SOLOMON: Correct. But you have --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Which is what happened\nhere.\nMS. SOLOMON: But the fact --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: They used --\nMS. SOLOMON: Excuse me, Justice Scalia.\nThe statute goes on, and it describes the later things\nthat happened at trial. So in our view, read\nliterally --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Where -- where does it go\non? To say what?\nMS. SOLOMON: It goes on to say that the\nrespondent fails to demonstrate that the challenged\nprocess is job-related, or subpart (ii), there is\nan alternative practice with less disparate impact. So\n-- so (k), if (k) is going to be consulted at all, and\nwe do not think that it should be, because section\n706(e), which has always been thought of as the charging\nperiod, talks about an alleged unlawful practice, and\nthat's what the person knows at the outset.\nSection (k) talks about the burden of proof\nand how you go about proving these at trial, and that's\nwhy it uses the word \"established.\" But that's also why\nit describes the entirety of what happens at trial.\nRead literally, you can pluck a few words out of the --\nout of one of these provisions and say, aha, they used\nan employment practice. You have to read the whole\nthing together if you're going to read it at all, and\nwhen you read the whole thing together, you come up with\nthe absurd result that the charging period doesn't run\nuntil the district court brings the gavel down and\ndetermines that an unlawful practice has been\nestablished.\nIn this case, that would have meant that the\npeople 65 and below could file charges within 300 days\nafter the district court's decision, which is something\nlike 11 years after the practice in this case. And\nthat's because that was the moment at which it was\nestablished. And that's why we think that (k) does not\nbear on this. And (h) --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Is my impression -- is\nthere anything else in that (k)? You see, it lists\nabout 10 things, let's say 10 -- imagine. One of\nthose things is that it was used. Now, all the other\nthings there will not have been -- are things that --\nthat -- to do with the test, basically. So you have\nlike six or seven that have to do with the test and the\ncriteria, and then you have one that it was used.\nMS. SOLOMON: Right, and that's why --\nJUSTICE BREYER: And -- and so I thought,\nlooking at the list, it's quite right that it's used for\na different purpose but --\nMS. SOLOMON: It's not --\nJUSTICE BREYER: But, I mean, this (k) has\nto do with a different thing, but -- but -- and the\ncritical element of it was that the practice be used.\nMS. SOLOMON: You -- but again, even if (k)\nis consulted -- and for the reasons that I just outlined\nwe don't think that it should be. It doesn't bear on\naccrual. But even if (k) is consulted, it doesn't --\nit doesn't say that any use of an employment practice is\n-- is a new unlawful act. It has to be an employment\npractice that actually has disparate impact.\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well, you'd have to then\nsay that all the things that are there, the other nine\nand so forth -- all those nine things --\nMS. SOLOMON: This is actually --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Well --\nMS. SOLOMON: Excuse me, Justice Breyer.\nThis is actually a slightly different point. At the\noutset, I indicated why section (k) does not bear on\naccrual at all; it describes what happens at trial, and\nfor that reason --\nJUSTICE BREYER: Yes.\nMS. SOLOMON: -- you really can't pluck a few\nwords out of the middle.\nJUSTICE BREYER: No, well, that's true --\nit does --\nMS. SOLOMON: But even if one is going to\nconsult it to determine accrual, what it says is that\nthe use of an employment practice with adverse impact.\nAnd in this case there was only one, and that one was\nwhen Petitioners were limited and classified based on\nthe test scores. Nothing that happened after that,\nincluding hiring others, was an unlawful practice with\ndisparate impact in a way that affected the Petitioners.\nThey had already been rejected.\nWhen an employer says, I will not consider\nyou for the position, or perhaps it says, I will not\nconsider you for the position until I have considered a\nlot of other people first, that is a rejection. Nothing\nthat happens after that, whether the person hires\nsomebody else, whether the person doesn't hire somebody\nelse, whether they change their mind and later hire the\nperson whom they had previously rejected -- Ricks, after\nall had a grievance pending. It was certainly possible\nthat that would change the outcome in the case, but the\nCourt, nonetheless, says you cannot wait for the\nconsequences to be felt.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That was a disparate\ntreatment case.\nMS. SOLOMON: Correct, but there is no --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And the -- the argument\nhere is disparate impact is different because there's\nno need to show intent of disparate impact.\nMS. SOLOMON: Correct. But the only\npractice in this case that had a disparate impact in the\nsense used by the statute was when the tiered\neligibility list was made. After that, of course there\nwas a consequence of that. Consequences can be felt in\nemployment for a long time. The people in the\nwell-qualified pool were hired before Petitioners, they\nwere paid before Petitioners, they are going to get\ntheir pensions before Petitioners. Those things\ncontinue to have consequences.\nBut the Court has made clear that the\nconsequences cannot be challenged by themselves unless\nthere actually is a present violation.\nNow, there is not even an argument in the\nother side's briefs, neither of them, that explains why\nthere was an adverse impact based on race under (a)(2)\nat any point when the City used the list. If one reads\nthe briefs very carefully, one will see that those times\nwhen a claim is made in the briefs that we used an\nunlawful practice, it always goes back to the test and\nthe list.\nSimply keeping the list up after we announce\nit is not a new violation. It is quite clear in the\ncases that the employer does not have to change a\ndecision in order to obtain repose.\nAnd, of course, the disparate treatment and\ndisparate impact are simply different methods of proving\na claim. They are not different claims by themselves.\nIn this case, in addition to the statutory language,\nthere are a number of policy reasons that while we don't\nrely on them heavily, we do rely on the statute. They\nshould nonetheless be considered in deciding this.\nThere was no sense in which a claim filed to challenge\nthe list was premature. It was the one act that\nactually limited and classified Petitioners.\nEverything else that happened after that\neither didn't affect the Petitioners at all, as in\nhiring people who had made the cut, or it affected them\nonly in the colloquial sense, that the consequences of\nthe prior act continued.\nChicago did not have to revisit this in\norder to obtain repose. The statute makes that quite\nclear.\nMr. Payton emphasizes only the policy of\nrighting employment wrongs, but there are other policies\nin the statute. In addition to repose, the statute\nmakes clear that claims should be brought to the EEOC at\nthe earliest opportunity.\nExcuse me. We ask that the judgment be\naffirmed.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\nMr. Payton, you have 5 minutes remaining.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN A. PAYTON\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. PAYTON: Thank you.\nThis is a case about jobs. And I want to\nread from the letter that Justice Alito was referring\nto. This is the letter that the qualifieds received.\nIt's in our Joint Appendix at JA-35, and it's the last\nsentence of the first paragraph.\nThis is the letter that they all got. This\nis the letter that Arthur Lewis, the named person in the\ncase, got. However, it says: You are qualified; you\nare qualified; there are well-qualifieds. And it's\nunlikely -- that language is there.\nAnd then it says: \"However, because it\nis not possible at this time to predict how many\napplicants will be hired in the next few years,\nyour name will be kept on the eligible list\nmaintained by the department of personnel for as\nlong as that list is used.\"\nI did focus on the word \"used.\" And it's\nnot only in section (k). It's also in section (h),\nwhere it says, \"used to discriminate.\" Because it's an\nordinary word that the City used itself in advising\nthe Petitioners in this case.\nIn the answer to the complaint in this case,\nwhich is at Joint Appendix 19, the -- I'm sorry, Joint\nAppendix 16, the answer to -- actually, the first\nparagraph in the complaint in this case, the City says\nas follows -- this is the second sentence in the answer\nto the complaint: \"Defendant\" -- the City -- \"admits\nthat it has used and continues to use results of the 1995\nfirefighter entrance examination as part of its\nfirefighter hiring process.\" Using an unlawful cutoff\nscore -- and the eligibility list is nothing other than\nthe functional equivalent of the cutoff score -- using\nthat to make decisions on those 11 times is a violation\nof Title VII.\nAnd the argument that there is no additional\nimpact -- it is the dramatic difference between being told\nwhat someone intends to do and then they do it. You are\ntold that maybe your chances are going to be minimal in\nthe future, or maybe 50/50, but then when it actually\nstarts happening and you see other people start getting\njobs, that's an impact. That's a consequence.\nWhen I said the animating principle in\nTitle VII and disparate impact is result and\nconsequences, it's results and consequences. Those\nare additional impacts that go with the additional\nuses that clearly establish a violation of Title VII's\ndisparate impact prohibition in this case.\nI don't think that the statutory language is\nactually -- I think the best reading, as I said, of the\nstatutory language is as I said. I think the policies\nbehind how that works -- it is 300 days after every use.\nThere is a statute, but, in fact, the control over that\nis entirely within the City. If they stopped using this\nunlawful cutoff score after 300 days, they are\ncompletely done with any potential liability.\nAnd the point is you want that to be\nchallenged, because we don't want unlawful employment\npractices to continue to go forever and ever and ever\nand ever out there. And we can see, in this very case,\nthat if you don't allow the challenge, the practice goes\non and is inconsistent with the -- I'd say the\nnational policy to rid our workplace of discrimination.\nAre there any other questions otherwise?\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.\n"
