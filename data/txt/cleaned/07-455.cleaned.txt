CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument

General Mukasey.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. MICHAEL B. MUKASEY
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
GENERAL MUKASEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may
it please the Court:
The question in this case is whether a panel
of the Ninth Circuit was correct when it added the words
"in relation to," and thereby added an element to
section 844 of Title 18, and we think for at least four
reasons, the answer to that question is no.
First, and principally, those words are not
in the statute that Congress wrote, and this Court has
said many times that courts should not add words or
elements to criminal statutes.
Second, Congress knows how to include a
relational element when it wants to, and in fact, did
that in section 924(c) after which section 844 is
otherwise patterned. And that shows that when Congress
chose to leave "in relation to" out of section 844 it
did that intentionally.
Third, when section 844 was amended in 1988,
one court of appeals, the only court of appeals to rule
directly on the question of whether there was a
relationship between the carrying of explosives in the
commission of a felony, had held that there was no
relational element. Congress was on notice of that
fact -
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your argument relies
on the notion that the word "during" in the statute is
solely temporal. In other words, it just refers to the
time?
GENERAL MUKASEY: Correct.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- that's not
always the case. If I say, you know, I hung lights
during the holiday season, you wouldn't think that I
hung a chandelier, right? There'd be not simply a
temporal connection, but also a relation.
GENERAL MUKASEY: In that instance, that
would be correct. On the other hand, when Congress in
-- in 924(c) said "during and in relation to," it meant
something more than a temporal relationship. It did not
say the same thing in 844, and it failed to say the same
thing in 844(f) or the amended 924(c).
JUSTICE SCALIA: General, could -- could
Congress pass a law that said if you wear a wristwatch
during the commission of any crime, you get another 10
years?
GENERAL MUKASEY: A statute like that would
be entirely unreasonable. It was not entirely
unreasonable for Congress to have said if you carry an
explosive during the commission of a felony, you've
added something enormously volatile.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Surely it depends on what
the felony is. If the felony is the filing of a
dishonest tax return and -- and you have a can of
gasoline with you when you mail the letter, it seems to
me quite as absurd as saying wearing a wristwatch in the
course of a felony. That's what troubles me about this.
I'm -- I'm tempted to -- I think everybody
is tempted to distort the "during" to -- to mean
something else, simply because the consequences of
performing a completely lawful act wearing a wristwatch,
carrying explosives -- given the broad definition of
explosives, I guess it would include having -- having
some cartridges, explosive cartridges?
GENERAL MUKASEY: It would. But the
temptation -
JUSTICE SCALIA: That's perfectly lawful,
and you get another 10 years for it just because you're
-- you're mailing a letter to the IRS at the same time.
GENERAL MUKASEY: It is perfectly lawful.
Congress was aware that Title 18, not to mention all the
other titles, are chockablock with felonies. There are
thousands of them out there. But nonetheless, it wanted
to make sure that the mainstream that it was concerned
with, which is nicely illustrated by the facts of this
case, were taken care of; and so it passed a very broad
statute. We concede that it was a very broad statute.
"Any felony" couldn't be broader.
But that was Congress's choice. And if
Congress chooses to amend the statute, respectfully, it
ought to be Congress that amends it.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: General Mukasey, is there
any indication why this prosecutor chose to hook the
carrying an explosive onto a false-statement charge,
instead of some charges with which it would have been
more logically linked, like the one -- the first one,
conspiracy to commit an act of terror -- terrorism?
GENERAL MUKASEY: There is. At the time the
case was brought, there was evidence to charge the first
count, conspiracy to commit a terrorist act. There were
some evidentiary problems; a great deal of the evidence
to support that count did not, in fact, come until
almost literally the eve of trial. A lot of it came
from overseas.
The count to which the -- the 844 -- the
crime to which 844 was, in fact, passed, the making of a
false statement, was, to use a colloquialism, a
lead-pipe cinch. He had clearly made a false statement.
He had clearly carried an explosive while doing it.
That prosecutor's decision, in fact, was a
very responsible one, because what was shown when they
opened his trunk was that this was a very dangerous
person; and they wanted to bring a charge on which they
were sure to convict him, so that his carrying of the
explosive would get him ten years in addition to that
charge.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I guess what's troubling
me, Mr. Attorney General, is that it -- it does seem to
me fair enough to make that charge in this case; but
then we -- but then we have the tremendous number of
cases where the prosecutor is going to be in the
position in a plea-bargain context, say, to threaten to
charge this offense with a heavy mandatory minimum.
My understanding is that district judges do
not and cannot be involved in plea bargain negotiations;
they can look at a plea before it is entered.
What can you tell us about the safeguards
that might exist in the system generally against -
against overcharging, against charging for something
where the result is close to absurd, as in some of these
hypotheticals about the income tax return and the
gasoline and so forth?
GENERAL MUKASEY: The safeguard -- the
safeguard that is in the system, in part, involves the
history of the system. Rosenberg was decided, I
believe, in 1986. That's 22 years ago. There's been
no, as far as I know, recorded outbreak of this sort of
thing any place, in the Third Circuit or any place else.
And it seems to me that a defendant would be able to
challenge that kind of threat, that kind of application,
or at least make it known.
We haven't received any notification that
that's -- that that's going on, although there have been
charges of -- under 844(h), relating to ammunition. But
that's scarcely -- that's scarcely a marginal case.
The hypothetical of the fellow with the -
with the firecracker in his back pocket who is
simultaneously in possession of a $20 counterfeit
bill has no -
JUSTICE BREYER: General, that is -- my
question would be the converse. Suppose I agreed with
you to this point hypothetically that, of course,
there's a relationship here. In this case, there's a
relationship. He wouldn't have lied if he -- if he
hadn't had the explosives. Suppose I accept that.
Now, if I interpret the statute that way -
there has to be a relationship, but including that -
then what are the other cases you want to prosecute?
In the other briefs they list every funny or
comical or absurd example they can find; and so I don't
believe you want to prosecute those, but tell me if you
do. And if there are some other ones, what are they?
GENERAL MUKASEY: We don't, but,
respectfully, "relationship" doesn't mean in a statute
what "relationship" means in conversation. It means
facilitation under a knife. It means that -
JUSTICE BREYER: Fine. So suppose, in other
words, if we -- if, hypothetically, I were to say, well,
here there's a relationship; after all, it is a
necessary condition for the lying that he was carrying
explosives; and it is foreseeable that he would lie on
his passport, because he was carrying explosives
illegally. So that's all you need.
In other words, if that were the decision,
you would say fine, that's the end of it.
GENERAL MUKASEY: It was -- his carrying of
explosives did not facilitate his lying in this case.
JUSTICE BREYER: No, it didn't facilitate
it, but it caused it.
GENERAL MUKASEY: Maybe it caused it, and
maybe it didn't.
JUSTICE BREYER: Well, if it didn't -- all
right. Would you be satisfied with a result that says,
look, if this carrying of explosives is related to the
felony in the sense that it is a necessary condition and
foreseeable that a person would do such a thing, that's
sufficient?
GENERAL MUKASEY: No, Your Honor, we would
not. Because there are cases in which it may become
necessary to prosecute somebody -- for example, where we
have a situation in which we can charge another crime,
but the charge of that crime would involve disclosure of
classified information; it would disclose methods and
sources -- we believe that it was Congress's choice to
leave to the judgment of prosecutors the decision of
what crimes the charge in conjunction with possession of
explosives, and we think that's where the authority
should remain.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why is there in the
statutes a difference between possession of explosives
in this circumstance and possession of firearms?
GENERAL MUKASEY: Possession of explosives
inherently involves volatility. You asked for a policy
explanation. Possession of explosives inherently
involves a degree of volatility. Explosives cause
indiscriminate and potentially vast harm.
Firearms, for all the harm they cause, cause
discriminate harm. And there's every reason for
Congress to have treated explosives differently from the
way it treated firearms.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Was -- was the further
explanation that what they were doing in amending the
firearms statute was tailoring it more precisely to the
possible felony by a police officer situation, and they
simply did not face that possibility in the explosives
statute?
GENERAL MUKASEY: I think the history of the
amendments to 924(c) reflects that.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: So it's a difference in
two respects. One is 924(c) has the "in relationship"
requirement, and it also has a shorter term. It's only
-- in one it is five years, and the other is ten years.
Is that right?
GENERAL MUKASEY: Yes, that's correct,
Justice Ginsburg; and that underlines, I think, the
dangerousness, or Congress's perception of the
dangerousness, and the volatility of explosives. And
certainly -
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there any --
GENERAL MUKASEY: -- this case bears that
out.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there any policy
limitation within the department not to charge under
this provision unless there is a relationship between
the underlying felony and the use of -- the carrying of
explosives?
GENERAL MUKASEY: There is no policy
limitation that I'm aware of.
JUSTICE STEVENS: And you do have policy
guidelines with money laundering.
GENERAL MUKASEY: We do.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I suppose if you
thought there was a problem, you could promulgate them
out of your department.
GENERAL MUKASEY: I think I'd be ideally
suited to do that.
(Laughter.)
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The ten years,
though, is mandatory, correct?
GENERAL MUKASEY: The ten years is
mandatory.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if a prosecutor
asks for it and there is an underlying felony and there
is an explosive, that's an additional ten years, no
matter what.
GENERAL MUKASEY: That's an additional ten
years, no matter what.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if you get -- the
underlying felony is of the sort Justice Scalia was
talking about, and let's say the person gets probation
on that because, you know, it is the first offense, no
harm, he still gets ten years.
GENERAL MUKASEY: He still gets ten years.
It is possible, again, to imagine many, many marginal
situations; but I think Congress was willing to
contemplate that because it wanted to make sure that it
swept in the cases that had to be swept in.
And to add a relational element would leave
us unprotected against the cases that Congress wanted to
include, and protected only against the marginal ones.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but how many
cases are there likely to be -- this isn't one of them
-- where you have no "in relation to" connection
whatsoever?
GENERAL MUKASEY: How many cases as a matter
of common sense?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Or any historical
record that you're familiar with.
GENERAL MUKASEY: No historical record that
I'm familiar with, but I don't have complete knowledge
of the historical record.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, in this
case, as you point out, there was, of course, a
connection. And I would have thought in most cases
where the prosecutor is interested in charging -
because, as you have indicated, this case is -- there
would be an actual connection. Now, you may have, as
you suggest, problems with proof or -- or evidence; but,
as a practical matter, I'm just wondering how often the
question we're concerned about arises.
GENERAL MUKASEY: I don't think -- I'm not
aware of any other situation in which it has arisen.
But I don't -- I think Congress didn't wanted to rule
out anything when it wrote "any felony."
JUSTICE SCALIA: This isn't a very good
case. If you wanted to bring a really absurd case, you
could have picked a better one than this, because there
really is something of a connection.
GENERAL MUKASEY: I think -- I think the
lessons we learned, particularly about the history, is
that we don't want to bring absurd cases, and -- and we
don't.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I mean the
interesting thing is that you're -- the cases where this
is going to arise is not where you're really worried
about the explosives; it's going to -- because in that
case, presumably there is going to be a relation, and
you can use it as you used it in this case.
The cases where this is going to be
problematic is when you are really interested in the
underlying felony.
GENERAL MUKASEY: That -
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You know, the guy
who's driving in his car and calls his broker and is
guilty of insider trading and has some firecrackers in
the trunk, you're not worried about the firecrackers,
but you want to crack down on the insider trading.
GENERAL MUKASEY: That has to do more with
the breadth of the definition of "explosives" than it
has to do with the question of a relationship, because
we may very well be concerned with the person who is
committing what sounds like an innocuous felony but
carrying a load of explosives in his trunk. So
weaving in a relational requirement isn't going to solve
the problem that's posed in what I think is Your Honor's
hypothetical, which is the fact that firecrackers are as
much explosives as bombs under the "explosives"
definition contained in the statute.
If there are no further questions, I'd like,
Mr. Chief Justice, to reserve the remainder of my time
for rebuttal.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Mr. Attorney General.
Mr. Hillier.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS W. HILLIER, II
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. HILLIER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
General Mukasey put his finger on the point
here when he said we wanted to charge a lead-pipe cinch
case. But in doing so, what we now have is what was a
terrorism prosecution and a choice to link the
underlying felony -- or to link the carrying explosives
charges exclusively to count 5 of the indictment, which
charged a false statement, an argument which requests
that this Court apply this statute to all sorts of
situations theoretically that might even involve
explosives that were lawfully carried during a
completely unrelated felony. And I would disagree that
that's what Congress thought, that's what Congress
thought when it was creating this statute.
The words -- in applying this Court's
statutory construction regime, what we do first of all,
of course, is look to the words of the text to see if it
means what the government suggests it does in this case.
And as, Chief Justice Roberts, you have already
indicated, the word "during" has meanings beyond just
that in 401 used here. But also other words in the text
have significance to describing what the meaning of this
particular statute is, and important among those are the
terms "in which," which is found in the concluding
sentence of the statute. And, of course, that's -- the
companion word, the largest word in this particular
statute, "explosives," and its very broad definition
under 844(j).
Taking first the term "in which," which is
at the conclusion of 844(h) -- and I'll quote. And what
it says is that the penalty that's going to attach to
this prosecution shall run consecutively to, quote, "the
felony in which the explosive was used or carried."
JUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying it should
have said "during which"?
MR. HILLIER: Well, I -
JUSTICE SCALIA: "During the commission of
which the explosive was used or carried"?
MR. HILLIER: I just think that the words -
the words that were used, Your Honor, establish the
notion of a relationship between the felony and the
explosive. The word "in" is, as this Court indicated in
Dunn v. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 519 U.S.
465, is synonymous with the words "in regard to" or
"with respect to."
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but just -
just as "during" has more than temporal -- can have more
than temporal significance, I think "in" can have
temporal significance.
MR. HILLIER: It does, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We write "in the
holiday season."
MR. HILLIER: That's very true. And it
fact, it has a, quote, "locational" sort of significance
also. But as noted in Dunn, its primary definition, its
first definition, is this relational one. And, while it
might have -
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I assume -- I
haven't looked at the dictionary -- but "during's" first
relationship -- first definition, I suspect, is
temporal.
MR. HILLIER: It's temporal. That's
correct.
JUSTICE ALITO: Could you give an example of
where it's not temporal, an example of use of "during"
that is not temporal?
MR. HILLIER: I think the example posed by
the Chief Justice to General Mukasey is an example of
that, Your Honor.
JUSTICE ALITO: But hanging up lights
"during" the -- the holiday season doesn't -- that's not
a temporal relationship?
MR. HILLIER: It's a -- it is a temporal
relationship, but it's a relationship between the act
that's occurring also, that's the underlying act.
But to get to the point of the -- Chief
Justice Robert's question, the fact that the word may
have more than one meaning, particularly in this case,
does not exclude the fact that the meaning of "in which"
includes a relationship. And the most naturally
suggested reading of these words in this case, "in
which" and "explosives" together, is that there is a
relationship, but there is -
JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Hillier, I -- you know,
I will accept maybe more than just for the sake of
argument that if you stick to the text alone you've got
an argument here for some uncertainty, for some
ambiguity.
The trouble that I have with your argument
is that we're here to consider not only text but
statutory history, And the statutory history seems to me
pretty tough for you to get over. The statute was
amended. The word "unlawfully" was dropped from it, and
there was no amendment made, with respect to its
cognates, to conform it to the cognate section on
carrying a gun that specified "in relation to." And it
seems to me that the most reasonable inference to draw
from that statutory history is that when Congress
amended and technically re-enacted the statute, when it
dropped "unlawfully," that it did not want "during" to
be read, as it was in the handgun statute, "in relation
to."
And I -- that's seems to me the tough point
of the argument. What is your response to that?
MR. HILLIER: Yes, Your Honor. Two points:
First, the idea -- the idea of in pari materia, which
would suggest that what's happening in 924(c) ought to
be occurring in 844 is -- has not the force that it
would if we were talking about amendments to and
constructions of the same statute, but rather what we
have here are two statutes that are being interpreted by
two legislators at different times to achieve different
objects. And there's no reason to believe that the -
well, the force of that -
JUSTICE SOUTER: The different object -- I
mean, the trouble with the different object argument is,
as the Attorney General said, there was an evident
concern in amending the handgun statute not to sweep in
the rogue police officer who happens to have a gun on
him when he does something that in fact is unlawful.
MR. HILLIER: Right.
JUSTICE SOUTER: The negative inference from
that is that there was an intent in the cognate
explosives statute to sweep in people, whether in fact
it was in relation to or not in relation to.
MR. HILLIER: Your Honor, I think that -
JUSTICE SCALIA: Including the policeman who
had cartridges in his gun, presumably, right?
MR. HILLIER: Well, Your Honor, I think
the -- when you're looking at what happened to 844, when
"unlawfully" was taken out the words "in which" were
added, which I think indicates that Congress had an
appreciation of the relationship that's involved in that
statute. While the legislative history doesn't say why
"unlawfully" was taken out, it seems reasonable to
believe that what they were trying to do was conform the
statute to the purpose of -- its purpose. And its
purpose did include, when you look at the "explosives"
definition, the use of lawful explosives to further
crimes.
So if somebody has a can of gasoline and
they want to use that to threaten somebody and create a
Federal crime or to accomplish a Federal crime, before
that amendment occurred that -- that would have been a
lawful possession of the explosives, so 844(h)(2) would
not apply.
JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, fair enough so far as
the argument goes. But that still leaves Congress
taking the -- sort of making it as difficult as possible
for you to take the position that you're taking, rather
than as easy as possible.
Why didn't it put in "in relation to"?
MR. HILLIER: Well, the -- I think we go to
yet another statutory construction tool, or at least
observation by this Court that said the Congress can use
different words in different statutes to accomplish the
same thing.
JUSTICE SOUTER: It can do it, but why would
it have done so? You've the -- you've got the gun
example sitting there. And why would it not have done
so if, in fact -- so obvious a thing to do if that's
what -- if it intended to come out your way?
MR. HILLIER: Well, Your Honor, we don't
know it didn't do that because the legislative history
doesn't inform us. But to draw an analogy from your
question with respect to changes done in these two exact
statutes, as you read from the government's reply brief,
it is trying to establish through the words "during the
commission of" the fact that it is the defendant that
committed that crime, in other words it was he that did
so. And we don't take any issue with that; in fact, it
makes complete sense.
But it's interesting to note that 924(c) in
1971 was amended to put these -- to substitute the words
"for which he may be prosecuted" instead of "which may
be prosecuted." So one might ask why didn't they put
the word "he" into 844 at the same time if there was any
question about who the perpetrator of the crime was.
JUSTICE GINSBURG: And maybe they said -
maybe because they're trying to draft legislation
without using pronouns.
(Laughter.)
MR. HILLIER: Touché, Your Honor. Yes.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I take it that one of the
reasons you make your argument is so that if you prevail
and you go back to trial, you would argue that this is
not in relation to? Is that correct?
MR. HILLIER: Your Honor, perhaps I didn't
understand your question. If you could rephrase it.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: If you prevail in this
case and we say "in relation to" is part of the statute
--
MR. HILLIER: Yes.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- and then you go back to
the trial court, I assume you will argue to the jury
that the government can't show that it's in relation to.
MR. HILLIER: Well, Your Honor, if you agree
that there's a -- if you agree with the Ninth Circuit in
this case, then the case is over.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's right.
MR. HILLIER: The government -
JUSTICE BREYER: Why should we agree with
that?
JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it seems to me that in
a prosecution, in this prosecution, it might be somewhat
difficult to establish in relation to.
MR. HILLIER: It would be difficult -
JUSTICE KENNEDY: And that would be -- even
assuming the jury was properly instructed, et cetera, et
cetera.
MR. HILLIER: Right. Right. It's as poison
here. They don't have a relationship. The explosives
were not used to -
JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right, but doesn't
that show the necessity for the very interpretation the
attorney general has argued for here? It is just too
difficult to establish and very dangerous?
MR. HILLIER: Your Honor, if we can look at
the facts of this case, I would respectfully disagree.
What was done here was a charging decision which made
that task impossible. The government could have simply
charged this count with count 1, and we wouldn't be here
today because surely the explosives were carried for the
purpose of accomplishing the act of terrorism that was
charged count 1.
JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if there's an "in
relationship" requirement, why would it be necessary for
the explosives to facilitate the false statement? Why
wouldn't it be sufficient if the false statement
facilitated the unlawful use of the explosives?
MR. HILLIER: We have a reverse sort of
relationship.
Your Honor, two answers to that: First, it
would be at odds with the structure of the statute. If
you look at the whole of 844(h), you see in (h)(1), the
crime of using an explosive to -- an explosive to commit
an underlying felony. And that is that sort of direct
relationship that is carried forward in the language of
(h)(2).
But, secondly, that language -- that sort of
relationship has been interpreted by this Court in Smith
as acknowledged by the government in its briefing to
mean the relationship that we're talking about.
JUSTICE BREYER: That's exactly what's
bothering me. The issue in this case doesn't seem to me
to be these weird hypotheticals. Of course it requires
a relationship, in my mind.
But I don't see why the relationship
couldn't be exactly the one Justice Alito was talking
about. I mean, imagine a person has a packed car filled
with explosives. He's going to blow something up. A
policemen comes up; he shoots the policeman. The reason
he shot the policeman was because he had his car packed
with explosives.
And if this -- if this provision -- I mean,
I can't understand why this provision wouldn't be aimed
directly at that kind of thing.
MR. HILLIER: Your Honor, I can't say too
much more than what I have. When you look at the
statute -
JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Suppose I don't
agree with you about that -
JUSTICE SCALIA: You could say it is not a
question on which we grant certiorari.
MR. HILLIER: Well, that's -
(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER: That may be, but I don't
know -- but you could say that. You could say that.
But the problem is I have to answer the question -- I
have to reach an answer that I believe should be
sensible.
MR. HILLIER: Yes, sir.
JUSTICE BREYER: So what should I do -
MR. HILLIER: Well, Your Honor -
JUSTICE BREYER: -- if I think that shooting
the policeman because he's going to catch the criminal
filled with explosives is within this statute? And
similarly, lying to a customs officer so he won't catch
me when my car is filled with explosives is within the
statute?
Suppose I believe that, but I also think the
statute is not meant to govern those odd hypotheticals
that you come up with? There has to be a relationship,
but the one I described falls within the word
"relationship."
Now what do I do?
MR. HILLIER: Well, Your Honor, the
relationship -- if you look at the structure of the
statute, surely (h)(1) does not describe that sort of
relationship; (h)(2) is the next statute or the next
subsection of that statute, and its purpose is simply to
capture the same criminal objective here, that is to
say, the marriage of explosives and a felony.
JUSTICE BREYER: I understand that argument.
But suppose I don't accept the argument? Then what do I
do in this case? That's what I'm asking.
MR. HILLIER: I would ask the Court -- well,
I would think the Court would draw some -- an answer
from Smith which did describe a relationship contrary to
the way Your Honor is doing with respect to this case
that goes back to -- goes -- wasn't instructed that way;
and so it can't be -- this case still has to go back.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: You think on this
evidence, on this record, that a jury, if it were
instructed to -- that it had to find "in relation to"
could return a conviction of guilty including the "in
relation to"?
MR. HILLIER: If this case had been
instructed correctly?
JUSTICE KENNEDY: If this case had been
instructed according to your theory of the statute and
on this record and on this evidence, could a jury find
your client guilty?
MR. HILLIER: No, Your Honor.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's exactly why the
attorney general says he needs it.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, you got it anyway.
MR. HILLIER: Beg your pardon, Your Honor?
JUSTICE SCALIA: Could I ask you about the
"in which," the "in which" thing? It has just occurred
to me that "in which" is in a very sloppy clause anyway,
because it says "shall run concurrently with any other
term of imprisonment, including that imposed for the
felony in which the explosive was used or carried."
What about the fire? It omits fire entirely
-- in which fire or the explosive. Fire or the
explosive was used or the explosive was carried. It's a
pretty sloppy job down at the end of (h), isn't it?
So I wouldn't put a whole lot of weight on
the "in which" given that the rest of it is so sloppy.
MR. HILLIER: Well, Your Honor, the "in
which" -- the point obviously was that it strengthens
and informs the relationship here to be more than the
coincidental or temporal one the government -
JUSTICE SCALIA: If you are being very
precise, but whoever wrote that was, obviously, not
being very precise because he left out "fire" entirely.
MR. HILLIER: I suppose that goes to the
idea that we shouldn't draw a lot of information from
the amendments that were occurring on 924 when they
weren't even looking at this statute and considering it
and its consequences to the changes in 844 -- or having
effect in 844.
Your Honor, I would just simply conclude by
indicating that the terms, which I think we agree,
naturally suggest that there must be a relationship, and
the breadth of the term "explosives" includes a lot of
lawful items that can be carried, if they were carried
in a felony, must be related to that felony if you're
going to have 844's effect and its purpose, because when
you look at the purpose of the act and the way that they
constructed it so carefully and thoughtfully in terms of
the crimes that were -- or the -- the use of explosives,
it applies only to that portion of the statute that
involves illegal use of criminal -- of explosives. And
the combination of all of these elements certainly gives
force to our argument and tends to rub -- tends to do
the opposite to the government.
At the end of the day, if there's anything
to be said for the government's argument, then there is
an ambiguity, and it should be construed in favor of the
defendant.
And I -- just a concluding point to answer
Justice Kennedy's questions, the government could have
avoided all of this by simply charging this case, as it
should have, by linking count 9 with count 1, where the
proof problem wouldn't have been a -- the only
difference in the proof would have been -- there would
have been no difference in the proof. The only
difference in the case would have been they would have
admitted a different instruction.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your friend
indicated that this issue doesn't come up very often as
a practical matter. Do you disagree with that?
MR. HILLIER: Well, Your Honor -- no, I
don't disagree with that, and I'm not sure why that is.
But I think it's been alluded to by the Court already in
its questioning. It could be that prosecutors simply
recognized this to be a good plea bargaining chip and
maybe the other prosecutors understand that there's a
relationship required.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
Mr. Attorney General, you have 14 minutes
remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. MICHAEL B. MUKASEY
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
GENERAL MUKASEY: I just wanted to make two
brief points on rebuttal. First, Justice Breyer's
question and position appears to read in a relational
element that's also not in this statute. And our view
is that that is something that should be done, if
anybody, by Congress.
And secondly, that the Respondent's
reference to gasoline as an explosive I think is a bit
of -- is a bit of a reach. I don't think gasoline is
generally regarded as an explosive unless it is prepared
and processed and presented in a certain way with -- in
ways that are not present simply by carrying a can of
gasoline to help a -- to help out a friend who's run out
of gas.
JUSTICE SCALIA: And maybe gunpowder doesn't
include the little bit that's in a cartridge either.
You think it does?
GENERAL MUKASEY: I think it does.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, could I ask
you, do you have an answer to your friend's point about
the "in which" language?
GENERAL MUKASEY: The "in which" simply
includes both, number one, the use -- the actual use
and, number two, the carrying.
I agree that it's not a model of elegant
construction, but "in which" does include the two, both
the actual use and the mere carrying.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understood his
point to be that it's surprising that they refer to use
of the explosives or carrying of the explosives with
reference to the underlying felony, "in which" the -
suggests that the explosive was used or carried with
respect to the underlying felony.
And I understood your position to be that it
doesn't have to be.
GENERAL MUKASEY: No, I think it suggests
simply that the underlying felony was, in fact,
committed.
JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it was going to be -
it was going to be inaccurate as to one or the other of
one or two. If you said "during," that would be -- that
would be inaccurate as to one.
And "in" is accurate as to one but
inaccurate as to two. I guess they should have said "in
or during" or "in which."
They should have added "fire," too, right?
(Laughter.)
GENERAL MUKASEY: If there are no further
questions -
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
Mr. Attorney General.
Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 12:01 p.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.)
