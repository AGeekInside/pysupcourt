GROSSMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThe text of section 10(b) as well as the\nrule 10b-5 promulgated by the Securities and Exchange\nCommission prohibit the use of any deceptive device by\nany person, indirectly or indirectly, in connection with\nthe purchase or sale of a security. The various\ndeceptive devices used by the Respondents in this case\nis conduct that is squarely covered by the text of the\nstatute and by the rule.\nRespondents here were not passive bystanders\nfacilitating a fraud by Charter. Their deceptive\nconduct was integral to the scheme to create fictitious\nadvertising revenues for Charter to report to investors.\nRespondents agreed to overcharge Charter so\nthat they could receive the money from Charter to then\nreturn to it for the advertising, using Charter's very\nsame money for the purchase of the advertising.\nRespondent Scientific-Atlanta created a document\nfalsely claiming that the reason for the increased\npayments from Charter were because of increased\nmanufacturing expenses.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: The transaction was not\nwholly without benefit to Scientific-Atlanta. They got\nsome advertising. And it was not wholly without benefit\nto Charter. They were able to show that advertising\nworks. Now, that puts aside the fact that they were\nusing misleading accounting principles.\nMR. GROSSMAN: Well, I would agree, Your\nHonor, that they received free advertising. But the\nproblem was that they were creating the illusion that it\nwasn't free advertising, but rather that they were\npurchasing the advertising.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: And was the price four to\nfive times higher than the normal rates for advertising?\nMR. GROSSMAN: That is correct, Justice\nGinsburg.\nAnd the obvious purpose for creating the\nillusion that they were purchasing the advertising\nrather than receiving free advertising was so that\nCharter can incorporate these increased revenues in\ntheir financial statements. And Respondents understood,\nthey understood that in order to -- for Charter to pass\nthis by their accountants, to deceive the accountants --\nand this is reflected in the indictment -- in order to\ndeceive the accountants for Charter, the Respondents\nwere told that there had to be separate agreements for\nboth the advertising agreements and the purchase\nagreements.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Grossman, is there any\nreason why, in principle, the elements for a cause of\naction under 10b-5 have to be the same as the elements\nfor a cause of action by the agency under 10(b)? I mean,\nwe, we created this, this cause of action. It's not set\nforth in the statute, although other private causes of\naction are.\nIf it's our creation, couldn't we sensibly\nlimit it so that, for example, schemes can be attacked\nby the SEC, but schemes do not form the basis for\nprivate attorney general's actions? You need actual\nconveyance of a misrepresentation to the injured party.\nIs there any reason why we couldn't do that?\nMR. GROSSMAN: Well, I think there are two\nreasons, Your Honor. The first is that at this point in\ntime -- I think as the Court recognized in Dura fairly\nrecently -- that when Congress enacted the Private\nSecurity Law Reform Act, that at that time they accepted\nthe private right of action that this Court had\npreviously inferred. And this Court had previously\ninferred the private right of action not only for the\nsection but each of the rules in Section 10(b).\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it's not like\nunder the Sherman Act, where we have reason to think\nCongress intended the Court to go about the business of\nconstruing and developing antitrust law. In fact, they\nhave kind of taken over for us. They are imposing\ncertain limits on when actions can be brought, proposing\nparticular specific elements. In one of the provisions,\n20(e), specifying the SEC can bring an action but\nprivate investors can't.\nI mean, we don't get in this business of\nimplying private rights of action any more. And isn't\nthe effort by Congress to legislate a good signal that\nthey have kind of picked up the ball and they are\nrunning with it and we shouldn't?\nMR. GROSSMAN: Well, this Court, Your Honor,\nas recently as 2002 in Wharf (Holdings) said there is a\nprivate right of action for violation of any of the\nsubdivisions of rule 10b-5: a, b, or c. That would\nhave to be reversed.\nGoing back to the Superintendent of\nInsurance case in, in -- that would be in 1971, Your\nHonor, the Court held there was a private right of\naction for violation of --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's kind of\nmy point. We did that sort of thing in 1971. We\nhaven't done it for quite sometime.\nMR. GROSSMAN: But when Congress enacted\nthe Private Security Law Reform Act, everything it did\nin connection with that statute was directed to the\nprivate right of action that this Court had previously\nimplied under 10(b). Nothing that Congress did was\nintended in any way --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm not -- my\nsuggestion is not that we should go back and say that\nthere is no private right of action. My suggestion is\nthat we should get out of the business of expanding it,\nbecause Congress has taken over and is legislating in\nthe area in a way they weren't back when we implied\nthe right of action under 10(b).\nMR. GROSSMAN: Well, I would agree,\nCongress has taken it over. And when they enacted the\nPrivate Security Law Reform Act, they recognized this\nprivate right of action. Everything they did recognized\nthe private right of action. It recognized that there\nwould be multiple primary violators of 10(b). It did\nthat in connection with proportionate liability\nprovisions. It recognized that there would be multiple\nplayers.\nSo certainly, Congress had an understanding\nof what this Court had done up until that time. And\nthis Court up until that time had implied the private\nright of action for every subset of rule 10b-5.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is it -- is it a\nnecessary part of your theory that the deceptive\npractice that Scientific-Atlanta went in, that they\nknew that that was also -- that Charter would carry that\nforward? I mean, let's suppose that there were benefits\nto this deceptive practice to Scientific-Atlanta, that\nit looked like it had more money to spend on advertising\nthan it really did, but they didn't care what Charter\ndid with it. In fact, they didn't know that Charter was\ngoing to carry it on its books the way they did. Would\nthere still be liability for Scientific-Atlanta?\nMR. GROSSMAN: No. No, not under the test\nthat we have proposed, which is very similar to the test\nproposed by the Ninth Circuit or applied in the Ninth\nCircuit in the Simpson case, and the test proposed by\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission in their amicus\nbrief submitted in the Simpson case. It's not enough\nto just to have the deceptive act. The deceptive act for\nscheme liability has to be with the purpose of\nfurthering a scheme to defraud investors.\nSo if Scientific-Atlanta or Motorola had\nengaged in deceptive conduct, but that deceptive conduct\nwas not intended to further a scheme to defraud the\nshareholders, no, Your Honor, there would be no action\nunder the theory that we are pursuing here.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Intended or known? I mean,\nI don't see -- what's in it for Scientific-Atlanta to\ndefraud the shareholders? Is it enough that they just\nknew it would be used for that purpose?\nMR. GROSSMAN: Oh, it would be enough if\nthey committed a deceptive act and they knew it was in\nfurtherance of a scheme.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, when you say \"in\nfurtherance of,\" you -- you import intent. They didn't\ncare what Charter was going to do with it, but they\npretty well knew that what Charter was going to do was\nto make its books look better.\nWould that be enough?\nMR. GROSSMAN: I think that would be\nreckless.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That's what I thought your\nposition was.\nMR. GROSSMAN: Yes, but my position is also\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So it's not an intent\nnecessarily. It's just knowledge.\nMR. GROSSMAN: It certainly needs scienter.\nYou certainly need scienter.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, it's more than\nknowledge. I mean, you mentioned recklessness. It's got\nto have either knowledge of or a willingness to maintain\nan indifference to the consequence.\nMR. GROSSMAN: Exactly right, Justice\nSouter. And I think it's important -- and there is a\nvery -- there is a very good discussion of this in the\nSimpson case by the Ninth Circuit, that the purpose of\nthe test is such that it will not ensnare someone who\ndoes engage in a deceptive act but doesn't understand\nthat the reason for it is to further a scheme.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Sure. After trial -- you\nknow, after trial which causes your stock to tank, you\nmay indeed be able to show that you didn't know it was\ngoing to be used for that purpose. I mean, that's what\nthis is all about, isn't it, getting it -- getting it by\nthe summary-judgment stage?\nMR. GROSSMAN: No. I think, Your Honor,\nthat this Court answered this last term in the Tellabs\ncase. And Congress answered that question that you pose\nin the PSLRA, the Private Security Law Reform Act, so\nthat you cannot just bring a case and hope to get it by\nthe summary-judgment stage. You have to have\nparticularized facts alleged under the heightened\npleading standards of the PSLRA and this Court's\ndecision in Tellabs showing that not only the deceptive\nact, but that the purpose of that deceptive act was to\nfurther a scheme. So, no, you can't just --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What facts -- what has to\nbe alleged short of -- on information and belief the\ndefendant knew that -- that this information would\nappear on the balance sheets and be used to improve the\nstatus of the stock?\nMR. GROSSMAN: Well, of course if you just\n-- if you just allege it on information and belief,\nyou're out of court. No doubt about that. That doesn't\npass the heightened pleading standard in Tellabs or the\nPSLRA. What you do need is what we have here. Here you\nhave allegations -- and we didn't make these allegations\nfrom whole cloth -- these allegations were derived\nprincipally from a grand jury -- the Federal grand\njury indictment against Charter executives. That\nindictment says that Respondents were informed and\nordered to deceive Charter's accountants. They had to\nhave --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why shouldn't we be\nguided by what Congress did in reaction to the Central\nBank case? There we said there's no aiding-and-abetting\nliability, Congress amended the statute in 20(e) to say\nyes, there is, but private plaintiffs can't sue on that\nbasis. Why shouldn't that inform how we further develop\nthe private action under 10b-5?\nMR. GROSSMAN: Well, I think if Congress\nintended under 20(e) -- certainly the private actions\nsimilar to this -- it would have said that only the SEC\nhas the authority to bring a claim for substantial\nassistance whether or not it involves deceptive conduct.\nThey could have very easily said \"any deceptive conduct,\"\nand that would have barred these claims. They chose not\nto do that.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But they were --\nthey were addressing a very specific decision from this\nCourt, the Central Bank decision. And the one thing\nthey did not do is say that that decision was wrong\nwith respect to private -- or going forward they weren't\ngoing to overrule that decision with respect to private\nrights of action. You're asking us to extend to non --\nI know you call it a primary violator, but not the\nperson who --\nMR. GROSSMAN: Secondary actors.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- who put the\ndeceptive conduct into the market. You're asking us to\nextend that liability to them, which seems inconsistent\nwith Congress's approach in 20(e).\nMR. GROSSMAN: We are not asking any\nextension. Quite the contrary, Your Honor. I think\nthat is the Respondents who are asking for a narrowing.\nWhen Congress addressed the PSLRA it addressed all of\nthe arguments that we are hearing today from Respondents\nand their amici.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Is your theory dependent on\nthe proposition that Scientific-Atlanta and Motorola\ndeceived Arthur Andersen?\nMR. GROSSMAN: That certainly is a large\npart of it. Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE ALITO: But didn't you allege\nexactly the opposite in your complaint?\nMR. GROSSMAN: No. We -- I think what\nyou're referring to is that -- is that the accountants\nshould have conducted a more diligent audit than they\ndid. I mean these people clearly were trying to deceive\nthe auditors. Why else would you issue a document\nfalsely stating a reason for a price increase?\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, I'm looking at\nparagraph 218 of your amended complaint, 109a of the\njoint appendix, subsection 4. It says, speaking of\nArthur Andersen, \"though aware that Charter was seeking\nto boost its revenues by paying vendors higher prices at\nthe same time it received additional advertising from\nthe same vendors, Andersen failed to properly audit\nthese transactions by confirming them with the vendors.\"\nSo you alleged that they weren't deceived. You alleged\nthat they knew exactly what was going on.\nMR. GROSSMAN: No -- no, Your Honor, they\nknew that they were paying the vendors higher prices,\nbut they didn't know why. The contract -- the contract\nfor the higher prices was followed by this misstatement\nsaying the reason for the higher prices is because of\nincreased manufacturing expenses, when in fact that\nwasn't the reason. The reason was to take money --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Who told -- who told\nCharter that it was necessary for them to have a time\nspread between the contract -- the $20 above the\ncontract price and the advertising payment?\nMR. GROSSMAN: Arthur Andersen.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, if it told them\nthat, didn't it have -- it sounds to me from that that\nthe accountant says, look, if you want to make this\nappear on the balance sheet as though the advertising\nrevenues were just ordinary advertising revenues, you\nbetter separate these two. That suggests that Arthur\nAndersen knew all along what was going on.\nMR. GROSSMAN: No. Justice Ginsburg, what\nArthur Andersen did not know -- and this is very clear.\nThey did not know that it was Charter's own money that\nwas being used by the Respondents to purchase the\nadvertising. They were deceived by that document that\nsaid, we are increasing the price on the set-top boxes\nbecause of increased manufacturing expense. That was\nfalse. The reason they were increasing it is because\nCharter was delivering the money to them.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that's exactly the\nthing they told them to separate.\nMR. GROSSMAN: Well, not for that reason,\nYour Honor.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What other reason?\nMR. GROSSMAN: The reason is as follows.\nThis is what they refer to as barter contracts, two\ncompanies exchanging things, which is perfectly\nlegitimate, there's nothing wrong with that. And there\nare certain ways to account for it properly, and what\nArthur Andersen was telling Charter was in order to be\nable to have revenues included, gross revenues, you have\nto have unrelated -- unrelated contracts. They couldn't\nbe a barter transaction. But there is no way -- no way\nthat you could recognize the advertising revenues if\nyou're using Charter's own money, and that's what Arthur\nAndersen did not do. It would be no different, Justice\nScalia, if Charter delivered a suitcase filled with cash\nand gave it to them and said okay, buy the advertising\nfrom us.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I understand what you're\nsaying. It seems to me that when you say that they\ncan't be connected, you're saying precisely, you can't\nbe bartering the advertising revenue for the increased\nmoney that you're paying.\nMR. GROSSMAN: No. You can barter. You can\nbarter, it's just a question of how you account for it.\nBut the bartering is one thing. I mean, that's one\naccounting principle relating to bartering, but there is\nno accounting principle that permits the recording of\nrevenue if you're using the money from the seller. And\nthat's why they disguised --\nJUSTICE ALITO: All right, just -- just to\nbe clear on this -- if Charter and Arthur Andersen and\nScientific-Atlanta and Motorola all sat down and cooked\nup this scheme together and they all knew exactly what\nwas going on, would you have a claim against the\nRespondents here?\nMR. GROSSMAN: Yes. And the reason for\nthat, Your Honor, is because the advertising contract\nwas a sham, and the advertising contract was a sham\nbecause Charter was giving the Respondents the money to\nbuy the advertising.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Then I see absolutely no\ndifference between your test and the elements of aiding\nand abetting.\nMR. GROSSMAN: The difference is here we\nwould have conceptual --\nJUSTICE ALITO: Because you just said that\nit's not necessary for there to be an actual deceptive\nact on the part of the Respondents.\nMR. GROSSMAN: There has to be a deception\n-- there is deception. The deception is you're entering\ninto an advertising contract that presents the illusion\nthat you were purchasing advertising, when in fact you\nwere not purchasing the advertising.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's -- but\nthat's not the fraud that was imposed upon the market.\nThe fraud that was imposed on the market was Charter's\naccounting for the transaction on its books. Nobody\nbought or sold stock in reliance upon the way that\nScientific-Atlanta and Charter structured their deal.\nThey did so in reliance on the way that Charter\ncommunicated its accounting to the marketplace.\nMR. GROSSMAN: There was no way -- no way\nthat that could properly be accounted for, and the\nRespondents understood that. And that's why they did\nwhat they did, that's what --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But you're saying --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But there are -- there are\nany number of kickbacks and mismanagement and petty\nfrauds that go on in the business, and business people\nknow that any publicly held company's shares are going\nto be affected by its profits, so I see no limitation to\nyour -- to your proposal for liability.\nMR. GROSSMAN: Well, I think the limitations\nare as follows, Your Honor. Number one, there has to be\nthe purpose of furthering a scheme to defraud\nshareholders. Number two, the test has an element of\nmateriality, that it cannot be --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I agree with Justice\nScalia's earlier comment, I don't think that\nScientific-Atlanta and Motorola really cared anything of\n-- one way or the other about the investors.\nMR. GROSSMAN: Well, that may be that they\ndidn't care about the investors --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: For them the scheme made a\ncertain amount of sense, they didn't really care.\nMR. GROSSMAN: Well, they may not have cared,\nbut that would be reckless because they certainly\nunderstood --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's far different\nfrom having a purpose. You said they have to have a\npurpose.\nMR. GROSSMAN: That's correct. If you just\nclose your eyes -- if somebody comes to you and says,\nlook, we want you to enter into this transaction, it's a\nphony transaction and we don't care -- do whatever you\nwant with that, and they know it's a publicly held\ncorporation and they have every reason to understand\nthat this information --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Which goes back to my\nearlier question, that most people that engage in\nfrauds on business know that if it's a publicly held\ncorporation, it's going to hurt the price of the shares\nor affect the price of the shares.\nMR. GROSSMAN: Well, they shouldn't engage\nin schemes to defraud, that's what Congress intended by\nsection 10.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But as I understand your\nargument, it is the difference between aiding and\nabetting liability on the part of the Respondents and\nliability as, in effect, as first line principles, is\ntheir intent, or at the very least in knowledge that\nthey were committing a deceptive act as part of this\nscheme. Is that correct?\nMR. GROSSMAN: That they have to commit the\ndeceptive act --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.\nMR. GROSSMAN: -- with the requisite intent.\nThat's correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Now, how many times are\nparties of the position of Respondents ever going to\nengage in those acts except with exactly the state of\nmind that on your judgment makes them principals, rather\nthan aiders and abettors.\nMR. GROSSMAN: It is not on my judgment. It\nhas to be pled with the particularity required by the\nPSLRA.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: No. No, I realize that you\nhave to plead it. What I'm getting at is: Are you\nmaking a distinction that in the real world is not a\ndistinction? That, in reality, no one is going to do\nwhat these Respondents did without the kind of knowledge\nor intent that makes them, on your theory, principals\nrather than aiders or abettors?\nMR. GROSSMAN: No, there are cases, I think,\nYour Honor, where they can engage in deceptive conduct,\nand there would not be the purpose to defraud\nshareholders. For instance, Charter may have come to\nthem and said look, do me a favor, says the sales\nmanager. I want to make my numbers for this period so I\ncan take my wife on a trip to Hawaii that the company\nwill give me.\nSo the company gives him a phony order,\nthinking that's the purpose of it. That's the purpose\nof the phony order to help this guy along.\nWell, you've engaged in a deceptive act. It\nmay be deceptive under 10(b), but you wouldn't satisfy\nthe \"purpose\" test, because the purpose --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: In other words, it's\ndeceptive but not deceptive in relation to, or for the\npurpose of, deceiving the -- someone like the Petitioner.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, wouldn't it --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But don't aiders and\nabettors have to have that purpose as well? What\ndistinguishes -- what distinguishes the liability that\nyou propose from aider and abettor liability?\nMR. GROSSMAN: You have to engage in a\ndeceptive act under 10(b). 10(b) prohibits any deceptive\nact.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: I thought you were telling\nme that in each case there may be a deceptive act but\nnot a deceptive act in relation to somebody like the\nPetitioner here.\nMR. GROSSMAN: Exactly.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But that's a different\nanswer, I think, from the one you were just giving\nJustice Scalia.\nMR. GROSSMAN: No. I -- I understood,\nperhaps mistakenly, from Justice Scalia that there\nwasn't a deceptive act in your hypothetical. If there\nis a deceptive act, then it's prohibited by 10(b), and\nwe move to the next statute --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So any aiding-and-abetting\nthrough a deceptive act makes you a principal? Is that\nit? You can't be an aider and abettor by committing or\nenabling a deceptive act without becoming a principal?\nMR. GROSSMAN: No. Not at all.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You cannot?\nMR. GROSSMAN: You, yourself -- you,\nyourself, have to engage in the deceptive act.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.\nMR. GROSSMAN: Your own deceptive act.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but -- but if you do,\nor if you should have known, you are not an aider and\nabettor. You are automatically a principal.\nMR. GROSSMAN: You may be a principal if you\nsatisfy the other elements of our test, which are\nserious elements that you have to plead with\nparticularity, with the heightened pleading standards,\nthat they have the purpose to further a scheme to\ndefraud. That's very different --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Is it fair to say that all\naiders and abettors who commit deceptive acts are\nprincipals?\nMR. GROSSMAN: No.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: What's the difference?\nWhat separates the two?\nMR. GROSSMAN: There are tests. You have\nto take it the next step further, because whether or\nnot that deceptive act had the purpose and effect of\nfurthering a scheme on investors.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Don't you need that to be\nan aider or abettor?\nMR. GROSSMAN: An aider or abettor? You\nhave to have --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: If I'm entirely innocent,\nand I don't --\nMR. GROSSMAN: An aider -- certainly --\ncertainly, the primary violator in the situation that we\nare discussing where there are deceptive acts is aiding\nand abetting.\nI mean, if an accountant comes in and\ndeliberately falsifies a financial statement, he is\ngiving substantial assistance to the company's statement\n-- the company who is issuing those false statements.\nHe would be an aider and abettor in that sense. He is\nalso a primary --\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You see, I really thought\nthe difference was that the principal is the one who\nmakes the deceptive representation and obtains money\nfrom it. The aider and abettor is the person who\nfacilitates or enables that deceptive representation,\nwhich is what we have here.\nMR. GROSSMAN: No.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: And you say if you\nfacilitate knowingly and intentionally or even grossly\nnegligently, you are not an aider and abettor, but\nyou're a principal. I really don't understand what's\nthe line between the two.\nMR. GROSSMAN: If you facilitate with a\ndeceptive act, then you're a primary violator. That's\nwhat section 10(b) prohibits. If you facilitate without\na deceptive act, then you are an aider and abettor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Grossman, before you\nfinish, there is one statement made by the other side\nthat you are trying to use this -- small in comparison\nto all the fraud that was involved here in order to\ncollect on the entire loss. That is, you are asserting\nthat the vendors are liable for the entire loss when\nthey were just a bit player.\nMR. GROSSMAN: Yes. We are not seeking that\nat all, Your Honor. We -- the PSLRA proportionate\nliability provisions govern this with respect to --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: So what are you seeking?\nHow would you measure your damages?\nMR. GROSSMAN: We would measure the damages,\nnumber one, that flow from this particular scheme. We\nwould have to first subtract the settlements that have\nbeen achieved already, and then the proportionate\nliability provisions of the PSLRA provide how you make\nthis determination.\nYou look at the particular nature of their\nconduct, and you look at the extent to which their\nparticular conduct had a causal relationship with the\ndamages.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Grossman, I'm\nconscious of eating into your time but a question -- how\nmany chains of this connection can you have? Let's say\nCharter was not a publicly traded company, but same\nthing happened with respect to Scientific-Atlanta, and\nthat made it look valuable to a company that is publicly\ntraded. So they decided to buy Charter and then that\nmade their profits look better to investors. Can you --\nhow many chains in the link can you go?\nMR. GROSSMAN: Well, I -- I think you can go\nso long as the person's deceptive conduct has the\npurpose of furthering a scheme to defraud. If they\nengage in some deceptive conduct that was not in\nfurtherance of the scheme to defraud, that's the end of\nthe chain. I --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Grossman.\nMR. GROSSMAN: Thank you, Your Honor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Shapiro.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN M. SHAPIRO.\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. SHAPIRO: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nMy friend has just asked the Court to expand\nan implied cause of action by diluting traditional\nrequirements such as the reliance requirement and by\neroding this Court's precedent in the Central Bank case.\nThe Court has said in the past that it must\nbe very cautious about expanding implied causes of\naction, but here there are special reasons for caution.\nExpanding the implied cause of action would give\nplaintiff the very thing that Congress said it should\nnot get in section 20(e) of the Exchange Act.\nCongress wanted cases like this one to be\nhandled by an expert and disinterested administrative\nagency.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's if you equate this\nwith aiding-and-abetting, and I think the question is is\nthere a middle category between Charter, who is\nclearly primarily liable, and Central Bank, that didn't\ndo anything deceptive?\nMR. SHAPIRO: The Central Bank case, I\nbelieve, answers that by saying to be a primary violator\nyou have to satisfy all the prerequisites of 10(b)\nliability, including reliance, loss causation, the\n\"in-connection-with\" standard. And here plaintiffs fail\nto meet these tests. And Congress in 20(e) --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you are saying -- I\nthought your argument, unlike the government's argument,\nis that there was no deceptive device. There was no\ndeceptive device. They simply aided and abetted.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Yes. That's one of the\narguments we make. It is this case is governed by\nCentral Bank because the defendant did not use or employ\ndeception in connection with a securities transaction.\nThat exactly describes what Charter did.\nNow, what exactly describes what the vendors\nare alleged to do is what is said in 20(e) -- to\nknowingly give substantial assistance to someone else\nthat is misleading an investor. That fits this case\nlike a glove --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I thought -- I agree\nwith Justice Ginsburg. I thought the \"in-connection-with\"\nargument is actually in addition to or separate from an\nadditional argument you made that there was no deceptive\nstatement made here. I thought that's what you were\narguing, and I have problems with that argument because\nthe statute doesn't require a statement. It requires\n-- conduct suffice.\nMR. SHAPIRO: We don't make these arguments\nwithout reference to each other. We think all of these\nstatutory terms have to be viewed together. You have to\nuse deception in connection with securities trading,\nwhich these vendors did not do. That's what Charter\ndid. And --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You don't defend the\nposition --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Would you say that there\nwas deception, standing alone?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, we have -- we have\nsuggested that that is not true when you're speaking\nwith somebody that knows the facts such as Charter.\nCharter understood all these facts. Charter could have\naccounted for these transactions correctly, itself. The\nvendors did that. They didn't recognize any revenues\nhere. It was up to Charter to account for these\ntransactions properly. Congress required it to do that,\nso it is the speaker here.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But Charter said --\nvendors, I need you to consummate this fraud on the\npublic. I can't do it without you. I've got to have\nthose revenues that you're going to give me through\nthese phony advertising payments at four or five times\nthe usual rate.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, we believe even placing\nthat most pejorative characterization on these facts,\nwhich we don't agree are the true facts, that still --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But you must assume that\nthey are now.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Assuming that they are, that\nthis is a 20(e) situation where it is alleged that the\nvendors gave substantial, knowing assistance to somebody\nwho was committing a fraud. And Congress said that an\nexpert and disinterested administrative agency should\ndecide whether to proceed, because it is so slippery to\napply these characterizations.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's if they are --\nthat's if they are aiders and if there are only two\ncategories and everyone who is not Charter is an aider\nand abettor, then you're right. But if there's a middle\ncategory of people who, while not the benefited company\n-- the company that's trying to achieve the deception --\nbut made it possible for that -- for that deception to\nhappen.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, you know that's an exact\ndescription of Central Bank because there it was alleged\nthat the trustee entered --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: No --\nMR. SHAPIRO: -- into a secret agreement.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: In Central Bank, it was\nconceded that the bank engaged in no deceptive act.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, the --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Here there is the charge\nthat it did engage in deceptive acts.\nMR. SHAPIRO: What was conceded was that the\nbank made no statement to investors, but what was\nalleged in the complaint and argued in the briefs was\nthat the bank entered into a secret side agreement that\nenabled the use of a fraudulent prospectus that\nunleashed securities that were worthless on investors,\nand investors said, we were depending on our trustee to\nprevent that from happening.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Now, I take it, though, you\ndo not defend the position that there must -- for 10(b)\nliability -- that there must have been a statement\naddressed to investors.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, we -- we think that for\nreliance purposes, there --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well, do you --\nMR. SHAPIRO: -- the defendant has to\ncommunicate with investors.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Would you answer my\nquestion first? Do you take the position that there can\nbe no 10(b) liability without a statement addressed to\ninvestors?\nMR. SHAPIRO: It has to be communicated to\nthe investors and it has to be attributed under the case\nlaw to the speaker.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: You mean the statement as\nsuch or a statement which could not have been made but\nfor the statements of the Respondents must be\ncommunicated to the investors? Which one?\nMR. SHAPIRO: That -- that kind of but-for\ncausation is not sufficient. That is not reliance.\nThat kind of --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So are you -- so you are\nsaying that there can be no causation and hence, you\nknow -- and I think you're going further. You're saying\nthere can be no liability within the description of\n10(b) unless there is a statement directly addressed to\nthe investors, is that correct?\nMR. SHAPIRO: That is one of our\nsubmissions, but we also say that the substance of these\nstatements was never communicated to investors. Only\nCharter --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Because the whole purpose\nof it --\nMR. SHAPIRO: -- spoke to the investors and\nnever summarized these.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Shapiro, if --\nMR. SHAPIRO: Yes?\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: If it was communicated to\ninvestors that there had been $20 per set box over the\nregular price, if there had been advertising that was\npaid for by the very money that Charter gave, then the\nwhole thing would have failed. So this can work only if\nthe vendors are silent. Silence and not speech is what\ncounts. If the vendors communicate anything at all, the\nwhole thing fails.\nMR. SHAPIRO: But the -- the communication,\nYour Honor, has to be to the market and to investors.\nThere was no duty to disclose to investors here. The\nonly communications the vendors made were \"we're raising\nour prices 6 percent, the date of our contract is August\n31st, for the simple reason that it started the very\nnext day\" --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Was there any --\nMR. SHAPIRO: -- on September 1st.\"\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Was there any economic\nsubstance to this?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Oh, of course. There was\neconomic substance from the vendors' perspective. They\nwere selling their products at exactly the price that\nthey wanted to receive for those products and they were\ngetting some free cooperative advertising thrown in at\nthe same time.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it true that the price\nthat they were charging, they did not charge to other\ncustomers -- the $20 hike?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, it's true because they\nweren't concerned with that because they weren't paying\nfor it. Charter was paying for this cooperative --\ncooperative advertising, the reason being --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But it was --\nMR. SHAPIRO: -- that Charter had a big\ninterest.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- a sham then, because\nthey said the reason they upped the price $20 a box was\nthey -- the inflationary conditions, so they had to\nrenegotiate the contract, but didn't renegotiate with\nany of their other customers.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, Your Honor, from the\nvendors' perspective, this was a transaction that\nappeared to be a way to increase cooperative\nadvertising. It cost the vendors no money. They were\ntold by Charter that Arthur Andersen had approved the\ntransaction. That's alleged in the Barford indictment.\nThen they went home and talked to their own auditors --\nhow do you account for this unusual transaction? The\nauditors said, you cannot record any revenues from the\ntransaction. They didn't record any revenues. They\nexpected Charter to do the same thing, to not record\nrevenues --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but that's --\nMR. SHAPIRO: -- if that's what the rules\nrequired.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: -- that's not the\nallegation of the complaint. I -- I thought the\nallegation of the complaint was that they -- they\nknew that this was a fraud and they participated in\nthe fraud.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Yes, they -- they do allege.\nI'm merely pointing out that in the Barford --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But I mean that -- so that\nyour answer doesn't seem to be -- get us very far on a\nlegal point.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, we say that if you take\nthe complaint at face value and you don't even consider\nthe Barford indictment that they cite, that it still is\na classic example of knowingly giving substantial\nassistance to someone else that is making misstatements\nto investors, because these vendors didn't make any\nmisstatement to investors. Nobody relied on their sales\ncorrespondence. It sat in a file drawer until long\nafter the stock had gone all the way up and come all the\nway down.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's the essence of the\nscheme. You said that they -- they are home free\nbecause they didn't themselves make any statement to\ninvestors. But they set up Charter to make those\nstatements, to swell its revenues -- revenues that it in\nfact didn't have.\nMR. SHAPIRO: But Congress's policy judgment\nhere is that the SEC, an expert agency that is\nimpartial, should evaluate a claim of that sort and\ndecide whether to proceed.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: That's if they are aiders\nand abettors, which is what Congress covered. And I\nagain go back to, is there another category or is\neveryone -- either Charter, the person whose stock is at\nstake, the company whose stock is at stake and everyone\nelse is an aider? I take it that that's your position.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It's either the company\nwhose stock is in question or you're an aider and\nabettor.\nMR. SHAPIRO: You are only a primary\nviolator under -- under Central Bank if each and every\nelement of 10b-5 liability is satisfied, including\nreliance on your statement, including the\n\"in-connection-with\" test, and including loss causation.\nNone of those tests are satisfied here, but what is\nsatisfied is section 20(e), which says, did they\nknowingly give substantial assistance to somebody who is\ncommitting a fraud? And that -- that fits this case\nlike a glove --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If we accept --\nMR. SHAPIRO: -- if Congress wanted the SEC\nto address --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: If we accept your theory\nof the case and we then get another case in which an\naccountant or an attorney who prepares the statement for\npublication to the investors and then gives it to\nCharter, and they are before us, could we find liability\nunder 10b-5 as to the accountants and still rule -- and\nstill keep our ruling in favor of your client here?\nMR. SHAPIRO: It really depends on --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And if so, what would --\nMR. SHAPIRO: -- on the circumstances.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And if so, what would be\nthe rationale?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Some attorneys are control\npersons within corporations, and in-house counsel that\ndrafts the disclosure statement which contains a\nfalsehood may be liable as in the McConville case, which\nthe Court recently considered. Individuals may be\nliable --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: How about outside\naccountants and attorneys who deliberately and directly\nparticipate in negotiating -- or in drafting the false\ndisclosure statements?\nMR. SHAPIRO: I --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Could they be liable and\nunder your theory of the case, but your client not\nliable?\nMR. SHAPIRO: It -- it's possible. Your\nHonor, at the end of your --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Well what about in this\ncase? Let's be specific. As I understood an earlier\nanswer of yours, the answer was that Arthur Andersen\nknew what was going on. If I've -- if you are -- and\nas I understand it, that's not what was charged -- but\nif that's correct, Arthur Andersen did know what was\ngoing on. Can Arthur Andersen be held liable under\n10b-5 --\nMR. SHAPIRO: Absolutely --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- whereas your client\ncannot?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Yes, sir. The reason --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: And the difference is?\nMR. SHAPIRO: The reason is they issued\nopinions that were circulated to investors, that were\nattributed to them and which were authorized by them,\nand if a lawyer does the same thing, if Steve Shapiro\nwrites an opinion letter and circulates it to investors\nand it's full of falsehoods --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But --\nMR. SHAPIRO: -- I can be held liable for\nthat --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What if Arthur Andersen --\nMR. SHAPIRO: -- as a speaker.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: What if Arthur Andersen has\na footnote in there saying, this is okay because we have\nthis -- this letter from I forget which one of the two\nRespondents it was, saying there's been inflation and\ntherefore we've got to renegotiate the prices and jack\nthem up 20 percent, Arthur Andersen knows that that is\nfalse and the Respondent who made it knows that it is\nfalse, can the Respondent who made it then be held\nliable?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Only people who speak to the\nmarket --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but doesn't --\nMR. SHAPIRO: -- and induce investor\nreliance.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but doesn't -- doesn't\nthe Respondent in that case know that it is likely that\nthe auditor is going to indicate the basis for its\nstatement, that the transaction is okay --\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- and, therefore, isn't it\nreasonable to suppose that they anticipated that their\nstatement would be communicated to the market?\nMR. SHAPIRO: That is just aiding and\nabetting, and in fact Congress dealt with that squarely\nin section 303 --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: But there's a communication\nto the market there --\nMR. SHAPIRO: Oh, yes --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: -- and there's a reason to\nexpect that communication.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Yes.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Doesn't that make any\ndifference?\nMR. SHAPIRO: That is not sufficient.\nCongress addressed that in section 303 of\nSarbanes-Oxley, and it held that any person -- said any\nperson including a vendor that misleads an auditor can\nbe held liable in an SEC proceeding only, not in a\nprivate suit. It excluded private actions.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is the word \"only\" in\nthere?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Pardon me?\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Is the word \"only\" in\nthere?\nMR. SHAPIRO: The word \"exclusively\" is in\nthere --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: In the statute?\nMR. SHAPIRO: -- and my --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So you have an independent\ndefense quite apart from -- from the construction of\n10b-5?\nMR. SHAPIRO: We rely on 20(e) and 303 of\nSarbanes-Oxley, and my friend has made the argument --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Which I thought speak\nabout aiders and abettors.\nMR. SHAPIRO: It's talking about an aider\nand abettor that misleads an auditor and then --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But is usually --\nMR. SHAPIRO: -- the auditor issues a false\ncertification.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- aider and abettor --\nthen again we get back to the question: If there's\nnothing in this world other than the company that puts\nout the false statement and the aider and abettor --\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well -- oh, no --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: -- and is there something\nin between?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Your Honor, there are other\npersons that are control persons within a company who\nare liable.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But we're taking those out.\nWe're talking about independent actors.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Independent actors that don't\nspeak to the markets and cause direct reliance on their\nown statements are aiders and abettors. And they are supposed\nto be dealt with by the SEC, an expert agency.\nNow, my -- you know, my friend made the\nargument about Sarbanes-Oxley that there's a savings\nclause in that provision that preserves other remedies.\nBut if you look at the legislative history, it says\nexplicitly we are preserving SEC remedies. We want the\nSEC to pursue these suits. And Congress refused in 2002\nin Sarbanes-Oxley to reinstate the aiding-and-abetting\nprivate liability cause of action.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you know, Mr. Shapiro,\nif in the law of torts and the restatement of torts or\nin other areas of the law there is some third\nclassification that's between aider and abettor in\nprinciple?\nMR. SHAPIRO: I don't know the answer.\nAlthough in these statutes themselves there are such\nprovisions not included in section 10(b). For example\nin section 18(a), if you cause some other person to make\na false statement in a financial statement, you can be\nheld liable, but they are not invoking it in section 18.\nSame thing under section 17. If you engage in a scheme\nto cause some falsehood, you can be prosecuted by the\ngovernment.\nBut nowhere has Congress said that an\nindividual litigant can bring a claim like that without\nregard for reliance and \"in connection with\" and the\nloss causation test.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Let's assume there is\nreliance and loss causation. Let me ask a question very\nsimilar to what Justice Ginsburg has posed a couple of\ntimes. She has said is there a third category. My\nquestion is, is there an overlap? Can there be an\noverlap?\nMR. SHAPIRO: No, I don't think there can be.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Because Congress intended in\nsection 20(e) to have an expert agency address these\ncases and not to have the trial --\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Congress intended an expert\nagency to address solely aiding-and-abetting cases. My\nquestion is if there is an overlap -- A, can there be an\noverlap? And if so, I don't see why Congress's intent to\nreserve aiding-and-abetting alone to the agency affects\nthe determination of this case.\nMR. SHAPIRO: We believe they are separate\ncategories and that Central Bank tells us exactly who\nthe primary violator is. He is somebody who makes a\nstatement that investors rely on in connection with\nsecurities transactions, and that is not these vendors.\nThat is exactly what section 20(e) addresses and commits\n--\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Could you amend that to\nsay -- you don't insist that he make a statement that\ninvest -- he could engage in a deceptive practice\ndirected at investments?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Absolutely. Absolutely. We\ndon't quarrel over that, Justice Scalia.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: For example, for example,\nlet's assume in this case that Charter said we've, we've\ngot to let the investors know that our cost of doing\nbusiness is going up, and we want to you make an\nannouncement that you're jacking up your price 20\npercent. In that case there would be primary liability.\nMR. SHAPIRO: Absolutely.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Why in that case is there\nnot also aiding-and-abetting? We know perfectly well\nwhy they are doing it, and they are doing it solely to\naid and abet Charter in its scheme themselves enjoying\na wash transaction. Why isn't that both primary and\naiding-and-abetting?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, it's primary because\nthere is the communication to the market that's missing\nhere.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: We know it's primary. Why\nisn't it also aiding-and-abetting?\nMR. SHAPIRO: You can call it -- both of\nthose things.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: If you can call it, why\nisn't there the kind of overlap which raises the\nquestion that Justice Ginsburg has raised?\nMR. SHAPIRO: You can't have primary\nliability, which they are asserting here, without the\nstatement to the market. And it can be a statement by\nconduct, and it can be by nodding of the head.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: So you are saying there can\nbe an overlap but there is no overlap that helps the\nPetitioner in this case?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Oh, yes. Nodding the head is\nthe same thing as saying yes. But it has to be made\ndirectly to an investor and cause reliance by that\ninvestor. That's what's missing here.\nSo there is nothing wrong with the Eighth\nCircuit's decision. It didn't address that refinement,\nbecause it has no bearing on this case. So there is no\npoint in reversing the decision. It has to be affirmed\nin our view for want of reliance, for want of loss\ncausation, for lack of \"in connection with\", and because\nmost importantly, Congress intended to remove this\ncategory of case and commit it to an expert agency as\npart of its very important reform effort to deal with\nexcessive litigation that was harming our economy.\nThis was an important concept for Congress.\nAnd it said it twice: First in the PSLRA in 1995, then\nin 2002, in the Sarbanes-Oxley law. And it removed even\nclaims that you mislead an auditor under section 303 of\nSarbanes-Oxley. And there is no savings clause there\nfor private actions. Congress refused to permit the\nprivate actions.\nInstead, it permitted the SEC to bring\nintentional misconduct cases under section 20(e) or\nnegligent misconduct cases under section 303 or under\nsection 13. And the SEC has a broad panoply of\nremedies. It doesn't have to just allege intentional --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Does the SEC distinguish\nthis kind of situation where silence is the essence of\nthe thing for the deceiver, silence not speech? Does\nthe SEC distinguish this from aiding-and-abetting?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Well, the SEC's view is the\none rejected by the Solicitor General, and that's this\npurpose-and-effect standard that's been advocated, which\nwe think is hopelessly vague. And it overrides the\nreliance requirement. It overrides the \"in connection\nwith\" requirement. And it overrides loss causation, not\nto mention Central Bank.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Shapiro, what is your\nstrongest case, in your view, for the reliance\nrequirement?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Central Bank itself.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Central Bank itself?\nMR. SHAPIRO: Because the Court there\nsaid that even though the bank did something that was a\nsecret agreement that facilitated the issuer's\ndistribution of a false prospectus and caused all the\nharm to the shareholders, it was a direct sine qua non\ncause of all of that harm, that that was merely aiding\nand abetting, because there was no reliance on anything\nthat the bank stated or anything that the bank had a duty\nto state because of a fiduciary relationship.\nNow, the vendors here are even far more\nremoved from investors than the bank was in Central\nBank. The investors knew about the bank in Central\nBank, and they were relying on it to do its job. But\nthat was not sufficient because it made no statement\nthat the investors relied on. There is no\ncommunication here between these vendors and investors.\nThere is no way you could --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Shapiro, in your\njudgment, is the reliance requirement an element of\nthe violation or of the private cause of action?\nMR. SHAPIRO: It's the private cause of\naction. An important point, Justice Stevens, because\nthe SEC is not burdened with any of these elusive\ninquiries into but-for causation, speculative questions\nof indirect reliance; none of that burdens the SEC.\nAnd the SEC also has power to distribute\nfunds to investors. This is the better mousetrap that\nCongress prescribed for these kinds of cases. It didn't\nwant the trial lawyers to bring class actions that\nalways result in settlements.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Shapiro.\nMR. SHAPIRO: We thank the Court.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Hungar.\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. HUNGAR\nON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,\nAS AMICUS CURIAE,\nSUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. HUNGAR: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nThe court of appeals erred to the extent it\nheld that section 10(b) applies only to verbal\nmisrepresentations or omissions. But the court\ncorrectly held that this Court's decision in Central\nBank forecloses Petitioner's claim here. Like the\nplaintiff in Central Bank, Petitioner cannot establish\nreliance, a critical element of the section 10(b)\nimplied right of action.\nNeither Petitioner nor the market relied on\nor was even aware of any deceptive conduct or statement\nby Respondents --\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Hungar, I want to be\nsure I understand one part of the government's position.\nYou do take the position that there has a violation of\n10b-5?\nMR. HUNGAR: We haven't taken a position on\nthat question, Your Honor. We take the position that\nthere was deceptive conduct alleged. The -- one of the\nelements of a 10b-5 violation, but not the only\nelement.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Were the other elements\npresent?\nMR. HUNGAR: As I say, we have not taken --\nI mean, materiality, for instance, the \"in connection\nwith\" requirement, scienter, we haven't addressed those\nquestions and have not taken a position.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: Do you have an opinion as\nto whether there was a violation of 10(b) in this case?\nMR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You don't have an opinion?\nMR. HUNGAR: We haven't taken a position, and\n--\nJUSTICE STEVENS: I know you haven't taken a\nposition, but I was just wondering if you have an\nopinion?\n(Laughter.)\nMR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor. We haven't\naddressed the other elements and those -- questions that\nwe have -- because there is no need to resolve them in\nthis case and because they weren't resolved by the court\nof appeals or by the district court, we have chosen to\nfocus on what we think is dispositive and what was\nraised and decided below, which is reliance.\nJUSTICE STEVENS: You have not reached\nopinion as to whether there was a violation of the\nstatute?\nMR. HUNGAR: Correct.\nJUSTICE SOUTER: Has the SEC publicly taken\na position on that question?\nMR. HUNGAR: I'm not sure of the answer to\nthat question, Your Honor. Certainly individual\ncommissioners have given speeches and testified before\nCongress to the effect that the Commission voted in this\ncase to agree with our position on deception, the\nposition that's expressed in our brief, and by a\nthree-to-two vote to disagree with the position on\nreliance that is expressed in our brief. But I don't\nknow that there has been any official SEC Commission\nstatement to that effect that's been publicly released.\nAs I said, the only deceptive conduct that\nwas allegedly committed by Respondents in this case\ninvolves the backdating of contracts and the false\njustifications for the price increase. That conduct was\nnever disclosed to the market at any time during the\nclass period, and therefore, could not have been relied\non by the market or by Petitioners.\nAnd as a consequence, under this Court's\ndecisions in Central Bank and in Basic, reliance cannot\nbe established because the presumption of reliance that\nPetitioner seeks to invoke requires as a prerequisite to\nits invocation the existence of a publicly disseminated\nstatement from the defendant that was disseminated to,\nand therefore, relied on by the market. That did not\nhappen here with respect to Respondents.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Could the SEC get any\nmonetary recovery for the investors on your theory? You\nsay yes, it's a deceptive practice, but this belongs in\nthe SEC's bailiwick, not in private suits?\nMR. HUNGAR: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Private suits; obviously\nthey are seeking damages for the decline in the share\nprice. What could the SEC -- suppose it should take up\nthis case -- get by way of remedy?\nMR. HUNGAR: The SEC is entitled to obtain\ncivil fines, as well as disgorgement remedies.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there is no\ndisgorgement here because the vendors didn't get\nanything. For them it was a wash.\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, I don't know -- I believe\nin the, not in this case but in the Adelphia case, which\nis addressed --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, but this case,\ndisgorgement would not be a remedy. You say fines,\nbut those would be payable to the government, right?\nMR. HUNGAR: If I may -- yes, yes and no, I\nthink is the answer to that question; because under the\nfair funds provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, section\n308 of Sarbanes-Oxley, the SEC is authorized to take\nfines and distribute those -- add those to disgorgement\nrelief -- and distribute them to investors.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But there would be no\ndisgorgement relief.\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, I'm not sure I can agree\nwith that point. In the Adelphia matter --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: What profits did the\nvendors get? For them it was a wash. They got -- what\ndid they have to disgorge?\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, they obtained -- at least\nit appears that they obtained advertising that\npresumably had some value, although it didn't cost them\nanything; and presumably the SEC could seek the value of\nthat advertising. As I said, in the Adelphia matter\nwhere the SEC did pursue the vendors that assisted\nAdelphia in a somewhat similar transaction, it obtained\nsubstantial monetary recoveries from them. I --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: But did they receive\nsomething that they then disgorged?\nMR. HUNGAR: I believe the allegations were\nsimilar to those presented here. But in any event,\ncertainly the SEC has the authority to proceed in that\nfashion, and additionally the Justice Department has\nthe ability to proceed criminally and obtain substantial\nmonetary sanctions, either as part of a deferred\nprosecution agreement, as part of a restitutionary\nsanction and the like; but the fundamental point is that\nfor the private right of action to apply, as this Court\nsaid in Central Bank, all of the elements of the private\ncause of action must be satisfied with respect to the\nindividual defendant. That is the line.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you agree, do you\nagree with Mr. Shapiro, what I understood to be his\nargument, that 20(e), the aider and abettor statute,\nmore or less occupies the field here and there is no\nrole for additional 10b-5 liability?\nMR. HUNGAR: Well, I wouldn't say that it\noccupies the field per se, but what it does do is --\ngiven the timing of this Court's decision in Central\nBank in 1994, followed by Congress's considering the\nquestion whether to provide for secondary liability\nin private actions, and its decision not to authorize such\nsecondary liability -- what it does clearly suggest is\nthat this Court ought not adopt the expansive view of\nthe implied right of action that Petitioner is urging,\nbut instead both because the Court is appropriately\ncautious in expanding liability under implied rights of\naction, and because Congress has now looked at this\nquestion, not once but twice, and has declined to\nprovide secondary liability for secondary actors under\nthe cause of action.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You think that you are\neither a principal or an aider and abettor?\nMR. HUNGAR: You can -- it's possible for\nsomeone to be both but in order to be both they must\nhave -- they must have satisfied all of the elements.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: For the same act, I'm\ntalking about -- for the same act.\nMR. HUNGAR: Yes. For instance an auditor\nwho certifies false financial statements and allows\nthat -- its certification to be, to be publicly\ndisseminated, thereby aiding and assisting in the\nissuer's primary fraud, but is also a -- quite likely to\nbe a primary violator, because they have spoken to the\nmarket. The market is relying on their statements, and\nis aware that they are making them; and so they would be\nboth a primary violator, but could presumably be pursued\nas an aider and abettor. I don't think there is any\npreclusion of liability under both, but in order to be\nin that category you must be a primary violator. And\nhere, Petitioners have not established and cannot\nestablish the reliance element with respect to\nRespondents, because nothing that Respondents said or\ndid was disseminated to the market during the class\nperiod.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: And I take it in your view\nthey cannot establish the \"in connection with\"\nargument?\nMR. HUNGAR: We have not taken a position --\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Prior to the statment,\nthere is no reliance, but that there is \"in connection\nwith\" --\nMR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, I would hesitate to\nsay that, Your Honor, because the SEC and the United\nStates do not have to establish reliance in criminal or\ncivil enforcement proceedings, but we do have to\nestablish \"in connection with,\" and we think they are\ndifferent. We think reliance adds something more than\nwhat \"in connection with\" requires, and so I certainly\nwould urge the Court not to suggest that merely because\nreliance is not established, therefore \"in connection\nwith\" must not also be established; and that is one of\nthe reasons why we think that the \"in connection with\"\nquestion is best resolved, not in this case, but in the\ncase where it's been squarely presented, and preferably\na government enforcement action where the government\nhas an opportunity to tailor the case in an appropriate\nfashion.\nThe Court, as I said has been --\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's at least a\nlittle awkward for you to say we should wait for a case\nin which it's been fully presented when the argument\nyou're making here wasn't fully presented, or at\nleast not decided below.\nMR. HUNGAR: I think it was, Your Honor. It\nwas certainly briefed and argued in both the district\ncourt and the court of appeals. The district court\nsquarely resolved it at page 41a of the petition\nappendix. The court of appeals addressed reliance at\npage 10a of the petition appendix. It did not give it a\nfully orbed discussion.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understood the\ncourt of appeals' decision to be based on its\ndetermination that there was no deceptive act because\nthere was no statement or omission.\nMR. HUNGAR: But on page 10a, they also talk\nabout reliance, Your Honor; and what's important here to\nunderstand is that Petitioner's theory of reliance\nrests on a misstatement, because they say the market\n-- it's a basic presumption of reliance based on the\nfraud-on-the-market theory case. That's the only\nallegation of reliance in the complaint; that requires\nsomething publicly disseminated. The only thing that\nwas publicly disseminated is the statement. What the\ncourt of appeals said is, that doesn't work, there was\nno reliance because Respondents didn't make any publicly\ndisseminated statement. So it's actually, perhaps not a\ncomplete, but certainly a perfectly reasonable resolution\nof the reliance question; and therefore it is squarely\npresented. Petitioners raised reliance in their petition\n--\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't see --\nMR. HUNGAR: -- at page 25. In their\nopening brief at pages 37 to 40, it's squarely presented\nand --\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm looking at the court\nof appeals decision which I thought just said that there\nwas no deceptive device.\nMR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, on page 10a, the\nsecond line, the first full sentence, speaking of\nMotorola and Scientific-Atlanta, \"they did not issue\nany misstatement relied upon by the investing public,\"\nand then it goes on the next sentence: \"None of the\nalleged financial misrepresentations by Charter was made\nby or even with the approval of the vendors,\" that is\nthe Respondents.\nAgain as I say, it's not as complete a\ndiscussion of the reliance issue as we would have\nthought appropriate if we had been writing the opinion,\nbut it certainly does touch on the question and we think\nit's wholly presented.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Hungar.\nMr. Grossman, have you three minutes.\nREBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STANLEY M. GROSSMAN\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER\nMR. GROSSMAN: Thank you.\nI -- excuse me, I have three quick points to\nmake.\nOne, Mr. Shapiro and Mr. Hungar both said\nthat the advertising cost the vendors no money. Well,\nif the advertising cost them no money, why was there a\ncontract that they entered into for the purchase of\nadvertising? Clearly it was designed to give the false\nappearance that Charter had this additional $17 million\nin revenue.\nNumber two, the SEC did take a position in\nthe Simpson case as it submitted an amicus brief;\nCommissioner Cox testified before a House committee this\npast spring that they wanted to submit the same brief on\nthe same points supporting the position that we are\ntaking here; and the testimony of Commissioner Cox is\nappended to the briefs of Congressmen Franks and\nConyers.\nNumber three, Central Bank did not turn on\nreliance. Central Bank turned on the issue of deceptive\nconduct. There was no deceptive conduct in that case.\nThe plaintiffs conceded there was no deceptive conduct;\nthe court of appeals and the district court said there\nwas no deceptive conduct; it was strictly an aiding-and-\nabetting case.\nWith respect to the reliance issue in\nCentral Bank, what the Court did say was under\nplaintiff's theory he wouldn't have to prove reliance.\nHe only had to prove that he -- that the defendant\nsubstantially assisted a defendant who engaged in a\nprimary violation, but he would not have to prove any\nreliance by the aiding and abettor.\nNumber three, with respect to 20(e), how do\nmy friends on the other side read 20(e) in connection\nwith section 9 and section 18 of the Exchange Act, each\nof which provides remedies and private rights of actions\nagainst multiple parties? Under their definition, that\nwould appear to be displaced by 20(e). 20(e) was not\ndesigned, it was not intended to do anything but to give\nthe SEC the right to bring the very type of aiding-and-\nabetting action that this Court barred in Central Bank.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\n"
